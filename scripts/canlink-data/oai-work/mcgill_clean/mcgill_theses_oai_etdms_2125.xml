Eighty-five subjects are identified, and classified according to the age of their titles, their religious leanings and the geographical regions from which their titles and powers were drawn, to form anumber of distinct groups---the established nobility, new peers, Protestants, Catholics (both overt and conforming), peers from the highlands and isles, peers from central Scotland, and peers from the Anglo-Scottish border region. A social analysis of the total body of these peers and its sub-groupings is undertaken, and focuses on patterns associated with their birth, descent, education, succession, marriage, fertility and death. Where appropriate, the results are compared with data available from studies of the contemporary English aristocracy.

Primarily, it explores the influence of Marxist philosophies in politicizing the culture concept, and subsequently surveys the set of internal debates in progressive theory. Comparing the various strengths and limitations of political economy, American cultural consumption discourse, and British cultural materialism, ultimately the thesis argues in favour of instating the third paradigm as the privileged analytical model of progressive scholarship.

Children (N = 174) from grades 5 and 7 completed a questionnaire to evaluate cognitions and played a computer simulated card-cutting game. Cognitions were assessed after the game to examine if cognitive perceptions changed and then again one and four weeks later to evaluate if changes were maintained. Results reveal that experiencing repeated losses decreased perceived skill and increased perceptions of luck on gambling tasks in general. Cognitive changes in younger children were larger and were maintained longer than for older children. Analyses of game playing behaviour indicated that children in the losing condition chased losses by betting a larger percentage of bankrolls per hand in the final portion of game time. The results are discussed with emphasis on implications for prevention programs based on cognitive restructuring.</description><creator>Baboushkin, Hayley R.</creator><contributor>Derevensky, Jeffrey (advisor)</contributor><date>1998</date><subject>Cognition in children.</subject><subject>Gambling.</subject><title>The underlying cognitions in children's gambling behaviour /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dv13zw66z.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/12579v478</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:nc580p72d</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:17:26Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>As environmental issues and the communities that confront them increasingly transcend borders, environmentalists in the North (wealthier countries) and the South (poorer countries) face the challenges of effective communication and collaboration. Acknowledging differences in how environmentalists culturally construct the environment is an important starting point; particularly given the tendency on the part of Northern environmentalists to assume (a) that environmentalism is essentially the same in different cultures i.e., it is all like Northern environmentalism; and (b) that environmentalism is more developed in the North. This study examines and compares the constructed environments of a sample of Mexican and Canadian environmentalists. Some significant differences are identified. The environmentalists in the two countries constructed the environment differently as a result of their distinct histories, economies and use of technology. Cultural constructions of the physical environment overlap with and cannot be separated from constructions of the social, cultural, political and economic environment.</description><creator>Astbury, Janice.</creator><contributor>Meredith, Thomas C.

Using photographs, the writing of a third person narrative and in-depth interviews, 'my' participants and I generate a biography of the body. I focus on two emerging themes, body commentary and movement or physical activity, and their impact on the lives of adolescent girls.

To formulate this question, this thesis takes as a reference Chile's current political debate, in which some of the more contested political issues engage citizens' religious and ethical ideas and aspirations. To clarify the terms of the problem and explore the elements of an answer, this thesis resorts to the treatment of this issue in contemporary Anglo-American political and legal philosophy. This thesis tries to show that such restrictive views rests upon a liberal understanding of social and political relations and upon a commitment to the principle of state neutrality as the proper way to deal with social diversity. Given the importance attributed to John Rawls' work in Anglo-American political philosophy and the fact that he deals specifically with the issue of the use of religious arguments in political debate, this thesis concentrates in Rawls' political theory, as developed in Political Liberalism, as a concrete example of a restrictive view of the political role of religious arguments.

Parallel importation involves the sale of genuine products holding intellectual property rights which have been imported into a country without the authorization of the IP rightholder. This practice is opposed by those who claim that their rights are infringed. The author examines responses in Canada, the United States of America, and the European Union, and finds that they are not consistent. The author questions the applicability of using intellectual property rights to stop parallel importation and whether such measures are necessary to protect intellectual property rights and consumer welfare. According to the author, it is more appropriate to address rightholder concerns contractually. Consumer welfare can be assured with a statutory requirement that products have sufficient labelling to prevent confusion as to their origin.</description><creator>Osuna P√°ez, Maria Luisa.</creator><contributor>de Mestral, Armand (advisor)</contributor><date>1997</date><subject>Competition.</subject><subject>Copyright.</subject><subject>Trademarks.</subject><subject>Intellectual property.</subject><title>Parallel importation : a global analysis</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tx31qk963.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/k0698961d</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Comparative Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:v979v504w</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:17:30Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This paper examines legal and ethical issues facing physicians working in an environment of cost-cutbacks, competition for medical resources and lengthy waiting lists for treatment. The legal portion of the paper considers how a tort claim could be advanced by a (former) patient against a physician in the guise of a standard-of-care argument, as a breach of fiduciary duty, or as a failure to obtain informed consent. The bioethics portion of the paper examines the short-comings of professional codes and presents a system of ethical analysis for physicians to follow as a practical tool for difficult decisions. Since the extent of the physician's legal duty of care is unclear with respect to resource allocation issues, it is possible that bioethics, can provide assistance by heightening physician awareness regarding these types of dilemmas, by increasing physician-patient communication and by encouraging physicians to utilize a systematic method of ethical analysis.</description><creator>Morton, Wendy J.</creator><contributor>Keyserlingk, E.

This thesis attempts to determine whether regionalism is welfare-enhancing and is liberalising the global economy as envisioned by GATT Article XXIV. The answer is: not necessarily. Chapter One briefly discusses the principle of non-discrimination and provides a general account of the recent development of RTAs. Chapter Two examines the economic and political-economic aspects of RTAs, while Chapter Three examines their legal aspects. To put the two chapters into perspective, a case study of the North American Free Trade Agreement is conducted in Chapter Four. Chapter Five suggests that the global economy should revert its attention back to the multilateral trading system and/or RTAs should incorporate "open regionalism" into their framework to effectively counter the diversionary problems they cause. In closing, Chapter Five introduces the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, which is the only regional trading arrangement that is openly pursuing "open regionalism" and "multilateralism", as a model for all RTAs and as a bridge between regionalism and multilateralism.</description><creator>Liu, Yu-Tsyr, 1971-</creator><contributor>de Mestral, A.

Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG), because the remedies available to the parties to a contract of sale depend on the character of the breach. The Thesis analyzes the concept. It canvasses the different approaches employed by scholars and courts in determining fundamental breach and examines whether they can be justified by the rules of interpretation under the CISG. This examination shows that none of the approaches can be applied to all potential situations of fundamental breach and that their concurrent application is likely to produce conflicting results. This Thesis introduces a new methodology, which is based on a single concept applicable in all circumstances. Such methodology would also provide greater certainty and predictability to international sales transactions as required by the needs of the business world.</description><creator>Koch, Robert, 1965-</creator><contributor>Stevens, David (advisor)</contributor><date>1998</date><subject>Political Science, International Law and Relations.</subject><subject>Law.</subject><title>The concept of fundamental breach of contract under the United Nations Convention on contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG) /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/08612q816.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/g732dc09c</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Comparative Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:rj430684z</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:17:33Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Since 1944, the International Civil Aviation Organization (I.C.A.O.) has the mandate to create and to adopt safety standards for the benefit of all Member States and for the safe operation of the air navigation. It is essential, for the air transport overall success, that each country respects those standards and strongly implement them. However, some Member States do not indicate their differences to those standards. This unstable situation has pushed certain states to adopt unilateral action against those countries that do not respect international standards. Indeed, they will not emit an operation permit to any country that does not comply with the I.C.A.O.'s minimal standards. Accordingly, some official actions had to be taken by the (I.C.A.O.) In October 1994, the Organization established the safety oversight program, which mandate was to identify Member States' difficulties regarding air operation and give them assistance to help them resolve their difficulties. Our thesis work will identify the events leading to the application of this new program and explain the general structure of it. Finally, we will overlook the next steps of the I.C.A.O.'s program. Some commentary on the I.C.A.O.'s program will be offered throughout this thesis.</description><creator>Desrosiers, Alain, 1966-</creator><contributor>Milde, Michael (advisor)</contributor><date>1998</date><subject>Political Science, International Law and Relations.</subject><subject>Transportation.</subject><title>Programme de l'O.A.C.I. pour la supervision de la s√©curit√© a√©rienne</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qb98mh646.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rj430684z</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Air and Space Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:ws859h79t</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:17:34Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In Germany, the role of shareholders in the structure of corporate governance has recently been the object of extensive discussion. Shareholder value has become a fashionable concept in the last few years, and some voices have demanded a stronger orientation of German corporations towards the consideration of shareholder value. Also, factual changes in the environment of the German corporate system have taken place. Germany faces major changes of the social security system that could encourage the emergence of private pension funds and modify the structure of share ownership. The capital market is gaining importance. A comparison of the historical development of the corporate legal system and the capital market provides some explanation for the differences in the corporate structure in Germany and the United States. A close examination of the present American system of corporate governance, which is known for the pursuit of shareholder value, will show, that despite similarities, there remain fundamental differences between the two systems, which will make the incorporation of shareholder value into the German system of corporate governance difficult.</description><creator>Binder, Anette.</creator><contributor>Stevens, David (advisor)</contributor><date>1998</date><subject>Business Administration, Management.</subject><subject>Law.</subject><title>Corporate governance in Germany : are there lessons to be learned from the United States?</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xg94hr80f.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ws859h79t</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Comparative Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:5x21th602</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:17:34Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The global telecommunications environment is undergoing rapid and radical transformation. Liberalisation in the industrialised economies, prompted by the fast pact of innovation in telecommunications technology has spilled over to developing countries, which now realise the significance of telecommunications for socio-economic development within their economies. The most significant aspect of these developments is that it has led to the liberalisation of telecommunications companies and the opening up of market access under the auspices of the World Trade Organisation. There is now open competition in a glob al telecommunications industry. Multinational companies equipped with the state-of-the-art technologies, ample experience and service skills, as well as huge economies of scale and scope are reaching out to connect isolated markets in developing nations into the global information economy. What is important now for developing countries is not to promote competition in the telecommunications market for its own sake. Rather, they should establish concrete goals in their restructuring exercise that can lead to development and improved living conditions for their people. This thesis argues that in their telecommunications privatisation programmes, developing countries must primarily consider their economic, cultural and social environment, and adopt appropriate policies and regulatory schemes geared towards realising their national development goals and aspirations.</description><creator>Afranie-Amanoh, Mercy.</creator><contributor>Janda, Richard (advisor)</contributor><date>1998</date><subject>Sociology, Social Structure and Development.</subject><subject>Law.</subject><title>Privatisation of telecommunications and its implications for development in developing countries</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/k35696547.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5x21th602</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Comparative Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:tx31qk97c</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:17:35Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>An emerging phenomenon, which anticipates deregulation, liberalization of trade, and changes in competition law, is the increasing interaction among telecommunications carriers resulting in the formation of global alliances. These global alliances---on a larger scale---also involve broadcasting and computing companies that have been regulated in a totally different fashion. A likely consequence of this sweeping technological revolution is that telecommunications will gradually integrate and converge with these segments of the communications industry. As part of this all-service-convergence trend, a number of key international telecommunications alliances (henceforth ITAs) are scrutinized. The thesis begins by canvassing leading business-organization theories that attempt to account for the emergence of ITAs. The first part concludes with the proposal of a multi-causal approach and the description of ITAs as hybrid organizations. The second part of the thesis canvasses legal responses to the emergence of ITAs and evaluates the institutional capacity of existing regulatory mechanisms. The goal of this study is to produce an analytical framework for how this newly globalized industry should be treated by legislators and policymakers.</description><creator>Adamska, Monika.</creator><contributor>Janda, Richard (advisor)</contributor><date>1998</date><subject>Political Science, International Law and Relations.</subject><title>International telecommunications alliances and foreign direct investment as means of globalization : legal and regulatory responses to the emergence of super carriers</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8k71nk33n.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/tx31qk97c</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Comparative Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:6t053j24z</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:17:36Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Anemia is a hallmark of chronic renal failure (CRF) which, if left untreated, is a major contributing factor to the high morbidity and mortality of this condition. This characteristically hypoproliferative anemia is due primarily to decreased erythropoietin (EPO) production by the diseased kidney. Currently, correction of the anemia with recombinant human EPO (r-HuEPO) constitutes the mainstay of management in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). An alternative approach to the treatment of the anemia of CRF is the administration of androgens. My project utilized a well characterized mouse model of surgically-induced renal failure to study the mechanism(s) of androgen effect on the anemia of CRF. Recent experiments in this model revealed a dose-response to r-HuEPO similar to that in humans, absent EPO gene expression in the liver and full correction of the anemia of CRF by the administration of a combination of subtherapeutic doses of r-HuEPO and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), a known regulator of erythropoiesis in the normal physiological state. My hypothesis followed two lines of investigation: androgens may act to increase EPO production or they may increase production of IGF-I, thereby increasing extra-renal erythropoietic activity by either of the two hormones.

We used data from a cohort of 12,301 asthmatics to fit a change-point Poisson regression model to estimate the maximum safe dose of these beta-2 agonists and its confidence limit. Using the profile likelihood method, the maximum likelihood estimate of the change-point is 1.8 canisters/month, and excessive rate of fatal or near fatal asthma attack is 3.7 (2.7--4.7) and 7.0 (3.5--10.4) per 1,000 asthmatics per year before and after the change-point. Its bootstrap 95-percentile intervals are (2, 64) and (2, 71) canisters/year respectively for non-parametric and parametric approaches. Simulation studies found the profile likelihood and bootstrap methods useful for inference of the change-point in providing safe dose information for these drugs. Future studies are needed to obtain more precise bootstrap intervals and to assess the confounding effects of covariates.</description><creator>Yang, Hong, 1968 Nov. 13-</creator><contributor>Suissa, Samy (advisor)</contributor><contributor>Platt, R.

The ten-state Pink model, which is originally proposed to describe the main transition of pure saturated lipid bilayers, is extended in order to examine both one-component lipid bilayers and binary lipid bilayers containing peripheral proteins. The peripheral protein is introduced as a positively charged cylinder which covers seven lipid chains and the protein-lipid interaction is assumed to be mainly electrostatic. Metropolis Monte Carlo simulations are performed to describe the thermodynamic properties of the model including lipid-protein interaction in terms of order parameters and microconfigurations. The calculations are carried out for two minimal models where the protein concentration in the bilayer surface is either fixed or varies as the external conditions are changed. The basic phase behavior of lipid-protein systems are presented for each model. In both models, the lipid-protein interaction manifests itself by changes in the physical and thermodynamic properties of lipid bilayers and protein aggregation in the main transition region due to the forming of the gel-fluid phase coexistence. Finally, a non-equilibrium model due to Sabra and Mouristen is modified to describe the non-equilibrium phenomena of lipid bilayers with peripheral proteins which has two internal states. The steady-state of the system and its comparison to the case of integral proteins are described. The thesis is concluded in the final chapter which contains a discussion of future work.</description><creator>Wu, Yali, 1974-</creator><contributor>Zuckermann, Martin J.

A general theory is presented under the guidance of two physical principles: charge and current conservation, gauge invariance. As the AC response is intrinsically a many-body problem, we have to treat the scattering problem and the charge redistribution effects in a self-consistent manner. One quantity of particular interest is the mesoscopic capacitance. In mesoscopic structures where the electric screening length is comparable to the geometric size, the experimentally relevant capacitance is no longer due to geometry alone but to the electro-chemical potential and the capacitance crucially depends on the density of states of the conductor. Furthermore, the phase-coherent nature of the carrier motion leads to striking asymmetric effects in the magneto-capacitance. The general theory is put forth into numerical simulations where the theory is justified. The study of AC transport in mesoscopic structures should not only help us to better understand the physics of many-body systems, but should also provide valuable knowledge in characterizing and controlling small electronic devices which is of great technological importance.</description><creator>Wei, Haiqing, 1970-</creator><contributor>Guo, Hong (advisor)</contributor><date>1998</date><subject>Physics, Condensed Matter.</subject><title>Coherent AC transport theory and quantum capacitance</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/c821gn10v.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/n583xx04k</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Physics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:gh93h1689</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:17:39Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Studies in cystic fibrosis patients have suggested that the balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines may be important in controlling infection and tissue destruction during bronchopulmonary Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) infection. Here, the inflammatory response was characterized in a murine model of bronchopulmonary PA infection in resistant BALB/c and susceptible C57BL/6 mice following intratracheal inoculation with 10 5 CFU of mucoid PA entrapped in agar beads. On day 7 post infection, BALB/c mice had significantly less bacteria and significantly more IL-10 in the lungs as compared to C57BL/6 mice while the levels of TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma levels were comparable. Bronchoalveolar lavage revealed that the significantly lower lung inflammatory response in BALB/c mice was composed of 45% PMN, 30% lymphocytes and 25% macrophages while that of C57BL/6 mice was composed of 62% PMN, 8% lymphocytes, and 30% macrophages. Alveolar macrophages from C57BL/6 mice spontaneously produced significantly higher NO levels while cells from BALB/c mice produced significantly more TNF-alpha, either spontaneously or following stimulation with LPS or heat-killed PA. There was no difference in IL-10 production. Lung PMN from either strain produced undetectable levels of NO and high levels of TNF-alpha. PMN from BALB/c mice, however, produced significantly higher levels of IL-10. The severity of infection in both strains of mice was exacerbated by administration of the anti-IL-10 mAb JES5-2A5. IL-10 neutralization resulted in an increased inflammatory response, increased bacterial counts, and increased TNF-alpha levels in both mouse strains. The increased inflammatory response in resistant BALB/c mice was due to a significant influx of macrophages whereas in susceptible C57BL/6 mice a significant influx of PMN and decreased numbers of macrophages were observed.

During the summer of 1997, sampling was conducted in wildfires burnt 2, 14, and 21 years ago, stands clearcut within +/-3 years of each fire, and undisturbed control stands. At each site an estimation of vegetative cover of each species present and a volumetric sample of the forest floor (FH), and mineral soil (0--10 cm) were collected from at least 8 fire and cut sites and at least 4 control sites in each study area. The comparison between the soil fertility of stands clearcut and burnt suggested that important differences exist following these two disturbance types in the boreal forest. The forest floor of clearcut sites had greater dry mass, mass of total nutrients and mineralized N than fire or control sites, whereas fire sites generally had higher pH and concentrations of total nutrients than clearcut or control sites. Partitioning of the variance of the vegetation data between soil fertility and general site characteristic variables was carried out to evaluate the direct influence of post-disturbance soil fertility on the composition of regenerating vegetation. All explanatory variables accounted for 53.6% of the variance, of which 23.2% was exclusively attributed to soil fertility variables. Disturbance severity is suggested as an important factor, directly affecting the initial composition of the regenerating vegetation, and indirectly affecting soil fertility and stand productivity in the later stages of regeneration.</description><creator>Simard, Daniel, 1973-</creator><contributor>Fyles, J.

The recently documented cytokine, stem cell factor (SCF) is critical for mast cell growth, and for chemoattraction of progenitor cells and eosinophils. We hypothesized that allergic asthma is associated with the increased expression of SCF and its receptor, c-kit. The expression of SCF and c-kit was studied within the airways of atopic asthmatics and non-asthmatic controls using in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry. The results demonstrated significantly increased expression of SCF and c-kit in bronchial biopsies and BAL from asthmatics compared to controls. SCF was preferentially localized to epithelium, and was also found in macrophages. The results suggest that SCF may play a role in the pathogenesis of allergic asthma, and support the importance of epithelium in regulation of immune responses in the lung.</description><creator>Shablovsky, Georgi.</creator><date>1998</date><subject>Health Sciences, Immunology.</subject><title>The role of stem cell factor (SCF) and c-kit receptor in allergic asthma /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6108vd650.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qn59q632x</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Experimental Medicine</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:g158bk33z</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:17:41Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Previous work has shown that some Neisseria meningitidis strains do not express the Class 1 Outer Membrane Protein (OMP1; the porA gene product) as assessed by SDS-PAGE analysis of OMPs. Northern analysis has identified the level of control of porA expression as transcriptional. Promoter regions differed in the number of guanosine residues in a poly(G) track located between the -10 and the -35 regions. Strains that do not express the protein either had an adenosine residue within this poly(G) track or contained nine or less guanosine residues in this track. We investigated the role of the promoter region of porA in the regulation of transcription. The promoter regions of the porA gene from three strains, two of which do not express the OMP1, were analyzed. Promoters were cloned into a promoter-probe vector (pDN19/ acO) possessing a promoterless lacZ gene and expressed in Escherichia coli.
