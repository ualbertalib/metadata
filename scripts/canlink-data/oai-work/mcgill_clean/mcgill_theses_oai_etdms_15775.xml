According to the annual report of the Quebec Bureau of Statistics for 1961, of a total cultivated area of 7,864,176 acres in Quebec, 3,458,000 acres were in hay. The value of the hay crop in 1961 was 55.8 percent of the value of all field crops in the province. Since alfalfa, birdsfoot trefoil, red, alsike, and ladino clovers are cominant in this hay crop, their agricultural importance is apparent. This, together with the fact that some of these forage legumes, mainly red clover and alfalfa, are the most common rotation crops, led to the choice of these plants for study.</description><creator>Aubé, Claude.</creator><contributor>Sackston, W.

A simplified analytical solution is presented for the case where injection produces boundary layer separation, and the case where mixing between injected liquid and supersonic stream occurs without separation. The side specific impulse and cooling effect produced by water injection are computed for separation. Very high values of specific impulse and temperature reduction are predicted. Mixing is found to be a generally unsteady condition except at low temperatures and low injection rates. Experiments show that separation does occur and that the predicted pressure increase due to injection is easily attainable.</description><creator>Attas, Jack. E.</creator><contributor>Molder, S.

But recently this factor, the affective tone of verbal materials, has been neglected in the psychology of learning, apparently because the experimental literature, on the whole, presented an inconsistent picture. In some experiment s pleasant words were learned faster than unpleasant words, while in other experiments there was no difference between these two categories. The present thesis re-evaluates the earlier studies and organizes them into a meaningful pattern. On the basis of this pattern and within the context of current psychological ideas, a theoretical framework is developed and various hypotheses that emerge are tested with new experiments.</description><creator>Anisfeld, Moshe.</creator><contributor>Lambert, W.

The fat cell has been classically described as having a signet ring appearance on histological section due to the peripherally displaced flattened nucleus and the large central vacuole representing the space occupied by fat.

The intellectual stimuli to which he was exposed in Europe undoubtedly contributed greatly to his later effectiveness as chief exponent of Presbyterian doctrines among his own race. Since such of the importance of Andrew Melville lies in the distinctive role he played as mediator in the struggle between the interests of church and state in Scotland, one can obtain little understanding of his policies without some knowledge of his ecclesiastical and political background. It was Melville’s attachment to specific principles advocated by his forerunners which ultimately found expression in the character of the Scottish Church.</description><creator>Anderson, Frederic.

This method was applied at 500 mb, 100 mb and 25 mb for five-day intervals from October 5, 1959 through March 28, 1960. A comparison of stratospheric warmings of this period with those of the previous year studied by Boville (1961), revealed that the heat transport could be accomplished mainly by wave numbers one and/or two. From 500-mb, 100-mb and 25-mb time-sections of northward heat transport, divergences were determined to calculate the local temperature time derivatives. These derivatives were in turn compared with the actual time-sections of mean temperature. This comparison showed that, due to strong convergence of northward heat transport, the winter stratosphere at high latitudes had a net ascending motion.</description><creator>Anderson, Calvin.

Field work in the area was carried out during the summers of 1959 and 1960. The McGill Carnegie Arctic Institute financed the summer work in 1959. The field work of the summer of 1960 was carried out under the auspices of the Quebec Department of Natural Resources.

The method is applicable to any curved array if the specified pattern and thearray configuration are symmetrical with respect to the reference axis.

Human behaviour in the perceptual task of judging a stimulus to be painful or nonpainful (the threshold defining task) is in part independent of the intensity of the stimulus applied.

The choice of this topic is due in the main to two considerations. First, the writer has observed with concern the social and political ills of our Western Civilization - the disintegrating family life, the individual's disillusion with democracy, his selfish, cynical disregard towards his fellow man, his attitude towards the state of getting the most and giving the least, the slow erosion of values and the prevalent contempt of inspiring ideals.</description><creator>Wagner, Ludwig.

The hijacking of airplanes is not new, however. The earliest cases had political implications as they involved the seizure of Czechoslovakian airplanes by refugees from communist-controlled countries who compelled the pilots to fly to the American zone of West Germany. The series of seizures of Cuban airplanes by political refugees who flew them to the United States were of the same vein. So, allegedly, was the seizure of a DC-8 jetliner by a French Algerian who sought to draw attention to the Algerian problem.</description><creator>Villamin, Maria.

It was found that the anorthosite varieties were irregularly distributed within the area, even within an individual outcrop. All the anorthosite was classified according to Buddington’s classification of anorthosites. Samples were collected upon which detailed petrographic studies were made. These studies included flat stage and universal stage work on the plagioclase, determination of the anorthite content of the plagioclase by means of immersion oils, and identification of the accessory minerals.

Interest in the problem arose during the course of a study of the affects of thalamic damage on avoidance behavior in the rat. The results seemed to indicate that common-sense terms such as "voluntary," "volition," and "will" refer to a real function which is distinct from other higher nervous processes and which can be studied by experimental methods. The presentation begins with a discussion of the problem of the definition of reflexive and voluntary movements. This is followed by what might be termed a natural history of volitional processes in man and a discussion of the neural mechanisms likely to be involved.</description><creator>Vanderwolf, Cornelius.</creator><contributor>Hebb, D.

Energy availability has become increasingly a crucial factor for the economic development of countries. Despite its importance, the International Trade System is not provided with specific rules addressing energy. Within other international regulatory frameworks - such as the Energy Charter Treaty and the European Union, among others – energy is addressed more specifically. This work suggests that the Energy Charter Treaty and the European Union can serve as templates or models for the GATT/WTO, should new energy rules, or a General Agreement on Trade in Energy be negotiated in the future. In the present work, some relevant elements of energy regulation under the Energy Charter Treaty and the European Union are addressed, and their possible application to the GATT/WTO is also discussed. Consequently the GATT/WTO negotiators should consider referring to the EU and ECT regulation of energy and mould new GATT/WTO energy rules form them. </description><description>Cette recherche vise à apporter une contribution au débat sur la relation entre le droit commercial international et le secteur de l'énergie et propose une avancée. L'accès aux ressources énergétiques devient de plus en plus un facteur important pour le développement économique des États. Malgré cette portée, le système commercial international ne prévoit pas de règles spécifiques relatives à l'énergie. En revanche, d'autres systèmes internationaux – tels que, entre autres, le Traité sur la Charte de l'énergie et l'Union européenne – abordent la question de l'énergie directement. Cette recherche suggère que le Traité sur la Charte de l'énergie et l'Union européenne peuvent être utilisés comme modèles pour le GATT/OMC dans l'optique de futures négociations portant sur des nouvelles normes dans le secteur énergétique, voire sur l'adoption d'un Accord général sur le commerce de l'énergie (General Agreement on Trade in Energy). Ainsi, les négociateurs du GATT/OMC devraient envisager de se référer aux bases offertes par les normes du secteur énergétique du Traité sur la Charte de l'énergie et de l'Union européenne pour façonner les nouveaux instruments de réglementation de l'énergie au niveau multilatéral.</description><creator>Soto Naranjo, Davide</creator><contributor>Armand De Mestral (Internal/Supervisor)</contributor><date>2013</date><subject>Social Sciences - Law</subject><title>International trade and energy: possible contributions from outside the WTO</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8p58ph44w.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2v23vx51s</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Faculty of Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:9306t2881</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T19:53:32Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Cette thèse considère que l'entreprise capitaliste contemporain peut être compris en termes politiques indépendants de son association avec les grands systèmes économiques ou politiques au sein duquel il est situé. Vue au travers d'un cadre d'Arendt de la polis athénienne et vita activa - et sa connexion aristotélicienne entre la nécessité et la non-liberté - il devient possible de comprendre l'entreprise dans une telle manière. L'élévation moderne du rôle économique du ménage au niveau de la société - concomitante avec l'émergence de l'État comme l'administration - se traduit par la production sociale plutôt qu'individuelle, de la satisfaction de la nécessité biologique. Ce développement permet de remettre en question les affirmations de Hannah Arendt sur la nature antipolitique de l'ouvrier (animal laborans) et le caractère apolitique de l'ouvrier (homo faber), ce qui pourrait ouvrir la voie à une reprise de l'éligibilité politique pour les citoyens. Cependant, en raison de la hausse du social et de son gigantisme associé, il ne semble pas y avoir un espace proprement politique où des animal laborans et homo faber peut exercer ces capacités politiques. Cette thèse propose qu'un tel espace politique peut effectivement exister, mais dans un endroit peu orthodoxe et inattendu. En regardant vers un modèle de la polis athénienne, qui puise son inspiration dans la pensée de Hannah Arendt, il est ainsi possible de redéfinir l'entreprise économique comme simple soldat polis habitée par des travailleurs-citoyens.</description><description>This thesis considers whether the contemporary capitalist firm can be understood in political terms independent of its association with the broader economic or political systems within which it is located. Viewed through an Arendtian framework of the Athenian polis and vita activa - and its Aristotelean connection between necessity and unfreedom - it becomes possible to understand the firm in such a manner. The modern elevation of the economic role of the household to the level of society - concomitant with the emergence of government as administration - results in the social, rather than individual, production of the satisfaction of biological necessity. This development makes it possible to question Arendt's assertions regarding the antipolitical nature of the labourer (animal laborans) and the apolitical nature of the worker (homo faber), thus opening the way for a resumption of political eligibility for citizens. However, because of the rise of the social and its associated gigantism, there does not seem to be a properly political space where animal laborans and homo faber can exercise these political capacities. This thesis proposes that such a political space can indeed exist, albeit in an unorthodox and unexpected location. By looking to a model of the Athenian polis which draws its inspiration from the thought of Hannah Arendt, it is thus possible to reconceptualize the economic enterprise as a private polis inhabited by worker-citizens.</description><creator>Fleming, Cameron</creator><contributor>William Roberts (Internal/Supervisor)</contributor><date>2013</date><subject>Political Science - General</subject><title>Vita activa and the nature of economic enterprises: a political theory of the firm</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6q182p67q.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9306t2881</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Political Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:jm214s75n</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T19:53:32Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>During the Arab Spring effected governments in the Middle East Northern Africa sought to jam satellite transmissions from news agencies carrying news and information of the uprisings into their respective territories.  The news agencies pushed back and in addition jumping satellites and changing signals, some of these agencies reported that such jamming was a violation of international law.  As a result of these claims, the first part of this thesis explores the intentional harmful interfere with transnational radio and satellite broadcasting, those States most impacted by jamming, and the legal justifications that a State may assert in order to jam a radio or satellite transmission.  The second portion of the thesis is devoted to exploring those areas of international law that support a State sending a satellite transmission to another State without first obtaining the receiving State's consent.  This portion of the thesis explores Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, its status as a binding obligation upon all States, and the role it plays in providing legal support for foreign broadcasting conducted by the United States.  The final section of this thesis looks at the application of Article 19 to the People's Republic of China and the Islamic Republic of Iran in an effort to demonstrate the potential negative impact that economic and political factors may have on its application.</description><description>Pendant le Printemps Arabe, les gouvernements les plus touchés en Proche Orient et en Afrique du Nord essayaient de bloquer la diffusion satellitaire transmettant les actualités concernant la révolte et le soulèvement sur leurs territoires.  Les agences de presse étrangères se sont manifestement déclarées rétives contre ce blocage illégal, considéré comme une violation à la loi internationale et par conséquent, elles se sont acharnées a débloquer cette situation et a tenter de procéder a la transmission satellitaire des informations et de médiatiser ce qui se passaient a l'intérieur de ces pays.  En observant cette protestation, cette thèse se propose d'y effectuer une recherche dont la première partie est consacrée à l'enquête sur : une interférence nuisible intentionnelle aux émissions satellitaire et radiophonique; les états étant les plus touchés; et le soutien légal permettant aux états de bloquer la diffusion des émissions.  La deuxième partie de cette thèse concerne les lois internationales autorisant un État à émettre une émission par la voie de satellite vers un autre pays sans que la permission de ce dernier soit requise.  Cette partie de thèses visera à enquêter sur Article 19 de la Déclaration d'Homme Universel, en tant qu'une loi obligatoire étant compétente de jouer le rôle d'un appui soutenant la diffusion des émissions émises de l'extérieur des États-Unis.  En fin la dernière partie se penchera sur l'application de l'Article 19 à la République Populaire de la Chine ainsi qu'à la République Islamique d'Iran afin de démontrer la réalité selon laquelle, d'autres facteurs devraient être pris en considération à savoir économiques et politiques, à l'application de l'Article 19 de la Déclaration d'Homme Universel.  </description><creator>Eytalis, Zachary</creator><contributor>Ram S Jakhu (Internal/Supervisor)</contributor><date>2013</date><subject>Social Sciences - Law</subject><title>International law and the intentional harmful interference with communication satellites</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v118rh949.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/jm214s75n</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Air and Space Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:d791sk80c</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T19:53:33Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis highlights how the indigenous people (Jummas) in the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT), Bangladesh survived with their distinct identity despite land and resource alienation over a century. This survival makes the CHT a field of legal pluralism, where the Jumma land title and community ownership has retained space competing with state imposed discriminatory laws. I argue that the state law regime in the CHT is based on the hegemony of Bangalee nationalism rather than legal pluralism. The ineffectiveness of the Land Dispute Resolution Commission for over a decade is directly linked to the non-recognition of legal pluralism and a bias for assimilation. The state is systemically depriving the Jummas from their land and resources and relying on liberalist claim of autonomy and equal worth of citizens for justification. Given the legal and constitutional framework of the country the pluralistic claims of the Jummas for control over land and resources are always weighed against these principles. Therefore, the study assesses what the state has to offer for legal pluralism operating within a liberal framework. By analyzing different tenets of liberalism the study concludes that liberalism can at best offer a lesser form of legal pluralism; as it avoids recognition of collective rights at any cost. Collective rights are central to the Jumma land tenure and identity. Therefore, the thesis does not suggest any definitive steps for placing Jumma land rights within the liberal framework. Rather it stresses for a dialogue between the two separate national identities and legal traditions in the context of historical deprivation of the Jummas. </description><description>Cette thèse souligne la façon dont la communauté indigène (Jumma) dans les monts de Chittagong (Chittagong Hill Tracts – CHT), au Bangladesh, a maintenu une identité distincte malgré l'aliénation des terres et des ressources de ses membres durant plus d'un siècle. La survie de cette identité fait des CHT un champ de pluralisme juridique, où le titre foncier et la propriété communautaire jumma ont conservé un espace qui est en concurrence avec des lois discriminatoires imposées par l'État. J'argumente que le régime législatif de l'État appliqué dans les CHT est fondé sur l'hégémonie du nationalisme bangladais plutôt que sur le pluralisme juridique.  L'inefficacité de la Commission des règlements des différends territoriaux, en anglais (LDRC) est directement liée à la non-reconnaissance du pluralisme juridique et à une tendance à l'assimilation, durant plus d'une décennie. De façon systémique, l'État prive les Jumma  de leurs terres et ressources sous prétexte d'instaurer l'autonomie et l'égalité du droit selon l'idéologie libéraliste. Compte tenu du cadre législatif et constitutionnel du pays, les revendications pluralistes des Jumma pour le contrôle de leurs terres et ressources sont toujours soupesées contre ces principes. Ainsi, cette étude évalue ce que l'État peut offrir pour que le pluralisme juridique opère dans un cadre libéral. Par l'analyse des différents principes du libéralisme, cette étude conclut que le libéralisme peut, tout au mieux, offrir une forme atténuée de pluralisme juridique, comme elle évite la reconnaissance des droits collectifs à n'importe que prix.  Les droits collectifs sont au cœur de l'occupation des terres et de l'identité des Jumma. Ainsi, cette thèse ne suggère aucune mesure définitive pour inclure les droits fonciers de Jumma dans le cadre libéral. En revanche, elle insiste sur la nécessité d'un dialogue entre les deux identités nationales distinctes et les traditions juridiques dans le contexte de privation historique des Jumma.</description><creator>Chowdhury, Rokeya</creator><contributor>Evan Fox-Decent (Internal/Supervisor)</contributor><date>2013</date><subject>Social Sciences - Law</subject><title>Land dispute resolution in the Chittagong Hill Tracts: caught between liberalism and legal pluralism</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/x633f482m.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/d791sk80c</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Faculty of Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><resumptionToken completeListSize="47894">oai_etdms.s(Collection:theses).f(2019-10-16T06:03:34Z).u(2020-07-23T18:55:55Z).t(47894):15800</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>
