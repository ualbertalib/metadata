Ces dualités sont tout à fait dans l'esprit des dualités classiques de type Stone. Dans un document récent de Hundt et al. cela a été étudié dans le cadre des automates probabilistes équipés d'une notion d'observation. Leur motivation a été de comprendre comment raisonner sur les systèmes avec des états cachés. Il s'est avéré difficile de formaliser cela correctement en utilisant la théorie des catégories, et la notion intuitive de la dualité qui a été présenté ne semblent pas bien correspondre à ce qui était attendu. Nous étudions cette dualité coalgébriquement. à cette fin, nous passons en revue les coalgèbres et nous regardons les automates comme coalgèbres pour un foncteur. Cela fournit un moyen naturel de considérer les catégories d'automates. Nous donnons une construction alternative de l'automate Kripke final de Cordy, qui nous permet de faire la connexion à la dualité. Nous montrons que la construction de la dualité de Hundt et al. est en fait une construction de finalité, et démontrons une correspondance analogue dans la cas probabiliste.</description><description>Duality theory is an important topic within automata theory which leads to a tight relationship between automata and modal logics.  These dualities are very much in the spirit of the classical Stone type dualities.  In a recent paper by Hundt et al. this was explored in the context of probabilistic automata equipped with a notion of observations.  The motivation there was to understand how to reason about systems with hidden state.  It turned out to be problematic to formalise this properly in categorical terms and the intuitive notion of duality presented there did not seem to correspond well with what was expected. We study this putative duality coalgebraically. Towards this, we review coalgebras and view automata as coalgebras for a functor. This provides a natural way to consider categories of automata. We give an alternative construction of the final Kripke automaton of Cordy, which allows us to make the connection to duality. We show that the duality construction of Hundt et al. is in fact a finality construction, and demonstrate an analogous correspondence in the probabilistic case.</description><creator>Al Marhubi, Kamal Amran</creator><contributor>Prakash Panangaden (Internal/Supervisor)</contributor><date>2010</date><subject>Applied Sciences - Computer Science</subject><title>Duality and finality for deterministic and probabilistic automata</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/k930bx633.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5t34sk073</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:m326m2168</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:29:57Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The E4orf4 protein of human adenovirus kills transformed cancer  cell lines by a p53-independent mechanism. Accumulating evidence suggests that the  mechanism of E4orf4-induced death is distinct from apoptosis and occurs via some  novel pathway. Previous studies have shown that E4orf4 can interact with the  mammalian Balpha subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and that this interaction  is important for E4orf4-induced cell death. As PP2A is highly conserved across  eukaryotic species we chose to study the effects of E4orf4 in a genetically  tractable organism, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, in an effort to elucidate the  mechanism of E4orf4-mediated cell death. E4orf4 expression is lethal in yeast cells  and this toxicity is dependent on E4orf4 having a functional interaction with Cdc55,  the yeast homolog of Balpha. Through its interaction with the B regulatory subunit,  which determines substrate specificity, E4orf4 may inhibit or promote the  dephosphorylation of selected PP2A substrates. E4orf4 expression can induce high levels Clb2-Cdc28 activity and  mitotic arrest in a Cdc55-dependent manner. Since E4orf4 targets only the  Cdc55-containing pool of PP2A, the E4orf4-induced mitotic arrest suggests that  PP2A-Cdc55 plays a direct role in regulating exit from mitosis. Two  anaphase-promoting complexes (APCs) control mitotic exit, APCCdc20 and APCHct1. We  find that E4orf4 induces premature APCCdc20 activity resulting in the premature  degradation of Pds1 and Scc1 in a Cdc55-dependent manner. In contrast, E4orf4 did  not induce APCHct1 as evidenced be the stability of its substrates, Cdc20, Clb2 and  Cdc5 as well as the hyperphosphorylation of Hct1. E4orf4 prevents Cdc55-containing  PP2A complexes from localizing normally, another mechanism by which E4orf4 may  modulate PP2A activity towards substrates. We propose that E4orf4 promotes mitotic  arrest by acting as a Cdc55-specific inhibitor of PP2A and that PP2A plays a role in  controlling the timing of anaphase by regulating APCCdc20 activity.</description><creator>Roopchand, Diana Elizabeth</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Chemistry, Biochemistry.</subject><title>Human adenovirus E4orf4 protein induces premature mitotic arrest by a PP2A-dependent mechanism leading to cell death in Saccharomyces cerevisiae</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kw52j8555.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/m326m2168</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biochemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:0g354f701</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:29:57Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Hazardous Materials are potentially harmful to people and  environment due to their toxic ingredients. Although a significant portion of  dangerous goods transportation is via railroads, prevailing studies on dangerous  goods transport focus on highway shipments. We present an analytical framework that  incorporates the differentiating features of trains in the assessment of risk. Each  railcar is a potential source of release, and hence risk assessment of trains  requires representation of multiple release sources in the model. We report on the  use of the proposed approach for the risk assessment of the Ultra-train that passes  through the city of Montreal everyday. The risk assessment methodology is then used  to model the operations of freight trains in a network, wherein freight involves  both hazardous and regular cargo. We present an optimization model distinct from the  conventional ones, a Memetic Algorithm based solution technique, and a number of  scenarios intended to gain numerical and managerial insights into the problem. In an  effort to combine the economies of trains and efficiencies of trucks, we deal with  rail-truck intermodalism for hazardous and non-hazardous cargo. Two special cases  and a general case of rail-truck intermodal transportation models, driven by the  element of ' time', are presented.</description><creator>Verma, Manish</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Containerization.</subject><subject>Hazardous substances -- Transportation -- Canada.</subject><subject>Containerization -- Canada.</subject><subject>Hazardous substances -- Transportation.</subject><title>Analytical approaches to railroad and rail-truck intermodal transportation of hazardous materials</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/fj236250t.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0g354f701</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Faculty of Management</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:8s45q940d</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:29:58Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Pluralism, the variety of philosophical, moral, cultural and  religious worldviews of contemporary society, is a characteristic of Western  democracies. This places upon such societies a great challenge for the teaching of  moral principles in schools and for the establishment of such principles in the  public sphere. John Rawls's political idea of an overlapping consensus is a  principle of decision-making that can be used as a model for arriving at principles  for moral education and also as a model for moral deliberation in the public domain.  Multicultural narratives can play an important role in enhancing the creation of an  overlapping consensus on public moral issues in pluralistic societies. They can be  examples of the kinds of challenges involved in the moral decision process and also  serve to illustrate the importance of moral perception as a complement to moral  reflection in the task of moral deliberation. Teaching the multicultural nature of  modern civilization and also the universal incidence of the democratic council  tradition can strengthen citizens' sense of mutual respect in the course of public  speech. This can help to develop a culture that is more open to the formation of an  overlapping consensus on matters that concern public morality.</description><creator>Welch, Thomas A.</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Moral education</subject><subject>Cultural pluralism.</subject><title>Overlapping consensus : a model for moral education and moral deliberation in pluralistic societies</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/x059c796v.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8s45q940d</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Integrated Studies in Education</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:c821gk295</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:29:58Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The emission of trace metals (TMs) into boreal forest regions of  the northern hemisphere is an important environmental issue due to their potential  detrimental impacts on these sensitive ecosystems. One of the foremost factors  controlling metal cycling is the chemistry of the overlying organic forest floor of  the forest soil. In this thesis we examine the chemistry of forest floor horizons of  podzolic soils. Our goal is to improve our ability to predict the partitioning of  metals between the soil solid and solution phases. We developed a standard protocol to produce solutions that  resemble lysimeter solutions from podzolic soils using air-dried samples. We  hypothesized that the stabilization point of the electrical conductivity (EC) of the  soil solution is indicative of the point in which soluble salts and organic material  precipitated during sampling and storage are removed from the soil particle  surfaces. Solutions produced by leaching the soils, once the EC of wash solutions  had stabilized, were comparable to lysimeter solutions from the area where samples  were collected with respect to the concentrations of divalent cations, pH, EC and  dissolved organic carbon (DOC). The applicability of this procedure to trace metal  partitioning in forest floors was explored. Laboratory extractions produced  partition coefficients (log Kd) similar to observed lysimeter solutions ranging from  3.4 to 3.9 for Cd, 3.4 to 3.9 for Cu, 3.4 to 4.1 for Ni, 4.1 to 5.2 for Pb and 3.2  to 3.5 for Zn. According to a semi-mechanistic regression model based on observed  lysimeter concentrations, the metal concentrations in solution were appropriate  relative to known factors that influence metal partitioning in soils: pH, the  concentrations of total metals and DOC. While chemical characteristics of soils have been consistently  observed to play important roles in the partitioning and toxicity of metals we  wished to place the importance of the chemical characteristics of soil on mobility  and toxicity in context. We interpreted field data that had been collected from  transects established with distance from two point source emitters in Rouyn PQ, and  Sudbury ON. Canada find developed equations that predict dissolved metal  concentrations from total metal concentrations, soil pH, soil organic matter (SOM),  and DOC contents. We integrated these equations into a simple box model that  calculates changes in the concentration of metals in the organic and upper mineral  horizons and includes a loop for vegetative return of metals to the forest floor.</description><creator>MacDonald, James Douglas</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Soils -- Heavy metal content -- Canada</subject><subject>Mineral industries -- Environmental aspects -- Canada</subject><subject>Forest soils -- Canada.</subject><subject>Soils -- Trace element content -- Canada</subject><title>The partitioning of Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn between the solid and solution phase of forest floor horizons in podzolic soils near metal smelters /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rx913q38g.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/c821gk295</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Natural Resource Sciences</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:76537171z</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:29:59Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>While studies in the social sciences have looked at lesbian,  gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) youth, few have focused on how they experience  school. Sexual orientation is still a taboo subject or only treated cursorily in  educational institutions and teacher-training programmes. Research that does look at  schools is mitigated by subjects who are at different degrees of being out in their  schools, or are treated as a monolith with other LGBT youth, or have been recruited  through psychosocial agencies, and by data gathered retrospectively and/or at  arms-length through surveys. This dissertation describes the experience of being gay and out  at school for seven male students aged sixteen to eighteen. Data was collected  through multiple semistructured interviews with participants recruited through the  various urban, suburban, and alternative high schools they attended at the time of  this study. Data was analyzed using a modification of the  Stevick-Colaizzi-Keen method of analyzing phenomenological data (Moustakas, 1994).  The theoretical framework undergirding this study is phenomenological research,  arts-based research, and queer theory in education. Findings are represented as a  literary novel in order to better preserve participants' voices. Data analysis indicates that the experience of being out in high  school is characterized by: (a) managing "the secret" of being gay before  and during coming out; (b) seeing being gay as just being yourself; (c) perceiving  the school as privately supportive, but publicly indifferent to gay students; (d)  emotionally reflecting the school environment; (e) valuing relationships as a  positive; (f) seeing harassment, gossip, and gender differences as negatives; (g)  ascribing to perpetrators of homophobia and harassment character flaws and  anachronistic beliefs; (h) being left on your own to deal with homophobia and  harassment as others abdicate their responsibilities; (i) employing escapist,  self-protection, and resistance strategies to deal with homophobia and harassment;  (j) searching for connectivity to other gays and the LGBT community; (k) facing the  silence of information and resources in schools on LGBT issues and people; and (l)  advising others to be true to themselves. This research has implications for teachers, administrators,  policy-makers, and those involved in teacher education programmes who are interested  in addressing the needs of gay students.</description><creator>Whatling, Michael</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Homophobia.</subject><subject>High school students -- Attitudes.</subject><subject>Gay students.</subject><title>Joseph Rose died for our sins : stories of the experience of being out in high school</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9g54xj15x.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/76537171z</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Integrated Studies in Education</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:tx31qj15p</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:29:59Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Virus infection of a mammalian host initiates a set of rapid and  coordinated cellular events designed to limit and ultimately eradicate pathogen  replication and spread. Development of an efficient anti-viral response is dependent  upon communication between pathogen-susceptible cells at the site of infection and  the immune effectors. In response to cellular detection of a viral threat,  communication is achieved through production and secretion of secondary protein  messengers called cytokines. Interferons (IFN) are cytokines that are crucial to the  establishment of anti-viral immunity; type I IFNs secreted by virus-infected cells  activate the innate immune machinery, modulate adaptive immune responses, promote  apoptosis of infected cells and induce an anti-viral genetic program in uninfected  cells. Extensive study of type I IFN gene regulation has yielded information on the  nature of cellular responses elicited by viral pathogens: signaling events initiated  by the cell to eliminate the virus as well as counter-measures initiated by the  virus to appropriate anti-viral signaling or inhibit it altogether. Transcription of  the type I IFN genes requires activation of multiple transcription factors,  including Nuclear Factor kappa B (NF-kappaB), Activating Protein-1 (AP-1) and the  Interferon Regulatory Factors (IRFs). While signaling pathways leading to NF-kappaB  and AP-1 activation are relatively well characterized, regulation of IRF activity  represents a critical missing link in the understanding of immune signaling. This  study provides a mechanistic analysis of two IRF-related signaling pathways that are  triggered in response to virus infection. First, chronic activation of the irf4 gene  in T-cells infected with Human T-cell Leukemia Virus-I (HTLV-I), an event that is  associated with leukemic development, is induced by viral appropriation of NF-kappaB  signaling through the classical regulatory IkappaB kinases (IKK).

Besides their role in-planta, they are also rhizosecreted by  root cells. Germinating soybean seeds exude large quantities of jasmonic acid;  however there is no knowledge regarding how jasmonates influence cells of the  soybean symbiont, Bradyrhizobium japonicum, in the rhizosphere. We studied the role  of jasmonates in the soybean-Bradyrhizobium symbiosis. Bradyrhizobium japonicum  cultures were induced with jasmonates and the resulting Nod factors were isolated  and purified. Our results showed that JA and MeJA strongly induced the production of  Nod factors by the tested B. japonicum strains. When added together, genistein and  jasmonates resulted in greater LCO production than either one alone. Jasmonic acid  is produced from linoleic and linolenic acids via the octadecanoid pathway; we  studied the effect of these two fatty acids on B. japonicum nod gene induction.  Interestingly both linoleic and linolenic acids induced the nod genes and caused LCO  production by B. japonicum cultures. Since jasmonates induced the nod genes and also  caused LCO production in B. japonicum, I conducted experiments in the greenhouse and  field to determine whether incubation of B. japonicum with JA or MeJA prior to  inoculation increases soybean nodulation variables and grain yield. Both genistein  and McJA increased nodule number and nodule dry weight per plant. Due to enhanced  nitrogen fixation, attributed to increased nodule number and weight, soybean dry  matter accumulation and grain yield were increased. These results document the  discovery of jasmonates and their precursors as new signal molecules in the  Bradyrhizobium - soybean nitrogen fixing symbiosis.</description><creator>Mabood, Fazli</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Plant cellular signal transduction.</subject><subject>Mycorrhizas.</subject><subject>Jasmonic acid</subject><subject>Rhizobium japonicum.</subject><subject>Soybean -- Roots.</subject><subject>Root-tubercles.</subject><title>Jasmonates as a new class of signaling molecules in Bradyrhizobium-soybean symbiosis</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qz20st00s.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gh93gz98f</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Plant Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:x059c7974</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:30:00Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Maintaining appropriate patterns of gene expression in the  gametes and during early embryogenesis is essential for normal development. DNA  methylation is an epigenetic means of regulating gene expression and is an important  molecular mark regulating the sex-specific expression of genes subject to genomic  imprinting. Imprinted genes are expressed from only one of two inherited chromosomes  and are differentially marked during gametogenesis to allow for their parental  allele specific expression. These genes affect embryo growth, placental function,  behavior after birth and are implicated in the etiology of a number of human  diseases. The primary objective of this thesis was to gain a better understanding of  the developmental dynamics and origins of DNA methylation profiles regulating  maternally methylated imprinted genes during mouse oocyte development. Studies  revealed that maternally methylated imprinted genes acquire methylation within their  DMRs during postnatal oocyte growth and that this acquisition occurs in a gene and  allele specific manner. It was also observed that maternal methylation imprint  acquisition is related to oocyte diameter and that a repetitive parasitic element  also acquires methylation during this period. DNA methylation is catalyzed by DNMTs  and investigations into the developmental expression profiles of Dnmt3a, Dnmt3b and  Dnmt3L indicated that transcript accumulation of these enzymes during oocyte  development coincided with the timing of maternal methylation imprint establishment.  Moreover, expression analysis in DNMT-depleted oocytes suggested these enzymes to be  coordinately regulated. Additional studies aimed at developing another model of  oocyte imprinting lead to the identification and characterization of a putative  bovine Snrpn DMR. Its DNA methylation profile was found to be conserved with that of  mouse and human.

Whereas recent studies have interpreted the poem  as an agent of spiritual change, this study will examine the Heliand as an agent of  social and political change. The basis of this study will be the text itself, with  consideration of its main source, the Diatessaron. The approach will not only be  textual in nature, but historical as well. The first order of the study will be to  place the poem in its proper historical and cultural context. This will generate two  possible contexts, as current scholarship is divided over the date of composition.  This study will discuss both dates, but will select only one with which to continue.  Following this, the study will examine the medium of epic and its influence on the  poem. Here, significant motifs and elements of the epic will be outlined, discussed  and applied to the text. In addition, this study will analyze significant figures of  the poem, such as Jesus Christ, the apostles, King Herod, and Pontius Pilate. The  study will also examine significant episodes of the poem, such as the birth and  execution of Christ, Christ's battle with Satan in the forest, and the elimination  of John the Baptist. Through examples from the text, the study will also demonstrate  the poet's ability to reconcile pre-Christian concepts of spirituality with  Christian Scripture, Germanic notions of power and authority with those of the  Franks, and the social status of the Saxon as subjects of Frankish rule. In all, the  study will demonstrate how the Heliand marks confluence of varying and conflicting  notions of social order into a seamless reorganization of society.</description><creator>Zurla, Cynthia</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Franks</subject><subject>Saxons</subject><title>Medium and message : the confluence of Saxon and Frankish values as portrayed in the Old Saxon Heliand</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ft848r02z.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/nk322d79d</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of German Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:w3763734f</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:30:01Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Text categorization (TC) is the task of automatically  categorizing textual digital documents into pre-set categories by analyzing their  contents. The purpose of this study is to develop an effective TC model to resolve  the difficulty of automatic classification. In this study, two primary goals are  intended. First, a Hidden Markov Model (HAM is proposed as a relatively new method  for text categorization. HMM has been applied to a wide range of applications in  text processing such as text segmentation and event tracking, information retrieval,  and information extraction. Few, however, have applied HMM to TC. Second, the  Library of Congress Classification (LCC) is adopted as a classification scheme for  the HMM-based TC model for categorizing digital documents. LCC has been used only in  a handful of experiments for the purpose of automatic classification. In the  proposed framework, a general prototype for an HMM-based TC model is designed, and  an experimental model based on the prototype is implemented so as to categorize  digitalized documents into LCC. A sample of abstracts from the ProQuest Digital  Dissertations database is used for the test-base. Dissertation abstracts, which are  pre-classified by professional librarians, form an ideal test-base for evaluating  the proposed model of automatic TC. For comparative purposes, a Naive Bayesian  model, which has been extensively used in TC applications, is also implemented. Our  experimental results show that the performance of our model surpasses that of the  Naive Bayesian model as measured by comparing the automatic classification of  abstracts to the manual classification performed by professionals.</description><creator>Yi, Kwan, 1963-</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Markov processes.</subject><subject>Classification -- Automation</subject><title>Text classification using a hidden Markov model</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/g732d9463.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/w3763734f</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Graduate School of Library and Information Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:05741s27z</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:30:01Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The numerical solution of partial differential equations and  boundary value problems is one of the most important tools of modern science. For  various reasons (parellelizing, improving condition numbers, finding good  preconditioners, etc...) it is desirable to turn a boundary value problem over a  large domain O into a set of boundary value problems over domains O1,...,O n such  that ∪kO k; this is the domain decomposition method. The solutions u1,...,un  of the local problems rarely glue together into a solution u of the global problem,  hence we must use an iteration whereby we repeatedly solve the local problems.  Between each iteration, some information is exchanged between the subdomains, so  that the local solutions at the next iteration better approximate the global  solution. The method of Schwarz exchanges Dirichlet data along subdomain boundaries,  but other methods exist. We recall a construction of nonlocal operators that lead to  iterations that converge in 2d + 1 steps, where d is the diameter of the  connectivity graph of the domain decomposition, if this graph is a tree. We discuss  a graph algorithm linked to these operators in the general case. For the Laplacian  on the sphere, we also give local approximations to these optimal nonlocal  operators. We also discuss its application for solving the shallow water equations  on the sphere as a model for numerical weather prediction.</description><creator>Loisel, Sébastien</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Mathematics.</subject><title>Optimal and optimized domain decomposition methods on the sphere</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/w66344146.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/05741s27z</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mathematics and Statistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:cj82k774r</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:30:02Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The term polymer brush refers to the class of structures formed  by polymers when attached to a surface at sufficiently high surface density so as to  cause the polymers to stretch away from the surface to avoid each other. Considering  specifically brushes formed by flexible, linear homopolymers attached by a single  end to an impenetrable planar surface, this thesis investigates the stability of the  laterally homogeneous phase of the brush in response to fluctuations of polymer  density. The controlling factors studied are: the energetic interactions of the  polymers with the bath of solvent particles in which the brush is immersed; the  excluded volume of the polymers, which results from the mutual repulsion that exists  between any two polymer segments; and the polymeric content in the brush, controlled  by the grafting density and the length of the polymers. It is found that the  stability of the laterally homogeneous phase of the brush is enhanced by increasing  the polymer excluded volume, the polymeric content in the brush, or both. When  incompressibility is modeled at the mean field level, it is found that there exists  a region of parameter space in which the laterally homogeneous phase is stable for  all values of the polymer-solvent interaction.</description><creator>Roderick, Christopher</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Physics, Molecular.</subject><title>Stability analysis of polymer brushes</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/hd76s064d.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cj82k774r</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Physics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:6108vb827</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:30:02Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The purpose of this dissertation is to investigate the influence  of a component of the service environment, namely music, on consumers' judgments and  behaviors. More specifically, we were interested in the underlying mechanisms of  pleasure effects. We proposed, based on theories from psychological environment and  scene perception, that the pleasure induced by background music first influences the  overall attractiveness of the service atmosphere, which in turn, has the ability to  influence the attractiveness of the persons found in this environment, specifically  the service personnel. Finally, these two dimensions of the service environment  (i.e., the atmosphere and the personnel) are antecedents of consumers' judgments and  behaviors. The first study was designed to recreate, in a three-minute  video-based scenario, a segment of a banking service experience. The video was  filmed so to mimic the viewpoint of an actual customer waiting to be served. Three  pre-tested background music selections were added as part of the ambient soundtrack.  One hundred and fifty-three participants were thus exposed to music high to low in  liking and were subsequently asked to complete a self-administered questionnaire.  The questionnaire was designed to assess participants' perception of the service  environment, of the personnel, and of the overall service quality. Results showed  that music-induced pleasure has a positive influence on the perception of the  atmosphere, which was found to impact the perception of the personnel and together  these two perceptual dimensions (atmosphere and personnel) were both found to impact  overall quality perceptions. The second study was designed to recreate as faithfully as  possible an actual service experience in the controlled environment of the  laboratory. One hundred and seventy-three participants were asked to browse an  Internet catalog of house and kitchen gadgets and were asked to find a product that  they would want to give to their best friend. After making a preliminary choice,  they were guided to participate in an online chat session with a consultant. On a  between-subject basis, participants were exposed during the browsing and chatting  portions to two different lounge music selections that were pre-tested to provide  two levels of pleasure---high and moderate. A control condition with no ambient  music was also used. To assess the impact of different modes of perceptions, the  music was delivered either through speakers hidden in the room or through speakers  connected to the computer. This second study confirmed the positive impact of  music-induced pleasure on the perception of the environment and of the personnel and  their mediating role on the perception of the company and on future behavior. This  study also revealed some of the negative consequences of lesser-liked ambient music,  especially in consumption contexts where it can be the focus of customers'  attention. The results point to the complexity of music as an atmospheric  stimulus and the difficulty of manipulating it for commercial purposes. The results  should be useful to managers and designers who must engineer the various elements of  the service environment.</description><creator>Morin, Sylvie</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Environmental music.</subject><subject>Consumer behavior.</subject><title>Influence du plaisir induit par la musique sur les jugements et comportements d'approche des consommateurs</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8910jv11f.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6108vb827</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Faculty of Management</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:rf55z827r</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:30:02Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Among the various fungal strains screened for citric acid  production, Aspergillus niger is known to produce considerable amounts of citric  acid and other organic acids when cultivated in carbohydrate-rich medium in solid  substrate fermentation (SSF). Since A. niger on a solid substrate grows under  conditions similar to the natural habitat, SSF is ideal to cultivate A. niger for  the purpose of producing citric acid. An initial optimization (study 1) was conducted in batch type  fermentation experiments using peat moss supplemented with glucose to simulate an  organic waste. The effects of various nutrients (glucose, (NH4)2SO 4, KH2PO4 and  NaCl), fermentation parameters (moisture content, temperature, inoculum density,  composition of solid substrate and particle size) and of initial level of potential  stimulators (ethanol, methanol, phytate and surfactant) were evaluated with respect  to citric acid production by A. niger grown on damp peat moss. In these experiments,  optimization using a traditional 'one-factor-at-a-time' method was applied to  determine key factor ranges for the production of citric acid. When the fermentation  was carried out using the final optimal conditions. This allowed for a 50-fold  increase in citric acid production compared to the production of citric acid by A.  niger grown on peat moss supplemented with 100 g glucose/kg DPM. A second set of experiments (study 2) was conducted to optimize  fermentation conditions for citric acid production in a column bioreactor. A. niger  NRRL 567 grown on damp peat moss was held within a column bioreactor and  periodically irrigated with a glucose-rich solution simulating field conditions.  Three variables including aeration, thickness of solid substrate bed and incubation  temperature were optimized using a 23 full factorial design (FFD). Under optimum,  the total citric acid production and yield were 120.6 g/kg DPM and 18.5%  respectively. A third experiment (study 3) compared the production of citric  acid by A. niger in submerged fermentation using cheese whey, as opposed to batch  and semi-continuous fermentation using peat moss. Various fermentation conditions  such as nutrients (glucose, (NH4)2SO 4 and KH2PO4), stimulators (methanol, olive oil  and phytate) and fermentation parameters (pH, fermentation time and inoculum  density) were optimized using a central composite design (CCD). Citric acid  production improved citric acid production by a factor of 13.3 when compared to the  production of citric acid by A. niger NRRL 567 using whey-based medium (50 g/l)  alone. As compared to submerged and semi-continuous fermentation, Batch  type SSF could take higher levels of initial glucose and produce the high  concentration of citric acid within a shorter period of time. Thus, SSF may be  considered to be better technique than submerged fermentation, if main disadvantage  like non-homogeneous fermentation conditions could be overcome.</description><creator>Kim, Jin-Woo, 1968-</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Citric acid -- Biotechnology.</subject><subject>Aspergillus niger.</subject><subject>Citric acid -- Synthesis.</subject><title>Optimization of citric acid production by Aspergillus niger : NRRL 567 in various fermentation systems</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kd17ct33w.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rf55z827r</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Bioresource Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:wp988k37v</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:30:03Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>An increasing amount of evidence suggests that both cerebral  hemispheres contribute to the comprehension of semantic relations. A literature  review of language abilities after right hemisphere (RH) damage reveals  abnormalities in the interpretation of lexical items that have alternate meanings  (Chiarello, 1991). Two major theories have been proposed to account for the  lexical-semantic deficits observed in RH damaged (RHD) individuals, namely the  "suppression deficit" and the "coarse semantic coding"  hypotheses. By exploiting the theoretical linguistic distinction of lexical  ambiguity into homonymy, metaphor and metonymy, the present investigation attempts  to directly contrast the predictions of the two hypotheses. To this end, two on-line  priming studies were developed, each comprising two experiments conducted with RHD  patients, individuals with nonfluent aphasia subsequent to left hemisphere damage  (LHD) and non-brain-damaged control participants (NC). The first single-word priming study showed that, for all three  subject groups (NC, LHD, RHD), the multiple meanings of homonymous and metonymous  words can be triggered and accessed out of context, whereas for metaphorical words,  context seems to be necessary in order to access secondary metaphorical meanings.  The second sentence priming study showed that the RHD patients' performance  contrasts with the performance of the normal control and LHD non-fluent aphasic  subjects who showed both effects of context and the time-course of processing, as  well as comparable processing across the three types of ambiguous words. For the RHD  patients, although homonymous and metonymous words showed relatively normal patterns  of activation, the subordinate meanings of metaphors were not activated, suggesting  a selective problem with figurative meanings. Taken together, these findings suggest that the lexical  ambiguity processing deficit observed after RH damage is mostly evident when  processing subordinate meanings of metaphorically ambiguous words (even in the  presence of biasing context), although a lesion in one hemisphere does not  completely disrupt the ability of individuals to appreciate the alternative meanings  of ambiguous words at the single-word level. The findings were contrary to the  strongest expectations of both the "coarse semantic coding" and the  "suppression deficit" hypotheses of RH language abilities; however, they  seem to be more consistent with a weaker version of the "suppression  deficit" hypothesis according to which RH damage leads to deficits in  contextual integration and selection of appropriate meanings.</description><creator>Klepousniotou, Ekaterini</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Health Sciences, Speech Pathology.</subject><title>On the resolution of lexical ambiguity : unilateral brain damage effects on the processing of homonymy and polysemy</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6m311p83z.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/wp988k37v</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Communication Sciences and Disorders</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:5m60qs42x</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:30:03Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>High temperature ultrasonic transducers (HTUTs) have been  developed for non-destructive evaluation (NDE) of metals and on-line monitoring of  industrial polymer processes at elevated temperatures. Developed HTUTs are two  types; one is sol gel sprayed HTUTs and the other is a crystal of high Curie  temperature permanently bonded onto a steel substrate by brazing or diffusion  bonding. In sol gel method, piezoelectric powders were dispersed into sol gel  precursor. Sol gel precursor of Al2O3, PZT or BIT, serves as adhesion material  between powders, LT, PZT or BIT and a substrate to be coated. Spray technique was  used so that thick films could be fabricated even onto curved or large surfaces. The  composite material, BIT/PZT, derived from bismuth titanate (BIT) powders and lead  zirconate titanate (PZT) sol gel precursor had presented excellent characteristics,  such as high signal-to-noise ratio, broadband frequency, and acceptable signal  strength up to more than 450°C. The film properties such as dielectric  constant, piezoelectric constant, density and electromechanical coupling coefficient  were characterized. Nondestructive testing of extent of sub-surface defect using  BIT/PZT film HTUT was given at 440°C. High temperature immersion type HT ultrasonic probes using  BIT/PZT film were also fabricated. They were immersed in molten zinc at  450°C, and able to measure the thickness of the steel sample. Surface and  sub-surface imaging with fine resolution were obtained using this HT ultrasonic  probe with a focused lens in silicone oil at 200°C. On-line monitoring of industrial polymer processes had been  performed. Sol gel HTUTs had been fabricated on a steel extruder adaptor of a  polymer extruder machine, mold inserts of an injection machine and a micro-molding  machine, and a barrel of the micro-molding machine. Ultrasonic signals were obtained  at the elevated temperatures. The capability for monitoring the barrel wear and  screw status during polymer extrusion at 190°C and the filling completion  conditions for injection molding at 120°C and micromolding processes up to  200°C have been shown. Brazing and diffusion bonding had been tried to establish  permanent acoustic bonding between a lithium niobate crystal and a steel substrate.  The HTUT fabricated by brazing technique had demonstrated broadband characteristics  up to 460°C. The HTUT made by diffusion bonding technique had also  demonstrated broadband characteristics up to 350°C. This latter HTUT had 20  dB higher signal strength than that of the sol gel BIT/PZT thick film  HTUTs.</description><creator>Kobayashi, Makiko</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>Development and applications of high temperature piezoelectric ultrasonic transducers</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/q524jp16m.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5m60qs42x</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:db78tc50j</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:30:04Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This study examined three areas related to attention in primary  school-aged children to answer the following questions: Are there a distinct  neuropsychological differences for young children referred by teachers as lacking in  attention compared to those not lacking in attention? Are there advantages to using  neuropsychological measures of attention over behaviour rating scales and  observations in preschool or early grade school population? Can these same  neuropsychological tools evaluate the effectiveness of music with children that have  attention problems? There were 24 participants in this study, 12 children rated as  having attention problems by their teacher and 12 children in the control group.  Participants age ranged from 5 years 0 months to 6 years 11 months. All the children  were of average intelligence, and were attending an English school or preschool  within the greater Montreal Area. Participants served as their own controls for the  music conditions. Participants were nested within group and order for the four  treatment conditions. Findings indicated that attention difficulties not only affect  behaviour, attention, and inhibition, but also influence cognitive processes in  language, memory, and visual perceptual abilities especially visual motor precision.  Neuropsychological tests were useful in the assessment of children's attention  difficulties and could be used to differentiate attention problems that are strictly  behavioural from those that are more likely the result of neuropsychological  deficits. For children with attention problems environment and music had limited  effects on neuropsychological variables. Rock and roll increased children's ability  to sustain visual attention if they were classified as having an attention problem.  It did not have this effect for children without attention problems. Gross motor  inhibition is also affected by rock and roll, but only for boys who have attention  problems. Higher level interactions with gender were found in overall  neuropsychological functioning and with respect to music. School based interventions  must be based not only on behaviour but also on cognitive deficits; early  intervention is important to this process.</description><creator>Zanni, Caroline A.

This  is attributed to various microalloying elements, which are essential for the  mechanical characteristics of the final products. Thermomechanical processing is a  new approach to alleviate this problem. In this work, two grades of Nb-containing  steel, one modified with B, were examined. In order to simulate the key parameters  of continuous casting, specimens were melted in situ and subjected to thermal  conditions similar to that occurring in a continuous casting mill. They were also  deformed at different stages of the thermal schedule. Finally, the hot ductility was  evaluated at the end of the thermal schedule, corresponding to the straightening  stage in continuous casting at which the hot ductility problem occurs in the  continuous casting process. The results showed that the presence of B is noticeably  beneficial to the hot ductility. Failure mode analysis was performed and the  mechanism of fracture was elaborated. As well, the potential mechanisms under which  B can improve the hot ductility were proposed. Deformation during solidification (i.e. in the liquid + solid  two phase region) led to a significant loss of hot ductility in both steels. By  contrast, deformation in the delta-ferrite region, after solidification, was either  detrimental or beneficial depending on the deformation start  temperature. The hot ductility was considerably improved in the steel without  B when deformation was applied during the delta → gamma transformation. The  effect of such deformation on the other steel grade was not significant. Examination  of the microstructure revealed that such improvement is related to a grain  refinement in austenite. Therefore, the effect of deformation parameters was studied  in detail and the optimum condition leading to the greatest improvement in the hot  ductility was determined. Finally, some solutions to the industrial problem in the  continuous casting process were proposed.</description><creator>Zarandi, Faramarz MH.</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Engineering, Materials Science.</subject><subject>Engineering, Metallurgy.</subject><title>The effect of high temperature deformation on the hot ductility of Nb-microalloyed steel /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/w66344171.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/m039k543x</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mining, Metals and Materials Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:x633f165b</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:30:04Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>It has long been known that Soderberg aluminum smelters are a  large source of anthropogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the environment.  The atmospheric fate of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons is of importance to the  aluminum industry in Canada due to their environmental persistence and potential  health effects. For Soderberg smelters, the fate of facility emissions is of concern  due to the involuntary nature of exposure by the general public in the surrounding  regions. Excellent relationships between benzo[a]pyrene and polycyclic aromatic  hydrocarbons between different types of Soderberg facilities and raw material  formulations were found in the occupational environment during this investigation.  This was followed by the comparison of emission profiles of a horizontal stud  Soderberg aluminum smelter with profiles measured in a network of sampling stations  in the adjacent community. The results suggested that benzo[a]pyrene may be less  stable than the majority of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. An analysis of  different sampling sites across Canada revealed that station profiles in the  vicinity of Soderberg facilities were different from those found for sites impacted  by steel plants, traffic and domestic heating. To explain some of the observed  differences, it was hypothesized that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons on  particulate matter approach a relatively stable profile that is based on the  particle characteristics and source intensities.

The quality of the male germ cell is  determined in part by the presence and function of stress response mechanisms.  During spermatogenesis, different germ cell types display differential  susceptibility to toxicants, suggesting there is variation in the presence and  function of stress response mechanisms. Exposure of male rats to cyclophosphamide, a  commonly used anticancer and immunosuppressive drug, alters male fertility and  progeny outcome in a male-germ cell phase specific manner. The hypothesis of this  thesis is that stress response mechanisms are differentially expressed during rat  spermatogenesis and that their expression is involved in the response to the  alkylating agent cyclophosphamide. The first objective of this thesis was to  elucidate the expression of stress response genes at different stages of male germ  cell development. Using cDNA arrays, the expression of several gene families was  profiled in rat pachytene spermatocytes, round spermatids and elongating spermatids.  Stress response genes were found to be differentially expressed during  spermatogenesis. The second objective was to determine whether the expression of  stress response genes was modified by exposure to cyclophosphamide. Acute and  chronic cyclophosphamide treatment altered gene expression in a cell- and  treatment-specific manner. Due to the known deleterious effects of cyclophosphamide  on meiotic events, the last goal was to assess the ability of pachytene  spermatocytes to undergo the meiotic G21/M transition. The delayed meiotic  progression induced by acute cyclophosphamide treatment, likely to be a checkpoint  response, contrasted with the lack of delay after chronic drug exposure. Together  these results show that male germ cells are differentially equipped with mechanisms  of stress response. Furthermore, cyclophosphamide alters the expression of stres</description><creator>Aguilar, Adriana</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Health Sciences, Oncology.</subject><subject>Health Sciences, Pharmacology.</subject><subject>Biology, Animal Physiology.</subject><title>Stress response mechanisms during rat spermatogenesis and the effects of the anticancer agent cyclophosphamide</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/c247ds648.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bv73c0976</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:9p290996t</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:30:05Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Semantic trees have often been used as theoretical tools for  showing the unsatisfiability of clauses in first-order predicate logic. Their  practicality has been overshadowed, however, by other strategies though considerable  effort has been made to improve semantic tree theorem provers over the last  decade. In this thesis, we propose building a parallel system through  the integration of semantic trees with resolution-refutation. The proposal comes  from the observations that the appropriate strategy for one class of theorems is  often very different from that for another class and many semantic trees tend to be  linear. In the linear semantic tree, one of the two branches from each node leads to  a failure node. Such linearity is attractive because we can focus our efforts on  closing the remaining branch. Unfortunately, the strategy of building a closed  linear semantic tree is incomplete. To help to achieve closure, we introduce the use  of unit clauses derived from resolutions when necessary, leading to a strategy that  combines the construction of semantic trees with  resolution-refutation. The parallel semantic tree theorem prover, called PrHERBY,  utilizes dedicated resolutions in scalable manner and strategically selects atoms to  construct semantic trees. In addition, a parallel grounding scheme allows each  system to have its own instance of generated atoms, thereby increasing the  possibility of success. The PrHERBY system presented performs significantly better  and generally finds proof using fewer atoms than the semantic tree prover, HERBY and  its parallel version, PHERBY.</description><creator>Kim, Choon Kyu, 1963-</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Computer Science.</subject><title>Parallel semantic tree theorem proving with resolutions</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3n203z61n.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9p290996t</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:mg74qm52z</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:30:05Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) genome consists of  two identical RNAs that appear noncovalently linked near their 5' ends. The 5'  untranslated region is called leader region. The 3' part of leader, i.e. nucleotides  U200 to G335 in HIV-1 genomic RNA, between the primer binding site and the gag gene,  can fold into 3 stem-loops: the kissing-loop domain (KLD) or stem-loop 1 (SL1), the  5' splicing junction hairpin (SD) or SL2 and SL3. The KLD, from nucleotide (nt) 243  to 277, forms a stem-loop (kissing loop hairpin) seated on top of a small stem bulge  (stem B and loop B). The kissing-loop hairpin, or dimerization initiation site (DIS)  hairpin consists of stem C and loop C. Loop C contains the autocomplementary  sequence (ACS) GCGCGC262 or GUGCAC262, also called DIS. In the kissing-loop model of HIV-1 genome dimerization, HIV-1  RNA dimerization is initiated by base pairing between the ACS of one RNA monomer and  that of an adjacent monomer. To understand the role of the ACS in HIV-1 replication and HIV-1  genomic RNA dimerization, we replaced the central CGCG261 (or tetramer) of the HIV-1  Lai ACS by other tetramers. Genomic RNAs containing the UUAA tetramer (non-HIV-1  tetramer) were half dimeric, but UUAA genome packaging was unaffected. This was the  first evidence that genomic RNA dimerization and packaging can be dissociated  (Chapter 2). Destroying stem-loop C reduced genomic RNA dimerzation by ~50%,  proviral DNA synthesis by ~85%, and reduced viral infectivity by ~3  logarithmic units. Destroying stem-loop B had similar effects on genome  dimerization, reverse transcription, and viral infectivity. We also observed that  mutations in stem-loop B and in the DIS hairpin were "non additive"  (Chapter 2). The existence of stem-loop C is supported by phylogenetic  evidence, while that of stem-loop B is not, namely, its sequence is completely  conserved. We investigated the role of stem B and loop B nucleotides in viral  replication, and genomic RNA dimerization. The putative CUCG246/CGAG277 duplex was  replaced by 9 alternative complementary sequences, 4 likely to base pair in long  (~500 nts) RNAs, as assessed by the algorithm mfold. Among the 4 sequences,  3 preserved genome dimerzation, 1 did not significantly inhibit it, and 2 preserved  viral replication. We also asked if 9 deletions or nucleotide substitutions within  nucleotide 200 to 242 and/or 282 to 335 could influence genome dimerization.  Delta200--226 and Delta236--242 genomic RNAs dimerized relatively poorly despite  having neutral or positive influences on stem B, loop B and klh folding (Chapter  3). Mutations within the Matrix, Capsid, p2 and nucleocapsid genes  suppress several functional defects caused by KLD destruction. We tested the effect  of these suppressor mutations on genome dimerization and infectiousness of viruses  bearing moderate to crippling KLD mutations. Our conclusion is that these suppressor  mutations can restore genomic RNA dimerization when DIS is weakened, but not when  DIS is denatured or the KLD is destroyed (Chapter 4).</description><creator>Shen, Ni, 1969-</creator><contributor>Laughrea, Michael (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>HIV-1.</subject><title>Role of the leader sequence of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 in viral replication, genome dimerization, encapsidation, and proviral DNA synthesis</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/z890rt88b.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/mg74qm52z</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Experimental Medicine</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:2801pg712</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:30:06Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>A new approach for design and fabrication of new photoresponsive  and biomimetic materials is described using theoretical predictions and experimental  characterisations. Novel discrete hydrogen-bonded aggregates are formed from  photoresponsive azodibenzoic acid building blocks, which can undergo a reversible  cis-trans photoisomerisation. In trans-p-azodibenzoic acid, the two carboxylic  groups are aligned parallel to each other while, in the cis isomer, they are almost  perpendicular. This structural difference between the two isomers leads to different  hydrogen-bonded geometries: the trans isomer aggregates linearly whereas its cis  counterpart forms cyclic tetramers. Molecular and bulk material characterisation are  used to identify a higher-order self-organisation from the cis-isomers, which  results in long, unidimensional rod-like structures. A new understanding of hydrogen-bonded aggregates is developed,  where the thermodynamics of azodibenzoic acid self-assembly are identified using  vibrational properties, molecular orbital wavefunctions, and density matrix  analysis. Quantum mechanical properties of hydrogen-bonded azodibenzoic acids  establish the relative stabilities of the self-assembly products, validating the  formation of trans-linear tapes and cis-cyclic tetramers. A molecular modelling strategy is implemented to provide  detailed information on packing within cis-azodibenzoic acid rod-like  nanostructures. Energy scans determine face-packing as the preferred macrocycle  arrangement. Quantum mechanical optimisation of this face-packed structure shows  little deviation from predicted molecular models, highlighting the strength of this  modelling technique. Electronic properties exhibit significant pi-electron  delocalisation throughout the entire arrays, along with a HOMO-LUMO band gap  narrowing towards values typical of non-doped, organic semi-conducting  materials. Dicyano-, ditriazene- and diureido-azobenzene derivatives are  introduced to design tightly bound supramolecular structures by multiple  hydrogen-bonding and metal-coordination. Using geometric arguments, the conservation  of recognition site orientations and electronic properties upon substitution allows  the use of the trans- and cis-azodibenzoic acids as model monomers for the  prediction of self-assembly for these new photoresponsive units. Finally, new triaminopyrimidine nucleosides are synthesised to  generate hydrogen-bonded supramolecular structures from DNA-base analogues.  Experimental characterisation shows that hydrogen-bonding of the triaminopyrimidine  monomer with barbiturates leads to oligomeric species. Using sterically encumbered  cyanuric acid nucleosides dramatically alters the hydrogen-bond self-assembly of  these molecules, giving rise to discrete hexameric macrocycles which further  associate to form elongated nanostructures.</description><creator>Rakotondradany, Felaniaina</creator><contributor>Whitehead, M.

This relationship is documented using kinematic analyses in conjunction with  a mathematical model of jaw motion and direct measures of jaw  stiffness. In the first experiment, empirical and modeling studies were  carried out to examine whether the nervous system compensates for naturally  occurring forces acting on the jaw during speech. As subjects walk or run, loads to  the jaw vary with the direction and magnitude of head acceleration. While these  loads are large enough to produce a measurable effect on jaw kinematics, variation  in jaw position during locomotion is shown to be substantially reduced when  locomotion is combined with speech. This reduction in jaw motion is consistent with  the idea that in speech, the control of jaw movement is adjusted to offset the  effects of head acceleration. Results of simulation studies using a physiologically  realistic model of the jaw provide further evidence that subjects compensate for the  effects of self-generated loads by adjusting neural control signals. A second experiment explores the idea that a principle  mechanical property of the jaw---its spring-like behavior, or stiffness---might  influence patterns of kinematic variation in speech movements. A robotic device was  used to deliver mechanical perturbations to the jaw in order to quantify stiffness  in the mid-sagittal plane. The observed stiffness patterns were non-uniform, with  higher stiffness in the protrusion-retraction direction. Consistent with the idea  that kinematic patterns reflect directional asymmetries in stiffness, a detailed  relationship between jaw kinematic variability and stiffness was  observed---kinematic variability was consistently higher under conditions in which  jaw stiffness was low. Modeling studies suggested that the pattern of jaw stiffness  is significantly determined by jaw geometrical properties and muscle force  generating abilities. A third experiment examines the extent to which subjects are  able to alter the three-dimensional pattern of jaw stiffness in a task-dependent  manner. Destabilizing loads were applied to the jaw in order to disrupt the ability  of subjects to maintain a static jaw posture. Subjects adapted by increasing jaw  stiffness in a manner that depended on the magnitude and, to a more limited extent,  direction of the destabilizing load. The results support the idea that stiffness  properties can be controlled in the jaw, and thus may play a role in regulating  mechanical interactions in the orofacial system.</description><creator>Shiller, Douglas M.</creator><contributor>Ostry, David J.
