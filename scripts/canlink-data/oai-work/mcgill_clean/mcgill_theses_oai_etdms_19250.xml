The first two approaches (represented by the Hadïth material of Bukhari and Muslim, and the treatise of al-Hasan al-Basrï) were closely connected to the first century political-religious upheavals, but the formulations of these two approaches were based upon two different interpretations of the Qur'an. The third approach (represented by al-Ash'arï and Ibn Hazm, among others) sought to preserve Divine Omnipotence while at the same time allowing for some notion of human responsibility so that taklïf would remain a meaningful concept.</description><creator>Ede, David.</creator><contributor>Little, D.

In addition, it examined performance on questions and its influence on comprehension. Within a theoretical framework of discourse processing, the research focused on question type, passage structure, and individual differences in comprehension. Comprehension was measured by analyzing propositions recalled and inferred during free recall. Performance on questions was measured by analyzing answers for the presence of particular types of inferences. Third grade children read selected fictional passages, answered questions about them, and recalled them. Results revealed that the effects of questions on comprehension are complex, interacting with passage structure, reading level, and response type. Findings also indicated that questions influence the selective processing of propositional information in text. Question-answering performance was found to reflect an interaction between question type and passage structure. Furthermore, ability to generate the appropriate inferences in responding to questions facilitated text comprehension.</description><description>Cette étude porte sur les effets de différents types de question sur la compréhension du discours. Elle examine la performance par rapport aux questions et son influence sur la compréhension. Dans un cadre théorique de traitement du discours, la recherche est axée sur la type de question, la structure de texte et les différences individuelles en compréhension. La compréhension a été mesurée par l’analyse des propositions rappelées et inférées durant le rappel libre. La performance par rapport aux questions a été mesurée par l’analyse des réponses faite en fonction de la présence de types particuliers d’inférence. Des enfants de troisième année ont lu certains passages de fiction, ont répondu à des questions sur ces passages et les ont rappelés. Les résultats révèlent que les effets des questions sur la compréhension sont complexes et interagissent avec la structure du passage, le niveau de lecture et le type de réponse. Les résultats indiquent aussi que les questions influencent le traitement sélectif de l’information propositionnelle dans le texte. La performance par rapport aux questions démontre une interaction entre le type de question et la structure du passage.

Firstly, the Modern Age of Islam is supposed to have begun in the second half of the nineteenth century. Though Islam, in the post-mediaeval period, was confronted by the West at various places since the beginning of the eighteenth century, the early impact did not cause a ripple in the somnolent waters of Islam.
