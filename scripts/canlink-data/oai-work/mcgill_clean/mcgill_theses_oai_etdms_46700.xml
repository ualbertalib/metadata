Lockhart asked him from what book it should be. "Need you ask?" said Sir Walter, "there is but one." That book was the Bible, and it was the Bible in the Authorized Version of James the First. We may apply the words with perfect fitness to the place which the Bible holds in the rich treasure-house of our English Literature. Of all the books that have been written in our noble English tongue, "there is but one." If we could imagine some strange convulsion of nature in which all other books, even from "King Shakespere himself" down to the latest volume, were lost, and if only a copy of the English Bible were preserved our race would not be without its literary as well as its spiritual food,--its daily bread sufficient not only for the day but for the production of a new literature as glorious as the old.

The opening of the nineteenth century marked a new era in periodical literature. It marked the beinning of the great reviews. The function of the review was to "discuss works of literature, art and science, to consider national policy and public events, to enlighten its readers upon these subjects and to awardpraise or censure to authors and statesmen.lt did not publish original matter, but confined itself to commenting upon or criticising the works and doings of others". (1) [...] During the eighteenth century, most reviews were of very slight importance and were under the control or influence of the publishers, who used them to advertise their wares, for at that time book-selling and book-publishing were but parts of a single enterprise. The sole object of the spurious criticism in these reviews was to increase the prosperity of the publisher.

We live in an age that is investigating in a remoter past than was revealed to the students of the last generation. More intensive searching in regions that have already given forth truth has yielded rewardsof more and sometimes better truth. truth.

He was the eldest son of Jaok B. Yeats, R.H.A., the well-known artist, and the grandson of William Butler Yeats, M.A., Rector of Tullylish, County Down. On his mother's side he was descended from respectable merchants and ship-owners, his maternal grandfather, Willlam Pollexfen, having some little reputation in Sligo and the surrounding counties as a bold seaman and a shrewd business man. The ink of commerce did not, however, flow in the veins of all the Pollaxfens: George, the uncle of Mr. Yeats, having been secured an adequate income by the acumen and industry of his father, devoted himself in youth to the pleasures of the stable and hunting field, and in middle age to the more intelleotual delights of astrology and the practice of magic.

With them, they were little else than trading stations or military settlements. This factory system, also characterized the chain of outposts, which Portugal established from Madeira to Japan when she was at her zenith.

In 1748 Needham, in support of his theory of spontaneous generation, heated putrefiable substances in well-corked flasks, Within a few days his flaskswere peopled with micro-organisms. This, to Needham, wae proof that his theory of spontaneous generation was tenable. Spallanzai, however, in 1765, boiled meat extract for one hour and a half in hermetically sealed flasks and observed that no decomposition of the extract occurred there after. In 1782 Scheele advised the application of this principle to the preservation of vinegar. [...]</description><creator>Gough, W.</creator><contributor>Harrison, F.

During the course of these experiments the writer found that nucleated red cells appear in the circulation as a result of injection. Since quartz is practically insoluble the writer began to investigate the effect of particulate matter in general upon the red cell content of the blood, particularly in relation to the haemolyto-poietic function of the reticuloendothelial system. Certain observations have also been made upon the reactions of leucocytes toward single and repeated doses of particles. [...]</description><creator>Elvidge, Arthur R.</creator><contributor>Tait, J.

Such workers as Tollens 1,Fischer 2, Karrer 3, Irvine 4 and more- recently Hibbert 5 and his pupils have studied or used this class of compounds in their efforts to explain, by analogy, certain features of the chemical behaviour of the more complex polysaccharides. It is remarkable, therefore, that up to the, present time, the molecular structure of one of the simplest glycerol acetals, namely, ethylidene glycerol has remained undetermined, its formula being given as either, or both, of the two possible isomeric forms.

The object of the investigation was to be a determination of the Frequency Stability and Wave Form of the Output, obtainable. It developed, however, that no method of oscillator design of proven accuracy for low power oscil1ators was available and hence the problem or Frequency Stability and Output Wave Form was deferred until the problem of circuit design could be looked into. This involved a thorough study of the factors entering into the design of a Valve Oscillator and also of the methods used by other investigators.

No more does the employer treat with his few help in free and unrestricted fashion, or the benevolent factory owner regard his workmen as his proteges. Those days are gone. Whereas a hundred years ago an industry was a large one if backed with several hundred thousand dollars, to-day there are corporations with a capital of over a billion dollars.

Moreover, in the electric fields which obtain in 10 Surdo discharge phenomena appear whioh are difficult or even impossible to obtain elsewhere.
