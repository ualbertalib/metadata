In contrast to this, this work explores the color histogram intersection method. Simple thresholding processes color information pixel by pixel, whereas histogram intersection operates on groups of pixels. It thus captures more information. We investigate the possibility to localize faces based only on the use of color, as opposed to the post-processing of the thresholded image, usually required with simple thresholding. A color space is sought that minimizes the variations in facial color due to races and illumination conditions. We take advantage of the CIE XYZ color space because of both its perceptual superiority to the RGB space, and because a normalization of the space takes place prior to computing hue. We choose to specify facial color using just hue and we further model it through 1D hue histograms. We compute a generalized facial color model by accumulating facial color histograms across many images. An iterative algorithm scanning the image at multiple scales is proposed.

To identify occupational risk factors for cancer, a multi-site case-control study was conducted in Montreal; renal cell carcinoma was one of the sites. A total of 142 cases of renal cell cancer and 2,433 controls were interviewed in this study. Complete occupation histories were obtained, and a team of industrial hygienists and chemists estimated each subject's exposure to a list of industrial substances. Statistical analyses were carried out to estimate the association between renal cell cancer and each non-occupational and occupational variable. Among non-occupational variables collected and analysed, increased risks were observed for highest level of body mass index (BMI) and a previous history of hypertension. Negative associations were found for tea and coffee consumption. Increased risks were found in the following industries: printing related service, laundries, military, wholesale and retail trade industries. Increased risks were found in the following occupations: managers, plumbers, welders, printers, nursery workers, and aircraft mechanics. Exposure to the following substances significantly increased the risks for renal cell carcinoma: hair dust, felt dust, styrene-butadiene rubber, ozone, hydrogen sulphide, inorganic acid solution, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, jet fuel, aviation gasoline, jet fuel engine emissions, ink, chromium compounds, and ultraviolet radiation. The above findings were not adjusted for mutual confounding. After adjustment for known risk factors using multivariate logistic regression models, one non-occupational and several occupational risk factors were associated with renal cell carcinoma. These were: high BMI, asbestos, hair dust, felt dust, styrene-butadiene rubber, ozone, exposed to any of jet fuel, aviation gasoline, and jet fuel engine emission, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, and ultraviolet</description><creator>Hua, Ye, 1967-</creator><contributor>Siemiatycki, Jack (advisor)</contributor><date>1998</date><subject>Health Sciences, Oncology.</subject><subject>Health Sciences, Occupational Health and Safety.</subject><title>Occupational risk factors for renal cell carcinoma : a case-control study in Montr√©al</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3f462755m.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/w0892d055</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:bv73c272r</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:14:24Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Mobile agents are often described as a promising technology moving towards the vision of a widely distributed scalable electronic market. The deployment of electronic services, especially in the area of electronic commerce, raises essential questions closely related to security issues. This thesis first describes a common authentication scenario in electronic commerce area. To solve this scenario, we design a mobile agent model which involves two authentication levels: high-level customer authentication and low-level mobile agent authentication. As implementation of high level customer authentication, we select an opened CORBA based Java mobile agent system---Grasshopper. To achieve mobile agent level authentication, we suggest two cutting-edge security techniques: Java fine-grained access control from JDK 1.2 and the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol from Netscape.

Purpose . To identify childhood physical activity correlates. Methods . 383 4th--6th grade Mohawk children (193 boys, 190 girls) completed questionnaires and had anthropometric measures taken during 2 serial cross-sectional surveys as part of the Kahnawake Schools Diabetes Prevention Project (1994--1997). Physical activity was measured using the Weekly Activity Checklist. Demographics, community activities, parental variables, self-efficacy, sedentary activity, and overweight were correlates assessed using ordinal logistic regression. Results. 29.7, 33.4, and 36.8 percent were inactive, moderately active, and very active, respectively. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals [OR(95%CI)] of independent correlates for boys included year of measurement (1996 vs. 1994) [1.7(1.3,2.2)], older age [0.7(0.5,0.9)], and enrollment in school #1 [2.0(1.1,3.6)], lessons [2.8(1.3,5.9)] and summer sports [1.1(1.0,1.1]. Independent correlates for girls were year of measurement [1.5(1.1,2.1)] and parental physical activity [2.0(1.2,3.3)]. Conclusions. Parental models are stronger influences for girls' activities while community factors influence boys' activities.</description><creator>Horn, Ojistoh Kahnawahere.</creator><contributor>Paradis, Gilles (advisor)</contributor><date>1999</date><subject>Health Sciences, Public Health.</subject><subject>Education, Health.</subject><title>Correlates of physical activity frequency in Mohawk elementary school children : the Kahnawake Schools Diabetes Prevention Project (KSDPP) 1994-1997</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/td96k477s.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3j333445m</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:0p0969307</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:14:26Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Gold solubility studies in hydrous subaluminous rhyolitic/granitic melts of three compositions (a subaluminous rhyolite (LCO), a subaluminous rhyolite with 1.2 wt.% fluorine (MRF), and a subaluminous rhyolite with ~0.35 wt.% chlorine (LCI)) were conducted in a piston cylinder apparatus at temperature and pressure ranges of 900--1250¬∞C and 6--9 kbar (0.6--0.9 GPa). Starting rock powders were sealed in Au75Pd25 capsules (that acted as the source of Au) with 5--7 wt.% water. Oxygen fugacities were near 2 log units above the nickel-nickel-oxide (NNO) buffer. Gold contents in experimental glass products were analyzed by laser ablation - inductively coupled plasma - mass spectrometers (LA-ICP-MS). Combining solubility data in "near" Cl saturated melts at an oxygen fugacity of 2 log units above the NNO buffer from this study and Au solubility data in H2O saturated with NaCl from Ballhaus et al. (1994), the fluid/melt partition coefficient for Au was calculated. A fluid/melt partition coefficient was calculated with Au solubility data that was extrapolated to 2 log units below the fayalite-magnetite-quartz (FMQ) buffer, using the relationship between log Au concentration and log fO2 from Borisov and Palme (1996). Sulfide/melt partition coefficients for Au were calculated by combining Au solubility data from this study with Au solubility data from Cygan and Candela (1995).

Aror is homologous to RTKs from the Ror subfamily. Furthermore, Aror contains an extracellular immunoglobulin-like domain, cysteine-rich region, and kringle domain. These domains are all characteristic of Ror receptors. Aruf is homologous to members of the Ret and FGF receptor subfamilies of RTKs. However, Aruf does not have the extracellular domains typical of those receptors. Furthermore the degree of identity between Aruf and either the Ret or FGF receptors is closer to that between members of different RTK subfamilies, than between members of the same subfamily. Therefore, Aruf encodes an RTK belonging to a novel subfamily related to the Ret/FGFR subfamily.</description><creator>Hislop, Jonathan.</creator><contributor>Sossin, Wayne (advisor)</contributor><date>1998</date><subject>Biology, Molecular.</subject><subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</subject><title>Cloning of receptor tyrosine kinases from Aplysia californica</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vx021h33t.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6d56zz663</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:gx41mm07n</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:14:27Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In helminths, including the free-living nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans, serotonin (5-HT) acts as an important neuroactive agent and is associated with carbohydrate metabolism, glucouse utilization, motility, feeding and reproductive behaviour. In mammals and other organisms, 5-HT is synthesized through the action of tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH). TPH is the rate limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of 5-HT, and as such sets the pace for the formation of 5-HT. TPH is a member of a family of enzymes that hydroxylate aromatic amino acids and have an absolute requirement for the pterin cofactor, tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4). It is unknown if this same enzyme catalyzes the synthesis of 5-HT in C. elegans and other helminths. Based on sequence information from the C. elegans Genome Data Base and RT-PCR, we have cloned a full-length C. elegans TPH cDNA (CeTPH) that shows high homology to mammalian TPH. The predicted coding sequence of CeTPH was subcloned into the prokaryotic expression vector, pET-15b, and the resulting construct was introduced into E. coli (BL21 DE3 pLys strain) for IPTG-inducible expression of CeTPH protein. Results show that CeTPH expressed in E. coli has TPH activity and also shows an absolute requirement for the cofactor, BH4, just as shown previously for the mammalian enzyme. It has been well established that 5-HT is present and is biologically active in the tissues of C. elegans. By way of characterizing furthur CeTPH, we examined the localization of TPH in whole mounts of C. elegans by immunofluoresence using a polyclonal antibody against TPH. Taken together, the results of this thesis characterize at the structural, functional and in situ levels one of the most primitive forms of TPH enzyme ever cloned.</description><creator>Hill, Suzanne Deborah.</creator><contributor>Ribeiro, Paula (advisor)</contributor><date>1998</date><subject>Tryptophan hydroxylase.</subject><subject>Caenorhabditis elegans -- Genetics.</subject><title>Cloning, expression and partial characterization of tryptophan hydroxylase in Caenorhabditis elegans</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ws859h75q.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gx41mm07n</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Parasitology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:hm50tt788</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:14:28Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>loki was identified in our lab in a screen for novel serine-threonine protein kinases that are specifically expressed in the ovary. loki transcripts are expressed in early embryos and adult ovaries. In the ovaries, loki transcripts accumulate in the oocyte during early oogenesis, and by stage 8, are found to localize anteriorly to the oocyte-nurse cell interface. In order to understand the role of loki in Drosophila development, I created a loki mutant through excision of a P-element that had inserted 700bp upstream of loki. loki mutants display no apparent phenotype. I was also able to identify the transcription unit responsible for valois (vls) function since it is located downstream from loki in the 38B region. vls is a member of the posterior group gene family and vls mutant mother produce embryos that lack pole cells and show abdomen patterning defects. Further characterization of vls indicates that it is a fairly direct activator of Vasa protein: vls function is required between Oskar protein and Vasa in the posterior patterning pathway since Vasa fails to localize to the posterior pole of vls mutant eggchambers. I also find that Vasa is differentially modified in vls ovaries and embryos, even though it is not yet known whether this modification is required for localization, proper function or both processes.</description><creator>Hijal, Sirine.</creator><contributor>Suter, Beat (advisor)</contributor><date>1998</date><subject>Drosophila -- Molecular genetics.</subject><subject>Oogenesis.</subject><subject>Protein kinases.</subject><title>Function of the loki serinethreonine protein kinase and identification of valois</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/j9602304v.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hm50tt788</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:s1784n85m</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:14:29Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The major aim of this work was to develop a cell culture system in which changes in the rate of synthesis of intervertebral disc (IVD) matrix molecules could be evaluated in cells of animals of different ages. In particular, the synthesis of the large aggregating proteoglycans (PGs) and of decorin (DCN) and biglycan (BGN) were investigated. In addition, the potential use of growth factors to modulate the anabolism of these molecules was also studied. The results of these studies have demonstrated that the age related decline in PG biosynthesis observed in human disc tissue can be reflected in a bovine disc cell culture model. The three dimensional alginate bead cell culture model was effective in maintaining the phenotype of disc cells from both annulus fibrosus (AF) and nucleus pulposus (NP) regions in the presence of serum. Differences in phenotype of these respective cells were illustrated in vivo by the patterns of resident PGs obtained from tissue extractions. In the AF of young animals, the predominant form observed was a small PG form while in the NP of all age groups, aggrecan was the major species. In vitro collagen analyses confirmed the different phenotype of cells from the AF and NP regions. Also, TGF-beta1 was effectively used to stimulate over all PG synthesis in NP cells from and young adult bovine. After 10 days in culture, TGF-beta1 treated cells showed similar relative amounts of the small PGs compared to aggrecan as those determined from tissue extractions.</description><creator>Heathfield, Terrence Fran√ßois.</creator><contributor>Alini, Mauro (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1998</date><subject>Biology, Cell.</subject><title>Prooteoglycan synthesis in bovine intervertebral disc cells cultured in alginate beads : variation with age and modulation by TGF-b1</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/h415pc63k.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/s1784n85m</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Surgical Research</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:gt54kq25b</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:14:29Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>We review the salient clinical and laboratory features of cyclical neutropenia (CN) and other periodic hematological disorders, and the insight into these diseases afforded by mathematical modeling. Using Lomb periodogram analysis, we show that occurrence of significant cycling in the serial blood counts of neutropenic patients is very prevalent and the dynamics of all the cell lineages in CN can be modified by the administration of recombinant granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF). The analysis of the serial blood counts in the animal model of CN---the grey collie (GC), reveals a complex pattern of oscillations that we could reproduce with a model of hematopoiesis combining a peripheral control of granulopoiesis through G-CSF, together with an oscillatory input from the pluripotential stem cell. Both the human and GC data analysis suggests that CN results from a complex interaction between the stem cells, the mature cells and G-CSF, and that the regulation of the different blood cell lineages are strongly linked together.</description><creator>Haurie, Caroline.</creator><contributor>Mackey, M.

Based on the results obtained from sensory and RP-HPLC analysis, the optimal combinations to prepare a good quality of EMC were found to be: NeutraseRTM with (I) L. casei enzymes (aminopeptidase activity 86.4 LAPU/g and esterase activity 110.0 U/g), (II) Debitrase(TM) (aminopeptidase activity 22.0 LAPU/g), (III) Flavorzyme(TM) (aminopeptidase activity 6.5 LAPU/g), and (IV) PalataseRTM M (lipase activity 200 LU/g). The water-soluble fractions of EMCs prepared with different enzyme combinations were subjected to RP-HPLC on a Delta Pack C18 column, and selected peaks were purified on the same column using a binary gradient. One peak from NeutraseRTM digest, five peaks from NeutraseRTM /Debitrase(TM) digest, and two peaks from NeutraseRTM /L. casei enzyme digest were purified and identified by API mass spectrometry. All the purified peptides contained active sites within their sequences. The volatile compounds in a series of EMCs prepared by L. casei and commercial enzymes as well as Cheddar cheese (mild, old, extra old) were also identified by using Pyrolysis/GC/MS and dynamic headspace techniques. Overall, 5 ketones, 8 fatty acids, 3 alcohols and 2 aldehydes were detected in most of the samples using Py/GC/MS. Propanoic, hexanoic, octanoic, decanoic, dodecanoic and tetradecanoic acids were found to be the major fatty acids present in EMC prepared by L. casei enzymes. Dynamic headspace analysis revealed the presence of 17 compounds including fatty acids, ketones, alcohols, aldehydes, and hydrocarbon in most of the sample analyzed. The flavor of EMC seems to depend not on any particular key component, but rather on a critical balance of all components present.</description><creator>Haileselassie, Seble Sereke Berhan.</creator><contributor>Lee, B.

Provision of continuous darkness, agitation to cultures, mechanical resistance to stolons, or lower levels of medium nitrogen did not improve microtuberization. The 16/8 h d/n cycle at step 1 of microtuberization was significantly better than 12/12 or 8/16 h d/n cycles based on microtuber yield. Cultures exposed to prolonged step 2 or 2 successive harvests, rather than a single harvest at 30--35 d, had significantly improved microtuber yield. In a series of chemical and mechanical treatments applied to microtubers and minitubers, with or without variable periods of cold storage, 500 mg l -1 GA3 was the most efficient in breaking-dormancy and inducing precocious sprouting. GA3 was the only agent that was able to break dormancy of minitubers that had not been cold stored. After 2 weeks of cold storage, minitubers treated with GA3 also broke dormancy, while Signal was less effective in promoting sprouting.

Reliability is typically assessed quantitatively, through an appropriate coefficient, such as the Intra-class Correlation Coefficient (ICC). Validity, on the other hand, is assessed more informally through a series of tests and checks: for instance, construct validity may be established by testing the significance of factors that are supposed to influence the measure at hand. In general an ICC is calculated as a ratio of variance components to the total variance. Therefore the first step in the calculation of an ICC is the estimation of variance components from an appropriate statistical model. This thesis presents two approaches to the estimation of variance components in the context of reliability and validity studies: One is the ANOVA approach, based on the method of moments and valid especially for the case of balanced data. The other is the mixed linear model approach, for the more general case of unbalanced data. Furthermore, a general framework is developed which permits treatment of reliability and validity within the same statistical model, By means of this statistical model, a special case of the mixed linear model, appropriate ICCs for both reliability and validity can be computed, while construct validity can be established by testing the significance of appropriate fixed effects. The delta method and the bootstrap are proposed for the calculation of the standard errors and confidence intervals of the ICCs. Finally, an example of case-vignette study is presented. All calculations were carried out using the SAS system.</description><creator>Guo, Tong, 1968-</creator><contributor>Ciampi, A.

The St. James (StJ) population is territorial; it competes aggressively with conspecifics but scramble competes with heterospecifics. The Deep Water Harbour (DWH) population forages nonaggressively in large homospecfic flocks. Earlier studies linking these social differences with differences in individual and social learning suggest that Z. aurita is ideal for testing predictions from Brown's (1964) theory of economic defendability. Firstly, the hypothesis that resource defence will increase as the spatial clumping and temporal predictability of a resource increases was tested at 6 sites at DWH with a randomized complete block design. Secondly, spatial distribution of food was manipulated at both DWH and StJ in an attempt to alter the mode of foraging competition at DWH from scramble to interference, and to elicit group-feeding in the otherwise territorial StJ doves. As predicted, rates of aggression per intruder were highest for those sites at DWH receiving a spatially clumped and temporally predictable food source. Unlike those at DWH, doves from StJ did not modify their mode of foraging competition in response to variations in spatial distribution, but rather as a consequence of increased resource density. Interference competition appears to be the default strategy for Zenaida doves, with birds switching to scramble competition when a threshold of resource density is reached, only to revert back to aggressive defence when the spatial clumping and temporal predictability of food increases.</description><creator>Goldberg, Joanna L.</creator><contributor>Lefebvre, Louis (advisor)</contributor><date>1998</date><subject>Zenaida aurita -- Food -- Barbados.</subject><subject>Competition (Biology)</subject><subject>Zenaida aurita -- Behavior -- Barbados.</subject><title>Variation in food defence as a function of local ecological conditions in the Zenaida dove</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/jw827d77r.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3b591b53t</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:wm117r03z</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:14:34Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The present generation of medical linear accelerators is computer controlled providing great precision in dose delivery in addition to other options, such as conformal radiotherapy which involves intensity modulated fields. These fields are produced with multileaf collimators (MLCs) capable of delivering a radiation beam with a pre-determined modulated intensity using the dynamic capabilities of the MLC leaves. Two dynamic beam delivery methods are currently used: the step and shoot method and the continuous motion method. The first consists of several static subfields with the motion of the leaves occurring without the presence of radiation, while in the other the leaves may move with the beam on. The work presented here intends to prove that dynamically enabled linear accelerators can be used with confidence by verifying the accuracy and the stability of motions of the movable axes for the two dynamic beam delivery methods. Prior to clinical use, the integrity of the entire beam delivery system must be tested and the dosimetry related to the MLC must be examined. The purpose of this thesis is to develop, analyze and perform tests for the commissioning of the dynamic beam delivery capabilities of a medical linear accelerator and to catalogue these tests to facilitate their implementation in a routine quality assurance program.</description><creator>G√©linas, Dominic.</creator><contributor>Evans, M.

Information on the changes that occur in protein secondary structure upon heating is provided by detailed examination of the amide I band, as different protein conformations have characteristic amide I frequencies. The objectives of the present study were: (i) to study the changes in protein structure that occur during gelation of whey protein isolate (WPI) and (ii) to correlate the changes in protein structure observed under different physico-chemical conditions to rheological properties of WPI gels prepared under the same conditions. The FTIR spectra of D2O solutions of WPI at different pHs, ranging from 3 to 10, were recorded as the temperature of the solution was increased from room temperature to 95¬∞C in 5¬∞C increments. In all the solutions studied, the formation of two new bands at 1618--1623 cm -1 and 1678--1684 cm-1 was observed upon heating; these bands are characteristic of aggregate formation and have been previously assigned to antiparallel beta-sheet structure. As the pH increased from 3 to 10, the aggregation temperature of WPI decreased from 85¬∞C to 65¬∞C. The rheological properties of WPI gels were studied by employing an Instron Universal Testing Machine. The Instron measurements demonstrated that protein concentration, heating temperature, and heating and cooling time are directly related to gel strength. The changes in gel strength as a function of cooling time (for gels prepared by heating at 75¬∞C for 45 min) were correlated to FTIR spectral data for WPI solutions subjected to the same treatment.</description><creator>Geara, Charif.</creator><contributor>Ismail, A.

The objectives of this project were to estimate the metal speciation in urban soils and to evaluate the predictability of soil metal pools on plant uptake. The chemical speciation of Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn was estimated by using the Windermere Humic Aqueous Model (WHAM). In soil solutions, Cd, Ni and Zn were present mainly as free ions when the solutions were acidic and their organic complexes were dominant as the pH was over 7.5. The other two metals mostly formed complexes with organic ligands. The activities of Cd2+, Cu2+, Ni2+, Pb2+ and Zn 2+ were affected by soil pH and total soil metal burdens. All five metals were under-saturated with respect to the minerals which could potentially control the metal solubility. Metal uptake by plants in the contaminated railway yards was generally not correlated with free, dissolved and total soil metal pools. A pot experiment demonstrated better correlations between the metal pools and the metal content in wild chicory. Multiple regression analysis showed that the metals in the leaves and roots of wild chicory could be adequately predicted by the soil total metals and soil properties such as pH and exchangeable Ca.</description><creator>Ge, Ying, 1974-</creator><contributor>Hendershot, William H.

(Diptera: Anthomyiidae) each year. It is possible to decrease this quantity of insecticide by using natural enemies such as fungi, nematodes, predators and parasitoids. Aleochara bilineata Gyllenhal (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae) is a natural enemy of the cabbage maggot. Adults of this species are predators of eggs and larvae of cabbage maggot and the first instar larvae are ectoparasitoids of cabbage maggot pupae. A. bilineata oviposits its eggs in the soil, near plants infested with cabbage maggots. Differences in size have been noted in the eggs of A. bilineata . In insects several factors can affect egg size. Certain females can oviposit small trophic eggs which serve as food for emerging larvae or egg size can be affected by factors such as size and age of female, as well as, food and host quality. These factors have been studied in A. bilineata in order to determine the conditions that favor the production of small eggs.

Spectroscopic studies (FT-IR, FT-Raman, visible Raman, ESR, XPS and UV) indicate that the blue color is not due to a detectable impurity in the lime but is most probably a consequence of the formation of various polysulfide species, including S4 2- and S52-, although not the S3- radical. The use of the blue product as a precipitation agent for nickel and zinc in the treatment of acid mine drainage has been explored in a preliminary manner. (2) Diethylenetriamine is employed in the mining industry as a metal complexing agent in mineral flotation.

The source of arsenic is unclear. It could be supplied to the Fjord by the marine waters which enter from the St. Lawrence Estuary or may have accumulated as a result of historically high levels of effluent input. The waters of the Saguenay Fjord are also characterized by anomalously high particulate aluminum concentrations (i.e., [Al]tot/[Al] diss &gt; 1), introduced as a result of the aluminum refining activity along the shores of its tributaries. Gibbsite (Al(OH)3), a by-product of this activity, is known to strongly adsorb phosphate and arsenate from low ionic strength aqueous solutions, and may act as a vector for these two elements to sediments of the Saguenay Fjord. The small amount of arsenate and phosphate adsorbed onto gibbsite from seawater indicates that their adsorption to particulate aluminum in the water column cannot account for the elevated levels of arsenic and phosphate in the sediments of the Saguenay Fjord.

In this study, the defecation periods in older wild type and clk-1 mutant worms were found to be similar despite their differences in young adults. Transgenic strains which express high levels of clk-1 were characterized phenotypically. Over-expression of the clk-1 gene has no observed effect on physiological rates as measured conventionally in young adults but rather has an effect on defecation rates in an age-dependent manner. A proportion of ageing transgenic animals over-expressing clk-1 did not have decreased defecation period, as seen in ageing wild type and clk-1 mutants. This suggests that the action of CLK-1, which functions in controlling physiological rates, is reduced in older wild type worms. As previously characterized, clk-1 mutants have lengthened life spans compared to wild type (Wong et al., 1995). Consistent with this effect, we found transgenic strains with high clk-1 expression to have a shortened average life span. Furthermore, no effect on average life span was found in transgenic control strains in which clk-1 expression was not altered, confirming that the presence of the transgene and the phenotype marking its presence do not influence the observed effects in strains with high clk-1 expression. Together, the findings from both the studies on physiological rates and life span suggest that clk-1 plays a role in determining the rate at which worms age.</description><creator>Felkai, Stephanie.</creator><contributor>Hekimi, Siegfried (advisor)</contributor><date>1998</date><subject>Caenorhabditis elegans -- Genetics.</subject><subject>Caenorhabditis elegans -- Longevity.</subject><title>Phenotypic consequences of altering expression of the Caenorhabditis elegans timing gene clk-1.</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ft848s62m.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/b8515q606</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:g158bk31d</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:14:40Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In this paper we examine parametric solutions to the generalized Fermat equation, xp+yq=zr.

Cellular Glutathione (GSH) levels were measured by the Tietze Spectrophotometric method. GSH levels in A2780 CP cells were approximately three time that of the parental A2780 cells. In cells depleted of GSH by L-Buthionine Sulfoximine (BSO), Cisplatin-resistance was significantly decreased in both cell lines. BSO had no effect on the radiation resistance of either cell lines. However treatment of cells with a combination of BSO and Dimethyl Fumarate (DMF) significantly decreased the radio-resistance in A2780 CP cells. The combination treatment had no effect on the radio-response of the parental cells. Ethacrynic acid (EA), an inhibitor of Glutathione S-Transferase (GST) activity had no effect on cellular GSH levels nor did it affect the Cisplatin or radiation resistance in either cell line. These results suggest that GSH levels are involved in Cisplatin and radiation resistance in these cells. However the mechanism of GSH involvement in radiation and Cisplatin-resistance appears to be different in the cell lines studied.</description><creator>English, Michael Joseph.</creator><contributor>Lehnert, Shirley M.

The crude extract in the active form was partially purified by ammonium sulfate fractionation, followed by column chromatography by ion exchange in the Fast Protein Liquid Chromatography (FPLC) system. Using a 10 mM concentration, the order of effectiveness for the inhibitors in achieving 35--40% was CaCl2, CuSO4, MgCl 2 and EDTA. At a 25 mM concentration, propionic acid and sodium acetate inhibited the enzyme up to 40% &amp; 50%, respectively. M. rouxii CDa activity was greater in the mycelial extract, and was capable of efficiently hydrolyzing the substrate glycol chitin. Two major bands were observed after native PAGE of the partially purified enzyme using Mono Q column (FPLC). The estimated molecular weight of CDa bands by SDS-PAGE containing 0.1% glycol chitin was 21, 23, 26 and 44 kDa when compared to the migration of molecular weight markers.
