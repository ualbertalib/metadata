This thesis, then, not only pinpoints the lack of accuracy of the terms contained in Article 50 but also suggests how the provision should be construed. In order to do so, this project studies the origins of aviation insurance as well as its main characteristics and practice; presents an overview of the legal doctrine prompted as a consequence of the incorporation of Article 50; performs a thorough study of the evolution of Article 50; and concludes with a comparative study of other regional and domestic legal regimes requiring compulsory aviation insurance.</description><creator>Fernandez-Pena, Sebastian.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Aviation insurance.</subject><title>Aviation insurance : a Montreal '99 perspective</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Sebastian Fernandez-Pena, 2006</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cf95jg490.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6395wc71r</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Air and Space Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:jd473150p</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:17:49Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Myelin is an evolutionarily late acquisition of the vertebrate nervous system which speeds electrochemical signaling in mature nerve fibers by providing insulation in the form of a lipid-rich multilammelar sheath. Proteolipid Protein (PLP) is the most abundant protein in mature mammalian central nervous system myelin where it serves as a structural component in addition to other yet undefined roles. It is coordinately regulated at the transcriptional level with other myelin genes such as Myelin Basic Protein (MBP). The major components of MBP transcriptional regulation have been defined using a strategy of targeted transgenesis at the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT) locus allowing quantitative and qualitative in vivo analysis of the transcriptional control exerted by conserved non-protein-coding sequences in transgenic mice. This study describes the localization and functional characterization of PLP conserved non-protein-coding sequences. Conservation was surveyed using alignments of genome sequences for a number of vertebrates ranging in their evolutionary distance from mouse. Aligned sequences were also scanned for clusters of conserved consensus binding sites for sox 10, krox20, gtx and betaHLH transcription factors, which play key roles in nervous system development. Dissection of conserved non-protein-coding sequence resulted in the production of a series of 10 reporter constructs addressing the search for PLP regulatory elements. This series includes highly conserved regions, some of which contain clusters of transcription factor consensus sites, as well as lesser conserved regions which were suggested to have regulatory activity in previous investigations. Notably, in vivo evidence of the importance of intron 1 for expression in the nervous system led to subsequent deletion-transfection analyses revealing a seemingly potent enhancer, the antisilencer/enhancer (ASE) within the intron, which is functionally validated in this study. Of this series, 8 of the selected regions have been amplified successfully and cloned into HPRT targeting constructs with a minimal lisp promoter and LacZ reporter. All 8 constructs have been transfected into ES cells. Homologous recombinants with the transgene docked at HPRT were selected, and chimeras have been analyzed for 3 of these constructs. To our surprise, neither a construct containing 2kb of 5' flanking sequence, nor a construct containing the highly conserved intron 3, were able to drive expression at the peak of myelination. A construct containing the ASE was unexpectedly shown to drive expression in cells scattered within the central grey matter of the spinal cord in a pattern intriguingly similar to that seen embryonically from migrating oligodendrocyte progenitors. The lack of expression of the first 2 constructs suggests that PLP regulatory elements may be interdependent, but we anticipate that delivery into germline followed by developmental and analysis of the full series of constructs will bring light to the emerging picture of partnerships between regulatory elements, and will also reveal the identity of the cells driving expression from the ASE. Understanding PLP transcriptional control may lead to therapeutic interventions as associated diseases result predominantly from imbalances in gene dosage leading to abnormal levels of PLP protein.</description><creator>Tuason, Maria Clarita.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</subject><title>Functional analysis of Proteolipid Protein regulatory sequence</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Maria Clarita Tuason, 2006</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/d791sm43f.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/jd473150p</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Neuroscience</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:cc08hk84c</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:17:50Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Treg cells counter-balance autoreactive immune cells in healthy individuals. In the absence of Treg cells, multi-organ immune diseases manifest. Thus, Treg cell defects are suspected to contribute to T1D. Currently, it remains unclear whether Treg cell defects are responsible for the manifestation of T1D. Thus, we hypothesized that Treg cell defects results in T1D. We observed that T reg cells are present in normal frequencies in the thymus and peripheral immune system of diabetes-prone mice. Furthermore, thymic and peripheral T reg cells are operative and mediate regulation by suppressing effector T (Teff) cells in the pancreatic lymph nodes and pancreas. Specifically, regulation corresponded with increased frequencies of Treg cells and reduced in diabetogenic T cells in both sites, and controlled insulitis. However, as the immune response against beta cells of the pancreatic islets progresses in prediabetic mice, peripheral Treg cells wane in function and cannot sustain sufficient Teff cell regulation in the pancreatic lymph nodes and pancreas. In summary, this study characterizes areas of T reg cell immunoregulation of T1D; and highlights a Treg cell dysfunction, not a quantitative Treg cell defect, manifesting in the peripheral immune system prior to diabetes onset but following T cell activation, which contributes to the escape of autoreactive T cells.</description><creator>Tritt, Michael.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Health Sciences, Immunology.</subject><title>Studying the role of naturally-occurring regulatory T cells in a model of type 1 diabetes</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Michael Tritt, 2007</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2r36v273z.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cc08hk84c</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Microbiology and Immunology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:ks65hh52x</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:17:50Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Aging is characterized by an imbalance in cellular redox status due to an increase in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and a decreased activity of the cellular antioxidant defenses. Spermatozoa are highly susceptible to oxidative stress and hence this mechanism likely plays a causal role in the deficiencies associated with aging and male reproduction. The goal of this study was to determine the effect of age on antioxidant enzymatic activity, ROS production, and lipid peroxidation in spermatozoa along the epididymis of the Brown Norway rat. Aging significantly decreased glutathione peroxidase (Gpx)-1, Gpx4 and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities and also significantly increased the production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and superoxide (O2•-). Further, lipid peroxidation was found to be significantly increased in aged spermatozoa. These results indicate that aged spermatozoa are less capable of dealing with oxidative stress and provide a basis for the understanding of decreased spermatozoal quality in aging.</description><creator>Weir, Cameron, 1981-</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Biology, Cell.</subject><title>Aging and oxidative stress in epididymal spermatozoa of the Brown Norway rat</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Cameron Weir, 2006</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pr76f785r.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ks65hh52x</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:xg94ht768</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:17:51Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Damage in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) may be mediated by infiltration of immune cells into the central nervous system (CNS) and sustained due to failure of axons to regenerate. Little is known about the impact of immune cells on axonal regeneration. We demonstrate that peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) have an inhibitory effect on neurite outgrowth dependent upon the cell subset and state of activation. Activated, purified CD3+ T cells inhibit outgrowth while untreated CD3+ cells and CD19+ B cells require pre-exposure to the cultured PBMC milieu. Neurons exhibited no evidence of cell death, indicating that the effect on outgrowth is not a side effect of cell death. Data indicates that the inhibitory effect of activated T cells requires cell-cell contact, whereas B cells may release a soluble factor to mediate inhibition. Our findings provide insight into immune-neural interactions relevant to CNS inflammatory conditions, including MS.</description><creator>Wright, Melissa, 1978-</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Biology, Cell.</subject><subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</subject><title>The effect of immune cells on neurite outgrowth /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Melissa Wright, 2007</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/nc580r822.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xg94ht768</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Neuroscience</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:6h440x92h</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:17:51Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Adiponectin is inversely related to obesity, insulin resistance and progression to type 2 diabetes in adults. However its distribution, determinants and its association with insulin resistance (IR) are less well studied in the pediatric population. The objectives of this study were to describe, in youth, the age- and sex-specific distribution of adiponectin concentrations, and its association with demographic, anthropometric, and lifestyle factors, parental diabetes, and markers of JR. This study was a secondary analysis of a sample of 1632 French Canadian youth aged 9, 13 and 16 years who participated in the Quebec Child and Adolescent Health and Social Survey, a province-wide school-based survey conducted in 1999. Boys had lower adiponectin concentrations than girls by 17% (p&lt;0.0001). Adiponectin concentrations decreased by age-group to a greater extent in boys than girls over the age range studied (27.7% vs. 13.3%, pinteraction=0.009). Mean adiponectin decreased by 8.1% in boys and 11.2% in girls (p&lt;0.0001) for every unit increase in BMI Z-score. Growth-related change in BMI explained half the age effect in boys and all the age effect in girls. Self-reported pubertal status, physical activity, smoking and parental diabetes were not independently associated with adiponectin. Fasting insulin and HOMA-IR were not associated with adiponectin concentration after adjusting for BMI. However, an interaction term for adiponectin and BMI Z-score was significant in a multiple linear regression model with fasting insulin as the dependent variable. In conclusion, male sex and changes in body fat may be major determinants of decreasing adiponectin concentrations in growing youth. There was no association between adiponectin and markers of 1R. The relationship between adiposity and markers of IR is attenuated in those with higher adiponectin concentrations, making adiponectin a potential intervention target or risk stratification marker for which the normative data presented herein may be useful.</description><creator>Punthakee, Zubin.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Health Sciences, Public Health.</subject><subject>Health Sciences, Epidemiology.</subject><title>Adiponectin : distribution, and associations with age, sex, adiposity, lifestyle factors, family history and insulin resistance in children and adolescents</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Zubin Punthakee, 2006</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/fn1073273.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6h440x92h</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:zk51vn16x</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:17:51Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>CD4+ regulatory T (TREG) cells are important contributors to the induction and maintenance of peripheral tolerance. This heterogeneous population consists of naturally occurring and induced CD4 + TREG cells that share between themselves key immunoregulatory characteristics. Their phenotype and function often relies on the expression of Foxp3 transcription factor and the presence of the immunomodulating cytokine TGF-beta1. The inter-dependence between TGF-beta1 and Foxp3 in the induction and maintenance of peripheral tolerance is gradually being elucidated. Thus, we investigated the effects of TGF-beta1 on induction or maintenance of regulatory functions in CD4+CD25- as well as CD4+CD25+ T cells. TGF-beta1 treatment was able, independent from APCs, to promote TREG cell differentiation from non-regulatory CD4+CD25- T cells in a concentration-dependent fashion through Foxp3 induction. Next, we investigated the effect of TGF-beta1 on purely naive CD4+CD25- CD45RBHIGH T cell subset. Fresh or TGF-beta1-treated CD45RBHIGH T cells did not display regulatory functions nor Foxp3 expression. In stark contrast, TGF-beta1 treatment promoted regulatory activity in the CD4 +CD25- CD45RBLOW T cells and enhanced Foxp3 expression. Interestingly, fresh CD45RBLOW cells, albeit expressing noticeable levels of Foxp3 mRNA and protein, were unable to suppress effector T (TEFF) cell proliferation. Furthermore, addition of neutralizing anti-IL-10R Ab completely abrogated this suppression, consistent with the ability of TGF-beta1 treated CD45RBLOW to synthesize IL-10 mRNA upon re-stimulation in vitro. TGF-beta1 treatment or blockade did not lead to preferential growth or enhanced function of naturally-occurring CD4+CD25+ TREG cells, yet it caused a significant increase in Foxp3 expression. Altogether, TGF-beta1 preferentially promotes the induction of IL-10 secreting CD4+ regulatory T cells from CD45RBLOW precursors through Foxp3 induction.</description><creator>Pyzik, Michal.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Health Sciences, Immunology.</subject><subject>Biology, Cell.</subject><title>TGF-[beta]1 selectively induces Foxp3 transcription factor and regulatory functions in CD4+CD25⁻CD45RBLow T cell population</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Michal Pyzik, 2006</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1n79h850r.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zk51vn16x</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Microbiology and Immunology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:vm40xx19g</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:17:52Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Fetal branching determines final nephron number. Mild nephron deficit causes hypertension in "normal" adults. Thus, mechanisms that control branching are important. PAX2 and retinoic acid (RA) have profound effects on final nephron number, although the mechanism remains unknown. We hypothesised that common variations in PAX2 cause subtle reduction in nephrons. We associated haplotype tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (htSNPs) in PAX2 with a reduction in kidney mass in "normal" newborns and identified a haplotype on which an ancestral polymorphism is presumed to lie. We identified a SNP in linkage disequilibrium with this haplotype that caused alterations in PAX2 expression, linking reduction in expression with reduced nephrons. We hypothesized that Lgl1, a pulmonary branching morphogen, is stimulated by RA to affect renal branching. We characterized Lgl1 expression in the kidney and its response to RA. Finally, we showed that Lgl1+/- embryos have reduction in kidney branching, implicating Lgl1 in nephron formation.</description><creator>Quinlan, Jacklyn.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Biology, Genetics.</subject><title>Genetic determinants of final nephron number during kidney development</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Jacklyn Quinlan, 2007, 2006</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/47429f66n.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vm40xx19g</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Human Genetics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:5h73q123g</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:17:52Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The AAA ATPase p97/VCP functions in numerous cellular pathways.

The objective of this research project is to analyze the phenotype of knockout mice for Ly49Q, a cell surface receptor expressed on pDCs. In vivo, KO mice with PGK-Neor insertion control early murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection better, but no difference could be detected in mice with recombined LoxP sites. Thus, we observed differential immune response in KO mice with the PGK-Neor insertion and recombined LoxP sites. In mice with PGK-Neor insertion, we found enhanced hematopoiesis of some populations of the myeloid lineage and lower activation of pDCs following treatment with particular Toll-like receptors (TLR) ligands, which translates into diminished T cell stimulatory capacity.

PABP is composed of four RNA recognition motifs (RRM) at its N-terminal and a peptide-interacting C-terminal domain. PABP-interacting proteins 1 (Paip1) and 2 (Paip2) were found to respectively stimulate or inhibit translation. Both Paip 1 and 2 contain two PABP interacting regions (PAM1 and PAM2). In this study, NMR was used to elucidate the mechanism by which Paip2 down-regulates translation through disruption of PABP's binding to poly(A) RNA. A fragment consisting of PABP RRM 2 and 3 was isotopically labeled and backbone NMR assignments were determined. From NMR titration with PABP RRM2-3 and the Paip2 PAM1 region, we determined that Paip2 binds in a positively charged cleft on the beta-sheet surface of RRM2-3 which is evolutionarily conserved. These results suggest a mechanism of how Paip2 displaces the mRNAs from PABP leading to translation inhibition.</description><creator>Cotnoir-White, David.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Biology, Molecular.</subject><title>NMR study of the interaction between PABP and the translation down-regulator Paip2</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© David Cotnoir-White, 2006</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kw52jd02z.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/g732df191</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biochemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:dn39x543r</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:17:53Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Individual differences in sex and trait anxiety (TA) have been suggested as important mediators of behavioural and neural responses to threat-related stimuli. In this study, the relationship between sex, TA and the processing of threat-related stimuli (fearful faces) was explored in healthy individuals. During fMRI scanning, 32 participants completed tasks probing two facets of emotional function: responses to unattended fearful faces and emotional memory. Interactions between TA and sex were observed in both behaviour and brain activity. In women, higher TA was associated with a stronger amygdala response to unattended fearful faces, whereas no such relationship was present in males. Also, in women only, high TA was associated with stronger anterior cingulate and left amygdala activity when fearful faces were successfully encoded.

The determination of the risk time-window, defined as the period of time during which a medication-related AE could occur, is a crucial and challenging step toward the correct assessment of these AEs. In general, the unknown risk time-window consists of the number of days supplied, TS, for the medication and of a time-window. TW, that starts after TS and during which the medication could still produce AEs. Arguments have been made in favor of both short and long TW, durations. The aim of this thesis is to determine the impact of varying TW values on the assessment of the rate of cardiovascular AEs, using simulated data, and in a real-life example using administrative databases from Quebec. Results indicated that longer TW values tended to bias results toward the null.</description><creator>Cournoyer, Daniel.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Biology, Biostatistics.</subject><title>Risk time-window specification and its impact on the assessment of medication-related adverse events</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Daniel Cournoyer, 2006</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/wp988q044.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6d5701737</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:qb98mk508</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:17:54Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>When physical impairment impedes a driver's access to a vehicle's controls, adaptive equipment can compensate for functional loss. However, the impact of modifying automotive controls and the effectiveness of driver-training remain unclear. Of particular importance is the older driver's ability to integrate these adaptations. This thesis comprises two studies comparing older and younger drivers' perceived workload when driving with adaptive devices. First, workload ratings in normal driving were compared to ratings while driving using hand-controls to activate the vehicle's pedals. Significant increases in workload were observed for younger and older drivers. The second study evaluated the effect of driver-training on workload, comparing ratings prior to and following three hours of training. Although training was effective in reducing workload, seniors' scores did not return to baseline levels as did the younger drivers', and gender differences were observed. Clinically, the studies support the need for training. Age and gender may impact training-response.</description><creator>Benoit, Dana.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Biology, Physiology.</subject><subject>Gerontology.</subject><subject>Health Sciences, Rehabilitation and Therapy.</subject><title>Older and younger drivers' perceived workload when driving with adaptive equipment = La charge de travail perçu par des conducteur jeunes et âgés : lors de la conduite automobile avec des aides techniques</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Dana Benoit, 2006</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2514nq540.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qb98mk508</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Physical and Occupational Therapy</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:7m01bq72x</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:17:54Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Mutations in the parkin gene are responsible for an early-onset autosomal-recessive form of Parkinson's disease. Parkin is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that acts in the covalent attachment of the small protein ubiquitin to substrate proteins. Although many parkin substrates have been identified, none can fully account for the relatively specific death of the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra that occurs in Parkinson's disease. Using an assay that reconstitutes the ubiquitination reaction completely in vitro, I found that not all disease-associated mutations affected parkin's ligase activity. I used this assay to test a potential parkin substrate identified in our lab, the endocytic accessory protein Eps15, which specifically interacts with parkin in a regulated fashion. I found that parkin directly ubiquitinates Eps15 in vitro. Eps15 ubiquitination is known to occur during the process of ligand-induced downregulation of the epidermal growth factor receptor. I found that overexpressing parkin in COS-7 cells inhibited the first step of this process, namely, receptor internalization. These findings add to the knowledge of how pathogenic mutations affect parkin function, and identify a novel role for parkin as a regulator of ligand-induced downregulation of the epidermal growth factor receptor.</description><creator>Bélanger, Catherine.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Biology, Molecular.</subject><subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</subject><title>The Parkinson's disease gene, Parkin, ubiquitinates the endocytic accessory protein Eps15 and regulates endocytosis of the epidermal growth factor receptor /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Catherine Bélanger, 2006</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/05741w95q.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7m01bq72x</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Neuroscience</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:3r075038c</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:17:55Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Neurotrophins, NGF, NT-3, BDNF and NT4-5, are growth factor proteins key to the regulation of neuronal survival, death of differentiation. Neurotrophins bind two types of receptors, Trk tyrosine kinase receptors and the common p75 receptor. Disturbances in Trk expression or signaling can lead to certain cancers such as neuroblastomas and melanomas (TrkA responsive) and medulloblastomas (TrkC responsive). Less is known about the role of p75 in cancer as it plays such varying roles and regulatory functions. We characterized the in vitro and in vivo growth kinetics, tumorigenic potential and response to chemotherapeutics of PC 12-wt rat pheochromocytoma cells and variants expressing varying levels of TrkA or TrkC with or without p75. We find that independent expression of TrkA or p75 leads to higher growth rates and tumorigenic potential whereas co-expression of Trk with p75 lowers it. Additionally, differential neurotrophin receptor expression leads to different sensitivities to chemotherapeutics. This work will help design therapies for tumors with unique neurotrophin receptor phenotypes.</description><creator>Bassili, Muriel.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Health Sciences, Pharmacology.</subject><title>Neurotrophic mechanisms of neuroblastoma and other neoplasias of neuronal and non-neuronal origin</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Muriel Bassili, 2007</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8p58pj15n.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3r075038c</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:5x21tk73j</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:17:55Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Previous studies strongly suggested that RBP1 regulated E2F-dependent transcription. A previous pilot experiment also suggested that RBP1 exited the nucleus during muscle cell differentiation. In this study, repeated approaches and attempts consistently supported the alternative hypothesis that RBP1 remained nuclear during muscle differentiation. A key role for RBP1 in muscle differentiation was repeatedly suggested using RNAi. Specifically, siRNA was used to 'knock down' RBP1. The inability of myoblasts to form myotubes without RBP1 was illustrated by an inability of RBP1-depleted cells to express myosin after appropriate muscle-differention medium was applied. Further initial work suggested that RBP1's probable essential role in muscle differentiation was independent of RBP1's role in regulating E2F-dependent transcription.</description><creator>Blank, Michael Warren.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Chemistry, Biochemistry.</subject><title>The role of RBP1 in C2C12 myoblast differentiation /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Michael Warren Blank, 2006</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tm70n054c.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5x21tk73j</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biochemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:n583z025x</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:17:55Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Mogrosides, the main active components in S. grosvenorii SWINGLE, are considered to be some 250 times sweeter than sucrose and to possess several medicinal attributes. Previous isolation processes used large quantities of toxic solvent that resulted in toxic residues of organic solvent in this high value food. Supercritical fluids fulfill the requirements of non-toxicity, recycle ability, and useful solvent characteristics. The work presented in this thesis is directed to the extraction of mogrosides from the powdered S. grosvenorii concentrate (SG) and the crude extract after resin treatment (MG) with sub critical water and supercritical CO2. Because no source of mogroside V reference material is available commercially, the first objective of this research was to isolate mogroside V of sufficient purity that it could be crystallized. This objective was achieved by selecting suitable eluates from resin chromatography coupled with preparative thin layer chromatography (TLC). Crystalline white isolate was further characterized by 13C-NMR and by MS and determined to be mogroside V, which was suitable as a reference material for subsequent experiments. The process variables for both sub critical water and supercritical carbon dioxide extraction were evaluated and optimized so that conclusions could be formulated regarding the relative merits of the two proposed extraction methods. The efficiency of extraction was determined spectrophotometrically based on the recovery of mogrosides from the starting material following the vanillin-HClO4 method. When compared with Soxhlet solvent extraction, supercritical fluid extraction with either sub critical water or supercritical CO2 provided improved recoveries and consumed less organic solvent. In addition, the purity of the extracts differed greatly. For identical SG samples, sub critical water extraction was demonstrated to be more efficient (62.4% recovery) compared with 37.0% recovery by EtOH modified scCO2 extraction or 5.1% for Soxhlet extraction with hexane.</description><creator>Xia, Yan, 1971-</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Sweetening Agents.</subject><subject>Momordica.</subject><subject>Supercritical fluid extraction.</subject><subject>Triterpenes.</subject><subject>Chromatography, Supercritical Fluid.</subject><subject>Triterpenoid saponins.</subject><subject>Sweeteners.</subject><title>Supercritical fluid extraction of mogrosides from Siraitia grosvenorii</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Yan Xia, 2006</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ns064996f.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/n583z025x</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Food Science and Agricultural Chemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:r494vq15s</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:17:56Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Irrigation is a well established procedure on many farms in western Canada and is practiced on various levels around the world. It allows diversification of crops, while increasing crop yields. However, typical irrigation systems consume a great amount of conventional energy through the use of electric motors and generators powered by fuel. The overall objective of this research was to determine the feasibility of using photovoltaic (PV) modules to power a water pump for a small-scale drip irrigation system in Montreal (Quebec, Canada). The study involved field observations, as well as computer simulations of global solar radiation and PV electrical output. Field observations involved a summer and winter installation of two amorphous silicon 42 W PV modules, directly connected to a 12 V surface water pump. The parameters monitored were voltage, current, back-of-panel temperature, pressure, and flow. These observed parameters were used to determine PV electrical output and volume of water pumped. Site latitude, elevation, and panel tilt were applied to the solar radiation and PV electrical output models, along with the following meteorological data: daily average, maximum, and minimum temperatures, and global solar radiation. Daily solar radiation prediction showed a linear correlation of 0.69 with the observed daily values, over the years 2000 to 2005. The correlation coefficient was improved to 0.91, when 7 day moving averages of both the observed and predicted solar radiation data were used. PV electrical output and volume of water pumped were monitored between August 2005 and May 2006. Both the power and water output observations were less than expected. However, the predicted daily PV electrical output ranged from 1.0 MJ d-1 in the summer to approximately 0.6 MJ d-1 in the winter. As expected, an increase in power caused an increase in the volume of water pumped.</description><creator>Williamson, Erin.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Solar pumps -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal.</subject><subject>Microirrigation -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal.</subject><title>Solar power water pump studies for small-scale irrigation</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Erin Williamson, 2006</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0p096c173.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/r494vq15s</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Bioresource Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:x633f548h</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:17:56Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Aquatic plants play an important role in the survival and proliferation of invertebrates in freshwater ecosystems. Exotic plants are now common in North American lakes and rivers, where they may displace native plants, thereby potentially altering epiphytic invertebrate communities. Differences in aquatic invertebrate communities on native and exotic plants are examined here through (1) a meta-analysis of published data, and (2) two field surveys in northeastern North America that compared invertebrates on the exotic Myriophyllum spicatum and Potamogeton crispus to those on their native congeners. The meta-analysis revealed that exotic plants generally support lower invertebrate abundance than do natives, while invertebrate taxa richness tends to be similar on exotic and native plants. The field surveys demonstrated that M. spicatum and P. crispus support significantly different invertebrate densities and lower taxa richness than their structurally similar native congeners. These results suggest that the replacement of native plants by exotics---even those with similar morphology---may cause concomitant changes to aquatic ecosystems.</description><creator>Wilson, Sarah Jane.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Invasive plants -- Québec (Province).</subject><subject>Freshwater invertebrate populations -- Québec (Province).</subject><subject>Invasive plants -- New York (State).</subject><subject>Freshwater invertebrate populations -- New York (State).</subject><subject>Eurasian watermilfoil -- Québec (Province).</subject><subject>Eurasian watermilfoil -- New York (State).</subject><title>Freshwater macroinvertebrate communities on exotic and native plants</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Sarah Jane Wilson, 2007</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/d791sm44q.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/x633f548h</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:c821gq133</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:17:57Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>First, we review the basics of baryogenesis and models for baryogenesis in the early literature. Then, we discuss the main theme in this thesis, electroweak baryogenesis, which utilizes the electroweak phase transition. We present how the phase transition can be used to achieve baryogenesis. Next, we develop our model, which is the Standard Model with a singlet field coupled to the Higgs doublet negatively and to the right-handed neutrinos. It is a simple extension of the singlet Majoron model. We focus on numerical analysis of the model. Parameter space satisfying all the conditions are found and relevant quantities, such as the critical temperature, the Higgs mass, and the mixing angle are found as well. It turns out that LEP bound on the Higgs mass and the mixing angle is a strong constraint, and only a small fraction of parameter space is acceptable for attaining a strong enough phase transition for baryogenesis.</description><creator>Yamashita, Hiroki, 1981-</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Baryons.</subject><subject>Electroweak interactions.</subject><subject>Standard model (Nuclear physics) -- Mathematics.</subject><title>Electroweak phase transition and singlet Majoron model</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Hiroki Yamashita, 2007</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2j62s9015.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/c821gq133</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Physics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:r207tt416</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:17:57Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Amazonitic K-feldspar is characteristic of evolved granitic pegmatites of NYF (niobium-yttrium-fluorine) type, associated with A-type granite emplacement. In this work, I focus on four notable examples of such an association: (1) West Keivy, Kola Peninsula, Russia, (2) Saint-Ludger-de-Milot, Quebec, (3) Lac Sairs, Quebec, and (4) Morefield, Virginia. A fifth locality, the Broken Hill metamorphosed exhalative-type volcanogenic deposits in Australia, is an unusual type of amazonitic K-feldspar formed in an ore environment. A total of nineteen samples of amazonitic K-feldspar were characterized geochemically and mineralogically on the basis of X-ray diffraction, electron-microprobe and laser-ablation ICP-MS analyses. Lead, as an essential requirement for formation of the blue-green amazonitic color, has received particular attention. In every case, the analytical data show elevated amounts of Pb and rare alkalis, which strongly partition into the K-rich phase of the perthite intergrowth. Unusual micrometric grains, highly enriched in Pb, are found in cracks in the material from West Keivy. Some of the grains represent a new mineral species, a Pb-dominant feldspar. The presence of amazonitic K-feldspar in a granitic pegmatite is more than a curiosity. It can shed light on important petrogenetic issues such as metasomatic rejuvenation of crustal rocks prior to regional melting in a period of extension.</description><creator>Sokolov, Maria, 1969-</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Amazonite -- Analysis.</subject><subject>Laser ablation.</subject><subject>Pegmatites.</subject><subject>Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry.</subject><title>Characterization of Pb and selected trace elements in amazonitic K-feldspar</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Maria Sokolov, 2006</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dv13zz36n.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/r207tt416</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:x059cc570</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:17:57Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Recently, the assumption that marine populations are demographically open due to long-distance larval dispersal has increasingly been challenged. Here we present a large-scale, multi-year survey of blue mussel ( Mytilus spp.) abundance and recruitment along the Southern shore of the St. Lawrence Estuary, Quebec. Using spatial statistical tools we detected significant positive cross-covariance between upstream adults and downstream recruitment at a 14-35 km scale. Adult abundances in subsequent surveys proved to be best explained by past patterns of recruitment, rather than growth indices, or the local supply of recruits. Fucus spp., large macroalgae with much shorter planktonic periods, displayed no evidence of dynamic coupling. Recruitment was instead correlated with growth rate, indicating that local conditions may drive rates of reproduction by Fucus spp. plants. These results provide the first direct quantification of spatio-temporal demographic coupling between adult production and recruitment using survey data, with consequences for metapopulation and marine reserve design.</description><creator>Smith, Geneviève Kathleen.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Mytilus edulis -- Saint Lawrence, Gulf of.</subject><subject>Shellfish populations -- Saint Lawrence, Gulf of.</subject><title>Scales of coupling between benthic adults and larval recruits in the St. Lawrence Estuary</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Geneviève Kathleen Smith, 2006</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tb09j948j.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/x059cc570</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:44558j32k</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:17:58Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>After over thirty years of research and development, Discrete EVent system Specification (DEVS) has been widely accepted and applied in the Modelling and Simulation community. Recently, standardizing DEVS formalism and expanding DEVS application have become major challenges for DEVS researchers. In this thesis, we present our efforts to facilitate the process of DEVS modelling, and to promote DEVS standardization and application. The Infrastructure for DEVS Modelling and Experimenting provides facilities to facilitate the DEVS modelling process at four different levels. At the modelling level, a visual DEVS modelling environment has been built, in which DEVS models can be created graphically, and simulator-neutral model representation in modelling language Modelica can be generated automatically. At the model verification level, a Modelica Model Compiler has been developed, by which the simulator-neutral model representations are checked automatically and translated into simulator-specific model representations. At the simulation level, simulation trace has been standardized using the XML DTD. Interfaces for generating standardized simulation trace represented in XML for Python DEVS has been provided. At the model validation level, a Visual DEVS Trace Plotter has been developed, by which the standardized DEVS simulation trace in XML can be plotted visually.</description><creator>Song, Hongyan, 1970-</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Computer Science.</subject><title>Infrastructure for DEVS modelling and experimentation</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Hongyan Song, 2006</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3j3336583.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/44558j32k</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:sx61dr37p</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:17:58Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Leishmania parasites are reliant on salvage mechanisms to acquire purines from the extracellular environment.

Quaternary structure analysis indicates that LmGMPR forms tetramers and higher order complexes under reducing conditions. Kinetic assays reveal that the enzyme deviates from hyperbolic behaviour with regard to GMP but conforms to typical Michaelis-Menten kinetics for NADPH. Sequence analysis indicates that LmGMPR contains CBS domains and an MPA binding site. MPA competes for the NADPH binding site with a K i of 20 muM. ATP and GTP regulate enzymatic activity through inhibition and activation, respectively. This data indicates that LmGMPR is a novel enzyme that performs a highly regulated step in Leishmania purine metabolism.</description><creator>Smith, Sabrina A.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Leishmania -- Molecular genetics.</subject><subject>Purines -- Metabolism.</subject><subject>Leishmania -- Metabolism.</subject><title>Characterization of a novel Leishmania guanosine 5'-monophosphate reductase</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Sabrina A.
