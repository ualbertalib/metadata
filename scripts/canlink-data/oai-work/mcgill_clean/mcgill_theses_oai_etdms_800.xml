The scanning tunneling microscope (STM), invented in 1980 by Gerd Binnig and Heinrich Rohrer at IBM, and related scanning probe microscopes such as the atomic force microscope are among the most advanced instruments yet built to explore our world at the nanometer and even subnanometer level. This thesis describes the construction of a computer controlled scanning tunneling microscope, the characterization of its performance, and some results that have been obtained using the microscope including atomic resolution images of highly oriented pyrolytic graphite. What is believed to be the first polymer to polymer tunneling junction is also described as the first step towards an all polymer STM. The lessons learned from the construction of the STM will be applied in the design of future nanoscale structures.</description><creator>Madden, Peter Geoffrey Alexander</creator><contributor>Hunter, Ian (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1996</date><subject>Engineering, Biomedical.</subject><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>Construction of a digitally controlled scanning tunneling microscope</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/76537307b.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3j333437x</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biomedical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:6108vd52x</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T21:11:03Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Most low bit rate speech coders employ linear predictive coding (LPC) which models the short-term spectral information within each speech frame as an all-pole filter. In this thesis, we examine various methods that can efficiently encode spectral parameters for every 20 ms frame interval. Line spectral frequencies (LSF) are found to be the most effective parametric representation for spectral coding. Product code vector quantization (VQ) techniques such as split VQ (SVQ) and multi-stage VQ (MSVQ) are employed in intraframe spectral coding, where each frame vector is encoded independently from other frames. Depending on the product code structure, "transparent coding" quality is achieved for SVQ at 26-28 bits/frame and for MSVQ at 25-27 bits/frame. Because speech is quasi-stationary, interframe coding methods such as predictive SVQ (PSVQ) can exploit the correlation between adjacent LSF vectors. Nonlinear PSVQ (NPSVQ) is introduced in which a nonparametric and nonlinear predictor replaces the linear predictor used in PSVQ. Regardless of predictor type, PSVQ garners a performance gain of 5-7 bits/frame over SVQ. By interleaving intraframe SVQ with PSVQ, error propagation is limited to at most one adjacent frame. At an overall bit rate of about 21 bits/frame, NPSVQ can provide similar coding quality as intraframe SVQ at 24 bits/frame (an average gain of 3 bits/frame). The particular form of nonlinear prediction we use incurs virtually no additional encoding computational complexity. Voicing classification is used in classified NPSVQ (CNPSVQ) to obtain an additional average gain of 1 bit/frame for unvoiced frames. Furthermore, switched-adaptive predictive SVQ (SA-PSVQ) provides an improvement of 1 bit/frame over PSVQ, or 6-8 bits/frame over SVQ, but error propagation increases to 3-7 frames. We have verified our comparative performance results using subjective listening tests.</description><creator>Loo, James H. Y.

A finite element software was used for the geometry development, laminate configuration, and for predicting failure using the maximum stress criteria. A load case and boundary conditions simulating actual riding conditions were developed. The stresses in each of the composite layers were found to be lower than the allowable stresses because of a properly designed geometry and laminate. Two composite frames were fabricated using the hand lay-up technique, using unidirectional and woven carbon fiber pre-preg material over an internal foam core. Using static testing techniques and comparisons with traditional tubular frames, the carbon fiber prototypes were shown to be better in all rigidity aspects. Combining the experimental and theoretical results, a good understanding of the critical problems related to composite monocoque bicycle frame design was obtained.</description><creator>Lizotte, Patrick L.</creator><contributor>Lessard, Larry B.

Many of these structures show signs of aging which mainly consist of deterioration of concrete surfaces due to erosion and freeze-thaw cycles. Repair of these deteriorations requires the use of materials which are available from a wide variety of manufacturers. Most of the time informations on the various physico-mechanical properties of such repair materials are insufficient or unavailable. This thesis, in addition to furnishing a complete guide on the repair materials and techniques of deteriorated concrete surfaces, gives the results obtained from the inquiry realized among various organizations around the world owners of hydraulic structures together with those from a laboratory study conducted on repair materials not tested previously by Hydro-Quebec. In this particular study, the following physico-mechanical properties were investigated: thermal compatibility with the concrete substrate, shrinkage, permeability, bond strength, compressive strength and freeze-thaw resistance. The results of both the inquiry and the laboratory study show the following: (1) epoxies are not suitable for the repair of the concrete surfaces located on hydraulic structures; (2) cement mortars and latex-modified cement mortars are the repair materials which perform the best on hydraulic structures; (3) physico-mechanical properties of cement mortars are improved when they are subjected to a wet cure while those of the latex-modified cement mortars are when they are subjected to 24 hours wet cure followed by a dry one; (4) cement mortars are generally more thermal compatible with concrete substrates when compared to latex-modified cement mortars; (5) shrinkage, which is generally larger on latex-modified cement mortars, greatly influence the performance of repair mortars.</description><creator>Lapointe, Robert.</creator><contributor>Mirza, S.

We propose a CDMA-like multiple-access scheme which utilizes this inherent spreading for broadband cellular indoor wireless communications. The intra-cell multiple-access is by time division while the inter-cell interference is reduced via combined frequency and code division. The frequency bands of adjacent cells overlap to increase bandwidth efficiency. We consider the interference between spread-spectrum signals with partially overlapping spectra and apply the results to the analysis of this cellular system. The uplink and downlink are considered with and without cell sectorization. The downlink is used for obtaining certain system design parameters and for comparing the merits of different pulse shapes. We finally compare the proposed scheme with the usual TDMA/FDMA and CDMA schemes. The proposed scheme is found to require less bandwidth compared to the usual TDMA/FDMA scheme. However, CDMA requires a lesser bandwidth than the proposed scheme since it employs powerful very low rate channel coding techniques.</description><creator>Krishnamurthy, Prashant Venkatanarayana.</creator><contributor>Leib, Harry (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1996</date><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>A combined frequency, code and time division multiple-access technique for broadband indoor wireless communications</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/w6634576d.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0c483m14v</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:d791sj24t</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T21:11:07Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>A study was conducted on the reaction of solid MgO formed from magnesite (MgCO$ sb3),$ with Cl$ sb2$ and CO gas, in a stirred tank reactor containing a liquid bath of MgCl$ sb2.$ The reaction rate was found to be controlled by CO mass transfer from the gas to the liquid phase and was zero order with respect to the concentration of MgO. At temperatures from 743 to $824 sp circ$C, the reaction rate exhibited an activation energy of 80 kJ/mol, which is typical of a diffusion controlled reaction. The chlorinaton rate was effected by both temperature and CO/Cl$ sb2$ ratio and estimates of the optimum conditions were obtained: temperature $(856.6 sp circ$C) and ratio of CO/Cl$ sb2$ (1.24). The addition of an inert gas (N$ sb2)$ to the reagent mixture was found to decrease the reaction rate. Iron was found to have a negligible effect on reaction rate at the levels tested (up to 560 P.P.M.).

The manipulator consists of a circular disk which rolls without slip on the non-grounded rigid links of each of three 2R serial legs. The first portion of the thesis is devoted to the review of the geometric and mathematical tools used in the kinematic analysis. Planar isometries and group theory are used in the developmental of the inverse kinematics (IK) algorithm. Kinematic mapping and Grobner bases are important for the forward kinematics (FK) algorithm. After six important geometric properties of the manipulator are identified, the IK algorithm is developed. It is based on the decomposability and commutativity of planar displacements. The four step algorithm provides closed form analytic solutions. The algorithm may be used on similar parallel manipulators with any number of 2R legs, and hence, applies to a whole class of manipulators. It will be shown that there can be no more than 4$ sp{n}$ real solutions, where n is the number of 2R legs. Three numerical examples are given. The FK problem is solved using kinematic mapping. To employ a technique from the literature, pseudo inputs must be used to specify joint parameter inputs. The resulting set of three non-linear equations in three unknowns is solved using Grobner bases theory. A numerical example is given. Finally, velocity and acceleration analysis are performed after the determination of the Jacobian matrix.</description><creator>Hayes, Matthew John D.</creator><contributor>Zsombor-Murray, Paul J.

This thesis will identify the analog test requirements through an extensive analysis of integrated circuit testing, possible error sources, and the different levels of test hierarchy. The results will show that analog testing requires spectrally pure, high-quality predictable test signals. These signals are most robust when reproduced through digital techniques such as direct digital frequency synthesis. Delta-sigma ($ Delta Sigma$) modulation is perhaps the most versatile technique, as it can precisely encode arbitrary analog waveforms into a pulse-density modulated (PDM), infinite-length, single bit-wide pattern. The noise-shaping characteristics of the $ Delta Sigma$ modulator also allow for simple reconstruction of the embedded signal. Unfortunately, on-chip signal generation using this method is currently hindered by the high area overhead and limited programmability of $ Delta Sigma$ modulation oscillators. We will introduce the concept of forcing the PDM pattern to be finite in length and thus periodic. Although other periodic encoding algorithms exist, forced-periodic PDM patterns will be shown to be far superior for their precise control over signal amplitude, frequency, phase, and also for their ability to encode an arbitrary waveform. Its effectiveness will be demonstrated with several experiments of single- and multi-tone waveforms of varying degrees of complexity. By creating a fixed-length pattern, we can take advantage of many common digital built-in self-test (BIST) concepts such as scan and RAMBIST, found on most digital and mixed-signal integrated circuits, to supply the necessary hardware. We will show how analog signal generation can be integrated into digital ICs using any or all of the IEEE 1149.1-1990 standard, embedded RAMs, and scan chains. These applications will indeed prove that with very little additional hardware, on-chip, high-quality analog signal gene</description><creator>Hawrysh, Evan M.

The cylinder is considered at rest in a uniform undisturbed flow at infinity, in the direction perpendicular to the cylinder axis. Assuming that the Reynolds number R based on cylinder radius b is very small but not zero ($R ll 1$), and the Reynolds number Re based on cylinder length l is of order unity, the force per unit length of the cylinder, correct to the order of R, is obtained, first for a general flow direction and then for the case of flow perpendicular to the cylinder axis. This is done by using the Naiver-Stokes equations in long slender bodies theory and applying matched asymptotic expansions in terms of the ratio $ kappa$ of radius to body length. Flow field around the cylinder is calculated and the equation of particle motion is developed by applying Newton's second law of motion. The initial particle velocity far from the cylinder is calculated analytically and the particle trajectory course is solved numerically as an initial value problem by using Richardson Extrapolation and the Bulirsch-Stoer method. The collision Efficiency E is obtained by trial and error and is plotted against the dimensionless particle parameter p for different values of R (from 10$ sp{-6}$ to 1). The numerical calculations show that the curves have a tendency to move to the right and become like a straight-line as R gets very small. The points at which E is less than 0.005 are also predicted.</description><creator>Hashemi Mohammadabad, Saeed.</creator><contributor>Ven, T. G.

An alternative vehicle is proposed in the form of crystalline ferric arsenate, or the mineral scorodite (FeAsO$ sb4$.2H$ sb2$O). The precipitation of scorodite from sulphate-based effluents at ambient pressure (95$ sp circ$C) was investigated using a supersaturation controlled precipitation technique. This technique has been used to precipitate scorodite from chloride-based solutions. Test work using NaOH showed that amorphous ferric arsenate precipitation was avoided even at very high supersaturation levels ($&gt;$70). This was in sharp contrast with the results obtained in the chloride system (supersaturation $&lt;$10). The use of NaOH resulted in very slow precipitation kinetics and a low yield of arsenic precipitation but nevertheless scorodite was produced at 95$ sp circ$C. Particle growth through seed recycling was demonstrated, as was the moderate negative effect of increased sulphate concentration on the precipitation kinetics. By replacing NaOH with Mg(OH)$ sb2$ much improved precipitation kinetics were obtained. The slow addition of ferric ions to sulphate solutions containing arsenic was also found to precipitate scorodite. Decreasing pH values resulted in faster Fe(III) addition rates, and below the induction pH (pH$ rm sb{ind}$) for amorphous ferric arsenate, all Fe(III) could be added at once. Higher seed concentrations below pH$ rm sb{ind}$ led to much improved scorodite precipitation kinetics and yield. Increased Fe:As ratios in solution were shown to have a strong negative effect on the kinetics and yield of scorodite precipitation. The scorodite samples produced in this work exhibit slightly higher solubilities (0.7 ppm (As) at pH = 5 versus 0.1 ppm (As)) compared to scorodite produced from chloride and nitrate solutions.

Available experimental data on the detonation velocity are compared with theoretical CJ calculations using two different detonation codes (IDeX and Cheetah). IDeX uses the Theostar equation of state (EOS) for the fluid phase and the Murnaghan EOS for the solid phase while Cheetah uses the JCZ3-EOS for the fluid species and the OLD-EOS for the solid phase. Large deviations are observed for heterogeneous explosives with a large mass fraction of inert material. This is credited to the different relaxation times of the various equilibration processes in the detonation zone, as well as the complex shock interactions between the fluid and solid phases. The equations of state used for the detonation products are found to have only a small effect on the equilibrium CJ state. A more realistic EOS for solids is proposed.</description><creator>Dionne, Jean-Philippe.</creator><contributor>Lee, John H. S.

Using this experimental database and previous studies on the subject, an idealized model of minimal detail but complete structure is proposed using the principles of beam bending, the constraining effect of the drill hole on the drill string and simple relationships for bit rock interaction. Next, the proposed model is programmed digitally to produce a longhole drill deviation simulator, which is first checked for self consistency and stability and then verified against the experimental field results obtained earlier. The model's prediction agrees, within the known working limits of the simulator, with the trends observed in the field as regards to the effects of pipe weight, hole inclination, hole length and feed force. In addition, the model's prediction shows the crucial importance of geology on the observed deviation process and the three-dimensional nature of drillhole deviation. Because of its scientific basis, the model can be further developed to include additional factors when required.</description><creator>Chabot, Louis.</creator><contributor>Daneshmend, Laeeque K.

The results obtained with PEO and the cofactors (SNS, MPR, and CAR), are discussed in terms of the association-induced polymer bridging mechanism. Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) of polymer solutions revealed that each of the three cofactors are forming complexes with PEO. CAR radically increased the apparent diameter of the PEO chains, and MPR seems to decrease it. In latex suspensions, the SNS was found very efficient in the sequence latex-polymer-cofactor (LPC), increasing the PEO hydrodynamic layer thickness (HLT). Flocculation experiments with the help of a Photometric Dispersion Analyser (PDA), with PEO only (no cofactor) suggested that the fines are composed of more than one component. SNS was found to make all the fines alike by adsorbing on them. Adding the PEO after SNS gave homoflocculation. As a result, the specific surface of fines, calculated by PEO adsorption was found to be 0.223 m$ sp2$/g. The association-induced polymer bridging mechanism can happen in three different manners depending if the cofactor and the polymer are adsorbing onto fines. When neither of PEO nor cofactor adsorb onto the collector, the PEO/cofactor association-complexes bridge the particles (van de Ven and Alince (1996)). When the cofactor (e.g. SNS) and the polymer adsorb onto the fines, in the sequence fines-cofactor-polymer (FCP), with a chemical ratio cofactor/PEO of 3/1, adsorption of the PEO chains onto cofactor-coated fines is likely to occur at the beginning followed by the flocculation of the fines. In the sequences fines-polymer-cofactor (FPC), when the polymer adsorbs onto the fines and the cofactor adsorbs (e.g. SNS) or not (e.g. MPR), a reenforcement of the bondstrength was noticed.

The objective was to develop a means to determine machine health, while operating on-line, without reference to an expert. This approach is based on processing acquired vibration data with artificial neural networks (ANN's). A case study, based on data obtained from the monitoring of locomotives at the Iron Ore Company (IOCC). Real time data patterns, profiles and trends, obtained by processing vibration signals from various points on locomotives, were used to test the developed technique. The results indicate that observed patterns and trends can be classified into categories that reliably indicate the mechanical state of the equipment. An implemented system will assist maintenance personnel at this mine to identify the trends of a developing component problem in advance of catastrophic failure. In addition the system will be able to predict its remaining life prior to catastrophic failure. Thus, a machine could be reliably and safely operated until just prior to failure of a component. The thesis work is a sub-component of a larger project at IOCC, to implement a mine-wide predictive/preventative maintenance program for pumps, locomotives, trucks, shovels and drills at their open-pit mine in Labrador City, Newfoundland. This system will use intermittent on- and off-line, condition monitoring based on ANNs and expert systems (ES). A functional overview is discussed. The data would identify where and what is the particular machine alarm condition. Such an approach would allow improved fault detection of machine components, especially in mines where trained personnel are not readily available.

Photolysis of $ rm H sb2O sb2$ produces hydroxyl radicals ($ cdot$OH), which are very powerful oxidizing species. The effluent consisted of a "heat condensate" obtained from toxic vapors generated during various stages of the pulping process. Several operational parameters were varied and their effects on the process were observed and analyzed, in order to achieve its optimization. In addition, heterogeneous photocatalysts such as cupric oxide (CuO) were also investigated as a complement to the photooxidation process. The main parameter used to determine the quality of the wastewater before and after photooxidation was the Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), using a closed reflux standard procedure. COD values of the treated solution were determined at subsequent time intervals and used to draw curves illustrating the rate of oxidation of the wastewater. Other parameters, such as Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC) and dissolved lignin concentration, were investigated towards the end of the research in order to obtain a more complete characterization of the quality of the wastewater after treatment. The experimental data reveal that there is an optimal $ rm H sb2O sb2$ concentration that is best suited for the photooxidation of the effluent. Moreover, an increase in temperature accelerates the rate of elimination of COD. An increase in effluent concentration is detrimental to the speed of the process, since it causes an increase in its absorbance which can act as a barrier against UV light. The efficiency of the photooxidation process is not affected by variations in the initial pH of the wastewater. Cupric oxide (CuO), when exposed to UV light, efficiently catalyzes the production of OH radicals and is therefore very beneficial to the photooxidation process.</description><creator>Boissinot, Philippe.</creator><contributor>Kubes, G.

The bond strength was studied through both transverse and longitudinal splitting cracks and a relative bond effectiveness of the corroded bars was determined from the crack spacing. Different stages of the corrosion were established to study their relative bond behaviour, ranging from no corrosion to complete corrosion at the steel-concrete interface. These stages have been achieved by using an accelerated corrosion method. An electrochemical method was used to accelerate corrosion within the specimens. Direct current was applied for increasing periods of time to the reinforcing bar embedded in the tension specimens, immersed in a concentrated sodium chloride solution (5% NaCl). The reinforcing bar served as anode, while a steel bar in water served as the cathode. The chloride content of the concrete plays an important role in the rate of corrosion. Chloride content was obtained for each tension specimen using the Volhard Method. Bond strength decreases rapidly with an increase in the corrosion level, especially in the case of any severe localized corrosion. It has been found that the first level of corrosion, which is 4 percent weight loss due to corrosion, resulted in a 9 percent decrease of nominal bond stress, while the sixth level of corrosion, with a 17.5 percent weight loss, resulted in a 92 percent weight loss of nominal bond stress. Bond behaviour is influenced by deterioration of the reinforcing bar ribs, and by reduced adhesion and cohesion of the reinforcing bar due to widening of the longitudinal splitting crack resulting from corrosion.

In order to study the interaction between Hex A and GM$ sb2$ activator, the human GM$ sb2$ activator cDNA was cloned into the p-FLAG vector. The fusion protein (FLAG-AP) was expressed in E. coli, and purified to homogeneity using immunoaffinity chromatography. A retardation assay was designed using the immunoaffinity column to detect transient interactions between FLAG-AP and Hex A. Hex A and Hex S are retarded by the column, but not Hex B or unrelated proteins. Hex A retardation is absolutely dependent upon the presence of immobilized FLAG-AP, but does not require the presence of GM$ sb2$ ganglioside. Interaction of GM$ sb2$ activator and Hex A does not involve the enzyme's active site, but does appear to depend upon hydrophobic interactions between the two proteins.</description><creator>Yadao, Franeli M.

TTMPLW also protected mice against Klebsiella pneumoniae infection. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of these three peptides on cytokine (TNF-$ alpha$ and IL-6) production and nitric oxide (NO) release by bone marrow macrophages (BMM). The peptides alone were incapable of stimulating cytokine production or NO release in naive or IFN-$ gamma$-primed BMM. However, when BMM were coincubated with the peptides (1.0 $ mu$M) and LPS (100 ng/ml), an augmentative effect on TNF-$ alpha,$ IL-6 and NO production was observed. The peptides increased the response of BMM to stimulation with LPS in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Of the three peptides, TTMPLW (0.01, or 1.0 $ mu$M) had the greatest augmentative effect on NO production by LPS-stimulated BMM. Tumor necrosis factor-$ alpha$ production peaked after 4 hr stimulation, and decreased rapidly thereafter. Among three peptides, TTMPLW induced the highest amount of TNF-$ alpha$ production at a concentration of 1.0 $ mu$M. When used at a concentration as low as 0.01 $ mu$M, TTMPLW and PGPIPN, but not LLY, potentiated TNF-$ alpha$ production. All the peptides (1.0 $ mu$M) stimulated IL-6 production by BMM, which plateaued after 12 hr. The auto/paracrine TNF-$ alpha$ produced by LPS-stimulated BMM was partially responsible for release of NO. After all the TNF-$ alpha$ was neutralized, release of NO was reduced by about 21% (P $&lt;$ 0.01). However, neutralization of IL-1$ beta$ and IL-6 did not have any effect on NO production by LPS-stimulated BMM. These results demonstrate that bovine casein peptides can costimulate naive macrophages with LPS for proinflammatory cytokine production and NO release and may play a role in host defense against pathogens.</description><creator>Xiao, Chaowu, 1962-</creator><contributor>Zhao, Xin (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1996</date><subject>Peptides.</subject><subject>Macrophages.</subject><subject>Cytokines.</subject><subject>Casein.</subject><subject>Nitric oxide.</subject><title>The effect of bovine casein peptides on cytokine and nitric oxide production by macrophages</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bc386m42s.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/js956h91b</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Animal Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:j3860894b</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T21:11:19Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>We investigated whether human lysosomal hydrolases, in common with secretory and plasma membrane glycoproteins, associate with the ER chaperone calnexin. Neither $ alpha$- or $ beta$-chains of $ beta$-hexosaminidase A, cathepsin D, nor the endogenous proteases cathepsins B or L associated with calnexin in COS-I cells. Hex $ alpha$-chains misfolded due to either the incorporation of azetidine-2-carboxylic acid, treatment with dithiothreitol, or the presence of a Tay-Sachs Disease mutation (leading to retention of Hex A $ alpha$-chains in the ER) also did not associate with calnexin. Chemical-crosslinking reagents or long-term labeling also failed to show a Hex A $ alpha$-chain association with calnexin. Lysosomal hydrolases also did not associate with the ER chaperone calreticulin. Surprisingly, $ alpha$-L-iduronidase and Hex A $ alpha$-chains associated with calnexin when overexpressed using a CMV promoter. The segregation of lysosomal hydrolases from secretory proteins thus occurs at an earlier stage than predicted.

This investigation was designed to characterize the textural development and composition of apatite. Representative samples were taken from three traverses: the NW suite is the most pristine. Apatite is found primarily as a post-cumulus (or intergranular) phase, but becomes a cumulus mineral in the quartz gabbro. The apatite is F-rich; Cl and OH contents decrease from the base of the complex upward. Apatite in the OF has higher inferred levels of OH. In the SIC, Cl and OH decreased relative to F upon vapour saturation of the evolving melt. The concentrations of LREE, up to 2 wt% La$ rm sb2O sb3+Ce sb2O sb3+Nd sb2O sb3,$ are higher in apatite near the base of the complex. The chondrite-normalized REE patterns, and $ sp{87}$Sr/$ sp{86}$Sr ratios (0.707-0.708), are similar in apatite from each rock type of the Main Mass. The SIC evolved normally by fractional crystallization of a single batch of basic magma, which likely resulted from an impact-generated crustal melt. Apatite from the SW section and, to a lesser extent, the NE section, has significantly lower levels of Cl and LREE; the $ sp{87}$Sr/$ sp{86}$Sr ratio has also been reset (up to 0.739). Local recrystallization during metamorphism thus led to remobilization of these elements from apatite.</description><creator>Warner, Stephen.</creator><contributor>Martin, Robert F.

Computational and analytical methods are used in conjunction with bifurcational techniques to simulate the structural characteristics of the orientational patterns that arise by stretching discotic nematic liquid crystalline materials. The analytical and numerical results are in excellent agreement with actual cross-sectional fiber textures obtained by melt spinning carbonaceous mesophases. This work reproduces the main structural features of the oscillatory zig-zag pattern commonly observed in mesophase carbon fibers, and identifies the process conditions that lead to this peculiar fiber texture. In addition, the temperature driven texture transitions and the emergence of random pattern also observed during the industrial manufacturing of mesophase carbon fibers are captured by the simulations and thoroughly explained using classical viscoelastic theories of liquid crystalline materials.</description><creator>Wang, Lei.</creator><contributor>Rey, A.

Although it has been established that prior knowledge does have a strong impact on later learning, it is not clear how this effect manifests itself. Previous research suggests that one way to examine the effects of knowledge on learning is to compare subtasking, that is, dividing a task into subsets, to unstructured learning, or learning "all-at-once". Neural network simulations using the cascade-correlation learning algorithm predict that subtasking facilitates learning when it involves learning a function that is compatible (i.e., logically consistent) with the rest of the task, and hinders learning when it involves learning a function that is incompatible with the rest of the task (Tetewsky, Shultz, &amp; Takane, 1995). Two experiments were conducted to test these predictions using a concept learning task, measuring the number of trials required for participants to correctly classify 16 stimuli, consisting of key images defined by four binary dimensions, into two groups based on a relationship between the stimulus dimensions that was either simple or complex. The results indicated that the simple subtasking condition provides a good example of the effects of function compatibility, in that depending on what regularity participants extract in the first subset, learning of the rest of the task is facilitated or hindered as compared to all-at-once learning. The complex condition shows that some participants extracted a function in the first subset that was compatible with the rest of the task, thus facilitating learning as compared to all-at-once learning. However, for other participants, the knowledge acquired in subtasking is inaccessible in later learning. These findings provide evidence for the psychological validity of the simulations. Implications to part-whole transfer and applications in concept learning research are discussed.</description><creator>Varshney, Nicole Memorice.</creator><contributor>Shultz, Tom (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1996</date><subject>Transfer of training.</subject><subject>Learning, Psychology of.</subject><subject>Concept learning.</subject><title>The effects of prior knowledge on concept learning : an issue of function compatibility</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sn00b0897.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/w6634577p</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Psychology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:kh04dr632</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T21:11:23Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The response of Arabidopsis thaliana (Columbia) to infection with turnip mosaic virus (TuMV) was characterized at the level of: disease symptom expression, cell content and protein composition. Visual symptoms observed were chlorotic and mottled leaf colouring, severely stunted growth, distortion of leaf blades and delayed bolting. All plants died before seed cases dehisced. Electron microscopy revealed three types of cylindrical inclusion bodies: pinwheels, scrolls and laminated aggregates, in the cytoplasm of infected plants similar to those observed in other plants infected with TuMV. Inoculation of Arabidopsis with TuMV resulted in quantitative changes in several proteins in both soluble and membrane proteins, as revealed by electrophoresis on 12% polyacrylamide gels. Antibodies were made to both infected membrane and soluble proteins. Western blots of infected and uninfected, soluble and membrane proteins probed with antibodies revealed quantitative changes in the same proteins identified by polyacrylamide gels. A CNBr 4B activated sepharose column was used to make infection-specific antibodies to infected soluble proteins. No infection-specific host proteins were detected in Arabidopsis infected with TuMV.</description><creator>Syme, Jennifer.</creator><contributor>Fortin, M. G.

While CgA is believed to be important for cell secretory activity, its precise function(s) remain to be fully elucidated. The effects of the active metabolite of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D$ sb3$ (1,25(OH)$ rm sb2D sb3)$ were investigated on parathyroid gland CgA mRNA in the rat. Parathyroid CgA mRNA levels increased in a dose-dependent manner in response to injections of 1,257(OH)$ rm sb2D sb3$ whereas PTH mRNA levels decreased. CgA mRNA levels were less sensitive to 1,25(OH)$ rm sb2D sb3$ than PTH mRNA levels. Having established in vivo regulation of CgA by 1,25(OH)$ rm sb2D sb3,$ the potential role of altered expression of CgA in the pathophysiology of secondary hyperparathyroidism (2$ sp circ$HPT) was explored using the uremic rat model. Five-sixth (5/6) nephrectomized rats maintained on a normal diet had normal levels of serum calcium and phosphate but reduced levels of 1,25(OH)$ rm sb2D sb3.$ In these uremic rat parathyroid glands, whereas PTH mRNA levels were four-fold higher, CgA mRNA levels were 50% lower that those in sham-operated rats. In uremic rats maintained on a high phosphorus diet, 5/6 nephrectomy resulted in decreased serum calcium and 1,25(OH)$ rm sb2D sb3$ levels. These animals had elevated parathyroid CgA and PTH mRNA levels. Thus, in vivo, increased serum 1,25(OH)$ rm sb2D sb3$ concentrations stimulate, and decreased serum levels inhibit parathyroid CgA mRNA expression. However, this latter effect depends upon the calcium status of the animal.
