The enzymes responsible for  protein arginine methylation have been classified in three groups. Type I enzymes  promote the formation of both NG-monomethylated and asymmetric o-NG,NG-dimethylated  arginines (aDMA). Type II enzymes catalyze the formation of monomethylated and  symmetrical o-N G,N'G-dimethylated arginines (sDMA). The type III enzyme found in  yeast catalyzes the monomethylation of the delta-guanidino nitrogen atom of the  arginine residue. Although some abundant proteins have been described as being  substrates for arginine methyltransferases for some time, there are still few known  proteins to bear this modification. The primary goal of the work presented in this  thesis was to identify new arginine methylated proteins and functionally  characterize the roles of arginine methylation in new cellular processes. First, we  generated four arginine methyl-specific antibodies: ASYM24 and ASYM25 are specific  for aDMA whereas SYM10 and SYM11 recognize sDMA. Cell extracts were used to purify  the protein complexes recognized by each of the four antibodies and the proteins  were identified by microcapillary reverse-phase liquid chromatography coupled on  line with electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). The analysis  of 2 tandem mass spectra for each methyl-specific antibody resulted in the  identification of 247 proteins, of which 197 are putatively arginine  methylated. The DNA repair MRE11/RAD50/NBS1 (MRN) complex was purified using  one of the aDMA specific antibody. Since a role of protein arginine methylation in  DNA damage checkpoint control and DNA repair had not been previously reported we  chose to investigate the consequence of MRE11 methylation in DNA damage. Our results  show that the MRE11 checkpoint protein is arginine methylated as determined by mass  spectrometry and methylarginine-specific antibodies. The glycine-arginine rich (GAR)  domain of MRE11 was specifically methylated by protein arginine methyltransferase 1  (PRMT1). Mutation of the arginines within MRE11 GAR domain severely impaired the  exonuclease activity of MRE11. Cells treated with methyltransferase inhibitors  displayed a DNA damage-resistant DNA synthesis phenotype and prevented the  re-localization of the MRN complex to sites of DNA damage. Downregulation of PRMT1  with small interfering RNAs (siRNA) also yielded a damage-resistant DNA synthesis  phenotype that was rescued with the methylated MRE11 complex. Taken together, the  work presented in this thesis allowed the identification of many new potentially  arginine methylated proteins and demonstrated a novel role for arginine methylation  in the regulation of DNA repair enzymes and of the intra-S phase DNA damage  checkpoint.</description><creator>Boisvert, François-Michel</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Biology, Cell.</subject><title>A role for arginine methylation in DNA repair /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/j9602113d.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ws859g11z</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Experimental Medicine</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:xp68kg83m</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:20:34Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Java programs are deployed in a bytecode format that is executed  by a Java virtual machine (JVM). JVM performance is determined by several major  components: execution engine, garbage collector, and threading system. The static  compilation and optimization approach, such as taken in C/C++ compilers, does not  fit in Java's execution model very well because Java allows dynamic class loading,  lazy resolution, just-in-time (JIT) compilation, and garbage collection. These  dynamic features presents new challenges to JVM designers. In this thesis, we study both the challenges and opportunities  of dynamic optimizations in Java virtual machines. Our contributions include a new  garbage collector using dynamic techniques and dynamic interprocedural program  analyses for speculative optimizations in JIT compilers. We present a novel approach for reducing garbage collection  frequencies. Instead of relying on an ahead-of-time escape analysis or a  region-based type system, our approach adapts regions based on the runtime history  of an application. By freeing regions with associated stack frames, the system can  reduce the frequency of garbage collections. We present the overall idea and provide  details of a specific design and implementation. Dynamic class loading is a two-edged sword. A JIT compiler can  speculatively optimize methods base on loaded classes only. However, newly loaded  classes may invalidate previous optimization assumptions. We review existing  techniques supporting speculative optimizations, including runtime guards, code  patching, and on-stack replacement. We present an improvement and implementation of  an on-stack replacement mechanism. A call graph is necessary for developing interprocedural program  analyses. Call graph construction in a Java virtual machine needs to overcome the  difficulties of dynamic class loading and lazy reference resolution. We show a  general approach to adapt static type analyses to dynamic versions suitable for  building call graphs in a JIT environment. We also introduce a new call graph  profiling mechanism using code stubs. Having dynamic call graphs, we study reachability-based  interprocedural analysis. We describe a general type analysis framework for  supporting speculative method inlining in a JIT environment. Several popular type  analyses were implemented in the framework, including an interprocedural one, VTA  [SHR+00]. Using the framework, we present the results of a limit study of method  inlining and report our findings and experience. In each chapter we discuss the related work for that chapter's  topic. At the end of the thesis, we point out future research  directions.</description><creator>Qian, Feng, 1973-</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Computer Science.</subject><title>Runtime techniques and interprocedural analysis in Java virtual machines</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mg74qm50d.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xp68kg83m</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:9k41zd98q</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:20:35Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>We examine the sensitivity of the ATLAS detector to  extra-dimensional scalars in scenarios having the extra-dimensional Planck scale in  the TeV range and n = 2 large extra dimensions. Such scalars appear as partners of  the graviton in higher-dimensional supersymmetric theories. Using first the scalar's  lowest-dimensional effective couplings to quarks and gluons, we compute the rate of  production of a hard jet together with missing energy. We find a nontrivial range of  bulk scalar couplings for which ATLAS could observe a signal, and in particular,  higher sensitivity to couplings to gluons than to quarks. Bulk scalar emission increases the missing-energy signal by  adding to graviton production, and so complicates the inference of the  extra-dimensional Planck scale from the observed rate of jet + EmissT . Because bulk  scalar differential cross sections resemble those for gravitons, it is unlikely that  these can be experimentally distinguished should a missing energy signal be  observed. However, given, for example, the Supersyminetric Large Extra Dimension  (SLED) scenario, which can provide a framework for a solution to the cosmological  constant problem, the D-dimensional Planck scale is approximately fixed and so is  the graviton production rate. An excess of events would then be due to graviton  superpartners like bulk scalars. Next, we identify the lowest-dimension interaction which is  possible between Standard Model brane fields and bulk scalars. The lowest-dimension  interaction is unique and involves a trilinear coupling between the Standard Model  Higgs and a bulk scalar. We compute its influence on Higgs physics at ATLAS and  identify how large a coupling can be detected at the LHC. Besides providing a  potentially interesting signal in Higgs searches, such couplings provide a major  observational constraint on 6D large-extra-dimensional models with scalars in the  bulk. Finally we consider the Universal Extra Dimensions scenario in  which all the SM fields propagate. Tree-level KK number conservation dictates that  the associated KK excitations cannot be singly produced. We recalculate the cross  sections obtained by Macesanu et al. for the direct production of KK excitations of  the gluon, g*, and two distinct towers of quarks, q• and q°, in  proton-proton collisions at the LHC. According to the SLED scenario, these KK states  will quickly decay in a parton plus a graviton. We find that the LHC mass bound for  KK quark and gluon final states is 2675 GeV at its nominal luminosity of 100  fb-1.</description><creator>Beauchemin, Pierre-Hugues</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Physics, Elementary Particles and High Energy.</subject><title>Phenomenology of bulk scalar production at the LHC</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ft848r01p.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9k41zd98q</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Physics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:pc289j44p</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:20:35Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Neurons transform analogue input into digital representations  (i.e. spike trains) that can be communicated to other neurons. In the process of  incorporating information from different sources, representations are modified.  These modifications constitute computations. This is particularly relevant in the  pain system where, according to the gate control theory, sensory input from multiple  modalities as well as cognitive information influence the relationship between  noxious input and pain perception. Much of this control is exerted in the spinal  dorsal horn, including lamina I, but the biophysical basis for those computations  remains unknown. This thesis aims to elucidate basic computational processes  involved in signal processing by single neurons, especially as they relate to  nociceptive processing by neurons in lamina I. Intrinsic cellular properties of  lamina I neurons were characterized using a spinal slice preparation and whole cell  patch clamp recordings. The neuron population is divisible into four classes on the  basis of spiking pattern. Neurons from different classes encode information in  fundamentally different ways. Subsequent investigation revealed that tonic neurons  act as integrators because of voltage-dependent inward currents that prolong  subthrehsold depolarizations and allow repetitive spiking. Single spike neurons, on  the other hand, act as coincidence detectors because of their predominant outward  current. Encoding mode (integration vs. coincidence detection) determines the  information transmitted by each cell type. Inhibition is also known to play an  important role in nociceptive processing. It has been debated whether shunting  inhibition is able to divisively modulate firing rate (i.e. implement gain control).  Results presented here demonstrate that divisive modulation by shunting inhibition  depends on background synaptic noise and dendritic saturation. Further analysis  reveals that effects of noise can be understood o</description><creator>Prescott, Steven A.</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Biophysics, General.</subject><subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</subject><title>Signal processing by single neurons : biophysical mechanisms and implications for nociception</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mc87pq80w.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pc289j44p</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:bg257f61t</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:20:36Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Biomass is a term for all organic materials that stem from  plants. It has wide applications as a source of fuel and as a raw material for  different chemical stocks. A method in which hydrogen fuel is produced from  renewable biomass is proposed. Hydrogen can subsequently be used as a feed for fuel  cells to generate electricity. It can also be applied in other energy producing  processes. The developed method makes advantage of the reactivity of water under  hot, compressed environment. Dissolution of willow as a model compound representing biomass  was studied in 200-350°C temperature range. A 95% dissolution of willow was  achieved. Lignin and hemicellulose in willow were fragmented and dissolved at a  temperature of 200°C and at a pressure of 100 bar (10 MPa). Cellulose was  dissolved at 320°C. Rapid hydrolysis of lignin, hemicellulose and cellulose  to oligomers and glucose is proposed as the evolution mechanism. Recondensation  behavior of the dissolved oligomers was identified as the main challenge for  dissolution. A continuous flow process for dissolution was found effective in this  regard. The process of converting biomass-derived compounds into gases  was also studied. Glucose was used as a model compound to characterize the chemistry  of biomass gasification. Successful gasification of 0.1 M glucose solution to a  mixture of H2, CO2 and CH4 gas was achieved by using Pt/Al2O3 as a catalyst.  Qualitative analyses of liquid residues showed that the main decomposition products  in the liquid phase were alcohols and carboxylic acids. Concentrated glucose  solutions were found to be reactive forming undesired precipitates during  gasification. This was found to be problematic in the catalytic gasification  process. A new processing concept and a new reactor design were proposed to solve  this problem. Findings presented in this thesis showed that hot, compressed  water provided an alternative to corrosive chemicals and toxic solvents,  facilitating utilization of biomass as a source of renewable fuel and as a source of  chemical stocks.</description><creator>Hashaikeh, Raed</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Engineering, Chemical.</subject><title>Hydrothermal dissolution of biomass and gasification to hydrogen</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zs25x907w.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bg257f61t</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mining, Metals and Materials Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:c821gk28w</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:20:36Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>From the association of the epsilon4 allele of apolipoprotein  (apo) E with Alzheimer's disease (AD) to the more recent reports of reduced risks of  developing the disease when taking cholesterol lowering agents, links seem to point  for a central role for lipoprotein metabolism in the AD brain. While the association  with apoE4 is the strongest and most reproduced risk factor for AD, roles for other  proteins involved in lipoprotein metabolism in the periphery have not been  thoroughly investigated. Using the entorhinal cortex lesion (ECL) paradigm in human  apoE-targeted replacement mice we examine whether apoE4 has effects on reactive  synaptogenesis in the absence of the concentration bias observed in human and how  these effects are mediated. In a second study, again using the ECL model, we  investigate the role of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) in the brain in response to injury.  Finally, we study the effect of intronic polymorphisms of the LPL on the risk and  severity of AD. The results show that mice expressing apoE4 have impaired  astroglial organization resulting from an exacerbated inflammatory state and  culminating into reactive synaptogenesis impairment. We also observe  isoform-specific tau phosphorylation and beta-amyloid (Abeta) accumulation.  Furthermore, we report that LPL plays a role in the degeneration phase following  ECL. We propose that it is involved in the recycling of lipids together with the  glial-specific proteoglycan syndecan-4. Finally we report associations between LPL  polymorphisms and AD risk and severity. Since the polymorphisms associate with  increased expression of LPL in AD brain as well as with increased senile plaque  number, we propose that LPL may be involved in amyloid clearance and  deposition. Taken together these results confirm the importance of  lipoprotein metabolism in AD as apoE and LPL are both involved in maintaining  cholesterol homeostasis in the brain and also both participate in Abeta  metabolism.</description><creator>Blain, Jean-François</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</subject><title>Modulation of lipoprotein metabolism in response to brain inury and Alzheimer's disease : roles for apolipoprotein E4 and lipoprotein lipase</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/w0892b33x.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/c821gk28w</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Neuroscience</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:4j03d0185</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:20:36Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The performance of a resolution-based automated theorem prover  (ATP) depends on the speed at which clauses are derived and the efficiency at  pruning the search space. The speed at which clauses are derived depends in part on  the number of operations performed to construct derived clauses. Depth-first search  based ATPs derive clauses in a linear manner. In linear derivations, a large  percentage of the derived clauses are intermediate conclusions that are discarded  shortly after they are derived. Therefore, the time spent constructing those clauses  is wasted. In this thesis we present a stalling strategy, called delayed  clause-construction (DCC), that reduces this wasted time by delaying the  construction of intermediate conclusions until they are needed. Top-down depth-first search algorithms have the disadvantage of  deriving the same clauses over and over again. Bottom-up best-first search  approaches solve this problem by redundancy elimination, but their disadvantages are  the lack of goal-orientation and the large memory requirements. In this thesis we  introduce semi-linear resolution (SLR), a top-down bottom-up search procedure that  combines advantageous characteristics found in best-first search and depth-first  search algorithms. It requires a modest amount of memory and includes redundancy  control. SLR relies on DCC for speed. DCC also provides SLR with ability to perform  large inference steps through the use of a mega-inference rule. In order to improve the efficiency of SLR, we developed a  restriction strategy, called attribute sequences (ATS), that uses sequences of  clause characteristics as a guide to limit the participation of clauses in a linear  derivation, thereby reducing the explorable search space . ATS does not compromise  completeness. The performance enhancements ensuing from the use of DCC and ATS  in SLR are shown in this thesis to be quite significant in theory, through  mathematical analysis, and in practice, through the results obtained from CARINE; an  implementation of SLR.</description><creator>Haroun, Paul</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Computer Science.</subject><title>Enhancing a theorem prover by delayed clause-construction and attribute sequences</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dz010q498.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4j03d0185</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:9w032354s</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:20:37Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In most species, highly sophisticated global regulatory networks  regulate the expression of genes in response to environmental and physiological  demands. The mechanisms devised control virtually every event involved in  transcription and translation, as well as influencing mRNA degradation, protein  stability, protein localization, protein-protein interactions, and protein function.  In order to understand the general mechanism used by several organisms to control  gene expression, three regulatory proteins were investigated using nuclear magnetic  resonance (NMR) techniques. The systems studied were proteins involved in the  control of gene expression at the transcriptional (YaeO, Chapter 2),  posttranscriptional (CsrA, Chapter 3) and translational levels (aIF2Pbeta Chapter  4). YaeO is a protein involved in the regulation of Rho-dependent  transcription termination in bacteria. The solution structure of YaeO was solved,  the first for a Rho inhibitor, and it was demonstrated that that YaeO binds to the  primary RNA binding domain of Rho. This study suggests that YaeO inhibits  transcription termination by blocking the primary RNA binding site in  Rho. The carbon storage regulator A from E. coli is a protein  involved in the post-transcriptional control of numerous genes involved in  carbohydrate metabolism in bacteria. It has been shown that CsrA prevents  translation of its target mRNA by blocking access to the ribosome binding site. The  binding studies, together with the structure of CsrA, reveal the potential RNA  binding region. A model for CsrA recognition of its target mRNAs is also  proposed. The last section focuses on the archaeal translation initiation  factor IF2beta. This protein is a key regulator of overall protein synthesis. The  structure of aIF2beta was solved and bound zinc was proved to be necessary for the  structural integrity of this translation factor. The function of aIF2beta in  translation initiation was rationalized in terms of its structure and available  structural data for translation factors aIF2alpha and aIF2gamma.</description><creator>Gutierréz, Pablo, 1977-</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Biology, Molecular.</subject><title>Structural studies of regulators of protein expression</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/wh246s53h.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9w032354s</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biochemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:zw12z578w</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:20:37Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The objective of the thesis was to investigate the effects of  nonionic surfactants on the dissolution and biodegradation of polycyclic aromatics  hydrocarbons (PAHs) from a multicomponent non-aqueous phase liquids  (NAPLs). The extent of solubilization of the PAHs in the surfactant  micelles increased linearly with the PAH mole fraction in the NAPL. The  micelle-water equilibrium partition coefficient of both PAHs was found to increase  with the size of the polar shell region of the micelle rather than the hydrophobic  core of the micelle and the presence of PAHs in the shell region of the micelles was  confirmed by 1H-NMR analysis. Competitive solubilization effects were also  observed. The process of dissolution of the PAHs in surfactant aqueous  solutions was investigated with particular emphasis on the influence of the  surfactant molecular structure and dose on the kinetics of the solubilization  process. The solubilization of both PAHs was limited by the rates of desorption of  mixed micelles from NAPL and their rates of diffusion at high concentrations of  surfactant. It was found that the dissolution rates were directly related to the  length of the alkyl portion of the surfactant. The micellar volume also seemed to  affect the rates. The addition of surfactants resulted in an enhancement of  biodegradation rates at the initial stages because of the rapid partitioning of PAHs  from micelles into the aqueous phase where uptake occurs. But at latter period,  biodegradation was severely limited by the dissolution of PAHs into the true aqueous  phase.</description><creator>Bernardez, Leticia Alonso</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Engineering, Environmental.</subject><title>Surfactant effects on solubilization, dissolution and biodegradation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons from non-aqueous phase liquids</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/q811kk085.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zw12z578w</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Civil Engineering and Applied Mechanics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:9z9030426</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:20:37Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The glutamate uptake system is a critical component contributing  to the regulation of extracellular glutamate concentrations in the brain. Under  hyperammonemic conditions, however, extracellular levels of glutamate are elevated  (Michalak et al., 1996). This thesis project (submitted as four articles) presents  an examination of ammonia's effects (and factors that result from ammonia exposure)  on the high affinity glutamate uptake system in cultured astrocytes and  neurons. In Article 1, the effects of ammonia on the glutamate uptake  system in cultured astrocytes were investigated. Ammonia exposure resulted in a loss  of high affinity glutamate transport along with a reduction in the mRNA and protein  expression of the glutamate transporter EAAT1. Similarly, in Article 2, ammonia  exposure led to a loss in high affinity glutamate transport in cultured neurons. In  contrast, protein levels of neuronal EAAT3 were unchanged suggesting that ammonia  suppresses the high affinity glutamate uptake system in neurons at the level of  transporter function. Lactate is known to inhibit high affinity glutamate transport  and lactate accumulation is a consistent observation in hyperammonemic syndromes  (Chatauret et al., 2001). In Article 3, we investigated lactate production in  cultured astrocytes exposed to ammonia. Ammonia exposure resulted in elevations in  lactate levels and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity. Subsequent studies revealed  increases in astrocytec LDH-5 expression as well. Multinuclear NMR studies  demonstrated elevations in lactate synthesis and transient reductions in high energy  phosphate levels suggesting that ammonia exposure leads to a compromised energy  status that is compensated by alterations in metabolism. Oxidative stress is an adverse consequence of hyperammonemia in  brain (Kosenko et al., 1997). Furthermore, generation of free radical species and  lipid peroxidation have inhibitory effects on the high affinity glutamate transport  (Volterra et al., 1994). In Article 4, we demonstrate that the ammonia-induced  reduction of high affinity glutamate transport in cultured astrocytes is partially  restored by exposure to antioxidants. Subsequent studies revealed significant  increases in lipid peroxidation products in treated cells and that co-exposure of  ammonia with antioxidants again led to a protective effect on glutamate uptake and a  lowering of levels of lipid peroxidation products. Furthermore, inhibition of nitric  oxide synthase had a protective effect on ammonia's suppression of astrocytic  glutamate transport as well as the generation of lipid peroxidation products. These  data suggest that oxidative stress involving nitric oxide synthesis is a  contributing factor to the ammonia-induced suppression of glutamate  uptake. The data presented in these four articles clearly demonstrate  that the high affinity glutamate uptake system is adversely affected by ammonia  exposure in cultured astrocytes and neurons. Gaining a further understanding of the  mechanisms which are responsible for these effects may lead to finding targets for  future therapeutic intervention for hyperammonemic syndromes.</description><creator>Chan, Helen</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</subject><title>Cell-selective effects of ammonia on glutamate transporter expression and function in cultured neural cells</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mk61rh49w.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9z9030426</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Experimental Medicine</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:ww72bc03h</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:20:38Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>There is growing consensus that health-related quality of life  (HRQL) outcomes are important for the allocation of scarce medical resources and for  facilitating clinical decision-making. However, because most instruments of HRQL are  self-report measures inappropriate conclusions may be drawn from studies that assess  changes in HRQL over time or between groups. If the individuals evaluating  themselves experience a response shift (defined as changes in their internalized  standard of evaluating their level of functioning, in their values, or in their  conceptualization of the target construct), then measures taken over time or between  groups are no longer comparable. To date, response shift has not been formally  assessed in the stroke population, and only to a limited extent in the HRQL field.  The global objective of this thesis was to examine how the experience of recovering  from a stroke modifies people's perception of their health-related quality of life  (HRQL), and the extent to which response shift occurs during the first six months  post-stroke. The first study used structural equation modeling for data from  a prospective cohort to evaluate response shift by examining changes in a  theoretical model of HRQL based on the measurement model of the Medical Outcome  Study 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36). This study found no evidence of  reconceptualization and changes in internal standards over time, but suggested that  if response shift does occur with stroke it is likely to be mediated by the event  itself and not the recovery process. Two subsequent studies evaluated response shift  using the then test (a retrospective assessment of HRQL) and an individualized  measure of HRQL. The data collection for these studies was incorporated into a  randomized controlled trial. The results from the then test provided support for the  occurrence of response shift among persons with stroke with no such effect in a  control group. Changes on the individualized measure of HRQL showed that individuals  with stroke experienced a reconceptualization and a change in values between 6 and  24-weeks post-stroke. A final comparison of the three techniques evaluated in this  thesis provided the basis for proposed guidelines for future assessments of change  in HRQL based on the comparative feasibility and validity of the methods. To date,  there is evidence to show that individuals undergoing changes in physical health  experience changes in internal standards of health and values. If response shift is  not measured and accounted for, inappropriate conclusions regarding the impact of a  disease such as stroke or the efficacy of a treatment intervention may go  unnoticed.</description><creator>Ahmed, Sara, 1974-</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Health Sciences, Public Health.</subject><title>Response shift and health-related quality of life post-stroke</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/b8515n91s.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ww72bc03h</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:2b88qc63v</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:20:38Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The eighteenth century was a period ripe with challenges for  hospitals in France. Denounced as ineffective, inefficient and even inhumane  institutions, hospitals found themselves at the centre of a growing debate over the  administration of health care and welfare. Although dismissing the hospital's  traditional role as a refuge for the poor, the indigent and the sick, many reformers  believed that this institution still could play a valuable social role. Thus, while  contemporaries lashed out against the large, "abuse-ridden," hopitaux  generaux and hotels-Dieu , small hospitals were seen in a more favourable light. For  the growing number of contemporaries who argued that hospitalisation should be  reserved exclusively for the sick, hospitals containing a small number of beds were  promoted as better disposed and better equipped to meeting the health-care needs of  the community. At the same time, contemporaries began calling for the  decentralization of health care and welfare services. Instead of focusing these  services in large regional poor-relief institutions, reformers argued that the poor  and the sick would be better served by receiving assistance in their own community,  either in small parish hospitals, or within their own home (secours a  domicile). This dissertation examines how hospitals and hospital services  in the late eighteenth-century generalite of Rouen responded to this growing  hospital reform movement. It shows that many of the policies adopted by the region's  hospital administrators reflected the contents of the larger "national"  debate on health care and welfare reform. More importantly, the military was behind  many of the changes affecting hospital services in this region During the eighteenth  century, military hospitals became a model to emulate towards making the  "reformed" hospital a reality. However, imposing military-style health  standards on the region's civilian hospitals proved to be a complicated process, one  that often involved a great deal of negotiation and compromise.</description><creator>Robichaud, Marc</creator><contributor>Boulle, Pierre H.

In multicultural Canada, educators,  curriculum developers, textbook authors and policy makers rely on available  literature to inform their decision-making processes. Mainstream media, as a source  of information and insight, do not fill this need. In this inquiry, I examine the cross cultural and educational  experiences of ten Arab undergraduate students in two English-language universities  in Montreal. Participants were from Libya, Tunisia, Algeria, and Morocco and have  been in Canada for three to seven years. Classic qualitative methodological tools of in-depth interviews,  participant observation and document analysis were employed to record, analyze and  interpret the experiences of these students. In order to give voice to these  students' insights and experiences, a narrative approach is used in presenting and  interpreting the data. Seven themes identified as educational issues emerged from the  analysis: Student-Teacher Relationship; Teaching Methodology; Democratic dialogue in  the classroom; Teaching and learning foreign languages; Examinations; Research and  Library Facilities; and Problems encountered in interactive classroom. Two themes,  identified as cultural issues, emerged: Canadians' Perceptions of Arabs and Muslims  from the perspectives of the participants; Islamic dress (hijab) and Sex-segregated  relationships. The analysis revealed differences in culture, language, and  social and educational systems between these students' countries of origin and  Canada as the major sources of these students' positive and negative experiences.  The study concludes that Canadian educators can assist these students by becoming  aware of their home culture, different learning styles, frustrations in adjusting to  school life and in overcoming cultural shock; and by helping them adjust to Canadian  educational system and learn about the Canadian culture.</description><creator>Abukhattala, Ibrahim</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Arabs -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal -- Attitudes</subject><subject>Arab Canadians -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal -- Attitudes</subject><subject>College students -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal -- Attitudes</subject><title>Educational and cultural adjustment of ten Arab Muslim students in Canadian university classrooms</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qz20st03m.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/jm214p56t</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Integrated Studies in Education</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:np1939606</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:20:39Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This dissertation studies three aspects of airfoil flows: (i)  second-order theoretical solutions of airfoils in steady flows; (ii) unsteady  solutions for oscillating flexible airfoils; and (iii) numerical analysis of airfoil  flows at low Reynolds numbers. The first part presents simple and efficient analytical  solutions in closed form for the velocity and pressure distributions on airfoils of  arbitrary shapes in steady flows, which are obtained using special singularities in  the expression of the fluid velocity. A second-order accurate method is first  developed for airfoils in inviscid incompressible flows to simultaneously solve the  symmetric and anti-symmetric flow components defined by coupled boundary conditions.  Then, the method is extended to take into account the viscous and compressibility  effects on the pressure distribution. The resulting solutions were found to be in  very good agreement with the available exact solutions (for specific airfoils), and  with numerical and experimental results at various Mach and Reynolds numbers and  moderate angles of attack. The second part presents a new method of solution for the  analysis of unsteady incompressible flows past oscillating rigid and flexible  airfoils. The method has been successfully validated by comparison with the results  obtained by Theodorsen and by Postel and Leppert for rigid airfoil and aileron  oscillations in translation and rotation. The aerodynamic stiffness, damping and  virtual mass contributions are specifically determined, as required in the  aeroelastic studies. In all cases studied, this method led to very efficient and  simple analytical solutions in closed form. The third part presents an efficient numerical method for the  incompressible flows past airfoils at low Reynolds numbers, which are of interest  for micro-aircraft applications. The present analysis is based on a pseudo-time  integration method using artificial compressibility to accurately solve the  Navier-Stokes equations. Solutions are obtained with this method for airfoils at  various incidences and very low Reynolds numbers between 400 and 6000. A detailed  analysis is presented for the influence of the Reynolds number, incidence and  airfoil shape on the pressure distribution, lift and drag coefficients. The flow  separation is especially studied; the separation and reattachment positions are  compared for various airfoil shapes, incidences and Reynolds  numbers.</description><creator>Abdo, Mohammed</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Engineering, Mechanical.</subject><title>Theoretical and computational analysis of airfoils in steady and unsteady flows</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/d217qq03d.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/np1939606</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mechanical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:pc289j45z</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:20:39Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Oxytocin-estrogen interactions are critical to the  neuroendocrine and behavioural changes that occur in the maternal rat. The question  that remains is whether these interactions mediate the expression of individual  differences in maternal care and the generational transmission of this behaviour.  Maternal licking/grooming (LG) is a normally distributed, stable behaviour in the  lactating rat that is transmitted to female offspring. Levels of oxytocin receptor  (OTR) binding in the medial preoptic area (MPOA), a region critical for maternal  behaviour, are elevated in females exhibiting high vs . low levels of LG. Central  administration of a selective OTR antagonist reduces LG behaviour in High LG females  to levels comparable to those observed in Low LG females, supporting the functional  role of these receptors in LG. The female offspring of High and Low LG mothers  differ in estrogen sensitivity in the MPOA. Ovariectomized, estrogen-treated female  offspring of High LG mothers exhibit increased OTR binding and Fos immunoreactivity  whereas the offspring of Low LG mothers show no estrogen-mediated increases.  Estrogen up-regulation of OTR levels is known to involve estrogen receptor alpha.  Levels of estrogen receptor alpha in the MPOA are elevated in High LG compared to  Low LG mothers and their female offspring. Mesolimbic dopamine activity is a  potential downstream target of estrogen-oxytocin interactions, and we have shown  that nucleus accumbens dopamine activity and levels of D1 and D3 dopamine receptors  are associated with high levels of LG behaviour. Adoption studies suggest that the expression of LG behaviour is  environmentally mediated. We have shown that gestational stress can reduce  licking/grooming behaviour of High LG mothers and that this reduction is correlated  to a stress-induced decrease in OTR binding in the MPOA. These behavioural and  neuroendocrine changes are long-term and are passed on to the female offspring of  these mothers. Post-weaning isolation also reduces maternal licking/grooming  behaviour and OTR binding in the offspring of High LG mothers. Conversely,  post-weaning social enrichment enhances LG behaviour and OTR binding in the female  offspring of Low LG mothers. Overall, these studies describe an environmentally regulated  estrogen-oxytocin mechanism that mediates the expression of natural variations in  maternal care in the rat.</description><creator>Champagne, Frances Anne</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</subject><title>Natural variations in maternal behaviour in the rat : neural mechanisms and environmental regulation</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/nc580n085.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pc289j45z</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Neuroscience</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:2v23vt84q</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:20:40Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis investigated the possibility of experimentally  increasing intimates' use of relationship maintenance responses, the strategies  thought to sustain romantic relationships. Because research has demonstrated that  constructs, traits, and goals can all be primed in order to affect behavior, priming  participants' relationship commitment and satisfaction, two correlates that promote  such strategies, was anticipated to similarly result in changes in maintenance  responding. The first three studies demonstrated greater maintenance responses in  women when they first thought about their commitment and satisfaction, but saw no  effects in men. In an attempt to explain this gender difference, a theory involving  relationship identification, a factor thought to underlie commitment, was proposed.  General relationship identification, or the incorporation of important relationships  into the self-concept, is seen more in women than it is in men. The theory was that  the commitment and satisfaction prime actually served as a relationship reminder and  activated the self-concepts of those who identify with their relationships, namely  women. Subsequently encountering relationship threats was therefore experienced as  threatening to the self-concept, and because people are motivated to protect their  self-concepts, they engage in greater relationship maintenance responding. To first  test this theory, in Study 3 a simple factual relationship reminder was shown to be  as effective as the relationship commitment and satisfaction prime at raising  women's maintenance responding. In Study 4, further demonstrating the role of  chronic relationship identification, only those women high in chronic relationship  identification showed the effect obtained in the previous studies. The involvement  of self-protection was again shown in Study 5, when women who were given the  opportunity to defend their self-concepts, without defending their relationships,  displayed lower main</description><creator>Burton, Kimberly, 1976-</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Interpersonal relations.</subject><subject>Commitment (Psychology)</subject><title>Relationship identification : increasing the use of romantic relationship sustaining strategies</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0v838104n.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2v23vt84q</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Psychology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:c247ds65j</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:20:40Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Emerging methods of combinatorial chemistry involve receptor  assistance to combine synthesis and screening. Binding to the receptor alters either  the thermodynamics or kinetics of synthesis. Dynamic combinatorial chemistry uses  reversible synthesis where binding to the receptor shifts the equilibrium to make  more of the best binders. In target-accelerated synthesis, binding of the starting  materials to the receptor speeds up the synthesis of the best-binding compounds. We  report a new receptor-assisted method---pseudo-dynamic combinatorial  chemistry---where binding to a receptor slows the destruction of the best-binding  compounds. In pseudo-dynamic libraries, synthesis and destruction of library members  are separate, irreversible reactions. Extending the destruction reaction amplifies  binding differences similar to a kinetic resolution of enantiomers. Initial  libraries of two to eight dipeptides, some containing an aryl sulfonamide moiety  that binds to carbonic anhydrase, showed that a ratio of &gt;100:1 of the best  binding dipeptide over the next best was possible. These experiments also suggested  that the selectivity is related to the number of compounds in a library, with more  library members producing higher selectivity (a highly desirable result opposite  that seen in traditional dynamic libraries). Expansion of these libraries to include  compounds containing sulfonamides, aryl sulfonamides, sulfamates and hydroxamic  acids further support postulations as to the origins of the high selectivity of  these systems, and take the number of compounds screened by a pseudo-dynamic library  closer to practical levels for drug discovery.</description><creator>Cheeseman, Jeremy D.</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Chemistry, Organic.</subject><title>Pseudo-dynamic combinatorial libraries : a receptor-assisted combinatorial chemistry approach to drug recovery</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/g732d949x.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/c247ds65j</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Chemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:qf85nb705</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:20:40Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Abstract not available.</description><description>Until now, historians have devoted relatively little attention to the rich field of patients' struggles with chronic progressive disease. This study proposes to begin to fill this lacuna by examining in detail the meaning and implications of one central principle of nineteenth-century clinical medicine: incurability. Though the judgement of incurability is the product of a medical encounter, its significance extended well beyond the clinic. For being incurable in nineteenth-century France was a social event in the broadest sense, putting the individual at the centre of a complex web of people with different expectations and duties. Patients and their farnilies sought relief and solace within the confines of their homes and, frequently enough, in hospital. The physician was expected to prognosticate and to heal, while women, usually members of the immediate family or a religious order, carried out the duties of daily care. Either by choice or institutional diktat, many incurably ill individuals were visited by a priest or some other representative of the Church. Finally, their lives were deeply influenced by the decisions of local and, to an ever increasing degree, national politicians mandated to tackle questions of charity and social policy. Each chapter of this thesis will examine facets of the experience of incurability within the context of existing social structures: medical, religious, economic, and political.</description><creator>Szabo, Jason</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Terminally ill -- France -- History -- 19th century</subject><subject>Terminal care -- France -- History -- 19th century</subject><subject>Diseases -- France -- History -- 19th century</subject><title>"Suffering, shame and the search for succour" : incurable illness in nineteenth-century France</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xk81jk89r.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qf85nb705</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of History</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:5t34sk10d</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:20:41Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Peripheral neuropathy associated with agenesis of the corpus  callosum (ACCPN or HMSN/ACC) is a severe polyneuropathy affecting both the  peripheral nervous system and the central nervous system. It is transmitted as an  autosomal recessive trait and is particularly frequent in the French Canadian  population of Quebec (Canada). The disease was linked to chromosome 15 in 1996 by  Dr. Rouleau's team. We genotyped polymorphic markers in the ACCPN candidate region  on chromosome 15 in over 67 patients and 200 control individuals. Observation of  affected haplotypes confirmed the presence of a founder effect in the French  Canadian population. Recombination analysis reduced the candidate interval to  approximately 2 cM between markers D15S1040 and ACTC on chromosome 15. Linkage  disequilibrium analysis suggested the gene resides nearest marker D15S1232. A  physical map of the newly refined candidate region was constructed using YAC, BAC  and PAC clones. These clones were used to confirm the position of candidate ESTs and  genes as being either within or outside the ACCPN candidate region. The connexin 36 gene, which was confirmed to reside within the  region, was excluded as the gene responsible for ACCPN using SSCP analysis. The  SLC12A6 gene was also confirmed to reside within the candidate interval and was  tested for mutations using SSCP, dHPLC and sequence analyses. We found a total of  four disease-specific mutations in SLC12A6, all of which are expected to truncate  the KCC3 protein (the protein produced by the SLC12A6 gene). Two of the four  mutations were identified in the French Canadian population; 80 French Canadian  ACCPN patients are homozygous for the c.2436delG in exon 18 and one French Canadian  patient is a compound heterozygote, having the c.2436delG mutation as well as the  1584_1585delCTinsG mutation in exon 11. Two additional mutations were identified in  one Turkish and one Italian family in exons 22 and 15 respectively. The effects of  the c.2436delG mutation on KCC3 function was studied in X. laevis oocytes and the  truncated protein is not functional. Finally, collaborators at Vanderbilt University  disrupted the slc12a6 gene in the mouse and found a phenotype similar to the human  disease. Identification of SLC12A6 as the gene mutated in ACCPN will  allow for accurate molecular diagnosis as well as carrier testing in the French  Canadian population. It is also the first step in understanding the molecular  mechanism leading to the disease.</description><creator>Howard, Heidi C.</creator><contributor>Rouleau, Guy A.

The time-delays are  considered to be present in the states and/or the outputs, and the uncertainties in  the system representation are of the parametric norm-bounded type. Both cases of  actuators, with and without saturation are studied, and the state-feedback and  output-feedback control designs are presented. Two methods for analysis and  synthesis of controllers are used: The first is based on the transfer function, and  the second on the use of functionals. In the context of the design method based on transfer functions,  the problem of Hinfinity output feedback design for a class of uncertain linear  continuous-time or discrete-time systems, with delayed states and/or outputs (only  for the continuous-time case), and norm-bounded parametric uncertainties is  considered. The objective is to design a linear output feedback controller such  that, for the unknown state and output time-delays and all admissible norm-bounded  parameter uncertainties, the feedback system remains robustly stable and the  transfer function from the exogenous disturbances to the state-error outputs meets  the prescribed Hinfinity norm upper-bound constraint. The output feedback structure  does not depend on the time-delay. The conditions for the existence of the desired  robust Hinfinity output feedback and the analytical expression of these controllers,  are then characterized in terms of matrix Riccati-type inequalities. In the  continuous-time context, both the time-invariant and the time-varying cases are  treated. Finally, examples are presented to demonstrate the validity and the  solvability of the proposed design methods. Still in the same context, the state-feedback robust  stabilization problem for neutral systems with time-varying delays and saturating  actuators is addressed. The systems considered are continuous-time, with parametric  uncertainties entering all the matrices in the system representation. The model used  for the representation of actuator saturations is that of differential inclusions. A  saturating control law is designed and a region of initial conditions is specified  within which local asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system is  ensured. Finally, the robust output-feedback stabilization problem for  state-delayed systems with time-varying delays and saturating actuators is  addressed. The systems considered are again continuous-time, with parametric  uncertainties entering all the matrices in the system representation. Two models are  used for the representation of actuator saturations: sector modeling and  differential inclusions. Saturating control laws are designed, and in the case of  differential inclusions, a region of initial conditions is specified within which  local asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system is ensured.

Dairy product (DP) restriction was assessed in 2091 prenatal class attendees.  Subsamples of 279 healthy pregnant and 175 exclusively breastfeeding women provided  repeat 24-hour dietary recalls which were used to estimate nutrient intake and to  assess dietary adequacy using adjusted nutrient distributions. Pregnancy outcome was  recorded. Pregnancy. DP restriction was reported by 13.2% (95% CI: 12.7%,14.1%) of  pregnant women. Significant differences were found in the proportion of restrictors  (Rs, 20.8%) below the calculated EAR for adjusted protein intakes vs. nonrestrictors  (NRs, 9.2%, chi 2 = 6.78, p = 0.009). Intake distributions of calcium and vitamin D  were compared to their respective Als for descriptive purposes and were lower for Rs  vs. NRs but dietary inadequacy could not be assessed. Infants of NRs weighed on  average 120 g +/- 468.9 g more than those of Rs but this difference was not  statistically significant (p = 0.06). However, in multiple regression analysis where  maternal weight gain, age, education and pregravid weight were controlled for,  restriction predicted a comparable loss in birthweight of 122.5 g's (p = 0.048) and  vitamin D intakes were positively associated with fetal growth. Lactation.  Restriction (≤250 ml milk/day) was reported by 23% (95% CI; 16%--29%) of  exclusively lactating women. Protein was lower than the EAR for 60% of Rs and 37.8%  of NRs (chi 2 = 6.22, p = 0.025). The proportion of Rs and NRs &lt; EAR from  diet differed for thiamin (15% vs. 0%, chi2 = 0.97, p &lt; 0.001), riboflavin  (15% vs. 1.5%, chi2 = 12.93, p &lt; 0.001) and zinc (65.0% vs. 34.8%, chi2 =  11.6, p &lt; 0.041). From diet and supplement intake vitamin D and calcium  remained lower for Rs compared to NRs but inadequacy could not be assessed or  compared. DP restriction was not associated with greater weight loss amo</description><creator>Mannion, Cynthia</creator><contributor>Gray-Donald, K. (Supervisor)</contributor><contributor>Koski, K. G.

Due to their peculiarity, some of these biomolecules could be  used advantageously for some industrial and health care applications. However, the  preparation of these biochemicals from its original source is highly impractical and  generally unfeasible for commercial purposes. Nevertheless, the advances in DNA  manipulation open the possibility of producing the recombinant proteins in different  organisms to allow a viable production and extraction on a commercial scale. Among  such particular proteins, the cunner-fish trypsin (CFT) is an enzyme with a high  potential for exploitation by the food processing industry. The CFT is a cold  adapted protease that has a proven ability to inactivate undesirable endogenous  enzymes during the processing of some foodstuffs. Thus, the CFT gene was  characterized and cloned in E. coli and Pichia pastoris for over-expression. A cDNA  library from pancreatic mRNA was screened using a salmon trypsin cDNA probe.  Positive clones harboring a cDNA insert of the predicted size were sequenced and a  full-length cDNA was obtained that contained an ORF encoding the zymogen and a  signal peptide. Multiple alignment of the gene sequence showed 85 to 90 per cent  identities with other fish trypsins and the deduced amino acid sequence for the  mature enzyme exhibited the entire characteristic features observed in trypsins. E.  coli expressed the recombinant CFT (rCFT) at levels higher than 20% in the form of  insoluble aggregates, while P. pastoris showed expression levels below 1%. Despite  the low expression, the yeast rCFT appeared to be correctly folded and could be  partially purified by immobilized nickel affinity chromatography. Trypsin-specific  activity was confirmed in the purified rCFT after digestion with bovine  enterokinase.</description><creator>Macouzet-García, Martin</creator><contributor>Simpson, B. K.

LOH analysis of ovarian tumors performed in the  laboratory of Dr. Tonin identified two minimal regions of deletion (MRD) at  3p25--p26 and 3p24, and a third region extending from 3p14 to the centromere. Based  on this study, I hypothesized that there are at least three tumor suppressor genes  (TSG)s on the 3p arm that function in suppressing ovarian tumorigenesis. In this  thesis, I utilized the novel technology of expression microarrays to identify  candidate TSGs based on differential patterns of expression in four  well-characterized EOC cell lines compared to a primary culture derived from normal  ovarian surface epithelium. MMCT of chromosome 3 into the EOC cell line, OV-90 that  harbors complete LOH of one 3p arm resulted in strong suppression of growth. Rapid  growth arrest was induced in OV-90 derived hybrids despite the presence of a somatic  mutation in TP53 coincident with allele loss at the gene locus. These results  suggest that at least one TSG on chromosome 3 is able to function independently of  TP53, consistent with the observation made in this thesis that LOH of 3p loci is not  significantly associated with somatic mutations in TP53. The acquisition of a growth  rate similar to OV-90 in sub-populations of two of the hybrids generated was  associated with four regions of deletion on the transferred chromosome 3 at  3p26-pter, 3p14--p21, 3p12--p13, and 3q26--q27, demonstrating the first functional  evidence for a TSG important in EOC that maps to each of these regions. Extensive  LOH analysis of the 3p25--p26 region of deletion previously identified allowed the  definition of a new MRD at 3p26.3 that overlaps the 3p26-pter interval identified in  the MMCT study.

Tracking can be accomplished by repeatedly visiting patches, but this sampling will  be economical only if its benefits outweigh its costs. I examined the effects of  patch characteristics and social factors on sampling using simulation models and  both large- and small-scale field experiments on eastern chipmunks ( Tamias  striatus). In the first experiment, chipmunks discovered large renewing patches  within a few days, sampled them frequently enough to detect most renewals, and then  decreased their sampling effort after renewal ceased, showing that they can track  patches over both long and short time scales. Sampling rate was higher for animals  that lived near the patch, for animals that were more aggressive while in the patch,  and when the number of other animals that sampled was high, but was unaffected by  the quantity and frequency of renewal. I developed a model, which predicts that the  optimal sampling frequency should increase with the frequency and duration of  renewal and with the rate of gain in the patch, and decrease with the duration of  each sampling trip. An extension of this model predicts that conspecifics will  affect even non-group foragers, by competing for food and providing social  information. A second field experiment showed that chipmunks decreased their  sampling in response to higher competition. Although chipmunks used social  information to discover a patch, there was no indication that social information  caused a decrease in sampling. In conclusion, sampling to keep track of varying  patches is an important component of the foraging behaviour of chipmunks. Optimal  sampling behaviour is affected by patch characteristics and sampling rate will  depend on (i) the ease with which animals can estimate these characteristics, (ii)  the level of competition, which can alter the patch valu</description><creator>Hall, Carolyn L.</creator><contributor>Kramer, Donald L.

It is generally accepted that the cortex on one side  of the brain mediates visual processing within contralateral visual space and  controls the generation of contraversive saccades that move the center of gaze to a  new location within contralateral visual space. Because of this lateralized schema  of brain function, human patients that have had a cerebral hemisphere removed  (hemispherectomy) provide an useful model to study how adaptive mechanisms enable  visual processing and saccade control by one hemicortex together with both sides of  the brainstem. Previous studies of hemispherectomized patients indicate that,  contralateral to their ablated hemicortex, conscious visual perception never  recovers although crude control over saccadic eye movements does. Here I present a  number of new findings that have arisen from extensive studies of saccade generation  in two hemispherectomized patients. First, I have found that hemispherectomized  patients are able to generate accurate saccades ipsilateral to the intact hemicortex  indicating that a single hemicortex can obtain excellent ipsiversive saccade control  rather than the crude control seen previously. Second, I have found that deficits  seen previously for saccades generated contralateral to their intact hemicortex  (i.e., to targets in their intact hemifield) can be largely explained by strategies  used to optimize the evaluation of a visual scene when half the visual field is  absent due to hemianopia. Third, I have found that hemispherectomized patients use  an elegant saccadic search strategy in order to locate unseen visual stimuli within  their blind hemifield. Moreover, when they are forced to abandon this search  strategy they are unable to saccade to unseen targets within their blind hemifield.  Finally, I have found evide</description><creator>Herter, Troy</creator><contributor>Guitton, D.
