Concept mapping was used to alter a student's learning approach from a non-creative to a creative approach. Students were then post-tested using the LASSI to evaluate the learning intervention. The first hypothesis proposed that non-creative learners would become more holistic and creative learners as a result of the concept mapping intervention. No significant treatment effects were found. Non-creative learners made significant gains in concentration from pre to post testing. It was also hypothesized that certain demographic variables would help explain the learning approach a student demonstrated. Science students had the highest mean attitude, motivation, concentration and time management and use of test strategies. Anthropology students had the highest anxiety, and arts students increased on information processing. Nineteen year olds were the most motivated and attitude decreased with age. Second year students who had taken a previous course in anthropology had higher mean attitudes, motivation, concentration, selecting main ideas, and use of test strategies when compared to second year students who hadn't taken a previous course. Science students increased their mean use of test strategies regardless of previous course work. Overall, the mean use of test strategies increased regardless of faculty affiliation had a student taken a previous course.</description><creator>Moxness, Katherine</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Learning, Psychology of</subject><subject>Concept learning</subject><title>The effects of concept mapping on learning approach and meaningful learning /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pg15bg14d.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bc386k533</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Educational Psychology and Counselling</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:p2676w77f</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:00:42Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The present experiment was designed to investigate the effects of staging (the sequencing of information) and readers' prior content knowledge on the on-line processing and acquisition of procedural text information. An "expert model" of the procedure was used to manipulate text staging as well as to evaluate readers' processing and comprehension of the procedure. The experimental design consisted of four experimental groups, with six subjects in each group. Subjects at two levels of prior knowledge, experts and novices, were randomly assigned to read one of two differently staged texts, hierarchical and enactment. Various properties of the frame model were used to predict subjects' performance. The experimental design was a mixed between-within subjects repeated-measures multivariate design. Statistical analyses of data obtained from subjects' reading times and verbal protocols coded against the expert model provided support for a frame construction model of text processing where readers use a top-down application of grammar rules for selectively processing high level procedural information as it becomes available. Both text staging and prior content knowledge affected readers' comprehension on-line. It appears as though these processes are highly automatic since prior content knowledge had limited significant on-line effects.</description><creator>Roy, Marguerite Claire</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Knowledge, Theory of</subject><subject>Reading comprehension</subject><title>The effects of prior knowledge and staging on the processing and comprehension of procedural text /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sj139308s.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/p2676w77f</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Educational Psychology and Counselling</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:m326m294n</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:00:42Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis draws on twenty-three women's retrospective accounts of their abortion experiences to examine the course of their feelings and the social, situational and personal contexts in which these feelings arose. Their experiences and feelings were affected by abortion's morally ambiguous status; its quasi-legal status (particularly between 1969 and 1988); its provision in medical settings in ways that differ significantly from the provision of other health services; and the on-going polarized ideological conflict over its acceptability. The experiences and feelings of the women interviewed were also affected subtly and profoundly by widely held expectations about how women in such situations normally do and should feel. The thesis examines the "feeling rules" (Hochschild, 1979) women encountered in interactions with others (confidants and health-care providers, notably abortion counselors) and how women's actual feelings, especially after the abortion, became problematic.</description><creator>Olijnek, Darcie</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Abortion -- Psychological aspects</subject><title>What makes abortion a difficult experience</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/fj2363188.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/m326m294n</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Sociology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:pz50gx314</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:00:43Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Le Survenant and Marie-Didace, the only two novels of Germaine Guevremont, present a character who today is considered a legend, "coureur des bois" and globetrotter, seducer and agent of changes. Many characteristics relate him to the hero archetype as defined by C. G. Jung, but also, and more specifically, to the figure of Christ, savior, Messiah and accomplisher of promises. His behavior, as well as his experiences are often similar, if not identical, to those of Jesus, as represented in the New Testament. Exegesis, "mythanalysis" and sociology offer many paths for the study of the role of the Survenant, compared to Jesus Christ, in Quebecois literature and society in the first half of the 20th century.</description><creator>Martin, Stéfanie</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Guèvremont, Germaine.

Nutrient intake, especially for the small ruminants with small gastro-intestinal capacity compared to metabolizable energy requirement, will be near or below maintenance if these poor quality feeds are not supplemented. High quality supplements however, are beyond the reach of the small scale farmers. The effect of feeding maize husk and leucaena as a mixture or separately on voluntary intake of maize husk was studied over a 40 day period. Ten male goats with an average weight of 15 kg were used. In a separate experiment the effect of browse supplementation on maize husk utilization by goats was studied. The treatments were; maize husk plus urea; maize husk plus Leucaena leucocephala (3:2); maize husk plus Calliandra calothyrsus (3:2); and maize husk plus leucaena plus calliandra (3:1:1). The results of the study indicate that leucaena and calliandra are both potentially valuable feed components.</description><creator>Phiri, Donald Mwelwa</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Goats -- Zambia -- Feeding and feeds.</subject><subject>Lead tree.</subject><subject>Calliandra calothyrsus.</subject><subject>Goats -- Feeding and feeds.</subject><title>The effect of leguminous browse supplementation on maize husk utilization by goats indigenous to the eastern province of Zambia /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sf268632m.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/x920fx90r</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Plant Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:0z708x81t</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:00:43Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Cercariae of the digenean Plagiorchis noblei penetrate and kill a variety of aquatic larval dipterans. The present study determined whether these parasites can infect blackfly larvae, and established what biotic and abiotic factors affect parasite acquisition and the survival of infected hosts in the laboratory. Four species of blackfly larvae, Prosimulium mixtum, Simulium vittatum, S. decorum, and Stegopterna mutata, were exposed to cercariae in flowing water. Prevalence and intensity of infection of all species varied directly with exposure intensity and decreased with increasing water velocity, prevalence increased with larval size. Infection levels were higher for P. mixtum. The production of silk strands by the blackfly larvae and their persistence at low water velocities may facilitate parasite acquisition. Mortality among infected larvae of all species was three times that of controls. The data suggest that exposure to P. noblei cercariae adversely affected the survival of blackfly larvae.</description><creator>Jacobs, Philippe, 1961-</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Plagiorchiidae.</subject><subject>Simulium -- Biological control.</subject><subject>Simulium -- Parasites.</subject><title>Plagiorchis noblei and blackfly larvae : factors affecting parasite acquisition and the effect of infection on host survival</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/m613mz67t.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0z708x81t</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Parasitology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:7m01bm74v</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:00:44Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Adventitious root growth from the crown of red clover constitutes a major portion of the root system in older stands. Two 2 yr old production fields and 3 yr old research plots were sampled in springs of 1988 and 1989 to determine the relationship between spring vigor and two root types of red clover. A higher average spring vigor rating was generally associated with the presence of well developed adventitious roots. Five hundred and fifty-six red clover plants were dug in the fall of 1988 from a space planted (1 x 1 m centers) nursery established in the spring of the same year. Two divergent populations of 55 clones each were produced based on either a low or high score for adventitious root growth. The progeny of 32 single-crosses made within and between the two populations was evaluated for flowering habit and root types under spaced planting conditions during the 1989 growing season. Six red clover cultivars were established in solid seedings to monitor adventitious root growth at three sampling dates.</description><creator>Montpetit, Jean-Marc</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Red clover -- Breeding.</subject><subject>Red clover -- Roots.</subject><title>Inheritance and agronomic significance of adventitious root development in red clover (Trifolium pratense L.)</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5t34sk668.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7m01bm74v</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Plant Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:g732db04s</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:00:44Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Vitamin A, protein, iron, zinc, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were studied in the food system of the Sahtu (Hareskin) Dene/Metis of Fort Good Hope (FGH) and Colville Lake (CL), NWT.

Study of glacier front evolution and frontal moraine development over the last three decades (1959-1989) is based on photographic, cartographic and geodetic information acquired by researchers since the late 1950's updated by surveys of glacier-distal moraine perimeter position in the summer of 1989. Even though both glaciers are juxtaposed in the lowermost ablation zone, it was found that the White Glacier has receded circa 100 m while the Thompson Glacier front has progressed downvalley by approximately 500 m. Other findings include: (1) the uneven retreat of the White Glacier ice front; (2) the shrinking widthwise of the White Glacier and lengthwise of its frontal moraine due to the pushing action of the advancing Thompson Glacier and (3) the asymmetric development of the Thompson Glacier frontal moraine. A series of measured transects and comparative photography for 1989 and 1990 provided information on short-term morphologic changes occurring within and beyond the moraine complex.</description><creator>Moisan, Yves</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Glaciers -- Nunavut -- Axel Heiberg Island</subject><subject>Axel Heiberg Island (Nunavut)</subject><subject>Glaciology</subject><subject>Thompson Glacier (Nunavut)</subject><title>Recent geomorphic changes in the snout and proglacial zone of the White and Thompson glaciers, Axel Heiberg Island, Northwest Territories</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/t722hb01q.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1544bq49v</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Geography</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:v118rf688</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:00:45Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis presents the development of an intelligent CAD system (ICADS) for DC machines. This system was implemented on a PC using Common Lisp provided by Gold Works II and connected with a Sun Workstation working under the Unix system for file transfer. Both frame-based and rule-based knowledge representation techniques have been used to capture the knowledge about the design of electric machines. The system has its own inference engine specially designed to handle both decision making and numerical computation. Forward-chain reasoning and procedural attachment were used to construct this inference engine. The knowledge base management system provides a user interface for knowledge acquisition, knowledge representation, man-machine communication, design document preparation, etc. The design results are translated to a finite element analysis file and sent to MagNet2D, a powerful electromagnetic field analysis package for design checking and refinement. The system provides different levels of design automation to suit the needs of the system user. As examples the design results of a series of universal motors and a small DC motor are provided in the thesis.</description><creator>Zhu, Zongfan</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>An intelligent CAD system for DC machines /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/fq977w17j.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/v118rf688</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:c247dt27b</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:00:45Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The present work has concentrated on the deposition of high quality MgO thin films on Si substrates by rf sputtering. High-purity Mg(99.99%) was used as the target for the film sputtering. During the sputtering, atoms of Mg react with O$ sb2$ to form MgO molecules which deposit in a thin film form on Si substrates. The substrates were heated at temperatures above 300$ sp circ$C during the sputtering process to improve the adhesion and crystallinity. The sputtered MgO thin films had a (111) preferred orientation. The thickness of the sputtered MgO thin film was about 0.1 $ mu$m. The ratio of Mg/O was equal to one throughout the film before heat treatment. After a treatment at elevated temperature, elemental interdiffusion between the thin film and the Si substrate occurred. Several heat treatment processes were employed on the sputtered MgO thin films to study the effect of heat treatment on the quality of thin films.</description><creator>Wu, S. L.

It has been shown that finding k-covers of polygons by subpolygons of a given class is almost always NP-hard, whenever k is allowed to vary. Shermer (She91a) gave a linear time algorithm to determine if P has a two-cover by convex polygons, and to find one if it exists. A polygon P is star-shaped if it has a point which sees all the others, and $L sb{k}$-convex if every pair of points can be joined by a polygonal path of at most k links contained in P. In this thesis, we give algorithms to find two-covers of P by $L sb{k}$-convex polygons in $O(n sp2$) time and space, and by star-shaped polygons on $O(n sp4$) time and $O(n sp2$logn) space respectively, provided that they exist.

The creative work is entitled Les fleurs de lotus, which delineates the life of a Chinese woman from the last Empire to the communist regime. The story unfolds around the bound-feet of the central character. The feet, in the different period of time, have different consequences for her. The world changes, so does the prejudice against her in various forms. The tale questions the destiny of human being in history. The critical work explores historical novel through the study of France's novel, Les dieux ont soif. Having demonstrated that history is the main subject of this novel, I contend that skepticism forges France's vision about revolution and the destiny of human being.

Growth studies were carried out in order to obtain a better understanding of the nutritional requirements of three species of oral spirochetes. Long-chain fatty acids were shown to support the growth of all treponemes studied with the exception of Treponema socranskii. Short-chain fatty acids and rabbit serum were found to be essential for growth. Glucuronic acid was shown to stimulate growth. Video time-lapse microscopy using darkfield optics was employed to study the locomotory behaviour of spirochetes in media of different densities. Optimal migration of spirochetes was found to be viscosity-dependent. Treponema denticola ATCC 35404 and T. denticola ATCC 35405 exhibited the greatest mean speeds at 0.2-0.3 % (wt./vol.) Nobel agar. Optimal motility for T. vincentii ATCC 35580 and T. socranskii ss. socranskii ATCC 35536 was achieved at 0.35-0.40 % (wt./vol.)

Although originally intended for audio accompanying visual media, the system has potential as a music-only playback system. The purpose of the thesis is to investigate this potential, particularly as it applies to acoustic music recording. Dolby Surround encode and decode technology and its relevance to acoustic music reproduction is reviewed. The classic stereo microphone techniques are discussed with particular attention paid to each one's theoretical ability to "encode" information for the Dolby Surround decoder. Practical limitations and benefits of these well-known methods are considered. Recently proposed microphone techniques are reviewed in theory and in practice and are found to provide many solutions. Methods for optimizing the decoder technology for music reproduction are suggested. The paper is relevant to any acoustic recording application for a number of surround systems as well as for conventional stereo and mono.</description><creator>Cook, Peter</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Sound -- Recording and reproducing</subject><subject>Microphone</subject><title>Toward a microphone technique for Dolby Surround encoding</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vt150k34n.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dv13zv48t</identifier><degree><name>Master of Music</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Faculty of Music</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:fq977w18t</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:00:47Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The last decade has witnessed the development of a private launch industry. Under international space law, in particular the Outer Space Treaty of 1967, States shall supervise and authorize the activities of their nationals, including private launch companies, in Outer Space. In the United States, a substantial set of regulations has been elaborated to exercise this control over the activities of the private launch industry. This thesis analyzes, in a first chapter, the evolution which led to these regulations. The Commercial Space Launch Act of 1984 and the subsequent regulations issued by the Office of Commercial Space Transportation, regarding the licensing process are dealt with in the second chapter. The third chapter examines the most important practical legal issue relating to private launch services, namely liability and insurance.</description><creator>Kayser, Valérie</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Law.</subject><subject>Transportation.</subject><subject>Political Science, International Law and Relations.</subject><title>Legal aspects of private launch services in the United States</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/nz806093f.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fq977w18t</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Air and Space Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:qb98mg67t</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:00:48Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Since life-threatening natural phenomena, such as, snow avalanches and lava flows, and many industrial and agricultural material handling processes may be classified as granular flows, establishing constitutive relationships which model granular flow behaviour is of prime importance. While laboratory experiments attempting to support granular flow theory have been plagued by poor instrumentation, numerical simulations are becoming increasingly helpful in understanding the nature of these flows. The present investigation describes such a simulation developed within the framework of the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo model for rarefied gases presented in Bird (1976) and granular flow kinetic theory according to Lun, et al. (1984). More specifically, the model generates a Couette flow of smooth, inelastic, homogeneous, spherical granular particles. Two different boundary condition models are used to model the flow field's upper and lower boundaries: the Periodic Boundary Condition (PBC) model and the Finite Shear Layer (FSL) model. An essentially uniform shear flow with virtually no slip at the boundaries results from both boundary conditions. Stress and granular temperature results obtained with the PBC and FSL models for the lower range of solids fractions ($ nu &lt; 0.3)$ compare very well with the Lun, et al. (1984) theory. At higher solids fractions, while the total stresses generated with both boundary models are in reasonable agreement with the latter theory and results from other numerical work, higher than expected streaming stresses appear to be compensating for lower than expected collisional stresses; as a result, granular temperature in this range of solids fractions proves to be higher than predicted.</description><creator>Basik, Beata-Marie</creator><date>1990</date><subject>Engineering, Mechanical.</subject><subject>Applied Mechanics.</subject><title>Direct simulation Monte Carlo model of a couette flow of granular materials</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kh04dq75n.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qb98mg67t</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Civil Engineering and Applied Mechanics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:sn009z950</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:00:48Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This dissertation consists of a defence of scientific realism and a critique of empiricist antirealism. Strict empiricism is discussed in Chapter 1, in which it is argued that this variety of empiricism adequately describes only the initial stages of scientific research. Bas van Frassen's empiricist antirealism is then discussed in Chapter 2. Here, it is argued that this new position, although more sophisticated than earlier forms of empiricist antirealism, fails to constitute a genuinely acceptable alternative to scientific realism. The two main constituents of scientific realism--scientism and critical realism--are then defended in Chapters 3 and 4. Lastly, the superempirical virtues and their role in theory evaluation is discussed in Chapter 5, wherein they are presented as a nonempirical source of quality control on our theorizing.</description><creator>Avilés, Cuauhtémoc</creator><date>1990</date><subject>Science -- Methodology</subject><subject>Empiricism</subject><subject>Realism</subject><title>Scientific realism and empiricist antirealism</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5138jf933.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sn009z950</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Philosophy</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:ht24wk38v</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:00:48Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In this thesis we apply the Interfacial Wave Theory of dendritic crystal growth to the case in which the thermal diffusivity constant and the specific heat of the liquid state are different from those of the solid state.

Whisker-reinforcement of ceramic matrices has been shown to be an effective way of increasing toughness. However, the hot-pressing techniques being used at present are expensive. Si$ sb3$N$ sb4$ is a major contender for high temperature application, mainly due to its excellent mechanical, chemical and thermal properties. In this work Si$ sb3$N$ sb4$ whiskers have been incorporated into a Si$ sb3$N$ sb4$ matrix and densified using pressureless sintering. An isotropic distribution of whiskers in the starting powder was seen to inhibit shrinkage of the bulk material as a result of whisker bridging. An extrusion process was developed to align the whiskers such that they do not impinge on one another. This was done using a water soluble, cellulose based plasticizer. The process was sensitive to water content and mixing. Entrapped air caused problems in the extrudate, resulting in misaligned areas in the microstructure. Relative densities of 94.5% were obtained for composites having 15% whiskers. The toughness of this material was measured to be 13.5MPa.m$ sp{1/2}$ in the direction perpendicular to the direction of extrusion.</description><creator>Muscat, Daniel</creator><date>1990</date><subject>Engineering, Materials Science.</subject><subject>Engineering, Metallurgy.</subject><title>Silicon nitridesilicon nitride whisker-reinforced composites</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/wp988m169.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3t945s02d</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mining and Metallurgical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:rn301243r</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:00:49Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The purpose of this investigation was to document the influence of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in controlling the dynamic interaction between the femur and tibia. Twenty subjects were initially selected to participate based on the results of arthroscopic and proprioceptive tests which established the presence of a uni-lateral, third degree rupture of the ACL. A spline function established the best fitting curve of the instant center (IC) coordinates obtained throughout the ROM. Displacement variables were extrapolated from joint rotation profiles generated from these coordinates. Abnormal displacement migrations of the IC parameter were demonstrated to occur in extension. Migration displacements evaluated between 30$ sp circ$ and 0$ sp circ$ shifted anteriorly 5.07 $ pm$ 1.86 mm for intact knees and 6.97 $ pm$ 2.06 mm for involved knees. This was determined to be significant at the 0.05 level of confidence and correlated well with clinical findings. Mean migration displacements evaluated in flexion (between 100$ sp circ$ and 70$ sp circ)$ were not found to differ significantly between knee conditions.</description><creator>Simmonds, Michael John</creator><date>1990</date><subject>Knee -- Wounds and injuries</subject><subject>Anterior cruciate ligament</subject><title>Instantaneous center of rotation shifts in symptomatic anterior cruciate ligament deficient knee joints</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7m01bm78z.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rn301243r</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Physical Education</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:w9505167g</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:00:50Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Over the past decade Marie Laberge has become an important figure in Quebec feminine theater. In our introduction we will see that the principal tendencies in her works correspond closely to those in Quebec women's theater as a whole. This thesis will explore the feminine universe created by Laberge in her plays. The first chapter will examine the spatial universe which, as we shall see, frequently spatializes the feminine characters' choices and conflicts. As for the professional universe, the second chapter shows that, although Laberge's feminine characters are still involved in traditionally feminine occupations, there is a gradual shifting toward more rewarding activities. We will see in the third chapter that the intimate relationships in Laberge's theater tend to determine the overall quality of the feminine characters' existence. In general, conflicts plague these relationships. Lastly, we will observe that, though Laberge's feminine characters react to their universe in a variety of ways, their reaction is almost invariably spatialized.</description><creator>Plett, Sharon</creator><date>1990</date><subject>Laberge, Marie, 1950- -- Criticism and interpretation</subject><subject>Women in literature</subject><subject>Laberge, Marie, 1950- -- Characters -- Women</subject><title>L'univers féminin dans l'oeuvre dramatique de Marie Laberge</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/x059c866b.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/w9505167g</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Département de langue et littérature françaises</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:6395w850c</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:00:50Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The author discusses the idea of architecture criticism and its interpretation. Criticism, in addition to its traditional literary role, is considered as an act of making. Consequently, architecture is understood as criticism--i.e. a making of critical architecture. The making of critical architecture, as an activity prevalent throughout history, is discussed. Two types of this architectural phenomenon are identified as the critical zeitgeist phenomenon and the critical individualist phenomenon. The critical making of this architecture, supported by two operations or manipulations--the principles of integration and inversion, is described and illustrated. These principles are used to analyze Mannerist architecture (the critical zeitgeist phenomenon) and the work of Nicholas Hawksmoor (the critical individualist phenomenon).</description><creator>Sirithanawat, Chaiboon</creator><date>1990</date><subject>Mannerism (Architecture)</subject><subject>Architecture</subject><subject>Hawksmoor, Nicholas, 1661-1736</subject><title>Architecture as criticism : from mannerism to the architecture of Nicholas Hawksmoor</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/g158bj32g.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6395w850c</identifier><degree><name>Master of Architecture</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Architecture</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:j098zc22q</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:00:51Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>An idealized box model of the Indian Ocean is used to examine the hypothesis proposed by Godfrey and Weaver (1991) that the buoyancy-forced Leeuwin Current off the west coast of Australia is a manifestation of a basinwide thermohaline circulation driven by the Indonesian throughflow. The stronger Sverdrup circulation dominates the thermohaline circulation in most of the model ocean except near the eastern boundary. The western boundary currents apparently play a very minor role in this basinwide thermohaline circulation. This differs from the warm water route proposed by Gordon (1986), and supports the alternative hypothesis that the heat from the equatorial Pacific is returned to the South Atlantic via the eastward-flowing Antarctic Circumpolar Current rather than past the Agulhas Retroflection. The Indonesian throughflow is shown to significantly affect the surface heat fluxes and the meridional heat transport in the Indian Ocean. The role of the throughflow in maintaining the very warm climate of the Indian Ocean (a net exporter of heat) is described. Large-scale, fairly long period ($&gt;$100 days) barotropic eddies are found in the western portion of the basin for some solutions.</description><creator>Hughes, Tertia</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Physics, Atmospheric Science.</subject><subject>Physical Oceanography.</subject><title>Indonesian throughflow and its effect on the climate of the Indian Ocean</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7w62f955m.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/j098zc22q</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Meteorology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><resumptionToken completeListSize="47894">oai_etdms.s(Collection:theses).f(2019-10-16T06:03:34Z).u(2020-07-23T18:55:55Z).t(47894):23150</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>
