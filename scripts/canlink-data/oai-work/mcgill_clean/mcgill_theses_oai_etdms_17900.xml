It is now increasingly being applied to any excited state of the nucleus whose lifetime has been measured. Nuclear isomerism was first discovered by Hahn in 1921 and since then about 150 examples have been reported with half lives ranging from 5 years to lo-14 seconds. This thesis describes a method of measurement and results obtained for a number of isomeric states in the region of half life 5 x 10-5 to 5 x 10-2 seconds.</description><creator>Link, William.

One might say that there seems to be an inverse relation between the two, that the louder the protestations of the one, the more infamous is the other. And yet, surprisingly, this relation is not mutually exclusive; in fact, evil practice sanctioned by sententious morality is a fairly common theme both in medieval and in renaissance literature.</description><creator>Lieber, Jack.

Traditional sources of occupational orientation and guidance such as parents, relatives, teachers and friends no longer suffice because the choice of a career has become more and more complex. This complexity is due to increasing differentiation within occupations and to the level of training and skill required to enter many occupations.</description><creator>LeMay, Mary.

It is therefore merely for historical comparison that we look further back than the 19th. century and maybe for moral lesson and inspiration.

Exogenous estrogens have been shown to produce striking effects in immature pullets, both on the morphology of the secondary sex organs and on the composition of the blood and other tissues. The similarity of these changes to those which occur in the normal pullet at puberty clearly indicate the presence of an endogenous estrogen or estrogens in the bird, and crude extracts of the ovaries of hens have been shown to have estrogenic activity by bioassay in rats.</description><creator>Layne, Donald.

This interest lies in obtaining a clear understanding of the host-parasite relationship. The emphasis is placed on the physiological mechanisms involved which enables the plant pathogenic organisms to effect entry into the host body and to assimilate the available nutrients, to tolerate or overcome the resistance of the host and to induce disease in the host by their metabolic products or toxins. The host-parasite relationship of the common scab disease of potatoes, caused by Streptomyces scabies (Thaxt.)

No density in other countries can compare with it. The population of Hong Kong has increased since the war due to major political events in the Far East that have lead to a large scale migration from China. The population increase has been augmented by a rapidly rising birth rate. In 1954 there was an excess of births over deaths of 1,000 a week in the Colony, and the Government estimates that in ten years this excess may well reach 80,000 a year.</description><creator>Lam, Anna.

Electric wave filters owe their origin to the observation of G. A. Campbell that in a "loaded" telephone line, the lower frequencies are transmitted with less attenuation and the higher frequencies with more attenuation than in the case of a line with no loading. Soon after, G. W. Stewart at Brown University, investigated analogous effects in acoustic tubes and developed a simple theory of acoustic filters. Exploiting the analogy between electric and acoustic phenomena, he considered acoustic tubes as lumped impedance elements.</description><creator>Kubina, S. J.</creator><contributor>Howes, F.

This type of behaviour raises the problem or how the timing of the neural activity involved, is accomplished. Although a considerable amount or research has been done on the acquisition of responses, research into the timing or the response sequence itself has been largely neglected.</description><creator>Hogg, Doreen.</creator><contributor>Heron, W.

The basal vessels of the brain, especially the circle of Willis and basilar artery are of particular interest and importance as they are the main and only source of metabolism to such vital structures as basal ganglia, hypothalamus, midbrain and pons. Many investigators have therefore contributed to the knowledge of the course, tributary area, variations, anomalies etc., from the anatomical, physiological and pathological aspects.</description><creator>Kim, Yoon-Bom.</creator><contributor>McNaughton, F.

Water uptake in these insects occurs in a definite stage in embryonic development. Previous studies on the egg or the house cricket, Acheta domesticus (L.), have shown that contact water is necessary for the development of the egg. The stage of embryonic development at which water absorption occurs, and the mechanism or absorption, however, have not been studied. In the present investigation, water uptake by the egg is studied, the stage of embryonic development at which this uptake occurs is determined, and the mechanism or absorption is analyzed.</description><creator>Kennard, Charles.

It is known to shorten the span of life of the individual in most cases bi-progressive renal insufficiency. There is an everyday growing interest in the subject leading to case presentations and to accumulation of a voluminous literature on its clinical, pathological and experimental aspects. The experimental work has been concerned with the production of renal calcinosis, along with studies of its physiochemical and pathological nature.</description><creator>Kataria, Prem.

In spite of their use for over one hundred years, the design of Bourdon tubes is still a trial and error procedure. In the study, the leading theories of flat oval Bourdon tube deflection are reviewed and compared with test data. A Bourdon tube design procedure based on test results, is recommended minimizing the number of test samples required to develop a new tube, and the directions of future research are indicated.</description><creator>Kardos, Geza.</creator><contributor>Edis, A.

In a patent applied for in 1886 entitled "Constructions of Artificial Stone and Concrete Pavements", P. H. Jackson of San Francisco described several methods of applying prestress forces by stretching ties by turnbuckles, screws and nuts and wedges. Later in 1888 C. F. W. Doehring in Germany, and in 1896 J. Mandl in Austria secured patents for applications of steel and concrete that may quite properly be described as prestressed concrete.</description><creator>Issen, Lionel.</creator><contributor>De Stein, J.

The apparatus was designed to achieve a homogeneous fuel/air mixture as quickly as possible in order that the ignition delay due to the chemical reactions of combustion primarily might be studied. The study was confined to the lean mixture range up to about one half of stoichiometric. Although the apparatus requires further development and the method of interpretation was cumbersome indications are that the chemical ignition delay does follow an exponential law of the Arrhenius type.</description><creator>Irwin, Roland.

Even in recent times the word has been applied non-specifically to conditions such as syncope due to mental anguish, affects of trauma, both accidental and operative as well as the well-recognized and specific state which results from prolonged loss of effective circulating blood volume. According to Moon (68) the first accurate description of the shock syndrome was recorded by Dr. Samuel Gross in 1872.</description><creator>Inglis, Frederic. G.</creator><contributor>Webster, D.

Comparisons or disinfectant compounds were and still are necessary not only for the advancement or knowledge, but also as part of our society or tree enterprise. Thus, when Microbiology became a science, methods were established for testing these disinfectants with various organisms. At the beginning, such comparisons, as made by Koch and others, were unsuitable because they did not take into consideration factors that might affect the efficiency of the disinfectants.</description><creator>Idziak, Edmund.
