When  applied to practical systems that are inherently limited to a finite complexity and  therefore to finite block lengths, such a strategy may be largely suboptimal.  Indeed, a tandem decoding strategy ignores two types of information: the source  memory and the residual redundancy of the source coder. Moreover, conventional  source decoders, within a tandem decoding strategy, are designed to perform the  inverse operation of the source coder and may severely decrease performance if  errors are still present at their input. One viable alternative, that has been  demonstrated to yield gains, is the design of a joint source-channel decoding scheme  that would take the additional sources of redundancies---the source memory and the  source coder's residual redundancy---into account. In this context, we propose a novel, iterative joint  source-channel decoding algorithm. The proposed scheme is derived from a Bayesian  network representation of the coding chain and incorporates three types of  information: the source memory; the residual redundancy of the source coder; and  finally the redundancy introduced by the channel coder. Specifically, we modify an  existing algorithm by first deriving a new, equivalent Bayesian network  representation of the coding chain. Next, we derive a fully consistent methodology,  within the framework of Bayesian networks, for performing the iterations. The  proposed algorithm is shown to yield significant gains along with a drastic  reduction in computational complexity when compared with the existing one. Finally,  we outline additional possible improvements on the proposed algorithm. They include  methods for further reductions in computational complexity at no cost in performance  in one case, and at a slight cost in performance in the other.</description><creator>Ali, Karim</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>An enhanced joint source-channel decoder /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/fq977v42p.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9880vr45w</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:9880vr465</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:52:00Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Animal models are valuable tools in auditory research. Rats are potentially very useful for this purpose. They are low in cost, they are genetically similar to humans, and the middle-ear structures are easily approachable. The goal of the present study is to better characterize the mechanics of the rat middle ear by measuring frequency responses at multiple points on the tympanic membrane for the first time, and with better frequency resolution than in previous studies. A laser Doppler vibrometer was used to measure the vibrations. Measurements were done on seven rats. Tympanic membrane vibrations at seven different points, in the frequency range of 1 000 to 10 000 Hz, are presented. We provide a measure of the noise floor and investigate the linearity of the rat tympanic membrane. The repeatability of the rat's middle-ear response and inter-animal variability at the umbo are presented. The vibration modes of the tympanic membrane and manubrium are also investigated.</description><creator>Akache Fadi G.</creator><contributor>Funnell, W. Robert J.

In order to assess safety of refrigerated fish, the  sensitivity of key pathogens like Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Listeria  monocytogenes Scott A, which thrive under refrigerated storage conditions, needs to  be assessed. In the first part of the study, the pressure destruction  kinetics of E. coli and L. monocytogenes in fish were evaluated at 250 to 400 MPa  with a holding time ranging from 0-60 min. A slurry was prepared by blending 20 g  filleted fish and 80 ml sterile peptone water (0.1%) in a stomacher. To the slurry,  stock cultures of E. coli O157:H7 and L. monocytogenes were added separately and  final counts of 107 and 106 CFU/ml were achieved, respectively. Due to the higher  overall pressure resistance at 400 MPa, E. coli was selected as the target  microorganism in this study for pressure destruction. The second part of the study focused on storage studies. The  first phase of the storage study was a repeat of previous set of experiments with  fish slurry inoculated with only E. coli O157:H7 which was more resistant to  pressure destruction (challenge study). The second phase of storage studies evaluated the quality  changes associated with pressure treated fish.

To enhance the activity of CDO for the production of this acid cis-diol, the recombinant CDO expressed in Escherichia coli Top10 strain was evolved by directed evolution using the error-prone polymerase chain reaction (EP-PCR) method. The mutant library was screened in a 96-well format based on the enzyme's ability to transform colorless indole-2-carboxylate to the water-insoluble blue dye indigo. Screening of 300 colonies resulted in four variants, termed CDO1, CDO2, CDO3, CDO4, that have increased ability (15-38%) in the transformation of  indole-2-carboxylate compared to the wild type. Determination of the specific enzyme  activity of the four variants confirmed that the activity of CDO1 and CDO4 have  increased 20.2% and 28.7%, respectively, while CDO2 and CDO3 have only a slight  increase (4.5% and 7.6% respectively). DNA sequencing and deduced amino acid  analysis of the mutated region of CDO1 and CDO4 revealed that the histidine at  position 345 of CmtAa in CDO1 was substituted with leucine (H345L); in CDO4, the  glutamic acid at position 37 of CmtAc was substituted with alanine (E37A). CDO1 and  CDO4 can serve as templates for further round of EP-PCR mutagenesis.</description><creator>Zhang, Shan Hong</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Biology, Microbiology.</subject><title>Directed evolution of a pseudomonad p-cumate-2,3-dioxygenase for enhanced synthesis of an acid cis-diol</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kp78gg94c.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cc08hg07n</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Microbiology and Immunology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:2n49t2491</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:52:01Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The Glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is one of many steroid hormone  receptors. It controls broad physiological gene networks, confers pathological  effects in a range of disease states, and offers an excellent target for therapeutic  intervention. Therefore, it is necessary to better understand the mechanisms of GR  regulation. In particular, we are interested in better understanding the  protein-nucleotide interactions (transcription factors interacting with  transcription factor binding sites). Upon glucocorticoids-hormone binding, the GR  forms a protein-nucleotide interaction with a specific transcription factor binding  site known as a glucocorticoid response element (GRE). This research has employed  three different but complementary bioinformatics approaches to identify Mouse genes  putatively transcriptionally regulated by GR. Firstly, we focus on the problem of  searching for putative GREs in the complete Mouse genome using a position weight  matrix. This produced a large number of putative GREs. Most of these are likely  false positive predictions. Secondly, two different strategies are used to improve  the accuracy of our framework: combinatorial analysis of multiple TFs/modules of  TFBSs and phylogenetic footprinting (PF). The number of putative GREs can be reduced  by 97.9% using the module of TFBSs analysis, 97.7% using the PF analysis, and 99.9%  using both module and PF analyses. In each step, a statistical test has been used to  measure the significance of the results.</description><creator>Tang, Zuojian, 1967-</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Computer Science.</subject><subject>Biology, Genetics.</subject><title>Identifying mouse genes putatively transcriptionally regulated by the glucocorticoid receptor</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mk61rh569.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2n49t2491</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:7d278t57q</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:52:02Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The prevalence of obesity in the paediatric population is on the  increase and there is speculation that suboptimal breastfeeding patterns may be  contributing to the present obesity epidemic. We described the prevalence and trends  in underweight and overweight among 3 052 school aged children over a ten year  period, and patterns of exclusive and any infant breastfeeding among 671 mothers  over a 6 year period on Montserrat a small British colony which forms part of the  chain of Caribbean islands, and experienced the eruption of the Soufriere Hills  volcano in July 1995. The results revealed for 11 year old children there was an  excess risk of being overweight in the post volcanic period compared to the pre  volcanic period (OR=2.1, 95% CI 1.5-2.7). The rate of exclusive breastfeeding at 6 months of age was  exceptionally low (3.4%) in relation to the international recommendations, but the  prevalence of any breastfeeding at 4-6 months was relatively high 67.1%. Maternal  age was the only significant variable associated with exclusive  breastfeeding. These findings highlight the need for promoting and prolonging  exclusive breastfeeding and that overweight is increasing in the children on  Montserrat.</description><creator>Taylor, Maunelva Denise</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Breastfeeding -- Montserrat.</subject><subject>Overweight children -- Montserrat.</subject><subject>Children -- Nutrition -- Montserrat.</subject><title>Investigating trends in feeding practices and anthropometric indices in infants and children on Montserrat, 1993-2002</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/td96k3149.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7d278t57q</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Dietetics and Human Nutrition</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:wh246s616</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:52:02Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Winter storms produce major problems for society and their  varying types of precipitation are often the key factor responsible. The objective  of this study is to better understand the formation of winter precipitation types  (freezing rain, ice pellets, snow, slush, wet snow and refrozen wet snow) within the  varying, and interacting, environmental conditions experienced within many winter  storms. A one dimensional cloud model utilizing a double-moment microphysics scheme  has been developed to address this issue. Temperature and moisture profiles  favorable for the formation of different winter precipitation types were varied in a  systematic manner in an environment in which snow is falling continuously from above  a temperature inversion. The ensuing precipitation evolved due to atmospheric  temperature and moisture variations arising from phase changes such as melting and  freezing. Average soundings associated with various surface precipitation types were  consequently defined as well as the atmospheric conditions leading to the longest  duration of various precipitation events. In addition, the reduction of visibility  by precipitation was calculated to determine the conditions leading to the greatest  reduction and those leading to its most rapid changes.</description><creator>Thériault, Julie M., 1980 Apr. 29-</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Physics, Atmospheric Science.</subject><title>Numerical studies on winter precipitation type formation</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/m039k550b.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/wh246s616</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:8910jv19n</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:52:03Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Typically, drought occurs once every three years across the  Canadian Prairies. Most research addressing such droughts has concentrated on the  large scale conditions associated with this form of extreme weather whereas little  research has been conducted on its smaller scale characteristics. The present  research begins to address the latter issue. Several datasets (surface observations, drought indices, and  re-analysis products) were used to identify and analyze the 11 most severe droughts  occurring over the Prairies since 1953. Warm season hourly surface observations  (temperature, moisture, clouds, and precipitation) from 10 observational sites were  then compared for extreme drought, drought, non-drought, and extreme wet conditions.  When compared to non-drought or extreme wet conditions, drought and extreme drought  conditions are associated with warmer temperatures and drier conditions and there is  little change in the amount of total cloud cover but cloud bases are higher. As  well, the maximum temperature and highest cloud base both occur 1-2 h later in the  afternoon during drought and extreme drought conditions as compared to non-drought  and extreme wet conditions. Such factors act to extend the drought conditions. For  example, the higher cloud bases during drought and extreme drought conditions lead  to greater evaporation of falling precipitation and this prevents significant  precipitation from occurring thereby reinforcing the dry conditions.</description><creator>Roberts, Erin</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Biology, Ecology.</subject><subject>Physics, Atmospheric Science.</subject><title>A study of drought characteristics over the Canadian Prairies /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/db78tc566.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8910jv19n</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:pr76f403n</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:52:03Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Recurrent pregnancy loss is associated with anti-phospholipid  antibodies (aPL), in particular in women with anti-phospholipid syndrome. aPL are a  large family of autoantibodies, directed against phospholipids and  phospholipid-binding proteins (e.g., prothrombin and beta2-glycoprotein I). Although  the association between aPL and recurrent pregnancy loss is well documented, little  is known about which aPL subset is responsible. To address this, we characterized a  panel of six murine monoclonal aPL, which were subsequently administered to pregnant  mice via passive transfer. While both anti-beta2GPI antibodies evaluated caused  significant increase in fetal resorption, the effects of anti-PT antibodies varied  from no effect to increased pregnancy loss. Similarly, neither lupus anticoagulant  activity nor murine cross-reactivity predetermined aPL pathogenicity. We conclude  that there is no obvious common reactivity between the aPL capable of increasing  pregnancy loss, suggesting that a combination of reactivities, rather than one aPL  specificity in particular, may lead to aPL-mediated pregnancy loss.</description><creator>Robinson, Cheryl</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Health Sciences, Immunology.</subject><title>The role of anti-phospholipid antibodies in pregnancy loss /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3r074v747.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pr76f403n</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Experimental Medicine</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:fn106z70c</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:52:03Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Background. This thesis explores the link between travel and  deep venous thrombosis (DVT). While it is biologically plausible that prolonged  travel is an independent risk factor for venous thromboembolic disease (VTE),  epidemiological data to date are conflicting. Aim. To determine whether there is a independent association  between travel and DVT. Methods. This was a multi-center case control study. Consecutive  patients presenting to the vascular laboratory with clinically suspected DVT were  eligible to participate. Cases were patients with confirmed DVT; controls were  patients who had DVT ruled out. Travel history and clinical characteristics were  determined though standardized interviewer-administered questionnaire. Genetic  testing of Factor V Leiden and Prothrombin gene mutations were also performed. SAS  was used to perform unconditional multivariate logistic regression  analysis. Results. There were 359 cases and 359 controls. The crude and  adjusted odds ratios (OR) for travel and DVT were 1.15 (95%CI: 0.78, 1.69) and 1.51  (95%CI: 0.91, 2.50) respectively. Travel of &gt;=12 hours' duration had a higher  OR estimate (2.82, 95%CI: 0.52, 15.24) than shorter travel durations (OR = 1.32,  95%CI: 0.63, 2.76), although this did not reach statistical significance. Analyzing  plane and car travel separately showed that plane travel of &gt;=12 hours  duration had a crude and adjusted OR of 8.22 (95%CI: 1.02, 66.05) and 7.10 (95% CI:  0.70, 72.35). No such association was found with long durations of car  travel. Interpretation. Plane travel appears to be a mild independent  risk factor for DVT overall, although the adjusted OR does not achieve conventional  levels of statistical significance. Plane travel durations of 12 hours or longer had  the highest estimate of risk. This was not found to be true of car travel. These  findings may have future implications regarding the use of thromboprophylaxis in  travelers.</description><creator>Opatrny, Lucie</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Health Sciences, Public Health.</subject><subject>Biology, Biostatistics.</subject><title>A case-control study examining the association between travel and deep venous thrombosis /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/x633f172r.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fn106z70c</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:k35695142</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:52:04Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Hes1 and Hes6 are basic helix loop helix (bHLH) proteins with a  similar structure, but opposite biological roles: Hes1 prevents the differentiation  of neural progenitors into neurons, whereas Hes6 promotes neuronal differentiation.  To elucidate the reasons for the different activities of Hes1 and Hes6, we have  focused on structural elements that are specific to either Hes1 or Hes6. In  particular, Hes6 contains a stretch of acidic amino acids ("acidic patch")  N-terminal to the bHLH domain. Such an acidic patch is not present in Hes1. Based on  previous studies showing that similar acidic patches play a role in regulating the  dimerization properties of other bHLH proteins, we hypothesized that the presence of  acidic amino acids, N-terminal to the bHLH domain might modulate the activities of  Hes6 and Hes1. As part of an effort to test this possibility, we generated a mutated  form of Hes1 containing an acidic patch in a position equivalent to that of Hes6  (Hes1AC mutant). Here we show that the introduction of this acidic region does not  interfere with the expression, nuclear localization, and transcription repression  activity of Hes1. However, this mutation has an effect on the dimerization ability  of Hes1. In particular, Hes1AC homodimerizes better and also heterodimerizes better  with Hes6 than wild type Hes1. Together, these results suggest that the presence of  an acidic region near the bHLH motif may affect the dimerization of Hes  proteins.</description><creator>Osiceanu, Ana-Maria</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</subject><title>Characterization of mechanisms involved in the functions of bHLH proteins of the Hes family</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/n583xv533.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/k35695142</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:rb68xc402</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:52:04Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), a cyclooxygenase (COX) pathway product,  increases COX-2 mRNA stability and translation in human synovial fibroblasts (HSFs)  via a positive-feedback loop. We hypothesized that this effect is a result of  PGE2-mediated regulation of mRNA-binding (possibly AU-binding) protein synthesis  and/or activity and wished to characterize the factors and mechanisms involved in  this process. When transiently cotransfected with a COX-2 3 UTR-fused  luciferase reporter, the AU-binding proteins (AUBPs) TTP and p37AUF1 markedly  reduced and mildly increased reporter activity in HSFs, respectively. Western blot  analysis of PGE2's effects on AUF1 and TTP protein synthesis showed that PGE 2  suppressed HSF p37AUF1 expression while regulating the formation of a heterocomplex  of which TTP is a subunit. PGE2 also induced rapid nuclear export of eGFP-fused TTP  in HeLa cells. Lastly, PGE2 induced changes in the protein binding profile of a  COX-2 distal 3 UTR probe as analyzed by RNA gel shift analysis (REMSA) and  subtractive affinity chromatography. In summary, the results of this study establish that PGE2 may  influence COX-2 post-transcriptional and translational regulation through a variety  of mechanisms involving modulation of AUBP expression, subcellular localization and  binding of uncharacterized COX-2 distal 3 UTR binding factors.</description><creator>Mancini, Arturo</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Biology, Molecular.</subject><subject>Biology, Cell.</subject><title>Prostaglandin E₂ : a central mediator of cytokine cell signaling through post-transcriptional and translational regulatory mechanisms in human synovial fibroblasts</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6d56zx07q.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rb68xc402</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:ks65hc808</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:52:04Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The importance of genes in the etiology of bipolar disorder (BD)  has been substantiated through family, twin and adoption studies. The search for  susceptibility genes, however, has proved to be an arduous task with disease  complexity leading to the non-replication of published results. We have used lithium  treatment response as a classification variable, thus providing a phenotypically  more homogeneous sample to work with. With this sample we carried out  pharmacogenetic studies to identify genes involved in the etiology of BD and/or in  the response to Li. The phosphoinositide and cAMP pathway have been shown to be  involved in Li's mode of action. Thus, a gene responsible for regulating inositol  metabolism (prolyl endopeptidase, PREP) and three cAMP responsive element binding  proteins (CREB1-3) were investigated. We have found an association indicating a  possible role of CREB1 and 2 in the etiology of BD and Li response. Further studies  in larger, independent samples and the analysis of additional markers should be  undertaken to confirm these findings.</description><creator>Mamdani, Firoza</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Psychology, Physiological.</subject><subject>Health Sciences, Mental Health.</subject><subject>Biology, Genetics.</subject><title>Genetic variation and lithium response in bipolar disorder</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dj52w530j.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ks65hc808</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Human Genetics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:8c97kq99v</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:52:05Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Energy is a currency of life because all organisms must expend energy to survive and reproduce. I examined the central role that energy expenditure plays in the lives of free-ranging female North American red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) in Yukon, Canada. I found that energy acquisition while hoarding white spruce (Picea glauca) cones in autumn was characterized by a type III functional response; when cones were scarce, squirrels switched to hoarding mushrooms, whereas when cones were abundant, squirrels were unable to hoard more than a small proportion of the cones present in their territory. The strong satiation of cone hoarding supports the primary prediction of the predator satiation hypothesis for the evolution of masting in white spruce trees. I also determined the daily energy expenditure (DEE, kJ/day) of female squirrels using the doubly-labeled water technique during the activity stages of nonbreeding (winter and summer), lactation, and hoarding. The primary determinant of energy expenditure throughout the year was the activity stage that the individual was engaged in, with females having the highest energy expenditure during hoarding and lactation. Ambient temperature (Ta) during the sampling interval was the second most important determinant of energy expenditure, but counter to expectations based on thermoregulatory requirements, Ta was positively correlated with energy expenditure. Levels of DEE were positively correlated with an estimate of physiological somatic damage (plasma protein carbonyls). The somatic damage experienced by females during lactation was greater than that experienced by nonbreeding females during summer and winter. Levels of somatic damage were reduced during lactation if individuals had access to supplemental food, which was associated with squirrels having higher levels of total antioxidant capacity. High energy expenditure during lactation was correlated with increased reproductive success. Lactating females with higher DEE also had increased physiological somatic damage, but there was no relationship between lactation DEE and survival. My thesis establishes for the first time the intuitive importance of energy expenditure for determining energy acquisition and mediating life-history trade-offs between reproduction and survival.</description><description>L'énergie est la devise de la vie puisqu'elle est nécessaire à tous les organismes vivants pour survivre et se reproduire. J'ai examiné le rôle central des dépenses énergétiques dans la vie des écureuils roux (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) femelles en liberté au Yukon (Canada, 61 °N 138 °W) pendant qu'elles acquéraient leur énergie et l'attribuaient entre différentes activités favorisant leur survie et succès reproductif. Lorsqu'elles s'approvisionnaient de cônes d'épinette blanche (Picea glauca) à l'automne, leur acquission d'énergie correspondait à une réponse fonctionnelle de type III. Lorsque les cônes étaient rares, les écureuils changeaient pour s'approvisionner en champignons, alors que lorsque les cônes étaient abondants, les écureuils étaient seulement capables d'amasser une faible portion des cônes sur leur territoire. La satiété des femelles qui s'approvisionnaient en cônes supporte une des prédictions fondamentales de l'hypothèse de la satiété des prédateurs dans l'évolution de la production de cône en masse des épinettes blanches. J'ai aussi déterminé la dépense d'énergie quotidienne (DEE, kJ/jour) des femelles écureuils en utilisant la technique de l'eau doublement marquée lors des modes d'activité suivants : en période non reproductive (hiver et été), lactation, et approvisionnement. Le facteur le plus important pour déterminer la dépense énergétique tout au long de l'année était le mode d'activité de la femelle. Les femelles en approvisionnement et en lactation avaient les plus hauts niveaux de dépense énergétique. La température ambiante était le deuxième facteur en importance pour déterminer la dépense énergétique. Contrairement aux prédictions basées sur les contraintes de thermorégulation, la température ambiante était corrélée de façon positive avec les dépenses énergétiques. Les niveaux de DEE étaient corrélés de façon positive avec une estimation du dommage somatique physiologique (carbonyles de protéine plasmatique). Le dommage somatique des femelles lors de l'allaitement était plus important que celui des femelles non reproductives en été et en hiver. Par contre, les taux de dommage somatique durant l'allaitement étaient réduits lorsque les femelles avaient accès à des suppléments de nourriture, ce qui augmentait leur taux de capacité antioxydante totale. Les taux de dépense énergétique élevés étaient corrélés  avec des taux de succès reproductif élevés. Les femelles allaitants qui avaient un taux élevé de DEE avaient aussi un taux élevé de dommage somatique physiologique. Il n'y avait pas de lien entre le DEE des femelles allaitants et leur survie. Ma thèse établit pour la première fois l'importance des dépenses énergétiques pour déterminer l'acquisition d'énergie et les compromis dans l'attribution de l'énergie entre la reproduction et la survie des écureuils roux femelles.</description><creator>Fletcher, Quinn</creator><contributor>Murray Mitchell Humphries (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2011</date><subject>Biology - Zoology </subject><title>The role of energy expenditure in resource acquisition and energy allocation in free-ranging North American red squirrels (Tamiasciurus Hudsonicus)</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7s75dd04w.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8c97kq99v</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Natural Resource Sciences</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:c534fp484</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:52:05Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis investigates the status of intimacy in late modernity. It adresses two questions: how should we consider intimacy today? And how can intimacy help us understand social phenomena such as the Bouchard-Taylor Commission?To answer these questions, intimacy is conceptualized as a form of power that regulates the space of social differentiation that exists between individuals in modern societies. The analysis is inspired by philosophical hermeneutics, but also a series of transdisciplinary approaches enabling us to account for the various dimensions of the issue. The thesis provides a close reading of 64 interventions made during the Quebec Citizen's Forum of the Consultation Commission on Accommodation Practices Related to Cultural Differences, better known as the Bouchard-Taylor Commission. These interventions are analyzed using a methodology inspired by the "Depth Hermeneutics" developed by John B. Thompson, which comprise three levels of analysis: social-historical analysis, discursive analysis and interpretation. I have enriched this method with the feminist insights of Sara Ahmed.The analysis is framed by a general context that includes the main elements of modernity and late modernity in the West, the more particular context of Quebec, and the effects of the September 11, 2001 attack on the United States and its aftermath. Additionally, the thesis situates this analysis in the more specific context surrounding the creation and the work of the Bouchard-Taylor Commission. This contextualization combined with a discourse analysis of the interventions themselves helped to unveil dimensions of intimacy that play a significant role in distancing and approaching bodies in public space and therefore have an influence on the differentiation of individuals in the community. In addition, this thesis argues that people are driven to manipulate their most intimate dimensions in order to gain the recognition of others. This is characterized as a by-product of the clash between our capacity for action and regulatory processes that reduce our margin of independence in late modernity.</description><description>Cette thèse a comme tâche principale de répondre aux interrogations concernant le statut de l'intimité dans la modernité avancée. En effet, nous y avons répondu à deux interrogations : comment devrions-nous considérer l'intimité aujourd'hui? Et comment peut-elle nous aider à comprendre des phénomènes sociaux comme la Commission Bouchard-Taylor?Pour répondre à ces questions, nous avons conceptualisé l'intimité à l'aide des dimensions y étant associées comme une forme de pouvoir aidant à la normalisation et au contrôle de l'espace à travers la différenciation sociale qu'elle effectue entre les individus. L'analyse présentée est basée sur un cadre théorique inspiré de la philosophie herméneutique, mais aussi d'une série de courants transdisciplinaires nous permettant de rendre compte des diverses dimensions de la question. Comme terrain d'étude, nous avons choisi 64 allocutions effectuées lors des Forums de citoyens de la Commission de Consultation sur les Pratiques d'Accommodement, mieux connue sous le nom de Commisison Bouchard-Taylor. Pour étudier ces allocutions, nous avons fait appel à la méthodologie inspirée du « depth hermeneutics » de John B. Thompson avec les trois niveaux d'analyse suivants : une analyse sociohistorique, une analyse discursive et l'interprétation. Cette méthode, nous a été enrichie à l'aide des travaux de Sara Ahmed, auteure féministe prolifique.Nous avons effectué une analyse du contexte général couvrant les principaux éléments de la modernité et de la modernité avancée, puis une analyse du contexte québécois, sans oublier les effets du 11 septembre 2001. Nous avons aussi présenté le contexte particulier entourant la création et les travaux de la Commission Bouchard-Taylor. Cette contextualisation jumelée à l'analyse discursive des allocutions nous a permis de constater que les dimensions de l'intimité jouent un rôle non négligeable dans le rapprochement et l'éloignement des corps dans l'espace et donc dans la différenciation des individus dans la communauté. Enfin, cette thèse nous a permis de voir que les individus sont poussés à manipuler leurs dimensions les plus intimes afin d'obtenir la reconnaissance de l'autre. Ce phénomène résulterait de nos capacités d'action qui se heurtent au processus de régulation et de contrôle externes diminuant notre marge d'indépendance dans la modernité avancée.</description><creator>Frozzini, Jorge</creator><contributor>Barney, Darin (Internal/Supervisor)</contributor><date>2011</date><subject>Communications And The Arts - Speech Communication</subject><title>Comprendre l'intimité: une forme de pouvoir au sein des audiences de la commission Bouchard-Taylor</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/nc580n174.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/c534fp484</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Art History and Communication Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:9z903047k</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:52:06Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) transcription factors are  key regulators of immunomodulatory genes regulation. NF-kappaB activity is regulated  through the phosphorylation of inhibitory proteins (IkappaBs) by the IkappaB kinase  (IKK) complex (IKK alpha/beta/gamma), leading to IkappaB degradation and NF-kappaB  translocation to the nucleus where they promote transcription of immunoregulatory  genes. Moreover, cRel and p65 activities are also regulated by direct  phosphorylation of their transactivation domain. Recently, two IKK non-canonical  homologues, IKKepsilon and TBK-1 (TANK binding kinase-1) have been identified with  functions distinct from the classical IKKalpha/IKKbeta. TBK-1/IKKepsilon trigger  antiviral immunity through direct phosphorylation of the IRF3/IRF7 transcription  factors, which are key regulators of the interferon response. Since IKKepsilon  modulates the activity of IRF3/IRF7, it is of interest to assess whether  IKKepsilon/TBK-1 also regulates the transactivation activity of NF-kappaB. Our  hypothesis was that IKKepsilon/TBK-1 modulates the activity of cRel by direct  phosphorylation of its transactivation domain (TD). In this study, we demonstrate  that IKKepsilon and TBK-1 directly phosphorylate cRel in vitro and in vivo. Two of  the three consensus sequences recognized by IKKepsilon/TBK-1 in the cRel TD are  directly phosphorylated by IKKepsilon. cRel was translocated to the nucleus in cells  expressing wild type versus kinase dead variant. The expression of IKKepsilon  increases c-Rel transactivation in reporter gene assays. Serine to alanine mutation  was further used to characterize the function of this phosphorylation at the level  of nuclear translocation and transactivation potential using immunofluorescence and  reporter gene assay. Furthermore, co-expression studies revealed that IKKepsilon and  not the kinase dead variant is responsible for cRel degradation in a dose-dependent  manner and this effect is partially revert</description><creator>Harris, Jennifer</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Biology, Molecular.</subject><title>Regulation of nuclear factor kappa B subunit c-Rel through phosphorylation by two IKK-related kinases, IKK epsilon and TBK-1</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9s161670x.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9z903047k</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Microbiology and Immunology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:p8418n798</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:52:06Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>A three-dimensional numerical model (PHOENICS) was used to  investigate the role of stream deflector angle and length on the flow field in a  rectangular laboratory flume. Subsequent bed topography surveys were performed to  examine the role of obstruction angle on scour hole development over time. The model  was capable of predicting laboratory velocity and turbulent kinetic energy  measurements, performing better for flow over a flat stable bed than over a deformed  sand bed. A new method of incorporating complex bed topography into a structured  Cartesian mesh was developed in the process. Flow field properties such as dynamic  pressure, velocity amplification, separation zone length and width, and downwelling  extent and magnitude were found to be strongly dependent on deflector geometry.  Equilibrium scour hole depths and geometry are also angle-dependent. A predictive  equation was produced explaining the rate at which scour holes reach equilibrium,  and compared well with existing literature. Finally, a method was developed whereby  characteristics of the flow field over a flat, stable bed could be used to predict  equilibrium scour hole geometry.</description><creator>Haltigin, Tim</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Fluid dynamics -- Mathematical models.</subject><subject>Groins (Shore protection)</subject><subject>Scour (Hydraulic engineering)</subject><subject>Fish habitat improvement.</subject><title>Three-dimensional numerical modeling of flow dynamics and investigation of temporal scour hole development around paired stream deflectors in a laboratory flume</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xw42n8566.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/p8418n798</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Geography</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:qz20st101</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:52:06Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The object of this thesis is to describe tissue classification  software that was developed specifically for the identification of cerebral white  matter lesions found in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Multiple sclerosis is  a debilitating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) which results in a  pathology observable macroscopically by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Lesion  volumes are used as a surrogate of disease progression in clinical trials for MS  treatment. The availability of accurate, reliable and reproducible measurements is  invaluable in the advancement of patient care and research into this disease. This  thesis documents a comprehensive approach to achieve such results which to date has  proven to be challenging. A novel fully automated Bayesian classifier was developed  which utilizes a variety of techniques to more accurately model brain tissue, and  performs lesion identification at a level comparable to human experts. A new  validation model that affords a better estimation of ground truth is introduced,  providing a better means to measure classification accuracy.

The simulated PDDs, profiles, output factors and wedge factors are in  good agreement with measured values. These models have been applied in the dose  calculation of lung cancer patients to investigate the effect of tissue  heterogeneity by comparing with the CADplan treatment planning system with and  without heterogeneity correction. Plan I and plan II for 8 patients have been  re-calculated with the Monte Carlo method. On average, the mean PTV dose calculated  with the Monte Carlo method is 2.4% higher than that calculated with CADplan without  correction but 2.5% lower than that with EqTAR correction. The Monte Carlo method  predicts 13% higher mean lung dose than CADplan without heterogeneity correction.  Because of this difference, the risk of radiation pneumonitis based on available  NTCP models will be underestimated. A relationship of mean lung dose between two  types of dose algorithms can be used to correct this  underestimation.</description><creator>Dai, Jinxian</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Biophysics, Medical.</subject><subject>Health Sciences, Radiology.</subject><subject>Physics, Radiation.</subject><subject>Health Sciences, Oncology.</subject><title>Validation of Monte Carlo techniques for 3D-CRT of lung cancer patients and comparative evaluation of treatment plans</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/x920fx423.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/w3763741v</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Medical Radiation Physics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:zw12z587v</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:52:08Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Background. Vertebral deformities are important sequelae of  osteoporosis, but for feasibility and technical reasons their epidemiology has yet  to be thoroughly described in Canada, especially in men. Objective. To estimate the incidence of osteoporotic vertebral  deformities, from data collected by the Canadian Multicentre Osteoporosis Study  (CaMos), a large cohort study of randomly selected Canadians radiographed at a five  year interval. Methods. Sex- and age-specific incidence was estimated in men  and women aged 55 years and older. Bayesian methods were employed, including  adjustment for nonresponse and attrition biases using multiple imputation. Different  assumptions for the missing data mechanism were used in a sensitivity  analysis. Results. Weighted to the Canadian population, men aged 55+ have  a crude incidence estimate of 17.7/1000 person-years (PY) (95% CrI: 13.5 - 22.1),  whereas the corresponding estimate in women is 14.6/1000 PY (95% CrI: 12.2 - 17.1).  Adjustment for bias due to attrition has only a slight effect on the estimates in  women across all age groups and in men aged 65+ years, under the assumption that the  missing data mechanism is ignorable. The rate estimates that are adjusted for both  nonresponse and attrition biases variably diverge from the crude estimates both in  magnitude and direction, depending on the assumptions made about the missing data  mechanism. Conclusions. A reasonable assumption for modeling the missing  data mechanism is that the sex- and age-specific biases are at least as large, and  in the same direction, as the differences between the respondent rates and the  imputed rates for groups with missing deformity data. Therefore, in Canadians aged  55+ years, vertebral deformity rates that are adjusted for nonresponse and attrition  biases are estimated as 14.4/1000 PY (95% CrI: 11.8 - 17.4) in women, and 23.8/1000  PY (95% CrI: 19.6 - 29.0) in men.</description><creator>Carrière, Philippe</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Health Sciences, Public Health.</subject><subject>Biology, Biostatistics.</subject><title>Estimating the incidence of vertebral deformities in Canadian men and women</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4t64gn79g.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zw12z587v</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:bg257f712</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:52:08Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The family of Crk adaptor proteins is integral to the molecular  signaling of cellular migration. Only limited research has demonstrated a role in  human carcinogenesis. Through the analysis of human breast cancers with  immunohistochemistry, there is a near significant association implicating Crk  proteins over-expression and a worsened overall survival. There was no statistical  difference in a relation to nodal status. The RNA interference of Crk in human  cancer cell lines caused a significant decrease in cell migration. This in vitro  suppression of a malignant characteristic could provide a new avenue towards the  molecular targeting of breast cancer that may eventually benefit patient  outcomes.</description><creator>Chan, Gabriel</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Biology, Molecular.</subject><subject>Health Sciences, Oncology.</subject><title>The role of Crk adaptor proteins in human breast cancer /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9c67wn45d.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bg257f712</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Surgical Research</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:z890rt979</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:52:09Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Objective. To examine the association between non-steroidal  anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use and end stage renal disease (ESRD) among  hypertensive subjects. Study design. We conducted a nested case-control study within a  cohort of 77,887 hypertensive adult subjects within the province of Saskatchewan,  Canada. Outcome. The primary outcome was ESRD, defined by chronic  dialysis or renal transplantation. Exposure. NSAID exposure was determined using prescription  records, for various time windows up to 10 years preceding the onset of end stage  renal disease. Statistical analysis. Rate ratios (RR) were estimated with 95%  confidence intervals using conditional logistic regression, adjusting for potential  confounding variables and stratified for effect modifiers. Results. We identified 397 cases and 7,399 controls. In subjects  followed for at least 10 years continuous NSAID use was observed in 20.8% of cases  and 17.9% of controls (RR = 1.18, 95% CI 0.68--2.05). Additionally, neither early  (RR = 1.10, 95% CI 0.50--2.41) nor late (RR = 0.81, 95% CI 0.32--2.04) NSAID  exposure was associated with ESRD during this time period. Evaluation of other time  windows (0--2 years, 2--5 years and 5--10 years) and NSAID dosing provided similar  results. Results were not modified by loop diuretic and angiotensin converting  enzyme inhibitor use. Conclusion. Up to 10 years of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory  drug use does not appear to influence the development of end stage renal disease.  These results however may be influenced by unmeasured co-morbidities and confounding  by "contra-indication".</description><creator>Beaubien, Eliot R.</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Health Sciences, Medicine and Surgery.</subject><subject>Biology, Animal Physiology.</subject><title>Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and the risk of end stage renal disease in hypertensive individuals</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0r9674255.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z890rt979</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><resumptionToken completeListSize="47894">oai_etdms.s(Collection:theses).f(2019-10-16T06:03:34Z).u(2020-07-23T18:55:55Z).t(47894):35450</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>
