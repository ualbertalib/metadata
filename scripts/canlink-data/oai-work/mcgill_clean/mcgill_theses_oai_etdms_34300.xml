The thesis first examines the extent to which debt covenants alleviate these agency problems, and how they affect a borrower's debt financing decisions. Then, building on recent theories on the costs of bank financing, the dissertation suggests a new economic rationale for debt covenants as instruments that can reduce these costs. The thesis consists of three essays: The first essay shows that, debt covenants create underinvestment incentives while reducing the overinvestment cost of debt It also finds that the borrower's choice between different contracts with, and without covenants, depends on the magnitude of the agency problems, and the quality of the lender's monitoring technology. The second essay shows how debt covenants reduce the costs of banks information monopoly. In fact, contingent contracting with debt covenants can be used by banks to precommit against using their informational advantage to hold up borrowers and extract rents, thus giving borrowers incentives to exert greater effort. The third essay shows that the renegotiation that debt covenants permit, can reduce liquidity risk defined as the risk that a solvent but illiquid borrower is unable to obtain refinancing. It also shows that a debt contract with covenants is similar to a mix of debt contracts with different maturities. The thesis concludes with a review of the determinants of corporate debt maturity structure, and the literature on corporate reliance on bank financing and suggests future research in this area.</description><creator>Sy, Amadou Nicolas Racine.</creator><contributor>Detemple, Jerome (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1998</date><subject>Bank loans -- Mathematical models.</subject><subject>Corporate debt.</subject><subject>Intermediation (Finance)</subject><title>Essays in debt covenants</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vm40xt489.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/tt44pp73j</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Faculty of Management</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:t722hb45s</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:44:42Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Human colour vision is subserved by three photoreceptor, or cone, types. To optimise the coding of natural colour scenes, the neural projections from these cones are recombined in the retina to form the postreceptoral mechanism. Several psychophysical studies (e.g., Krauskopf et al., 1982; Cole et al., 1993) have consistently revealed three principal postreceptoral mechanisms, termed red-green, blue-yellow and luminance (or achromatic). However, it is still unknown whether these are the only three mechanisms responsible for the detection of coloured stimuli. In fact, recent studies (e.g., Gegenfurtner &amp; Kiper, 1992) propose the existence of additional postreceptoral detection mechanisms. These studies measured contrast sensitivity in the presence of noise masking that effectively desensitised the principal mechanisms so that other mechanisms might be observed. In this thesis, we have, for the first time, applied to this technique a colour representation (cone contrast space) that provides a more suitable framework with which to study the postreceptoral mechanisms and their cone inputs. We used psychophysical techniques to address three specific questions: (1) the number of postreceptoral mechanisms, (2) the functional composition of each mechanism, and (3) the manner in which the mechanism responses are combined to yield the detectability of a given stimulus. Our investigation produced three main results: (1) there are only three postreceptoral mechanisms, (2) each postreceptoral mechanism consists of an opponent pair of submechanisms, and (3) the responses of the three postreceptoral mechanisms at detection threshold are combined according to a model of probability summation. The third result suggests that the mechanism responses can be treated as probabilities of seeing a given stimulus, and that these three responses are statistically independent. A final result shows that suprathreshold discrimination depends on the ratio of postreceptoral mechanism responses, indicative of a simple mechanism for hue discrimination.</description><creator>Sankeralli, Marcel John.</creator><contributor>Galiana, Henrietta (Supervisor)</contributor><contributor>Mullen, Kathy (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1998</date><subject>Engineering, Biomedical.</subject><subject>Biophysics, General.</subject><title>Investigation of the chromatic postreceptoral detection mechanisms of human colour vision using noise masking in cone contrast space</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8g84mp03p.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/t722hb45s</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biomedical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:v692t805n</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:44:42Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The present study examines science education policies in three selected developed countries and compares them with science education policies in Lebanon in order to identify their potential reform policies and practices applicable to Lebanon. The selection of the three countries, the U.S.A., U.K., and Japan, was based on the amount of time and effort devoted in these countries to improving and modernizing their science education policies and curricula. Three aspects of secondary science curriculum policy in the chosen countries were analyzed and compared with those of Lebanon. These were: aims and objectives; pattern of science program including the science curriculum, the amount of time allotted to the study of science and the content of school science subjects; and the organization of school science including science requirement for graduation from high school, teaching strategies and mode of examinations. The data collected for analysis from the three chosen countries showed that, unlike Lebanon, in the three developed countries: education is compulsory up to at least the age of 16; aims and objectives are stated clearly and carefully; science is an integrated subject in the first year of secondary level, then it becomes separated into chemistry, physics and biology. The content of science subjects emphasizes the method and process of science and its application to the society. Examinations are designed to evaluate students' learning in science in contrast to Lebanon where examinations are designed to discriminate among students.</description><creator>Sarraf, Lina.</creator><contributor>LeMaistre, Kate (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1998</date><subject>Science -- Study and teaching -- Lebanon.</subject><subject>Education and state -- Lebanon.</subject><title>A proposal for science education policies in Lebanon based on trends in selected developed countries over the last twenty years /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ms35tb14r.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/v692t805n</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Educational Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:w9505222b</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:44:43Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Effective gender research requires a revision of the meaning of the current notions of agency (masculinity) and communion (femininity), as well as a close examination of the impact of these constructs on well-being outcomes. Based on V. S. Helgeson's (1994) model of sex, agency, communion, and well-being, two studies were conducted to (1) examine the concepts of agency and communion in a multidimensional manner; (2) assess and review the association between agency and mental health through the inclusion of peer reports and a relevant meta-analysis; (3) explore the association between agency and social adjustment, including two pertinent meta-analyses; and (4) empirically assess conceptual parallels among the constructs of agency and communion with the following personality-related constructs: Masculine and feminine traits, agentic and communal behaviors, power and intimacy motivation, and self-critical and dependent depressive styles, as well as their association with well-being outcomes. Findings reveal a positive association between agency and social adjustment, suggest a possible tendency to inflate levels of psychological adjustment in agentic individuals, and highlight the need to revise the concepts of agency and communion as encompassing multiple as opposed to uniform dimensions. Each dimension can lead to diverse well-being outcomes. Lastly, these studies call into question the need to postulate unmitigated forms of agency and communion. Taken as a whole, this work provides evidence for the complexity of the relations between gender and well-being.</description><creator>Saragovi, Carina.</creator><contributor>Koestner, Richard (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1998</date><subject>Adjustment (Psychology)</subject><subject>Masculinity</subject><subject>Femininity</subject><title>The multiple dimensions of agency and communion and their associations to well-being /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/js956h635.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/w9505222b</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Psychology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:8p58pf66h</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:44:43Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The development of intelligent components for the automated analysis of samples by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) Spectrometry is presented. An expert system for diagnosing an ICP atomic emission spectrometry (AES) system using a blank solution was developed as a warning system. This expert system was able to warn the system of major malfunctions and was able to identify most problems. Three pattern recognition techniques were compared in their ability to recognize similar geological samples in small databases. Two of these techniques, k-Nearest Neighbours and Bayesian Classification, worked extremely well with over 96% success. The development of an objective function for multi-element optimizations in ICP-AES is presented. Various aspects of the application of a Simplex optimization were explored for the optimization of the ion optics of an ICP-mass spectrometry (MS) system. An algorithm for the automatic selection of internal standards for analytes in difficult samples in ICP-MS is presented.</description><creator>Sartoros, Christine.</creator><contributor>Salin, Eric D.

NaOH-CP and CA-CP each resulted in precipitation of one protein mainly consisting of glycinin and beta-conglycinin, respectively. The proteins were subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), SDS-PAGE, size exclusion-chromatography (SEC) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) for characterization. PAGE, SDS-PAGE, SEC and DSC confirmed the homogeneity of NaOH-CP. The gelation properties and structural characteristics of NaOH-CP were investigated; the minimum protein concentration required for formation of a thermally-induced gel from NaOH-CP was 8%. With cold-set gelation, in the presence of 30 mM CaCl2, the minimum protein concentration required for formation of a self-supporting gel was 4%. At 100 mM CaCl 2, cold-set gelation of 10% protein concentration gave gel of strength 7.4 N compared to the 7.8 N gel strength obtained with thermally-induced gel at 16% protein concentration. The effects of heating on the NaOH-CP structure, in the presence of varying concentrations of NaCl and reducing agents, were examined by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and DSC. FTIR spectroscopy revealed that at 25°C the NaOH-CP protein showed four bands at 1633, 1650, 1667, and 1689 cm-1. At 85°C, the temperature associated with gelation, the four bands decreased in intensity with the simultaneous increase in the intensity of a band at 1644 cm-1 as result of the protein unfolding, furthermore two new bands at 1616 and 1685 cm -1 appeared. The latter two bands are attributed to intermolecular mu-sheet formed during gelation. The NaOH-CP did not exhibit any aggregation band between 25--100°C in the presence of NaCl.

A literature review was conducted and a program of research was devised with the goal of improving understanding of why many appropriately treated and educated asthmatics are unable to gain adequate control of their asthma. A review of the literature found that psychological stress was a poorly understood trigger for asthmatic symptoms and a possible factor in poor asthma control. A clinic visit study of adult asthmatics found: (1) life event stress was associated with asthma quality of life but not ventilatory function, (2) asthma self-efficacy was strongly related to asthma quality of life and ventilatory function, (3) style of coping with stress appeared to buffer the effects of stress on asthma, and (4) evidence for a stress-responsive asthmatic subgroup. A subsequent longitudinal daily diary study found: (1) concurrent stress and daily asthma symptoms were strongly associated, (2) daily bronchodilator use appeared to be determined by pre-diary beliefs about disease severity and controllability, (3) stress could precede (within one day) increases in asthma symptoms and decreases in airflow, and (4) clinically significant decreases in peak flow were often preceded by large increases in perceived stress. A laboratory study found: (1) exposure of asthmatics to specific passive and asthma-related stressors resulted in decreased airflow and that these decreases are associated with a concurrent increase in vagal (parasympathetic) tone, (2) an active stressor that resulted in increased sympathetic arousal did not result in decreased airflow, (3) relaxation resulted in parasympathetic arousal and decreased airflow, and (4) asthma self-efficacy was associated with parasympathetic reactivity. In sum, the program of research has generated findings that help explain how stress, coping and self-efficacy contribute to asthma control led to concrete suggestions to improve c</description><creator>Aboussafy, David, 1969-</creator><contributor>Aboud, Frances (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1999</date><subject>Asthma -- Psychosomatic aspects.</subject><subject>Self-efficacy.</subject><subject>Asthma.</subject><title>Stress, coping, self-efficacy and asthma control : clinic, diary and laboratory studies</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/hd76s185c.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8049g675n</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Psychology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:jw827d39b</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:44:44Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Phosphate ester linkages are omnipresent in nature and are found in many biologically important molecules such as DNA, RNA and ATP. Many enzymes that hydrolyze phosphate esters are activated by metal ions. Since the structure of biological enzymes can be quite complicated, it is often useful to work with simpler artificial metalloenzymes to help elucidate the mechanisms by which phosphate ester hydrolysis is activated by metals. In principle, simple dinuclear metal complexes could hydrolyze phosphate esters by double Lewis acid activation or by a combination of single Lewis acid activation and metal-hydroxide activation. These two mechanisms are kinetically indistinguishable. In this study, two different phosphate substrates are used to distinguish these mechanisms. Lanthanide (iii) salts have proven extraordinarily effective in accelerating the rate of phosphate ester hydrolysis by several orders of magnitude. Consequently, there has been much effort in recent years to develop a ligand that would bind lanthanides so as to further improve their ability to hydrolyze phosphates. These efforts have met with limited success. Reported here is a dinuclear lanthanide (iii) complex which hydrolyzes BNPP (bis p-nitrophenyl phosphate) with unprecedented reactivity at pH 7.0 and 25°C. A mononuclear copper (ii) 6,6'-diamino-2,2 '-bipyridyl complex is synthesized which gives one of the fastest rate accelerations reported for hydrolyzing 2',3 '-cAMP. A hydrogen bonding mechanism is proposed for the acceleration of the rate of hydrolysis of the cyclic phosphate.</description><creator>Williams, Daniel M.</creator><contributor>Chin, Jik (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1999</date><subject>Chemistry, Inorganic.</subject><title>Phosphate ester hydrolysis promoted by lanthanide (III) and transition metal complexes</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/jh343t83p.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/jw827d39b</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Chemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:j098zc88t</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:44:45Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Jerry Fodor has argued that virtually all lexical concepts are innate.

This catalyst technology provides us with a unique opportunity to study the effects of molecular structure on the rheological behavior of polyethylene. In particular the effects of low levels of long chain branching (LCB) have never been studied in commercial polyethylenes, because it was impossible to vary the degree of branching while maintaining the backbone molecular weight and molecular weight distribution using traditional polymerization techniques. Nine constrained geometry catalyzed and metallocene polyethylenes (together referred to as mPE) with approximately the same MWDs but varying degrees of LCB were subjected to an intensive study including linear viscoelastic behavior and nonlinear shear and extensional flow behavior. Using these results, it was found that low levels of LCB manifest themselves mostly in the linear regime and not in nonlinear extensional flow behavior as was previously thought. LCB extended the relaxation spectrum to longer relaxation times, increased the zero shear viscosity and the shear sensitivity, and resulted in a complex viscosity curve that was slightly sigmoidal in shape. It was also found that these branched materials followed the Cox-Merz rule and the Gleissle mirror relations. Separable stress relaxation behavior was exhibited in step strain experiments with increasing degree of LCB resulting in increasing damping. LCB increased the nonlinearity in the fluids' response to large amplitude oscillatory shear (LAOS). The damping functions determined from step strain experiments were consistent with experimental data for steady simple shear and LAOS. A study of the effect of molecular weight and short chain branching On the linear viscoelastic behavior was also performed. A set of three additional linear mPEs with the same polydispersities but varying average molecular weights was studied. The usual exponential dependence of the zero shear viscosity on the molecular weight was found with coefficient and exponent values consistent with previously reported results for polyethylene. To determine the effect of short chain branching a set of three butene copolymers with the same polydispersity but varying degrees of SCB was included. It was found that any effect of SCB on the LVE behavior was smaller than the variation in the experimental data. A procedure was developed for inferring the degree of LCB using linear viscoelastic data and backbone MWD information. Such a procedure is particularly important in the case of ethylene-octene copolymers for which it is difficult to measure the degree of long chain branching using nuclear magnetic resonance techniques. This technique was shown to be robust and not likely to give false predictions of LCB in the case of linear materials. A method for evaluating the reliability of the predicted degree of LCB that involves only complex viscosity data was also presented.</description><creator>Wood-Adams, Paula.</creator><contributor>Dealy, J.

The study was designed as a population-based, case-control study of incident, primary lung cancer. It was carried out between 1992 and 1994 among nonsmoking women living in Shanghai, People's Republic of China, and data for 504 case subjects and 601 control subjects were collected and analyzed. Exposure to tobacco smoke from the husbands of subjects was not found to be associated with all types of lung cancer combined, although increased risks were observed for nonadenocarcinomas of the lung. Exposure to environmental tobacco smoke at work conferred excess risks in all histological subtypes. In addition, risks increased with increasing numbers of hours of daily exposure to environmental tobacco smoke in the workplace and with increasing numbers of smoking coworkers, but risk did not increase with increasing numbers of years that subjects were exposed to the tobacco smoke from coworkers. Increased risks of lung cancer were found for a variety of indices representing exposure to indoor air pollutants from Chinese-style cooking, including not having a separate kitchen, heating cooking oils to high temperatures (about 280°C), and most often cooking with rapeseed oil. Similar patterns of risk were found across the different histological subtypes. Lung cancer risks were also associated with a higher frequency of eye irritation, greater extent of smokiness in the kitchen during cooking, with a more than daily use of stir-frying, and with a more than weekly use of deep-frying and frying. The risks of lung cancer were lower if a fume extractor was used and decreased with increasing ventilation, as measured by increasing area of the windows in the apartment. In conclusion, long-term occupational exposure to environmental tobacco smoke increases the risk of lung cancer among women who were lifetime nonsmokers. Exposure to indoor air pollution from Chinese-style cooking, especially cooking unrefined rapeseed oil at high temperatures in woks, also increases the risk of lung cancer.</description><creator>Zhong, Lijie, 1962-</creator><contributor>Goldberg, Mark S.

CUTL1 encodes for the human Cut protein, a homeodomain protein that was shown to bind to the promoter of the c-Myc proto-oncogene and repress its expression. As a first step in trying to determine whether CUTL1 is a tumor suppressor gene, we verified whether this gene is located within the chromosomal region that is deleted in human cancers. High resolution maps containing the CUTL1 genomic DNA were constructed in lambda phage, cosmid and PAC clones. Three (CA)n microsatellite polymorphic markers were identified within CUTL1 genomic DNA and were used in loss of heterozygosity (LOH) studies using genomic DNA from uterine leiomyomas and matched normal myometrium. LOH at 7q22 was demonstrated in 7 out 50 uterine leiomyomas samples, and the smallest commonly deleted region included CUTL1. Northern blot analysis revealed that CUTL1 mRNA levels were reduced in 8 out of 13 uterine leiomyomas. In parallel studies, the Cut protein was found to interact with Polyomavirus large T (PyLT) protein in breast tumors and uterine leiomyomas that arise in transgenic mice expressing PyLT. Since LT was known to inactivate two tumor suppressors with which it interacts, Rb and p53, we hypothesized that genetic alterations to CUTL1 may occur in human breast cancers. Loss of heterozygosity at 7q22 was found in 18.2% (12/66) of sporadic breast tumors. The deleted region at 7q22 in every case included one or more of the three CUTL1 polymorphic markers. LOH at 7q22 was associated with increased tumor size, but not with tumor types and grades. The exon-intron structure of CUTL1 was determined and several CUTL1 mRNA isoforms have been identified and characterized. All isoforms were found to be expressed in all tissues and tumor cells tested. Comparison of cDNA sequences with the CUTL1 genomic structure revealed a complex pattern of alternative transcription initiation, splicing and polyadenylation. Interestingly, transcription can starts in two genomic regions, and the choice between alternative polyadenylation sites and splice acceptor sites appears to be dictated by the nature of the first exon or associated promoter sequences.</description><creator>Zeng, Rong Wendy, 1968-</creator><contributor>Nepveu, Alain (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1998</date><subject>Biology, Molecular.</subject><subject>Health Sciences, Oncology.</subject><title>Loss of heterozygosity of the CUTL1 gene in uterine leiomyomas and breast cancers</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rr171z90g.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/44558f93p</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Experimental Medicine</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:b5644t286</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:44:46Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Plasma acylation stimulating protein (ASP) is a small basic protein isolated from human plasma that stimulates triglyceride synthesis (TGS) and glucose transport (GT) in human skin fibroblasts and adipocytes. ASP was measured in fasting samples of 59 age-matched controls and 208 patients with documented coronary artery, disease (CAD). Overall, plasma ASP was higher in the CAD patients than in the controls and within the CAD patients, plasma ASP was highest in the group that had neither an FHTG-type (hypertriglyceridemic normal apoB) nor an FH-type (marked hypercholesterolemia and apoB with normal plasma triglyceride) phenotype. The relations between plasma ASP, triglyceride rich lipoproteins and apoB in the remaining CAD subjects were examined and ASP increased with either increasing triglyceride or apoB. In 208 CAD subjects, 47 subjects had ASP greater than 95th percentile (greater than 65 nM). Within those 47 subjects, 66% had increased plasma apoB (apoB &gt; 105mg/dl). The relationship between ASP and hyperapoB (apoB &gt; 105mg/dl) was further investigated in cell culture study. Human skin fibroblasts were obtained from normals and hyperapoB patients. The fibroblasts from the three groups of subjects (normal subjects:NASP-NB, hyperapoB subjects with normal plasma ASP:NASP-HB, and hyperapoB subjects with high plasma ASP:HASP-HB) were studied for TGS and GT in response to ASP, PMA (4beta phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, a protein-kinase C stimulator) and insulin stimulation. The competition binding of 125I ASP to the fibroblasts from the three groups of subjects was also examined. The data showed that only HASP-HB cells have a lower response to ASP in TGS and GT. The responses to insulin and PMA in TGS and GT are normal. There is no significant difference among the three groups in the Kd values (NASP-NB Kd: 163 +/- 23nM) for binding to 125I ASP. The Bmax value for the H ASP-HB group is 50% lower than the other two groups (N ASP-NB:NASP-HB:HASP-H B: 334 +/- 81:427 +/- 92:146 +/- 33 pmoles/mg cell protein). The reduced receptor of ASP on the cell surface of HASP-H B patients can lead to the reduced response to ASP.</description><creator>Zhang, Xiaojing, 1967-</creator><contributor>Cianflone, Katherine (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1999</date><subject>Biology, Animal Physiology.</subject><title>Acylation stimulating protein and hyperapobetalipoproteinemia</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pz50gx83w.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/b5644t286</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Experimental Medicine</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:z029p643w</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:44:46Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>A catalyzed chemimechanical-anthraquinone pulping of black spruce wood was investigated in this study. The effect of liquor pH on anthraquinone performance, AQ and mass transfer limitations on chemimechanical pulp properties and the effects of AQ, liquor pH and sulphite concentration on pulping kinetic were studied. It was observed that AQ was not an effective redox catalyst when added to the sulphite liquor at pH 4, but it was very effective at pH 7 and higher. When chemical treatment of chemimechanical pulping was done with the presence of AQ, the sulphur content of pulp was reduced due to preferential reaction of AQ with wood components. AQ, as a pulping agent, is much effective in increasing the delignification rate and at the same time protecting the degradation of carbohydrates. Pulps produced from wood wafers with cooking liquor at pH 7 containing 0.1% of AQ on oven dry wood, exhibited the following improved properties when compared with those prepared without addition of AQ: increased pulping rate, higher pulp yield and carbohydrates yield at the same level of residual lignin in pulp, and in addition, the strength properties such as breaking length and burst strength improved by 15% even with a minimum AQ charge (0.05% and 0.01%). With regular wood chips, the penetration of sulphite seems to be superior to that of AQ. It was observed that AQ was not uniformly distributed in the impregnated wood chips even when the compression ratio was increased from 3.5:1 to 5:1. The penetration of AQ into wood chips remains to be a major factor affecting the pulping rate and pulp properties (strength and brightness) in chemimechanical-AQ pulping. The rate of delignification in the initial phase of both sulphite and sulphite-AQ cooking at pH 7 shows the second order reaction in the remaining lignin. The order with respect to sulphite concentration for sulphite and sulphite-AQ cooking were estimated to be 0.24 and 0.31, respectively. The activation energies of delignification of the initial phase in sulphite and sulphite-AQ pulping were 90.2 and 97.5 kJ/mole which was valid up to 30% lignin removal within the temperature range of 160°C and 175°C. AQ as a pulping additive introduced to the sulphite liquor increased the rate of delignification 1.5 times in the initial phase of delignification during the sulphite cooking process. At initial pH of sulphite liquor ranging from 7 to 10, the rate of delignification in the initial phase during sulphite and sulphite-AQ cooking appears to be a second order reaction in the remaining lignin. The reaction orders with respect to sulphite concentration increases when the initial pH is below 8 and decreases when the initial pH is above 8 for both sulphite and sulphite-AQ cooking. The raw of delignificafion is dependent on the initial pH of cooking liquor and the addition of AQ.</description><creator>Wang, Biao, 1963-</creator><contributor>Kubes, G. J.

However, there are some reports which contend that AFP-mediated immunosuppression is not an inherent property of the molecule itself, but is instead, hypothesized to be either a function of a low molecular weight inhibitor bound to AFP or to a post-translational modification of the protein. To resolve these issues, the present thesis examines the possible contributory roles of endogenous and exogenous ligands, including TGF-beta2, and post-translational modifications in AFP-mediated immunoregulation. We were able to abundantly express rAFP's in bacterial, baculovirus and yeast expression systems. The next series of studies that were performed examined the contribution of post-synthetic biochemical modifications to AFP-mediated immunosuppression. The results of these studies establish that both rAFP's are functionally equivalent to one another, as well as to natural fetal derived AFP. These results prompted an in-depth investigation into the identification of the immunoregulatory active site(s) within the AFP molecule. Having established that putative ligands as well as post-translational modifications do not impart immunomodulatory activity to AFP, cDNA's encoding mouse AFP domains were generated by PCR and produced in a yeast expression system. An equally important, yet not extensively studied biological activity of AFP, is its hematopoietic growth factor property. We show that there is an increased number of viable bone marrow (BM) cells cultured in AFP versus albumin supplemented cultures or media alone. Furthermore, the data suggest that AFP may be retarding the progression of programmed cell death of hematopoietic cells in serum free cultures.

The components are: a particulate heater, medium and grain mixer, separation unit and aeration unit. Comparative tests showed that particulate medium heating was 5 times faster and 87% more efficient than convective heating. Although the drying efficiency was 95% higher in the convection system, the overall use of input energy was 28% higher in the Processor. Drying of corn was investigated at 500kg/h. High moisture removal was achieved at initial moisture contents of 19% and 24% using salt at initial medium temperature of 250ºC. The highest moisture removal achieved was 6.17% (w.b.) with a corn flow rate of 500 kg/h, initial moisture content of 19%, initial medium temperature of 250°C, and a 60 s contact time. Soybean was roasted in the Processor at 500 kg/h. Initial medium temperatures of 175, 200 and 250°C resulted in grain temperatures of 104, 107 and 127°C, respectively, for a contact time of 60 s. An average of 4.11% (w.b.) moisture reduction was achieved from commercially dried soybean at 6.8% initial moisture content. A preliminary study showed grain temperatures over 67°C was sufficient to achieve 100% insect mortality of Sitophilus granarius for a 30 s exposure. These temperature and contact time data were used for evaluating the possibility of thermal disinfestation using the Processor. Tests on wheat processed at 1000 kg/h showed that grain temperatures rose to between 69.8°C and 72.9°C for exposure times of 60s. These results were achieved at thermal efficiencies of 43% and 49% respectively. Estimated cost of disinfestation using the machine was CAN$ 0.385/t. Seed quality wheat was processed to determine parameters leading to total thermal de-germination. Tests were conducted at 40, 60, 80 and 100°C. Total de-germination of the wheat seed was found to occur at temperatures over 80°C for an exposure time of 60 s.</description><creator>Sotocinal, Samson A.</creator><contributor>Raghavan, Vijaya G.

A pulsed arc system is used to perform preliminary experiments on the arc mobility for the different types of graphite for the selection of proper material morphology and the design of a continuous vacuum arc system. The characteristics of arc mobility, erosion rate, and carbon ion flux emitted from the continuous carbon source are then evaluated in view of particle-free diamond-like protective coatings. Results show that the arc spot velocity on graphite cathodes is larger on cathodes having larger grain size, lower electrical resistivity and higher apparent density. The spot velocity is also lower for cathodes having larger pore sizes and total porosity. The arc spot velocity is also found to be increased by increasing the magnetic field intensity over the surface of any graphite type. Reduced residence time of the spot on a given site of the cathode resulting from arc velocity increase should lead to a reduction in the heat load input in the cathode spot. This correlates with results on the number of emitted particles, the film thickness and roughness, and the erosion rate that are found to decrease, while the ion flux emission is increased. Diamond-like carbon (DLC) films free of particles are produced in a continuous arc ion plating (AIP) system. The ion energy in the continuous AIP system is found to vary with the graphite surface properties and the intensity of a plasma confining magnetic field in front of the cathode. The ion energies measured vary between 39.8 eV to 62.6 eV.</description><creator>Kandah, Munther.</creator><contributor>Meunier, J.-L.

The kinetics of infusion volume showed a quadratic reduction in absorption which approached zero on the sixth day for non-irrigated plants. The concentration of 45Ca increased quadratically from the point of injection towards the apex independent of both water status and plant parts. The difference in concentration of 45Ca between irrigated and non-irrigated plants was significant (P &lt; 0.05) and concentrations attained the maximum values at the sixth node from the plant base. Seeds contained considerably less 45Ca than either stem or leaves. The effects of a long (LD, 16h) and a short (SD, 12h) photoperiod with two water stress levels (SL) of stress (ST) and no stress (NS) on the distribution of 45Ca in plant organs (PO) of leaves, petioles, and stem at different node number (NN) of soybean were studied during the seed-filling stage. The univariate and Manova analyses showed the main effects of photoperiod (PP), SL, and PO to be highly significant (P &lt; 0.001) on Ca distribution. The long PP increased Ca concentration in top leaves compared with the short PP regardless of SL. Water stress significantly (P &lt; 0.001) modified the Ca distribution and reduced its concentration in PO within NN irrespective of the photoperiod (a measure of light stress). A possible mechanism for the regulation of Ca distribution is discussed in terms of nitrate reduction. Ca uptake was also studied by immersing the central tip of a trifoliate leaf in various concentrations of 45CaCl2 solutions and drought conditions during the seed-filling period of soybean. The beta-ray gauging and the diurnal leaf temperature variation showed similar characteristics for leaf water status. The activities of 45Ca were significantly higher (P &lt; 0.0001) at 5, 10, 20, and 30 mM concentrations for water-stressed and non-stressed leaves compared with the control. 45Ca activities at 5, 10, and 20 mM Ca concentrations between stressed and non-stressed leaves were not significant, but the difference in their mean values at 30 mM Ca concentration was significant (P = 0.0159). The relationship between 45Ca uptake and Ca concentration was parabolic for both stressed (R 2 = 0.77) and non-stressed (R2 = 0.81) leaves. Autoradiograms indicated Ca movement through the mid-rib and veins of the tip-immersed trifoliate leaf but showed no activity in other plant parts. An activity gradient developed between seeds when a pod-tip was immersed in the radioactive solution. Solutions of ruthenium red (RR, 0.01 mM), Ethylene Glycol-bis-(beta-aminoethyl ether)- N,N,N,N-Tetraacetic Acid (EGTA, 0.1 mM), calcium (Ca, 1 mM), and double distilled water (control) were fed through a bottom branch of soybean with (ST) and without (NS) water stress. The volume absorptions and transpiration rates were significantly higher for NS than ST plants and decreased almost linearly with time for all treatments. The transpiration rates of Ca-feeding ST plants and the control overlapped while the NS plants approached the same rate of transpiration by the third week. Ca was implicated in stomatal closure for the reduction in the transpiration rates. The relative amounts of chlorophyll decreased with time but chlorophyll was least affected for Ca-absorbing plants for both ST and NS plants. The use of RR (Ca transport blocker), and EGTA (Ca chelator) indicated the role of intracellular Ca concentrations on stomatal c10sure and foliar senescence at the end of
the season.</description><creator>Sorooshzadeh, Ali.</creator><contributor>Barthakur, N. N.

Pectin methylesterase (PME), as the most heat resistant enzyme, in orange juice and Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Lactobacillus plantarum, as the most common spoilage yeast and bacteria, respectively, in apple juice used as indicators were subjected to heat treatment in a well-agitated water bath. Based on gathered time-temperature profiles, effective portions of the come-up (CUT) and come-down (CDT) times (lags) were determined for inclusion in kinetic data handling. The inactivation/destruction kinetics followed typical first-order rate of reactions. A continuous-flow microwave heating system was set up and evaluated for obtaining kinetic parameters under microwave heating conditions. The outlet temperature was characterized as a function of fluid flow rate, heating volume and initial temperature. Kinetics of enzyme inactivation and microbial destruction at various temperatures under continuous-flow microwave heating conditions were then evaluated using the technique established above. The rates of inactivation/destruction varied depending on temperature. Taking into consideration the effectiveness of the CUT and contributory thermal inactivation during the CDT, the D-values were found to vary from 38.5 s at 55°C to 1.32 s at 70°C (pH 3.7) for PME, 4.75 s at 52.5°C to 0.378 s at 60°C (pH 3.4) for S. cerevisiae (ATCC 16664) and 14.1 s at 57.5°C to 0.327 s at 65°C (pH 3.4) for L. plantarum (ATCC 14917). Some non-thermal microwave effects were hypothesized to exist and responsible for such differences between the two heating modes. Enzyme inactivation and microbial destruction were then studied further to evaluate the non-thermal effects. A continuous-flow microwave heating system was developed operating at full power while maintaining sample temperatures below 40°C by circulating a microwave-transparent liquid (kerosene) for immediate removal of heat produced in the juice during microwave exposure. In order to explain and better characterize the faster rate of inactivation/destruction associated with microwave heating conditions observed in kinetic studies, additional tests were carried out using the second set-up described above, but without the cooling heat exchanger. The temperature of samples of different sizes were allowed to progressively increase under carefully controlled conditions. Inactivation of PME in orange juice (pH 3.7) and destruction of S. cerevisiae in apple juice (pH 3.4) were again used as parameters. The results once again clearly demonstrated superior inactivation/destruction effects under microwave heating which increased with temperature and decreased with sample size.

This has been accomplished by: viewing the plasma axially; utilizing gaseous halogenating agents in the DSI cup; concentrating trace metals directly from solution onto activated charcoal DSI probes and developing an adsorption based preconcentration system specifically suited to DSI. The plasma was also imaged through interference filters with a high speed digital camera to provide information about the behavior of analyte vaporization from the DSI probe. In comparison to lateral viewing DSI detection limits are generally improved but are element specific when the plasma is viewed axially. In this viewing mode the incandescent DSI cup lies along the spectrometer's optical path and it appears that the plasma ingresses into the optical path above the cup and is responsible for an increased background signal and background noise that degrades detection limits. Detection limits could be further improved with a higher resolution spectrometer. New DSI instrumentation was constructed so that gases could be introduced into the DSI cup in the plasma. Carrier gases were introduced into the cup via a hollow stem resulting in a reduction in the background signal, notably in the longer wavelength region. When 1000 ppm Freon-12 in argon is used as a carrier through the center of the cup, the normally problematic refractory elements are vaporized easily. Trace metals were concentrated onto activated charcoal from solution. The charcoal was analyzed directly by placing several particles in a DSI cup or fabricating a DSI probe with an activated charcoal cap. Cleaning the charcoal, derived from wood, in the plasma prior to adsorption was necessary to remove trace metals. Detection limits in the tens to hundreds of parts per trillion were found for Pb, Cd, Zn and Cu. An automated preconcentration system that utilizes adsorption of metal chelates onto a C18 column has been constructed and evaluated. The metal chelates are desorbed with methanol and sprayed into an inductively heated graphite DSI cup. The detection limits of the current system are 20 to 800 times better than liquid nebulization detection limits on the same system. Images of calcium emission were acquired with a digital camera throughout the insertion. The diameter of the graphite cup has a dramatic effect on the plasma and calcium emission. Narrower cups disturb the plasma the least and keep the calcium within the center of the plasma. The use of a carrier gas through a graphite tube and hollow stem cup shows that a darker central channel is established. In the case of a deep and narrow graphite cup the analyte appears to emerge into the plasma along the walls of the cup.</description><creator>Skinner, Cameron D.</creator><contributor>Salin, Eric (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1997</date><subject>Chemistry, Analytical.</subject><title>Enhancement of direct sample insertion performance for inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5m60qt76z.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1n79h627j</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Chemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:1r66j2871</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:44:49Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The goal of this thesis is to present a detailed study of the second language acquisition (SLA) of English aspect by native speakers of Slavic languages. A parameterized distinction between English and Slavic aspect is proposed, in order to account for the subtle differences between English and Slavic telic and alelic sentences. Thus the thesis opens a new area of parameter research in SLA and studies in depth the mental representation of aspect in interlanguage. It is proposed that, the four aspectual classes of verbs (Vendler 1967), viz. accomplishments, achievements, activities and states, can be represented in four different phrase structure templates, projecting from the verb's lexical semantical structure and making reference to the properties of the object. It is argued that the four templates are language universals, and the parameterized distinctions between languages involve the syntactic positions of meaning-based primitive predicates like CAUSE, BECOME and BE (Dowty 1979). It is at this level that the English-Slavic contrast receives an explanation. Based on the syntax-theoretical treatment of Slavic and English aspect, the them investigates the process of SLA of aspect in Slavic speakers at three levels of proficiency in English: low intermediate, high intermediate and advanced. L2 learners are found to be capable of resetting the aspectual parameter value to the English setting, thus successfully acquiring a property of language almost never taught in language classrooms. The thesis also studies the acquisition of a cluster of constructions, which syntactic research relates to the English value of the aspectual parameter, and which have been found to appear together in the speech of English children (Snyder &amp; Stromswold 1997): Double Objects, Verb-Particles and Resultatives. Results indicate that every one of these constructions forms part of this aspect-related cluster and that knowledge of aspect and knowledge of the cluster co-occur. The results of the experimental studies bring new evidence to bear on the theoretical choice between direct access to the L2 value (Epstein, Flynn Martohardjono 1996, Flynn 1996) or starting out the process of acquisition with the L1 value of a parameter (Schwartz &amp; Sprouse 1994, 1996), supporting the latter view.</description><creator>Slabakova, Roumyana.</creator><contributor>White, Lydia (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1997</date><subject>Second language acquisition.</subject><subject>Grammar, Comparative and general -- Aspect.</subject><subject>English language -- Study and teaching -- Slavic speakers.</subject><title>Zero acquisition : second language acquisition of the parameter of aspect</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pr76f523b.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1r66j2871</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Linguistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:g732db68b</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:44:50Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>While the concept of multipotentiality is often referred to in the giftedness literature, implicit and explicit definitions of the concept change from author to author. Additionally, few empirical studies have been done to provide support for the many anecdotal claims made about multipotentiality. The present nine-year follow-up study (N = 180) of gifted youth (mean age = 20.2 years) provides evidence that many gifted individuals may indeed be multipotentialed. The definition of multipotentiality ("the ability and desire to pursue different activities and goals") used to operationalize the concept was validated by six experts in the field. Degree of multipotentiality was found to be significantly related to SES, verbal IQ, variety of interests and abilities, participation in leisure activities, answer-seeking, attitude towards school, and several scores derived from the 1993/94 administration of the Strong Interest Inventory. Multipotentiality was not, however, found to be related to Holland's (1985) concepts of differentiation, consistency, or vocational identity. It thus appears that experience with activities and perhaps motivation to learn contribute to the phenomenon of multipotentiality. Little evidence was found to support the contention reported in the giftedness literature that multipotentiality leads to career indecision. Additionally, few career-related experiences were found to differentiate between more or less "successful" multipotentialed subjects, although those who scored highest on the Vocational Identity Scale were more active in their career deciding (prioritizing and focusing interests) and less likely to view career planning as a frustrating and on-going process. Direction of causality for all of the mentioned results is unknown, and many avenues for future research including nongifted subjects have been illuminated.</description><creator>Rysiew, Kathy J.</creator><contributor>Shore, B.

This study investigated the effect of cycling position (upright vs. recumbent) and seat position on the oxygen cost of cycling. Experimental design. A two-factor ANOVA with repeated measures was used to examine the effect of cycling position (Monark 814E, Lifecycle 9100 R, and Lifecycle 9500 RHR ergometers) and seat position (optimum and +/-1 setting) on VO2 and HR. Participants. Subjects were 10 male physical education students (age = 24 +/- 2.1 years, height = 178.8 +/- 4.8 cm, weight = 76.2 +/- 7.8 kg). Interventions. Each subject was tested at three 5-minute workloads (55, 137, and 186 Watts) in a random order on the three ergometers. These workloads corresponded with manual settings of 1, 3, and 5 on the Lifecycle ergometers. The cycling protocols for the Lifecycle ergometers were performed with the seat set at 107% of the symphysis pubis measurement and at seat positions of +/-1 setting from the so-called "optimum" setting. Measures. Physiological response was assessed by continuously monitoring VO2 and HR. Results. At the optimum seat setting, the VO2 was significantly higher at the three workloads on the Monark compared to both Lifecycle ergometers. Seat positions of +/-1 setting from the recommended setting did not affect VO2. The HR response was non-significant for cycling position and seat position. Conclusions. The results indicate that the Lifecycle ergometers (9100 R and 9500 RHR) underestimate oxygen consumption and indirectly underestimate energy expenditure. Seat positions of +/-1 setting from the recommended setting on the Lifecycle ergometers did not affect the VO 2.</description><creator>Albert, Lee.</creator><contributor>Montgomery, David (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1997</date><subject>Cycling -- Physiological aspects.</subject><title>The oxygen cost of cycling : upright versus recumbent position</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ks65hd94t.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9k41zg26w</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Physical Education</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:rr171z91r</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:44:50Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This manuscript incorporates recent proposals for enhancing the learning of mathematics by developing authentic statistics instruction and assessment for eighth grade students based on a cognitive apprenticeship approach. The goal of instruction was for small groups to create statistics projects that addressed a meaningful research question. To ensure that criteria for assessing such performance were understood, groups were assigned to two treatments--library of exemplars and text--which differed in the degree to which criteria were explicit. The effectiveness of elaborating on criteria through examples (i.e., library) or text (i.e., text) for enhancing learning was examined. Both treatments demonstrated significant performance gains from pretest to posttest. However, students' understanding of representative sampling was significantly better as a result of receiving the library treatment than the text treatment. Making criteria more elaborate through examples of performance can thus enhance students' understanding of more abstract statistical concepts such as sampling.</description><creator>Lavigne, Nancy C.</creator><contributor>Lajoie, Susanne P.

The present study examined the coping strategies employed by family caregivers, their perception of burden, and the internal dialogues employed by caregivers to stressful events. Sixteen (13 females, 3 males) participants with an average age of 67.4 years were interviewed. Results indicate that caregivers who spend less hours per week caring for their care receiver perceived less overall burden and caregivers who subjectively felt that they were coping with their role tended to use more coping strategies. Caregivers' internal dialogues and comments concerning problems coping with Alzheimer's patients are included.</description><creator>Reisler, Steven E.
