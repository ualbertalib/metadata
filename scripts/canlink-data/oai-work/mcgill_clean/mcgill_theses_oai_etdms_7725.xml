The raw rubber formed by the coagulation of Hevea latex consists mainly of the hydrocarbon caoutchouc; and with the caoutchouc is associated protein and a somewhat variable amount of acetone soluble substances called collectively the resin. It may be stated on general grounds that a full knowledge of the chemical nature of rubber is essential to its most efficient utilization. There are considerable differences in the vulcanization properties of rubber prepared by different methods and there are, as with all natural products, variations in quality of similarily prepared specimens from season to season and from tree to tree.[...]</description><creator>Yorston, Frederic H.</creator><contributor>Simpson, G. &amp; Whitby, G.

S. Lock'ss definition - "Charity or love represents the principle of the good life, it stands for a mood or habit of mind and an endeavor". A closer definition, he says, would be "Good-will in the broadest sends towards the community and its members. Thus, in the word charity religious and social associations meet, and thus regarded the word means a disciplined and habitual mood in which the mind is considerate of the welfare of others individually and generally and desires what is for their real good. By the word "charity", as the term will be used in this thesis, we mean all those institutions and agencies which exist for the purpose of giving direct material aid to the poor and the distressed as such. It will be necessary in a limited treatment of so vast a subject to leave out of the discussion various relief organizations which, technicaily speaking,come under the general category of charities. We will not consider, for instance, purely educational institutions, because the aid given is not primarily material assistance.

In the past, many concrete specifications have been drawn up and have failed to state the proportions by definite weight or vol1une, but give the quantities simply in "parts." This kind of specification left much to the honesty of the contractor who could choose within certain limits, which would not be altogether too grotesque, what he would consider to be the weight of a cubic foot of cement. By this method of simply stating the quantities by parts an unscrupulous contractor can measure a oubio foot of cement very loosely packed andthus produce too lean a concrete.

Plato, in the second book of his 'Republic', showed that men are not self-sufficient, but that they attain full development only in an organized comnunity, in which individual effort affects other men. In succeeding chapters he develops his theory of an ideal state, the chief safe-guard of which is to be found in education. The  governors, he says, must be careful to preserve music and gymnastic from innovation, quoting Damon to the effect that a change in the songs of a country would soon result ln the alteration of its laws.
