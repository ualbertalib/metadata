Experiments involving two different PAM application rates (10 and 20  kg/ha) were conducted using natural rainfall in 2001 and 2002 and indoor rainfall  simulation. In 2001, PAM was combined with a broadcast application of grass  seed. The study results suggest that PAM provided no statistically  significant erosion control after natural rainfall on a loam soil. In the rainfall  simulation experiments PAM applied at both 10 and 20 kg/ha significantly reduced  soil erosion (by 75 and 77%) and the turbidity of runoff water (by 99%). PAM  application at 10 kg/ha significantly increased grass densities (by 109%) compared  with the control plots. However, PAM applied at 20 kg/ha provided no significant  increase in grass density compared with the control.</description><creator>Partington, Mark</creator><contributor>Mehuys, Guy (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2004</date><subject>Polyacrylamide.</subject><subject>Soil conservation.</subject><subject>Roads -- Embankments.</subject><subject>Forest roads.</subject><title>The effectiveness of polyacrylamide in providing short-term erosion control on steep slopes /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xp68kg95d.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bg257f73m</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Natural Resource Sciences</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:05741s36x</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:10:10Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>BLK has 43% sequence homology to BIK and an identical BH3  domain, a region that is critical for its proapoptotic activity, making it the  strongest candidate mouse ortholog. In addition, the gene structures of these two  proteins are similar in functional organization. BLK and BIK activate apoptosis in  similar fashion in both human and mouse cell lines, dependent on the presence of a  functional BH3 domain and active caspases. BLK, like BIK, is very unstable and can  be stabilized by addition of pan caspase inhibitor, zVAD-fmk. In contrast to BIK,  BLK is not upregulated by p53 at the RNA or protein level in several mouse cell line  systems. Furthermore, BLK localizes to the mitochondria, not to the endoplasmic  reticulum where BIK resides. To further investigate the localization of BLK and BIK,  the transmembrane domains of these proteins were swapped. BLKBIK and BIKBLK both  localized to the endoplasmic reticulum. Enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein fused to  the transmembrane domains of BLK and BIK also localized to the endoplasmic  reticulum. The mitochondrial localization of BLK despite its transmembrane domain  preference for the endoplasmic reticulum suggests that the N-terminal portion of BLK  plays a role in targeting. Collectively, these results argue that BLK is not the  functional mouse homolog of BIK.</description><creator>Pai, Samar Vikram</creator><contributor>Shore, Gordon C.

We aimed to assess the utility of VEMP testing in the  differential diagnosis of dizziness (81 dizzy patients, 12 normals). We found that:  (1) VEMP was reliably elicited from all controls and from 96% of patients without  loss of vestibular function; (2) in patients with documented unilateral peripheral  vestibular disorders, VEMP could reveal loss of otolith function that usefully  facilitated diagnoses; and (3) such otolith function loss was independent of canal  function loss revealed by caloric testing. We conclude that the VEMP-test is  clinically useful to assess vestibular (otolith and/or inferior vestibular nerve)  function, providing information complementary to that obtained from caloric testing  (horizontal semicircular canal and/or superior vestibular nerve  function).</description><creator>Ostrovska, Alexsandra</creator><contributor>Katsarkas, A.

We developed a method for formulating cases with  respect to attachment, and delineating specific, attachment-related interventions.  The baseline treatment phase consisted of standard CBT and the intervention phase  featured the addition of attachment-related interventions. Clinically significant  change was assessed using Jacobson's method, and times series data was analyzed  using overfitted ARIMA modeling. Both participants improved symptomatically with standard CBT.  Attachment-related interventions did not add to efficacy of symptom reduction, but  did facilitate cognitive change, especially core beliefs about vulnerability, and  reduced daily levels of anxiety in both participants. For resistant individuals with  OCD, the targeting of attachment-related thoughts, behaviour and feelings in therapy  may facilitate change---a finding consistent with hypothetical links between  attachment insecurity, core views about one's vulnerability and predisposition to  anxiety.</description><creator>Myhr, Gail</creator><contributor>Sookman, Debbie (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2004</date><subject>Psychology, Clinical.</subject><title>Targeting attachment in the cognitive behavioural therapy of obsessive compulsive disorder : using single case time series experiments to assess efficacy</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bn999728h.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qz20st16p</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Psychiatry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:70795829p</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:10:11Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Background. In genetic epidemiology, there is some debate over  whether linkage analysis should be performed with highly parametric Genetic-Model  Based (GMB) methods or relatively genetic-model-free Allele-Sharing Based (ASB)  methods in complex diseases. Asthma is one such complex disease with multiple  determinants including putative genetic factors on regions of chromosome 12. This  thesis compares the evidence from a range of GMB models to an ASB analysis for  linkage between asthma and chromosome 12. Methods. Data from an asthma cohort of Saguenay Lac St-Jean  families was reanalysed using both GMB and ASB models. The range of GMB models was  constrained by epidemiologic estimates of asthma prevalence. The results from the  GMB analyses were compared with the results of an ASB method. The specific GMB and  ASB methods used were LOD-score with liability classes and 'Non parametric linkage'  (NPL), respectively. The analyses were performed using multipoint techniques in  Genehunter software.</description><creator>Murphy, Tanya J.</creator><contributor>Joseph, Lawrence (Supervisor)</contributor><contributor>Greenwood, Celia (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2004</date><subject>Health Sciences, Public Health.</subject><subject>Biology, Genetics.</subject><subject>Biology, Molecular.</subject><title>The risks and benefits of genetic-model based linkage analysis in the detection of asthma susceptibility regions on chromosome 12 /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dr26xx847.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/70795829p</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:4t64gn85m</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:10:11Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Plant sterols (PS) are effective in reducing plasma lipid  concentrations, however, few studies have examined their cholesterol lowering  effects in type 2 diabetics. The objective was to assess whether PS consumption  alters blood lipid profile in hypercholesterolemic subjects with and without type 2  diabetes. Fifteen control subjects (age = 55.1 +/- 8.5 yr and BMI = 26.9 +/-  3.0kg/m2) and fourteen diabetic subjects (age = 54.5 +/- 6.7 yr and BMI = 30.2 +/-  3.0kg/m2) participated in a double-blinded, randomized, crossover,  placebo-controlled feeding trial. The Western diet included either 1.8g/d of PS or  cornstarch placebo each provided over 21 d separated by a 28 d washout period.  Subjects consumed only foods prepared in Mary Emily Clinical Nutrition Research Unit  of McGill University. Total cholesterol (TC) decreased (p &lt; 0.05) from  baseline with PS for control and diabetic subjects by 9.7% and 13.6%, respectively.  TC decreased (P &lt; 0.05) from baseline with placebo for control and diabetic  subjects by 10.9% and 11.6%, respectively. Non high density lipoprotein cholesterol  (non-HDL-C) decreased (p &lt; 0.05) from baseline with PS for diabetic subjects  by 18.5%. Low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels were reduced (p  &lt; 0.05) from baseline with PS for control and diabetic subjects by 14.9% and  29.8%, respectively. The reduction of LDL-C due to PS alone is greater with type 2  diabetics. There were no significant changes in HDL-C and TG across diets or  treatments. It is thus concluded that PS consumption with diet enhances non-HDL-C  and LDL-C reduction compared with diet alone in hypercholesterolemic individuals  with and without type 2 diabetes. Demonstration for the first time that PS alone are  more efficacious in lowering LDL-C and non-HDL-C in diabetic individuals compared to  non-diabetics confirm the beneficial effects of PS to help prevent cardiovascular  disease (CVD) for this high risk population.</description><creator>Lau, Vivian Wai Yan, 1977-</creator><contributor>Jones, Peter J.

TRBP also binds the interferon induced,  double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase, PKR, that exerts antiviral activities.  Activated PKR inhibits translational initiation by phosphorylation of the alpha  subunit of the eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIf-2alpha). TRBP blocks the  inhibitory effects of PKR, whereas PKR activating protein (PACT), another cellular  protein, heterodimerizes with and activates PKR in vitro and in vivo in the absence  of viral infection. TRBP and PACT are highly homologous but have opposite effects on  PKR. We studied the interplay between TRBP and PACT on PKR activation  and on the regulation of HIV expression. By the yeast two-hybrid method, we showed  an interaction between TRBP and PACT and we characterized domains implicated in this  interaction. We confirmed this interaction in the human cellular context by  coimmunoprecipitation. Immunofluorescence studies showed that TRBP and PACT  colocalize in the cytoplasm. In the context of HIV-1 expression, PKR mediates an  inhibition of LTR (long terminal repeat) expression, but no further decrease was  obtained with PACT. Interestingly, in coimmunoprecipitation studies, we found that  the concentration of PACT protein is decreased when PACT and TRBP were  cotransfected, whereas PACT mRNA level remains unchanged. This result suggests that  TRBP either blocks PACT translation or induces its degradation, which open new ways  of PKR and viral regulation.</description><creator>Laraki, Ghislaine</creator><contributor>Gatignol, Anne (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2004</date><subject>Biology, Molecular.</subject><title>TRBP-PACT interaction in the regulation of HIV expression and PKR activation</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3n203z725.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vt150j823</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Microbiology and Immunology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:3x816n12p</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:10:12Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Amyloidosis describes a heterogenous collection of systemic  diseases characterized by the extracellular deposition of proteinaceous amyloid  fibrils derived from normally soluble proteins. With progressive tissue deposition  of amyloid, death can occur through failure of the affected organ(s). However, the  mechanism of amyloid fibril formation remains obscure. To understand this mechanism,  a parasite (alveolar hydatid cyst, AHC)-mouse model of inflammation-associated AA  amyloidosis, was used. AHC is a potent inducer of chronic inflammation, serum  amyloid A (SAA) synthesis and AA amyloidosis. It has been proposed that reactive  oxygen radicals (ROR) generated by inflammatory macrophages (mphi) and  reticuloendothelial (RE) cells, which are also intimately involved in SAA clearance,  could initiate intra-lysosomal AA fibril formation. ROS generated intracellularly  could oxidize SAA fragments or other key cellular proteins, alter them structurally  and thus render them resistant to enzymatic degradation and prone to intralysosomal  nascent AA fibril formation. The objective of this research was to identify oxidative stress  (OS) markers (heme-oxygenase-1, HO-1; 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal, HNE; Nepsilon  -(Carboxymethyl)lysine, CML) in peritoneal mphi and splenic/hepatic RE cells  obtained from AHC-infected mice prior to and during AA amyloidosis. Histochemical  and peroxidase-immunoperoxidase methods were used to detect the OS markers. High  levels of HO-1, an antioxidant enzyme; HNE, a product of lipid peroxidation; and  CML, an advanced glycation end product, were found in peritoneal mphi and  splenic/hepatic RE cells proximal to AA fibril deposition. HNE and CML deposits were  found in both the tissue interstitium and bound to AA amyloid deposits, indicating  their possible role in the oxidative alteration of intracellular SAA. OS mediated  changes in mphi/RE cells loaded with SAA may prove to be a prelude to nascent  intracellular AA fibril formation.</description><creator>Kamalvand, Golnar</creator><contributor>Ali-Khan, Zafer (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2003</date><subject>Biology, Cell.</subject><title>Evidence of oxidative stress response in a mouse model of AA amyloidosis : immunolocalization of specific markers</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mw22v6020.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3x816n12p</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Microbiology and Immunology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:9w0323659</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:10:12Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The principal dose-limiting toxicity of most chemotherapeutic  agents is myelosuppression. In this study we evaluated the chemoprotection conferred  against alkylators by a bicistronic retroviral vector expressing the chemoresistance  genes GSTA3 and DHFRL22Y. As reported herein, GID-transduced murine hematopoietic  cells exhibited greater survival compared to control cells in presence of  chlorambucil concentrations ranging from 5 x 10-6 M to 1 x 10-4M. After increasing  the fraction of GID-expressing cells via chemoselection with TMTX and NBMPR, the  level of resistance was increased by up to 2.9-fold at 5 x 10-5 M chlorambucil.  GID-transduced hematopoietic cell enrichment by ex vivo chemoselection was limited,  under our experimental conditions, by a marked loss of hematopoietic reconstitution  ability, while in vivo chemoselection was shown to hold greater potential to  selectively enrich GID-expressing blood cells. The presence of replication competent  virus in the experiments makes it difficult to reach to conclusive interpretations  of results. Notwithstanding the unfortunate outcome of murine leukemia that did not  allow for the evaluation of GID-mediated hematopoietic chemoprotection in vivo, the  promising in vitro experimental results reported here warrant further investigation  of this approach.</description><creator>Karatzas, Antonios</creator><contributor>Cournoyer, Denis (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2003</date><subject>Biology, Genetics.</subject><subject>Health Sciences, Pharmacology.</subject><title>Evaluation of chemoprotection conferred against alkylating drugs by a bicistronic retroviral vector expressing the A3 isoform of glutathione S-transferase and a variant of human dihydrofolate reductase</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6m311p92x.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9w0323659</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Human Genetics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:h415p999j</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:10:13Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Fifteen skin-grafted burn survivors with a normal skin site on  the opposite side of the body were quantitatively tested for sensations of touch,  cold, warmth, and heat-pain.

Simulation is usually used for verification in the design process, which  tends to be a bottleneck. Distributed simulation on a network of workstations tries  to provide a cost-effective solution. The partitioning of the circuit is a critical  factor to the performance of the distributed simulation. This study presents the design and implementation of a  partitioning framework which is incorporated into the DVS (Distribute Verilog  Simulator) framework. A number of well-known partitioning algorithms are implemented  including a new algorithm CAKE. The classical FM and popular CLIP algorithms and  their recursive bisection version are implemented. The partitioning results are  studied for large circuits in ISPD98 benchmark suite. The effect of partitioning  results on the performance of the distributed simulation is analyzed with a  multiplier circuit in ISCAS85.</description><creator>Huang, Hai, 1974-</creator><contributor>Tropper, Carl (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2003</date><subject>Computer Science.</subject><title>A partitioning framework for distributed verilog simulation /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/x059c809q.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/j3860759j</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:08612p19h</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:10:13Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Remediation of phonological awareness (PA) deficits in preschool  age children is essential to the prevention of delayed acquisition of reading  abilities. The purpose of this research was to develop and assess the efficacy of a  program to teach PA to preschool-aged children with delayed PA. Ten preschoolers  with articulation disorders participated in 8 training sessions focusing on  phonological awareness (PA) and phonemic perception. These children made significant  improvements in their PA abilities such that their post-treatment PA test  performance was not significantly poorer than that of normally developing children,  but was significantly better than that of children with an articulation disorder who  did not receive the PA training program.

The interaction of Hes1 with  Gro/TLE is mediated by a WRPW tetrapeptide present at the carboxy-terminus of all  Hes proteins. Another lies protein, Hes6, also interacts with Gro/TLE through its  WRPW motif. Contrary to Hes1, Hes6 promotes neuronal differentiation. It is shown  here that Hes6 negatively regulates Hes1 activity by at least two mechanisms. Hes6  promotes a proteolytic degradation of Hes1. Moreover, Hes6 inhibits the interaction  of Hes1 with its transcriptional corepressor, Gro/TLE. Hes6 inhibits Hes1-mediated  transcriptional repression in cortical neural progenitor cells. Consistent with  these observations, Hes6 promotes the differentiation of cortical neurons, a process  normally inhibited by Hes1. Taken together, these results clarify molecular  mechanisms underlying the neurogenic activity of Hes6.</description><creator>Gratton, Michel-Olivier</creator><contributor>Stifani, Stefano (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2004</date><subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</subject><title>Mechanisms of hairyenhancer of split 6 function during mammalian neuronal development</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kd17ct53c.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/q524jp274</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:bg257f76f</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:10:14Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The purpose of this study was to determine among surgically  treated non-metastatic breast cancer patients in the province of Quebec the  distribution of the time between surgery and post-operative radiation therapy (RT)  as well as secular trends and other factors influencing waiting time. Using  administrative records, I identified between 1992 and 1998 29,105 episodes of breast  cancer and 17,704 of these contained an indication of receiving RT Hierarchical  linear regression models were used to identify predictors of waiting  time. The number of cases of breast cancer increased by 5.5% per year  while the number of those receiving RT increased by 9%. Median post-surgery waiting  time was 75 days in 1992 and by 1998 it had increased by 63% (95% Confidence  Interval (CI) 35%--97%) among patients not requiring chemotherapy. In patients  receiving chemotherapy, post-chemotherapy waiting time increased from 21 to 30 days  (35% increase between 1998 and 1992 (95% CI -3%--88%)). In addition to a significant  variability of waiting time according to radiation therapy centre, predictors of  shorter waiting times were earlier year of treatment, localised cancer stage, breast  conserving surgery, early consultation with a radiation oncologist, being operated  in a centre with a radiation therapy facility, living close to a radiation therapy  facility, and living in a higher socio-economic area. In conclusion, waiting time to start of radiation therapy after  localised breast cancer increased substantially in Quebec from 1992 to 1998.  Possible explanations include increased demand, insufficient resources and changes  in the indications for breast conserving surgery and RT.</description><creator>Fortin, Bernard, 1970-</creator><contributor>Goldberg, Mark (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2003</date><subject>Health Sciences, Public Health.</subject><subject>Health Sciences, Oncology.</subject><title>Waiting time for radiation therapy in non-metastatic, surgically-treated breast cancer patients in Quebec</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/th83kz96n.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bg257f76f</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:9g54xj24w</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:10:14Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>We have isolated a novel source of stem cells derived from the dermis of either rodent or human skin. When induced to differentiate in vitro, these cells give rise to all types of neuronal lineages. In this study, we therefore investigated if naive S̲ḵin-derived P̲recursor (SKPs) cells could be neuralized by the neonatal brain  environment thereby generating neural cells in vivo. We transplanted orange cell  tracker-labelled mouse SKPs into the lateral cerebral ventricule and the hippocampus  of neonatal rats. Analysis of the transplants revealed that SKPs survived over the  short, medium and long-term in vivo, with SKPs remaining viable for up to 6 weeks  without forming tumors. Many cells also adopted a branched morphology, but, based on  immunocytochemistry of orange cell tracker-labelled SKPs with specific markers for  either neurons or glia, these morphologically complex cells did not differentiate  into specific neuronal cell types. In control experiments, neural stem cells  exhibited a similar in vivo pattern of survival and a lack of differentiation,  thereby validating our results and that our transplantation protocol required  further refinement in order to give optimal results. In conclusion, we have shown  that SKPs can survive in vivo and do not appear to form neural  lineages.</description><creator>Fortier, Mathieu</creator><contributor>Miller, Freda (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2003</date><subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</subject><title>Transplantation of skin-derived precursor cells into neonatal rat brain</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6d56zx101.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9g54xj24w</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Neuroscience</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:h128nf324</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:10:15Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Objective. To evaluate the caries experience of people with Down  syndrome (DS) compared to people without DS. Methods. A cross-sectional study was  conducted. The caries experience was assessed by a crude DMFT score and an adjusted  DFT score expressed as a percentage of caries-affected teeth to compensate for  hypodontia in the DS group. Multiple logistic and linear regressions were used to  compare the outcomes of both groups, controlling for all predictors. Results. Of the  44 DS and 84 non-DS subjects, the adjusted DFT score showed non-significant  differences between them (p = 0.18). The crude DMFT score displayed borderline  significance (p = 0.06), while people without DS had a higher likelihood of a caries  experience compared to the DS group (OR, 4.6; 95% CI, 1.5--14.0). Conclusions .  Independent of other predictors, the caries experience was greater among people  without DS, without adjusting for the number of teeth. However when this factor is  considered, the caries experience is the same among both groups.</description><creator>Fung, Karen</creator><contributor>Allison, Paul J.

Some  recent reports have shown that there are physiological effects on host and non-host  rhizobia after LCO treatment. However, the cellular mechanisms underlying these  observations are not known. Therefore, the study was aimed at assessing phenotypic  changes by measuring photosynthesis, leaf area and dry weight on a non-host plant  (tobacco). Our results did not show any significant physiological changes following  LCO treatment. We also wanted to explore the molecular basis of changes in the plant  cell by looking at gene and protein profiling following LCO treatment in a natural  host plant (soybean) using real-time RT-PCR and SDS-PAGE. To do so, a reproducible  stimulation method for soybean seed germination by LCO was successfully developed.  The results obtained on soybean did not reveal significant differences in gene  expression between water and LCO-treated seeds for the genes cdc2, WASI, ICL1 and  14-3-3 studied. In addition, LCO treatment did not change the protein profile  compared to the water control in a significant way.</description><creator>Cotton, Sophie</creator><contributor>Fortin, Marc (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2003</date><subject>Germination.</subject><subject>Soybean -- Molecular aspects.</subject><subject>Oligosaccharides.</subject><subject>Tobacco -- Molecular aspects.</subject><title>Molecular events in Nicotiana tabacum and Glycine max following lipochitooligosaccharide treatment</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/z316q205h.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/k3569517w</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Plant Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:2514nm06q</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:10:16Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Using a model system of glycosylated and aglycon standards  consisting of rutin and quercetin respectively, and a series of pre-packed solid  phase extraction cartridges, including C18 Extra-Clean, DSC-18, DPA-6S, Oasis HLB  and Amberlite XAD-2.

Such regions are  naturally represented with a trace-cache, a collection of long, frequently-executed  sequences of instructions. An ideal trace-cache is small and captures the majority  of the program's execution stream, yet consists of traces large enough to allow for  useful inter-bytecode optimizations and improve instruction-fetch performance. This  thesis describes an efficient dynamic technique for finding and constructing such  traces. Our trace caching algorithm relies on three innovative  techniques: profiling data is managed with the Branch Implication Graph(BI-Graph)  data structure, decomposing the program into small, independent, tree-like  components using our hot subgraph filters the BI-Graph for relevant data, and traces  are constructed from components using a minimum-bounded expected completion  rate. We evaluated the runtime performance of our generated traces  using a trace cache simulator implemented on top of the Java Virtual Machine,  SableVM. Tested against Java benchmarks, our primary data structure, the BI-Graph,  scales linearly with the loaded program size and is no larger than a control flow  graph. On our benchmarks set, our traces capture 98.5% of the executed instructions,  average 34 bytecodes instructions in length, and execute to completion 98.5% of the  time. Further, the total size of all traces created scales linearly at 83% of the  program's size, averaging only 50000 bytecodes. The entire algorithm, including  context-sensitive, branch bias profiling and trace creation, has a projected  overhead of only 4.5%. Thus, our algorithm efficiently constructs a small trace  cache consisting of long traces that both tend to execute to completion and capture  the majority of the execution stream.</description><creator>Berndl, Marc</creator><contributor>Hendren, Laurie (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2003</date><subject>Computer Science.</subject><title>Dynamic profiling and trace creation</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/d791sg93t.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0r967432k</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:gx41mj67p</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:10:16Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Evaluating the integration of multiple land uses in protected  areas by assessing user satisfaction assists in identifying the balance between  ecological protection and the socio-economic and cultural needs of local  populations.

Many countries require that all existing  dams need to be inspected and evaluated regularly. Monitoring instruments have long  been an integral part of the dam safety process by providing information for  detailed analyses as well as for monitoring the current condition of dams. In this  thesis, statistical models are used to infer behavior characteristics of a multiple  arch dam. First, a statistical model known as the Hydrostatic-Season-Time (H-S-T)  model is fitted to each individual displacement component from pendulum data for the  Daniel Johnson Dam, a multiple arch concrete dam located in Northern Quebec.  Principal component analysis (PCA) was used with the data from pendulums. A modified  PCA analysis was also performed after removing thermal effects. A C++ language  program (DASOD) was developed for the estimation of the H-S-T model, visualization  of results, and data preparation for the principal component analysis.

Another specimen was reinforced with  diagonal reinforcing bars in addition to the horizontal reinforcing bars and hoops.  The diagonal reinforcing bars were not locally confined by closely spaced hoops to  see if there would be adequate confinement and anti-buckling resistance. Both the  specimens had an identical span-to-depth ratio of 3.0. The testing results showed  that the diagonally reinforced coupling beam had better performance than the  conventionally reinforced coupling beam when subjected to reversed cyclic loading.

Several methods of automatic seizure detection exist, but few can operate as an on-line seizure alert system. Proposed is a seizure detection system that can be used in real-time to alert medical staff to the onset of a patient seizure and hence improve clinical diagnosis. Proposed is a system based on the seizure probability of a section of EEG. Final operation features a user-tuneable threshold to exploit the trade-off between sensitivity and detection delay and an acceptable false detection rate. The system was designed using 307 hours of scalp EEG including a total of 56 seizures in 13 patients. Wavelet decomposition, feature extraction and data segmentation were employed to compute the a priori probabilities required for the Bayesian formulation used in training, testing and operation. Results based on the analysis of separate testing data (354 hours of scalp EEG including 74 seizures in 15 patients) show an average sensitivity of 70.5% and a false detection rate of 0.25/hr. This average sensitivity is based on the successful detection of 47 of the 74 seizures with a mean detection delay of 10.8s and a delay of 10 seconds or less in 31 of these (66% of detections). The system is considered to be preliminary and results are promising enough to encourage further work on probability-based seizure detection. The tuning mechanism was also seen to add value to the use of the system.</description><creator>Saab, Marc Emile</creator><contributor>Gotman, Jean (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2003</date><subject>Engineering, Biomedical.</subject><title>A system to detect the onset of epileptic seizures</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sf268574x.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/tt44pn52k</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biomedical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:mg74qm60n</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:10:18Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis presents several design experiments for  high-performance power-efficient asynchronous circuits. In Chapter two we present a new asynchronous pipeline logic  family with improved latency and throughput compared to several other asynchronous  pipeline circuits. The channels between pipeline stages use data encoding and a  small set of minimum-delay timing constraints that permit modular design with few  dependencies on technology and layout. We develop circuit blocks that implement  linear pipelines as well as forking, joining and data-dependent decisions. An  implementation in 0.18mum CMOS exhibits a latency of 56ps per pipeline stage and  throughput of 4.8-giga data item per second (GDI/s) in Hspice  simulation. We also present the design of a low-control-overhead  asynchronous microprocessor integrated with a high-speed sampling FIFO. This is an  experiment in exploring the benefits of asynchronous design in high-speed embedded  DSP applications.

In terms of flexural members, e.g., a steel  I-section beam, bent about the major principal axis, lateral buckling about the  minor principal axis in combination with torsional buckling is the main stability  concern. To prevent lateral-torsional buckling from occurring, lateral braces are  typically installed perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the flexural member,  either on the top and/or bottom flange or near the shear-centre of the beam.  Nethercot developed an equation to predict the critical elastic lateral-torsional  moment resistance of cantilever beams, which involves a series of effective length  factors, which are dependent on the brace configuration, type and position of  loading, as well as cantilever system. This effective length factor approach has  become widely used as a simplified method to calculate the elastic lateral-torsional  buckling moment resistance of cantilever steel beams. However, no specific  guidelines for the design of the lateral braces are available in design  standards. This thesis will include background information on elastic beam  buckling theories, an introduction to the development of research on lateral brace  requirements, and a discussion on the currently used lateral bracing requirements in  North American and British Standards. Details of a study concerning the lateral  bracing design requirements for cantilever I-beams, carried out with the use of the  finite element software Buckling Analysis of Stiffened Plates (BASP), are provided.  Concerning the required brace stiffness, the results from the numerical parametric  study are compared with the results from the Canadian Steel Design Standard CSA-S 16  and the SSRC (Structural Stability Research Council) method of the United  States. It is shown that the current code methods are generally  conservative for top flange loaded cantilever beam cases in terms of the predicted  elastic lateral-torsional buckling capacity. Furthermore, the current bracing design  requirements provide adequate results in most cases, except for the prop cantilever  scenario without a tip brace.</description><creator>Liu, Sheng, 1970-</creator><contributor>Rogers, Colin A.
