With this technique we studied the effects of polymers on the impingement of colloidal particles onto flat surfaces. In the deposition-detachment studies of bare latex particles, anomalous deposition rates and surface motions were observed. These types of behavior can be qualitatively explained by surface protrusions on the latex surface. Bare particles were dislodged from the surface by hydrodynamic forces exerted on them and by surface collisions between freely suspended and deposited particles. By coating the particles with neutral polymer, we found a decrease in the deposition rate but an increase in adhesion. The presence of free polymer in the jet increases the probability of escape. The detachment rate can be explained by an exchange between polymer segments bridging the particles to the surface and those freely dissolved in the jet. The presence of cationic polyelectrolyte promotes deposition and prevents the release of the particles.</description><creator>Varennes, Suzanne</creator><date>1987</date><subject>Colloids</subject><subject>Polymers -- Viscosity.</subject><title>Effects of polymers on the impingement of colloidal particles onto flat surfaces</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tt44pn608.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/k643b1984</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Chemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:2f75r8608</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:54:58Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This dissertation presents the first critical edition of the Aramaic Targum (translation) of the Biblical Book of Psalms, chapters 1-72.

For this purpose, a restart homotopy continuation method algorithm is developed, which contains in essence two phases. The pertinent steps of the first phase are as follows: (1) Create a sub-problem of the complete optimal power flow problem by relaxing boundary limits on all functional variables, namely voltages at load buses, line flows and reactive generations. (2) Parameterize a subset of the whole set of controls which comprises initially of tap-changers, phase-shifters, shunt controllers, and the voltages at generation buses. (3) Optimize the resulting problem. The solution in step (3) is used as an initial starting point in a continuation process, designed to track this solution to the optimal solution of the sub-problem defined in step (1). The tracking is accomplished via a predictor-corrector path following algorithm embodying certain special features, such that the solution accuracy can be improved to any desired degree through a flexible restart feature developed in this study. Within the tracking process only a subset (identified in step 2 above) of the whole set of controls require specific monitoring for break-points. This feature greatly reduces the computational burden. Termination of the first phase marks an operating point in which all controls are strictly feasible. If, following the termination of the first phase, functional variables previously ignored prove to be within their respective bounds, the solution to the sub-problem becomes the solution to the complete optimal power flow problem. However, should functional variables violate their bounds the second phase of the algorithm is invoked, which in essence creates a new sub-problem by changing the roles of the control and violated dependent variables, such that the newly modified sub-problem maintains the same basic structure as its predecessor. Phase I is invoked again at this juncture to solve the modified sub-problem. This process is repeated in cycles until the Kuhn-Tucker optimality conditions are satisfied. Simulations suggest that convergence is usually achieved within two or three Phase I/II cycles. This being a method unique to the minimum cost optimal power flow problem, numerous examples (up to 118 buses) have been tested and compared against the commercial code MINOS. The newly proposed algorithm appears to be faster and more reliable.</description><creator>Ponrajah, Ranendra Anthony</creator><date>1987</date><subject>Electric power systems -- Load dispatching</subject><title>The minimum cost optimal power flow problem solved via the restart homotopy continuation method /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vd66w0602.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3197xm462</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:3b591916g</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:54:58Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>A novel S1 nuclease mapping method was devised to measure the efficiency and sites of transcription termination in vivo by RNA polymerase II on polyomavirus DNA. To determine termination efficiency, pulse-labeled nuclear RNA was hybridized with a DNA fragment which spans the transcription initiation region. Since polyomavirus DNA is circular, any RNA polymerases which do not terminate transcription will traverse the entire genome and pass through the initiation region again. Hybrids were treated with ribonuclease, bound to nitrocellullose filters, eluted from the filters by degrading single-stranded DNA with S1 nuclease, and analyzed by gel electrophoresis. The results show that about 70% of polymerases terminate transcription per genome traverse at 16 hours post infection; only 50% terminate at 28 hours. At 16 hours, the major transcription initiation site on the L DNA strand is at nucleotide 5050; but at 28 hours, the major initiation site is shifted upstream to nucleotide 5128. RNA polymerase terminates and/or pauses at many discrete sites which lie mostly downstream of the polyadenylation site. Some pausing and/or termination sites are also observed upstream of the polyadenylation site and are probably created by polymerases that traverse the genome more than once. Our experiments also show that the 3$ sp prime$ end at nucleotide 1230 found by Triesman and Kamen (1981) in steady state nuclear RNA is created by a post-transcriptional RNA processsing event and not by termination of transcription.</description><creator>Tseng, Richard Wen-chang</creator><date>1987</date><subject>Biology, Molecular.</subject><title>Analysis of termination and pausing in vivo by RNA polymerase II on polyomavirus DNA</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dj52w5501.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3b591916g</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Microbiology and Immunology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:m613mz216</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:54:59Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The title compounds were synthesized from methyl 3-aryl(alkyl)thio crotonic acids by deprotonation followed by silylation. The reactions of dienes with a number of carbonyl electrophiles under Lewis-acid catalysed conditions were investigated. The dienes exclusively give $ gamma$-alkylated products. The thio substituent enhances the $ gamma$-selectivity. The reactions of dienes with a number of 1,3-dicarbonyl equivalents have been studied and a cycloaromatization reaction has been developed for the regiocontrolled synthesis of aryl sulfides in a 3C + 3C combination. The role of dienes in Diels-Alder reactions has also been investigated. A new 4C + 2C annulation reaction has been developed based on the propensity of dienes to undergo Michael reaction with $ alpha$,$ beta$-unsaturated ketones under Lewis-acid catalysed conditions. These Michael adducts in turn were cyclized either with potassium tert-butoxide or with lithium thiophenoxide. Further, the tandem Michael-Claisen annulation reaction can be controlled to give either cis- or trans-fused 9-methyldecalin system with three carbonyl groups which are differently masked.

Generally, this occurs through the penetration of the contaminant into the liner material. This study assesses the efficiency of natural clay barriers as an expedient economic lining material. Various chemical constituents of the landfill leachate of an actual waste containment site at Lachenaie (35 km east of Montreal) were determined from samples collected from specially designed basins. In companion laboratory tests, these leachate samples were permeated through laboratory columns that contained the natural clay compacted at the optimum water content. The columns were constructed so as to permit simulation of slow, saturated, anaerobic flow of leachate through the clay lining surrounding the landfill and leachate basins. Leachates were permeated through the soil columns for periods of four to five months, during which effluents were collected periodically and analyzed for different chemical species and physical parameters. These chemical analyses measured changes in the concentration of: (a) cations (Na, K, Ca, and Mg), (b) anions (Cl, HCO$ sb3$, and CO$ sb3$), (c) total organic carbon (TOC), and (d) heavy metals (Fe, Zn, Pb, and Cu). The physical parameters measured included: (a) pH, and (b) specific conductivity. Subsequent to the leaching tests, the column contents were cut into six sections and analyzed to determine the distribution profiles of the adsorbed and retained contaminants at various time durations. Predictions, using a dispersion-convection model for concentration profile development for either adsorbed or retained contaminants, were compared with the experimentally determined profiles (both in leaching columns and landfill laboratory model). Another set of experiments was also conducted to evaluate the effect of some organic fluids on the geotechnical properties of different clay soils (natural clay and two reference clay soils: illite and kaolinite). The results from this study have demonstrated that the natural clay soil can be used to adequately contain the different contaminant species usually present in the leachate solutions. Furthermore, the data suggested that under favourable soil conditions, landfill leachates containing low levels of trace metals will not pose a substantial contamination threat to the subsurface environment, provided that a proper thickness of barrier is used.

This facultative intracellular bacterium causes in mice an acute infection which lasts for approximately 12 days. Resistance to infection is associated with the appearance in the spleens of cells with the ability to transfer anti-tularemic resistance to naive mice, a response which is maximal 7 days following infection. Depletion of B cells does not compromise the ability of immune cells to transfer resistance. Treatment of mice with immune serum prior to infection leads to an increased hepatic and decreased splenic growth of Francisella. This effect is attributable to a serum-induced shift in the organ uptake of Francisella from the spleen to the liver. Acquired anti-tularemic resistance is critically dependent upon T lymphocytes, as evidenced by the inability of T lymphocyte-depleted immune cells to transfer resistance, and by the increased susceptibility to infection in mice treated with the T cell immunosuppressant, cyclosporin A. The passive transfer of resistance is mediated mainly by T cells bearing the L3T4 marker, but Lyt 2$ sp{+}$ cells may also play a minor role. Macrophages are essential to the control of Francisella infection, since inhibition of the functional activity of this cell population by silica injection leads to a decrease in the ability of mice to contain bacterial growth. The interactions between T cells and macrophages leading to the expression of anti-tularemic immunity are restricted by the product of the I-A region of the H-2 complex. Resistance to tularemia is influenced by the genetic background of the host. Among inbred mouse strains, several levels of resistance to infection are evident. Genetic analysis of resistance/susceptibility to tularemia in F$ sb1$ and F$ sb2$ hybrid mice, and in recombinant inbred strains of mice derived from resistant and susceptible progenitor strains, indicated that the inheritance pat</description><creator>Anthony, L.

Social work support and counselling aims to reduce this secondary morbidity, and is a common form of hospital-based psychosocial service. The first randomized controlled trial of this type of intervention was carried out to evaluate its effectiveness in treating and preventing maladjustment. This thesis describes how child behavior outcomes were assessed before and 4 months after a 6 month period of social worker assistance in 173 children randomized to intervention, and in 169 controls, all with chronic illnesses. No significant difference between intervention and control groups in the overall prevalence of maladjustment was found. There was no evidence to support a therapeutic or preventive effect of social work counselling on child behavior outcomes, nor was there improvement in child perceived competence. A search for treatment interactions failed to reveal any sub-group that benefitted from the intervention, and restriction of the analysis to individuals who actually received the intervention does not alter any of these conclusions. Measurement problems, co-intervention, or other forms of bias cannot account for the negative results. It is speculated that if social work support is to be effective, it should be targetted, potent, of adequate duration, and possibly integrated within specialist clinic services.</description><creator>Nolan, Terence.</creator><date>1986</date><subject>Health Sciences, Public Health.</subject><title>Clinical trial of social worker assistance in childhood chronic illness</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1c18dg40x.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0c483j98g</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:dr26xz037</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:55:01Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The relationship between various immune functions, tissue damage, and splenomegaly was investigated during the course of Graft-versus-host (GVH) reactions. The GVH-associated tissue lesions appeared at the time when both the T- and B-cell functions were severely suppressed and NK cell activity was at its peak and/or highly augmented. The development of tissue lesions correlated with donor NK cell activity. On the other hand, splenomegaly developed independently of both the NK cell activity as well as tissue lesions. Prolonged immunosuppression was associated with thymic dysplasia, but not splenomegaly. The immune functions recovered gradually, following severe suppression, and coincided with the gradual recovery of the thymus. The immune functional recovery was observed in the following order: LPS responsive B-cell functions; ConA responsive T-cell functions; PHA responsive T-cell functions; and finally T-cell dependent B-cell responses. T-cell functions of immunodeficient GVH mice could be restored only when the thymic medullary regeneration had occurred. In contrast, the restoration of NK cell activity of NK-depressed mice was independent of thymic dysplasia. These studies provide information regarding the possible mechanisms involved in inducing immunosuppression, tissue damage, and splenomegaly following GVH induction.</description><creator>Ghayur, Tariq.</creator><date>1986</date><subject>Health Sciences, Immunology.</subject><title>An investigation into the immune functional, morphological, and histopathological alterations during the course of graft-versus-host reactions /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1j92g8240.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dr26xz037</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Physiology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:s4655h33w</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:55:01Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In this thesis, passive and active 3-branch Ti:LiNbO$ sb3$ waveguide devices were investigated. A multimode field-matching technique was employed to predict the power division in a passive 3-branch waveguide power divider. The limitation and range of validity of this method were pointed out. An alternative method was also employed to predict the power division when coupling between two neighbouring branches is not negligible, as is the case when the branching angle becomes small. The multimode field-matching method was also employed to predict the power division in an active 3-branch waveguide switch, where switching is achieved through the electrooptic effect of LiNbO$ sb3$. The edge effect of the electrodes on the beam steering was also considered. A linear mode-confinement modulator was then proposed and investigated as a derivative of the 3-branch waveguide switch. Fabrication and experimental characterization of the three devices were also carried out. Key functional parameters were measured and compared with theoretical predictions. In general experimental results have borne out theoretical prediction. Some calibration of the fabrication techniques employed, were also performed. An outline of the various experimental techniques used is also given. Finally, some possible improvements are suggested for further work.</description><creator>Bélanger, Michel, 1956-</creator><date>1986</date><subject>Optical wave guides</subject><subject>Wave guides</subject><title>Theoretical and experimental studies on active and passive 3-branch waveguides and their derivatives</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cc08hg142.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/s4655h33w</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:v979v3788</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:55:02Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The Hyp (hypophosphatemic) mouse, a murine homologue of X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH) in man, is a Mendelian disorder of phosphate (Pi) homeostasis. The mutant genotype is characterized by abnormal Pi transport at the brush border membrane (BBM) of the proximal tubule and a defect in renal metabolism of vitamin D$ sb3$. The exact nature of these defects has not been elucidated. In order to determine if the defect is intrinsic to the renal cell or dependent upon an extrinsic humoral factor, I established primary cultures of renal epithelial cells from normal and Hyp mouse kidney. The cultures demonstrated several differentiated properties of epithelial cells of the renal proximal tubule, the site of the Pi transport defect in the Hyp mouse. Primary cultures initiated from Hyp mice had decreased Pi transport (expressed as an uptake ratio, Pi/$ alpha$-MG), and increased production of 24,25 dihydroxyvitamin D$ sb3$. These results provide evidence for the intrinsic nature of the primary defect in the Hyp mouse. This appears to be the first time that expression of a mutant transport gene has been demonstrated in cultured renal cells.</description><creator>Bell, Cindy Lea.</creator><date>1986</date><subject>Mice -- Cytology.</subject><subject>Mice -- Genetics.</subject><title>Transport studies in primary cultures of mouse renal epithelial cells</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sx61dn05s.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/v979v3788</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:3t945r44q</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:55:02Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The control law that is investigated in this thesis is referred to as the acceleration feedback control law, first introduced by (Luo and Saridis 1983). The study of the error performance of this control law under non-ideal conditions is the subject of this thesis. A design methodology evolves from the theoretical foundations of the acceleration feedback control law. The design methodology yields a robust, high performance closed loop robot manipulator system. Design experiments are performed on a PUMA 600 robot manipulator and the closed loop performance is analyzed by simulation study. The control law objective is to ensure that the manipulator joint coordinate trajectory is maintained with respect to a desired joint trajectory. The stability and error performance properties of the acceleration feedback control law are analytically examined by a Lyapunov stability analysis. The effects of integral control and computed torque augmentation are also examined in the stability and error performance analysis. The robustness properties, in the presence of high frequency unstructured uncertainties, are examined by classical frequency domain techniques. The theoretical results are verified by simulation. The simulation model test-bed is based on a PUMA 600 robot manipulator which is used throughout the thesis to support theoretical results. The goal of this thesis is in presenting the acceleration feedback control law with an accompanying design methodology as a practical robot manipulator control law. The design methodology allows robot manipulator system designers to implement this control law as a simple, inexpensive, microprocessor based servomechanism at each joint. The theoretical development not only accounts for the intrinsic design trade-offs but also assures designers that the implementation will yield a robust, high performance closed loop system. This detailed design methodology is presented and a sample design is carried out and verified by simulation. The effects due to sampling, quantization, friction and frequency uncertainty are included in the simulation study.</description><creator>Studenny, John.</creator><date>1987</date><subject>Robotics</subject><subject>Manipulators (Mechanism)</subject><subject>Automatic control</subject><title>Control of robotic manipulators using acceleration feedback</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bv73c118r.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3t945r44q</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:jw827c49c</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:55:02Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Regulation of eucaryotic protein synthesis was studied by three different approaches. One of these studies focused on the regulation of mRNA translation in poliovirus infected cells. Evidence indicated that proteolysis of the p220 component of the CBP complex was not sufficient to obtain complete inhibition of host cell protein synthesis after poliovirus infection. This suggested the existence of an additional viral function in order to achieve the full inhibition of cellular mRNA translation observed after infection. The effect of viral infection on host protein synthesis and, in particular, on mRNA association with the cytoskeleton was also investigated. Results indicated that (1) all mRNAs studied, appeared to associate with the cytoskeleton fraction during protein synthesis, irrespective of their 5$ sp prime$ and 3$ sp prime$ terminal structures; (2) although the association of mRNA with the cytoskeletal framework appears to be required, it was not found to be sufficient for protein synthesis to occur; (3) the shut-off of host protein synthesis during poliovirus but not vesicular stomatitis virus infection correlated with the release of host mRNAs from the cytoskeleton. Finally, the regulation of protein synthesis during mitosis was studied. The addition of CBP complex to cell-free extracts was shown to stimulate endogenous mRNA translation in mitotic but not interphase extracts. It was found that the 24k-CBP from mitotic cells was considerably less phosphorylated than the interphase 24k-CBP. Moreover, its ability to recognize the cap structure of mRNA, as judged by cross-linking assays, was decreased in mitotic extracts. Evidence indicated that the extent of phosphorylation of the 24k-CBP did not directly affect its cap binding activity. Possible mechanisms for the regulation of the 24k-CBP activity during mitosis have been suggested.</description><creator>Bonneau, Anne-Marie.</creator><date>1986</date><subject>Biology, General.</subject><title>Studies on the mechanism and regulation of protein synthesis in eucaryotic cells</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/j6731467g.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/jw827c49c</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biochemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:nz806047b</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:55:03Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The influence of a primarily Public form of self-awareness and of Private and Public Self-Consciousness on drunken physical aggression and complex reaction-time were examined.

Properties of the surfaces X and Y are shown to be related to certain numerical data extracted from the configuration of "missing curves" of f, that is, the curves in Y whose generic point is not in f (X). These results are then applied to the problem of decomposing birational endomorphisms of the plane into a succession of irreducible ones. A graph-theoretic machinery is developed to keep track of the desingularization of the divisors at infinity of the plane.

Schemes for rectangular arrays are classified on the basis of locality of spares within the array. A methodology is developed to analyze the yield and area utilization of reconfiguration schemes in each class. Analytical solutions are obtained for yield and area utilization of representative schemes from each class, and schemes are compared for their optimal area utilization. The effect of the size of interconnect area on yield and area utilization is analyzed. The analysis shows that the yield and area utilization decreases very sharply with the size of the interconnection network. A new reconfiguration scheme for multipipeline structures and rectangular arrays is presented, in which spare PEs are added to every column of the array, and the array is reconfigured using on-chip distributed logic by bypassing faulty PEs within each column. PEs are tested locally using near-neighbor comparisons, and scan paths are used to enhance the testability of the array. Interconnections between logical neighbors are short, and the speed penalty for reconfiguration is small. The topology of the scheme and design of reconfiguration switches are independent of array size and amount of redundancy. The design and implementation of the reconfiguration switches are presented. and logical properties of the network are studied. The scheme is analyzed for its yield and area utilization, and results are compared with other schemes. The analysis shows that even though the switches for the proposed scheme are very simple, the logical reconfigurability of the scheme is comparable to other schemes, and therefore, the scheme will provide better yield and area utilization than most of the other schemes for multipipeline structures and rectangular arrays.</description><creator>Jain, Ajai</creator><date>1990</date><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>Design and analysis of a new reconfiguration scheme for multipipeline structures and rectangular arrays</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vx021f97z.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2b88qc88q</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:tm70mv86n</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:55:04Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Six experiments were conducted to address the role of phonological information in visual word recognition. A semantic decision task was used to ensure that word meanings were accessed. Experiments 1-4 showed that subjects make more false positive errors on homophone foils (e.g. living thing-FLEE) than on spelling controls (e.g. living thing-FLEX) only when both members of the homophone pair are uncommon and are similarly spelled. In Experiment 5, there was an increase in errors on low but not high frequency homophone category exemplars when they were preceded by a word related to the other member of the homophone pair (e.g. SHATTER-BRAKE). In Experiment 6, subjects produced longer decision latencies on homophone exemplars than on semantic controls only when they were low in frequency. These results indicate that, even in skilled readers, phonological information mediates the access of meaning for low frequency words, and that orthographic activation also contributes to the activation of their meanings.</description><creator>Jared, Debra J.

Kex1p antiserum identified a 113 kDa protein that was absent in kex1-$ Delta$ cells and more abundant in cells overexpressing KEX1. Kex1p was found to be a type I membrane associated glycoprotein with N-linked carbohydrate. The N-linked oligosaccharide was modified in a progressive manner after synthesis, causing the glycoprotein to slowly increase in mass to 115 kDa. After a Kex2p-mediated cleavage event at specific pairs of basic amino acids, $ alpha$-factor and K1 killer toxin precursors have COOH-terminal dibasic residue extensions and require a carboxypeptidase B-like activity to process the precursors to maturity. A carboxypeptidase activity, with apparent specificity for basic amino acids, was detected in KEX1 cells. Disruption of the KEX1 gene abolished this activity, while overexpression of KEX1 increased it. These results provide biochemical evidence, consistent with earlier genetic work, that KEX1 encodes a serine carboxypeptidase involved in the processing of precursors to secreted mature proteins. Immunological and activity studies indicate that most Kex1p is intracellular and suggests that the enzyme is retained within the secretory pathway. COOH-terminal truncations of the protein indicate that the cytoplasmically exposed domain of Kex1p is responsible for correct localisation of the protein, probably in the late Golgi. When KEX1 was expressed in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Kex1p was localised in structures consistent with components of the Golgi. Mammalian cells expressing KEX1 produce a membrane associated activity that is not detected in the medium. In immunofluorescence studies on mammalian cells, Kex1p was localised to the ER and Golgi but not to the plasma membrane. Kex1p in such cells was responsible for completing the processing of the neuropeptide, $ gamma$-lipotropin. This in vivo processing of $ gamma$-lipotropin by Kex1p demonstrates a significant functional homology of the basic prohormone processing machinery in yeast and neuroendocrine cells.</description><creator>Cooper, Antony</creator><date>1990</date><subject>Carboxypeptidases.</subject><subject>Saccharomyces cerevisiae -- Genetics.</subject><title>Characterisation of the Kex1-encoded processing carboxypeptidase of Saccharomyces cerevisiae</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/hm50ts28v.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/tq57nr687</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:cj82k7947</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:55:05Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis uses a study of the relationship between Japanese archaeology and its social, political and economic context to explore the issue of relativism versus positivism in archaeological interpretation. This is done through (1) a historical analysis of the growth of Japanese archaeological work and buried cultural properties administration prior to and after 1945, (2) a description of how Japanese political and business elites have used archaeological sites and information from the Asuka area to create a symbol of the Japanese people's national identity and (3) a presentation of opinions of archaeologists working in the buried cultural properties administrative system, during the mid-1980s, about the role of archaeology in contemporary Japan. This analysis of the history of Japanese archaeology shows that archaeological data have been used to rewrite a new Japanese history from 1945, but that archaeologists, while retaining control of the organization of archaeological research, may not control how archaeological information is used by the society as a whole. The study concludes that neither an extreme positivist nor an extreme relativist position is valid when discussing the relationship between archaeology and its social context.</description><creator>Fawcett, Clare P.</creator><date>1990</date><subject>Nationalism -- Japan</subject><subject>Archaeology -- Japan</subject><title>A study of the socio-political context of Japanese archaeology /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/jd472x116.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cj82k7947</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Anthropology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:fn106z825</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:55:05Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This dissertation examines class and ethnicity in the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) of Southeastern Bangladesh. The indigenous people of this region are now in a minority because of the influx of Bengalees. This study argues that ethnic conflicts, ethnicity or "tribalism" in the CHT emerged as consequences of British, Pakistani and Bengalee colonialism, modernization and development projects undertaken by the international development agencies; these factors changed the relations of production and were accompanied by militarization of the area and a destruction of the traditional mode of life. Ethnicity as an ideology has played a determinant role in the CHT rather than class, despite the fact that the CHT groups and the Bengalees are divided into several socio-economic levels. Here, class interests and class issues are undermined and overshadowed by the presence of ethnic antagonisms and an ideology of "tribalism" among Bengalees and the indigenous CHT peoples.</description><creator>Dewan, Aditya Kumar</creator><date>1990</date><subject>Chittagong (Bangladesh) -- Ethnic relations</subject><subject>Ethnicity -- Bangladesh -- Chittagong.</subject><subject>Social classes -- Bangladesh -- Chittagong.</subject><title>Class and ethnicity in the hills of Bangladesh</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/08612p34m.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fn106z825</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Anthropology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:xw42n873v</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:55:05Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Consideration of alternative methods for the disposal of bauxite waste by the aluminum industry has generated interest in the ability of bauxite waste solid constituents to attain a certain degree of physical integrity upon drying to yield a material of suitable strength properties. This thesis study seeks to provide insight into the development of physical integrity in bauxite waste through elucidation of potentially operative bonding mechanisms in a selected Jamaican bauxite waste which is observed to dry to a material of relatively high post-dehydration strength properties. Interest in the ability of bauxite waste solids to attain a certain degree of physical integrity extends to an application, proposed in this study, involving the potential use of bauxite waste as a contaminant stabilization/solidification medium. Efforts at facilitating elucidation of potentially operative bonding mechanisms are accomplished by means of a comparative study involving a second bauxite waste derived from Guinea bauxite which, despite its similar mineralogy to the selected Jamaican bauxite waste, was observed to dry to a material of low post-dehydration strength properties. Results obtained from the study revealed the apparently important role of hydroxylated oxide/hydrous oxide surfaces of high specific surface in governing the development of physical integrity. A parallel study concerned with the ion adsorption properties of Jamaican bauxite waste was as well conducted in efforts to further aid in establishing the potential for use of bauxite waste as a contaminant stabilization/solidification medium. Adsorption tests were conducted using four ions (Cl$ sp-$, SO$ sb4 sp-$, K$ sp+$, and Pb$ sp{++}$) selected on the basis of valency and sign of charge. The results indicated the marked ability of the bauxite waste solids to adsorb lead both below and above the measured point of zero charge (PZC) of the bauxite waste solids. The results also indicated sulphate, contrary to chloride, was readily adsorbed provided it was added as its acid. When added as its salt (Na$ sb2$SO$ sb4$), no sulphate adsorption was observed even at pH values well below the PZC. The postulated chemisorption-type interaction of lead and other heavy metals with hydroxylated oxide/hydrous oxide surfaces suggests that certain bauxite wastes, particularly those which exhibit high post-dehydration strength properties, may be well suited for use in contaminant stabilization/solidification applications.</description><creator>Ludwig, Ralph</creator><date>1987</date><subject>Engineering, Sanitary and Municipal.</subject><subject>Engineering, Chemical.</subject><subject>Engineering, Civil.</subject><title>A study of post-dehydration bonding and ion adsorption in a bauxite waste /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zw12z599n.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xw42n873v</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Civil Engineering and Applied Mechanics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:f7623d33c</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:55:06Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In recent years, research with students identified as academically gifted has focused on what processes enable these students to perform at high levels of ability. The present study was carried out in the context of exploring the role of metacognition in giftedness. A specific focus of the study was whether learning-disabled gifted students performed more similarly to their gifted or nongifted peers (i.e., learning-disabled or average-achieving) on measures of metacognition. An interview was used to assess metacognitive knowledge in reading, and the error-detection paradigm was paired with the think-aloud method of data collection to investigate metacognitive skills in monitoring comprehension while reading a text. The dependent variables were an index of metacognitive knowledge, the percentage of metacognitive statements made, the number of errors detected, and a comprehension score. A measure of prior knowledge was used as a covariate. The subjects were 48 boys, drawn equally from both the elementary and high school grade levels, who had been identified by their respective school systems as being gifted, learning-disabled gifted, average-achieving, or learning-disabled. The design incorporated two levels of giftedness (gifted or not gifted) and two levels of learning disability (learning-disabled or not learning-disabled) at two grade levels (elementary and high school). Results of the multivariate analysis of covariance revealed a main effect for giftedness, indicating that the subjects identified as gifted performed significantly better than did the nongifted subjects. This result, coupled with the lack of gifted-by-learning disabilities interaction, showed that the learning-disabled gifted subjects performed more like their gifted than their nongifted peers on the four dependent variables. There was also a main effect for grade, with the subjects at the high school level performing better on the dependent variables than the subjects in the elementary grade level. Finally, a grade-by-gifted interaction was revealed, which an examination of the univariate analyses of variance indicated was most likely due to a ceiling effect on the measures of metacognitive knowledge and comprehension. These results support the hypotheses that giftedness is related to the use of metacognitive skills in a comprehension-monitoring task, and that the learning-disabled gifted subjects perform characteristically like their gifted peers with respect to their use of metacognitive knowledge and skills.</description><creator>Hannah, C.

Interictal discharges were simulated in hippocampal slices using the low Ca$ sp{2+}$ model where synaptic transmission is blocked. The antiepileptic drug valproic acid (VPA), which is postulated to potentiate GABAergic responses, reduced the low Ca$ sp{2+}$ field bursts, thereby suggesting a non-synaptic mechanism of action of VPA. Extracellular and intracellular recordings from hippocampal neurones bathed in low Ca$ sp{2+}$ solution revealed that even though evoked transmitter release was blocked, small spontaneous GABAergic release still persisted and that a voltage-dependent Cl conductance contributed to burst termination. To test the hypothesis that epileptiform activity induced by lowering extracellular Ca$ sp{2+}$ was in part due to an alteration in the delicate balance between intracellular messengers, I investigated the effects of Ca$ sp{2+}$ (a) on the activity of hippocampal neurones, and (b) on the second messengers activated by acetylcholine (ACh), a neuromodulator known for its seizure promoting effects.

Activation of protein kinase C (PKC), a Ca$ sp{2+}$-binding protein, by phorbol esters enhanced high threshold Ca$ sp{2+}$ currents and subsequently facilitated neurotransmitter release (both excitatory and inhibitory) without significantly affecting ACh-induced effects. Inhibition of PKC by several dual PKC and Ca$ sp{2+}$/calmodulin-dependent kinase antagonists, such as H-7, sphingosine, and trifluoroperazine reduced inhibitory transmission and prevented ACh-induced effects. The evidence presented in this thesis was combined with that in the literature to propose a model accounting for the seizure-promoting effects of ACh: that gangliosides and/or sphingolipids are metabolized to sphingosine upon muscarinic receptor activation leading to inhibition of both PKC and Ca$ sp{2+}$/calmodulin-dependent kinases.</description><creator>Agopyan, Nadia M.</creator><date>1990</date><subject>Biology, Animal Physiology.</subject><title>The involvement of second messengers in hippocampal activity and seizure /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v118rf26r.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0z708x29k</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Physiology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:vh53ww50w</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:55:07Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The pathway of receptor-mediated endocytosis in exocrine pancreatic cells of the rat was studied. The pathway was explored using insulin radiolabeled with iodine-125 detectable by the technique of radioautography. Insulin was seen at the cell membrane soon after administration of the radiolabeled hormone. After 10 and 20 minutes silver grains were found over compartments deep within the cells, at distances greater than 5 half-distances. Grains were also seen to be associated with endosomal vesicles characterized by heavily stained, often fuzzy, membrane. At this time and later times of 45 minutes, grains were observed over zymogen granules. A group of rats was treated with chloroquine to interfere with intracellular vesicle acidification. The results revealed an accumulation of insulin in endosomes and in presecretory and secretory granules. Degradation of insulin was found to be significantly inhibited by chloroquine in the liver but not in the pancreas. Degradation of insulin in normal rats was found to be slow in the pancreas but fast in the liver. The results suggest that insulin is internalized to endosomes within which it may be degraded. Internalized insulin was also seen in the trans Golgi network and zymogen granules, especially after chloroquine treatment. This suggests an access route from endocytic to exocytic compartments which may be related to the pathway of sorting of lysosomal proteins. It may also be significant in the transcytosis of insulin to the pancreatic duct.</description><creator>Cruz, Javier</creator><date>1990</date><subject>Biology, Animal Physiology.</subject><subject>Biology, Cell.</subject><title>The internalization pathway of insulin in exocrine pancreatic cells /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0g354f91s.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vh53ww50w</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Anatomy</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><resumptionToken completeListSize="47894">oai_etdms.s(Collection:theses).f(2019-10-16T06:03:34Z).u(2020-07-23T18:55:55Z).t(47894):35900</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>
