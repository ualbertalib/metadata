Having left the absurd behind, having experienced revolt, Camus now brings to the forefront a theme that underlies all his work, the essential solitude of human beings. This thesis attempts to illustrate the various manifestations of this theme in the last works of the Algerian writer in order to underline the remarkable cohesion of these formally dissimilar texts.</description><creator>Pagé, Sylvain</creator><date>1992</date><subject>Camus, Albert, 1913-1960.

T. A. Hoffmann (1776-1822) in Russia, which reached a highpoint around 1830. The interest in Hoffmann at this time is also reflected in the literary production of some Russian authors. One of the most important pioneers in this area was Antonij Pogorel'skij (1787-1836), at the present time an almost forgotten writer who, nevertheless, is regarded as the first significant representative of the so-called "Russian Hoffmannism." This study sets out to analyze two comparable short stories, E. T. A. Hoffmann's "Der Sandmann" (The Sandman) and A. Pogorel'skij's "Pernicious Consequences of an Unrestrained Imagination". Besides the extensive comparative interpretation which concerns itself with the questions of origin and genre, as well as plot and character analysis, this study offers an insight into the structure and function of elements of the uncanny in these texts and their realisation in the rhetorical sphere. The correspondence in the content of these two stories justifies the title, "Mystery and Imagination", which has been borrowed from E. A. Poe.</description><creator>Rybicki, Dariusz A.

The prevalence survey was conducted among children in Grade four (age 9-11 years) in five schools, selected to represent a wide range of socioeconomic status (SES). Asthma was defined as a history of wheeze, or doctor diagnosed asthma, or a decline of FEV1 of $ ge$10% at 5 or 10 minutes post exercise. Of the 409 children studied, 77 cases and 77 age and gender matched controls were identified, and visits made to their homes to carry out visual inspection and questionnaire administration. Assessment included: house construction material, cooking fuel, air pollution in or around the house, child's bedding material, presence of rugs, carpets, sofas, or pets; evidence of damp damage, and nutritional information including salt intake. The following factors were significantly associated with asthma: damp damage in the child's sleeping area (odds ratio (OR): 4.38; 95% confidence interval (CI) $ {$2.11, 9.11$ }$), air pollution in the home (OR: 2.97; 95% CI $ {$1.40, 6.32$ }$), presence of rugs or carpets in child's bedroom (OR: 2.92; 95% CI $ {$1.35, 6.34$ }$).</description><creator>Mohamed, Nashila</creator><date>1992</date><subject>Health Sciences, Public Health.</subject><subject>Biology, Biostatistics.</subject><title>Association of the home environment and asthma in Kenyan school children : a case-control study</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/jh343t47t.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pz50gx403</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:3197xm98t</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:02:49Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis discusses a major dimension of Ducharme's novels which critics have generally evoked only in the form of analytical outlines, and in order to suggest directions for research. Bakhtin's work in the formal study of ideology presents fertile ground for description of Ducharme's text. The specificity of Les enfantomes lies in the representation of the play of ideology's discursive forms: pastiche and satire of literary doctrines, parody of texts, of discourses and of the commonplace, presence of potentially conflicting literary doctrines. In terms of methodology, the dialogic principle is perfectly suited to the development of narrative semiotics. Accordingly, Hamon's notion of effet-ideologie makes it possible to describe those areas where ideology appears on the textual surface as normative-evaluative devices integrated in the text. In terms of analytical procedures, the narrative text may be approached as a construction whose specificity resides in the way it reacts to social discourses which it at once absorbs and transforms (Zima). Furthermore, the sociolinguistic context in which the novel is born fosters the emergence of plurilinguism (Kwaterko).</description><creator>McMillan, Gilles, 1955-</creator><date>1992</date><subject>Ducharme, Réjean.

This thesis will attempt to demonstrate that Kohlberg's approach to moral education cannot, by its very nature, be a viable alternative for moral education in regard to either individual or societal moral needs. Although Kohlberg's system has been defended for its "classroom dilemmas", associated pedagogical techniques and its "just community" approach to problem solving, this thesis will attempt to show that these approaches have consequences which are in themselves detrimental to the development of a positive moral standard. The use of Kohlberg's system would result in extreme subjectivism and relativism which are destructive to a basic objective moral standard for society.</description><creator>Quammie, Arsinoée

protein (MBP) using two different polylinkers, one comprising of the traditional recognition motif for FXa (IEGR) and the other for thrombin (FNPR), as part of an effort to resolve its three-dimensional solution structure by NMR spectroscopy. The construct encoding the thrombin cleavage site provided a fusion protein that exhibited superior proteolytic cleavage efficiency. This allowed the production of sufficient SHN1C to allow us to examine its behavior in aqueous solutions. Purification of SHN1C from MBP and other cleavage products could only be accomplished by allowing the protein of interest to precipitate at pH 7.0. Likewise, SHN1C is highly insoluble in aqueous solvents, particularly between pH 5.5-7.0, thus making it impossible to perform proton resonance assignments. Binding studies between the SHN1C-containing fusion protein and two phosphotyrosyl-containing peptides (derived from the C-terminal end of PTP 1C), pNPP, and pTyr were performed using NMR methods. No evidence for binding was found for each case. It is therefore postulated that SHN1C may regulate the catalytic activity of PTP 1C by interacting with specific regions of the full length enzyme via a phosphotyrosine-independent mechanism.</description><creator>Quraishi, Omar</creator><contributor>Sanctuary, Bryan (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1994</date><subject>Chemistry, Biochemistry.</subject><title>Expression, purification, and NRM characterization of the N-terminal SH2 domain of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1C</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mc87pr579.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/12579t45h</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Chemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:wd375x594</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:02:56Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Using a novel purification scheme and a new assay for detection of DNA kinase activity, a Polymin P-precipitable DNA kinase has been identified and characterized from calf thymus extracts. The DNA kinase activity was able to phosphorylate RNA as well as single-stranded and double-stranded DNA, therefore it has been termed Polymin P-precipitable polynucleotide kinase (PP-PNK). The enzyme had a neutral to alkaline, broad pH optimum that distinguished it from the previously described mammalian DNA kinases that have an acidic pH optimum. The sedimentation coefficient of the enzyme was 3.4-3.8 S, indicating a molecular weight of about 50 kDa. Estimates for the K$ sb{ rm M}$ for ATP were 52 $ mu$M and for the oligonucleotide substrate 8 $ mu$M. The activity was inhibited by pyrophosphate anions and to a lesser extent by sulfate anions. These results differentiate PP-PNK from other mammalian polynucleotide kinases.</description><creator>Prinos, Panagiotis</creator><contributor>Rosenblatt, David (Supervisor)</contributor><contributor>Lasko, Dana (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1994</date><subject>Protein kinases.</subject><subject>Phosphorylation.</subject><subject>DNA -- Metabolism.</subject><title>Purification and characterization of a mammalian DNA kinase</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3n204044c.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/wd375x594</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:5x21tg593</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:02:57Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The El Nino phenomenon has a major impact over wide regions of the Pacific and possibly all over the world. The purpose of this thesis was to study its effects, specifically along the coast of British Columbia. An analysis of sea-surface temperature, sea-surface salinity and sea-level height was made with respect to El Nino events. Based on the results of that analysis, a model was developed. The model uses Kelvin wave dynamics, and can be used to predict the approximate time and magnitude of the sea-surface temperature anomaly created by an El Nino event. This prediction can be useful for fishermen because the anomaly of temperature has a major effect on the distribution pattern of fish. In conclusion, an analysis of water temperature and salinity anomalies as a function of depth as well as offshore distance was made.</description><creator>Robert, Marie</creator><contributor>Ingram, R.

In such cases we seek a modified likelihood that will allow us to make inference on the parameters of interest with as little loss of information as possible. In the present work we will investigate some of these modified likelihoods, namely marginal likelihoods, conditional likelihoods, profile likelihoods, partial likelihoods, empirical likelihoods, and functions that exhibit properties similar to the ones of the likelihoods, more precisely the quasi-likelihoods. We will point out some cases where these modified likelihoods give rise to satisfactory estimations, and some other cases where they fail to give satisfactory estimations.</description><creator>Rahme, Elham H.</creator><date>1994</date><subject>Statistics.</subject><title>Likelihoods : a survey</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bn9997943.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pk02cc077</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mathematics and Statistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:hq37vp83f</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:02:57Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In the southeastern Yukon Territory, Quaternary continental alkaline basalts have erupted across an important crustal suture, the Tintina Trench, which separates the accreted terranes of the Canadian Cordillera from the ancestral North American craton. The lavas from the Rancheria region from the west side of the Tintina Trench are basanites (BASAN), alkaline olivine basalts (AOB), and hypersthene-normative basalts (HYN). They display fractionated rare earth element (REE) profiles and are enriched in light rare earth elements (LREE) and high field strength elements (HFSE). The involvement of amphibole in the petrogenesis of the Rancheria alkaline magmas indicates that these magmas were generated within the lithosphere. At the eastern end of the Rancheria suite, on the east side of the Tintina Trench, the AOB from Watson Lake have higher Zr contents than Rancheria AOB to the west of the Trench. The high Zr contents of the Watson Lake AOB are similar to those observed in the Hoole Eocene tholeiitic basalts, on the east side of the Tintina Trench, further to the north. The Eocene basalts from the Hoole River region are olivine tholeiites which have experienced closed-system crystal fractionation of olivine at low pressure. The estimated primary magma for these Eocene basalts appears to have been derived by partial melting of an incompatible-element enriched lithospheric mantle source, during which garnet was not a residual phase. The Nb-Zr systematics of the Watson Lake basalts indicate that they may be derived by mixing between melts produced by melting of an amphibole-bearing residue and a lithospheric mantle similar in composition to that of the Hoole basalts. Therefore, these compositional differences in the alkaline basalts across the Tintina Trench appear to reflect the juxtaposition of chemically distinct continental lithospheric mantles, indicating that the Tintina Fault is a steep lithospheric suture.</description><creator>Hasik, Valérie</creator><contributor>Francis, Don (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1994</date><subject>Geology.</subject><title>Volcanic evidence for a compositional contrast in the lithospheric upper mantle across the Tintina Trench, Southeastern Yukon, Canada</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/x920fx997.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hq37vp83f</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:0k225c26x</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:02:58Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of reversible fetal tracheal occlusion on lung development. Nine fetal sheep were divided into two groups. Group 1 had intratracheal balloons placed and the balloons left inflated for 21-28 days. Group 2 consisted of littermates that served as controls. They had either uninflated balloons placed or were left unoperated. Tracheal pressure measurements were periodically recorded and the amniotic fluid pressure served as a reference. The animals were sacrificed near term and the lungs, heart and liver were weighed and corrected for body weight. Standard morphometry was used to compare the lungs further and the lung DNA and protein content were measured. Tracheal damage from the balloon catheter was also assessed. Tracheal pressure was 3.85 ($ pm$.49 S.E.) mm Hg in experimental animals while it was an average of $-$0.27 ($ pm$.27 S.E.) mm Hg in controls (p $&lt;$.0001). Tracheal occlusion increased lung weight and volume by 2-3 times (p $&lt;$.0001 and p =.0006, respectively) while heart and liver weights remained similar to controls. Airspace fraction and radial alveolar counts were raised (p =.044 and p =.0002, respectively) and alveolar number per body weight was doubled (p $&lt;$.0001). The alveolar number per lung volume was preserved, however, as was the DNA and protein content per unit weight of lung tissue. The chronic indwelling balloon catheter caused some mucosal and submucosal damage at the balloon site and proximal to it. These results show that tracheal occlusion leads to an elevation of intratracheal pressure that is associated with a tremendous increase in lung growth over a short period in the third trimester fetal sheep. The techniques used in this experiment may be easily modified for use with endoscopic surgical equipment.</description><creator>Hashim, Ezat</creator><contributor>Laberge, J. M.

The effects of ventilation on the computed tomography (CT) density distribution of pulmonary edema are unclear. We hypothesized that ventilation might open up previously collapsed alveoli with consequent reduced lung density, and that some movement of the alveolar edema fluid might also occur from the alveoli to the interstitium. To address this problem, pulmonary edema was induced in 16 supine dogs by airways instillation of a protein solution similar to serum in each lower lung lobe through a double lumen tracheal tube. The dogs were ventilated only on the left side for 1 min (n = 4), 30 min (n = 6) or 60 min (n = 6). The lower lobes were excised, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and imaged in a CT scanner. Representative regions of interest (ROI) were chosen and tissue sections from corresponding regions were taken for extravascular lung water (Qwl/dQl) and regional blood measurements, and for histology to grade interstitial and alveolar edema. There was a significant (P $&lt;$ 0.05) fall in the CT density of the left lower lobes compared with the right lower lobes in the groups ventilated 30 and 60 min, but no differences in Qwl/dQl or blood content. The histological grading showed a trend (P = 0.054) for more interstitial edema in the left lower lobes in the 60 min ventilation group compared with left lower lobes in the 1 min ventilation group. These data show that in our model of instilled alveolar edema, ventilation acts primarily by increasing aeration by 30 min and that it has a minor role in moving fluid to the interstitium.</description><creator>Iancu, Dan M.</creator><contributor>Michel, R.
