These studies were carried out in vagotomized, chloralosed, artificially ventilated cats. Samples of the perfusates were collected at fixed intervals to analyze the cation concentrations. Perfusions with either CSF alone or low I-noradrenaline bitartrate (NA) concentrations produced no significant changes in either blood pressure, ECG or heart rate. Perfusions with higher concentrations of NA significantly increased blood pressure and K+ concentrations in the perfusates. Following pretreatment with various agents (reserpine, tranylcypromine, chlorpromazine and imipramine) similar NA perfusions induced no significant blood pressure changes and blocked the K+ effect seen with NA perfusions alone. Further pretreatment with chlorpromazine and imipramine significantly reduced blood pressure with a concomitant increase in Mg++ concentrations. It is concluded that centrally initiated noradrenaline blood pressure responses appear to involve K+ movements in the CNS and that the blood pressure responses following central pretreatment with chlorpromazine and imipramine involve Mg++ movements in the central nervous system.</description><creator>Johnson, Melvin C.</creator><contributor>Melville, K.

All experiments, except one at 5 ata., were done with OHP at 4 ata. Both lung-thorax and isolated lung preparations were used. No changes in the static pressure-volume curves were seen, indicating that the pulmonary alveolar surfactant had not changed at this point early in the evolution of pulmonary oxygen toxicity. Any surfactant effect must be small and terminal. A large decrease in resistance to air flow ten minutes after gasping in OHP at 4 ata, was seen, both in isolated and lungs in the intact chest. This decrease was not due to pressure alone, but is probably due to bronchodilatation, and is accompanied by a shift to the left of the static inflation pressure-volume curve of isolated lungs.</description><creator>Hurley, Robert M.</creator><contributor>Rosenberg, E.

Glutaraldehyde fixation, celloidin-paraffin double embedding and PAS-haematoxylin staining revealed two distinct parenchymal cell populations. Chromophilic cells were follicular cells; the chromophobic population resembled light cells. To prove chromophobes were indeed light cells, comparisons were made between chromophobic cells in glutaraldehyde-fixed thyroid lobes and light cells in Bouin-fixed lobes (which were reliably identified by absence of colloid droplets after TSH stimulation). Chromophobes showed no colloid droplets after TSH stimulation, and the incidence of chromophobes in glutaraldehyde-fixed lobes was not significantly different from light cell incidence in Bouin-fixed lobes of the same glands. It is concluded that this is a valid method for demonstration of light cells in rat thyroid glands and may be used for accurate identification and counting of these cells.</description><creator>Hatcher, Norma H.</creator><contributor>Nadler, N.

The hemorrhagic shock model was produced by femoral arterial bleeding followed by retransfusion, while the mesenteric ischemia was produced by clamping the superior mesenteric artery for 105 minutes.

These findings suggests peripheral defect in V02. This study seeks to examine the suggested peripheral defect in V02 in patients with septic shock and to see if it occurs in the dog after E. coli endotoxin injection. Narrowed AVD with normal or elevated CI occurred in 11 of 20 patients studied. AVD correlated inversely with CI. In the dog given E. coli endotoxin, there was marked widening of the AVD and decrease in cardiac output. In patients with septic shock and dogs with endotoxic shock, arterial bleed lactate correlated inversely with V02 but did not correlate with pC02. In 5 patients with hypoxemia and septic shock, oxygen therapy did not improve V02. These findings in patients with septic shock imply cellular damage or arteriovenous shunting. In the dog with endotoxin shock, decreased V02 is due to inadequate blood flow.</description><creator>Groves, Alan C.</creator><contributor>MacLean, L.

The thyroid glands were examined under the light microscope and tumours counted and measured by a histometric technique developed in this department. The incidence of animals with tumours in the sham-hypophysectomized group given 3 µc 131I and a low iodine diet was 96% with a mean tumour number of 5.5 and a mean tumour volume of 0.57 x 10^8 cu µ.

Experimental ascites was produced by partial constriction of supradiaphragmatic inferior vena cava. Thoracic duct to azygos vein shunt using an invagination anastomosis was performed on these ascitic animals. Ascitic animals showed a scanty excretion of urinary sodium and a poor response to acute salt loading. Establishing a patent thoracic duct to azygos vein shunt was associated with relief of ascites, increased urinary sodium excretion and a good natriuretic response to acute saline loading. Internal drainage of thoracic duct by decompressing the lymphatic system and lowering the interstitial hepatic pressure, relieves ascites and at the same time affects a possible hepatic mechanism responsible for salt regulation.</description><creator>Farkouh, Edward F.</creator><contributor>Gutelius, J.

It dealt with their party affiliation, ethnic tolerance, involvement and level of political orientation; and their dispositions towards the political system and nation as a whole. Although the study was formulated and analysed within the framework of "political socialization," it did not deal with how the students were socialized politically, but with what orientations they learned as a result of differential socialization. The results show that the students' political knowledge, level of participation and interest were, in general, relatively. low; they displayed no great national pride and only a mediocre "system affect." However, these findings were greatly modified when we controlled for the important factors of ethnicity and social class, as Negro and Indian students stood out in their political attitudes, and lower class students in their involvement.</description><creator>Douglin, Junette J.</creator><contributor>Henry, F.

In each species several proteins which were present in the posterior lobe were also found in the stalk but in decreasing amounts in its upper part. Some proteins were undetectable in the hypothalamus but present in the stalk including peptides II and III, which bind vasopressin. Protein synthesis in each of the regions was studied with 3H-I-leucine. The greatest incorporation of radioactivity occurred in the upper and middle stalk, which was twice that of the anterior lobe, while that of the posterior lobe and hypothalamus was one hundredfold less. After incubation the proteins were separated by gel filtration and electrophoresis. One component, named peptide IV, which was present in each region contained more radioactivity than either peptide II or III. The neurohypophyseal complex and especially the stalk median eminence region is the site of very active synthesis including some of the posterior lobe proteins.</description><creator>Cheng, Kwong-Wah</creator><contributor>Friesen, H.

H3-thymidine (25 µc; 0.9 µg) was injected directly into the femoral and tibial marrow during circulatory arrest of the hind limbs. One hr. to 12 days thereafter, radioautographs were prepared of injected and control marrows, blood leucocyte concentrates, and lymphoid tissues. H3-thymidine was initially incorporated only by DNA synthesizing cells of the injected marrow, but by 5 hr. labelled lymphocytes appeared. These lymphocytes appeared in the blood at 25 hr., and rapidly migrated into lymphoid tissues, namely the spleen, mesenteric lymph node, and thymus. In these organs they were located first in the cortical areas (or red pulp in the spleen), but later were found in increasing numbers in the medullary areas (white pulp in the spleen). They disappeared from these organs after 5 - 6 days. The results demonstrate a release of newly-formed marrow lymphocytes into the blood stream and their rapid localization in the lymphoid organs.</description><creator>Brahim, Feisal</creator><contributor>Osmond, D.

Sustained metacorticoid and renal hypertension could be produced in control and in partial immunosympathectomised (IMS) rats. Hypertension was accompanied by an elevation of aortic sodium. In total-IMS rats, metacorticoid hypertension could not be produced and renal hypertension was not sustained; the aortic sodium was not elevated. Methyldopa was effective in reducing the blood pressure in all groups (normotensive and hypertensive control and partial-IMS, and normotensive total-IMS rats) of animals. The hypotensive effect of methyldopa was not influenced by hexamethonium, phenoxybenzamine, propranolol or 3-hydroxybenzyloxyamine.

In spite of marked individual variation, the regional trends were consistent, with the highest concentrations of argentaffin cells in the pyloric autrum, duodenum, caecum and proximal colon. No sex differences were found. No appreciable changes in argentaffin cells were caused by treatment with atropine and pilocarpine which respectively suppress and stimulate gut motility.

A study of antithrombin and antitrypsin levels in both normal and hemophilic serum confirmed, with a few exceptions, the existence of an elevated level of antithrombin activity in hemophilia. The study showed also that the addition of AHG to serum, or extraction of the serum with ether, reduced the antithrombin activity and the activity of an inhibitor in the thromboplastin generation test. The author devised a modification of the thromboplastin generation test suitable for the investigation of inhibitors in hemophilic serum and presents further evidence for the existence of such inhibitors. The investigation adds substantial further support to the role of inhibitors in the etiology of hemophilia.</description><creator>Warrendorf, Elizabeth M.</creator><contributor>Denstedt, O.

The sample was 199 subjects from eight classes in four schools. Experimental and control classes were randomly selected. Treatment and control lessons were taught by the physical educator in each school from detailed lesson plans. The classes met for twenty minute lessons three times each week for eight weeks. Test-retest data was obtained from each group through the use of the Marianne Frostig Developmental Test of Visual Perception. The data was categorized by sex, treatment, and subtest variables. Computer programmes for the means, standard deviations and the analysis of covariance were used for statistical analysis. The results of the study indicated that on this Test, the experimental group made significant improvement in eyemotor co-ordination. Significant improvement of form constancy was obtained by the lower thirds.</description><creator>Wall, Albert E.</creator><contributor>Widdop, J.

An immunoadsorbent was prepared by coupling bovine serum albumin (BSA) to ehtylene maleic anhydride copolymer (EMA) at 0C, and used to adsorb rabbit anti-BSA antibodies from an ammonium sulphate precipitated globulin fraction of the antiserum. The antibodies were eluted by a column procedure with phosphate buffered 8 M urea or stepwise with 0.35 M glycine-HCl buffer pH 3.0, 2.5 and 2.0. Using urea to elute and a modification of the original procedure, recovery based on precipitable nitrogen was 42%. Purity was 50% based on the proportion of total nitrogen recovered which was precipitable. The yield was 10% higher than that obtained with the original procedure. When tested with normal rabbit gamma globulin, suggestive evidence was obtained for negligible amounts of non-specific adsorption. A batchwise method of elution was investigated and found to be less efficient than the column procedure.</description><creator>Rose, Esmie A.</creator><contributor>Vas, S.

The concentration of inactive monomers varies in a predictable manner during the regeneration of rat liver. The pool of ribosomal monomers decreases to 40% that of normal rat liver within 19 hours of partial hepatectomy; by 42 hours, it has returned to within 70% of the resting level. Based on 2 and 4 hour labeling in vivo, there is a linear and inverse relationship between the rate of incorporation of label from orotic acid-6-14C into the RNA of the cytoplasmic ribosomes and the size of the inactive monomer pool. This relationship suggests that the two parameters are tightly coupled and that this coupling may represent an important regulatory mechanism for ribosome synthesis. This theory is further supported by the finding that inhibitors of protein biosynthesis which catalyze the conversion of polyribosomes to monomers, appear to reduce the incorporation of label from orotic acid-6- 14C into cytoplasmic ribosomes to a greater degree than those which maintain the integrity of the polyribosome.</description><creator>Rizzo, Arturo J.</creator><contributor>Webb, T.

DEAE-Sephadex fractions of normal human serum containing YG as the only detectable immunoglobulin had the highest activity in blocking P-K sensitization. Fractions containing, YA globulin had minimal activity while YM fractions had little or no blocking activity. Heterogeneity of blocking factors in normal human sera was demonstrated by sucrose density-gradient centrifugation and Sephadex gel filtration. High molecular size fractions, with components sedimenting at 7S or greater were active, but the most active of the blocking fractions was a low molecular size fraction, sedimenting at 1-3S.</description><creator>Phills, James A.</creator><contributor>Goodfriend, L.

Findings were related to laryngeal pathology and voice quality evaluations. From tape recordings of 14 English speaking subjects with a history of hoarseness, sample words judged as most hoarse or least hoarse were selected tor spectrographic analysis. Spectrograms were measured for aperiodicity, fundamental frequency and noise components. Results for most hoarse and least hoarse samples were compared. Aperiodicity increased significantly with severity of hoarseness, supporting the findings of Lieberman (1963) and Yanagihara (1962). Noise, its lower limit and hence disruptive effect upon vowel formants, was a significant factor, with a trend for greatest disruption of supporting harmonics, less for F2 and least for Fl. Other parameters examined were not significant. Findings were related to those of Yanagihara (1964) and modifications of his tour types suggested.</description><creator>Pentland, Bridget A.</creator><contributor>Doehring, D.

Total proteins or total nucleic acids were subsequently isolated. Actinomycin D inhibited the incorporation of Adenine and Uridine into nucleic acids by more than 95 percent and inhibited Leucine incorporation into protein by about 45 percent. Insulin stimulated both protein synthesis and nucleic acid synthesis in the presence and absence of Actinomycin D. BGH stimulated protein synthesis but did not affect nucleic acid synthesis either in the presence or absence of Actinomycin D. It is concluded that the early in vitro Insulin and BGH stimulation of Leucine incorporation into protein is not dependent on a normal rate of nucleic acid synthesis, nor is the stimulation mediated by a marked increase of nucleic acid synthesis, but may be mediated by some action subsequent to RNA synthesis. Some additional investigations of the use of Actinomycin D in further elucidating the actions of Insulin and BGH are also reported.</description><creator>Patey, Paul E.</creator><contributor>Rubinstein, D.

The only orientation that has been explicitly worked out prior to this thesis is that in which all the wave vectors are confined to the xy plane of uniaxial crystals. For this orientation, the two refractive indices involved are not direction dependent. In this thesis, the geometries for an interaction plane involving the optic axis in uniaxial crystals are calculated algebraically, first for an acoustic wave vector parallel and then perpendicular to the optic axis. In both cases one of the refractive indices is direction dependent. A computer program has also been written for numerically calculating the diffraction angles for all orientations and all directions of acoustic propagation in both uniaxial and biaxial crystals. A feature introduced in this program is that the crystal faces and their orientation with respect to other vectors is taken into account. Results obtained from the general, computer program agree with the results of all the three special cases and several geometries for biaxial crystals are presented.</description><creator>Kharusi, Muhammed S.</creator><contributor>Farnell, G.

Radiological study of cirrhotics and non- cirrhotics revealed umbilico-portography to be superior to splenoportography. Phlebography of the inferior vena cava (IVC) revealed a stenosis of the IVC in many cirrhotics. In the same patients wedge hepatic venous pressure and portal venous pressure were found identical. Catecholamine determination was done by a fluorometric method. Catecholamine plasma levels are not related to portal hypertension. A liver clearance for nor-adrenaline was observed. Hepatic blood flow (HBF) determination by Bradley' s method using BSP and ICG simultaneously in subjects with liver diseases found higher than predicted values. Factors of error are discussed.
