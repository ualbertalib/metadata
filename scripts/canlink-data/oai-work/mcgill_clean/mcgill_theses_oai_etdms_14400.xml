Similarly, the pattern of agricultural controls prevailing in Barbados are almost identical as they are closely related to the marketing system that has evolved since the first settlement of the island. In this paper, the development of this settlement is used as a point of departure for an overall appreciation of these relationships in both space and time. As such, a study could not be considered in a vacuum, but rather in an atmosphere influenced and limited by traditions, resources and environment; they must be systematically investigated, instead of being left to intuition.

Elle était considérée par les gens de lettres et par ceux qui fréquentaient les salons comme un simple divertissement provincial, et le théatre sérieux était à la mode. Pourtant, appelé à jouer devant le roi, Molière a décidé de terminer sa représentation de Nicomède par le Docteur amoureux, une des farces dont il avait régalé son public provincial. La manoeuvre réussit et la pièce plut au roi. Le bon accueil fait au Docteur a dû encourager Molière. Désormais il ne cesse pas d'écrire et de jouer des farces; elles obtiennent de vifs succés. C'est, en fait, Les Précieuses ridicules, sa première pièce composée à Paris, qui fait sa réputation d'auteur-acteur. [...]</description><creator>Dickson, Jesse D. J.</creator><contributor>Mentha, G.

Glacial drift which is as thick as 450 feet in two north trending preglacial valleys, overlies shale, sandstone, sands, conglomerates and gravel formations ranging from Late Cretaceous to Early Pleistocene age. Borings and exposures along South Saskatchewan River reveal five till sheets separated by stratified deposits: three till sheets correlate with end moraines within the area. Deposits of several glacial lakes cover much of the area and overlap each other; these lakes discharged successively through spillways to the south, east and north.

The author witnessed the demolishing of old houses in Montreal, where this type of connection had been used. Up until today, however, the angle-connection has been applied to relatively low (max. three stories) buildings; and only to a very limited extent. The reason behind this hesitancy can be traced to the unknown and highly complicated nature of the angle connection, and to the fact, that in an elastic design - a plastic hinge with clearly non-linear characteriatics was to be incorporated.

One is the traditional view that all memory storage, short-term and longterm, is essentially alike, and consists of associative connections. The other, more recent view is that there are two distinct kinds of memory storage, one characteristic of short-term memory (STM), which may be loosely defined as memory for stimuli tested at some short interval after a single presentation, and the other characteristic of long-term memory (LTM), or memory which is firmly established then tested after a long interval. The opposition between these views has resulted in special interest in STM, since it is concerning the nature of STM that the two views differ most.

His proof still remains unclear but nevertheless is very similar to the proof obtained by Abel later. Looking for new types of equations solvable by radicals, the latter reached the conception of "abelian" extensions and showed the solvability by radicals in this case. He defined the notion of irreducible polynomials over a given field. After him, Galois defined what was to be called the Galois group of a polynomial and showed that a polynomial is solvable by radicals if its Galois group is solvable.

Hitherto, this has only been possible in a very crude way and only for horizontal workings. Analytical work to predict pillar loadings for long mining zones in elastic ground produces equations which include, in the form of dimensionless parameters, the significant geometrical and material-properties affecting pillar loading. Additional analytical work demonstrates that various arching and plastic theories are unlikely to be of any use in this problem.

The first part deals with waveform representation and then, using continuous-time and discrete-time representations, a particular reception problem is investigated. In the series representation of a waveform using Laguerre functions, the choice of time-scaling parameters is treated in detail. To represent a time-limited waveform by a finite series expansion it is found that a set of time-limited prolate spheroidal wave functions is the optimum N-dimensional basis, under certain power and frequency constraints. It is shown that E.M. Glaser's reception scheme using orthonormal functions, designed to detect pulse signals of duration T seconds or less, cannot be generalized to receive asynchronously an arbitrary, unknown waveform.

The Warsaw Rising of 1944 may seem to be a remote episode in the history of Polish-Soviet relations but it has, in fact, many aspects, not the least of which is its context in the history of twentieth century world relationships. It would have been beyond the scope of this work to analyze all these aspects. I have only attempted to present the genesis of the Warsaw Rising in the Polish underground struggle against the Germans and in the Polish-Soviet relations during world War II of which it is also the climax and the last forceful expression of dissent.

Since then, the role of humus in soil has been intensively studied and the meaning of humus has varied from the "organic fraction of soil" to "a dark incoherent and heterogeneous colloidal mass in soil" (Buckman and Brady 1960). Based on the latter meaning the term humus does not include any undecayed organic materials or micro-organisms in the soil. However, in the practical consideration of humus, the presence of microorganisms is usually neglected. For exemple, the well known humus fractionation method of Tyurin mentioned by Kononova (1958), does not consider that the treatment with solvent, alkali, and acid will fractionate not only the colloidal organic matter (humus) but also the undecayed organic materials and microorganisms.

By 1948, there were enough data available to indicate that adipose tissue is not an inactive storehouse (2) as stressed by Wertheimer and Shapiro in their classic review. One of the most striking and the most studied functions of adipose tissue is the release of free fatty acids (FFA). The rate at which this occurs varies widely under the influence of numerous metabolic, hormonal, pharmacologioal and nervous stimuli.

Throughout his literary career, Johnson had frequently pondered over the components of genius, but never before had he given it so succinct a definition. Three immediate questions come to mind. What are the tools of genius? On what materials should they be used? To what ultimate purpose should the genius work? [...]</description><creator>Cherniavsky, Felix.</creator><contributor>Hemlow, J.

Although the yolk and albumen are approximately equal in their content of proteins, carbohydrates and minerals, the yolk contains practically all the lipids. Consequently, very little is known about the lipids of the albumen whereas the lipids of the yolk have been studied extensively. Fresh egg yolk contains 33% lipids (66% on a moisture free basis) and about 16% protein (Romanoff and Romanoff, 1949). These lipids consist of neutral glycerides, phospholipids and sterols. The exact chemical structure of the egg yolk lipids is still uncertain mainly because of the extreme difficulty encountered in any attempt to isolate them in a pure state.

Typically, the low density solid may consist of hollow polyolefin spheres. Normally the solid phase would be fluidized when the upward gas velocity reaches the critical value. However, the simultaneous down-flow of the liquid phase increases the ease of fluidization. Over a wide range of flow rates a state of vigorous contacting between the gas and 1iquid phases is obtained as a result of the motion of the solid phase.
