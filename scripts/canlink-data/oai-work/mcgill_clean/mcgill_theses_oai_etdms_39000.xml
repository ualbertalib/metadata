In the U.S., the routinization of episiotomy resulted from strenuous lobbying efforts of a small group of obstetrician/gynecologists between 1915 and 1935. These physicians claimed episiotomy prevented perineal lacerations, infant mortality and morbidity, and gynecological problems. In the U.K., the liberal use of episiotomy came about during the 1970s from pressure from obstetricians although no overt campaigning for the practice occurred. In both countries adoption of routine episiotomy was encouraged by social forces which involved changes occurring in the dominant belief system in obstetrics, maternity care practices, and the obstetrics and midwifery professions. Questioning of the practice by childbirth activists and others eventually led to declines in episiotomy. This was facilitated, particularly in Britain, by midwifery interest in resisting obstetrical control. Neither the adoption nor rejection of routine episiotomy was informed by scientific evidence. This study contributes to understanding the process of innovation in maternity care.</description><creator>Graham, Ian D. (Ian Douglas), 1961-</creator><contributor>Rains, P.

GVHR was induced by the injection of parental lymphoid cells into F1 hybrid recipient mice. The ensuing acute reaction consisted of an initial immunoproliferative phase, followed by the development of profound immunosuppression and histopathological lesions of epithelial and lymphoid tissues. Survivors of the acute reaction developed the persistent immune abnormalities characteristic of chronic GVHR. We have found that the T cell protein tyrosine kinases p56$ rm sp{lck}$ and p59$ rm sp{fyn}$, involved in signal transduction through the T cell receptor (TCR), are downregulated in the T cells of mice during GVHR. The reduction of lck and fyn was prevented by adrenalectomy of the recipients, and a similar reduction could be induced in normal (non-GVH-reactive) mice by an injection of exogenous cortisone. These findings suggested that the GVHR-induced elevation in endogenous glucocorticoid levels could trigger the decrease of T cell lck and fyn, resulting in a T cell signalling defect during GVHR. In fact, we have demonstrated that glucocorticoids induced a decrease in lck and fyn in T cell clones in vitro. Thus, it appeared that the early GVHR-induced T cell unresponsiveness was due to the glucocorticoid-dependent downregulation of T cell lck and fyn. We have investigated changes in T cell maturation and selection in the GVHR-dysplastic thymus, which may account for the persistent immune abnormalities of chronic GVHR. Thymocyte TCR expression and usage were aberrant during GVHR; changes included decreased expression of CD3 on CD4$ sp+$8 thymocytes, inconsistent TCR V$ beta$ usage, and appearance of phenotypically autoreactive mature thymocytes. These abnormalities, suggestive of defective positive and negative selection, are likely to result from the GVHR-induced decrease in thymic class II MHC expression. Altered T cell education may lead to the long-term peripheral T cell defects observed in chronic GVHR. Lastly, we report that GVHR-induced cutaneous injury was exacerbated by irradiation of the target tissue, suggesting that in clinical GVHR, irradiation may intensify tissue damage, including thymic epithelial lesions; this could potentially lead to more serious alterations in thymic function, and thus to longer lasting, more severe peripheral T cell immune deficiency.</description><creator>Desbarats, Julie</creator><contributor>Lapp, W.

Among the 3,484 women screened, 11.8 percent were eligible for enrollment and 77.3 percent agreed to participate. The follow-up rate was 94 per cent. Data on predictor variables were collected during face-to-face interviews in the early postpartum period. Follow-up telephone interviews occurred at three months postpartum to assess infant-care behaviours. Using a chunkwise, hierarchial approach to multiple linear regression modelling, maternal and infant predictors accounted for 24.2 percent of the variance in the 'Infant-care Behaviours' Score. In the second stage of model building, ethnocultural variables explained an additional 5.8 percent of the variance. Separate analyses for women who had lived in Canada less than three years versus three or more years yielded some differences in predictors for women in the two strata. Among recent immigrants; worries about the infant's health, mother's education, and current immigration status by parity were significant predictors, explaining 23 percent of the variance. Among less recent immigrants; worries about the baby's health, prenatal class attendance, marital status, and official language comprehension ability explained 37.7 percent of the variance. To establish effectiveness of the hospital liaison referral process, data from the predictors' study were linked with records of public health postpartum follow-up. Sensitivity of the hospital liaison referral process was less than 55 percent. Study findings provide direction for strengthening the postpartum referral process for ethnically diverse immigrants. The significant predictor variables are readily identified by the hospital staff of postpartum units. Results illustrate the importance of assessing theory-based ethnocultural characteristics among immigrants to determine their 'at-risk' status.</description><creator>Edwards, Nancy C.</creator><contributor>Boivin, Jean Francois (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1995</date><subject>Sociology, Ethnic and Racial Studies.</subject><subject>Health Sciences, Public Health.</subject><subject>Sociology, Individual and Family Studies.</subject><subject>Psychology, Social.</subject><title>Predictors of infant-care behaviours among postnatal immigrants</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sj139396d.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/b2773x64t</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:76537298k</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:54:08Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The study of cognitive representations and processes involved in personal pronoun interpretation allows one to investigate on a small scale the cognitive representations and processes of discourse comprehension. A review of the literature identifies four fundamental processes in personal pronoun interpretation: (A) syntactic constrains application, (B) gender, number, and person matching, (C) inferential selection, and, (D) discourse focus updating. A preliminary data collection from human performance has shown the importance of the application of syntactic constrains for pronoun interpretation. However, the level of specification for the representations and processes attained by the literature review and the preliminary experiment is not sufficient, therefore justifying the development of a more elaborate on-line pronoun interpretation process model. In order to attain a better model of the personal pronoun interpretation processes, the research approach has been to: (A) establish a strong link between the text linguistic features on one hand, and the cognitive representations and processes on the other hand through the construction-interpretation model, and (B) to reduce the gap between the experimental task specificity, and the general cognitive representations and processes assumed by the model. A second experiment, using experimental texts implementing a combination of many levels of representation, verified most of the model predictions. The model of the four interpretation processes as well as the empirical evidences support a point of view where the interpretation process for personal pronouns ends at various points during reading. The compound process of syntactic analysis and progressive semantic interpretation as well as the component processes associated with specific levels of representation explain the partiality of the pronoun interpretation process.

This effect on porosity is due to an increase in both the pore size and the pore number density. In an attempt to understand the nature of this problem, the effect of strontium on the probable causes for porosity occurrence due to modification has been investigated. Experimental findings indicate that the addition of strontium to Al-Si alloys increases the volumetric shrinkage due to an increase in solid density, and at the same time reduces the surface tension and increases the viscosity of the liquid. Metallographic observations show that Sr addition slightly decreases the dendrite arm spacing and changes the solid-liquid interface to a more regular shape. Moreover, Sr-modification decreases the eutectic temperature, and therefore, increases the length of the mushy zone while the total solidification time remains constant. In addition, Sr addition increases the melt inclusion content, but these inclusions do not have a significant effect on pore nucleation. Hydrogen measurement in the liquid shows that Sr-modification has no effect on the rate of melt hydrogen pick-up and does not introduce hydrogen into the melt. Strontium also reduces the hydrogen solubility in the liquid state but has virtually no effect on the solid state solubility. A solidification model for pore formation has been developed to study the significance of the changes in these parameters on porosity formation. Based on the experimental results and the theoretical analysis, it is concluded that the decrease in the hydrogen solubility in the liquid, the eutectic temperature (or the length of the mushy zone) and the surface tension are the reasons for the observed increase in porosity in modified alloys. Among these parameters, the decrease in the hydrogen solubility in the liquid plays the main role in causing enhanced porosity formation.</description><creator>Emadi, Daryoush</creator><contributor>Gruzieski, J.

The aim of this thesis was to expand upon these observations and solidify the link between DNA repair and nitrogen mustard drug resistance. Contrary to our expectations, overexpression of ERCC-1 in CHO cells produced increased sensitivity to melphalan and cisplatin. No correlation was found between ERCC-1 expression and nitrogen mustard resistance in B-CLL, when analyzed in a larger cohort by both Northern and western blots, nor was there evidence of altered expression of a second nucleotide excision repair gene (NER), ERCC-2. Overexpression of alkyl-N-purine DNA glycosylase in CHO cells failed to produce melphalan resistance. Nitrogen mustard resistant B-CLL lymphocytes displayed cross-resistance to the bifunctional agents, mitomycin C and cisplatin, but not to UV or methyl methanesulfonate, supporting a role for enhanced crosslink repair in the resistant phenotype. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) has been identified as a binding protein which can recognize melphalan damaged DNA. This binding appears to result from nicks induced by the melphalan treatment and can be inhibited if the DNA is alkylated with melphalan in the presence of methoxyamine. PARP expression was the same in both sensitive and resistant lymphocytes. When 3-aminobenzamide was used to inhibit PARP, synergy with melphalan was found in 4 of 7 samples we studied. When the DNA synthesis inhibitors, aphidicolin and ara-C, were used to modulate chlorambucil toxicity, synergy was found in both sensitive and resistant populations. There was also evidence for cross-resistance between chlorambucil and ara-C. Thus, our studies indicate that nitrogen mustard resistance in B-CLL correlates with enhanced activity of a crosslink specific repair process. The observation that nitrogen mustard resistance in B-CLL is associated with cross-resistance to mitomycin C, cisplatin and ara-C, through a mechanism other than P-glycoprotein or glutathione, suggests that this model may represent a novel multi-drug resistant phenotype.</description><creator>Bramson, Jonathan</creator><contributor>Panasci, L.

The zonal mean circulation is specified using observed January mean data, as is the wave structure at the lower boundary of 100 hPa. Experiments are performed using data from four years, 1982-84 and 1986. Numerical solutions are found for the structures of zonal wavenumbers 1 to 3 throughout the Northern Hemisphere stratosphere. In one series of experiments, a linear model is employed, with forcing only by stationary waves at the lower boundary. This model reproduces the gross features of the stratospheric stationary waves, but the wave amplitudes are much less than those observed in nature. In a second series of experiments, the January means of the transient vorticity and heat flux divergences are calculated using observed data, and applied as an additional forcing term in the model, along with the lower boundary forcing. The model yields significantly larger wave amplitudes, closer to those observed in nature, when forcing by transients is included. In a third series of experiments, a model which includes the nonlinear interactions among the stationary waves is employed, with forcing only by the waves at the lower boundary. This yields somewhat better results than the linear model, but the change in the wave structure due to the inclusion of nonlinear interactions among the stationary waves is smaller than that due to the inclusion of forcing by transients. The ability of the model to reproduce the observed features of the monthly mean stratospheric circulation varies greatly, depending on the year studied.</description><creator>Box, Thomas Charles</creator><contributor>Derome, Jacques (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1994</date><subject>Physics, Atmospheric Science.</subject><title>A nonlinear model of stationary planetary waves in the northern hemisphere stratosphere</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8p58pf88j.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5q47rq65z</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:7p88cj56m</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:54:09Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This dissertation considers the relation between culture and communication with respect to the development of aboriginal media in Canada. It introduces and elaborates a concept of cultural politics with which to interpret the history of contact between aboriginal and non-aboriginal people. This concept is further applied to an analysis of Canadian cultural and communications policy and the intervention of native broadcasters in policy procedures and discourses. The dissertation undertakes a critical review of existing research on aboriginal media. It assesses the usefulness of interpretive tools drawn from poststructuralist philosophy, ethnography and postcolonial theory in understanding the relation between cultural politics and communication practices. These tools are then implemented in the presentation of a case study of Wawatay Native Communications Society, a regional native broadcasting organization based in Northwestern Ontario.</description><creator>Bredin, Marian</creator><contributor>Burnett, Ron (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1995</date><subject>Politics and culture -- Canada</subject><subject>Indian mass media -- Canada</subject><subject>Communication and culture -- Canada</subject><title>Aboriginal media in Canada : cultural politics and communication practices</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pk02cc81h.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7p88cj56m</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Graduate Communications Program</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:nc580p48b</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:54:10Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The classical approach to shape from shading problems is to find a numerical solution of the image irradiance partial differential equation. It is usually assumed that the parameters of this equation (the light source direction and surface albedo) can be estimated in advance. For images which contain shadows and occluding contours, this decoupling of problems is artificial and the classical approach fails. We develop a new approach to solving these equations using the image geometric structures instead of the image photometric structure. Our approach is based on modern differential geometry, and solves for light source and surface shape changes concurrently. Local scene elements (scenels) are estimated from the shading flow field and the tangent field, and smoothness, material, and light source compatibility conditions resolve them to consistent scene descriptions. Shadows and related difficulties for the classical approach are discussed.</description><creator>Breton, Pierre</creator><contributor>Zucker, Steven W.

In turn, an investigation into the effect that sorption/desorption has on the bioavailability of these organic compounds and their mineralization kinetics was conducted. The non-polar naphthalene, the slightly polar quinoxaline and the three nitronaphthalene compounds sorbed through hydrophobic interaction giving rise to linear sorption isotherms that are typical of partitioning processes in which organic matter functions as a partition medium. Amino-naphthalenes, being polar and slightly basic, adsorbed through cation exchange, hydrogen bonding and formed coordination complexes at soil organic and mineral matter surfaces. Quinoline and isoquinoline, due to their relatively high dipole moment, intercalated the interlamellar space of layered-soil minerals. However, quinoline did not exhibit a specific type of interaction in the interlamellar region, while isoquinoline molecules adsorbed specifically, probably through surface protonation or coordinate covalent bonding with metal ions, and produced micelles upon sorption between the basal planes of clay particles. The discrepancy between the sorption behavior of quinoline and that of isoquinoline is attributed, in part, to the stronger hygroscopic nature of the former compound, its lower acidity constant and to the asymmetric shape of its molecules. The desorption behaviors of naphthalene and 1-nitro-2-methylnaphthalene, both yielding concave up desorption isotherms, show a readily reversible component that gradually gives way to an irreversible one. The -CH$ sb3$ group, in the case of 1-nitro-2-methylnaphthalene, reduced hysteresis which is attributed to an increase in the hydrophobicity of the molecule and the steric effect that the methyl substitution has on hydrogen bonding. Desorption of quinoline and isoquinoline followed a hysteresis loop (concave down desorption isotherm) such that reversibility increased with decreasing soluble concentrations in the aqueous phase. Amino-naphthalenes adsorbed irreversibly at soil surfaces which is suggestive of strong interaction forces resembling those of a chemical reaction. The mineralization of all studied compounds gave rise to hyperbolic mineralization curves comprising two phases; an initial fast one followed by a second slow phase with gradually declining rates. Quinoline maximum mineralization rates were first order with respect to soluble concentrations and the amounts of quinoline mineralized initially coincided with the soluble fraction. In contrast, the amounts of isoqoinoline mineralized during the fast phase exceeded its corresponding fractions in solution. Mineralization exhibited saturation-type kinetics (Michaelis-Menten type) which probably indicates that the biodegradation of isoquinoline was mediated by its sorption in the micellar form. Finally, naphthalene maximum mineralization rates correlated linearly with total concentrations (soluble and sorbed) and the total amounts mineralized during the fast phase exceeded substantially the soluble fraction.

This thesis assesses the institutional and legal contributions of the satellite services to civil aviation. This thesis is divided into three parts. Part I sets the scene by giving the reader a brief look at the technical side of the current air navigation system. Chapter I explores the current system's deficiencies and Chapter II explains the framework of selected existing aeronautical and general operating satellite systems and institutions. Part II deals with the prospective long-range needs of air navigation.

Schools of pollock moved from the subtidal zone to the open habitat in the intertidal zone. On rising tides, pollock switched from the open habitat at low tidal stages to the dense algal habitat at high tidal stages. On falling tides, pollock rapidly schooled downshore in the open habitat. Pollock were rarely solitary in the open habitat and usually formed large schools. In the algal habitats, pollock were usually dispersed and preferred the dense algae over the sparse algae. Predation risk from birds was widely distributed among depths, habitats and stages of the tide, during the day. In a mesocosm experiment, pollock increased their use of the algal habitat and were more difficult to detect following a simulated bird predator threat. Preference for the algal habitat was density-dependent when either pollock abundance or algal habitat area were manipulated. Pollock responded to their potentially high density in the algae by schooling in the open habitat.</description><creator>Rangeley, Robert W. (Robert William)</creator><contributor>Krumer, D. L.

The works of Nietzsche's middle period are studied--Human, All too Human (1879), and Daybreak (1881) and The Gay Science (1882). The study argues that reading Nietzsche as a descendant of and dissenter from the moralist tradition sheds new light on his thought and brings certain concepts into focus. The key concepts and questions explored are: morality, egoism, vanity and self-love, pity and its cognate emotions, friendship, aristocracy, honour, women, marriage and gender relations. Throughout the dissertation the impact that reading the moralists had on Nietzsche's style is also examined. It is argued that a concern with justice is the 'basso continuo' of the middle period, continuously present and working itself out in the background of these texts. Furthermore, one of the innovative ways Nietzsche expresses this concern is via spatial metaphors.</description><creator>Abbey, Ruth</creator><contributor>Taylor, Charles (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1994</date><subject>La Rochefoucauld, François, duc de, 1613-1680</subject><subject>Nietzsche, Friedrich Wilhelm, 1844-1900</subject><subject>Chamfort, Sébastien-Roch-Nicolas, 1740?-1794</subject><title>Descent and dissent : Nietzsche's reading of two French moralists</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0r967567w.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qf85nd03q</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Political Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:6108vd41d</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:54:11Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>A topochemical model has been derived to account for the diverse selectivity of cyclic opioid peptides related to enkephalins and for narcotic alkaloids towards the $ mu$ and $ delta$ opiate subclasses. Efforts toward demonstrating its validity have later been accomplished. The model is based on a computer molecular modeling study using the opiate pharmacophore as a minimum prerequisite to align the molecules and benefit also of informations obtained from spectroscopic study in solution concerning the macrocycles conformation. The conformational properties of N$ sp alpha$Cbz-c((D)A$ sb2$Bu-Gly-Phe-Leu) were studied by nuclear Overhauser effect which provided semi-quantitative internuclear distances. One of the important elements that the model brings out is that the eventual presence of an aromatic ring on the beta carbon of Cys of the opioid peptide HTyr-(D)Pen-Gly-Phe-Cys-NH$ sb2$ should induce an increase in selectivity toward the 6 opiate subclass. Consequently, we engaged in preparing the special amino acid, P-phenylcysteine, using a method based on the addition of mercaptan to unsaturated azlactone. The diastereoisomers obtained were separated, and their relative configurations assigned by X-ray crystallography. The pure enantiomers were obtained by resolution with the enzyme carboxypeptidase A. Several difficulties were encountered during this preparation, the main concern being the S protecting group. This protecting group should be chosen with the property that it can be quantitatively removed when desired and compatible with the conditions of peptides synthesis. Moreover, the size of the protecting group should be minimized in order to be able to realize the resolution with the enzyme. We explored, by the same token, the size of the hydrophobic pocket of the exopeptidase. Using the structural information obtained from the X-Ray diffraction study of several of the $ beta$-phenycysteine, we have determined with the help of computer molecular modeling, the</description><creator>Villeneuve, Gérald Blaise</creator><contributor>Chan, Tak Hang (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1994</date><subject>Chemistry, Pharmaceutical.</subject><title>Ligands synthesis and conformational studies for the investigation of opiate and protease receptor sites</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/th83m132p.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6108vd41d</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Chemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:fx719p19k</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:54:12Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The respiratory muscles play a role in respiratory failure when the efficient performance of the work of ventilation and/or their supply of metabolic substrates is disrupted. In this report a model of inspiratory muscle action is presented. The inflationary pressure applied to the lungs and the lung apposed rib cage is partitioned into two parts. One component is attributable to the action of rib cage muscles and the other is due to the interaction between upper and lower rib cage compartments. These contributions were found to be equal. The role of afferent impulses travelling in the phrenic nerve in the control of respiratory muscle activity was investigated by electrical stimulation of its central cut end. Activation of these fibres exerts a non-uniform effect on the activities of the upper airway, rib cage and abdominal muscles and may influence respiratory muscle recruitment. The roles of blood flow and oxygen delivery in determining diaphragm function was investigated. The rate at which diaphragmatic fatigue develops is diminished at high rates of blood flow and this effect is not related to the associated increase in oxygen delivery. The critical oxygen delivery at which oxygen consumption becomes supply dependent is the same for the resting diaphragm as for the rest of the body tissues. Activation of the diaphragm results in a higher critical oxygen delivery, however, this effect is mitigated by an increase in the critical oxygen extraction ratio. The role of nitric oxide in regulating diaphragmatic blood flow and oxygen uptake was investigated by infusion of N$ sp{G}$-nitro-L-arginine. This treatment increased diaphragmatic vascular resistance, reduced the duration and magnitude of reactive vasodilation and increased the oxygen consumption and critical extraction ratio in the contracting diaphragm.</description><creator>Ward, Michael Edward</creator><contributor>Macklem, P.

Moreover, it examines and compares the influence of parental ethnicity, SES and level of education on the parental-offspring type agreement in immigrant and non-immigrant families. Finally, it explores the role of child's gender on the parent-offspring type agreement. Data were collected through the administration of (1) The Vocational Preference Inventory (VPI, revised) (Holland, 1985b), and (2) The Personal Data Questionnaire (PDQ) (developed by the researcher) to high school and college students. The immigrant sample consisted of 100 Canadian-born children of Greek-born immigrants to Canada. The non-immigrant sample consisted of 80 children of Canadian-born, Anglophone parents. The results revealed: (a) no significantly high agreement between Parental and Offspring Typology in either ethnic group; (b) no significant influence of parental ethnicity, SES or level of education on the Parent-Offspring Type agreement in either ethnic group; (c) significant influence of offspring's gender on the Parent-Offspring Type agreement, which is higher for the male than the female offspring, in both ethnic groups. The above results do not validate Holland's (1985a) propositions that parental types produce similar vocational types of offspring in immigrant or non-immigrant families. Yet, it was found that parents do influence offspring's vocational choices, in ways that need to be further studied with larger samples of different ethnic populations.</description><creator>Tsakanika, Monika Domenica</creator><contributor>Hum, Andrew (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1994</date><subject>Children of immigrants</subject><subject>Vocational interests</subject><title>Family influences on the development of vocational interests in adolescent children of immigrants : a test of Holland's propositions regarding occupational type development</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/w3763896n.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4f16c457t</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:8623j085c</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:54:13Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis examines the history of the Mi'kmaq people inhabiting Kmitkinag (Nova Scotia) and Unimaki (Cape Breton Island) from before contact to 1760. While contact precipitated change in Mi'kmaq society, the process was gradual, the result of the particular historical circumstances in which interactions between the two societies evolved. In the late seventeenth century, the Mi'kmaq established an alliance with the French Crown, made possible by previous social and economic relationships between Mi'kmaq families and French traders, fishermen and settlers. As European settlement increased and imperial rivalry in North America intensified in the eighteenth century, tensions emerged in the alliance, revealing the cultural differences between the Mi'kmaq and France's subjects. The thesis demonstrates that economic and political factors were more important than national identity in influencing the texture of Mi'kmaq-European relations.</description><creator>Wicken, William C.

Based on this analysis, directions of propagation are classified as symmetric or asymmetric. An augmented scalar transmission line circuit model which contains a new lumped network element that accounts for asymmetry is introduced to describe SAW reflection and transmission through a strip. The resulting network model is used to analyze grating and transducer structures. Computed results based on this new network model are in excellent agreement with measured data, not only on devices oriented along symmetric directions, but also on devices which exhibit directivity due to asymmetric orientations. A simple procedure, based on physical arguments, is outlined for the identification of high directivity orientations. An algebraic construction is given which demonstrates that the coupling-of-modes (COM) modelling of gratings and transducers is derivable from the new network model. Approximate explicit analytical expressions, in terms of the network model, are given for the COM model parameters. The properties of pseudo-surface-waves are re-examined and a new high-velocity pseudo-surface acoustic wave (HVPSAW) is described. It is shown that this mode, not referenced in the SAW device literature, has a low attenuation along certain directions, and is thus very attractive for high-frequency low-loss SAW devices.</description><creator>Pereira da Cunha, Maurício</creator><contributor>Adler, Eric L.

The scheme is based on decoupled linear impedance models of the robot and its environment, in which the errors due to control inaccuracy, task frame estimation, as well as environment uncertainty are accounted for. The technique consists of characterizing the position, velocity and force responses of the robot/environment system, and expressing the task goals as inequality constraints on these expressions. The impedance parameters and input trajectories of the robot controller are found by fitting a parametric uncertainty box inside the region of the parameter space that satisfies all task constraints. The box is tested for validity by comparing the response values at each of its vertices to the desired goal values, and also by verifying that it does not cross any of the frontiers that separate the eigenvalue-space in box-convex regions. A software package called Commotion has been developed which implements this methodology and searches for a set of robot impedance parameters that can perform a given task robustly. Four different task examples are presented in which the validity and usefulness of the proposed approach are demonstrated. Three of these examples have been implemented experimentally, and show the practicality of the method.</description><creator>Pelletier, Michel, 1964-</creator><contributor>Daneshmend, Laeeque K.

Level of egocentrism and social perspective-taking coordination were assessed in a group of 49 maltreated and 49 demographically matched nonmaltreated children. Twenty-six elementary and 23 high school students in each group are individually interviewed and their responses to hypothetical interpersonal situations coded for egocentricity and level of perspective-taking ability. The findings revealed that the maltreated students were more egocentric and delayed in their perspective-taking development at both the elementary and high school level. Maltreated elementary school children with higher levels of egocentrism were more likely than their less egocentric peers to report higher perceived social competence and self-worth. Theoretical implications, within the context of an organic-developmental approach, and implications for future research and clinical interventions are discussed.</description><creator>Peled, Terry</creator><contributor>Burack, J.

The thesis examines the rhetoric by which Watson's novel has been read as central to and representative of Canada's literary cultural maturity. That maturity has been measured by such modernist formal principles as the objective correlative and the mythical method, formalist standards and tastes valorized by New Criticism and by the synchronic mythographies of Freudian psychoanalysis, structuralist anthropology, and structuralist literary criticism (such as Frye's mythopoeics). The thesis argues that a structural mechanism of sacrifice is central to the literary critical narrative about this novel; that the myth-making by which violence becomes sacred and thereby marks the establishment, redemption, or survival of culture, is founded specifically on the sacrifice of women in The Double Hook.</description><creator>Pennee, Donna</creator><contributor>Lecker, Robert (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1994</date><subject>Watson, Sheila, 1909- Double hook</subject><subject>Women in literature</subject><title>Femicide in the critical construction of The Double hook : a case study in the interrelations of modernism, literary nationalism, and cultural maturity</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vq27zq47j.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/q237ht72x</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of English</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:1544br40k</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:54:14Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis is about a problem of interest to reading theorists, psychological anthropologists and cultural studies researchers alike: why we find some narratives, plots, and images compelling and what this phenomenon can tell us about the cultural bases of human motivation. Gesturing to the interdependence of emotion, cognition, and motivation, the notion of the '(dis)positioned self' is proposed as a conceptual tool by which to address how motivation is both acquired and expressed in the way the self as 'feeling-mind' reads, that is, negotiates an interpretation of the signifying systems of a text to render it personally meaningful. (Dis)position allows us to overcome the sociocultural determinism of French structuralist and some poststructuralist reductions of the self to a precipitate of cultural constructs by reconceptualizing the interpreting self as an embodied, affective agent who employs unconscious knowledge that itself draws on another form of sociality. On this account, reading performance is culturally informed action and interpretations are motivated. Emotion is introduced as symptomatic of the intrapsychic investments which mediate how readers internalize cultural knowledge. The thesis looks at three soundings from social discourse--Janice Radway's Reading the Romance; The Singing Detective, a contemporary metafictional text; and the literature and group therapy practices associated with the codependency movement--in order to examine how presuppositions about emotion and the psychical reality of fantasy appear in cultural representations of the 'ill self as reader' while being fundamental to psychological notions of the self upon which healing practices themselves depend for their efficacy.</description><creator>Biggs, Karen L.

For reinforcing bars, the new technique, which simulates a more uniform bond stress, enabled the study of both pullout failures and splitting failures. Variables studied included concrete cover, bar size and the effect of epoxy coatings on the bars. Analytical expressions for predicting the bond stress versus slip response and the bond stress distribution for different types of pullout tests are developed. For pretensioned strand, the testing technique enabled the study of the bond characteristics along both the transfer and the flexural bond lengths. Equations for predicting the transfer and development lengths are given. The tensile behaviour of concrete members reinforced with a single reinforcing bar are studied. Variables studied included concrete strength, presence of steel fibres, bar size and the effect of epoxy coatings on the bars. Both transverse cracks and splitting cracks were studied and a factor accounting for the influence of splitting cracks on tension stiffening is introduced. A procedure for predicting the response of tension members, accounting for the concrete cover and bar size and the presence of steel fibres is given. Equations are suggested to determine the transfer length and crack spacing. Experimental investigations were carried out to study the post-cracking behaviour of beams without stirrups. The influence of concrete strength and the presence of epoxy-coated reinforcement on the crack development, type of cracking, ductility and failure mechanism are discussed. Typical slab-column connections found in parking structures were tested, simulating the construction stages. The effects on crack development of both concrete quality and the presence of epoxy coatings on the reinforcement were studied. Modification factors for predicting crack widths in beams and two-way slabs, accounting for the presence of epoxy coatings, are given in a form suitable for implementation in codes of practice.</description><creator>Abrishami, Homayoun H.

It is applicable to tracing contaminant migration from underground storage tanks and waste disposal sites. The proposed approach involves adaptation of the time-domain reflectometry (TDR) concept and relies on the interraction of matter with an electric field. Analysis of the TDR data collected from soil-contaminant mixtures indicates the feasibility of a subsurface contaminant detection. The proposed contaminant detection technique relies on matching an unknown TDR waveform with a number of known waveforms stored in a computerized database. The analysis is performed in the frequency-domain through the use of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). It is proposed that the matching process utilize the coherence function. Application of the proposed technique requires a signal generator, a digital waveform recorder, a portable computer, and a coaxial cable terminated with a soil probe. The main advantage of the proposed system is the capability of on site analysis, thus reducing the time and the expense associated with the subsurface contaminant detection and delineation.</description><creator>Hoppe, Edward J.

We demonstrate the robustness of Hawking's prediction of black-hole evaporation, by carrying out an explicit calculation, in which short-distance physics is explicitly regularized using the Pauli-Villars regularization scheme. We find that short-distance effects due to physics at small distance scales, 1/$ Lambda gg 1/T sb{H}$, where 1/$ Lambda$ is a covariantly chosen short-distance cutoff, can only contribute to the Hawking flux an amount that is exponentially suppressed by the large ratio $ Lambda$/$T sb{H}$. We argue further that this behavior is not specific to our choice of regularization, but is a generic feature of any covariant short-distance regularization. We do so by showing that no possible covariant and local counterterm exists which can contribute to the Hawking flux at late times far from the hole.</description><creator>Hambli, Noureddine</creator><contributor>Burgess, C.
