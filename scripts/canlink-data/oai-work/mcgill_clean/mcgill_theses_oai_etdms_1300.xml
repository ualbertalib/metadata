My thesis is a study of how this cultural formation has been figured and refigured since the Second World War through a historical and discursive analysis of West Coast Style. This cultural study focuses on how the term West Coast Style circulates and shifts meaning in relationship to a variety of domestic architectures such as the suburban single-family dwelling and more urban types like the coop, condominium and high rise. In addition, I consider how West Coast Style has been configured in debates about architectural modernism and postmodernism, Canadian cultural nationalism, and in newly emerging civic, global, and transnational geo-political, economic and cultural networks.</description><creator>Shaw, Nancy (Nancy Alison), 1962-</creator><contributor>Straw, Will (advisor)</contributor><date>1995</date><subject>Architecture, Domestic -- British Columbia -- Pacific Coast</subject><subject>Lifestyles -- British Columbia -- Pacific Coast</subject><subject>Architecture -- British Columbia -- Pacific Coast -- 20th century.</subject><title>West coast style : modern homes and lifestyles in Canada, 1945-1995</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bv73c262h.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/s7526f365</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Graduate Communications Program</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:qn59q6247</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:06:07Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis studies the theory of istihsan, an aspect of Islamic legal reasoning, as a method for ascertaining the legal norm in cases where qiyas dictates an overly strict ruling. The study primarily focuses on the concept presented by Ibn Taymiyya (d. 728/1328), a prominent Muslim theologian, philosopher, sufi and outstanding jurist. Placed in the context of later development, Ibn Taymiyya's theory proposes both a criticism and reformulation of the Hanafi school's perception of istihsan. Having observed previous formulations, Ibn Taymiyya sees this theory as being understood as an arbitrary contradiction to qiyas. Although attempts to redefine the theory, through rigorous definition and well-calculated application were conducted by later Hanafi jurists, criticism from other schoools continued unabated. To this effect, Ibn Taymiyya's contribution emerges as an alternative solution. In order to fully understand istihsan, Ibn Taymiyya contends that one must determine particularization of the cause (takhsid s al-'illa). By doing this, istihsan and qiyas can be easily distinguished. He, thus, perceives istihsan as takhsid s al-'illa. Unlike the Hanafis, Ibn Taymiyya does not juxtapose istihsan against qiyas sahid h. He argues that if there is a contradiction, it must be proved by a decisive descrepancy (farq mu'aththir) provided by the law giver. Furthermore, when qiyas produces an unsatisfactory legal norm, takhsid s al-'illa represents a viable alternative. Above all, Ibn Taymiyya contends that istihsan must be supported by the revealed texts, consensus or necessity.</description><creator>Shaleh, Ahmad Syukri</creator><contributor>Hallaq, Wael B.

Muhammad Husayn Tabataba'i, a modern Muslim scholar who was an expert in both Islamic philosophy and Qur'anic interpretation, developed new approaches to such issues as the role of human rational ability, logic and philosophy in religious knowledge. Furthermore he deals with such specific controversial topics on the subject of revelation and reason as, social freedom and freedom of thought and belief in Islam. He tends to elaborate his view of freedom based on both the Qur'an and rational bases.

The importance of these works lies in the fact that the author was an erudite scholar and a respected leader of the Basra School of the Mu'tazila, and also because his Mughni/ is considered by many as the Encyclopedia of Mu'tazilite philosophy. As a Mu'tazilite, 'Abd al-Jabbar demonstrates the inimitability of the Qur'an in the light of both his doctrine of mu'jiza (the apologetic miracle of a prophet) and khalq al-Qur'an (the createdness of the Qur'an). This thesis argues that although his theory of mu'jiza is incredibly similar to that of the Ash'arites, 'Abd al-Jabbar's rendering of it and his main sources are not the Ash'arites but rather the "School of Jubba'i" Besides demonstrating the Qur'anic inimitability through kalam, 'Abd al-Jabbar also discusses its unsurpassable nature, in terms of the Holy Book's literary uniqueness, fasaha. This argument is distinctly different from the theories of his predecessors. As such, the thesis examines his predecessors' and contemporaries' works on i'jaz in order to shed light on the peculiarity of 'Abd al-Jabbar's theory.</description><creator>Rahman, Yusuf, 1967-</creator><contributor>Boullata, Issa J.

Presently, with 15 plays to her name, she holds an important place in women's theatre in Quebec and in Quebecois theatre in general. Not only is Marie Laberge a successful playwright, she is also a novelist. This work examines the feminist ideas and the female experience as presented in Marie Laberge's plays and novels. Initially, the important themes of women's theatre in Quebec and Marie Laberge's position and role within this movement will be explored. The dominant themes of the feminist movement in Quebec since 1970 will be highlighted. The concept chronotope, defined by the Russian theorist Mikhail Bakhtine, will be employed in the thesis to assist with the evaluation of the female experience. Three periods of Marie Laberge's work will be defined as feminist action, moderated feminism and absence of feminism. To properly study these three phases, one text from each, which best represents the ideas of that period, will be analyzed in detail. Once the ideas relevant to this study are exposed, they will be explored in relation to the other works in each phase and to the feminist movement in Quebec during the same period. In conclusion, the growth of the feminism in Marie Laberge's work will be summarized and compared to the feminist movement in Quebec and its evolution.</description><creator>Pilon, Simone</creator><contributor>Smith, Andre (advisor)</contributor><date>1995</date><subject>Laberge, Marie, 1950- -- Criticism and interpretation</subject><subject>Feminism in literature</subject><title>L' évolution du féminisme dans l'oeuvre de Marie Laberge</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7w62fb45k.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/jm214r20v</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Département de langue et littérature françaises</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:z029p6798</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:06:10Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The idea explored in this thesis is that the Reverie is a distinct literary genre, which found its birth with the realization of the Reveries du Promeneur solitaire by Jean-Jacques Rousseau. The analysis of that text suggests that the literary Reverie is defined by the thoughts it contains about language's power to reflect reality accurately. In this context, Rousseau's book appears to be a place of experimentation in which the author attempts to capture his inner self and the world that surrounds him, as precisely as possible. The notion of referent plays a key role in this study. It is by observing the way Rousseau uses referents of different natures, that we will be able to understand Reverie as a literary genre. We start our study by attempting to define the Reverie as a genre. We then compare it to other literary genres with which it shares similarities. In the following sections, we analyze both the internal and external referents present in Rousseau's text. Nature, people, memories and imagination are some of the referents we consider. We finally observe some referents that are both internal and external. This leads us to understand how Rousseau tries to convey a "total referent" through his Reveries.</description><creator>Perrault, Isabelle, 1968-</creator><contributor>Terrasse, Jean (advisor)</contributor><date>1995</date><subject>Rousseau, Jean-Jacques, 1712-1778.

And if so, can we identify the specific psychological issues that were considered to be most significant and unique across the stages of the HIV/AIDS continuum? To test these research questions, 37 homosexual men falling in three specific stages of the infection were surveyed. These three stages included: (1) HIV+ asymptomatic, (2) HIV+ chronic symptomatic, and (3) AIDS diagnosis. The HIV/AIDS Client Concern (HACC) questionnaire was developed to assess the significance clients placed on certain psychological issues and, was administered to all the subjects. The statistical analyses revealed that clients' level of diagnosis influenced how much emphasis they placed on what they considered to be significant psychological issues. More specifically, clients in the asymptotic group reported a higher concern with issues surrounding confidentiality of their HIV/AIDS status than the AIDS diagnosis group. The chronic symptomatic group, on the other hand, was significantly more concerned with issues regarding feelings of guilt/shame, shock, depression, fear, loneliness, and anxiety of infecting other people through casual contact than the other groups. In addition, the AIDS diagnosis group was most concerned with issues surrounding the planning of their future care in comparison with the asymptomatic group. A more detailed analysis of each questions' content and its significance as well as the implications such results have for both researchers and practitioners alike will be discussed.</description><creator>Paraskevopoulos, Angelo</creator><contributor>Stalikas, A.

The data used in this study was gathered from face-to-face interviews with 159 male prisoners randomly selected from three separate Canadian federal correctional facilities between August 1993 and May 1994. A punishment severity scale was developed based on respondents' perceptions of various legal sanctions. Subgroups of the overall sample were examined and differences in severity ratings were observed based on a number of socio-demographic variables and variations in one's relationship and experience with the criminal justice system. This research also provides a comparison to studies which examined sentence severity among various court officials, the public and students.

Ijma' according to him, is not a matter of truth or falseness, as it has been viewed by the classical and medieval jurists, but rather it is a mechanism which must demonstrate a dynamic ability in dealing with new problems on the basis of the public interest (maslaha). In order to obtain a proper public interest in any matter, religious considerations alone are not sufficient, rather each matter must be considered from many different angles and disciplines such as sociology, the environment and politics. One should also take into consideration the fact that ijma' is not only an informal decision, as has the case after the Rashidun caliphate period, but that it has become part of the legal system of government and as such demands obedience from everybody. Not surprisingly, 'Abduh believed that ijma' should be carried out and regulated by the elected members of parliament. This thesis not only analyses the thoughts of Muhammad 'Abduh on this matter but also includes the thoughts of classical and medieval jurist, as well as the view of modern scholars such as Muhammad Iqbal, Kemal A.

The correlation is tested by the female farm labour participation (FLP) rate and the juvenile sex ratio (JSR). I examine the correlation between women's contribution to agriculture and their status in wet paddy and dry millet regions in Tamil Nadu. Compared to northwestern India, the JSRs are more balanced and FLPs are high in both regions, yet the implications of high FLPs differ. Thanjavur shows a high female labour participation in peak seasons, but year-round underemployment. In Kongu, the cultivation of garden crops requires both male and female labour throughout the year.

The thesis argues that Thompson's contribution to communication theory lies in his development of one of the first successful attempts to integrate the strong orientation to meaning provided by interpretative theories into a comprehensive framework linking the situated interpretations of mediated communications to the idiosyncrasies of social ordering. Building on an evaluation of Ideology and Modern Culture's conceptual design, including its re-working of antecedents within communication, social and political theories, the thesis situates Thompson's project within the context of a post-interpretative turn concerned with the relevance and consequences of interpretation. In commenting on some initial limitations and weaknesses in this developing perspective, the thesis critically examines the dangers of over-emphasizing the significance of the interpretation of mediated meanings for the development of forms of action and for the construction of consequences.</description><creator>Motyka, Susan</creator><contributor>Crowley, David (advisor)</contributor><date>1995</date><subject>Mass media -- Social aspects</subject><subject>Thompson, John B.

Moreover, historians have relied on Thomas Roe's observations and conclusions to offer certain interpretations of Jahangi r's court: most notably, its decline as a forum of centralized absolutism into an arena of intrigue and rivalry. Roe, as a product of Jacobean society, perceived Mughal events and institutions from an early seventeenth century English context, thus limiting any hope of "objective" reporting. To substantiate this assertation, this thesis investigates (a) Roe's life in England and how it related to ongoing literary and political movements; (b) the appearance of Jacobean language and metaphors in his text; (c) and highlighting these incongruencies by examining indigenous Mughal documents. Lastly, the study researches historiographical trends of the colonial era and why they have contributed to the consistent use of this source.</description><creator>Mitchell, C. P.

Taking the lead of the work of Michel Foucault on the body in various historical regimes, the author here will posit a theoretical analysis of the "discursive formation" of AIDS, how the body of AIDS is put into discourse, to provide a matrix for establishing the various disciplinary and regulatory apparatuses structuring the epidemic--that is, the affirmation of certain kinds of pleasures and bodies and the strategic circumvention of other pleasures and bodies. Under what the author refers to as the cultural logic of dis-ease, the investigations that follow will be animated by the central question: Whose pleasure and/or power is served by these representations and discourses of the body of AIDS in popular cultural practices?</description><creator>Mechar, Kyle William</creator><contributor>Kaite, Berkeley (advisor)</contributor><date>1995</date><subject>Mass media -- Social aspects</subject><subject>AIDS (Disease) -- Social aspects</subject><subject>Motion pictures -- Social aspects</subject><title>The cultural logic of dis-ease : difference andas displacement in popular discourses of the AIDS crisis</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/hh63sx977.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/kw52j997w</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Graduate Communications Program</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:3t945s96p</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:06:17Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis constitutes a comparative study on the political thought, more specifically the idea of statehood, of two contemporary scholars of Islam from Pakistan and Indonesia. The two scholars under discussion are Abul A'la Mawdudi and Mohammad Natsir who propose fundamentalist and modernist approaches respectively. In spite of their differences, they hold similar viewpoint on the inseparability of politics and religion. In other words, they reject that religious and state matters are sharply separated. They believe that the state is an important means to guarantee that Islamic law is operative in society. Both Mawdudi and Natsir share views on divine sovereignty, the form of state, the shari'a as the source of state law, the principle of shura, and the title of the head of state. However, they disagree on the form of state, nationalism, the political party system, and the definition of citizenship. This study concludes by showing that though they differ on many details of an Islamic state, in general principles they share more similarities than differences. In their differences, Mawdudi's views can be described as idealistic, rigid, and uncompromising, whereas Natsir's views are more realistic, flexible, and compromising. However, neither of them present comprehensive or detailed concepts of an Islamic state, which are fully applicable to their respective countries or to other parts of the Muslim world.</description><creator>Ma'mur, Ilzamudin</creator><contributor>Alvi, Sajida S.

The effects of achievement level and sex were considered. The participants were 95 low achieving students and 100 high achieving students who were rigidly tracked into two separate schools. The survey instrument, "How I See Myself and Feel About Myself" was specially designed for this study. Student responses were compared to the subscales from Harter's Self-Perception Profile for Adolescents (1988). The results revealed twelve self-perception categories, four of which were unique to the Jamaican adolescents. High achievers referred more frequently to academic competence, romantic appeal, and close friendship. Low achievers referred more frequently to behavioral conduct. Overall, male students referred more frequently to scholastic competence, athletic competence and behavioral conduct. Female students referred more frequently to social acceptance, romantic appeal, close friendship and family relations.</description><creator>Lyn, Heather D.</creator><contributor>Delcourt, M.

Unfortunately their talents have not resulted in self-actualization after immigration. This is because they are among the most disadvantaged groups, being discriminated against on the basis of race, class and gender. Chinese women encounter difficulties in integrating into Canadian society. The two major barriers are: the immigration policies towards Chinese, especially in previous generations, and the women's inadequate language skills, even today. In the preparation of this thesis, an appreciation of the obstacles faced by Chinese immigrant women was gained by reviewing the relevant literature and government documents. The concerns of Chinese-Canadian women were placed in context by reviewing the history of women's status in China and their gradual influx into Canada. Participant observation of groups and case studies of individual women revealed that immigrant Chinese women are a heterogeneous group in terms of their backgrounds but homogeneous in terms of their tenacity and their aspirations and hopes for the future. The present study is the first attempt at recognizing Chinese immigrant women in Montreal. The conclusion was reached that through education, hard work and persistence in learning the official languages of Canada, they can triumph in face of societal barriers.</description><creator>Li, Sharon</creator><contributor>Gillett, Margaret (advisor)</contributor><date>1995</date><subject>Immigrants -- Education -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal</subject><subject>Chinese-Canadian women -- Education -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal</subject><title>Chinese-Canadian women in Montreal : case studies in the importance of education</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5m60qv04x.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ht24wm34z</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Administration and Policy Studies in Education</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:sb397b298</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:06:20Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This dissertation explores the way Jurgen Moltmann's biblical hermeneutic informs his salvation-historical approach to ecological theology. Coming from the post-Barthian camp of German Protestant theology, Moltmann has inherited Karl Barth's theological critique of the technological-scientific spirit of modernity. Moltmann differs from Barth, however, in the fact that his underlying preoccupation with the question of theodicy leads him to interpret Barth's theological critique of modernity from within the perspective of modernity's victims. This he accomplishes by retrieving the biblical tradition of eschatologia crucis. Moltmann's political hermeneutic of scripture, which he develops on the basis of the eschatologia crucis, vindicates his salvation-historical approach to nature by offering a substantial critique of the modern techno-scientific spirit. Furthermore, it enables Moltmann's ecological theology to put the crisis of modernity within the broader horizon of the problem of radical evil, thereby offering a profounder hope for the liberation of the suffering creation called for by the WCC theme "Justice, Peace, and the Integrity of Creation."</description><creator>Lee, Hyo-Dong</creator><contributor>Hall, Douglas John (advisor)</contributor><date>1995</date><subject>Moltmann, Jürgen -- Contributions in theology of creation</subject><subject>Human ecology -- Religious aspects -- Christianity</subject><subject>Creation -- History of doctrines -- 20th century</subject><title>Jürgen Moltmann as a biblical theologian : political hermeneutic of scripture as foundational for ecological theology</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cj82k927s.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sb397b298</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Faculty of Religious Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:qr46r307t</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:06:21Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis analyses the intratextual literary symbols of Jacques Poulin's writings, and illustrates the autorepresentative characteristic of his production. Inspired by the three levels for the analysis of autorepresentation established by Janet M. Paterson, this essay demonstrates how Poulin's writings do, in fact, compose a system. The author's choice to stage a character writer experiencing difficulties in his creative effort, is representative in itself: Poulin obviously wished to attract the reader's attention to the literary discourse of his writings. The concrete circumstances of the act of creation are therefore revealed by the fictitious writer. This essay suggests that the presence of auctorial figures complexify the text and generate a theory of the act of writing inherent to Poulin's works. If it shows how the author's discourse corresponds to an autotheorisation of the act of writing, it also shows how the reader's discourse works as instruction. The fictitious reader, by revealing his conception of the act of reading, indicates how Poulin's novel's should be read. Finally, this essay suggests that Poulin's production is not only filled with literary references, but also with numerous references to itself. This network of autoreferences implies that Poulin's writing must be considered and studied as a whole.</description><creator>Ledoux, Nathaly</creator><contributor>Boucher, Jean-Pierre (advisor)</contributor><date>1995</date><subject>Poulin, Jacques, 1937- -- Criticism and interpretation</subject><title>La représentation de l'écrivain dans l'oeuvre de Jacques Poulin</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vd66w180r.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qr46r307t</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Département de langue et littérature françaises</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:8623j1008</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:06:22Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Integrating a thematic perspective and textual analysis into the method, this Master's thesis proposes to study the theme and images of death in Madame Bovary. This essay analyses the representation of death, the relationships with the survivors and the links with the main character. It demonstrates the egoistic perception of death among the survivors and explains the thematic advancement in chapter VIII of the third part of the novel. The peripheral elements of death, such as the character Lestiboudois, the cemetery, the taboos and the generally accepted ideas, are studied in the first chapter. The second is devoted to Emma Bovary's romantic conception of death, through an analysis of artistic influences and inspirations, romantic mysticism, and complacency with regards to the idea of death. I will be studying the causes of her suicide, her desire to die, her distress experienced in love, her financial bankruptcy and her emotional and physical disequilibrium in the third chapter, which ends with the study of the thematic "spiral" in chapter VIII of the third section: the race, God, time, love, nature, anguish, emotional and physical disequilibrium and death, without neglecting the various interpretations of the Blind Man's ditty. In the fourth chapter, I study the mourning, suffering and social conventions, the influence from beyond the grave upon the survivors, the grave, the memories and immortality. Finally, the last chapter, so as to integrate the various notions explained in the preceding chapters, analyses the consequences of each death in the novel upon the survivors and their reactions.</description><creator>Laurin, Jacinthe</creator><contributor>Duquette, Jean-Pierre (advisor)</contributor><date>1995</date><subject>Death in literature</subject><subject>Flaubert, Gustave, 1821-1880.

The opera exhibits a number of harmonic features characteristics of Poulenc's eclectic, idiosyncratic style. This thesis attempts to address the lack of attention given this work in particular and Poulenc's output in general. The thesis consists of two volumes. Volume I contains the introduction, three chapters and the conclusion. Volume 2 contains musical examples, analytical graphs and reproductions of Act 1, Scenes 1 and 2, and Act 2, Scenes 7 and 8 from the piano-vocal score of Les mamelles de Tiresias. The first chapter of Volume 1 reviews two Ph.D. dissertations that examine Poulenc's harmonic language; and summarizes the more recent analyses by Vivan Wood, Pamela Poulin and Keith Daniels. Figures (the musical examples) for Chapter 1 are given in Volume 2. Chapter 2 of Volume 1 examines the large-scale harmonic organization in pivotal scenes that are representative of the musical language in the opera. Chapter 3 of Volume I extends Warren Werner's and Richard Bobbitt's approach to show how local events and large-scale harmonic motions can be viewed as leitmotives that symbolize key events in the drama. Figures (the musical examples) and Graphs (the analytical graphs) for Chapter 3 are given in Volume 2. The conclusion reviews there observations of the study and makes some general remarks about Poulenc's harmonic language.

More specifically, the effects of clinical experience (novice vs. expert) and clinical affiliation (counseling psychologist vs. clinical psychologist) on therapists' style of conceptualizing a client's presenting problem was assessed. The emotional content of the therapists' verbal behaviour during a think-aloud diagnostic task, was analyzed. The Feeling Lexicon indexing procedure was used to assess the emotional content of therapists' discourse during the diagnostic task. Eighteen clinical psychologists and eighteen counselling psychologists were selected to fulfill the criteria for having either novice or expert clinical experience. The findings indicated that: (a) counseling psychologists verbalize more words that connote an emotional content than clinical psychologists and, (b) novice therapists express higher levels of emotionality than expert therapists.

Essential to this endeavor is the identification of conscious operations (acts) and their objectifications (contents). This constitutes the "semantic" burden of Insight which, consequently, ought not to be separated from Lonergan's pragmatical mode of investigation. Failure to note this dipolar structure of Insight results in misinformed analyses which are quick to make faulty ideational correlations, thereby excusing out of hand any ingenuity on the part of Lonergan. This study attempts to reverse such trends by examining certain basic relations of the thinking subject in Insight (i.e. "experience" and "understanding"), and by developing the dynamics of such a relation in the larger context of the differentiations of consciousness (i.e. "intellectual" and "religious"), a concept that is brought to full fruition in Lonergan's widely read Method in Theology (1972).</description><creator>Kanaris, Jim</creator><contributor>Boutin, Maurice (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1995</date><subject>Lonergan, Bernard J.

The dramatist's corpus reveals an intense preoccupation with escapism and exhibits it in a wide range of escape wishes and escape choral odes. Most of these, because they fail of their objective, point to the inability of the tragic hero to escape his or her fate as determined by the dark forces of tragedy. Escapism intensifies the well-known Euripidean element of pathos, but in some of the plays its use becomes quite sophisticated evoking irony, ambiguity and paradox. In this way, it sheds light upon the tragic event from a different perspective. In the end, however, the Euripidean oeuvre betrays a strong affirmation of reality in spite of its escapist tendencies. Euripides' innovative use of escapism is, in fact, an ingenious modification and adaptation of older poetic, and as this thesis argues, ritual forms. Finally, the pervasive presence of escapism in Euripides is not irrelevant to the wider political and social atmosphere of late fifth-century Athens.</description><creator>Kakkos, Athanasios Tommy</creator><contributor>Carson, Ann (advisor)</contributor><date>1995</date><subject>Euripides -- Criticism and interpretation</subject><subject>Escape in literature</subject><title>Escapism in Euripides</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5425kc76w.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/73666667j</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Classics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:p2676x78x</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:06:26Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This study examines the application of the Project Research in Nursing (PRN) patient classification/workload measurement system in a teaching hospital in Quebec. It also compares the workload estimates of direct and indirect care activities determined from patients' total PRN point scores and from corresponding PRN levels of care (classes 1-15). This study examines the allocation and the rankings of patients' needs for nursing care in relation to the categories of the classification instrument. Two documentary sources, audit records of 1988-1989 to 1992-1993 and audit data collection forms of 1992-1993 were used to conduct the study and to provide a comparison of the results. Audit findings were relatively consistent over the five-year period. Comparison of pre-audit and post-audit workload estimates provided detailed information on the measurement sensitivity between total PRN point scores and PRN levels of care; the direction and magnitude of differences between classification ratings; and the distinctive nature of patients' needs for nursing care within and across clinical departments. This study discusses the implications of these findings for nursing resource management decisions, staffing and workload and makes recommendations for practice and further research.</description><creator>Ivanus, Lydia H.
