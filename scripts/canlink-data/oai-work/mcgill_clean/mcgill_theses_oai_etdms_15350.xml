Insofar as it is a major part of the overall pattern of American investment abroad it is al so a serious concern to the United States. For the latter the main problem it poses is the strain placed on its balance of payments. For the Canadian, however, the problem is not so transient. It is the long-run effects rather than the short-run which worries him. The short-run effects of American investment in Canada have been beneficial; the stimulant of increased demand has spread to other sectors of the economy and prosperity has followed.</description><creator>Kelly, Michael.

This particular investigation is an attempt to improve upon the accuracy of measurements of wasting so that future investigators will be able to make more meaningful statements regarding cause. In the 1930's the first quantitative studies of the heat exchange at a melting ice surface were made in Scandinavia. By measuring the heat received at the surface from radiation, convection and conduction from the atmosphere, glacial-meteorologists were able, with limited accuracy, to relate the heat received at the surface to the melt measured from the surface lowering of the glacier. This type of study has now been carried out in many varied locations with a concommitant rise in the sophistication of the observational techniques.</description><creator>Keeler, Charles.

In other words, two-thirds of the deaths from heart disease may be traced directly or indirectly to coronary artery insufficiency (Rowe 1960). Wearn in 1933 described arterioluminal vessels running from the coronary arteries through the myocardium to the ventricular cavities, arterioluminal sinusoids passing deviously through the myocardium, connecting the arterial lumen to the ventricular cavity and the Thebesian veins communicating with the coronary venous system and ventricular lumen.</description><creator>Kato, Yutaka.</creator><contributor>Palmer, W.

There is considerable agreement on the sites of secretion of the shell materiel and the histological identity of these tissues. However, controversy centres about the mechanism by which the organic matrix of the inner layers of the shell is released into the extra-pallial space, by which it is deposited and subsequently calcified. The controversy has, of late, gained importance in that it provides excellent possibilities for the study of the organic composition of the calcifying matrices and their manner of calcification.</description><creator>Kapur, Shakti.

To apply the required loading rates, a hydraulic test unit was designed. Techniques were developed for producing saturated remoulded samples and for measuring the applied stresses, strain and pore pressures in the dynamic test. Electrical instrumentation was used for sensing and recording the transients. No pore pressure measurements were obtained in the dynamic tests conducted. For the same consolidation pressure, the strength of samples as determined in a triaxial test increased with increasing strain rates.

As early- as 1944 vasoexcitor and vasodepressor substances in shock states were postulated and efforts were made to identify the substances responsible. These studies represented one of the first steps in the search to find a single substance as a common denominator in various forms of shock. Recent studies of polypeptides, their biological activity and affect on vasomotor tone have suggested their possible importance in shock states. The more recent studies by Moffat on Bradykinin release in pancreatitis, and by Thal on the release of vasoactive peptides in experimental bowel ischaemic shock models have been the two main studies that led to the quantitative measurement of the release of Bradykinin in experimental haemorrhagic shock.</description><creator>Innes, Bruce.

Or aucun écrivain français si ce n'est Racine n'a créé de femme qui puisse être comparée à la femme claudélienne sans souffrir de la comparaison. Les grands rôles féminins dans le théâtre de Claudel – ceux de Prouhèze, d'Ysé et de Violaine -- sont uniques dans leur profondeur et leur puissance et une étude sérieuse des rôles mineurs découvre une richesse peu soupçonnée au premier abord. D'ou vient cette richesse? Elle vient de la conception que Claudel a eue de la Femme. Elle vient du rôle qu'il lui a donné de jouer dans son théâtre, rôle qui murit d'une pièce a l'autre. Ce qu'est la femme, simple suggestion, dans Tète d'Or 1889, s’épanouit et atteint sa formulation finale dans le Soulier de Satin de 1924.</description><creator>Huzarewitz, Helen.

The bolometer consisted of a platinum disk, to the back of which was bonded a small bead type thermistor. The recombination of atoms upon the surface of the disk provided sufficient heat that a substantial change in the resistance of the thermistor was observed. As part of a testing program for the device, the relative sensitivity defined as (change in temperature/relative number of atoms present) was measured for atomic hydrogen, nitrogen and oxygen. Since the three atoms studied are paramagnetic, it was possible to determine their relative populations by making use of a μ-wave absorption spectrometer. The results of the sensitivity measurements yielded a nitrogen sensitivity of .083 and an oxygen sensitivity of .0024, where the hydrogen sensitivity is taken to be unity. The "decay time", defined as the time required for the temperature of the device to drop 63.2% of the total temperature change when the radicals were turned off was measured to be 15 seconds vs. a calculated value of 25.5 seconds.</description><creator>Hurlburt, Douglas.

It was suggested that these cardiovascular effects of picrotoxin were mediated through central excitation of adrenergic mechanisms, probably involving "release" of catecholamines (noradrenaline mainly) from the hypothalamus and midbrain.</description><creator>Huq, Shariful.</creator><contributor>Melville, K.

These words, written by W. G. Blaikie, author of "Life of Livingstone," express the fairly general attitude of the last twenty years of the nineteenth century in Britain. Africa, a few years earlier, had been comparatively unknown, except along the coast lines. Livingstone, with his adventurous and noble feats, had changed this greatly, and had made Africa a focal point of interest, not only for the casually curious, but also for the statesman, merchant, and missionary.</description><creator>Hornby, Allon.

A considerable amount of work has been done on such diseases, which are called toxemia; however much of it is still a matter of controversy. Much more research must be done on this subject before many of the concepts involved can be accepted. At present, there is need for studies to show that pathogens can produce the same toxins both in axenic culture and in infection, and that injection with toxins can reproduce the physiological disturbances and the symptoms characteristic of the disease.</description><creator>Hoitink, Henricus.

Consequently, efforts will have to be concentrated on intensifying the production of the existing grassland area or improving the quality of grass. It was stressed that at the same time the best possible management practices would be required. On the basis of the 1951 census, Raymond (1958) in a bulletin on pastures for Quebec showed improved pastures in the province as having a carrying capacity of 1.6 acres per animal unit whereas when the total area - 4,768,313 acres - is considered, a carrying capacity of almost exactly 3 acres per animal unit is obtained.</description><creator>Hew, Ewan.

Similar damage to red pine, P. resinosa Ait., due to C. resinosae Hopkins was reported by Harrington (1902a) to have been discovered several years later in 1887. Thomas and Lindquist (1956) and Herdy and Thomas (1961) have reported that shoots of jack pine, P. banksiana Lamb., are infested by Conophthorus species.
