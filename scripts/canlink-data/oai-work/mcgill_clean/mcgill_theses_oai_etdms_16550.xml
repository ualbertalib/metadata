No other country in the world has such a diversity and mixture of peoples within its borders; consequently, no other country has been faced with such a minority or nationalities problem. The attitude of the Bolsheviks, rulers of the Soviet Union, toward these nationalities, forms the subject matter of this enquiry; in order to understand the factors affecting their attitude, it is first necessary to examine, albeit imperfectly, the Tsarist nationality policy in the Russias, the writings of Marx and Engels upon nationalism, and the view of the Austrian Social-Democrats and Jewish Bundists - for these were the legacies inherited by the Bolsheviks, the first practical, the others theoretical.</description><creator>Webb, David.

Isotopes of Bi, Pb, Tl, and Au were separated chemically, and identified by their half-lives and gamma-ray spectra. The measured cross sections were compared with the theoretical values calculated from Serber's theory, and were found to be in agreement within the experimental error of 30% to 50%. At the proton energy used, it was found that the predominant reaction was Bi209 (p,pxn) where x = 1, 2, 3, etc. up to ca. 8. Emission of more than one proton was less likely by a factor of ca. 10, and yields of Tl and Au isotopes were very small.</description><creator>Washington, Robert. A.</creator><contributor>Yaffe, L.

The experiments of Folin (1905 a) on the effect of the protein level of the diet on the composition of urine marked the beginning of modern concepts of protein metabolism. On the basis of his experiment, Folin (1905 b) assumed that protein catabolism is not all of one kind, but could proceed via two pathways which are essentially independent and different. One pathway of catabolism is variable in quantity of end products, while the other process is constant.</description><creator>Warshawsky, Hershey.</creator><contributor>Leblond, C.

With this sort of character, as with his plots and other characters, Shakespeare worked within viable dramatic traditions which were strong enough to provide a base and an inspiration for his genius, yet not so rigid as to limit it. One of the strongest of these traditions was that of the Machiavel. The works of Machiavelli were readily available to the Elizabethans. Although the ‘Discourses’ was not published in English translation until 1636 and ‘The Prince’ until 1640, at least four different manuscript translations of the ‘Discourses’ and three of ‘The Prince’ were made in the Elizabethan period.</description><creator>Wallace, Donald.

Techniques from several fields of meteorology were blended with modern data processing in an attempt to overcome the sparseness and non-representativeness of weather observations. Atmospheric characteristics over British Columbia were found to be sharply differentiated by the direction of the flow at the 700 millibar level. Linearized two-dimensional mountain airflow theory was combined with relevant atmospheric characteristics to derive simple models of precipitation distributions over mountain ranges. These models were used to supplement observations to obtain improved charts of precipitation over the southern half of British Columbia. Altitudinal variation, and other characteristics of the distributions of precipitation and temperature not hitherto available were elucidated. The relationships obtained between atmospheric characteristics and observed weather suggest that it may be practicable and economical to observe the climate of sparsely settled mountainous areas using relatively few weather stations.</description><creator>Walker, Edward.

Silica may occur in the free state or mixed with other minerals in siliceous rocks notably in granites.

In 1859, he described a ‘long-lived luminous species’ produced when an electric current was passed through oxygen. In 1891, during an investigation of electrical discharges through various gases at low pressures, Thomson observed a luminous glow in oxygen which persisted ‘some considerable time’ after the electrical discharge had been interrupted. This glow was subsequently called the ‘oxygen afterglow’, but is now generally referred to as ‘air afterglow’. In the years between 1859 and 1900, a large number of investigators round a variety of afterglows from discharged air of unknown purity.</description><creator>Ung, Alban.

This is no less true of studies descriptive of times past. And the student who presents a series of such pictures is, perforce, brought face to face with the fact that estimates of worth do change quite radically with the passage of the centuries. Obviously the environment itself does change in its superficial forms. Also, men choose, mould, develop and modify various aspects of the framework of their surroundings.</description><creator>Tyman, John. L.</creator><contributor>Lloyd, T.

From the theories and reports presented it is possible to draw together several distinct lines of thought. Early work by Bell (1882-84), Daly (1902), and Coleman (1921) suggested that the higher parts of the eastern edge of north east America had not been covered by continental ice. Coleman goes as far as to say that in the Nachvak area, “the unglaciated condition is known to reach at least 50 miles inland, giving a driftless area of perhaps 3,000 or 4,000 square miles”, though he concedes that valley glaciers must have reached the sea in areas to the south of Nachvak.</description><creator>Tomlinson, Roger.

For thousands of years however, most of the knowledge relating to metals was acquired by chance and the experience gained was passed from man to man through the centuries. Thus, many important processes such as forging and annealing, were carried out for centuries without anyone realizing what structural changes were actually taking place. In fact no attempt to explain the changes that occur during annealing was made until 1881. In that year Kalisher observed that heating caused changes in the "molecular structure" of cold worked zinc.</description><creator>Tiivel, Mati.</creator><contributor>Williams, W.

Nevertheless, despite the large amount of experimental evidence, there has been as yet no agreement as to the mechanism of the reaction, nor has a generalized correlation for the reaction rate been suggested. As a matter of fact, many workers appear to assume that the complexity of the system makes the formulation of such a correlation impossible. One of the main objects of this study has been to attempt an analysis of the mechanism of the reduction, from which a correlation could be derived. To this end, a thorough search of the relevant literature was conducted and the results are presented in the form of a critical review in the first section of this Thesis.</description><creator>Themelis, Nickolas.

The stocks characterized here will be used later in an attempt to associate each chromosome with the appropriate linkage group.

For both groups a relationship was also found between IQ ratings and the aide of the brain showing the most posterior slow waves.

Temperature problems can be solved by increasing the now of ventilating air and or conditioning the air by refrigeration. Controls of this nature are limited only by economic factors. Pressure-increases with depth, however, present a far more complicated and difficult problem.
