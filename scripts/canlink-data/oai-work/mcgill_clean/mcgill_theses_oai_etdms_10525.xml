Cette dissertation porte sur la décision de la politique étrangère sur le conflit prolongé. La question centrale est: qu’est-ce qui crée, prolonge, et termine un tel conflit? Le conflit Coréen, 1948-1993, est une étude d’un tel cas. Cette étude présente les arguments qui tous deux: l’intérêt national et l’identité sont des sources de conflit prolongé, ainsi que les trois facteurs importants dans 1’ affectation du conflit prolongé, c’est-à-dire: les preneurs de decision, la perception négative des adversaires; les commentaires institutionels des états impliqués entre eux; et les stratégies partielles préconçues. Les crises internationales, incluant la guerre, les rares succès sont des comportements dans un conflit prolongé. Le partage des valeurs, les intérêts complémentaires augmentés, et une menace diminueé de l’identité nationale ce qui peut mettre fin au conflit prolongé.</description><description>Although there are many studies on long-term conflict, e.g., ‘Enduring Rivalry Theory’ and ‘Protracted Conflict Theory’ , the literature suffers from neglect of the decisional dimension in such a conflict. This dissertation is on foreign policy decision-making in protracted conflict. The core question is: what creates, prolongs, and terminates such conflict? The Korean conflict, 1948-1993, is studied as a case. This study presents the argument that both national interest and identity are sources of protracted conflict, and that three factors are especially important in affecting the development of a protracted conflict, namely: decision-makers’ negative perceptions of their adversaries; institutionalized commitments of involved states against each other; and biased coping strategies. International crises, including war, and rare accommodation successes are behavioral patterns in a protracted conflict. Value-sharing, increased complementary interests, and a diminished threat to national identity may terminate protracted conflict.</description><creator>Chang, Keung Ryong.</creator><contributor>Brecher, Michael (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1996</date><subject>Korea -- Foreign relations -- 1945-</subject><subject>Social Sciences, Political Science.</subject><subject>Korean War, 1950-1953 -- Diplomatic history.</subject><title>Foreign policy decision-making in a protracted conflict : Korea, 1948-1993</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/np193c960.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fx719q30s</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Political Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:x346d730m</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T17:30:01Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Phenobarbital and diphenylhydantoin were measured concurrently in cerebral tissue and plasma during neurosurgical therapy of epilepsy. Phenobarbital was found to be uniformly distributed between gray and subcortical white matter while diphenylhydantoin was concentrated approximately 1.5 fold in white matter. A significant correlation between brain and plasma levels of phenobarbital was demonstrated (p&lt; 0.001). The mean brain: plasma ratio of phenobarbital was 0.76 ± 0.05 (SEM). Studies following chronic administration of these drugs individually in rats showed significant correlations between brain and plasma levels (r = 0.9, p&lt; 0.01). Diphenylhydantoin and phenobarbital administered concomitantly to rats did not produce changes in plasma levels of either drug. However, the brain, concentration of phenobarbital was significantly increased (p &lt; 0.01). The diphenylhydantoin content of human erythrocytes was shown to provide a reliable index of the free drug concentration in normal and uremic plasma (p&lt; 0.001). Free drug concentration correlated best with both clinical effectiveness and toxicity.</description><creator>Sokolowski-Harvey, Christine D.</creator><contributor>Feindel, W.

A stereotaxic atlas of the whole brain in the three anatomical planes is also included. The atlas plates display photomicrographs of brain structures obtained by the Kluver and Barrera technique for cells and fibers and by the Koelle thiocholine technique for the demonstration of cholinesterase. Several methods of target determination are evaluated and a Proportional System of measurement is introduced. Using this system various brain dimensions can be expanded or contracted to maintain the accuracy of a specific target in spite of variations in the size or weight of the animal. Although such, an approach: can increase the accuracy in reaching a predetermined target point, a significant margin of error persists which is inherent to the principle of using the extracranial rather than the intracerebral landmarks.</description><creator>Smith, Richard A.</creator><contributor>Olivier, A.

To induce the GVHR, parental lymphoid cells were injected into adult F1 hybrid mice. GVHR-activated spleen cells (GVH-SC) obtained at different times post-GVHR induction were separated into adherent and non-adherent fractions and treated with anti-Q serum plus complement. The various types of GVH-SC were mixed with either parental (donortype) or FI (host-type) normal spleen cells (NSC) and cultured with sheep erythrocytes in a modified Marbrook chamber. It was found that both adherent and non-adherent &lt;= 10-day GVH-SC significantly suppressed the plaque-forming cell response of F1 NSC but not that of parental NSC. Significant inhibition of the parental response was observed following the addition of &gt;= 15-day GVH-SC or anti-Q treated adherent or non-adherent 7-day GVH-SC. The results suggest that the non-specific immunosuppressive effect of GVH-SC is mediated by the GVHR-activated macrophages and B lymphocytes found in the anti-Q treated adherent and non-adherent fractions of the GVH-SC suspensions respectively.</description><creator>Parthenais, Elaine</creator><contributor>Lapp, W.

From pH 6.5-11, hydroxamate was found to chemisorb as malachite with a high specificity for copper. Below pH 6.5, the hydroxamate reacted with cupric and bicarbonate ions in solution to form a nonadherent copper octyl hydroxamate precipitate. Both adsorption and precipitation can be explained in terms of the malachite equilibrium solubility diagram, hydroxamine acid dissociation and electrical double laver theory. Malachite floated from pH 5 to 11 except at high collector concentrations where the upper pH limit appears to increase. Maximum floatability (99%) occurs between pH 6.5 to 10, this correlates with the solubility diagram and adsorption.</description><creator>Le Normand, Jacques</creator><contributor>Salman, T.

The volume and enzyme content of the pancreatic juice secreted in response to a test meal of either elemental diet or normal diet was measured. No change was found in the concentrations of amylase, lipase, trypsinogen or protein per, unit volume of juice on either diet. However a 60 percent reduction in the total volume of flow occurred after elemental diet feeding, resulting in an overall reduction in the total amount of enzymes secreted. The elemental diet has been shown to reduce gastric acid secretion, and this may affect the intestinal phase of pancreatic secretion, thus altering both total volume and enzyme output by the pancreas.

Such conclusions have some from both direct and indirect experimental methods (1 - 22). This hypothesis was also tested here in two well-known immunologic reactions of lymphocytes. While rabbit anti-RSL sera was shown to stimulate increased uridine and thymidine incorporation, no effect on the AC system was observed. Freshly collected AS also did not affect AO activity although it stimulated thymidine incorporation in parallel cultures. In the MLR, on the other hand, an increased uridine and thymidine incorporation occurred in cultures which also showed an elevated intracellular cAMP level and AC activity. It is therefore concluded that the MLRs tested here proceed through the mediation of cAMP and does not involve the prior release of Ab. These and other results presented here are discussed in the light of the findings reported from other laboratories.</description><creator>Cusmariu, J.</creator><contributor>McKenzie, J.

Both ethanol and acetyl salicylic acid, when topically administered to stomach mucosal tissue, produced an ulcer if acid was present, but failed in its absence. This ulcer was accompanied by a complex change in acid hydrolase activity. Our belief in the importance of the acid hydrolases in ulcer formation was strengthened and we began to study the properties of these enzymes under normal physiological conditions.</description><creator>Boutros, Mounir I.</creator><contributor>Waldron-Edward, D.

Dexamethasone was removed from the tissue by conventional fixation and dehydration procedures and special techniques were needed for a study of its localization. The lung tissue was processed before the application of the emulsion with the following techniques: I. Freeze-dried tissue, paraformaldehyde vapor fixed and embedded in Epon. II. Freeze-dried tissue, paraformaldehyde vapor fixed and embedded in paraffin. III. Freeze-dried frozen sections. A large diffusion artifact was found with method I. The other methods showed dexamethasone localized in both the alveolar lining cells and in the stromal cells of the lung. A selective concentration of dexamethasone in a particular cell type was not seen. On the subcellular level, dexamethasone was concentrated over the cytoplasm and to a higher degree over the nuclei of the fetal lung cells. The validity and the difficulties of each, technique are discussed as well as new improvements in dry mount radioautography and in the preparation of freeze dried frozen sections.

The increase in resistance during the second challenge was similar to that of the first challenge in the indomethacin treated group, but decreased significantly in the atropine treated group.

Plasma proteins were found to adsorb to plastics surfaces, and the adsorptive properties of albumin were studied in detail. The results showed that almost all leukocytes adhered to plastics in protein-free buffers, but cell adhesion was hindered in buffers containing plastic proteins. Dialyzed and heat-inactivated plasma, but not serum, were shown to inhibit leukocyte adhesion more than normal plasma. EDTA, Ca ++ - Mg ++ - free buffer or EDTA-pre-incubated leukocytes caused increased inhibition of leukocyte adhesion in the presence of plasma and some plasma proteins, but not others. It was suggested that leukocyte membranes are basically sticky to plastics, but their adhesion to protein-coated plastic surfaces involves the binding of the membrane receptors to the adsorbed proteins, and not to the plastics underneath them.</description><creator>Lung, Peter C.</creator><contributor>Cooper, Dr. (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1974</date><subject>Physiology.</subject><title>Effect of plasma proteins on human leukocyte adhesion to plastics</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/44558h30t.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sq87bx49s</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Physiology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:zs25xc71b</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T17:30:11Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The etiology of hepatic encephalopathy has never been adequately defined.

It argues that the poems in  which nature is a major thematic concern express the tension between mind, in it searches for meaning and order, the nature, as it organically purpose its course independent of mind. It explores how Marvell questioned the institutional poetic approaches to the problem of the relationship between nature and human ideals, and his re-evaluation of seventeenth century poetic approaches, to nature and mind, nature and grace, and nature and art.</description><creator>King, Deirdre</creator><contributor>Bouchard, D.

To do this, 100 gm rats (male) were given a single intraperitoneal injection of 0.1 mg of colcemld and sacrificed one to four hours alter injection. In such animals, and also control rats, not injected with colcemid, protein synthesis and secretion had been analysed by radioautography of tissues taken at various time intervals after injection of 3H-proline. Electron microscopic examination revealed that colcemid had disrupted the microtubules which are normally present in the cytoplasm of ameloblasts but did not affect the general shape of these cells. It appeared that the affect of colcemld was reversible. As a result of its effect on microtubules colcemid temporarily inhibited the exocytosis of secretory granules present in. the cytoplasm of ameloblasts. However, colcemid diminished the rate of protein synthesis in these secretory cells.</description><creator>Karim, Algernon C.</creator><contributor>Leblond, C.

Polymorphonuclear leukocytes displayed poor phagocytic activity during first 12 hours and were gradually replaced by mononuclear leukocytes with high phagocytic-activity. 2) Topical, challenge by Staphylococcus Epidermidis did not change the pattern of response. 3) In cutaneous tuberculin positive animals challenged locally with tuberculin there was a deficiency in mononuclear response but intensive phagocytosis was maintained by these mononuclear cells. 4) In gamma irradiated rabbits there was almost a complete absence of mononuclear response during the whole 24 hours-observation period but phagocytosis was carried out by the polymorphonuclear cells. Previously reported decreases of phagocytosis after irradiation appear to he caused by the absence of intensively phagocytosing mononuclear cells rather than by a general inhibition of phagocytosing function.</description><creator>Hui, Hubert Y.</creator><contributor>Macklem, P.

Previous experimental work however, has indicated that vasopressin alone, or in concert with other forms of stress, may result in gastric mucosal damage and resultant hemorrhage. This study was designed to evaluate the incidence and severity of vasopressin induced gastric erosions and to determine if manipulation of intraluminal factors prior to vasopressin infusion could alter the degree of gastric mucosal damage. The incidence and severity of gastric erosions in 35 piglets subjected to laparotomy and coeliac axis infusion of saline or vasopressin was studie4 by gastroscopic, gross and microscopic techniques. The results of these experiments indicate that intra-arterial coeliac vasopressin infusion is harmful to normal porcine gastric mucosa. The degrees of mucosal damage can be significantly decreased by prophylactic administration of cholestyramine and hypertonic glucose prior to vasopressin infusion.</description><creator>Dutton, J.

The central conduction time for the FSR was found to increase with descending spinal level of muscle innervation, being 32.1, 47.2, and 73.1 msec resoectively for the biceps, quadriceps and gastrocnemius. This result therefore favours the view that a long-loop pathway contributes to the FSR. 2. No significant change of FSR latency was found with blockage of cutaneous and joint afferent impulses. Furthermore, the voluntary responses to jolt and auditory stimuli were both of significantly longer latency than that of the FSR (p &lt; 0.001). It appears, therefore, that the early component of the FSR originates predominantly from muscle afferents. 3. The FSR latency was found to be closely correlated with the amplitude of stretch and initial muscle torque. However, no strong correlation with angular velocity of joint movement was found.</description><creator>Chan, Christina W.</creator><contributor>Melvill, J.

While the former predicts that status inconsistents will support social change, the latter predicts that they will become politically apathetic. Each of these theories is tested along with certain modifications in order to resolve this contradiction. The results of the study show that status discrepancy is not related to support for social change (whether measured by vote for the Parti Quebecois or attitudinal support for separatism) as the Lenski hypothesis suggests, nor is it related to political apathy (measured by nonvoting) as the Lipset hypothesis suggests. Tests of the social-psychological model underlying the two theories reveal that while there is no relationship between discrepancy and stress or stress and political apathy, there is a relationship between stress and support for social change.</description><creator>Carron, Christine A.</creator><contributor>Carroll, M.

The major part is a translation of the contemporary Hungarian play, Makra, written by Akos Kertesz. The translation is faithful to the original Hungarian and attempts to preserve the idiom of the play. However, wherever a choice had to be made, dramatic clarity and effect was favored over a literal or strict rendering of the Hungarian. There is also a critical introduction which has a twofold purpose. It provides the Western reader with some literary and social background that is necessary for a full comprehension of the play. Another function is to demonstrate that the play portrays a society, and particularly a working class, in conflict between old bourgeois ethics and new socialist ideals. The essay questions the validity of Hungarian literary criticism and suggests that the critics mystify and generalize the issues of the play in order to detract from the play’s crucial message.</description><creator>Barna, Laszlo</creator><date>1974</date><subject>English.</subject><title>Makra: a translation and critical introduction</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9306t240v.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0k225f24s</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of English</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:cr56n4124</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T17:30:18Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Radar polarization measurements of precipitation at 16.5 GHz are analyzed with reference to the ambient temperature profile of the atmosphere. The measured quantities are the reflectivity, the ratio of the main and cross-polarized signal powers, called the cancellation, and the correlation between these two signals. Polarization observations of the bright band are discussed. It is suggested that correlation gives an indication of the relative number of water drops in the scattering ensemble. From the characteristics of correlation and cancellation observations it is inferred that small snowflakes melt first with the result that radar returns are dominated by large water-covered snow aggregates at levels just below the reflectivity peak in the bright band. Correlation measurements are used to infer possible precipitation types at various altitudes in convective precipitation. A region of mixed-phase scatterers 18 postulated above the 0°C level, with ice phase scatterers above and rain or rain-like particles below.</description><creator>Anderson, Robert S.</creator><contributor>Hendry, A.

Many methods have been suggested for assigning ranks to tied observations in such problems. In this thesis we review and discuss these methods with regards to their relative merits under different situations. The recent extension of the asymptotic theory of rank statistics from continuous to discontinuous distributions has made it possible to calculate the Asymptotic Relative Efficiency (ARE) of different methods of handling ties. A comparison, based on ARE, among the three main methods of handling ties, namely, the average scores, midranks and randomized ranks methods, has been discussed.</description><creator>Tripathi, Satish K.</creator><contributor>Mehra, K.

The technological order leads to standardization, a preoccupation with means that destroys the basis of ethics, and a tendency to use technical (i.e. scientific solutions), for all problems. Ellul does not explore the historical circumstances of the origin of the technological society. Nor does he examine possible alternative currents in modern thought which could be used in the formulation of a democratic theory which would incorporate planning in a different manner. His failure to distinguish between instrumentality, (as a capacity to plan, to innovate) and technique severely limits his theory. The thesis examines Ellul's thought in the context of democratic theory, the rational determination of priorities for scientific research and the planning in an interdependent world.</description><creator>de Wilde, James</creator><contributor>Taylor, C.

With this technique, the rate of plasma cholesterol esterification was linear to approximately 40 min. The Mean plasma LCAT activity in a group of eight male subjects (87 nmoles cholesterol esterified/hr per ml of plasma) was significantly higher (p &lt; 0.01) than that in a group of seven female subjects (61 nmoIes/ hr per ml of plasma) with the same age average. Addition of HDL or HDL3 did not change the initial rate of cholesterol esterification in total plasma but HDL2 inhibited the reaction. Chylomicrons and VLOL significantly increased the initial rate as well as the net yield of the LCAT reaction in total plasma.
