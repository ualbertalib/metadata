This thesis used the same models, but modified the two main mechanisms  used in CE, that is, functional interaction and overlap, in order to better  understand how they contribute to process performance, i.e., how they affect product  development effort and span time. The present study used more realistic development  processes over previous research in addition to using the same uncertainty  conditions, rework, learning, and communication techniques. Simulation results of  the updated models were discussed in comparison to the baseline models in terms of  effort versus span time and effort distribution during the process versus span  time. Research outcomes indicated that the use of CE was beneficial as  long as the uncertainty of information during product development was moderate to  low. When uncertainty was high, sequential engineering was best. Several cases were  demonstrated. The distribution of effort during product development was  studied and it showed that processes should be designed to avert rework due to  design versions (complete redesign of the product) and should emphasize churn  (redesign in small steps during teamwork).</description><creator>Liu, Yun, 1969-</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Engineering, Industrial.</subject><title>A study of key mechanisms for concurrent engineering processes /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/h989r365f.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8g84mm76s</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mechanical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:x920fx38h</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:31:57Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Witnesses believed that the Black Death and subsequent  fourteenth-century plagues threatened profound social change. However, Geoffrey  Chaucer (c.1340-1400) does not appear to accord the plague a place of any importance  in his works. This is especially surprising in the case of the Canterbury Tales ,  which presents a complex portrait of plague-era society. Chaucer's silence on the  plague is reinforced by critical positions that deemphasize the effects of the  plague and emphasize Chaucer's supposed lack of interest in his world. This thesis  contends that the plague is in fact present in the Canterbury Tales in the guise of  the changes that it threatened. By situating the Canterbury Tales in a network of  literary and non-literary responses to the plague, I demonstrate that Chaucer  participated in a discourse that attempted to restore order to a world that was seen  to have been disordered---morally, socially, and physically---by the  plague.</description><creator>Walsh Morrissey, Jake</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Plague in literature.</subject><subject>Chaucer, Geoffrey, d. 1400.

Most studies to date have assumed  homogeneous tissue mechanical properties. The objective of this study was to  investigate the local variation in AA tissue structure and mechanics. Healthy and  pathologic tissue samples of human AA were obtained at autopsy and surgical  pathology. Each aortic ring was sectioned into quadrants; anterior, posterior,  medial (inner curvature) and lateral (outer curvature). Samples from each quadrant  were processed for histological analysis and biaxial tensile testing. The results  from this study indicate that regional differences are present in both healthy and  diseased human AA tissue. Overall, the medial quadrant contained significantly more  elastin and mechanically, it was the thickest, least stiff and most likely to fail  in comparison to the other quadrants. The assumption of homogeneity in AA tissue  properties may not be a valid one.</description><creator>Choudhury, Nusrat Zabeen</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Engineering, Biomedical.</subject><title>Characterization of healthy and diseased human ascending aorta tissue</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/g158bh752.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dz010q56p</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Chemical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:z316q1989</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:31:57Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This study examines the influence of Qur'anic teachings on the  development of falsafa on the one hand, and the position of tafsirs in the  intellectual history of Islam on the other. To do so, in the introduction it  attempts to situate the place of falsafa and its connections with kalam and tafsir,  and to explain the approach that will be followed in this research. In the first  part it treats some of the ontological vocabulary of the Qur'an, while in the  second, it concentrates on the questions raised by the Qur'an about the ontological  status of pre-existing things as well as on the notions of creation and existence.  To this purpose it surveys some early tafsirs in order to see how the debate over  these issues evolved therein and how philosophical discussions were appropriated and  naturalized by the mufassirun.</description><creator>Meral, Arzu</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Philosophy, Islamic</subject><title>An ontological inquiry in early Qur'ān commentaries /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/np193962r.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z316q1989</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Islamic Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:hq37vp08w</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:31:58Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>With their planar structure and compatibility with the printed  circuit fabrication techniques, printed dipole antennas present one of the best  options for future wireless networks.

Two previously described origin binding proteins, OBA/Ku and CBP/14-3-3 were  analyzed. Previously, Ku was shown to bind to A3/4, a 36-bp origin sequence, in  vitro, and 14-3-3 isoforms were identified as cruciform binding proteins (CBP) which  interact with cruciform structures present in mammalian replication  origins. Here, the in vivo association of Ku and 14-3-3 with mammalian  origins of DNA replication was analyzed by studying its association with the monkey  (CV-1) replication origins ors8 and ors12, by formaldehyde cross-linking, followed  by chromatin immunoprecipitation (Chip) and quantitative PCR analysis. The  involvement of 14-3-3 in mammalian DNA replication was also analyzed by studying the  effect of anti-14-3-3beta, epsilon, gamma, and zeta antibodies in the in vitro  replication of p186, a plasmid containing the minimal replication origin of  ors8. Ku and 14-3-3beta, epsilon, gamma, zeta and sigma isoforms were  found to be associated with mammalian origins of DNA replication and their  association was the highest in cells synchronized at the G1/S phase of the cell  cycle. In addition, Anti-14-3-3epsilon, gamma and zeta antibodies inhibited p186  replication by approximately 30--80%. The Ku80 mutant (xrs-5) and deficient (Ku80-/- MEFs) cell lines  were also tested for their ability to replicate p186, in vitro. Whole cell (WCE) and  cytoplasmic cell extracts from the xrs-5 cells replicated p186 with the same  efficiency as are wild-type (wt) CHO K1 cells. In contrast, xrs-5 nuclear extracts  did not possess any detectable replication activity, while the Ku80 -/- WCE had a  decrease of ~70% in their ability to support p186 replication, by comparison  to the wt Ku80-/- extracts. Furthermore, in vivo, the p186 episomal DNA replication  in transfected xrs-5 cells was reduced by 45% by comparison to CHO K1  cells. The in vivo association of Ku with the Chinese hamster DHFR  oribeta or the mouse Adenosine deaminase (ADA) origins of DNA replication was  examined in both the Ku80 mutant (xrs-5) and deficient (Ku80-/-) cell lines, and in  their respective wild-type counterparts. Anti-Ku antibodies failed to  immunoprecipitate a detectable amount of Ku from the either xrs-5 or Ku80-/- cells  in the origin-containing-sequence, in contrast to the wild type cells, wherein Ku  was found to be associated with the oribeta and ADA origins,  respectively. The data implicate Ku antigen in DNA replication and suggest the  existence of another protein in rodent cells that is able to substitute for Ku  function. They also indicate a novel function for Ku and the 14-3-3 isoforms beta,  epsilon, gamma, zeta and sigma, as origin-binding-proteins in vivo, which provides a  better understanding of the chromosomal association and DNA binding sequences of  mammalian initiator proteins with origins of replication in their natural  chromosomal environment.</description><creator>Novac, Olivia</creator><contributor>Zannis-Hadjopoulos, Maria (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Biology, Molecular.</subject><title>Studies on origin binding proteins involved in mammalian DNA replication</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6t053g59n.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/tb09j616n</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biochemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:6108vb895</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:31:59Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The Food Habits of Canadians Survey, conducted in 1997--1998  examined food and nutrient intakes of non-institutionalized adults aged 18--65 years  (n = 1543) randomly selected from across Canada using the multi-stage random  sampling strategy. Dietary intake was assessed by 24-h recall and a repeat interview  was conducted in a sub-sample (n = 446). The overall response rate was 26%. Males,  younger age adults (18--34 years), single persons and those with lower education  levels were underrepresented in the study sample thus limiting the generalizability  of the study results. Examination of the characteristics of the selected areas (n =  63) by response rates, indicated that areas with a higher percentage below the low  income cut-off level, higher percentage who moved residence in the past 5 years and  higher percentage speaking non-official languages as the mother-tongue were  associated with low response rates. Additionally, areas with lower percentage  females were associated with low response rates indicating that depending on the  community characteristics different approaches may be needed to enhance response  rates. Within- to between-subject variance ratios for several nutrients were higher  when adjusted for age, gender, education, season, smoking and size of family  compared to the crude ratios (e.g. for energy 1.07 vs. 0.49 for males). As a result,  more days would be needed to reliably estimate usual intake once the data are  appropriately adjusted. Examination of the within- to between-subject variability  ratios for nutrients by smoking status indicated that the diet of smokers was no  more variable than that of non-smokers. However, smokers had higher intakes of total  fat (p &lt; 0.05) and saturated fat (p &lt; 0.05) and lower intakes of  folate (p &lt; 0.05) and vitamin C (p &lt; 0.05). Smokers also had lower  intakes of fruit and vegetables compared to non-smokers (p &lt; 0.05). Given  these differences, diet may be a confounder in studies examining smoking</description><creator>Palaniappan, Uma</creator><contributor>Gray-Donald, K.

It will analyze his impact on the Turkish revolution and the evolution of the  nation's politics. Celal Bayar, Turkey's third president did not fit the mold of his  country's top politicians of the day. He was essentially different from all the  other key players of his generation in terms of his background, education,  experience, career path, and even length of life. Those who have written about him  have for the most part been either uncritical admirers or bitter enemies. Though he  held, in turn, the positions of Minister of the Economy, Prime Minister and  President (he was the first civilian to hold this part) during one of the most  critical periods in Turkish political history. Thus, he was overshadowed by his  predecessors Mustafa Kemal Ataturk and Ismet Inonu. Yet his very uniqueness makes  him an apt subject for study. Celal Bayar deserves our attention because he undertook crucial  responsibilities and duties in the social and economic transformation of Turkey. In  an era of strong state policies that made up for the weakness of the social classes,  Bayar was the founder of the nation's mixed economy. During the Turkish revolution  and the subsequent formation of a united Turkish society, he devoted himself to the  development of the national economy. Throughout his political career he exercised a  decisive influence over the evolution of the country's politics, economy, society,  and foreign relations. Despite his importance, there is a general dearth of academic  studies in English about him---a situation that this study seeks to  correct.</description><creator>Özoral, Başak</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Turkey -- History -- Revolution, 1909</subject><subject>Turkey -- Politics and government -- 20th century</subject><subject>Bayar, Celâl, 1883-</subject><title>The Turkish transformation and Celal Bayar /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dj52w529s.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3x816n07t</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Islamic Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:th83kz88z</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:31:59Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Photoproduction events in ep collisions with photon virtuality  Q2, the negative squared four-momentum of the exchanged photon, less than 1 GeV2,  and at least two jets of high transverse energy have been studied in the photon and  proton center-of-mass range Wgp of 134 &lt; Wgp &lt; 277 GeV with the ZEUS  detector at HERA. The data sample was collected during the 1996 and 1997 running  periods with an integrated luminosity of 38.7 pb-1 allowing for a precise  measurement of differential cross sections in a kinematic regime unreachable for  experiments at current e+e- colliders. For the determination of these differential  cross sections, both jets were required to have a transverse energy larger than 11  GeV with at least one having more than 14 GeV. Differential hadron cross sections  were extracted for these dijet events using separate resolved and direct enhanced  subsamples. The cross sections have been compared to NLO QCD calculations using  several different parametrisations of the photon structure functions within these  calculations. The achieved sensitivity of the data at the photon structure functions  allows to test the validity of the used parametrisations of the photon structure  functions. This test shows the need for improvements of those parametrisations in  the kinematical range under investigation. The extracted data at low xOBSg  constrains the parton densities in the photon which can be exploited in future  parametrisations of the photonic parton densities.</description><creator>Ochs, Andreas H.</creator><contributor>Corriveau, Francois (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Physics, Elementary Particles and High Energy.</subject><title>Dijet photoproduction at high transverse energies with the ZEUS detector at HERA</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qz20st07q.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/th83kz88z</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Physics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:5999n393v</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:32:00Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Hasan Salah, a  13th-century exponent of the Isma'ili qiyamat doctrine, and Saint Paul the Apostle,  the author of much of the New Testament, believed that during their lifetimes, a  Messiah had come. The arrival of the Messiah triggered the end time; in this new  time of sacredness, both authors believed that it was impossible---and even  counterproductive---to gain salvation by following the traditional religious law.  This thesis juxtaposes both authors' conceptions of the religious law, highlighting  how each author reinterprets scripture to argue that the law simply cannot bring  salvation in this new time. It then discusses how, in place of the law, both authors  advocate a new, more individual soteriology structured around the Messianic figure.  This thesis then discusses the seven shared structural features of both  eschatologically based theologies, strengthening the corpus of evidence suggesting  that Isma'ili thinkers often incorporate specifically Christian elements into their  theology.</description><creator>Velji, Jamel A.</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Eschatology.</subject><subject>Ḥasan Ṣalāḥ, Munshī, fl. 1204</subject><subject>Ecclesiastical law.</subject><subject>Eschatology, Islamic.</subject><subject>Islamic law.</subject><subject>Messiah.</subject><subject>Paul, the Apostle, Saint</subject><subject>Ismailites.</subject><title>Saint Paul, the Ismāʻīlīs, and the end of the world : new visions of the religious law</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3484zh39w.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5999n393v</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Islamic Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:pr76f4013</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:32:00Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This master's thesis is entitled "Nietzsches Philosophie  der Dekadenz in Thomas Mains Roman Der Zauberberg. Zu Rationalitat, Metaphysik and  Erziehung." It focuses on Mann's treatment of Nietzsche's critiques of  rationality, metaphysics and education. It is argued that the characters Settembrini  and Naphta, who attempt to educate the main character, Castorp, personify  Nietzsche's critiques of rationality and metaphysics, and their interweavement, as  both rely on a common feature: belief. As a reaction to this confusion, the  relativistic approach of Castorp increases and leads him to passivity and  indifference. The failure of his education evokes Nietzsche's critique of an  education which does not teach one to define one's own values and set oneself a  goal. The fact that Castorp's fate evokes Nietzsche's in the novel is interpreted as  Mann's critique of Nietzsche's philosophy, especially of his  perspectivism.</description><creator>Lachance, Nathalie</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Nietzsche, Friedrich Wilhelm, 1844-1900 -- Influence</subject><subject>Mann, Thomas, 1875-1955.

In order to make such a demonstration, we have consulted the  works of Carl Gustav Jung, but also of scholars from various disciplines such as  anthropology, mythology, folklore and sociology. In the first chapter we briefly  expose the main concepts of the Jungian theory, particularly that of the archetypes.  In the second chapter, we present a survey of secondary literature which sheds light  on the similarities and contrasts between fairy tales and myths, we enumerate the  different theories regarding the origin of tales and we state and discuss  interpretative theories similar or opposed to Jung's. In the third chapter we  finally propose a Jungian type analysis of three Grimm tales from the Kinder-und  Hausmarchen.</description><creator>Levasseur, Isabelle-Luce</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Jungian psychology</subject><subject>Psychology in literature</subject><title>Lecture jungienne des contes des frères Grimm : là où littérature, mythologie et psychologie se rencontrent</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/x346d4785.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zs25x9131</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of German Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:2r36tz07k</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:32:01Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis proposes that Charles Taylor's notion of the  'dialogical human life'---or what I call 'dialogical being in the world'---can be  expanded to include pedagogical and democratical aspects. Furthermore, given the  collapse of foundational epistemologies, I propose that teacher fulfillment may be  negotiated through 'hermeneutical understanding', which recognizes the participation  of the knower ('I') in the known (the 'other'). Such hermeneutical understanding is  achieved through acknowledging my 'dialogical, democratical and pedagogical being in  the world' (my life) as an unfolding story, which connects present acts of  understanding the 'other' (including the otherness of self) with the past and future  vision of fulfillment.</description><creator>Parachoniak, Bryan Lorin</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Parachoniak, Bryan Lorin</subject><subject>Education -- Philosophy</subject><title>The otherness of I : narrative, pedagogical being and fulfillment</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3t945r32x.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2r36tz07k</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Integrated Studies in Education</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:2801pg73m</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:32:01Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis is dedicated to the study of the relationship  between the solitude of the Poet and the multitude of Paris in les Petits poemes en  prose by Baudelaire (also known as Le Spleen de Paris ).

The Wilms' tumour suppressor 1 ( WT1) gene was identified through  the study of hereditary cases of Wilms' tumour showing cytogenetic deletions at  chromosome position 11p13. The WT1 gene encodes a zinc finger transcription factor  necessary for the development of the genitourinary system. WT1 functions as an  activator or a repressor, interacts with a number of different protein partners and  regulates the expression of several genes important for cellular growth and  differentiation. WT1 mRNA is present in tissues of mesodermal origin that undergo a  mesenchymal to epithelial transition. Expression of WT1 is tightly regulated both  temporally and spatially during development of the urogenital  system. We have identified a novel trans-acting factor, named complex D,  which shows sequence specific binding to the WT1 promoter. By electrophoretic  mobility shift assays (EMSA), we demonstrate that the transcription factor Sp1 binds  the WT1 promoter at a site overlapping the complex D binding site. Molecular mass  determination experiments and in situ UV crosslinking indicate that complex D is  approximately 130 kDa and consists of at least two proteins. Transient transfection  assays show that the integrity of the complex D binding site is necessary for  maximal activation of a reporter gene, suggesting that complex D may function as an  activator. Similar to WT1, the ETS-domain transcription factor Pea3 is  expressed in tissues where mesenchymal-epithelial interactions occur and both gene  products are implicated in regulating the expression of genes necessary for the  epithelialization of common organs. Transient transfection assays using WT1  promoter-reporter gene constructs identified a Pea3 responsive element in the WT1  promoter. Overexpression of Pea3 transactivates the WT1 promoter and the presence of  the intact Pea3 responsive element is necessary for the transactivation. We  demonstrate, by EMSA, the sequence specific binding of Pea3 to the responsive  element. WT1 and the paired box domain transcription factor Paired box 2  (Pax2) are expressed at the initial stages of metanephric kidney development and are  critical for the initiation of nephrogenesis. We generated WT1/Pax2 compound  heterozygous mutant mice to provide an in vivo model for studying the interplay  between WT1 and Pax2 during nephrogenesis. WT1+/-/Pax2 1Neu/+ kidneys were 50%  smaller that wild type kidneys and displayed a more severe underdevelopment of the  medulla, renal calyces and renal pelvis compared to Pax21Neu/+ kidneys. We  demonstrate that WT1 and Pax2 proteins physically interact in vitro and in vivo. Our  data suggest that WT1 is a modifier of the Pax2 mutant phenotype and that both  proteins may be implicated in a common pathway in the transcriptional network  governing metanephric development.</description><creator>Discenza, Maria Teresa</creator><contributor>Pelletier, Jerry (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2003</date><subject>Chemistry, Biochemistry.</subject><subject>Health Sciences, Oncology.</subject><subject>Biology, Molecular.</subject><title>Regulation of expression of the Wilms' tumour 1 tumour suppressor gene</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/t148fh674.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6395w7858</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biochemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:df65v845x</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:32:02Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This dissertation analyzes the use of speech (prise de parole )  in Marguerite de Navarre's works of fiction in conjunction with the place that the  arguments of the Quarrel about Women hold in her writings. The texts of the Quarrel about Women, which were very popular in  sixteenth century France, tried to prove the superiority or the inferiority of women  depending on which side of the debate the writer belonged to. The works of  Marguerite de Navarre incorporate numerous arguments of this literary debate to  deconstruct them and establish a certain balance between the qualities and the  defaults of men and women. Contrary to the writers of the Quarrel who were using as  examples women from the Bible or the Antiquity, the Queen of Navarre's works portray  mainly characters from daily life in situations that illustrate the way the two  sexes use speech differently. Thus, in the religious poems, women communicate more quickly  with the divine because they listen more to their heart which is the receptacle of  God. Indeed, the only obstacle that stands between them and mystical union resides  in a too strong attachment to a human being, whereas men encounter more hindrances  linked, among others, to ambition, science and lust. As for profane poems, they  highlight the value of feminine friendship by presenting a free and equal verbal  exchange, among women only, based on mutual aid. In the Heptameron, men, in the  novellas, hold a greater power than women and it is mirrored in the efficiency of  their prise de parole, while there is a certain equality, in the cornice, between  the devisants of both sexes. Finally, in the theater, women as well as men deliver  God's Word. Speech which constitutes the most important meeting ground for  men and women, in Marguerite's writings, demonstrates how the main criticism  directed at women by the detractors of the Quarrel, their unstoppable and slanderous  chattering, as well as many other faults are rejected by using examples of women  that speak wisely. This makes Marguerite de Navarre's writings modern, because while  they deconstruct the binary opposition of man versus woman, with everyday life  examples, they do not propose to establish a new hierarchy and thus they are open to  plurality.</description><creator>Lucuix, Hélène</creator><contributor>Desrosiers-Bonin, Diane (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Sex role in literature</subject><subject>Marguerite, Queen, consort of Henry II, King of Navarre, 1492-1549 -- Criticism and interpretation</subject><subject>Man-woman relationships in literature</subject><title>Prises de parole et querelle des femmes dans l'œuvre de M. de Navarre</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/41687h97b.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/df65v845x</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Département de langue et littérature françaises</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:jw827c24h</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:32:03Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained arrhythmia  encountered in clinical practice. The objectives of this study were to determine the  mechanisms and significance of ionic transients in mathematical action potential  models, determine the relative contributions of tachycardia-related myocyte  remodeling processes to the pathologic features of the remodeled action potential,  and to investigate mechanisms of AF maintenance and antiarrhythmic drugs in atrial  tissue. We began by formulating expressions for myocyte Cl- transport  processes which allowed us to evaluate model stability and the influence of model  equation singularity, and to characterize pacing-induced ionic transients. We found  that tissue and model transients are comparable, indicating that any distortion  arising from dynamic equation instabilities is not likely to be  significant. We then measured Ca2+-transients in isolated atrial myocytes in  control and following tachycardia-induced remodeling and formulated the first atrial  action potential model with realistic Ca2+-handling properties. Our results  demonstrate that both remodeling of sarcolemmal ionic currents and subcellular  Ca2+-handling processes contribute significantly to action potential shortening and  loss of rate adaptation as occurs in chronic AF. Next we developed a two-dimensional model of canine atrial  tissue and the first model of AF with realistic ionic and propagation properties.  The model provides the first theoretical confirmation of the recent  experimentally-determined conception of the mechanisms of AF maintenance, indicating  that discrete "driver regions" underlie AF, and that wavelets generated by  emanating wavefronts give rise to fibrillation but play a relatively passive role in  maintaining AF. Finally we used our model of AF to determine the mechanisms of  AF termination by sodium channel blocking agents (class I antiarrhythmic drugs). In  agreement with recent experimental findings, our results demonstrate how sodium  channel inhibition first slows and organizes AF, and how the effects of decreased  excitability cause AF termination in a way that is independent of wavelength  changes, previously thought to be necessary for antiarrhythmic efficacy.

W. F. Hegel as philosophies  of intersubjectivity. In this study we hope to make an important contribution to  Levinas scholarship by historically locating Levinas' interpretation of Hegel's  Phenomenology of Spirit in the twentieth century French-Hegelian tradition. The  historical location of Levinas' thought concerning Hegel is important because a  French-Hegelian reading of the Phenomenology of Spirit is not a textually accurate  portrayal of Hegel's thought. We will argue that a French-Hegelian reading of the  Phenomenology of Spirit actually misinterprets the meaning of  "teleological" time and "the end of history" in Hegel's text,  and that it does so for expressly political purposes. We will argue that Levinas'  French-Hegelian misinterpretation affects both his portrayal of Hegel's  phenomenology and his own ethical phenomenology. Locating Levinas' Hegel in a  French-Hegelian tradition is important for understanding his phenomenology because  Levinas negatively situates his own ethical account of intersubjectivity against  what he takes Hegel's phenomenology of intersubjectivity to consist in. As a  consequence, Levinas goes to great lengths in Otherwise than Being to describe time  as "diachronous" in direct contradistinction to what we will argue is a  French-Hegelian misreading of "teleological" time in Hegel's Phenomenology  of Spirit . After we establish a proper reading of Hegel's phenomenology of  intersubjectivity, and we establish how Levinas misunderstands the Phenomenology of  Spirit from a French-Hegelian perspective, we will be able to access the viable  similarities that actually inhere between their purportedly "diametrically  opposing" phenomenologies of intersubjectivity. These similarities will give us  a logical point of contact between the two philosophers in terms of which we can  normatively evaluate their respecti</description><creator>Guinan, Natasha S.</creator><contributor>Buckley, R.

The objective of this thesis was to determine whether Haemonchus  contortus GluCls are important targets for these anthelminthics. To begin to address  this we cloned a full length GluCl alpha-subunit cDNA from H. contortus (HcGluCla).  This subunit shares a high homology with GluCl subunits from Caenhorhabditis elegans  that have been shown to be important targets for IVM, suggesting that HcGluCla is  also an IVM target. However, if HcGluCla is an IVM receptor then it should contain  an IVM binding site. To investigate this, the HcGluCla gene was expressed in COS-7  cells. The resulting subunit bound [3H]IVM and [ 3H]MOX with affinities sufficiently  high enough to explain their high in vivo potency. Interestingly, glutamate was an  allosteric modulator of [ 3H]MOX and [3H]IVM binding where it increased the affinity  of these drugs to HcGluCla. To gain further insight into the potentiation of IVM,  various glutamatergic and non-glutamatergic ligands were screened for their ability  to enhance [3H]IVM binding to HcGluCla. Of the ligands tested, only the GluCl  agonists glutamate and ibotenate potentiated [3H]IVM binding. It is possible  therefore that if IVM interacts with GluCls in vivo then IVM efficacy may be  enhanced by GluCl agonists. To examine this, we tested whether ibotenate could  enhance IVM efficacy in gerbils infected with H. contortus. In in vivo efficacy  studies, ibotenate (at 1 mg/kg) increased IVM efficacy by 15% (p = 0.048). The  enhancement of IVM efficacy in vivo by a GluCl agonist suggests that one of the IVM  targets in H. contortus is the GluCl. Finally, to determine the potential  physiological response from an interaction between IVM and H. contortus GluCls, we  expressed HcGluCla in Xenopus oocytes. HcGluCla expressed in oocytes formed a  homomeric channel that responded to</description><creator>Forrester, Sean Geritt</creator><contributor>Beech, Robin (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Ivermectin.</subject><subject>Haemonchus contortus.</subject><subject>Chloride channels.</subject><subject>Drug resistance.</subject><title>Characterization of a macrocyclic lactone receptor subunit from Haemonchus contortus</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/jm214p637.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/jw827c25s</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Parasitology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:4x51hj600</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:32:04Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>A Multi-Terminal Direct Current (MTDC) system consists of  several Voltage-Source Converters (VSCs) whose dc terminals are connected in shunt  across the buses of a dc network. The dc voltages are determined by the electric  charges stored across the dc capacitor of every Voltage-Source Converter (VSC). As  dc over-voltage leads to failure in the solid-state switches and dc under-voltage  leads to waveform distortion, the target of safe, economic design is a narrow  voltage margin of about 5% around a nominal dc voltage rating. The worst case  scenario consists of an accidental loss of a Voltage-Source Converter because the  sudden large change in dc power causes the dc capacitors to charge up or down,  exceeding the voltage margin before power balance can be re-established by local  feedbacks of the Voltage-Source Converters (VSCs). Part I of the thesis shows how the target can be achieved by:  (1) planning the dc voltage reference setting and the power reference settings of  the Voltage-Source Converters (VSCs) which satisfy the voltage margins in  steady-state for both the pre-fault and post-fault conditions; (2) incorporating an  Advanced DC Voltage Control (ADCVC) which enables the dc voltage margins to be  satisfied during the transient periods. Part II of the thesis is concerned with finding innovative  applications for Multi-Terminal Direct Current (MTDC) systems. It shows that the  high degree of controllability of the Multi-Terminal Direct Current (MTDC) system  can be exploited in: (1) optimal acquistion of wind power in offshore wind-farms;  (2) providing premium quality power in underground cable in-feeds of city centers;  (3) providing simultaneous inter-area decoupling and local area damping in  interconnections.</description><creator>Lu, Weixing, 1966-</creator><contributor>Ooi, Boon Teck (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2003</date><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>Control and application of multi-terminal HVDC based on voltage-source converter</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bc386j723.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4x51hj600</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:ns064664j</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:32:04Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This study investigated the music-reading errors of  6--13-year-old piano students (n = 35) as they read three unfamiliar musical pieces.  The musical pieces were similar in terms of tonality, and rhythmic and melodic  complexity, but differed in terms of simultaneity of left- and right hand and  complexity of left-hand arrangement. Pitch errors were examined in terms of frequency, placement, and  type. Of all pitches played, 23% were incorrect pitches. However, 30% of the  incorrect pitches were followed by an immediate correction (self-correction). There  were significantly more errors made in the left-hand parts than in right-hand parts  of all three pieces. The most common error type was erroneous pitches, followed by  redundant and omitted pitch errors respectively. Erroneous pitches were  significantly more often contour preserving than contour violating. The younger  children made significantly more redundant pitch errors and contour violating pitch  errors than did the older children and the younger children tended to make more  self-corrections than did the older children. Timing data were examined in terms of the length of performances  and in terms of the length and frequency of pauses. No significant differences were  found between pieces or age groups in terms of timing. A high frequency of pauses  was noted in both age groups. Evidence drawn from pitch and timing errors suggested  that the children in this study tried to play all the pitches in the score with  little or no consideration for the rhythmic information in the score. This finding  was in accordance with results of previous studies on children and music reading.  Implications for music education and research are discussed.</description><creator>Gudmundsdottir, Helga Rut</creator><contributor>Costa-Giomi, Eugenia (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Sight-reading (Music)</subject><subject>Music -- Juvenile.</subject><title>Music reading errors of young piano students</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/g445cd70x.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ns064664j</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Faculty of Music</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:44558d81p</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:32:05Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Recently, the ideas of extra dimensions and brane world  scenarios have captured considerable interest. The potential ability of these  brane-based models to explain the gauge hierarchy problem and the cosmological  constant problem has been examined in numerous recent papers (on these subjects). In  the first part of this thesis we examine many aspects of warped brane world  scenarios, focusing on the Randall-Sundrum model. We begin with the stability issue  of the Randall-Sundrum model and its cosmological implications. We will specifically  verify that the Randall-Sundrum scenario; once stabilized, will reproduce the  late-time conventional cosmology. In further studies, the possibility of providing a  very small cosmological constant, in accordance with recent observations, is  examined in the context of the warped brane world scenario. We also show that the  "self-tuning" mechanism of the cosmological constant problem does not  improve in the brane world models and the unnatural fine-tuning mystery of the  cosmological constant problem remains unexplained. In the second part of this thesis  some cosmological implications of the tachyon are examined. In particular, a  mechanism is presented to take advantage of a time-varying tachyonic background to  convert the energy of the tachyon to radiation at the end of  inflation.</description><creator>Firouzjahi, Hassan</creator><contributor>Cline, J.

Drawing upon select images in the studioli, as well as  text sources readily available to Duke Federico da Montefeltro (1422--82) and the  members of his court, this inquiry examines how the discipline of architecture  equipped the late quattrocento mind with a bridge between the mathematical arts,  which lend themselves to mechanical practices, and the art of rhetoric, a discipline  central to the cultivation of memory and eloquence. As ramifications of material and  mental craft, the studioli offered the Urbino court models for education and prudent  governance.</description><creator>Kirkbride, Robert</creator><contributor>Perez-Gomez, Alberto (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Studiolos -- Italy -- Urbino</subject><subject>Gubbio Studiolo (Palazzo ducale, Gubbio, Italy)</subject><subject>Federico, da Montefeltro, Duke of Urbino, 1422-1482 -- Palaces -- Italy</subject><subject>Studiolos -- Italy -- Gubbio</subject><subject>Decoration and ornament, Renaissance -- Italy</subject><subject>Palazzo ducale (Urbino, Italy)</subject><title>The renaissance studioli of Federico da Montefeltro and the architecture of memory /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vx021f75x.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0c483j89h</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Architecture</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:1j92g810n</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:32:05Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Prolactin (PRL) is a polypeptide hormone synthesized by the  anterior pituitary as well as by a number of extrapituitary tissues. The hormone is  an essential regulator of important biological processes. The best characterized  role for PRL is its participation in the development of the lobuloalveolar system in  the mammary gland. The biological actions of PRL are mediated in the cell by the  membrane-bound prolactin receptor (PRLR), which is a member of the cytokine family  of receptors. Binding of PRL to the PRLR induces receptor dimerization and  activation of the constitutively associated Jak2 kinase, which leads to the tyrosine  phosphorylation of the kinase as well as phosphorylation of tyrosine residues on the  PRLR creating recruitment sites for SH2 containing signaling molecules. Among the  signaling molecules recruited to the PRLR/Jak2 complex are the signal transducers  and activators of transcription 5 (Stat5), the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2  and the inhibitory protein SOCS-1. Work in this thesis was performed in order to  understand the molecular basis behind the biological responses to PRL trough  investigating the intracellular signaling mechanisms emanating from the  PRLR. Tyrosine phosphorylation of the PRLR, particularly of the most  C-terminal tyrosine, was shown to play a critical role in the induction of PRL  responsive genes. The mechanism of regulation of signaling activities by the  C-terminal tyrosine of the PRLR was not known. The aim of the doctoral work was to  investigate the signaling mechanisms controlled by the C-terminal tyrosine of the  PRLR. The signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (Stat5)  is an important mediator of PRLR signaling leading to the activation of PRL  responsive genes. Work in this thesis established that Stat5 tyrosine  phosphorylation is independent of PRLR tyrosine phosphorylation, interestingly  however, Stat5 nuclear translocation was directly regulated by the C-terminal  tyrosine of the PRLR. Additionally, the studies demonstrated that the C-terminal  tyrosine is a site for the recruitment of the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2. A  second site for the SHP-2 recruitment was determined to be the adaptor protein Gab2  that is tyrosine phosphorylated in response to PRL stimulation. Furthermore, the  studies illustrate that the C-terminal tyrosine, through recruiting SHP-2  phosphatase, regulates the phosphorylation state of tyrosine 1007 of Jak2 kinase.  Dephosphorylation of tyrosine 1007 in the activation loop of Jak2 by SHP-2 prevents  the association between Jak2 and the inhibitory protein SOCS-1 leading to the  maintenance of Jak2 kinase activity and the prevention of the ubiquitination and  proteasomal degradation of Jak2 as well as the PRLR. Collectively, work in this thesis resolves some of the molecular  mechanisms implicated in PRLR signaling, specifically through the most C-terminal  tyrosine of the PRLR. The findings are not only important for realizing the  molecular basis of PRL physiological actions, such as mammary gland development, but  also for understanding the signaling schemes utilized by members of the cytokine  receptor superfamily.</description><creator>Ali, Samir</creator><contributor>Ali, Suhad (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Biology, Molecular.</subject><title>Role of prolactin receptor tyrosine phosphorylation in intracellular signaling</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rj430535t.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1j92g810n</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Experimental Medicine</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:pc289j50t</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:32:06Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The extent to which translation moulded Middle English romance  as an emerging genre remains largely unexamined. In this dissertation I identify the  principal methodological difficulties that have prevented scholars from giving due  attention to this problem, and offer a case study in which I look at how  translational procedures shaped the romance of Sir Beves of Hampton, a translation  of the Anglo-Norman Boeve de Haumtone . Having outlined the practical difficulties posed by the  intricate textual tradition of Boeve and Beves, the multilingualism of medieval  England, and the scarcity of concrete evidence regarding the audience for Middle  English romance, I focus on methodological issues: the inability of  equivalence-based definitions of translation to accommodate medieval translation  practice, the futility of attempts to demarcate translation from adaptation, and the  difficulty of integrating different textual levels in the study of  translations. In the first two analytical chapters of the dissertation I  concentrate on those aspects of Beves that can best highlight the importance of  translation processes in the constitution of the genre. I begin by examining the way  in which the translator dealt with the most important translational constraints,  some of which, like language, were beyond his control, while others, such as  versification, were partly self-imposed. I then proceed to study the workings of the  so-called laws of translation (explicitation, simplification, and repertorization)  in the process whereby Boeve became Beves. The analyses carried out in these two  chapters allow me to contest the received opinion according to which the author of  Beves treated his original very freely. I show that, on the contrary, the  distinctive features of the Middle English text result from a constant productive  tension between source and target. My study ends with an analysis of what happens when the  translator's impulse to be faithful to his source is frustrated by the  inaccessibility of the socio-historical context of the original. I examine the most  closely translated sections of the poem to show how unrecognized topical references  are flattened into literary cliches, which bring into the text their own generic  connotations and disassemble some of the carefully constructed thematic parallels  and analogies of the Anglo-Norman romance.</description><creator>Djordjevic, Ivana</creator><contributor>Williams, David (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>English literature -- Middle English, 1100-1500 -- History and criticism</subject><subject>Translating and interpreting.</subject><title>Mapping medieval translation : methodological problems and a case study</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vq27zn94h.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pc289j50t</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of English</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><resumptionToken completeListSize="47894">oai_etdms.s(Collection:theses).f(2019-10-16T06:03:34Z).u(2020-07-23T18:55:55Z).t(47894):44775</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>
