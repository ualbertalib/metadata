Refrigerant 22 is used as the test liquid and is depressurized from an initial state of equilibrium using a bursting foil diaphragm. The competition between the rates of venting and vapor generation can lead to substantial repressurization within the vessel. The influence of vent area, quantity of liquid, initial pressure and pre-nucleation on the explosive boiling characteristics has been studied in a 260 ml Teflon-coated vessel as well as in a 75 ml glass tube. The amount of repressurization is found to be proportional to the pressure drop which determines the degree of superheat attained by the liquid. The time for repressurization is typically an order of magnitude larger than the time for the pressure drop. The repressurization in both vessels reaches a maximum value at an initial saturation vapor pressure of $ approx$2 MPa. The dependence of the repressurization on initial pressure observed experimentally is found to be consistent with the predictions of a semi-empirical correlation based on homogeneous nucleation theory. High-speed photography shows that the mode of boiling is dependent on the initial vapor pressure and the surface condition of the vessel walls. Heterogeneous boiling from the walls dominates in the Teflon-coated steel vessel. For initial vapor pressures less than $ approx$1 MPa, an evaporation wave propagates at $ approx$0.15 m/s from the free surface throughout the length of the glass tube. For higher initial vapor pressures the boiling mode in the glass tube becomes predominantly heterogeneous. Pre-nucleation with CO$ sb2$ within the refrigerant increases the boiling response by promoting heterogeneous boiling.</description><creator>Barbone, Riccardo.</creator><contributor>Frost, David (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1994</date><subject>Engineering, Mechanical.</subject><title>Explosive boiling of a depressurized volatile liquid</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/44558g279.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0v838257w</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mechanical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:2801pj36w</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:03:26Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In this paper the compositional issues and techniques employed in my M. Mus. Thesis Composition Nocturnales (for chamber orchestra comprised of fifteen players) is discussed. The piece, constituted of three connected parts, exhibits an eclecticism of musical styles and compositional approaches that comes in part, from the use of different temporal structures. To build such structures, two independent techniques have been developed that organize pitch and rhythm according to some serial procedures, yet are flexible enough to permit local level decisions based on intuitive considerations. The basis of the pitch system is a 1-2-1 tetrachordal set, to which are applied both principles of permutation and a modal treatment. In the rhythm domain, besides the conventional metric divisions of 2 and 3, predetermined numerical rows derived from the Fibonacci series to provide the durational values between event attacks are employed.</description><creator>Moura, Eli-Eri Luiz de</creator><contributor>Lanza, Alcides (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1995</date><subject>Chamber orchestra music -- Scores.</subject><title>Nocturnales : for chamber orchestra</title><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Eli-Eri Luiz de Moura, 1995</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/th83m1550.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2801pj36w</identifier><degree><name>Master of Music</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Faculty of Music</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:c534fq89k</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:03:27Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The airline industry has entered into a new era. It has been under pressure to a regulatory reform from both inside and outside the industry. Traditional bilateralism has been challenged and a liberal regulatory approach has been called for. With the conclusion of the GATS, it seems that no single sector of service should be excluded from its ambit. The extension of GATS principles to the international air transport, especially to "hard right", will require a significant change in approach to trade in air services. It is submitted that the GATS multilateral approach is preferable to the existing regulatory arrangements for the economic regulation of international air transport. ICAO should continue its mission as a regulatory body with respect to technical matters. A true multinational framework for air transport under the WTO would serve consumers and the industry as well.</description><creator>Yang, Jennifer</creator><contributor>Janda, R.

This regime was established by Decisions 297 and 320 and was based on the Colombia-Venezuela Bilateral Air Transport Agreement. It revolutionizes the status quo regarding air transport. The new regime adopts the principles of multiple designation of air carriers, free determination of frequencies and capacities for scheduled air services performed with the Subregion, and complete liberalization for non-scheduled air services. It creates an "Andean subregional market" and promotes the establishment of a "common" position for negotiating intra and extra-regional fifth freedom. Member Countries have been unresponsive in updating their bilateral agreements vis-a-vis the regime set by Decisions 297 and 320. This situation makes the application and healthy development of the Andean Subregional Air Transport Integration process difficult. In order to avoid these difficulties, Member Countries shall apply the supranational principles contained in Decisions 297 and 320 and update their bilateral agreements.

Given that this medical agreement is innominate, we believe that it is essentially a contract for services. Yet what makes it distinctive is the fact that the surgeon operates on a healthy organ. Cosmetic surgery is not a vital necessity but instead is based entirely on aesthetic appearances. In this light, the validation of the contract is handled very differently from a traditional medical contract. The goal of the cosmetic surgery contract is to render surgical services for the purpose of relieving the distress caused by a physical deformity. The capacity to exercise and consent is very restrictive in this field, a factor that is dictated by the non-urgent nature of the surgery and the fact that it leaves permanent results. We can conclude that consent in cosmetic care surgery requires the complete disclosure of risks and obliges the surgeon to refuse the surgery if the risks are disproportionate with its benefits.</description><creator>Hacala, Jean-Daniel</creator><contributor>Crepeau, Paul-Andre (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1995</date><subject>Health Sciences, Medicine and Surgery.</subject><subject>Law.</subject><title>La nature et la validité du contrat de services esthétiques chirurgicaux</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/j6731603b.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ht24wm32d</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Comparative Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:5425kc732</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:03:30Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This Thesis aims to examine recent efforts of the developing countries, within the Legal Subcommittee of the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS), to increase their participation in space activities and in particular, to develop their own indigenous space capabilities. The Thesis will demonstrate that the United Nations is not, given the present economic and political climate, the best forum within which the developing countries should try to develop space law. Chapter 1 examines the main problems facing the developing countries in the transfer of space technology from the technologically advanced states. Chapter 2 examines the legal basis of their claims for greater cooperation. Chapter 3 examines the present debate within COPUOS where the developing countries are attempting to further develop international space law to their advantage. Chapter 4 suggests alternative routes which should be considered by the developing countries in order to work towards greater cooperation which will meet their needs.</description><creator>Ferrier, Jill</creator><contributor>Vlasic, Ivan A.

Before the Second World War economic sanctions had been imposed under the Covenant of the League of Nations. It was, however, only with the creation of the United Nations and the evolution of international human rights law that economic sanctions have been imposed explicitly in the name of human rights. While the Security Council has ordered economic sanctions against Iraq, Haiti and the former Yugoslavia for their human rights violations, the thesis explores the reasons why the Council has not taken similar measures against other countries with comparable human rights records and concludes that, there exists a double standard. Another important issue examined concerns the collateral consequences of economic sanctions. More often than not, it is the civilian population that ends up enduring the harsh conditions that result from the sanctions. The thesis suggests that the economic sanctions imposed for human rights purposes may in fact result in the infringement of the basic human rights of the very population that they are intended to protect.</description><creator>D'Hollander, Juliette</creator><contributor>Vlasic, Ivan (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1995</date><subject>Political Science, International Law and Relations.</subject><title>Economic sanctions as a means to enforce human rights</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6m311r44p.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9s161826s</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Faculty of Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:3484zj77h</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:03:32Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The object of this thesis is to analyze the provisions of the Act respecting protection of personal information in the private sector in an attempt to foresee their impact on the use of medical information by insurance companies.

This review is followed by a study of the historical context and the legislative evolution having led to the adoption of the Act. Legal principles concerning access and use of medical information by insurance companies are studied and, based on those principles, the provisions of the Act respecting the protection of personal information in the private sector are analyzed.

Based on the following literature review, a new and more reasonable model for the research and development (i.e., the R&amp;D) sector--a sector which is considered the source of long-run growth--is offered in order to develop and improve the framework built by Rivera-Batiz and Rome (1991), i.e. the RBR model. This new model will make the RBR framework more complete and rational. In this new model, it is proved that any form of economic integration will increase the long-run rate of growth, and these results are compared with those of the RBR. Moreover, Devereux and Lapham's efforts to find some dynamic analysis along the transitional path under two different situations: knowledge flows only, and both goods and knowledge flows, are continued in the same model. It is found that when only knowledge is allowed to flow across borders, economic integration generates corner solutions for the production of the R&amp;D sector, while this does not happen when complete goods and knowledge flows exist. However, the real balanced growth rates in these diverse situations are higher than they are in autarky.</description><creator>Yin, Xiaopeng, 1963-</creator><contributor>Henning, John (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1995</date><subject>International economic integration.</subject><subject>Economic development -- Mathematical models.</subject><subject>Economic development.</subject><title>The effect of economic integration on endogenous economic growth</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/m613n074m.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/kw52j993s</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Agricultural Economics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:jm214r18t</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:03:33Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Sulfated glycoprotein-2 (SGP-2) is an acidic glycoprotein that has recently been discovered in numerous tissues including brain. This glycoprotein is involved in the response to diverse types of neuronal injury and synaptic remodelling. It is well established that estradiol treatment results in selective destruction of $ beta$-endorphin neurons in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus. The question addressed by this thesis is what effect SGP-2 plays in this estradiol-induced pathology. We have used immunocytochemistry to elucidate the distribution of SGP-2 in the normal and estradiol-lesioned hypothalamus. Unexpectedly, SGP-2-immunopositive perikarya occurred in a highly specific distribution in the normal rat hypothalamus. SGP-2-reactive neurons were localized to the medial preoptic area (MPOA), supraoptic nucleus (SON), paraventricular nucleus (PVN), dorsomedial nucleus (DMN) and perifornical area (PA) of the hypothalamus. Both the male and female hypothalamus exhibited similar distributions. The neuropil as well as small cell profiles consistent with glia appeared free of SGP-2 labelling. Estradiol-induced loss of $ beta$-endorphin resulted in an increase in the number of SGP-2-reactive neurons only within the MPOA. Small cell profiles appeared labelled, after estradiol-valerate (EV) treatment, mainly within the MPOA and immunopositive deposits were associated with the neuropil of the PVN, PA and MPOA. Since, vitamin E, which blocks the neurotoxic effect of estradiol also prevents the EV-induced changes in SGP-2 distribution, the increase of SGP-2-immunopositive cells and presence of neuropil deposits result from the deafferentation engendered by the estradiol-induced lesion rather than a direct effect of estradiol. The exact role SGP-2 plays in the hypothalamus is still unknown, however we suggest SGP-2 acts as a mediator of synaptogenesis in both the normal and pathological states. We conclude that the SGP-2 response in the MPOA is possibly related to the selecti</description><creator>Wener, Kenneth Michael</creator><contributor>Brawer, James R.

Measurements were also made of turbulent temperature inside a corn canopy and at the canopy top. The 500Hz temperature time series were collected over periods of varying intervals, to a maximum of 24 hours. The multifractal analysis was performed on several datasets. First scaling properties of the temperature and the velocity fields were examined. Our results suggest that scaling is not observed throughout the entire range but on different regimes. The physically related regimes corresponding to the clipped grass experiment include the inertial subrange, the trend for diurnal peak, and a range between them, all together featuring the existence of the hourly gap. In the canopy experiment, except for the above feature, the effects of the presence of plant objects are also reflected by the presence of two regimes different from those for clipped grass field. The double trace moment technique was performed on the inertial subrange of the temperature and velocity fields measured over clipped grass to obtain the parameters characterizing the multifractal fields. The variability of the parameters with the atmospheric stability was investigated and no apparent difference between stable and unstable conditions was found. The results reveal that those fields are universal multifractals with the characteristic parameters $ alpha$ near 1.7 and C$ sb1$ ranging from 0.04 to 0.12, implying that the fields can be modeled by a log-Levy process with unbounded singularities. We also found that the critical moment q$ rm sb{s}$ for the multifractal phase transition is close to 4.</description><creator>Wang, Yu, 1964-</creator><contributor>Leclerc, Monique (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1995</date><subject>Atmospheric turbulence.</subject><subject>Atmospheric temperature.</subject><subject>Multifractals.</subject><subject>Boundary layer (Meteorology)</subject><subject>Winds -- Speed -- Measurement.</subject><title>Measurements and multifractal analysis of turbulent temperature and velocity near the ground</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kd17cw100.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/n296x1194</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Natural Resource Sciences</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:ww72bd724</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:03:35Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In this study, a rapidly east-coastal cyclogenesis event that took place during 3-4 October 1987 is investigated using a nested-grid version of the Penn State/NCAR mesoscale model (MM4) with a fine mesh grid size of 25 km. It is shown that the MM4 model reproduces reasonably well the growth of the cyclone from a coastal frontal zone, its subsequent track, intensity, circulation structures and its associated precipitation. It is found that the coastal cyclogenesis occurs in a favorable large-scale environment with pronounced thermal advection in the lower troposphere and marked potential vorticity (PV) concentration aloft associated with the tropopause depression. The transport of warm and moist air from the marine boundary layer by the low-level inshore flow provides the necessary latent energy for the production of the observed heavy precipitation and a variety of weather phenomena. A series of 24-h sensitivity simulations are performed to examine the relative importance of diabatic heating, large-scale forcing and the quality of initial conditions in the cyclogenesis.

Frequency histograms of the rise and decay times of the current spikes showed a paucity of very short duration events. Scatterograms of the rise and decay times consistently showed a positive relation, and the best fitted lines intercepted the ordinate (the axis of the decay time) at: 16.06 $ pm$ 6.45 msec (n = 11). The effect of temperature changes upon the time course of release of content of individual vesicles in chromaffin cells was also examined. The amplitudes of the current spikes did not change significantly, whereas the rise times and the decay times diminished from (23.2 $ pm$ 11.6 to 11.9 $ pm$ 2.7 msec, and from 76.6 $ pm$ 25.4 to 47.3 $ pm$ 9.3 msec respectively) as the temperature was raised from 15$ sp circ$C to 35$ sp circ$C (n = 5). Nevertheless, the Q$ sb{10}$ values of the rise and decay times were surprisingly low. The experimental findings suggest that in bovine chromaffin cells the duration of the release of content of single vesicles is much longer than in synapses. The results also suggest that this mechanism does not involve processes that are strongly temperature sensitive.</description><creator>Walker, Angela</creator><contributor>Glavinovic, M. I.

The program provides a user-friendly and flexible interface for visualizing particle dynamics using phase space diagrams, which are essential for complete understanding of a beam optics system. The program performs an accurate finite difference computation of a user-defined boundary value problem (in the form of a grid) followed by a high-order Runge-Kutta numerical integration of the equations of motion to evaluate the particle dynamics within the field. The program is unique in its combination of these flexible finite calculation techniques with the parallel processing of particle ensembles in order to display phase space diagrams. After extensive testing, the program has been used to design a low emittance ion source and an ion beam deceleration system for high-efficiency ion collection. The program has also been used to analyze a radiofrequency quadrupole collisional focusing system using ion mobility concepts.</description><creator>Varfalvy, Peter</creator><contributor>Moore, R. B.

These costs may vary for each product and each period and are all linear. Our model includes setup times for each product. We compare two approaches: a classic Lagrangean relaxation of the capacity constraints and a Lagrangean decomposition by variable splitting. In both cases, the Lagrangean multipliers are updated with an interior point cutting plane technique. The results show: (1) The superiority of the interior point method over the commonly used subgradient optimization in terms of accuracy at termination, number of iterations and ease of utilization. (2) The better quality of the bounds obtained by the Lagrangean decomposition by variable splitting over the Lagrangean relaxation.</description><creator>Trouiller, Cyril</creator><contributor>Goffin, J.

Haglin and C. Gale, and a more recent covariant formalism developed by P. Lichard, for lepton pair production via soft virtual bremsstrahlung in hadronic reactions. A quantitative study of the discrepancy between both formalisms with regard to rates and total yields of $e sp{+}e sp{-}$ and $ mu sp{+} mu sp{-}$ pair production from radiative pion and quark (antiquark) scattering in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions is made. Dilepton production rates are calculated using the independent particle approximation from kinetic theory, and total dilepton yields are obtained by integrating these rates over the space-time evolution of the heavy-ion collision as dictated by Bjorken's longitudinal hydrodynamic model. All rates and total yields of $e sp{+}e sp{-}$ and $ mu sp{+} mu sp{-}$ pair production with invariant masses less than 300 MeV turn out to be overestimated in the Ruckl formula-based formalism.</description><creator>Tabti, Rahma</creator><contributor>Gale, Charles (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1995</date><subject>Physics, Elementary Particles and High Energy.</subject><subject>Physics, Nuclear.</subject><title>Soft dilepton production in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cv43p023p.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ms35tb525</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Physics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:ft848s53n</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:03:39Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Vocalization behavior of captive loggerhead shrikes was studied at the Avian Science and Conservation Centre of McGill University. In the first stage, calls of two pairs kept in indoor cages were individually recorded not only to catalogue these calls spectrographically and quantitatively but also to use them in identifying the birds sexually. Males vocalized 21 call figures for 16.50% of the observation time and females, 8 call figures for 2.64% of the observation time. Males contiguously delivered 1 to 11 bouts with a mean of 7.25 min for a rate of 6.06 bouts/h; females delivered 1 to 9 bouts with a mean of 4.07 min for a rate of 1.27 bouts/h. Males not only vocalized at a higher rate and longer than females, but also demonstrated trill calls which the females did not do. In the second stage, five pairs were paired in large outdoor breeding pens. Their calls were recorded and current visual displays observed in an effort to understand calls related to breeding behaviors. Two new calls figures vocalized by males as well as 2 call figures by young shrikes were recorded. Each male demonstrated distinctive calls that differed from those of other males during nest-site selection, nest building and copulation, but similar calls during food offering, aggressive and alarm behavior. Despite the call differences, all males performed similar visual displays during the above activities. Conversely, breeding females gave no calls, other than harsh calls during food offering, food begging, aggressive and alarm behaviors.</description><creator>Soendjoto, Mochamad Arief</creator><contributor>Bird, D.

Flesinoxan (7 and 14 $ mu$g/kg) administered intravenously in 11 healthy volunteers, elicited a dose-related decrease in body temperature and an increase in growth hormone, ACTH, cortisol and prolactin plasma levels. In a second independent study, 12 healthy volunteers were pretreated with either the 5-HT$ sb{ rm 1A}$ antagonist pindolol (30 mg, p.o.), the non-selective 5-HT$ sb1$-5-HT$ sb2$ antagonist, methysergide (4 mg, p.o.), or placebo prior to being administered of flesinoxan (1 mg, i.v.). The growth hormone response to flesinoxan was blocked by pindolol but not by methysergide whereas the prolactin response was blocked by methysergide but not by pindolol. The ACTH and cortisol response to flesinoxan were potentiated by methysergide. The flesinoxan-induced hypothermia was attenuated by both methysergide and pindolol, although the latter effect did not reach statistical significance. The present results suggest that the growth hormone response, and to a lesser extent the hypothermic response to intravenous infusion of flesinoxan may serve as a valid index of 5-HT$ sb{ rm 1A}$ receptor function in human.</description><creator>Seletti, Bernard</creator><date>1994</date><subject>Health Sciences, Pharmacology.</subject><subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</subject><title>Serotonin 1A receptor activation by flesinoxan in humans : body temperature and neuroendocrine responses</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qf85nd18b.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xk81jn57w</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Psychiatry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:qz20sv86k</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:03:41Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Pseudomonas fragi CRDA 037 was used to produce both intracellular and extracellular lipases. The crude lipase fractions were fractionated using ammonium sulfate to obtain partially purified intracellular and extracellular lipases; the fraction precipitated at 20-60% of saturation of the intracellular proteins was retained as the source of the endolipase, whereas the culture medium precipitated at 20-40% of saturation, was used as the source of exolipase. Native gel electrophoresis (PAGE) suggested that the partially purified extracellular lipase has a molecular weight of 25,500 Da. Three major electrophoretic bands were present in the intracellular lipase fraction at 70,000, 49,000, and 35,500 Da. The partially purified lipases were characterized with respect to their optimum pH and temperature for lipase activity, and well as for their kinetics, specificities, and reactions toward inhibitors. The optimum pH for the activity of the endolipase was found to be 9.0 whereas that of the exolipase was 8.75. With respect to optimum temperature, 30$ sp circ$C was determined to be the best for the endolipase while 35$ sp circ$C was the optimal value for the exolipase. Enzyme specificity was carried out using triacetin, tributyrin, trimyristin, and triolein as substrates. The results for the exolipase indicated that the lowest K$ sb{m}$ was obtained with trimyristin and the highest K$ sb{m}$ was obtained with triolein whereas for the endolipase, the highest K$ sb{m}$ was obtained with tributyrin and the lowest was with trimyristin. Experiments carried out with inhibitors indicated that both lipases are serine lipases, sulfydryl enzymes, and that tryptophan is essential for maintaining the conformation of the proteins. The most potent inhibitor was ferrous chloride, and sodium deoxycholate was a weak inhibitor for both lipases, however, it was an activator at low concentrations for the exolipase.</description><creator>Schuepp, Catherine</creator><contributor>Kermasha, Selim (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1995</date><subject>Pseudomonas fragi.</subject><subject>Lipase -- Separation.</subject><title>Partial purification and characterization of lipases from Pseudomonas fragi</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5999n5343.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qz20sv86k</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Food Science and Agricultural Chemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:h702q8376</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:03:41Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>CH$ sb4$ and CO$ sb2$ fluxes were measured in upland boreal forest soils, over the period May 16$ sp{ rm th}$ through Sept. 16$ sp{ rm th}$, 1994, among a variety of vegetation and drainage characteristics. Most upland soils consumed CH$ sb4$, (0.6 to $-$2.6 mg CH$ sb4$ m$ sp{-2}$ d$ sp{-1}$), and produced CO$ sb2$, (0.2 to 26.8 g CO$ sb2$ m$ sp{-2}$ d$ sp{-1}$). CH$ sb4$ consumption showed no seasonal trend, however CO$ sb2$ flux displayed an increasing rate until late August, after which flux rates began to decrease. Differences among the sites examined showed soil temperature and organic matter content to be the primary controls in predicting seasonal mean CH$ sb4$ flux rates. Similarly for CO$ sb2$ flux, soil temperature and C content proved to be the best predictors of seasonal mean differences among the range of sites examined. Sites could be divided into 2 categories, strong CH$ sb4$ consuming and CO$ sb2$ producing sites, Gillam Aspen, Gillam Pine, OBS Aspen, Burn Moss, Palsa Birch, and YJP Dry and weak CH$ sb4$ consuming and CO$ sb2$ producing sites, Gillam Spruce, OBS Spruce, YJP Wet, Burn Spruce and Palsa Moss. The strong flux sites all exhibited similar trends in soil characteristics as they were the warmest, driest sites with faster nutrient cycling processes and thin ($ sim$2 to 10 cm) organic layers. The weak flux sites were colder, wetter, with slower nutrient cycling, and a thick organic/peat layer ($ sim$20 to 50 cm). The primary visual distinction between these two groups was the presence of a Sphagnum sp. ground cover, which was characteristic of weak CH$ sb4$ consuming and CO$ sb2$ producing sites.</description><creator>Savage, Kathleen, 1967-</creator><contributor>Moore, T.

Two procedures which fulfill both objectives are (i) application of high hydrostatic pressure, and (ii) utilization of protease inhibitor to control fresh fish spoilage due to microbial activity and/or autolysis by endogenous enzymes. High hydrostatic pressure has been used to formulate gels with superior functional properties, while $ alpha sb2$-macroglobulin, a broad spectrum protease inhibitor, has been added to control proteolysis in fish gels during processing and storage. In this study, high pressure was applied at levels of 300 to 3,742 atm for 30 min to formulate gels from bluefish meat paste, and the properties of the resulting gels were compared with those of heat-induced gels formulated at 90$ sp circ$C for 20 min or 60$ sp circ$C for 60 min. The effects of $ alpha sb2$-macroglobulin and cooking temperatures on the properties of tilapia gels were also studied.

The venational data were then combined with published studies of other character suites to produce a hypothesis of phylogenetic relationships among apocritan superfamilies and families. Whereas the cladograms obtained from the collection of papers on character suites provide strong support for the sister group relationship between Orussidae and Apocrita, the ones derived from wing venation did not establish such a relationship, although they provided more support for relationships within Apocrita. A ground plan is proposed for the wing venation of each taxon examined; for Apocrita, it is close to the groundplan established for Aculeata. The variability of wing venation is higher between and within apocritan taxa than in Symphyta. This research confirms that groupings such as the Symphyta, Siricoidea, Evanioidea and possibly the Proctorupoidea are artificial.</description><creator>Roy, Alain, 1968 May 11-</creator><date>1995</date><subject>Hymenoptera -- Classification.</subject><subject>Wings.</subject><title>Phylogenetic study of Apocrita (Hymenoptera) with emphasis on wing venation</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/th83m1568.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4j03d2072</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Natural Resource Sciences</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:qr46r3058</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:03:44Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Quality of measurement is a fundamental issue in medical research and clinical practice, of relevance for any inference or decision-making process. Reliability, as an estimate of the variability in the domain of repeated measurements, is an important component of the quality of measurements. Reliability indices are frequently used and presented in the medical literature and a considerable amount of methodological research has been conducted on this topic in the last decades. However, the debate is still open on some theoretical and operational aspects. Available knowledge concerning reliability, particularly for categorical data, is not easily accessible since it is often confined to specialized journals and almost disregarded by statistical textbooks. Therefore, a thorough understanding is difficult to achieve for a researcher potentially involved in reliability studies. My main objective was to pursue a conceptual and global understanding of the role of reliability in the domain of categorical data. In order to achieve this goal I reviewed and synthesized the literature according to some specific objectives: (a) to provide an overview on the founding concepts and methods in the measurement of reliability for categorical variables, also contrasting them with what has been done in the domain of continuous variables; (b) to present and discuss the main limitations of traditional indices, particularly the kappa statistic; (c) to briefly introduce some possible alternative methods and areas for future development; (d) to emphasize the implications of reliability for epidemiological and clinical research. Finally, in order to illustrate the application of some of the methods discussed, I used a real set of data, concerning 209 slides of lymphomas tissue samples, reviewed by a panel of four pathologists, according to a standard classification based on 10 categories.</description><creator>Rodella, Stefania</creator><contributor>Haneey, Jim (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1996</date><subject>Health Sciences, General.</subject><subject>Biology, Biostatistics.</subject><title>Exploring reliability in epidemiology and clinical research</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/hq37vq51c.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qr46r3058</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:br86b542s</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:03:44Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In parallel programming, loop computation is one of the most expensive operations in terms of execution duration. In order to solve this problem their parallelization is compulsory. One form of parallelization is for a compiler to automatically produce a parallel SPMD (Single Program Multiple Data) program. These compilation techniques encompass both compile-time and run-time resolution methods. This thesis presents a specific case of the run-time resolution of the loops, the independent loops. These loops do not have any interactions between their iterations, hence they have a great potential for parallelism. This work presents an experimental method which has been developed in the EPPP ("Environment de programmation parallele portable") project at the Centre de Recherche Informatique de Montreal. The development of the independent loops uses active messages, based on a particular buffering method, and uses also multi-threading. The implementation of the active messages is done on several types of communications libraries, in order to ensure the portability of the EPPP environment. The use of buffers considerably decreases the communications required during the calculation of the independent loops. Finally, the multi-threading system is used to suppress the idle-time appearing when a processor is waiting for some data issued by a remote processor. This thesis provides a description of the techniques and experimental data to show their applicability.</description><creator>Roque, Jean-Michel</creator><contributor>Hendren, L.
