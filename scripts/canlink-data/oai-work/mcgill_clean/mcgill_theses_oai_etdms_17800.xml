The subsequent work consisted of the determination of the chemical characteristics of this material, improvements in its preparation and its oxidation with the technical bleaching agents, chlorine dioxide and sodium hypochlorite. The stable end-product obtained in about 30% yield by the latter method, and termed oxylignin, has been subjected over the period of the last 8 years to an extensive study.</description><creator>Wieckowski, Erwin.</creator><contributor>Purves, C.

Some of the relationships have been discussed in the reviews published by Lapage, (1937), von Brand, (1952), Hunter, (1953) and Smith, (1955). In the association as seen and described by field workers, there is likely to be some confusion of cause and effect because, in the human field, areas where parasitism is most serious - in the backward tropical and sub-tropical countries where overcrowding, lack of sanitation, poverty and illiteracy are the rule, both under-nutrition and malnutrition are almost universal.</description><creator>Whitten, Lloyd.

The 180° scattering -technique for proton irradiation was advanced to give optimum energy resolution. The reaction O16(p,a)N13 exhibited three large peaks at proton energies of 8.6 Mev, 11.3 Mev and 14.6 Mev. The maximum cross sections were 46 mb, 55 mb, and 45 mb for the three peaks respectively. Evidence suggested that unresolved peaks existed at 12.2 Mev and 12.8 Mev.

The German Physiologist Friedrich Merkel  (1883), in the introduction to his thesis on Salivary Ducts wrote:- “The fact that organs which are secreting show microscopic changes in the structure of the secretory cells leads to a new approach in histological research. Examination of secretory organs is unthinkable without evaluation of the specific Physiological state and its relation to the morphology.

These quantities have been observed in a temperature range from room temperature (liquid state) dawn to - 165°C, (solid state). All the solids studied exhibit phase transitions which are either of the rotational type or order-disorder type. Relaxation measurements provide a clear cut decision for this.

In subsequent work on this toxin-neutralizing agent, Diena (1954 and 1956) developed a method of purifying the toxin-neutralizing substance and established that it neutralized a wide spectrum of bacterial toxins. The toxin neutralizing substance derived from culture filtrates of P. cyaneo-fulvum has been designated Noxiversin.

One species on cattle is Chorioptes bovis (Héring, 1845) Gervais and Van Beneden, 1859. This mite has been incriminated as the cause of most clinical cases of mange reported in Canada during the past 20 years, although a few outbreaks of psoroptic, sarcoptic and demodectic acariasis were noted also. The last three kinds of mange are often severe and sometimes generalized, but chorioptic mange is generally mild and frequently restricted to small patches on the hind quarters.</description><creator>Sweatman, Gordon.

Other methods of treating lignins have produced compounds containing a phenylpropane nucleus. Since the bleaching of chemical wood pulps by alkaline hypochlorite involves a degradative attack on lignin, it was thought desirable to investigate the action of this reagent on the phenolic types known to be isolated from lignins.</description><creator>Sutherland, Charlotte.

The history of the Island shows that for centuries, political, economic and cultural factors have combined to perpetuate this situation. In the earliest stages of development after the discovery of the Island, settlement was discouraged and in fact at times forbidden by laws which were initiated at the instigation of certain West Country merchants in England, who sought monopolistic rights to these prolific fishing grounds.</description><creator>Summers, William.

Clinical observations by endocrinologists have shown that both endocrine deficits and excesses may be associated with changes in "personality." Cushing's syndrome in adults is frequently associated with characteristic depressive states, and in Addison's disease apathy and lack of initiative are apparent. Other syndromes such as hypopanpituitarism, male and female climacteric, and thyroid imbalance are also characterized by personality changes. With appropriate endocrine therapy, these behavioral symptoms usually lessen or disappear.</description><creator>Stern, Muriel. H.</creator><contributor>Bindra, D.
