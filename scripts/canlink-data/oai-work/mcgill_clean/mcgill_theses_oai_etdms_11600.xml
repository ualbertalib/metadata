(SN2 mechanism) In acetone-water, “S” dimerizes at a rate independent of “S” concentration. With increasing water concentration, a simultaneous increase in E and rate occurs. At low temperatures dimerization is the main reaction with some hydrolysis. The hydrolysis of the SH+ ion in a variety of acids in excess shows inhibition by both H+ and Cl-. Mechanisms are proposed for the reactions studied. Deacidification of RDX-B has been found possible by heating the solid in the systems nitrobenzene-water and TNT-water. Deacidification is also possible by heating RDX-B dry or in water slurry above 1200C. The acidity in RDX-B is not due to HNO3 or Ac2O, and only partly due to HOAc. The acidic component is mainly some compound, as yet undetermined, which readily hydrolyses to give N20, CO2, and other products of non-acidic character.</description><creator>Hardwick, Thomas James.</creator><contributor>Winkler, C.

The results showed that the phenomenon of viscosity instability is of a general nature, occurring with all polymers in all the solvents. Dissolved oxygen reacts with the polymers causing viscosity decreases. Iron salts catalyze this reaction, and also combine chemically with the polymer to cause viscosity increases and gel formation. That the above changes are due to a change in molecular weight of the polymers has been demonstrated by measurement of the intrinsic viscosities of recovered polymer samples.

It is the purpose of the present study to trace this history, as far as that may be ascertained from the materials at our disposal. In claiming this purpose, the author desires to differentiate his task from that of the many compilers of handbooks to whom he is indebted. It may Suffice for a compendium of Greek mythology to present all the variant forms of a myth, while making adequate reference to the literary sources of such variants; indeed, the limitations of space may well excuse any encyclopaedist from doing more than this within the compass of a single volume. A more ambitious work, extending into several bulky volumes, may even arrange the literary references to any one myth in chronological order; but that does not give us the history of the myth. The aim of this present treatment is not simply to chronicle the many literary allusions to Prometheus, but also to attempt some explanation of the more significant stages in the development of the myth.[...]</description><creator>MacPherson, John.</creator><contributor>Woodhead, W.

The accurate determination of molecular weight is therefore prerequisite to advances in this branch of cherndstry (1). In view of the inadequacy of classical organo-analytical methods, physico-chendcal methods have assumed paramount importance. These methods· include data from the ultra-centrifuge, osmotic pressures, viscosity, lowering of freezing points, etc. Of these, lowering of freezing point can not be used for molecular weights above 5000, at which point the order of magnitude of the effect becomes so small as to make its use impracticable. The ultra-centrifuge is lindted in use on account of the large initial expense of the apparatus. The viscosity method, as a result of its extreme simplicity, has been used extensively in industry. However, the inherent uncertainty as to the interpretation of the results limits its value very strictly. The present work, therefore, in addition to viscometric data, includes the use of the osmotic method, which suffers tram the foregoing difficulties to a much less extent.[...]</description><creator>Wise, Louis Maxwell.</creator><contributor>Maass, O.

Although, as Kimball Young (76) has pointed out, the topic bore a close resemblance to the futile and fruitless "chicken or egg" controversy, its existence was justified in that it was instrumental in attracting the attention of men to the importance of studying the phenomenon of leadership. During the past few decades political organizations, industry, labor, and the military have recognized the importance of leadership in the further development of their causes. Concomitantly, there has developed an awareness of the necessity of training for leadership. Bogardus (7), Partridge (62) and Lindeman (38) have stressed that leadership is an important phenomenon in a democracy, and that we must train for leadership.[...]</description><creator>Hymovitch, Bernard.</creator><contributor>Webster, E.

The explanation of this fact is to be found mainly in the belief, prevalent then, that edttcation was not one of the functions  of government. The only form of instruction in which the central government showed any interest was that given in the schools of industry; these were the sole educational institutions supported by government taxation. 2 It is true that, as ,. the century advanced, voices began to be heard urging that the government should institute a national system of education.</description><creator>Hunter, Gerald Fulton Henderson.</creator><contributor>Files, H.

This work has been carried out in cooperation between the Departments of Agronomy and Plant Pathology. The months of August and September are critical with respect to brown heart development. The disorder is positively correlated with the amount of precipitation received during these two months and negatively correlated with the hours of sunshine. Brown heart develops very rapidly with the greatest increase occurring over a one to two week period in the middle of August. The varieties Corning and Ditmars possess a fair degree of resistance. Borax sprays applied to the foliage are superior to soil applicitions of borax as a method of controlling brown heart. Potassiurn accentuated boron deficiency in sand cultures, but in the single field trial reported its effect was not significant.Roots that are selected for seed production should be free or brown heart.</description><creator>Hanson, A.

In practice, it has been found necessary to stop the reaction af'ter 80% conversion of the monomers. owing to formation of insoluble gel at higher conversions. Hence, recovery of unreaoted monomers from the reaction system is an economic necessity, representing a considerable proportion of the plant equipment and operation encountered in commercial production of the polymer. In both the styrene and the butadiene recovery systems insoluble, so-called, popcorn polymers are for.med which differ from the previously known polymers of' these compounds whose properties have been extensively investigated (1).[...]</description><creator>Graham, Wilfred.</creator><contributor>Winkler, C.

The energy is transferred from the boron atom by collisions between the atoms of the two elements. In an arc the concentration of the dampening eleffient depends upon the volatility of the compound form1in which it is used, and the reduction caused therefor varies from compound to compound. This is not so for the spark. The addition of a third element with a line of just shorter wavelength than both the boron and the dampening line and which is excited at the voltage beine used, lessens the dampening effect.</description><creator>Girdwood, Barbara Mabel.</creator><contributor>Foster, J.

One of the avenues of approach was that of high temperature, vapor-phase catalysis. By this means, the production of olefins, alcohols, ketones, aldehydes, esters, and the carrying out of a variety of other types of organic reactions has been accomplished. It has believed that this type of reaction might be a fruitful source of both butadiene and styrene, the chief components of the particular synthetic rubber favored by the Government in its program.</description><creator>Stinton, Arthur Walter.</creator><contributor>Nicholls, R.

It seemed most likely that these properties would be obtained in a nitrated polymeric compound. The polyamides of succinic, malic, and tartaric acids were prepared, and the products of their nitration were investigated. It was found that a satisfactory succinic acid - ethylene diamine polymer could be prepared, and could easily be nitrated. The product, though possessive of detonating qualities, was not adequately stable for use as a military explosive. DiffiCulties were encountered in the preparation of satisfactory polymers from maliC and tartaric acids with ethylene diamine, due to the presence of the substituent hydroxy groups. However, an interesting and original study of the relative behaviour of these compounds was made.</description><creator>Smith, Melvin Jonathon.</creator><contributor>Nicholls, R.

For each set of conditions, three curves have been obtained on the basis of ammonia consumed, formaldehyde consumed and material precipitated with mercuric chloride. At o0 c. the three rate curves tend to approximate one another in a large excess of runmonia but are widelg separated in excess formaldehyde. The reverse is true at 35 c. The reaction is characterized by a high initial rate of formation of hexamine, this rapid rate being maintained to a lower yield of hexamine the more dilute the solution. Ihe existence of a stable by-product in excess formaldehyde is indicated by the variation in final yields of hexamine, when these are calculated on the basis of formaldehyde consumed, ammonia consumed, or material precipitated by mercuric chloride.[...]</description><creator>Boyd, Mary Lillian.</creator><contributor>Winkler, C.
