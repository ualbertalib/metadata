The east-west boundary between the County and the Territory of Quebec crosses the area. The writer was engaged by the Quebec Bureau of Mines to map the geology of this area during the summer of 1939 and was in the field for about four months. During that time the shores of the principal lakes and rivers were examined and the intervening ground covered by means of pace and compass traverses. The land traverses were in general spaced at intervals of about half a mile, but certain areas thought to be practically devoid of outcrops were avoided, or covered only by widely-spaced traverses. Aeroplane photographs of the district were of considerable assistance in the organization of the work. [...]</description><creator>Milner, R. L. (Robert L.)</creator><contributor>Osborne, F.

The population density and wide distribution of the insect, as well as the ring pattern of spruce trees, indicated that the insect had been present in large numbers for several years prior to 1930. SubseQuently, museum specimens taken near Ottawa in 1922 and in New Hampshire in 1929 were identified as D. polytomum, showing that the species had a wide distribution throughout eastern North America before its discovery in the relatively inaccessible interior of the Gaspé Peninsula.

This is the first time the mechanism of Ingold and co-workers for such decompositions has been tested in a convincing way. The absence of rearranged products, and of saturated or cyclic hydrocarbons indicates unequivocally that the decomposition proceeds, not through free radical formation, but by expulsion of a proton, probably induced by preliminary hydrogen bonding, followed by rupture of the carbon-nitrogen bond.

The water and cement combine by the process of hydration, and this combination binds the aggregates together into a solid mass. The resulting product is hard, durable, strong in compression and shear, but very weak in tension and, when not reinforced, can be adapted for use only as relatively massive members to be subjected to compression. But in combination with steel rods properly placed to resist the tensile stresses, concrete can be used for all types of structures. In the construction of huge dams and buildings it has proved its permanence. The principal requirements - strength and durability - are the governing considerations in the design of mixtures. Since the discovery of concrete, different theories for its proportioning and various procedures for its control have been proposed, the purpose being to secure a high quality of concrete. Through years of investigation and practice, it has been found that the Water-Cement Ratio Law is the most applicable method for the mixing of concrete under ordinary conditions.

The maximum field strengths were in excess of 250 kV./cm. 3. Eighty-one lines were photographed in nickel, all of which were found to be undisplaced. 4. Thirty-five copper lines were photographed, of which 17 are displaced. The Stark effect increases fairly rapidly with increasing term number. 5. Several corrections are made to the observations of previous investigators in this field. 6. Displaced and undisplaced levels are classified for copper and displacements are predicted for lines not photographed. 7. Undisplaced levels for nickel are classified. The existance of a new odd 2P term for Cu is suggested. 9. Several lines in the copper arc spectrum are shown to be due to the small electric field existing in the arc. 10. It has been found that the intensity of the spectra obtained is a function of the diameter of the cathode dark space, and, in order to bring out important lines in copper, nickel and silver a cathode diameter of 3 mm. was required.</description><creator>Shugar, David.</creator><contributor>Foster, J.

Plutarch was concerned with the era in which his men lived; in his works the times are brought out and the individual stands in the background.

A study has been made of the effects on fat, carbohydrate and protein metabolism following the administration to mice {dba) of certain extracts of the anterior pituitary gland. It has been observed that fatty infiltration of the liver is invariably associated with ketosis. All the extracts studied resulted in an increase in the storage of glycogen and a decrease in the total fat content of the body whenever ketogenic activity was present, indicative of an enhanced oxidation of fat. The experimental results are of both a confirmatory and a supplementary nature.</description><creator>Stewart, Gordon Stafford.</creator><contributor>Collip, J.

The nature of the action of calcium bisulphite liquor is outlined in particular and a comparison between it and the other cooking liquors is made. The possible advantages to be derived from the use of sodium bisulphite cooking liquor instead of the other industrially used cooking liquors is mentioned. Providing a method of recovery can be developed, the industrial importance of sodium bisulphite cooking liquor is apparent, and therefore work along the nature of this investigation is worthy of consideration both from a scientific and economic viewpoint.

Advances have been made with respect to prophylaxis and treatment in diphtheria and to a much less extent in measles. Whooping cough, however, has not shared in this-advance so satisfactorily. The lack of unanimity of opinion concerning the use of vaocines for active immunity and sera for passive immunity has led to a general apathy in regard to any attempt to conduct a systematic campaign toward the conquest of this disease. The very high mortality rate from whooping cough in the ranks of the infant and pre-school child makes this disease one of major importance from the standpoint of public health. In view of the inadequacy of exact know~edge concerning Haemophilus pertussis and the mechanism involved in the disease process, it appeared timely to pursue this problem by planned experimentation in order to clarify existing misconceptions and to present data which might alter the treatment of this disease. While this work has brought to light a few heretofore unknown facts in regard to Haemophilus pertussis and its metabolism, it is to be regarded only as a foundation for further study on this very important subject.</description><creator>Strean, Lyon P.</creator><contributor>Smith, F.

They form the major portion of all plant growth. In reality, cellulose is the backbone of plant structure. Since it occurs in such immense quantities and is comparatively inactive chemically, it is of utmost importance in our commercial life, forming as it does, the mainstay of the pulp, paper and textile industries. Its modified forms are used in a wide array of products from rayon silk and celluloid to high explosives. In any investigation into the properties of cellulosic substances and their relation to water, it is of importance to have some insight into the organic structure of cellulose aven though much of the nature of callulose concerns its physico-chemical properties, such as fibre structure, strength, swelling behaviour and dielectric properties. Only by the combining of these two phases, organic and physico-chemical, may it be hoped to give satisfactory explanation of the results of such an investigation.

Thwing (1) attempted to measure the entire range of binary mixtures of acetic acid in water but encountered considerable difficulty in making oapacitance measurement because of the conductance effect. Mixtures containing less than 30% acetic acid gave the most uncertain results. These dielectric constants were measured by the bridge method whioh is suitable for conductive materials. Dielectric constants of aqueous solutions of various electrolytes have been determined largely by the resonance and the Furth (2) ellipsoid methods.

Since then, suggestibility has been studied by workers in various fields: abnormal psychology, social psychology, sociology and individual differences. The exponents of the Nancy theory of hypnosis, who consider that the hypnotic trance is a "state of heightened suggestibility," of course studied suggestibility as an abnormal phenomenon. Murphy and Murphy (231, p.5) writing as social psychologists consider that the experimental study of suggestion marked the beginning of experimental social psychology. Various sociologists treat "mob suggestion," propaganda, and similar phenomena as illustrating the social aspects of suggestion. And those who take their cue from Alfred Binet in this field, treat suggestibility as a problem in individual differences.
