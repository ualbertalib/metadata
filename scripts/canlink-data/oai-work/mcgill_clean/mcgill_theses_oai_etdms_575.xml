This thesis presents the design, implementation and measured results of a 5th-order switched-current Chebyshev filter. The filter's signal-flow-graph is derived from an LC ladder and is composed of basic building blocks of bilinear integrators. The design process by which this is achieved is the subject of one chapter. These bilinear integrators are based upon a novel switched-current integrator designed by the author. Using models from Northern Telecom's 1.2 $ mu$m CMOS4S process, simulation results of the filter, the novel switched-current integrator and its building block of switched-current memory cells will be shown and compared with the experimentally measured results.</description><creator>Song, Irene</creator><contributor>Roberts, G.

Unlike other IC circuit techniques, the SI technique can realize analog functions using only MOS transistors without the need of any resistor, capacitor or other linear component. This is beneficial to the IC community at large, as mixed-signal IC's can now be realized using a standard digital CMOS process. SI circuits are classified into two groups: first or second-generation, duly named to correspond to the time of their introduction. On account of circuits that have been proposed over the past five years, this thesis will attempt to determine which circuits are better and what design strategy IC designers should follow when working with SI circuits. Specifically, this thesis will investigate the linear and non-linear behaviors of the various SI circuits using a relatively new frequency-domain analysis technique. Finally, to verify the simulation results, two second-order SI filters were designed, laid-out and fabricated using first and second-generation cells in a 1.2 $ mu$m CMOS process.

Such ailments cause selective deficits among the different neural colour and luminance coding mechanisms at the post-receptoral level. These mechanisms consist of varying combinations of inputs from the three cone types (L, M, S) responsible for phototransduction in the human visual system. An efficient colour test can measure the sensitivities of these mechanisms independently. In order to achieve this, precise estimates of the cone inputs (or cone weightings) to these mechanisms need to be obtained. We obtained these estimates through measurement of contrast detection thresholds for sinusoidal gratings in 69 different axes in colour space in three normal human subjects. The colour space used (cone contrast space) permitted direct estimation of the cone weightings from the threshold information. We sensitized each mechanism in turn by varying the spatiotemporal properties of the grating. At each spatiotemporal condition, planar and three-dimensional "super-elliptical" fits were made to the threshold data. The cone weightings of the sensitized mechanism were obtained directly from the parameters of these fits.

A detailed sampling program was conducted on the grinding and gravity circuits. To evaluate the size-by-size unit performance of Knelson Concentrators of 76 and 51 cm, an HG-7 Mineral Deposit spiral and four Denver Duplex mineral jigs (0.6 m x 0.9 m), total and gravity recoverable (determined by the LKC) gold content were measured in their feed, concentrate and tails. Sample dilution with silica was used as a tool to enhance Knelson recovery in samples with a high sulphide content. At the Lucien Beliveau mill, gold was recovered consistently in all size fractions greater than 38 $ mu$m, averaging 45% in the 76 cm plant Knelson Concentrator.

Further, the concept of operating blast work index and its potential applications were explored. Four different rock types and a well documented case study of two blasts were selected for this study. The work index is found to be uncorrelated with the density and unconfined compressive strength, slightly related with tensile strength, and well correlated with dynamic rock properties, especially the P-wave velocity and the bulk modulus. The standard deviation in measured compressive and tensile strength values is found to be very high, compared to their seismic and dynamic elastic properties. The case study encompassed two blasts with identical blast-patterns and rock type consuming almost the same amount of explosive (kg/t) but with very different specific blast energies (MJ/t). The agreement between operating work index of the two blasts (13.4 kWh/t vs. 13.1 kWh/t) and laboratory work index (17.0 kWh/t) was modest (within 30%). The operating work index corresponding to either blast has been used to predict the product size (P$ sb{80}$) of the other. The choice of feed size (F$ sb{80}$) was discussed; whereas the previous researchers had used the theoretical value of infinity, the use of much smaller value, the average of effective burden and spacing, was proposed. This concept is used in a proposed method to estimate blasting energy requirements as a function of blast geometry, rock type and desired product size. Future test work that would provide a data base and validation for this concept is described.</description><creator>Prasad, Umesh</creator><contributor>Mohanty, B.

Environmental concern regarding the pollution of water bodies has led the authorities to issue stringent regulations with respect to the quality and quantity of wastewater that can be discharged. Chemical characterization and biotreatability of some waste streams generated by a chemical industry in Quebec was therefore undertaken. The study showed that two highly concentrated effluents were amenable to biological treatment. The first effluent, "plastifiant", was generated from the production of plastics, while the second, "colonne", was the product of a resin distillation column. Batch assay tests, including biochemical methane potential (BMP) and anaerobic toxicity assay (ATA), showed a moderate degree of anaerobic treatability with soluble COD removals of 45 to 61% and 11 to 67% for the colonne and plastifiant, respectively. Percentage COD removal was found to vary depending on the source of seed sludge. A mixture of biomasses from different sources was shown to be preferable for the anaerobic degradation of both effluents. The colonne effluent did not exhibit any toxicity to methanogenic bacteria. Inhibition of anaerobic microorganisms from the plastifiant effluent was found to be directly proportional to the increase in concentration, indicating that this effluent should be diluted. Continuous flow studies revealed that the selected effluents could be treated by anaerobic, aerobic or sequential anaerobic-aerobic techniques with soluble COD removals of 58, 80 and 89%, respectively. A significant impact of the type of anaerobic sludge and operating parameters with respect to the extent of biological treatment was noted, suggesting that the treatment efficiencies can be further improved. The one-step anaerobic or aerobic process was found to be applicable as a pre-treatment, while for a full treatment and direct discharge into receiving water</description><creator>Nemer, Randa J.</creator><date>1994</date><subject>Engineering, Civil.</subject><subject>Engineering, Chemical.</subject><subject>Environmental Sciences.</subject><title>Anaerobic-aerobic treatment of chemical industrial effluents</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tb09j7441.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ht24wm293</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Civil Engineering and Applied Mechanics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:j67315964</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T21:07:51Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis proposes a speaker-independent, continuous-speech stop recognition algorithm. The method incorporates knowledge into the system by means of rules whose conditions are linked to acoustic events. Coarticulatory effects present in the speech are taken into account with the analysis of the transient portions of the signal. The novelty of this approach consists of the use of the Karhunen-Loeve transform to segment the speech and to extract both steady-state and dynamic features. Sequences of stops followed by vowels were segmented with the second Karhunen-Loeve transform coefficient, whereas information about the formant transitions and energy distribution was extracted by means of the basis vectors of the transformed space. Tests of the proposed rule-based system resulted in 71% correct classification of the stops' place of articulation, and 80% correct classification of the stops' manner of voicing. More complex systems have previously attained better results. However, the simplicity and computational cost efficiency of this approach would be of considerable benefit to any large ASR system.</description><creator>Morgan, Siân Yvette</creator><contributor>O'Shaughnessy, D.

The heavy metal retention mechanisms were examined both experimentally, using batch equilibrium and precipitation tests, and analytically, using the geochemical equilibrium speciation model MINTEQA2. Heavy metal retention was examined in both non-competitive (single metal) situations and competitive (multi-metal) situations. A definite adsorption selectivity order of Pb $&gt;$ Cu $ gg$ Zn was established, as has been found by many other researchers. Retention by ion exchange adsorption was observed by comparing the total amount of heavy metals retained to the total amount of initially adsorbed calcium and magnesium released. In most cases, it was found that ion exchange was the dominant retention mechanism, even at neutral equilibrium pH values. The effect of initial heavy metal solution pH on heavy metal retention was explored. A comparison was made between batch equilibrium tests performed with metal solutions adjusted to an initial pH of 3 and tests performed with metal solutions that were not adjusted and thus at a higher initial pH. In many cases it was found that greater overall retention occurred when initial metal solutions were at a pH of 3 as opposed to a higher initial pH. The speciation modelling, when compared to the experimental results, was found to adequately predict heavy metal retention in simple single metal batch equilibrium tests but in more complicated multi-metal scenarios the modelling had limited success.</description><creator>MacDonald, Elaine</creator><contributor>Yong, R.

Oxygen partial pressure ranged from 10$ sp{-8}$ to one atmosphere and the SiO$ sb2$ content from 0 to 10 wt%. Minor elements, including the precious metals, partition between the dore metal and the soda slag. The main purpose of this research was to determine the process parameters which influence this distribution, and the nature and forms of the precious metals in the metal and in the slag phases. From the results of the experiments it was found that: (a) Increasing oxygen partial pressure from 10$ sp{-8}$ to 1 atm does not influence gold, palladium and platinum removal from dore metal, but leads to the practically complete removal of Te (down to 4.8 ppm), Rh (down to 2.7 ppm), Pb (down to 6.0 ppm) and quite good removal of Se (down to 0.0112 wt%) and Cu (down to 0.42 wt%) from the dore metal. (b) Silica content of the soda slag does not influence gold, palladium and platinum chemical losses with soda slag. However it was found that increasing silica in slag leads to an increase of mechanical loss of precious metals because of the increase in slag viscosity. (c) Increase in silica content of slag increased lead and copper removal from dore metal, and decreased the removal of rhodium, selenium and tellurium, especially at low oxygen potential. (d) It was concluded that most of precious metals leave dore metal in the form of mechanical losses, but silver and rhodium were found in slags as intermetallic phases with the other components. Rhodium is also lost in the form of the volatile oxide RhO$ sb2$.

In the experiments described in this thesis, two thin-plate specimens of steel under plane-stress loading conditions generating contact pressure distributions of various profiles at the interface, were subjected to a thermal field. Temperature measurements served as reference for the finite element modelling which, through consecutive iterations, provided the values for the thermal contact resistance distributions. Combined mechanical contact pressure and thermal contact stress distributions were considered at the interface. The function representing the relationship between thermal contact resistance and contact pressure for various distributions was defined using the least squares method. It was revealed that although this relationship can be expressed by the single function for the whole experimental range, the deviations experienced for different slopes and forms of distributions (convex and concave), particularly noticeable for steep slopes at high contact pressure levels, could indicate the effect of macro-constriction resistance, however small its values according to the theoretical calculations might be.</description><creator>Li, Wei, 1967-</creator><contributor>Kops, L.

Unlike binocular stereopsis, the views from each aperture are superimposed, so that conventional methods in stereo vision do not apply. Still, the local displacement between corresponding points in these views is related to their distance from the camera. This depth cue provides the basis for a new paradigm in passive range sensing--monocular stereopsis. This thesis presents a technique for computing a dense range image from one composite image acquired with a multiple aperture camera. The formation of the composite image is modelled as an echo process, where the depth of a point in the scene is directly related to the spatial delay of its visual echo. Cepstral analysis is the method used to detect this echo. A model of the composite image cepstrum allows measurement of monocular disparity to subpixel precision, as well as an estimate of its associated error distribution. This data, computed over a dense grid, is used to generate a piecewise planar representation of surfaces in the scene, based on a maximum likelihood criterion. Borrowing techniques from visual psychophysics, the spatial resolution of this result is evaluated in terms of an intelligent agent making decisions about its environment. This new range imaging technique is successfully applied to real-world scenes to demonstrate its potential for mobile robot navigation and obstacle avoidance.</description><creator>Lamb, David G.

Only one solution can satisfy all present and future effluent regulations, and eliminate all impact on receiving waters. This solution is to recycle the whole effluent back to the mill, after treatment. The subject of this research was to develop a physical-chemical process that would be suitable for the treatment of TMP-Newsprint effluent as a closed cycle technology. A mixture composed of 80% TMP cleaner rejects, 10% contaminated condensate from the heat recovery and 10% chip wash water was used to approximate the effluent from a very low water usage mill. Preliminary experiments were performed using lime, magnesium oxide, activated carbon, potassium phosphate and alum. The most promising treatment identified was using a combination of magnesium oxide, lime and potassium phosphate. It was found that 300 mg/L of MgO, 1000 mg/L of CaO and 500 mg/L of KH$ sb2$PO$ sb4$ gave over 90% extractives removal, a reduction of 60% in colour and 75% in turbidity, while maintaining a low water hardness. It was also found that MgO addition was not required at the dosages used. Tests were also performed on effluent with an elevated level of inorganic dissolved solids that would be typical of a closed cycle mill. It was found that higher dosages of lime would be required, and that potassium phosphate would no longer be necessary.

In this work, cathode erosion for various materials was studied for arcs operating in argon, nitrogen and hydrogen, using a magnetically rotated arc. Titanium and stainless steel were found to give extremely low erosion rates in argon (0.2 and 0.3 $ mu$g/C respectively). Cupro-nickels were shown to be suitable for nitrogen and hydrogen plasmas. The slope of hydrogen solubility vs. temperature in the cathode material was found to be important in determining hydrogen plasma erosion characteristics. When the plasma gas has a high solubility in the cathode material, or can react with the cathode, a negative erosion rate may result. When gas solubility in the cathode is low, oxide stability and mode of electron emission may govern erosion rate. A high gas solubility in the cathode material, as with hydrogen, can result in mechanical erosion due to micro-explosions in the cathode surface.</description><creator>Kwak, J. E.

Wall slip probably plays a much more important role in plastics processing than has been previously thought. For example, the extrudate distortion called sharkskin is thought to involve slip. Recent experiments have shown that this phenomenon is highly material dependant. The surface chemistry of both the molten polymer and the bounding surface interface play important roles in both the occurrence and magnitude of wall slip. The initial objectives of the research were to study slip in further detail, concentrating on the effects of the molecular weight and molecular weight distribution of the polymer. The effects of surface properties were also to be investigated. The research was performed using a sliding plate rheometer. Erratic stress signals were observed when the shear stress exceeded a critical level, and there was strong evidence that these were related to a highly complex type of slip. Thus, a steady slip velocity, which could be simply related to the shear stress, could not be determined. It was concluded that wall slip is, in general, a chaotic process with a strong dependence on initial conditions, sample history, and boundary conditions. Further research is suggested to elucidate this phenomenon.</description><creator>Koran, François</creator><contributor>Dealy, J. M.

Because a heat pipe is a closed system, contains no moving mechanical components and transports heat over very small temperature gradients, it presents an attractive alternative to conventional forced-convection cooling techniques. Over the past 4 decades, the principles of heat pipe operation have been thoroughly investigated. Heat pipes have been implemented in a wide variety of engineering applications. Despite this, heat pipes have not been used on a large scale in metallurgical applications. In this regard, an enormous potential for improved efficiency and productivity remains unexploited. Heat pipe research at the McGill Metals Processing Centre has aimed to correct this. Various metallurgical applications for heat pipe technology have been explored by Mucciardi, Botos, Choi, Jin and Meratian. The research effort has concentrated on gas-loaded annular thermosyphons, a subclass of heat pipes. The work presented in this volume represents the author's contribution to this larger research effort. A series of experiments has been performed in order to investigate important aspects of the operation of gas-loaded thermosyphons. Results from these experiments were subsequently incorporated into a PC-based computer model for the design and analysis of annular thermosyphons.</description><creator>Kay, Jonathan H.</creator><contributor>Mucciardi, Frank (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1994</date><subject>Engineering, Mechanical.</subject><subject>Engineering, Metallurgy.</subject><title>A computational and experimental investigation of a heat pipe injection lance</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9k41zg55b.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cz30pv63h</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mining and Metallurgical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:0c483m13k</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T21:07:58Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The objective of this thesis is to provide an analysis of Linear Predictive Coding (LPC) frequencies and Line Spectrum Pair (LSP) frequencies. While it is generally known that LSP frequencies congregate about LPC formants, this study will deal with how LSP and LPC frequencies correlate. The work done in this study is intended to enhance the recognition of vowel phonemes by providing observations on the similarities between LPC and LSP frequency distribution. New information regarding exact LSP and formant relationships for different vowel phonemes is provided. Specifically, this study divides vowel and diphthong phonemes into categories, or types. These types pertain to specific patterns in the way LSP frequencies relate to the closest corresponding formant, F1, F2, or F3. In drawing relationships between formants and their corresponding LSPs, another indicator is made possible such that, when incorporated within other statistical or knowledge based techniques, it may serve to enhance the effectiveness of recognition systems. The results of this thesis indicate that it is possible to divide the sixteen vowel phonemes into nine types. The experiment produced a 75% success rate when the test set was applied. The first part of this thesis provides the theoretical background for the basic understanding of line spectrum pairs and the acoustic-phonetics related to the formation of vowel sounds. The second part of this thesis provides details on how the experiment was conducted and the results of the analysis. Explanations are also provided for these results.</description><creator>Hussain, Rubina</creator><contributor>O'Shaughnessy, Douglas (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1994</date><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>Study of the correlation of LSP and LPC frequencies for vowel phonemes</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/g158bk151.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0c483m13k</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:zw12z735h</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T21:07:59Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Nitric oxide (NO) is a major pollutant which is produced by the combustion of fossil fuels. Current three-way catalyst (TWC) technology, used for the reduction of NO in automobile exhaust, is effective only under stoichiometric or net reducing conditions which cause incomplete use of the fuel and CO and hydrocarbon pollution. Excessively-exchanged Cu-ZSM-5 zeolite was investigated as a catalyst for the reduction of NO in net oxidizing exhaust mixtures, which would allow for greater fuel efficiency and lower NO, CO and hydrocarbon emissions. Cu-ZSM-5 powder was pelletized by extrusion and the activity for the reduction of NO by CO on the presence of O$ sb2$ was measured at temperatures of 200$ sp circ$C to 550$ sp circ$C and a space velocity of 450 hour$ sp{-1}.$ The activity of the Cu-ZSM-5 was compared to that of a TWC at 550$ sp circ$C. Under stoichiometric or net reducing conditions the conversion to N$ sb2$ over both catalysts was about 100%. Under net oxidizing conditions (when the equivalence ratio, $ lambda$, is greater than 1) the conversion decreased with increasing oxygen concentration for both catalysts, but the Cu-ZSM-5 was much more active; at $ lambda=1.3$ the conversion was 53% compared to 26%. The Cu-ZSM-5 was found to deactivate after 30 hours of use. The deactivation was accompanied by a change in the Cu-ZSM-5 structure, and a change in the chemical composition. The deactivation was not found to be a function of the composition, or of the oxidative nature of the conditioning gas used (20% O$ sb2,$ inert, or 20% CO). Regeneration of the Cu-ZSM-5 proved unsuccessful.</description><creator>Gilchrist, Ian Thomas</creator><contributor>Berk, D.

This implies that the response times associated with dynamic congestion management strategies can be long relative to the characteristic times of the queue-length processes being controlled, and that such strategies may be of limited use in controlling message loss in high speed settings. We examine the interplay between signal propagation delays and efficiency of feedback-based congestion controls in the case of a very simple network model consisting of a single multiplexor serving a remote source population. We establish, using simulations of two simple approaches described in the literature, that loss performance can be very sensitive to propagation delay, and that response times can be diminished, for given propagation delays, by applying a rate-based, or cyclic, service strategy at the multiplexor output line in place or First-In, First-Out. We develop an optimization framework for the control problem, enabling the use of Markov Decision Programming to calculate the form and performance of feedback-based controllers which are optimal in terms of the trade-off achieved between forced losses at the network boundary and congestion-induced losses in the network interior. Observing that performance can be made insensitive to signal propagation delays by means of appropriate buffer dimensioning, we develop an asymptotic analysis of the buffer requirements, applicable in the limit of large values of the delay/bandwidth product.</description><creator>Farajian, Patrick</creator><contributor>Kaplan, Michael A.

One approach, impedance control, is to control the manipulator such that the relationship between position and force is well defined. For example, such that the robot behaves like a mass-spring-damper system whose parameters can be specified arbitrarily. In the recent years, many of the impedance control implementations were using force feedback from an end-effector force sensor and the impedance control was performed by forming the error in Cartesian coordinates. The implementation proposed here requires instead co-located torque sensors and the feedback control signals are based solely on joint variables, torque and displacement. Co-located torque sensors lead to a larger control bandwidth since the structural dynamics of the arm is seen as a perturbation, but is not part of the plant to be controlled. Simple SISO controllers, designed to modulate individual joint impedances, can achieve diagonal (decoupled) impedance matrices in Cartesian coordinates, provided that a set of SISO compensators, called her "decouplers", are set up to cancel the non-linear coupling among the joints. This strategy results in a simple computational architecture which does not require complex coordinates transformations to be performed at servo rate. The method can be used with non-redundant and redundant manipulators and experimental results are discussed using a seven DOF manipulator available at the Institut de recherche d'Hydro-Quebec.</description><creator>Doyon, Michel</creator><contributor>Hayward, Vincent (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1994</date><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>Decentralized impedance control</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9s161821d.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/t148fk08c</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:p8418q17p</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T21:08:02Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Particulate Reinforced Metal Matrix Composites, or PMMCs, consist of ceramic particulates dispersed in a metal matrix. Powder metallurgy (P/M) techniques are often employed to fabricate these materials. P/M offers the simplest way to ensure good distribution of reinforcement within the matrix. In this work, TiC particles have been dispersed in a Ti matrix, yielding a composite which combines the high hardness and abrasive nature of the ceramic phase with the refractory, metallic properties of Ti. The microstructure of this material has been investigated for composites having various TiC content (2.5wt%-20wt%). Furthermore, the effect of sintering temperature and time on the microstructural evolution was investigated. The addition of TiC was seen to enhance the sinterability of Ti, making it possible to attain theoretical densities $&gt;$99%. Results show that the optimum density is obtained using 2.5 to 5 wt% TiC at a temperature of 1440-1480$ sp circ$C for 2 hours. This study also illustrates the decrease in the microhardness of the TiC particles due to carbon diffusion from TiC into Ti matrix at high sintering temperatures. On the other hand, the addition of TiC significantly increases the overall hardness compared to that of pure Ti.</description><creator>Debouzy, Stéphane</creator><contributor>Drew, R. A. L.

It is based on Nabavi-Lishi's semi-analytical model for computing the current and delay in a CMOS logic gate which, when compared to HSPICE running the level-3 MOSFET model, is more than three orders of magnitude faster, and accurate to within 10%. CUREST is built on top of the timing analyser TAMIA and, in particular, uses its circuit parser and its data structure to store the circuit topology and primary input pattern. Extension tests on benchmark circuits containing up to 555 gates, which were analysed with CUREST using thousands of primary input patterns, demonstrate that the current analysis time is in the range of 1ms per gate per input pattern, using a SUN4/490 workstation with 32 Mb of main memory, running the SUN OS 4.103 operating system. The peak value of the total supply current, the current rise-time, and the time at which the peak occurs are usually computed to within 10% of HSPICE. However, appreciable errors often occur in the average current. This is because at the moment we do not have a good model for dealing with incomplete transitions associated with glitches in a CMOS gate.</description><creator>Chan, Na-Han</creator><contributor>Rumin, N.

Unlike in many other approaches that assume motion to be locally translational, the approach proposed here uses a quadratic motion trajectory model that incorporates both velocity and acceleration. This model corresponds better to natural image sequences especially when processing over multiple frames is considered. One of the advantages of using accelerated motion over linear trajectories is in motion-compensated processing over multiple images. This is due to the fact that over longer time frame, a quadratic motion model is capable of providing a better intensity match along trajectories than the linear model. The side effect is, however, that with more images used for estimation occlusion effects play a more dominant role. Therefore, another motion model is proposed to account for occlusions and motion discontinuities.

In this study, the surface of an implant is microknurled to provide a "textured" surface that allows for mechanical fixation by bone ingrowth. The microknurling is essentialIty an indentation technique and thus generates plastic deformation which is limited to the surface. This in turn can be used to produce localized surface recrystallization, thus permitting the modification of the surface microstructure. The microstructure of Ti-6Al-4V can be controlled through thermomechanical processing to produce fine equiaxed morphologies which are known to be effective against crack initiation. Conversely, lamellar microstructures can be produced through heat treatment alone. This study deals with the production of a "dual microstructure" having a fine equiaxed microstructure surface layer and an inner coarse lamellar microstructure. Indentation tests using a servo-hydraulic/load frame system were first run at room temperatures. These tests showed that deformation could be concentrated to produce localized recrystallization. Later, high temperature (800$ sp circ$C) indentation tests were run and it was found that localized recrystallization could also be obtained at higher temperatures. High temperature microknurling was then proposed as a potential method to alleviate surface cracking problems encountered when using the current room temperature microknurling process. The dual microstructure was optimized under the present experimental limitations, and fatigue tests using microknurled specimens were run to determine the effect on fatigue strength The dual microstructures showed improved fatigue strength over the single homogeneous microstructures. It was also found that microknurling alone (without any heat treatment subsequent to the microknurling) imparts residual compressive stresses that can improve the fatigue strength to levels superior to the dual microstructure. However, it was concluded that a crack free dual microstructure may still have superior fatigue strength to a non-heat-treated microknurled specimen.

Since the large computation requirements for this operation are especially taxing to single processor computers, the approach is to consider parallel processing alternatives. Of the parallel processor classes considered, systolic arrays are singled out as the preferred parallel processing solution for the convolution problem. Therefore, the design of a pipelined double precision floating point VLSI systolic cell for convolution is described. The arithmetic operations are distributed into three pipelined stages, enabling the cell to process each set of operands within 16 clock cycles. Once fabricated and tested, the systolic chip yielded an 80 MFLOPS performance which is a remarkable improvement over available general purpose computers.</description><creator>Botzas, Anthony</creator><contributor>Malowany, A.

In order to integrate sensor measurements and actuator control schemes we must determine the rigid body transformations that relate the native co-ordinate frames of these devices. Equivalently, we need to estimate the relative pose of sensors and actuators in the systems. We examine the problem of determining the pose of a robot-mounted range-finding camera, and present a class of solutions motivated by the idea that mobile camera calibration is best addressed by an ongoing dynamic estimation process. We use range measurements and known robot kinematics to provide the estimate of camera pose which is maximally consistent with the available data. Our scheme uses scene features that are often present in typical workcell scenes and that are easily and reliably extracted. We develop several formulations of the principles, and present experimental results for both simulated and real data sets.</description><creator>Baird, Duncan L.
