This study is closely related to the direct kinematics problem in robotics, its solution being particularly challenging, at the displacement level, for parallel manipulators. The concept of measurement subspaces is used to characterize the motion of the end-point of three-degree-of-freedom serial manipulators of general geometry for any joint-sensor layout. Once the motion of a redundant set of body points is characterized by its measurement subspaces, the pose estimation problem reduces to a linear least-square problem subject to the nonlinear constraint of proper orthogonality over the orientation variables. Although the solution of this problem requires a nonlinear numerical procedure, we proposed two alternative linear least-square estimates for its solution. The polar least-square estimate (PLS) is based on the polar decomposition of the unconstrained least-square solution, while the decoupled polar least-square estimate (DPLS) uses the same approach, but solves a decoupled version of the kinematic relationships. A decoupling equation is derived for general combinations of measurement subspaces, for which sufficient conditions for isotropic decoupling are proposed and illustrated with an industrial parallel manipulator. Isotropic decoupling is defined in this thesis. The computational cost and estimation accuracy of the proposed procedures are analysed through simulation and experimental studies. Some procedures exhibit fair estimation accuracy and low computational cost, and hence, are well suited for the purpose of on-line implementation.</description><creator>Baron, Luc.</creator><contributor>Angeles, Jorge (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1997</date><subject>Engineering, Mechanical.</subject><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>Contributions to the estimation of rigid-body motion under sensor redundancy</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kp78gh91r.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/x059c904j</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mechanical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:js956h43p</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:01:24Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>A series of hindered biphenols specifically designed to form stable biphenoxy radicals were prepared by an oxidative coupling reaction of hindered phenols in the presence of CuCl and molecular oxygen in butyronitrile or by reacting the diphenoquinones with HCl gas. The biphenoxy radicals generated from the oxidation of the original biphenols with an aqueous solution of KOH/K$ sb3$Fe(CN)$ sb6$ or Ag$ sb2$O were used as reagents in organic reactions and catalysts in the oxidation of diarylmethanes to corresponding ketones. They were also used in the synthesis of novel ether and acetal monomers through a quantitative radical coupling reaction with monomers containing activated methylene groups. These ether and acetal compounds were readily cleaved under acidic conditions thus providing a new method of cleaving benzylic and t-butyl ethers under mild conditions and for functionalizing activated methylene groups. To simplify the purification steps biphenol A6.19 was incorporated into the backbone of a poly(aryl ether) chain and used as a polymeric support material. The quantitative radical coupling reaction and cleavage of the resulting ethers and acetals led to the synthesis of novel carbon - oxygen coupled polymers that could potentially be used as photoresist materials since they are cleaved to low molecular weight organic compounds in the presence of acid. In part B a new mass spectrometry technique, Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization-Time of Flight, was examined as a potential tool in determining the absolute molecular weight, sequence distribution, and end groups of low molecular weight polydisperse polymers and cyclic oligomers.</description><creator>Barbiero, Gennaro.</creator><contributor>Hay, A.

Fitting the kinetic data of reactions of PMA with ethanolamine and n-hexylamine (HAN) in DMSO-rich solvent by use of the neighboring-group model shows an auto-acceleration effect due to hydrogen-bonding and/or polar interactions, and hydrophobic interactions; however, PMA and cyclohexane-methylamine shows an auto-retardation effect due to strong steric hindrance. At low extent of reaction the steric effect dominates the kinetics of the reaction of PMA with benzylamine, but hydrophobic interactions become predominant at high extent of reaction. Monomer sequence distributions of the partially functionalized PMA for some of these reactions are not in accord with the predictions of the neighboring-group model, probably due to the long-range neighboring-group effects and/or side reactions. Despite a pseudo-first order behavior with respect to the concentration of ester groups found for the reaction of cross-linked PMA with HAN, a mono-amine, deviations from first order behavior were also observed for reactions with multi-functional amines. This is due to the formation of extra cross-links, which restrict the diffusion of amines within the polymeric beads, and is confirmed by NMR studies of the chain mobility using the dipolar dephasing technique by the measurement of the decay time constants. Studies of the binding of bile acid anions by metal-containing polymeric resins, obtained from amine-functionalized PMA and poly(glycidyl methacrylate), show that the type of metal ion and the complexes formed between metal ions and functional groups play a more important role in the binding than factors such as the hydrophobicity of polymer backbones, the structures of functional groups, and the introduction of a spacer between the functional group and the backbone. It is proposed, in addition to the conventional ion exchange process, ligand exchange is involved in the binding mechanism. This is confirmed by results of $ sp{15}$N NMR and proton spin-lattice relaxation time experiments.</description><creator>Yu, Youlu</creator><contributor>Brown, G. R.

TRIP (Transformation-Induced-Plasticity) behavior is a powerful mechanism with which to improve mechanical properties. The basis of TRIP behavior is the retention of austenite with optimum characteristics (volume fraction, stability, size, morphology and composition) at room temperature. The transformation of retained austenite to martensite during deformation can lead to TRIP-enhanced properties. This work deals with the effects of thermomechanical processing parameters on the microstructural characteristics of TRIP steels, primarily from the point of view of the retained austenite condition in Si-Mn and Si-Mn-Nb bearing TRIP steels. Initially, a new test technique based on continuous cooling compression (CCC) testing was developed to find the critical temperatures of thermomechanical processing (TMP). A major finding from the CCC test is the ability to determine the $Ae sb3$ (equilibrium austenite-to-ferrite transformation) temperature. In the CCC test, the $Ae sb3$ appeared to be associated with an increase in the rate of increase in flow stress with decreasing temperature. In order to further evaluate this result, neutron diffractometry at high temperatures was used to monitor any crystallographic changes associated with the metastable region. The results revealed an increase in the rate of contraction of the austenite lattice as the temperature decreases through the metastable state (below $Ae sb3),$ compared with that observed as the temperature decreases through the stable austenite region. Having defined the critical TMP temperatures, the effects of processing parameters on the state of the retained austenite were examined by changing the thermomechanical processing conditions. These effects were more fundamentally considered by tak</description><creator>Zarei Hanzaki, Abbass</creator><contributor>Yue, S.

Resistant C57BL/6 mice exhibit moderate levels of peak parasitemia and anemia and survive the infection. Susceptible A/J mice develop significantly higher parasitemias, severe anemia and succumb to infection. Resistance is controlled by a single or tightly linked, dominant, autosomal, non-H-2 linked locus(i), and is associated with the development of enhanced splenomegaly during infection and enhanced reticulocytic response to phenylhydrazine-induced hemolytic anemia. In this thesis, the relationship between the splenic erythropoietic response and resistance to infection is examined. Impairment of splenic erythropoiesis is demonstrated in susceptible A/J mice. This impairment could not be explained by a deficiency in erythropoietin production or in the mobilization of erythroid progenitor cells from the marrow to the spleen. The kinetics and mechanism of the inhibition of erythropoiesis was examined using an in vitro erythroid proliferation assay. Increased inhibition was associated with the rise in parasitemia and was found to be invariant in resistant and susceptible mice. Evidence is presented to suggest that the inhibitor is erythroid-specific and is distinct from IL-1, TNF and IFN-gamma. In transfusion experiments, evidence was obtained for the importance of anemia in the mortality of susceptible A/J mice and in the induction of parasitologic crisis. In splenectomy and immune cell transfer experiments, evidence is presented for the conclusion that an intact spleen is required for the induction but not the expression of B cell-dependent immunity to Plasmodium chabaudi AS.</description><creator>Yap, George So</creator><contributor>Stevenson, Mary M.

Phosphate is absolutely required for the dehydrogenase activity. NADP can be utilized by the dehydrogenase with a low turnover rate. The properties of the enzyme suggest that it has evolved from NADP to NAD specificity by the unique mechanism of substituting inorganic phosphate for the 2$ sp prime$-phosphate of NADP. The role of Mg$ sp{++}$ in this process is not understood, but it is required for activity with both dinucleotides. This enzyme is proposed to be a mammalian homolog of the product of the yeast MIS1 gene, functioning in providing formyltetrahydrofolate for the synthesis of formylmethionyl tRNA required for the initiation of protein synthesis in mitochondria. The two activities of this bifunctional enzyme are resolved significantly by diethylpyrocarbonate modification of at least two histidines. Most striking is the ability to activate the cyclohydrolase up to 50% independently of the dehydrogenase by modification with diethylpyrocarbonate in the presence of ligands: Mg$ sp{++}/$phosphate/NAD/folate.</description><creator>Yang, Xiao-Ming</creator><contributor>MacKenzie, Robert E.

Experiments were conducted with the aim of determining whether the removal of specific toxic alkaloids, lupanine and 13-hydroxylupanine, from crushed lupin seed (CLS) would improve the organic matter intake (OMI) and average daily gains (ADG) in lambs, and also improve the lactation performance in dairy cows. Effects on liver function in lambs were also investigated. An additional study on the effects of the detoxification of CLS on the degradation of protein was conducted. In Experiment 1, 30 growing Corriedale lambs were fed five diets for 105 d according to a randomized complete block design (RCBD) with six blocks. Two diets contained intact CLS at 15% (LUI-15) or 30% (LUI-30) of DM; two other diets contained detoxified CLS at 15% (LUD-15) or 30% (LUD-30) and the control (CON) diet was supplemented with crushed sunflower seed, which was locally prepared, on-farm. All diets were formulated to be isonitrogenous (16% CP). The alkaloid content (lupanine and 13-OH lupanine) of the diets was.31,.70,.21 and.52% for LUI-15, LUI-30, LUD-15 and LUD-30, respectively. Thus, diets containing detoxified CLS contained approximately 30% less alkaloids than those with intact CLS. Estimates of ADG of lambs fed diets containing detoxified CLS was higher (P $&lt;$.01) (120 g.d$ sp{-1}$) than that of lambs fed intact CLS (76 g.d$ sp{-1}$). The OMI (73 g/Wkg$ sp{0.75}$) was also higher, although not significantly, for lambs fed diets containing detoxified CLS. Feed conversion efficiency was increased (P $&lt;$.05) by the detoxification of CLS. Lambs fed diets containing intact CLS consumed more OMI as time progressed, suggesting that adaptation to CLS might have occurred. Lambs fed diets containing intact CLS demonstrated increased trends in the activity in plasma of the enzymes glutamic oxaloacetic transferase (GOT) and $ gamma$-glutamyl transfer</description><creator>Mukisira, Ephraim Amiani</creator><contributor>Phillip, Leroy (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1994</date><subject>Lupines -- Kenya.</subject><subject>Lambs -- Feeding and feeds.</subject><subject>Alkaloids -- Physiological effect.</subject><subject>Dairy cattle -- Feeding and feeds.</subject><title>The influence of alkaloids on voluntary intake and performance by ruminants fed diets containing lupin seed in Kenya</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kw52j953t.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bg257g611</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Animal Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:ff365680h</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:01:26Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>A computational modelling study has been undertaken for analysing the complex turbulent melt flow, involving convective and conductive heat transfer in the melt pool and the solidifying mushy-region within the wedge-shaped region of a vertical twin-roll stainless steel caster. An essential feature of the model is the incorporation of the body-fitted curvilinear coordinate transformation method for correctly modelling the arbitrary shaped region of the caster in the presence of non-isothermal solidification. The model can also treat an obstacle such as a submerged nozzle within the domain. The dendritic columnar solidification of molten metal has been modelled through the implementation of the enthalpy-porosity technique. The transformed curvilinear momentum and energy transport equations were suitably non-dimensionalized and later solved for the physical variables, using a control-volume finite difference scheme. The pressure-velocity coupling of the momentum equations were resolved through a modification of the well-established SIMPLER algorithm. In the absence of such previous studies for stainless steel, either mathematical or experimental, comparisons have been made of the present model with the experimental work carried out within Nippon Steel Corporation as well as with experimental studies of a similar system for a tin-lead alloy. Predictions based on the present model are in good agreement with experimental results. Various parametric studies have been carried out for the important variables of the twin-roll casting system, and their effects on the turbulent velocity fields, temperature distributions within the melt, solidification profiles and the extent of the mushy region, have been predicted. The present results lead to many suggestions for the design of twin-roll casting systems.</description><creator>Murakami, Hideki</creator><contributor>Guthrie, R. I. L.

The eruption of 1761 produced both trachytic and hybrid basaltic lavas and exemplifies magma mixing processes that occurred frequently in the past. Mingling of basaltic magmas produces homogeneous hybrid magmas; mingling between basaltic and trachytic liquids is inhibited by thermal quench of the basaltic magma. Hybridization of benmoreitic magma into basalt may account for its rarity in oceanic island lava suites. Convection observed in an experimental basalt-pantellerite melt system is not attributable to gravitational instability at the nominally horizontal multicomponent free-diffusion boundary. Stresses due to diffusion in the viscoelastic silicate melts produced a meniscus; inclined density gradients at the meniscus cause convection.

The HPLC analysis revealed the presence of 17 amino acids (proline most abundant) and 7 sugars (ribose being the most abundant). The changes in the concentration of the amino acids and sugars after heat treatment, are explained based on their interaction through the Maillard reaction and by the thermal hydrolysis of proteins and polysaccharides present in tissue. Carotenoid pigments ($ beta$-carotene, canthaxanthin, astacene, and astaxanthin monopalmitate) were extracted and separated by thick layer chromatography. Their structures were identified tentatively by thick layer chromatography (TLC) and subsequently confirmed by Fourier transformed infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. Lipids were separated and categorized into glycerides, sterols, and phospholipids by thin layer chromatography while flavor-active components were extracted by different organic solvents into acidic, basic, and neutral fractions and their sensory properties determined. The flavor profile of the raw and cooked shrimp meat waste revealed the presence of 59 compounds in raw shrimp compared to 44 in cooked. The components identified were of different functional groups, including fatty acid esters, long chain alcohols, aldehydes, ketanes and hydrocarbons. Many fractions provided desirable aroma (nutty, fruity, floral, green woody, meaty) indicating the presence of important flavor compounds in the commercial shrimp waste. Model studies were carried out under different experimental conditions (water content, pH), to observe the influence of these parameters on the formation of Maillard reaction products. Furthermore, a comparative study between direct injection of the aqueous solutions and its organic extracts was conducted. The direct injection of aqueous solutions revealed the presence of many water soluble components that were not detected by organic solvent extraction such as droserone and 3,9-diazatricyclo$ lbrack7.3.0.0 sp{*}.3 sp{*}.7 sp{ *} rbrack$-dodecan-2,8-dione while maltoxazine and acetanilide are example of compounds identified only in the dichloromethane extracts. Results also demonstrated that monosaccharides affected the yield of the compounds produced whereas the amino acids influenced the sensory properties of these models. Fructose and ribose were found to be the most reactive sugars in their respective categories. Thiazoles were found to be more water soluble whereas $ beta$-carbolines were more abundant in the organic extracts. The influence of water content was investigated in model systems containing fructose or glucose. It was found that water free systems decreased the yield of pyrazines and thiazoles while the formation of pyrrole and pyridine derivatives increased under dry heating conditions. The formation of Maillard reaction products were studied under different pH conditions in order to assess the effect of pH on the formation of heterocyclic compounds. Pyrazine and furan derivatives were the most affected by pH and alanine was found to be a better nitrogen source than lysine in the formation of pyrazines under different pH conditions. Finally, based on energy minimization studies using MM2 force field, a plausible mechanism was proposed for the formation of maltol in Maillard model systems.</description><creator>Mandeville, Sylvain</creator><contributor>Yavlayan, V.

Preliminary experiments, measuring grain velocities for two sizes of sand and two surface inclination angles were performed in a tank of stationary water. When sub-aqueous debris flows were developed by releasing Ottawa sand from a hopper onto a rough bed, various phenomena were observed: nonuniform flows, static dead-flow regions, uniform flows and roll waves. Uniform flow was possible for a range of bed inclination angles larger than the angle of internal friction of the sand. The flow became unstable and roll waves developed at higher slopes and lower depths of flow. Following these exploratory experiments, more detailed, controlled experiments were carried out using a non-intrusive method of velocimetry. The flowing mixture was made up of glass particles and a liquid having the same index of refraction. By passing planes of laser light through the free surface of flows at various distances from the glass sidewalls of the channel and recording video images, it was possible to identify the particles and determine the three-dimensional velocity and concentration profiles. Experiments were performed for various bed inclination angles. Further experiments were performed with the aim of correlating the data in the form of a generalized Vedernikov formula for debris flows that relates velocity, flow depth, concentration and bed inclination angle. Various liquid-solid mixtures were used, and the variations of the average velocity with depth and sloped inclination angle were studied for different discharge-rates and solids fractions. Very different behavior was observed for the macro-viscous and transitional regimes, as defined by Bagnold. Such correlation was obtained for the macro-viscous regime; the nondimensional parameters that appear in the model involve the particle diameter, density and concentration and fluid viscosity and density. The model was compared with about 200 sets of data and good agreement was obtained.</description><creator>Malekzadeh, Mohammad Jafar e</creator><contributor>Savage, S. B.

The porous medium is composed of inert spheres of equal diameter contained within a detonation tube. The propagation mechanisms were elucidated by means of high-speed Schlieren and open shutter photography of the wave-particle interactions in 2-D obstacle arrays, to simulate the phenomenon in actual porous media. It is found that a Chapman-Jouguet (CJ) detonation can transmit into a porous medium filled with detonable gas and continue to propagate as a quasi-steady combustion wave. There exists a continuous spectrum of averaged combustion wave velocities ($ rm0.3 le V/V sb{CJ} le 1)$ spanning the lean and rich propagation limits and exhibiting a maximum value at the most sensitive composition. A decrease in the particle size of the medium has the effect of narrowing the detonability range and reducing the velocity for a given mixture. It is clearly demonstrated that the propagation phenomenon, and thus the velocity, is governed by the relative length scales of the detonable mixture (critical tube diameter $ rm d sb{c})$ and of the porous medium (average pore size $ rm d sb{p}).$ An empirical correlation was established between the wave velocity (V/V$ sb{CJ})$ and the properties of the system, via the ratio $ rm d sb{c}/d sb{p}.$ The global wave propagation mechanism, for the major part of the possible range of velocities, i.e., $ rm V/V sb{CJ} ge 0.5,$ consists of periodic phases of detonation failure by diffraction around obstacles (i.e., the particles), followed by local reinitiation at detonative Mach stems formed by shock wave-particle interactions. This is essentially identical to the propagation of "quasidetonations" studied by Teodorczyk et al. (1988, 1991), in linear arrangements of obstacles. When local reinitiation of detonation is not possible, ignition transfer in the pores is controlled by the turbulent jetting of hot combustion produc</description><creator>Makris, Aristidis</creator><contributor>Lee, J.

The chamber resembles a parallel plate ionization chamber, and has a thin film of polymer covering the collector and guard-ring electrodes. Calculations are performed by solving Laplace's Equation for the true geometry of the charging/discharging set-up, then applying estimates of ion-density distributions generated from known scattering distributions and/or simpler approximations. Measurements of radiation induced conductivity (RIC) are presented and fitted to an empirically derived analytical model, and the effects of RIC on the operation of a radiation dosimeter based on the electret are investigated and discussed. Short-term and long-term charge decay from the electret is measured and fitted to a previously developed model. The effects of post-charging heat treatment of the radiation-charged electret are presented and discussed. Lastly, the dosimetric characteristics of the REIC are considered in light of those physical aspects investigated here.</description><creator>MacDonald, Brennan A.</creator><contributor>Fallone, B.

'ICA Pijao') from half-cotyledonary nodes was achieved on modified Murashige and Skoog (1962) basal medium amended with 5 $ mu$M 6-benzylaminopurine. Histological studies confirmed the adventitious origin of the regenerated buds. Shoots were rooted ex vitro and developed into morphologically normal plants compared with seed-grown controls. The relative susceptibility of bean tissues to infection by a collection of wild-type Agrobacterium strains was tested. Positive transformation events were evaluated based on morphological and biochemical changes observed following Agrobacterium infection. The A. tumefaciens strain C58 was particularly virulent on greenhouse-grown plants, in vitro-derived stem sections, half-cotyledonary nodes and seedlings. A sensitive and rapid method was developed to detect opines using thin layer chromatography. Transient $ beta$-glucuronidase (GUS) gene expression was detected in 'ICA Pijao' bean buds regenerated from half-cotyledonary nodes following Agrobacterium-mediated gene transfer with the binary vector pGV1040 or p35SGUSINT. Four out of eight putative transformants contained the chimeric GUSINT gene following polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. This was confirmed by Southern analysis of blotted PCR gels. However, there was no stable integration of the GUSINT gene as none of the R1 progeny showed an amplified GUSINT fragment with PCR.</description><creator>Korban, Martine</creator><contributor>Donnelly, Danielle (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1994</date><subject>Plant genetic transformation.</subject><subject>Kidney bean -- Genetic engineering.</subject><subject>Agrobacterium.</subject><title>Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.)</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/p2676x28q.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9k41zg03k</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Plant Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:9s161773z</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:01:29Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The preparation of allylsilanes by silylation of allylsulfones followed by the reductive cleavage of the silylated sulfones, is described. The use of this new methodology in the synthesis of polyenic compounds including cis and trans retinoic acid was reported. The preparations and reactions of a series of aminomethyl substituted $ alpha$-allylsilyl anions with carbonyl electrophiles were studied. The stereoselectivity of these reactions was subject to solvents and temperature effects. For instance, the condensation of these anions with carbonyl electrophiles proceeded to give the corresponding E-homoallylic alcohols in benzene, but the same reactions at lower temperatures in the presence of dimethoxyethane leads to the formation of the Z- isomers preferentially. A new method for the preparation of aminomethyl substituted allylsilane 1 via the hydrosilylation of a new allene was described. This allene was prepared using an improved method of elimination of $ beta$-hydroxyvinylsilanes. A number of analogs of retinoic acid were synthesized for their use in the treatment of leukemia.

The history of Jewish Bible interpretation and the traditional Jewish emphasis on works of specific exegetes have, in turn, colored the educational materials used in Jewish school curricula and stereotypes have been perpetuated as elementary school children study the Bible. This thesis focuses on eight women in Scripture. After examining the Bible, selected rabbinic exegetical works are studied to see how this literature reflects or changes the Bible's image. A review of textbooks and teaching tools used for Bible study follows to see how these educational materials present the biblical women, whether or not they mirror classical Jewish perspectives on biblical women, and if they offer a varied portrait of the figures.</description><creator>Kramer, Phyllis Silverman</creator><contributor>Levy, B.

The scale has been developed in several stages, including a literature review, two studies seeking the opinions of patients and experts, pilot testing, and a large, longitudinal study of back pain patients. After an extensive analysis of 48 items that were initially selected, a final, 20-item disability scale was derived. The scale assesses the level of difficulty in simple daily activities. It has a clear theoretical orientation, is acceptable to patients, reliable, empirically valid, responsive to change, and able to discriminate between individuals over a wide range of disability levels. The scale can be recommended as an outcome measure in clinical trials and other studies of back pain patients.</description><creator>Kopec, Jacek A.

In cats, the effects of neurotoxic lesions on the normal distribution of reticular cholinergic, GABAergic and serotonergic cells and fibres as well as on the sleep-wake cycle were observed. In the rat, GABAergic and serotonergic neurons were identified in the medulla and raphe, where they appeared to be heavily innervated by GABAergic terminals, and subpopulations of both cell types were found to project to the spinal cord. In the cat, cholinergic cells were sparse through the reticular formation, but of significant numbers, GABAergic cells were ubiquitously evident in larger numbers, and smaller numbers of serotonergic cells were found ventrally and along the midline. Cholinergic and serotonergic fibres were present in moderate density in the medulla where they manifested only slight reductions in density after lesions, whereas GABAergic fibres were extremely dense and were dramatically reduced in density after lesions. At a distance from the lesion, cholinergic and serotonergic densities were slightly reduced, but GABAergic densities were not. Thus evidence was provided for long projections from cholinergic and serotonergic reticular neurons, but for only local projections from GABAergic cells. The destruction of reticular neurons in cats resulted in a significant decrease in the amount of paradoxical sleep, that correlated negatively with the number of surviving serotonergic cells, and positively with the ratio of surviving cholinergic and GABAergic cells to serotonergic cells. The most distinct effect of the lesion on paradoxical sleep was a loss of the normal muscle atonia, that was correlated positively with the volume of the lesion in its centre, and the appearance of large movements of the head, body and limbs, that were correlated positively with the ratio of GABAergic to serotonergic neurons. In summary, this thesis presented detailed mappings of three defined neuronal systems in the medulla, examined their projections and directly tested their contributions to the state of paradoxical sleep. The conclusion was drawn that the medial medullary reticular formation contains both excitatory and inhibitory systems, that may be mutually modified by interlocutory GABAergic cells, and that these systems contribute to the coordination of state, in particular to the muscular atonia of paradoxical sleep.</description><creator>Holmes, Colin J.

A fully automated reconstruction algorithm is developed that circumvents the traditional 'correspondence problem' using only notions of consistency and connectivity. Here it is assumed that the object is a connected structure and that its centre-lines have been identified in 3 or more images. The first of three steps in the procedure involves generating a connected structure that represents the multiplicity of solutions that are consistent with any two (different) projections of the vascular tree. The second step assigns to each branch in this structure a measure of consistency based on its agreement with a third (or additional) view of the object. The problem then becomes one of propagating this information, via connectivity relationships and other consistency checks, throughout the above structure to distinguish between the branches comprising the imaged structure and the accompanying artifacts. This thesis also addresses the issue of how different imaging geometries affect the outcome of the reconstructed data. Here it is suggested that it may be possible to favourably affect the reconstruction by selecting certain projections based on what is known after two or more views. Simulations using mathematical models of varying complexity and experiments based on actual image data are used to validate the methods described here and demonstrate that it is possible to achieve adequate reconstructions with as few as three distinct views.</description><creator>Henri, Christopher J.

During the life cycle of mining design and operation, a series of decisions are made based on the knowledge and personal experience. The success of mining design depends largely on knowledge available, and how knowledge is managed and processed. This thesis presents a conceptual backfill design rationale in a systematic approach in terms of basic information needs and data flow. Based on this representation, an integrated decision support system for backfill design is introduced. The underlying system is based on the integration of traditional databases, expert systems, hypermedia, and logical programming concepts consisting of the following components: (1) user interface, which creates the model of tasks and the application environment; (2) hypermedia-based reference manual, which supports non-linear access to backfill design reference manual of various formats; (3) expert systems which solve certain tasks based on heuristic rules; and finally, (4) knowledge base management system which provides an efficient approach to manage and manipulate massive data of previous backfill operations. The integration of these components is achieved through a blackboard architecture. The early test of the prototype system shows that the basic objectives have been achieved to provide fast information access and certain decision makings.</description><creator>Huang, Xin, 1958-</creator><contributor>Hassani, F.

This research investigates the mother-child responsivity and coping behavior of high risk children. Two groups of mother-infant dyads (N = 60) (mothers with and without psychiatric disorders) were coded during a videotaped, semi-structured play interaction using the CARE-Index. Results indicated that mothers with psychiatric disorders were significantly less sensitive and more unresponsive with their children than normal mothers. Mothers with psychiatric disorders who had extreme levels of psychosocial stress were significantly less sensitive and more controlling than those mothers diagnosed as living under less stressful circumstances. Children of mothers with psychiatric disorders were significantly less cooperative with their mothers in the play interaction. The results indicated that children whose mothers had chronic psychiatric disorders demonstrated significantly less effective coping behavior on all subscales of the Early Coping Inventory. Implications for the identification and treatment of children at risk for psychiatric disorder are discussed.</description><creator>Hughes, Susan Maureen</creator><contributor>Derevensky, Jeffrey (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1993</date><subject>Adjustment (Psychology)</subject><subject>Children of the mentally ill</subject><title>The effects of maternal psychiatric disorder on responsivity in the mother-child interaction and on the development of children's coping behaviour</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9019s399w.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/765372651</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Educational Psychology and Counselling</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:cf95jc89b</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:01:31Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This dissertation deals with the changes which have intervened since the inception of deregulation in the US and Canadian airline industry, in the 'effort bargain'. It deals first with the role of economic, institutional and legislative conditions, in each country, on labour, through a comparison of aggregate labour outcomes from 1960 to 1990. It subsequently assesses the impact of carriers' strategies to lower costs through an analysis of the collective agreements of pilots, flight attendants, mechanics and agents. This part of the research covers two airlines in each country. Collected data indicate that deregulation decreased average earnings in both countries but the decline was greater in the US than in Canada. The US's greater decline was found to be linked to the economic context and competitive unionism, which had previously helped unions increase earnings above competitive levels. In the period of deregulation, this system caved in to pressures from the carriers and labour market conditions. In Canada, the combined outcome of government monetary controls and labour negotiations, patterned after the conditions negotiated by the state-owned airline, kept earnings at more competitive levels. During deregulation, the decline was modest and approximately the same or slightly larger than in other industries. The comparative analysis across carriers and crafts shows that competitive markets led to an elaborate pattern of contract changes which undermined the previous bargaining pattern as well as the system of labour relations. All airlines sought to cut costs through moderation of wage increases, two-tier wage structure, and work rule and fringe benefit changes. These concessions varied across carriers, work groups, labour market conditions, and the specificity of these jobs. Mechanics, with alternative fields of employment and with a centralized union structure, made the least concessions. Although there were wage variations in the two countries, due to different pay scales, wages for senior workers have remained almost unchanged since deregulation. The small increases were exchanged for substantially lower wages for new employees and employment-productivity gains. In 1990, top wages were 10% to 20% higher, but those at the entry level were significantly lower in the US than in Canada. These findings suggest that while competitive markets exert an important influence on labour relations, their influence is best understood historically and in the context of each country's specific circumstances.</description><creator>Botteri, Afra</creator><contributor>Smith, M.

In both regions, seasonal mean water table position was the best predictor of mean CH$ sb4$ flux when microtopography was included in the analysis (r$ sp2$ = 0.73; p $&lt;$ 0.01). The regression coefficients (slopes) were similar in both regions, suggesting a similar functional relationship between water table position and CH$ sb4$ flux; but the constants (intercepts) were different, implying a regional difference in climate or other biogeochemical factors. Broad-scale wetland classifications that do not account for microtopography and regional differences are inadequate for predicting CH$ sb4$ flux. Vegetation and a suite of environmental variables in both regions were analyzed with multivariate statistics. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) showed that hydrology (water table position) explains most of the variability in bryophyte distribution, with chemistry (pore-water pH, Ca, Mg) as the second most important factor. The relative importance of the variables is reversed for vascular species in the Clay Belt; variables correlating with bryophyte and vascular species distribution are more similar in the Labrador Trough. Hydrology and chemistry are independent variables in both regions. CH$ sb4$ flux correlated strongly with hydrology in both regions, but not with chemistry. Because of the strong correlation between bryophytes and CH$ sb4$ flux in the CCA analyses, a predictive model was developed using weighted averaging (WA) calibration. Optimum CH$ sb4$ flux values are highest for carpet/pool species and lowest for hummock species. No overlap in WA tolerances occurs between hummock and pool species, suggesting species at either end of the moisture gradient are the best predictors of CH$ sb4$ flux. Although the model works best within and not among regions, it has potential application in remote sensing of bryophytes for regional CH$ sb4$ budgets, paleoenvironmental reconstructions of CH$ sb4$ flux, and biological monitoring of future changes in CH$ sb4$ flux from climate-induced changes in peatland hydrology.</description><creator>Bubier, Jill L.</creator><contributor>Moore, Tim R.

The articulated cantilevered system is composed of rigid cylindrical segments, interconnected by rotational springs, and is hanging vertically in the centre of a cylindrical pipe, with fluid flowing downwards in the narrow annular passage. The equations of motion were obtained by application of Lagrange's equations, for a system with an arbitrary number of articulations. The forces associated with the structure itself, i.e. the inertial, restoring and gravity forces acting on the structure, are taken into account in the kinetic and potential energies of the system. The hydrodynamic forces are incorporated partly in the kinetic energy and partly as generalized forces. As the articulated system interacts with the outer pipe, this interaction or impact is modelled by a cubic or a trilinear spring, or by using the coefficient of restitution method. The critical flow velocity for the onset of fluidelastic instabilities, such as divergence or flutter, is calculated by a linear eigenvalue analysis. Then, two models for the equations of motion are investigated, both analytically and numerically. Centre manifold and normal form theory are used to calculate the post-Hopf limit cycle amplitude, which will be compared with that obtained numerically. Phase portraits, power spectral densities and bifurcation diagrams indicate in some cases a clear period-doubling cascade leading to chaos, while in others chaos arises via the quasiperiodic route or via type III intermittency. In addition, Poincare maps and Lyapunov exponent calculations confirm the existence of quasiperiodicity or chaotic motion.</description><creator>Botez, Ruxandra, 1960-</creator><date>1994</date><subject>Engineering, Mechanical.</subject><title>Nonlinear dynamics of an articulated cylinder system subjected to confined axial flow</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/w95052034.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/w6634537q</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mechanical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:xk81jn00r</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:01:34Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Using a Wittgensteinian approach to understanding, this thesis extends and challenges recent feminist discussions of the ethic of care as a gender-sensitive corrective to traditional moral theory. It elaborates a more complex understanding of the diversity and ambiguity of the ethical possibilities of caring than has been presented in earlier analyses. A brief introduction to the contemporary debate is followed by accounts of six different examples of caring practices, viz: caring attention, taking care of oneself, mothering, friendship, nursing and citizenship. The aim of this survey is to show that caring constitutes an intricate labyrinth of ethical possibilities, the understanding of which involves approaching it from numerous directions. Through concern for the similarities and differences between these examples, their insights and their oversights, the thesis displays the limitations of theories which presume a unified, non-contexted ethic of care. At the same time the detailed descriptions of caring practices affirm the ethical significance of a range of activities that are frequently overlooked in conventional accounts of ethics.</description><creator>Bowden, Peta Lyn</creator><contributor>Tully, James (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1992</date><subject>Feminist ethics</subject><subject>Caring</subject><subject>Interpersonal relations -- Moral and ethical aspects</subject><title>Caring : an investigation in gender-sensitive ethics</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9p290c062.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xk81jn00r</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Philosophy</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><resumptionToken completeListSize="47894">oai_etdms.s(Collection:theses).f(2019-10-16T06:03:34Z).u(2020-07-23T18:55:55Z).t(47894):27900</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>
