      <note type="public_message">Toronto, Sept. 1908 Dear Folks I have just seen the Alberta Government exhibit at the Fair. Say! They must have a great province. Wheat goes as high as 60 bushels to the acre and from 30 to 40 is common. Oats yield from 40 to 100 bushel, and barley 30 to 50 bushel. You should see the unitation wheat field, the grand display of native and tame grasses and also clovers and alfalfa. Vegetables do well there, The climate is ideal for health. Coal is found in all parts of the Province. Coal oil and natural gas are also found there. If you are interested write to the Department of Agriculture, Edmonton or the Secretary of any Alberta Board  of Trade for literature With kind regards from Yours Sincerely</note>
