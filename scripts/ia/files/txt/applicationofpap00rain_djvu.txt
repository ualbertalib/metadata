ABSTRACT 


Paper partition chromatography was studied with a view to 
applying a knowledge of bacterial protein metabolism to the dif¬ 
ferentiation of closely related species of organisms. Several 
techniques were investigated and suitable apparatus was evolved 
and prepared. Eventually the method of Consden, Gordon, and Martin 
(1944) was adopted with personal modifications* 

The method was applied to the study of amino acid utilization 
and synthesis of 56 strains of paracolon bacilli, representing 3 
species in the genus Paracolobactrum - P. aerogenoides, P. coliforrae, 
and P, intermedium. Following the procedure outlined by Proom and 
Woiwod ( 19 ^ 9 )» using strip chromatography and various types of 
media, the amino acid composition of cultural filtrates of these 
bacteria was studied. 

Amino acid utilization and synthesis of Paracolobactrum sp. was 
compared with their biochemical and serological reactions. A study 
was made of the relationship of metabolic activity between Para¬ 
colobactrum species and species of related genera - Escherichia, 
Aerobacter, and Salmonella. 

Amino acid metabolism was found to b© considerably affected by 
variations in media. Not only quantitatively, as might have been 
anticipated, but qualitatively as well. It is probable that these 
species require the presence of certain amino acids as coenzymes to 
activate a number of their enzyme systems. 

Nevertheless, it was concluded that a characteristic patteron of

amino acid utilization and synthesis was possessed by each species 
in the genus Paracolobactrum, differentiated on the basis of rout¬ 
ine biochemical reactions (Borman et al 1944 )* Selective utiliza¬ 
tion of basic amino acids (lysine, arginine, histidine) and aspartic 
acid is a species differential factor* 

Only a group relationship exists between metabolic activity 
involving amino acid utilization and synthesis and that involving 
biochemical and serological reactions* 

Metabolic activity of Paracolobactrum species is interrelated 
with species of all related genera* Characteristic activities of 
both coliforms and salmonellae are exhibited by all species of para¬ 
colons suggesting that they are truly the evolutionary link between 
coliforms and salmonellae. 

Paper partition chromatography is an excellent microanalytical 
method for the qualitative study of amino acid utilization and 
synthesis in bacterial culture filtrates.

LITERATURE REVIEW 







Introduction and Literature Review 


In 1906* a Russian "botanist, Mikhail Tswett, first enunciated the 
general principle of chromatography and devised a method to separate 
the pigments of plants into their individual constituents. Papers 
were published until 1912 by Tswett, hut the method was disregarded 
hy the scientific world until 1931 when Kuhn and Lederer applied it t© 
the separation of carotene (a plant pigment) into two isomeric hydro¬ 
carbons* alpha- and beta-carotene. Column chromatography was the 
method employed hy these men. 

In column chromatography the mixture under examination was diss¬ 
olved with a suitable solvent, ^his solution was allowed to percolate 
through a column of adsorbent material such as calcium carbonate* 
alumina, etc. * in a glass tube. After adsorption of the solution at 
the top of the column by the adsorbent material, individual chemical 
compounds were separated linearly into horizontal bands by passing a 
suitable solvent, a non polar liquid, through the column. This 
solvent might or might not be the same as that used to prepare the 
primary solution. When the desired separation was obtained, the 
column of adsorbent was removed from the percolator. Bands were 
separated by cutting the column at appropriate points. The various 
zones were then eluted (with an eluant like ethyl alcohol) and the 
materials in the eluant identified. Colored substances could be 
detected readily, but colorless substances were troublesome, often 
requiring considerable ingenuity in their collection. 

Column chromatography has had a wide range of application to the

study of vitamins, pharmaceuticals, chlorophylls, carotenoids, and 
amino acids, A quantitative method, using the anhydrous raw potato 
starch column of %sden and Synge (1944), was devised hy Stein and 
Moore (1948) for their work with amino acids. In this, the diff¬ 
erent effluent fractions were collected in different tubes, the 
mechanism being controlled by a photoelectric cell. 

Partition chromatography was a later development. The partit¬ 
ion mechanism depended not on adsorption on a solid phase, but on 
the partition of solutes between two liquid phases. Although the 
discoverers of this technique, Martin and Synge (l94l) used silica 
gel, already familiar in column chromatography, they used it for 
its ability to absorb water without becoming “wet% and not for its 
adsorbent capacity* They applied this to the micro-determination of 
the higher monamino acids in protein, and with A, H, Gordon (1943) 
made a study of protein constituents in wool hydrolysates. However, 
they found that silica gel absorbed the acetoamino acids and therefore 
good separations could net be obtained* 

A further development in partition chromatography came in 1944 
when Consden, Gordon, and Martin published their classical paper, 

“The Qualitative Analysis of Proteins — A Partition Chromatographic 
Method Using Paper,” Instead of using silica gel partition chromat¬ 
ogram, cellulose was used in the form of filter paper. The method was 
technically similar to the “capillary analysis” method of Schombein 
and Goppelsroeder (l86l). These authors separated dyes and other sub¬ 
stances by allowing solutions to rise in strips of filter paper. Sep¬ 
aration was obtained by the differences in adsorption of these substances 
by the cellulose. Partition chromatography, however, depends on the 
differences between the mobile phase and water—saturate cellulose.

The adsorption of amino acids "by cellulose plays no significant part. 
This was confirmed hy the work of England and Cohn (lS35), who con¬ 
cluded that cellulose acted merely as an inert support. 


Principles of Paper Partition Chromatography 


Chromatographic separations depend upon repeated partition of 
the solute between the adsorbent and the solvent* It involves a 
dynamic distribution of dissolved or dispersed solute (substances) 
between two phases, one mobile (solvent), the other nonmobile 
(adsorbent), one of \*hich is moving past the other* This Repeated 
partition takes place only when a dynamic equilibrium exists between 
solvent, solute, and adsorbent. 

Stationary phase ^ T-T T .,3 .^Mobile phase 
Solutes Solutes 




The mixture to be resolved is absorbed by the filter paper, 
which when washed with fresh solvent, allows the solutes to migrate 
through the porous nonmobile phase at different rates and thus to 
separate one from the other* 

M A single solute molecule migrates in an adsorptive substance 
only when it is in solution* When it is held by the adsorbent, it 
remains stationary as the solvent flows past, ^he longer it is 
held by the adsorbent, the slower it migrates. If two solute mole¬ 
cules differ in the time that they are retained by the adsorbent, 
they will migrate through an adsorption column at different rates. 18 
(Strain 1949, 1951). 

Therefore the rate of migration varies with the substance ex¬ 
amined, the slowest at the top of the column and the fastest at the 
bottom of the column in descending chromatography, while the reverse 
is true in ascending chromatography*

H Many molecules of a single solute migrate through an adsorptive 
column at a rate which is determined by the flow of solvent and by 
the ratio of the molecules in solution to those adsorbed. n 
w — — — the distance moved by the bands of the adsorbed solutes is 
also related to the distance moved by the solvent.

Amount solute adsorbed distance moved by solvent 

(Strain 19^9)• 

The relation of partition coefficient to rate of movement of 

the bands has been established mathematically by Martin and Synge 

(19^1)* Separation depends on differences in partition coefficient 

between the mobile phase and water-saturated adsorbent.

In practice however, the Bp value is determined by comparing 
the distance the amino acid has moved from a reference line (point 
of application of mixture to be analyzed), to the distance the 
solvent front has moved from the same line. This ratio is the Bp 
value for a specific amino acid in a specific set of circumstances. 

,f Rp value is a useful means of indicating the approximate position 
which a substance will occupy on a chromatogram* It cannot be used by 
itself to identify an amino acid or peptide with certainty; this can be 
done only by noting other things in addition, such as shad© of color 
produced by the ninhydrin, position relative to other amino acids. Bp 
value in some second solvent, and by running on the same chromatogram a 
control mixture containing known amino acids*" (Woiwod 1949) 

The reproducability of Bp values depends on the constancy of six 
factors; paper, temperature, quantity of substance used, extraneous 
substances, degree of saturation with water, supply of solvent, and 
distances between starting point and source of solvent* 

Certain Factors Influencing Chromatographic Separation 

Mixtures of solvents are very often used. Thy must be of one 
hundred per cent purity or poor separation will result. The most 
satisfactory solvents are organic, and are those partially, miscible 
with water* Within a homologous series of solvents, the rates of 
movement of the dissolved amino acids change in direct ratio to the

water solubility of the solvent, therefore, solvents completely miscihle 
with water can he employed provided that the water content is not too high. 
Cellulose, hy a 1 salting out® effect allows the system to function as a 
partition chromatogram. Due to variation in the composition of the phases 
caused hy the presence of amino acids, amino acid hands obtained with mis¬ 
cible solvents are much broader than those obtained with immiscible solv¬ 
ents, This was noticed by England and Cohn (1935) and is therefore the 
limiting factor in the amount of amino acid that can be estimated in a 
given chromatogram. Phases are more easily disturbed by employing a 
miscible rather than an immiscible solvent. 

Temperature affects the rate of the movement of the bands due to a 
change in the composition of the phases, e.g. in a phenol-water system, 
as the temperature increases, the miscibility increases and the rate of 
movement of the bands increases. In a collidine—water system, the reverse 
is true. The greater the difference between the washing temperature and 
the critical solution temperature, the less sensitive will the movement of 
the solutes be to a change of temperature. 

Although the absolute partition coefficients may be affected by var¬ 
iable factors (temperature, paper, etc.), the ratios of the partition 
coefficients are almost unaltered. The relative position of amino acids 
in a chromatogram depend upon the solvent used. Therefore, by allowing 
one solvent to flow first in one direction, followed by a second solvent 
flowing in a direction at right angles to the first, amino acids deposited 
near the corner of a sheet of filter paper become distributed in a pattern 
across the sheet to give a two-dimensional chromatogram, characteristic of 
the pair of solvents used.

Technical Applications of Chromatography 


Much work has been aone using paper partition chromatography not 
only with amino acids (Consden et al 1944), hut also with sugars 
(Partridge 1946), organic acids (Lugg and Overell 1947), and keto acids 
(Cavallini 1949)• The essentials of apparatus and principles of method 
as outlined hy Consden, Cordon, and Martin (1944) have been applied to 
many fields of biochemical analysis using partition chromatography, 
being modified to suit the conditions and materials with which workers 
were dealing. 

The usual technique was to suspend a filter paper strip, the upper 
end of which was immersed in a trough containing water-saturated solvent, 
in an airtight chamber with an atmosphere saturated with water and solvent. 
The trough was provided with a bar over which the paper passed t© prevent 
capillary siphoning between the outside of the trough and the paper. 

As a chamber, Consden at al (1944) used a wooden box lined with wax, 
with a glass window, and a rubber—stripped lid, screwed down to keep it 
airtight. Rectangular glass aquaria were often used. All the joints and 
lower part of the sides were covered with a layer of paraffin. The chamber 
was covered by a heavy glass plate and pressed down with a weight to make 
a seal, (Block 1950). It is now possible to obtain special tanks, fully 
equipped for chromatographic work from various scientific supply houses. 

Class troughs were first made by sealing one inch glass tubing (pyrex), 
and grinding down the opening for a trough (Consden 1944). In 1948 Longeu— 
ecker suggested using a glass cutter (a carborundum disc) to cut the trough 
opening, while Steward (1948) suggested a method for making an enamel- 
coated metal trough. However it is now possible to purchase glass troughs 
of desired lengths from supply houses.

Filter paper found to "be most satisfactory "by various workers was 
Whatman No. 1 (Consden et al 1944), Whatman No. 4 (Proora and Woiwod 

1949), Schlucher—Schull Ho. 507 (Bull 1949), No. 598 (Block 1950). 

Solvents used varied with materials and conditions. For amino 
acids, using single-dimensional chromatography, 4n-butanol: 5 water! 

1 glacial acetic acid were mixed, the upper layer used as solvent in 
the trough, the "bottom layer used in the "bottom of the tank to maintain 
a saturated atmosphere of water and solvent. (Froom and V/oiwod 1949). 
Butanol—acetic acid was used as a primary solvent, and phenol—water as 
a secondary solvent, (Consden 1944, and Proom 1949), Phenol-water and 
collidine-lutidine (l:1) were primary and secondary solvents in two- 
dimensional chromatography used "by Dent (194?) in his work on the detec¬ 
tion of free amino acids in plant cells. Many other organic solvents 
have "been used which have "been reviewed "by Bently and Whitehead (195®) 
in a discussion on water miscible solvents in relation to chromatography 
of amino acids. 

For the development of amino acid spots most workers have used a 
0*1$ (w/v) solution of ninhydrin (triketohydrindene hydrate) in n—butanol. 
(Consden 1944). This has proven generally satisfactory* Protein and its 
derivatives appear as purple spots of varying shades in reaction with 
ninhydrin. There are some exceptions to this however, e.g. proline appears 
as a yellow spot. Dent (1948) made a study of the color reactions and 
occurrence in biological fluids of sixty amino acids and other ninhydrin 
reacting substances on phenol-collidine filter paper chromatograms.

Application of Chromatography to Bacterial Metabolism 

In 1949 Woiwod put forth a general technique for the examination 
of large numbers of bacterial culture filtrates by partition chromat¬ 
ography (from the original work by Consden et al 1944), While study¬ 
ing the nitrogen metabolism of micro-organisms it was found necessary 
to prepare large numbers of single-dimensional chromatograms, therefore 
the paper was published describing methods and apparatus employed to 
aid workers using this ”elegant analytical method." 

Proom and Woiwod in 1949 applied the general method to the examin¬ 
ation of the nitrogen metabolism of bacteria in which 300 strains ©f 
bacteria representing 20 genera were grown on a special medium (acid 
hydrolysate of casein, 3g* U/l., yeast extract, growth factors and 
metallic salts with 0,1$ added glucose), selected for the purpose of 
giving clear chromatograms uncomplicated by the initial presence of 
polypeptide or protein. The bacterial culture filtrates were examined 
for amino acid utilization and polypeptide formation. The purpose was 
to obtain a general picture of a few of the aspects of nitrogen metab¬ 
olism of bacteria using a selected medium and to determine if there 
were strain, species, and group differences. 

Using this paper as a basis, I proceeded to apply the same general 
principles and methods in my work dealing with the utilization of amino 
acids by paracolons. 

The Paracolon Bacteria 


The paracolons are a group of organisms in the tribe Eschericheae 
(Eergey 1948). They are included in the coliform group of gram-negative

rods* and are characterized by their slow fermentation of lactose* 

It is suggested that they are a transitional group "between the 
lactose and non-lactose fermenters in the family Enterobacteriaceae. 

Their history is fairly recent* In 1893» Gilbert and Lion 
termed a group of non-lactose fermenting conforms, found in the 
stool of dysentery patients, paracolon "bacilli* Similar bacteria 
with variable "biochemical activities were found "by later workers 
who isolated them from stools of paratyphoid, typhoid, and dysentery 
patients and from normal healthy persons* 

There has "been much controversy over the definition of para- 
colon "bacilli* 

H The term has "been used in "bacteriological literature to des¬ 
cribe a certain variety of coliform bacillus not infrequently isol¬ 
ated from human faeces especially in the tropics* H (Erodes 194&) 

Gyorgy (1920) described them as? 

H Non—lactose fermenters, the majority failed to ferment suc¬ 
rose, producing acid and gas in glucose, maltose, mannite, xylose, 
rhamnose, dulcitol* Litmus milk was made acid or alkaline, indole 
produced, but all were non-motile♦ 

Trawinski (1924) found the majority to be motile, with different 
reactions in xylose and dulcitol* He placed them in four groups 
according to their biochemical activities and found that they were 
serologically specific within these groups* Fothergill (1929) termed 
them 5 inagglutinable paratyphoids 5 . Abdoosh (1934) found - 

55 the paracolon group antigenicslly heterogeneous and its members 
readily distinguishable by their positive indole reaction*” 


Saudiford in 1935 started: 






















’’The term paracolon is befittingly applied to the group of 
coliform organisms which culturally resemble B.coli, excepting 
in that they either do not ferment lactose, or ferment it atypi- 
cally. 11 

The term ‘aberrant conforms* was suggested by Stuart et al (1940) 
their fermentation of lactose (producing less than 20$ gas in 48 
hours at 3?° c )* Four groups of ‘aberrant conforms’ were proposed 
on the basis of lactose fermentation and consequent gas production. 

In 194-3 Stuart et al divided ‘aberrant conforms’, on the basis of 
biochemical and serological tests, into three groups; Paracolon 
aerobacter. Paracolon intermeidates. Paracolon Escherichia. 

n A Taxonomy of the Family Enterbacteriaceae* 8 was proposed by 
Borman, Stuart, and Wheeler, in 1944. A revision of Bergey’s 
(Hahn) classification of Enterobacteriaceae was suggested and in 
that was included a species classification of the paracolons. 

“The family Enterobacteriaceae has been we11 defined by 
tradition and, usage, therefore no radical change in definition is 
necessary, but it fails to point out the manner in which many 
forms comp raising the family intergrade with each other to form 
an almost continuous series” 

was suggested by these workers. 

!,M The degree of interrelationship suggests that we are dealing 
with organisms having a common phyiogeny but existing in a state of 
evolutionary flux. The following description of the family is 
suggested: 

n Gram_negative, non—sporogenic, straight rods, widely distributed 
in nature. Grow well on artificial media. All species attack glucose 
forming acid or acid and visible gas (H 2 present). Characteristically 
nitrites produced from nitrates. When motile, the flagella are peritri- 
chous. The family consists of innumerable intergrading races, types, 
or varieties divisible into genera only because of the relative

stability of certain characters which appear to represent 
1 way—stations* along the path of evolution of this family 
wherein the composite picture suggests an evolutionary trend 
towards commensal or parasitic existence and is characterized 
by increasing specialization and the phenomenon of loss varia¬ 
tion. Certain types must be regarded as transitional forms. 
Antigenic composition is best described as a mosaic which re¬ 
sults in serological interrelationship among the several 
genera even extending to other families, 1 ” 5 

The authors of the article thought that because of lack 
of generic differentiation, paracolons — aerogenic and anaerogenic— 
were often mistaken for known pathogens, and when they were properly 
identified were discarded as of 5, no significance”. Hence, they pro¬ 
posed a differentiation of paracolons within themselves, and from 
the rest of the family on the basis of the rate of lactose fermenta¬ 
tion. 


”Examining the whole family suggests that loss or alterations 
of ability to split lactose marks one of the ’way—stations* along 
the evolutionary path of the organism - one of the transition points 
between commensal and parasitic existence.” 

The following standard was suggested by them; 

”Rapid fermentation of lactose be defined as fermentation within 
24 hours at 37°G, or within 48 hours at 30 °C or below, depending upon 
the temperature found optimal for the organism under study.” 


A large group of lata»lactose fermenters, i.e, paracolons — 
aerogenic, anaerogenic, and non-lactose fermenters, which were ex¬ 
cluded by definition from Proteus, Salmonella, or Shigella could only 
be divided into aerogenic and anaerogenic groups on the basis of 
carbohydrate utilization.

The Cenns Paracolobactrum gen nov (from the Creek near or resemb¬

slowly (occasionally, ©r not at all), intermediate or transitional forms 
not conforming to the other genera shown in the table, 

H,, The term ’paracolon’ has come to occupy an established place in 
the literature as a result of inadequacies of taxonomic systems. No 
doubt that many of these forms are allied to Colohactrum and others to 
Salmonella, Coed evidence has been shown that some are pathogenic for 
man and animals. The paracolon forms deserve generic rank if only to 
direct attention to this group and to enable those who work with them to 
talk a common language. The following description is proposed for the 
classification of these aerogenic strains excluded from other genera in

the key previously given: 

"Aerobic, non-sporogenic, gram-negative rods, characterized by 
consistently delayed fermentation of lactose (occasionally negative). 
Glucose is fermented with formation of visible gas. Certain forms 
attack carbonhydrates characteristically at 25 to 30 °C. but not at 3?°C» 
Antigenic relationships to other genera in the family are common even 
with respect to major antigens."* 1 

As yet, these workers have had no means of determining the 
relative importance of biochemical characters, antigenic structure, 
habitat or pathogenic!by in the classification of organisms grouped 
here. However, they suggested that a current plan similar to that used 
for Colobactrum be used. The following species were suggested: 

"I. Acetylmethylcarbinol produced (other characteristics as for 
the genera-) 

1. Paracolobactrum aerogenoides sp. nov. 

(Latinized resembling aerogenes.) 

2. Acetylmethylcarbinol not produced 

A. Citric acid utilized as sole source of caron (other 
characteristics as for genera.) 

2. Paracolobactrum intermedium sp. nov. 

(From the Latin intermidiate.) 

B. Citric acid not, utilized as sole source of carbon 
(other characteristics as for genera) 

3. Paracolobactrum coliforme sp. nov. 

(Latinized resembling coli)."

The authors of the article suggested that the system he not static, 
hut as more knowledge accumulated, the system could he revised accordingly, 
and that their proposed taxonomy could he a guide toward other fields of 
investigations. 

All these workers have confirmed their investigations hy simple 
biochemical behaviour and serological analysis. Chromatographic analysis 
in its application to bacteria revealed a new horizon to investigators 
and opened up a new and promising field of investigation. 

With the aid of paper partition chromatography, a study of the 
amino acid metabolism (utilization and synthesis) of paracolon bacilli 
as defined by Borman et al (1944) was undertaken.

METHODS 

Using the "basic method of paper partition chromatography presented 
"by Consden, Gordon, and Martin (1944) and the same general procedure of 
analysis of "bacterial culture filtrates as Proom and Woiwod (1949)» 1 
proceeded to set up chromatographic apparatus to analyze the amino acid cont¬ 
ent of cultural filtrates of paracolon "bacilli. 

Chromatographic Apparatus 

Tanks and Accessories . Two types of tanks were used. One was modelled 
after that of Consden et al (1944) — a wax-lined wooden chamber with a glass 
window and an airtight, rubber—stripped, screw—down top. Dimensions were 
9 in. wide, 52 in. long, 54 in. deep. (Fig.L) The other, a rectangular glass 
aquarium (Block 1950), of two sizes: a smaller one for one-dimensional 
chromatography - 1ft. wide 1.5 ft. long, 2 ft. deep (Figs.2,3,)$ a larger 
one for two-dimensional chromatography — 1 ft. wide, 3 ft. long, 2 ft. deep. 
Both had rubber—stripped plate glass lids which were weighted down to main¬ 
tain airtight conditions. Petrolatum was used as a seal. Much difficulty 
was experienced due to corrosion of metal parts in both tanks, especially 
in the aquaria. Belining the tanks with wax became a periodic procedure. 
Later, petrolatum was found to serve the same purpose but was easier to 
apply. 

Several inches from the top and running the length of each tank, 
four glass rods were installed. Two lower ones to support the glass 
trough and two others slightly to one side and above these to support the 
filter paper passing over them from the trough. The edge of the vertic¬ 
ally suspended filter paper was held in place in the trough by a small 
beaker (Fig 4).

Troughs . Glass troughs were made following the directions of 
Consden et al (1944)* Pyrex tubing of one inch internal diameter was 
used to make troughs of 8 and 26 inch lengths* After sealing the tube 
at both ends, and leaving an air vent for air expansion, an opening the 
length of the tube was ground with a grindstone. (Pilkington Glass Co*, 
Edmonton, Alberta). The opening was wide enough to permit entry of filter 
paper into the trough* Later, Pyrex glass troughs of the same lengths 
were purchased from Scientific Supply Houses, Hew Jersey, U.S.A. Both 
types were quite satisfactory* 

Solvents and Level oners . Solvent used for strip chromatography 
was that suggested by Proom and Woiwod (1949)» 4 n-butanol: 5 water: 

1 glacial acetic acid (all parts V/V). After separation in a separatory 
funnel, the top layer was put in the trough and the bottom layer in the 
bottom of the tank. This was also used as a primary solvent for two- 
dimensional work, the second solvent being water saturated phenol( the 
bottom layer formed in a separatory funnel) (Proom and Woiwod 1949)• 
Addition of 30 $ ammonia to water at the bottom of the tank prevented 
oxidation of the phenol. 

A 0.1$ (w/v) solution of ninhydrin (triketohydrindene hydrate - 
Eastman Kodak Co.) in n-butanol acted as a developer of amino acid spots 
in the chromatogram. (The reaction of ninhydrin with protein and its 
derivatives, as in this instance, is referred to as development of the 
chromatogram.) Later, a 0.2$ solution of ninhydrin was found to produce 
more deeply colored spots* Spraying of sheets was done with an atomizer.

Miscellaneous. A cardboard "box, set on its side end heated "by a 
200 watt lamp or a hot plate, acted as an oven to dry the chromatograms. 

Reading of chromatograms was facilitated "by a * sheet-illuminator 1 . 

This consisted of a wooden "box, lined with white paper, and containing a 
light source (a 60 watt, white light lamp). Sheets were placed over the 
open end, and light passing through, tended to make the spots more distinct, 

Chromatogre/phic Procedure 

Preparation of Substances to he Examined * The substance to he examined 
was dissolved with a suitable solvent, Following Block’s suggestion (1950), 
amino acid standards (for determining values) were made up in solution 
with 10$ isopropyl alcohol. When peptides (or proteins) were to be examined, 
they were hydrolysed with 6N HCX, and the hydrolysate put into solution with 
butanol (Bate-Smith 1950) or with isopropyl alcohol (Block 1950)* If bacter¬ 
ial culture filtrates were to be the test substances, suitable medium was 
prepared, inoculated, and incubated for a specific length of time. When 
pathogenic organisms were used, the culture medium was either Seitz- 
filtered or steamed for one hour before aliquots were taken to be analyzed, 

One-Dimensional Chromatography . Several days were required to bring 
a tank to e<pu.ilibri\un by saturation of the atmosphere within the tank with 
solvents used. Strips or standard-size sheets of Whatman No. 1 filter paper 
(22.5 x 18,25 inches) were marked in pencil with a series of dots, each at 
a distance of three inches from the top of the shorter dimension, using strips, 
or from the top of the longer dimension, using a standard—size sheet. These 
dots were placed one inch apart, and were labelled with the appropriate label.

0.005 ffil* .(8 micro gm. amino N) aliquots were applied per spot with 
0.2 ml. serological pipettes. Urbach (1949) suggested the use of mic¬ 
ropipettes preferably, because v/hen ends were applied to the paper almost 
exactly 0.005 nil was drawn out of the pipette by capillary action of 
the paper, no pressure being required otherwise. Some workers dried 
the spot with a heat source (Woiwod 1949) but this was found to be 
unsatisfactory. Air drying seemed to produce the best results. 

The sheet was then suspended in the tank for approximately one 
hour to saturate it with the atmosphere prevailing, before placing 
the edge, containing test material, into the solvent in the trough. 

After immersion in the solvent, the lid was put on, and the. chromato¬ 
gram was allowed to form by downflow of the solvent - descending chrom¬ 
atography. 

After the solvent front had travelled 30 to 40 cm. from the point 
of application of substances (24 to 30 hours) the paper was removed 
from the tank, the solvent front marked with a pencil, and the sheet 
suspended in an oven at 80 ° 0 . for approximately one-half to one hour 
or until dry. It was then sprayed with reagent and was redried in the 
oven until amino acid spots appeared. Nicholson* s modification (1949) 
was applied to later work. He suggested incorporation of 0.1$ ninhy- 
drin solution directly into the solvent to avoid spraying. Only one 
heat treatment was required then instead of two. Colors were found to 
be more intense by this method. This modification applied only to but¬ 
anol-acetic or collidine, not to phenol. •Steam-drying* of the chroma¬ 
tograms, by means of a pan of steaming water in the oven, was found to

quicken the appearance of amino acid spots, intensify their color, and 
make them more permanent. Trouble with fading of spots by overheating 
was counteracted by ’steam-drying'. 

Two-Dimensional Chromatography . The same general procedure was 
followed in two-diminsional chromatography, with the exception that 
two solvents were employed, each with a different direction of flow. 

0.01 ml. of solution to be analyzed was placed near one comer, 
three inches from either edge, of a standard-size sheet of Whatman No« 1 
filter paper. One edge of the filter paper was immersed in butanol- 
acetic solvent, and the chromatogram was allowed to form for approxim¬ 
ately 24 hours (until the solvent front had reached the bottom of the 
sheet). It was then removed and dried for one hour* The sheet was 
then rotated 90 degrees and returned to a second tank containing 
phenol as the solvent. The edge was immersed in solvent and th© 
chromatogram further allowed to form for 36 hours. At the end of 
this time the sheet was removed, dried for 2 hours, sprayed with 
reagent (ninhydrin solution), and finally * steam-dried* until amino 
acid spots appeared. 

Not much success was had with this second method, therefore it 
was put aside and emphasis was placed on strip chromatography as it 
was quicker, more convenient, through not as accurate (i.e. in inter¬ 
pretation) a method to examine large numbers of paracolon cxilture 
filtrates* 

Chromatographic Analysis Applied 

JR-p Values. Rj, values of each of the twenty amino acids dealt 
with were determined for each tank used in strip chromatography.

A standard solution of each amino acid was made with isopropyl 
alcohol as solvent* Five micro litre aliquots were spotted to fil¬ 
ter paper, and with "butanol-acetic solvent, the chromatogram was al¬ 
lowed to form for 24 hours in the wooden tank, or for 30 hours in 
the small aquarium. Actually only the relative positions of amino 
acids, in relation to each other were looked for* However Rj, values, 
as reference data, were calculated from the formula given "by Martin 
and Synge (l94l) referred to earlier* 

Amino acids in media and in paracolon culture filtrates, when 
chromatogrammed were matched with the standardized amino acid 
values* 

Organisms * Paracolon strains were obtained from the Enterobac- 
teriology Dept, of the Alberta Provincial Public Health Laboratory* 
These consisted of 37 strains of Paracolobactrum aerogenoides, 9 
strains of P» intermedium, and 9 strains of P. coliforme. Their 
classification had been based on the “Enteric Taxonomy” of Borman 
et at (1944). (Refer to Introduction pgs* 11 and 12.)

were also studied, 


Stock organisms were kept on plain agar slants, and were trans¬ 
ferred every two months. They were plated each time to ensure pure 
cultures. All inoculations of test media with organisms were made 
directly from slant to medium* 

Medium . Organisms were inoculated to various media. In addition 
to seven routine laboratory media — peptone water, nutrient broth, 
lactose, sucrose, dextrose, mannite, and buffered dextrose broths — 
and Difco's tryptophane assay medium, special media were made up of 
varying amino acid content, each medium divided into two batches, one 
containing a small, the other a large supply of carbombydrate (dextrose). 

Amino acids in the routine laboratory media used were derived 
from extraction of animal muscle protein, while these in the tryptoph¬ 
ane assay medium were from Bacto vitamin-free casamino acids* Special 
media contained a variable number of pure amino acids (BjDH) , the media 
designated I, II, and III containing respectively eleven, seven, and 
one*

(Refer to Harrow 1950* and Mitchell 1950 for numerical representation 
of amino acid composition of casein and heef muscle.) 

Growth. Routine laboratory media was dispensed in 3 ml. amounts in 
cotton stoppered culture tubes while tryptophane assay and special media 
were dispensed in 5 ml# amounts. pH of all media was from 7*0 to 7.6. 

Media were seeded with loopfuls of inoculum from stock cultures. The 
cultures were incubated at 37°C for 2k- hours usually. However, time of 
incubation did vary with the experiment being done. Various routine bio¬ 
chemical tests were also performed on the cultural filtrates after ali— 
qots to be chromatogrammed were taken. These consisted of the IMYiC 
tests (indole, methyl red, Voges-Proskauer, citrate). Fermentation 
reactions in sugar broths were also noted. Table III gives a detailed 
description of work done. 

Chromatographic Analysis . Culture filtrates were examined by the 
chromatographic technique stated earlier. Five micro litres of each 
filtrate was tested; 19 filtrates were examined on standard-sized 
sheets of filter paper used in the large wooden tank, while 7 filtrates 
were examined on smaller filter paper sheets in the amall aquarium. 

At each end and in the middle of the series of spots on the large sheet 
and at one end of the smaller sheet, uninoculated medium was always 
included as a control. The chromatograms after development, were exam¬ 
ined, the results recorded, and a permanent photographic record was 
taken of noteworthy chromatograms. 

A Recent Modification. A new modification of chromatography has 
been developed by Proom and Woiwod (l95l) which is called disc chromat¬ 
ography. This method is a very simple one employing filter paper discs

instead of strips or sheets, Proom and Woiwod surveyed the dis¬ 
tribution of glutamic acid decarboxylase in the family Entero- 
bacteriaceae using this method. 

An attempt was mde to survey distribution of GAD in Paracolo- 
b act rum sp. using the same technique but it proved unsuccessful.

Rji values are not constant. As was stated previously, they 
vary with conditions under which they are determined. In Table 
the difference in % values from the two tanks is evident, hut on 
any chromatogram the relative position of each amino acid remained 
constant. Consequently it was often simple, from a knowledge of 
these relative positions, to identify spots on a chromatogram as 
individual amino acids when they were derived from an uninoculated 
culture medium of known composition* 

Nevertheless the min disadvantage of strip chromatography was 
found to he the difficulty of identifying amino acids whose Ejj values 
were very close, because they appeared as one spot on a chromatogram. 
This was found to b© the case with the three basic amino acids 
(Basic referring to chemical structure of the amino acids with respect 
to NH2 configuration) - lysine, arginine, and histidine, and with the 
following pairs2 serine and glycine (the latter was distinguished 
by its red color), glutamic acid and threonine, methionine and valine, 
isoleucine and leucine. However, it was found that if the chromat¬ 
ogram was allowed to form for a longer period - 36 hours - i.e. when 
the solvent was allowed to run off the sheet, more complete separat¬ 
ion of amino acids resulted. Later, when media were mad© up with sel¬ 
ected amino acids (i.e. those found to be used by the organisms) 
this difficulty was largely eliminated, because usually only one acid 
of each overlapping group was included, ^he relative positions of 
amino acids separated chromatogmphically from such a control medium 
are indicated in Tig. 5*

Amino Acid Utilization 

Utilization of an amino acid was indicated by the diminution 
in intensity or disappearance of its chromatographic M spot M in 
comparison with a control. 

Based on this criterion amino acid utilization of Par&colo- 
lobactrum sp. was studied in simple media of complex amino acid 
composition, and in media containing a supply of both protein 
and carbohydrate. Metabolism of amino acids in special media 
consisting of a few selected amino acids was also considered. 

Amino Acid Utilization in Complex Protein Media by Paracolobac- 

tram sp » 

Tryptophane assay medium (Difco) was used at the beginning 
of experimental work for it contained a source ©f protein already 
broken down into its simplest constituents * amino acids - which 
could be easily separated and identified by paper partition chrom¬ 
atography. Evidence of the utilization of specific amino acids by 
organisms growing in such a medium could easily be obtained by the 
chromatographic examination of culture filtrates. 

Media containing only protein - peptone water and nutrient broth- 
were treated in a similar manner and results obtained were much the 
same (Fig.6). 

?. aerogenoi&es . (Table V. ) The majority of strains tested 
metabolized the basic group of amino acids but not aspartic acid. 
Serine was utilized extensively, glutamic acid not so much, and al¬ 
anine only sparsely. All the rest of the amino acids contained in 
the media used were not visibly metabolized (this applies to other 
species also.)

P.intermedium , (Table VI.) Basic amino acids were not utilized by 
the majority of strains, but aspartic acid and serine were, Glutamic acid 
was occasionally used. No significant loss of alanine was noted except in 
peptone water, whose amino acids were highly utilized by the bacteria present. 

A few strains produced rough variants. These were tested along with 
the parent strains and their metabolism did not differ much from the smooth 
parent forms. Most rough variants followed parent forms very closely. 

P. colifonne . (Table VII.) Basic amino acids were never utilized. 

Aspartic acid was not usually utilized either, but some strains did metab¬ 
olise it* Serine was used by almost all strains while glutamic acid was used 
by fewer strains and not as consistently. Lack of utilization of alanine 
was again evident except by a few strains in peptone water. 

The degree of growth of an organism was determined by the amount of 
turbidity it produced in liquid culture. In all routine lab media, used 
(both protein and carbohydrate-protein broths), turbidity was approximately 
the same in all cultures. Therefore lack of utilization of certain amino 
acids by strains could not be attributed t© lack of growth by those strains. 

In tryptophane assay mediumnuch more variation of turbidity was noted® 

The amount of amino acid utilized corresponded to the degree of growth in the 
medium| hut characteristic utilization still remained. 

Experiment VII (Table III) was carried out to determine the time 
sequence of amino acid utilization by these organisms. With all species 
serine was usually the first amino acid utilize! by these organisms. 

With all species serine was usually the first amino acid to be used. 

P.intermedium showed first indications of serine utilization at 18 hours, 
P.aerogenoides at 24 hours and P.coliforme at 2? hours of incubation.

Utilization of other amino acids became evident simultaneously or shortly 
after these times. Therefore, all determinations made in other media were 
on a 24 hour incubation basis supplemented at times by 48 hour deter¬ 
minations. The metabolism studied was probably that occurring in the 
latter half of the growth curve of bacteria. 

Of the three media used, metabolism seemed most extensive in nutrient 
broth and in peptone water, but was somewhat retarded in tryptophan© 
assay medium. Glutamic acid and alanine were seldom, if ever, visibly 
used in the latter medium by the bacterial population, ^he retarded 
utilization may have been due to not as prolifient growth in the medium. 

It was noted that a specific pattern of utilization of certain 
amino acids was followed by each species which, as will b© shown, 
persisted in all media employed. 

Amino Acid Utilization in Media Containing Both Complex Protein and 

Carbohydrate ♦ 

The media used were the various sugar broths- lactose, dextrose, 
sucrose, mannite, and buffered dextrose. These had a nutrient broth 
base to which was added each specific saccaride, thus supplying the 
organism with two sources of food - protein and carbohydrate. Ex¬ 
perimental approach was similar to that previously described, and the 
results obtained were similar in nature. 

P. aerogenoides. (Table V.) Basic amino acids were utilized, 
aspartic acid was not (except in dextrose broth by a few strains), 
serine and glutamic acid were both extensively used, especially 
serine, ^lanine was metabolized to a limited extent only in lactose 


broth and in dextrose broth cultures

Utilization of amino acids was most evident in lactose and dex¬ 
trose cultures. 

P. intermedium. (Table VI) The basics were not used by the 
majority of strains yet a few strains seemed to utilise them in 
all broths. Aspartic acid was metabolized, ^erin® was also very 
generally used, but strangely not in lactose broth. Glutamic acid 
was quite extensively utilized. Ho significant utilization of alanine 
was noted, ’Saino acid utilisation in buffered dextrose was generally 
poor. 

Rough variants followed parent strains closely in their metab¬ 
olism. 

P. coliforme . (Table YU). All strains showed negative utili¬ 
zation of the ba,sic group of amino acids. A few strains did use aspartic 
but the majority did not. serine was much used. A fair proportion 
of glutamic acid was also used. Spars© utilization of alanine was 
shown. Buffered dextrose medium gave poor results. 

The same general species specific pattern is again illustrated 
in the media discussed above even though a supply of carbohydrate 
was available in addition to a supply of protein. (Pigs. 7* )• 
large differences in metabolism were noted between solely protein 
media and protein-carbohydrate media. However, slightly greater 
activity occurred in certain of the sugar media (this varied with 
different species). Buffered dextrose broth was not suitable for the 
examination of amino acid metabolism of this group of organisms. 

The relative utilization of the basic amino acids (lysine, 
arginine, and histidine) and of aspartic acid seemed to be of dif¬ 
ferential importance, for serine was utilized by almost all strains

at all times, while glutamic acid and alanine utilization varied 
considerably and did not seem to fall into a pattern. 

From Tables V to VI1 inclusive, one can gather the following in¬ 
formation: 

P* aerogenoides characteristically utilized the basic amino 
acids, and not aspartic acid while P. intermedium used only aspartic 
acid. Most strains of P. coliforme used none of these amino acids 
though occasional strains utilized aspartic. Serine was required 
by almost all species in all media. Glutamic acid, though not as 
frequently nor as consistently used within species was nevertheless 
employed by all species of Paracolobactrum. Alanine was used spar¬ 
ingly by P. aerogenoides and by P. coliforme, but not at all by P. 
intermedium. All other amino acids not mentioned in the above dis¬ 
cussion but included in the media employed were not visibly utilized. 

Amino Acid Utilization in Media Containing a Few Selected Amino Acids 

and a Varied Supply of Carbohydrate . 

Only selected amino acids were used, ^hey were chosen on the 
basis of their utilization by test organisms in the media previously 
discussed . The number of amino acids in each successive medium was 
gradually cut down until there remained only those which seemed 
most essential to support the growth of bacteria in the genus Para¬ 
colobactrum# 

Medium 1 contained 11 amino acids (refer to Table 11) and dex¬ 
trose (w/v). Medium 11 contained 7 amino acids and was divided into 
two lots: 11A containing 0.3$ dextrose (w/v), 11B containing 10$

dextrose (w/v). G rowth obtained in these media, although satis¬ 
factory, was not as -uniform among species as in lab media. In 
Medium 1 P. intermedium strains produced the greatest turbidity, 
(therefore the greatest degree of growth); ?, coliforme and P, 
aerogenoides strains slightly less. Variable turbidity was recorded in 
all cultures except a few in Medium 11. Amino acid utilization was 
not very pronounced in 24 hours but was more marked after 48 hours 
incubation. Serine was the only amino acid in Medium 111, which did 
not support the growth of many organisms tested. 

Marked metabolic selectivity by test organisms in these media 
was noted. 

P. aerogenoides . (Table Till*) Sparse utilization of basic 
amino acids was evident, (it may be noted that lysine was not 
metabolized.) Only serine was used extensively while glutamic acid 
was not visibly utilized. 

In Medium 111, containing serine alone, little utilisation could 
be demonstrated, but the medium showed poor growth and was quit© in¬ 
adequate for many strains. 

P. intermedium. (Table IX.) Complete absence of basic amino 
acid utilization was noted. A few strains metabolized aspartic 
acid while nearly all metabolized serine. lack of utilization of 
glutamic acid was again noted. ?he majority of strains grew in 
medium 111 but only half of these used serine. 

P. coliforme. (Table X.) Less selectivity was shown by this 
group, ^he basics were not metabolized at all, but neither was as¬ 
partic acid by the majority of strains. A few strains used the

latter in Medium 11 at 48 hours. A lower incidence of serine ut¬ 
ilization was noted possible due to less growth. Glutamic acid was 
slightly used. 

Only half the strains grew in Medium 111 and few of these utili¬ 
sed serine markedly. 

More selective utilization of amino acids of Paracolobactrum sp. 
became evident when only a few amino acids were available in a medium* 
but was not often readily observable before 48 hours of incubation 
even though extensive growth occurred much before this time. (Figs,8to 
11). Serine, however, was the only amino acid utilized extensively 
while the others were utilized sparsely. 

The characteristic amino acid metabolic pattern which was fol¬ 
lowed by individual species in other media was not so pronounced in 
special media. The diminished catabolic activity (with respect to 
amino acids) in the special media may have been due to th© lack of 
certain amino acids acting as growth factors, possibly in trace 
amounts. 

The Affect of Carbohydrate on Amino Acid Utilization . 

Some strains of Paracolobactrum species showed variations in 
amino acid utilization when cultured in certain sugar broths. A 
few strains of P. aerogenoides showed more extensive activity in 
dextrose medium. Aspartic acid which is not usually attacked was 
found to be utilized. P. intermedium strains exhibited a similar 
activity in sucrose and lactose broths. But in tryptophane ass ay 
medium containing 4 ^ dextrose, catabolism of amino acids was not 


as extensive as in media containing only protein, for instance

glutamic, acid and alanine were no longer utilized by intermedium 
and coliforme strains. 

Following this observation, the percentage of carbohydrate was 
varied in each batch of medium to determine the effect of carbohy¬ 
drate supply on the amino acid metabolism of paracolon bacteria. 

A M protein-sparing H effect was looked for. 

Protein-sparing is a phenomenon observed in the metabolism of 
bacteria when carbohydrate is utilized in preference to protein when 
both are available in a culture medium. The protein is said to be w spar@d w 
by the bacteria. 

P. aerogenoides . (Table Ylil) # Dextrose concentration in Medium 
11 seemed to make a slight difference in the extent of protein uti¬ 
lization, which was less in Medium 11B containing the larger per¬ 
centage of dextrose. Degree of growth was the same in both media. 

In Medium 111 protein-sparing was indicated when only 3 out of 
18 strains used serine in 111B (2$ dextrose) and 8 strains out of 
15 used serine in 111A (0.1$ dextrose). Lack of utilization of 
serine was not due to lack of growth of the culture for even when 
turbidity of culture was great only a few strains used serine. 

P. intermedium . (Table IX). Th© percentage of carbohydrate 
present in Medium 11 did not seem to affect utilization to any 
marked degree. Medium 111 supported the growth of a large percen¬ 
tage of strains tested, half of which utilized serine irrespective 
of the carbohydrate content of the medium. D emons tration of protein¬ 
sparing was therefore absent. 

P. Coliforme . (Table X. ). Controversial results were obtained. 

Though the degree of growth was the same with all strains, amino acids 
were extensively utilized in Medium 11B (10$ dextrose) and not as 
much in Medium 11A ( 0 . 3 $ dextrose).

However protein-sparing was again illustrated by a few strains in 
Medium 111. Serine was utilized by all ( 5 ) strains growing in 111A 
but only by one out of the five strains in 11 IB. Turbidity of 
cultures of strains showing growth was approximately the same. 


The percentage of carbohydrate in a medium had varying effects 
on the activity of Paracolobactrum sp. 

Increase in catabolic activity was demonstrated by many strains 
in media containing a nutrient broth base to which had been added 
dextrose, lactose, or sucrose. 

In media of specific, but partially restricted amino acid con¬ 
stitution, a greater differential effect was observed. In Mediumll 
utilization of amino acids by P. aeorgenoides varied indirectly 
with percentage of carbohydrate present, i. e. greater metabolic 
activity was observed in the presence of 0 . 2 $ dextrose then with 10 $ 
dextrose. ri ith P. coliforme, however,the amino acid utilization 
varied directly with carbohydrate concentration, i. e. greater acti« 
vity occurred in the presence of 10 $ dextrose than with 0 . 2 $ dextrose. 
P. intermedium strains were quite indifferent to carbohydrate con¬ 
centration. ft ithin species, the degree of growth of cultures ms 
the same in both media. P. intermedium cultures however, produced 
more turbidity than the other two species. 

In media of very restricted amino acid content - only serine 
present - an even more pronounced differential effect was demon¬ 
strated. Utilization of amino acids in Medium 111 by P. aerogenoi- 
des and P* coliforme varied indirectly with the percentage of

carbohydrate present. P. intermedium strains were again indifferent. 

These findings are so irregular that it is difficult to believe 
that carbohydrate acts directly as a •protein-sparer®. As the num¬ 
ber of amino acids in each medium is decreased the protein-sparing 
effect is increased with some species but not with others. Conse¬ 
quently it may be assumed that the capacity of an organism to utilize 
an amino acid in a medium of mixed protein constitution does not 
always indicate that the acting enzyme system acts specifically and 
solely on that amino acid at all times, and under all conditions, 
for the organism is mad© up of multiple enzyme systems. Various 
metabolic routes may be followed depending on conditions. Amino 
acid utilization is not necessarily increased in paracolobactrum sp. 
on the addition of an extra . Awliwj energy source such as excess 

carbohydrate. The absence of certain amino acids which act as coen¬ 
zymes may have been a factor influencing lessened amino acid utilization. 
As fewer amino acids were available in the medium fewer enzyme systems 
were activated because of the lack of suitable coenzymes. 

A difference in metabolic activity among species is evident. As 
amino acid content of medium is lessened, P. aerogenoides activity 
increasingly varies indirectly with dextrose concentration. P. coli- 
forme activity varies directly with dextrose concentration when 7 
amino acids are present, and indirectly when only one amino acid is 
present. P. intermedium activity is not altered by varied dextrose 


concentration.

Amino Acid Synthesis by Paracolobactrum sp . 

An amino acid was considered to 1)6 synthesized when it appeared 
as a definite spot in the chromatographic pattern of some bacterial 
culture filtrate and was not present in the control of medium. (Refer 
to Figs. 8 to 11.) It was not always easy however to identify such spots 
as amino acids, because other substances such as polypeptides also 
appeared on a chromatogram. The shape of the spot was often help¬ 
ful. For instance, polypeptides appeared as long, spear-headed 
streams while amino acids produced broader, wider smudges. 

Synthesis of amino acids was noted only in a few media - tryp¬ 
tophane assay and special media. Visible synthesis was not noted 
in the other media employed. 

Amino acids which appeared to be synthesized by the bacteria, 
or were breakdown products released on dissolution of dead bacteria, 
were not identified biochemically, but only their position on the 
chromatogram, and in some cases indication of identity was noted 
and recorded. Work was not extended to identify these synthesized 
acids. 

Amino acids synthesized by Paracolobactrum sp. are shown in 
Table Xll. Only a few strains in each species consistently showed 
synthesis of amino acids in the media listed. The presence of two 
amino acids, serine and glutamic acid, in the culture medium ap¬ 
peared to have some association with amino acid synthesis. Espe¬ 
cially in media 11A and IIP, as serine utilization increased (also 
glutamic acid in some cases) with increased incubation time, the

amount of amino acid in the valine methionine spot increased also. 

In all those studied, indications of the production of some new 
substance in the culture medium, were seen with any degree of fre¬ 
quency at only three positions in chromatograms, below the glutamic 
acid spot, at the lower edge of the proline spot, and in the valine 
methionine spot. The latter spot was always very intense in color 
and large in size. 

The purple spot appearing as inverted spearhead at the bottom 
of the proline position in tryptophane assay medium was interesting. 
(Fig. 12.) This was produced by 30 strains of P, aerogenoides and by 
3 strains of P. intermedium. The identity of this amino acid or poly¬ 
peptide is still unknown. Amino acids whichcould be associated with the 
production of this spot, e. i. those which were utilized by cultures 
exhibiting this synthesis were chiefly the basic amino acid group 
and serine. However, this relationship was not invariable and 
may have been misleading. 

Conclusions 

Many strains will, in the genus Parac 0 lobaetrum, synthesize 
amino acids or at least new chromatographic-ally centered substances. 
Synthesis of amino acids is not as species specific as utilization 
of amino acids. Most strains of P. aerogenoides do produce the same 
polypeptide or amino acid in tryptophane essay medium, but only in 
this medium of all the media examined. P. intermedium strains seem 
to synthesize a larger number of amino acids as a group than do the 
other species. Also they again seem to synthesize more rapidly, for 
in 24 hours in most cases, evidence of synthesis is visible.

P. coliforme group is not so active a synthesizer both in number and 
quantity of amino acids produced. 

The presence of certain amino acids in the medium in which these 
bacteria are grown seems to be connected directly or indirectly with 
the synthesis of other amino acids or polypeptides. Serine and glutamic 
acid seemed to be most important. As their utilization increased the 
amount of substance synthesized increased. There was no absolute 
ratio however, and the phenomenon was not invariable. Nevertheless 
it is difficult to believe that the finding was entirely coincidental. 

The amount and number of amino acids synthesized increased with 
an increase in incubation time. The process however, was subjected 
to considerable variation, some strains of bacteria being much 
slower than others of the same species. 

Synthesis could not be demonstrated in routine laboratory media. 
This may have been due to a masking effect by the larger number of 
amino acids present in the medium.

Amino Acid Utilization and Synthesis by P. intermedium and E. coll 

strains in Medium XIA at 24 and 48 Hours . 

At 24 hours serine is much used by most strains. A new chromatographic 
spot in the valine-methionine position is demonstrated by strains 
of both species. Note absence of such a spot in the control. 

At 48 hours both serine and glutamic acid are utilized. The inten¬ 
sity of the valine-methionine spot is greatly increased. A new 
chromatographic spot below glutamic acid has appeared with most 
strains.

The Relation Between Amino Acid Metabolism and Biochemical and 

Serological Reactions of Paracolobactnun Species. 

Amino Acid Metabolism and Biochemical Reactions * 

A comparison of experimental results indicated that a relation¬ 
ship may exist "between the amino acid metaholism and the usual "bio¬ 
chemical reactions rsensed in routine laboratory tests of Paracolo- 
hactrum sp. An obvious factor common to both liec in the production 
of indole due to the breakdown of tryptophane, Unfortoinately this 
cannot be revealed chromatographically. 

Nevertheless, an interesting relationship is very evident. 
Species classified on the basis of routine biochemical tests (Table 
Xll) also have species specific amino acid utilization (Table Xlll).

Amino Acid Metabolism and Serological Beactions 
Serological reactions of ParacoloBactrum were studied By Finlayson 
(1952). The same strains of organisms were used in Both our investigations 
which were otherviise carried out independently, But were compared to deter¬ 
mine whether a possible relationship existed Between serol.cgical reactions 
and amino acid utilization. 

The antigenic structure of an organism is thought to Be protein in 
nature, therefore protein synthesis is involved. Since amino acids are 
the Building Blocks of protein structure, their utilization By a Bacterial 
cell may influence the character of structural protein synthesized* If 
such a relationship exists, the specific antigenic structure of a Bacterial 
cell may arise from specific amino acid utilization By that cell* 

Investigation of the serology of P. aerogenoides strains showed that 
the somatic antigens of the following strains were identical: 28 and 
251 and 345, 281 and 921. Amino acid utilisation within each group of 
serologically identical strains was found to Be very similar (Table XIV),

On the "basis of somatic antigen configuration, the following 
strains were found to "be related to each other: 

1. 113, 177, 191. 267, 281, 779, 921, 924, AP113, 7427. 

2. 118, 850, 919. APIII, 5308. 

Although the amino afcid utilization of the above strains was generally 
characteristic of the species, a slight difference was noted "between 
the two groups. Strains in the first group variably used alanine while 
strains in the second group did not use it at all (Table XVI), 

Strain 295 was serologically related to strains 251 and 3^5 but 
amino acid usage differed slightly, 

A^tho^^gh the 0 antigens of strains 28 and 295 were different, 
similar H antigens and amino acid utilization were demonstrated* 

Although an interesting parallel between seroldgical reactions 
and amino acid utilisation was obtained in strains 28 - 445, 251— 3^5» 
281 - 921, the relationship was obviously a species rather than a strain 
one.

Relationship Between The Genus Paracolobactrum and Related Genera-Escherichia 

Aerobacter, and Salmonella 

The relationships between the organisms of the genus Paracolobactrum 
and those of the Escherichia, Aerobacter, and Salmonella genera is obvious 
in their morphology, staining, and colonial characters. Their fermentative 
abilities, of course, constitute the main differential feature among the 
genera, but the general pattern of resemblance is still visible (Table XV). 

It is largely on such individual “biochemical M resemblances that paracolon 
bacilli have been considered the connecting link between the conforms and 
salmonellae (Borman et al 1944, Fairbrother 1950, etc.). Similarly the 
suggestion that species of Paracolobactrum are more closely related to one 
or the other of these groups arises chiefly out of observations that bio¬ 
chemically the following species appear to be related: P. aerogenoides 
and A. aerogenes; P. coliforme and E, coli; P intermedium and Salmonella 
(Table XV).

only of E. coli, A # aerogenes, and Salmonellae. Thus the findings are 
presented merely in relation to the main problem of^thesis and do not 
necessarily have any validity in relation to the general metabolic pattern 
of the genera. 

In Table XVI amino acid utilization of such organisms is compared 
with that of the Faracolobactrum species. The same group of amino acids - 
basics, aspartic acid, serine, glutamic, and alanine _ is generally utilized 
but the relationship between species suggested by biochemical tests (espec¬ 
ially IMViC tests) is not supported. Much irregularity of utilization 
within species was shown by E. coli and Salmonellae. No definite relation¬ 
ship in amino acid utilization exists between P. aerogenoides and A. aero- 
genes, P. intermedium and Salmonella. However some does exist between 
P. coliforme and E* coli. Curiously enough, a different species relation¬ 
ship is apparent. P. aerogenoides and Salmonellae show a very similar 
pattern of utilization as do P. intermedium and A. aerogenes. 

The genera are all related to each other in that the same group of 
amino acids was metabolized by each genus*

Like Paracolobactrum sp. strains of E. coli and A. aerogenes were 
able to grow quite well in media containing a few selected amino acids 
"but their utilization of amino acids also diminished* Probably all 
require traces of other amino acids for full amino acids utilization. 
Salmonellae grew very poorly or not at all in special media. They 
seemed to he more fastidious in their growth requirements* 

It was interesting to note that all four E, coli strains produced 
the same amino acids or polypeptides as strains of Paracolobactrum sp* 
(Table XVll). The valine-methionine spot was very pronounced in Medium II 
(both A and 33) as early as 24 hours and more so at 48 hours* The chromato¬ 
graphic spot below glutamic acid, which appeared so often in Paracolobac¬ 
trum cultures, also appeared with all E. coli strains and the majority of 
A, aerogenes strains* Salmonellae did not produce either of these spots, 
but produced the spot below proline which has been described with P* aero— 
genoides. E. coli also produced this spot.

Here again species relationshp differed with respect to the pattern 
of amino acid synthesis* P* aerogenoides exhibited similar synthetic 
properties to E. coli * P, coliforme was similar to A, aerogenes, "out P. 
intermedium and Salmonellae differed between themselves and from the rest 
of the species* 

Thus Paracolobactrum sp. did not exhibit a constant relationship in 
all metabolic activity to specific species of related genera* Bather, 
species relationship varied v/ith the metabolic process involved, therefore 
species showing similar activity in amino acid synthesis differed from those 
related in amino acid utilization, and these again differed from species 
related by routine biochemical reactions. Such interrelationships further 
support the idea that paracolons are a link between coliforms and salmonellae, 
for if they are evolutionary mutations of coliforms to salmonellae (or vice 
versa) then it is quite feasable that they will possess some metabolic pro¬ 
perties of both groups as has been shown.

DISCUSSION 














DISCUSSION 


The paper partition chromatographic method of Consdon, Gordon, 
and Martin (1944) with modifications can be applied readily to the 
study of amino acid utilization and synthesis by bacterial cultures. 
Strip chromatography is a good qualitative microanalytical method of 
analyzing culture filtrates for their amino acid content. It is, 
however, not as easy to interpret as two-dimensional chromatography, 
but has the advantage of being a much quicker method. Interpretation 
has been found to become easier with experience and in this study the 
single-dimensional method has given much useful information and has 
proven adequate. 

In the majority of cases a direct relationship exists between 
the amount of growth exhibited and amount of amino acid utilized. 

Composition of media is quite important. In media including 
all the amino acids contained in beef extract or casein hydrolyzate, 
the variety as well as the amount of amino acids utilized is much 
greater generally than in media of restricted amino acid composition, 
although the visible degree of growth in cultures in all media may be 
approximately the same. It seems then that more enzyme systems invol¬ 
ving amino acid usage are active in media of unrestricted amino acid 
composition than in restricted media. Coenzymes may enter the pic¬ 
ture here. Gertain amino acids probably function as coenzymes for 
certain enzyme systems. Only one molecule may be required to activ¬ 
ate an enzyme system. If the amino acid is absent, then the enzyme 
system, although present, does not function. This may be a factor 
determining the smaller number of amino acids used in restricted media. 











v f r s 











When two available sources of energy are present - protein and 
carbohydrate - the organism may use either one or both for energy 
and structural purposes, depending on what enzyme systems are favoured 
by the prevailing conditions. *or instance, in Medium 11, both car¬ 
bohydrate and protein were actively used by enzyme systems of P. col- 
iforme strains, but under different environmental conditions in 
Medium 111 enzyme activity was restricted to carbohydrate. The irre¬ 
gularity in the demonstration of such enzyme systems certainly 
showed that factors other than the simple presence of this or that 
food nutrient were important in determining the metabolic pattern of 
an organism. 

Prom the present investigation Paracolobactrum species show a 
characteristic pattern of ajnino acid utilization. The differential 
factor between species is the selective utilization of basic amino 
acids (lysine, arginine, and histidine) and aspartic acid(Table XXII),

. ■> ■ I 

















acid, and alanine — are visibly used by Paracolobactrum sp, to 
the exclusion of a!! 1 other amino acids present 3n the media, This 
indicates that all species possess certain common active enzyme sys¬ 
tems which utilize a common group of amino acids, but each species 
possesses individual enzyme systems whose activity is specific to 
that species. It is necessary to emphasize the relative activity of 
such enzyme systems. Enzymes which are demonstrably active even in 
a poor nutritional environment are probably of intrinsic importance 
to a micro organism*and here the differences between bacterial species 
are indicated by such enzymes. In a rich environment the distinction 
is much less marked; a wider ana more uniform utilization of amino 
acids indicates the appearance in all species of numerous common enzyme 
systems. Therefore the relative activity of enzymes is of much greater 
importance in their content than their conditional presence. Of course 
it is still possible to conceive, but not to prove, that these enzymes 
may be species specific and to suggest that the similarity in amino 
acid utilization demonstrable between species in certain environments 
is due to species diverse enzymes with similar protein affinities. 

Amino acids or polypeptides were synthesized by strains of 
Paracolobactrum sp. Synthesis was not species specific generally, 
but a pattern is shown by each species (Table XXIII),

Amino acid or polypeptide synthesis is detected "best in media 
of restricted amino acid composition, hut to some degree also in 
tryptophane assay medium. In such media the product produced is 
not ma^ed hy the presence of many chromatographic spots, hut it 
may well he that the deficiency in the medium determines the vis¬ 
ible persistance of new materials. These substances way have been 
oroduced in unrestricted media, hut there they could he hound or 
combined with other amino acids and thus not he visible chromatogr- 
aphically. In the absence of such combining material, the new 
substance produced hy the organism remains unutilized and can he 
detected in culture filtrate by chromatographic procedures. 

Species defined hy Borman et all (1944) on the basis of bio¬ 
chemical tests could still he distinguished on the basis of amino 
acid utilization, and to some degree in amino acid synthesis. 
Although each species possesses multiple enzyme systems which are 
similar in overall activity, yet individual and species specific 
enzymes can he demonstrated under appropriate conditions. 

No relationship between protein metabolism and antigenic struc¬ 
ture of individual bacteria could be demonstrated. Therefore it can

"be stated that chromatographic evidence of amino acid utilization 
does not necessarily have any direct hearing on such antigenic 
structure. 

The summation of evidence derived from the usual "biochemical 
tests and from the newer information on amino acid utilization 
and synthesis supports strongly the identity of the Paracolobac- 
trum genus created hy Borman et al (1944). The position of the 
genus in the Family Enterohacteriaceae is also revealed in the 
same evidence. From every view-point it shows a relationship to the 
genera Escherichia, Aerohacter, and Salmonella, the suggestion 
that the paracolons are the connecting link between coliforms and 
salmonellae seems well founded* The species relationship, how¬ 
ever, between Paracolobactrum and the other genera is not so clear¬ 
ly defined; individual associations exhibited in "biochemical 11 
behaviour, in protein utilization, and in bacterial synthesis are 
quite irregular. The evidence presented in this thesis indicates 
that all these genera possess enzyme systems similar in overall 
metabolic activity, but with some degree of species specificity. 

An irregular degree of species specificity is also evident within 
the genus Paracolobactrum, but the relationship of such enzymes 
to these bacterial species outside the genus has not been deter¬ 


mined,

CONCLUSIONS

CONCLUSIONS 


1. Paper partition chromatography is a useful tool to study the amino 
acid constitution of "bacterial culture filtrates. 

2. Amino acid utilization is best studied in routine laboratory 
media, i.e. peptone water, nutrient broth, and the sugar broths - 
lactose, dextrose, sucrose, and mannite. Tryptophane assay medium 
(Difco) is useful for the detection of amino acid utilization and 
some synthesis. Restricted media containing a few selected amino 
acids and varying percentages of carbohydrate are most useful in 
the study of the synthetic properties of Paracolobactrum species. 

3. Amino acid utilization, determined chromatographically, varies 
quantitatively in the following descending order: serine, 
glutamic acid, aspartic acid, basic amino acids (arginine, his¬ 
tidine, lysine), and alanine (Chart page $3). 

h. Each species of Paracolobactrum has a specific pattern of amino 
acid utilization. 

5* This differentiation among species is based on selective use of 
the basic group of amino acids and aspartic acid, suggesting the 
presence of species specific enzyme systems. 

6. Such enzyme systems vary in their activity in different media, 
and may not function so well in the presence of large amounts of 
carbohydrate when coenzyme starters (amino acids ?) are absent.

7. Paracolobactrum species also synthesize amino acids or poly¬ 


peptides, but not in such a set or regular pattern. 

8. Biochemically differentiated species are also differentiated by 
their amino acid utilization and somewhat by their amino acid or 
polypeptide synthesis. 

9. Strains of P. aerogenoides differentiated antigenica.lly are not 
correspondingly differentiated by their amino acid metabolism. 

10. Biochemical reactions and protein metabolism of Paracolobactrum 
species and of species of Escherichia, Aerobacter, and Salmonella 
reveal a complicated interrelationship of their enzyme systems. 
This indicates a close relationship between these genera in which 
Paracolobactrum seem to occupy an intermediate position.
