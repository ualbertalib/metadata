THE ABSORPTION AND TRANSLOCATION OE NUTRIENTS BY 


THE WHEAT PLANT 


THE NUTRITION OE REWARD AND RED BOBS GROIN ON THE 
BLACK AND GRAY SOILS OE ALBERTA IN RELATION 
TO WHEAT QUALITY 


Edwin Kenneth Woodford 


GENERAL INTRODUCTION 


The black and gray soils of Alberta are very 
different in their chemical composition and in their 
ability to produce crops of high yield and quality (39). 
Larger yields of both grain and forage crops are always 
obtained from the black soil, but the differences in the 
composition of these crops and those grown on the gray 
soil cannot be explained by the known differences in 
soil composition. 

Experiments (1) with many varieties of wheat 
have shown that there are marked differences in the 
composition and quality of the grain grown on the two 
soils. Wheat grown on the gray soil is inferior in 
quality to the same variety grown on the black soil, 
and in addition the flour milled from many of the

varieties deteriorates rapidly on storage and is unfit 
for commercial bread making purposes after one year. 

The flour from the same varieties grown on the black 
soil, however, can be stored for two years without any 
marked deterioration of the baking quality. 

The results reported in this paper are studies 
of the nutrition of two representative wheat varieties 
grown at Edmonton in the black and Fallis in the gray 
soil areas. It was thought that there might be some 
definite differences in the absorption and translocation 
of nutrients which could possibly be related to the very 
marked differences obtained in the original quality and 
keeping properties of the flour milled from these two 
wheats grown on the two soils. 

The paper is divided into three parts. The 
first part, which is the most comprehensive and is the 
basis for further investigations, is a study of the 
general absorption of nutrients by Reward and Red Bobs 
grown on the black and gray soils. The second part is 
a study of nitrogen, phosphorus and phosphorus fractions 
in the developing grain of the same two varieties grown 
under the same conditions. The third part is a study 
of the relationship between nitrate and phosphate 
absorption by means of nutrient culture solutions.

PART I 


The Absorption of Nutrients by Reward and Red Bobs 
Grown at Edmonton and Fallis in Relation 
to Wheat Quality 


Introduction 


It has been demonstrated by many workers that 
wheat quality is directly affected by the nutrition of the 
whole plant, and it seems that only by combining the 
studies of the plant physiologist with those of the cereal 
chemist will it be possible to solve many of the problems 
underlying wheat quality. A thorough understanding of the 
amounts and distribution of the principal nutrients in the 
wheat plant appeared to be an essential preliminary to the 
study of the detailed physiological processes which might 
be responsible for the differences in quality and keeping 
properties of the flour. It was decided, therefore, to 
study the absorption and distribution of nutrients in two 
representative varieties of wheat grown on the black and 
gray soils at Edmonton and Fallis. 

The progressive changes in the chemical compo¬ 
sition of the developing wheat plant have been followed by 
many workers, and results from various parts of the world 
are available. The work of Knowles and Watkins (13) in

England is the most comprehensive of recent years. The 
primary object of all these experiments has been to follow 
the development of the wheat plant and not to study any 
changes in composition that might result from soil and 
varietal differences. Recent work reported from French 
experimental stations (6,18,19,30) on the chemical composi¬ 
tion of different varieties grown on different soils has 
shown the magnitude of some of the changes which may be 
expected. These studies have, however, been made at only 
one or two stages in the plant 1 s development, and as far as 
the writer is aware there is no comprehensive work covering 
this question over the whole life period of the wheat plant. 

The particular varieties used in this study were 
chosen because they exhibited differences not only in 
original quality, but also in keeping properties of the 
flours milled from them. The experiment was designed so 
that the significance of the differences in varietal and 
soil reaction might be determined by accepted statistical 
methods. The question of quality is only briefly mentioned 
because the gap between the results of this study and those 
of actual quality determinations is still wide. 

Experimental Material 


The material used in this study was grown on 
fallowed land during the spring and summer of 1934. The 
experimental plots maintained at Edmonton are typical of

the black, and those at Eallis, of the gray, soil areas. 
Edmonton and Fallis are 50 miles apart, but are character¬ 
ized by similar climatic conditions. The rainfall is 
probably slightly higher at Fallis, but no meteorological 
data are available. Since the growing of legumes on the 
gray soil has been shown to affect the yield and composition 
of subsequent crops, soil which had never grown legumes was 
selected for this experiment. 

The composition of the two soil types is described 
by Wyatt and Hewton (39) who state that the greatest 
differences occur in the first foot, where the black soil 
contains about four times as much nitrogen and more than 
twice as much phosphorus as the gray soil. There are like¬ 
wise greater quantities of nitrogen, phosphorus, calcium and 
magnesium in the second and third foot depths of the black 
soil than in the corresponding depths of the gray soil. 

Two varieties of wheat, Reward and Red Bobs, were 
grown. Reward was chosen because when grown on the gray 
soil it had the highest quality of all varieties previously 
tested, and in addition was the only standard variety 
commonly grown in this area which produced flour which did 
not deteriorate rapidly on storage. Red Bobs when grown on 
the gray soil had a marked tendency to produce starchy 
kernels and yielded a flour with somewhat poorer original 
quality and decidedly poorer keeping properties. These two 
varieties are, according to grading standards, equal in 
quality to Marquis and are eligible for all standard wheat 
grades.

The experiment was planned to facilitate the 
statistical analysis of the data. Bach variety was repli¬ 
cated eight times on each soil. The varieties were grown 
side by side in blocks 18 feet long and 12 rows wide. The 
rows were one foot apart and each variety occupied a sub¬ 
block six rows wide. The position of the variety in each 
block was determined at random. Blocks were adjacent to 
each other and the whole plot was surrounded by three guard 
rows. 

The plots were sampled five times. Bach sample 
from a sub-block represented the entire length of the 
block except for a nine inch section at each end which was 
discarded to remove border effect. The collections were 
made by a "staircase” method of sampling (Fig. 1). A six 
inch sample was taken from each row and 27 inches were left 
between the samples in adjacent rows. The rows in each 
sub-block and each six inch section in a row were numbered. 
The starting row and the position of the sample in that row 
were randomized by the use of Tippet 1 s (33) random sampling 
numbers. Randomization for all the collections was made at 
the same time and if overlapping occurred, the starting 
point in the row was moved so that two samples were never 
taken from adjacent six inch sections. In this way 
adjacent samples were nover closer than six inches. 

Bdmonton plants were cut at the ground level and 
immediately transferred to the laboratory for chemical 
analyses. Fallis plants were dug from the soil and all the

plants from a sub-block transferred to an individual con¬ 
tainer. In this manner the plants, with roots well covered 
with soil, were prevented from drying out while they were 
transported to the laboratory where the tops were cut off 
just above the ground level immediately prior to analysis. 

Comparable collections were made when the plants 
were at approximately the same stage of development. Five 
samplings were made as indicated below.

Collection 3 was made when the plants were 
fully headed, Collection 4 when the grain contained about 
45% moisture and Collection 5 at maturity. The heads and 
straw and grain and straw of Collections 4 and 5, 
respectively, were analysed separately. 


Methods of Analysis 


The following determinations were made on each 
of the eight replicates of each variety grown at Edmonton 
and Fallis. 

Dry Matter : - The smaller samples of Collections 
1 and 2 were dried directly in a 100°C. air oven. The

larger samples of the later collections were rapidly dried 
in a blast oven at 75°C., then ground in a Wiley mill and 
further dried at 100°G. 

Total Nitrogen : - Total nitrogen in the vegeta¬ 
tive parts was determined by the reduced iron method of 
Pulcher et al (26) in order to include any nitrate nitrogen 
which was present. Since it has been shown that nitrate 
nitrogen if present at all in the grain is negligible, the 
Kjeldahl method with mercuric oxide as a catalyst was used 
to determine nitrogen in the grain. 

Non-protein Nitrogen : - The fresh green material, 
ground as finely as possible in a food chopper, was 
extracted with 2*5$ trichloracetic acid, and the total 
nitrogen of this extract determined by the reduced iron 
method. The procedure was essentially that used by McCalla 
( 20 ). 

Ash : - Approximately 2 gnu samples of the ground 
straw and 5 gm. samples of the grain were ashed in a muffle 
furnace at 650°C. for six hours. The ash was taken up in 
hot dilute hydrochloric acid and the solution diluted to 
100 cc. Aliquots of this solution were used in the 
determination of all the mineral elements studied except 
sulphur. 

Phosphorus : - Phosphorus was determined using 
the colorimetric method described by Truog and Meyer (34) 
and is reported as P g 0 5 . 

Sulphur : - Total sulphur was determined only on 
a composite sample of each variety at each place.

Approximately 1.5 gm. of the straw and 0.75 gm. of the 
grain were fused in a Parr heat ignition bomb with 13 gm. 
of sodium peroxide and 0.5 gm. of zinc. The fused mass 
was dissolved in hot v/ater, made slightly acid, and then 
filtered. The sulphate was precipitated as barium sulphate 
and weighed directly. The procedure was an adaptation of 
the method described by Wolkoff (55). Total sulphur is 
reported as SO^. 

Potassium : - Potassium was precipitated with 
sodium cobaltic nitrite and the precipitate titrated with 
N/30 potassium permanganate. The details of the procedure 
are described by Hibbard and Stout (13). 

Calcium : - Calcium was precipitated as the 
oxalate and titrated with H/30 potassium permanganate. 

Magnesium : - Magnesium in the filtrate from the 
calcium determination was precipitated as magnesium 
ammonium phosphate, dissolved in N/14 sulphuric acid and 
the excess titrated with N/14 sodium hydroxide using 
methyl red as an indicator. 

Results 


The results of the chemical analyses of the 
developing plants are expressed, first, as the total weight 
of the individual nutrients absorbed up to the time of each 
collection; second, as a percentage of dry matter; and 
third, as a percentage of total ash. The individual

results for each sub-block were too numerous for presenta¬ 
tion* The total weights and the mean percentages are 
presented in graphical form and also in tables with 
accompanying "t” values which indicate the significance of 
the differences due to soil and variety. 

The test for significance employed throughout is 
that of "Student" as described by Fisher (8). The experi¬ 
ment provided eight replicate determinations for each 
variety at each place. These are taken as providing eight 
replicate determinations of the differences between Reward 
and Red Bobs at Edmonton and Fallis. The average of the 
eight individual differences provided an estimate of the 
mean difference and their variance the basis of testing 
(a) whether the mean difference at either place differed 
significantly from zero (i.e. whether there was any real 
difference between the varieties) and (b) whether the 
differences between the varieties were the same at Edmonton 
and Fallis. In a similar manner by the use of totals 
instead of differences it was determined whether the 
general level of the various constituents was significantly 
higher at either Edmonton or Fallis. 

These three sets of calculations were made for 
most of the data and the computed "t” values are listed in 
Tables I, II, III, IV and VII, together with the total 
weights or means of the various determinations. The first 
column of f, t” values indicates the significance of the 
difference in the general level at Edmonton and Fallis. 

The value for the Fallis sample was always subtracted from

the value for the Edmonton sample, and in consequence a 
negative sign means that the general level was higher at 
Fallis. The second and third columns of ”t M values indicate 
the significance of the differences between varieties at 
Edmonton and Fallis, a negative sign meaning that the weight 
or percentage was higher in Bed Bobs than in Reward. The 
fourth column of M t ,f values shows the significance of the 
difference between the varietal reactions, a high w t w value 
indicating that the differences between the varieties were 
not the same at Edmonton as at Fallis. 

Total Weights . 

The total weights of dry matter, nitrogen, ash 
and ash constituents are shown in Fig. 2. In the graphs 
each point, except for sulphur, represents the total of 
eight replicate samples. The numerical values for these 
results, together with "t* values indicating the signifi¬ 
cance of the differences due to soil and variety, are shown 
in Table I. Sulphur was determined only on a composite 
sample from each collection; thus it was impossible to use 
these data for statistical analysis. 

The quantities represented indicate the absorp¬ 
tion of the various nutrients from a definite area of 
soil (48 six inch sections) and a comparison of the curves 
indicates the fertility of the two soils and the ability 
of the two varieties to grow on them.

The figures show that at every collection the 
weights of dry matter and all other constituents determined 
were higher for Edmonton than for Fallis samples. The 
magnitude of these differences for all constituents, except 
potassium and sulphur, increased with the age of the plant. 
These elements were excreted from the plants and the 
greatest differences in weights occurred before excretion 
had started, at Collection Z for potassium and Collection 4 
for sulphur. At the point of the maximum difference the 
quantities of nitrogen, ash, sulphur, potassium and calcium 
in the Edmonton plants were approximately four times as 
high as in the Fallis plants. Phosphorus was exceptional; 
the differences between Edmonton and Fallis samples were 
much smaller throughout the growth period and were insig¬ 
nificant in Collection E. This proportionately greater 
absorption of phosphorus cannot be attributed to the amount 
of phosphorus in the gray soil which is only 60% of that 
present in black soil. Nor can it be attributed to the 
greater amount of phosphorus in relation to the other 
elements. In relation to calcium and magnesium, phosphorus 

Uv 

is less in the gray soil than, the black. 

The differences between varieties were significant 
(6% point) for only one determination in the Fallis samples, 
but for more than one-third of the determinations in the 
Edmonton samples. Thus the results show that Red Bobs 
absorbed more nutrients than Reward at Edmonton and less at 
Fallis, but that this difference was significant for less 
than one-third of the determinations.

Percentage Data . 

Dry Matter as a Percentage of Green Weight : - The 
percentages of dry matter in the fresh samples of the first 
four collections are shown in the top left hand graph of 
Fig. 3. The numerical values of these results, together 
with w t w values indicating the significance of the 
differences due to soil and variety, are shown in Table II. 
Collection 5 is not considered as it was made after the 
plants were mature. 

Fallis samples were definitely higher in dry 
matter content than corresponding Edmonton samples. 

Red Bobs was higher than Reward in percentage of 
dry matter for both Edmonton and Fallis plants, and this 
difference was significant in all but Collections 2 and 3 
at Edmonton. 

Dry matter content is often used as an indication 
of the stage of maturity of the plant. The percentage of 
dry matter was higher in the Fallis than in the Edmonton 
plants, and indicated that the Fallis samples were more 
mature than the Edmonton samples. The individual collections 
were therefore not strictly comparable, and it might have 
been better to have plotted all other data against the 
percentage of dry matter, rather than against the number 
of days from seeding. This would not, however, have 
altered the general appearance of the graphs nor any con¬ 
clusions drawn from them. In this regard it is pointed out 
that Red Bobs is a later maturing variety on both soils,

but that it was in every instance higher in the percentage 
of dry matter than Reward. Thus, in this experiment, the 
percentage of dry matter in the whole plant did not 
indicate the stage of the varieties’ development, and its 
use as the abscissa would have been no more justified than 
that of the number of days from seeding. 

Nitrogen. Ash and Ash Constituents as a Percentage 
of Dry Matter : - The average values for nitrogen, ash and 
ash constituents expressed as percentages of dry matter 
are presented graphically in Fig. 3 and numerically in 
Table II together with "t" values indicating the sig¬ 
nificance of the differences due to soil and variety. 

The general shape of the curves for all con¬ 
stituents in both Edmonton and Fallis samples is similar. 

The general level of all constituents except phosphorus, 
was higher in the Edmonton than in the Fallis samples, and 
was significant in every instance except the percentage of 
ash in Collection 5. The sulphur results were not analysed 
statistically, but the graph shows greater differences 
between the general levels of this element in the Edmonton 
and Fallis samples than for any other constituent. 

The results show that in general the percentage 
of the constituents in Reward was higher than in Red Bobs 
for the samples from both soils. This difference was 
significant in over 50$ of the cases and in only one 
instance, phosphorus in Collection 1 at Fallis, was Red Bobs 
significantly higher than Reward. The statistical analyses

also show that this difference between Reward and Red Bobs 
was in general greater at Fallis than at Edmonton. This 
was not so with the nitrogen results which were significantly 
higher in all collections of Reward samples at Edmonton, 
while at Fallis they were significantly higher only in 
Collections 2 and 5. Thus the difference in the percentage 
of nitrogen in Reward and Red Bobs was greater at Edmonton, 
while for all other constituents the difference between 
varieties was predominantly greater at Fallis. The 
percentage of nitrogen and sulphur in the Fallis samples 
fell very rapidly between Collections 1 and 3. The total 
weight results (Fig. 2) show that during the first month 
the Fallis plants absorbed approximately 37$ of their total 
nitrogen and 28$ of their total sulphur, while the corres¬ 
ponding figures for Edmonton plants were 19$ for nitrogen 
and 12$ for sulphur. This indicates that nitrogen and 
sulphur were readily available throughout the plants* 
groY/th at Edmonton, while at Fallis they were readily 
available only in the early stages and then became limiting. 
Phosphorus was definitely higher in the Fallis plants, and 
the percentage of the total uptake of this element absorbed 
during the first month of growth was 17$ at Fallis as com¬ 
pared to 16$ at Edmonton, indicating that phosphorus was 
equally available to the Fallis and the Edmonton plants. 

Various workers (11,14,15,25) have shown that 
there is a reciprocal relationship between the amounts of 
nitrogen and phosphorus absorbed by the plants and between

the percentages of these elements occurring within the 
plant. Low nitrogen supply, together with available 
phosphorus, may then be responsible for the definitely 
higher concentrations of phosphorus in the Fallis plants. 

The importance of sulphur in this connection must 
also be noted. Marsh (16) showed that a reciprocal 
relationship also exists between sulphur and phosphorus in 
the tomato plant. The high concentration of phosphorus in 
Fallis samples may be due partly to the effect of low 
nitrogen and partly to the effect of low sulphur. 

Ash Constituents as a Percentage of Total Ash . 

The average values for phosphorus, sulphur, potassium and 
calcium expressed as percentages of ash are presented 
graphically (Fig. 4). Table III gives the numerical values 
for these results, together with accompanying f, t” values 
which indicate the significance of differences due to soil 
and variety. 

Unlike the previous results the graphs for the 
individual constituents are not similar. Phosphorus as a 
percentage of the ash remained fairly constant in the 
samples ^er each soil but was almost twice as high in the 
Fallis samples. The percentage of sulphur in the Edmonton 
plants rose to a maximum at the time of Collection 4 and 
then fell as excretion of this element from the vegetative 
parts of the plant commenced (Fig. 2). The condition in 
the Fallis samples was very different. The percentage of 
sulphur decreased until Collection 2 and then remained

fairly constant. The difference between these two sets 
of curves is striking, and is further evidence that the 
amount of sulphur in the Fallis soils limited the plant 
growth. The potassium content was almost identical for 
both varieties and soils; it rose to a maximum at the time 
of Collection 3 and then fell rapidly as excretion of this 
element began. The calcium curves are somewhat similar 
for the samples from both soils. In the Fallis plants 
there was a more rapid decrease in the percentage of 
calcium which was followed, at the time of the last collec¬ 
tion, by a definite increase not apparent in the Edmonton 
plants. It is shown in a later section of this paper 
that this increase was definitely reflected in the compo¬ 
sition of the grain. 

The results in Table III show that the percentage 
of phosphorus in the ash was definitely higher in Fallis 
samples at all stages, that calcium was higher for the 
last four collections at Edmonton, and that potassium was 
higher for Collection 1 at Fallis but almost the same for 
all others. 

There were no consistent significant differences 
between the varieties when grown on the same soil, although 
the results indicate that the ash percentage of Red Bobs 
was higher in sulphur and calcium than that of Reward for 
both Edmonton and Fallis samples. Likewise there were 
no consistent significant differences between the 
reactions of the varieties to the two soils.

TIME FROM SEEDING. DAYS. 


Fig. 5 


Total weights of protein and non-protein 
nitrogen in the vegetative parts of Reward 
and Red Bobs from a unit area of soil. 














Nitrogen Fractions . 

Total nitrogen was separated into protein and 
organic non-protein fractions. Nitrate nitrogen was 
also determined in Collection 1, but this fraction was 
less than 1% of the total nitrogen and is not considered. 

The total weights of protein and non-protein 
nitrogen in the vegetative parts of all collections of 
Edmonton and Fallis plants are represented graphically in 
Fig. 5. Although the total weights in Edmonton samples 
were nearly five times those of Fallis samples, the 
relative changes in the amounts of total protein and non¬ 
protein nitrogen were in general the same at both places. 
The weights of both fractions rose to a maximum at the 
time of Collection 3, when heading was almost complete, 
and then fell until maturity.

total nitrogen in the vegetative parts.

Non-protein as a percentage of the total nitrogen 
in the vegetative parts is shown in Fig. 6. At the time 
of Collections 2 and 3 this fraction was much the same for 
both Edmonton and Fallis samples. When translocation of 
nitrogen to the grain began, a relatively larger proportion 
of the nitrogen in the vegetative parts of the Edmonton 
plants was non-protein. If the results of water culture 
experiments (20) are applicable to studies carried out 
in the field, this higher proportion of non-protein 
nitrogen was the result of a higher absorption of nitrogen 
during the later stages of growth. The total weight 
results (Fig. 1) show that the absorption of nitrogen by 
the Edmonton plants after Collection 3 was on the average 
8 gm. as compared with an average of 3 gm. for the Fallis 
plants. These results may be taken as additional evidence 
that nitrogen was limiting general development and 
metabolism under Fallis conditions. 

Equivalent Uptake of Anions and Cations . 

The results so far discussed lead to the general 
conclusion that phosphorus is relatively more available 
than nitrogen and sulphur in the Fallis soil. The 
importance of this relationship in altering the composition 
of the plant is shown in Fig. 7, where the ratios of 
nitrogen:phosphorus and sulphur:phosphorus in the plants 
at the various collections are plotted. The ratios are 
calculated from the equivalent ?*eights of the elements,

and the graphs show that both of these ratios were 
definitely higher at all times in the Edmonton plants. 

This was to he expected if nitrogen and sulphur were limit¬ 
ing at Fallis while phosphorus was readily available. 



Fig, 7. Ratios of the equivalent uptake of nitrogen 
and phosphorus, sulphur and phosphorus and 
total anions:cations in Reward and Red Bobs 
at progressive stages of maturity. 


It has already been suggested that the Fallis 
plants absorbed large amounts of phosphorus to compensate 
for the low availability of nitrogen and sulphur. If this 
reciprocal nature of the anions, nitrogen, sulphur and 
phosphorus did in some way tend to control the total amount 
of anions absorbed, then there should be a fairly constant 
relationship between the principal anions and cations 
absorbed from each soil. This anion:cation ratio was 
calculated in terms of equivalents for the two varieties 
for all collections and is also shown graphically in Fig. 7.

The curves show that the ratio was highest in the early 
stages of the plants* growth, fell gradually until Collec¬ 
tion 3 and then, due to the excretion of potassium, 
increased until the plants were mature. The curves for 
both varieties and soils are similar and substantiate the 
hypothesis that there is a controlling influence which 
regulates the proportion of anions to cations absorbed 
despite the limiting supply of two of the anions. The 
high phosphorus content in the Fallis plants was probably 
not due to the greater availability of phosphorus at Fallis 
but rather to the influence controlling the anion:cation 
balance. 

Percentage Rate of Uptake of Plant Nutrients . 

Besides the differences in total amounts of 
nutrients absorbed from the two soils there was a marked 
difference in the rates of nutrient uptake betv/een collec¬ 
tions. It has already been noted that the amounts of 
nitrogen and sulphur absorbed during the first month of 
growth was proportionately much greater at Fallis. To 
illustrate this difference in the rate of uptake the average 
percentage absorption between collections was calculated. 

The weight of an element absorbed between successive 
collections was divided by the number of days between the 
collections, and this value expressed as a percentage of 
the total amount of the element absorbed. These percentages

for nitrogen, phosphorus, sulphur and potassium in Reward 
grown on both soils are plotted against days from seeding 
in Fig. 8. The data of this experiment are somewhat 
inadequate for this type of calculation, but the general 
shape of the curves clearly demonstrates the point in 
question. 




TIME FROM SEEDING. DAYS. 


Fig. 8. The percentage rate of uptake of nutrients 

by Reward at progressive stages of maturity. 

The graphs show that the rate of nitrogen absorp¬ 
tion at Edmonton increased until Collection 3, while at 
Fallis the rate decreased from Collection 1 to Collection 
4. The graph for sulphur shows a somewhat similar relation¬ 
ship between the percentage rates at the two places. The 
phosphorus and potassium curves are more nearly alike for 
Edmonton and Fallis plants. The rise and fall in the 
percentage rate of absorption of potassium was very

similar for the two places, while the only marked difference 
in the percentage rate of absorption of phosphorus was 
between Collections 2 and 3. The percentage rate of 
absorption of each of the four elements reached a maximum 
between Collections 2 and 3 at Edmonton, but at FalHs 
this rate of absorption for nitrogen and sulphur was at a 
maximum before Collection 1. The lower percentage rate of 
absorption of nitrogen and sulphur by Fallis plants can 
only be attributed to the low availability of these two 
elements in the gray soil. 

Composition of Straw and Grain at Maturity 


Total freights . 

The total weights of dry matter, nitrogen, ash 
and ash constituents in grain and straw of mature plants 
are shown as bar diagrams in Fig. 9. These weights are 
also recorded in Table IY, together with the n t w values 
indicating the significance of the differences due to soil 
and variety. 

The figures show clearly the differences in the 
amount of nutrients absorbed at the two places and the 
manner of their distribution between straw and grain. The 
weights of all constituents were definitely higher in the 
Edmonton plants. There was, however, no significant differ¬ 
ence between the weights of phosphorus in the straw and 
calcium in the grain. Differences between varieties are

significant in only two instances; at Edmonton magnesium 
was higher, while at Fallis phosphorus was higher, in the 
straw of Reward plants. 

The percentages of nutrients translocated to the 
grain are shown in Table Y. There was a much greater 
percentage translocation of nitrogen, phosphorus and 
magnesium than any of the other constituents. The per¬ 
centage of all nutrients translocated to the grain of 
Edmonton plants was approximately the same for Reward as 
for Red Bobs. At Fallis the tendency was for Red Bobs to 

IxrUJU 

produce more grain in comparison to- total plant than Reward, 
and there was a correspondingly greater translocation of 
all nutrients except phosphorus.

definitely higher in the Edmonton grain while all other 
constituents were in general higher in the Fallis samples. 
The difference between varieties was only apparent in the 
weights of nitrogen which were consistently higher in the 
Reward samples from both soils. 

The outstanding differences in the composition of 
the various grain samples are shown in the lower section of 
Table VI, where the weight of each of the other nutrients 
is compared with nitrogen expressed as 100. Fallis grain 
had a much higher proportion of ash and ash constituents 
to nitrogen, than Edmonton grain. Red Bobs had a much 
higher proportion of total ash, and a slightly higher pro¬ 
portion of potassium and phosphorus, to nitrogen than did 
Reward. 

Percentage Data . 

Nitrogen, Ash and Ash Constituents as a Percentage 
of Dry Matter . Nitrogen ash and ash constituents of the 
final collection expressed as percentages of the dry matter 
are shown in Table VII, together with accompanying "t ft 
values which indicate the significance of differences due 
to soil and variety. 

In accord with previous results on the compo¬ 
sition of the whole plant, the percentages of nitrogen and 
all ash constituents except phosphorus were higher in the 
straw of Edmonton samples. This condition was, however, 
reversed in the grain where all the constituents, except

nitrogen, were definitely higher in the Fallis samples• 
Calcium, potassium and phosphorus, in particular, were 
much higher due to the greater translocation of calcium 
and potassium to the grain in the Fallis samples (Table V) 
and the consistently higher amounts of phosphorus at all 
times present in the Fallis plants. 

Varietal differences were definite. The percent¬ 
age of ash constituents was higher in Reward despite the 
greater translocation of nutrients to the grain by Red 
Bobs. The varietal differences were on the whole more 
definite in the composition of the straw. This was 
particularly so at Fallis where the percentage of every 
constituent determined, except magnesium, was significantly 
higher in Reward samples. 

The differences between the varietal reactions 
at Edmonton and Fallis showed that the percentage of 
nutrients in Reward was higher on both soils, but that 
this difference between the varieties was often greater 
at Fallis. Nitrogen in the grain was exceptional, the 
difference between the two varieties being significantly 
higher at Edmonton. 

Ash Constituents as a Percentage of Total Ash . 
Phosphorus, potassium, calcium and magnesium expressed as 
percentages of the total ash in the final collection are 
shown in Table VII, together with accompanying "t n values 
which indicate the significance of the differences due 
to soil and variety.

In spite of the significant differences in ash 
expressed as a percentage of dry matter, these results 
show the same relation between soils as did the previous 
results expressed on a dry matter basis. The differences 
between varieties were, however, no longer significant and 
indicated that the composition of the ash was not altered 
as much as the composition of the dry matter. 

The results show that the soil greatly influenced 
the composition of the grain and straw of the final collec¬ 
tion. The percentage of nutrients translocated to the grain 
was so much greater at Fallis that the composition of the 
grain became richer and the composition of the straw poorer 
than at Edmonton. Phosphorus, however, was higher in both 
grain and straw of the Fallis samples. Translocation to 
the grain tends to be so regulated that under very diverse 
nutritional conditions the composition of the grain will 
be much more nearly uniform than that of the straw. The 
composition of the mature straw varied greatly and the 
effect of soil or variety in altering the composition was 
much more definite in the straw than in the whole plant. 

Quality of Grain . 

The quality of the wheats grown in this experiment 
was determined by the usual experimental baking procedure. 
During 1932 and 1933 Reward and Red Bobs were grown under 
conditions similar to those of this experiment, and in 
Table VIII the quality of the wheats for the three years 
is compared by means of protein and loaf volume results.

The differences in loaf volume results show, as 
has previously been indicated, that Reward was in general 
higher in quality than Red Bobs at both Edmonton and 
Fallis. This original quality of the wheats is very 
closely related to protein content, and both loaf volume 
and protein results show that this relationship between 
the varieties was with one exception the same for all three 
years. There was, however, a considerable fluctuation in 
the results from year to year. The 1934 loaf volume 
results are particularly low in comparison with the 1932 
and 1933 results. This can be attributed in part to the 
climatic conditions of the year, since nearly all wheat 
grown in central and northern Alberta was of comparatively 
low quality in 1934, and in part to the effect of a frost 
on August 22. The frost occurred when the percentage of 
dry matter in the grain was approximately 58$. Newton and 
McCalla (14) concluded that when the grain contained 58$

dry matter it had reached a critical stage of development 
after which little or no translocation of nutrients took 
place. Thus it is assumed that in this experiment trans¬ 
location to the grain was not affected, although the 
baking quality of the flour, as indicated by loaf volume 
results, may have been slightly lowered. 

Discussion 


The results of the chemical analyses of the 
developing plants have been expressed in a number of 
different ways in order that as many differences as 
possible between varietal and soil reactions might be 
emphasised. It is unfortunate that the individual total 
weight results were not more accurate but the stands of 
wheat, particularly at Fallis, were not uniform, and the 
samples from each sub-block often varied greatly even 
though the total weights per collection, representing 48 
six-inch sections, undoubtedly were fairly accurate. 

Larger samples could not be used because of the difficulty 
in handling in the laboratory. The method of sampling 
would have been improved by collecting a definite number 
of plants and then determining the comparative yields of 
the varieties on the two soils by counting the number of 
plants per unit length of row.

The effect of the soil in altering growth and 
composition of the developing plants is definite. The 
general fertility and ability of the black (Edmonton) in 
comparison with the gray (Fallis) soil to produce a crop 
is clearly illustrated in the total weight results. This 
difference in yield was reflected in the composition of the 
plants, Edmonton samples having a definitely higher amount 
of all nutrients except phosphorus. This difference in 
phosphorus is interesting because when expressed as a 
percentage of dry matter or ash it was significantly 
higher in Eallis plants at all stages of maturity. Soil 
analyses show that this high phosphorus was not due to 
the total amount of this element in the gray soil which 
is less than that present in the black soil. 

Fertilizer experiments (22,39) have shown that 
nitrogen and sulphur are limiting in the Fallis soil and 
the results presented in this paper in every case substan¬ 
tiate these findings. The shape of the total weight curves 
for nitrogen and sulphur, the ratios of equivalent uptake 
of nitrogen, sulphur and phosphorus, the percentage rate 
of uptake of nitrogen and sulphur and the low percentage 
of nitrogen in Fallis samples, all indicate that nitrogen 
and sulphur were limiting growth at Fallis very early in 
the development of the plant. In addition it was shown 
that the anion:cation ratio was approximately the same 
for plants grown on both soils. It is suggested therefore

that there is a controlling influence which maintains a 
fairly constant anion:cation ratio under different 
nutritional conditions, and that when two of the important 
anions, nitrogen and sulphur, are limiting, the anion: 
cation ratio will he maintained at approximately the 
normal level by a greater absorption of phosphorus. In 
the Fallis plants this greater absorption of phosphorus 
was at first sufficient to keep the anion:cation ratio as 
high as in Edmonton plants, but in the later stages of 
maturity it was apparently not sufficient and the ratio 
dropped slightly below that in the Edmonton plants. 

The effect of soil in altering the composition 
of the grain and straw of the final collection must be 
considered separately as it was not the same as on the 
whole plant. In the growing plant all nutrients except 
phosphorus were higher as a percentage of dry matter in 
the Edmonton samples, but in the grain this condition was 
almost reversed and all the elements except nitrogen were 
higher in the Fallis samples. The translocation of 
nutrients to the grain v/as so much greater in the Fallis 
plants that the grain became richer and the straw poorer 
than in the Edmonton plants. The higher proportion of the 
calcium translocated to the grain in the Fallis plants 
resulted in a percentage of calcium in the grain twice as 
high as in the Edmonton plants. Similarly a much greater 
proportion of the sulphur was translocated to the grain in 
the Fallis samples, but owing to the limiting supply of this

element the greater translocation only brought the sulphur 
percentage of the Fallis grain to about the same level as 
that of the Edmonton grain. It did, however, markedly 
lower the sulphur content of the Eallis straw. 

The percentage rate of uptake of nutrients from 
the black soil, where there was a relatively abundant 
supply of all nutrients, rose to a maximum at about the 
time of heading, while ori the gray soil this rate for 
nitrogen and sulphur was at a maximum before the first 
collection. This means that at Fallis the limiting 
elements were most available during the early stages and 
the growth which was initiated could not be carried through 
to maturity without a marked alteration in the percentage 
composition of the plant. 

The effect of variety in determining the compo¬ 
sition of the wheat plant has generally been observed in 
its effect on the composition of the mature grain or straw. 
No systematic study of the effect of variety in controlling 
the composition of the whole plant at progressive stages of 
maturity has come to the attention of the author . This 
study shows that for certain elements expressed as a per¬ 
centage of dry matter the composition of the two varieties 
was significantly different at practically all stages of 
development. Reward was significantly higher than Red Bobs 
in nitrogen at all collections on the black soil and in 
total ash, phosphorus and potassium for four collections on 
the gray soil. At the time of the last collection the

difference between the varieties was more marked, especially 
in the composition of the straw, than at any other 
collection. 

The ratio of grain to straw and the proportion 
of nutrients translocated to the grain will determine in 
a large measure the composition of the grain which in turn 
will affect the quality of the flour. Varietal differences 
in this respect were found. Red Bobs, for example, 
produced, on both soils, a greater proportion of grain to 
straw than Reward, the difference between the varieties 
being greater at Fallis. This greater proportionate 
production of grain by Red Bobs, grown under the less 
favourable gray soil conditions, was accompanied by a still 
greater proportionate translocation of nutrients to the 
grain, but despite this, the grain of Red Bobs was lower 
in most constituents than that of Reward. 

Soil and variety have definitely affected the 
quality of the wheats produced and also the keeping 
property of the flour milled from this wheat. An attempt 
to relate the differences in absorption already noted to 
these changes in quality is as yet largely a matter of 
speculation. Nitrogen absorption and the percentage of 
protein in the grain is undoubtedly the main factor in 
determining the original quality of the grain, but the 
varietal differences in the deterioration of the flour 
must be due to other causes.

development of the plant might affect the quality of the 
proteins produced in the grain. He believed that acids 
and salts in the cell sap during endosperm formation 
impress upon the gluten the physical properties which 
decide the character of the flour obtained from that wheat. 
Gericke (9) extended this idea, and suggested that the 
plant sap, even before endosperm formation, might influence 
directly the quality of the proteins. He has, with other 
workers (5), stressed the particular importance of minerals 
in this regard. It is interesting to note that in this 
particular experiment the ratio of minerals to protein was 
higher at Fallis and higher in Red Bobs than in Reward, but 
it must be admitted that the relation between nutrition and 
keeping properties of flour is a different problem from 
that under discussion by Wood and Gericke. 

In the Fallis plants the nitrogen-phosphorus- 
sulphur balance is very different from that in the Edmonton 
plants. Since these elements are important constituents 
of the proteins it is possible that the composition of the 
Fallis grain was altered in some way which affected quality. 
If this is the cause the reason for the much more rapid 
deterioration of Red Bobs flour is not clear. 

The importance of lipoidal substances in affect¬ 
ing the physical properties of the wheat proteins is also 
known (38). Storage experiments (31) with flour from 
Edmonton and Fallis wheat have shown that there are greater 
changes in the lipoidal substances in the Fallis flour,

and it seems certain that these changes are related to the 
deterioration of the baking quality of the flour. Phos¬ 
phorus is an important constituent of these lipoidal 
substances, and the greater uptake of phosphorus by plants 
grown at Eallis may in some way alter the metabolism of 
these plants so that the particular lipoidal substances 
formed are more susceptible to alteration than similar 
substances found in the grain grown at Edmonton. 

The studies reported in this part of the paper 
have not necessarily shown all of the important differences 
which may exist in the mineral nutrition of wheat grown on 
the black and gray soils. The importance of other elements 
needed in smaller amounts has been increasingly recognized 
in plant nutrition studies, and it seems equally possible 
that some of these might influence the keeping properties 
of flour. 

Conclusions 


1. Soil and varietal differences definitely 
influenced the composition of the plants. 

2. The weights of' dry matter and all nutrients 
studied were higher for the plants grown at Edmonton. 

3. As a percentage of dry matter all nutrients 
except phosphorus were higher in the Edmonton plants.

phosphorus and potassium when grown at Fallis. 

5. The grain of Fallis plants was higher in all 
ash constituents hut lower in nitrogen. 

6. Varietal differences were more definite in 
the composition of the grain than the whole plant. Reward 
grown on both soils was significantly higher in the per¬ 
centage of nitrogen, ash, phosphorus and magnesium in the 
grain. 

7. The data for total weights, percentages, 
rates of uptake and ion ratios all show that nitrogen and 
sulphur limited growth at Fallis. 

8. It was suggested that the high phosphorus 
uptake by wheat grown at Fallis was in compensation for 
the low supply of nitrogen and sulphur. 

9. The total anion:cation ratios for plants 
grown on the two soils are much more nearly alike than are 
the ratios of individual pairs of ions. 

10. The differences in the original quality of 
the wheat grown on the two soils can be largely accounted 
for by differences in protein level, and therefore nitrogen 
supply. 

11. The differences in keeping properties of the 
flour are suggested as being connected with: 

(a) Ash:nitrogen relationship in grain which was 
definitely higher in Fallis plants. 

(b) The nitrogen:phosphorus: sulphur balance ?/hich 
was very different for plants grown on the two soils.

PART II 


The Distribution of Phosphorus and Nitrogen, and 
Various Phosphorus Fractions in the Developing 
Grain of Reward and Red Bobs Grown at Edmonton 

and Fallis 


Introduction 


The study of the absorption by Reward and Red 
Bobs grown at Edmonton and Fallis showed that one of the 
chief differences was the much greater proportionate ab¬ 
sorption of phosphorus from the gray soil. This caused a 
definite increase in the percentage of phosphorus in the 
vegetative parts of the plant and a slight increase in the 
percentage of phosphorus in the grain. 

It is known that certain phosphorus containing 
substances such as phosphatides, have a direct influence 
on wheat quality and keeping properties of flour. It was 
thought, therefore, that the higher phosphorus in the 
Fallis grain might in some way be connected with the 
quality and keeping properties of the flour. It was 
decided to study the distribution of phosphorus in the 
developing grain of Reward and Red Bobs grown on the two 
soils to determine whether the differences in the phosphorus 
fractions were of the same order as the differences in

total phosphorus. 

Many analyses of the developing wheat kernel 
have been made, and a good review of the subject up to 
1925 is given by Bailey (4). The changes in the nitrogen 
content have been studied in detail by Woodman and Engledow 
(37) who have shown definitely that total nitrogen as a 
percentage of dry matter decreases for about 35 days after 
flowering and then increases until the grain is ripe. 
Similar but less extensive studies for the distribution of 
phosphorus were made by Rousseaux and Sirot (28) who 
showed that the phosphoric acid content tended to parallel 
that of nitrogen. 

Phosphorus is believed to occur in the grain in 
the following forms: (1) Phytin 

(2) Pho spholip oids 

(3) Hexose phosphate 

(4) Nucleic acid 

(5) Phosphoprotains 

No practical methods are, however, available for dividing 
the total phosphorus into these various fractions. Knowles 
and Watkins (13) studied the distribution of nitrogen and 
phosphorus in the growing wheat plant and ear. They 
reported total, lipoid, phytin and inorganic phosphorus 
and showed that at maturity the total phosphorus in the ear 
was made up of 49.3% phytin, 2.9% lipoid and 47.8% in¬ 
organic phosphorus. Their inorganic phosphorus was 
obtained by subtracting phytin plus lipoid from total

phosphorus and must have contained phosphorus in the form 
of nucleic acids and phosphoproteins. 

Mather (17) determined the amounts of certain 
phosphorus fractions in hay. He reports the phosphorus in 
a lfo hydrochloric acid extract, and the inorganic, total 
organic, soluble and insoluble organic fractions. 

Deturk (7) analysed corn plants for total phos¬ 
phorus and alcohol soluble, inorganic, soluble organic and 
acid insoluble fractions. Many other workers have carried 
out similar investigations with various plants. The 
methods of analysis reported vary considerably and were in 
general carried out on the dried material. 

In order to present a true picture of the dis¬ 
tribution of the various phosphorus fractions in the living 
plant it was decided to use only fresh material. Michel- 
Durant (21), in a study of the phosphorus metabolism of the 
mistletoe plant, described a method for the determination 
of six phosphorus fractions in the fresh leaf. The methods 
employed in this experiment were an adaptation of those 
reported by him. 

Experimental Material 


During the summer of 1935 Reward and Red Bobs 
wheat were grown on adjacent 1/20 acre plots at Edmonton 
and Fallis under conditions similar to those of the 1934 
experiment.

Heads at the same stage of maturity were ob¬ 
tained by tagging the centre culm at the beginning of 
flowering. Thirty-five hundred heads of each variety were 
tagged at Edmonton on July 16 and 18 respectively. At 
Fallis it was estimated that the varieties were one day 
later in flowering than at Edmonton, and 1500 heads of 
each variety, at the same stage of development, were 
tagged on July 19. 

Collections of heads of both varieties were made 
at 8.00 a.m. twice a week at Edmonton and once a week at 
Fallis. Enough heads to give the required weight of sample 
were collected at random from the plots and conveyed 
immediately to the laboratory. The grain ?/as threshed out 
by hand and used at once for the various chemical 
determinations. 

At Edmonton on the night of August 15 the 
temperature dropped below the freezing point for at least 
six hours. The minimum temperature recorded in the wheat 
field at approximately three feet above ground level was 
24°F. This frost occurred when the kernels of Reward and 
Red Bobs contained 43.6% and 41.3% dry matter and stopped 
translocation of nitrogen to the kernels. Small sections 
of the plots were, however, protected by fires. The grain 
in these areas was very little damaged, as determined by 
weight of 1000 kernels, and was used for the last four 
collections. A frost also occurred at Fallis, and 
although it was not nearly as severe it probably had some 
effect on translocation.

and determined by titration with standard sodium hydroxide 
solution. The details of the method are described by 
Richards and G-odden (27). 

Ljpoidal Phosphorus : - There has been much dis¬ 
cussion of recent years as to the best method of extracting 
lipoids from plant material. Sando (29) gives a good 
review of the methods employed up to 1928. The chief 
advantage of the method employed in the present experiment 
was that it could be used on fresh material. 

Duplicate samples of fresh grain (approximately 
10 grams dry weight) were ground with absolute alcohol in 
a mortar. The ground material was transferred to a 200 cc. 
Erlenmeyer flask, the volume of alcohol made up to 100 cc. 
and the contents refluxed for two hours. The alcohol was 
then decanted off and 75 cc. more added. This was 
refluxed for 12 hours. The alcohol was then filtered off 
by suction through a s^intered glass funnel and the 
residue washed once. The two alcohol extracts were 
combined, slowly evaporated to dryness and the residue 
re-extracted with 75 cc. of boiling ether for three 
hours. The ether extract was evaporated to dryness and 
the total phosphorus in it, determined by the wet digestion 
method described above, was called "lipoid phosphorus”. 

Sando states that the alcohol extract simul¬ 
taneously removes with the lipoids most of the soluble 
carbohydrates which interfere with the subsequent extrac¬ 
tion of the syrupy residue with ether. Digestion of the

ether extract by nitric and sulphuric acids was a very 
slow process. It was often more than 15 hours before a 
clear colourless solution was obtained. 

Residual Soluble Phosphorus : - Total phosphorus 
in the residue from the ether extract, determined by wet 
digestion method, was called "residual soluble phosphorus". 
This fraction varies with the amount of water in the fresh 
material and the consequent dilution of the alcohol and 
probably contained much inorganic phosphorus in the 
earlier collections. 

Inorganic Phosphorus : - The residue from one 
of the duplicate alcohol extracts was re-extracted with 
200 cc. of 10% trichloracetic acid for three hours with 
continual shaking. Aliquots of the filtrate were used 
for the determination of total soluble and inorganic 
phosphorus. The latter fraction was precipitated as 
strychnine molybdophosphate, dried at 110°C. and then 
weighed. The method was an adaptation of the Embden-Fetter 
gravimetric method for inorganic phosphate of serum, 
plasma or blood as described by Peters and Yan Slyke (24). 

The net hod was very satisfactory if the amount 
of in the aliquot was reduced to one mgm. If the 

precipitate was any larger it was very difficult to 
filter, and due to its flocculent nature it probably 
carried down other phosphorus containing substances 
besides the inorganic forms.

Total Soluble Phosphorus : - This fraction was 
determined on an aliquot of the trichloracetic acid extract 
and probably inoludes the phytin and inorganic fractions• 

Residual Insoluble Phosphorus : - This fraction 
included all the phosphorus in the residue from the tri¬ 
chloracetic acid extract. It represents mainly the 
phosphorus in the form of phosphoproteins and nucleic acids. 

Phytin Phosphorus : - The residue from the second 
duplicate alcohol extract was re-extracted for three hours 
with 200 cc. of Z c fo hydrochloric acid v/ith continual 
shaking. Aliquots of the filtrate were titrated with 
ferric chloride using 1 cc. of 5 fo sodium salicylate as an 
indicator. The method was Aver ill and King’s (3) 
modification of the original Heubner and Stadler method. 

The drawback to this method was the formation of 
a slow settling flocculent precipitate which obscured the 
end point. More accurate methods have been devised. 

Andrews and Bailey (2) suggested titrating short of the 
end point and then completing the titration on the 
filtrate. Harris and Mosher (10) suggested titrating 
beyond the end point, filtering and determining the amount 
of excess ferric chloride in the solution by comparison of 
the colour with a solution of known strength. These 
methods are more laborious and for the purpose of the 
present experiment the method used was considered 
sufficiently accurate. Phosphorus in all the fractions 
was reported as PgOg.

It cannot be claimed that the above scheme for 
the fractionation of the total phosphorus is wholly satis¬ 
factory or even that the fractions represent definite types 
of phosphorus compounds. The methods adopted are, 
however, relatively simple in their procedure and are 
practicable from the point of view of time and labour 
involved in their carrying out. They enable the total 
phosphorus of the grain to be partitioned at every stage 
of development into a series of comparable fractions and 
thus make possible the comparison, in a broad sense, of 
the phosphorus metabolism of grain when grown on the black 
and gray soils. 


Results 


Total Nitrogen and Phosphorus . 

The results for total nitrogen and phosphorus 
in the grain at progressive stages of maturity are shown 
graphically in Fig. 10. The top two curves represent 
nitrogen and phosphorus as a percentage of dry matter, 

and the two lower curves as total weights per 1000 kernels. 

Nitrogen as a percentage of dry matter decreased 
for approximately 25 days after flowering and then 
increased. These results are in agreement with other work 
of this nature. In the early stages of the development of 
the grain the percentage of nitrogen decreased because

endosperm was being formed which was lower in nitrogen 
content than the bran layers. Later in development, when 
the majority of the endosperm had been formed, the per¬ 
centage of nitrogen increased due to the loss of carbo¬ 
hydrates by respiration. The changes in phosphorus as a 
percentage of dry matter are very similar to the changes 
in nitrogen. The shape of the curves for the two con¬ 
stituents were much the same except that the minimum point 
on the phosphorus curves was reached a few days later than 
it was for nitrogen. 




Fig. 10. Total nitrogen and phosphorus in the 
developing grain of Reward, Red Bobs, 
grown at Edmonton and Fallis. 

Nitrogen was at all times definitely higher in 
Reward than in Red Bobs and also in Edmonton as compared 
with Fallis grain. The differences between varieties and 
soils in the percentage of phosphorus were also quite

definite. Reward was consistently higher than Red Bobs 
but, as had been shown in previous analyses, the percentage 
of phosphorus was higher in the Fallis grain. 

The total weights of nitrogen and phosphorus in 
1000 kernels gradually rose to a maximum at about the 
fiftieth day after flowering for nitrogen and a few days 
later for phosphorus. The weights of phosphorus in grain 
from both soils were approximately the same until about 
the twenty-fifth day after flowering when the phosphorus 
in the Fallis grain fell slightly below that in the 
Edmonton grain. 

The rate of translocation to the grain of nitrogen 
and phosphorus is shown in Table IX for Red Bobs grown at 
Edmonton and Fallis. The rate, which rises to a maximum 
and then falls* is represented by the increase in weight 
of the constituents in 1000 kernels per day. The trans¬ 
location of nitrogen did not altogether follow the trans¬ 
location of phosphorus. The ratios in the last column of 

the table compare the rate of translocation of nitrogen 
and phosphorus. Phosphorus was translocated comparatively 
faster in the earlier stages of the development of the 
grain and reached its maximum rate of translocation a Y/eek 
or so before nitrogen translocation reached a similar 


maximum

Phosphorus Fractions as a Percentage of Dry Matter and 

Total Phosphorus , 

The results for the six phosphorus fractions 
expressed as a percentage of dry matter are presented in 
Table X for Red Bobs grown at Edmonton and Red Bobs and 
Reward grown at Fallis. The total soluble, inorganic, 
residual insoluble and lipoid fractions for Edmonton 
and Fallis Red Bobs are represented graphically in 
Pig. 11. 

Phytin phosphorus is the chief storage form of 
phosphorus in the grain, and the results show that as the 
grain matured it gradually increased as a percentage of

dry matter. In the Fallis grain there was a slight 
decrease in the later stages of development, hut the 
maximum percentage was higher than in the Edmonton 
grain. 



Fig. 11. The percentage of four phosphorus fractions 
in the developing grain of Red Bobs grown 
at Edmonton and Fallis. 

Total soluble phosphorus was the largest 
fraction and must have included the phytin and inorganic 
forms. As a percentage of dry matter it decreased for 
about 20 days after flowering and then rose, the changes 
being similar to those for total phosphorus (Fig. 10). 

The percentage in the Fallis Red Bobs grain was at all 
times higher than in similar samples from Edmonton. 

The percentage of inorganic phosphorus gradually 
decreased as the grain matured. This is the main form in 
which phosphorus is translocated in the plant, and the

percentage in the grain depends upon the amount translocated 
and the proportion converted into other types of phosphorus. 
The percentage was at all times higher in the Eallis grain. 

Residual insoluble phosphorus, which represents 
phosphorus in the form of nucleic acids and phospho- 
proteins, was the only fraction that was definitely higher 
in the Edmonton grain. Twelve days after flowering the 
percentage in the Edmonton grain was twice as high as that 
in the Fallis grain, but it fell so rapidly that at 
maturity there was no appreciable difference in the 
percentages in the grain from the two soils. 

The graphs illustrate the steady fall in the 
percentage of lipoid phosphorus. There was no definite 
difference between Edmonton and Fallis grain. 

Residual soluble phosphorus varied with the 
amount of water in the fresh samples and therefore as a 
percentage of dry matter it gradually decreased as the 
grain matured. 

The results can also be considered in another way 
by expressing them as a percentage of the total phosphorus 
(Table XI). The phytin and total soluble fractions were 
the only fractions that increased as the grain matured. 

The slight increase in the total soluble fraction was 
undoubtedly due to its phytin content. Inorganic and 
lipoid phosphorus decreased regularly while the residual 
insoluble fraction remained fairly constant until about 30 
days after flowering when there was a definite decrease.

The weights of all other fractions rose to a maximum and 
then decreased. This suggests that the phosphorus compounds 
represented by these fractions were broken down during the 
maturation processes of the grain and the phosphorus 
stored as phytin phosphorus* 

The marked decrease in the weight of residual 
insoluble phosphorus took place about 35 days after flower¬ 
ing* Woodman and Engledow (37) and Newton and McCalla 
(23) have shown that a coherent gluten can only be obtained 
from the grain after desiccation has started or when the 
grain contains about 55$ dry matter, (in this experiment 
about 45 days after flowering) . Undoubtedly the first 
changes in the proteins or other compounds which are to 
form gluten must take place several days before this. 

Prom the results of this experiment it appears that the 
proteins which are present prior to the formation of gluten 
are richer in phosphorus, and that when gluten formation 
begins a part of this phosphorus is split off and converted 
into some other form, possibly phytin. 

Owing to the larger size of the Edmonton Red Bobs 
kernels the weight of all fractions, except inorganic in 
the earlier stages of growth, was higher in the Edmonton 
samples.

the proteins their relation to the amount of protein 
nitrogen occurring in the grain should he of interest. 

This relation is shown in Table XIII as the weight of the 
phosphorus fractions expressed as a percentage of the 
protein nitrogen. The percentage of residual insoluble 
phosphorus decreased as the grain matured and vms 
approximately the same for grain grown on both soils. 

This was an indication that the proteins of the grain were 
richer in phosphorus during the earlier stages of the 
grain’s development, and that the percentage of phosphorus 
in the proteins was the same for Bed Bobs grain grown at 
both Edmonton and Pallis.

Lipoid phosphorus which has been suggested as 
being important in influencing wheat quality was slightly 
higher in relation to protein nitrogen in the Fallis grain 
and decreased with the maturity of the grain. Phytin and 
total soluble phosphorus bore a fairly constant relation 
to the protein nitrogen, but the percentage was very much 
higher in the Fallis grain. These results are in 
agreement with the conclusion of Knowles and Watkins (13) 
who suggested a relation between protein nitrogen and 
phytin phosphorus. 

The Effect of Frost on the Proportions of the Phosphorus 

Fractions . 

The frost which occurred when the Edmonton Red 
Bobs grain contained 46.9$ dry matter almost completely 
stopped the translocation of nitrogen and phosphorus to 
the grain. It also had a definite effect on certain of 
the phosphorus fractions. Although this effect of frost 
is of no apparent importance to the general problem, it 
seemed advisable to report the observations. 

The weight of lipoid phosphorus in 1000 kernels 
had decreased by 50$ eight hours after the frost had 
ceased. This change was the same in both varieties studied 
at Edmonton. The following weights of lipoid phosphorus 
in frozen and unfrozen Red Bobs grain grown at Edmonton 
illustrate the magnitude of the changes.

Because the weight of all fractions was increasing 
and because lipoid at this stage of development was only 
approximately 10 fo of the total phosphorus, it was not 
possible to tell definitely into which form of phosphorus 
the lipoid phosphorus was converted. The sudden increase 
in the weight of total soluble phosphorus in the 
collection after the frost was greater than the correspond¬ 
ing increase in total phosphorus, and indicated that the 
lipoid was converted into this form. 

In the sample collected four days after the 
frost there was also a definite decrease in the weight of 
phytin phosphorus. 


Conclusions 


1. As a percentage of dry matter total 
phosphorus in the developing grain decreases and then 
increases in a manner similar to total nitrogen. 

2. The percentages of phytin, total soluble and 
inorganic phosphorus fractions were definitely higher in 
Fallis grain.

3 0 The percentage of residual insoluble 
phosphorus was higher in the Edmonton grain in the earlier 
stages of development. 

4. Calculations of the relation between the 
phosphorus fractions and protein nitrogen showed that the 
proportion of phytin and total soluble phosphorus was much 
higher in the Fallis grain and indicated that the 
phosphorus composition of the proteins was the same for 
grain grown on both soils. 

5. The higher total phosphorus in the Fallis 
grain was due mainly to the phosphorus represented by 
the total soluble fraction, probably phytin and 
inorganic. 

6. Frost caused a very sudden decrease in the 
amount of lipoid phosphorus, and a slower decrease in the 
amount of phytin phosphorus.

PART III 


A Study of the Relationship Between Nitrate and 
Phosphate Absorption, Using Reward, Red Bobs 
and Marquis Grown in Nutrient 
Culture Solutions 


Introduction 


In Part I it was suggested that the proportion¬ 
ately greater absorption of phosphorus from the gray soil 
and its higher concentration in the above ground parts of 
the gray soil plants was perhaps due to the low availability 
of nitrogen and sulphur. 

The results discussed in this section deal with 
a preliminary study, made by the use of nutrient culture 
solutions, on the relationship between nitrate and 
phosphate absorption. 

The severe limitation of any important element 
from the nutrient culture will cause the plants grown in 
that culture to be reduced in yield and the absorption of 
all other nutrients to be decreased. Thomas (22), 
studying the absorption, utilization and recovery of 
nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium by apple trees, has 
emphasized this law of the minimum; he says:

"The omission of any one of these elements 
from the complete fertilizer is followed 
by a decreased absorption of the remaining 
elements. This decreased absorption result¬ 
ing in a nutritional lack of balance as 
exhibited in reduced growth and flowering." 

Limitations of elements at later stages in the 

growth period of plants have, however, caused an increase 

in the absorption of certain of the other elements, and 

the results reported in this experiment show that a 

limitation of nitrogen throughout the growth of the 

plant caused an increase in the total absorption of 

phosphorus as compared with the complete culture. The 

type of results obtained depends, of course, on the 

degree of limitation. 

Even though the total absorption of the non¬ 
limiting elements may be decreased and the total yield 
of the plant lowered, as a percentage of the dry matter 
certain of the non-limiting elements are often increased. 
This has been shown to be the relationship between 
nitrogen and phosphorus. Hoagland (11) states 

"In our experiments on wheat we found 
that omitting the phosphate in the later 
stages of growth produced a very large 
increase in the nitrogen content of the 
grain." 

On the other hand a high concentration of 
phosphorus in the soil will cause a decrease in the 
percentage of nitrogen in the plant. Krugel et al (15), 
working with barley in pot cultures showed that the 
nitrogen in the grain was definitely decreased by 
phosphorus fertilization.

Similarly, an alteration in the nitrogen supply 
will cause a change in the percentage of phosphorus in 
the plant, Proebsting (25) with orchard trees and 
Kraybill (14) with the tomato have shown that nitrogen 
fertilizers will increase the percentage of nitrogen in 
the plant but decrease the percentage of phosphorus. 

It seems to be fairly well established, there¬ 
fore, that a high or low availability of phosphorus will 
decrease or increase the percentage of nitrogen in the 
plant, and that a high availability of nitrogen will 
decrease the percentage of phosphorus in the plant. 

The studies reported here deal particularly 
with the one phase of the nitrogen-phosphorus relation¬ 
ship for which no results are apparently available, and 
the phase which is of particular interest in regard to 
nutritional conditions in Fallis soil; the effect of 
limiting nitrogen supply on the percentage of phosphorus 
in the plant. 

Experimental Material 


Three series of material were produced in the 
course of this experiment. The first and most complete 
series consisted of four lots of Marquis wheat each 
grown in tanks measuring 50 x 60 x 8 inches. The plants 
were germinated on cheesecloth over a nutrient solution

and transferred to the tanks when one week old. Each 
plant was set in an individual cork, and there were 128 
plants to each culture tank. The solutions in the tanks 
were aerated for half an hour daily, the air being intro¬ 
duced through perforated rubber tubing laid at six inch 
intervals over the whole bottom of the tank. Pressure was 
supplied by an air compressor operating at approximately 
five pounds per square inch. This maintained a constant 
and uniform air flow which did not harm the roots. Each 
of the other two series consisted of three tanks 
30 x 30 x 8 inches with 64 plants in each. Reward was 
grown in one series and Red Bobs in the other. The seeds 
were germinated and the plants treated in the same manner 
as in the first series, except that no aeration was used. 

The solutions used in the various tanks are 
recorded in Table XIV and their chemical composition in 
Table XV. It was necessary to add the nitrogen or phos¬ 
phorus salts to the limited cultures at short intervals 
or else for a considerable part of the time the plants 
would have been growing in solutions free of these 
nutrients. It was therefore decided to use solutions 
one-quarter the strength of the usual Hoagland solution, 
and to renew them in all tanks every 10 days instead of 
every month as Hoagland suggests. The small amounts of 
nitrate in cultures 2 and 3 and phosphate in culture 4 
were added every two days.

altering the concentration of calcium and potassium.

other cultures. Measurements showed that growth in the 
low phosphorus culture was the poorest and that plants 
grown in the low nitrogen cultures were less vigorous 
than those grown in the complete:low nitrogen culture. 

The increasing order of severity of the treatments was 
complete, complete:low nitrogen, low nitrogen, low phos¬ 
phorus . 

Hoot growth was greater in the aerated Marquis 
cultures. The average root-top ratio was highest in the 
low phosphorus cultures and definitely higher in the low 
nitrogen than in the complete cultures. 

The deficient culture plants matured earlier 
than the control plants. The complete culture plants 
of Reward matured prematurely due to an abnormal condition 
of the roots, which developed soon after heading, and 
caused them to blacken and decay. The results for this 
culture after Collection 4 are, therefore, not comparable 
to the other complete culture plants. 

Chemical Analyses . 

The results for the weights per plant of dry 
matter, nitrogen, ash, phosphorus, potassium and calcium 
in the tops and roots of Marquis are shown in Fig. 13 
and 14, respectively. The results for Marquis only are 
presented,as they were representative of the results for 
Reward and Red Bobs.

Total weights of nutrients per plant of Marquis at 
progressive stages of maturity and grown in five 
different culture solutions 



Fig. 13. Total weight in vegetative parts. 



Fig. 14. Total weight in roots 












































- 8S 


The chemical composition of vegetative parts of 
the first four collections and the vegetative parts and 
grain of the last two collections are presented, as a 
percentage of the dry matter, in Table XVII. The composi¬ 
tion of the roots of all collections is shown in Table 
XVIII. 

The complete results for Collection 1 indicate 
the magnitude of the experimental error. Cultures one 
and two at the time of the first collection were of the 
same constitution, yet the composition of the same variety 
grown in them varied considerably. It is doubtful whether 
the method of experimentation used was sufficiently 
accurate to determine varietal differences. 

Relationship Between Nitrate and Phosphate Absorption . 

The total weight results, represented by those 
for Marquis (Fig. IS and 14) show that the limitation of 
nitrogen caused a decrease in yield and a decrease in the 
absorption of all nutrients except phosphorus. 

Table XIX shows that total phosphorus in the 
vegetative parts of the plants limited in nitrogen was 
lower than in the controls, but that the weight in the 
roots was very definitely higher. The total phosphate 
absorption by the whole plant was slightly higher in the 
limited nitrogen cultures.

Limitation of nitrogen did not increase the 
percentage of phosphorus in the vegetative parts or the 
grain (Table XVII). The percentages in the low nitrogen 
cultures of Reward and Red Bobs were in general slightly 
lower than in the complete, while the percentages in the 
low nitrogen cultures of Marquis were approximately the 
same as in the complete for all except the last collection 
when they were definitely higher. 

The results of the chemical analyses of the 
roots (Table XVIII and Fig. 14) showed that there was 
more phosphorus in the roots grown in the limited nitrogen 
cultures, and that phosphorus as a percentage of dry matter 




























- 86 - 


was definitely higher in these roots. At the time of 
the last collection the percentage of phosphorus in the 
roots of all low nitrogen cultures was more than twice as 
high as in the roots grown in complete culture. This 
difference was even greater in the weights of total 
phosphorus (Fig. 14). 

The results show that the nitrogen limitations 
used in these experiments caused a definite decrease in 
yie3.d and a very large increase in the absorption of 
phosphate by the roots which was not translocated to the 
vegetative parts of the plant. 

The limitation of phosphorus caused a much 
greater decrease in yield than the limitation of nitrogen 
and a correspondingly greater decrease in the absorption 
of all nutrients. The absorption of nitrogen was markedly 
decreased and the percentage of nitrogen in the vegetative 
parts and roots was very much lower than in the complete 
culture plants. The percentage in the grain was, however, 
increased. 

This higher concentration of nitrogen in the 
grain is in agreement with Eoagland f s results (11), but 
it is probably not due to the same cause. In Hoagland's 
experiments the phosphorus supply was not altered until 
quite late in the development of the plant, and then it 
was stopped completely. In this experiment phosphorus was 
limiting throughout growth and must, from its effect on 
yield, have markedly upset many of the metabolic processes

of the plant. The higher concentration of nitrogen in 
the grain is probably a very indirect effect of the low 
phosphorus supply, and is no real indication of a 
relationship between nitrate and phosphate absorption. 

Culture 2 in Relation to Fallis Soil Conditions . 

The supply of nitrogen in culture 2 (complete:low 
N) was planned to be similar to the supply of nitrogen 
in the Fallis soils. Analyses of the plants grown at 
Fallis showed that 37 % of the total nitrogen absorbed was 
absorbed in the first month. The composition of culture 
2 was so arranged that plants grown in it also absorbed 
37 % of the total available nitrogen in the first month of 
growth. Results in the first part of this paper also 
indicated that phosphorus was at all times readily 
available in the Fallis soil. The phosphorus supply in 
culture 2 was much in excess of the needs of the plant. 

It may be assumed then that the supply of 
nitrogen and phosphorus in culture 2 was somewhat similar 
to the nitrogen and phosphorus supply in the Fallis soil. 
Comparison of the chemical analyses of the plants grown 
in culture 2 and on Fallis soil should therefore indicate 
the importance of the nitrogen-phosphorus relationship in 
controlling the c outdo sition of the Fallis plants. 

In order to make such a comparison it was 
necessary to have some control with which to compare the 
composition of the Fallis plants, and Edmonton plants

have been used. The Edmonton soil has, however, been 
shown to respond to phosphate fertilizer and may be 
limiting in this element. 

Plants grown in culture 2 fail to show the 
increase in the percentage of phosphorus noted under 
Fa11is conditions. These plants were lower in all 
constituents than the control, but the smallest differ¬ 
ences were in the percentages of phosphorus and 
magnesium. 

One of the important differences between the 
composition of the Fallis and Edmonton plants was that 
the Fallis grain was much richer in all constituents. 

This difference did not exist between culture Z and 
culture 1 (complete). The grain grown in culture 2 was 
definitely lower in all constituents than the grain grown 
in the complete culture. This greater concentration of 
nutrients in the Fallis grain was brought about by a 
greatly increased translocation of nutrients to the 
grain. There was also a greater translocation of some 
nutrients in the plants grown in culture Z as the following 
Table XX shows, but the increase was not as great as it 
was at Fallis, nor was it sufficient to raise the 
percentage composition of the grain above that of the 
control. Table IX shows that there was a much greater 
percentage translocation of phosphorus and magnesium under 
field conditions.

Table XXI gives the nitrogen:phosphorus ratios 
in the plants of Reward and Red Bobs grown in cultures 1 
and 2 and at Edmonton and Fallis at progressive stages of 
maturity. The ratios for the plants grown in culture 2 
and on Fallis soil were very much alike. Ratios for plants 
grown in culture 1 were, however, lower than corresponding 
ratios for the Edmonton plants. This is indication that 
phosphorus was less available at Edmonton than in the 
complete culture.

These comparisons indicate that the nitrogen 
phosphorus relationship in the Fallis soil was not alone 
responsible for the high phosphorus content of the Fallis 
plants. The failure of the plants grown in low nitrogen 
cultures to translocate the high accumulation of phosphorus 
in the roots to the vegetative parts is important. A 
correspondingly high accumulation of calcium suggested 
that perhaps the phosphorus was precipitated in the roots 
as calcium phosphate. further experiments are, however, 
being carried out to determine the effect of limiting 
other nutrients beside nitrogen on the accumulation of 
phosphorus in the plant.

Conclusions 


1. The limitations of nitrogen caused a 
definite decrease in yield and a decrease in the absorp¬ 
tion of all nutrients studied except phosphorus. There 
was a very large increase in the absorption of phosphate 
by the roots, but it was not translocated to the grain. 

2. The limitation of phosphorus caused a 
much greater decrease in yield than the limitations of 
nitrogen and a correspondingly greater decrease in the 
absorption of all nutrients. The percentage of nitrogen 
in the vegetative parts and roots was much lower than 

in the control plants, but the percentage in the grain 
was slightly higher. 

3* A comparison of the composition of the 
plants grown in culture 2 and those grown on the Fallis 
soil indicated that the nitrogen-phosphorus relationship 
was not alone responsible for the high percentage of 
phosphorus in the Fallis plants.

GENERAL SUMMARY 


The results reported are only of a preliminary 
nature, and it is impossible to draw any definite con¬ 
clusions from them with regard to the relation between the 
nutrition of the wheat plant and its effect on wheat 
quality or the ability of the flour milled from the wheat 
to keep on storage. 

The percentage of protein in the grain, which 
is related to the absorption of nitrogen by the whole 
plant, is known to be highly correlated with wheat quality, 
and undoubtedly the ability of the varieties to accumulate 
nitrogen in the grain when grown under the two soil 
conditions was the greatest factor in determining the 
quality of the wheat produced. Other factors must, 
however, be important in determining many of the physical 
properties of the grain proteins and the changes in these 
properties which accompany flour storage. 

There were definite differences in the absorp¬ 
tion of nutrients by the two varieties growing on both 
soils, but further experimentation is necessary before it 
can be stated whether these differences are responsible 
for the known differences in the quality and keeping 
properties of the flour milled from these varieties. 
Nitrogen, phosphorus and sulphur are undoubtedly very 
important in determining the nature of the proteins and 
the baking quality of the flour, and if may be the upset

in the balance of these constituents in the Fallis grain 
that is particularly important; but many of the other 
elements, particularly those that occur only in small 
quantities and act in the role of catalysts, may be just 
as important. 

The composition of the plants at progressive 
stages of development have shown that there are clear cut 
differences between the absorption of the two varieties 
and the reaction of the varieties to two very different 
soil types. This type of result, which elucidates the 
factors of yield and grain composition, should be of 
particular importance in the evaluation of varieties by 
the plant breeder. 

The results also indicate clearly the avail¬ 
ability of the important nutrients in the two soils and 
suggest various fertilizer practices. It is only by the 
use of studies of this nature, which determine the avail¬ 
ability of nutrients in the soil at all stages in the life 
cycle of the plant, that accurate scientific calculations 
of the fertilizer requirements of a soil can be made. 

As far as the writer is aware, the experiments 
on the phosphorus composition of the developing grain are 
more comprehensive than any previously reported. The 
changes in the nitrogen content have been studied in much 
detail by previous workers, and it has been suggested 
that phosphorus varies in a manner similar to nitrogen. 

The results reported in this paper are in general agreement

with the previous work on phosphorus distribution in wheat 
and other seeds. Phytin is the main storage form of 
phosphorus and accumulates as the grain matures due to 
the transport of phosphorus from the vegetative parts of 
the plant and the break down of other phosphorus compounds 
in the grain. The results also show that the percentage 
of phosphorus in the proteins and closely related 
compounds was higher in the earlier stages of the grain’s 
development and decreased with the formation of the gluten 
proteins. 

The nutrient culture experiments failed to show 
an accumulation of phosphorus in the plants grown v/ith a 
limited supply of nitrogen. The reason for this failure 
is as yet unknown. Various possibilities suggest them¬ 
selves. It may have been due to the degree or method of 
limitation of the nitrogen, the pH of the solution, the 
presence of too high or too low a concentration of other 
nutrients or any other variable of the nutrient culture 
solution. Further experiments are being planned to in¬ 
vestigate the action of decreasing the pH of the solution 
and lowering the concentration of sulphur and calcium.
