ABSTRACT 


The effects upon the triaxial shear strength of a local submarginal 
gravel, brought about by adding several different percentages of Portland cement 
and lime-fly ash admixtures were investigated. The vacuum triaxial testing pro¬ 
gram carried out to investigate these effects was of a specialized nature in that 
the maximum particle size included in the test specimens was 3 inches. This 
resulted in the testing of specimens 12 inches in diameter by 24 inches high. In 
comparison to the triaxial tests performed on the native gravel, it was found that 
the presence of the various admixtures investigated: 

(a) improved the workability of the gravel, especially the lime-fly 
ash admixtures, 

(b) increased the dry density of the compacted specimens, depending 
on type and quantity of admixture, 

(c) decreased the Plasticity Index of the fine fraction of the gravel, 

(d) substantially increased the compressive strength of the material. 
In degree of improvement, the Portland cement admixture investigated 
proved superior to the lime-fly ash admixture on an equal material cost 
basis. 

Not included within the scope of this investigation were the effects 
upon the strength and plasticity of the admixture-aggregate compositions resulting 
from extended periods of cure coupled with the cyclic action of weathering agencies, 
as well as the effects upon strength as a result of saturating the specimens before 


test.

CHAPTER I

PURPOSE AND PREVIEW OF INVESTIGATION 

The chief purpose of this investigation was to ascertain the nature 
and degree of compressive strength benefits resulting from the treatment of a local 
gravel with Portland cement and lime-fly ash admixtures* The gravel from this 
particular deposit is typical of many submarginal gravels found in Alberta in that 
it contains a relatively high proportion of plastic fines. The amount of these fines 
present and their plasticity characteristics are higher than the usual limits set for 
subbase, base and surface courses by most North American highway agencies. For 
a typical set of such specifications, see Appendix A. 

It was hoped that chemical stabilizing agents could be found that 
would economically increase the strength characteristics of this material so that it 
might be usefully employed in subbase and base course construction when better 
sources of gravel become depleted or become too far distant for economic use. After 
a survey of some of the work done in this field and reported in the literature on the 
subject, it was decided that Portland cement and lime-fly ash would be investigated 
as possible admixtures as they have both been used successfully on gravels of this 
type elsewhere. (See page 133, biographical source 11 and biographical source 18.) 
The cement, lime, and fly ash are all available in quantity locally and are relatively 
cheap, especially the fly ash which is a waste product of coal-burning utility plants. 

Previous investigators have used several different methods of 
evaluating strength changes as criteria in comparing the effects of admixtures. 
Among these methods are the triaxial shear test, the California bearing ratio 
test, (2,3,5,6) ^ p[ veem cohesiometer test (^). The usual type of triaxial 

shear test employed was an unconfined test of cubes or small cylinders (1*7, 8,9,10)

rather than restrained tests These tests were usually done on minus #4 

sieve size material. 

It was considered desirable for this investigation however, that the 
whole range of gravel sizes which might be used in a subbase or base course be in¬ 
cluded in the strength tests so that the effects of the coarser sizes would be included. 

A material simulating a minus 3 in. crush was used for the investigation and it was 
concluded that the presence of this size of rock in a test specimen would invalidate 
any semi-empirical, penetration type, strength tests (C.B.R.). Thus the triaxial 
shear test was decided upon for use in the investigation. Since unconfined strength 
testing (triaxial shear testing with zero lateral pressure) could not be satisfactorily 
carried out on this granular material, vacuum triaxial shear tests at three different 
lateral pressures was the method chosen to investigate strength changes. This method, 
though not as readily carried out as unconfined tests, does give more information and 
is a great deal more simple to execute than positive pressure triaxial tests. Moreover, 
the vacuum triaxial test is well suited for use in tests on unsaturated granular mater- 
iai(14,16)^ such as that used in this investigation. To test this gravel triaxially 
meant that a specimen at least 12 ins. in diameter by 24 ins. in length would be re¬ 
quired, as it has been found that a minimum ratio of test specimen diameter to maxi¬ 
mum particle size of 4 should be observedSimilarly, a ratio of height to dia¬ 
meter of 2 is usually employed in cylindrical compression testing. Special apparatus 
to accommodate the preparation and testing of specimens of this size by vacuum tri- 
axial methods was designed and constructed. 

A comprehensive series of classification and identification tests were 
carried out upon the materials to be used in the investigation before commencing 











with the triaxial testing program. 


The physical labor which is involved in processing, mi xin g and 
compacting triaxial specimens of these dimensions is considerable as well as 
being time consuming. For these reasons, the scope of the triaxial shear in¬ 
vestigation was limited to: 

(a) one particular type of gravel, 

(b) two different percentages of a particular cement tested after a 
specific period, i.e. one day cure, 

(c) two different percentages of one particular lime and one particular 

fly ash (the percentages of lime to fly ash by weight remaining constant), 
tested after two periods of cure, i.e. no cure and one week cure. 

While not included within the scope of this investigation, the following considerations 

might well prove worthy of future study: 

(a) the effects of long-term cyclic weathering action upon the permanency 
of the strength and plasticity benefits derived by the use of the admix¬ 
tures investigated, 

(b) the immediate and long-term effects upon the plasticity characteristics 
of the gravel resulting from incorporation of trace quantities of the 
admixtures investigated, 

(c) the effects upon the strength of the admixture-aggregate compositions 
when tested in a saturated condition rather than a partially saturated 
condition. 

The maximum amount of cement which was considered to be econ¬ 
omical for use with this gravel was 5% by weight of dry aggregate. Using this 
figure, the cost of Normal Portland cement used in a 6 in. compacted base would 
range from $ .25 to $ .28 per sq.yd. ($1.50 to $1.68 per cu.yd. compacted) for 
a density range in the compacted material of 125 to 140 lbs. per cu.ft. The 
amount of lime-fly ash which could be used as an admixture at comparable material 
cost was found to be 3.5% lime and 7% fly ash by weight of aggregate. The 2 : 1 







ratio of fly ash to lime was decided upon from consideration of work done else¬ 
where A second test series using reduced amounts of cement and lime-fly ash 
was used to attempt to obtain some picture of the effect on strength of the amounts 
of admixture used. 

Lime-fly ash rather than lime was investigated because previous 
authors (^» ■*■•*•) have reported that sandy soils are not too responsive to treatment 
with lime alone. The fact that fly ash also brings about a pozzolanic action with 
lime was thought to be a worthwhile reason for using it even though the extent of 
this pozzolanic action would not be too apparent after the necessarily short curing 
periods used in the investigation. 

Pulverized quicklime was chosen for use rather than a hydrated 
lime product because there is nearly 25% more active calcium oxide in the quick¬ 
lime . Bulk quicklime is also slightly cheaper than bagged hydrate on a unit 
weight basis. These savings brought about by the use of quicklime are offset 
slightly by the fact that the handling costs of quicklime are higher than for hydrated 
lime because of the precautions taken in handling it. 

In an attempt to obtain close control over the uniformity of grading 
of the gravel in each specimen tested, so that strength results would be compar¬ 
able, the native gravel was split into five size ranges and then recombined in the 
desired percentages to make up 200-pound batches ready for the preparation of 
the test specimen. 

The usual curing period of Normal Portland cement stabilized 
specimens is seven days, but because of the lack of sufficient 12 in. diameter 
by 24 in. molds and to achieve the necessary economies in time, the curing period 


. 









j • 








was reduced to 24 hours. However, High Early Strength Portland cement was em¬ 
ployed rather than Normal Portland as it was felt that the one-day strength of 
material treated with this type of cement would be close to, but slightly less than, 
the seven-day strength of the same material treated with a Normal Portland 
cement conforming to the A. S. T. M. specifications. 

In all, thirty-two triaxial tests were performed and over 6,000 lbs. 
of processed gravel were required for the investigation.

CHAPTER II 

CLASSIFICATION, IDENTIFICATION AND ANALYSES OF 
MATERIALS INVESTIGATED 

Gravel The source of the gravel used in the investigation was the Crawford 

Pit (SW 33-36-20-4) near Stettler, Alberta. From visual examination the material 
could be described as a ’’dirty gravel" and gradation and plasticity tests show that 
the material corresponds to the GF soil group of the Casagrande Airfield Classifi¬ 
cation System 

Table 1 shows the results of the sieve and plasticity tests performed 
on samples taken throughout the pit area. Figure 1 shows the average gradation 
of the material tested and the grading curve followed in the investigations as well 
as the applicable limits of the American Association of State Highway Officials 
grading specifications. 

Table 11 shows the effects of the admixtures on the plasticity char¬ 
acteristics of the Crawford fines used in the strength investigations. In all the 
plasticity tests shown, the fines were allowed to soak 24 hours at a moisture content 
near the plastic limit. The figures 3, 7 and 24 hours shown in the Table indicate 
additional soaking time after the additive was mixed with the fines. 

The sieve and hydrometer data sheets and the Atterberg limit data 
sheets which form the basis for Table 1, Figure 1, and Table 11 are contained in 
Appendix A. Excerpts from the A.A.S.H.O. specifications are also given in 


that section.

The specific gravities of the coarse and fine fractions of the 
Crawford gravel used in the triaxial shear experiments were as follows: 

(see Appendix A for test data) 

Specific gravity of +#4 material = 2.67 
Specific gravity of - #4 material = 2.69 

In the combination of 60% coarse, 40% fine, the average specific gravity of the 
mixture would be 2.68. The data for the foregoing tests axe shown in Appendix B 
and the results were used in plotting zero air voids curves in the compaction tests 
as well as in computing approximate figures for the degree of saturation in the 


triaxial tests.

The results of the compaction test series which were run are 
shown in Table 111. Modified Proctor and one-half Standard Proctor tests were 
performed using the various admixtures (data sheets in Appendix A) and the 
desired molding water contents of the triaxial specimens were based upon the 
optimum moisture contents obtained in the two tests. The figures arrived at for 
the desired molding moisture contents of the triaxial specimens are thus nothing 
more than ’’guesstimates" of the true optimums because although the same com- 
pactive effort per unit of compacted volume was employed in preparing the triaxial 
specimens as would be employed in one-half Standard Proctor tests, the ratio 
of specimen diameter to specimen height was different, the ratio of specimen 
diameter to ma xim um particle size was different, the compaction hammers were 


different, i.e.

and the compaction technique employed was different in that for a Proctor test 
a constant number of blows is given to each layer but for the compacted triaxial 
specimens the number of blows increased with each layer from 44 to 68 in an 
effort to get uniform densities in the seven layers used. 

In spite of these differences, it was felt that the approximate method 
used for determining the molding water content for the triaxial specimens was 
adequate for the purposes of the investigation, i.e. not to find absolute values of 
maximum strength, but to compare strengths under equal conditions other than 
admixture. 


Appendix A contains sample calculations pertaining to the estimate 
of desired molding water content for the triaxial specimens for one of the test 
series carried out. 


Cement The High Early Strength Portland Cement used in the investigation 

was a local product and the chemical and physical analyses of a representative 
sample of the material as performed by the producer are shown in Table IV.

The relative effectiveness of a lime in stabilizing a material varies 
with the oxide content capable of reacting with the soil material and hence the lime 
requirement for quicklime stabilization is lower than for stabilization with a hydrated 
lime because of the high percentage of calcium oxide contained in quicklime. 

Fly Ash The fly ash used in the lime-fly ash investigations has the physical 

and chemical properties shown in Table VI. The results shown were obtained from 


the chief user of this particular fly adi.

CHAPTER HI 

APPARATUS AND PROCEDURES FOR TRIAXIAL TESTS 

Apparatus Shown on Plates I, U and III in Appendix B are the detailed plans 
for the special equipment constructed for use in the vacuum triaxial testing of 
12 in. diameter by 24 in. high specimens. Included at the close of Chapter III 
are pictures of the equipment and some phases of the triaxial tests carried 
out. 

The following is a list of equipment used in conjunction with the 
vacuum triaxial testing program. 

(1) A Fairbanks Morse 4,000 lb. capacity mechanical compression 
testing machine was used for vacuum triaxial tests 1 to 9. 

(2) A Tinius Olsen 30,000 Kgm. capacity hydraulic compression 
testing machine was used for tests 10 to 32. Special extensions for the uprights 
were required to accommodate the height of the test specimens. 

(3) A stable steel compaction table of approximately the same height 
as the bed of the Tinius Olsen machine facilitated the movement of the compacted 
test specimen (approximate weight, 275 lbs.) into the Tinius Olsen machine for 
test. 

(4) A vacuum source including a reservoir and a supply of air lines 
with quick coupling connectors. The vacuum source used was a single stage 
vacuum pump capable of exhausting nearly a full atmosphere. 

(5) A mixer of 3-1/2 cu.ft. capacity was employed. This mixer was 








\ / 






- -.-'.U.-.'-.v,. 






16 


of the tilting drum, end discharge type and rotated at 24 revolutions per minute. 
Mixing was done in all cases at a tilt as severe (flat) as possible without dis¬ 
charge of material during mixing. 

(6) The triaxial specimen molding and testing equipment, i.e. rubber 

lined split mold, top plate, bottom plate, compaction guide sleeve, compaction 
hammer (Marshall hammer with 12 ins. added to fall), 1,000-lb. capacity weigh 
scale, 100-lb. capacity scale, rectangular metal box large enough to transport 
mixed sample, rubber strips for attaching membrane to plates, strain dial of 1 in. 
travel in 0.001 in. increments, and a 20 Kg. scale and pans for moisture content 
determinations. 

Procedure The procedures followed in the various triaxial tests were as 
follows: 

(1) In triaxial test #1 a compactLve effort of 55 blows on each of 6 lifts 
delivered by a Modified Proctor hammer was employed. The dry density resulting 
from this compactive effort was deemed to be too low and the compact!ve effort 

in future tests was increased. The number of lifts was increased to 7 and the 
number of blows per lift increased to an average of 56 (44 on the first, 48 on the 
second, etc. and 68 on the seventh). The compaction hammer was also altered. 
Instead of 10 lbs. falling 18 in. on a 2 in. diameter face, the hammer was modified 
to 10 lbs. falling 30 ins. on a 3-7/8 in. diameter face. The larger face was em¬ 
ployed because it was found that it did not degrade the gravel to the extent that 
the 2 in. diameter hammer face did. 

(2) In triaxial tests #2 to #31 the following procedures were used: 

(a) The native gravel was split into 5 size ranges (3 in. to 3/4 in., 3/4 in. 
to #4, #4 to #10, #10 to #40, and minus #40). A certain fraction of crushed

oversize was included in each size range but by far the largest number of 
crushed particles were in the 3 in. to 3/4 in. range. Over 6,000 lbs. of 
raw gravel were processed in this fashion to supply material for the test 
program. 

(b) The 200-lb. batches of air dry gravel that were made up for triaxial 
specimen molding had the following composition (in accordance with 
desired grain size curve): 


-3 in. + 3/4 in. 

54 lbs. 

-3/4 in. + #4

-#4 +#10

-#40 

28 lbs. 


200 lbs. 


(c) The hygroscopic moisture content of a representative sample of the 
minus #4 sieve size material was obtained for aid in determining the 
quantity of water to be added at the mixer to arrive at the moisture content 
desired in the compacted specimen. 

(d) The required weight of admixture and water were weighed out separ¬ 
ately and the gravel and admixture introduced into the mixer. 

(e) The mixer drum was lowered from the charge position to the mixing 
position and the mixer was started. 

(f) The water was then added over a 10-second interval and the material 
was allowed to mix for a 3-minute period before discharging into a metal 
box. 

(g) The sample was then remixed in the box by shovel and then the box 


and sample were weighed.

(h) Before the sample was mixed, the membrane was attached to the base 
plate. The mold was then placed carefully about both and tightened. The 
rubber membrane was then brought up and stretched over the top of the 
mold and a vacuum of 0.3 atmospheres applied between the membrane and 
the mold to effect a smooth, tight fit of the membrane to the interior of 
the rubber-lined mold. The mold now rested on the base plate which 
rested on the compaction table and all was in readiness for the start of 
compaction. 

(i) The specimen was then compacted in the mold in seven equal layers. 

44 blows were used on the first layer with the number increasing 4 per 
layer so that there were 68 blows used on the seventh layer. Seven was 
the maximum number of layers possible with 3 in. maximum sized 
particles in a 24 in. high specimen. The compaction hammer used was a 
Marshall Compaction Hammer with the fall increased from 18 to 30 inches. 
Before compacting the last layer, the guide sleeve was fitted onto the mold 
to allow initial compaction of the seventh layer and to prevent, as far as 
possible, damage to the membrane. After one-half of the blows were 
given to the seventh layer, the guide sleeve was removed so that close 
attention could be given to the last half of the blows so that the resultant 
surface was relatively flat and in otherwise good shape to receive the top 
plate. 

(j) The top plate was lowered into position and the membrane was drawn 
up and over this plate. A rubber strip was used to tie it to the plate and 
a special groove cut into the plate assisted in this fastening process.

(1<) The remainder of the sample and the box were weighed to determine 
the weight of moist material used in preparing the specimen. 

(l) In the case of the triaxial tests on the native gravel ( tests ^ t0 8, 13,14,18) 
there was no curing period necessary so preparations for the triaxial test 
began immediately after molding, hi one test series using 3.5% quicklime, 

7% fly ash ( tests #20,21,22) ^ one test ser i es using 2% quicklime and 

4% fly ash ( tests #24,25,26) no curin g p er i oc | was used in order to see what 

immediate effects the admixtures had on the strength of the composition. 

For the 5% H.E. cement test series ( tests ^ to *2, 15 to 17,19,32) anc j 

also for the 2% H.E. cement series ( tests #29,30,31) ^ CU ring 

periods were used. For three separate triaxial tests using the lime-fly ash 
admixtures (tests #23,27,28) curing periods of one week were used to get 
some idea of how great the pozzolanic strength had become in this short 
a period. 

(m) When the specimen was ready to be tested, the desired vacuum (0.3, 

0.6 or 0.9 atmospheres) was obtained in the reservoir with the vacuum pump 
and the leads from the reservoir were attached to the top and bottom plates. 
With the specimen evacuated to the desired negative pressure, the mold 
was stripped carefully from around the specimen. Leaks in the membrane 
were located and repaired with small patches of membrane rubber and 
special rubber cement. 

(n) When the desired vacuum could be held constant on the specimen, the 
specimen was manoeuvered from the compaction table onto the bed of the 





::

I;:;.-.: o 





20 


testing machine where it was centered. 

(o) The strain dial was adjusted and the zero reading obtained. The length 
of the specimen was measured at 90 degree intervals and averaged. The 
hydraulic Tinius Olsen machine was turned on. The bed of the machine 
was ’'floated" and the machine zeroed at the range desired for testing. 

The self-leveling loading head was then brought into contact with the 
specimen and the test was started. 

(p) The tests were of the constant stress type, in that it was attempted to 
load the specimens to failure in 20 minutes at a constant rate of stress. 

(5% of the total load would thus be applied each minute.) This could be 
accomplished with the mechanical testing machine but was much more 
difficult to manage with the hydraulic machine. Bibliographical source 14 
points out that small changes in loading rates have no significant effect on 
results in triaxial tests on granular materials. 

(q) The tests were continued until failure of the specimens. Failure was 
evidenced by increased sounds of distress from the specimen and a rapid 
increase in the rate of strain at the same or slightly reduced load. Slight 
bulging about the central portions of the specimen was all that could be 
seen after the specimen was removed from the machine and the membrane 
was peeled down. Failed samples stood erect without benefit of vacuum 
with no evidence of slumping. 

(r) About 50 lbs. of moist material from each specimen was used for a 
moisture content determination of the tested material and the remainder 


of the specimen was discarded. 





2 ) 



21 


(s) This procedure was repeated for all tests with only one variation. 

In several tests the seventh layer was too low or too irregular for the 
proper placement of the top plate. In these few cases a cushion of fines 
was used to properly seat the plate. This weight of fines was included 
in the weight of specimen. 

3. Triaxial test #32 was an unconfined test on a 5% High Early Strength cement 
and Crawford gravel composition. A membrane was employed but the specimen 
was tested without benefit of vacuum.

CHAPTER IV 

TRIAXIAL TESTING PROGRAM RESULTS 

The results of all vacuum triaxial tests are shown in tabular form 
in the following tables (Tables VILA, VIIB, VIIC) depending on admixture. The 
data sheets for all triaxial tests are included in Appendix B. The results of the 
test program, with the exception of test #1 which employed a different compaction 
technique, have been presented in other forms as well. Stress-strain character¬ 
istics of the various mixtures tested are compared with those of the native gravel 
in Figures 2A, 2B, 2C and 2D. A comparison of stress-strain characteristics of 
all compositions at one restraining pressure is shown in Figure 3. Mohr circles 
for some of the various triaxial tests at failure are shown in Figures 4A, 4B, 4C, 
and 4D, and a graphical summary of the rupture lines thus obtained for each test 
series is shown in Figure 5. A plat of deviator stress at failure versus test 
lateral restraining pressure (Figure 6) for the various test series is also shown. 
Figure 7 is a plasticity chart which shows the results of plasticity tests run on 
the Crawford gravel fines with and without admixtures. The data sheets for 
these plasticity tests are included in Appendix A.

CHAPTER V 

DISCUSSION, CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 

DISCUSSION 

The results obtained in this investigation indicate that the particular 
admixtures used with the Crawford gravel definitely improve the strength, worka¬ 
bility and plasticity characteristics of this gravel. These results are best illus¬ 
trated by Figures 5, 6 and 7. The addition of 5% High Early Strength Portland 
cement results in one-day compressive strengths which are approximately three 
times greater than the strength of the native material throughout the range of 
lateral pressures investigated. This can be best seen from study of Figure 6. 

The effects of the 2% cement admixture after one-day cure are similar in nature 
but of smaller magnitude. The increase in strength with this admixture was about 
twofold over the confining pressure range of the test carried out. The effects of 
the various admixtures on the strain of the compositions under test was pronounced. 
The strains at failure were much lower for the specimens containing admixtures 
and the effect was the greatest for the 5% cement series when typical strains at 
failure were approximately 1/4 of those obtained in tests on the native gravel. 

This is illustrated in Figure 3. 

The admixtures of 3.5% quicklime and 7% fly ash and of 2% quicklime 
and 4% fly ash resulted in compressive strengths right after molding of approxi¬ 
mately one and one-half times the magnitude of those obtained for the native 
gravel over the lateral pressure range investigated. This illustrates the im¬ 
mediate benefits of this admixture. After curing one week, specimens made up

with these admixtures resulted in compressive strengths similar to those found 
for the 2% cement admixture tested at one day, (i.e. nearly twice the compressive 
strength of the natural gravel). This shows a considerable increase in strength 
after a short curing period. 

Of the nine triaxial tests run on 5% cement mixtures, considerable 
scattering of results was obtained for those tests run at the same restraining 
pressure. With no checks available, the average value for the test results at 
each confining pressure in this series was employed. This scatter of results in 
the 5% cement series was not a result of the type of strength test employed (vacuum 
triaxial) because in the ten tests on native gravel, check tests were obtained over 
the pressure range used with a negligible degree of scatter. 

It would appear then that the large-scale triaxial method is an 
excellent method of evaluating unstabilized gravel strengths and that the test is 
quite sensitive to the increased number of variables present when admixtures are 
included with the gravel. No doubt small differences in moisture content of the 
specimens, while not appreciably affecting strength results of tests run on the 
native gravel, would account for some of the discrepancies obtained in the check 
tests performed on the 5% cement specimens. The deviations in strength results 
which occur in tests of concrete cylinders made from the same mix or for that 
matter from the same batch help to explain this scatter. 

The results obtained indicate that this gravel treated with any of 
the particular admixtures investigated would be more effective than natural material 
in supporting and distributing load over the subgrade of a roadway. The 5% High 
Early cement admixture tested at one day showed the highest degree of improvement

and these results could be considered as being indicative of those one might obtain 
by using a Normal Portland cement corresponding to A.S.T.M. specifications rather 
than High Early cement and testing the composition at one week instead of at one 
day. This one week curing period would generally duplicate the length of cure al¬ 
lowed a cement-treated base in the field before traffic uses it. 

Using Normal Portland cement from the same manufacturer as the 
High Early cement used in the triaxial tests would normally result in higher strength 
values at one week than for the High Early at one day, i.e.

From Figures 2A, B, C and D moduli of deformation (slope of stress- 
strain curves) were computed for the initial parts of the curves or in the upper, 
relatively straight portion of curves which exhibited reverse bends. 

These moduli of deformation were generally found to increase with 
the restraining pressure used in each test series. Typical values obtained for 
the various mixtures at the highest and lowest restraining pressures used for 
each test series were:

These values are quite rough indications of how the various mixtures 
improve the stress-strain qualities of the original gravel. A deformation modulus 
higher in value than that for the original gravel indicates the degree to which the 
admixture has improved the native material in terms of a higher failure stress at 
reduced strain. Perhaps it is somewhat more obvious from these figures than a 
visual inspection of Figures 2A, B, C and D, that the 5% cement admixture created 
the largest improvement. 

Table II and Figure 7 show the beneficial effects of the admixtures 
upon the plasticity of the fines contained in the Crawford gravel and illustrate that 
the effects produced by cement and by lime-fly ash admixtures are somewhat dif¬ 
ferent but that both admixtures materially reduce the Plasticity Index of the fine 
material. The actual reduction in P.I. was found to be dependent on the soil type, 
the quantity of admixture and the length of storage before test. This agrees with 
observations made by other investigators ^ 3 

The slopes of the various rupture lines found by drawing best fit 
lines (straight or curved) in Figures 4A, B, C and D and summarized in Figure 5 
indicate that: 

(a) the strength benefits, immediately after molding, brought about by lime-fly ash 
admixtures are not so much of increasing the rupture line slope but of raising its 
starting point (i.e. increased unconfined strength), 

(b) the strength benefits derived from lime-fly ash admixtures are apparently only 
partially dependent upon quantity for the initial strength increase but that increases 
in strength with time are dependent on the quantity of admixture present, 

(c) the effects of lime-fly ash improvements follow a more straight line relation¬ 
ship than the cement-treated specimens. The effects of the cement seem to taper

off at higher confining pressures (i.e. the rupture line flattens out and apparently 
approaches the slope of the rupture line of the native material). 

The gravel batches which were treated with admixtures were much 
more easily handled by shovel than those batches mixed up for test without benefit 
of admixture. Since these gravel-admixture batches were at higher moisture 
contents than the native gravel which was tested, it shows the effect of the ad¬ 
mixture in reducing the plasticity of the fines. This ’’fluffing up” or aggregation 
of the material was greatest in the lime-fly ash admixture compositions and they 
were the easiest to handle in preparing the specimens for test. 

CONCLUSIONS 

The following conclusions can be drawn from the results obtained 
from the testing program. 

(1) All of the particular admixtures investigated were found to improve 
the strength and plasticity characteristics of this particular gravel compacted and 
cured in a particular manner. (The treated gravel would be superior to the native 
gravel in sustaining load, resisting deflection and distributing load to the subgrade.) 
Under field conditions, however, weathering action over prolonged periods could 
possibly result in reductions to these benefits. 

(2) Since the High Early Strength Portland cement used in this investi¬ 
gation led to higher strengths after one-day cure than the 3.5% quicklime - 7% 
fly ash specimens tested at one week at corresponding lateral pressures, it is 
evident that this admixture shows promise for future use with Crawford gravel or 
gravels of this same type when only a short period, say 24 hours, of curing is 
possible for the treated base before traffic must use it. 

(3) Further, it can be concluded, since the seven-day compressive 
strength tests on Normal Portland cement are higher than the one-day compressive

strength tests on the High Early Strength cement from the same supplier, that the 
use of this Normal Portland cement as an admixture would lead to generally higher 
results at one week than those obtained with High Early Strength cement at one day. 
Hence on an equal material cost basis, it is indicated that Normal Portland cement 
would achieve much greater strength benefits than the lime-fly ash admixtures when 
using the seven-day strength of the compositions as a criterion. It is estimated that 
the total cost of treatment with 5% Normal Portland cement would be somewhat in 
excess of $1.50 per cu.yd. (compacted) over and above the cost of construction with 
untreated material. The $1.50 figure mentioned above represents material cost only 
and the extra cost involved would depend upon admixture shipment costs and the dif¬ 
ference in mixing costs between the two construction techniques. 

(4) It must be concluded from such erratic strength results as were 
obtained in the cement test series, notwithstanding the high degree of batching 
control possible in the laboratory, that a higher percentage of cement will have to 
be added in the field to assure the same average results which are obtainable in 
the laboratory. The quantity of extra cement required would depend on the uni¬ 
formity of the gravel being treated, the type of mixing equipment available, weather 
and construction methods, and the degree of control exerted in the construction 
operations. 

(5) Minor variations in the moisture content of native gravel have little, 
if any, effect on the strength obtained by vacuum triaxial means at the same con¬ 
fining pressure. These variations in moisture content of specimens which include 
admixtures,as well as the length of damp mixing time before compaction, do cause 
scatter in the results obtained for tests at the same confining pressure. This 


effect was most noticeable for the 5% cement series as five check tests were run

in this series without duplicating any of the strengths obtained previously at the 
three confining pressures employed. 

(6) There is a definite build up in strength of lime-fly ash and gravel 
specimens with storage but this pozzolanic action was not checked at long enough 
intervals in this investigation to predict how fast or how far this strength does 
increase. It is indicated that the degree of strength build-up is dependent on the 
quantity of admixture used. 

(7) Without definite strength criteria for base materials established for 
use with large scale apparatus, it is not possible to say whether the 5% Portland 
cement admixture is sufficient to place the poor quality Crawford gravel into the 
category of a suitable subbase or base material, even with a threefold or more 
strength gain over the strength of the native material. Because of these strength 
increases, and since this admixture reduced the plasticity index of the gravel to an 
acceptable figure, it is the author f s opinion that, barring deleterious time effects, the 
treated gravels would perform most satisfactorily. A test section could substan¬ 
tiate or disprove this theory. 

(8) When compared to tests on the Crawford gravel fines, the effects 
of the admixtures on the optimum moisture content and maximum day density of 

the Modified Proctor compaction tests carried out were: 

(a) to decrease the optimum moisture content and increase the maximum 
dry density of cement-treated samples, 

(b) to increase the optimum moisture content and decrease the maximum 
dry density of lime-fly ash treated samples. 

These results generally agree with results obtained by other investigations^’ 

In compacting the large triaxial specimens (1/2 Standard Proctor compactive effort) 

it was found that the lime-fly ash specimens had densities slightly in excess of

those obtained for the native gravel, and that the densities of the cement-treated 
gravel were higher than either. 

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH 

(1) It is recommended that a set of rupture lines for materials consid¬ 
ered as excellent subbase, base and surface course aggregate be obtained with this 
large scale vacuum triaxial equipment. Hence, criteria would be available with 
which to compare the results of tests on stabilized gravels. In this way it would be 
seen which sub-marginal gravels can be economically treated so that they would be 
useable in their stabilized condition. 

(2) If a great number of these large scale triaxial tests were to be under¬ 
taken, then it is advisable that a different method of compaction be devised. Possibly 
a larger version of the vibrating-spring load compactor as used elsewhere 

would be best suited to this purpose. 

(3) The effects of longer curing periods coupled with those of weathering 
upon the permanency of the strength and plasticity benefits to the gravel resulting 
from the use of these admixtures could be investigated. A more complete investi¬ 
gation of admixture types and quantities for adequate reduction of plasticity is warranted. 

(4) Work done by Wright and Roy( 8 ) indicates that, depending on soil 
type, approximately 15 to 25% of the cement ordinarily used for cement stabiliza¬ 
tion may be replaced by fly ash without serious loss of strength. This represents 
a considerable saving in the cost of stabilization and might well be investigated 

in the case of submarginal gravels. 

(5) Work could be carried out with this same gravel, keeping the same 
ratio of maximum sized particle to specimen diameter, with a smaller vacuum 
triaxial apparatus (say 5.6 in. diameter) in an attempt to determine quantitatively 
the effect of the larger sizes on strength.

ADMIXTURE QUANTITIES 


45 


It was thought that one of the better ways to compare admixtures 
was to compute percentages of each that would result in the same material cost. 
The admixture then giving the greater strength increase would be the better. 

Since it was decided that 5% cement was the maximum quantity 
that might be economically incorporated in a mixture, it was then necessary to 
find a combination of quicklime and fly ash which would result in the same cost. 

Using local prices, the following analysis was carried out: 

Bulk Normal Portland Cement (cost/lb.) = 0.889 cents, 

Bulk Pulverized Quicklime (cost/lb.) =1.1 cents, 

Fly Ash (cost/lb.) =0.10 cents. 

Now using a figure of 125 lbs./cu.ft. as the compacted dry density 
of the cement stabilized gravel and considering a compacted thickness of 6 ins. of 
subbase, the cost of cement (material only) would be : 

4.5 x 125 x 5 x 0.889 = $ .25 per sq.yd. 

100 

The quantity of quicklime and fly ash was then found in the following manner. The 
dry density of the compacted lime-fly ash, aggregate composition was assumed to 
be 120 lbs/cu.ft. It was further decided that a 2 : 1 ratio by weight of fly ash to 
quicklime would be employed. 

Let x = desired % of quicklime, 

then (4.5 x 120 x_x_) l.l + (2x_ 4.5 x 120) 0.1 = 25 
100 100 

Solving, we find that the required amount of quicklime = 3.5% by 
weight of dry aggregate and the fly ash required is then 7.0%. A 3.5% quicklime - 
7.0% fly ash mixture would result in the same material cost as 5% Normal Portland 


cement.

SPECIMEN MOLDING MOISTURE CONTENTS 


From Table HI, which shows the results of four test series, the 
following approximate values of molding water contents for triaxial specimen 
molding were extrapolated. 

(a) To obtain the optimum moisture content value for 1/2 Standard 

Proctor compaction on the -#4 material alone, the same percentage 

difference between the optimum moisture content for Modified and 

1/2 Standard for the fines and 5% cement was applied to the optimum 

value found in the Modified test on the fines alone. 

i.e. Moisture Content = 12.0 x 9 = 12.3% 

8.8 

(b) S im ilarly the desired moisture content for Modified Proctor com¬ 
paction on the 3.5% quicklime, 7% fly ash mix would be 8.8 x 15.8 = 11.6% 

12.0 

(c) The desired moisture contents for 1/2 Std. compaction when employ¬ 
ing 2% cement or 2% quicklime, 4% fly ash then was found in a similar 
manner.

Now in planning on how much water to add to a 200-lb. batch of 
gravel containing 80 lbs. of -#4 material and 120 lbs. of +#4 material so that the 
fines would have approximately the desired moisture content for the triaxial test 
series being run, this was the procedure followed. 

With the 5% cement test series, for example, 12% moisture is 
desired in the fines during molding. The fines consist of 80 lbs. of Crawford 
gravel fines and 10 lbs. of H.E. cement. 

The water required for addition to the fines is then . 12 x 90 = 10.8 lbs. 

Allowing 1.2 lbs. (1%) for absorption and surface water in the coarse 
material gives a total of 12.0 lbs. of water or 5.71% by total weight of aggregate 
and cement. 

Maximum compressive strength, however, does not usually occur 
at the optimum moisture content for maximum dry density but at a molding moisture 
content slightly less than this valued. From Figure 2 of bibliographical source 1 
the moisture content at maximum compressive strength is approximately 95% of 
that for maximum dry density. This figure when applied to the optimum value 
found above changes the desired molding moisture content for the strength speci¬ 
mens from 5.71% to 5.42%. Actual moisture contents that were measured after 
test in the 5% cement series ranged from 4.87% to 5.86% and averaged 5.24% for 
the eight tests carried out with this additive.

DEGREE OF SATURATION AND INITIAL VOID RATIO 
FOR TYPICAL TEST SPECIMENS 


Native Gravel 
(Test #4) 

Initial Void Ratio = e = 1.0421 G 62.4 - 1 ( where G = specific gravity of mixture) 

121 

= 1.0421 (2.68) 62.4 - 1 
121 

= 0.439 

Degree of Saturation = S = 0.0421 (2.68) = 25% 

0.439 

These calculations were carried out for typical tests in the other test series run.
