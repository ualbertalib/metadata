CHAPTER I 

THE PURPOSE AND THE PROCEDURE OF THE INVESTIGATION 


I. The Purpose of the Investigation 

The purpose of this investigation is to determine 
by an analysis of the lowest 300 B group examination 
papers, the existing standards of mathematical achievement 
as found in the Grade IX Mathematics papers for June,1948. 
This investigation will be concerned with those 157 can¬ 
didates having a raw score of 40, and 143 of the candidates 
having a raw score of 41. These raw scores correspond to 
transmuted or percentage scores of 45 and 46 respectively. 

The problems which require solution in regards to 
this investigation are, namely: 

a. What do the students at this level know? 

b. What do the students at this level not know? 

o. Are definitions meaningful to the students? 

d. Do the students know proofs and constructions? 

e. Does the students’ work show any evidence of 

logical thought, or does their work 
reflect only memorization? 

f♦ Does the examination paper test the students’ 
powers to specialize and apply abstract 
theory to particular problems and 
situations? 

g. Does the examination pagper test the students* 

powers to generalize or theorize? 

h. Was the examination fair? 

To answer these questions the prescribed text¬ 
book, the examination booklet, and the 300 students*

mnswer papers were critically analyzed under the follow¬ 
ing main headings: 

a. Relationships 

b. Concepts or technical vocabulary 

c. Routines or techniques. 

II. The Examination Paper 

The Grade IX mathematics paper for 1948 consists of 
two sections, Section A and Section B. Section A contains 
40 multiple choice questions worth 2 marks each and arran¬ 
ged for machine scoring. Section B contains IS problems 
with a total raw score of 59 marks. These 13 questions 
are not machine scored, and a suitable place is provided for 
rough work and the correct answer. In all, the paper 
oonslsts of 53 questions, totalling 119 marks. 

III. Selection of the Data 

Nine thousand six hundred and forty four (9644) 
students, using the prescribed text ” Mathematics for 
Today” by Lazerte and Betz, wrote the Grade IX mathematics 
examination in Alberta schools in 1948. The marking, 
ranking, and division of scores into the various grades 
were done by the Department of Education prior to the 
commencement of this investigation. 

In order to select the raw data (the 500 exam¬ 
ination papers), it was necessary to obtain the indiv¬ 
idual score cards for all the Grade IX students, from 
the Dept, of Education. Examination of these cards showed 
that a raw score of 40 comprised the lower limit of the 
grade B mathematics students* All the score cards having 
a raw score of 40 (157), and 143 of the cards having raw 
scores of 41 were chosen to make up the 300 lowest grade B

raw scores* After obtaining the file number of each of these 
300 score oards, it was then possible to search out the 
Individual examination papers. These 300 papers comprised 
the raw data for this investigation. The distribution of 
these 300 scores is shown in Table I below.

IV. Range of Raw Scores 


The highest possible raw score was 119, and the 
actual range of raw scores was from a low of 10 to a high 
of 102. These two scores correspond to transmuted or 
percentage scores of 5 and 100 respectively. 

V. Distribution of Transmuted Scores 

The formation of the transmutation table was based 
on the distribution of raw scores as found in a random 
selection of 1000 papers taken from a variety of centers 
throughout the province, namely: villages and small towns, 
larger towns, Calgary, Edmonton, and various rural areas. 

A distribution table and a cumulative frequency table, based 
on the results of the 1000 mentioned papers were made. The 
Examinations Branch had previously determined what perdentage 
of students would be given H, A, B, C # D, and knowing these 
percentages, it was possible to divide the cumulative freq¬ 
uency table into the five separate standings. The Board 
had also decided what range of transmuted scores would be 
included in each of the five above groups.

A straight line graph was next constructed with the 
ordinate representing the range of raw scores from 0 to 
1!L(B, and the abscissa representing the range of transmuted 
scores from 0 to 100♦ With this graph it was then possible 
to find the transmuted score corresponding to any given 
raw score, and from this obtain a distribution of trans¬ 
muted scores for the province as a whole*

VII* Procedure 

Analysis of the raw data in this investigation was 
performed in four different steps: 

a. Analysis of the distribution of scores on the 
individual test items 

b* Analysis of the individual answers on each test 


item 

c* Analysis of the text-book and examination paper 
for relationships, concepts and routines 

d. Analysis of the main topics on the examination 


paper. 

Analysis of the distribution of scores on each in¬ 
dividual test item was developed by using tables and graphs to 
show the frequency of zero scores, partial scores, and 
perfect scores onesch of the 53 examination questions« 

Analysis of the individual answers on each test 
item was done question by question for each of the 300 
papers* The number and percentage of correct answers, no 
attempts, and other answers were expressed in tabular form, 
with a short discussion and interpretation of results 
fallowing each individual test question* 

Analysis of the text-book and the examination paper 
was performed under the three previously mentioned main heading 
relationships, concepts, and routines, definitions of each 
which will be found in Chapter V* 

In analysing the main topics of the examination, 
the questions were first divided into two main sections, 
Algebra and Geometry, and these in turn were subdivided 
into individual main topics for sub-analysis* Chapter 
VIII explains fully how the "mean total score" for the

analysis will "pin-point" the conclusions reached in former 
studies. Although some of these theses do not deal directly 
with the raw data of the grade IX mathematics examinations, 
they all have conclusions which bear directly on the work 
of the grade IX mathematics teacher. 

1. A Determination of Generalizations Basic to the 
Mathematics Curricula of the Intermediate and Senior High 

Schools of Canada? Part 3- Generalizations of Grade IX. by 

Gordon French- 1944. 

Mr. French made an analysis of all the grade IX 
mathematics texts used by the nine provinces of Canada, 
and he divided the obtained subject matter into three main 
groups: generalizations* language, and information. The 
writer found some difficulty in defining each of these terms, 
and in his introduction Mr. French states, "At the beginning 
of the study an attempt was made to define eaefcr of these 
three terms for the purpose of distinguishing them. However 
as the study progressed it became apparent that the simplest 
solution was that of classifying the concepts arbitrarily 
either as generalizations, language or information owing to 
the difficulty of border-line eases. For example, such 
terms as parallel lines, angle, perpendicular, were classified 
as language although each is as rich in ideas as many of the 
generalizations”. 

455 generalizations under 45 main headings were tabulated 
as those basic to the grade IX mathematics curricula of

Intermediat© and High Schools of Canada, and 547 terms were 
classified as language instead of generalizations* 

2* A Determination of Generalizations Basic to the 
Mathematics Curricula of the Intermediate and Senior High 

Schools of Canada: Part 4- Generalizations of Grade X* by 

Ottar Massing-1945* 

Mr* Massing conducted a survey similar to that of 
Mr. French, only his subject matter was concerned with the 
grade X mathematics course in the various provinces of 
Canada. He also classified the subject matter into general¬ 
izations and information and language* A total of 478 
generalizations under 43 main headings were tabulated as 
basic to the grade X mathematics courses of Canada, and 
608 language terms were classified, 198 being new terms and 
410 listed as terms which were found in earlier mathematics 
courses. ? 

3* A Report on Algebra 5 Papers of June 1938, by 
S»V* Hooper-1941* 

Although Algebra 3 bears little relationship to 
the grade IX mathematics, Mr* Hooper f s conclusions ©re well 
worth repeating. He states, "If the paper is considered a 
fair test of the principles involved in the course, certainly 
these results indicate a very serious ignorance of the 
principles underlying the course and a decided weakness in 
mathematical manipulation"* 

4* Graphs in General Mathematics, by H*S* Miller- 

1941* 

Mr. Miller made a survey of the abilities of 
various grades to understand and interpret graphical concepts* 
He gave three groups of tests over a period of time to various

groups of students from grade 7 to grade 12, and from the 
results he concludes that the problem of graohs has not 
been well handled in the Alberta school system, and also 
that the idea of negative numbers though very confusing to 
a great number of students, could much better be taught if 
it were related more closely to the concept of graphs* 

Miller’s concluding remarks were, "I believe that the 
results of the tests prove that the graphical concept is 
not well enough understood even by senior high school 
pupils. I believe that the topic should be treated more 
fully at one point in the high school course, possibly at 
the grade IX level." 

5. Student Attainment in the Algebra 2 Examination 
of 1944, by Velma Miller-1946. 

One of Miss Miller’s concluding statements bears 
directly on this thesis. She concludes,"This survey indicates 
a weak mathematical background for most students. Perhaps 
teachers of mathematics might take time to stress more of 
the fundamentals.---- The finding of so many mechanical 
errors would also indicate a need for insisting upon 
accuracy of details and for more drill upon fundamentals 
during earlier school years". 

6. Summaries of Investigations in the Mathematical 
Field, submitted by Dr. M.S. Lazerte to the Carnegie 

Corporation- May, 1956. 

A review of this thesis, with regards to the 
present investigation may best be presented by separate 
quotations from Dr. Lazerte’s summary. On page 5 Dr. 

Lazerte states," It would appear that pupils are not being 
trained in independent thinking. Faulty analysis, or a

complete absence of analysis, accounts for the largest 
single group of errors made. Pupils are not learning to 
grasp the relationship between the various factors entering 
into a given problem; in a great many instances they see 
no problem at all". On page 6 the report continues, " Pupils 
are very weak in the matter of ratios". 

On page 99, one reads, "This ability (to see 
relationships) which might perhaps be more accurately 
described as a composite of related abilities, is fundamental 
to mathematical thinking". On page 103 the writer continues, 
"The most difficult phase (of problem solving) is without 
a doubt the analysis of the problem with a view to dis¬ 
covering the relationships involved, and the statement of 
this relationship in an equation". 

On page 107 Dr. Lazerte concludes his investigation 
with the following statement, "This study has consistently 
indicated a great need for two changes: 

a. a transference of emphasis to functional 
thinking in mathematics 

b. more attention to graphical work through-out 
all phases of mathematics".

The following tables show for each question, the 

total possible raw score, the mean score obtained, and 

the relative mean score obtained (and expressed as a 

percentage). Example: For question 45, the total possible 

score is 2 marks. The mean score obtained is 155 z 0.45 

566 , 

marks (see table IX, page 12) out of a total possible of 

2 marks. The relative mean score obtained is 0.45 — 0.23 

§ 

or 23%. Thus, on question 45, students on the average 
obtained only 23% of the possible score.

CHAPTER IV 

analysis of the individual answers on each test item 

OF THE EXAMINATION PAPER 

As mentioned previously, the examination paper was 
divided into two sections, sections A and B. Section A 
of the paper contained questions 1-40 inclusive, and 
answers to these questions were recorded on separate answer 
sheets provided. Each of these first forty questions had 
5 suggested answers, only one of which was supposedly 
correct. The correct answer in each case was to he 
selected and recorded in the proper manner on the answer 
sheet, as shown in the sample on the front of the exam¬ 
ination booklet. 

Section B of the paper contained questions 41-53 
inclusive, and complete solutions for each of these 
questions were to he shown in the spaces provided in the 
booklet. The method of analysis was straight forward. 

One question at a time was considered. Each answer paper 
was studied carefully, and the various solutions recorded. 

The total number of students making each type of error was 
found, and this number was also listed as a percentage of 
the 300 students concerned with this Investigation. 

As well as listing the various errors found in the 
answers, the number and percent of students that had the 
correct answer, and that had made no attempt at answering 
the question were also recorded. Where only a few papers 
showed the same type of error, these were classified as 
miscellaneous errors. This procedure was followed for each 
of the 53 questions. 

One difficulty arises In frueh an analysis of answers- 

that is the problem of guessing. With 300 students

and a multiple ehoicd of 5 answers for each question in 
section A, the law of averages says that by chance alone, 
there could be 60 students with the correct answer, and 
60 students in each of the other four divisions of 
suggested answers. If it so happened that we found a 
problem answered such that the results were approximately 
evenly distributed as such, weuld we justified in saying 
definitely that at least 60 students knew how to solve the 
problem correctly? This very important factor must be kept 
in mind for the first 40 questions on the examination 
paper. We must not be too definite in our statements, 
regarding the standard of achievement, when results are 
based solely on multiple choice type questions, as in 
section A. Section B must also play a vital part in 
determining the standard of adhievement of these 500 
students.

The form of this question will be criticized in 
a later chapter, but the results themselves are disappoint¬ 
ing. Considering that this question is actually a review 
of grade 7 and 8 mathematics, it is sujprising that only 
55$ of these B standing students chose the correct answer. 

The law of averages states that chance alone can be re¬ 
sponsible for approximately 60 studefcts "placing” in each 

of the 5 categories of multiple choice. We may hazard a 

o 

guess and say that those 120 students choosing the suggested 
answers ”b” and ”©” had no more idea of the correct .answer 
than those students who chose the answers "a” and ”d”. 

This poor showing in the handling of decimals may 
be attributed to a lack of training in the basic fundamentals 
through-out public school, and especially to the laxity of 
many teachers in not stressing "rough approximations” as 
a check on the pupil’s mechanics.

Question 2 was quit© well done. 71% of these 300 
students obtained the correct answer, and only 1 person 
made no attempt to solve the problem. This one person 
evidently did not understand the concept of w complement" 
and the 18% that chose the answer as "a" confused the 
meaning of complement with supplement, and naturally 
marked the answer as a.(140 degrees.)

Question 3 was a review of grade 7 and 8 mathematics, 
and this time the students made a much better showing on 
their basic fundamentals with 87 % of ear 300 students 
chosing the correct answer. The incorrect answers can be 
attributed to guessing, rather than errors in calculation 
as we see that the 37 students who did attempt to answer 
the question, though incorrectly, are fairly well dis¬ 
tributed among the four remaining suggested answers.

Chose answer a. The area of the 

walls of a room is the length 
of the room multiplied by the 
width of the room. ill 37 

Chose answer b. The area of the 

four walls is the product of 

the perimeter of the room 

and its height, (correct) 22 7 

Chose answer c. The area of the 

four walls is the product of 

the length, width, and height. 65 22 

Chose answer d. The area of the 

four walls is four times the 

area of any one wall. 63 21 

Chose answer e. The area of the 

four walls of a room is the 
sum of its length and width 
multiplied by its height. 39 13 


Question 4 was the second most poorly d©ne of 
the 40 multiple choice questions. Only 7% chose the 
correct answer. This was a question designed to test 
the student’s ability to specialize and apply a some¬ 
what abstract theory to a concrete problem. The results 
prove that these 278 students with incorrect answers, are 
not able to apply theory learned in the classroom to 
practical out-of-school situations. 

Poor reading habits and inability to comprehend 
verbal problems may have been a deciding factor with 
many of the students.

Although this problem contains only one step beyond 
the Solution of easy equations" as found in the first part 
of the text-book, only 62% of the 300 students were able to 
cheese the correct answer* Had the problem asked to find 
tt N n , it is likely that a great number of students would 
have chosen the correct answer, but when these same students 
were asked to apply a little logical thought to a problem 
instead of memory learning, they were at a loss as to the 
correct procedure. This is borne out by the fact that 10 
persons made no attempt at all to find a solution. 

If the 46 persons choosing answer "a" got the 
answer "112" by blindly adding the only two numbers involved 
in the equation, we have further evidence that many students 
were completely lost as to the meaning of the question. 

This would also apply to those 45 students who chose answer 
"d" and presumably got the answer "32" by multiplying 16 
by 2, but without any logical justification for performing 
this operation.

It is surprising that only 19$ of the 300 B 
group students understood the basic relationship between 
the diameter of a circle and its area, or the radius of 
a circle and its area. ‘*here were 87 students, almost 
30$ of our group, that confused the formula for the area 
of a circle with the circumference of a circle and thus 
chose aiggested answer M a"; while almost 25% presumably 
knew the correct formula for finding the area of a circle, 
but carelessly chose the radius as 15 instead of 7.5. 

Those chosing answer presumably had am idea of the 
formula to be used but were either careless regarding the 
position of the parentheses, or else they did not under¬ 
stand the value of W pi w within the parentheses.

Chose answer e. 8/5 49 16 


Question 7 was poorly done. 43$ of the 300 
students found the right answer, and much of this per¬ 
centage may be attributed to lucky guessing on the part 
of the 129 students concerned* The surprising answers 
are "b" and "e". We may presume that the 95 students 
who chose answer "b" were somewhat confused with the 
axiom, "if equals be subtracted from equals, then the 
remainders are equal", and accordingly subtracted an 
equal quantity "1" from both numerator and denominator 
and got the result 4/7. Those 49 students chosing the 
answer 8/5 likely thought that inverting a fraction does 
not change its value. In these last two examples we see 
again, ample justification for believing that very few 
of these 300 students use any logical thought in solving 
their problems, and they are trying to apply only memory 
learning which is very obscure and inadequate to say the 
least. We are justified insaying that the seven students 
who did not answer the question at all had no concept 
whatsoever of the term "ratio".

Question 3 was one of the easiest problems on the 
examination paper* 78$ ohose the correct answer* The vast 
majority of the 300 students understood the meaning of 
n average" and were able to apply the routine of finding 
the average, to a particular problem* The group of 40 
students, had one of two reasons for chefsing answer "e". 
Either they confused the meaning of average with "sum" 
or else they summed the five numbers which is the first 
step in obtaining the average, but they then forgot to 
divided the sum by 5, the number of numbers being added* 
Those choesing answer "a" erroneously thought that the 
median of a group of numbers (the middle number to them) 
would be the average of the group* There is no logical 
justification for choosing answer "e", other than it 
being a guess on the part of the 5 students concerned*

Question 9 is a straight forward question 
involving the relationship between the area of a 
rectangle and its two sides, yet on&y 30$> of these 
students were able to chose the correct answer. The 
121 students choosing answer "a" either misread the 
question and thought only one side was increased 5 
times, or else they did not understand the functional 
reletion between the sides of a rectangle end its 
area. There is no mathematical logic as to why 13 persons 
would choose answer w e", and as for the 66 choosing 
answer w d”, they might have reasoned that a rectangle 
has four sides, and if each side is increased 5 times, 
then the new area would be 20x sq. in. This only goes 
to show again that the great majority of these 300 
students do not understand the basic relationship of the 
area of a rectangle to its sides.

Only 41% of these students were able to get 
question 11, which indicates some difficulty for the 
majority of students• The technical expression, 
"Satisfies the equation” appears absolutely meaningless 
to the 21 students who made no attempt to solve the 
problem, and this is astonishing when one realizes how 
often that phrase must have been repeated in the class¬ 
room through-out the year. It would be interesting to 
know just how many students who were classed as D 
students made no attempt to solve the problem above. 

The remaining 52% making errors appear well distributed 
among the four wrong answers. 

Had these students substituted their chosen value 
in the equation then solved for "a”, they would have 
known for sure whether their answer was right or wrong.

Question 12 was very well done* Those students 
choosing the wrong answer either misread the question 
as, "Which of the following equations IS necessarily

Question 18,a simple question, was well done. 
Answers other than the correct one were either due to 
guessing on the part of the students or extreme care¬ 
lessness in handling signed numbers. It is possible 
that the 6 students who chose answer "d" had the 
correct answer "-13", then made a mistake in scoring the 
answer sheet by marking /13 instead.

Only 1/3 of our 300 students chose the correct 
answer on this problem* With this particular question 
it was difficult to tell whether the wrong answers were 
due to incorrect reasoning or guessing. Answer "a" 
could be chosen if one reasoned^hat a pentagon is made 
up of only two triangles, each containing 180 degrees; 
but it is incredible that 120 of these B standing 
students- 40$ of the group, could reason in such a way 
especially if they first drew a rough sketch of the 
required figure. It is very likely that the 67$ who 
chose the incorrect answers did not understand the 
concept of pentagon, and guessed at the probable answer.

This question was very poorly answered, and 
reveals two major weaknesses: first, the student’s 
lack of understanding of similar triangles, and 
secondly, their weakness in handling problems dealing 
with ratio- a weakness previously revealed in question 7. 
There is only one justifiable reason why 64% of these 
students chose answer "a”. They easily found the ratio 
of AC to CB as 5/8, and they evidently noticed the 
difference between the numerator and denominator as 3. 

To them is was logical that D# to FE would then be 7/10, 
which also shows a difference of three, between the 
numerator and denominator. The fact that 64% of these 
300 B standing students reasoned in such a manner is 
protff that little logical thought entered into the 
solution of problems dealing with fractions and ratio.

Only 32% of these 

students were 

able 

to compute 


correctly the answer to this question, which means that 
68% do not understand either the rule of exponents for 
multiplication, which occupies two pages in the text, or 
they do not know how to handle eeefficients within 
parentheses. The 58 students choosing answer tt a M , and the 
21 students choesing answer n e n presumably understood the 
rule of exponents for multiplication, but they did not 
know how to handle signed numbers within parentheses. 

The 94 persons answering w b w understood neither the 
rule for multiplying exponents nor the squaring of signed 
numbers within parentheses. The 32 students choosing w d tt 
correctly expended the squaring of the signed number, but 
they did not understand the expansion of exponents for 
multiplication. All in all, we are lead to believe that 
signed numbers and exponents are either very poorly taught 
in grade IX, or else the calibre of some of our future 
university students is very low inregards to the fundamental 
operations in mathematics.

The 55 students answering w a n 

and "d" 

are very 


likely part of the 191 students who in question 15 
thought that if the difference between the numerator and 
the denominator of two fractions is the same, then the 
fractions must be equal* It was likely carelessness on 
the part of the 41 students answering w c w that they did 
not notice that the right hand side of the equation had 
to be reversed if it were to be the right answer, or 
else they did not understand the process of the L.C.D. 
in testing the equality of fractions.

Only 40$ at the ijost, Including those that guessed 
correctly, chose the right answer. This means that at 
least, 60% of the students did not understand the 
meaning of congruence. It, seems that the 129 students 
choosing answer "a* thought that as long as the three 
angles of one triangle were equal to the three angles of 
another triangle, irrespective of their not being 
corresponding angles, that the two triangles would be 
congruent. If they had realized that congruence implies 
equality of corresponding parts, then they would have 
had no difficulty in selecting the pair of congrumnt 
tv iangles.

Question 20 was one of th© most difficult of the 
40 questions in section A. The proper solution requited 
two steps; first changing feet per minute to feet per 
second, and secondly, changing feet per second to inches 
per second. It seems very difficult for these students 
to do a problem involving more than one step, and if two 
or more steps are involved, the majority of these 
students are not able to think that far ahead and arrive 
at the proper solution. One moment of logical thought 
would have told the students answering "a and b" that 
their solutions were absurd, yet almost 50% of the 300 
students in this investigation chose one of these two 
answers. l i'hose A answering "c" were on the right path, and 
got the first step, but they either forgot or did not re¬ 
alize that they were to change feet per second into 
inches per second, and they thus chose the answer 1/3.

Question 21: For which one of the following

Chose answer a. If I am sick, I do 

not go to school. 65 22 

Chose answer h. Triangles on the 

same base and bet¬ 
ween the same 

parallels are equal. 61 20 

Chose answer c. Triangles which 

have corresponding 
sides equal* have 
corresponding 

angles equal. 54 18 

Chose answer d. The angles at the 

base of an isosceles 
triangle are 

equal, (correct) 71 24 

Chose answer e. Angles which are 

vertically opposite 

are equal. 47 16 


The even distribution of answers makes us 
suspect that the great majority of students guessed 
at the chosen answer. The main reason for guessing 
being that the students were unable to formulate 
converses for each of the five givoi propositions. 

If no converse could be reasoned* then there was only 
one thing to do- guess. This question, like question 4, 
requires good verbal reasoning, and so far we ha$e seen 
that the majority of these 300 students are a long way from 
being able to reason verbally with any degree of logical 
thought.

Question 22 shows that the great majority of 
these students are not able to handle the techniques 

or tools taught in the mathematics course in grade IX. 

a 

This question is a stright application of a formula 
to a particular situation, yet, in the particular 
situation, these students are not able to apply the 
rules they learned in the class-room. Criticism of 
the form of this question will be left till a further 
chapter.

Care had to be taken in this question that the 
not true equation was selected, and this might have 
caused some reading difficulty for many of the students. 
If the students had known Theorem 8, they would have 
immediately realized that "a M was wrong- thus NOT true, 
and thus, the required answer. It is very likely that 
many errors were due to students forgetting to chose 
the incorrect equation. The 122 persons chasing w b M 
simply did not understand the meaning of corresponding 
angles.

This question is a case of applying abstract 
theory to a concrete situation* Results- only 36% of 
these students were able to chose the right answer* 

A 

The fact that there were 25 students who did not attempt 
the question reflects the complete inability of at least 
8 % of this group to egen understand the form of the 
problem. The scattered results in the first four 
suggested answers, is either indicative of much guessing 
or very poor computation on the part of 56% of the 
300 pupils concerned.

Here, as in question 1? we have evidence that 
the students cannot handle fractions properly, Aether 
it is addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division* 
The students in this investigation do not realize that 
the one satisfactory method of comparing fractions is 
to first reduce all the fractions to the lowest common 
denominator, then carry out comparisons*

Question 26 appears to be the hardest and is 
certainly the most poorly done of the multiple choice 
questions. As in question 15, we have a strifeght 
forward question involving similar triangles and 
ratio- actually a very simple question- yet 96% of 
these students are unable to see the relationship 
between two similar figures, and the absence of 
relationship with a third unlike figure* The students 
©re asked to pick out the equation which is not true, 
yet 94% of the students picked out the equations 
which were true. This could possibly be a result of 
poor reading ability on the part of quite a number of 
these students*

As in questions 16 and 19, so here we see a 
weakness on the part of almost 70% of these students 
in the handling of exponents* 62 students divided 
the exponents of the one known factor into the product 
to get the answer "c". At least these students were 
consistent- they divided both exponents of the one 
factor into the product* The inconsistency of 48 
students is that they divided by one of the exponents 
in the known factor, yet subtracted the other 
exponent in the very same factor* The strangest group 
is the group ©hoesing M e M . I'hey understood the operations 
of exponents, but for some unknown reason, subtracted 
the one known numerical coefficient from the product, 
instead of dividing it into the product.

know why 17% of these students chose "a". Answers

The fact that only 27% of these students had the 
right answer is indication that the topic of loci is no 
better understood, by this grade of students, than many 
of the other basic topics in the grade IX mathematics 
course. We may reasonably conclude that the 70% who 
did not get the correct answer, chose their answer 
mainly by guessing. Had they made a rough sketch of the 
problem, they could not help but see that the required 
answer was none but "b". These poor results is also proof 
that the majority of thestudents cnneerned cannot 

A 

visualize the problem they are trying to solve. They are 
using no logic in their thinking- they are depending on 
memory learning, which for them is very inaccurate to 
say the least. It would also be valuable to know,(but 
impossible to determine) how many students did not know 
the meaning of the word "locus" and thus guessed at one

As 

to be » 

exoected from previous 

questions, 

any 


test item dealing with fractions and ratio is bound 
to show very poor results. This question is the third 
lowest of the first forty questions in regard to the 
percentage of pupils having the correct answer. These 
results compare favorably with those of questions 15 
and 26 which also deal with ratio, *f the 117 persons 
marking "d and e* f had recognized the relationship 
between 3 and 8, they would have been immediately that 
the number they were looking for would have to be less 
than a whole number, and thus answers **d and# would be 
out of the question. But these students just do not 
realize that such rough estimations will often show the 
absurdity of many choices vwhi ch they might make. It 
is our duty as teachers to continually emphasize this 
one very important mathematical routine.

Question 31 was answered somewhat better than 
question 27 which also dealt with exponents, ^n all 
cases, the errors made can be classified under one of 
two main types- first errors in division of signed 
numbers, and secondly, errors in dividing by factors 
involving exponents. Both confirm previous statements 
that signed numbers and exponents are very poorly 
understood by the majority of students*

Only 50$ of these students can verbalize a formula, 
4% confused the formula for the volume of a cylinder with 
the formula for the area of the curved surface of a 
cylinder. This question, along with many others shows 
the inability of many of these 300 students to apply 
abstract or verbal reasoning to a particular problem^ 
with any degree of success.

Question 33 was the fourth most poorly answered 
questions of section A. This problem involves several 
steps: first the necessity of dropping a perpendicular 
from B to DE, and secondly being able to see that the 
line so constructed became the third side of a right- 
angled triangle, whose sides were in the ratio of 
3:4:5:. Lacking of insight into the relation of the 
Pythagorean theorem to the triangle newly formed was the 
main reason for only 13$ of these students being able to 
chose the correct answer. The 97 pupils choosing answer 
M b" presumably thought that the perpendicular so dropped 
completed the formation of a square whose side CE would 
then be the same size as the side BC. These people were 
making a false assumption based on no logical thought.

The proper solution of this problemrests on the 
ability of the students to remember the simple formula 
for the volume of a cube, then once realizing this 
formula, being able to calculate the cube root of the 
volume, or else substituting the suggested answers in the 
formula to see if the given volume were obtained. x t is 
a pure case of applying a simple routine to a previously 
learned concept. The results ^how that only a little 
over half of the students were able to do so. Certainly 
those making an incorrect choice of answers did not 
substitute their values in the formula, as a positive 
cheek on the answer, if they did, it is the strangest 
coincidence that their multiplication would give the 
correct volume of 512 cu. in.

Question 35 is a simple question involving percentage, 
yet the moment that a fraction enters into the calcul¬ 
ation of a problem, there is utter confusion.* 37% 
of these students ignored the percent sign and found 
i of 16 instead of | fo of 16* Answer "b" is either the 
result of carelessness, or weakness in handling decimals, 
but at least these students knew the correct procedure 
in using the % sign* The 25 students marking answers 
"d and e" had absolutely no idea of the meaning of 
else they would have seen that the answer could not 
possibly be larger than the number 16 itself*

Again we see that a question involving fraetinas, 
ratio, and percent is bou$d to make a poor showing. This 
problem is certainly no exception. The correct solution 
involves three steps: first, changing both fractions to a 
common denominator, secondly, finding the difference 
between the two fractions, and thirdly, expressing this 
difference as a percentage of 6/5. The insight required 
to see these three steps belongs to a very small percent 
of these 300 students, and this percentage would probably 
be reduced greatly, if the students making fortunate guesses 
were subtracted. 

The 114 students answering "b" misinterpreted the 
question. They did both step one and step two, and then 
expressed this fractional difference as a $ of 100, not 
of 6/5.

It is likely that the majority of students in 
our particular group knew the formula for the area of 
a circle, but when it cam© to applying this relationship 
to a particular problem, there were only 120 out of the 
300 students that had the correct answer. Actually, 
answers "a,b,d M are also correct, because the area of a 
sector of A circle does vary according to these three 
factors. Only when one stresses THE particular circle, 
is answer "d" the only truly correct answer. The 104 
persons answering with "c and had no idea of the 
relationship between the area of a sector of a circle and 
the area of a circle, else these two answers could not 
possibly have been chosen.

Again we see the small percentage of students 
getting the correct answer to a problem which involves 
fractional coefficients. 81# could not multiply through 

by 12 and clear the equation of fractions. 37# are ©Iso 
very inconsistent in that they multiply on© side of an 
equation properly, yet make a major blunder in multiplying 
on the other side of the equation. This is seen in the

for the remainder of the errors made.

Only 1/3 of these students chose the correct answer 
to a rather easy two-step problem. It is almost impossible 
to believe that 7 4 students would add the three given 
numbers, and take this sum as the area of the parallelogram, 
yet that is the only way that answer "d” could have been 
obtained, other than by guessing. 10% presumed that the 
area of a parallelogram is the sum of two adjacent sides, 
and proceeded to add inches to inches and in some manner 
got square inches in the answer.

The main reason for such poor results on a very 
simple question is that the majority of pupils just do 
not understand the fundamental operations of fraetiohs. 

It is almost impossible for them to correctly calculate 
the L.C.D. of several fractions. We may assume that it 
is mainly carelessness that made 35 students omit the 
"x M coefficient, although some of these likely did not 
realize the necessity of the literal coefficient in the 
answer. The 27 persons with answer Jx presumably mistook 
l/5x for l/6x, added it to 5/6x, subtracted J-x and got J-x.

Those students with the answer 16x correctly 
worked out the answer to the last step hut either 
forgot the denominator 30, or else they did not realize 
that it was part of the answer* Broadly speaking, this 
question reflects previous statements that problems 
involving fractions are usually quite poorly answered*

It is surprising that a question based on grade 
7 and 8 mathematics should be done correctly by only 
32% of the 300 grade IX pupils concerned with this 
investigation. The most frequent type of error was that 
of confusing the divisor with the dividend, and this 
fact eombinedwith the 40 students who made errors in 

A 

placing the decimal point, show just how weak these 
students are in their fundamental operations.

understandable that 14$ might make errors in the 
fundamental operations, but there should not be 12$ losing 
full marks for careless reading of the question, ^his

preparing students for any examination- the importance 
of reading correctly and doing what the question asks*

Question 44 involves a similar technique to that 
of question 42, yet here we see 75$ of these students 
getting the correct answer for question 44 and only 32$ 
getting the correct answer for question 42. The main 
source of error in this question was in the mechanics 
of multiplying and dividing. Only 5$ confused the 
divisor with the dividend in question 44.

Question 45 was poorly done# Only 67 persons 
had the correct answer, one person was given one mark, 
and 232 persons got zero marks# This quest inn also 
reveals the lack of basic fundamentals with regards 
polynomials# There were 58 students subtracting 
without first rearranging the subtrahend in descend¬ 
ing order. The fact that 30% lost full marks because 
they could not handle signed numbers correctly supports 
the statements made regarding questions 19 and 31, 
which also involve handling of signed numbers#

Question 46 appeared very difficult for the 
majority of these students. 65% made attempts which 
netted no marks at all, and an additional 16% were 
not able to attempt the problem at all. 

One might say that this question was somewhat unfair 
in that the students were faced with uneven division in 
the thiid division step. It is very unlikely that many 
of the grade IX students had been exposed to such a 
question, and when they were confronted with uneven 
division, it was beyond their ability to handle the 
reqtired operations. Evidence of this is seen in those 
34 students who had incomplete division. Other errors 
again reflect weakness in the use of signed numbers and 
polynomials.

Question 47 is one of the harder problems on the 
paper. Only 3 other questions have a higher percentage of 
no attempts than question 47. 37 persons were given only 

one mark, one was given two marks, and 180 people received 
zero marks. The one mark was given only if (P/§) were 
added correctly, and the other two marks were given if the 
su$ were correctly divided by R. The greatest number of 
errors was in the use of exponents. Almost all the 
errors here were due to the students adding the exponents 
as well as the numerical coefficients of the like terms. 
The other main group of^errors was the result of 
carelessness in the fundamental operations.

No partial marks were given for this question in 
which 67% received zero marks, and 8 percent made no 
attempt. The main errors were mechanical errors in the 
four fundamental operations, and also in removing of 
parentheses. From the results of previous questions it is 
not surprising to see 11% losing full marks because they 
cannot use signed numbers correctly.

Question 50 was a very good test item, 11 persons 
got one mark for collecting "like terms*} four persons &ot 
two marks for simplifying the like terms, no one got three 
marks, and 55 persons got full marks for the complete 
solution. Question 50 appears beyond the capacity of 
27%, who made no attempt to solve for the va&ue of L 
The process of transposing accounted for 18% of the 
errors, mechanical errors in the fundamental operations 
accounted for another 10%, and again the inability to use 
signed numbers properly penalized 5% of the group of 300,

This question was very poorly answered* Only one 
person got full marks (6 marks), twelve others received 
partial marks ranging from 2 marks to 5 marks* 53 others 
got the right diagram and correct construction and were 
given one mark each* No marks were given for the right 
diagram when the construction was not included* The 
118 persons with the right diagram, and wrong proofs had 
absolutely no idea of the necessary proofs* One such 
example will be seen on the following page. 78 students 
had the wrong diagrams, yet they tried, though unsnccessfully 
to prove that ABE and ACD areequal in area.

Sample 1 

This is a proof from one of the 118 students Who 
had the proper diagram, but had not stated the construction 
nor shown any insight whatsoever into the prooer solution 
of this problem. 

This sample proof is as exact a reproduction of 
the given proof as the writer could make. Nothing has 
been added or taken away from the original proof. 

DE// to BC 
AB Z AC 
DB Z EC 
AB Z EC 
AD = AE 

Therefore ABC and ACD are equal in area by (theorem 

SAS or //) 

There are several points that should be explained 
in this solution which might account for the person 
getting zero marks. Firstly, he does not even write down 
what is given, or required to be proven, and he does not 
state that he joined DC to (thereby losing one mark). 

Secondly, several false assumptions are made. 
assumes A 15 = AC, but he gives no proof for such assumption. 
He also assumes (falsely) that DB I EC, that AD = AE, and 
worst of all that AB » EC, 

Thirdly, he says that ABC and ACD are equal by 
"Theorme” (note spelling) SAS, yet he has not even mentioned 
a pair of angles in his entire proof. This is a typical 
sample of the 118 proofs,- proofs that reflect no idea of 
the proper solution.

Sample 2 

This is a proof given by one of the 78 students. 
Even though the diagram is entirely wrong, it is so 
surprising that these students can make-up a proof, which 
to them seems to be perfectly acceptable. 


Given 

Triangles ABC with D the 
midpoint of AB qnd E the mid¬ 
point of AC. 

Req. to Prove 


That ADE and EEC are equal 
in area. 

Construction 

From the point C draw a line CX. Then from the point 
E extend the line DE to a line CX meeting at the point F. 

AE equals EC because E is the midpoint of the line AC. 
Angle CEF equals angle AED because vertically opposite 
angles are equal. Angle DAE equals ang&e ECF because they 
are corresponding angles in congruent triangles. There¬ 
fore triangle ADE equals triangle EEC. 


/ 



Sample 2 above is typical of the 78 students that 
had the wrong diagram with resulting wrong proofs for 
question 51. The main difficulty with most of these 78 
students is that they are not able to read a problem 
eorrectly or to construct a diagram to fit the problem. 

The above solution has absolutely no relationship with the 
problem given on the examination paper.

Question 52 was the most poorly answered of all 
the questions on the examination paper, with not one 
person getting full marks. There were 260 students in 
this group with a zero score, 39 were given one mark 
each for having the correct diagram, one person got two 
marks, and no one got more than two marks out of a possible 
total of 6 marks. 71 persons were unable to attempt the 
question- they could not even draw the diagram. 

182 persons had wrong diagrams with resulting 
wrong proofs, a sample of which will be seen on the 
following page. 28 students were able to draw the 
correct diagram, but were able to give no construction or 
proof. 18 persons with the correct diagram attempted to 
prove the question asked, but their proofs reflect a com¬ 
plete absence of understanding and insight into the correct 
procedure and solution. Sample 4 is typieal of this group.

This student made one false assumption at the 
beginning of the problem. He assumed that the straight 
lines joining the opposite angles of a parallelogram 
were the biseetors of the angles of the parallelogram. 
Had this person read the question through properly, he 
would have seen that what was being proved wqs not what 
the question asked to be proved* The whole proof thus 
was meaningless*

Sample 4 

Sample 4 is a copy of one of the proofs given by one of 
the 18 students who were able to construct the correct 


diagram, but g8ve a proof that had absolutely no relation 


to the problem, 


Proof 


BC//AD 

AB//DC 


—Given 



angle CBA equals angle CDA — theorem 17B 
angle BAD equals angle DCB — Theorem 17B 
BH bisects angle ABC 

AF bisects angle BAD - e§&8tructions 

DF biseets angle ADC 
CH bisects angle DCB 

So EFGH must be a rectangle. 


Samole 4 reveals the major weakness in most 
students’ work- that they will not write down what is 
given, what is required to be proved, and what the const¬ 
ruction is. This student repeated what was given in the 
question, called this the proof, and concluded "so EFGH 
must be a rectangle”. This student, a fair representative 
of the majority of these 300 students, knows neither 
proofs, nor constructions, and above all he applies little 
or no A logical thought in solving his problems.

Question 53 was one of the most poorly answered 
items on the examination, and part a was the second most 
poorly answered of the four parts, with only 7 students 
receiving credit of 2 marks each for part a. No partial 
marks were given- the students got either zero marks or 
two marks, for each of the four parts. It is easy to see 
that 86% of the students in this group of 300 know 
absolutely nothing about graphs. With the correct answer 
anywhere between 130% and 145%, we see only four persons 
that are anywhere near the correct answer, and these four 
had answers between 100% and 130%. Three others had 
answers between 146% and 200%. The range of answers was 
from a low of 4/11% to 4 million percent, and this fact in 
itself gives a fairly accurate picture of the understanding 
of graphs as held by the vast majority of these 300 students 
One student answered "yes 1 *., and several others gave 
answers expressed in bbls., when the question distinctly 
asks for percentage. Common sense and a sense of reason, 
should hatfe told many of the ridiculous answers they 
were writing. The fact that 15% had answers between 
5000% and 500,000% shows the lacking of understanding 
in relation to the concept of percentage.

Although part b was done approximately 6 times 
as well as part a, there were still only 13% of the group 
receiving credit for the correct answer. 22% were within 
4% of the correct answer which is a much better performance 
than that of part a, yet we still see a great number of 
very ridiculous answers, ranging from .021% up to 
1,005,000%. Many did not read the question properly, and 
expressed the answer in ”bbls.”, when the question clearly 
asks for percentage.

The results in part c compare favorably with 
parts a and b, with only 7% of these students finding 
the correct approximate ratio, and 31 % making no 
attempt to solve the problem• 

The range of marks is as extreme as in parts 
a and b, with answers from 1/10 to 10 million, and many 
answers expressed in terms of bbls. Again the results 
show a complete absence of understanding of graphs and 
ratio.

Next to question 5£, question 53d was the most 
poorly answered of all the examination questions. The 
fact that £0 students said that Alberta’s average annual 
oil production was between 10 and 100 bbls. is 
sufficient evidence that almost all of these 300 
students applied neither logical thought to the problem, 
nor gave a second thought about the meaning of their

Concluslons regarding question 53 

In analyzing question 55 as a whole, one sees a 
tremendous lack in the understanding of percentage, ratio, 
and graphical interpretation. It is true that the units 
used on the graph were the main source of confusion, and 
it may be said that inadequate preparation in the class¬ 
room for this type of graph was very likely a prime cause 
of so much confusion. Certainly this type of graph is 
much different from those graphs which the students 
experienced in the authorized text-book. 

Table XVI on page 14 sums up the students* ability 
to understand graphs, and graphical concepts. x here we 
see, out of a possible total of 8 marks, 254 persons 
with zero marks, 60 with 2 marks, 6 with 4 marks, and no 
one for 6 marks or 8 marks.

CHAPTER V 


ANALYSIS OF THE TEXT BOOK 

As mentioned in chapter I, the text book will be 
analyzed for: a. Relationships 

b. Concepts, definitions or technical 

vocabulary 

c. Routines or techniques, 

Mr, French and Mr. Massing both had difficulty in 
defining each of the terms, "generalizations, language, add 
information", which were the subject matter of their theses. 
Similarly, with this thesis, there is such an overlap in 
meaning among the three terms, that no hard and fast 
definitions of the three can be formulated, 

Katz and Schanck in their book ’Social Psycholggy’ 
make the following statement, " To see identity in diff¬ 
erences is the basis of relationships". Relationships 
and generalizations thus bee one very closely tied together. 
The above mentioned statement, and Webster’s ddfinition of 
a relationship as "the mode in which two or more things 
stand to one another” will be taken as the basic meaning of 
’relationships’. All theorems, propositions and formulae 
will be classified as relationships. 

Concepts in this thesis will be understood to in¬ 
clude all the technical vocabulary and the appropriate de¬ 
finitions found in the text book for this technical 
vocabulary. 

Routines or techniques are here defined as the 
application of facts or methods used in solving various 
problems. They are non-relational- they are specialization

on a particular problem- they are the tools with which 
the problems are solved. Example: finding the area of a 
square, simplification of an expression , constructing a 
certain figure, and solving a linear equation, are all 
routines or techniques. The knowledge that the area of 
a circle is "pi x r 2 " is an expression of the relationship 
between the area of a circle and its radius. The applic¬ 
ation of this formula in finding the area of a particular 
circle is a routine or technique. The definition of a 
circle is a concept. 

With these definitions in mind the text book has 
been analyzed for relationships, concepts, and routines. 

A. Analysis of the text for Relationships 

Some £7 relationships listed under 12 main 
headings have been discovered in the text. The IE main 
headings have been arranged alphabetically, and all the 
relationships relative to that particular topic have 
been listed underneath eadh heading. In some cases a 
duplication of relationships will be notices as the part¬ 
icular relationship was relative to more than one main 
topic. Example: The formula for the area of a circle 
will be found under three headings; area, circles, and 
formula. Because it IS relative to each of these three 
topics, it has been included in each as a relationship. 

I. Area 

2 

1. *>rea of a circle equals TTr , 

2. Area of a circle varies with the 

radius squared. 

3. Area of a rectangle: A = LxW.

B. Analysis of the text for Concepts 

The following list comprises the concepts or 
technical vocabulary found in Mathematics for Today’. 

The terms are listed alphabetically, under main topics, 
and are to be considered separately from the relationships 
listed previously. This list comprises 505 technical 
terms, but the definitions of each, which are also a 
part of the classification of concepts, will not be 
included in this thesis. 

The concepts found in the Algebra section of the 
text are intermingled with those found in the Geometry 
section, but all are arranged elphebetieally together.

C Analysis of the texfe for Routines or Techniques 

The initial attempt at classifying the various 
fcoutines was in a manner similar to that used in 
classifying the relationships- i,e., a listing of 
routines under various main headings. This resulted in 
much duplication of routines under various headings, and 
for this reason it was decided to develop this analysis 
by a chronological listing of the routines involved in each 
individual chapter. It is often difficult to differentiate 
between techniques and relationships, and in several 
instances it might be debated whether a particular routine 
would best be classified under relationships. For this 
reason it is necessary that one keeps in mind that there is 
no definite border line between these various categories, 
and all classifications made are based on the personal op¬ 
inion of the writer and hiw "working definitions" of these 
three important components of the grade IX mathematics

CHAPTER VI 


ANALYSIS OF THE EXAMINATION PAPER 

The analysis of the examination paper though 
conducted in a manner similar to that used in chapter Y, 
will he listed in a different format. In chapter V, the 
relationships found in the text were alphabetically 
arranged under' 12 main headings; the 303 concepts were 
alphabetically listed under main topics; and the techniques 
or routines were chronplbgically listed under chapter 
headings of the book in which they were found* 

In chapter VI the relationships and routines will 
be shown separately as they appear in each of the 53 
questions on the examination paper. Because there is such 
a duplication of concepts on the various questions, the 
concepts will therefore be listed.alphabetically with no 
attempt to group them under main headings, as was done 
in chapter Y* 

In some instances both the relationship and the 
routine seemed of equal importance and therefore each was 
listed under its separate heading* In other questions 
the relationship alone seemed the more important and in 
that case only the relationship was listed* Still in 
other questions, the routine itself seemed the only 
important factor, in which case only a routine was 
classified under that particular question* 

A* Relationships found on the Examination ^aner 

The following are the relationships found in each 
of the 53 questions on the examination paper.

Remembering that 303 separate concepts were 
listed in chapter V as comprising the technical vocabulary 
of the text, it is now possible to calculate the per¬ 
centage of text-book coverage made by the examination 
paper. 

% coverage = 9£ x 100 
303 

= 32.7 

The percentage of text-book coverage made by 
the examination paper is 32*7- i*e., almost 1/3 of all 
the concepts found in the text-book were also found one or 
more times on the examination paper.

CHAPTER VII 


PUPIL ACHIEVEMENT ON RELATIONSHIPS, CONCEPTS* & ROUTINES 

The development of chapter VII is based on evidence 
of what the pupils know rather than what they do not know. 

As mentioned previously, almost every question is actually 
a combination of relationships, concepts and routines, and 
it is often very difficult to determine whether errors made 
were due to faulty relational thinking, or to improper 
performance of routines. This is especially applicable to 
section A where all the questions are of a multiple choice 
nature, and where also the element of guessing has very 
likely played an active part. 

*n calculating pupil achievement, each question 
was considered separately as to "correct relationships, 
and/or concepts, and/or routines". With reference to the 
first 40 questions, if full marks depended mainly on one 
of these 3 classifications, then that classification was 
given a score value of 2 marks (full marks for the question). 

If full marks depnded on a combination of two or all of the 
classifications, the two major ones were each given a score 
value of one mark, and the third classification, (usually 
concepts) though important, was given a zero value, ft 
must be remembered that in section A no partial marks were 
given- the students received either zero marks or two 
marks. It is this method of marking, plus the type of 
question (multiple choice) which makes it extremely diff¬ 
icult to say whether errors made were due to faulty 
relationships, concepts, or routines.

It is much easier, yet more correct, to calculate 
the number of students receiving full marks on each 
question in section A and say, "these students know the 
following particular relationships, concepts, and routines, 
than it is to attempt to calculate the number of students 
that do NOT know the various relationships, concepts, and 
routines involved in the 40 questions of section A. 

In section B the first 10 questions involve only 
routines and concepts, and an analysis of these questions 
allows one to more accurately determine what errors were 
made in the various routines* 

In secti&n A and B the number and percent of students 
receiving full marks t and thus having all the correct 
relationships, routines and concepts involved) were 
calculated, and besides these was listed the value 
alloted (VA) for each particular relationship, routine 
or cnncept. ,J -his allotment of marks was arbitrarily made 
by the writer, for the sole purpose of calculating pupil 
achievement, and does not represent the method of marking 
as used by the examination board, necessarily* Whenever 
possible, the errors made were classified as either 
incorrect relationships, concepts or routines; but if it 
were not possible to differentiate the reason for the 
error, the errors were then grouped together, as for 
example, ’Incorrect relationship and/or routine’. 

In section B, questions 41-50 inclusive, the 
errors were classified under one or more of the routines 
involved as listed in chapter VI, part C. In questions 
51 and 52, the number and percent of students showing the 
correct relationship and routine are listed as well as the

FS: Frequency of scores receiving alloted value 
RSO: Raw score obtained by all students on the particular

The summary of achievement in concepts is very 
narrow in scope inthat only 9 questions are being used 
to calculate achievement. As mentioned previously, 
almost every question contains concepts to a greater or 
lesser extent, and it is difficult to apportion 2 marks 
among three categories. In the majority of cases, the

marks were divided between relationships and routines, 
and in the rare case where only relationships or 
routines existed, it was possible to allot marks for 
concepts. This allotment was done in the abibve 9 
questions, all of them being found in section A of the 
examination paper. Because of the narrow scope of 
this summary of concepts, the results obtained must be 
considered only with reference to this inherent weakness. 

The total raw score possible for all students on these 
9 questions is 2700 marks. The total raw score 
obtained by the 300 students on these 9 questions 
is 971 marks.

D. Summary of Mechanical Errors on Questions 41-50 

Because of the multiple choice questions in 
section A of the examination* it was impossible to 
accurately determine the number of mechanical errors made. 
Analysis of the answers of the first ten questions in 
section B makes possible to a limited extent, a partial 
determination of mechanical errors. 

The writer assumes that these ten questions, are 
representative samples of the whole paper, and conclusions 
reached through an analysis of these questions can also be 
applied to the paper as a whole.

It should he noted thet under column M.MD for 

question 47, that the total marks lost through errors 

in multiplication and division is listed as only 100 

instead of 150, even though M.MD is usually found by 

multiplying F.MD by TVQ. In question 47 those 50 students 

who made mechanical errors in multiplication and division 

all had correctly found the sum of (P/Q), and therefore 

they were given one mark each for having a partially 

correct answer. Thus they lost only 2 marks each for the 

error in multiplication and division. Thus M.MD for 

question 47 would be (50 x 2), or 100. 

% of marks lost through errors in addition and 

subtraction equals M.AS x 100

Adding the above calculated percentages we find 
that 18.3% of the marks lost on the first ten questions 
of section B were due to mechanical errors in tte four 
fundamental operations. Generalizing, one might say that

mechanical errors, it is very likely that the total 
percentage of marks lost on the whole examination paper 
due to mechanical errors would closely approximate 18% 
as well* It is astonishing and also inexcusable that 
pupils with B standing in mathematics should lose close 
to 20% of their marks on fundamental operations which 
they have been practicing for the last 9 school years.

CHAPTER VIII 


PUPIL MASTERY OF THE COURSE ON THE BASIS OF TOPICS 

The content of the examination paper has been 
divided into two main sections, Algebra and Geometry, 
and these in turn have been subdivided into individual 
main topics- 14 in the Algebra section and 11 in the 
Geometry section. 

Classification of the examination questions 
under various topics was made in an arbitrary manner. 
Each question was analyzed into its various mechanisms 
and from such analysis the questions were classified 
under the various topics. Exanrole: question 21 was 
listed under four different main topics as it was felt 
that this particular problem involved factors directly 
related to those four main topics. The net result of 
such analysis was the list of topics, alphabetically 
arranged, and enumerated below. 

Algebra Topics 

1. Averages 

2. Equations, Equalities, and axioms 

3. Evaluation and substitution 

4. Exponents 

5. Formulas 

6. Fractions 

7. Fundamental Operations applied to polynomials 

8. Graphs 

9. Mensuration (lengths, areas, volumes) 

10. Parentheses 

11. Percent 

12. Problems 14. Signed numbers 

13. Ration and variation

questions involved under the various topics. 

The following n k@y w will be used for the tables 
of pupil achievement on the algebra and geometry topics. 

KEY 

TRSP: Total raw score possible by all students on the 

questions containing the particular topic. 

This total is found by summing for all students, 

the raw scores total for the individual questions. 

TRSO: A otal raw score obtained by the 300 students on the 

questions containing the particular topic. 

#-A: Percentage attainment. Found by the formula 

%-A =s TRSO x 100 
TRSP 


TPS: Total possible score for any one individual on the

particular topic* ( x he score referred to is the 
raw score value as found on the examination pacer.) 
MTS: Mean total score for the 300 students on the questions 
involved in the particular topic. This mean total 
score is found by taking the TPS (total possible 
score) and multiplying it by the "%-A" ( percent¬ 
age attainment) 

An example will clarify the following tables. 

The first main topic under the algebra section is that of 
’averages*. There were only two questions dealing with 
this particular topic, and they were 8 and 53 d, as seen 
in the second column of the table on algebra topics, iiiach 
of these questions was worth 2 marks, so the TRSP for the 
§00 students would be 300x2x2 which is 1200 marks. The 
column TR30 was computed by using the data of chapter IV* 
and for the topic of averages, the raw score total obtained 
by the 300 students was 472. TRS0 was then expressed as 
a percent of TRSP which the table shows as 39. The total 
possible raw score for any one person to make on these 
two questions ( 8, 53d) was 4 marks as shown under TPS. 

The mean total score (MTS) 1.6 was found by taking 59% 
of the TPS, which means that the average score for the 
300 students on the topic of averages is only 1.6 marks 
out of a possible total of 4 marks.

Using the data found in table LXXXVII, above it 
is now possible to calculate a mean percentage score-a 
weighted score that takes account of the variation in 
marks for the different topics. 

The weighted mean percentage score is the sum 
of the products obtained by multiplying the percentage 
attainment ($-A) by the total possible raw score (TPS), 
for each of the main topics , and dividing this sum by 
the sum of the number of marks (raw scores) alioted 
for each main topic.

CHAPTER IX 


SUMMARY 

In chapter I eight important questions were asked, 
answers to which adequately summarize the finding of this 
investigation. 

A. What do the students at the lower limit of group B 

know? 

The following percentages quoted are approximations 
only, hut none varies more than J-% from the exact percent¬ 
ages calculated from the data in this thesis. 

1. 55% can find the product of two decimal fractions. 

2. 71% can find the complement of an angle. 

3. 87% can find the sum of 3 common fractions. 

4. 61% can solve a simple multiplication type of 
equation by division. 

5. 71% can find the average of a set of 5 numbers. 

6. 88% can find the size of each angle in a semi¬ 
circle subtended by equal arcs. 

7. 77% can choose the "not necessarily true" equation 
involving the sum of angles of a straight angle from the 
"necessarily true” equations involving the sum of angles 

of a straight angle. 

8. 81% can find the sum of 6 signed numbers. 

9. 58% can change common fractions to the L.C.D. 
in order to find which fractional equation is true. 

10. 65% can transform a simple equation of the first 
degree by addition and subtraction, and find the value of 
the unknown.

11. 51% understand the verbalization of the 
formula for finding the volume of a cylinder. 

12. 57% can calculate the length of each side of 
a cube that has a volume of 512 cu. in. 

13. 53% can accurately aoply theorems 17,20,21, 
and 22, to select equalities applicable to a given figure. 

14. 62% can find the product of a common fraction 
and a mixed fraction. 

15. 75% can divide a common fraction by a common 
fraction. 

It is interesting to note that almost every one 
of the 15 items mentioned above, involves "old material”, 
or mathematics that the students learned in grades 
previous to grade IX. The writer feels quite sure that 
the mathematics understood by the great majority of these 
300 students, would also be quite well understood by the 
”good average” pupil in grade VIII. Student achievement 
with new material, or mathematics of the ninth grade, is 
best seen in the list of 41 items that is to follow. 

B. What do the students at the lower limit of group B 
NOT know? 

1. 93% cannot verbalize the formula required for 
finding the area of the four walls of a room. 

2. 81% cannot find the area of a circle of given 
diameter. 

3. 57% cannot select from a group of fractions, a 
fraction or ratio equal to a given ratio. 

4. 70% cannot calculate the area of a rectangle whose 
sides have all been increased 5 times.

We noticed in part A of this summary that the 
greatest pupil success was with material that was 
actually a review of prefious years 1 mathematics. Almost 
all of the items appearing in part B are concerned with 
the relationships, concepts and routines of the grade IX 
mathematics course, and it is plainly seen that the vast 
majority of students know very little or have very little 
understanding of the mathematical fundamentals of the 
grade IX text. 

C« Are definitions meaningful to the students? 

In this thesis, definitions are synonymous with 
concepts or technical vocabulary. The Summary of 
Achievement in Concepts on page 143 shows that the 
percentage achievement on concepts was 36, which means 
that slightly over 1/3 of all the marks alloted for 
concepts were earned by the 300 students at the lower 
limit of group B. We can conclude from this that 
defintions, or concepts, are not meaningful to the 
great majority of these 300 students. 

D. Do the students know their proofs and constructions? 

This question may be answered with one word, "No”. 
There were only two questions on the examination which 
tested the students' abilities to prove various theorems 
and propositions. One of these was much too difficult 
for all these students, but the other was very straight- 
forward and fair. Yet, only one person out of 300 was 
able to get full marks for the easier proof, and no one 
got more than two out of six marks for the more difficutl 
question (question 52). Question 51, the easier proof,

was an application of assumption 2 and theorem 21, yet 
there were only 12 persons who got parital marks for 
proofs. 

65 persons were able to get the correct constr¬ 
uction for question 51, for which they were given one 
mark. Df these 65 persons, only 13 were able to proceed 
to the next step and apply theorem 21. Regarding question 
52, no construct ion was required other than making 
the correct diagram, which only 40 persons were able to do 
correctly. Prom this evidence we may conclude that these 
students do not know proofs. It is unfortunate that the 
examination did not more thoroughly test for constructions, 

8 of which appear in the text- none of which appears on 
the examination paper. 

E. Do the answers given show any evidence of 
logical thought, or does the work reflect only memorization? 

Evidence of frequent guessing, combined with the 
large number of very absurd responses show that critical 
thinking is not being done on the examination. Example, 
in question 7, 49 persons said that the fraction or 
ratio 5/8, which is less than 1, is actually equal to the 
ratio 8/5, which is greater than 1. In question 20, 146 
students said that "20 ft. per minute" is equal to 
"240 inches per second". If these students had applied 
just the slightest bit of thought to the meaning of the 
problem, they would have seen that answer "b" was absurd. 

The height of absurdity was reached in question 53 where 
we see a range of answers for part b from 1/10$ to 10 
million percent. Although these are extreme examples 
being quoted, they nonetheless show that a great number of

students have chosen answers, or calculated results , 
which if given one moment of critical thought would 
have reflected the complete absurdity of the answer* 

This is certainly evidence that few if any of these 
students took the time to check their work, or make 
rough approximations as to the reasonableness of ther 
answers* 

Memorization is reflected to a great extent in 
questions 51 add 52. Rere may be found proofs for 
diagrams which don f t even correspond with the given 
data of the question. One can only say that the 
wording of the problem of the figure itself, reminded 
many of a once known, but notr practically forgotten 
proof, and they blithely attempted to write down what 
once had been memorized, but never completely under¬ 
stood. 

F ^oes the examination paper test the students* 

powers to generalize or theorize? 

Yes. The paper gives many chances to generalize. 
This is seen in such questions as 4,9,21, and 37 to men¬ 
tion only four specific questions. The results show 
that even though the students do have plenty of chances 
to generalize, their ability to do so is very limited. 

Testing for powers of generalization is synonymous 
with testing for relationships. The Summary of 
Achievement in Relationships on page 141 shows that 
only 28.8% of the marks alloted to relationships were 
actually earned by the 300 students. 1'his is surely 
evidence that the majority of these 300 students have not 
the ability to generalize, theorize, or see relationships.

G. Does the examination paper test the students 
power to specialize and apply abstract theory to 

particular problems? 

Specializing and applying abstract theory to 
problems has been classified as a routine in this thesis. 
The examination certainly does test the pupil’s 
abilities to apply abstract theory- in fact 6of the 
paper may be classified under routines, or application 
of theory, in contrast to ZVf> for relationships, and only 
6% for concepts. 

The Summary of Achievement in Routines on page 

146 shows that only 35.9^ of all the marks alloted for 

routines or applications, were earned. This is conclusive 

evidence that the great majority of the lower limit of 

group B students have not the ability to apply abstract 

theory to concrete situations. The fact that almost 

t 

S% of the marks allo A ed to routines and routine questions, 
were lost through no attempt being made to answer the 
problem is further evidence that quite a large number of 
students have not the slightest understanding of 
abstract theory or of its application in the solution of 
a problem. 

H. Was the examination fair? 

Fairness of the examination is best discussed under 
several headings, each of which contributes to an overall 
view of the fairness of the examination paper.

1. Text-book coverage 

Generally speaking, the grade IX mathematics 
course as developed in the text ’Mathematics for Today’ 
consists of 81 relationships, 125 routines and 303 
concepts. Everyone of the relationships and routines 
requited to answer the examination paper is found either 
in the authorized text-book, or else will be found in the 
text-books of earlier grades. All the concepts on the 
examination may be found in the text with the exception 
of the word ’’bears” which appears twice on the examination. 
In this respect, the examination paper content was very 
fair. 

The examintion paper Itself consisted of some 58 
relationships, 106 routines, and 99 concepts♦ A his 
corresponds favorably with the allocation of marks mentioned 
in part G. 

One realizes that no examination can test for all 
the material covered in the course, but an examination 
that covers approximately 30% of the relationships, 85% 
of the routines, and 33% of the concepts is making a very 
good coverage of the year’s work. 

N.J• Lennes in an article ’The Function Concept in 
Elementary Algebra’ as found in ’The National Council of 
Teachers of M athematics- Seventh Y ear Book” makes the 
following statement: ” It is often said that there are 
three essential elements in elementary algebra, namely: 
the use of letters to represent numbers (this includes 
the formula), the introduction of Signed numbers, and the

use of the equation". ,M athematics for i'oday’ certainly 
covers these three essential elements. 

In regard to the chapter ’Problems’ in the text-book, 
it is the writer’s opinion that this section wqs not 
sufficiently tested. This is one section of the course 
that can live for the students- they can see the practical 
application of mathematics to their everyday life, tet 
there was not a single verbalized problem on the* 
examination. Many students who cannot understand oi^eelve 
an abstract mathematical formula, can nonetheless "tackle” 
what the text refers to as “miscellaneous problems or 
old fashioned problems” and get the correct answer. This, 
the writer feels is one weakness in the examination. 

Another weakness that the writer feels exists in the 
examination is the absence of any constructions. Like 
problems in algebra, constructions in geometry are 

o 

things that the student can see and do- they have a 
practical application to the individual student, as he can 

V 

actually see the results of applying his geometry unfold 
before his very own eyes. It is my opinion that if the 
examinations have a factor of practical application, they 
will much better reveal what the students actually know, 
much more than an examintion based on the abstract. 

Examination of the graphs on pages 155 and 158 
shows that the marks as © whole were well distributed over 
the various algebra and geometry topics, but one wonders 
why so many marks were given for the two topics ’ratio’ 
and ’percent’. There is very little discussion of the 
topic ’ratio and variation’ in the text-book, and none 
at all in the grades 7 and 8 texts, yet, almost 10 % of the

examination is devoted to questions involving ratio and 
variation. 

Questions involving percent, comprise more than 
8% of the examination. Even though the topic of percent 
occupies very little space in the text-book, its appearance 
on the examination may be justified in that it is a good 
test of the student’s mastery of grade 7 and 8 mathematics 
fundamentals. If this examination paper is so designed to 
test mathematical achievement in grades 7,8, and 9 then 
the percent problems on the paper are justified. 

2. fairness of the test items 

Appraisal of the 53 questions on the 
examination would have one conclude that the test items 
as a whole were quite fair- none could actually be called 
T trick* questions, and the values assigned to each were 
generally speaking, proportional to the difficulty 
involved. One could perhaps say that such questions as 
2,3,8,10, were overvalued in comparison to more difficult 
questions as 24,33, and 56, but it must be realized that 
it is quite an accepted procedure to begin an examination 
with a few of the easier problems, to encourage the poorer 
students if nothing else, and thus the criticisms that 
questions 2,3,8,10 are overvalued, are notfully justified. 

The usual examination procedure of alternating the 
more diffinult and the less difficult questions seems 
well carried out(see figures 2 and 3 inchapter III). On 
the whole, the easier problems appeared nearer to the 
beginning of sections A and B, and the more difficult 
ones were left nearer the end. Questions 26,30,33, which 
appear to be quite difficult for the majority of students

should have been placed nearer the end of the paper. 

Some question could he cast as to the validity of 
5 specific test items; 1,22,37,46, and 52, While it is 
evident that the examiner’s intentions in question 1 were 
to test the student’s understanding of decimal notation, 
it nonetheless sets a poor example in regard to significant 
figures. Speaking instrietly mathematical terms, the 
question asks for the product of two numbers, each of 
which has 4 significant figures. In no case could 

the product of these two numbers be significant to more 
than 4 figures, therefore the most exact answer that we 
could have would be 1219. One of Alberta’s noted 
mathematics teachers said of question 1, " This question 
is abominable. It should be pointed out that ALL of the 
answers are wrong* The correct answer contains at most 
4 sig. figures, and is therefore 1220. This is an 
exercise in significant figures, and the examination 
paper itself is teaching bad habits.” 

With reference to question 22, the students are to 
find the volume of a cylinder, and the unit of measure 
necessarily must be cubic measure, yet everyone the 
suggested answers was expressed in ”sq. inches”. This 
is perhaps a printer’s error, but even if it is, the 60 
students choosing answer ”b” were just as correct as the 
112 students choosing answer ”e”, yet they received no 
credit for having the formulization for the volume of 
the cylinder expressed rightly. 

The examiner, in composing the paper, made a 
slight error in the wording of question 37, with the

result that there are actually 3 correct answers instead 
of one. The question is worded, f The area of a sector of 
a circle varies directly as...” The three correct answers 
are: 

a.the length of the radius "r" 

b.the size of the angle A subtended by the arc 

of the sector of the circle 

c. the size of the angle A and the length of 

the radius "r". 

The question should have been worded, "The area of 
a sector of THE circle varies directly as..." and there 
would only have been one correct answer- answer "d". 

Question 46 in section B was not a fair test of 
the grade IX students ability to divide a polynomial by 
a binomial. Had this been a question on the grade X 
examination, the question would have been justified, but it 
is very unlikely that many grade IX mathematics teachers 
had shown the puoils how to divide a polynomial by a 
binomial when they are faced in the (third division) with 
(9a-2) 4 (5a-3). The fact that only 19% of the 300 students 
got the correct answer, is evidence of the difficulty of 
this particular problem. 

Question 50 was one of the best types of questions on 
the examination, and gave much evidence that insufficient 
stress is laid by teachers on the proper solution of first 
equations. 

Question 52 was much too difficult for EVERY one of 
these 300 students. w hen not one person out of 300 receives 
full marks, when 39 receive one mark, and only one student 
receives 2 marks out of a possible total of 6 marks, there 
is justification for saying that this item was unfair.

It was perhaps put on the paper to test the “better student” 
but when so few geometry problems were asked on the 
examination, this hhould not have been one of them. It 
was very unfair to the great majority writing the paper, 
especially when it says on page 306 of the prescribed 
text,under Language Practice, "Express each of the 
following problems in correct English without reference to 
a lettered figure. NO PROOFS ARE REQUIRED. (capital 
letters are those of the writer). Question 52 with a 
slightly different wording, is identical in meaning. 

Such questions as 52 may be good supplementary problems 
for the clever students, but they have no placd on an 
examination designed to test all the students, not just 
the superior. Had other more easy geometry problems 
involving required proofs been on the paper as well as 
question 52, then the examinati ons* ; . committee would have 
been justified in setting this particular problem. 

Question 53 was one of the most difficult and also 
one of the most poorly answered of all the questions. 

The wide variety of answers suggests a very inadequate 
preparation in the classroom for this particular type of 
graoh. The major difficulty with question 53 was in the 
interpretation of the units as expressed on the graph. 

Home students took each small square as the unit of 
measure, some took the large square as the unit of measure, 
and the vast majority were bewildered and confused- not 
knowing what to take as the unit. Those that did choose 
the unit of measure correctly in most cases found it 
very difficult or impossible to change their units 
into percentage. Although this question cannot be called

unfair, it is certainly a type of graoh with which few 
students have had any classroom experience, and it is 
certainly not the type ofgraoh which one would expect 
after covering chanter IV in ’Mathematics for Today’. 

3. Was the examination paper too long? 

r In the great majority of cases the students 
had plenty of time to read and answer the examination paper. 
The total number of marks lost on the 300 papers through 
"no attempts” comprises 4.2% of the total raw score 
possible, and in most cases it is very evident that these 
no attempts were due, not to insufficient time, but 
rather to an inability to answer the problem. Had the 
paper been too long a greeter number of no attempts would 
have been in evidence for the latter questions of the 
examination paper. We can thus say that the paper was not 
too long. 

4. Construction of the examination paper 

The construction of the examination paper 
was such that it acted as a handicap to many students. 

The writer noticed quite a number of errors occurring 
in the copying of answers from the rough work to the 
space provided for the correct answer. In many cases, this 
was due to the rough work ^eing performed on the back of 
one sheet, and the final answer being transferred to 
another page. If more space were given nearer to the 
questions, by spreading the blank pages at the end of the 
booklet throughout the examination paper, many of these 
errors would not have occurred. 

The use of machine scoring type questions 
might also be criticized. It is very lively that many of

the incorrect answers in section A were due to human 
errors in marking the answer sheet* It is very easy to 
choose the correct answer from the booklet, and it is 
also just as easy to mark the wrong answer on the ansv;er 
sheet, Children with eye defects would also be working 
under a handicap, especially with section A, where good 
eyesight is an absolute necessity. 

The writer would also like to suggest that where 
fractions are printed on the examination paper, as in 
question 3, that bigger type be used. It is very easy 
to look at the fraction 1/3 as printed on the booklet, 
and read it as 1/8, Similarly in question 7, a student 
with poor eyesight might readily mistake the ratio 5/8 
for 5/3. larger sized type is usedon the Suggested 

A 

answer side’ of the examination booklet, and there is no 
reason why such type could not be used on the left hand 
side of the booklet as well. It would materially help 
those suffering from poor vision.

KEY for table LXXXIX 
Q: Question 

EM: Frequency of full marks 
Z: Frequency of zero marks 

N: Number of students attempting the particular question 
NA: Number of students not attempting question 
V: Value of question 

NV: Number of marks attempted for the particular question 
( the product of N and V) 

EMVi-^otal number of marks earned for the particular 

question by all the students, (applicable only 
to questions 1-40 inclusive, where no partial 
marks were given.) 


The most informative column in table LXXXIX is 
"NV", which represent the total number of marks attempted 
for each question. The sum of the NV column would 
therefor©represent the total number of marks attempted 
for the whole paper. This sum total is 33,494 marks. 

If this sum total then be divided by the total number 
of students (300) we would then have the "average 
number of marks" attempted per paper. 

Average No. of Marks attempted per paper = 33494 

300 


— 111,65 marks. 


It will be remembered that the total value of 
the paper is 119 marks. *rom this we can calculate the 
percentage of the paper that was attempted.

Percentage of Pacer attempted — 111,65 x 100 

119 

- 93.8 

It is very significant that 93.8% of the paper was 
attempted, but two other important questions arise. What 
was the average number of marks per paper actually 
earned? What was the percentage of the paper actually 
earned? 

The total number of marks actually earned for each 
of the first 40 questions is listed under the heading 
MY in the Summary of Results on page 177. There were no 
partial marks given for these 40 questions- the scores 
per question were either zero or two marks. Thus by 
multiplying column "M" and column "V" it was possible 
to find the total number of marks actually earned for 
each of the 40 multiple choice items. The Summary of 
Scores shows that the total number of marks actually 
earned for the first 40 questions was 9962 marks. 

Table XC on the following page gives a summary of the 
marks actually earned for questions 41-53 inclusive. 

By adding the total of "MV" in table LXXXIX to the 
"Total raw score" in table XC it will be possible to 
find the total number of marks earned on the full paper.

Total marks earned on first 40 questions is 
9962 marks* (from FMV in table LXXXCX). The total 
raw score, or actual number of marks earned on the 
questions 41-53 inclusive is 2049 marks (from the 
summation of TRS in table XC). therefore the total 
number of marks actually earned on the whole caper 
by all students in this investigation is 
9962/ 2049, or 12,011 marks. 

With the raw score value of the whole paper 
as 119, and 300 students writing the examination (in this 
investigation) it was potentially possible for 35,700 
marks to be earned. 

Average no. of marks earned per paper — 12011 

300 


— 40.04 marks.

CHAPTER X 


CONCLUSIONS 

The standard of achievement for the 300 students at 
the lower limit of group B in the grade IX mathematics 
examination in June 1948, may be summarized with the 
following conclusions: 

1* The great majority of questions that were 
quite well answered were those involving routines and 
relationships learned previously in grades 7 and 8. 

2. The most poorly ansered questions were those 
involving relationships, routines, and concepts learned 
in grade IX. 

3. Generally speaking, definitions and concepts 
are not meaningful as they should be ; when we consider that 
these students all hold B standing in grade IX mathematics. 

4. Over 95% of these students do not know proofs, 
theorems, and assumptions sufficiently well to get even 
half marks for those questions requiring an understanding 
of the above. 

5. There is very little evidence of logical 
thought or reasoning entering into the solution of most 
problems, and very few if any of the students concerned 
themselves with cheeking answers or making rough approximations 
of the correct solution. 

6. The students are not able to generalize, theorize 
or see relationships. There is a complete lacking in 
functional thinking. To Professor Felix in this would 

be appalling, as he states in the National Council of 
Teachers of Mathematics- Seventh Year-book, "Functional 
thinking is the very soul of mathematics.

7. The vast majority have little ability or 
power to apply abstract theory to a problem, or use the 
techniques of the grade IX mathematics course in solving 
given problems, 

8. The average number of marks attempted per 
paper was 112 out of a possible total of 119 marks. 

9. The percentage of marks attempted per paper 

was 94. 

10. The average number of marks earned per 
paper was 40 marks. 

11. ■‘•he percentage of marks earned was 34. 

12. °jo achievement on relationships was 29.2 

13. fo of marks lost through not attempting 
problems involving relationships was 6.7 

14. % achievement on concepts was 35.9 

$5 % of marks lost through not attempting 
problems involving concepts was 2.9 

16. % achievement on routines was 35.9 

17. °jo of marks lost through not attempting 
problems involving routines was 7.7 

18. % of marks lost through mechanical errors in 
addition and subtraction was 9.9 

19. °/o of marks lost through mechanical errors in 
multiplication and division was 8.4 

20. ■‘•otal % of marks lost through all types of 
mechanical errors was 18.3 

The following are the special weaknesses as 
revealed by this investigation:

not the ability to recognize and understand dependence 
and relationships, which are the most familiar aspects 
of the function concept. A.£. Breslich says in the 
Seventh ^ear-book, ”recognition of the dependence of one 

variable quantity on another related variable is. 

one of the most important aspects of functional thinking.” 

2. Many students do not understand the use of 
the L.C.D. in regards to testing the equality of fractions 
and ratios. 

3. There is much weakness in the fundamental 
operations of signed numbers. 

4. Very few students have been taught to check 
their answers, either by approximation, or by inspection. 

5. *ew of these students can understand or 
interpret graphs and graphical units and concepts. 

6. i,, ew students in this group understand the 
meaning of "percent" and thus find it impossible to solve 
simple percentage problems or more complicated 
graphical problems related to percent. 

7. The concept of similarity and similar 
triangles, and their use in comparing figures by ratio 
and proportion is not well understood. 

8. The majority of these students are very 
weak in the four fundamental arithmetic operations, as 
seen in this investigation- tohere mechanical errors 
accounted for over 18% of the lost marks. 

The conclusions reached in this investigation 
correlated highly with the conclusions of Mr. Hooper, 

Mr. H. Miller, Miss V. Miller and Dr. Lazerte. x he

pupils as a group have a weak background in mathematics 
they have not the ability to think clearly or analyze 
oroblems, and the frequency of guessing, combined with 
the large number of very absurd responses show- that 
critical thinking is not being done on the examination.
