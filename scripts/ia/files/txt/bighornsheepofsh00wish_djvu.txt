ABSTRACT 


The type specimens of Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep 
Ovis canadensis canadensis Shaw, were collected near Bxshaw, 
Alberta in 1804. Since that time there has been a general 
decline in their numbers as a result of encroaching civilization. 
In 1954 a study was begun near the headwaters of the Sheep 
River in southwestern Alberta to determine the present status 
of the bighorn sheep. The herd under observation averaged 62 
individuals over a period of four years. Ewes and yearlings 
appeared on the winter range in relatively constant numbers 
each year. On the other hand, ram numbers fluctuated each 
year due to changing hunting regulations and breeding behaviour* 
In spite of irregular ram - ewe ratios there was no apparent 
effect on lamb production. The productivity was found to be 
low; the ewes did not breed until two and a half years of age, 
rarely had twins, and lived for only seven to ten years. 
Accidents, predators, parasites and disease are believed to 
be taking a steady toll. Competition for food with other 
animals is not believed to have reached serious proportions so 
far. Varied amounts of available forage on the winter range 
appeared to have no influence on the numbers of sheep that 
returned each year. It was concluded that the numbers of sheep 
on the study area were regulated by intraspecific tolerances

and by the amount of open range found near escape terrain. 

It is believed that excess sheep on marginal areas of open 
timber or high wind-swept slopes are subject to a high 
mortality due to predation and severe snow conditions. 

Management problems are discussed and it is 
thought that rams with slightly less than an actual 3/4 curl 
should be taken in order to harvest the heads with horns 
that are broomed or have wide spreads* Winter range 
improvements are considered and it is recommended that 
cattle, elk and dense poplar stands be removed from the 
sheep winter range. An experimental transplant of bighorns 
to the Provincial Park at SteveviHe is suggested.

INTRODUCTION 


The Rocky Mountain bighorn is presently listed 
as Ovis canadensis canadensis Shaw (Miller and Kellogg, 1955 )o 
Ovis canadensis was first described in 1804 by Dr* George 
Shaw of the Royal Society of London* The specimens that Shaw 
received were collected by Duncan McGillivray along the Bow 
River near Exshaw, Alberta (Seton, 1929)* According to Cowan 
(1940) four subspecies ( canadensis * califomiana * nelsoni and 
mexicana ) occupy the bulk of the species* range. Ovis canadensis 
canadensis is presently confined to the Rocky Mountains north to 
the 54th parallel and south into Colorado* 

Smith (1954) noted that there is much evidence 
in American historical records that bighorn sheep once roamed 
river valleys far from their present rugged habitat* When Mr* 

H, U* Green, Warden at Banff National Park, first came to 
Alberta in 1922 he found remains of bighorn sheep near Brooks and 
in the Sweet Grass Hills (pars* comm* )* Even within recent 
years bighorns have been reported along the Red Deer and Sheep 
Rivers as far as 30 miles east of their present range* 

Bighorns that inhabited river valleys and foothills 
were subjected to steady hunting pressure by meat and trophy 
hunters, devastating epizootics and steady encroachment of 
range by livestock* As a result there was a marked decrease in 
their numbers during the late nineteenth and early twentieth

centuries (Honess and Frost, 1942), 

In 1859 the Earl of Southesk described hunting 
bighorns in the Embarrass River country of Alberta (Couey, 1950). 
According to Millar (1916) Stony Indians took a large toll of 
bighorn sheep in the early 1900*s. During the hunting season 
of 1913 Millar and a forest officer visited 14 Stony hunting 
camps and found close to 200 sheep kills® Millar estimated 
that the Indians had killed 600 sheep in that year alone® 

About the same time Mr* N* K. Luxton, former museum curator at 
Banff, 55 secured several hundred sheep skulls' 5 at Morley from 
two traders; David McDougal and Leason and Scotts posts (pers* 
comm*). One trading post had stored over 700 sheep skulls* 

Over eighty of the skulls are now stored in the basement of Mir* 
Luxton ! s store in Banff (Fig* l)* According to Luxton, mounted 
game heads were popular in the early days and the Indians were 
able to use sheep skulls as trading material for flour, tea 
and salt* The white man in turn bargained with the traders 
for the skulls® Some of the skulls went to museums, others 
went as mounted heads as far away as Europe and the British 
Isles* Following Millar*s report to Ottawa the annual 
slaughter of bighorns was apparently stopped*

By the lBBO*s scabies had greatly reduced the 
sheep numbers to the south in Montana and Wyoming (Couey, 1950) 
and doubtless the epidemic spread into Alberta, Trappers and 
ranchers reported that pneumonia caused heavy sheep losses in 
the Highwood and Sheep River drainages in the early forties. 

The sheep of other ranges may have been infected as well® 

Since that time sheep numbers have risen slowly and remained 
relatively constant for the last ten years. In 1916 Millar 
estimated the numbers of bighorn outside of Rocky Mountains 
Park (Banff Park) to be not less than 1,275 head and not more 
than 2,700 head. Provincial game biologists estimate the 
present numbers of bighorn outside of the National Parks to 
be not less than 2,600 and not more than 3,300 head. 

Until recently the bighorn has been little 
studied outside of the National Parks. On May 4, 1955, a 
detailed study of a hunted sheep herd in the Sheep River 
drainage system was begun. The purpose of the study was to 
collect as much information about this comparatively rare 
big game mammal as possible in order to aid in its management. 

The study period was limited to the period from May to September 
each year until 1957 and as a result many of the winter influences 
on the life history of the bighorn are not known from direct 
observations. The main objectives of the study were to find: 


t 









(1) Age and sex composition of the herd, 

(2) Ratio of dry to pregnant ewes. 

(3) Lambing success and dates of lambing. 

(4) Seasonal movements. 

(5) Grazing requirements. 

(6) Mineral requirements. 

(?) Mortality rates. 

Other objectives partly related to practical 
management were investigated as well. These included the 
above historical review and a study of horn growth. 

Headquarters for the study were at the Alberta 
Biological Station located at the confluence of Gorge Greek 
and the Sheep River. Funds for the study were made available 
by the University of Alberta* the Provincial Fish and Game 
Branch and two wildlife fellowships from Canadian Industries 
Limited. The study was under the supervision of Dr. R. B. 
Miller* Professor of Zoology* at the University of Alberta.

DESCRIPTION OF STUDY AREA 

The study area wa3 confined to the upper portion 
of the Sheep River drainage system, an area of approximately 
four and one-half townships (Fig. 2). The headwaters of Burns 
Creek marked the western and Windy Point Mountain the eastern 
limit. The headwaters of Gorge Creek marked the northern and 
the headwaters of Junction Creek the southern limit. From east 
to west the altitude rises from 4,000 feet to 10,000 feet above 
sea level. 

The Sheep River forms a deep gorge in the softer 
shales of the lower regions after it leaves the hard rock 
formations of the higher altitudes (Fig* 3). This provides a 
natural route for the summer and winter movements of the bighorn. 
The rugged escarpments of Pyriform, Bluerock, Song-allee-she, 
Gibraltar and Burns Mountains provide lambing and bedding grounds 
as well as essential escape terrain for the sheep during the summer 
months (Fig. 4)* The considerably smaller escarpments of Missing 
Link and Windy Point Mountains and the walls of the Sheep River 
canyon provide bedding and escape terrain during the spring and 
winter months (Figs. 5 and 6). The walls of the Sheep River 
canyon are also utilized as licks for their natural mineral 
deposits by ewes and immature animals during the summer.

The winter range of the bighorn is typical parkland, 
i.e*, a mosaic of prairie patches and aspen groves, with prairie 
occupying the south slopes and aspen ( Populus tremuloides MIchx.) 
occupying the ravines and flat areas. According to long-time 
residents of the district a considerable amount of former open 
range has been invaded by poplar growth in the last twenty years. 
The higher summer range may be considered as unlimited* The 
Boreal-Gordilleran and Subalpine forests (Moss, 1955) occupy the 
zone between the winter and summer ranges. The Boreal-Gordilleran 
forest is largely white spruce ( Picea glauca (Moench) Voss) up to 
the 5>700 foot level; higher, there is a mergence with the Picea 
engelmarmi Parry, Abies lasiocarpa (Hool0 Nutt, association of the 
Subalpine forest. The stunted subalpine species or ,! krummholz n 
begins at 7,000 feet and extends onto the meadows of the alpine 
region* The feeding areas of the bighorn are confined to the 
Festuca scabrella Torr* association of the winter range and the 
alpine meadows of the summer range* 

The frequency or availability of the different plants 
on the feeding areas was determined during the summer of 1956 
by a line transect method described by Smith (1954). Fifteen line 
transects 100 feet long were permanently located on winter and 
summer feeding areas and the plants that were intercepted at foot 
intervals were recorded. The plant frequencies in the different 
transects were combined for a given area and appear as percentages

DESCRIPTION OF BIGHORN SHEEP 

The bighorn is a large sheep, squarely built 
with slender legs, short tail and somewhat tapered muzzle. 

The front hoofs are much larger than the hind ones which 
probably is an adaptation for climbing and checking downhill 
dashes with the forelegs and feet® The pelage varies in 
color from chocolate-brown to grey-brown in the summer and 
fall with lighter colored undersides, muzzle and rump patch. 
Coloration is extremely variable even in the same band; 
however, during the winter all the various coat colorations 
of the ewes and juveniles become light and drab and by spring¬ 
time all individuals are similar. Generally speaking, rams 
that are three or more years old retain a dark coat. 

The coat consists of two dissimilar fibers 
forming a dense outer layer of coarse hair and a loose inner 
layer of fine fibers, Honess and Frost (1942), describe the 
fibers of the inner coat as consisting of two types, true 
wool fibers and hair fibers, or meduHated wool fibers. The 
hairs of the outer coat have dark tips, hence the dark appear¬ 
ance in late summer and fall after the moult. As the coat 
becomes brittle from exposure, the black ends wear off to 
account for the typical faded appearance of the spring coat.

In the Sheep River study area adult rams and 
juveniles of both sexes begin to moult about the middle of 
May* The moult is an extended process that gives sheep a 
scruffy appearance for a month or more* Generally, hair 
first detaches from the back, sides and shoulders and later 
from the neck and rump. The earliest a complete summer coat 
has been observed was June 23, 1956 on a yearling ram* By 
the middle of July all yearlings, two-year-olds and adult 
rams have full summer pelage* Nursing ewes are generally two 
weeks slower in shedding their winter coats* Shaggy coats 
were observed as late as August 22. Hair and "underfur” grows 
slowly throughout the summer and fall so that the winter 
pelage bee ernes apparent by late September (Green, 1949)* 

Lambs are born with a woolly pelage that is shed in the early 
fall and replaced with a pelage that is similar to the adult 
(Cowan, 1940). 

The growth rate of the bighorn is rapid during the 
first summer, then the sexes begin t© differentiate as to size, 
i.e*, rams grow at a more rapid rate than ewes* Lambs are 
small enough to stand under their mothers when newly bom and 
may double their birth weight in the first month (Fig* ?)* By 
one year some rams may weigh as much as 100 pounds* Ewes may 
take as long as two years to attain the same weight (Seton, 192?)*

Two year rams are slightly larger than adult ewes and at 
five or six years may weigh from 250 to 325 pounds (Honess 
and Frost, 1942)* Adult ewes weigh from 125 to 175 pounds 
(Green, 1949)* The shoulder height of an adult ewe is 
around 35 inches and the shoulder height of an adult ram is 
close to 40 inches (Fig. 8)« Table III gives some weights and 
measurements of bighorns collected on the study area.

Horns reveal both the age and the sex of the 
bighorn. Horn growth is rapid for three or four summers in both 
sexes, then the annual increment becomes progressively less 
until the age of eight or ten years. By this time the annual 
increment is so slight it is sometimes impossible to distinguish 
the growth rings* Cowan (1940) suggests that cessation of horn 
growth is primarily a result of physiological influences 
associated with the breeding season* However, a hom annulus 
is laid down by both sexes and all ages including those prior 
to breeding age which would suggest that breeding season 
influence is not so great. Food shortage during the lean 
months of January and February is a more likely causative 
factor for the annual sulcus* 

During their first stammer young rams and ewes 
are indistinguishable in the field* The length of hom at 
seven months is from 1/2 inch to 2 inches with little more 
growth until spring. The horns of yearling rams are heavier 
at the base* With experience in the field this can be observed 
in side view* However, from front view the horns closely 
resemble those of adult ewes (Fig. 9)* The horns of the yearling 
ewe appear as short straight spikes becoming slightly recurved 
and more upswept to a length of 9 to 12 inches at maturity (Fig. D). 
The horns of the male continue to grow and curve back, down and 
forward becoming more massive with each annual increment (Figs* 11

and 12). The longest ram horn recorded measured 49© 5 inches 
outside circumference (Boone and Crockett, 1952). 

Broomed horns, i.e., broken or worn horn tips, were 
occasionally observed on yearlings of both sexes and some adult 
ewes. Rams over five years of age almost invariably had one or 
both horns broomed (Table IV). Many of the broomed horns observed 
on ram skulls had their tips broken off and the ends that remained 
were shattered. The ends of the horns on other ram skulls were blunt 
and worn smooth. Back and shoulder rubbing with the horns may 
contribute to worn tips. Young rams have been observed in the 
spring scratching the bases of their horns on trees and rocks 
and in some instances the tips were being rubbed at the same 
time. The fact that young sheep and adult ewes sometimes have 
broken horn tips may be a result of being struck by the horns of 
the larger rams. A certain amount of horn abrasion probably occurs 
when large rams bed with their necks outstretched so that one or 
both horns come in contact with the ground. There seems little 
doubt that horn tips are broken off in battles between the rams 
during the rut. Certainly the horns are struck with considerable 
force, since some of the ram horns examined had large portions 
chipped from along the frontal plane. A five or six-year-old ram 
may have a nearly complete curl prior to the rut, then, during the 
rut an off centre head-first collision with another ram could 
easily result in a broken horn.

The core of the horn is an extension of the 
frontal bone and it serves to strengthen the horn. The 
vascular tip of the bony core contributes to horn growth 
by depositing a slightly porous comified material on 
the central portion of the homy sheath* The bulk of the 
horn sheath is formed by layers of keratinized material 
from the epidermis* Growth of the bony core and horn 
base is negligible after four years (Table V)* However, 
the growth of the horn sheath is continuous (Fig* 13)®

SIZE, AGE AND SEX COMPOSITION OF THE BAND 

During spring, summer and early fall ewes and 
immature animals range most commonly in groups of two to nine* 
Bands are loosely associated and there are frequent fluctuations 
in herd composition as numerous combinations of sexes and ages 
are formed, broken up and formed again* The mature rams range in 
groups of 2 to 14 and remain separate from the other sheep until 
the rut* During the winter and early spring both sexes and all 
age groups are seen together* In the late spring mature rams 
we re observed on the same range and near other sheep* However, 
they were seldom seen to mix* Adult rams were frequently 
observed on wintering areas that were little used by ewes and 
immature animals. On one occasion a group of yearling rams 
attempted to join four large rams* The latter bolted and were 
found next morning in a valley four miles south of their original 
location* 

Of 440 observations made in this study the group 
size varied from 1 to 40 (Table VI).

Twenty of the 72 singles were adult ewes and 7 were adult 
rams. The remainder were 33 yearling males, 10 yearling 
females and 2 unidentified. The herd size averaged 8*9 from May 
until September in 1955 and 8*0 for the same period in 1956* 
Smith (1954) noted that Baillie~Grohraan reported the average 
flock size in the Rocky Mountains in 1882 averaged about eight. 
The comparison indicates what Smith calls the f, constant degree 
of gregariousness*" The composition of the Sheep River herd 
over a period of four years is given in Table VII*

in the spring of 1955 there was a total of 57 sheep on the winter 
range. The aggregate summer counts of ewes and lambs gave a 
ewe-lamb ratio of 1:0. With this ratio the 24 ewes would 
theoretically have 19 lambs. During the hunting season of 
1955 eleven rams, of which nine were yearlings, and one ewe were 
killed leaving a total of 64 sheep. If each of the remaining 
sheep had returned to the winter range and there had been no 
natural mortality, there would have been 28 adult ewes, 9 two- 
year ewes, 4 adult rams, 4 two-year rams and 19 yearlings or a 
total of 64 sheep. The spring census in 1956 showed a reduction 
of six adult ewes and two yearlings and an increase of one adult 
ram giving a total of 57 sheep. In May, 1956 one adult ewe 
and one yearling ram were shot for examination. During the 
summer of 1956 the ewe lamb ratio from aggregate counts was 1: 
0.83. With this ratio the 21 ewes would theoretically then 
have 17 lambs* In the hunting season of 1956 legislation 
permitted only those rams with a 3/4 curl or larger to be shot 
and no rams were killed on the study area. In January, 1957 a 
*2+ ram was collected for examination. Prior to the spring 
census of 1957 a yearling ram was found dead on the winter 
range. Again if each sheep had returned to the winter range 
and no more mortality had occurred there would have been 30 
adult ewes, 10 two-year ewes, 8 adult rams, 6 two-year rams and

16 yearlings or a total of 70 sheep® The census showed a 
reduction of seven ewes and one two-year ewe and an increase 
of one adult ram and six two-year rams yielding a total of 
69 sheep* During the summer of 1957 the ewe-lamb ratio from 
aggregate counts was 1:0*90* With this ratio the 23 ewes would 
theoretically have 21 lambs® One adult ram was killed on the 
study area during the fall hunting season leaving a total 
population of 89 sheep composed of 32 ewes, 7 two-year ewes, 

20 adult rams, 9 two-year rams and 21 yearlings. The census 
this year showed a reduction of six adult ewes, three two-year 
ewes, 13 adult rams and two two-year rams. In three years a 
total of 19 adult ewes, 10 adult rams, 3 two-year ewes and 2 
yearlings had unaccountably disappeared from the herd* Natural 
mortality on the winter range of the study area could account, 
perhaps, for half of this reduction; the balance appear t© have 
moved to other ranges® In 1956 and 1957 there was a total 
influx of two adult rams and six two-year rams which would 
indicate that the rams winter on different ranges from year to 
year. The fluctuating numbers of rams appear to have no effect 
on the numbers of ewes and yearlings, i.e*, the latter have 
appeared on the winter range in relatively constant numbers for 
the past four years* It appears that the range will support 
a certain number of ewes and yearlings. These numbers 
independent of the rams.

Table VIII is a list of ram-ewe and ewe-lamb ratios 
of the Sheep River herd from 1955 to 195# • The ratios are 
compared to those of a herd in Banff Park* The Park obser¬ 
vations were made from June 2 to September 16, 1956 at an 
artificial salt lick near Aylmer Mountain lookout* The 
observer was Mr* Norman Titherington who had been lookout man 
on Aylmer Mountain for eight years. The ratios were determined 
from his figures based on 103 observations of a herd of 97 head* 
The ram-ewe ratios were determined from actual numbers of adult 
rams and adult ewes* The ewe-lamb ratios for the Sheep River 
herd were determined from the aggregate number of adult ewes 
and lambs seen each summer beginning on the first of July. 

The ewe-lamb ratio for the Banff Park herd is based ©n actual 
numbers.

The table demonstrates that lamb production remains 
relatively constant regardless of ram-ewe ratios* 

Ewe-yearling ratios can be determined from spring 
censuses, but on the study area it is believed that since not 
all the ewes in the herd are represented on the winter range 
each year a very high yearling to ewe ratio is obtained* 
Aggregate counts were not useful for ewe-yearling ratios in 
this study since yearlings were seen more often than ewes even 
after the lambing period* Consequently the ratio of yearlings 
to ewes was unreasonably high* Yearling rams appeared to 
wander a great deal and were seen more often than yearling 
ewes during each summer* Because of this the aggregate counts 
resulted in an unbalanced sex ratio* Spring censuses revealed 
that there was no significant difference between the numbers 
of yearling males and yearling females prior to each of the 
summer counts* The sex ratios of the two-year-old sheep 
were irregular in both aggregate counts and spring censuses 
due to the wandering habits of the rams. Aggregate counts 
war© used with some degree of accuracy only in determining 


ewe-lamb ratios

SEASONAL AND DAILY MOVEMENTS OF BIOIORN SHEEP 

During the winter, sheep in the study area are 
confined mostly to the foothills along the Sheep River canyon. 

In the spring there is a definite shift to summer range, which is 
mostly above timberline« This type of movement is common to 
several bands of bighorn sheep along the front range of the East 
Slopes in Alberta. The rivers provide steep shale passageways 
between summer and winter ranges. On some shale formations there are 
natural mineral licks that have a strong attraction for bighorn. 

As a rule sheep can be found near the front range along river 
systems that have cut through Wapiabi, Bighorn and Blackstone 
formations. Some examples of where this occurs are along the 
Sheep, North Sheep, Ram, Blackstone, and Bighorn Rivers. The 
sheep in higher ranges, such as in the Parks, show no well 
defined seasonal movements to and from winter and summer 
ranges (Green, 1949)* 

The sheep showing definite seasonal movements are 
influenced chiefly by the weather. Since their diet on the 
high summer ranges consists mostly of low growing herbage, 
only a few inches of snow causes them to descend to their 
winter range. During the late fall snowstorm in 1954 one rancher 
observed ?2 sheep on the move toward winter range for a distance 
of 14 miles along the Sheep River. Again on May 24, 1955 a late

spring snowstorm resulted in 17 ewes returning to their winter 
range from the lower fringe of their summer range and lambing 
ground s. 

Several unsuccessful attempts were made to band 
or mark sheep in an effort to determine the extent of their 
seasonal movements. In spite of the banding failure, it was 
possible to recognize some individual sheep by body color or 
by horn differences, such as broken tips, unusual flare or the 
different horn sizes on rams of different ages. The balance 
of the discussion is based largely on observations of this 
sort. 

The spring movement from the lower altitudes 
towards the higher summer range is leisurely. If favorable 
weather prevails before the period of lambing the ewes and some 
of the yearlings are the first to depart. Their progress is 
governed by the rate of the regressing snowline. The areas 
utilized at this time for bedding and feeding are considered 
as intermediate range. The adult rams in the study area are 
among the last to leave for the summer range, A group of seven 
adult rams remained on the winter range as late as July 6, 1957* 
Other adult rams were seen on their way to summer range on 
June 11 and June 23, 1956, 

Sheep that were observed on the move along the 
migration routes showed extreme caution when crossing flats or 
entering timbered areas. The migration routes taken by different

groups of sheep generally followed the contours or a line of 
least resistance and varied in length from 8 to 25 miles (Fig. 14)« 
During the late fall or early winter rams seem to 
wander from one winter range to the next, depending on weather 
conditions. During a mild spell in Mid~December, 1956, Mr* W* T* 
Balmer, Forest Ranger, observed two adult rams coming from the winter 
range of the North Sheep River to the winter range of the study area* 
The distance between the two ranges is approximately ten miles* 

Yearly counts give considerable evidence that rams winter on 
different ranges from year to year (see pagel9)* Earlier it was 
mentioned that yearlings and some ewes tend to return to the same 
winter range year after year and that some ewes are forced to 
winter elsewhere. This conclusion is supported by observations 
of Mr. H, Marshall, a trapper, who has been on the study area for 
several years. He has observed sheep wintering from time to time 
on the high windswept slopes of Burns Mt*, i.e., the normal summer 
range of the sheep on the study area* 

The daily feeding and bedding habits follow no particular 
schedule. In fact, daily activity is erratic and unpredictable* 

Most of a band may be observed feeding while a few remain bedded, 
or most may be bedded while a few individuals continue to graze* 
Generally speaking, bedding occurs after morning and midday feeding 
and again at night* However, during the spring, sheep may be 
observed feeding most of the day and bedding only at night* Usually

a little time and care are taken by sheep in pawing out hollows 
in shale or scree for night beds which are usually near or on an 
escarpment. Day beds are chosen at random and made with a few 
strokes of a forefoot. Groups of three or more sheep were rarely 
seen bedded so that all were facing the same direction. Probably 
this arrangement is fortuitous. However, it serves as an effective 
protective measure. 

Summer weather seems to have little effect on the 
daily routine of the bighorn. Sheep were observed bedded and 
grazing on an exposed slope during a hailstorm and showed no 
apparent discomfort. Again, sheep were often seen apparently 
resting comfortably, yet exposed to the hot sun in the middle 
of the day, although on extremely hot days they would take 
shelter occasionally in aspens or conifers.

FEEDING HABITS 

Forage Studies . It is generally accepted that in 
the north temperate zone the number of big game mammals that an 
area will produce and maintain depends largely upon the condition 
of the winter range. The bighorn presents a special problem 
since it requires winter forage in close association with escape 
terrain. On the Sheep River approximately 350 acres of grassland 
associated with escape terrain are utilized by an average of 62 
sheep each winter. Thirty-five acres of the grassland form a 
hay field that has been mowed, plowed, planted with brome and timothy 
and mowed again for several years. The balance of the range 
includes the south facing slopes of Missing Link (Fig. 15) 
and Windy Point Mountains and an adjoining strip along the Sheep 
River. Those areas that are very close to escape terrain that 
are first made snow-free by wind or sun are grazed bare by bighorns, 
but generally the range shows evidence of only moderate grazing. 

As a rule sheep are constantly on the move while 
feeding* Areas up to a half a mile across may be covered before 
a meal is completed* This type of feeding makes the different 
food plant species readily available. In the spring sheep were 
observed grazing for most of the day. As the season progressed 
feeding became more and more interrupted by rest periods until 
the feeding periods became confined mostly to morning, midday and

evenings The quantity consumed for a meal by one four-year- 
old ewe (coll, no* 41) and a one-year-old ram (coll, no* 43 ) 
measured eight and seven pounds respectively. 

Bighorns were observed either grazing and/or browsing 
on 216 occasions. If one or a group of animals was seen both 
grazing and browsing it was recorded as one grazing and one 
browsing observation* Table IX gives the number of grazing and 
browsing observations for the spring and summer months of 1955 
and 1956.

It is apparent that the bighorn is primarily a 
grazing animal with a tendency to brows© more in the late 
summer* 

The plants utilized by the sheep were determined 
at approximately every fifth feeding observation, i*@», the 
feeding areas were examined after the animal (s) had departed* 





28 


The different plant species grazed or browsed were recorded* 

It was then possible to draw up a list of food preferences* 

The plants preferred were separated into four groups based on 
the numbers of times utilized, i*e«, high, moderate, moderately 
low and low (Table X)* The frequency of the preferred plants 
that appeared in the transects described earlier is also given 
in Table X* 

Generally there seems to be a direct relationship 
between preference and frequency, except for the browse species 
and this is due to the transects not being located on browse 
areas* It may be assumed then, that most of the plants utilized 
are readily available* From this assumption the food preferences 
of the bighorn may be used as a quantitative estimate of the 
plants they consume* If the values 10$, 7$, 4$ and 3$ are 
substituted for the symbols H, M, ML and L respectively in 
Table X they conveniently add up to 100$ for each column* 

An estimate can then be given of the percentage of grasses, 
sedges, forbs and browse that occur in the bighorn diet 
(Table XI).

The results correspond fairly closely to the grazing 
and browsing observations of Table IX. The table serves to show 
that forbs are the most important forage items in the summer 
diet of the bighorn. 

Stomach samples were collected from six sheep, 
one in January, 1957 9 two in May, 1955 and three in September, 
1955* The samples were strained through 1/4" mesh screens. 
Approximately half the material retained could be identified a 
The identifiable remains were distinguished as grasses, sedges, 
forbs or browse. The results are given in Table XII,

The stomach samples offer some support to the earlier data 
on feeding observations by showing the contrast between spring 
and late summer food preferences* Some of the forbs and 
browse species from the stomach samples were identified by 
Dr* E. H* Moss of the Botany Department, University of Alberta* 
The results are given in Table XIII*

In April and May the diet of the bighorn is 
largely the new shoots of grasses and sedges that first 
appear on the winter rapge. As these plants ripen they 
become dry and less palatable. The sheep then drift to 
their summer range to feed on the later emerging plants* 

In June and July forbs are most utilized, preferably legumes, 
thistle (Cirsium sp*) and larkspur ( Delphinium sp.)* Browsing 
of aspen ( Populus tremuloides ), gooseberry ( Ribes spp.) and 
willow ( Salix spp,) is continuous throughout the season and 
becomes most apparent in the late summer. The min diet of 
the bighorn is low growing herbage. 

Mineral Requirements* Natural mineral licks 
possess a special attraction for ungulates* Along the Sheep 
River canyon there are several mineral exposures which are 
used intensively as licks during the summer and fall by ewes and 
immature animals* Generally speaking every 10 to 14 days 
individuals return to utilize the licks. The mineral exposures 
are referred to by geologists as silvery grey weathering and 
it is believed that the minerals are leached from the glacial 
overburden onto the shale* The same type of weathering has 
been reported on the Bighorn, Sulphur, Smoky, Ram and North 
Sheep Rivers. Crystals of a mineral exposure from along the 
Sheep River were examined by Mr* C. E. Noble, Provincial 
Analyst, and were found to contain 9*6% NaCl and 26*9% MgS0/ f *?H2 0*

Possibly the sheep on the study area were seeking 
the NaCl, since their salting habits on the winter range were 
entirely confined to stock salt placed in the ranger*s pasture 
for his horses* Herbivores may tend to be sodium deficient 
in their electrolyte balance due to the low amounts of sodium 
that occur in their forage, (Morrison, 1956)* Some authorities 
claim that phosphorous and sodium are the essential elements* 
However, Cowan and Brink (1949) conclude sodium chloride and 
phosphorous are not necessarily the essential elements and 
that trace elements may well be the critical constituents in 
natural licks*

BREEDING AND LAMBING 


Judging from observations on times of lambing 
and a known gestation period of 180 days (Honess and Frost, 

1942), the rut or breeding season on the study area extends from 
the end of November until the middle of January* According to 
Mr. W. T. Balmer, the peak of the breeding season on the study 
area is in mid-December. Up to 1957 the study period had ended 
prior to the rut so that actual breeding behaviour was not observed. 
However, part of the breeding behaviour at the end of the rut 
was observed on January 26, 1958. Breeding behaviour has been 
described by several authors (Honess and Frost, 1942, Couey, 1950, 
Smith, 1954 and Russo, 1956). Usually one ewe in a group is in 
oestrus at one time. During this period a ram singles her out from 
the flock and a great chase begins with one or more rams joining 
in (Fig, 16), The oldest and largest ram attempts to keep the 
younger rams away from the ewe, but is not always successful. 
Copulation takes only a few seconds and ewes may be served 
by several different rams during one of these melees. 

Each year about the middle of May adult ewes begin 
leaving the winter range for the lambing grounds. On June 6, 

1955, three ewes and two very young lambs were observed above 
timberline on Song-allee-sh@ Mountain. By June 22, 1955, seventeen 
different ewes had been observed and nine were accompanied by 


c. 


/ 











- 37 


lambs* On July 11, 1956,twelve different ewes were observed 
and nine were accompanied by lambs* On July 11, 1957, fifteen 
ewes and fifteen lambs were observed in the Sheep River canyon* 

It was concluded that the lambing period on the study area extends 
from the last week in May until the middle of July* 

On two occasions it was believed that ewes had been 
observed with twins, but in each case there was a possibility 
that the extra lamb belonged to another ewe* Ewes were sometimes 
observed grazing or salting a quarter of a mile away from their 
lambs* A temporarily abandoned lamb was usually left in the company 
of other ewes and lambs and on such occasions an observer could 
easily mistake the lamb for a twin* 

It is generally believed (Honess and Frost, 1942, 
Spencer, 1943, Smith, 1954) that bighorn ewes do not breed until 
they are two and a half years old, although one has been success¬ 
fully bred at one and a half years in captivity (Deming, 1955). 

No two-year ewes were observed with lambs during this study* 

Most observers believe that rams also reach sexual maturity at 
two and a half years (Spencer, 1943). Rams of all ages exhibit 
some sort of breeding behaviour the year round* In order to 
determine what ages were fertile, sections of testes from rams 
aged one, one and a half and two and a half were examined for 
spermatogenesis* These rams were collected on May 26 , 1956, 

Sept* 7, 1955 and Jan. 7, 1957, respectively* Since spermatogenesis

was evident in the seminiferous tubules of the latter specimen 
only, it was concluded that rams may reach sexual maturity prior 
to their third year.

MORTALITY 

Old Age * Cowan (1940) states that'the ultimate 
maximum age in sheep is limited largely by the life span of the 
teeth." One hundred rams skulls from the Luxton collection and 
the study area and 18 ewe skulls from the study area were examined 
for cheek tooth development and wear* Tooth succession followed 
closely the description given by Cowan (1940); all sheep five 
years or over had complete permanent dentition (Table XIV). 

Surface wear of teeth first appeared in a few four-year rams. 
However, tooth wear was more apparent in rams over seven years 
(Table XI?). Four of the oldest rams examined were eleven to 
twelve years old. As the tooth surface wears away the tooth 
pushes outward from the socket becoming shorter with age 
(Murie, 1944)* This is confirmed by measurements of the second 
upper molars of 13 ©we skulls that were found on the study area 
(Table X?) 9 Only two ewes had cheek teeth that were badly worn. 
Nine ewes with slightly worn cheek teeth were estimated to be in 
the seven- and eight-year-old classes. The situation seems to be 
very similar to that described by Murie (1944)* He placed ewes of 
nine years or over in the old age class, and his data on longevity 
strongly suggested that ewes are shorter lived than rams. He 
found that few ewes lived beyond ten years while many rams reached 
the twelve year class*

It is well known among sheep breeders that broken 
mouth can occur in domestic sheep at an early age depending 
on the range conditions* Wherever rock and gravel occur on 
certain ranges, the incisors of the domestic sheep become 
separated, chipped and broken. It is possible that ewes on the 
study area are subject to more incisor damage than rams because 
of their habbit of nibbling at the mineral deposits along the 
shale banks of the Sheep River in summer and fall* The rams, 
on the other hand, range near areas where soft earth licks are 
known to occur* Possibly the conditions of the incisors 
determines to some degree the relatively short life span of 
the ewes on the study area. Unfortunately, no conclusive 
evidence of this could be found, since very few lower jaws were 
picked up that still retained incisors.

Predation . In the summer months sheep usually stay 
close to precipitous terrain and as a result are seldom vulnerable 
to a predator f s running attack. On the Sheep River wintering 
grounds sheep are more subject to predation due to winter conditions

and less accessible escape terrain. Remains of several sheep 
were found on the study area (Table XVI), but as these were 
largely portions of skeletons and carcasses that were beyond 
autopsy, the toll taken by predators is unknown* Nearly all 
age classes were found; most were from the youngest and oldest 
age groups. The remains of twelve sheep were found in the bottoms 
of ravines and the remains of six other sheep were found at a 
considerable distance from escape terrain. The possibility of 
predation could not be eliminated in any one of the situations. 

Those that were found in the ravines may have been weakened sheep 
that had succumbed to exhaustion in deep snow; the others may have been 
dragged by carrion feeders or poachers from the original death site.

The cougar, because of its agility and size, combined 
with its habit of seeking prey in rough terrain, is an important 
sheep predator. In recent years rangers, trappers and stock 
riders in the district have seen a total of four cougars in the 
study area. Although never abundant, cougars are certainly capable 
of diminishing big game numbers. Green (1949) on two occasions 
found where sheep had been killed by cougar; he also observed three

unsuccessful attempts by cougar to catch sheep. Another 
observation was made by the late Dr. J. A. Allan of the 
University Geology Department who had the rare experience of 
observing a cougar kill a mountain sheep on the highway near 
Exshaw. It is believed that cougar predation on sheep in the 
study area would be buffered by mule deer, since the latter are 
more abundant and the cougars® preference for deer is well known 
(Young and Goldman, 1946)* 

Coyotes, bears, lynx and wolverine may be considered 
as occasional sheep predators, although very little incriminating 
evidence showed up in this study* The district ranger described 
seeing two coyotes kill an adult ewe by forcing her over the wall 
of the Sheep River canyon* The incident took place in the winter of 
1953• One coyote chased the ewe through the ranger’s yard from the 
slopes of Hissing Link Mountain while the other coyote blocked an 
escape route leading into the canyon, so that the ewe was forced 
over the edge* 

Just prior to the study period large numbers of coyotes 
were poisoned during the rabies control campaign and, until recently, 
coyotes were seldom seen on the study area. On June 1, 1955 two 
coyotes were observed converging on a small group of deer* The 
deer bounded up a hill and the coyotes quickly gave up the chase. 
Immediately after the chase was over the indifference that was 
shown by one species for the other was remarkable* The deer 
began grazing on the hillside while one coyote sat and scratched 
and the other wandered off through an aspen grove* The same sort 
of indifference was observed again when a young grizzly bear lost 
out in a chase, first with five sheep, then with a cow elk an hour

later. After being chased fart way up a mountain, in each case, 
the sheep and the elk started to graze while the bear lumbered 
along only a few hundred yards below feeding on legume roots. 

During the study period snowshoe hares were noticeably 
scarce, while sight records and tracks of lynx were relatively 
common. This unusual lynx-hare relationship perhaps explains 
the following case of lynx predation on mule deer. During the 
latter part of the winter in 1956, R. C. Hill, the assistant 
ranger, found a young deer dead and partly devoured, lying 
along the road where it passes through the bighorn winter 
range. The tracks in the snow showed where the deer had 
run out of some trees, down a ravine and across the road to 
where it had dropped. The only other signs in the snow were a 
set of lynx tracks leading away from the carcass. Apparently 
the lynx had pounced on the deer f s back and rode it until it 
had collapsed. This type of lynx predation on big game is 
considered exceptional. The possibility of bighorn sheep being 
killed under such conditions should not be overlooked. 

Wolverine sign was observed on three occasions on 
bighorn summer range. The amount of wolverine predation on sheep 
in summer or winter is unknown 0 

Wolf predation on the bighorn in the study area is 
unlikely. Only one wolf has been observed on the study area 
since the Biological Station opened in 1950*

The golden eagle is both a predator and a carrion 
eater (Arnold, 1954) > and, like most widely ranging species, its 
food varies from place to place depending on availability. Eagles 
are known to harass a wide variety of animals ranging in size 
from ducks to grizzly bears (Murie, 1944)* During the entire 
study period eagles were never seen to attack or molest any of the 
large game mammals, young or old. A golden eagle nest on the study 
area was kept under observation by Mr. D, A. Boag for the period 
May 5 to August 19, 1955* Food items are reported in the Alberta 
Biological Station Report Ho. 5> 1955* It was found that small 
rodents are the main food items of the nesting eagles (Table 
XVU). The eagles® territory extended from the bighorn wintering 
grounds to the fringe of the lambing grounds.

In Wyoming, Honess and Frost (1942), observed 
an eagle®s nest in the heart of the lambing grounds and found 
no remains of lamb or adult bighorns* Murie (1944) reported 
that no authentic case of an eagle killing a lamb came to his 
attention during a three-year intensive field study of Dall*s 
sheep. It seems apparent then, that eagle predation on mountain 

sheep is negligible. 

Hunting * Conclusive evidence of poaching on the 
study area was found on three occasions. One hunting party 
admitted they shot a ewe each fall for their camp meat supply. 
Although poaching may account only for small losses of sheep, 
it is felt that every limiting factor should be considered. 

Another small and unnecessary loss of sheep occurred piupr to 
the 3/4 curl legislation* That is, ewes were sometimes shot 
by hunters who had mistaken them for yearling rams. In the 
fall of 1953 $ three ewes were shot in error and turned into 
the ranger station. For three consecutive years one part-time 
trapper reported shooting a ewe for a yearling ram on the North 
Sheep River. Under the present hunting regulations this particular 
form of ewe mortality has come to an end* 


Before 1956 legal sheep hunting on the study area 
removed a large portion of the young rams. Table XVXH gives

some idea of the relative ages and numbers of sheep that were 
being harvested by hunters in the study area prior to the 3/4 
curl legislation.

Accidents . Various accidents have been reported 
by different authors. Deaths have resulted from falling off 
cliffs* snowslides* fighting and porcupine quills. Accidents 
are inevitable for a creature like the bighorn which frequents 
precipitous terrain. For example* a ewe was seen to injure 
her right hindleg* presumably on a rock, in her haste to cross 
the Sheep River* June 3* 1955• Her flight up the canyon wall 
was impaired by her limp so that she stumbled and almost fell 
into the river 100 feet below. Predation* poaching, deep snow 
and accidents account for a part of the steady drain of sheep 
numbers from the study area.

Parasites and Disease . Diseases and parasites are 
generally considered the major factors for bighorn mortality 
(Honess and Frost, 1942)* It should be stressed that normal 
healthy sheep commonly harbour both internal and external 
parasites without noticeable harm* However, effects of infection 
and infestation may appear if there is prolonged exposure to 
adverse or over-crowded range conditions* 

Fresh droppings from 28 bighorn were collected from 
May until September in 1956 and examined for endoparasites* All 
were nematodes* Three slides from each sample were examined^ 
Infection was considered medium if one larva could be seen within 
each field of the microscope, and light if one or two larvae 
appeared on each slide. The results are listed in Table XIX* 

Some of the larvae were identified tentatively as Protostrongylus 
sp* Fresh droppings from two yearling rams were sent to Dr* 
George Post, Director of the Game and Fish Laboratory at the 
University of Wyoming for positive identification of the endo- 
parasites* He reported the larvae found in both samples were 
Protostrongylus stilesi Dickraans* He pointed out that various 
types of free-living nematode larvae frequently occur on droppings 
collected from the ground and one of these was also present in one 
of the samples. Gouey (1950) found several dozen lungwom larvae 
in each field of the microscope when he examined bighorn droppings 
gatiiered in Montana. It would seem then, that the most heavily

parasitized sample examined from the study area represents 
very light infestation. Heavy lungwom Infection is a usual 
precursor to pneumonia and this may have been the condition 
on the study area in the early forties. 

Only two unthrifty sheep were observed during the 
study period. Both were thin old ewes* and it was doubtful if 
either would survive another winter® A total of four diseased 
sheep were examined® A ewe lamb was collected about the middle 
of January in 195^ by Mr® Frank Jones* Forest Ranger at Canmore 
and sent to the University Zoology Department, The lamb had 
lesions in the mouth and on the for©limbs below the knee joints

occurs commonly in domestic sheep, that is, contagious 
ecthyma or *sore mouth** On Feb* 27, 1957, Jones sent in 
the head and a swollen right forelimb of a four-year ram 
that had been collected near the Kananaskis Ranger Station 
(Fig* 17)« The ram was in an emaciated condition* Dr. G. 

S* Wilton, veterinary pathologist, found that, "direct smears 
from the foot lesion revealed the presence of a necrophorous 
bacillus indicating foot rot* Absesses were noted adjacent 
to the joints and Corynebacterium pyogenes was recovered on 
culture"* Jones wrote that this was the first time that foot 
infection had been observed in the wil.d sheep of the 
Kananaskis area* On Sept* 9, 1956, Wm* T. Balmer, forestry 
officer on the Sheep River, shot a six-year ram with a deformed 
front hoof* One phalanx had an overgrown unguis that was hollow 
underneath and the other phalanx was twisted and twice normal 
size* The foot had apparently suffered from some injury or 
disease, healed and was of little use* The ram was taken 
between the study area and the fomer Kananaskis Game Preserve* 

On May 26, 1956, a yearling ram was collected that had absesses 
on both lungs* Dr* Vance examined the preserved infected tissue 
and suggested the lesions were probably due to a suppurating infection 
commonly seen in domestic animals and generally caused by species 
of the bacteria Spheropherus or Corynebacterium ,

There appears to be a lovr incidence of mouth 
disease in bighorn* During the study period only two ewes 
were observed with lumps on their jaws. Out of 21 skulls 
examined that still retained lower jaws, three showed 
evidence of some necrosis. Only four upper jaws of 92 ram 
skulls appeared to show evidence of malocclusion* 

Competition . From June until October domestic 
cattle have access to approximately 100 acres cf bighorn 
winter range, i.e., Windy Point Mountain and a two mile strip 
along the Sheep River. The slopes of Windy Point Mountain 
show little sign of range depletion, i.e., the dominant 
plants of the Festuca scabrella association are still well 
represented* However, the flat area above the river has 
been grazed to the point where several undesirable plant 
species have taken hold (Fig. 18). The balance of the bighorn 
winter range described earlier is accessible to six to ten horses 
during the winter and summer. From the middle of April until 
the cattle arrive in June, large numbers of deer feed on the 
green shoots of grasses and sedges that grow on the winter 
range of the bighorn. In recent years small numbers of elk 
have been observed infringing on the northwestern and eastern 
limits of the bighorn winter range. In every case mentioned 
the competition with the bighorn for winter forage was direct 









i '•

and varied from partial to considerable* Sheep were observed 
grazing in close association with deer and horses on several 
occasions and with elk on one occasion* In spite of an 
overlap of feeding habits, the importance of forage competition 
between bighorn and other animals on the study area is question¬ 
able* Consider the changes that took place on the hay meadow 
which forms approximately 10 percent of the winter range* In 
1954 the hayfield was composed of 24 acres of brome and timothy* 
The hay was cut and stacked and a corral was built around it* 
Only the stubble was available to the sheep* In 1955 the 24 
acres of hay was baled and picked up and the stiibble was 
utilized by the sheep (Fig* 19)* In 1956, nine acres at the 
west end of the hayfield and a new addition of 11 acres of 
former natural winter range were broken and left over winter, 
i.e. , the winter range was reduced by 20 acres* In 1957 the 
20 acres were seeded to timothy sihd a cover crop of oats. 

The oats were cut with a binder and stocked and the hay in the 
centre area was mowed and stacked. About 30 oat stocks were left 
in the field and these were cleaned up by the sheep early Last 
winter. The hay stack was accessible to the sheep, but was 
not utilized by them « In spite of rather violent fluctuations 
in a portion of their winter range sheep returned in relatively 
constant numbers every year* It would appear that during the 
past four winters the carrying capacity for bighorns has not 
been limited by the amount of available forage* In other words. 




54 


from the standpoint of forage capacity the bighorn range has 
not reached saturation, but from the standpoint of intraspecific 
tolerances and the present amount of open range it appears as 
though saturation has been reached. The constant degree of 
gregariousness has already been emphasized. The encroachment 
of poplar trees on former open range has been mentioned. The 
further a sheep wanders from escape terrain the greater is the 
requirement for an open view in all directions, i.e., a sheep 
must be able to see approaching danger and have adequate time 
to take cover. The less open space there is, the less distance 
a sheep will wander from its escape terrain* When this phenomenon 
is combined with an apparent level of intraspecific tolerance it 
serves as a natural control against over-population, provided 
there is a reasonable balance between escape terrain and open 
range that has not been overgrazed by other species. Some 
sheep on the East Slopes of the Rocky Mountains are associated 
with escape terrain and large open stands of timber during the 
winter. It is believed that these are marginal areas, since 
the bighorn*s fear of dosed timber stands has been observed 
many times. Other areas that are considered as marginal 
wintering grounds are some of the high wind swept slopes of 
normal summer range and the deciduous forest areas of river 
valleys. The sheep losses in these areas would fluctuate 
considerably depending on snow conditions and predation*

MANAGEMENT PROBLEMS 

Hunting; . Under the present hunting regulations 

in Alberta it is illegal to kill a bighorn ram with less than 

a 3/4 curl. In order to determine what age classes would be 

harvested and what exceptions might occur under the present 

system, a series of 104 ram heads, largely from the Luxton 

collection, were aged and the horns measured (Table XX). From 

a given set of horn measurements it is possible to determine 

the approximate fraction of a full curl from the relation 

* , where L is the horn length, 3 is the spiral distance 

C 

or spread - 1/2 inch and C equals the circumference of a circle 
with horn diameter D (see definition of horn measurements. 

Table XX) 9 Considerable variation occurs in all three measure¬ 
ments in animals of the same age (Figs. 20 and 21); however, 
the fraction of a full curl is largely dependent on S and G. 

For example, a 5+ ram with a 24 n spread and a right horn 
28 3/4” long with a 12 1/2” diameter had 0.6? of a full curl. 
Another 5 + ' ram with a 19” spread and a right horn 28 1/2” 

lorg and only 1.0 1/2” in diameter had 0.32 curl* Two of the 
seventeen 3 + heads examined were legal, i 9 e., they had 
a 0.75 curl or better. Both rams had tight curls or horns 
with narrow spread and small diameters. Eleven of the 21 

I am indebted to Mr. R. J. Watson, student engineer, for 
~ devising this formula.

- 56 - 


At present both the hunter and the enforcement 
officer are faced -with the problem of recognizing a legal head. 

A legal head may be described as having one horn that can be 
intercepted at both the front of the horn base and the horn 
tip by a straight line through the eye (Fig. 23). This is a 
rapid method of identifying a legal head in the field. 

Although it includes heads with slightly less than a 0.75 
curl, some of these possess broomed horns and wide spreads 
and should be harvested. 

Table XXII gives the numbers of sheep taken by 
hunters from the study area for the past five years, i.e., before 
and after the 3/4 curl legislation of 1956. The harvest is 
expected to pick up again in the fall of 1959 when a good 
percentage of rams born in 1955 will have grown legal-sized 
heads. Some losses of young rams are to be expected. However, 
quality is rated above quantity in the management of a fine 
trophy animal such as the bighorn.

Winter Range Improvements« The winter range of 
the bighorn on the study area has been subjected to both 
severe and moderate grazing which varies with availability 
and competition* No control measures can be taken as far 
as slope exposure, wind, snow and sun relationships are 
concerned; however, cattle should be prevented from utilizing 
a portion of what is definitely sheep winter range* A fence 
line could be constructed from the north side of the ranger's 
east pasture to Windy Point Mountain. The fence would serve 
to prevent cattle from further depleting a two mile strip of 
bighorn winter range. In the spring of 1956 a few elk were sighted 
on east Missing Link. In 1957 a noticeable increase of elk 
appeared on both Missing Link and Windy Point Mountains. It 
would appear that larger numbers of elk should be harvested 
from around the study area in order to prevent their contri¬ 
bution to further depletion of bighorn winter range* If the 
above control measures are taken there is less danger of the 
winter range becoming depleted to the point where sheep 
survival is dependent on the forage that is not eaten by 
other animals* 

It was pointed out earlier that at present 
bighorn sheep numbers on the Sheep River winter range appear 
to be regulated by intraspecific tolerances and the amount of 
open range at their disposal* If the statement is true. 




























f; 
















• - •- " ■ ■ • ’ 















- 60 - 


sheep numbers could be increased by an expansion of winter 
range* The expansion could be achieved by controlled 
burning or cutting of some of the dense poplar stands that 
have taken over former winter range* Otherwise, if nature 
is allowed to take its course and an efficient fire 
prevention system is maintained, forest succession and 
encroachment will continue* 

Transplanting * It is felt that the present sheep 
population on the east slopes of the Rockies is at an optimum 
level* Transplanting of bighorns along the slopes seems out of 
the question* An interesting possibility for a transplant exists 
in the badlands of the Red Deer River* As stated earlier, 
historical records mention bighorn as inhabitants of river 
valleys and the suggestion that they should be restored to 
some of these areas should not be overlooked* A logical 
location to attempt to transplant would be in a new Provincial 
Park at Steveville* If an area in the Park is investigated 
and found to have suitable winter range for sheep, a large 
enclosure should be built to contain the animals until they 
become accustomed to the area and, where, at the same time, 
their progress can be observed*

SUMMARY 


1 # A brief history is given of the Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep 
Ovis canadensis canadensis # 

2. The study area is in the vicinity of the Alberta Biological 
Station which lies in the foothill and mountainous terrain 
twenty miles west of Turner Valley, Alberta, on the Sheep 
River drainage* The area includes both the lower, more 
eastern, winter range, and the higher, more western, summer 
range of the bighorn sheep* 

3* The appearance of the bighorn is described; coloration and 
horn growth are the most distinguishing features* 

4* The numbers of rams appearing on the winter range vary 

from year to year* However, the numbers of ewes and yearlings 
appearing each year are relatively constant* Different 
ram-ewe ratios show no apparent effect on lamb production. 

5* A general movement to high summer range occurs in May and June 
and a return to the winter range of the foothills occurs during 
the late fall* 

6* The spring diet of the bighorn is mainly grasses and sedges* 
Forbs, mostly legumes, constitute a large portion of the summer 
diet. Poplar, willow and gooseberry are important browse species 


in the late summer. 









- 62 


7* Sodium appears to be the most important element that 
attracts sheep to natural mineral licks along the Sheep 
River canyon® 

8. The breeding season extends from the last week in November 
until the middle of January® The gestation period is 180 
days. Both ewes and rams appear to reach sexual maturity 
at two and a half years of age, 

9® Ewes on the study area have a shorter life span than rams. 
Incisor damage in ewes might be a cause of the differential 
mortality® 

10® Predation* accidents* parasites and disease appear to be 
limiting factors that vary from range to range. 

11. Evidence of competition for forage with other species was 
found® However* competition does not appear to be a 
critical factor in holding the sheep population at its 
present level. Sheep numbers are limited on their wintering 
areas by intraspecific tolerances and a requirement for a 
certain amount of open range near escape terrain. 

12. Horn growth varies considerably in rams of the same age. 

In order that trophy rams be properly harvested* heads with horns 
slightly less than a 3/4 curl should be taken.

13* The sheep population along the East Slopes appears to have 
reached saturation* The numbers are not great, therefore 
it is suggested that management practices should be 
designed which will at least maintain those areas that are 
established as sheep winter range*
