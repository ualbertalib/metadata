INTRODUCTION 

The Bituminous Sands of Alberta lie along the Athabaska River 
in Northern Alberta. Geologically they are lower Cretaceous in age, 
lying on Devonian limestones and overlain by Cretaceous shales. The 
oil reservoir was brought to the surface by erosion and now underlie 
from a few to a few hundred feet of sandy and clayey overburden. The 
deposit may be seen along the river banks over an area covering 1000 
square miles. There is evidence to believe that they cover an area 
of 30,000 square miles. 

This huge deposition of unconsolidated (geologically speaking) 
sand was laid down under deltaic conditions. Stratification is len¬ 
ticular, crossbedded and generally lacking in uniformity. There are 
scattered beds of silt and clay in the deposit and the amount of clay 
in the sand is variable. 

The bituminous sand deposit varies in thickness from 150 to 200 
feet. G-ood grades of sand have from 12 to 17 percent by weight of bit¬ 
umen in them. However there are beds of varying thickness where the 
grading of bitumen drops very low. This bitumen is a very heavy, very 
viscous crude oil of specific gravity, slightly greater than unity. 

When constructing buildings, offices, warehouses, etc., on these 
beds, it has been found that they are quite stable, provided they are 
not disturbed. However if the soil mass is disturbed, such as in a 
backfilling process, they become highly unstable. A look at plates 
one to three will show the effects of this remolding due to backfilling. 

Plate one shows a small pump house placed on a concrete wall founda¬ 
tion at the river bank. After construction of the house, bituminous 
sand was backfilled around the foundation towards the river and the de-

parture of the top of the foundation from the base of the building, 
even though the depth of the foundation was 30 feet. 

Plate two shows a backfill of the bitumen material to be used as 
a ramp for trucks. The lateral support for the fill was of approximate¬ 
ly horizontal logs suitably held in place. It is readily seen that the 
logs have become displaced. The displacement took place where the fill 
was placed over the edge of a bank. 

Before the fill was placed a pipeline ran through approximately the 
centre of the fill. After the fill was started it was decided to take 
out a piece of the pipe to allow trucks to move freely. After placing 
the fill, the pipeline could not be reconnected again. It was found 
that the pipe running through the fill had been displaced a foot or more. 
This can also be seen in plate two. 

Plate three shows the front of the same fill. Here the log crib¬ 
bing has been displaced also, the centre portion of the logs being 
pushed out further than the ends.

CONSOLIDATION TESTS 

The apparatus for the consolidation tests consists of a brass ring 
enclosing the soil placed on top of a pourous plate. In turn the ring 
is placed under a porous plate which will loosely fit into the ring 
and compress the soil. A loading block is placed over the top porous 
plate and the load is applied by a jacking arrangement. An Ames dial 
is suitably fixed to the apparatus to register the movement of the soil 
sample under loads. 

A line sketch of this apparatus is shown in Figure 2 and a photo¬ 
graph in plated. 

TRIAXIAL TESTS 

The apparatus for Triaxial tests consists of a base plate with a 
pedestal in the centre for placing the sample, a loading block for 
transferring the loading to the sample and a piston for transferring 
the load from the loading yoke to the loading block. A Lucite cylinder 
and a top plate are incorporated, together with tie rods to give stab¬ 
ility to the apparatus and to allow air pressure to be applied to the 
chamber. Suitable connections are made for sample drainage, air pres¬ 
sure application and air release. An Ames dial is incorporated to 
register movements of the soil sample under load. 

A line sketch of this apparatus is shown in Figure I and a photo¬ 
graph in plate 4- 

SPECIFIC GRAVITY TESTS 


The apparatus for specific gravity te£ts consists of a calibrated 
flask, a rubber stopper with a hole drilled through it, suitable glass

and rubber hosing and an exhaust pump so that a vacuum may be applied 
to the sample. A thermometer calibrated to 0.1 degree centigrade is 
also included to register the temperature of the sample after the tests 
have been run. 

WATER EXTRACTION APPARATUS 

The soil sample is put into a flask. The flask is filled with toluene 
to cover the sample. The flask is connected by suitable hosing to lead 
to a graduated condensed vapour trap. A condenser is placed on top of 
the trap to condense the water and toluene vapours. The condenser has 
suitable connections to be cooled by water. 

A line sketch of this apparatus is shown in Figure 4. 

BITUMEN EXTRACTION APPARATUS 

A CHEMICAL PROCESS 

The soil sample is enclosed in a porous thimble which is enclosed 
in a Soxhlet. A condenser for condensing the vapours driven off is 
placed on top of the Soxhlet. The Soxhlet is placed over a flask which 
is half filled with benzene. Heat is applied to the bottom of the flask 
to vaporize the benzene. A suitable arrangement is made in the Soxhlet 
to allow the vapours to condense and fall back into the thimble. After 
sufficient condensed benzene has collected there is a suitable arrange¬ 
ment to siphon the benzene back to the flask. 

A line sketch is shown in Figure 3. 

B IGNITION PROCESS 

The sample is placed in a clay thimble. The thimble is then placed 
into an oven where there is sufficient temperature to burn off the bitu¬ 


men and water

(VI) Place 1.4” diameter disc over this surface. 

(VII) Place the plunger at the cutting edge of the sample tube and 
push the sample out the other end until 3 to 5§ inches of soil 
remains in the tube. Strike off the surplus with a straight edge. 

(VTII)Place one end of the membrane (Open at both ends) over the ped¬ 
estal in the base of the triaxial apparatus and secure with an 
elastic band. 

(IX) Place the sample supporting device around the pedestal of the 
apparatus holding the membrane inside. 

(X) Fold the membrane around the top of the supporting device and 
secure with an elastic band. 

(XI) Measure the length of the sample tube and the length of tube 
not filled by the sample. 

(XII) Weigh the sample tube and sample. 

(XHI)Place the end of the sample tube on top of the supporting de¬ 
vice with the cutting edge of the tube upwards.

Same as for Perpendicular to beds up to step (VII) Thenmeasure 
the length of tube not filled by the sample. Push out the sample and 
thoroughly remold the sample. Push the sample back into the tube in 
approximately equal increments until all the sample is again placed 
in the sample tube and it is again the same length as originally. 

Then carry on as for quick tests with sample perpendicular to the 
beds. 

gUICK TESTS -10° C 

All three types same as for room temperature. An additional 

step is placed in. After the sample is cut off to the desired length, 

it is measured and weighed in the sample tube. Then the sample is 

slowly pushed out of the tube. Care must be exercised to ensure that 

the sample is adequately supported during this operation. The samples 

are then put in the refrigerator and cooled to-10° C. The apparatus is 

set up as before. Then after cooling the sample (At least for 24 hours 
o 

at-10 C) it is placed in the membrane in the apparatus and the test 

procedure is run as before. Care must be exercised to keep the sample 

at 10° C either by running the test in the refrigerator or by some means 

o 

of keeping the apparatus at-10 C,

Immediately after applying the lateral air pressure centre the 
scale balance arm opposite the zerio index, add a 2 lb. load to the 
specimen, read the Ames dial and take dial readings at 6 seconds, 15 
seconds, 30 seconds, 1 minute, 2 minutes, etc., after applying the 
load as in the consolidation test.

CONSOLIDATION TEST_ 

(I) Record the consolidation ring number. Determine and record the 

weight of this ring to o.ol gms. 

(II) Determine and record the average height and average inside diameter 

of the ring to o.ol inches. 

(III) Record the machine data. Weigh the block and stone and ball to 

1 gram. 

(IV) Prepare the soil specimen as follows: 

(a) With the cutting ring obtain a specimen, approximately one half 
inches greater in height than the consolidation ring, from the 
mass of relatively undisturbed soil, either perpendicular or 
parallel to the beds as required. 

(b) Hie portion of the material protruding from the bottom surface 
of the cutting ring should be carefully trimmed until the sur¬ 
face of the specimen is flush with the surface of the cutting 
ring. A metal straight edge should be used to obtain the final 
surface of the specimen. 

(c) Place a glass plate under the consolidation ring and gently push 

the specimen from the cutting ring into the consolidation ring 
until the prepared surface of the specimen is contact with the 
glass plate. 

(d) Remove the cutting ring and, as before, trim the top surface of 
of the specimen flush with the upper surface of the ring. It is 

at this stage that the sample should be remolded as in the triaxial 
test and placed back into the ring if required or cooled to-10°C 
if required. 

(e) Place the other glass plate on top of the specimen and ring. De¬ 
termine and record the weight of the specimen and ring and plate 


to o.ol grams

(V) Perform the consolidation test on the soil specimen as follows: 

(a) Place one porous stone in the consolidation dish, then carefully 
centre the consolidation ring and specimen on this porous stone. 
Centre the second porous stone on the specimen, and then place 
the block and steel ball in position (See Fig, 2) 

(b) Place the dish in position such that the hole through the loading 
yoke is centred directly above the steel ball and not quite in 
contact, 

(c) Place the Ames dial in position so that the stem is resting on 
the steel ball. 

(d) Bring the loading yoke down so that it is just in contact with 
the steel ball. Centre the loading arm and read and record the 
Ames dial, 

(e) Place the first weight (10 grams in the tests run) on the scale 
pan, quickly and carefully balance the beam of the platform scale. 
Observe and record the dial readings after elapsed times of 6,10, 
16, 30 seconds, 1, 2 minutes, etc., continuously doubling the time 
interval between successive readings. 

(f) Make a progressive plat of dial readings vs. time on semi-logar¬ 
ithmic paper. 

(g) After primary consolidation has taken place and secondary time 
effect as indicated by the shape of the time curve (see figs 7 
to 12) has begun, apply the next increment of load (20 grams in 
the tests run) 

(h) Balance the platform scale and record the record, the dial read¬ 
ings as indicated in (e) Repeat the procedure from steps (e) to 
(g) 

(i) Each successive increment of load should be approximately equal to 
the previous total load on the specimen, (i.e. if the initial load

were 10 grams, the total loads on the scale pan would be 10,20,50,100, 
200, 400, 800, 1500, 3000, 5000 gms., etc.) 

SPECIFIC GRAVITY 

(I) Weigh out approximately 80 grams of oven dried seil (110°C) cooled 

in a desiccater, to 0.01 grams. 

(II) Transfer this to a clean, dry, calibrated volumetric flask with 

the aid of a funnel, and add 150 cc of distilled water. 

(III) Apply a vacuum to the flask for at least 20 minutes by means of 

a water jet or power driven pump. The air will be withdrawn more 
quickly if the flask is slightly rolled during the process. 

(IV) Carefully add enough distilled water to bring the level of the sus¬ 

pension to the bottom of the neck and again subject the flask to 
a vacuum to test for the complete removal of air. Although boil¬ 
ing will occur, the surface of the suspension will remain at sub¬ 
stantially the same elevation as before the vacuum was applied if 
no air is present, (it may rise in). If however, all the air 
has not been removed, it will be indicated by a rise in elevation 
of the suspension in the neck. If this occurs, steps 1, 2, and 5 
must be repeated. 

(v) After having de-aired the suspension, add distilled water until the 
level of the suspension is just below the calibration mark on the 
neck. Add the last few drops, a drop at a time, until the bottom 
of the meniscus is just eo-ineident with the calibration mark. 

(VT) After making sure that the outside of the flask is dry and that no 
water is adherfcing to the inside of the neck above the graduation, 
weigh the flask plus suspension to 0.01 grams. Record this weight 
as W bws. 

(VII) Immediately after weighing, determine the temperature of the sus-

Record this temperature to 0.1° C. 

(VIII) Pack off and record the weight of bottle and water (W bw ) for 

the temperature recorded in step 7 from the flask calibration curve.

ESTOAGTION__OF BITOMEN MD WATER 
(Under the direction of Dr. D. S. Pasternack) 

A EXTRACTION OF WATER 

(I) weight out approximately 100 grams of sample to 0.01 grams 

(II) Place in a flask and add 100 cc of toluene. 

(III) Fit the condenser to the flask and start coal water flowing 
through the condenser. 

(IV) Apply heat to the bottom of the flask. The toluene will be 
driven off carrying with it the water of the sample. The con¬ 
densed vapours run into a graduated trap and water being heavier 
than toluene will sink to the bottom. 

(V) Continue the process until all the water has been distilled over. 

(VI) Read off the volume of water in the graduated trap. 

(VII) From this the percentage of water may be calculated. 

B CHEMICAL PROCESS 

(I) Weigh out a porous alundrum thimble to 0.01 gms. 

(II) Put approximately 35 grams of sample into the thimble and re¬ 
weigh to 0.001 gms. From these weights the weight of the sample 
may be determined. 

(III) Fit the thimble into a SOXHLET 

(IV) Fill a flask approximately half full of benzene, add a glass bead 
to avoid bumping and then fit the Soxhlet to the flask (see Fig 3) 

(V) Start cold water running through the condenser. 

(VI) Apply heat by means of a bunsen burner to the bottom of the flask. 
The benzene will vapourize, the vapours will rise into the SOXHLET 
and be condensed in the condenser and fall back into the thimble. 
After the condensed benzene has risen to a sufficient height in 
the SOXHLET it will siphon back to the flask. This siphoned ben¬ 


zene will carry some of the bitumen with it to the beaker

(VII) Keep the process going until the benzene around the thimble 
does not become discolored. At this stage all the bitumen will 
have been extracted from the tar sand. This process will take 
3 to 4 hours. 

(VIII) Turn off the heat and allow the apparatus to cool. 

(IX) Dry the thimble and contents in the oven and cool in a des«Ccator. 

(X) Reweighi the thimble. This will give the weight of bitumen and 
water extracted and the percent bitumen may thus be calculated. 

This gives the most accurate value for the bitumen content. 

C IGNITION PROCESS 

(I) Weigh the thimble to 0.001 gms. Add approximately 20 gms. of sample 

•and reweigh to 0.001 gms. This gives the weight of sample, 

(II) Put the thimble into a muffle furnace and heat to 725°C for 5 
hours until the bitumen has burned off.

CONSOLIDATION THEORY 


When a sample of soil is placed under a stress its volume 
decreases. There may be three factors accounting for this volume 
decrease: 

(i) Compression of solid matter. 

(ii) Compression of water and air within the voids. 

(iii) An escape of air and water from the voids. 

Since solid matter and water are relatively incompressible 
the decrease of volume, if completely saturated, may be considered 
as due entirely to an escape of water from the voids. 

In partially saturated samples the compression of the sample 
may be due to a small amount of compressible gas within the specimen 
even though there is no escape of pore water. 

These considerations indicate that the compressibility of 
the soil is not governed by compressibility of the individual soil 
particles but rather by the manner in which the grains can deform and 
shift their positions. Thus compressibility of a soil is governed 
by the rigidity of the soil skeleton. The rigidity, in turn, is 
governed by structural arrangement of the particles and, in fine¬ 
grained soils, on the degree to which the adjacent particles are 
banded together. 

For saturated soils compressions are always associated with 
escape of pore water. This compression which involves an escape of pore 
water and a gradual compression is called consolidation. Thus we see 
that consolidation involves three processes of drainage, compression 
and stress transfer.

Fig. a. Fig. b. 

A typical pressure versus void ratio curve for sand is seen 
in Fig. a. For a typical sand the percent compression under a given 
load increment is shown in Fig. b. We see that nearly all the com¬ 
pression takes place in the first minute or two after application of 
load. The time lag in sands is largely frictional. There is not a 
uniform and smooth rearrangement of grains but rather a successive, 
irregular, localized building up and breaking down of stresses in grain 
groups. 

For clays a typical pressure versus void ratio curve is shown 
in Fig. c, to a natural scale and in Fig. d. to a logarithmic 
scale. A typical time curve for pressure increment is shown in Fig. e. 

As shown in Fig. dAthe compression curve is approximately a straight line.

This straight line may be represented by an empirical 


relationship 


where 


e = e c - C c log 10 1L 

i O 

e c is the void ratio at pressure P 0 
C c is the slope of the straight portion 

of the curve and is called compression index. 


The time lag due to compression of clays is of two parts: 

(i) The hydrodynamic lag due to time required for escape of pore water, 
(ii) Plastic lag. 

The hydrodynamic lag is well understood and is basically due 
to the viscosity retarding the flow of water. The plastic lag is only 
partially understood. It is rather complex and is only partially under¬ 
stood. It is due to the plastic action in adsorbed water near grain-to- 
grain contacts or points of nearest approach to contact. 

The theory of consolidation presented by Terzaghi presents a 
good understanding of hydrodynamic lag but does not recognize the existance 
of plastic lag. Thus the theory which will be presented next can only be 
looked upon as a limited representation of the true action of clay under¬ 
going consolidation. 

The simplifying assumptions upon which the Terzaghi theory of 
consolidation is based are as follows: 

(a) The soil is homogeneous 

(b) Complete saturation of the soil 

(c) Negligible compressibility of soil grains and water 

(d) Action of infinitesimal masses no different from that of 
larger representative masses

In Fig. f. is shown a sketch of clay layer overlain by a 
permeable sand and underlain by an impermeable base. With hydraulic 
equilibrium the water would rise In a piezometric tube above section 
mn to a height (H ■} h Q - z) to the water table. The neutral stress 
is thus equal to 

«w = (H 4 h 0 - z) w 

By plotting this stress horizontally from a reference line 
aj b the line aj c is obtained. 

The total normal stress is equal to the weight of the 

clay, sand and water above the section mn . 

The effective normal stress is 





























Now if we apply a pressure P^ per unit area over the whole 

area the total normal stress on mn is increased by , The total 

normal stress increase is represented by area a c e d whose width 

ad = ce = P-^ , The applied pressure P^ is called consolidating 

pressure or consolidating stress. 

At the instant the consolidating stress is applied the neutral 

stress on section mn is increased from u^ to (u^, | ?]_) • Hence the 

entire surcharge is carried by neutral stress at the instant of application 

and thus this surcharge is called the excess hydrostatic pressure. The 

water will then rise in our piezometric tube a distance h^ I 1 above 

w 


the water table. 

As water is squeezed out the excess hydrostatic pressure de¬ 
creases and the water level in the piezometric tube goes down. If at time 
t the excess hydrostatic pressure equals u the water stands at a height 
above the water table equal to 


h = ,u_ 

^ w 

Finally when the excess hydrostatic pressure becomes zero the 

piezometric level drops to the level of the water table. 

At any time the sum of the added effective normal stress 

P - P q produced by the surcharge and the excess hydrostatic pressure u 

is equal to P, or _ _ 

P 1 = u 4 (P - P 0 ) 

or u = P n - P + P„

Although the effect of plastic resistance is readily seen 
after primary compression it is also present in the primary compression. 

The forces supporting a load on a soil are intergranular 
pressure and plastic resistance. The intergranular pressure is built 
up in a relatively short time but time is required for plastic resistance 
to be overcome. However, as time goes on other effects such as banding 
between the grains and structural change affect the action of the soil. 


Thus we see that compression of a soil is made up of two parts. 


The first is primary compression which takes place at relatively high 
speeds. The secondary compression takes place at relative^ low speeds 
to overcome plastic resistance. The speed of compression during secondary 
compression continually decreases, plastic resistance becomes continually 
smaller and there is a steady approach toward the static case line as in 

Fig. h. 


Fig. h. line CD represents the intergranular pressure and 


AB the total stress. Depending on speed of loading AB will be to the 
right of CD . With a load of applied the intergranular pressure 

will be equal to ef and the plastic resistance will equal fg . 
fg will decrease to zero as rate of loading is decreased.

STRENGTH THEORY 


Considering a small unit of mass of soil under stress there 
will be two stresses acting on every plane, normal stress and shearing 
stress. A principal plane, however, is a plane under which no shearing 
stresses are acting. Three principal planes can exist at, any point. 
These three planes always intersect each other at ninety degrees. 

In Fig. a. point 0 represents any point within a stressed 
mass. OA represents the major principal plane on which the stress 
acting is the major principal stress <3“ j and OB represents the minor 
principal plane on which the stress acting is the minor principal stress

All details pertaining to stress at a point ma 3 ^ be plotted on a 
Mohr diagram. If a plot of shearing stresses vs. normal stresses is made 
and If points are plotted to represent stress co-ordinates for all 
possible values of 0 as given by equations (i) and (ii) above, it is 
found that the locus of these poinds is a circle as shown in Fig. b.

A number of basic relationships may be observed directly from 

a Mohr diagram. 

(1) The maximum shearing stress, often called the principal shearing 
stress, has magnitude of -g-(cT^ ~ ^ 3 ) which equals the radius of 
the Mohr circle. The principal shearing stress occurs on planes 
with & values of 45 degrees. 

(2) Shearing stresses on planes at right angles to each other are 
numerically equal but of opposite sign. These stresses are called 
conjugate shearing stresses. 

(3) The resultant stress on any plane has a magnitude expressed by 
r<f 2 + -r 2 and has an abliquity equal to tan 

(4) The maximum of all the possible abliquity angles on the various 

planes is designated by (f) . This angle may be constructed by 

drawing a line which passes through the origin and which is tangent 
to the Mohr circle. The co-ordinates of the point of tangency are 
stresses on the plane of maximum abliquity, and it is obvious that 
the shear on this plane is less than the principal shear. 




















Among the commonly used relationships derived from the Mohr circle are:

Both the application of load and subsequent application of 
shear stress produce a change of void ratio in the sample. There are 
three methods of testing soils. First there is the slow test by which 
the load, and, subsequently, the shearing forces are applied so sloY/ly 
that the water content of the sample can adapt itself to the change in 
stress. In consolidated-quick tests complete consolidation under the 
vertical load is followed by shear at constant water content. In quick 
tests the water content remains unchanged during the application of both 
the vertical load and the shearing force. 

If shear stresses, S , are plotted against pressure, P , a 
straight line is obtained. This line may be represented by the equation 

S = P tan 4) 

The angle & is called the angle of internal friction, and tan $ is the 
coefficient of internal friction. For a given sand <p increases with 
relative density. 

The individual grains of some sands are interconnected by minute 
patches of cementing material. The relation between normal stress P and 
shearing resistance S for such sands is given by S = c + P tan Cp 
The value of c is called the cohesion.

If the equilibrium of a large body of saturated fine sand is 
disturbed such as by rapid drawdown then the adjustment of water content 
in the mass lags behind the change in stress. If the lag is negligible 
then failure conditions in the sand will be associated with slow shear 
strength on saturated sand. If the lag is perceptible failure conditions 
will associate themselves with the quick consolidated strength of the sand. 

Under quick consolidated tests if the sand has a tendency to 
void ratio decrease then the decreased void ratio will be associated with 
increased pore water pressure. Hence the quick consolidated shear strength 
will be smaller than for slow tests. If the void ratio increases during 
quick consolidated tests then the shearing resistance will be greater than 
for slow tests. According to Terzaghi & Peck "Soil Mechanics in Engineering 
Practice" p. 84 the value of for quick consolidated tests is approx¬ 
imately two-thirds that for slow and that it can never be less than jg . 

Soils of low permeability such as silts and silty sand are likely 
to fail in the field under conditions similar to those under which quick 

consolidated tests have been made. Values given by the same source as 

, o 

above for f range up to 35 for dense state* 

From the same source the values given for a remolded clay range 
from 28° to 30° with exceptionally low values of 20° for the slow test and 
for the quick consolidated tests the values range from 14° to 20° with 
exceptionally low values of 12° . 

A remolded clay loses its cohesion on remolding. However, by 
subjecting it to precompression pressure it regains cohesion. This cohesion 
is not constant but varies as the precompression pressure.

A plot of principal stress versus axial strain will show that 
the maximum value of <T ^ does not increase with strain. At some 
point all the intergranular forces are acting and the shearing stress 
is equal to the shearing resistance. Beyond this point the stress drops 
off with increasing strain. A sketch of this relation is shown in Fig. c. 



Fig. c. 

Loading the mass of soil to failure will not produce uniform 
shearing strains because of the non-homogeneous nature of all soils. 
Shearing stresses will be concentrated at points of maximum strains 
causing rupture to start at these points* The rupture will progress 
throughout the mass and finally cause failure of the mass as a whole. 

The degree of this progressive action may be seen from the stress-strain 
curve. If the peak point is sharp, progressive action occurs to a much 
greater degree than it does when the curve is flat and shows little change 
in strength over a strain range of several percent near the peak point. 

To compare soils of different properties or the action of the 
same soils under different conditions the initial tangent modulus (line 
OA in Fig. a.) may be compared. For remolded soils the values of initial

in the undistrubed state. The amount of this decrease will depend 
upon the degree of sensitivity of the soil. Also these values will 
increase with increasing values of confining pressure. 




























CONSISTENCY AND SENSITIVITY OF CLAYS 


Cohesive soils are generally classified as hard, stiff, medium 
and soft as to consistency. The qualitative measure of this property is 
by the unconfined compressive strength of the soil. 

Clays that have been remolded at unaltered water content 
generally become softer. This softening process is probably due to two 
causes: a breakdown of the arrangement of the soil particles and destruc¬ 
tion of the arrangement of the molecules in the adsorbed layers. This last 
part is probably regained with time after remolding has ceased but the first 
part is more than likely permanently lost. 

The term sensitivity of a clay indicates the effect of remolding 
on the consistency of the clay. The degree of sensitivity is different for 
different clays. Highly sensitive clays may be turned into a mass of 
highly lubricated chunks capable of flowing down a gentle slope by a slide. 
Change in consistency of a clay is always associated with change in perme¬ 
ability. 

The degree of sensitivity S r p is a ratio expressed as 

S s unconfined compressive strength undisturbed 
unconfined compressive strength remolded 

Most clays have a value of S^ ranging bet?/een 2 and 4* Sen¬ 
sitive clays have values from 4 to 3 and extrasensitive clays with well 
developed skeleton structure are known to have values of Srp above 8 ,

SUMMARY OF RESULTS OF CO-OPERATIVE SPEAR RESEARCH 


It has been found that soils generally, if based on the results 
of triaxial tests, will fall in one of three groups. These are: 

(1) Cohesive soils - 

i.e. sands, gravels, silts, etc. and all soils which do not form 
hard lumps on drying 

(2) Saturated Homogeneous Clays - 

They consist predominately of undisturbed sedimentary clays from 
below the zone of weathering. Term homogeneous refers to the 
structure of the clay as contrasted to the heterogeneous structure 
of some residual clays. Clays of this type act as saturated clays 
even though the voids have as much as 5$ air or gas. 

(3) Partially Saturated Cohesive Soils 

This type includes all artificially compacted cohesive soils even 
if saturated, and natural cohesive soils with a heterogeneous 
structure. Bituminous aggregate mixtures also act similarly to 
soils of this group under triaxial compression. 


Results of Tests on Cohesionless Soils 

The major variables affecting the strengths of soils of this type 

are: (a) The soil density 

(b) The stress conditions within the soil 

The maximum strength of cohesionless soil is usually expressed 
in terms of (J) , the angle of internal friction, on the assumption that the 
maximum shearing strength is a linear function of the normal stress acting 
on the plane of shear. Tan <p is the coefficient of internal friction 
as it is the factor by which the normal stress must be multiplied to obtain 
the shearing strength. The angle as obtained from the test results are 
actually on the unsafe side as this angle is greater than that computed 


from field conditions

The intercept at zero normal stress should not be included 

in strength results. The value obtained from plots of are governed 

by the minor principal stress, the size of the test specimen, the test 
apparatus and accessories, and the method of testing. In addition it has 
been found that varies as the density of the soil. 

Stress-strain curves obtained from trlaxial tests are probably 
not true stress-strain relationships because of surface effects such as 
interlocking of sand grains. This interlocking causes an effect similar 
to true cohesion and varies with density. 

Results on Saturated Homogeneous Slavs . 

Under normal pressure, changes in intergranular pressure cause 
simultaneous changes in water content and shear resistance. The external 
and intergranular pressures are equal only when time for complete consol¬ 
idation has been allowed. 

The maximum principle stress difference (^ - <r^), usually called 
the compressive stress, depends only on the water content at maximum stress 
and is independent of the pore water pressure or test method. A plot of 
water content at end of test versus logarithm of principle stress difference 
is a curve beginning at the unconfined compressive stress and the natural 
water content and runs roughly parallel to the semi-logarithmic pressure 
water content curve plotted from a standard consolidation test of the 
same clay. A plot of this type is'shown below.

If these curves hold true then they express completely the 
shearing properties of a saturated homogeneous clay. The completely 
drained strengths can be found from these curves -without performing the 
slow tests* 

Results on Partially Saturated Cohesive Soils 

Soils falling in this group are distinguished by the following 
three test shearing characteristics: 

(a) In quick tests the compressive strength is a function of lateral 
pressure. 

(b) Very little strength difference is observed in the results of quick 
and quick consolidated tests. 

(c) The relation between compressive strength and water content at the 
end of test varies with the minor principal stress. 

Four major variables affect the strengths of soils within this 
group. These are: 

(a) The minor principal stress 

(b) The dry soil density 

(c) The water content 

(d.) The degree of saturation 

Test results indicate that strengths increase with minor principal 
stress and dry soil density, and decrease with increasing saturation.

PLASTIC EQUILIBRIUM 


If we consider an element of soil within a homogeneous 
. mass of soil with a plane surface we will find that the ratio of the 
vertical pressure on the base of the element to the horizontal pressure 
-acting on its side is approximately the same for every point of the mass. 
This ratio ^h = K 0 is called the coefficient of earth pressure at 

rest. 


Now if the mass of soil is allowed to expand or is compressed 

to just to the point of incipient failure we have plastic equilibrium in 

the soil mass. In the first case ^h ; K, and in the second case the 

^v 

ratio is equal to Kp . , the active Eankine state, is not equal to 

Kp , the passive Rankine state. Further, in both cases it will be found 

that failure occurs along two sets of failure planes. In the first case 

the failure planes rise at (45 4 ^)° to the horizontal and in the second 

2 

to the horizontal. 

Consider Fig. a. The unit of mass is of 
unity cross sect5.on. The depth of the 
mass is z . Thus in both cases the 
vertical stress is equal to the 

unit weight of the soil multiplied by 
the depth z . 


case they rise at (45 - £)°

In the active Rankine state the horizontal pressure on the 
element is reduced. The relation between horizontal and vertical stresses 
is given by 

<r = tan 2 (45 - %) = -t z tan"' (45 - $) = iz , _JL 

A V 2 2 N,p 


where is the flow value 

The ratio ^ . tan 2 (4$ .<(>)= JL_ 

is independent of depth. Hence the normal stress on vertical sections 
Increases like a hydrostatic pressure in simple proportion to depth. 

In the passive Rankine state the horizontal pressure on the 
element is increased. The relation between horizontal and vertical stresses 
is given by 

<f = cr tan 2 (45 4 i) = 1 z tar/’ (45 4 -&) = m z N

The ratio

surface

Behind a retaining wall the stress in the mass of soil will 
be in the active state and the pressure on the wall will decrease to the 
active Rankine value at the point of plastic equilibrium if the wall yields. 
On the other hand, if the wall is forced against the fill the mass of soil 
will pass into the passive Rankine state when the point of plastic 
equilibrium is reached.

STABILITY OF SLOPES 

The average shearing resistance w S ,f per unit of area of 
potential surface of sliding in a homogeneous soft clay is equal to one- 
half the unconfined compressive stress, q u , of the clay. 

S = i q u = C 

If S is known, the critical height H c of a slope of a given 
slope angle $ can be expressed by the equation: 

H c | 

N c is a stability factor and is a pure number. Its value 

O 

depends only on @ and on the depth factor n^ which is a ratio of the 
distance to the top of the slope from the firm base on which the clay rests x 
to the height of the fill or cut. If slope failure occurs, the critical 
circle is usually a toe circle which passes through the toe of the slope. 

If the firm base is located a short distance below the level of the toe of 
the slope, the critical circle may be a slope circle tangent to the firm 
base and intersecting the slope above the toe. If a base failure occurs, 
the critical circle is known as a mid-point circle, because its center is 
located on- a vertical line through the mid-point m of the slope. The mid¬ 
point circle is tangent to the firm base. 

The position of the critical circle with reference to a given 
slope depends upon the slope angle $ and the depth factor n^ • Fig. a. 
contains a summary of the results of the pertinent theoretical investigations.

RESULTS 

CONSOLIDATION TESTS 

(a) PRESSURE VOID RATIO CURVES 

In the pressure void ratio curves it is seen that the coefficient 
of compressibility of the three types of samples increased as the temp¬ 
erature decreased. It is also seen that as temperature decreased the 
start of the virgin part of the curves (the breaking pressure in the 
summary) was shifted to the right but that the curved portions of the 
consolidation curves are approximately parallel up to the point where 
the curve begins to straighten out. 

(b) TIME-SETTLM/1FNT CURVES 

From the time settlement curves (Graphs 7 to 12) it is seen that 
for the colder temperature the pressure held without a break in the curve 
is greater than for the corresponding test at room temperature. The 
slopes of the primary parts of the curves are steeper in the sample run 
at room temperature than those run at 10° C. For the same pressures the 
secondary compression starts later in the cold samples than for corres¬ 
ponding sample tested at room temperature but the slopes of the secondary 
compression are steeper for the samples run at the colder temperature. 

For room temperature tests the secondary compression parts of the curve 
are nearly horizontal while they are quite steep at the colder temperature. 

It is also to be noticed that there is a greater scattering of 
points from the smooth fitting curve for the samples run at 10° C. 

Thus we may summarize the results: 

1. Pressures held without curve break - greater with colder 
samples. 

2. Primary consolidation curves for some pressures - steeper

at warm temperatures.

TRIAXIAL TESTS 


(a) ANGLE Off INTERNAL FRICTION 

The angle of internal friction for the quick tests increased 
over a range of l|- to 5 degrees as the temperature decreased to 10°C 
from room temperature* For the quick consolidated tests the difference 
is not so uniform as the temperature is decreased. For the samples taken 
perpendicular to the beds the angle of internal friction actually decreased 
at the lower temperature. However for the samples taken perpendicular to 
the beds the angle increased 1-J- degrees for the lower temperature and near¬ 
ly five degrees at the lower temperature for remolded samples. 

The same pattern for quick consolidated tests is followed when the 
results are obtained from the "Casagrande 2 curve Working Hypothesis”. 

There is some variation but it is slight and not regular. Some of fric¬ 
tion angles from the two curve hypothesis are up to J degree larger than *tb 
from the direct results and the maximum variation the other way is 1 degree 
smaller than from the direct results. 

The angle of internal friction for the slow test as obtained from 

\L 

the 2 curve hypothesis is up to l|y degree larger than the quick consol¬ 
idated results obtained the same way. There is one a half degree smaller 
and two the same as for quick consolidated but on the average the friction 
angles for the two tests are approximately equal with the slow test angle 
slightly larger. 

Excepting for the remolded test run at 10° G the angle of internal 
friction is 1 greater for the quick test than for the quick consolidated. 

They are from degree up to degree larger with an average of about 1-J- 
to 2 degrees larger. 

The 2 curve method gave friction angles slightly less than for the 
quick test. However one is \ degree larger and another about 4 degrees 
larger for the slow tests as compared to the quick.The largest angles

of friction angles were obtained in all cases for the samples taken 
perpendicular to the beds. At room temperature the remolded sample 
had a slight friction angle but it did increase for the lower temp¬ 
erature. 

(b) COHESION 

For the quick test the average value for "C" appears to be in 
the neighborhood of 0.08 (tg/cm^. Two of the values are 0.12 and one 

p 

is at 0.03 ftg/cm , but the remainder are at 0.08 

For the quick consolidated test the values for cohesion appear 
to be slightly larger. The average value is in the range of 0.10 to 0.11 
ftg/cm^. The two major different ones are 0.21 and 0.05 ftg/cm^. From the 
two curve hypothesis the values of cohesion are smaller than for the direct 
test results. About 0.07 fe/cm . appears to be an average value but the 
results are quite scattered. 

This same scattering is evident in the slow test results as the 
quick consolidated when obtained from the two curve hypothesis. In the 
range of 0.10 feg/eM^ appears to be about an average value. 

It seems to be that temperature does not have an apparent appreciable 
effect on the values for cohesion. The method of testing seems to govern 
the values for this factor. 

(e) STRESS-STRAIN CURVES 

The results of values of modulus of deformation do not appear to 
be very conclusive or regular. There is generally an increase of the val¬ 
ue of deformation modulus with increasing lateral pressure for all types 
of test and for the three types of samples at both temperatures. 

In the quick tests the modulus of deformation appear to decrease 
with the lower temperatures for the samples taken perpendicular^, to the 
beds and also for samples taken parallel to the beds. However, the re-

verse seems to be true for the remolded case. 

For the quick consolidated tests there is not too much consistency- 
in the results except for the remolded case. As in the quick tests the 
colder temperature gives the highest values for the modulus of deforma¬ 
tion especially- at the greater lateral pressures. Forthe other two test 
types, the results appear to be inconclusive. 

SENSITIVITY 

Sensitivity increases with decreasing temperature. This is quite 
plainly seen in both the values taken from the direct test results and 
from the Casagrande 2 curve hypothesis. There is not much agreement how¬ 
ever between the results obtained for the direct results and from the work¬ 
ing hypothesis method. 

SPECIFIC GRAVITY 

The specific gravity obtained from the non-ignited, chemically 
extracted material appears to be very low and irregular. That from the 
sand with the bitumen burned, gives much better results.

DISCUSSION OF RESULTS 

It has been shown in the consolidation theory that there is 
a time lag in the consolidation due to plastic flow. This flow 
has been associated with adsorbed films of water around the indiv¬ 
idual soil particles. This layer, which we will call the ’’activated 
layer” is only a few molecules thick and does not possess the pro¬ 
perties of pure water. It is quite viscous but its thickness de¬ 
pends on a number of properties of the soil such as the mineral 
constituent of the soil particles, the size of the particles, water 
composition, etc. However the viscosity of the activated layer is not 
uniform throughout. Gradually as the distance from the surface of the 
soil particle is increased the water takes on more and more the pro¬ 
perties of ordinary water until at some distance (several molecules 
in thickness) the water is unaffected by the presence of the soil par¬ 
ticle and behaves as ordinary water. 

If we have a saturated mass of soil the rate at which the or¬ 
dinary water leaves the soil when subjected to stress is dependent only 
upon the permeability of the soil and settlement will follow the theory 
as presented by Terzaghi, which takes into account the viscosity of the 
ordinary free water. However when the free water between the grains is 
squeezed out and the activated layers come into contact the settlement 

"f he 

no longer conforms to theory because of variation inAproperties^of the 
activated layer to free water. Since the viscosity of activated layer is 
much larger the time required for the complete settlement will be much 
longer than if just ordinary water were present. 

For a uniform large grained sand the thickness of this activated 
layer as compared to the diameter of the particles is so small as to be 
negligible. In this case, the presence of the activated layer is unim¬ 
portant when considering settlement and settlement will generally follow 


the theory. In a fine grained soil such as a clay, however, the thick-

ness of the activated layer is quite appreciable when compared to the 

size of the soil particles. In this case the activated layer cannot be 
0 

ignored when settlement is considered. 

With the McMurray tar sands the situation is altered by the pre¬ 
sence of oil. In this case the film surrounding the soil grains is not 
water but bitumen. This is a very heavy, very viscous oil. It is pro¬ 
posed that the bitumen acts as the water with its two phases with the pos¬ 
sibility of the activated layer becoming thicker than is the case for 
water. Further with decreasing temperatures the viscosity of the oil 
is increased and the thickness of the activated layer is in effect in¬ 
creased due to the general increase in viscosity of the oil. 

When subjected to stress due to a building or fill or some other 
cause the soil settles. If the unit stress is very small the settlement 
may be negligible. This is due to the viscosity of the oil. The oil 
films around two adjoining soil particles will have sufficient strength 
i.e. shearing resistance to withstand'the stress applied. However, at 
sufficiently large stress the oil films will be mewed aside and even¬ 
tually the activated layers ¥/ill come into contact. Then because of 
the increased viscosity of the activated layer there should be some 
secondary compression. 

When the mass of soil is cooled to a lower temperature the act¬ 
ivated layers become thicker and the viscosity of the free oil is in¬ 
creased. Now subjecting this cooled mass to stress, the oil film of 
free oil will be able to withstand greater pressures before allowing the 
soil to settle the same amount as before in the same time. Further at 
sufficient stress the oil film in this cooled state will be more brittle. 

Thus under the action of a great enough load there will be a tearing 
apart of the films and there should be some irregularity in the time 
settlement curves. Further because of the increased thickness of the

activated layer, which controls secondary compression, there should be 
a greater slope in the time settlement curve during secondary compression 
than when the same soil is subjected to the same stress in the warmer 
state. 

CONSOLIDATION TESTS 

TIME SETTM.1ENT CURVES 

From the time-settlement curves (grajahs 7 to 12 incl.) we see that 
at lower temperatures the soil is able to withstand a greater pressure 
without appreciable settlement than is the case for the same conditions 
but at a warmer temperature. This is due to the increased viscosity of 
the bitumen. The bitumen gives the soil an apparently increased shear¬ 
ing resistance. When the stress becomes sufficient to give us primary and 
secondary compression, the break in the curve is shifted to the right at 
the colder temperature. This is due to the retarding action of the bitumen 
at increased viscosity. Also due to this increased viscosity is the fact 
that once primary compression starts it will take longer for the grains 
to come to their final resting place under the applied stress. Thus the 
slope of the primary compression parts of the curve will not be as steep 
as that for corresponding conditions at room temperature. 

Thus we have seen that increased viscosity has a retarding effect 
on settlement. Once secondary compression starts it is seen that at room 
temperatures the slopes of the secondary compression parts of the curves 
are not large and hence the thickness of this activated layer is not very 
appreciable at room temperatures. 

At 10° G there is an appreciable slope to the secondary parts of 
the curve. This gives support to the assumption that the activated layer 
is, in effect, increased. This apparent increase may be actually an in¬ 
creased thickness in the activated layer at the colder temperature or it 
may be that the properties of the activated layer are changed to such an 
extent at the colder temperature, it acts as if it had an increased thick-

ness. In any event, it takes longer for the adsorbed layer to be 
pushed aside at the colder temperature and the slope of the secondary 
portion of the time settlement curve becomes appreciable. 

Another point to be noticed in these time settlement curves is 
the fact that there is a greater scattering in the points from the best 
fitting line at the colder,temperature than at the warmer. This is due to 
the tearing action. In the cooler samples there are concentrations of 
stresses. These concentrations cause the bitumen film(not the activated 
layer) between two grains to be torn. Then we get a progressive failure 
of the films and the time settlement curves are somewhat jagged if all 
the points were drawn together. After one progressive failure has fin¬ 
ished, we begin a second stress concentration and the process repeats 
itself. For the samples run at room temperatures, the bitumen is not 
so viscous and hence it is able to flow more freely than at the colder 
temperature. Thus we do not get this build up of stress concentrations 
to the same amount and the sand grains are able to move more freely to 
their final resting place under the applied stress. 

Thus we see from the foregoing that the bitumen imparts an apparent 
shearing resistance to the soil and that this apparent shearing resistance 
is increased as the temperature is decreased. 

B PRESSURE - VOID RATIO GITRYES 

An analysis of pressure void ratio curves (graphs 1 to 6 incl.) 
shows that the co-efficient of compressibility increases for each type of 
sample as the temperature decreased. It is also seen that as the temper¬ 
ature decreased the breaking pressure is shifted to the right. This ap¬ 
parent increased strength of the soil at lower temperatures is due to 
the increased viscosity of the bitumen as the temperature is lowered. At 
room temperature the shearing resistance of the oil is less than the re¬ 
sistance of the oil at a colder temperature. Thus as the temperature

is decreased the oil is able to withstand greater pressures before 
commencing the straight portion of the curve. At the warmer temperature 
once the breaking pressure has been reached the shearing resistance of 
the oil is exceeded and the settlement takes on a straight line relation- 

lc; gcf' f'hrrt 

ship to the .lariiter of the pressure. However the oil still being present 
around the films still exerts an influence on the rate of settlement. It 
has a retarding effect and gives a greater slope to virgin part of the com¬ 
pression curve than if the oil were absent. At 10° G though, we see that 
the slopeis steeper. This is due to the tearing action and the colder 
temperature. Once the breaking pressure has been exceeded, we get this 
build up stress and local tearing of the film bonds between the grains. 

This leads to a steeper slope. 

It is noticed that for corresponding conditions the samples taken 
parallel to the beds are less compressible than samples taken perpendicular 
to the beds. This fact has been observed in Terzaghi and Peck "Soil Mech¬ 
anics in Engineering Practive" Page 60. It is also to be noticed that 
the co-efficient of compressibility is less for the remolded case than 
for either samples taken parallel or perpendicular to the beds. That 
is, if confined, remolded samples will settle less than samples taken 
parallel or perpendicular to beds. 

Another interesting phenomena in these consolidation tests is 
the fact that the breaking pressure is least for samples taken perpen¬ 
dicular to the beds and greatest for the remolded samples under similar 
temperature conditions. Thus, if the remolded sample is confined it will 
compress less under a given stress than will a sample taken perpendicular 
to the beds in the undisturbed condition.

TRIAXIAL TESTS 
A ANGLE OF INTERAL FRICTION 

Generally speaking, the angle of internal friction increased for 
the same sample conditions and the same type of test as the temperature 
decreased from room temperature to-10° C. This increase in the friction 
angle is due to the increased viscosity of the bitumen itself. With in¬ 
creased viscosity the bitumen has an increased shearing resistance. Thus 
the angle of internal friction of the soil mass is increased as the temp¬ 
erature is decreased. For the quick tests the magnitude of this increase 
is from 1-|- to 3 degrees. It seems that a 2 degree increase is about av¬ 
erage for the range in the temperature difference. However, other fac¬ 
tors such as arrangement of particles themselves, accidental stress con¬ 
centrations in the samples themselves under stress, probably have an af¬ 
fect on this increase. For the quick tests it is to be noted that the 
samples taken perpendicular to the beds have the greatest angle of inter¬ 
nal friction. For the remolded samples taken at room temperature, the 
friction angle is very low, being of the order of 45 minutes. For samples 
taken parallel to the beds the friction angle is also very low at room 
temperature and is equal to 1 degree. The sample taken perpendicular to 
the beds and run at a test temperature of room temperature has the greatest 
angle of internal friction. It is of the order of 6-g- degrees. For the 
tests run at 10° G the sample taken perpendicular to the beds increases 
by 1-g? degrees to 8 degrees, the sample taken parallel to the beds (which 
shows the greatest increase) rises to 4 degrees, while the remolded rise 
to degrees. Thus we see for the quick tests the increased viscosity 
of the bitumen gives an increased angle of internal friction to the samples 
tested. 

For the quick consolidated tests, the results for the angles of 
internal friction are generally smaller than those obtained for the quick 
tests. This is due to the displacement of the grains during the consol-

idation. During the period of consolidation, the grains become displaced 
and move relative to one another. Also during this period the films 
become distorted and lose some of their shearing resistance. Hence we 
get a lower value for the angle of internal friction. With a temperature 
decrease the friction angles increase as in the case for the quick tests 
due to the increased viscosity of the oil films. Once again the greatest 
friction angles are obtained for samples taken perpendicular to the beds. 

As is the case for the quick tests there is little difference in the angle 
for the remolded case and samples taken parallel to the beds. However 
once again other factors will also affect the friction angles. The re¬ 
sults obtained from the ff Casagrande two curve hypothesis” compare fav¬ 
orably with those obtained from the quick tests. Also from this two 
curve hypothesis the slow test friction angles were obtained. Generally 
they appear to be slightly larger than those obtained for the quick con¬ 
solidated tests and also the effect of temperature difference is as before. 

B COHESION 

For the quick tests the average value for the cohesion is in the 
neighborhood of 0.08 |tg/cm.^ There does not appear to be any appreciable 
difference in the values for cohesion as the temperature is lowered. No 
doubt the increased viscosity of the bitumen at lower temperatures does 
affect the cohesion. In fact it should make it larger. But other factors 
evidently fenter into this quaniityto cancel it out. 

For the quick consolidated tests the value ranges from 0.10 to 0.11 
kg/cm . This is due to the consolidating effect. Since the soil is not 
saturated there will be some grains coming into more intimate contact dur¬ 
ing the consolidation process. This will give increased values for cohesion. 
Once again there is no uniform increase in this factor as the temperature 
is decreased. Probably for the same reasons that the quick test results

idated test results, 

G, STHESS-STRhIN CURVES 

The results obtained for the modulus of deformation do not appear 
to be very regular or conclusive. As expected there is a general increase 
in the value of deformation modulus with increasing lateral pressure for 
all types of tests and for the three types of samples at both temperatures. 

It would be expected with the increased viscosity of the bitumen 
that the modulus of deformation would increase as temperature decreased 
for the same type of test and the same type of sample. For the quick 
tests this only holds true for the remolded case. For both the samples 
taken perpendicular and parallel to the beds, the opposite effect takes 
place. 

The same effect apparently takes place in the quick consolidated 
tests. As for comparing the modu3.^ii of deformation for the quick and 
quick consolidated tests there is not much in the way of a general trend. 
With the sand particles becoming closer it would be expected that the mod¬ 
ulus with the quick consolidated would increase. However due to the ef¬ 
fect of the bonds between the films of two adjacent particles becoming 
t^akened the opposite effect would take place. Thus we have a compen¬ 
sating effect taking place. 

SENSITIVITY 

* 

A very sensitive soil may be turned into a mass of lubricated 
chunks capable of flowing on a gentle sloping base, whereas a similar 
slide in a clay with low sensitivity merely produces a conspicuous local 
deformation. The sensitivity of the tar sands is very flow but increases 
with decreasing temperature. This is seen both in the direct results and 
the values obtained in the two curve hypothesis. Thus at colder tempera-

tares, a disturbance will tend to weaken the bond due to the films of 
bitumen whereas due to its lower viscosity at higher temperatures the 
bond may yield somewhat to stresses produced by a disturbance without 
appreciably being weakened. 

SPECIFIC GRAVITY 

The chemically extracted non ignited sample gave results that 
were very low. That obtained from the sample where the bitumen was 
burned off gave very good results. With the non ignited sample, the 
bitumen must have left a very thin coating around the soil particles. 
Thus air might be entrapped in the specimen giving results that are too 


low,

APPLICATION TO DESIGN 


H l 


As shown in plate one a pipe house was built on the river- 
bank and a backfill was placed around the foundation which had a depth of 
35 feet. On the bank side of the foundation the fill filled a volume 
which extended 30 feet from the top of the foundation and at the bottom 
of the foundation the cut into the bank was not so great. However, on the 
bank side at the bottom of the foundation there was considerable cutting 
into the bank before the fill was placed. On the river side the foundation 
was backfilled to a depth of 25 feet by a fill which was roughly parabolic 
in shape. Below 25 feet the soil was flat lying but had evidently been 
backfilled because pipes had been placed at a depth of 40 feet below the 
top of the foundations. The square foundation was filled with remolded soil. 

Because of the bitumen content the wall friction would be very 
low. Consider the wall friction as negligible and consider the bank side 


of the fill. 

Since the wall tilted towards the river the pressure exerted 
by the soil would be an active pressure. 

For an infinite mass of soil the active earth pressure per foot 
of wall is given by the equation: 


P , = -2c II JL + \ -1 H 2 -i 


N< 


<P 


Since the fill extended 30 feet into the bank at the top of the 
foundation and a considerable distance at the bottom we will consider this a: 


a semi-infinite mass.

For the equation

Therefore

H - 35 feet 

N ip - tan 2 (45 \ z tan~ 45 = 1 (<f = 0 for remolded soil) 

i = 103#/ft 3 

P A = (-2 x 160 x 35) + [i x 103 x (35) 2 ] 


= (-11200 + 63900)#/ft. 

= + 52,700#/ft. = 26.4 tons/ft. 


Since the length of the foundation is 15 feet, total pressure 
acting along the bank side of the fill is 

P = (264 x 15) - 396 tons 

This force will act in the centre of the foundation at a depth 

of 2/3 the depth of the fill. This force will thus act at a depth of 

2 x 35 = 23 feet below the top of the foundation.

On the river side, the fill was roughly parabolic in shape. As 


the foundation began to tip the fill would have a passive pressure. However, 
since it has no support behind it this fill would tend to slide towards the 
river. 

Assuming that this fill was semi-infinite in all directions 
the passive earth pressure would be governed^ by the equation

N 


To balance the force acting on the bank side of the foundation 
the depth of semi-infinite mass of soil required would be 


(2 c H /N«p + iHh 2 N, ) = 52700 


(2 x 160 x H x 1) + i x 103 H 2 x 1 = 52700 


320 H + 103 H 2 = 52,700

But the fill on the river side is parabolic and hence it could 
not be considered to have this required effective depth. 

There is a further consideration that would have an overturning 
effect. The fill on the bank side has a resultant acting one-third the 
neight up from the base of the fill. Even if the fill in the riverside did 
not have a slipping effect it would still be at a lower value than one-third. 
Hence there is an additional overturning effect. 

A backfill was made of three successive stages. At the bottom 
was a slope of about 60 degrees and 16 feet high. Then there was a step of 
about 5 ft. then a slope of 63° for 20 ft., and further there was another 
step of about 10 feet and then another slope of 60° of about 10 ft. high. 

Considering the first stage alone and consider the surface of 
sliding as at the base of the fill the slope of the fill should, as 
obtained from the chart, be 40° for a maximum. 

For this remolded material the maximum slopes for the given 


heights should be

Hence it is readily seen that above 10 feet in height the 
slope of the remolded soil becomes very unstable. 

The remolded soil will remain stable with a slope of 90° 
up to a height of 6 feet irrespective of the position of the firm strata. 

For beds in their natural state it has been found that the 
angle of internal friction is 5 degrees. Up to a height of 6.5 feet the 
beds will remain stable even though the slope is 90°. 

For these beds the height of slope and base slope angle are 


as follows:
