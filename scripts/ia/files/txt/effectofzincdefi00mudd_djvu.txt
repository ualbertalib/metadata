THE EFFECT OF ZINC DEFICIENCY ON THE METABOLISM OF INDOLEACETIC ACID 

IN THE TOMATO PLANT 


INTRODUCTION 


The reduced content of indoleacetic acid in zinc deficient 
tomato plants has three possible explanations. These are: firstly, 
there may be enhanced destruction of indoleacetic acid; secondly, there 
may be reduced supply of precursors, and thirdly, both of the above pos¬ 
sibilities may be operative. Although previous work indicated that the 
third possibility is the most plausible, emphasis has recently been 
placed on the effects of zinc deficiency on the synthesis of indoleacetic 
acid. This emphasis is due to the discovery that in Neurospora 3 the 
enzyme responsible for the synthesis of tryptophan is specifically 
affected by zinc deficiency (UO). In higher plants tryptophan is a known 
precursor of indoleacetic acid, and it is also known that the content of 
tryptophan is reduced in zinc deficient plants ($0, 62). 

The work described in this thesis is largely devoted to 
the search for an enzyme which catalyses the synthesis of tryptophan in 
higher plants, to characterize the enzyme, and to discover the effects of 
zinc deficiency on the enzyme. The remainder of the thesis describes 
work on the effects of zinc deficiency on other reactions important in 
the metabolism of indoleacetic acid. 

Though the problem of zinc deficiency is not solved, this 
work has extended knowledge of the effects of the deficiency, and permits 
the suggestion of fruitful avenues for future research.

LITERATURE REVIEW 


Historical 

As an agricultural problem, zinc deficiency was solved in 
the early 19^0 *s, when it was found that the beneficial effects of iron 
sulfate treatment were due to impurities of zinc* Hoagland (^0) has 
summarized the early work on zinc deficiency; his examples show the 
effect to be widespread geographically, and in the number of plants that 
are naturally affected. Symptoms of zinc deficiency can be alleviated 
in several ways: zinc coated nails may be driven into affected trees, 
zinc salts may be applied to the soil, and solutions of zinc salts may 
be sprayed on the leaves of the affected plants. 

Woodbridge (74), in a recent report of zinc deficiency of 
fruit trees in the Okanagan Valley of British Columbia, states that zinc 
sulfate spray was the most effective method of treatment. 

Scope of Investigations on Zinc Deficiency 

In addition to agricultural aspects, zinc deficiency has 
received considerable attention as a problem of academic interest. In 
spite of the large amount of work done, the precise function of zinc in 
the metabolism of higher plants is still not understood. These investi¬ 
gations may be divided into three sections: Qytological, Physiological, 
and Biochemical. 

Cytological The major contributions to the cytological study of zinc 
deficiency have been made by Reed (4^, 46, 4 7 )* 

Zinc deficiency in apricot and peach trees is a naturally 
occurring problem in California. Reed (4^) studied the effects of zinc 
deficiency on the cells of the vegetative buds of these trees. He found 
that there was a general condition of hypoplasia in the cells, there was

an accumulation of phenolic substances in the vacuoles, an increase in cell 
size, and an inhibition of cell multiplication. This inhibition of meri- 
stematic activity has also been noted by Carlton (10) working with tomato 
plants. In connection with this point, it is relevant to mention the 
report of Fujii (lU) that zipc is present in the nucleoli of starfish 
oocytes. He also found that when mitosis proceeds in sea-urchin eggs, the 
zinc initially present in the nucleoli passes into the chromosomes. It is 
possible that zinc is similarly associated in higher plants. 

A later paper by Reed and Dufrenoy (U6) reported that in 
the cells of zinc deficient apricots the colloids, instead of being dis¬ 
persed as in normal cells, were aggregated into coacervates. These masses 
were largely made up of catechol, and had a boundary layer which was phos¬ 
pholipid in nature. A further study by Reed (Ij.7) using cytochemical tech¬ 
niques with zinc deficient tomato plant tissues indicated that there was 
serious interference with phosphorus metabolism. Greater amounts of in¬ 
organic phosphate were found in the extra-stelar region and phloem of the 
affected plants. Other derangements discovered by Reed were that the 
activity of the enzymes phosphatase and polyphenol oxidase was increased, 
and that the activity of dehydrogenases was reduced. The content of reduc¬ 
ing sugars was greater in the affected plants, and there was less sucrose 
and starch. This effect on carbohydrate metabolism was the same as had 
been discovered by Bean (I 4 .). 

Physiological Zinc deficiency may be found in plants grown in soil which, 
on analysis, is found to contain ample zinc for the needs of the plant. 
Hoagland (30) states that the zinc may be bound in the crystal structure 
of soil colloids, and he also mentions evidence that micro-organisms bind 
zinc. Soil which previously gave rise to zinc deficiency supplies adequate 
zinc after sterilization; zinc deficiency is again produced when a small

amount of the unsterilized soil is added to the sterilized soil, A further 
consideration pointed out by Hoagland is that certain plants, though re¬ 
quiring zinc in comparable amount to other species, are able to derive 
sufficient zinc from soil that gives rise to a condition of zinc defi¬ 
ciency in the other species. Alfalfa is quoted as an example of a plant 
which apparently has greater ability to derive zinc from the soil. Arnon 
has said that in some peach orchards enough zinc has been applied to the 
soil to theoretically supply the plants for 40,000 years, and yet the 
plants still show signs of zinc deficiency. It is for this reason that 
foliar application of zinc salts is frequently the best way of curing zinc 
deficiency, (Arnon, 2). 

Bergh (7) has found that when pea plants are allowed to 
take up radioactive zinc for a period of 24 hours, the highest concen¬ 
tration of zinc is found in the roots and the lowest in the old blades. 

When the plant material was fractionated and analysed for the zinc it was 
found that in the root 77%> of the radioactive zinc was insoluble in water, 
alcohol or ether, whereas in the upper parts of the plant only 20 - 50 % of 
the radioactive zinc was insoluble in the same solvents. The binding of 
zinc in plant tissues will be mentioned again later. 

Some attention was paid by Bean (4) to the effect of zinc 
deficiency on nitrogen nutrition. Finding that nitrates accumulated in 
zinc deficient plants he considered that the reduction of nitrate may have 
been interfered with. However, when zinc deficient plants are supplied 
with ammonium salts as a nitrogen source in place of nitrates, deficiency 
symptoms appeared just as soon and were just as severe. Nevertheless, the 
effect of zinc deficiency on nitrogen metabolism is pronounced. Bean (4) 
found that protein nitrogen is reduced, and soluble nitrogen in the form 
of amino acids 'was increased, in zinc deficient material. The close

relationship between zinc and nitrogen is emphasized by the work of Ozanne 
(45). He found that when the supply of zinc was low, zinc deficiency symp¬ 
toms were much more severe when the nitrogen supply was high. This was 
true no matter whether nitrogen was supplied as sodium nitrate, ammonium 
nitrate, ammonium sulfate, or 1-asparagine* Zinc concentration was posi¬ 
tively correlated with protein concentration in the roots* The proportion 
of absorbed zinc that was translocated to the plant tops was negatively 
correlated to the amount of protein in the roots, Ozanne concludes that 
increased nitrogen supply causes zinc to be retained in the roots as zinc- 
protein complexes, so accentuating deficiency symptoms in the plant tops. 

The work of Smith (51) is relevant to a discussion of zinc 
deficiency in relation to nutrition. When tomato plants were grown with 
insufficient supply of zinc several other elements were adversely affected. 
The content of nitrogen, potassium, manganese, molybdenum, and sulfate 
were reduced below that of the control plants at statistically significant 
levels. 

Another physiological factor which seems to be of great 
importance in zinc deficiency is light. Hoagland (50) mentions that in 
citrus trees it is often seen that zinc deficiency symptoms are more pro¬ 
nounced on the sunny side of the tree. In greenhouse plants deficiency 
can be relieved by shading the plants with cheesecloth, or by removing them 
to a place where the light intensity is less. Stout (55) allowed tomato 
plants to grow in culture solution low in zinc which was radioactive, and 
when deficiency showed he transferred the plants to the laboratory where 
the light intensity was less. The recovery of the plants was associated 
with translocation of the zinc to the upper parts of the plant. The impli¬ 
cation is that zinc-protein complexes are broken down under reduced light 
so releasing zinc which is then translocated.

In the course of a study of the relationship between zinc 
and auxin, Skoog (50) examined the effect of different wavelengths of 
light. Tomato plants were grown in solutions low in zinc; some plants 
were grown under red cellophane, and others were grown under blue cello¬ 
phane. The plants thus grown in red light showed considerable freedom 
from the symtoms of zinc deficiency, whereas the plants grown in blue 
light developed deficiency symtoms equal to those of plants grown in 
sunlight. It is therefore apparent that the light enhancement of zinc 
deficiency is principally due to light of the shorter wavelengths. 

Bean has found that the activity of peroxidase is increased in zinc defi¬ 
cient plants. This increase in activity is less pronounced when the zinc 
deficient plants are protected from intense light. 

When Crane (ll) found that the accumulation of niacin in 
tomato leaf disks was enhanced by light, he considered that the finding 
might be applicable to the interaction of zinc deficiency and light inten¬ 
sity. The work he did to test this possibility (12) showed that zinc defi¬ 
ciency did not result in a significant reduction of ability to synthesize 
niacin in the light. 

The effect of zinc deficiency on two other physiological 
processes may be mentioned. Firstly respiration; Tsui (64) compared the 
respiratory ability of leaf segments of normal and zinc deficient tomato 
plants. He found no significant difference and concluded that zinc plays 
no direct part in the respiratory system of higher plants. In view of 
subsequent discoveries of the effect of zinc deficiency on several oxi¬ 
dative enzymes, Tsui*s finding is surprising, and his conclusion is cer¬ 
tainly questionable. 

Secondly, a paper by Tsui ( 65 ) examines water content and 
osmotic pressure of zinc deficient and healthy tomato plants. Whereas

the water content of deficient plants was reduced, the osmotic pressure of 
the cell sap was greater than that of the healthy plants. This discovery 
is in accord with the condition of hypoplasia in the cells of deficient 
plants as found by Reed (45). It is also in agreement with the knowledge 
that the content of auxin is reduced in zinc deficient plants (Skoog, 50; 
Tsui, 62) and the knowledge that one of the primary effects of auxin is on 
the cell wall. 

Biochemical The discussion of biochemical investigations of the effects 
of zinc deficiency in higher plants may be divided into three sections? 
zinc containing enzymes, miscellaneous enzymes, and enzymes involved in the 
metabolism of indoleacetic acid. 

Zinc containing enzymes a) In 1940 Keilin and Mann (55) established 
that the carbonic anhydrase of red blood corpuscles is a zinc containing 
enzyme, the activity of the enzyme being proportional to the zinc content 
of the preparation. Carbonic anhydrase was later found to be present in 
green plants (Day and Franklin, 15* Bradfield, 8), and subsequently the 
enzyme was characterized (Waygood and Clendenning, 685 Byerrum and Lucas, 
9)* The speculation that the carbonic anhydrase of higher plants is also 
a zinc containing enzyme was inevitable. This hypothesis was tested by 
Wood and Sibly (72), and they found that the activity of carbonic anhydrase 
was in fact reduced in zinc deficient oat plants. However, they concluded 
that the effect was not caused by an insufficient zinc supply to activate 
an apoenzyme, but a blocking of protein synthesis so affecting the protein 
moiety. This conclusion was endorsed by McElroy and Nason (59)* Kondo et 
al. ( 55 * 56 ) reported the presence of carbonic anhydrase in several vegeta¬ 
bles, and also reported the isolation and purification of the enzyme. They 
found that the purified enzyme did not contain zinc or any other metals 
detectable by the dithizone test, and by spectrographic analysis. It

therefore appears that carbonic anhydrase may be discarded as a possible 
line of research to discover the primary effect of zinc deficiency* 

b) According to Warburg and Christian as cited by Reed (4y), aldolase 
(zymohexase) of yeast is a metal protein containing 1 gram atom of copper 
and 1 gram atom of zinc per 5 5 000j000 grams of protein. The activity of 
aldolase in zinc deficient oat plants has been measureu Dy Qumian-imtson 
w. tie round that zinc deficiency led to decreased activity of aldolase 
in oat plants and in subterranean clover. Copper deficiency had no effect 
on the same enzyme. Quinlan-Watson considers three possibilities as expla¬ 
nations for the result: zinc may be a constituent of the apo-enzyme; zinc 
may be concerned with the synthesis of proteins, including aldolase; zinc 
may function as a co-enzyme or be in association with one. In connection 
with the work of Quinlan-Watson, McElroy and Nason (59) state that "far 
more evidence would be necessary to show this enzyme to be a zinc protein, 
despite the temptation of analogy with the suggested metallo-nature of 
aldolase of yeast". In view of the multiple effects of zinc deficiency, 
the caution of McElroy and Nason is understandable. The only way to avoid 
the reservations of McElroy and Nason would be to isolate and purify the 
enzyme in question, and correlate its activity with zinc content in the 
manner followed by Keilin and Mann (55) i* 1 their investigation of carbonic 
anhydrase, 

c) This purification method has been followed by Vallec et al. (66), 
studying yeast alcohol dehydrogenase. They find that the enzyme is a 
metalio-enzyme containing four moles of zinc firmly bound to one mole of 
protein. The enzymic activity is directly dependent on zinc content 0 The 
alcohol dehydrogenase of Neurospora is reduced under conditions of zinc 
deficiency (Nason et al*, 4l). It is therefore tempting to consider that 
the alcohol dehydrogenase of higher plants Is a zinc containing enzyme;

this hypothesis has not been reported as having been tested in the litera¬ 
ture although Reed (1+7)* by virtue of qualitative tests, decided that dehy¬ 
drogenases in general were less active in zinc deficient tomato plants. 

To summarize this section on zinc containing enzymes, it can 
be said that it is not satisfactory merely to show that a certain enzyme is 
reduced in its activity to prove that the enzyme is a zinc containing 
enzyme. It must be isolated, purified, and its activity shown to correlate 
with zinc content. 

Miscellaneous enzymes The effect of zinc deficiency on several other 
enzymes is shown in the following table*

The study of Nason et al. is the most comprehensive yet re¬ 
ported on the effect of micronutrient deficiencies on enzymic constitution 
of higher plants. The effect of deficiencies of zinc, copper, manganese, 
iron, boron, molybdenum, and iron on several enzymes was tested. Except 
where the element in question was a part of the enzyme (e.g. copper in 
ascorbic acid oxidase), deficiency of micronutrients led to an increased 
activity of the enzymes tested. This increase in enzymic activity did not 
show any specificity for any particular deficiency. To account for this 
finding Nason et al. put forward the hypothesis that micronutrients are 
principally concerned with protein synthesis and are necessary for "key 
reactions' 3 . Where there is deficiency of micronutrient, these "key 
reactions" can not take place and the relatively "primitive" proteins that 
do not require the products of the "key reactions" increase in activity. 
This hypothesis is very plausible and accounts for all the experimental 
facts. Enzymes that are reduced in activity under conditions of micro¬ 
nutrient deficiency require the products of the postulated "key reactions", 
whereas the enzymes that increase in activity can be synthesized independ¬ 
ently of these products. 

The metabolism of indoleacetic acid (lAA) Skoog (50), and Tsui (62) 
have found that zinc deficient tomato plants contain less auxin than 
healthy plants. This reduction in auxin content is detected before there 
are any morphological indications of zinc deficiency. It is now generally 
considered that the only natural auxin is IAA, and it is of interest to 
examine the effects of zinc deficiency on its metabolism. 

The metabolism of IAA in normal plants is not fully eluci¬ 
dated, but a discussion of the present knowledge is a necessary introduc¬ 
tion to a discussion of the effects of zinc deficiency on the enzyme sys¬ 
tems involved. Workers on the precursors of IAA are agreed that tryptophan

is an essential precursor. There are differences about the products inter¬ 
mediate between tryptophan and indoleacetic acid, but these may be actual 
species differences rather than true disagreements. 

Working with spinach plants as source material, Wildman, 
Ferri, and Bonner ( 69 ) concluded that tryptophan is first oxidatively 
deaminated forming indolepyruvic acid which is then oxidatively decarboxy- 
lated to form indole acetic acid. Gordon and Nieva (2?), working with 
pineapple as source material, concluded that the immediate precursor of 
IAA is indoleacetaldehyde. They also found that both indolepyruvic acid 
and tryptamine were converted to indoleacetic acid by tissue extracts* 
Tryptamine could be formed from tryptophan by decarboxylation, and it could 
then be converted to indoleacetaldehyde by oxidative deamination. A third 
possible pathway is suggested by the discovery that indoleacetonitrile has 
growth regulating properties (5, 6). Thimann (6l) considers that indole¬ 
acetonitrile only has growth regulating properties because of the ability 
of the plant to convert it to IAA. He demonstrated this in the following 
ways indoleacetonitrile is inactive in the pea test for auxins, but it is 
active in the Avena test. If the active molecule is the acid rather than 
the nitrile, then the difference between the two tissues must be in their 
ability to convert the nitrile into the acid. If this is true then Avena 
material should give rise to an active product in the pea test when it has 
been incubated with indoleacetonitrile. This is found to be the case. 

A summary of the possible pathways between tryptophan and 
indoleacetic acid is given in the diagram.

The content of IAA is maintained in a dynamic manner, the concentration 
level is determined by synthesis on the one hand and destruction on the 
other* The enzyme system responsible for the destruction of IAA has come 
to be known as IAA oxidase, and has been intensively studied, mainly by 
Galston and co-workers (l5 - 21)* 

It had been known for some time that oxidizing agents such 
as hydrogen peroxide could inactivate auxin. In the extraction of auxin 
for the Avena test, care had always to be taken to use peroxide free ether* 
The first report of enzymic inactivation of auxin came from Tang and Bonner 
($7)* They found the enzyme in etiolated pea seedlings and described 
several characteristics. Ina second paper (58) they describe the physi¬ 
ology of the enzyme, and give an account of the presence of a naturally 
occurring inhibitor which seems to be more abundant in green tissues* The 
destruction of indoleacetic acid was found to be catalyzed by light in the 
presence of riboflavin (Galston, 15)* This discovery was followed by a 
series of papers by Galston and co-workers on the physiology of light 
action (16, 17, 18, 19, 20)* It was found that light inhibited auxin 
induced growth, this effect being concurrent with a destruction of the 
added auxin, (16 )* Although riboflavin stimulated growth in the dark, in 
the light its effect on growth was always inhibitory* It was also shown 
that the diffusible auxin of Avena coleoptiles is completely photoinacti- 
vated in the presence of riboflavin. Up to this point the photoinacti¬ 
vation of auxin investigated by Galston could be accounted for in terms of 
the purely physico-chemical system which he had first reported (15)* 
Subsequently (17), Galston concluded that the inactivation of auxin in his 
tests was due to a flavin-enzyme, which was heat labile and inhibited by 
inorganic ions such as manganese and copper* As with the preparation of 
Tang and Bonner (58), there was a naturally occurring inhibition which 








-13- 


could be removed by dialysis or reversed by illumination. The dialysed 
preparations were not activated by light. It was found that manganese 
ions had all the properties of the naturally occurring inhibitor; how¬ 
ever , the action of manganese ions has been shown to be stimulatory in 
other cases (Wagenknecht and Burris, 67; Gortner and Kent, 29)® The action 
of these ions is not yet fully understood. 

Further studies by Galston have shown that the metabolism 
of indoleacetic acid is even more complicated than might first appear. 

For example the auxin induced growth of green pea seedling sections (as 
opposed to etiolated pea seedlings) is stimulated by light. In this re¬ 
sponse the stimulation by light can be replaced by supplying sucrose (19)© 
Further, the inhibition of growth in auxin in the presence of light is 
found with extremely small quantities of light, whereas the light enhance¬ 
ment of auxin induced growth is increased with increasing exposure to light 
no limit was reached even after 2k hours. Because of this tremendous dif¬ 
ference in the effect of auxin induced growth in green and etiolated tis¬ 
sues, it is difficult to evaluate the findings with etiolated tissue and 
apply them to an understanding of auxin metabolism in the normal plant. 

In spite of this reservation, Galston and Dalberg (22) have obtained re¬ 
sults on the adaptive formation of IM oxidase in etiolated pea seedlings 
which they used to form very satisfactory hypotheses to account for aging* 
lateral bud inhibition, and interactions of auxins. They found that older 
tissues had greater IAA oxidase activity which they considered to be in¬ 
duced by the polar transport of auxin from the meristematic regions to the 
older tissue. Increased activity of the enzyme with increasing age was 
shown to be a response to elevated auxin levels. The enzyme is present 
only in small quantities in actively growing cells. 

Wagenknecht and Burris (6?) found IAA oxidase in bean roots

and in pea seedlings. While manganese was stimulatory in the case of the 
enzyme from bean roots, the effect was variable in the case of the enzyme 
from pea seedlings, frequently causing inhibition. In both cases, how¬ 
ever, high concentrations of manganese ions were inhibitory. Wagenknecht 
and Burris suggest that the optimum level of manganese is already present 
in the pea extract, whereas the bean root preparation requires supple¬ 
mentation with respect to manganese. The enzyme has also been found in 
pineapple tissue by Gortner and Kent (29)* This enzyme was stimulated by 
manganese ions, but in other respects it differed from the enzyme from 
other tissues reported above. Its pH optimum is approximately 3*5 whereas 
the pH optimum for the enzyme from other sources is about 6.5* In con¬ 
trast to the enzyme from pea seedlings, the pineapple enzyme is not stim¬ 
ulated by dichlorophenol; and its activity is not increased by dialysis. 

It therefore appears that though the enzyme from pineapple accomplishes 
the same oxidation, it is not the same as the enzyme from pea seedlings 
and bean roots. 


Examinations of the protein nature on indoleacetic acid 
oxidase had indicated that it had a metallo-enzyme component (57 > 6?) and 
also that a second, light activatable component was of flavin nature. 

These discoveries were integrated in a paper of Gals ton, Bonner, and Baker 
(21). Their work shows that IAA oxidase rather than being a single enzyme 
is an enzyme system composed of a flavoprotein which is responsible for 
the production of hydrogen peroxide, and a peroxidase component which uti¬ 
lizes the hydrogen peroxide for the destruction of indoleacetic acid. The 
scheme suggested is shown below:

The inhibition of IAA oxidase by catalase can be accounted for as a removal 
of hydrogen peroxide which might otherwise be used in the oxidation of 
indoleacetic acid. Similarly the inhibition by manganese can be inter¬ 
preted also as a removal of hydrogen peroxide since Kenten and Mann (3U) 
have found that there is a system in horse radish root extracts which oxi¬ 
dizes manganese in the presence of hydrogen peroxide, Andreae and Andreae 
(3) explain the inhibition of IAA oxidase by sc op ole tin as a preferential 
use of the available hydrogen peroxide for the destruction of scopoletin 
rather than IAA. They are also able to support the suggestion of Galston 
et al. (21) that IAA itself is the unknown reducing agent which gives rise 
to hydrogen peroxide by virtue of the discovery that IAA stimulates the 
oxidation of scopoletin, presumably by increasing the supply of hydrogen 
peroxide. IAA oxidase is known to be stimulated by 2,l+-dichlorophenol 
(DCP) (Goldacre, Galston, and Weintraub, 25). Though this substituted 
phenol is known to inhibit catalase (Goldacre, and Galston, 2k) 9 it has 
been concluded that stimulation of IAA oxidase is by some other mechanism, 
since a catalase free IAA oxidase preparation was still stimulated by DCP. 
Lockhart (38) concludes that DGP is effective in the peroxidase portion of 
IAA oxidase, whereas Siegel and Galston (h9) conclude that DCP is effective 
in the peroxide genesis step, i.e* the flavoprotein component# The genesis 
of peroxide is clearly of importance in the destruction of IAA. Increased 
concentration of peroxide may be expected to result in greater destruction 
of IAA# The report of Galston and Siegel (23), that manganese stimulated 
the genesis of peroxide would suggest that manganese would stimulate IAA 
destruction as was the case with bean roots (6?), but is not in agreement 
with the earlier report of Galston and Baker (l8). 

The work on IAA oxidase leaves the following points unclear: 
the mechanism of stimulation by DCP, and the action of manganese ions. In

both cases the effects have yet to be related to reactions of natural 
physiological importance. To these outstanding problems may now be added 
another recently brought up by Goldacre (26). He has found that there is 
photochemical inactivation of IAA sensitized by non-protein components of 
plant tissue* These components are found in the non-protein dialysate of 
the brei of etiolated pea epicotyls. Goldacre states that chromatographic 
analysis indicates that there are at least four active components. It is 
possible that these components photoinactivate IAA in the same way as 
riboflavin (15). 

The above review summarizes the discoveries so far made on 
the metabolism of IAA in higher plants. However, it will be shown later 
that the synthesis of tryptophan, a precursor of IAA, is of great impor¬ 
tance in the study of zinc deficiency in higher plants. For this reason 
the synthesis of tryptophan will be discussed even though the mechanism 
for higher plants has not yet been reported* 

Tatum and Bonner (59) have reported the synthesis of trypto 
phan from indole and serine by Heurospora . Indole alone disappeared 
slowly from the medium^ the stimulation of indole uptake was accomplished 
by adding serine, whose stimulation was highly specific, 1-serine being 
twice as effective as dl-serine. Yields of tryptophan were about k0% of 
the theoretical maximum, the remainder apparently had been further metab¬ 
olised, one of the products being IAA. The synthesis of tryptophan by a 
similar reaction has been reported to occur in Lactobacillus arabinosus . 
(Schweigt, Sauberlich, Baumann, and Elvehjem, (!$))• 

Later Umbreit, Wood and Gunsalus (65) prepared a cell free 
extract from Heurospora which was active in the synthesis of tryptophan 
from indole and serine. It was found that pyridoxal phosphate was a nec¬ 
essary co-factor of the reaction. Stored preparations lost activity, but 
the activity could be restored by the addition of the co-enzyme.

From the point of view of zinc deficiency, the metabolism 
of IAA will be divided into three sections: the synthesis of tryptophan, 
the conversion of tryptophan to IAA, and the oxidation of IAA. 

i) In the synthesis of tryptophan by Neurospora , Nason (i;0) and 
Nason et al. (Ill) found that zinc deficiency affected the condensation of 
indole and serine unfavorably. Deficiencies of iron and manganese did 
not affect the activity. Addition of zinc solutions did not affect the 
activity of the enzyme. McElroy and Nason (39) have suggested that zinc 
deficiency might affect the same reaction in tomato plants and so account 
for the reduced content of tryptophan and indirectly for the reduced con¬ 
tent of IAA. 

ii) The diversities in the conversion of tryptophan to IAA can for¬ 
tunately be neglected in the study of zinc deficiency. Tsui (62) incu¬ 
bated leaf disks of deficient and control plants in solutions of trypto¬ 
phan and subsequently assayed for IAA. He found that the disks from defi¬ 
cient plants had ability to convert tryptophan to IAA equal to that of the 
healthy plants. Wiltshire (71) has found that in pea seedling tissue and 
extracts there is an enzyme which peroxidatively destroys tryptophan. 

Even though peroxidase is more active in zinc deficient plants, it appears 
that tryptophan is not affected in zinc deficient tomato plants. 

iii) The knowledge that tryptophan content is reduced in zinc defi¬ 
cient plants has placed emphasis on the synthesis of IAA as the system 
affected by zinc deficiency® But there is reason to believe that the 
early ideas of Skoog (50) on the destruction of auxin may be applicable. 
Skoog found that when stem sections of zinc deficient and healthy plants 
were placed on agar blocks containing known amounts of IAA, there was 
greater destruction by the deficient sections. However, he was not able 
to show this destruction in cell free extracts. Since this work of Skoog, 
the enzyme IAA oxidase has been discovered, and there are a number of 





-18- 


points of similarity in the physiological effects of zinc deficiency and 
the characteristics of the enzyme. 

Zinc deficiency symptoms are more acute under high light 
intensity. Peroxidase activity is increased* and catalase activity is 
decreased. High light intensity similarly stimulates IAA oxidase* and 
since the enzyme is a peroxidase* more IAA would be oxidized under zinc 
deficiency. Catalase inhibits IAA oxidase* and therefore zinc deficiency 
might be expected to increase the activity of IAA oxidase in this case 
also. 

This circumstantial evidence indicates the IAA oxidase is 
more active in zinc deficient plants. The work of Skoog therefore should 
be substantiated and extended.

MA.TERIALS AND METHODS 


Plant Material 

Tomato plants, Lycopersicon esculentum (variety Bounty), 
were used in all experiments* 

Seeds were soaked overnight in distilled water. They were 
then germinated in moist vermiculite. After about one week, when the 
seedlings were 1-| - 2 inches in height, transplanting was carried out* 
Culture of the plants was essentially as described by Stout and Amon (5U)« 
The plants were supported in a perforated disk made of plaster of Paris 
and coated with paraffin wax* The roots hung down into the culture solu¬ 
tion, which was held in 2-liter pyrex beakers* Macronutrient solutions 
were prepared and purified by the precipitation of impurities with calcium 
carbonate as described by Stout and Arnon (5U)> the theoretical consider¬ 
ations of which are discussed by Steinberg (52). Micronutrients were sup¬ 
plied as the Alt solution of Arnon (l)« Iron was supplied as ferric tar¬ 
tar ate, 1 ml. of a 0.5 % solution being added to each beaker twice a week. 

Macronutrient solutions and the water used in the beakers 
were tested for zinc content by the dithizone method (5U)* Demineralized 
water was found to contain less zinc than glass redistilled water and was 
used throughout. Final concentrations of zinc in the culture solutions 
were* 

Control - 0.05 parts per million 

Zinc deficient - less than 0.0005 parts per million 

The beakers were set in the greenhouse as indicated in 
Figure 1 a. Entry of light and consequent algal growth was prevented by 
wrapping the beakers in brown wrapping paper. The period of growth was up 
to six weeks| during this time the level of the solution was maintained

by additions of demineralized water. 

Tissue slices were cut freehand with a razor blade and 
washed with distilled water before use. Leaf disks were cut from the 
leaves with a cork borer and were washed with distilled water before use. 
Some tissue extracts were prepared by homogenizing in the Waring blender. 
Because of the heating and aeration involved, and because of the detrimen¬ 
tal effects described by Stern and Bird (53 ) 5 this method was discarded. 
Extracts of small samples were prepared in a glass homogenizer of the 
Potter-Elvehjem type. For larger samples, the method generally followed 
was to grind the tissue with an equal weight of demineralized water and a 
small amount of acid washed sand in a mortar. The resultant brei was 
pressed through cheesecloth, and the liquid was centrifuged at 3,000 r.p.m. 
for 30 minutes to remove coarse fragments. 

Enzymes 

Polyphenol oxidase activity was determined by following 
oxygen uptake in the Warburg apparatus. Catechol was used as substrate, 
being added from the side arm at zero time. 

Tryptophan synthease activity was measured by a modifica¬ 
tion of the method of Nason, Kaplan and Colowick (Ul)* The assay was per¬ 
formed in 50 ml. erlenmeyers containing 10 ml. buffer, indole, serine, 
enzyme, and distilled water to make up the volume to 20 ml 0 The vessels 
were stoppered with cotton wool and shaken at room temperature. At inter¬ 
vals, 2 ml. of the reaction mixture were taken and shaken with toluene to 
extract the residual indole. An aliquot of the toluene layer was taken 
and analysed for indole concentration. An aliquot of the aqueous layer was 
analysed for tryptophan concentration. 

The conversion of tryptophan to IAA was measured in 50 ml. 
erlenmeyers which contained tissue or tissue extract, tryptophan, and

buffer, in a total volume of 20 ml. The flasks were stoppered with cotton 
wool and shaken at room temperature. Samples of the reaction mixture were 
taken at intervals for determination of IAA concentration. 

Two methods were employed in the estimation of IAA. oxidase: 

a) the method of Tang and B 0 nner (57). Enzyme, buffer, substrate and 
addenda were incubated in 20 ml. volume under the same conditions as 
described for tryptophan synthease. Samples were taken at intervals for 
determination of IAA concentration. 

b) the manometric method of Wagenknecht and Burris (6?). The only modifi¬ 
cation made was that the IAA was placed in the main compartment instead of 
being added from the side arm at zero time. 

Analytical Methods 

Tryptophan was determined by a modification of the method 
of Horn and Jones (31) • The aliquot to be tested was placed in a color¬ 
imeter tube and made up to 1 ml. with distilled water. One ml. of a S% 
solution of p-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde in concentrated HC1 was added fol¬ 
lowed by 3 ml. of concentrated HC1. The addition of sodium nitrite, as 
described by Horn and Jones, was not found to benefit color development, 
and so was excluded. The color density was read in a colorimeter after 
30 minutes at a wavelength of 550 millimicrons. Concentration was then 
calculated by reference to a standard curve relating color density to 
concentration. 

Determination of indole was by the method of Wood, Gunsalus 
and Umbreit (73)> the only modification being that the test solution was 
made up to 5 ml. with acid alcohol instead of 10 ml. 

IAA was determined by the method of Tang and Bonner (57) 
except that, for convenience, 5 ml. instead of Lj. ml. of the Salkowski 
reagent were added to the test aliquot.

Protein nitrogen was determined by a modification of the 
method of Galston and Dalberg (22)* One ml. of the tissue extract was 
placed in a plastic centrifuge tube and one ml* of 1*0 M trichloracetic 
acid was added* After standing in the cold room for at least 30 minutes, 
the precipitate was centrifuged down at 3,000 r*p*m* for 30 minutes, and 
was then resuspended in 0*5 M trichloracetic acid. The precipitate was 
again centrifuged down, and the supernatant poured off. The precipitate 
was now transferred to a digestion flask with the aid of several washings 
of demineralized water, and 1 ml. of the digestion mixture added. This 
digestion mixture was prepared by adding 500 mgm. of mercuric sulfate and 
50 mgm* of sodium selenite to 200 ml. of concentrated sulfuric acid, and 
making the volume up to 1 liter with demineralized water. Digestion was 
aided by cooling after 30 minutes heating, and adding two drops of 
Superoxol. After further heating, this step was repeated. The contents 
of the digestion flask were then cooled and made up to a volume of 25 ml* 
An aliquot of this solution was taken and made up to 5 ml. in a color¬ 
imeter tube. One ml. of Nessler solution was added and the color read at 
U25 millimicrons after 15 minutes. (The Nessler solution was prepared by 
mixing one part Eimer and Amend Folin-Wu Nessler reagent and four parts 
10% NaOH). Nitrogen was calculated by reference to a standard curve. 
Determinations were carried out in duplicate, and corrections were made 
from the reading of a reagent blank® 

Dry Weight 

Samples were dried at 60 degrees C. for several hours, and 
then at 110 degrees G. for about one hour before being cooled in a 
dessicator and weighed.

RESULTS 


I. Morphological 

The superior growth of the control plants was usually vis¬ 
ible after 2-3 weeks growth in the culture solutions. However, it was 
noticeable that during the months October - February, deficiency symptoms 
did not appear at any time. The solutions were prepared from the same 
stock solutions that had given rise to deficiency symptoms previously, 
and which gave rise to deficiency symptoms subsequently. 

Plants having an inadequate supply of zinc had a generally 
stunted growth habit, as compared to the normal plants (Figure 1, b), The 
internodes were short. The petioles were reflexed. The leaves were mal¬ 
formed, and later developed necrotic spots 5 finally they withered completely 
(Figure 1 , c, d). Root growth was considerably less under conditions of 
zinc deficiency. 

Recovery from these effects could be obtained by the addi¬ 
tion of zinc sulfate to bring the concentration of zinc to that in the 
control beakers (Figure 1 , e, f), 

II, Uptake of Indole by Toraato Tissues and Tissue Extracts 

The uptake of indole was measured by the method described 
under Materials and Methods, Materials used included cotyledons, leaf 
disks, stem slices, and extracts of these tissues. No previous report of 
the utilization of indole by higher plants had been seen in the literature, 
so the enzyme responsible for the uptake of indole was first characterized. 

Effect of pH Preliminary experiments with cotyledons indicated that the 
optimum pH for the uptalee of indole was about The same optimum was 

obtained when the experiments were performed with leaf extracts. The 
shape of the pH-activity curve is shown in Figure 2,

The reaction mixture contained 10 ml* phosphate-citrate

buffer of the indicated pH; k ml. of the tissue extract; 3 ml* 10 J M

indole; 2 ml* 10 M dl-serine; and 1 ml. distilled water. Samples were 
taken for analyses at zero time and after two hours incubation. 

The optimum pH is much lower than pHs which are considered 
to be physiological* but the same result was obtained consistently. 

Frogress of the Reaction in Relation to Time In some of the earlier 
experiments long periods of incubation were allowed. It was later found 
that such long periods were unnecessary for tissue extracts because the 
reaction was virtually complete after a period of two hours. With whole 
tissue the progress of the reaction was slower presumably because of the 
limitation of diffusion of substrate into the cells. Time-progress graphs 
are shown in Figure 3. 

The reaction mixture contained 10 ml. of phosphate-citrate 

buffer* 5 ml. of the leaf tissue extract* 3 ml. 10*^ M indole* and 2 ml. 

-2 

10 M dl-serine. Samples were taken for analyses at the indicated times. 

Effect of Serine Concentration If the uptake of indole is catalyzed by 
an enzyme system similar to the one found in Neurospora * then there would 
be formation of tryptophan* and a requirement for serine. As will be men¬ 
tioned later the colorimetric test for tryptophan was not adequate even 
for the estimation of theoretically maximum quantities formed. The 
requirement for serine however would be strong evidence that the enzyme is 
the same as the one found in Neurospora (59)• 

Experiments with tomato cotyledons showed that increasing 
concentration of dl-serine stimulated the uptake of indole up to a point* 
but there was reduced uptake at higher concentrations. The results of one 
experiment are shown in Figure ko In a duplicate experiment* essentially 
the same results were obtained.

buffer, pH k*9$ 3 ml. 10 M indole; varying amounts of 10 M dl-serine; 
and distilled water to make the volume up to 20 ml. The dry weights of 
the cotyledons were determined at the end of the experiment. Samples for 
analyses were taken at zero time and after 8 hours incubation. 

With tissue extracts there was no indication that serine is 
necessary for the uptake of indole. Addition of dl-serine either had no 
effect or caused some inhibition, as shown in the following table.

The absence of stimulation of the tissue extracts by added 
serine may be due to the release of serine from the tissues during the 
preparation of the extract. Inhibition may be due to enzyme specificity 
for the 1-isomer. To test this idea it will be necessary to purify the 
enzyme by precipitation techniques so that there can be no contamination 
by serine. This has yet to be done. 

Effect of Indole Concentration According to the theory of Michaelis and 
Menten as described by Wilson (70), the effect of substrate concentration 
on reaction velocity should be described by the equation of a rectangular 
hyperbola. The concentration of indole was indeed found to affect the 
uptake of indole in this manner, as shown in Figure 5* Lineweaver and 
Burk (37) have shown that agreement with the theory of Michaelis and 
Menten can be better demonstrated if the data are manipulated in order to 
obtain a straight line. This can be done by plotting i/V against i/S.

Such a plot is shown in Figure 6. The theoretical considerations of this 
method are as follows: 

The Michaelis-Menten equation is commonly written: 
v = V(S)/(Ks + (S)), where: 
v is the initial reaction velocity, 

V is the maximum velocity, 

(S) is the concentration of the substrate, 

Ks is the Michaelis constant* 

This Michaelis constant is the dissociation constant of the 
enzyme-substrate complex, and is often defined as the substrate concen¬ 
tration which gives half maximal velocity of reaction. When substrate 
concentration is plotted directly against velocity it is frequently dif¬ 
ficult to evaluate the Michaelis constant because the maximum velocity 
is not reached under the experimental conditions. This can be seen to be 
the case in the effect of indole concentration on indole uptake* The 
method of Lineweaver and Burk removes this difficulty, the maximal velocity 
being found by extrapolation. The Michaelis-Menten equation is rearranged: 
i/v - Ks/V(S) + I/V 

When I/v is plotted against l/(S), a straight line is 
obtained with an ordinate intercept i/V and a slope of Ks/V* From these 
figures Ks can be calculated. 

From Figure 6, the following values were obtained:

20 ml* The supply of serine was considered to be adequate in view of the 
findings described in the previous section. 

Effect of Enzyme Concentration The effect of enzyme concentration on 
the uptake of indole by tomato leaf extract is shown in figure 7* Sumner 
and Somers (56) state that the reaction velocity is usually directly pro¬ 
portional to the enzyme concentration provided that an excess of substrate 
is present. The graph in this case departs from linearity, particularly 
at higher concentrations of enzyme. This may be attributed to insuffi¬ 
cient excess of indole. 

The reaction mixture contained 10 ml. phosphate-citrate 

-3 

buffer, pH 6.5; 3 ml. 2*5x10 M indole ; varying amounts of tissue extract; 
and distilled water to make the volume up to 20 ml. 

Products of the Reaction Enzyme activity was usually measured as uptake 
of indole. However, in relation to zinc deficiency, the products of the 
reaction are of great importance • The experiments described above were 
carried out with the basic hypothesis that in higher plants indole is con¬ 
densed with serine to form tryptophan. This hypothesis could only be 
verified by the identification of reaction products when indole disappeared 
from reaction mixtures. 

Difficulty was experienced in the quantitative estimation 
of tryptophan as a product of the reaction. This was because the color¬ 
imetric test for tryptophan is much less chromogenic than the colorimetric 
test for indole. For example, 0 o l micromole of indole in solution 
increased the optical density of the Erlich test solution by 0.620* The 
same molar quantity of tryptophan increased the optical density by 0.055* 
Thus even when the disappearance of indole was marked, the formation of 
tryptophan did not cause a marked increase in optical density when the

colorimetric test was applied. Nevertheless, experiments of a qualitative 
nature have shown that tryptophan is a product of the reaction involving 
the uptake of indole. The relationship of the formation of tryptophan 
and the disappearance of indole is shown by the optical density data 
graphically presented in Figure 8 . 

The reaction mixture contained 10 ml. phosphate-citrate 

-3 -2 

buffer pH U.9; 2 ml. 10 M indole 5 2 ml. 10 M dl-serine 5 and distilled 
water to make the volume up to 20 ml. The active material was provided 
by tomato cotyledons. In another vessel serine was excluded; in this 
vessel the optical density of the tryptophan test solution stayed rela¬ 
tively constant. Other reaction vessels included a check for turbidity 
changes. 

Because the production of tryptophan could not be put on a 
quantitative basis, some other method of measuring products was looked 
for. It is known that tryptophan gives rise to LAA (Wildman, Ferri, and 
Bonner, 6 $?)* Therefore formation of IAA from indole would provide pre¬ 
sumptive evidence for the formation of tryptophan. Two problems arose 
here: the pH optimum for the uptake of indole has been shown to be about 
5.0, whereas the pH optimum for the conversion of tryptophan to IAA is 
reported to be about 7*5 (Wildman, Ferri, and Bonner, 69)* For the con¬ 
version of indole to IAA a pH between these had to be chosen. The second 
problem was the separation of indole and IAA for colorimetric analysis. 
Fortunately this was found to be possible by the same method as used for 
the separation of tryptophan and indole. Shaking an aqueous solution of 
the two compounds with toluene separates the indole into the toluene 
layer, and the IAA remains in the aqueous layer. The two compounds can 
not be measured by tests on the same solution because indole is chromo- 
genic in the Salkowski test for IAA (Gordon and Weber, 28).

Conversion of indole to IAA in relation to time is shown 
in Figure 9* The reaction mixture contained 10 ml* phosphate-citrate 
buffer, pH 7«1$ 3 ml* leaf extract; 2 ml* 10 M indole; and distilled 
water to make the volume up to 20 ml* Two other vessels were shaken at 
the same time; one contained the substrate with boiled enzyme, and the 
other contained the enzyme preparation with no substrate* Colorimetric 
tests on the solution in the latter vessel made it possible to correct 
the values in the experimental vessel for changes in turbidity* There 
was no activity in the boiled enzyme control* 

The results of this experiment indicate that IAA is formed 
from indole, though it appears that IAA was destroyed by the system after 
it had been formed from indole* Even at the time when the concentration 
of IAA. was at a maximum, (after 2 hours), it was only b3% of the theoret¬ 
ical maximum yield of the indole consumed* If this destruction of IAA is 
a feature of the tissue extracts, measurement of IAA formed is clearly 
unreliable as an estimation of the activity of the enzyme catalyzing the 
condensation of indole and serine* Other experiments have given yields 
of IAA closer to the theoretical maximum* 

Work done on the products of the reaction consuming indole 
therefore show that both tryptophan and IAA are formed* Ho satisfactory 
method of measuring these products quantitatively has been found, though 
it may be said that the modification of technique so that tryptophan may 
be quantitatively estimated would be preferable because the estimation of 
IAA introduces several other enzymes besides the one of study* Such 
introductions reduce the control of the experiment* 

Comparison of Zinc Deficient and Healthy Tomato Plants in Their Ability 

to Utilize Indole Having characterized the enzyme responsible for the 


uptake of indole, it was then undertaken to test the possibility that the

enzyme might be affected by zinc deficiency. It has already been specu¬ 
lated that the activity of the enzyme condensing indole and serine might 
be reduced in activity in zinc deficient plants, so reducing the content 
of tryptophan directly, and the content of IAA indirectly (McElroy and 
Nason, 39 )o 

Comparison of zinc deficient and healthy plant tissues and 
extracts, contrary to what was suspected, invariably showed the zinc defi¬ 
cient material to be more efficient in the utilization of indole. The 
results of several experiments are shown in Table 3.

The above results clearly show that zinc deficient material 
is more active in the uptake of indole than the healthy material* Because 
simultaneous measurement of products was not successful, two interpreta¬ 
tions are possible. 

1) If indole is converted only to tryptophan, then the tryptophan 
synthease had enhanced activity under conditions of zinc deficiency* (As 
has already been noted, increased enzyme activity is a common finding in 
zinc deficient material)* If this is the case, the supposition that the 
conversion of indole to tryptophan is the precise reaction affected by 
zinc deficiency is disproved, and it can be concluded that the metabolism 
of higher plants is different to that of Neurospora in this respect. 

2) If enzymes are present in the tomato plant tissues which catalyze 
the conversion of indole to products other than tryptophan, then increased 
activity of these enzymes would increase the uptake of indole and yet 
reduce the formation of tryptophan. 

Evidence so far obtained indicates that the first possi¬ 
bility is more likely to be correct* This evidence was obtained by com¬ 
paring the efficiency of conversion of indole to IAA by zinc deficient and 
healthy material. 

The formation of IAA was calculated as percentage of the 
indole taken up, the comparison being on a molar basis.

In spite of the reservations already made as to the use of 
IAA formation as a measurement of tryptophan synthease, the above results 
suggest that the pathway of indole metabolism is not significantly altered 
from a qualitative point of view. Any change in the uptake of indole may 
therefore be expected to result in a corresponding change in the formation 
of tryptophan and IAA* 

If indole is more efficiently converted to tryptophan in 
zinc deficient plants, how can the reduced content of tryptophan be 
explained? The most plausible explanation is that the content of indole 
is reduced. To test this possibility it is necessary to analyse zinc 
deficient and healthy tomato plant tissues for indole, and to measure the 
rates of formation of indole* This investigation has not yet been carried 
out* An attempt to extract ll free indole 11 by grinding leaves with several 
changes of toluene and testing the toluene extract for indole indicated 
that any indole present in the tissues is present in bound form, which 
would only be released on hydrolysis. The precursor of indole in higher 
plants is not known. To discover it would require an independent inves¬ 
tigation, though a convenient starting point would be to test anthranilie 
acid, which is the precursor of indole in Neurospora (Tatum and Bonner, $9 )• 

III* The Utilization of Tryptophan 

a) The Conversion of Tryptophan to Products Other than IAA Wiltshire 
(71) has reported the oxidation of tryptophan in pea seedling and tissue 
extracts. He found the enzyme to be peroxidase, being stimulated by per- 
oxigenic substrates such as putreseine and ethanolamine, low it is known 
that the activity of peroxidase is increased in zinc deficient material 
(Nason et al., U2$ Bean, U) 5 and it was considered that the increased 
activity may affect the content of tryptophan. If the peroxidase breaking 
down tryptophan is more active in zinc deficient material, this would

account for the reduced content of tryptophan directly, and indirectly 
for the reduced amount of IAA. 

This possibility was tested. 

Experiments were carried out in the Warburg respirometer 
as outlined in Materials and Methods. The reaction mixture was buffered 
at pH 6.7 with phosphate buffer in all cases. In various experiments, 
tryptophan alone was used as the substrate, and in others different com¬ 
pounds were added to stimulate the production of hydrogen peroxide, and 
so hasten the oxidation of tryptophan if any took place. 

The addition of tryptophan alone or in combination with 
one or more of the compounds mentioned failed to raise the oxygen uptake 
above the endogenous level. This lack of influence of tryptophan on the 
uptake of oxygen was the same no matter whether the extract had been pre¬ 
pared from zinc deficient or healthy material. It may therefore be con¬ 
cluded that the peroxidative destruction of tryptophan was not operative 
in the extracts studied. 

Measurements of gas exchange in the above experiments gave 
no indication of the fate of the added tryptophan. A measure of the 
utilization of tryptophan and the formation of IAA was obtained by taking 
aliquots from the vessels at the end of a run and performing colorimetric 
tests on them. These tests showed that tryptophan was being utilized by 
the extracts, and that the products included IAA. It was not possible to 
put the conversion of tryptophan to IAA on a quantitative basis because 
no colorimetric readings at zero time had been taken. However, the qual¬ 
itative nature of the conversion can be seen from Table 5» Utilization 
of tryptophan is indicated by the approach of the value of per cent 
transmittance to the value of the endogenous solution; formation of IAA 
is indicated by the deviation of the value for per cent transmittance from

Though the control extract clearly synthesized more IAA 
than the deficient extract* it is not possible to compare the relative 
efficiencies because no determinations were made of dry weight or protein 
nitrogen. Relative efficiencies in the conversion of tryptophan to IAA 
are discussed in the next section. 

b) The Effect of Zinc Deficiency on the Conversion of Tryptophan to 
IAA Tsui (62) reported that zinc deficiency does not affect the conver¬ 
sion of tryptophan to IAA. His experiments involved incubating leaf disks 
with tryptophan* and then drying the disks* extracting the auxin with 
ether and then assaying the auxin by the Avena method. 

When the production of IAA was being considered as a method 
of assay for tryptophan synthease* it was essential to know if the zinc 
deficient and healthy material had equal ability to convert tryptophan to 
IAA. If they were in fact different, then the production of IAA would be

no measure of tryptophan synthease. This point was of such importance 
that the finding of Tsui was checked, using colorimetric methods instead 
of the biological assay. 

The experimental material was incubated with phosphate- 
citrate buffer, and tryptophan, in 20 ml. volume. At the beginning of the 
experiment, and at the end, aliquots were taken for colorimetric analysis 
for IAA. The results of two experiments are gathered in the following

From the above results it is concluded that the formation of

deficiency, supporting the earlier discovery of Tsui. 


IV. Indoleacetic Acid Oxidase 

Several pieces of evidence have been brought forward in the 
Literature Review to suggest that the reduction in the content of IAA in 
zinc deficient plants is due to increased activity of IAA oxidase. Pre¬ 
liminary experiments by Skoog (50) indicate that this is the case.

In the work described here the enzyme was first looked for 
in tomato plants, and some of its characteristics investigated to see how 
well it compared with the enzyme described from other sources* 

Presence of the Enzyme in Tomato Plant Tissues A naturally occurring 
inhibitor of IAA oxidase is known, and it is particularly concentrated in 
the green parts of the plant (Galston and Baker, 18). In the tomato plant 
IAA. oxidase was never found in the green parts of the plant, but activity 
was frequently found in root homogenates. The presence of the enzyme was 
demonstrated by the colorimetric technique of Tang and Bonner (57), and 
by the manometric technique of Wagenknecht and Burris (6? ). However, the 
enzyme was not found consistently; in some cases the addition of IAA to 
extracts inhibited rather than stimulated respiration. No explanation for 
this erratic behavior was found. 

Effect of Substrate Concentration The effect of three concentrations of 
IAA on the oxygen uptake in the Warburg re spirometer is shown in Figure 
10. The vessels contained 1*0 ml. root extract; phosphate buffer pH 6.3s 
and IAA solution. Increasing concentrations of IAA clearly stimulate 
increased oxygen uptake. 

Effect of Inorganic Ions Previous reports of the effect of manganous 
ions on IAA oxidase have been conflicting. The enzyme from etiolated pea 
seedlings is inhibited by manganese ions (Galston and Baker, 18), while 
the enzyme from the roots of the wax bean is stimulated by these ions 
(Wagenknecht and Burris (6?)* The effect on the enzyme from tomato roots 
was tested, and found to be stimulated by manganous chloride at concen¬ 
trations in the region of 10 4 M. At the same time the effect of zinc and 
copper ions was also tested. The solutions were added to the Warburg 
vessels so that their final concentration was 10 4 M. The results are 


shown in Table 7

Itfhen considered together the two experiments indicate that 
the IAA oxidase from tomato roots is stimulated by manganous ions, inhib¬ 
ited by copper ions, and is unaffected by zinc ions. The inhibition by 
copper is evidence that the activity of the enzyme system is dependent 
upon sulfhydryl groups $ James (32) has stated that copper ions at low 
concentrations have been found to inhibit enzymes containing the sulfhydryl 
group as a necessary factor for activity*

The fact that oxygen uptake measured destruction of IAA 
was checked by colorimetric analysis of aliquots of the reaction mixture 
taken from the Warburg vessels at the end of a run. Oxygen uptake varied 
positively with the destruction of IAA as measured by colorimetric 
analysis* 

Effect of PGP (2,[i-Dichlorophenol) IAA oxidase has been found to be 
stimulated by DCP, (Goldacre, Gals ton, and Weintraub, 25). Experiments 
with this compound showed that a similar effect is produced with the 
enzyme from tomato roots. Results are presented in Figure 11. In this 
experiment a comparison was made of the relative effectiveness of manganese 

-b 

ions and DCP, both at final concentrations in the Warburg vessels of 10 
M. An interesting point in the graphs of Figure 11 is that stimulation 
of oxygen uptake did not occur until a period of 1§ hours had elapsed. 
Vertical lines at 1 and ij hours indicate the range between the highest 
and lowest values. This period can be conjectured as a limitation of the 
supply of hydrogen peroxide. Where IAA alone is the substrate, the period 
indicates that hydrogen peroxide is formed from IAA as has been suggested 
by Galston, Bonner and Baker (21), and confirmed by Siegel and Galston 
(U9)* The fact that DCP did not remove the lag period suggests that its 
stimulatory effect is on the peroxidase step of the IAA oxidase enzyme 
system. This is in agreement with the finding of Lockhart (38). 

Relationship of Polyphenol Oxidase and IAA Oxidase Thimann (60) has pre¬ 
sented evidence suggesting that inactivation of growth hormone by leaf 
extracts is due to oxidation by a peroxidase-catechol oxidase system. 
Experiments were conducted with the object of testing the relationship of 
polyphenol oxidase activity to IAA oxidase activity. These experiments 
were carried out in the Warburg respirometer. IAA oxidase activity and

polyphenol oxidase activity were measured simultaneously with control and 
zinc deficient extracts. Results of the experiments are shorn in Table 9© 
Though the zinc deficient material showed greater activity 
in the oxidation of catechol, no indication of enhanced destruction of IAA 
was detected. However, neither control nor zinc deficient extracts showed 
ability to oxidize IAA* For this reason no final judgement on the 
relationship of polyphenol oxidase and IAA oxidase can be made.

The greater activity of the deficient extract in the oxi¬ 
dation of catechol is a direct indication of superior specific activity 
as both enzyme extracts contained 8 mgm. dry matter per ml. This finding 
is in agreement with the report of Nason et al. (U2), that polyphenol 
oxidase activity is increased in zinc deficient plants.

discussion 


The discovery that zinc deficiency specifically reduces 
the activity of the enzyme responsible for the synthesis of tryptophan in 
Neurospora , has directed interest to the possibility of a similar effect 
of zinc deficiency in higher plants (McElroy and Nason, 39) • The sugges¬ 
tion was made in spite of the fact that, at the time, no enzyme catalyzing 
the synthesis of tryptophan in higher plants had been reported. However, 
the knowledge that the content of tryptophan is reduced in zinc deficient 
plants was strong circumstantial evidence in support of the hypothesis 
(Tsui, 62). 

Experiments reported in this thesis show that indole is 
definitely a metabolite of higher plants. The dependency of indole up¬ 
take on the presence of serine which has been demonstrated with tomato 
cotyledons indicates that the utilization of indole in higher plants is 
similar to the utilization in Neurospora . That is to say, indole and 
serine are combined by a chemical condensation. Further evidence that 
the reaction is the same has been obtained by the detection of tryptophan 
as a product of the reaction. By changing the pH of the reaction mixture, 
IAA has also been demonstrated as a reaction product. One unsatisfactory 
feature of the work on tryptophan synthease has been the inability to 
measure the quantities of tryptophan produced when indole was taken up. 

This was because of the limited sensitivity of the color test for 
tryptophan. 

The finding that zinc deficient material is more efficient 
in taking up indole is in direct contrast to the finding with Neurospora , 
and appears to disprove the hypothesis of McElroy and Nason (39) • However, 
some reservations must be made. Because it was not possible to determine 
the relative efficiency of the zinc deficient and healthy material in the

synthesis of tryptophan, it could not be concluded that zinc deficiency 
does not affect the pathway of indole metabolism. Evidence is given in 
the experimental section that strongly suggests that the pathway is not 
altered, but for complete satisfaction it would be preferable to manipu¬ 
late the experimental conditions so that tryptophan could be detemined 
quantitatively. The tryptophan test as used would be satisfactory if 
there were less turbidity in the reaction mixture, and the turbidity could 
be reduced by using concentrated and purified enzyme preparations. But 
for purposes of comparison of zinc deficient and healthy material, such 
preparations would not be as valuable as crude preparations since differ¬ 
ences found might be attributable to the methods of purification rather 
than to true physiological differences. 

If, on the basis of the available evidence, it is accepted 
that zinc deficient material is more efficient than healthy material in 
the conversion of indole to tryptophan, what conclusions may be drawn? 

If indole were equally available in the two cases then the zinc deficient 
material should contain more tryptophan. This is known not to be the case. 
This line of reasoning suggests that the zinc deficient material should 
contain less indole - a theory which has yet to be tested. If it is cor¬ 
rect, the effect of zinc deficiency on the synthesis of IAA must be on 
some reaction leading to the formation of indole. It is tentatively sug¬ 
gested that indole is formed from anthranilic acid. This idea can also 
be readily tested, and will give further information about the influence 
of zinc deficiency on the metabolism of IAA in higher plants. 

Wiltshire’s (?l) report that an enzyme derived from eti¬ 
olated pea epicotyls catalyzes the peroxidative destruction of tryptophan 
raised the possibility that the conversion of tryptophan to products other 
than IAA may take place under conditions of zinc deficiency. Such a

diversion would account for the observed effect of zinc deficiency on the 
content of tryptophan and IAA. Experiments reported in this thesis showed 
that peroxidative destruction of tryptophan did not take place under the 
conditions employed. 

The idea implicit in the preceding discussion may be empha¬ 
sized by the following diagram, which shows the metabolic pathway ]e ading 
to the formation of IAA, and hypothetical side reactions which would 
reduce the supply of IAA precursors.

+

In the diagram, the known reactions in normal plants are 
indicated as solid horizontal arrows. Any break in the reactions symbol¬ 
ized by these arrows would account for the observation that IAA concentra¬ 
tion is lowered in zinc deficient plants. Tsui (62) has reported that the 
conversion of tryptophan to IAA is unaffected in zinc deficient plants and 
this has been endorsed by experiments reported in this thesis. The changes 
discovered in the activity of the enzyme responsible for the conversion of 
indole to tryptophan also do not account for the reduced content of IAA. 
Effects of zinc deficiency on the synthesis of indole remain to be tested. 

The side reactions A, B, and C should be considered in the 
discussion of zinc deficiency. Increase in the activity of the enzymes 
A, B and G, would account for the observed effect of zinc deficiency on 
IAA content. A is an entirely hypothetical enzyme. B corresponds to the 
enzyme described by Wiltshire (71)5 as mentioned above it does not seem to 
be operative in tissue extracts of tomato leaves and so may be dismissed 
as being the point of influence of zinc deficiency. The third enzyme G

corresponds to 1AA oxidase. Preliminary experiments by Skoog (£0) sug¬ 
gested that this enzyme is more active under conditions of zinc deficiency* 
Attempts to extend the finding of Skoog have so far been unsuccessful* but 
the reaction still deserves attention as a possible solution of the prob¬ 
lem of zinc deficiency* 

The compounds taking part in tie metabolic pathway leading 
to the formation of IAA are now known to be numerous and to stretch from 
indole to IAA* In the study of the effects of zinc deficiency of these 
reactions it now appears that the likeliest avenues of further research 
are at the two ends of the chain; - the synthesis of indole* and the 
destruction of IAA*

summary 


An enzyme catalyzing the uptake of indole has been found in 
tomato plant tissues and tissue extracts. It has been concluded that the 
uptake of indole is by the same mechanism as that found in Neurospora . 

This conclusion was reached after tryptophan and IAA were identified as 
products of the reaction, and when, in some cases, serine was required for 
indole uptake* Several of the characterizing properties of the enzyme 
have been worked out; among these the pH optimum is quite low - about pH 

5.0. 

Comparison of zinc deficient and healths’- plant material, 
on a dry weight or protein nitrogen basis, showed the zinc deficient mate¬ 
rial to be more efficient in the uptake of indole. This indicates that 
zinc deficiency affects higher plants and Neurospora in a different manner 0 

No indication of the peroxidative destruction of tryptophan 
was found in zinc deficient or healthy material. It therefore appears 
that the reduced content of tryptophan and IAA can not be accounted for 
by changes in the activity of this enzyme. 

The absence of effect of zinc deficiency on the conversion 
of tryptophan to IAA has been reconfirmed. 

Attempts to obtain a comparison of the relative efficiencies 
of IAA oxidase in zinc deficient and healthy plants were unsuccessful.
