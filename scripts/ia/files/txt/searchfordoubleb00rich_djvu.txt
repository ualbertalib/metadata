Abstract 


A nine inch Wilson Oloud Chamber has been used in a search for 
double beta decay froa? a 0*5 eheet of chemlcally-pijure, un-enriohed 
telliiriuia powder bonded with lucite* The chamber was triggered by a 
coincidence in two Geiger tubes mounted inside the chamber. Of the 
naturally-occurring isotopes of telluirlim?, 126, 128 and 1^0 are 
possibly double beta active* Only radiations from Te^^^ will not be 
absorbed in the source* The minimum half life for Te^^^ was found to 
be 5 X 10 years.

Introduction 


Double Seta decay is the eimultanoouB emission from the nucleus of 
two electrons9 with a corresponding increase of two in the atomic 
numbers 



( 1 ) 


The semi-empirioal mass formula (1) gives the mass of an atom^ of 
atomic weight A and atomic number Z ass

where 


Frcmi this it can be seen that for nuclei of edd atomic weight, a 
plot of mass vs. atomic number, for nuclei of constant atomic weight will 
be a parabola (Plat© !)• There ie only one stable element in a series of 
this kind. 

A different situation occurs for nuclei of even atomic weight. 

Because of the oocurrence of S^(A,Z) in the mass fomula, the masses of 
atoms of equal atomic weight plotted against atomic number will occur on 
two parabolae (Plate II). The atoms of even Z will lie on the lower curve, 
those of odd Z on the upper*

If it happens that the energy of each of two even Z atoms Is less 
than that of the intervening atom^ these two atoms will both be stable 
since 9 by oonaervation of energy^ neither can decay by single electron 
or positron emission* However, In reality the heavier nucleus of the two 
even Z nuclei will be meta stable and may decay by double beta (-f- or «*) 
decay* Since this process has a very long half life the elements 
appear stable* 

The first calculation of the half life of this process was carried 
out by Goeppert^^ayer in 1955(2)t «filing the Fermi theory of beta decay* 
This theory postulates the existence of a massless, ohargless particle, 
the neutrino (), in order to satisfy the laws of conservation of 
energy and momentum* The neutrino is considered as a Dirac particle* 
Therefore the existence of another particle, the antineutrino is 
Introduced* Antlnsutrinos are “holes* in the sea of negative energy 
neutrinos* In beta decay a neutrino is emitted (or an antineutrino is 
absorbed)* Equation (1) beccmest 

The probability of this process was found to be very mall, as was 
expected, and the corresponding half life was found to be of the order of 
years for the decay of nuclei when the energy available for the 
transition was of the order of 2 mev* A half life of 10^5 years cannot 
be measured by any experimental technique at present available* 

In 1959, Furry calculated the probability for the same disinteg¬ 
ration, using the Majorana theory of the neutrino ( 5 , ^), which does 
not lead to negative energy states. According to this theory, beta

d 0 cay ia aocompanlad by either the emission or abaorjition of a Majorana 
neutrino^ and this has a marked effect on the half life of subetancea 
decaying by double beta decay. This ia beoauae, in addition to decays 
when two neutrinoe are emitted^ there are also the disintegrations which 
occur when a neutrino ia "anitted** along with one electron and “abaorbed” 
with the amission of the other electron* The neutrino in this case ia 
virtualp and has no redl existence* The sum of the energies of the two 
emitted electrons is constant* Since the xB<MBentm of the neutrino is not 
limited by the energy available for the proceaSii the half life of a 
eubatanoe is increased by a factor of from 10^ to 10^5 years, depending 
on the interaction used* Actually Furry used, together with Fermi 
interactions, the Konoplneky'inilenbeck type expressions, (which are no 
longer used}* The Konoplnski-IJhlenbeck interactions gave the greatest 
difference in half life, but the tensor, vector and pseudo-bfectou 
interactions ^ve half lives lees then 10^^ years for an energy 
difference of the order of 2 mev. Frimakoff (5) has recalculated the 
Majorana probabilities and also l^e angular correlation of the fitted 
electrons* The half lives are lower than those calculated by Furry 
because of a lower experimental value now used for Fermi's constant, “g.** 
Frimakoff also considered selection rules and for allowed transitions 
he obtained a minlimaa half life of 10^^ years, for first forbidden 
10l6 years, for a mass difference of 1*5 mev* By choosing a suitable 
degree of forbiddenness and a type of interactlonjalmost any half life 
greater than 10^^ could be approximated*

Howeyer^ in a very recent paper Calanlello (6) etates that the 
Majorana theory does not aatiafy the usual invariance requirement© 
and 1© therefore Invalid* 

The experimental evidence of double beta decay ha© been obtained 
using four quite distinct methodst 

1* A comparison of the number of coincidence counts from two samelee . 

Identical except for isotopic abundance* 

Tills is the method used by Fireman (7^ 8) in the first attempt to 
detect double beta decay* Tvo sample© of tin were compared^ one of 
normal isotopic abundance, and one containing of 
A significantly greater number of coincidences were observed for the 
enriched tin, and this activity was ascribed to the double beta processs 



repeated by Kalkstein and Libby (9) with improved technique and an 


enriched sample of 9 ^% of eASn^^^ 


• The minimimi half life obtained was 


10^7 years* 

2. Analysis of the isotopic constitution of ores * 

The double beta decay of elements should affect the isotopic 
abundance of the daughter element. In an experiment of Inghram and 
Reynolds (10), the isotopic constitution of xenon in tellurium ore was 
compared with the abundance of the isotopes of xenon in air* Three 
isotopes of tellurium may undergo decays

The roaotion la energetically doubtfiU, so that the hi^lf life of 

this reaction would be very long* The experiment could not detect any 
difference in the Isotopic abundance of , and only a very small 

excess of was found. The minimuni half life was set at ^10^^ years. 

In a repetition of this experiment (11) using an ore which was lees 
likely to have been disturbed during geologic time, a half life of ^ 

10^ years v/as obtained for Te^^O. 

Levine, Qhiorso and Seaborg (12) performed a similar experiment on 

which wee expected to decay to which is oC- active with an 

energy of 5*51 and a half life of 90 days. Plutonium was separated 

chemically from Uraniimi ore and the oC activity of 5*51 

18 

determined. A half life of 6 x 10 years was obtained* This experiment 
had the advantage of eliminating the age of the or© from the calculation. 
5. Scintillation Counters and "Xick^sorter** ^iethod . 

Pearce and Derby (ij) have carried out an experiment in which 
coincident electrons from a source of 9^/0 of (and a "duiamy** of 

aluminium) were detected in anthracene crystals of scintillation 
counters. The amplitudes of coincident pulses were added electronically 
and the resulting pulse analysed by an eighteen channel differential 
discriminator. Mo excess of particles (as expected on the Majorana 
theory) was evident in any channel. A minimsas half life of 
yeare liras obtained. 

4. Oloud Chamber studies. 

A cloud chamber, triggered by two Geiger counters in coincidence 
which are inside the chamber with a double beta active source, provides 
the best experimental method at present for detecting double beta decay.

Tho photog^raph permits posltiyo identification of the traclce as electrons 
and meaeurements of the energy of each particle can be carried out. The 
background is effectively reduced to those electrons which, after passing 
through the source, are multiply scattered so as to appear as electrons 
leaving the source, end to beta-internal conversion electrons. Both of 
these events may still be discriminated against on energy grounds. An 
experlraent of this type has been carried out by Fireman and Schwarzer (l4), 
using a twelve inch cloud chamber and six counters connected in two banks 
of three. Throe pictures out of four thousand were of the double beta 
typo. The surri of energies in two of thaee was fairly close to 0.75 raev, 
but the third was only slightly greater than 0*5 n:>ev. The miniinum half 
life was greater than 10^^ years.

Apparatus 

A* Cloud Chamber 

!• Cloud Chamber Propar 

The cloud chamber was made in the shops of the National Reeearch 
Council at Chalk River* It is a circular cylinder nine inches in diameter 
and four inches deep, bounded by a quarter inch Incite wall, with a 
glass plate on top, and a perforated brass plate on the bottom, below 
which is a rubber diaphrarc* Below the diaphraiji is a apace connected to 
an evacuated tanlc by a Sylphon bellows valve* Two Geiger tubes are 
mounted parallel to one another on strips of quarter inch lucite glued 
to the walls of the chamber. I*ead8 are brought out through sealed holes 
in the wall of the chamber* A hole in the centre of the perforated 
braes platd Is tapped for mo^mting a source* Slack velveteen covers the 
bottom of the chamber to provide a bkck background for the photographs* 

2* Helmholta Coils * 

The Helmholtz coils were wound in the National Research 
Council shops at Chalk River* Originally the chamber was constructed for 
a two inch wall, so one inch spacers are placed under the coils to 
bring the centre of the coils into coincidence with the centre of the 
chamber* The coils are water cooled* The magnetic field has been 
found to be uniform within 0*5^ over a cylinder nine inches in 
diameter and two inches thick about the centre of the coils ( 15 )* 

5* The Gaaiera 

The camera was built at the University of Alberta. It is 
fitted with a Leica Elmar lens of 5^ m.ta. focal length and aperture f 5^5* 
Thirty-five millimeter film is used* An aluminim stand bolted to the 











3 


top of the Holmholta coile supports both the caraera and two vertical 
front alinainlzed mirrors parallel to the source,which are used to obtain 
a stereoscopic photograph of the chamber* In order to precerve the 
distance betvjeen the bottom of the mirrors end the top of the four-inch 
chamber, another set of on© inch spacers is placed under the 
alurainiura fraine* 

4* llluoiinetion 

Conventional flash circuits are used with two flash lamps 
placed on opposite sides of the chamber with the beam from the lamps 
parallel to the source* 

5* Control Circuits 

Automatic operation of the chamber is controlled by a series of 
timing circuits* Each circuit consists of a thyratron whose cathode 
voltage is above ground, and whose grid voltage is controlled by a 
condenser and variable resistors* When the grid voltage reaches the 
firing voltage (above cathode potential), the thyratron fires, closing 
a relay in the plate oircuiti this releor in turn closes the circuit of 
another thyratron and/or an external circuit which performs one of the 
required operations* The time delay between various events is adjusted 
by vanning the resistors in the corresponding grid circuits. 

The order of events is established by a selector switch operated by 
a solenoid* The solenoid is actuated by on© of the timing circuits. 

The movement of the selector switch causes the chamber to perform cycles 
of one major expansion, three minor expansions and two dead intervals* 
These cycles are repeated for automatic operation* One cycle takes 
approximately two and one half minutes* When counter control is used. 






9 


th© ©elector ©witch ground© {through one megohm) the grid of the thyratron 
which causes the major expansion. The selector switch connect© th© 
output of th© coincidence circuit to the grid of the same thyratron. 
Grounding the grid of the thyratron "holds’* the charaher in the compressed 
position# A puls© greater than th© firing voltage plus th© cathode 
voltage will then trigger the thyratron^ causing th© main ©xcanaion# 

Th© potential of th© cathode is controlled by e potentiometer# 3y 
selecting a suitable potential for th© cathodOp the thyratron functions 
as a discriminator so that only the larger coincident pulses will 
trigger th© chamber* 

6# Tilting Table 

A 12" by 12" bakelite sheet, painted white, was used to view the 
tracks# An electromagnet is used to clamp the table at any angle up 
to 5^ to the horisontal, Th© chord length was measured by a ruler and 
the sagitta length by a micrometer screw# 

B* Gountin£ Apparatus 
1# Oeiger Tubes 

The Geiger tubes are Radiation Counter Laboratory Model 20, 
lark I tubes. The wall thickness of th© tubes Is ^ m.g./cm # The 
active length of th® tubes is approximately three inches, with diameters 
of 7/16 Inch and 9 /l6 inch respectively# 

2# Circuits 

Each Geiger tube is connected to a preamplifier, scaler and high 
tension supply (Plate IV)* A Sole, transfomer was used to provide a 
stable voltage supply for the hl^ voltage power supplies# Pulses from 
the Geiger tubes are taken from the output of th© preamplifier, shortened 
and fovl into a coincidence circuit (Plate V)# Th© circuit gives a

Earoarlmental Method 

1• Preparation of Gouroeg 

A copper ”duKimy" "was made from a eheet of copper 
8*0 m&9 X 20»0 cms. x 0.05 erne, k 6 ^ bolt was soldered to the plate 
for mounting in the chamber. This eource was used to determine the 
approximate amount and kind of background vrhich could be expected* 
?ov/dered, C,P. grade tellurium vms obtained from City Ch<MBical 
Corporation, New York, The tellurium powder was mixed with a rery thin 
solution of iucite in acetone* A frame, S x 20 eras* inside dimenaions, 
was constructed* The bottom of the frame^ of quarter inch square Iucite, 
was drilled and tapped for a 6 « ^ bolt, and the sides are of eighth 
inch square Iucite* This frame was placed on a flat surface and the 
mixture of acetone, Iucite and tellurlm was poiired in to a depth of 
approximately one ailllmoter and allowed to dry* This gave a very smooth 
upper surface, but the under side was rough* The underside was scraped 
with a razor blade until ^ooth iuid until the thickness was 0*05 
Both sides were then painted with a thin solution of Iucite and acetone 
which, when dry, left a thin film of Iucite covering the source* This 
was necessary in order to bind the surface particles thoroughly so that 
they could not break away frtm the source and cause fog in the chamber. 

The thickness of 0*05 ®S3* was chosen as the maxiaxmi thickness which would 
not interfere greatly with the emitted beta particles. The energy 
available for the transition from 

Electrons of approximately 0*0 mev will be absorbed by 0.5 esas* of 
telluriiKs, but over this energy, very few electrons will be completely 
stopped* 





2* 'Method of ObeTTatlon 


The source was aioiinted in the chamber partiiiel to the Geiger tubes* 
The chamber was sealed and adjusted to the proper e 2 :pan 8 ion ratio for the 
best tracks. To ensure the pretence of tracks in the chamber, a small 
source of Ra was placed at a distance of frof»i eight to ten feet. The 
Corrpton electrons from the iT-rays emitted by the radiuti are niamerous 
enough to provide several electron tracks per expansion. The expansion 
ratio was checked every two hours during observations. In spite of this, 
the main reason for numerous unsuitable pictures was the absence of 
tracks or the presence of obscuring foa. 

The copper source was then removed and the tellurium source mounted 
in its place* The expansion ratio waa readjusted every hour during 
observation* 

Stereoscopic photographs of the chamber were taken in air at 
atmospheric pressure* The \^orking mixture consisted of 2 - 5 cc* 

152 mixture of water and ethyl alcohol by volume* 

Tlie Helaholts coils were in continual operation witii a cui*rent of 
five amperes flowing through both coils* This gives a field of 
240 gauss. 

Three different fllaa were used — Ansco Ultra Speed, Ilford H.?. J, 
both developed as recommended, and Ilford F.P. developed for double 
the rscor^aended time in Promicrol ultra fine grain developer. All films 
were fixed for ten minutes except the Ilford F.P. 5* which was washed for 
only fifteen minutes* 

Pictures were viewed in a 55 projector, and if evidence of double 
beta tracks was seen, the tracks were measured.

Sixty-four pictures were taken with the telliarlum source* No 
pictures of the "S" form were observed* fhis represented an active ti m

Many of the coincidence photographs showed more *Uian two tracks, 
which were probably due to cosmic ray showers*

DieCTiagjon 

When the experiment uae begun the masses of Te^^^ and had 

not been measured. It was estimated that the energy available for the 
disintegration was greater than 2 mev and “infinite** source thiclcness 
for this energy ims chosen. Mass spectrograph measur^ontB of the maesbs 
of and have recently been carried out (6) and these give an 

energy of 1.8 mev. uonsequently the source thickness chosen was too 
great. This has been corrected for by assuming that only atoms in a region 
0.05 cm. thick about the centre of the source plate will be capable of 
detection^ so that the zaaxiuium distance an electron must travel in the 
source is 0.04 cm. 

The mlnimiSB half life found In this experiment is lower than that 
found by Inghram and Reynolds, however the method of observation is 
more direct. 

For an energy of 2.0 mev the expected half life on the Majorana 

12 

theory, for an allowed transition with Z near ^ is 10 years, that 

for a first forbidden transition, 10^^ years. The minfeum half life 

of 5 X 10^^ years obtained in this experiment would appear to rule out 

these two possibilities. The half life of Te^^ found by Inghram and 
21 

Reynolds, 10 years, is of the order of that predicted for allowed 
transitions by the Ferml-Dirac theory. 

The experimental evidence available at present indicates that, if 
the Majorana theory is correct, the transitions must be at least second 
forbiddeni on the other hand, this evidence does not rule against any 
part of the Dirac theory. The crucial test of the two theories would be 
the sum of the two electron energies in the double decay - if this s\m is 
constant the prediction of the Majorana theory is valid, whereas if the sum 
is not constant neutrinos must be emitted, in agreement with the Dirac theory.

Consider the Geiger tube as a flat plate perpendicular to line h. 

If a disintegration takes place at a point P(XpZ), then the probability that 
the first electron enters the first tube in element f dy, a distance y from 
the centre of the tube ies
