INTRODUCTION 


Up to the time this analysis was made, no tabulation 
of the subject matter comnon to Canadian Mathematics 
courses was available to educators. To the author of this 
report the usefulness of this type of tabulation was 
obvious, and it was agreed that an effort should be made 
to assist in compiling one for the entire Intermediate 
and Senior High School Mathematics field of Canada. This 
report, the third of the series H A Determination of 
Generalizations Basic to the Mathematics Curricula of the 
Intermediate and Senior High Schools of Canada* 1 , deals with 
the subject matter of the third year or the Grade Nine 
Mathematics Curriculum. 

The subject matter offered in any mathematics text 
may be divided into three groups? generalizations, language 
and information. Although this report deals primarily with 
generalizations, it was not possible to ignore the Other two 
groups of material. At the beginning of the study an attempt 
was made to define each of these three terms for the purpose 
of distinguishing them. However as the study progressed, 
it became apparent that the simplest solution was that of 
classifying the concepts arbitrarily either as generalizations, 
language or information, owing to the difficulty of border¬ 
line terms. For example, such terms ast parallel lines, angle, 
perpendicular were classified as language although each is as 
rich in ideas as many of the generalizations. The language

2 


terms, arbitrarily selected as such, have been listed 
alphabetically in Appendix III. 

The same difficulty arose with the distinction between 
generalizations and information. In many cases social 
concepts or generalizations were difficult to classify as 
either generalizations or as information, particularly 
when the author of the text departed from the field of 
pure mathematics for the purpose of gaining functionality 
in his presentation. For this reason, a section of this 
report deals with some of the informtion or generalizations 
offered in the more Socialized® texts. 

The texts selected for study were those being used in 
the Grade nine Mathematics curricula of the nine provinces 
during 1943-44. With the division of Quebec into Protestant 
Quebec and Satholic Quebec, ten texts or groups of texts were 
analyzed. In addition to these texts, the Programmes of 
Studies for each of the provinces were examined so that only 
subject matter offered in the classrooms would be tabulated 
in this report. The texts which were analyzed are listed 
by provinces in Appendix I. Notes made from the Programmes 
of Studies are given in Appendix II. 

Although the purpose of this report was to tabulate 
the frequency of the generalizations in these texts, to 
determine those which were more or less common, it was not 
possible to overlook completely the varying points of view 
with which the texts were written and with which it appeared 
that the mathematics courses were taught in the various 


■

provinces. If some standard were available, it seemed 
possible to classify the texts in some order from those 
which placed the most stress on "socialized” mathematics 
or applications of the generalizations and least stress 
on formal or “logical* 1 presentation through a number of 
intermediate steps to those texts which placed most stress 
on the moye rigorous or “logical” presentation of subject 
matter. 

In the tabulation of generalizations an attempt was 
made to indicate this variation in the method of presentation, 
that is, whether the generalization in each case was? 

(a) assumed to be true, and used without explanation or 
statement, 

(b) assumed to be true, but explained or stated informally, 

(c) offered with a proof, or stated formally often with an 
explanation. 

Three numbers are given in this report with each generalization 
to indicate the number of texts which present it in each 
of these three ways* For example, the first generalization 
is presented by no texts as (a), by two texts as (b) and 
by no texts as (c). 

Ho attempt has been made to arrange the generalizations 
in a logical or in a psychological order of classroom 
presentation. The generalizations were arranged in an 
alphabetical order of main headings merely for the purpose 
of having some convenient system to use in tabulationi This 
order has been followed in this report. Under each of the 









4 


main headings, the generalizations are arranged in the 
order of frequency, those occurring most frequently being 
listed first. In some cases the texts are indicated by letter 
reference so that the reader may note whether the same or 
different text or text groups offer the successive 
generalizations. For example, the first generalization is 
given in texts F and B# Bo key is given for this letter 
reference as the author does not wish to draw contrasts 


between specific provinces.

VI. Constructions . (a)~(b)-(c) 

(1) A straight line segment may be o - 4 - 4 - 

bisected by joining the common 

points of two equal intersecting circles whose 
centres ate at the ends of the given line segment. 

Two^of the texts listed under (c) also give - FC 
this generalization without formal proof, but have 
not been included among the four listed under (b). 

(2) A perpendicular may be drawn to a 0 - 5 - 3 - 
given iine at a point in the line by 

constructing with arcs congruent triangles of which

One of the texts listed under (c) also gives - C 
this construction informally. 

(3) A perpendicular my be drawn to a 0 - 5 - 3 - 
given line from a given point outside 

the line# 

Here as in (2) the common method is that of using 
arcs to get congruent triangles of which the 
perpendicular is the common side# As in (2) one- C 
of the texts gives this construction both 
formally and informally, and the same text uses 
a set square to make the construction. Another - G- 
text uses three methods, variations of the arcs 
or congruent triangle method and offers a proof 
for each. 

(4) An angle my be drawn equal to a 0-5-3 
given angle,(constructing congruent 
triangles). 

One of the texts gives this construction bGth - G 
formally and Informally. 

(5) Through a given point one straight 0-5-3 
line may be drawn parallel to a 

given straight line. 

The methods used for this construction vary? such 
as: by alternate angles, making a parallelogram, 
by corresponding angles, using two set squares. 

One of the texts gives this construction both - C 
formally and informally. 


1. In no case is a text listed under two classifications. 

If the text is listed under (c) it is not given under (b). 
This has been dene so that the reader may know the number 
of texts or text groups which deal with the generalization.

(6) Any angle may be bisected by making 0-4-3 
equal segments of its arms the 
corresponding sides of two congruent triangles 
which have their com on side between the arms 
of the given angle# 

One text gives this construction both formally - C 
and informally. 

(7) A given straight line segment may be 0 - 3 - 3 
divided into a number of equal parts. 

.For this construction nearly all the texts use 
the method of parallels.

one side. 

(9) A square may be described on a 1-0-3 

given line segment.

about a given circle. 


VII Circles 

(1) The areas of concentric circles 1 - 0 - 0 - F 
vary directly as the squares of the 

radii. 

(2) If two angles at the centre of a 0 - 1 - 0 - B 
circle are equal, they cut off equal 

arcs on the circle. 

(3) The area of a sector of a circle is to the area

circumference. 

(4) The centres of all circles passing 1 * 0 - 1 - DH 
through two fixed points lie on the

joining the points. 

This is similar to construction (14) page 8. 

(5) Through three fixed points, not in 0 - 0 -> 1 - H 
a straight line, one and only one 

circle may be drawn. 

VIII Casting out nines - arithmetic checking - (check figure) 

The remainder found when any number 1 - 0 - 1 - DA 
is divided by nine is the same as the 
remainder found when the sum of the digits of the 
number is divided by nine.

information or generalizations offered in some 
of the more "socialized" texts. 

(l) Thrift and Investment- 


(a) Thrifty people keep account of 0 
their receipts and expenditures. 

(b) Thrifty people save a definite 0 
amount of money each month. They 
keep bank accounts. 

(c) Thrifty people do not make hasty 0 
investments. High rates of interest 
indicate a large element of risk. 


0 - 1 - J 

1 - 1 - DJ

put in a bank, in larger amounts 
is invested.

(b) A discount is usually stated as a 0 ~ 3 - 0 - GG-K 
per cent of the list price. 

(c) Successive discounts may be 0 - 3 - 0 - CGK 

deducted in any order.

competition, induce buying in 

quantity, meet price changes in material 
or labor, sell out dead stock, make 
new catalogues unnecessary, when prices 
change. 

(3) Instalment Buying- 

fa) Things bought on the instalment 0 - 1 - 0 - J 
plan cost more than when paid for 
in cash. 

(b) People often buy things on 0-1-G-J

buying can be calculated. The rate 
is usually high. 

(4) Investing in stocks and bonds- 

(a) Investments not fully considered 0 - 0 - 1 - J 
from every angle usually mean loss 

of money. Speculation is dangerous. 

(b) When a corporation is operating 0 - 0 - 1 - J

the value of money. 

(d) Small dividends and poor prospects 0 - 0 - 1 - J 
for the future tend to drive the 

price of shares down. 

(e) Safety of the money invested and 0 - 0 - 1 - J 
permanence of reasonable dividends 

are the important things to consider 
before buying stocks. A corporation 
can pay dividends only if it makes 
profits.

per cent of the par value, or face 

value. This is an advantage over stocks. 

This interest is always the same, whether 
the market price is above or below par. 

When a bond sells below par, the rate of 
income is greater than the rate specified 
on the bond. When a bond sells above par, 
the rate of income is less than the rate 
specified on the bond, 

(b) All bonds are not equally attractive 0- 0- 1 - J 
as investments, as the greater the 

security, the safer the bond. 

(c) The total cost of the bond is made 0 - 0 - 1 - J 
up of three Items: the market price, 

the brokerage, the accrued interest, 

(d) Bonds are a safer form of investment 0- 0- 1 - H 
than stocks, although not all bonds 

are equally secure, 

(7) Stocks and bonds compared- 

(a) In stocks, the owner is part owner 0 - 0 - 1 - G 
of the corporation, generally has a 

vote in the election of directors, 
dividends are not due until declared 
by directors, dividends depend on the 
earning power of the corporation. 

Stocks are frequently purchased for 
speculation, 

(b) In bonds, the owner is a creditor 0 - 0 - 1 - G 
of the corporation, generally has 

not a vote, dividends (interest) are

(a) The rate of life insurance depends 0 - 0 - 1 - H 
on the age of the insured person* 


(b) Life insurance cost is determined 0 - 0 - 3 - EGK 
by mortality cost or death claims, 

reserve for cash surrender value 
or face of policies, expense of 
management* 

(c) Fire insurance premium rates are 0 - 1 - 3 - DEGK 
determined by the kind of fire 

protection, kind of building, 
proximity to and construction of 
adjoining buildings. 

(11) Taxation- 

(a) Municipalities raise money by 0 - 2 - 1 - DBH 

a direct tax on the land*

SUi: ARY AID CONCLUSIONS. 


In the preceding pages of this report, 455 
generalizations under the 45 headings have been tabulated 
as these basie to the Grade Nine Mathematics curricula 
of the Intermediate and High Schools of Canada. Of the 
total frequencies, 8.9$ were tabulated as (a) assumed 
to be true, and used without explanation or statement, 
36.4$ as (b) assumed to be true, but explained or 
stated informally, and 54.7$ as (c) offered with a 
proof or stated formally often with an explanation.

down through the table to 116 generalizations found in 
only one of the ten texts. 












These 455 generalizations, including the 
socialized mathematics concepts ate presented as the 
subject matter of the present Grade Nine curricula of 
Canada, In this report those generalizations have been 
distinguished from the 550 language terms given in 
Appendix III. 

In tabulating the generalizatiens, an a11erapt was 
made by a letter designation to indicate the texts 
which gave some of the least common generalizations. 

This was done for the purpose of giving the reader an 
opportunity of noting that these groups of generalizations 
came from the same or different texts. Appendix I, which 
lists the texts by provinces, gives further comments on the 
nature of each text. 

No attempt has been made in this report to indicate 
a logical or a psychological order in which these 
generalizations could be presented in the classroom;.nor 
has any attempt been made to suggest that the more common 
generalizations constitute w an ideal course* or the subject 
matter from which an ideal course eould be compiled in 
mathematics for pupils at the Grade nine level.

PROGRAMMES OP STUDIES. 

The following notes were made from the Programmes 

of Studies for each of the nine provinces: 

British Columbia - A complete discussion of the topics 
to be studied, listing objectives, teaching 
procedures, vocabulary to be stressed for each 
unit. 

Alberta — Lists the text and gives a brief discussion 
of the treatment of Geometry at this stage. 

Saskatchewan * Gives a brief statement of the objectives, 
indicating the stress on socialized mathematics. 

The topics to be studied are $ geometrical 
construction and inductive reasoning, formula, 
equation, ratio, indirect measurement, application 
of mathematics to simple mensuration and business 
transactions, signed numbers, products, simple 
factoring, simple graphs, practical farm arithmetic. 

Manitoba - An outline of the units to be studied and the 
number of periods to be spent on each unit. 

Ontario - Lists the objectives and the texts. 

Quebec, Protestant - Lists the texts. 

Quebec, Catholic - Lists the texts. 

Nova Scotia - Lists the texts. 

New Brunswick - Lists the texts. 

Prince Edward Island - Lists the texts and the topics 
to be studied in the Arithmetic, which are: 

1. Speed and accuracy in fundamentals - integral 
numbers, fractions, decimals, per cent. 

2. Review of Grade VIII - denominate numbers, fractions, 
decimals, mensuration, per cent. 

3. Compound interest - use of tables and some use 
of the long method, 

4. Use of graphs. 

5. Equations - using letters for unknowns, simple 
equations in one unknown.
