ABSTRACT 


This study was undertaken to compare the tendency 
of wheat, flax and pea seed to decay in the soil, to deter¬ 
mine the ability of the seed-decay organisms encountered to 
act under different conditions, and to ascertain the relative 
persistence of different chemical seed protectants on these 
seeds in the soil* 

Under all soil environmental conditions tested, 
pea seed showed the greatest tendency to decay, wheat the 
least, while flax was intermediate* The majority of the 
seed decay organisms were active over a fairly wide range of 
soil temperature and moisture conditions. Many of the fungal 
isolates were capable of causing seed decay of both wheat and 
flax in the soil, but not of peas. 

Orthocide 1|06 was the only fungicide which per¬ 
sisted on wheat, flax or pea seed for more than two days in 
the soil. Except for this fungicide, the mercurial pre¬ 
parations persisted longer than the non-mercurial prepara¬ 
tions on these seed types in the soil. The majority of the 
six fungicides tested were more persistent on wheat and pea 
seed than on flax seed in the soil.

MICROORGANISMS IN SEED DECAY 


INTRODUCTION 


Each year large quantities of seeds are sown, of 
which many fail to produce plants. Microorganisms causing 
seed decay are largely responsible for seedling mortality. 
Severity of such damage is determined by several factors, 
among which, quantity of inoculum, host susceptibility, soil 
temperature and moisture, are among the most important. In 
general, the soil inhabiting organisms which cause seedling 
blights, usually become aggressive when the environment is 
unfavorable for the growth of the seedling. 

In the prevention of seed decay, one must endeavor 
to render the environment unfavorable for the causal micro¬ 
organisms, and favorable for the host. Chemicals may be 
used to advantage, but only those which combine germicidal 
and non-phytotoxic properties with low cost, are likely to 


be used

EFFECT OF ENVIRONMENTAL 
CONDITIONS ON EMERGENCE 


INTRODUCTION 


It Is known that seedlings as well as microorganisms 
respond differently to different soil environmental conditions* 
The object of the following experiments was therefore to 
determine the influence of two soil environmental factors, 
the soil moisture and the soil temperature at which wheat, 
flax and pea seed are most, and least, susceptible to decay 
by the common soil microflora. Dickson (9) found that wheat 
and corn seedlings were only predisposed to seedling blight 
when they were grown at temperatures unfavorable to their 
growth. Wilson (i|4* k-5) studied the rate and amount of 
germination and its relation to mold attack on wheat, on 
blocks of plaster of Paris. The effect of soil moisture and 
temperature on pea ©mergence has been studied by Ledingham 
(23), Baylis (If), Hull (l£) and Wallace (IfO); Baylis (3) 
gave an account of the fungi concerned. 

METHODS 

The tendency of wheat, flax and pea seed to decay 
was compared by exposing these seeds in non-sterile soil to 
various moisture and temperature conditions during their

germination and emergence* The amount of decay was calculated 
by comparing the emergence of untreated seed with that of 
seed treated with Geresan M* Ceresan M is one of the best 
known organic mercurial seed protectants* Ceresan M was 
applied in dust form at the rate of jg, 1 and 1 oz* per bushel 
for wheat, flax and peas, respectively* The seeds used were 
I 9 I 4.9 Red Bobs wheat, I 9 I 4.8 Redwing flax and Homesteader peas* 
These seeds germinated 95 percent and over in a blotter test. 

Non-sterile, 3si Edmonton soil-sand mixture was 
used in all the experiments* Edmonton soil is described as 
a heavy clay; the soil used in these experiments was high in 
organic matter* The seeds were sown at a depth of 1 inch. 

All the pot experiments were carried out in the greenhouse 
in which the air temperature was maintained at l5°C* Signifi¬ 
cant differences in emergence were calculated by analysis of 
variance* 

EFFECT OF DIFFERENT LEVELS OF SOIL MOISTURE 

ON EMERGENCE 

The moisture experiments were carried out in 5i 
inch pots, using Ij. replicates and 25 seeds per pot. The 
moisture content of the soil was determined every 2 or 3 
days and maintained at the designated level* The results 
are presented in Table I*

Under low, optimum and high soil moisture conditions, 
peas showed the greatest tendency to decay, flax the next 
greatest tendency, and wheat the least tendency to decay* 

Wheat and flax were more subject to decay at low soil moisture, 
while peas were more subject to decay at high soil moisture* 
Ceresan M significantly Increased the emergence over non- 
treated seed to the 1 percent level In wheat under low soil 
moisture conditions, and flax under optimum and high soil 
moisture conditions. The emergence of peas was only signifi- 
cantly increased to the 5 percent level under high soil

moisture conditions. 

Discussion 

These results are very similar to those obtained 
by other workers. Wilson ( 44 ) found that wheat showed a 
wide adaptation to varying moisture conditions. A soil 
moisture content of 5>0 percent of saturation resulted in high 
germination with all the spring and winter wheat varieties 
he studied. 

That flax when treated with Ceresan M should give 
the highest emergence in high soil moisture and the lowest 
in low soil moisture, suggests that soil moisture may play a 
part in fixing the mercurial dust to the seed. Muskett (36) 
found that the effectiveness of mercurial dusts is related to 
their ability to adhere to the seed, by obtaining better 
results when the dusts are applied and afterwards fixed to the 
flax seed by the use of water or separated milk. 

The relatively low emergence in the peas was 
probably due to watering them immediately after sowing. 

Baylis (If.) found that watering peas immediately after sowing 
markedly depressed emergence, and a steady improvement was 
shown as the date of watering was postponed. A safe practice 
is to sow the seed in slightly moistened soil and not to water 
it until at least three days after sowing. There appears to 
be a critical period during the course of germination when 
high soil moisture is very deleterious. The duration of this

period depends upon the rate of germination, which is related 
to soil temperature* Baylis ( 3 ) stated that the most important 
fungi concerned in preemergence blight of peas are Pythium 
and Fusariuni species. Hull ( 15 ) concluded that the severity 
of preemergence blight of peas is greatly accentuated by high 
soil moisture and that a certain measure of control could be 
obtained by dusting the seed with a commercial mercurial 
preparation. He found that the mercurial compound resulted 
in the greatest increase in stand when the soil was wet and 
when wrinkled-seeded peas were used. On the other hand, 
there is a risk of phytocidal damage when the treatments are 
applied under dry soil conditions. It was also found in the 
present studies that only under high soil moisture conditions 
was a significant difference between the emergence of treated 
and untreated pea seed obtained. 


Under all the soil moisture conditions tested, peas 
showed the greatest tendency to seed decay, followed by flax 
and then wheat. Flax and wheat were most subject to decay 
under low soil moisture, while peas were most subject to de¬ 
cay under conditions of high soil moisture.

EFFECT OF DIFFERENT SOIL TEMPERATURE LEVELS 

ON EMERGENCE 


The temperature tests were carried out in temperature 
control tanks in the greenhouse, in which the soil temperature 
was maintained at 1$°, 20 °, 25 ° and 30 °C and the air tempera¬ 
ture at l 5 °C. Each seed type was tested separately, using ip 
replicates and 25 seeds per crock. That is, there were if. 
crocks with untreated seed and 4 crocks with seed treated with 
Ceresan M to act as checks, at each temperature level. The 
soil moisture was maintained at an optimum level for plant 
growth. The results are presented in Table II.

of plaster of Paris, and found that l5°C was the optimum 
germination temperature of wheat. Higher temperatures of 
20 ° and 30 °C gave more rapid but not so complete germination. 
He found that mold attack on germinating wheat seed was of 
little importance at l£°C, but at 30°C the endosperm of the 
kernel is so affected that there is outward leaching of 
soluble food materials which are readily utilized by ever¬ 
present fungi. Fungal growth was favored at 30°C. He noticed 
an inverse relationship between the total percentage of 
germination and the percentage of moldy kernels. 

Leach (21) states that the relative growth rates 
of the host and pathogen determine to a considerable degree 
the severity of preemergence infection at different tempera¬ 
tures. This growth rate effect would largely explain the 
fairly uniform emergence throughout the different temperature 
levels in the wheat experiment. 

If the emergence at each temperature is totalled 
in the flax experiment, there is a slight increase in emer¬ 
gence with increasing temperature, with the lowest emergence 
at 15°C and the highest at 30°C. Thus, under these conditions 
15 >°C appears to be the most unfavorable temperature at which 
to sow flax. There was considerable post-emergence blighting 
at 30°C so the most favorable temperature appears to be 
between 20° and 25°C.

©mergence also appears to be 15>°C, although the pea-decaying 
organisms seemed extremely active at all the temperatures 
used. They were likely more active at the higher temperatures, 
since for example, the plants at 30°C took five days to 
emerge while those at 15°C took nine days to emerge. If the 
time to emerge had been the same at all the temperatures, 
then it would be reasonable to assume that the greatest de¬ 
crease in emergence would have occurred at the two higher 
temperatures* The effectiveness of chemical treatment seemed 
to increase with increasing temperature. Leach (21) found 
that seed decay and preemergence infection of garden peas 
were most severe between 12° and 2£°C. 

Wallace (lj.Q), Baylis (ij.) and Hull (15) concluded 
that soil temperature was less important than soil moisture 
in its effect upon pea seed decay and preemergence blight. 

In general, preemergence blight is most severe at tempera¬ 
tures that are relatively less favorable to the host than to 
the pathogen. 


Under all soil temperatures used, peas showed the 
greatest tendency to decay, followed by flax and then wheat. 
The emergence of wheat was not significantly reduced at any 
of the temperatures from 1$° to 30°C. Its optimum temperature 
would likely be about 20°C. The lowest emergence in flax and 
peas was at l5°C and the highest emergence was at 30°C.

EFFECT OF DATE OF SEEDING ON EMERGENCE 


This experiment was carried out in the field using 
single row plots consisting of 12 foot rows, 1 foot apart; 

100 seeds were sown in each row at a depth of lj inches. 

Each treatment was replicated four times in randomized blocks. 
Soil moisture analysis was carried out every other day and 
the soil temperature was taken every noon at seed level from 
the time of sowing until the emergence was recorded. Daily 
overnight low temperatures were also recorded. Soil moisture 
and temperature levels are listed in Table III.

The average overnight low soil temperature was 
taken at a depth of Ij. inches, about £0 yards from 
the test plots. 

The soil was rather dry for the first four days 
after seeding the first test, whereas the soil moisture was 
optimum throughout the second test. In general, the seed- 
lings in the early test were exposed to a slightly lower soil 
temperature and to drier conditions than those in the late

growth. Evidence of this is shown in the early seeding of 
peas and the late seeding of wheat. These results substanti¬ 
ate those of the previous moisture and temperature green¬ 
house experiments in that wheat proved the most tolerant of 
the various environmental conditions and peas the least 
tolerant. 


The particularly low emergence from the untreated 
pea seed in the early seeding test could possibly be accounted 
for by the greater activity of Pythium species at the lower 
soil temperature. Ledingham (23) at Saskatoon obtained an 
abrupt decrease in emergence between the first and second pea 
sowing dates* while there was very little change in soil 
temperature# This worker suggested that P. ultimum and other 
organisms concerned in preemergence blighting of peas required 
a period in the spring to initiate active vegetative growth 
and that the early sown peas may have passed their suscep¬ 
tible stage before the fungi had increased sufficiently to 
cause much seed decay. McLaughlin (32) found that the per¬ 
centage of Pythium isolates from the soil were generally 
high in the winter* spring and fall seasons and low in the 
summer. He showed that a combination of high soil tempera¬ 
ture with low soil moisture generally resulted in a reduction 
in the percentage of Pythium isolates, if the first seeding 
had been two weeks earlier the results presented here may have 
been quite different. 


The cultural study of peas is not a simple problem.

but the findings are mainly in agreement that seed protectants 
are beneficial, their value depending on seed and environ¬ 
mental conditions* In England and the United States of America, 
the cardinal factor in preemergence blighting has been shown 
to be excessive soil moisture and, perhaps more particularly, 
rain soon after planting in its tendency to compact the soil 
around the seed, providing moist, poorly aerated conditions* 

Soil temperature has been given a minor role by the English 
workers but in general they consider higher temperatures as 
being conducive to maximum emergence in garden peas* In the 
United States, McNew (33) found progressively less seed 
piece decay with each increase in temperature from 15° through 
20° and 25° to 32°C. Ledingham (23), as well as Hutton (1?) 
of Australia, found a tendency toward poorer emergence as the 
season advanced from cool spring to hot summer* Ledingham 
was able to correlate emergence with temperature but not 
with moisture* 

Summary 

Early seeding increased the emergence of wheat, 
little effected the emergence of flax and reduced the emer¬ 
gence of peas* Regardless of the time of seeding, wheat 
showed the least tendency to decay, followed by flax and then 


peas*

SUMMARY OF THE EFFECT OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS 

ON MERGENCE 

Under all environmental conditions tested, peas 
showed the greatest tendency to decay and wheat the least, 
while flax was intermediateo 

Wheat showed remarkable tolerance to its environ¬ 
ment and especially to soil temperatures during its germina¬ 
tion and emergence period. High emergence was discouraged 
by suboptimum soil moisture and was encouraged by optimum 
soil moisture, a temperature of about 20°C and early spring 
field sowing, 

Loxv soil temperature and moisture favored preemer¬ 
gence blight of flax, while higher soil temperatures and 
moisture levels increased emergence. Field flax may be sown 
early in the spring if a seed protectant is used. 

Peas, the most sensitive of these three grains to 
environmental conditions, readily succumb to high soil moisture 
(especially for the first three days after sowing) and to low 
soil temperatures. Good pea emergence was favored by low 
soil moisture and high soil temperature. Since the soil 
moisture-temperature balance appears to be a very delicate 
one, seed protectants should always be used on garden peas.

ISOLATIONS PROM ROTTED SEEDS 


INTRODUCTION 

In the previous section the influence of soil 
environmental conditions on the decay of wheat, flax and 
pea seed by microorganisms of the common soil microflora 
was considered* Isolation of some of these microorganisms 
from partially rotted seeds was attempted* This is 
discussed in the present section* 

Many workers have isolated organisms carried by 
the seed. Out of 6,201]. surface-sterilized samples of cereal 
seed, Machacek ( 28 ) recovered lp 3 genera and 102 species of 
fungi, the major portion appearing to be innocuous inhabitants 
of the seed. Alternaria was the most common genus and 
Helminthosporium the most common pathogen isolated. Greaney 
(13) associated wheat seed infected with J|. sativum with low 
germination. Fungal hyphae may always be found between the 
epidermis and the inner pericarp of normal wheat seed ( 18 , 37 )• 
Large numbers of certain species of epiphytic bacteria are 
commonly found on Y/heat (20, 2ip, IjJL). 

Padwick (38) made isolations from surface-sterilized 
cotyledons of several varieties of peas grown in sterilized 
and unsterilized soil. He obtained an abundance of common 
molds and several pathogenic fungi, namely: a Fusarium 










- 18 - 


of the section Roseum , Fusarium culmorum and Botrytis cinerea , 

He concluded that the rotting of pea seeds in soil may be 
due to various fungi, and in nature it presumably would fre¬ 
quently be due to the combined effects of several, although 
the greater pathogenicity of the above mentioned pathogenic 
fungi in conjunction with their frequency of isolation and well- 
known wide distribution in soil would suggest their importance* 
Bavlis (3) concluded, that species of pythium were more im¬ 
portant than those of Fusarium in causing pea seed decay* 

METHODS 

(a) Obtaining Partially Rotted Seeds 

Non-treated seeds^’of Red Bobs wheat. Redwing flax 
and Homesteader peas were sown in Edmonton black soil at a 
depth of 1 inch* The soil temperature was maintained in 
controlled temperature tanks at 1$°, 20°, 2$° and 30°C for 
wheat and at 20°C for flax and peas* The moisture content of 
the soil was kept at optimum or slightly above for plant 
growth* Seeds showing signs of decay or delayed germination 
were removed from the soil after the following intervals of 
times ij. days from the 30°0 tank, 7 days from the 2$°C tank, 
llf days from all the tanks and 28 days from the 1$°C tank* 

* The wheat and flax seed was harvested in 194-9 an ^ 

194®» respectively.

(b) Isolation of Microorganisms From the Partially Rotted Seeds 

Upon removal from the soil the seeds were surface- 
sterilized by submerging them for 1 minute in 70 percent 
ethyl alcohol and for 2 minutes in 1:1000 mercuric chloride, 
after which they were washed three times for a period of 5 
minutes in sterile distilled water* 

By means of sterile forceps the surface-sterilized 
seeds were placed in Petri plates containing potato dextrose 
agar at the rate of four seeds per plate. The plating pro¬ 
cedure was varied in the following ways:, by placing the seeds 
on hardened acidified medium, by completely submerging the 
seeds in acidified medium before it hardened, by placing the 
seeds on a hardened medium containing crystal violet, by 
completely submerging the seeds in a medium containing crystal 
violet before it hardened, and by placing the seeds on just- 
hardened medium. The acidification of the medium to pH Ij. with 
2^ percent lactic acid inhibits the growth of bacteria, while 
a medium containing 1:125,000 crystal violet commonly in¬ 
hibits fungal growth and has a bacteriostatic effect upon 
gram-positive bacteria. 

The plated seeds were incubated at the same tempera¬ 
ture as they had been kept at In the soil. Organisms growing 
from the seeds were transferred to potato dextrose agar slants 
and a record was kept of them*

(c) Testing the Isolates 

A preliminary method using one or two replicates, 
was employed to test the seed-rotting capacity of these 
isolates* Surface-sterilized seed was inoculated with them, 
then sown in a sterile 3:1 Edmonton soil-sand mixture in 5>i 
inch pots, at a depth of if- to lj inches, and at the rate of 
25 seeds per pot* The pots for a given organism were held 
at the temperature at which that organism had been isolated. 
Organisms showing seed-rotting ability were retested using 
four replicates and a randomized block design* 

(d) Seed Inoculations 

The following methods of seed inoculation were 
employed in all the seed inoculation tests undertaken in 
the present investigation. The seed was always surface- 
sterilized, as previously described, before being inoculated. 

For bacterial seed inoculation a 10 ml. water 
suspension of a 2l|_ hour culture was poured on the seed. 

The seed was left to soak at room temperature for 2 hours, 
partially vacuumed for 1> minutes, then left to soak again 
for at least 2 more hours before sowing* The liquid inoculum 
was decanted off the seed on the sterile soil at seed level 
before the seeds were sown. This method is similar to that 
employed by Wallin (Ij.2) when working with Xanthomonas translucens 
var. c erealis , only he applied the vacuum pump immediately 
after the inoculum was added to the seed.

The fungal isolates were grown in $0 gm. of a 
sterile 10 percent cornmeal-soil medium in 2^0 ml# Erlenmeyer 
flasks at room temperature for a period of two to three weeks. 
The inoculum was then cut up on the flasks by means of a 
sterile spatula, poured out on sterile soil in pots and mixed 
with the top 3/l| inches of this soil. The seeds were sown 
on this mixture and then covered by more sterile soil. The 
contents of one Erlenmeyer flask v/ere used to inoculate the 
seeds sown in one pot. The medium in the flasks and the soil 
in the pots were steam-sterilized at about l£ pounds pressure 
for three and eight hours, respectively. A 10 percent corn- 
meal medium had previously been used by Henry (IIl). 

RESULTS* 


A summary of the number of seed-decay organisms 
isolated from non-surface-sterilized wheat, flax and pea 
seed after varying periods of time in the soil at different 
temperatures is presented in Table V.

According to these results, more fungi than bacteria 
were isolated from the rotted seeds and more of the former 
than the latter were able to reduce emergence significantly. 

Not only were more organisms isolated at the lower soil 
temperatures, but more of the organisms isolated at these 
temperatures appeared to possess seed-rotting ability; this 
could, of course, be due to the slower growth rate of the 
host plants at the lower soil temperatures. 

There doesn’t appear to be any correlation between 
the number of days wheat seed was in the soil and the number 
of bacteria isolated from the seeds. Seed kept at a soil 
temperature of 20°C for a period of fourteen days produced 
the greatest number of bacterial isolates and yielded the 
only bacterial isolate that was able to reduce the emergence 
of wheat significantly. 

In general, at all the soil temperatures used, the 
number of fungal saprophytes isolafc ed from wheat seed 
increased directly with the period of time the seed was in 
the soil. Fungi capable of causing severe preemergence 
blighting of wheat were isolated from rotting seed at all the 
soil temperatures tested, although the number Isolated from 
soil at 30 °G was rather low. 

The number of fungi and bacteria isolated from 
rotting pea seed was nearly equal. There were over three 
times as many fungi as bacteria isolated from rotting flax

seed. Although peas proved the most susceptible to seed 
decay, a very low portion of the fungi isolated from them 
were capable of rotting their seeds. None of the bacteria 
isolated from flax or pea seed rotted these seeds under the 
conditions tested. 

The above discussion is based solely on the results 
obtained and should be evaluated as such. It is realised that 
any variation in materials or methods, such as in chemicals 
used for surface sterilizing the seeds, or media employed, 
would possibly have a marked effect on the results obtained. 

SUMMARY 

The fungi surpass the bacteria in the number 
isolated from the rotted seeds and in the number able to 
reduce significantly the emergence of wheat, flax and peas. 

The majority of the seed-decay organisms were isolated at 
the lower soil temperatures. The number of saprophytic fungi 
isolated from wheat seed increased directly with the period 
of time the seed was in the soil. Wheat seed-decay fungi 
were isolated at all the soil temperatures tested. A very 
lov/ percentage of the fungi isolated from decaying pea seed 
were able to reduce the emergence of peas significantly*

SEED ROTTING CAPACITY OP FUNGAL 
ISOLATES UNDER VARIOUS CONDITIONS 


INTRODUCTION 


In the previous section fungi capable of signifi¬ 
cantly reducing the emergence of their host when applied to 
seed were isolated from rotting wheat, flax and pea seed® 

The purpose of this section Is to discuss the ability of 
these fungi to rot seeds of the crop plants in question under 
different conditions® 


METHODS 

The experimental methods used in this series of 
tests were the same as those described in the previous section® 

EFFECT OF SOIL TEMPERATURE 

The fungi that were isolated from decaying wheat 
seed at the various soil temperatures and found pathogenic, 
were tested for seed-rotting ability at different soil tempera¬ 
tures® Temperature may alter the susceptibility of the host 
or the pathogenicity of the microorganism® Dickson (9) 
found that the seedling blight organism. Gibberella saubinetii , 
would only produce severe infection of corn at low tempera¬ 
tures and of wheat at high temperatures* In this case

temperature influenced the susceptibility of the host by 
altering it chemically* Low temperatures are known to in¬ 
crease the disease-producing capacity of several fungi in¬ 
cluding Rhizoctonia solani , Fythium ultimum and Tilletia 
caries , while higher temperatures increase the pathogenicity 
of Helminthosporium sativum and Cladosporium fulvum * Leach 
(21) found preemergence infection most severe at temperatures 
that were relatively less favorable to the host than to the 
pathogen as measured by the ratio of their growth rates* 

A comparison was made of the ability of the fungi 
that were isolated in the present studies from wheat seed 
held at soil temperatures of l5°> 20° and 30°G, to reduce 
the emergence of wheat at these soil temperatures* 

After the emergence data was analyzed by the analy¬ 
sis of variance, the mean of each treatment was converted to 
a percentage preemergence blighting on the basis of its 
check* The following formula was used: 

x ™ J X 100 = percent blighting 
x 

where x 22 the percent of emergence in the check 

y =s the percent of emergence in the treatment* 

This method was introduced by Abbott (1) and it seems to 
offer a reliable means for comparing results when several 
series of experiments have been carried on, each based on a 
different check* A summary of the results is presented in 
Table VI.

The majority of the fungi that were isolated at a 
soil temperature of l 5 °C were quite active at all soil 
temperatures tested. In general, the ability of the isolates 
135 to 139 9 inclusive, to produce preemergence blight of 
wheat increased with increasing soil temperature, while the 
310 and 332 isolates appeared relatively ineffective at the 
two higher temperatures* The 34-5 isolate significantly re¬ 
duced the emergence only at 1 $° and 30 °C, being over twice 
as effective at the lower temperature* The following iso¬ 
lates, in decreasing order, caused the most preemergence 
killing: 332 , at a soil temperature of 15 °C, 137 # at a soil 
temperature of 30 °C, and 135 and 13 &, at a soil temperature 
of 20 °C* Six out of these eight isolates showed a wide 
adaptability to the various soil temperatures* 

All the isolates that were obtained at a soil 
temperature of 20°C significantlv reduced the emergence of 
wheat at a soil temperature of l5°0 but not at a soil tempera 
ture of 30 °C* Only isolates lllj. and 127 of these ten isolate 
were more effective in causing preemergence blighting at 20 °C 
than at a soil temperature of 1 >°C* There might have been 
significant reductions in emergence at a soil temperature of 
30°C if there had been greater uniformity within the treat¬ 
ments and if the emergence of the checks had not been so low* 
On a percentage basis of the means, isolates ll\$ and 261j. 
caused more preemergence blighting at a soil temperature of 
30 °C than at the other soil temperatures*

The organisms isolated at a soil temperature of 
30 °C were incapable of causing significant reductions in 
emergence at soil temperatures of 15 ° and 20 °C. The emer¬ 
gence in all the treatments at 20 °C was low and nearly equal. 

In comparing the organisms isolated at the various 
soil temperatures, those isolated at 15°C contain the out¬ 
standing ones so far as seed-rotting ability is concerned. 
While isolates 332 and 34-5 don't appear to possess so wide a 
tolerance to the various soil temperatures as some of the 
other organisms, they were capable of causing the greatest 
decrease in emergence* Isolates 135 and 136 possess a high 
degree of pathogenicity and a wide tolerance to the various 
soil temperatures, since they caused the greatest average 
decrease in emergence, taking into consideration all of the 
temperatures tested. The majority of the organisms isolated 
at 15 °C were more adaptable to the different soil tempera¬ 
tures than those isolated at 20°G, while the 30°G isolates 
appeared to be active only at or near that temperature. 

Discussion 

These preemergence-blighting fungi of wheat, appear 
to have a sufficiently wide temperature range to enable them 
to operate quite effectively at the soil temperatures in 
which wheat is generally sown. Sowing wheat when the soil 
temperature was at a particular level would therefore not be 
a very satisfactory means of avoiding damage completely, but

it might be used to reduce damage. 

Summary 

Five out of the eight pathogenic organisms that 
were isolated from rotting wheat seed at a soil temperature 
of 15>°C significantly reduced the emergence of wheat at soil 
temperatures of 15°, 20° and 30°G. The pathogenicity of 
these five organisms increased with increasing soil tempera* 
ture. The organisms isolated at 20°C proved most pathogenic 
at 15°C and relatively non-pathogenic at a soil temperature 
of 30°Ce The seed-rotting ability of the fungi isolated at 

a soil temperature of 30°C was quite specific for that 
temperature. In general the organisms isolated at a soil 

temperature of ±$°C were least specific in their reactions 
to soil temperature and those isolated at 30°G were most 
specific to soil temperature while the 20°C isolates were 
intermediate. 


EFFECT OF SOIL MOISTURE 


Although all fungi are classified as being aerobic, 
some are known to thrive under near-anaerobic conditions® 

It is the purpose of this experiment to find the level of 
soil moisture most conducive to preemergence blighting® 

Machacek (26), while experimenting with wheat 
seedlings in non-sterile soil, found that if the soil was 
kept too moist the seedlings were frequently attacked by

species of Pythium and damped off, and if the soil was kept 
too dry, the seedlings were occasionally attacked by Rhizoctonia 
solani . His results show that with a decrease in the amount 
of water given a seed bed, there was an increase in the amount 
of blighted seedlings. Although G-ibberella saubinetii and 
some Fusaria are favored by low soil moisture, other Fusaria , 
Helminthosporium sativum and Pythimn species are favored by 
high soil moisture (11). 

The test organisms used in this experiment were 
fungi that had been isolated from rotting wheat seed at a 
soil temperature of 2Q°C. Red Bobs wheat was sown at the 
rate of 25 seeds per pot. The soil moisture was maintained 
at three different levels. Soil moisture analyses were made 
every other day and water was added as necessary to maintain 
the desired level. The mean moisture levels were ll|..5#, 

21.3# and 26 . 3 # for low, optimum and high, respectively. 

The air temperature of the greenhouse varied from a daily 
mean high of 26.£°C to a daily mean low of 11.9°C. The three 
moisture tests were run concurrently on on© bench in the 
greenhouse. Significant differences in the emergence were 
obtained by means of a split-plot analysis. The results are 
presented in Table VII.

There was a highly significant difference in the 
emergence of the wheat seedlings at the three moisture 
levels* The greatest preemergence blighting occurred under 
high soil moisture conditions and the lowest under low soil 
moisture conditions, while the preemergence blighting under 
optimum soil moisture conditions was intermediate* There were 
no significant reductions in emergence by any of the organisms, 
due possibly to the low emergence in the checks* The lo?/ 
emergence in the checks was probably due to early contamination 
after seeding by a multitude of microorganisms which flour¬ 
ished in the sterile soil and cornmeal-soil medium at the 
relatively high greenhouse temperatures* 

v» 

Discussion 

These results are quite opposite to those obtained 
by Machacek (26), and to the results of an earlier experi¬ 
ment reported in this paper, when the greatest decrease in 
the emergence of wheat was obtained under low soil moisture 
conditions. It should be noted though, that the above con¬ 
trary results were obtained when using non-sterile soil. It 
is not reasonable to expect the same results in non-sterile 
soil with its compliment of complex mlcroflora, as in steri¬ 
lized soil containing a single parasitic fungus* 

Summary 

There was a highly significant difference in the 
emergence of the wheat seedlings at the three moisture levels.

The lowest emergence occurred under high soil moisture con¬ 
ditions and the highest under low soil moisture conditions, 
while the emergence under optimum soil moisture conditions 
was slightly higher than intermediate* No other significant 
differences were observed* 

REACTION OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF SEED TO THE SAME FUNGI 

We have seen how these isolates from rotting seed 
react to different soil temperature and moisture levels* A 
major aim of this study was to ascertain their relative 
reactions on different types of seed* That is considered in 
this section. Would these fungal isolates, for instance, 
have the necessary enzyme compliments to enable them to 
attack a seed that was high in starch like wheat as aggres¬ 
sively as ones that were high in lipoids like flax, or high 
in proteins like peas? In an attempt to answer this question, 
preemergence-blighting fungi isolated from each type of 
rotting seed at a soil temperature of 20°G were tested 
against the two other types of seed* Padwick (38) found 
several fungi pathogenic to pea cotyledons that were not 
isolated from peas* Greaney (13) isolated Helminthospopium 
sativum from wheat, barley and rye seed, and found that it 
was only associated with low germination in naturally in¬ 
fested wheat seed. The same seed and methods were used in 
this experiment as were employed in the previous experiments* 
Tests involving the isolates from flax and pea seed were

carried out concurrently against the three types of seed as 
two separate experiments, whereas the isolates from wheat 
seed were tested against the three types of seed in individual 
experiments. In order to make an overall comparison of the 
emergence it was therefore necessary to convert the number of 
seedlings emerged to the percentage of preemergence blighting 
on the basis of their individual checks. This method was 
previously described on page 26, The results are presented 
in Table VIII.

The wheat preemergenee blighting organisms were 
able to rot the seeds of flax much more easily than the seeds 
of peas* In fact, the isolates from II4.3 to 26I4,, inclusive, 
which comprise $0 percent of the wheat isolates tested, 
caused more severe preemergence killing of flax than of wheat. 
Only isolates ill), and ll|3 were able to significantly reduce 
the emergence of peas and these were the only isolates from 
wheat that were capable of significantly reducing the emer¬ 
gence of the three types of seed. Organisms 127, 28l and 286 
appear to be specific wheat seed decay organisms in that 
they were unable to significantly reduce the emergence of 
flax or peas. 

Out of the six preemergence-blighting organisms 
isolated from flax seed, only three: F213 r ,F213q and F236 R 
were capable of significantly reducing the emergence of wheat 
and only one, F236^, was able to significantly reduce the 
emergence of peas. Isolates F120 and Fl2lj. appeared specific 
for flax. Hone of the flax isolates were able to significantly 
reduce the emergence of the three types of seed. 

Neither of the isolates obtained from pea seed 
were capable of preemergence killing of wheat, only one 
significantly reduced the emergence of peas, while they both 
significantly reduced the emergence of flax. 

Discussion 

From these results it would appear that many similar

fungi are capable of causing significant preemergence killing 
of wheat and flax, and that only a few of these fungi are 
able to cause a significant reduction in the emergence of 
peas# This seems a little irregular, since earlier tests 
showed peas the most susceptible of these three seed types to 
seed decay. Padwick (3^) looked upon the rotting of pea 
seed in the soil as a complex disease in which more than one 
distinctly parasitic fungus may be playing a part. He v/as 
able to show, however, that the following fungi from wheat 
were highly pathogenic to pea cotyledons t Fusarium avenaceum , 
F. culmorum , F. graminearum and Helminthosporium sativum . 

Of the three types of seed exposed, flax appears to 
be the most susceptible to preemergence blighting by the 
various fungal isolates. It is interesting to note that a 
fungus which was isolated from decaying pea seed and was 
relatively unable to rot that seed, caused significant pre¬ 
emergence blighting of flax. 

It a rotation plan to minimize preemergence blighting 
was based on these results, it would not seem advisable to 
sow flax in infested soil after wheat or peas. It would also 
not be advisable to rotate wheat with flax, but peas would 
be fairly safe on infested soil upon which flax or wheat had 
grown.

reduce the emergence of wheat, seven were able to reduce the 
emergence of flax and only two were able to reduce the emer¬ 
gence of peas* Three organisms were found specific to wheat, 
while two were able to cause significant preemergence blight¬ 
ing in wheat, flax and peas* Of the six preemergence-blight¬ 
ing organisms isolated from flax, three were found to signi¬ 
ficantly reduce the emergence of wheat and only one the 
emergence of peas* Two were specific to flax and none were 
able to significantly reduce the emergence of the three 
types of seed* Neither of the isolates obtained from pea 
seed were able to cause preemergence killing of wheat, only 
one significantly reduced, the emergence of peas, while both 
significantly reduced the emergence of flax* Flax appeared 
to be the most susceptible to the various isolates* Pre¬ 
emergence blighting of flax and wheat may be caused by a 
fairly similar group of fungi* Only two out of the eighteen 
isolates tested were capable of causing a significant reduction 
in the emergence of the three types of seed, ten caused seed 
decay of two types of seed and five were specific to the 
type of seed from which each was isolated* 

EFFECT OF MISCELLANEOUS FACTORS ON SEEP DECAY

emergence-blighting fungi would act in non-sterile soil, on 
seed treated with a mercurial dust, on injured seed, and on 
normal seed after it had been sown in a soil medium contain¬ 
ing ground seed of the same type. 

Machacek (26) found that the amount of soil-borne 
infection of cereal seedlings by soil-borne organisms was 
negligible when friable, non-sterile soil was kept moist and 
at 20°C. Steam sterilizing changes the physical condition 
of the soil and if it is prolonged, toxic amounts of ammonia 
may be released. 

Hurd (l6) found that if wheat is injured over the 
endosperm, 100 percent fatal infection results when the 
spores of Penicillium or Rhizopus are present; but if the 
injury is over the embryo, the seeds remain practically 
immune. Field and greenhouse tests made at the University 
of Alberta, using non-inoculated seed in non-sterile soil, 
have shown that the reduction in emergence is greater when 
the injury is over the embryo than over the endosperm. 
Previous work at this laboratory has also shown that an in¬ 
crease in emergence due to seed treatment with a mercurial 
fungicide, is greatest with embryo-injured seed, least with 
normal seed and intermediate with endosperm-injured seed. 

The medium upon which the parasite has grown may 
have quite an effect upon it. In the laboratory a fungus 
may be forced to live on artificial substrates for long

periods. Its diet is often unbalanced there since it is 
frequently overfed with carbohydrate and nitrogen compounds. 
In the sudden transference onto a formerly suitable host 
plant, the conversion to the original parasitic mode of life 
cannot always be accomplished rapidly enough. Adaptive 
enzymes, which some fungi possess, must therefore be brought 
into play. Fomes igniarius , the false tinder fungus of 
apple trees,is a more successful parasite when it has pre¬ 
viously been grown on wood from suitable trees than if it 
had been cultured on bread or agar. Gibberella saubinetii , 
after previous culture on oatmeal, killed only 10 percent of 
Pinus seedlings, whereas after culture on steamed rice under 
the same external conditions, it killed f>0 percent of the 
seedlings (12). 

Only wheat was used in this experiment, the endo¬ 
sperm of which was injured by cutting a niche with a scalpel 
approximately J mm. wide, ij- mm. long and i mm. in depth, 
midway on the side of the kernel. Injury to the embryo was 
accomplished by severing the testa over it longitudinally 
with a dissecting needle. All the other seeds used in this 
experiment were hand-picked to ensure their soundness. 
Ceresan M, an organic mercurial fungicide, was used to treat 
the seed. It was applied at the rate of •§■ oz. per bushel. 
The wheatmeal-soil medium contained 10 percent ground wheat 
seed. The test organism chosen was one that had been iso¬ 
lated from rotting wheat seed at a soil temperature of 20°C .

The low emergence in the sterile soil check plots 
was probably due to early post-seeding contamination of the 
sterile cornmeal-soil medium, since a similar decrease in 
emergence was obtained when this inoculum was placed in non- 
sterile soil. Further evidence of this is that a highly 
significant increase in emergence was obtained when Ceresan 
M treated seed was sown in non-sterile soil. Although these 
contaminating organisms were very effective in reducing 
emergence, the seed treatment appeared quite effective against 
them and relatively ineffective aga5_nst isolate ll|3» 

Whether isolate ll}3 was present or not, the emergence 
of endosperm-injured seed was very significantly better than 
that of embryo-injured seed, and nearly equal to that of 
normal seed. Isolate 1I4.3 significantly reduced the emer¬ 
gence of endosperm-injured seed over its check, but not that 
of embryo-injured seed. 

After previous growth on a wheatmeal-soil medium, 
isolate li|3 significantly reduced the emergence of wheat 
over its check. This could either mean an increase in its 
pathogenicity due to the medium or that the wheatmeal-soil 
medium proved less favorable to contaminants than did the 
cornmeal-soil medium. 

Discussion 

These results stress that one cannot be too 
cautious in avoiding contamination when using sterile soil

under relatively high temperature conditions* Similar methods 
proved satisfactory under moderate temperature conditions* 

The relative predisposition of seed to decay by mechanical 
injury, was found to be similar to that obtained by earlier 
experiments in this laboratory, and different from the results 
obtained by Hurd (l6), in that the embryo-injured seed 
appeared to be much more liable to preemergence blighting 
than endosperm-injured seed* Since the Ceresan M seed treat¬ 
ment was ineffective in preventing preemergence blight by 
isolate ll|3* it would suggest that this isolate attacked the 
seedling rather than the seed itself* It is of practical 
significance that the normal soil microflora did not appear 
to nullify the preemergence blighting ability of isolate llj_3• 

Summary 

Although Ceresan M was non-effective against iso¬ 
late llp3> it significantly increased the emergence of normal 
wheat in non-sterilized soil* Regardless of treatment, embryo- 
injured seed showed the lowest emergence, \fhile the emergence 
of endosperm-injured seed was nearly equal to that of normal 
seed* The fungus isolate ll|3 significantly reduced the 
emergence of endosperm-Injured seed, and of normal seed 
after it was grown on a 10 percent wheatmeal-soil medium, 
over their checks. This fungus also significantly reduced 
the emergence of embryo-injured seed over endosperm-Injured 
seed that had been inoculated with it.

SUMMARY OF THE SEED-ROTTING CAPACITY OF THE DIFFERENT 

FUNSAL ISOLATES UNDER VARIOUS CONDITIONS 


Preemergence blighting fungi that were isolated 
from decaying wheat seed at soil temperatures of l£ 0 , 20° 
and 30°C were tested for their ability to rot wheat seed 
over this range of temperatures. In general these isolates 
proved quite active at all the soil temperatures tested. 

Those isolated at l£°C were the most active and those iso¬ 
lated at 30°C the least active. 

The wheat seed-decaying fungi that were isolated 
from rotting wheat seed at a soil temperature of 20°G were 
tested against wheat seed at low* optimum and high soil 
moisture levels. Highly significant differences in emergence 
were obtained between each of the moisture levels, with the 
lowest emergence in high soil moisture and the highest emer¬ 
gence in low soil moisture, while the emergence under optimum 
soil moisture conditions was intermediate. 

The fungi that were isolated from decaying wheat, 
flax and pea seed at a soil temperature of 20°C were tested 
against each of these seeds. The majority of the fungi iso¬ 
lated from either flax or wheat seed were able to cause 
significant preemergence blighting of flax and wheat but not 
of peas. Of the eighteen isolates tested, the following 
were capable of causing a significant reduction in emergences 
two from wheat of the three seed types, ten of two seed

types, and five were specific to the seed types from which 
they were isolated* Flax appeared to be the most susceptible 
to the various isolates and peas the least susceptible. The 
majority of these fungi were non-specific to one seed type. 

When one 20°C wheat isolate was tested against 
wheat seed under various conditions, it was found to signifi¬ 
cantly reduce the emergence of endosperm-injured seed, and of 
normal seed after it was grown on a 10 percent wheatmeal- 
soil medium, over their checks. It also significantly re¬ 
duced the emergence of embryo-injured seed over endosperm- 
injured seed. Regardless of treatment, embryo-injured seed 
showed the lowest emergence, while the emergence of endo¬ 
sperm-injured seed was nearly equal to that of normal seed. 
Although Ceresan M was non-effective against isolate lip3, it 
increased the emergence of normal wheat to a highly signifi¬ 
cant degree in non-sterile soil.

PERSISTENCE OP CHEMICAL SEED 
PROTECTANTS ON SEED IN 
THE SOIL 


INTRODUCTION 


The foregoing work demonstrated the value, and 
strongly suggested the need, of seed protectants when certain 
plants are grown from seed in soil. Much work has been done 
on the testing of various substances as seed protectants (6, 
8 , 19 , 31 ) 9 on determining suitable rates of application and 
wider uses of substances which show promise as seed dressings 
(8, 30); also on their relative toxicity to pathogens (1+6, 

35) j plants (8), and animals. Work has also been done on 
their seed-adhering properties when used with inert dusts 
(10, 1 + 3)5 with water (10, 22), or with oil (10); on their 
decomposition in soil (5, 7)? and on their effect on the 
soil flora (5)I on the accuracy and uniformity of application 
by means of commercial seed treating machines (27), and on 
methods of assaying them ( 2 , 22 , 25, 27 , 29 , 3 I+, 39) • To 
the writer ! s knowledge, no work has been published on the 
persistence of these seed fungicides on seed in the soil. 
Therefore such studies were undertaken and are discussed in 


the present section

METHODS 


Wheat, flax and pea seeds were sown within three days 
after treatment with commercial seed protectants, at a depth 
of lj- inches in a 3:1 Edmonton soil-sand mixture, in 5 inch 
pots at the rate of at least 25 seeds per pot* The seed 
used was Red Bobs wheat. Redwing flax and Homesteader peas. 

The pots were placed on an open bench in the greenhouse and 
watered daily. 

At daily intervals four seeds were removed from 
the soil of each seed treatment and freed of growth and ad¬ 
hering soil. These were placed in a Petri dish containing a 
suspension of potato dextrose agar and the test fungus, just 
before the agar hardened. The plates were incubated at about 
25°C for 24 - 36 hours. The persistence of the fungicides 
was determined by inverting the Petri plates and measuring 
the average radius of the zones of inhibition of the test 
fungus around the seeds. The test fungus had been isolated 
from a decaying wheat seed at a soil temperature of 20°C. 
Although it proved non-pathogenic to wheat, it is a profuse 
producer of spores, grows rapidly and in general serves very 
well as a test organism. 

About 3 ml. of agar was added to Petri plates used 
for wheat and flax, and about 10 ml. to those used for peas. 

The wheat and flax seeds were completely submerged in the 
agar, whereas the pea seeds were only partially embedded in

it. A large loopful of spores, (and probably some mycelium) 
of the test organism was suspended in 10 ml. of sterile 
distilled water, and 1 ml. of the suspension was added to 
each Petri plate. Observations were made of the amount of 
growth from the seed and the condition of the seed when it 
was removed from the soil. 

RELATIVE PERSISTENCE OF CERESAN M ON VIABLE AND NON-VIABLE 

WHEAT, FLAX AMD PEA SEED IN SOIL UNDER 

GREENHOUSE CONDITIONS 

This experiment was carried out to compare the re¬ 
lative persistence of Ceresan M on viable and non-viable 
wheat, flax and pea seed in the soil, and to check the 
possibility of antifungal substances being produced by ger¬ 
minating seed. If non-viable seed produced results similar 
to viable seed, it was planned to use the former in the sub¬ 
sequent tests. 

The non-viable seeds were prepared by exposing 
viable seeds for two minutes to 15 pounds steam pressure in 
an autoclave, after which they were dried at room temperature. 
Ceresan M was applied at the rate of 1 oz. per bushel for 
flax and peas, and J- oz. per bushel for wheat. The seeds 
were manually shaken for a period of five minutes in stoppered 
containers after the fungicide was added, to help ensure an 
even distribution. The stoppers were then removed. The 
other methods employed are similar to those previously des-

w The results for the untreated viable and non- 
viable seed, which served as checks, were omitted 
from the above table since they caused no inhibi¬ 
tion of the test organism* 


After seed treatment the amount of Ceresan M ad¬ 
hering to the non-viable seed, as indicated by the size of 
the zone of inhibition, was much less on flax, and slightly 
more on wheat and peas than that on viable seed. After one 
day in the soil the amount of seed dressing persisting on 
non-viable seed was less than that on viable seed for all

the seed types. Viable wheat exhibited the greatest ability 
to retain the fungicide, since after four days in the soil 
it produced a trace of a halo, whereas all the other treat¬ 
ments failed to produce any inhibition after the seeds were 
two days in the soil. 

The wheat seed treated with Ceresan M made slightly 
more rapid growth than the untreated seed. Seed treatment 
had little effect on the growth of flax and peas. By the 
fourth day in the soil, the viable flax seeds were discarding 
their seed coats. Much trouble was experienced from soil 
adhering to the non-viable, seed treated and non-seed treated 
flax and pea seed. By the fifth day in the soil, the non- 
viable, non-treated pea seeds were very water-soaked, fell 
apart easily, and the seed coat tended to be shed with the 
adhering soil. Ceresan M appeared relatively ineffective in 
preventing the decay of non-viable pea seed. Such seed 
proved more subject to decay than untreated, viable pea seed* 

Discussion 

Due to the variance in the ability of the fungicide 
to adhere to non-viable seed as compared to viable seed, and 
to its more rapid deterioration in the soil, it would appear 
inadvisable to use non-viable seed in any subsequent tests 
of this sort. Hurd (l6) found that death renders previously 
immune wheat seeds immediately susceptible to attack by

Penicillium and Rhizopus * It does not appear to be an easy 
matter to compare the relative adhesiveness of the fungicide 
on the three types of seed by the method employed in this 
paper due to the difference in the size of their seed* 

This type of bioassay, though simple, is not with¬ 
out faults. Some contamination occurred in the Petri plates 
from soil adhering to the seed and likely from the seed it¬ 
self* The frequency of contamination increased with increasing 
time the seed was in the soil* Probably the easiest way to 
avoid this contamination would be to employ a test organism 
that would grow rapidly in a very acidic medium at low tempera¬ 
tures* In preliminary tests the size of the zone of inhibi¬ 
tion was found to vary with the concentration of the test 
organism and its concentration would vary with the amount of 
agar added to the plate. The radius of the halos was also 
found to decrease in size, to the average extent of 1 mm., 
during the period of incubation from 2lj. to hours* Thorn- 
berry (39)* when using paper disks on the surface of the 
agar to test toxicants, found that with a relatively thick 
layer of ”seeded” agar, the zones of inhibition would have a 
cone-shaped, poorly defined margin which was difficult to 
measure* Other factors affecting the size of the halo would 
be: uniformity of coverage of the fungicide (27* 43)* the 
type of filler, its state of subdivision and whether or not 
substances of an adhesive nature had been added (10, l|3)l 
the interval between treating and seeding ( 27 )* also the

amount of agitation the treated seed was exposed to before 
seeding (10). Pitzgibbon (10) demonstrated that the general 
adhesive characteristics of seed dressings are fairly well 
maintained from one variety of seed to another, so that a 
dressing satisfactory for any one cereal tested will be 
satisfactory for all in this respect. 

Summary 

Ceresan M did not persist as well in the soil on 
non-viable wheat, flax and pea seed as it did on the same 
types of viable seed. Regardless of treatment the non- 
viable seed was more subject to decomposition in the soil 
than the viable seed. Of the seed types tested, viable wheat 
exhibited the greatest ability to retain the fungicide, since 
after four days in the soil it produced a trace of a halo, 
whereas all the other treatments failed to produce any 
inhibition of the test organism after two days in the soil. 
The untreated viable and non-viable seed failed to inhibit 
the growth of the test organism.

of treatment; as measured by the ability of these seed dres¬ 
sings to persist on viable wheat, flax and pea seed in the 
soil under greenhouse conditions* 

Manufacturers are endeavoring to produce fungicides 
which possess high toxicity to microorganisms and low toxicity 
to higher animals* This quality is found to a greater ex¬ 
tent in many of the non-mercurial than in the mercurial pre¬ 
parations* The hazard to humans of inhaling poisonous dusts 
while treating grain has been overcome by using some of the 
preparations in liquid form. 

The methods employed in this experiment were similar 
to those described on page l|9* and seed from the same stock 
was used* The trade names of the fungicides used, along with 
their active ingredients and rates of application, are listed

The other rates of application are either those 
recommended by the manufacturer, or those that were found to 
be satisfactory and are in common use. The fungicides were 
vigorously shaken with the seed for a period of five minutes 
in stoppered Erlenmeyer flasks, after which the stoppers 
were removed, except in the case of panogen lip which remained 
in a stoppered Erlenmeyer for a period of l\B hours. Only 
Geresan M slurry and Panogen lip were applied in liquid form.

The fungicides appeared more persistent on wheat 
and pea seed them on flax seed in the soil. Orthocide l\.Ob 
proved far superior to the other seed dressings in its ability 
to persist on each of the seed types in the soil. Even after 
remaining I4.9 days on wheat seed in the soil, it was capable 
of producing some inhibition of the growth of the test organism. 
Of the other seed dressings, Panogen 1)4 persisted longest on 
wheat (two days), Ceresan M dust, the longest on peas (three 
days), while none of the other fungicides persisted on flax 
seed even after one day in the soil. The hexachlorobenzene 
formulation on seed failed to show any fungistatic effect 
against the test organism. The wet seed treatments did not 
appear superior to the dry seed treatments, and except for 
Orthocide lj.06, the non-mercurial preparations proved inferior 
to the mercurial seed dressings in their ability to persist 
on seed in the soil. On wheat and peas, but not on flax, 
the Orthocide L4O6 preparation appeared to increase in fungi¬ 
cidal activity after one day in the soil. The ability of 
the various fungicides to adhere to wheat and flax seed when 
not exposed to the soil, exhibited the same trend, the order 
in decreasing adhesiveness being Orthocide I4O6, Ceresan M 
slurry, Panogen 1I4., Ceresan M dust, MTH, and C.X.L. Bunt 
Cure. While on pea seed Ceresan M slurry was the most ad¬ 
herent, Orthocide lj.06, Ceresan M dust and MTH were nearly 
equal; while Panogen 1J4 showed quite poor adhering qualities. 

Ho pronounced phytocidal effect from any of the treatments 
was noticed. Fungicide persistence tests on flax were dis-

continued after four days in the soil since the seeds had lost 
their seed coats by that time. They were discontinued on 
wheat and peas after i.j-9 and 3>k- days in the soil, respectively, 
due to lack of treated seed material. 

discussion 

Although the majority of the fungicides did not appear 
to persist on the seed for a prolonged period of time in the 
soil, it is possible that their protective effect may be 
exerted in the soil surrounding the seed for a longer period 
of time. Machacek (27) tested solutions of fungicides of 
various concentrations by absorbing them on paper disks and 
plating them on M seeded” agar. He found that the amount of 
diffusion of two of the fungicides was related to concentration, 
but that the diffusion of three fungicides was not so related. 
Thornberry (39) found that this method could not be used with 
cationic toxicants since they are adsorbed by the agar. Fung¬ 
icides would also vary in their ability to act at a distance. 
Caution should therefore be exercised when evaluating the 
persistence of different fungicide preparations by the method 
employed in this paper* 

Baines ( 7 ) found that in soils where mercurials are 
effective as fungicides, that the mercury compounds are reduced 
by the soil to metallic mercury which migrates in the soil as 
mercury vapors. Any factor that prevents the conversion of 
a mercury salt to metallic mercury destroys the fungicidal 

effects of the mercury. Some of these limiting factors 
are: The presence of mercury-precipitating ions; a 




- 6l - 


soil with a high mercury-binding capacity; also a soil having 
a high oxidation, and conversely, a low reducing potential* 
Under moist aerobic conditions, Booer (5>) found that the 
addition of 0*2 percent powdered sulfur to the soil, whilst 
producing no immediate effect, completely eliminated in four 
to seven days the retardation of plant growth resulting from 
the addition of 0.02 percent mercury. The formation of 
mercuric sulfide is the means by which the toxic effect of 
mercury is eliminated from soil under field conditions from 
season to season (5)« 

Summary 

Orthocide i|06 proved far superior to the other seed 
dressings tested in its ability to persist on wheat, flax 
and pea seed in the soil. Of the other seed dressings, 
Panogen lip persisted the longest on wheat, Ceresan M in dust 
form the longest on peas, while none persisted on flax seed 
in the soil long enough to make a comparison. Bunt Cure on 
seed proved inactive against the test organism used and 
hence its persistence on seed in the soil could not be 
measured. The wet seed treatments did not appear superior 
to the dry seed treatments, and except for Orthocide Ip 06 >, 
the non-mercurial preparations proved inferior in their 
ability to persist on seed in the soil to the mercurial seed 
dressings. Although the ability of the various fungicides 
to adhere to wheat and flax seed v/hen not exposed to the 
soil exhibited the same trend, they appeared more persistent

Ceresan M, used as a dust, did not persist as well 
in the soil on non-viable wheat, flax and pea seed, as it did 
on the same types of viable seed. Regardless of treatment, 
the non-viable seed was more subject to decomposition in the 
soil than the viable seed. Of the six fungicide preparations 
tested, Orthocide 1|06 proved superior to the others in its 
ability to persist on viable wheat, flax and pea seed in the 
soil. The dry seed treatments were about equal to the wet 
seed treatments in their ability to persist on seed in the 
soil, and except for Orthocide 1|06, the non-mercurial pre¬ 
parations proved inferior to the mercurial seed dressings 
in this respect. According to this method of testing, the 
fungicides were more persistent on wheat and pea seed than on 
flax seed in the soil®

GENERAL DISCUSSION 


The differences in the susceptibility to decay of 
the three kinds, of seed included in this study, are probably 
explainable on the basis of the availability of their food 
supply to microorganisms of the soil. The garden pea seed 
which proved most susceptible to decay is known to have a 
readily available supply of simple carbohydrates together 
with a high protein content. This combined with its slower 
growth rate and its more vulnerable seed coat renders it 
very susceptible to decay. 

More fungi than bacteria were found capable of 
causing seed decay of wheat, flax and pea seed in the soil. 
The fungi are likely capable of a faster entry into the seed 
whereas the bacteria, would be more dependent on natural 
openings in the seed coat for their entry. 

The methods employed for the isolation of organisms 
responsible for seed decay were satisfactory for obtaining 
these organisms from wheat and flax seed. They were 
unsatisfactory for obtaining them from pea seed, since a 
very low number of organisms isolated from decaying pea seed 
was separately capable of decaying them. 

Soil environmental conditions exert a marked influ¬ 
ence on the amount of seed decay, but usually only conditions

which are relatively less favorable to the host than to the 
pathogen result in much of this decay. The soil moisture 
and temperature when not at an optimum level for the host 
will have a strong bearing on the amount of seed decay. Soil 
low in moisture was found to favor the decay of wheat and 
flax seed, while high soil moisture favored that of pea seed. 
Soil temperature exerted its influence by encouraging the 
decay of flax and pea seed when low, and that of wheat seed 
when high. 

In nature the amount of seed decay would vary with 
the changes in the soil environment. The critical period 
would be the first two weeks following seeding. Some control 
of the soil environmental factors may be obtained through 
cultural practices such as varying the date of seeding, 
rotating the crops and regulating the water supply. Wheat 
sown late in the spring was found to be much more susceptible 
to seed decay than that which was sown early. Flax seed is 
relatively susceptible to decay by fungi capable of decaying 
wheat or pea seed. This finding could apply in a crop 
rotation by avoiding the sowing of flax on land where much 
decay of wheat or pea seed had occurred. 

Since the environmental conditions of the soil are 
relatively unpredictable, it is important to have at least 
the most susceptible seeds protected by chemicals. To be 
effective, the chemicals must inhibit the growth of the seed 
decay organisms on or near the seed in the soil. In addition.

ability to persist on the seed should increase their 
protective value. Of the six fungicides tested, only Ortho- 
cide 1|.06 was outstanding in its ability to persist on seed 
in the soil, but aside from this fungicide, the non-mercurial 
preparations were inferior to the mercurial seed dressings 
in this respect. The majority of the fungicides only persisted 
on the seed in the soil for a day or two. Since many of them 
are known to be effective in reducing the incidence of seed 
decay, it may be that they exert their effect in the soil 
surrounding the seed for a longer period of time.

SUMMARY 


1* Under all environmental conditions tested, pea seed 

showed the greatest tendency to decay in the soil, wheat 
the least, while flax was intermediate* 

2* Decay of pea seeds was encouraged by high soil 

moisture (especially for the first three days after 
sowing) and by low soil temperatures* 

3* High temperature and low moisture encouraged the 

decay of wheat seeds in the soil* 

1^. Low soil temperature and moisture favored preemer¬ 

gence blight of flax* 

5* Fungi were found to be the most important seed- 

rotting microorganisms* 

6* Seed held at low soil temperatures yielded most of 

the seed-rotting fungi which were isolated* 

7* The number of fungal saprophytes isolated from 

decaying wheat seed increased directly with the period 
of time the seed was in the soil* 

8* In general, the preemergence blighting fungi that 

were isolated from decaying wheat seed at soil tempera¬ 
tures of 15°, 20° and 30°C proved quite adaptable in

their ability to rot wheat seed over this range of temp¬ 
eratures. 

9. Sterile soil with a high moisture content proved 

more conducive to wheat seed decay by fungi that had 
been isolated from rotting wheat seed than sterile soil 
with a lower moisture content. 

10. Flax appeared to be more susceptible than wheat 
or peas to preemergence blighting by fungi that were 
isolated from decaying wheat, flax and pea seed. 

11. Preemergence blighting of wheat by a fungus isolate 
was most severe when embryo-injured seed was used. 
Endosperm-injured seed proved only slightly more sus¬ 
ceptible to it than normal seed. 

12. The seed fungicide, Ceresan M, used as a dust, did 
not persist as well in the soil on non-viable wheat, flax 
and pea. seed, as it did on viable seed of the same types. 

13. Orthocide Ipo6 proved much superior to the other 
fungicides tested in its ability to persist on viable 
wheat, flax and pea seed in the soil. 

lit. Except for Orthocide i|06, the non-mercurial 

fungicides proved inferior to the mercurial seed dressings 
in their ability to persist on seed in the soil. 

Most of the fungicides tested were more persistent 
on wheat and pea seed, than on flax seed in the soil.
