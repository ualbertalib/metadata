ABSTRACT 


Tiie technique of paper chroma to graphy has been 
adapted to the identification of the free and bound amino 
acids of healthy and diseased wheat roots of the Thatcher 
variety* N-butanol, glacial acetic acid and water (4:1;5 
by volume) , and phenol-water (80% phenol by volume) was 
found to be a satisfactory solvent pair for two dimensional 
studies. A total of 13 known amino acids and six unknown 
ninhydrin spots were found in alcoholic extracts of dried 
wheat root samples* Chromatograms showed a lower concen¬ 
tration of these amino acids, except glutamic acid, in 
healthy than in those infected with the root-rot organism 
Helrninthosporium sativum * Kjeldahl determinations also 
showed a lower total nitrogen content in the healthy roots. 
Certain free amino acids added to Czapek’s medium on which 
E. sativum was subsequently cultured were found to decrease 
the pathogenicity of this fungus to wheat seedlings* The 
evidence suggests that certain amino acids may be of im¬ 
portance in the relative susceptibility of different var¬ 
ieties to H. sativum*

STUDIES OF THE FREE AND BOUND AMINO ACIDS IN HEALTHY 


AND DISEASED WHEAT ROOTS 


S. B. Hrushovetz 


INTRODUCTION 


Paper chromatographic analysis is a very 
recent development in analytical chemistry. Consden, 

Gordon, and Martin (41) first used paper strips for the 
separation of amino acids in 1944* In less than ten 
years almost every group of compounds has been investi¬ 
gated and separated by partition chromatography procedures 
on paper. 

This dissertation has a threefold purpose: 

(a) to review the literature on paper chromato¬ 
graphy; 

(b) to apply these techniques to an investigation 
of a problem in plant pathology; and finally, 

(c) to interpret the results of these investi- 
ga tions.

INTRODUCTION 


The literature on chromatography, especially 
in the last five years, has been very extensive. As a 
result only the more important references will be cited. 
Chromatography, as any branch of analytical chemistry, 
has developed a terminology all its own. To facilitate 
a clearer understanding of the discussion to follow, defi¬ 
nitions of the various terms and symbols that may be 
encountered in the literature are therefore included here. 
GLOSSARY 

Adsorbent - is the bulk phase consisting of either solid 

or liquid at the boundary of which the adsorp¬ 
tion occurs (34). 

Adsorption - accumulation of a solute or substance in a 

boundary region. It is a phenomenon of the inter- 
phase and the requirement for adsorption is that 
the concentration of the substance in the inter¬ 
phase b© greater than that of the substance in the 
contiguous phases. (34). Adsorption depends on the

preferential affinity of the adsorbent for 
certain structural groups of the solute 
molecules (169). 

Adsorptive - substance that is adsorbed. 

Aqueous phase - in mixing two partially miscible liquids, 

one being water, so that two phases appear, the one 
containing the higher concentration of water is the 
aqueous phase (41). 

Ascending technique - upward or vertical migration of the sol¬ 
vent or mobile phase on a strip or sheet of filter 
paper (188). 

Bioautograph - a developed chromatogram in which the different 
solutes are revealed microbiologically (191). 

Capillary analysis - method of chemical analysis introduced 
by Schoenbein and Goppelsroeder in which the sub¬ 
stances separate into distinct zones due to capil¬ 
lary action. The principle here is similar to 
Tswett*s chromatographic adsorption (170). 

Chamber - an air-tight vessel employed for irrigating strips 
or sheets of filter paper with a solvent (41). 

Chromatobar - a casting of the adsorbent of a chromato¬ 
strip (114). 

Chromatogram - a developed or irrigated sheet of filter 
paper containing the solute mixture. Also see 
page nine.

Chromatopak - a column prepared by placing sheets or strips 
of filter paper side by side (114, 118). It is 
similar to chromatopile. 

Chromatography - method of organic analysis introduced by 
Tswett. It depends on different degrees of ad¬ 
sorption of compounds or solutes in the same and 
different adsorbents and solvents. (£00). 

Chromatopile - column prepared by clamping together a large 
number of filter papers (114). 

Chromatostrip - a glass slide coated with a film of the 
adsorbent (114). 

Column - glass tubing filled with an adsorbent. This is 

used for adsorption or chromatographic analysis. 

Countercurrent distribution - a discontinuous extraction 
process carried to a high number of stages(46). 

It is actually a partition effect where two immis¬ 
cible liquids are allowed to flow past each other 
and the solute present distributes itself between 
the two liquids. 

Descending technique - downward migration of solvent or mobile 
phase on a strip or sheet of filter paper in a 
chamber carrying the solute mixture with it (41). 

Developer - is the solvent or mobile phase that is used to 
irrigate the paper and does not refer to the 
solution used for spraying the chromatogram.

Displacement development - where the original mixed solution 
is placed on the column in small volume and is 
washed through with a solution of some displacing 
agent (171). 

Elution development - where the original mixed solution is 
placed on the column in small volume and washed 
through with pure solvent (171). 

Frontal analysis - where the original mixed solution is 
passed continuously through the column (171). 

Ion exchange - the replacing of the surface ions of a resin 
or other similar substances in a column, by the 
solutes being investigated (96). 

Ionography - the separation of substances with small differ¬ 
ences in ionic mobility at given pH’s by use of a 
current and employing a slab of silica jelly (42) 
or filter paper (107) instead of a diaphragm cell. 

Liquid chromatogram - where portions of a liquid percolating 
through a column are collected separately, e.g., 
the automatic sampling collectors of Moore and 
Stein (119). 

Mobile phase - is that phase in a chromatographic system that 
travels carrying the solutes with it. Actually the 
solutes are in the interphase between the mobile 
and stationary phase. 

Papryography - the name suggested by Dent (53) for partition 


chromatography on paper

Partition - often called adsorption and denotes the amount 
of solute in the two phases (46). 

Partition coefficient - see Symbols. 

Partography - a name often applied to the type of partition 
chromatography introduced by Martin and Synge (112, 
146) where they immobilized one of the liquid phases, 
i.e., papryography. 

Solute - the known or unknown substance that is spotted on 
the paper. 

Solvent - is the liquid used to irrigate the filter paper 
and is often called the mobile phase. 

Spraying reagent - is a substance sprayed on a dried chroma¬ 
togram to show various constituents. Work is 
related to Piegl’s spot test technique (58). 

Stationary phase - or immobile phase. In paper chromatogra¬ 
phy the aqueous phase of the solvent together with 
the filter paper make up the stationary phase. 

Surface active - same as Adsorption. See above. 

Theoretical plates - refers to the number of separations that 
occur in partition chromatography. A certain defi¬ 
nite number of plates or separations are required 
before one can get separation of two similar solutes 
in a mixture. 

Ultrachromatography - application of ultra violet light to 

detect zones in developed columns or spots on paper 
chromatograms (200).

HISTORY OF CHROMATOGRAPHY 


The best review on this topic is given by Zech- 
meister and Cholnoky (200). In their discussion of priority 
they give Michael Tswett most of the credit* The first 
eight page article that this botanist published in June 
1906, which was on the chromatography of the leaf pigments 
of plants using powdered chalk as the adsorbent and petrol 
ether as the solvent, is taken by the authors as the official 
birthday of chromatography. This may be true for adsorption 
chromatography in a column, although Weil and Williams (185) 
do not agree. However, paper chromatography actually origi¬ 
nated in 1861 when Schonbein and his pupil G-oppelsroeder 
observed that solutes of dyes concentrate in distinct zones 
if solutions of them are drawn into strips of filter paper 
by capillary action (170). 

Partition of organic solutes between two immiscible 
liquids, i.e., counter current distribution (46), has been 
widely used in organic chemistry for extraction purposes. 
However, with this technique many difficulties are encountered, 
the chief one being that the process is discontinuous and so 
makes extraction of an homologous series very tedious. Martin 
and Synge (112) overcame this difficulty by partition in a 
column. They immobilized one of the liquids (water) by 
soaking silica in water until a gel formed, and this silica- 
water complex was placed in a glass cylinder and formed the

immobile liquid phase. Thus they obtained a continuous 
extraction process using Craig’s partition or counter current 
distribution principle. This column has little or no adsorp¬ 
tion properties since the silica serves only as mechanical 
support for the water. Three years elapsed (1944) before the 
ingenious idea of employing filter paper as the mechanical 
support for the stationary liquid phase was tried. Because 
of this discovery, Consden, Gordon and Martin (41) are recog¬ 
nized as the pioneers in paper partition chromatography. 
Probably the use of starch and powdered cellulose in Tswett’s 
columns as adsorbents might have been partially responsible 
for this very useful new development in analysis. The method 
of cross capillary analysis or two dimensional chromatography 
(41, 53) quickly followed. To this were soon added reverse 
phase techniques (192, 127), impregnation of paper with ad¬ 
sorbents (49), electrophoretic adaptations (107), salting 
out processes (103) and many other valuable modifications. 

The result is that very many groups of compounds in both the 
organic and inorganic field, as shown in Table 2, have been 
analyzed and separated by the careful choice of solvents and 
the use of the modifications listed above. 

TYPES OF CHROMATOGRAPHY 

Tswett was the originator of the term Chromatogra¬ 
phy. In discussing a petroleum ether solution extract of 
chlorophyll pigments after they were placed in a column and

washed with solvent, Tswett writes, ".then the 

pigments according to the adsorption sequence, are resolved 
from top to bottom in colored zones, since the stronger 
adsorbed pigments displace the weaker adsorbed ones and 
force them downwards .... Like light rays in the spectrum, 
so the different components of a pigment mixture are resolved 
on the calcium carbonate column according to a law and can 
be estimated qualitatively and quantitatively. Such a pre¬ 
paration I term a chromatogram and the corresponding method, 
the chromatographic method". (300). In modern literature 
this method is called Tswett 1 s adsorption analysis. The 
word "chromatographic" is ommitted, as various non-colored 
compounds have now been separated. 

However, adsorption is just one of the phenomena 
that may occur in a Tswett column. In all there are three 
types of adsorbents (170). These are: 

(a) Surface Active - those characterized by Tswett’s 
adsorption analysis. Separation here depends on the 
variation in their adsorption capacities and in their 
selectivity or specificity for certain groups in the 
compounds being analyzed. 

(b) Ion Exchange - those in which the particles exist 
as ions. Separation depends on the great combining 
capacity as well as on the rapid exchange rate and high 
reversibility of reaction with the solutes. The outer 
ions of ion exchange resin particles are not bound as 
tightly as the larger inner ones to the lattice frame-

work and so they permit this rapid exchange with solute 
particles (96)* 

(c) Partition Adsorbents - those in which the adsor¬ 
bent plays no part in separation, serving only as a 
mechanical support for the stationary liquid phase 
(112). Here the separation depends on the partition 
coefficient of the solutes in the chosen miscible or 
immiscible solvent pair. 

The solvents used may partially alter the adsor¬ 
bents so that more than one of the above types may be acting 
at one time. This partially explains why chromatographic 
separations in columns are still largely empirical. Modifi¬ 
cation in method of solvent application results in different 
developments of the chromatogram. Thus we may have frontal 
analysis, elution development or displacement chromatography 
(see glossary). The liquid chromatogram as developed by 
Tiselius and co-workers (40) shows how analysis can be accom¬ 
plished by the correct choice of a solvent. As the solvent 
percolates through the column, it replaces the adsorbed 
solute particles so that the latter now appear in the eluant. 
The above examples show the different types of adsorption 
chromatography. 

A comprehensive report on the various types of 
chromatography, with their chief underlying principles, is 
given by Meinhard (116). He mentions that the scope of 
modern chromatography can best be gained by considering this 
process from the standpoint of competing equilibria. In

general, the stationary phase (adsorbent) and the mobile 
fluid (solvent) compete with each other for solutes origi¬ 
nally present in the fluid phase. The interactions are 
reversible and may be represented by the following relation¬ 
ship: 


ADSORBENT

SOLVENT 


He states that the molecules or particles in the 
stationary and mobile phase may be one of four types, namely, 
ion, dispersion, complex, and association. Paper partition 
chromatography is included here but this will be discussed 
more fully in the next section. In his table showing the 
sixteen possibilities, all but five have been reported. 

Ionic reactions as ion exchange, inorganic chromatography, 
fractionation methods in which the solid phase is a disper¬ 
sion, and diffusion of colloids in which both the solid and 
mobile phases are dispersions, as well as certain non-ionic 
reactions of a catalytic, partition, or salting out nature 
have been described. Leyon f s (103) separation of a mouse 
virus, by using as solvent a concentration of ammonium sul¬ 
phate that is just insufficient to precipitate the virus, is 
an example of the latter. As the solvent progresses up the 
filter paper carrying the virus with it, a point is reached 
where the concentration of ammonium sulphate is sufficient 
for precipitation because a certain amount of water had been 
adsorbed and held by the cellulose.

Ionophoresis has been used to separate basic amino 
acids from neutral and acid ones (42), The process consists 
of passing an electric current through a trough that contains 
silica jelly and the analyzing solution. The latter is placed 
in a gutter cut in the jelly at a considerable distance from 
the anode. The electrodes are inserted into buffers to pre¬ 
vent electrolysis and pH changes and are placed at the ends 
of the trough. As the current flows through the jelly, the 
amino acids and peptides move at different rates and to dif¬ 
ferent poles. The current is stopped after some time and a 
strip of filter paper is put over the moist jelly and so one 
gets an imprint, when the paper is sprayed with the coloring 
reagent for amino acids (ninhydrin), of three distinct bands. 
The jelly can now be cut into sections and an analysis of 
these made by paper chromatography. It was found that the 
basic amino acids moved to the cathode and the dicarboxylic 
ones to the anode, whereas the neutral amino acids occupied 
the middle band. Similar electrolytic separation has been 
carried out on strips of filter paper (107). 

Bioautographs (190). Development here is very 
similar to that carried out in ordinary papryography (55) or 
partography (146). However, no spraying reagents are used to 
bring out the color of the compounds analyzed. Instead, the 
paper is air dried, cut in pieces and placed in petri dishes 
which contain nutrient agar and a seeded test bacterium. The 
technique for growth factors, vitamins, etc., is very similar

to microbiological determinations. If antibiotics are 
separated, balos will appear on the agar. The paper strips 
can also be placed in test tubes containing a bacterium and 
special nutrient solution. Here turbidity or acidity titra¬ 
tions are taken as a criterion of growth or inhibition. 

Radioautographs (8, 59, 60). These are special 
kinds of chromatograms in which the substances that are 
analyzed have their C, H, 0 or N labelled, i.e., in the 
radioactive form. On photographing these chromatograms on 
an X-ray sensitive film, dark areas appear wherever a com¬ 
pound contains the radioactive element. The paper chromato¬ 
gram can now be sprayed with various coloring reagents de¬ 
pending on the group of compounds studied. An authentic 
radioactive derivative of the specific substance studied is 
developed simultaneously. The presence of one spot on the 
X-ray film in this new chromatogram is indicative of identity. 

THEORY OF PAPER "PARTITION* CHROMATOGRAPHY 


Consden, Gordon and Martin (41) basing their ideas 
on earlier work by Martin and Synge (112), consider that the 
separation of a mixture of solutes depends on their different 
partition coefficients between the mobile phase and the 
water saturated cellulose. Furthermore, they stress that 
adsorption of the solutes by the cellulose plays no important 
part in this separation. It is for this reason that they 
argue that the most satisfactory solvents (for amino aeids)

are those that are partially miscible with water. Partition 
coefficient of a solute varies directly as its concentration 
in the stationary or water phase and indirectly as the con¬ 
centration in the mobile phase. Therefore, the addition of 
an hydroxyl or a carboxyl group to a solute molecule increa¬ 
ses its polarity and consequently its solubility in the 
water phase, while addition of a methyl group does the re¬ 
verse. This is supporting evidence that the cellulose plays 
no part in the separation serving only as an inert mechani¬ 
cal support. Thus amino acid members of an homologous series 
will behave in a predicted way, e.g., alanine travels farther 
than its hydroxyl derivative serine (136). Por miscible sol¬ 
vents they retain their partition theory by considering the 
process as a "salting out n effect. Bentley and Whitehead 
(13) argue that this explanation is too simple. They tend to 
uphold Hanes and Isherwood’s concept (76), who consider that 
the water is bound in the filter paper possibly by hydrogen 
bonding to the hydrophilic hydroxyl groups of the cellulose 
forming a cellulose-water complex. The result is that the 
solute molecules with their hydrophilic groups will compete 
with water and solvent molecules (both of these are considered 
to have hydrophilic groups), for incorporation in this cellu¬ 
lose-water complex. Thus, as the water content of this cel¬ 
lulose complex decreases, its affinity for water increases. 
Therefore, the separation does not depend on whether the sol¬ 
vents are miscible with water, but rather on their affinities

for water. They stress (76) that the whole mechanism of 
chromatography centers on how this water cellulose complex 
holds solute molecules in competition with the flowing sol¬ 
vent. Therefore, the number and position of hydrophilic 
groups of both solvent and solute, as well as the water con¬ 
tent will determine the R f values. It should be stressed that 
this hypothesis does not incorporate either the partition or 
Tswett's adsorption theories. 

Rutter (148) mentions that flow of one liquid over 
another may result in streaming potentials of varying magni¬ 
tudes which may have significance as a possible mechanism 
of partition separations. He verified this by using water 
and inorganic salt solutions showing that this potential had 
a marked effect on separation of a dye mixture. Meinhard 
(116) considers paper partition as an example of an associa¬ 
tion - association interaction, i.e., where both the mobile 
and stationary phases are associations. He defines an asso¬ 
ciation as "a mutual attraction between a solute particle 
and another substance, or between two solute particles of 
the same species, which does not involve the establishment 
of fixed bonds”. It is characterized as a loosely bound 
complex of indeterminate composition. He suggests that such 
factors as hydrogen bonding, dipole or induced dipole inter¬ 
actions, or resonating attractions may be responsible for 
these low bond energies as contrasted with the greater bond 
energies involved in adsorption (ion exchange).

The fact that the movement (R f values) corres¬ 
pond; very closely to the partition coefficients and can be 
predicted from the latter, is convincing evidence that the 
cellulose is inert. However, it is known that the water 
held in the cellulose is different from free water (76). 

The theories are therefore conflicting and it may be that 
more than one physical phenomenon is responsible. This would 
therefore account for the variable results sometimes encoun¬ 
tered. 

NOTE: A mathematical interpretation of paper chromatography 
based on the partition theory of Martin and Synge is given 
by Martin (111). 

PAPER CHROMATOGRAPHY OF AMINO ACIDS 


Amino acids were the first group of substances 
that the pioneers (41) separated by paper chromatography. 
Their method has been adapted for amino acid analysis of 
plant extracts. However, before a direct study of this 
kind could be undertaken, it wa’s necessary to become ac¬ 
quainted with the techniques of paper chromatography. 

Following a brief discussion of the method used 
in spotting, developing and spraying for amino acid analysis, 
a more detailed account of the solvents and coloring re¬ 
agents tried, as well as factors affecting R f values and 
some quantitative studies, will be described. All these

experiments were carried out on synthetic amino acids se¬ 
cured from Nutritional Biochemical Corporation, except cys¬ 
teine hydrochloride and asparagine, which were obtained from 
Eastman Kodak and Merck respectively* 

A pencil line is made about 9 cm. from one end of 
a strip of filter paper and just beyond this line a small 
circle of 1 cm. diameter is drawn. The amino acid mixture 
is then applied to this circle with a micropipette, the end 
of which is drawn out to a fine capillary and bent at right 
angles to facilitate spotting. As the solution is applied 
it is prevented from spreading beyond the limits of the circle 
by rapid evaporation which is accomplished hy directing a 
stream of heated air to the spot, Figure 1, Approximately 
five microlitres can be spotted each time the pipette touches 
the paper and when this dries another amount is added. 

Amounts of 5 to SO micrograms of each amino acid are suffi¬ 
cient for detection in paper chromatography. The spotted 
strip is now placed in the trough in the apparatus used for 
developing and is held there as shown in Figure 2. Both 
glass cylinders and large rectangular boxes were used. The 
solvent is added to the trough after the filter paper has 
become saturated with respect to solvent and water vapor 
(about 1 hour). When the solvent has progressed to the 
lower end of the filter paper, the latter is removed and 
the position of the solvent front is marked. The solvent 
is removed from the filter paper (the chromatogram) by sus-

pending it overnight in a large box heated by light bulbs 
to a temperature of 40 - 50° C. The dried chromatogram is 
sprayed with a Q.Z°/o butanol solution of ninhydrin (triketo- 
hydrindene hydrate) which couples with the amino acids to 
form colored products. 

For two-dimensional analysis the procedure is very 
similar. At a distance of 9 cm. from both edges of a corner 
of a 22 x 18^ inch sheet of filter paper, a circle 1 cm. in 
diameter is made. The amino acid mixture is applied in the 
same way but the amount is doubled. One edge of the filter 
paper is folded and is inserted in a long trough held in a 
large rectangular developing chamber, Figures 3 and 5. A 
glass rod holds the sheet of filter paper in the trough as 
before. After equilibrium has been attained with respect to 
solvent and water vapors, the solvent is added to the trough. 
A hole in the lid with a glass tube leading directly to the 
trough makes possible this operation without disturbing the 
saturated atmosphere, Figure 4. The paper is dried in the 
usual manner and the bent edge of the chromatogram is trimmed 
with a cutting board. The paper is turned through 90 degrees 
and the process is repeated with another solvent in a diffe¬ 
rent chamber. For such a sheet about 50 ml. of spraying re¬ 
agent is required. Often the spraying is repeated to ensure 
that all the ninhydrin positive material has reacted. 

The amino acids possess different partition co¬ 
efficients between the pure solvent and the water phases in

the paper. As a result each acid will travel, "he ad¬ 
sorbed", to some definite point between the initial spot 
and the height reached by the solvent front. The ratio 
between the distance at which an amino acid is deposited 
and the total distance moved by the solvent is called the 
Rf value for that particular acid. This constant and the 
type of color which results from interaction with ninhydrin 
are the two main criteria of identification of the amino 
acids. 


PREPARATION OF SOLVENTS 


NOTE: The phenol crystals and n-butyl alcohol were pro¬ 
ducts of Mallenckrodt. 

Phenol (126) 

Crystals of phenol were dissolved by placing the 
container in a warm-water bath. To the liquid phenol suffi¬ 
cient distilled water was added so that two layers were 
formed when the mixture was allowed to clear. The lower 
layer was used as the solvent and both the upper and lower 
layers were placed in separate containers in the bottom of 
the chamber to ensure saturated atmospheric conditions with 
respect to phenol and water vapor. Rubber gloves were used 
in all operations involving the handling of this chemical. 

Phenol is a very good solvent to use as it gives 
a wide range of R f values, Figure 6. However, the tailing

or ”ghost” effects of certain basic amino acids, as well as 
appearance of faint spots in front of some regular amino 
acid spots may often be misleading. These irregularities 
can often be prevented by inclusion of a little ammonia in 
the aqueous portion of the solvent mixture in the bottom of 
the chamber. A few crystals of KCN were also added by Part¬ 
ridge to prevent oxidation (126). 

Approximately 75 ml. of solvent are required for 
two large sheets and the time for this irrigation varies 
from 24 to 36 hours. 

N-Butanol Acetic Acid Mixture (126) 

The mixture is prepared by mixing n-butanol, glacial 
acetic acid, and water in the proportions of 4:1:5 by volume. 
The glacial acetic acid is added to the dry butanol and then 
the water is added. This is a three-component system and the 
amount of water contained in it is very important. The upper 
layer is the solvent mixture. As with the phenol solvent, 
both the upper and lower layers are placed in separate beakers 
in the bottom of the chamber to ensure saturated vapor condi¬ 
tions. The addition of acetic acid increases the polarity 
of the solvent and hence its water content is increased. The 
result is that higher values are obtained than with ordi¬ 
nary butanol. 

N-butanol acetic acid, abbreviated N.B.A., is one 
of the best uni-dimensional solvents that is known for the 
separation of amino acids, Figure 7. It was found to serve

very well as a member of a solvent pair with phenol and as 
stated previously this combination was used exclusively as 
a solvent pair for two dimensional chromatography. 

Butanol is very volatile and the evaporation of 
this solvent from the paper into the surrounding atmosphere 
inside the chamber during irrigation, results in a higher 
concentration of water than is required for saturation. 

The paper is said to be "water-logged”, and even though the 
solvent progresses, no further separation of the amino acids 
occurs. Only by maintaining an air tight chamber can this 
essential butanol saturation be achieved. An assembly by 
which solvent may be added without removing the lid, similar 
to that described in the introduction of this section, is 
therefore a necessity with this solvent. 

N-Butanol 

This solvent is prepared by adding water to dry 
butanol until two distinct layers separate after shaking. 

The top layer is used as the solvent and again both top and 
bottom layers are placed in beakers at bottom of chamber to 
ensure saturation conditions. Preliminary work using the 
ascending method for determination of R f values (145), showed 
that this solvent is not very useful for amino acid separa¬ 
tion. (See Table 1 on R f values). A more complete discus¬ 
sion of solvent-solute relationship is given on pages 3£ feo 35* 

Of the above three solvents only N.B.A. must be 


used fresh for each run, because of the formation of an

acetic acid ester on exposure to air. These three solvents 
have been used for separation of various groups of compounds, 
chief among these being sugars, antibiotics, and inorganic ions 
as illustrated in Table 2. Bryant and Overell have recently 
described a new solvent for amino acids (27). 

PREPARATION AND DISCUSSION OF SPRAYING REAGENTS USED 


Ninhydrin 

The reaction of amino acids with ninhydrin was dis¬ 
covered by Ruhemann (179). An alcoholic solution of ninhy¬ 
drin is usually prepared as this prevents spreading of the 
amino acid when the chromatogram is being sprayed and is 
also fast drying. A 0.2$ solution was found very satisfac¬ 
tory, but the concentration is immaterial since the sensiti¬ 
vity is 1 in 100,000 parts (Gortner). This reagent must be 
stored in the dark since solutions that were kept in the 
greenhouse completely lost their yellow color as we11 as 
their ability to produce the characteristic Ruhemann*s 
blue color. The production of this blue color is believed 
due to the coupling of two ninhydrin molecules through the 
alpha nitrogen of the amino acid. This reaction is specific 
for amino acids and for a very limited number of other or¬ 
ganic compounds that possess in the free state a carboxyl 
and a neighboring amino group or the NH - GH^ group. The 
color change that develops, therefore, is that of a substi-

tuted ammonium salt of diketohydrinedylidenediketohydri- 
amine. The reaction according to Gortner (p 316) is: 



, x ONH4 

Van Slyke et al (179) mention the importance of pH on color 
development and find that at low pHs, carbon dioxide is evol¬ 
ved. Various workers have stated that ammonium salts of 
organic compounds also give this ninhydrin test. The author 
was unable to produce the blue color with saturated aqueous 
solutions of ammonium oxalate, thiocyanate, and tartrate. 
Fiegl's spot test technique and spraying of a developed 
chromatogram were both negative. 

Diazo Reagent 

This reagent was prepared in two solutions as des¬ 
cribed in Hawk et_ a_l (78) and was used for the detection of 
amino acids containing indole groups (e.g. tryptophane and 
histidine). It was found that the reagent reacted very 
strongly with even traces of phenol solvent. Its use, 
however, was soon abandoned when it was found that with nin¬ 
hydrin histidine gave a characteristic greenish "tinge" when 
one dimensional chromatograms were developed in N.B.A., and 
that tryptophane was well separated from the other amino acids 
in a two dimensional chromatogram and also gave a characteris¬ 
tic brown color.

For Sulphur - Containing Amino Acids 

The iodoplatinate reagent as prepared by Wine- 
gard and Toennies (189) was used. Equal volumes of 0.066 
M KI and 0.0033 M K^PtCl^ were mixed and a deep red color 
resulted which was due to the iodoplatinate ion (Ptlg). 

For spraying this reagent was diluted with distilled water 
1:6. When phenol was used as solvent the paper was dried 
and then washed thoroughly with a one-to-one mixture of 
ether and acetone. This removes traces of the phenol sol¬ 
vent. After drying, the paper was sprayed with the above 
reagent and bleached areas against a pink background deve¬ 
loped wherever sulphur-containing amino acids occurred. The 
above workers found that serine and threonine interfered. 

This reagent was used in this laboratory only for the deter¬ 
mination of Rf values of cysteine, cystine, and methionine. 

All these spraying reagents are typical biochemical 
tests used for the detection of amino acids. Although they 
were not tried the author sees no reason why specific tests 
as the aldehyde reaction for tryptophane (Hopkins-Cole) and 
Millon's for tyrosine, as well as many others (cf, Gortner), 
could not be utilized for confirming certain doubtful ninhyd- 
rin spots. 


DETERMINATION OF R f VALUES 


Before irrigation was conducted with a three com¬ 


ponent system as N.B.A., the filter paper was completely

saturated with vapors of all the components of the solvent. 

Rapid evaporation of solvent from the paper during irriga¬ 
tion results in a decreased movement of solvent and a corres¬ 
ponding decrease in R f values. After the strips have been 
developed, dried, and sprayed with ninhydrin and the blue 
color of the amino acids has developed to a maximum, these 
areas are encircled. A point is then marked in each circle 
which corresponds to the position of maximum solute concen¬ 
tration - the center of gravity (41). This location is very 
important since the partition process is almost entirely a 
partition phenomenon. If only surface active forces were 
responsible as with separation of inorganics in aqueous sol¬ 
vents, then the front of the spot would be used in R^ deter¬ 
minations. Correct location was found to reduce considerably 
the variation in R f . 

R f values were determined using Rockland and Dunn’s 
(145) modification of Williams and Kirby’s (188) ascending 
technique, as well as the method of Consden et al (41) for 
descending technique. A comparison of R f values obtained 
with those of other workers is shown in Table 1. Ten micro- 
grams of each amino acid were used. The values obtained 
for the basic amino acids were much lower and in general lower 
values were obtained with all solvents in both ascending and 
descending irrigations. Various factors are responsible for 
variation in R-p and these will be discussed fully in the nextsectio

Suffice it to mention here that Dent (53) found that 
variations up to 15% occurred in identical runs in the same 
chamber. He stressed the invalidity of the as a criterion 
in analysis and mentioned that the relative positions of 
the amino acids remain constant in a one or two dimensional 
study (R x values). It was this latter relation that was used 
as the chief criterion for determination of amino acids in 
wheat roots, 

FACTORS AFFECTING R f VALUES 

Effect of Time 

The normal procedure of studying the effects of 
time would be to remove the irrigating strips from the cham¬ 
ber at definite time intervals. Such a procedure, however, 
would disturb the saturated vapor conditions of the chamber. 
It was found that ammonium thiocyanate produced a pink color 
after it was spotted on filter paper, and that this color 
remained visible during irrigation with N.B.A, A dynamic 
relation between R f and time was thus feasible. 

The ascending technique of Rockland and Dunn (145) 
was used, as shown in Figure 2. Two ml. of N.B.A. solvent 
were placed in an eight-inch test tube. It was stoppered 
with a cork through which a wire was inserted. On this wire 
a strip of filter paper containing the spotted ammonium thio¬ 
cyanate was suspended to reach the solvent but not to touch 
the walls of the test tube. The spot was two cm. from the

lower end which was immersed in the solvent, Figure 2. 
Measurements were taken at hourly intervals with the fourth 
reading taken at the half hour as the solvent front was al¬ 
ready near the top of the filter paper. The results are 
shown graphically in Figure 8. 

From this experiment it appeared that decreased 
with time. Figure 9 shows that the movement of solvent and 
solute also decreased considerably during the irrigation pro¬ 
cess. An average of three trials was taken for these deter¬ 
minations. This decrease suggested that gravitational forces 
may be partially responsible. Some workers (157) have found 
that the solvent movement in an ascending system was half 
that obtained for descending irrigation. Such an increased 
time often has a deleterious effect on the solute mixture 
and it was for this reason that ascending methods were aban¬ 
doned in analytical work. 

Comparison of Ascending and Descending Methods 

The comparison was made using the test tube method 
for ascending, and a large rectangular chamber for descending, 
chromatography. Ten strips for each amino acid were used in 
the test tube study whereas only five trials were tried in 
the descending method. The results, along with those of 
other investigators are shown in Table 1. With some amino 
acids as tyrosine, valine, methionine, and the leucines, the 
results are well within the 10$ range of variability. However, 
the dicarboxylic and di-basic amino acids showed considerable

variation. Comparison of R f values obtained by other workers 
showed similar differences. Thus Rockland and Dunn obtained 
a value of 0.81 for histidine whereas Consden et a_l obtained 
0.69. It should be emphasized that in this test tube method 
it was impossible to obtain an atmosphere saturated with 
vapors of stationary and mobile phases. However, the impor¬ 
tance of this factor was considerably reduced by using such 
small containers. It may be concluded that although there 
were great differences shown in R^ values obtained by the 
two methods, the relative positions occupied by the indivi¬ 
dual amino acids were the same in both tests. 

Addition of Polar Solvents 

Mathematical derivations by Consden et al (41) 
have shown that the following relation exists between R^ 
and partition coefficient (oC ).

i.e., there is an indirect relation. Thus, if the solubility 
of the amino acid in the solvent or mobile phase is increased, 
as by using a more polar solvent, the partition coefficient is

To prove this, various concentrations of acetic acid ranging 
from 5 - 25$ by volume, were added to butanol water. The 
following amino acids which represented different groups were 
tried: 

- straight chain mono-amino-mono-carboxylic 

- straight chain di-amino-mono-carboxylic 

- straight chain mono-amino-di-carboxylic 

- cyclic side chain mono-amino-mono-carboxylic 

- hydroxy cyclic side chain mono-amino-mono- 

carboxylic 

Whatman No. 4 filter paper was used in sheets. Amino acids 
were spotted nine centimeters from one edge and two centi¬ 
meters apart. Twenty five spots were spotted on each sheet 
having five replicates of each amino acid. One hour was 
allowed for equilibrating the chamber and then 50 ml. of sol¬ 
vent were added to the trough without removing the lid. All 
sheets were removed when solvent had progressed to approxi¬ 
mately five centimeters from the lower end. Results are shown 
graphically in Figure 10 and in the photograph, Figure 11. 

The graph and photograph illustrate very strikingly 
that the addition of a polar solvent to the mobile fluid can 
greatly alter the R f values. Values that were almost negli¬ 
gible in pure butanol (e.g. lysine), travelled almost half 
way up the paper when 25$ by volume of acetic acid was added. 
The increased polarity of the solvent results in an increase

in the amount of water it can hold, which in turn increases 
the solubility of the amino acid and hence its value. 
Concentration of Solute 

With filter paper chromatography there is a defi¬ 
nite limit of solute concentration above which no partition 
will occur. An attempt was made to find this limit for the 
amino acid alanine. The amino acid was spotted in various 
concentrations from five to 500 micrograms upon Whatman 
No. 4 filter paper. N.B.A. was used as the solvent. The 
results are shown graphically in Figure 12 and in the chro¬ 
matogram, Figure 13. It was found that the values in¬ 
creased with increasing concentrations of solute. The appea¬ 
rance of a ninhydrin-positive spot above alanine could not 
be explained. It was thought that some leucine impurity may 
have been present in the amino acid. Two ninhydrin-positive 
spots appeared below alanine and these too were thought to 
be impurities. 

Distance of Spot from Trough 

It was noted above (p. 30), that R^ values and 
rate of movement of solute and solvent decreased with time. 

A similar experiment was undertaken with amino acids to deter¬ 
mine the effect on R f values of placing the spots at various 
distances from the trough. 

The amino acids, leucine and threonine, were spotted 
at varying distances from the edge of a sheet of filter paper 
as shown in Figure 15, so that the advancing solvent would

reach the solute at different times. These were spotted 
two cm. apart. After equilibrating the psper to the vapors 
of the chamber for one hour, N.B.A. solvent was added. The 
R f values were then determined in the usual way. The graph 
and photograph show the results. (Figures 14 and 15 respec¬ 
tively) . 

It was found that a small decrease in R values 

f 

occurred as the solute was spotted farther away from the 
trough. This may partly explain why the table of values, 
p. 29, showed lower values than those of other investigators. 
Consden et al (41) spotted their solutes four to five cm. 
from the edge, as did most of the other workers. However, 
this effect is partially counterbalanced by the decrease in 
value with the time of irrigation. 

Type of Paper 

According to Steward and Thompson (167) Kowkabany 
and Cassidy examined 75 types of paper in relation to amino 
acid chromatography and discussed the merits of each. In 
any paper chromatographic analysis only chemically treated 
paper should be used. When ordering these sheets (22" x 18|") 
of filter paper it should be mentioned that it is for chroma¬ 
tographic analysis. Various interfering substances as salts 
and metals may cause streaking of dicarboxylic amino acids, 
and furthermore, if the salts are present in high concentra¬ 
tions they tend to take water from the solvent and "waterlog" 
the paper so amino acids do not move. Williams and Kirby

(188) avoided this by equilibrating their solvents with 
saturated NaCl solution. Localization of the dissociated 
salts caused yellow colors with ninhydrin, whereas heavy 
metals caused ghost appearances which were due to the for¬ 
mation of soluble copper-amino acid complexes (41, 167). 

Preliminary work showed that the rate of movement 
of solvent in Whatman No. 4 paper was greater than in the 
finer grade Whatman No. 1 filter paper. For this reason the 
R^ value of several amino acids was determined for these two 
types of filter paper. N.B.A. was the solvent. As in the 
previous section on polar solvent effects on R^ values, p. 32, 
a sheet of each type of filter paper containing five repli¬ 
cates of each amino acid was placed in the same trough and 
irrigated at the same time to reduce variables to a minimum. 

It was found that in nine hours the solvent tra¬ 
velled 30 centimeters in Whatman No. 4 filter paper and only 
23 centimeters in Whatman No. 1; see Figure 16. Figure 17 
shows graphically the effects of the two papers on R f values. 

From this experiment it may be c oncluded that 
although the movement of solvent was greatly increased in 
Whatman No. 4 filter paper, the R f value shows only a slight 
increase. Some amino acids as alanine and aspartic acid 
actually showed a decrease in R f value in the thicker paper. 
Compound Structure 

According to Consden e_t al (41), the positions of 
the spots produced by various amino acids separated by paper

chromatography are determined by their partition coefficients 
between two phases, one of which is water saturated with 
organic solvent and the other organic solvent saturated with 
water. Addition of an OH or COOH group to the molecule in¬ 
creases its polarity and solubility in the water phase, while 
addition of a CH^ group to the molecule decreases its pola¬ 
rity and thus its solubility in water. The former group 
causes a decrease in values, the latter causes an increase. 

In order to demonstrate this, a mixture of all the 
known free amino acids was spotted near one corner of a sheet 
of filter paper. The sheet was then subjected to two-dimen¬ 
sional chromatography using N.B.A* as first solvent and phenol 
water (80$ phenol) as the second solvent. The results ob¬ 
tained were similar to those of Poison (136), who used phenol 
with ammonia as first solvent and collidine as second solvent. 
The resulting chromatogram is shown in Figures 18, 19, and 19a 

In this chromatogram the dibasic acids, although 
not strict homologues, occupy the lower part of the sheet 
and fall on a straight line. Alanine occupies a position 
higher than its hydroxy derivative serine, as does also 
phenylalanine over tyrosine, and proline over hydroxypro- 
line. Glycine and other members of the straight chain 
homologous series produce spots that fall on a smooth curve. 
The dicarboxylic amino acids occupy a position well to the 
left of the chromatogram.

occupied by the individual amino acids greatly aids in 
suggesting the character and possible identification of 
unknown spots. It was in this way that the occurrence of 
gamma-amino-butyric acid in plants (89) and yeasts (139) 
was ascertained. 


QUANTITATIVE PAPER CKRGMkTOGrRAPHT OF 
AMINO ACIDS 


Optical Density of Ninhydrin Color 

Most of the quantitative techniques depend on a 
color produced with ninhydrin. Thus Poison compared the 
intensity of the spot with that produced by a known amount 
of amino acid (133), having abandoned the earlier techni¬ 
que of extracting the color with acetone and measuring the 
intensity colorimetrically (132). Others (6, 120) used 
first a dilute ninhydrin spray to locate the spots and then 
completed their reactions in test tubes. The procedure 
adopted by Awapara (6) consisted of locating the amino acids 
vdth 0.05$ ninhydrin in butanol, cutting out the colored 
areas and placing them in test tubes to which two ml. of 1$ 
ninhydrin solution and one ml. of 10$ pyridine solution were 
added. The test tubes were then placed in a boiling water 
bath for 20 minutes after which they were transferred to a 
25 ml. volumetric flask and made up to volume. They were 
read in a Beckman spectrophotometer at 570 mju. and the optical

density was compared with, a known standard. Preliminary 
work in this laboratory was done on color extractions using 
acetone and comparing light intensity with a standard in a 
Dubosq colorimeter. It was found that at least 50 micro- 
grams of amino acid were required before any difference 
could be recorded. The Beckman spectrophotometer was not 
tried for this experiment. 

Woiwood^ Copper Phosphate Method 

More detailed studies were done using Woiwood’s 
copper phosphate method. His method (193,194) is similar 
to that of Pope and Stevens who allowed a suspension of 
Cu 3 (P0 4 ) 2 to react with amino and "peptide amino" nitrogen. 

A soluble complex is formed at pH 9.3 between the copper 
and the alpha amino (or imino) group of the free amino acids 
or the free amino groups of peptides and proteins. This 
complex is filtered from the CUr^PO^)^ suspension and the 
amount of soluble copper is determined iodometri cally. The 
copper so determined is related to amino or peptide N. 
Woiwood’s modification consists of a colorimetric determina¬ 
tion. The filtered complex is allowed to react with diethyl- 
dithiocarbamate and the yellow color that develops is mea¬ 
sured colorimetrically. The copper so determined was then 
related to amino or peptide N, by means of a standard curve 
or a factor. He also found it necessary to replace the 
borate with Na^HPC^ as the former buffer made the copper 
reagent unstable. Standard curves must be prepared for each

amino acid as the ratio of weight of alpha amino N to 
weight of copper reacting, i.e., the F value or factor was 
not constant from acid to acid. Recently Spies and Chambers 
(161) found that excess of any amino acid added to a solution 
of this copper complex converts this copper largely to the 
complex of the added amino acid which then can serve as the 
standard. This therefore eliminates the preparation of 
standard curves for all the amino acids. 

However, the modification which Woiwood applied to 
quantitative paper chromatography of amino acids was adopted. 
Volumes of standard copper solution containing one to 100 
micrograms of copper were used and the curve relating concen¬ 
tration of copper to the n L ,f value is shown in Figure 20. 

Numerically L « 2-log G, where G is the galvano¬ 
meter reading. L is called the photometric density of the 
solution and is analogous to optical density as measured by 
the spectrophotometer. Tables are available in which the 
value of L corresponding to any value of G can be read at a 
glance. The standard curve showed an almost linear relation 
to 60 micrograms of copper. Further tests showed the sensi¬ 
tivity to be about one microgram, Figure 21. These values 

10 

represent concentration of copper per/ml. With amino acids 
such sensitivity was not attained as it was found that amounts 
less than 40 micrograms of amino acids did not produce signi¬ 
ficant variation in colorimetric readings. Furthermore, the 
constant K value obtained with the copper curve and which is

characteristic of a linear relationship, was not obtained 
with either arginine, alanine or aspartic acid* The stan¬ 
dard curve for these amino acids is shown in Figure 22. In 
the determinations of the standard amino acid curves, the 
amino acids were spotted on one inch squares of Whatman No. 1 
filter paper. No attempt was made to obtain curves for de¬ 
veloped chromatograms as it was thought that the destruction 
of the amino acids by the solvents would further decrease 
this sensitivity. 

NOTE: In preparation of standard curves the following modi¬ 
fication of aliquots from Woiwood’s procedure was necessary 
as 15 ml. centrifuging tubes were used. For the standard 
copper curve the volume of the filtrate obtained after 
treatment with the Cur^PO^)^ suspension was reduced from two 
to one ml. and four instead of eight ml. of distilled water 
were added. For the amino acid standards two ml. of fil¬ 
trate from the Cu^lPC^Jg suspension were pipetted into two 
ml. of distilled water instead of the eight ml. which 
Woiwood used. 

Other Quantitative Methods 

Although Poison e_t a_l (152) were the first to report 
a quantitative procedure for amino acids employing the extrac¬ 
tion of the ninhydrin color, they soon abandoned this for 
the "spot dilution" technique. This consisted of running a 
series of known concentrations of amino acids with the unknown

and then matching the intensity of the spots. Fischer et 
al (61) utilized the area of the spot. They showed that a 
linear relationship existed between the area of the spot of 
the test substance and the logarithm of the concentration 
at which it was applied. A theoretical derivation of this 
is given by Brimley (23). Rockland and Dunn (144) used a 
densitometric method, comparing density of an area larger 
than the biggest spot with that of the spot, while others 
used visual comparisons after adding known amounts of amino 
acids (168). Keston et al (94) used radioactive derivatives 
the so called ultra microscopic dilution technique. Martin 
and Mittelman (115) used a polarographic method in place of 
the iodometric method of Pope and Stevens, when using the 
CUglPO^)^ suspension procedure. The author sees no reason 
why Fitzpatrick 1 s spectrophotometric quantitative studies 
of solutions of amino acids (62) could not be adapted for 
paper chromatography studies. It should be emphasized, 
however, that, none of these methods, with probably the 
exception of Poison’s spot dilution technique, has been used 
successfully for two dimensional chromatography, although 
some workers have reported promising results with a combina¬ 
tion of some of the above procedures (167).

CONCLUSION AND SUMMARY 


Tiie history, scope, and methods of partition 
chromatography have been discussed and a glossary has also 
been included. The procedure used in the paper chromato¬ 
graphy of amino acids has been outlined. The preparation 
of solvents, spotting and irrigation of chromatograms, use 
of spraying reagents as well as quantitative determinations 
of amino acids were described in considerable detail. A 
study of factors affecting the value proved its invalidity 
as a criterion for identity of a compound. The relative 
positions of amino acid spots in a chromatogram as well as 
their characteristic colors with ninhydrin, were taken as 
the chief criteria of identification of amino acids. Deve¬ 
lopment of a chromatogram containing all the known free 
amino acids with N.B.A. as the first solvent and phenol- 
water (80/o) as the second solvent showed almost a complete 
separation. It was concluded that this solvent pair could 
be used with reasonable success for determination of amino 
acids in an unknown biological extract free of peptides or 
proteins. Finally the table of fields of application of paper 
chromatography with the solvents employed was included to show 
the wide scope of paper chromatography in recent years.

PART II 

APPLICATION CF PAPER CHROMATOGRAPHY TO THE STUDY OF 
HEALTHY AND DISEASED WHEAT ROOTS 


INTRODUCTION 


Studies of amino acids of plant tissues using 
paper chromatography were not undertaken until 1947 when 
Dent et al (52) found 21 known amino acids and three un¬ 
known spots in a 70$ alcoholic extract of potato tubers. 
They also observed that on hydrolysis no extra spots 
occurred (167). By the use of cold 70$ alcohol they ob¬ 
tained a protein-free filtrate and found that approximately 
two thirds of the total nitrogen of the tubers was soluble 
in alcohol. 


HISTORICAL REVIEW 


The importance of various roots to the wheat 
plant has been studied by Sallans and coworkers (150). 
Their experiments involved the amputation of different 
roots as lateral, auxiliary, or seminal, and the study of 
such amputations on growth of the plant. However, it was

the application of the chromatographic technique that has 
helped in the understanding of nitrogen metabolism in the 
roots• The symbiotic relation of roots and nodules in le¬ 
guminous plants was studied by Hunt (90) who found free 
tryptophane as well as certain basic amino acids in mature 
nodules but not in roots* Allsopp (1) found more amino acids 
in the root apices of certain ferns than in the general root 
portions. 

However, Andreae (2) was one of the first workers 
to report a study of the amino acids of healthy and diseased 
plant tissue. In his chromatograms he found that healthy 
potato tubers had a predominance of tyrosine and tryptophane 
while the diseased ones showed no tryptophane and very little 
tyrosine. He suggested that the leaf roll virus which was 
responsible for this disease may have interfered with the 
synthesis of these amino acids. It was also suggested that 
the tyrosinase enzyme may be more active in the infected 
tissue. No references have been noted on studies of the 
amino acids in healthy and diseased wheat roots. 

SXPERBffiNTAL PROCEDURE] 


Obtaining Healthy and Diseased Wheat Roots 

Several fungus pathogens of wheat roots are commonly 
found in Edmonton black loam, but for the purposes of this 
study one of these, Helminthosporium sativum (P.K. & B.), was

used. Inoculum of this pathogen was prepared in the 
following manner: 

An isolate of H. sativum which was known to be 
parasitic to wheat roots was increased in quantity by sub¬ 
culturing in test tubes on Czapek’s synthetic agar medium. 
These tubes were incubated for a period of 14 days at room 
temperature. Ten ml. of sterile distilled water were added 
to one of these test tube cultures and after the contents 
were mixed with a transferring needle, the resulting suspen¬ 
sion was added aseptically to five flasks. Each flask con¬ 
tained 140 grams of a moist sterilized mixture of three 
parts soil and one of sand, plus Zfo corn meal by weight. 

This was incubated for a period of 10 days at 65° F, during 
which time the fungus penetrated the soil and usually deve¬ 
loped a fine grey mat of fungus mycelium and spores. This 
mixture is called soil inoculum of H. sativum . The above 
process of its preparation is shown diagrammatically in 
Figure 23. 

One of these flasks was then transferred to a pot 
of virgin black soil. The inoculum was mixed well with this 
soil and then soaked with water. After a period of two days, 
which allows the fungus to establish itself in the soil, ten 
surface-sterilized wheat seeds were seeded in each pot. Sur¬ 
face sterilization of the seed was accomplished by soaking 
the seed overnight in water, draining, adding 0.01$ HgCl g for 
10 minutes, and washing well with sterile water. Thatcher 
wheat was used*

After a two to three week growth period the plants 
were removed and the first three inches of the root below 
the crowns were removed and washed. Roots that did not show 
any lesions or discolorations were discarded. Healthy roots 
were obtained by following the same procedure except that 
the soil inoculum of the fungus is replaced by a flask of 
the sterilized soil mixture. 


PREPARATION OF ..HEAT ROOT EXTRACTS FOR CHROMATOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS 


Initial extraction work was carried out using 
large amounts of fresh root tissue and small volumes of 
extracting fluids. Four ml. of the extracting solvent were 
added to a five gram sample of fresh moist root tissue. This 
was ground to a fine paste in a mortar by the addition of a 
few grains of sand. This was then filtered through a Buchner 
and about 4.5 ml. of filtrate were obtained. Volumes of 50 
microlitres were spotted on paper strips. Figure 24 shows 
the effects of hot and cold water and cold 80% ethanol, and 
from, these results it appeared that hot water was the best for 
extraction. However, in these strip chromatograms it was ob¬ 
served that the water extraction method caused considerable 
spreading of the spots. Similar results were obtained w ? hen 
moist roots were ground in a mortar without any solvent and the 
extracted ^uice was chromatographed, Figure 25. This suggested 
that inorganic ions or other compounds might have interfered

■with the partition (126).. The extract was therefore put 
through ion exchange colunrs using Partridge’s method (126). 
Percolation of the extracted juice through a Zeo-karb column, 
which was used for removal of cations and bases, did not result 
in much loss of amino acids. However, after this was perco¬ 
lated through Deacidite column, which removes anions, it was 
found that the amino acids were almost completely lost as 
only a few faint spots were visible in the region of lower 
values. This is shown in Figure 26. 

It was thought that after running through the first 
column the amino acid existed in the cationic form so that per¬ 
colation through the Deacidite column would cause an exchange 
of the sodium ion in this resin with the positively charged 
amino acid. Apart from this fault, future work utilizing the 
water extraction method proved unreliable as older preparations 
usually resulted in loss of amino acids. 

The alcoholic extraction method of Dent et aJL 
(52) was tried and was found to be most satisfactory. It was 
slightly modified.

' ixtraction Method I - Large Volume Technique 

To five grams of fresh roots 100 ml* of 80% 
ethanol were added and one ml* of concentrated NH 4 OH to 
neutralize any acids that might cause hydrolysis of pep¬ 
tides or proteins* The resulting pH, using a Beckman pH 
meter, was 6 * 7 ^ for the healthy and b.b 5 for the diseased 
extracts. The flask containing this mixture was placed in 
a water bath, the temperature of which was just sufficient 
to make the alcohol boil. After 30 minutes of boiling the 
alcohol was decanted and filtered. Another 100 ml. of 
alcohol were added and this extraction process was repeated 
four times. The filtrates were pooled and reduced to a 
volume less than. 100 ml. by reduced pressure and slight 
warming. The resulting solution was placed in a 100 ml. 
volumetric flask and made up to volume with 80% ethanol. 

The resulting pH was 6.23 for the extract of healthy tissue 
and 6.30 for the extract of diseased tissue. Chromatograms 
were prepared with 1000 microlitres of solution per spot 
and the results are shown in Figures 27 and 28 . 

Extraction Method II - Small Volume Technique s 

A - Fresh Tissue 

Fifty mgm. of fresh roots were placed in a small 
13 ml. vial and two ml. of 80 % ethanol were added. This was 
immediately placed in the refrigerator to freeze the tissue* 
lust before these samples were used for chromatographing, the 
roots were macerated in the vial with a stirring rod. The sus- 









67 


pension was allowed to settle and the clear fluid was care¬ 
fully pipetted and spotted directly on filter paper. Chroma¬ 
tograms were spotted containing 1200 microlitres of solution 
and the results are shown in Figures 29 and 30 (frozen samples) 
and Figures 31 and 32 (not frozen samples). 

B - Dry Tissue 

Dry roots were obtained by placing fresh roots over¬ 
night in an oven heated at 90° C. They were partially ground 
with a mortar and pestle and to 10 mgm. of this powder two ml. 
of 80% ethanol was added. At least 24 hours were allowed for 
extraction. The vial was shaken periodically to hasten this 
process. After the suspension had settledthe top clear fluid 
was carefully removed with a micropipette and spotted directly 
on paper. Chromatograms containing 1000 microlitres of solu¬ 
tion are shown in Figures 33, 34, and 41. 

The value of each technique will be discussed in 
Sectioh 2 on chromatographic analysis. 

HYDROLYSIS 


The acid, alkaline or enzyme methods are generally 
employed in protein hydrolysis. Stepka and Takahasibi ('166) 
discuss the merits of each using the tobacco mosaic virus 
protein. Only acid hydrolysis was employed in wheat root 
studies using macro and micro quantities.

Macro: .Figures 35 and J>b 

Five gram samples of fresh root tissue were placed 
in 200 ml* flasks and to each 50 ml. of bN KG1 were added* 

These flasks were loosely stoppered with glass wool and the 
contents were hydrolyzed in the autoclave overnight at 12 
pounds pressure. (Glass wool was used because ordinary absorbent 
cotton charred considerables) The plugs were removed and the 
contents evaporated to dryness in a 50° C. oven. Then 100 ml* 
of d0% ethanol were added, and the contents stirred and allowed 
24 hours for complete extraction® This was repeated with one 
gram samples and the volumes of acid and ethanol were reduced 
by half. 

Mi c ro: Figure s 57 - 40 

Amounts of 0.01 and 0*05 gms® of dry tissue were 
placed in small vials and two and five ml. of bN ECL were added 
respectively. Hydrolysis was carried out as outlined above. 
Following evaporation, the contents were dissolved in two and 
five ml. of 80% ethanol respectively. A similar hydrolysis 
was carried out on 0.05 gms. of fresh tissue, using two ml. 
bN HG1 and dissolving in two ml. of ethanol*

of an inexpensive yet efficient spotting apparatus for drying 
the solute is therefore included. 

Figure 1 shows the general external appearance. An 
aperture four inches in diameter is made in one side of a rec¬ 
tangular gallon tin. Through this aperture a small hot plate 
is placed within the can and a hole is made in the bottom of 
the latter to allow the electric cord and the temperature 
regulator of the hot plate to protrude. A screen is then 
fitted over the side aperture and held in place by bending 
the corners into slits made in the tin. A rubber stopper is 
inserted in the vent of the tin. Through this is inserted a 
glass tube that is bent and drawn out to a fine capillary and 
an adjustment is made so that when a current of air is forced 
through it, and directed on the hot plate, the resulting warm 
air moves upward on the screen. With this apparatus 1500 micro- 
litres of solution can be spotted in one hour. 

One and Tv/o Dimensional Studies 

The large volume extraction technique, Figures 27 
and 28 is not recommended as only a few spots show up even 
after 1000 microlitres of solution are spotted. Since five 
grams of fresh tissue were used and the final volume of the 
extract was 100 ml., the results would probably be the same 
if one ml. of extracting solution were used for 0.05 grams of 
fresh tissue. An experiment to test this was carried out and 
the resulting-chromatograms are shown in Figures 31 and 32.

acid derivative. 

To determine the bound amino acids, it was necessary 
to remove the free amino acids first. Two ml. of 80$ ethanol 
were added to 0.01 grams of dried root tissue. After 24 hours 
the alcohol was removed and the residue was subjected to hydro¬ 
lysis as described above. Chromatograms containing 600 micro¬ 
litres of solution were spotted and are shown in Figures 39 
and 40 (bound amino acid chromatograms). They should be com¬ 
pared with Figures 37 and 38 (free and bound amino acid chro¬ 
matograms) which show both the free and bound amino acids and 
with Figures 33 and 34 (free amino acid chromatograms) which 
show only the free amino acids. These six figures were used 
for preparing Tables 3 and 4. In all cases 0.01 grams of dry 
tissue was used and the hydrolysis treatment of spotting, etc., 
of Figures 37 - 40 were similar. The chief difference shown 
is the decrease in basic amino acids as well as the absence of 
spot W from the "bound-amino acid" chromatograms. There was 
also a decrease in spots B and C and A was almost absent. These 
three spots could not be identified. Spot 0 was thought to be 
aspartic acid as it was found that this amino acid sometimes 
showed two spots (53). Threonine and alanine also showed de¬ 
creases. The leucines, valine, and proline were unchanged. 

This is to be expected since these amino acids were found in 
low concentration in the free state. Proline, as well as tyro¬ 
sine and tryptophane, could not be detected in the free state. 
Asparagine and alpha amino butyric acid were destroyed by acid

At least five more spots occurred than in the large volume 
extraction process. If tissue is frozen immediately after 
removal from the wheat plant, Figures 29 and 30, an increase 
in asparagine and the basic amino acids occurs. Similar in¬ 
creases were obtained when the roots were quickly dried and 
ground to a powder and the alcoholic extract was spotted, as 
is shown in Figures 33 and 34. Figure 41 is a chromatogram 
of oat root tissue treated by this drying process. Repeating 
chromatograms several times according to all the above men¬ 
tioned procedures, showed that the latter method of drying 
and grinding the tissue to a powder previous to extraction 
with alcohol gave the most consistent results. Furthermore, 
this procedure does not destroy asparagine or glutamine and 
at the same time it increases the concentration of the basic 
amino acids. 

For a study of the bound and the free amino acids, 
it was found that there was no advantage in using either the 
large or the small volume extraction procedures. See Figures 
35, 36, 37 and 38. The greater concentration observed in 
Figures 37 and 38 occurred because a much larger volume was 
spotted. There is, however, one other difference between the 
chromatograms and that is the absence of spot W from the large 
volume extraction technique. The larger concentration of 
solute may be responsible for this. The position occupied by 
this substance does not correspond to any of the known free 
amino acids. Its position suggests it may be a basic amino

hydrolysis. 

For quantitative determination of amino acids, the 
spot dilution technique of Poison ejb a_l (132) was used. The 
intensity of the ninhydrin spot was compared with several 
standards. For the concentrations less than 60 milligrams per 
gram of dry tissue the accuracy is - 5 milligrams, whereas for 
values higher than this, the accuracy is much reduced as no 
standards were prepared for such high concentrations.

Note: In this series of chromatograms of root extracts,the N.B.A.

From Table 4, it is seen that the amount of free 
and bound amino acids expressed as milligrams per gram of dry 
tissue is much higher in the diseased samples, viz., 111.0, as 
compared with 88.5 in the healthy. K^eldahl determinations of 
dried root samples also showed higher values of total nitrogen 
in the diseased. Values: 

Healthy - 60.0 milligrams N/gram dry tissue 

Diseased - 79.6 milligrams N/gram dry tissue. 

The results suggest that nitrogen metabolism is much higher in 
the diseased root tissue. Steinberg (163) , in discussing 
amino acid action on tobacco seedlings, suggests that locali¬ 
zation of certain amino acids may be responsible for the 
"frenching" symptoms. The results of the above experiment 
suggest that the higher concentration in the diseased root 
tissue of certain free amino acids as alanine, serine, aspa¬ 
ragine and valine as well as the basic amino acids is associ¬ 
ated with the symptoms occurring in root rot infection.

CONCLUSION AND SUMMARY 


The techniques of paper chromatography discussed 
in Part I have been applied successfully to the analysis of 
amino acids in healthy and diseased wheat roots. Various 
extraction procedures have been discussed and it was found 
that analysis of dried samples using 80$ ethanol as extracting 
fluid gave the most consistent results. With this technique 
the free as well as bound amino acids of healthy and diseased 
root tissues have been detected and quantitatively determined. 
In all cases there was a much higher concentration of certain 
amino acids in the diseased root samples and it was suggested 
that these amino acids were associated with the symptoms of 
root rot.

PART III 

BIOCHEMICAL STUDIES OF THE ROOT ROT PATHOGEN 
HEIMINTHCSPORIUM SATIVUM 

THE FUNGUS H. SATIVUM 


According to Christensen (37), Pammel, King and 
Bakke, in 1910, were the first to attribute the irregular 
brown lesions of barley leaves to Helminthosporium sativum . 

In Canada the first reports of this disease appeared earlier. 
Simmonds (158) mentioned that Gussow reported H. sativum as 
occurring on barley in 1912. Christenson (37) gave a very 
vivid description of the symptoms of the disease produced by 
this fungus and mentioned that roots, leaves, stems, spikes, 
spikelets and seeds can become infected. 

H. sativum is a member of the imperfect fungi, pos¬ 
sessing septate branching mycelium and dark brown or black 
spores. These spores are septate with four to eight cells, 
and from each cell on germination, an infection hypha grows 
out that infects a plant directly or forms mycelium that is 
responsible for producing disease symptoms. Henry (152) found 
that spores were not absolutely necessary for the development 
of the disease and Oswald (124) mentioned that in the California 
area spores are very seldom found in the soil, yet the infection 
might be quite high. The perfect or sexual stage of this fungus

HISTORICAL REVIEW OF SOIL RELATIONS 


Simmonds (158) has adequately reviewed the litera¬ 
ture on root diseases published by Western Canadian workers 
prior to 1939. Several major approaches to the problem of 
common root rot are evident from this review. Sanford and 
Broadfoot (151) and Henry (81) initiated interest in the study 
of biological interrelationships. A more recent review of 
this ”biotic antagonism” has been published by Sanford (152). 
Greaney and Maehacek (72) and Mead (158) investigated infection 
as influenced by soil microflora and seed injury. 

The possible role of mineral deficiencies in the root 
disease complex was investigated by Greaney (73), Maehacek (108) 
and Broadfoot and Tyner (23). Tyner (177) found that infection 
on wheat roots grown in composts of oat straw with soil was 
much less than when the seedlings were grown in composts of 
barley or wheat straw. Several possible reasons for this 
difference were considered, viz., difference in microflora 
associated with the varied decomposition of each compost; che¬ 
mical composition of the straw; presence of toxic by-products 
of decomposition; and the C/N ratio of the composts. The 
following experiment was undertaken by the present worker in 
an effort to isolate actual effects on pathogenicity of che¬ 
micals likely to be found in such composts. The variety of

amino acids found in hydrolyzed extracts of wheat and oat 
roots as compared with the few free amino acids (see chroma¬ 
tograms pp. 74 - 81) suggested that this group of organic 
compounds may play an important part in determining the 
variation of the virulence of this pathogen in greenhouse and 
field experiments as well as in general farming practice. 


EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE 


Effect of Amino Acids on Degree of Pathogenicity 

Van Lanen ejt al (178) obtained attenuated strains of 
the tumor forming bacteria, Agrobacterium tumefaciens , by 
repeated transfers on a mannitol nitrate mineral salt medium 
containing in addition 0.3$ glycine with the pH adjusted to 6.8 
The resulting bacterial cultures failed to induce galls on punc 
tured areas of tomato plants. Furthermore, they were able to 
regain virulence of this organism by repeated subculturing on 
a yeast medium. They found that all aliphatic amino acids as 
well as lysine were attenuators. The other diamino acids and 
the dicarboxylic acids were inactive. Braun et al, (19), 
working with Brucella abortus, were able to get shift over 
from smooth to rough type of bacterial cells using alanine. 

With increased alanine concentration, new types of cells deve¬ 
loped that were antigen!cally different from the rough or 
smooth type. In reviewing the literature no reference could 
be found on the effects of amino acids on the virulence of

fungal plant pathogens, although Christensen (38) mentioned 
that virulence of H. sativum was not attenuated by replanting 
on artificial media six times. In this laboratory an experi¬ 
ment was carried out to determine the effects on virulence of 
this fungus of 17 amino acids. The remaining amino acid, viz., 
proline, hydroxyproline and alpha-amino butyric acid* : as 
well as the amines, asparagine and glutamine were not avail¬ 
able at the time. 

The earlier methods used for inoculating wheat seeds 
with H. sativum have been reviewed by Sallans (149), who des¬ 
cribed some eight different methods. A modification of Henry’s 
method (81), which has been used in this laboratory for many 
years, was adapted. This was briefly described in Part II, 
see pp. 60 - 61. The Czapek’s agar medium that was used had 
the following composition: 

Weight in grams 


Sucrose 15 

NaNOg 2

MgS0 4 .7K 2 C 0.5 

KC1 0.5 

Te(NH 4 ) 2 (S0 4 ) 2 .6H 2 0 0.01 


The components were mixed in a liter of distilled 
water and then 15 grams of agar were added. This was placed 
in an autoclave and brought to 15 pounds pressure to melt the 
agar. To each 100 ml. of melted agar medium, 0.1 grams of an 
amino acid was added and the contents were thoroughly mixed.

This made the final concentration of amino acid one part in 
1000. Except for tyrosine and the leucines, the amino acids 
were readily soluble in this hot agar solution. Approximately 
10 ml. aliquots of this resulting medium were poured into 
test tubes, plugged, autoclaved for 20 minutes at 15 lbs. 
pressure, and finally slanted. Upon solidification of the 
medium (it was found that only cysteine hydrochloride pre¬ 
vented gelling), the tubes were inoculated with a culture of 
H. sativum known to be virulent. After incubation for two 
weeks (149) portions of the culture and the medium from the 
test tube were transferred to flasks, containing sterile soil; 
one test tube being used for six flasks thus allowing three 
replicates for the two types of experiments conducted. The 
flasks of soil were prepared as follows: 

To a 3:1 mixture by volume of black loam soil and 
sand, 2# corn meal by weight was added. To this sufficient 
water was added to just prevent the soil mixture from becoming 
sticky. Approximately 140 grams of this mixture were added to 
200 ml. flasks and sterilized at 15 lbs. pressure for four 
hours. After 24 hours cooling, the above fungus suspension 
was added. Before the test tube slant containing the culture 
of the fungus was divided among the six soil flasks, a portion 
of this culture was transferred aseptically to another test 
tube slant containing the same altered Czapek's medium. 

Following an incubation period of 14 days, Figure 
42, the contents from three of these six flasks were trans-

ferred to separate six inch pots and mixed with sufficient 
virgin, black loam soil to fill the pot. In all, 17 amino 
acids were used and with Czapek f s medium serving as the check, 
a total of 54 pots was used. After a period of two days during 
which time the fungus established itself in the new environment, 
10 surface sterilized wheat seeds of the Red Bob variety were 
planted at uniform depth in each pot. 

The soil inoculum of the three remaining flasks was 
thoroughly mixed with a sterilized iron rod and 10 surface- 
sterilized wheat seeds were planted directly in these flasks, 
the flasks were immediately replugged with the same cotton 
bungs, and were shaken so as to cover the wheat seeds with 
soil. These were allowed to grow in a temperature controlled 
room at 20° C whereas the pots described above were kept in 
the greenhouse. After a growth period of two weeks the seed¬ 
lings were removed and data on germination, infection rating, 
stem height, and root lengths were taken. The degree of in¬ 
fection was rated from zero to 10 as shown in Figure 45, with 
a zero rating having no brown lesions on the crown region of 
the seedling and a 10 rating where the seedling failed to pro¬ 
duce a stem although it may have a fair primary root system. 

The ratings were made on the coronal region since infection of 
the primary root system seemed to vary considerably with the 
moisture content of the soil. 

The results of this experiment are shown in Table 5. 
They represent an average of six repeated experiments using

three replicates. Since infection ratings were from zero to 10, 
the percentage infection was easily computed by manipulation of 
the decimal point. Percentage germination was also computed in 
this way since 10 seeds were used. The values for stem height 
and number and length of roots were not tabulated. 

From the above experiment with pots it may be concluded 
that addition of the amino acids alanine, arginine, histidine, 
iso-leucine, leucine, methionine, and serine to the synthetic 
Czapek's medium caused a marked decrease in pathogenicity of H. 
sativum to wheat seedlings of the Red Bobs variety. A single 
trial with Thatcher variety showed the same trend. The remaining 
nine amino acids that were used, as well as Czapek f s medium 
alone, had little or no effect in altering the virulence. 

In the flask experiment where the root rot fungus and 
the wheat seedling were in sterilized soil, thus eliminating the 
effects of other microflora, the same but less pronounced vari¬ 
ation in pathogenicity occurred. The lowest percentage of infec¬ 
tion was with methionine (56 v /o) while the highest was recorded 
with tyrosine (98 °/o) whereas with the pot trials the variation 
was from 19 to 76 °/o* In some cases a decrease in germination of 
the wheat occurred, viz., on leucine, tyrosine, and phenylala¬ 
nine cultures. It was rather difficult to assess the effects on 
stem height because of etiolation. In general, it can be stated 
that those tests which showed a fairly high degree of infection 
also showed retarded stem growth, Figures 45 and 46. 

The purpose of this flask experiment was to eliminate

any effects that other soil microorganisms may have on the 
virulence of H. sativum to wheat seedlings. Although various 
workers (81, 151, £02) have shown that the microbiological 
flora play an important role in determining the degree of 
pathogenicity, the above experiment has shown that chemical 
agents may produce the same effects. A possible explanation 
for this variation in fungus virulence will appear in the dis¬ 
cus sion. 


EFFECT OF LIGHT ON PATHOGENICITY 


Flasks of soil inoculum were prepared and incubated 
for 14 days as outlined in the previous section. One test tube 
culture was again divided among six flasks. Ten surface steri¬ 
lized wheat seeds were added directly to the flasks as described 
above. The flasks were then divided into two groups; three were 
kept in a dark room at £0° C, while the other three flasks were 
kept in the greenhouse. After a growth period of two weeks, 
data on germination, infection rating, root lengths, and stem 
heights of the seedlings were taken. The results are shown in 
Table 6. 

From this experiment, it appeared that neither light 
nor darkness have much effect on degree of pathogenicity of H. 
sativum , although slightly higher infection ratings were obtained 
in some of the flasks kept in the light. The greater stem 
height of seedlings in flasks kept in the dark is due to etio-

lation effects and this may be partially responsible for the 
lowered infection ratings in the flasks kept in the dark. 

EFFECT OF AMINO ACIDS ON 3P0RULATI0N 


Henry (81) found that H. sativum sporulated on dif¬ 
ferent soil types if they were sterilized but not in natural 
soil. Furthermore, addition of small amounts of unsterilized 
soil to the sterilized soil was sufficient to inhibit spol¬ 
iation. He therefore suggested that sporulation is inhibited 
by saprophytic microorganisms of the soil. Simmonds <st al. (159) 
verified Henry’s findings and they further mention that there 
are numerous conidia present on stubble and other decaying 
material above the ground level, and that these conidia play 
an important role in determination of primary infections. 

An experiment was undertaken in conjunction with the 
pot studies described above, with the objective of determining 
the abundance of conidia in the soil flasks of inoculum just 
prior to transfer to the pots. Three portions from different 
parts of the surface mycelial mass (Figure 42) of the soil 
flask of inoculum, were removed with a dissecting needle and 
transferred to separate areas on a microscope slide. A drop 
of phenol-glycerine methyl green solution was added to them. 

The slides were then examined under the microscope for presence 
of Helminthosporium conidia. The results are shown in Table 7 
and,as with the pot studies, are based on six separate experiments.

The results of this experiment indicate that there 
was no correlation between pathogenicity and the presence of 
spores. However, the observation that spores were regularily 
not produced by certain treatments is of interest and will re¬ 
quire further study.

play a very important role in the nutrition of soil microorganisms 
especially in the rhizosphere region. The importance of this 
was further strengthened when Najjar (121) showed that amino 
acids enter bacterial cells by straight diffusion, the process 
being unaltered by cyanide or fluoride inhibitors and depending 
only on the external concentration. Virtanen and Linkola (180) 
found similar results with pea and clover cultures. However, 
their results with wheat showed that aspartic and glutamic acids 
were not used as a nitrogen source. In an experiment in which 
wheat plants were grown in sterile nutrient solution containing 
nitrate and (NH^JgSO^ as well as aspartic acid, they actually 
found a decrease in dry weight and suggested that it was caused 
by an acceleration in the respiration rate. Calvin and coworkers 
(8, 12) have studied amino acids as carbon sources for plants 
by employing radioactive derivatives and analyzing the tissues 
by paper chromatography. The work of Wallace and Lochhead, as 
well as Virtanen and Linkola, suggests that the soil microorga¬ 
nisms and the roots of plants compete for organic nutrients such 
as the amino acids. The following two experiments were under¬ 
taken to determine the nutritive value of amino acids as carbon 
and nitrogen sources for both the wheat roots and the root rot 
organism.

were placed in the agar of the test tube slant by means of 
sterile forceps. The test tubes were placed vertically in 
a rack and after two weeks of growth the wheat seedlings were 
examined. The results are shown in Figure 47. No pronounced 
differences were observed and it would appear that the supply 
of available nitrogen and carbon in the endosperm of the wheat 
seed was sufficient for this two-week growth period. 

Amino Acid as Carbon and Nitrogen Source for the Fungus 

Although the sources of carbon and nitrogen for 
microorganisms in the soil are numerous, the literature contains 
only meagre information concerning the utilization of amino 
acids as carbon and nitrogen sources for growth of these micro¬ 
organisms. Schultz et al (154-6) have done extensive work on 
the amino acids as carbon, sulphur, and nitrogen sources for 
different yeast strains. They found methionine, glutathione, 
and cysteine sulphur were not as readily used as inorganic 
sulphur in the form of sulphate. As carbon sources they found 
that if the yeast could not metabolize the carbon of glutamic 
acid or proline, then it was unable to utilize the carbon of 
any other amino acids. As a nitrogen source they conclude that 
amino acids fall in three groups — unavailable, availability 
variable with strains of yeasts, and available. An excellent 
review of the nutritional requirements of fungi for carbon and 
nitrogen compounds is given by Steinberg (164). He pointed out 
that various workers have found that Aspergillus niger is capable 


of using a mixture of amino acids previously formed from sugar

(L-proline, L-glutsmic acid, and L-ornithine), almost as 
efficiently as hexose. The results were almost identical 
with those of Schultz et al described above, who worked with 
yeasts. Steinberg concludes that quantitative studies of amino 
acid utilization must be interpreted on the basis of type of 
nitrogen assimilation employed by the fungus. Thus if the fungus 
is unable to utilize inorganic nitrogen, then it may be assumed 
that it uses the amino acids intact. If, on the other hand, it 
can use inorganic nitrogen, then deaminations probably precede 
utilization. 

An experiment was undertaken to see if the amino acids 
differed in their availability as carbon and nitrogen sources 
for growth of H. sativum . Since nitrate and ammonium ions were 
present in this Czapek’s medium, the fungus was therefore able 
to compete for these three different sources of nitrogen. In 
one series sucrose was included to supply the carbon sources 
and in the other it was omitted. The amino acids, however, were 
added to both series. The difference in growth after a period 
of 10 days is shown in Figure 48. A very fine light colored 
mycelial mat occurred in the test tubes without sugar in con¬ 
trast to the dark heavy mass where sugar was present. As sole 
carbon sources it appears that proline and valine furnish the 
best growth. In no case was the growth equal to that which 
occurred -when sucrose and amino acid were present. Threonine 
and tryptophane yielded very little growth as was also the case 
with the check. These results are very similar to those recorded

f° r Aspergillus niger (164). It may be concluded that all the 
amino acids may serve as carbon and nitrogen sources for limited 
vegetative growth but they do not favour sporulation at the con¬ 
centration employed. Further work is necessary to eliminate the 
effects of NO^ and NH 4 ions which were present in this medium, 
before conclusions regarding amino acids as sole source of nit¬ 
rogen may be formulated. 

Toxicity of Amino Acids to Plants 

The degradation in the soil of nitrogenous organic 
residues to simple inorganic compounds includes passing through 
the amino acid stage. It is for this reason that the effects of 
amino acids on various tissues in vivo and in vitro have been 
studied* Riker and coworkers ( 66 , 141) found that sunflower 
and tobacco tissues differed in their soil nutrient requirements 
as well as in the optimum concentration at which an amino acid 
may be applied. This difference was attributed to the amount of 
reserve material present in the seeds ( 68 ). In general, Riker 
and coworkers found that they got good to excellent growth at 
low and high concentrations of amino acids but inhibition at 
0*001 M level which is approximately 1000 p.p.m* Isotopic studies 
support the view that there are three stages in a plant as re¬ 
gards utilization of sources of nitrogen ( 68 ). In the early 
stages it utilizes the N of the seed; later, when this is ex¬ 
hausted it must use an external source and shows preference for 
ammonia over amino acids, and finally when the ammonia is de-

pleted, the plant is forced to utilize amino acids. It would 
appear, therefore, that the toxicity of amino acids to plants 
would occur only in the final state. Audus and Q,uastel (5) 
found that among the amino acids only alpha-alanine and L-glutamic 
acid were non-inhibitors to cress roots when applied at 1000 
p.p.m. Steinberg (163) found that proline and hydroxyproline 
could cause the "frenching" symptoms of tobacco plants in 
aseptic cultures and suggested that they were caused by primary 
localized areas of toxic concentrations of free amino acids in 
the tissues of the plant. 

From this literature review it would appear that the 
high concentration of amino acids known to occur in soil as a 
result of degradation of nitrogenous organic compounds or as 
excretory products from other microorganisms (164), might be an 
important factor in determining the resulting symptoms of root 
rot. The experiment which was undertaken to determine the avail¬ 
ability of amino acids as carbon and nitrogen sources for wheat 
seedlings also served to determine the toxic effects of amino 
acids to wheat seedlings. The concentration of amino acid used 
was 1000 p.p.m. The results were shown in Figure 47. Although 
no brown lesions (coronal) appeared, the roots showed typical 
lesions in most tests, especially with arginine, histidine, 
tryptophane, lysine and the check. With nor-leucine consider¬ 
able discoloring was observed and the lateral root system 
appeared as knobby extrusions. In the check, although brown 
lesions occurred, there was an abundance of lateral roots. It is

•suggested that the amino acids may be partially responsible 
for inhibiting lateral root development. The addition of a 
"corresponding" culture of sativum to a similar series of 
test tubes containing wheat seedlings, resulted in heavy root 
lesions even when the Czapek’s medium did not contain sucrose. 

From these preliminary experiments it may be tenta¬ 
tively concluded that certain amino acids may cause abnormal 
root development. Furthermore, a sugar source is not necessary 
for lu sativum to exert its pathogenicity to wheat seedlings. 


DISCUSSION 


The addition of certain amino acids to Czapekt s agar 
medium was found to cause a decrease in virulence of the patho¬ 
gen H. sativum . However, this decrease was less marked in the 
flask than in the pot experiments. The results of various 
workers who considered "biotic" antagonism as of prime import¬ 
ance have already been reviewed. The composition of free amino 
acids in root tissue was found to be a small fraction of the con¬ 
centration after hydrolysis. Such tissue following decomposition 
in the soil should therefore provide an ample supply of free 
amino acids. Since free amino acids added to a synthetic medium 
could alter the pathogenicity of H. sativum , it is possible that 
a similar effect could occur in the soil. Furthermore the experi 
ment on toxicity of amino acids to wheat seedlings grown in test

showed that certain amino acids are able to produce symptoms on 
roots that resemble those of root rot infection. Although the 
individual amino acids do not occur in the soil in the free 
state in as high concentrations as were used in the above 
experiments, their combined concentration in the soil is pro¬ 
bably sufficient to play an important role in the expression 
of root rot symptoms by acting directly on the wheat seedlings 
or indirectly on the fungus.

CONCLUSION AND SUMMARY 


The results of the above experiments suggest that 
certain amino acids can alter the pathogenicity of H. sativum 
to wheat seedlings so that in some cases infection may be 
completely absent. Fungus spores were not found to be essen¬ 
tial for development of the disease. Furthermore, from the 
test tube experiment with wheat seedlings, it was found that a 
sugar source was not necessary for this fungus to cause infec¬ 
tion although the mycelial growth was rather limited. As a car¬ 
bon source the amino acids could not be used as effectively as 
sucrose. Since Czapek’s medium contains nitrogen, the avail¬ 
ability of amino acid as nitrogen source could not be ascer¬ 
tained. Certain amino acids were found to limit lateral root 
growth and cause necrotic areas on roots that were similar to 
root rot lesions. It is possible that the fungus in some way 
upsets the protein metabolism of the wheat root and that this 
causes a localization of a high concentration of different 
amino acids which then produce the characteristic symptoms. 

In turn there is probably a higher excretion of amino acids by 
the wheat seedling which may help to retain or alter the patho¬ 
genicity of the root rot fungus.

SUMARY 


1. Tile techniques employed in paper chromatography have 
been reviewed and successfully applied to the separation 
of free and bound amino acids in wheat roots. 

2. For two dimensional chromatography the solvent pair 
N.B.A. and phenol-water (80$ phenol by volume) were 
found satisfactory. 

3. A total of 11 known amino acids and three unknown nin- 
hydrin positive spots were found to occur in the free 
state in alcoholic extracts of wheat roots. 

4. A total of 13 known amino acids and four unknown nin- 
hydrin positive spots were found in alcoholic extracts 
of acid hydrolyzed wheat root samples. 

5. The chromatograms showed that higher concentrations of 
amino acids, both in the free and combined form, were 
found in diseased wheat roots than in healthy wheat 
roots of the Thatcher variety. 

6. Total nitrogen, determined by the Kjeldahl method was 
found to be higher in the diseased wheat roots than in 
the healthy roots. 

7. Addition of the amino acids, alanine, arginine, histidine, 
leucine, iso-leucine, methionine and serine, singly to 
Czapek’s medium on which the root rot fungus, H. sativum , 
was cultured, was found to decrease the pathogenicity of 
this fungus to wheat seedlings.
