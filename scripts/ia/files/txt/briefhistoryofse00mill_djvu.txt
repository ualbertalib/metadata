AN ABSTRACT OF A THESIS 


This thesis proposes to discuss the problem of the private or 
parochial school in the democratic community which is providing an educa¬ 
tion of superior quality through the medium of its public schools. The 
setting for the discussion involving the church, the state, and public 
education is laid in a brief outline of the history of Seventh-day Advent¬ 
ists, their beliefs, and their educational philosophy. Coupled with this 
survey a historical outline of the Seventh-day Adventist educaxional pro¬ 
gram in Canada is provided. This information is compiled from published 
works such as books, periodicals, and encyclopedias as well as through 
personal interviews. Since more^attention is given to the Alberta scene, 
the files and records of Canadian Union College are used extensively. As 
a result of the study, the writer concludes that the public school cannot 
meet the demands of Seventh-day Adventists, In addition, the witer 
attempts to show that the system of public education cannot be altered to 
meet the needs of Seventh-day Adventists, The doctrine of the Separation 
of Church and State is considered and used as a criterion in arriving at 
these conclusions. Finally, an attempt is made to foresee some of the 
problems which the Seventh-day Adventist educational program in Canada 
may face in the future.

CHAPTER I 


PURPOSE^ PROBLEM, AM) METHOD OF STUDY 
Purpose of the Study 

In this dissertation will be traced the development of Seventh- 
day Adventist schools in Canada, which began i/dth the founding of a 
small elementai^r school at South Stukely, Quebec, in I8BI1. An account 
of the struggles and financial reverses which have attended the evolu¬ 
tion of these schools across the Dominion will give special emphasis to 
the Alberta scene and more specifically to the development of Canadian 
Union College, located at College Heights, Alberta, two miles north of 
the tovm of Lacombe, To give a better background for the understanding 
of the historical facts presented, a separate introductory chapter /dll 
be devoted to the origin and development of the Seventh-day Adventist 
denomination and the educational philosophy which is responsible for the 
educational program sponsored by the church. Because of the educational 
philosophy of Seventh-day A-dventists, it Tdll be necessary to give som.e 
consideration to the role of the school in the religious education of 
youth. Inevitably the question of whether the public school system can 
adequately serve Seventh-day Adventists will be encountered. An attempt 
T/dll be made to define the denominational attitude of the church toward 
the public school system. The T’vriter proposes in thj.s dissertation to so 
present the history of the Seventh-day Adventist educational work in

Canada as to show its relationship to the denominational teacVngs and 
its dependence upon the educational philosophy of the church. 

The Problem 

The history of the Seventh-day Adventist educational program in 
Canada and the basic philosophy which underlies the constant struggle 
to establish and finance these church scViools will give rise to a prob¬ 
lem wliich requires careful consideration. It will be necessary to con¬ 
sider the claims that a democratic community may justl^r make of its 
schools. Can these claims be fulfilled by the public school as it is 
presently constituted or as it can readily be modified,, or can a more 
adequate realization of these claims upon educational agencies be 
achieved through the establishment of parochial or church-controlled 
schools of which Seventh-day Adventist church schools are an example? 

The establishment of parochial schools is easily justified in isolated 
localities where state-supported schools are not presently established. 
The expense of maintaining a system ox parochial schools whose contri¬ 
butions to the democratic community merely parallel the services pro¬ 
vided by the public schools would call for some degree of justification. 

It i-jill be shown that^ resulting from the educational philosophy 
of Seventh-day Adventists and their efforts to maintain parocliial schools 
in Canada^ some of the questions that can be raised for consideration are 

1 . Can the system of public education as we know it today meet 
the demands of Seventh-day Adventists?

2. Is it possible for the public school system to be so altered 
that it can more nearly meet the requirements of Seventh-day Adventists? 

3. VJliat attitude do Seventh-day Adventists take toward the sug¬ 
gested introduction of religious training in public schools? 

I 4 . iihat is the position of Seventh-day Adventists regarding 
state aid for private schools? 

5 . TJhat are some of the principal problems that must be solved 
if the Seventh-day Adventist educational program is to be expanded? 

6, Based on the e.xperience of the past^ what would the future 
of Seventh-day Adventist education in Canada appear to be? 

Later, these questions mil be considered separately and an at¬ 
tempt made to answer them on the basis of valid inforraation. 

Method Of Study 

The chronological method is used to trace the development of 
Seventh-day Adventist schools in Canada. The philosophy of the denomina¬ 
tion regarding the role of education in spiritual training is demonstrated 
through the historical account. The influence of financial reverses, 
fluctuating enrollments, and teacher-turnover are considered. Tables and 
figures are used freely for the purposes of illustration. These facts 
and figures are secured from government-compiled statistics, encyclope¬ 
dias, and other reputable sources. In some instances it is found neces¬ 
sary to refer to the Seventh-day Adventist Yearbook, 1956 edition. The 
sources in all instances are clearly indicated. It is the purpose of

the vjriter, although a Seventh-day Adventist himself, to present an 
impartial picture when denominational references are made. 

Summary 

It is the writer’s intention in this first chapter to bring into 
sharp focus the purpose of this dissertation, the problems which arise 
out of the study, and the methods which will be employed in the treatment 
of the topic. Arising out-of a consideration of the topic ’’The History 
of the Seventh-day Adventist Iild.ucational VJoric in Canada, with Particular 
Reference to Alberta,” the writer suggests a few of the questions that 
would appear to require an answer. The development of the topic in the 
chapters that follow tends to follow the approach indicated by these 
questions w'nich are suggested. 





CPLiPTER II 


A GLB'IPSy. AT SSVSNTH-DAY ADTOITISTS 
A Brief Flistory 

Seventh-day Adventists are comparatively recent arrivals on the 
contemporary scene. To better acquaint the reader with this denomina¬ 
tion and what it is attempting to do in the field of education, some 
attention will be given to the early history of Seventh-day Adventists 
and their present status. An attempt will be made to present the educa¬ 
tional philosophy which underlies the history of the Seventh-day Adventist 
educational program in Canada. Mherever possible, tables and figures ^-jill 
be used to aid the reader in becoming more conversant with the topics 
under discussion. 

The Seventh-day Adventist denomination as we Imow it today grew 
oiit of a movement promoted by William Miller, a New England Baptist, who 
was born at Pittsfield, Massachusetts in the year 1782, and grew to man¬ 
hood in Low Harapton, New York. Though his formal education was meagre, 
being limited to that offered at a frontier school, he had a thirst for 
knowledge and read all the books he could borrox-f from the educated men in 
the neighborhood.^ 

He served in the War of 1B12 and returned home with the rank of

captain. In l8l6, following a short period during which he professed 
Deistic viex^s, he renounced his former stand and became an ardent church 
member. He then turned to a careful study of the Scriptures^ giving 
special attention to the proohetic portions of Daaiel and the Revelation 

p 

vdiich described the end of the world. 

Then, as now, there were two main schools of Adventists, which 
are explained by Elmer T. Clark: 

There are two main schools of adventists. Postmillenarians 
expect the Kingdom of God to be realized by a gradual process 
and the return of Glirist to occur after the riiilleniuifi mentioned 
in Rev. xx:l-6. Premillenarians^, however, see little hope in 
social progress and expect the Second Advent to occur before 
the milleniura, mth the Kingdom being inaugu.rated by a cosmic 
cataclysm. Most Adventists are in the second category, and 
premillenarianisrii and adventism are mostly regarded as synonymous 
terms. ^ 

A study of the contemporary history for that period reveals two 
main factors which brought pre~millenial excitement to a white heat 
during the latter part of the first half of the nineteenth century. 

The first was the influence stemming from tilliam lyiiller, 
a former Baptist preacher in upper Mew York state, whose name 
has been given to the whole movement; the second was the wide¬ 
spread economic distress which prevailed throughout the nation^, 
and especially in the rural areas follotjing the panic of 1837.^

^The premillenarian doctrine is widely held outside the ranks of 
those who stem from the Millerite movement, especially by the Mormons, 
Church of the Four-Square Gospel, Jehovah’s IrJitnesses, Plymouth Brethren 
Christian Catholic Church, Christian Apostolic Church, and many so-calie 
fundamentalist groups. Ibid .

E. N. Dick gives additional reasons why the people of the New 
England area were inclined to place more than average credence in 
Hiller's message of .impending world disaster: 

Signs in the heavens of its co:aing were reported: a great 
meteoric shower which occurred .in ld33 was regarded as an omen^ 
strange rings were seen about the sun^ crosses were discerned 
in the skyj and a great comet appeared at high noon and for days 
hung ominously over the earth like a huge sword threatening a 
guilty worid.^ 

VJhen Miller began to preach, his efforts were confined to his 
home territory. Gradually, however, his zealous preaching won hiia 
wider recognition and his farae brought him speaicing appointraents in 
churches at some distance from his home. Sweet describes the spread 
of hliller's .influence; 

to 1839 Miller’s influence had been more or less local, 
but .in that year the Rev. Joshua Himes, a born publicist, and 
the minister of the Chardo.n Street Baptist Chujrch, Boston, met 
I'iiller at a Christian convention at Exeter, New Hampshire, 
accepted his teaching and Hillerism soon becane .if not a nation¬ 
wide movement, at least received natio.a-T-d.de publicity and has 
found a place .in the social history of the time. Through Hines’ 
influence, Advent papers were soon appearing in severai of the 
princ.ipal cities of the north, though the movement was by no 
means limited to one seciion of the country. 7 

Sweet fujrther reports that during the year 18I1.2 at least fourteen 
itinerant lecturers were touring the country lecturing on Hillenialism. 
None worked harder than Williara Hiller, and dunlng the year Idli-l M,iller

estiiTiated he had delivered six hundred twenty-seven lectureseach 
lasting ninety minutes, and had made five thousand converts.^ 

I'iiller had never set any exact time for the ’’coming of the Lord,” 
but he definitely believed it would be about the year l3[|.3. As a resrdt, 
vjith the beginning of that year the Millenial preachers put forth re¬ 
doubled efforts and the number of converts increased rapidly.^ 

In explaining how Killer arrived at the conclusion that the end 
of the world would occur about the year l81i3^ Carroll states: 

He (i'iiller) based this prediction on the prophecies of the Book 
of Daniel holding that the periods spoken of as ”2300 days,” ’’the 
seven times of gentile supremacy,” and the ”1333 days” were prophetic 
periods and, apolied chronologically, led to the end of the world in 

18U3P° 

ilien the year l81t3 passed and nothing happened, there was great 
disappointment among the Ki.llerites, as Miller’s followers were now 
Imown. Killer himself co.nfessed his own disappointment and after a 
careful checking of liis own calculations, insisted that the Lord would 
come some time before October 22, l8lj.[|..^ 

Although Sweet records the fact that ’’Killer, himself, was re¬ 
luctant to fix either the day or the hour of the Lord's coming,the 
Advent preachers and papers seized upon October 22, l8l!J„i, as the day of 
days. Extra issues of the Adventist papers were published and as the

date approached there were man;y reports in the secular press of mob scenes 
and mass meetings occurring in the large cities of the northeastern 
section of the United States. 

Dick describes the zeal of the Millerites as October 22 approached: 

The intensity of their anticipation rose to flood tide this time. 
Grops were left unharvested^ stores closed, and positions were re¬ 
signed. Hen prepared, as though on their deathbeds, to meet their 

God.^h 


The profound effect on the people of the doctrines of liillenial- 
ism is further emphasized by Sweet: 

A group of about one hundred Millerites left Philadelphia the 
day before the expected end, fo,llow.ing the example of Lot fleeing 
Sodom before its destruction. The Millerites gathered in their 
churches and their homes on October 22^^ to await the coming of 
the Lord.l^ 

The interest of the entire country rose to a high pitch. Miller’s 
followers were accused of many excesses. In dealing with these charges, 
Dick states: 

Miller's followers were accused of donning ascension robes and 
of assembling in graveyards and on high places to await their 
Saviour. These charges, according to the best evidence, are not 
based on facts, although tradition to this day readily affirms 
them. Certain forms of fanaticism, such as speaking mth strange 
tongues and possessing discerning spirits, did appear. These ex¬ 
travagances, although confined to a sroall minority, were sharply 
rebuiced by the leaders.

Sweet's account of the charges of excesses and fanaticism tends 
to confirm Dick's appraisal of the conduct of the Mllerites: 

The widespread accusations that Mllerism had driven people 
insane and caused many to coroiTiit suicide has been refuted by iiichol 
in a careful study of asylum records for the year involved. 

Nichol has also produced indisputable evidence that the nimnerous 
stories of the Millerites providing themselves with ascension robes 
and gathering on hilltops to await the coming had no basis in fact.l^ 

The disappointment of the ilillerites when October 22 passed with¬ 
out any sign of the end of the world taking place was intense. Many of 
Miller's followers were so discouraged that they disassociated them¬ 
selves from the Millenialists and rejoined their former congregations. 

The Millerites' troubles were, however, only beginning. Many of the 
followers of I'liller had sold their property and turned the proceeds over 
to the leaders to be used in warning others of the impending end of all 
tilings. Sweet records this phase of the Mllerite movement thus: 

The secular press carried stories of dishonesty among the leaders, 
filling their pockets with the money which deluded people had con¬ 
tributed by the selling of their property. Himes particularly was 
denounced in the press on this ground. Most of the accusations of 
this kind, however, were never substantiated.-^^ 

iOLthough the prophecy of the Millerites regarding the end of the 
world had failed, the movement Imom as Millenialism did not die out 
completely. Mller had spent many years in studying the prophecies of

the Bible^ and he, along i-dth a small group of followers, continued to 
look for a speedy fulfillment of the Second Advent. He still stoutly 
maintained that some small flaw in liis original calculations had caused 
liim to choose the virong time for the Lord's return. In April, iQhSy a 
conference of Adventists was held at Albany with i'illiam Hiller present 
and serving as chairman, during the conference he reaffirmed his faith 
in the follow,ing words: 

How interesting to live in expectation of the day which patri¬ 
archs, prophets, and apostles desired to see, but died i-dthout the 
sight i Persecution and death lose their sting in prospect of the 
coming conqueror, who hath all power, and who hath engaged to put 
to death all enemies under His feet. We need not murmur, for in 
this our day, God will bring to pass this act, this (to the worldly 
man) strange act, for which all the weary saints, for six thousand 
years have lived and prayed. 

/llliam Hiller's health failed and for the remaining four years 
of his life he took little active part in the movement, though his in¬ 
terest never slackened. He passed away quietly in his home, December 
20, iBIiP, in his sixty-eighth year, his faith unshaken in the movement 
in which he had played so important a part. His movement had appealed 
to people from all the revivalistic denominations, though there seems to 
have been a larger proportion of Baptists than any other. 

As early as the fall of iSliIi., the Adventists who remained i-lth the

movement had begun to divide into txTO main groups. One group believed 
that some mistake had been made in the calculations, that the close of 
the 2300-da7 period did not come in l8I^|, The members of this group be¬ 
gan to set new dates. As a result of internal differences, this group 
broke up into several factions, holding different views on minor matters, 
but adhering to the main tenet that the Second Advent was imminent. 

A second group, much smaller than the first, held to the original 
belief that the 2300 days or years actually closed in l8Li.Ii. This group 
maintained that the error arose, not in the calculation itself, but in 
the interpretation of the event w'nich was to occur on that date. It is 
from this smaller second group that the Seventh-day Adventist church 

pp 

developed.'^ 

In order to understand what events accompanied the later develop¬ 
ment of the Seventh-day Adventist denomination, it will be necessary to 
notice the part played in this development hj Tllen G. XTnite, born Gllen 
Gould Harmon, in Gorham, Maine, November 26, 1827. Dick describes her 
early years as follows: 


Ellen Gould Harraon Nhite, lead.er of the Seventh-day Adventist 
Church, was born at Gorharm, Maine. When she was still a child, 
her family moved to Portland. She was not more than nine years 
old when a girl playmate, in a fit of anger, struck her with a 
stone, knocking her unconscious, a state in which she remained for 
three weeks. Her face was disfigured, and her "nervous system 
prostrated." Her health was so poor that she had to give up school.

and with the exception of a short period of tutoring at home^ she 
received no further formal education, 23 

In when she was only fourteen years old, Ellen Hamon 

attended a series of meetings conducted by William Miller in Portland, 
Maine, She was greatly impressed by Miller's fiery delivery and was 
deeply moved when she heard that the end of the world was only three 
years avjay. Later Ellen joined the Methodist church and became a devout 
Christian, In the summer of l8U2 she attended a second series of lectures 
conducted by Mller and she was convinced that his interpretation was 
correct. Because her views and those of her parents were contrary to the 
teachings of the Methodist Church, Ellen and her parents were expelled 
from the local church. The disappointment of iSIiU was a bitter blow to 
the young girl but she gradually rallied from the despondency into which 
she had first settled. 

It was at this point that Ellen Harmon entered upon the work that 
was to have such a profound influence on the church which eventually 
developed from the Mllerite movement. Dick describes the experience 
which came to Ellen Harmon in December, I8L1I15 

In December, however, while she was kneeling in prayer with four 
other women, a vision came to her in which she seemed to be trans¬ 
ported to heaven and siiora the experience awaiting the faithful.23

:Uck further describes Ellen Harmon’s experiences: 

Subsequently^ she had other visions^ accompanied by strange 
physical phenomena. According to the reports of physicians and 
others^ her eyes remained open during these visions^ she ceased 
to breathe, and she performed miraculous feats. Messages for 
individuals, churches, and families were imparted to her, occa¬ 
sionally of wliat woLild take Place in the future, but more often 
of reproof or encouragement. 

At no time did the Adventist leaders or Ellen Harmon (later Mrs. 
James TJhite) make any claims that her x^rritings were intended to take the 
place of the Bible. Possibly the best treatment of her place in the 
development of the Seventh-day Adventist denomination and the most 
scholarly answer to her critics is contained in Francis D. Nichol’s book, 
Ellen G. Tfnite and Her Critics . 

The emergence of the Seventh-d.ay Adventist denomination was gradual 
and resulted from an exchange of beliefs betxfeen members of the Seventh- 
day Baptists and other fundamentalist groups as x-Jell as followers of 
• illiam Miller. As early as l8ii3, folloxjing the great disappointment of 
October 22, iSlii;, a small group of Adventists in Washington, New Hamp- 
sbJ.rs, began to observe the seventh day of the week as the Sabbath. The 
original Millerite movement began to break up because of differences of 
opinion and five distinct groups emerged; Advent Christians, Seventh-day 
Adventists, Church of God, Life and Advent Union, and Church of God in

Christ. The Seventh-day group was the smallest of all. William Hiller 
never identified himself with the small group who advocated the observ¬ 
ance of the seventh day as the Sabbath. A number of the other pioneer 
workers in the Millerite movement did_, however, accept this new teaching 
and a few churches were organized. 

In l8Ij.6, 'ILlen Harmon married the Rev. James VAiite and together 
they espoused this doctrine of the sacredness of the seventh day of the 
week. Although penniless and in poor health, they both took a very ac¬ 
tive :oart in promoting their convictions. James White devoted most of 
Ills time to the establishment of the publishing work. In l8[i7, they 
assisted in the founding of the first Seventh-day Adventist college at 
Battle Creek, Hichigan. Together, Mr. and Hrs. tlhite started the health 
work at Battle Creek by helping to establish a sanitarium in l866. 

Following her husband*s death in l88l, Mrs. White travelled in 
the Eastern U. S. and Canada si ting churches and attending conferences 

and campmeetings. She laJoored also in Europe and Australia. Under her 
direction, the College of Medical Evangelists was established at Loma 
Linda, California, in the year 1909. hick sums up her contribution to 
the development of the Seventh-day Adventist denomination in these 
words: 

Her place in the denonination was unique. She never claimed to 
be a leader, but simply a voice, a messenger bearing communications 
from God to the people. Her life was marked by deep personal piety

and spiritual influence, and her messages were an important factor 
in unifying the churches. She was a constant contributor to the 
denominational papers and was the author of about twenty volirnies.^^ 

In i860, the title "Seventh-day Adventists" was chosen as the 

denominational name. The first president of the General Conference of 

Seventh-day Adventists, John .Ti^ington, was elected in I 863 .

Table I reveals the fact that there have been only fifteen presi¬ 
dents of the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists, including the 
present incimbent, R. R. Figuhr. At first the tern of tenure was limited 
to two years, but, as Table I shows, there has been a tendency in recent 
years for the term of office to become somewhat longer. 

As far as the history of Seventh-day Adventists in Canada is con¬ 
cerned, the Encyclopedia of Canada reveals this information: 

Their first church in Canada was formed about i860 at South 
Stukely, Quebec 5 at present, scattered over the Dominion, they have 
150 churches and 8,203 communicants. The 1931 census reports the 
Seventh-day Adventist population in Canada as 16,026, mostly in 
Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Ghtario.^^ 

Table II shows that the actual membership at the close of 195U 
was less than the nominal membership in 1931.

Figure I gives a grapliical distribution of Seventh-day Adventist 
membership among the seven conferences in the Canadian liiion. Here it is 
seen that fully tvfo-thirds of the church membership is found in Western 
Canada^ with British Columbia having over one-quarter of the total Seventh- 
day Adventist membership in Canada. 

Table II shows.that the Seventh-day Adventist membership in Canada 
at the end of the year 195h stood at 12^672. The 1931 Canadian census 
reported the Seventh-day Adventist population of Canada as 16^026^ being 
confined mostly to alberta^ Saskatchewan, and Ontario. 31 In IsUl this 
population figure had risen to ld,) 4 l 4:9 individuals, or 0.16/b of the 
population of Canada. 3^ 

This Seventh-day Adventist church membership might be compared to 
the number of comraunicants in the united States, which at the end of 1932 
stood at 233^809.^^ At the end of 1931]-^ this total for the United States 
had increased to 270,079 During 1953p the Seventh-day Adventist 
church passed the million mark in world membership. 33

of the Seventh-day Adventist Yearbook, shows the increase in world mem¬ 
bership for the denomination between the years 1863 and 195U* Ib will 
be noted that during the ninety-year period the membership has risen 
from 3,500 to 972,071* The latter figure is more than 277 times the 
membership in 1863. Another observation that maybe made in connection 
with this membersliip increase is the trend tov/ard numerical superiority 
for world areas outside of North America. In 1863, all of the 3,500 
members of the Seventh-day Adventist church resided in North America, 

By the end of 195U, only 29,1!. per cent of the world membershj.p of 

972,071 was within the North American Division of the Seventh-day 

37 

Adventist organization. This information, as well as other data, 
is given in Table IV, page 20, 

Table IV gives ir’forniation regarding the number of churches, 
membership. Sabbath schools, missionary volunteer societies, and Dorcas 
societies within the thirteen wor3-d divisions into which the world work 
of Seventh-day Adventists is divided. Carroll ma.kes the following ob¬ 
servations regarding the organization and activities of Seventh-day 
Adventists s 

The body is thoroughly organized with local, state, and union 
conferences, and a general conference. The latter meets quadren¬ 
nially, the union conference, vrhich embraces five or six states, 
meets biennially, and the local conference annually. The local 
chiorches have the congregational form of government, but the con¬ 
ferences are presbyterial in character* There are departments of 
missions, publication, medicine, education, Sabbath School, and.

young people’s work which are conducted systematically. The for¬ 
eign mission work is quite extensive, embracing the countries of 
Europe, also including Iceland, China, Japan, Korea, India and 
Burma, five centres in Africa, Australia, Canada, Mexico, and 

South America.3o 

Tables V, VI, VII, VIII are included to give an overall picture 
of the various activities of the Seventh-day Adventists. Table V, 
page 21, gives information regarding the various types of institutions 
maintained by Adventists. It shows that in 1920 the total nuraber of 
institutions maintained by the church was I 83 , a total which stood at 
6ifL in 195h» Likemse, Table VI, page 22, shows that beginning mth 
one college in 1872, staffed by three teachers, and with an enrollment 
of ninety, the educational program of Adventists at the end of 195h 
included l 4.,678 elementary schools, 6 , 51 - 1.9 elementary teachers, 211,617 
elementary pupils, 302 academies and colleges, 3^651 teachers in acad¬ 
emies and colleges, and an enrollment of 38,230. The total enrollment 
at the end of 19Sh was 233,950, which was more than 25 par cent of the 
world membership for the denomination. In referring to the interest of 
Seventh-day Adventists in the maintaining of private schools, Pfeffer 
compares the school enrollment for Adventists and Catholics in the 
United States with their respective church members’nips. Using data 
available at the end of 1914-7, Pfeffer shows that for Seventh-day Ad¬ 
ventists the school enrollment was l6.9 per cent of church membership 
and for Catholics the corresponding figure was 10.3 per cent.3^

individuals, and having total assets of ;;?2U,800*60, the medical work by 
the end of 195U included 235 units, 550 physicians, 3,139 nurses, a 
total of 10,575 employees, and assets totalling §39,373,162.08 (1953)* 

The publishing work, dealt with in Table VIII, has grown from one 
periodical in 1850 to 53 publishing houses, l,68l employees, 362 peri¬ 
odicals, employing 200 languages, and a total annual sales of 
§17,271,860.76. 

The 8:jcpense of maintaining this world-mde organization is met 
largely by contributions from church members through a system of sys¬ 
tematic benevolence. The 1955 Statistical Abstract of the United 
States reports that in 1952, out of forty-s,ix groups reporting from 
religious bodies having a membership of 50,000 and over. Seventh-day 
Adventists in the United States contributed on the average §163*26. 

The only other religious group reporting and having an average contri¬ 
bution above §100 was the Nazarene Church with §117*97*^^ Figures 
available for Canada indicate that the average contribution for 1955 
among Seventh-day Adventists in Canada was §113*69, or an estimated 
l5*5 psr cent of income. 5l In 1955, the per capita contribution by

their denominational activity in the field of foreign missions, 
education, medical work, et cetera, attention vdll be confined to a 
consideration of their principal beliefs# 

1# A Seventh-day Adventist believes in the imminent return of 
the Lord andlives under a sense of destiny, believing it to be 
his duty to warn manlcind that the end of the world is at hand# 

2# They observe Saturday as the Sabbath, regarding it as a 
perpetual memorial of God's creative power# Seventh-day Advent¬ 
ists believe in abstaining from all unnecessary teaporal activity 
between sunset Friday evening and sunset Saturday evening# 

3# Seventh-day Adventists accept the Bible literally, believ¬ 
ing that the original authors were inspired by God. They recognize 
that there have been many translations of th© Bible dom through 
the centuries. They accept the fact that words change in meaning 
“ifith the passage of time, thus making occasional revisions of 
translations desirable# 

Li-# Being fundamentalists in the extreme. Seventh-day Adventists 
believe that God created the world by divine fiat, in six literal 
days# The record of creation is accepted by them, not as a fable, 
but as fact. They consider that if the omnipotent Creator could 
make billions of suns (which the astronomers cla,im to have seen 
circling through the immensities of space), it was no great problem 
for Hira to call tliis one planet into existence. The evidence used 
by geologists and paleontologists to support their theory that the 
earth is millions of years old is regarded by Seventh-day Adven¬ 
tists as substantiating the Bible story of the Flood# That global 
catastrophe, they maintain, affords a completely satisfactory 
explanation of all the fossils, buried coal beds, and oil-bearing 
strata. 


5# Seventh-day Adventists believe in the Trinity, and rever¬ 
ently worship Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. They believe this 
doctrine to be the teaching of the Bible concerning God in His 
relation to this world and the human race. 

6# The doctrine of the virgin Birth is accepted by the Advent¬ 
ists. They hold that it is one of the vital truths of the Christ¬ 
ian faith, foretold in the Old Testament and confirmed in the New. 

?• Accepting literally Christ's teaching that "he that believ- 
eth and is baptized shall be saved" (Mark l6:l6). Seventh-day

Adventists require all who desire to join their church to he Vap- 
tized by immersion. 

8 . Seventh-day Adventists do not teach that people must obey the 
Ten Commandments in order to be saved. They hold that salvation is 
by grace alone through faith in the atoning death of Jesus Christ. 
Adventists maintain that no one can work his way into heaven. It is 
their contention that no degree of obedience, no works of penance, no 
amount of money entitles anyone to any divine favor. They do believe, 
however, that ”faith without works is dead” and they teach that keep¬ 
ing the oommandraents is the result, the evidence of salvation. To 
Seventh-day Adventists, the observance of the Ten Commandments is a 
matter of love and not a legal duty. This interpretation they base 
upon the injunction of Jesus, ”If ye love me, keep my commandments” 
(John 1I|.:15). 

9. The word “Adventist” in the denominational title is signifi¬ 
cant to the adherents of this church. It indicates their special 
concern for this phase of Christian teaching. Their study of the 
Bible deads them to believe, not only that Christ is corning, but 
that He is coming soon. They believe in a visible, personal return 
of Jesus to this earth. It is the firm belief of Adventists that 
the Second Coming of Christ will cl.imax a sequence of stupendous 
events—political and religious—which will involve the entire 
population of the globe and mark the end of the world, or age, as 
we know it today. 

10. Seventh-day Adventists believe in a millenium. They teach 
that this milleniimi will follow the resurrection of the followers 

of Christ, which they believe will take place upon His Second Coming. 
This millenial reign. Adventists maintain, will take place in heaven, 
not on this earth, which will remain a desolate, depopulated wilder¬ 
ness through this period. The Seventh-day Adventist doctrine pro¬ 
vides for the executive judgment of God upon the wicked at the close 
of the millenial period, to be followed by a purification and rehab¬ 
ilitation of this earth as the future eternal home of the redeemed. 

11. One of the chief reasons advanced by Seventh-day Adventists 
for the soon return of Christ is the unsettled state of world affairs. 
The political developments among the nations and in the social, econ¬ 
omic, and religious, life of the masses are to these people signs of 
the imminent fulfillment of Christ’s promise to return. The invention 
of the atomic and hydrogen bombs, bringing i-dth it fear among the 
political leaders of the nations of the T^rld, and the uneas.iness 
among the masses of the common people, who foresee possible annihila¬ 
tion through the use of nuclear x^reapons, are considered by Seventh- 
day Adventists to be harbingers of the Second Advent. The search for 
security on the part of nations, which is driving them to combine into 
massive conjfederacies, is regarded as a fulfillment of Bible prophecy. 
















33 


The amazing multiplication of inventions that have changed man's 
whole way of life during the past century is regarded as another 
striking fulfillment of the impending return. This unprecendented 
increase in knowledge, with multitudes running to and fro as never 
before is presented by Adventists as a fulfillment of daniel’s 
prophecy in Jan. 12rU. 

Still another sign referred to by Adventists is the moral col¬ 
lapse so evident in social and political life today. 

12. Seventh-day Adventists have never set a definite time for 
Christ to come. They accept literally the statement, "Of that day 
and hour knoweth no man" (Matt. 2kt3^)» 

13* In regard to the question of divorce. Adventists believe 
adultery is the only Biblical groimds for this practice. However, 
thej^ do recognize the right of the State to enact certain statutoiy 
provisions governing the formation and dissolution of the marriage 

contract.^/ 

Ih, Seventh-day Adventists do not drink alcoholic beverages or 
use tobacco. They take this stand as a health measure believing 
that the body is the "temple of the Holy Ghost" (1 Cor. 6:19) and 
that they are obligated to refrain from all harmful indulgences 
which might vreaken their efficiency. They also advocate a health 
reform program vjliich abstains from unclean meats as defined in 
Leviticus 11 and recommends, wherever possible, a vegetarian diet. 

13. Seventh-day Adventists are interested in welfare work. From 
the end of World War II to the end of 1932, they shipped overseas 

to the poor and needy of hi countries more than 1500 tons of cloth¬ 
ing and 2000 tons of food. These shipments are made by their own 
welfare organizations and do not include personal donations by church 
members to other welfare agencies. 

l6. Religious liberty is a cardinal doctrine of Seventh-day 
Adventists. They are champions of religious freedom and have con¬ 
sistently fought such proposals as calendar reform, "blue-law" 
legislation, and other s.imilar suggestions designed to violate the 
principle of the separation of church and state. Their visx^rs on 
this subject are advocated in their magazine Liberty , A Magazine of 
Religious Freedom , published quarterly and devoted exclusively to 
the preservation and extension of religious liberty.

17. In regard to life after death. Adventists hold that life 
comes only from Christ, the source of life. No one, they assert, 
can have eternal life apart from Christ, Man by himself, they say, 
is mortal, subject to death. Immortality, they believe, will not 
be conferred until the resurrection at the Second Coming of Christ. 
Seventh-day Adventists hold that the ancient supposition that people 
go to aeaven or hell irmnediately upon death is an infiltration of 
pagan mythology into Christian theology. 

In sununary. Seventh-day Adventists cla.im they are not inventors 
of nex^ doctrines but recoverers of old truths—truths long eclipsed 
by the infiltration of pagan traditions and superstitions into the 
Christian Church. 

As has already been mentioned in this dissertation, the premil- 
lenarian doctrine is not confined to Seventh-day Adventists but is widely 
accepted among many fundamentalist sects. The practice of Sabbath 
observance, however, is not common outside their ranlcs, except in the 
case of Orthodox Jews, Seventh-day Baptists, and several off-shoot 
movements which grew out of the parent Seventh-day Adventist body. State¬ 
ments such as the follovjing are regarded as partial justification by 
Adventists for their concern in observing the seventh day as sacred time: 

Sabbath—Biblically, the seventh day of the week, and day of 
rest and of joy consecrated to the Lord. Originally the sabbath 
was thought of as extending from sunset of Friday to sunset of 
Saturday, but in^^comm.on usage araong Christians it later came to 
refer to Sunday. 

A somewhat similar view is expressed by Henry C. Tedder in 
^ Dictionary of Religion and Ethics ; 

Sabbath—Traces of the observance of the first day of the week 
are found in the New Testament. ]3ut there is no command to observe

the uy, and in the literature of the first three centuries observ¬ 
ance of the day is regarded as a commemoration of the resurrection 
and a joyful privilege and not an obligation. Tlie ^^irst legal recog¬ 
nition of the day is a decree of Constantins published in 321 A.D., 
wiiich calls it the "venerable day of the sun." Laws requiring rest 
from labor were promulgated in the reign of Charlemagne^ and became 
general in all "Christian" nations. The notion that the obligation 
of the . . . commandment has passed over to Sunday making that the 
"Cliristian Sabbath" is quite modern and is confined to English- 
speaking countries. It was first advocated by_the Rev. Thomas JBownd, 
a clergyman of the Church of England^ in 16i£'6.^^ 

Pfeffer^ in dealing x^ith the legality of passing legislation to 
make Sunday observance compulsory^ quotes this statement; 


The Sabbath of Sinai was the seventh day of the week; the earliest 
recognition of Sunday by Christians is recorded by Justin Martyr, 
lino reported that in the second century the Christians of Rome 
gathered on that day to hear readings from the Scriptures, partici¬ 
pate in common prayer, and dine together, in the manner in wViich the 
Jex^s celebrated the Biblical Sabbath. Sunday was selected as it was 
the day observed by the ilithraists, another popular cult, as the day 
of the 3un-god. Constantine, as part of his program of empire uni¬ 
fication, promulgated the first compulsory Sunday law in the year 
321 li. D. The law read: All judges and city people shall rest on 
the Day of the Sun. Country people, however, may freely attend to 
the cultivation of the fields, because it frequently happens that no 
other days are better adapted for planting the grain in the furrox-js 
or the vines in the trenches. So that the advantage given by hea-^- 
enly providence may not for the occasion of a short time, perish. 


Pfeffer also cites the decision handed dom in one American court 


in relation to the history of Sunday legislation: 

nil Sunday legislation is the product of pagan Romej the Saxon 
laxvTs were the product of the iliddle Age legislation of the Holy 
Roman Hapire. The English Laxfs are the expansion and the American 
are the transcript of the 'dnglish.^^'

Ssventh-day Adventism, in common with its spiritual foreru,nner, 
Ilillerism, undoubtedly has inherent in its teachings certain features 
which invite disagreement on the oart of the coiiimunicants of some relig¬ 
ious faiths and possibl^r vigorous denial in the case of others. Sweet, 
after indicating some of his reasons for not being able to agree fully 
xd.th the teachijigs of Seventh-day Adventists, concludes his appraisal 
as follows: 

But whatever may be said of present-day Adventists, the spiritual 
ciiildren of the tiillerite movement, no religious body in North 
iimerica possesses a more devoted membership or has a higher "sense 
of destiny and divine commission. 

The iducational Philosophy of Seventh-day Adventists 

The presence of Seventh-day Adventists parochial schools in a 
country which may justly pride itself on a progressive and continually 
improving public school system invites an explanation. This explanation 
is found in the philosophy of education which has been formulated by the 
founders and pioneers of the sect, especially Dllen G. hliite, and which 
has received the approval and support of the denominational leaders right 
down to the present time. 

This educational philosophy is inseparably interwoven with their 
concept of life—its origin, its purpose, and its expected culi'oination. 
The religious perspective with which education is viewed elevates this 

■^•^Sweet, loc . cit . 





37 


function of organized society to a position of considerable .importance. 

The adventist concept of education also re-emphasizes their fundamentalist 
position. 

To the orthodox Adventist^ the proper appreciation of the role of 
education involves a return to the time of the Garden of Eden. Since 
they are strict fundamentalists^ this retrospection presents no histori¬ 
cal obstacle. Adventists envision the garden as a place of unsurpassed 
beauty and perfection which provided a fitting home for Adara and Eve, the 
progenitors of the human family. These first parents are regarded as 
having been perfect beings of superior strength and intellect, living in 
an environment unmarked by evi.denc6s of death or decay. As far as the 
eye can see on every hand there ir nothing to mar the scene of surpass¬ 
ing beauty and perfection. 

As the croMuing glory of this ideal society, our first parents 
are considered to have had face-to-face communion with God. Here in 
the garden in the cool of the evening, God talked over the events of 
the day with Adam and Eve. Ellen G. 'White describes the Adventist 
position in these words; ' 

When Adam came from the Creator’s hand, he bore in his physical, 
mental and spiritual natirre, a likeness to his Creator. God created 
man in His image and it was His purpose that the longer man lived, 
the more fully he should reflect the glory of the Creator. All his 
faculties were capable of development5 their capacity and vigor were 
continually to increase. Vast was the scope offered for their exer¬ 
cise; glorious the field opened to their research. The mysteries of 
the vis.ible universe—the wonderfuj. works of Him who .is perfect in 
knowledge—invited man’s study. Face-to-face, heart-to-heart com¬ 
munion with his Maker was his high privilege. Had he rema.ined loyal 
to God, all this would have been his forever. Throughout eternal 
ages he would have continued to gain new treasures of knowledge, to

discover fresh springs of happiness and to obtain clearer and yet 
clearer conceptions of the id.sdom, the power, and the love of God. 

More and more fully would he have fulfilled the object of his 
creation, more and more fully have reflected the Creator’s glory. 

The scene of perfection is not to last and a discordant note enters 
to destroy the harmony of the garden. Sin, with all its attendant evils, 
makes its appearance. Satan beguiles iTve, and through her Adam, to dis¬ 
obey the express command of God. Retribution follows swiftly upon the 
heels of the crime. Expulsion from the beautiful garden, the appearance 
of suffering and death, are only part of the price that Adam and '^ve must 
pay. The hardest blow of all is the loss of face-to-face communion with 
God. Sin has created an abyss between the Creator and the created and 
consternation reigns in heaven, '.ivery agency in heaven and earth is 
enlisted in the struggle to restore the hamony which previously existed 
in the garden. The abyss between a sinless God and His sinning children 
must somehow be bridged. The Seventh-day Adventist contends that life 
with its functions and activities must be so planned that tliis primary 
objective is not obscured. 

It is only vjhen this primary purpose is kept clearly in view that 
the true role of education as viewed by Adventists can be discerned. 
Education becomes not merely the training of the mind and the hand so 
that the educand can acceptably fill his olace in society, hhile this 
function of education is recognized by Adventists as being of great 

•^^Ellen G. TAhite, Education , (Mountain View, California; Pacific 
Press Publishing Association, 1902), p. Ip. 





f?' ■ 








importance,, transcending this secular goal is the sacred obligation of 
helping children and youth to reflect more perfectly the character of 
God, thereby helping to span the chasm between heaven and earth. 

\rhite puts it thus: 

In order to understand what is comprehended in the work of 
education, we need to consider both the nature of man and the 
purpose of God in creating him. We need to consider also the 
change in man’s condition through the coming in of a knowledge 
of evil, and God’s plan for still fulfilling His glorious pur¬ 
pose in the education of the huraan race. 

To the Seventh-day Adventist the highest education is that which 
I'jill teach their children and youth the principles and practices of 
Christianity, which will give them an experimental knowledge of 
God’s vjays, and will impart to them the lesspns that Christ gave to 
His disciples of the paternal nature of God.^° 

In the highest sense, the work of education and the i-ork of 
redemption are one^ for in education, as in redemption, ’’other 
foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus 
Christ. 

Jrom these statements it can be seen that education, to the 
Adventist, is not merely a phase in the preparation of children and 
youth for the responsibilities of adulthood but a sacred obligation 
enjoined upon Christian parents. Sducatior^ in the opinion of Seventh- 
day Adventists, thus becomes an integral part of God’s plan for His 
followers on earth. 

White puts it in these words:

To bring man back into harmony with God, so as to elevate and 
ennoble his moral nature that he may again reflect the image of the 
^ , is the great purpose of all the education and discipline of 



To understand properly the history of Seventh-day Adventist educa¬ 
tion in Canada or elsewhere, the reader must realize that the leaders of 
this sect consider a church-sponsored school system not merely desirable 
but absolutely essential. Their conviction that education cannot be 
safely separated from religious instruction and practice is a motivating 
force behind their efforts to continually expand and improve their educa¬ 
tional facilities. This conviction has been intensified by such admo.ni- 
tions as the following: 

The most important work of our educational institutions at this 
time is to set before the world an example that icill honor God. 

Holy angels are to supervise the work through human agencies and 
every department is to bear the mark of divine excellence. 

Such a view of education as that advocated by AHite in the preced¬ 
ing quotation is bound to affect every phase of the educational process. 
Of necessity the Bible assumes an important place in the curriculum. It 
is regarded as a unifying factor capable of providing inspiration for 
each course presented in the classroom. History, science, literature, 
business methods, and physiology are some of the fields of study which 
are considered to be more clearly understood w^hen studied in conjunction 
viith the Bible. The Adventist evaluation of the role of the Bible in 
education is set forth in these words; 







The Bible contains all the principles that men need in order 
to be fitted either for this life or for the life to corae.^^ 


Again: 


As a . . . stimulus to development, nothing else can equal the 
stud^ of God's word. As a means of intellectual training, the 
Bible is more effective than any other book, or all other books 
combined. The greatness of its themes, the dignified simplicity 
of its utterances, the beauty of its imagery, quicken and uplift 
the thoughts as nothing else can. No other study can impart such 
mental power as does the effort to grasp the stupendous truths of 
revelation. The mind thus brought in contact with the thought of 
the Infinite cannot but expand and strengthen. 


As an educator the Holy Scriptures are without a rival. The 
Bible is the most ancient and the most comprehensive history that 
men possess. It came fresh from the fountain of eternal truths 
and throughout the ages a divine hand has preserved its purity. 

It lights up the far-distant past, where human research seeks in 
vain to penetrate. In '3od's word only do we behold the power that 
laid the foundations of the earth amd that stretched out the heavens. 
Here only we find an authentic account of the origin of nations. 

Here only is given a history of our race unsullied by human pride or 
prejudice.^ • 


From these quotations it is evident that Seventh-day Adventists 


place great confidence in the B.ible as the most im.portant single factor 
in education. To them the Bible contains an infallible exposition of 
all fields of human endeavor and all branches of intellectual activity. 
They contend that there is no branch of legitimate business for which 
the Bible does not afford as essential preparation. The principles of 
diligence, honesty, thrift, temperance, and purity which the Bible advo- 






cates are to them the secret of true success. They cannot .magine a life 
situation which is not covered by some principle enunciated in this Book. 

The fact that there are some references in the Bible which are 
difficult or even impossible of explanation does not present to the 
jidventist any reason for doubting its inspiration. Instead they regard 
the presence of these mysteries as additional proof of the certainty of 
its origin. Since they consider the Bible to be the inspired lord of 
God_, they consider it essential that the knowledge of God which it im¬ 
parts should never be fully comprehended. Instead of achieving full 
imdsrstanding of the mysteries of God^ they prefer to regard growth in 
spiritual knowledge as something akin to a journey into a vast uncharted 
territory whose horizons recede as the traveller advances. 

The mysteries of the Bible^ so far from being an argument against 
it^ are among the strongest evidences of its divine inspiration. If 
it contained no account of God but that wliich we could comprehendj if 
liis greatness and majesty could be grasped by finite minds, then the 
Bible would not, as now, bear the unmistakable evidences of divinity. 
The greatness of its themes should inspire faith in it as the word of 
God. 


It is impossible for any human mind to exhaust even one truth or 
promise of the Bible. One catches the glory from one point of view, 
another from another pointy yet we can discern only gleamings. The 
full radiance is beyond our vision. 

As we contemplate the great things of God’s word, we look into a 
fountain that broadens and deepens beneath our gaze. Its breadth 
and depth pass our knoi-rledge. As we gaze, the vision widens^ 
stretched out before us we behold a boundless, shoreless sea. 


If it were possible for us to obtain a full understanding of God 
and Ris word, there would be for us no further discovery of truth,

no greater loiowledge, no further development. God world cease to 

be supreme^ rnd man would cease to advance. 

The Bible-centered concept of education has left its imprint upon 
the objectives of a Seventh-day adventist school. The folloviing list is 
quite typical of these objectives: • 

1. The development of a character approved of God and in favor i-jith 
man. 

2. To give youth such a vision of the world's need that they may 
be led to dedicate their lives to the service of God in the 
fields of denominational endeavor. 

3. To guard sound health as evidenced b}^ a strong and graceful 
body^ an alert and inquisitive mind^ and a happy and congenial 
spirit. 

U. To develop in the student those attitudes which make possible 
the most successful and harmonious human relationships. 

5. To train ever;- student in the duties, responsibilities, and 
privileges of citizenship. 

6 . To emphasize the dignity of labor and the training of each 
student in a vocation, trade, or profession with sufficient 
skill to earn a livelihood. 

7. To develop the resources within oneself to appreciate and 
enjoy the,noblest in literature, art, music, nature and 
recreation, without depending on the mechanical or the arti¬ 
ficial.^^ 

These objectives will be discussed in some detail in that section 
of t'his dissertation which deals specificially idth Canadian Union College, 
the centre of Seventh-day Adventist educational work in Canada.

Summary 


In this second chapter it has been the purpose of the writer to 
acquaint the reader with the historical bacicground, present strength, 
and educational piiilosophy of Seventh-day Adventists. It has been sho-wn 
that the founders of the sect were dra>ni largely from Baptist and Meth¬ 
odist communicants who were convinced that the second advent was imminent. 

One of the founders of the Seventh-day Adventist denoiaination was 
Ellen G. l-Jhite, to whom is attributed the prophetic gift. Because of her 
interpretation of the role of education in the plan of redemption, the 
Adventist church has become committed to a continually expanding school 
program. Because Seventh-day Adventists emphasize the religious aspect 
of their educational philosophy, the Bible has been assigned an important 
place in the school curriculum.

HISTORiaiL SKETCH 

Introduction 

In this chapter the witer proposes to present a brief historical 
accoujit of the educational work of Seventh-day Adventists in Canada. The 
development of the educational work of Adventists vdll not receive any 
detailed treatment except in the case of Alberta. In the space devoted 
to the Alberta scene^ Canadian Union College vdll be studied quite in¬ 
tensively both in regard to its early history and its evolution to its 
present status. Pertinent facts i-dll be presented in the form of tables 
and figures to enable the reader to gain a better understanding of the 
historical portion of this thesis. 

In those sections of tliis chapter which deal vdLth other provinces 
than xAlbertaj the witer has borrowed material from a term paper written 
by Lav/rence E, Smart, former Educational Secretary of the Canadian union 
Conference of Seventh-day Adventists, Oshawa, Ontario. This term paper, 
”A Brief History of Seventh-day Adventist Church Schools in the Domin¬ 
ion of Canada,” was prepared by Mr. Smart in partial fulfilLment of a 
course taken at the University of Toronto. That portion of this chap¬ 
ter which deals with Alberta is based upon priraary source material, 
including letters, early school bulletins, and personal interviews. Be¬ 
cause Canadian Ikdon College is the centre of Seventh-day Adventist 
education not only in alberta but also in Canada, considerable space 
vdll be devoted to its founding and development. 




Eastern Canada 


£uebec. As far as can be ascertained, the first evidence of the 
preacliing of Seventh-day Adventist doctrines in Canada was during the 
early 1860’s. About that time a retired sea captain, Joseph Bates, 
travelled through .uebec and along the shores of Lake Ontario, holi.ing 
meetings in schoolhouses and in the homes of farmers. He made his tour 
during the mnter and had to travel on foot most of the time. As a 
result of his labours, the first Seventh-day Adventist church in Canada 
was organized at South Stukely, Quebec. It was here at South Stukely 
that the first Adventist church school in Canada opened its doors in 
l88p. The average attendance was twenty and its first teacher was Mary 
Cushing, a young Canadian girl. The succeeding teachers were mainly 
Aiiiericiins and the curriculum and textbooks took on a decidedly /Lmerican 
flavor. At one stage of its existence, the South Stukely school had a 
top enrollment of seventy pupils and a staff of two teachers. Finally 
the enrollment began to decline steadily and the school closed around 
the year 1921. 

The second school sponsored by Seventh-day Adventists was also 
located in Quebec. It was the Fitch Bay High School, strictly a second¬ 
ary school. It was held in a building that served as both school and 
church, during the week classes were conducted while on Saturday the 
desks were piled on the sides of the room and church services were held. 
The Fitch Bay High School continued to operate from I89I1. to 1901. At 
the time of writing, May, 1957^ a small school is being operated by 
Seventh-day Ac-.ventists in Montreal.

Ontario * The next attempt to provide church school education for 
the C'.dldren was launched in Stelton, Ontario, in I 896 . In order to boost 
the enrollment, church members took into their homes children who lived 
at some distance from the school. The Stelton school operated for nine 
years. 

Other attempts were made to establish schools in various centres 
but the first venture which developed into a permanent work vjas begun in 
Lome Park, near Toronto, in the year 1903. Lorndale Academy, a board¬ 
ing school, was located on a fifty-acre farm x^hich included a large, 
twelve-roomed stone house. Although only eight students and two teachers 
were on hand for opening day, the leaders refused to become discouraged. 
The buildings were added to in 1907, but the lex/ enrollraent x/as still a 
discouraging factor. Finally in 1912 it x/as decided to try and secure 
a more favorable location. A nexj tract of land was purchased, near Oshax/a 
and the name of the school changed to Buena Vista Academy. Bven in this 
new location, the enrollirient increased slox/ly but in spite of this lack 
of patronage the facilities were steadily improved and the course offer¬ 
ings x/ere expanded. In 1916, the na/ne of the school was again changed, 
t’ois time to Eastern Canadian Missionary Seminary. Four years later a 
final change of name x/as carried out, the name chosen being Oshax/a Mis¬ 
sionary College. Possibly the most important factor in the ultimate 
success of Oshax/a Missionary College was the establislxment of a x/oodx;ork 
shop. At the present tiiiie, this x/oodwork shop is doing a gross business 
of nearly tx/o hxmdred thousand dollars a year. At the close of the 1953 
fiscal year, the net x/orth of the college was set at more than four

hundred fifty thousand dollars. The enrollment lias never been large^ 
and at the present time averages about one hundred fifteen students. 

In 1918 a house was purchased by the -.indsor Seventh-day Advent¬ 
ist Church and converted into a church and a church school. This school 
continued to operate for four years before being closed. .hen a new 
church was built, provision was made for a large church school room. 

The school was reopened in 1939 and has remained in operation since 
that date. 

For some years the Port Arthur and Fort William Adventist groups 
met as one congregation. As the membership increased, the Port Arthur 
group decided to build a church building of their own. When the funds 
had been raised, the Pert Arthur group changed their original plans and 
decided to invest the money they had raised in a church school rather 
than .in a church. As a result, a church school was built in 1930 and the 
school opened that fall.. The first year the enrollment was only seven 
but it has increased steadily and a thriving school is now being operated. 

The Toronto Seventh-day Adventist Church opened a church schoo.l 
in 1933^ ^vith Hiss Abbie Culbert teaching eighteen children .in one room 
of the church building. The e.nrollraent increased to the point vjhere it 
was necessaiy to open a second church school in another part of the city. 
The second school was opened .in 1938 and remained open for f,ive years. 
Those parents desiring their children to have a church school education 
continued to send them to the original school on Awde Street. T'ois 
situation continued until 1933^ when the WiHowdale school was opened.

At the present time the Awde school employs two teachers and the Willow- 
dale school has one teacher. 

Ottawa saw its first Adventist school in 1933 ■» It remained open 
for only three years before being permanently closed. 

In 1932, the Hamilton Seventh-day Adventist school was opened but 
operated for only two years before being closed. The chnrch members 
were interested in providing a parochial education for their children, 
but they felt they did not have the necessary faci 3 .ities to carry out 
their plans. It v;as not until the year 19^1 that they were able to 
build a nev/ brick church and chiirch school. The Hamilton school is 
modern in every respect, but the enrollment has never been large due to 
the small number of children of school age* 

In 19 i; 7 > a school was opened in the basement of the Paris church. 
Despite the small church membership, the school program has been main¬

In 1952, a sraall church school was opened by Seventh-day Advent¬ 
ists at Haileybury. Because of the small enrollment, it operated for 
only three years.

establish a boarding academy in Ontario, church members in the Marit,imes 
were launching on a new venture. In 1903 ^ the Farraington Industrial 
Academy was opened in Nova Scotia on October 6 . The follovjing year a 
fund was raised to improve facilities at the Academy, but it was decided 
that the existing location was not suitable. Accordingly, a new location 
was secured at dilliamsdale. Nova Scotia. The Academy operated at this 
new location until 1918 , when it was moved to Memramcook, and its narae 
changed once more, this time to the Maritime Conference Academy. It was 
thought that this last move would boost the sagging enrollment, but the 
results T^rere disappointing. Memramcook Academy came to a sudden end when 
it was destroyed by fire in 1932 . Since the depression was at its height, 
funds to rebuild were unavailable. 

Another early educational endeavor on the part of Seventh-day 
Adventists in the Maritimes began in I9O4, at Dickie Mountain, Norton, 

New Brunswick. A Mrs. Martin Kierstead opened a small school in her 
home and for forty years she has operated this school witViout salary 
or compensation from the church, the largest enrollment for a single 
year being nine. Occasionally there has been a year when the school did 
not operate, but at present it is operating. 

Carlingford, in New Brunswick, was the next to secure a church 
schoolo For a number of years it was held in the homes of various mem¬ 
bers. Mhen the enrollment dropped below the point where it was felt 
practical to continue the school, the school was closed. By 193 h the 
number of Adventist children of school age had increased sufficiently 
to warrant the reopening of the school. It vjas again held in the home

of one of the church raembers. However, the school operated for only two 
years when it was again closed. In 19U5 the Carlingford Seventh-day 
iidventist school was reopened in a modern building, and in spite of the 
low enrol]jnent, the prospects for its continued operation seem good. 

The Halifax Seventli-day Adventist church opened a school in the 
fall of 1927 in a room at the back of the church. During the first seven 
years the enrollment grew steadily and the future looked bright. At this 
point, however, teacher difficulties threatened to close down the school. 
In spite of these obstacles, the school continued to operate until the 
spring of 1937. 

The Halifax church reopened th3.s school in 1950, in a large, newly 
renovated room on the first floor of the church building. Twenty-three 
pupils enrolled at the beginning of the new term and the school operated 
to the end of the 1955-56 school term when it was again closed. 

In Moncton, a chiurch school was opened in a room above a store on 
October 12, 1937. Twelve pupils registered on opening day. After oper¬ 
ating for seven years, the school was closed. A year later, however, 
the school was reopened in a new location. Later the church purchased, a 
dwelling house and remodelled the first floor for a classroom. At the 
present time the average■enrollment is about twenty. 

The North Sydney Seventh-day Adventist Church opened a school in 
the basement of the church in 1932. Twenty-three pupils enrolled in this 
school the first year. At the present temie plans are being made to 
relocate the school in a different building. 









In September of 3.9^6, a new school was opened at Barnesville, dew 
Brunswick. 

Table XII lists the various school teachers and the enrollment in 
the Seventh-day Adventist church schools in the Haritimes. Figure 3 
locates these paracliial schools on a map of the Maritimes, 

Newfoundland . The situation in Newfoundland, Canada's island 
province, is quite different from that existing in any other of Canada's 
provinces. 

Nei'jfoundland does not have a state educational system. Instead, 
it grants financial aid on a per capita enrollment basis to the relig¬ 
ious denominations which mil build and maintain school facilities and 
f'arnish a teacher. Nhat it really amounts to is that the religious 
organizations provide the physical olant and the state pays the teacher's 
salary. As a denomination, Seventh-day Adventists ’nave been strong 
advocates of the doctrine of Separation of Church and State. They are 
opposed to accepting state funds to carry on their educational program. 
Religious instruction is optional in Newfoundland and as long as the 
standard curriculum is adequately handled, t’ne governiaent does not inter¬ 
fere. After considerable deliberation and in the face of grave raisgivlngs 
on the part of some. Seventh-day Adventists have followed the example of 
other religious groups in Newfoundland. In view of these conditions, the 
Seventh-day Adventist schools in Newfoundland are not church schools in 
the true meaning of that term. Approximately tx?o-thirds of the enroll¬ 
ment of Adventist schools in Newfoundland are from non-Adventist homes.

The first and largest school to be opened by Seventh-day Adventists 
in Newfoundland was the St. Jolin*s sdiool, opened in 1902. It has grown 
to a seven-teacher school, offering instruction from kindergarten to 
grade XI. At the time of writing (May, 1957), one-room schools are also 
operated by Seventh-day Adventists with government assistance at Corner- 
brook and Botwood. 

Table XIH gives a suramaiy of the pertinent facts regarding 
schools, teachers, and enroUjnent in the Seventh-day Adventist scnools 
in Newfoundland. Figure ii locates these schools on a map of Newfound¬ 
land. 

Western Canada, Excluding Alberta 

Manitoba . The Seventh-day Adventists in Manitoba made an attempt 
to found a boarding school for Adventist youth. In 190ii, a school was 
opened on a farm of one himdred thirty acres near Portage La Prairie. 

0. A. Hall was the first principal when the school opened on November 22. 
Although only twenty-three students were present on registration day, it 
took several days to conplete the task, since it had to be carried on in 
several languages, such as Russian, German, and other European tongues. 

Mr. Hall became sick in 1908 and a series of reverses led to the closing 
of the school in 1910. At the present time, the only school operated by 
Seventh-day Adventists in Manitoba is a two-room school in Winnipeg. 
Instruction is offered in grades I to X, and the pupils are drawn from 
the three Adventist churches in the city.

Saskatchewan * Adventists in Saskatchewan also participated in 
the general campaign to provide a boarding school where Seventh-day 
Adventist youth could secure a secondary education. For a few years 
before 190f?, the government headquarters for the Northwest Teridtory 
were located at North Battleford. Tlie buildings included the governor *s 
house, legislative buildings, a hospital, and other buildings. This 
group of buildings was purchased by the Saskatchewan Conference of 
Seventh-day Adventists and in this way Battleford Academy was born. The 
acadeiny property was located about two miles south of the town of Battle¬ 
ford, a thriving tovin on the main railway line. 

The first school term opened on November 1, 19l6, with C. B. 

Flughes serving as principal and Bible teacher. He was assisted by his 
wife and two other teachers. It is interesting to note certain state¬ 
ments from the first published announcements 

It is mth suitable feelings of joy and pride that this first 
announcanent is sent forth calling attention to the opening of the 
Battleford Academy. The preparation for the erection of this 
institution was made possible only by the kind assistance of 
interested friends, the loyalty and sacrifice of our people in 
this province, and above all the gentle guidance of the Father 
of all mercies who knows the needs of His children before they 
tell Him.l 

From the very first, attention was given to the place of manual 
labor in a well-rouiKied system of education. The founders of Battleford 
Academy sought to integrate the work program into the scholastic program. 
The initial announcement onphasizes the importance of labor thus:

This school has been established upon the same basis that 
underlies the system of education provided by the Seventh-day 
Adventist denomination in all parts of the world. All who enter 
this institution will be provided with opportunities that will 
make for an all-round education. It is the firm belief of the 
promoters of this school that the hand as well as the heart and 
mind should be trained to supply the varied needs of human life. 

Christianity in its truest sense comprehends in its scope of 
education, spiritual, literary, and manual training . 

Manual labor, therefore, holds a dignified place in the cur¬ 
riculum of the Battleford Acadeny. Judicial labor is a healthful 
tonic and should be freely engaged in by everyone. 2 

In order to insure participation of all students in the program 
of manual labor, each student registered in the academy was required to 
do two hours of free manual labor each day. AH lost time had to be 
made up or paid for at the rate of ten cents an hour unless the student 
was excused by reason of sickness. 

The financial charges are reminiscent of an era long past. For 
a seventeen-week period, a charge of thirty-five dollars provided for 
room, heat, light, plain laundry, and full tuition. The arrangement 
for meals was described as follows: 

Board will be served on the cafeteria plan. this plan the 
student selects his food and pays for the amount taken. It is 
ejected that board will be obtained for two dollars a week. The 
minimum charge for board is six dollars a month. Board must be 
paid for in advance.3 

Due to the fact that the faculty were newly appointed to their 
task, it was not possible to make any specific statement regarding the 


^Ibid . 

%bid ., p. 13. 







6ii 

courses to be taught. The initial announcement recognized the difficulty 
of outlining a definite curriculum. 

Inasmuch as this is the first year of our school, and our 
facility have not, as yet, counselled together in regard to the 
work to be offered, we hesitate to publish details of the course. 
Furtheiroore, as it is yet uncertain as to the number and class 
of students who will attend, we withhold the announcing of our 
curriculum.^ 

During this first year, instruction was limited to the first ten 
grades. The enrollment reached n) | and the administration of the school 
was optimistic regarding the future. 

The daily program was designed to establish routine in the lives 
of the students.

So encouraged were the directors that the faculty was increased 
from four to thirteen members by the opening of the second year of opera¬ 
tion. The addition of grade XI further reflected this optimism. The 
curriculum, at first, was patterned closely after the American unit system.

A GMPHICAL REPRESENTATION OF THE NUl^'iBER OF GRADUATES FROM BATTR-’FOrP ACiilERT, I92O-I93O 













































69 

Within two years a rapid transition to the spiral system outlined by 
the Saskatchewan Department of Education had begvin. 

During the same period, Canadian Junior College, at Lacombe, was 
developing rapidly and it was felt by some that one school would be 
sufficient to handle the enrollment from the four western provinces. In 
addition, the enrollment during the school term 1929-30 had dropped to 
ninety, which was the smallest enrollment since Battleford Academy 
opened its doors in 1916. 

During the fifteen years that Battleford Acaderqy was operated by 
the Seventh-day Adventists, seven men served as principal. (See Table 
XIV.) The average enrollment (all grades) during this same period was 
131* The enrollment by years is represented graphically in Figure 5* 

The first academy graduating class made its appearance in 1920, when ten 
students successfully completed the prescribed course. Figure 6 shows 
the number of graduates of Battleford Academy between the years 1920-31. 

The slumping enrollment seemed to support the view that it was not 
feasible to support two schools—Canadian Junior College and Battleford 
Academy—so close together. As a result Battleford Academy was sold to 
the Cblate Fathers. Although this atteii 5 )t to establish a boarding school 
was not entirely successful, it served as a beginning. During the years 
that have intervened, a number of elementary schools have been established 
by Seventh-day Adventists for the purpose of providing an elementary 
school education for their children. In 1915> a small school was started 
at Tugaske in the home of a Mrs. George Foulston. The following year a

small school building was constructed and it served as a church school 
until it closed in 1928. At the present time, church schools are being 
operated at Saskatoon, Moose Jaw, Regina, and Macrorie. 

Table XV lists the Seventh-day Adventist church schools in 
Manitoba and Saskatchewan, together with other pertinent information. 
Figure 7 locates these schools on a map of this area. 

British Columbia . The first major experiment in British Columbia 
was at Pitts Meadow, where Manson Acaden^jr was opened in 1907. Plagued 
by low enrollment and lack of funds, it only operated until 19lU. The 
first educational work in British Columbia which achieved any permanence 
was begun in the Okanagan Valley in 1916. School was opened with an 
enrollment of thirteen, but this figure rose steadily until it became 
apparent that increased accommodations would have to be found. An old 
hotel building was secured at Benvoulen. The rooms served as a dormi¬ 
tory and classes were held in the large parlor. When school opened in 
the old hotel in 1919, Miss Eva White was the first teacher. The fol¬ 
lowing year it became apparent that a new location was needed to care 
for the continued increase in enrollment. The new site chosen was at 
Rutland, five miles northeast of Kelowna, where the Okanagan Acadeiqy 
continues to flourish. At the present time the staff consists of seven 
teachers with the average enrollment less than two hundred. 

Nearly all Seventh-day Adventist secondary schools are managed 
by the provincial executive officers of the church. In this way they 
receive subsidies from the local conferences and additional financial

support from other churches in the conference. In the case of the 
Okanagan Academy, practically the entire burden rests upon the Rutland 
Seventh-day Adventist church, which has a membership of approximately 
four hundred. 

North of Rutland, on the Grandview Flats, several Seventh-day 
Adventist families established their homes before the first World Mar. 
Since many of these settlers were of German descent, most of the church 
services were conducted in the German language. When the first church 
school was opened in 1912, classes were conducted entirely in German. 
For the first two years the school was held in the church building, but 
in 1915 a new two-room school was built. This year also marked the end 
of instruction in German. VJhen the enrollment continued to increase, a 
third teacher was engaged in 1913. About the year 1925, the enrollment 
dropped and the staff was reduced to one teacher. At the present time, 
the Grandview Flats school is a two-teacher school. 

Sydney, on Vancouver Island, is an ingjortant centre for Seventh- 
day Adventists in British Columbia. A small island which is joined by 
a causeway to Vancouver Island was purchased by a prosperous prairie 
farmer, a Seventh-day Adventist, and presented as a gift to the Advent¬ 
ist church. A small hospital and sanitarium. Rest Haven Sanitarium, 
was established on the gift property. To take care of the children of 
Adventist families that moved into the community, a church school was 
opened in the early part of 1922. School was held for twenty-three 
years in a small building near the sanitarium. In 1914-5, a new school 
was built on property located about one-quarter of a mile from the

hospital. In 19U7> when the enrollment continued to increase, the new 
school was ronodelled into a two-room school. 

White Rock had a Seventh-day Adventist school between the years 
1933"5l» Finally, after eighteen years of operation, the school was 
closed for lack of enrollment. 

A small Seventh-day Adventist church is located at Silver Creek. 

In spite of their small membership, they made an effort to provide a 
church school education for their children. School was first opened 
in the fall of 1936 and was held in the home of one of the church mem¬ 
bers. Although only six pupils were enrolled when school opened, plans 
were laid for constructing a separate school building. As a result, a log 
building was erected on a wooded hillside and a small cottage was provided 
for the teacher. The enrollment at Silver Creek has risen as high as 
twenty-eight, but for the most part it has been a little less. 

The Langley Prairie Seventh-day Adventists erected a church build¬ 
ing in 19U2 and a church school the following year. In spite of the prob¬ 
lem of a frequent change of teachers, the attendance increased steadily 
until the school building became too small. In 191^7, the church built a 
modem two-room school with the added advantage of the necessary service 
rooms. Since September of 19U7> grades one to ten have been taught in 
this school. 

The Gres ton Seventh-day Adventist church has only a small member¬ 
ship, but they opened a church school in 19^2. The enrollment has never 
grown much, but a new school was built a few years after the opening of 
the school.

In a Seventh-day Adventist school was opened in Penticton, 

with an enrollment of twenty. It continued to operate for four years 
before being closed for lack of enrollment. 

The Winfield Seventh-day Adventist church school commenced opera¬ 
tions in 19U6« The enrollment was fourteen and classes were held in a 
biiilding loaned to the church by Mr. Del Reiswig, a local church member. 
In 19U8, the church members decided to build a new school and within two 
weeks time from the laying of the foundation a large, two-room school was 
completed. At the present time, a one-room school is being operated. 

The Mssion City Seventh-day Adventist school was opened in 1914-6. 
The building used as a school is an old building located in the hills 
above the town. The building has been renovated and while it is far from 
ideal, it continues to serve the puipose. 

In addition to the schools mentioned above, the Seventh-day 
Adventist church operates schools in New Westminster, Oliver, Malakwa, 
Terrace, and Prince George. 

The Seventh-day Adventist church schools in British Columbia are 
located on the map contained in Figure 8. Table XVI summarizes the pre¬ 
sent standing of Seventh-day Adventist education in British Columbia.

In keeping with the title of this treatise, considerable space

the principal attempt by Seventh-day Adventists in Alberta to establish 
an educational centre for their youth. 

The first church school established by Seventh-day Adventists 
was located a few miles north of Tees in the year 1903. A few Adventist 
families had moved into the district from the Iftiited States about the 
turn of the centuiy and they soon started to lay plans for the establish¬ 
ment of a school* Pastor J. ¥. Boynton, who was in charge of the district 
for the Seventh-day Adventists, recalls this early attempt at establish¬ 
ing a parochial school in these words: 

There were several families some twenty-five miles southeast of 
Ponoka. From them and from Harmattan there was a call for schools, 
but we had no teacher. I wrote to Miss LaRena Carpenter, of Nebraska, 
a girl who had been with us in College View, wtiile she was attending 
college. AH we could offer her was $15 per month with board and 
room, and a home with us when not teaching. She came and did faith¬ 
ful work for about two years.^ 

This school was held in the home of L. D. House. School opened 
with four children, John and Hazel Bates and Zola and Verna House. Later, 
four children of Charles Reed, Harry, Mary, Vdlda, and Edwin, attended 
the school. Mrs. Zola House-Budd recalls the crude home of her parents 
in which this first school was held: 

It was a crude affair, but at that time Ponoka was our nearest 
town and that was twenty miles away. My father and some other men 
hewed out the logs, hauled thorn to the building site, then had a 
house-raising bee. He got some rough lumber from some place and 
our beds, tables, and some other pieces of furniture were made of

that • • • • The house was l6 by 2h feet in size with two storeys. 

The school room was upstairs, a partition dividing the upstairs in 
half. The other half of the upstairs had two beds, one for the 
teacher and the other for nyr sister and me. . . .We had regular 
school desks.7 

Miss LaRena Carpenter taught this home school for only one year 
before leaving for Harmattan, west of Olds, where a school was conducted 
for a few months. Her place at Tees was taken by her mother, Mrs. Nellie 
Carpenter, who taught the school for the next two years. The school was 
closed at the end of the third year because some of the families moved to 
the new school at Lacombe and some moved back to the United States. 

The next attempt to open a Seventh-day Adventist church school in 
Alberta was at Leavings, now known as Granum. This school was opened in 
the fan of 1906 and operated for only six months. Chester Rick, now 
living in Lacombe, attended this early school and has supplied most of 
the details which follow. 

Charles Rick and his family lived at Claresholm, where they were 
the only Seventh-day Adventists. There were five or six Adventist fam¬ 
ilies at Granum and the Ricks used to drive there on Saturday to attend 
church services. When it was decided to start a church school at Granum, 
Charles Rick decided to move so as to be able to send his five children 
to this school. The men decided to build a new school, so a work party 
went to the foothills west of Granum. Included in this party were the 
following men: Knutson, Anderson, Christiansen, Vaughn, Averill, Clausen,

and RLck* The logs were taken to a mill and it was early fall before the 
lumber was ready. The small school was built on the edge of town. It 
was l8 by 2h feet and contained home-made desks. 

Pastor Boynton arranged for Victor Hawley, of North Dakota, to 
come and teach the new school. Victor Hawley, who was a young man in his 
early twenties, found over thirty children, all of Scandinavian descent, 
when he arrived in the fall of 1906. American texts were used exclusively 
and American history and geography were included in the curriculum in 
preference to their Canadian counterparts. The winter of 1906 was very 
cold and the room was heated by means of a wood-burning airtight heater.^ 

Victor Hawley describes his experience in this Seventh-day 
Adventist school in the following words: 

The denomination at that time had nothing to offer church schools. 
There was no course of study, no textbooks to speak of, and what few 
there were were almost unusable. Every teacher was a law unto him¬ 
self. I had thirty-four pupils, frcm one beginner to several taking 
part grade nine work, ^e began at nine and the advanced pupils 
didn’t get out until sometime near five. ¥e used the church building 
for our school, and it was on a rise of ground about a half mile or 
so east of town. I received fifteen or twenty dollars a month and 
board, ’’boarded around. ”9 

The school operated for only six months. The following year 
Victor Hawley was hired to teach a church school near Leduc. Following 
the closing of the school, the building continued to serve as a chiirch. 

In 1921, the building was moved to Stavely, where it was used until 1935.

Because most of the church members moved away, the building was finally 
sold in 1935 and moved to the farm of John T.'allace. 


Canadian Union College * VJhat is now knom as Canadian l&iion 
College has passed tiirough three main stages of development: 

1. The stage during which it was know as the Alberta Industrial 
Academy, 1907-1918. 

2. The period during which it was called Canadian Junior College, 
1918-19U6. 

3. The period from 19U6 to the present, during which the school 
has been known as Canadian Union College. 

The plan for the establishment of the Alberta Industrial Academy 
dates from the arrival of Pastor and Mrs. C. A. Burman in Alberta in the 
year 1906. Pastor Burman was the first president of the newly organized 
Alberta Conference of Seventh»day Adventists. Their first contact mth 
their new parish was at an old-fashioned campmeeting held at Red Deer. 
Pastor Burman was impressed with the large number of fine young people 
who attended this meeting and he set about making arrangements to provide 
a training school for them. 

Mrs. Human, who now lives in California, recalls these early days 
as follows: 

As he (Pastor Buman) talked with them individually, they expressed 
an earnest desire for a school. Most of them, though mature in years, 
had done nothing beyond elementaiy school work. Tiirough the summer, 
the burden on his heart grew. Finally, although there were no funds 
available for beginning educational work, the conference committee 
voted to conduct a three-months experiment.!^

As the first move toward implementing this decision, the old 
Record Building was rented in the town of Leduc. This building had one 
long room downstairs, the several living rooms upstairs. The downstairs 
was divided into a kitchen and two classrooms with movable partitions. 

This made it possible to provide a large chapel or dining room. 

Pastor Burraan took charge of the school and taught the Bible 
classes; Mrs. Burman conducted a review of the common branches of learn¬ 
ing; Pastor W. 0. James gave instruction in the methods of selling denom¬ 
inational books, and Mrs. L. T. Heaton served as cook. This first school 
was really a canvassers* school designed to train the young people present 
in the art of salesmanship. 

Twenty-seven students were enrolled that first year. Mrs. Burman 
remembers one awkward young man who strode in one day and introduced 
himself ,:ith these words, ”1 don*t know nothing, but I*ve come to learn.” 
Before the end of this experimental three months* term, the students be¬ 
gan to clamor for another, longer school session. In anticipation of 
such a demand, the church leaders had already purchased a farm about two 
miles west of Leduc. There were only two small buildings, one frame and 
one log. These buildings could be made usable for living accommodations 
but there was no classroom space. In addition, there was no money to 
buy lumber vjith which to put up new buildings or to remodel the existing 
facilities. 

About that time it was learned that it was possible to cut logs 
on government land for a reasonable price. The young men proposed that 
a group go west and cut logs near the Saskatchewan River, float them to

Strathcona in the spring, and use the lumber thus obtained for additions 


to the buildings. The trip to the woods is recalled by Mrs. Burmans 

Then came the trip to the woods. There were eighteen men, two 
cooks (sixteen-year-old Hazel Edwards and l) eight horses, three 
bobsleds, and a cutter. Since it was the first of April, the snow, 
still three feet deep on the level, was beginning to melt rapidly. 
Before we started I made eighteen pairs of canvas leggings, hip 
length, to help the men keep dry. The women of the church certainly 
did their part. They had baked 130 loaves of bread, besides 
cookies, pies, cakes, cooked beans, and other food. We also took 
additional flour, fresh and dried vegetables, canned foods, and 
fifteen gallons of milk, which we kept sweet in oior snowbank 
refrigerator.il 

After three weeks of hard work, 1700 logs were piled on the bank 
of the North Saskatchewan River, ready for the spring thaw. When the 
ice melted in the spring, two of the boys went back to float the logs 
doi«i the river to a mill in Strathcona. 

The lumber obtained from this venture was used to build an addi¬ 
tion to the frame building, containing a kitchen, two classrooms, and 
bedrooms. The classrooms were separated by large doors which could be 
opened to provide for one large dining room, chapel, or church. 

Living conditions were very crude. The boys went to their rooms 
above the dining room by means of slats nailed across the studdings. The 
only lighting system was provided by kerosene laiaps and gasoline pressure 
lamps j the heating was provided by wood stoves and the water system was a 
barrel behind the kitchen stove. 

In the year 1909, the school was moved again, this time to its 
present location near the toxm of Lacombe. J. I. Beardsley, from South

was only one building—a large bam. The men lived in the attic of this 
barn and the girls lived in snowbound tents until the laundry building 
was completed and available for use. >/hen the school was moved to 
Lacombe, it was the original plan to establish both a sanitarium and a 
school, but the former venture was never realized. 

During the first year at Lacombe, the Board of Management for the 
Alberta Industrial Academy consisted of the follovdng individuals: C. A. 
Burraan, J. I. Beardsley, H. Block, F. J. Hippach, Dow James. 

In that year school opened on October 13, 1909, and closed on 
May 2li, 1910. The faculty included: 

J. E. Beardsley, Principal, Business Manager, Bible Instructor 

I. G. Ortner, Preceptor, Mathematics, German, and Bible 

Mrs. Leona Burman, English 

Miss Essie Barber, Preceptress and Matron, Hydrotherapy 

I'lrs. A. J. Beardsley, Science and History.^3 

The picturesque nature of the new site chosen for the Alberta 
Industrial Academy was described in the third annual calendar in these 
wordss 


The site chosen for the building is on an elevation one hundred 
feet above the water at Barnett Lake, overlooking the village of 
Lacombe and five bodies of water. Spread out before the eye to 
the south and east is an extensive valley, dotted here and there 
with farm houses, groves and grain fields. Twenty miles of this

valley are visible from this spot, and the trains on the C & E 
railroad may be seen for a distance of fifteen miles as they pass 
in and out of Lacombe.l^ 

The principal purpose of the school was to impart a moral train¬ 
ing. This purpose was set forth in the following wordsr 

Recognizing the evil that is in the world today, and knowing 
that much of it is instilled into the youth through wrong training, 
it is the aim of this institution to keep ever before the pupils 
the fact that true education consists of restoring the image of 
God in the ,soul. 

The Bible is recognized as the inspired Word of God, the source 
of all wisdom, and as containing the foundation principles of all 
science. It is taught with the view of inspiring each student with 
the noble aim of giving the world the gospel due this generation. 

The administration approved the democratic approach to the problem 
of discipline as evidenced by the following paragraph: 

As far as possible students are led to place themselves upon 
their honor, and to do right because it is right. They are 
taught that self-government is the only true government for the 
individual, and that it is only when they fail to govern them¬ 
selves in harmony with right principles that they will need to 
be governed by others.^^ 

The expenses were low in keeping ;d.th the economy which prevailed 
in 1909 . Dormitoiy students were required to pay only |12.50 in cash 
plus \x2 hours of labor for each four-week peilod in return for room, 
board, tuition, light, heat, and plain washing. The board consisted of 
two meals a day, and a light luncheon in the evening.

The library facilities were meager. At the end of the school 
year previous to the move to Lacombe, there were only sixty voliimes in 
the library. Before the beginning of the 1909-1910 term, a thirty-two 
volume set of Encyclopedia Brittanica was purchased and friends of the 
school were invited to donate to the school any books which could be of 
benefit to the students. 

The course of study outlined for grades seven to ten was not 
extensive. It was based on the American concept that four units con¬ 
stituted a full year*s work.

The basic principle of co-education was accepted, but anything in 
the nature of flirtation or the formation of attachments between the 
sexes was felt to interfere with the school work and was discouraged. 
Association between the sexes was expected to be restricted to the 
ordinary forms of civility.

The third annual calendar covering the 1909-10 school year carried 
the announcement that the board of management had been successful in 
securing the services of two efficient German teachers and classes were 
offered in German Bible, reading, grammar, spelling, and xirriting. By the 
191it-15 school tern, the German departiiient had expanded to the place 
where a four-year course was offered covering grades seven to ten 
inclusive. The demand for this department resulted from the large

An elementary department was also maintained for the benefit of 
those living near the academy. Church school instruction was offered in 
grades I to VI. During the year 1913-19lU^ the enrollment in the depart¬ 
ment had risen to thirty-six. 

The first graduate was ^/'iilliara A. Clemenson, who graduated from 
the academic course in 1913* Following his graduation, IJilliam Clemenson 
served as a pastor and local conference president across Canada. At the 
time of writing (May, 1957) he is living in retirement in Ontario. One 
of his daughters is the wife of Arnold Tyson-Flyn, who is presently 
serving as superintendent of the commercial press being operated at 
Canadian liiion College. 

As mentioned previously in this thesis, the entire approach to 
the educational program at the /ilberta Industrial Academy was from the 
American viewpoint. The four-unit program was followed exclusively. 

The entire administrative force and teaching staff were dedicated to 
the American plan. It remained for an American to analyze the situation 
and do something about it. This man was E. D. Dick, who during the 
school term 191k-l5 was serving as dean of men and assistant in the 
chemistiy department of LMon College, IdLncoln, Nebraska, when he re¬ 
ceived an invitation to become principal of Alberta Industrial Academy. 
The school proper consisted of three fraJTie buildings located on the hill 
overlooking the valley. E. D. Dick recalls some of his early experiences 
thus: 

^y home was a very poorly built house. It was not insulated 
in any way. The kitchen lean-to was built on wooden piles and I 
didn't know enough about the severity of the winters to make

adequate preparation for banking the house, so that winter was 
rather strenuous. ... It was a very, very cold winter. I well 
remember that when we dropped water on the floor and turned to 
wipe it up we would find that it was ice. The house had no water 
supply and the water was brought to the house on an old sled draim 
by oxen and placed in an open barrel in the kitchen. . • • The 
school buildings were heated by stoves, most of which stood in the 
halls of the dormitories. In the classrooms the students huddled 
about the stoves and did their best to study or recite. I often 
said that it seemed like there was not less than half a mile of 
stovepipes in those halls, which we removed eveiy summer and 

cleaned.19 

Many of those inconveniences were gradually removed and Mr. Dick 
found opportunity to turn his attention toward some of the scholastic 
problems which faced the school. He recalls some of these problems 
thus: 


The school in its early days was manned by teachers from the 
United States, and these seem to have forgotten that they were 
educating the young people from Canada. When I came here I began 
to realize the situation, and discovered that they were teaching 
Merican history, using Barnes* American History as a textbook. 

This gave the full record of the American Revolution, the Civil 
War, the War of 1012, and the Spanish-American War, ^t cetera , 
without any particular reference to Canadian history. They were 
also teaching American geography, using Rand-McNally* s geography 
as a te:ctbook. This gave page after page of details concerning 
the population and growth and so forth of all the States in the 
Union, the products, principal cities, et cetera. WTien they came 
to the geography of Canada, it was passed over in one or two 

pages.20 

Dick realized the unsatisfactory state of affairs. The young 
people who were being trained under this system were out of step mth 
the system prevailing in Canada. The school was operated on the 
regular American plan of four units a year. A student who started under

this system and for some reason was forced to transfer back to the piib3j.c 
school system was placed at a great disadvantage. For this reason many 
of the young people and parents refused to support the academy. 

The problem was further aggravated when it was decided to offer 
a teacher-training course at the academy in order to supply teachers 
for the elementary church schools in the province. The prerequisite of 
this course was the completion of ten grades. The courses in teaching 
methods vie re included diuring grades XI and XII. VJhen the Alberta 
Department of Education refused to recognize the teacher-training pro¬ 
gram as providing qualification to teach in Alberta, the administration 
of the Alberta Industrial Academy abandoned their plan to train teachers. 
This setback persuaded Dick and his associates that nothing could be 
gained by refusing to conform with the educational practices existing 
in the province at that time. 

E. D* Dick recalls this major decision in the following words: 

¥e felt that we must bring out methods of administration into 
line with the provincial methods, that is, drop the four-unit 
system and adopt what might be called the spiral system. We 
entered upon a study of this and spent long hours in trying to 
understand the methods which we would need to follow and the steps 
which must be taken in order to meet this end. The problem was how 
to retain our peculiar identity, teach subjects which we felt we 
must give, and yet give all we must give in the province. 21 

The bulletin for the year 1918-19 referred to this change as 
follows: 

Previous to last year the basis of the course of study offered 
in our school was the four-unit plan. Beginning with last year we

began to operate our course of study on the plan of the high schools 
of this country* By so doing we in no way compromise the principles 
of Christian education* It vras thought best to adopt this course 
to promote our school interests in this field. At the late educa¬ 
tional convention, this course of study was adopted for our school. 
This meets the demands of both our provincial and denominational 
standards and will be fully recognized by the educational department 

of both systems.22

"When the change was made from the four-unit system to the spiral 
system, it was hoped that the enrollment would grow. The school admin¬ 
istration was not disappointed. The constituency indicated their approval 
by sending an ever-increasing number of youth to the Alberta Industrial 
Academy. The enrollment increased so rapidly that it was found necessary 
to double the size of the administration building in 1918 and to enlarge 
the girls’ dormitory in 1920. 

Ety the year 1918 it was felt that the time had come to lay plans 
to offer work above the academy level, thus raising the offerings to that 
of a junior college. These plans were made in cooperation with the 
Department of Education of the General Conference of Seventh-day Advent¬ 
ists, located at Washington, D. C. It was agreed that any courses pur¬ 
sued on a junior college level would be recognized by the senior colleges 
maintained by the denomination in the United States. This decision met 
with considerable favor among the constituency and a further impetus was 
given to the increasing enrollment. 

In keeping with the contemplated elevation to junior college 
status, it was felt advisable to transfer control from the Alberta Con¬ 
ference of Seventh-day Adventists to the Ivestem Canadian Union Conference,

embracing the four western provinces. In this way the school at Lacombe 
would serve as the union training school for western Canada. 

The first step toward this end was taken in October, 1918, when 
the proposed transfer was approved. In February, 1919, the formal trans¬ 
fer was made effective and the name of the school was changed to Canadian 
Junior College. Extensive improvements were outlined and the first two 
years of college work were added to the offerings. The college courses 
were designed to meet the needs of the students in the following fields: 
pre-medical, ministerial, and junior arts. The folloi>ring year, pre¬ 
nursing was added to the junior college offerings. 

The school term 1921-22 also saw another important development 
with the establishment of two new industries—^woodworking and dressmaking. 
At first the woodworking shop limited its production to supplying study 
tables for the dormitory rooms and larger tables for the library. The 
dressmaking department made both ladies* and men’s garments. This school 
year of 1921-22 also saw the termination of E. D. Dick’s leadership when 
he accepted an invitation to mission service in South Africa. 

Dick's successor was C. L. Stone, who was not convinced of the 
desirability of following the spiral system. As a result of Stone’s 
views, considerable difference of opinion arose and considerable unrest 
existed among the staff. J. I. Beardsley succeeded Stone, but served 
for only one school term, 1923-2U* He shared his predecessor’s views 
regarding the shortcomings of the spiral system, and the unsettled state 
of affairs was further aggravated.

The appointment of Henry J. Klooster as principal in 192U marked 
a gradual return to more stable conditions. The four-unit system had its 
supporters, however, and for a number of years it was offered con¬ 
currently with the spiral system. Students starting on either course 
found it most difficult to transfer to the other when they desired to 
do so, Graduail^y this plan to offer both courses fell into disfavor 
with students and administration and by 1928 the spiral system had again 
completely replaced the four-unit system. 

A forward step in the industrial field was taken during the 
192ii.-25 school term when printing was added to the school curriculum. 

The offerings were further increased in 1926 when a Bible Workers’ course 
was originated. The purpose of this course was the training of young 
people desirous of engaging in home missionary work. Also since 1926, 
Canadian Union College has been authorized by the General Conference of 
Seventh-day Adventists to offer pre-medical training to college students. 
This pre-medical training is accepted by the liberal arts colleges main¬ 
tained by the denomination in the United States and finally by the College 
of Medical Evangelists, Loma linda, California, a grade A medical college 
ovjned and operated by Seventh-day Adventists. 

On May 26, 1930, disaster overtook Canadian Junior College ^/jhen 
fire destroyed the administration building, the boys' dormitory and the 
manual arts building. Within a few weeks construction was started on 
two new reinforced concrete structures to replace the buildings which had 
been destroyed. This construction was financed partly through appropria¬ 
tions made by the denomination and partly through donations from patrons 
and friends of the institution.

The next major phase in the development of the school at Lacombe 
coincided with the appointment, in 19U5j of E. E. Bietz as president* 

Bietz set out to accomplish two main objectives* 

1* An extensive building program designed to inprove the physical 

plant. 

2. The addition of two more years of study to the theological 
course so that it wo^Jild not be necessary for Canadian students to transfer 
to American schools in order to qualify for the Bachelor of Theology 
degree. 

Backed by generous appropriations from the Canadian Union Confer¬ 
ence of Seventh-day Adventists and also from the General Conference of 
Seventh-day Adventists, a number of improvements were made. A large 
portion of the campus was re-landscaped and a number of new bu.ildings 
were erected. The largest project was the erection in 1956 of Maple Hall, 
a girls’ domitory, at a cost of more than |2lt0,000. This three-storey

building was constructed of reinforced concrete for floors and ceilings 
with the walls being brick tile. 

In 1950, a new cafeteria which included facilities for a home 
economics department was constructed at a cost of approximately $70,000. 

It was during this period of expansion of the physical plant that 
Canadian I&iion College encountered a financial threat to its operation, 
liider a provincial ordinance, private institutions are subject to a 
municipal tax on all buildings including those used for educational 
purposes, unless exempted by appropriate clauses appearing in their 
charter. 

To remedy this oversight, a private bill was introduced into the 
Alberta legislature to make provision for the exemption of certain build¬ 
ings and lands from municipal taxation. (See Figure 9 for a sketch show¬ 
ing size and location of buildings and lands on which exemption was 
requested.) The following list indicates the buildings on which exemption 
was requested, together with the cost of each building and its use: 

1. Administration Building - (Cost 165,057*56) Used for class¬ 
rooms, library, music studios and practice rooms, administrative offices, 
and chapel. 

2. ¥est Hall - (Cost ^5^8l5*90) Used for housing male students 
and their dean and his family. A chapel is also provided. 

3. Maple Hall - (Cost $214.2,298.13) The women's dormitory. Space 
is provided for the dean's living quarters and a chapel. 

U. Industrial Arts Building - (Cost $13> 176.89) Printing, 
agricultiire, woodcrafts, etc. are taught, with laboratory facilities 
for practical experience. 





101 


5# Auditorium - (Cost l!?30,000,00) Used for physical education 
and religious services, 

6, Laundry and Repairs Shop - (Cost $9,800,95) First floor is 
used to take care of laundry for school family. Lower floor is used for 
maintenance work, 

7, Cafeteria - (Approximate cost jJSO^OOO) This building houses 
the kitchen and dining room, 

8, East Hall - (Cost $10,38U,7U) Housing for married students, 

9, Pump House - (Cost |1,000) Supplies water for the school, 

10, Milk Processing Building - (Cost $3,915*97) Used for pasteur¬ 
izing and bottling milk for the school family, 

11, Skating Rink Shack (Cost $318,92). 

12, Part of MacltLne Shed - (Appro:dLmate cost ($1,000) Used for 
storage of school equipment, repair shop, and farm superintendent's 
office, 

13* Custodian*s Cottage - (Cost $1,800), 

111, Grade School Building - (Cost 17,737*27). 

No exemption was asked for seventeen cottages and the land on 
which they were located, approximatel 5 r sixteen hundred acres of land, 
and all industrial or comrfiercial projects presently being operated or 
planned for the future. The Lacombe Municipal District #6U levied and 
collected approximately $5,000 in additional taxes for 1950 before an 
opportunity was afforded to present the private bill which provided the 
necessary alterations in the charter of incorporation,^

As mentioned previously, the administration of S. E* Eietz was 
notable for the improvement in the physical plant. Bietz's successor, 
Henry T. Johnson, set as his goal the establishment of industries which 
would not only stabilize the econoipy of the school but would also pro¬ 
vide the student with an opportunity to learn a useful vocation while 
helping him defray a portion of his school expenses. Johnson’s purpose 
was the securing of a more adequate fulfillment of one of the objectives 
of Canadian T&iion College to vjhich reference has already been made: 

To emphasize the dignity of labor and the training of each 
student in a vocation, trade or profession with sufficient skill 
to earn a livelihood. 

One of Johnson’s first moves was to secure permssion from the 
Board of Management to erect a new laundry and press building at a cost 
of $2U>000. During his term of administration, Johnson has attempted to 
promote five industries: a commercial laundry, a commercial press, a 
2,000-acre farm, a bookbindery, and an upholstered furniture factory. 
These industries will be considered separately. 

The Laundry * The laundxy department has always been necessary in 
order to meet the needs of the resident students in the dormitoiy. Table 
XVII reveals the fact that it has not been a profitable department. For 
the twelve-year period from 19 lj-l 4 .“ 1956 , a profit was shown only for the 
I 9 UU-I 4.5 school terra. During the remainder of the period, the yearly 
losses have ranged from approxiiriately $191 to |U,68i;. During the 1950-51 
and 1951-52 school terns, the commercial income was practically nil

because of the municipal tax problem. At the close of the 19:?5-56 school 
term, the commercial aspect of the laundry was discontinued entirely. 

The financial statement covering the period from July 1, 1936, to March 
31, 1937, reveals the fact that the laundry operated at a gain of 5591*19^^ 
Figure 10 is a graphical representation of the profit and loss record of 
the laundry department at Canadian Union College during the period 19UU-56. 

The Press . Table XVIII gives the profit and loss record for a 
twelve-year period of the comiuercial press wtiich has been in operation 
for a number of years. For the four-year period from l9UU-Uy^ the press 
showed a gain. However, for the eight-year period from 19U6-56 this 
department has lost consistently, with losses ranging as high as 59^000. 
Figure 11 presents graphically these profits and losses for the period 
from 19UU-56. The financial statement of Canadian IMion College for the 
nine-month period ending March 31, 1937, shows an operating loss for the 
press amounting to $8,603.U5*^'^ 

The Farm . The two-thousand acre farm has a better record than 
either the laundry or the press. For the twelve-year period from 19UU- 
1936, the farm has shoxm a profit during seven of these years. (See 
Table XIX) In spite of this improved record, the farm shows a net operat¬ 
ing loss of S 36 I for the twelve-year period. From July 1, 1936, to March 
31 , 1937 , the farm shows a loss of $3,3)42.2223 Figure 12 represents 
graphically these profits and losses.

Statement for the period ending March 31, 1937, p. 17*

The Bookbindery * The bookbindeiy is a direct result of the Arts 
and Crafts course on the Alberta high school curriculiim. During the 
1951-52 school term, John Bidulock, one of the students enrolled for 
this course, was introduced to the art of bookbinding by Lloyd M. Cowin, 
chairman of the industrial arts department at Canadian Union College. 
Bidulock asked for and secured permission to explore the possibilities 
of a commercial bookbindery. ViS.th only the minimum amount of equipment, 
this department has finally reached the place where it is one of the 
better-equipped bookbinderies in Western Canada. The latest piece of 
equipment (May, 1957) has been an oversewing stitching machine -which is 
one of three such machines in use in Canada. Although this industry 
has operated at a loss thus far, it is hoped that the addition of the 
stitcher will cut down costs and permit the bookbindery to at least break 
even.

Table XX reveals the losses sustained by the bookbindery during 
the first five years of its operation. The administration of the col¬ 
lege is optimistic regarding the chances of the bindery showing an 
improved financial status in the near future.

The furniture factory * The newest industry at Canadian lAiion 
College is also the most promising one from a financial standpoint. 

There is eveiy indication that it will continue to show reasonable gains. 
During its first two years of operation, it showed losses slightly in 
excess of six thousand dollars. During this same three-year period of 
1953-56, the output jumped from a value of slightly better than forty 
thousand dollars to over one hundred ninety thousand dollars. For the 
first nine months of the 1956-57 school term, the commercial income was 
over one hundred eighty-nine thousand dollars.

Figure 1 L|. represents graphically the profit and loss record of 
the furniture factory during the three-year period, 1953 - 56 . For the 
nine-month period ending March 31 ^ 1957 > the furniture factory showed 
a gain of $ 8 , 939 * 60.29 

Table X^CEI summarizes the operating loss (or gain) exclusive of 
gifts and grants, gifts and grants, and net operating gain or loss for 
the twelve-year period, 19 i|.U- 56 . During this twelve-year period, the 
total operating loss exclusive of gifts and grants, was $286,037, or 
an average of $ 23,836 per year. After subtracting the gifts and grants 
for this same period, the total net operating loss was reduced to $Ii. 9 , 5 ll 
or an average of $li, 126 . Figure 13 is a graphical representation of the 
comparison between the operating loss exclusive of gifts and grants and 
the net operating loss inclusive of gifts and grants. Figure 16 com¬ 
pares graphically the gifts and grants for the twelve-year period. 

Much of the loss for this twelve-year period results from the 
losses sustained in the instructional department. This fact is sub¬ 
stantiated by Table XXIII, which lists the instructional income, ex¬ 
pense, and loss for the same twelve-year period. The total instructional 
loss, based on the figures contained in this table, is $ 203 , 758 . Figure 
17 represents graphically the information contained in Table XXIII. 

The tendency for current student accounts to increase is shown 
by Table XXIV. By the close of the 19 UU-U 5 school term, current student

accounts receivable were Twelve years later, current student 

accounts receivable had risen to For the same period, old 

student accounts receivable increased from ’'■>li;,601 to ^kh}999» Tlriis 
information regarding current and old student accounts is represented 
graphically in Figure l8. 

During the eight-year period from 19ii8-56, tne value of labor 
furnished to students at Canadian Union College has almost doubled. 

Tins fact is revealed by the figures given in Table XIV, which gives 
the value of student labor for the 19U8-U9 school term at slightly over 
$U6,000. During the 1955-56 school term, the total amount of student 
labor furnished by the various departments had risen to $89,69ii. Figure 
19 depicts the variations in the amount of labor rornished to students 
for the 1914-8-56 school terms. 

In Table XaVI a summary of income, expenditure, and net gain 
(including capital gain) is given for the 19iiU-56 period. The same 
information is represented graphically in Figure 20. 

Table XXVII deals with the assets, liabilities, and net worth of 
Canadian Union College for the twelve-year period, 19iil4--56. During this 
period the assets tripled in value, the liabilities are over six times 
as much, and the net worth has tripled. As of June 30, 1956, the pres¬ 
ent worth of Canadian Union College stood at §80]4.,76l. Figure 21 depicts 
graphically the fluctuations in assets, liabilities, and present wortn 
for the same twelve-year period. 

The most recent innovation in the scholastic program at Canadian 
Union College occurred in 1953^ when the Board of Management gave

instruction for an eleraentaiy teacher training course to be added to the 
college division# This action was the direct result of an increasingly 
large number of untrained individuals who were being hired to serve as 
teachers in the Seventh-day Adventist cuurch schools across Canada, With 
the exception of Alberta, there appears to be little attempt made to in¬ 
sure the hiring of trained, qualified teachers for private schools. Be¬ 
cause of this laxity, the educational superintendents campaigned for and 
finally secured pemission to institute one-year elementary teacher train¬ 
ing programs at both Oshawa Missionary College and Canadian Union College, 
The entrance requirements are basically the same as those required 
by the University of Alberta, The curriculum parallels rather closely 
that of the University of Alberta and the same textbooks are used in 
several of the courses.

In the high school division a fairly diversified program is 
offered. Besides offering the regular grade DC program for the junior 
high school, instruction was provided in thirty-eight courses of the 
Alberta high school program. These courses have a total credit value of 
179. Another feature of the opportunities offered by the school is the 
provision for the earning of high school credit through private instruc¬ 
tion in music, particularly piano and band. A growing number of students, 
each year, are earning credit through the avenue of the Royal Conserva¬ 
tory of Music of Toronto. In addition to the regular curriculum of the 
Alberta Department of Education, each student is expected to take one 
unit of Bible each year to a minimum of three.

The cost of securing an education at Canadian Union College had 
also risen. Whereas in 1909 the estimated cost of a full year at the 
Alberta Industrial Academy was set at §112.50 plus one and one-half 
hours of work each day, by the 1953-56 school term the expenses had risen 
to almost §800 per year. 

During the forty-nine years that have elapsed between 190? and 
1956, only eleven men have served as administrators. The names of these 
men and their terms of service are found in Table XXVIII. 

Table XXIX shows the number of graduates of Canadian Iftiion College 
for the years 1906-1956. Table XXX lists the vocational choices of 595 
graduates from Canadian Ikiion College. This list includes only the 
graduates and does not provide for the scores of students who attended 
Canadian Union College for a year or more and then transferred to another 
Seventh-day Adventist institution before graduation. 

Figure 22 represents graphically the changing enrollment at 
Canadian Inion College from 19Uii--56. Table XXXI gives the enrollment 
distribution by grade for the same twelve-year period and Table XXXII 
analyzes this enrollment on the basis of geographical distribution. 

Table XJDCIII breaks down the salary expense and the total col¬ 
lege and academy ejq)ense to an average per student per month basis.

Total 


Information contained in this table is compiled from the reply to a questionnaire submitted to the 
Alberta Conference of Seventh day Adventists, March, 1957. 






















































This table shows that the average salaiy per month has risen from $128 
in 19iiU-U5 to $269 in 1955-56. In other words, the average monthly 
salary per teacher has more than doubled. Over the same twelve-year 
period, the salaiy e:q)ense per student per month has risen from $6 to 
$ 13 . 15 # Over the same interval the average monthly college and academy 
expense has gone from $2,8ll to $9,Oli9# This phase of operating has 
more than tripled in cost. The college and academy total expense per 
student per month, which was $11.91 in 19l|U-U5, stood at $27*59 by the 
end of the 1955-56 school terra. 

Table XXXIV gives the annual enrollment at Canadian Union College 
during the first forty-nine years of its operation. In recent years 
there has been no noticeable trend in the enrollment figures. 

At the date of writing (May, 1957) Seventh-day Adventist church 
schools are operated at Lacombe (three rooms), Peoria, Belloy, Edmonton, 
Calgary (2 rooms), and \^telaw. Pertinent information regarding these 
schools is contained in Table XXXV# 

At various times Seventh-day Adventist schools have been operated 
at Stettler (I91ii-17) and Erskine (19^5-52)# The Edmonton school was 
opened in 19U2 and has operated continuously as a single-room school. If 
present plans materialize, a new two-room school will be ready for 
occupancy by September, 1957# Calgary*s school was started in 19U5 and 
in I 95 I; a second room was added mth the construction of a modern school 
building.

Summary 


In this tlfiird chapter, a brief survey has been made of Seventh- 
day Adventist education in Canada, In keeping with the title, more 
detail has been given where Alberta is concerned. Especially is this 
true as far as Canadian Union College is concerned, since it represents 
the major effort by Seventh-day Adventists in Canada to provide a church- 
sponsored educational centre for their youth. 

A number of figures and tables have been included to better 
acquaint the reader with the facts presented* Those tables and figures 
dealing with the financial operation of Canadian Union College are in¬ 
tended to show that, from a purely economic standpoint, operation of 
private schools is far from being a profitable venture.

CHAPTER IV 


THE CHURCH, THE STATE, AND PUBLIC EDUCATION 

Before attempting to formulate any conclusions based on the his¬ 
tory of Seventh-day Adventist education in Canada and the fundamental 
philosophy of Seventh-day Adventists regarding the true function of 
education, it will be advantageous to consider in some detail the ques¬ 
tion of whether or not the public school can safely invade the realm of 
religious education. As in most questions involving the public int^erest, 
the tv/o extreme groups are the most vocal in expressing their views. On 
the one hand we find those who are insistent that the public school recog¬ 
nise its responsibility in providing a religious backdrop for the secular 
education which it provides for its pupils. Ranged against this group vre 
find the advocates of a strictly secular education in the public school, 
this group basing its case on the doctrine of Separation of Church and 
State« 

In this fourth chapter, it is the purpose of the author to discuss 
such pertinent iopics as the case for and against the inclusion of reli¬ 
gious education in the public schools and the arguments for end those 
against state aid for private schools. This discussion will serve as a 
foundation for the summary and conclusions which will te presented in 
the final chapter. 

The question of religious and secular education revolves about 
the larger question, ’’'ii^ihat is the real purj^ose of education?” To many 
people there are tvjo main realms with which education can properly deal— 



the secular and the spiritual realm. According to the Seventh-day 
Adventist philosophy of education, it has been shown that Adventists 
believe it is dangerous to tiy and separate the two phases. 

President Killian of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology 
supports this view in these words: 

An institution which embraces general as well as professional 
education must give attention to man's spiritual life—to the place 
of religion in man's history in contemporary society, and in the 
life of the individual.^ 

The founders of the public school system did a thorough Job and 
the resulting product of their untiring efforts to place education 
within the reach of all has made a notable contribution to the demo¬ 
cratic pattern of living. It is felt by some educators, however, that 
the evolution of the public school has not been entirely symmetrical. 
Periodically, there is a concerted movement for the evaluation of the 
contribution made by the state-supported school system toward the goal 
of educating the whole person, thereby producing a symmetrical citizen 
well equipped to discharge his responsibility to the democratic com¬ 
munity of which he is a part. This concern is reflected in such a 
statement as: 

But though cTirricula have multiplied, though school life is now 
a composite of formal and informal learning and experience, has 
public education reached its avowed goal to educate the whole 
person?^ 


^President Killian, "Education of the Spirit," Annual Report , 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology , October 195h* 

%esner Fallaw, "On Educating the 1/Jhole Person," School and 
Society, LKXH (New York: The Society for the Advancement of Education, 
Inc. April 30, 1935), p. 132.

Fallaw’s verdict is_, ''It has not • • •" 3 ^ and then he sets out to 
discover the wealmess w'.Tich has prevented the public school of today 
from successfully accomplishing its avowed purpose of producing a well- 
rounded personality: 

Obviously there can be no satisfactory education of the whole 
person until the person is made whole. This job is not accom¬ 
plished by means of a dissecting process that focuses on the mind 
in the public school classroom, on the emotions in the psychia¬ 
trist’s office, on the body in the gymnasium, on the ’’spirit” in 
home and church.h 

This practice of isolating and departmentaliang functions and 
activities wliich appear to be complementary and part of a unified whole 
leads Fallaw to conclude: 

Each of these settings is needed, each should pursue its special¬ 
ization, but all together hardly serve to make a person whole, Vdien 
different educational agencies, using a series of different settings, 
concentrate on various segraents of a person, they make it difficult 
or impossible for hira to get himself together, to see himself whole. 
Not only so because American education systems generally omit other 
than superficial attention to the basic needs of belief, religion, 
and faith, youth are actually being educated to view as unimportant 
the core of hman existence.-" 

The consequence of attempting to separate spiritual development 
from the purely secular phase of growth is also referred to by Lewis 
Mumford: ’’The segregation of the spiritual life from the practical life 
is a curse that falls irapartially upon both sides of our existence,

The ver^r presence of a Seventh-day Adventist parochial school 
system would appear to signify the faj.lure of the public school to meet 
the demnds made upon it by Seventh-day Adventists* 

The other side of the problem facing the supporters of parochial 
schools, and consequently Seventh-day Adventists, is the presence of a 
school of thought which sees no need for such schools and even suggests 
possible legislation to cui’tail thejr activities. This pressure group 
sees the evolution of society producing an era ?/hich has no need of 
the religious background once considered an essential part of the comr- 
plete personality. Conurad Moehlraan is an advocate of the theory which 
states; 


The old religious synthesis which spread tlu^oughout Christian 
Europe is being replaced by an emerging synthesis where science 
will determine decisions, lone are particular revelation, and a 
peculiarly inspired book, . . « ' 

The harmful effect of the parochT.al school is described by 

Moehlman j 


The school which attempts to narroiv the thinking of its students 
by indoctrinating them with particular theories in politics, 
economics, sociology, or religion or, what amounts to the same 
thing, refuses them the liberty of thought now enjoyed by the 
scientist, commits the unforgivable sin of making young men and 
women mentally old before their time, and should be classed as 
an academic monastery, not as an educational institution.^ 


"^Conrad H. Moehlman, The Church as Sducator , (New York: Hinds, 
Hayden, and El.dridge, 19ii7)> preface, p. iii* 

^Ibid.. p. 83. 











To counteract what he considers the -unfavorable results of 


parochial schools, Moehlman suggests possible state intervention 
through appropriate legislation: 

It may seem necessary for the purpose of insuring adequate 
education for citizenship, to modify our compulsory education 
laws so that children are in public schools at least through 
grade eight.^ 

The present status of Seventh-day Adventist parochial education 
and the prospects for future advancement or retrogression constitute 
the denominational answer to Moehlman’s verdict: 

Both Protestantism and Catholicism opposed the development of 
public education ... by promoting the paroc'tiial schools. The 
puny efforts of the Protestant groups soon came to grief and what 
remains of the Protestant parochial school today has little meaning 
for . . . youth. 

Is it true that: 

. . . the new synthesis has won the war in iumerican education 
against ecclesiastical reaction in both the university and the 
public school areas. 

or is it more accurate to describe the situation thus: 

The public school today is on the defensive. Its secularity— 
frequently caUed *’godlessness*^ is attacked by many church 
spokesmen.

school presents a real problem to many educators today, Henry P. Van 
Dusen, President, lAiion Theological Seminary, expresses his views in 
these words: 

Our topic marks the meeting point of two of the most powerful and 
persistent concerns of the human spirit; the enterprise of education , 
dedicated to the quest for Truth, in the confident assurance that it 
is Truth which sets men free; and the heritage of religion , declaring 
its knowledge, not of all Truth, but of the ground and principle of 

Truth.13 

Van Dusen suggests the impossibility of trying to separate these 
two goals of human existence when he continues: 

However these two concerns—education and religion—may differ, 
however far apart their paths may at times appear to diverge, they 
confess a common allegiance to a single sovereign. Truth. It is 
obvious that if each rightly apprehends that sovereign and its 
commands upon them, they should find themselves yokemates, fellow 
warriors in a common battle against ignorance and error.^ 

That this concept of religion and education working together for 
the commen end. Truth, is an ideal and not necessarily the actual result 
is admitted by Van Dusen: 

By the same token, if there be strain or misunderstanding between 
education and religion, it must be basically because of divergent 
conceptions of Truth, whether that divergence be overt or hidden. 

To suggest that the relation of religion and education has not 
always been an altogether happy one, that the association of these 
two great interests in their joint concerns for the preparation of 
youth for life has not always been, especially in these latter years, 
an easy and cordial partnership, is to state the obvious. 


^^an Dusen, ’•'/Jhat Should Be the Relation of Religion and Public 
Education," Teachers College Record , (New York City: Teachers College, 
Columbia University, October, ±95h), P* 1* 










:i!.o 

Van Dusen’s appraisal of the present relationship between religion 
and education is expressed in the following statement: 

Indeed, I think ue may say that the two most obvious—and most 
important—features of tVie present situation with respect to our 
topic are Just these: (l) increased concern for the role of religion 
in education, cuid (2) confusion and pncertainty as to the rightful 
relation of religion and education. 

There are many critics of the movement to combine religion and 
education. In reply to these critics. Van Dusen advances these arguments: 

To the "uestion, why should education be concerned viith religion 
at all? 

1. The first is the recognition that religion has been and is 
one of the most widely prevalent, persistent, and powerful forces 
in the life of humanity—in all ages, among all peoples, at all 
stages of cultural development. Tie speak of three foundation stones 
in the structure of society as famliarly, as inevitably, as ue 
assume the three R*s at the base of education. They are home, school, 
and church .... To be unaware of religion's force in life and to 
lack some luiderstanding of its variations, history, development, and 
significance is to be vrithout one of the data for intelligent huraan 
living^ yet that is an illiteracy which the great bulk of the oncoming 
generation in our land must confess. 

2. More specifically, in the society of which we are irrjmediate 
heirs—both V/estern civilization in general and American culture .in 
particular—the Judeo-Ghristian religion has been probably the most 
pervasive and influential single formative influence upon its 
literature, .its art, its philosophy, its history .... 

3* Religion has to do idLth the most elemental, the most universal, 
and, .in the end, the most iraportant issues of huraan eid-stence—its 
origin, its nature, its mea,ning and purpose, its destiny, especially 
with the determinative and .inescapable events which mark and mould 
each person's life—birth, love, parenthood, death . . . 















Van Dusen considers it liighly undesirable and i:ell-nigh unthinlc- 
able that any boy or girl should have passed through the process of 
education for life vjithout having had the opportunity of becouiing well 
acquainted vjith the Bible which he describes as ’’the noblest collection 
of literature in the English tongue. 

The Committee on ^feekday Religious Education^ Department of 
Christian Education, Canadian Council of Churches approaches tliis problem 
of the inter-relation of religion and education in much the same way: 

In the history of Canada the relation of religion to education 
has been of recurring interest and .importance. From the tL. e of 
the earliest settlements, religion has played an important pc..rt in 
the foundation and growth of the public schools, and today, after 
a period in which public education tended to become secularized, 
there are in progress nuraerous projects w,liich attempt to make 
religion once again an .integral part of education. Not only the 
clergyraen but educators, editors, and statesmen are stressing the 
fact that an important element is lacking in a purely secular 
education and that the religious motive for character and conduct 
must have a rightful place. There is a grovjing feeling that we 
cannot lay claira to being a Christian country unless we seek by 
every mean 
cliildren.^ 

In tnis same pamphlet, the committee answers those critics who 
maintain that the task of religious instruction is properly the function 
of only the church and the home, .-.hile adriiitting that the home and the 
church are very important agents in the religious education of the child, 
this statement is made: 


in our power to pass on the Christian heritage to our

The school plJ^ys a vital part in the child’s attitudes and sense 
of values. If the school gives little place to religious teac'ning, 
then the caild quite naturally assumes that religion is not an 
integral part of iiis mental development. Too often it is not V7hat 
the teacher and the school say in a positive way that determnes a 
child’s attitude to religion but what they neglect to say.^^ 

This same source refers to the Bible as ’’the one book which more 

than any other has deterrained the cultural pattern and values which we 
01 

cherish in Canada.” 

In the early part of I 9 UI 4-5 the Committee on Education of the 
Canadian Youth Commission decided to obtain a representative estimate of 
how well Canadian schools were meeting the needs of her youth. To secure 
the necessary iniCormation a questionnaire was prepared by the Committee 
on Education. The advice of experts in the field of sampling was sought 
so that there would be as little chance as possible for the results to 
be biased by unequal distribution by sex, by province, or by residence. 
The age group tested was from fifteen to twenty-four years of age. 

One of the questions (23a) was worded as follows: 

It is held by some people that religious training shouJ.d be a 
part of everyone’s education. Do you agree?22 

Out of 1167 young people who ansvjered this question, 363 answered 
”yes,” 175 answered ”no,” and 12h registered ’’don’t Imow” or no answer

given*, Thus almost seventy-five per cent felt the.t religious training 
should be included in everyone*s educationo 

In part (b) of this same question, a set of seven methods ■V7as 
suggested as to how more religious training co^-ild be prov 3 -ded. Out of 
these seven methods, onl;^’- two methods sec^ired more positive than nega¬ 
tive support. These two methods v/ere (1) "Conduct Bible reading and 
prayer in school," with a poll of 169 votes for and lij2 against, and 
(2) "Provide a course for the teaching of religious principles and 

23 

their relation to life" which drew 136 "yes" votes and 73 '*no" votes. 

A list of reasons was given for attending school and the young 

people were asked to choose one or more than one reason they considered 

most important for attending school. First place was taken by the 

reason: "Help us to think clearly on the problems of life." In second 

place was this statement i "Helps us to understand modern society and 

Plj. 

the responsibilities of a citizen,"* 

^i^hen asked what they would have liked to have had more or better 

instmction in, the young people gave fourth place to this answer: 

**l/iore instruction in facts and problems of liJCe, more moral guidance, 

25 

religious training, a philosophy of life, character training." 

After considering the choices by which the young people thought 


23

2h ‘

25 


Ibid. 




these objectives could be best ocliieved, the three methods receiving 
most support were: 

1. Provide a course for the teaching of religious principles and 
their relation to life. 

2. Introduce religious principles incidentally in the teaching 
of courses like English and social studies. 

3 . Teach Bible History as a course^ or part of a course. 

In sumiTiarizing the results of the survey^ the follovTing corament is 


made: 


It may be assuiaed . . . that . . . young people believe that 
there is a relationship between sound character and religious 
teaching. They seem to feel, too, that the Job is not being well 
done now since the methods listed are those of both the church and 
the school. This constitutes a very definite challenge to all con¬ 
nected with education in any form to do better if we are to expect 
the young people of the nation to be endued vjith the unselfishness, 
high courage and idealism which will be required of them during the 
next twenty-five years.27 

Those xfno were responsible for conducting the survey and for 
tabulating the results were impressed with the need of instilling in 
youth today a sense of comradeship t^dth other youth as they Journey 
together down the road of lifei 

Putting it in the highest possible terms, a man’s character is 
the quality of his comradeship on the x-jay. The less he is aware of 
the goal to which he is striving and of the qualities of good 
comradeship, the more negative and sterile his character is likely 
to bej conversely, the more his imagination is seized by the sense

'j 








155 


of pilgrimage, of its direction and purpose, and the more he is 
governed by the etliics of comradeship, the finer by all human 
standards his character becomes 

The members of the Canadian Youth Comriiission make this recom¬ 
mendation in regard to the achieving of tlrls sense of comradeship and 


pilgrimage: 


The ritual, the literature, the hymnody, even the architecture 
of the religious bodies of .estern civilization are splendidly adapted 
to inspiring and maintaining the sense of pilgrimage and comradeship; 
that indeed has been the function of organized religions throughout 
history (no matter how badly that function may have been fulfilled at 
times). And because so many people in o'or day won’t go near the 
churches, a great deal of character training doesn’t get done.^^ 

In this last statement we find the basic reason for a good deal 
of the present-day agitation to include religious education in the 
curriculum of the public school. The church has sometpi-ng to contribute, 
it is felt, in the field of tradition, ritual, literature, hymnody, and 
architecture. Taken separately and together these phases of religious 
culture offer a rich heritage wliich tends to promote this sense of 
ccmradesliip and pilgriraage. Since the church no longer touches the 
lives of many of our youth the comfnission feels that the school may 
have to step into the breach and perform a double function—spiritual 
as well as seculLar: 

But the answer must be found. Youth says better ways must be 
devised. The schools have alx^ays assigned vjith the home and the church 


^‘ ^Ibid ., p. 37*

a fair share of the responsibility for character building. It may be 
that in the future they ■will have to do more in religious training as 
well .30 

The Canadian Youth Commission extended its survey to secure the 
cross-sectional opinion of both the Protestant and Catholic churches. 

In general, the Protestant vieigpoint -was that the teaching of biblical 
knowledge should be universally adopted if the foundation facts and the 
meaning of our Christian heritage are to be given to our children. In 
general, religion •was considered as a subject to take its place on the 
school curriculum. The difficulty of pleasing the varying views of the 
different Protestant denominations was recognized: 

Some thought this would not work because of the difference in 
denominations. Others felt that instruction should be given where 
possible by clergy. However, there were some areas untouched in 
any way by the church and it was felt that biblical knowledge should 
be given in these cases through the schools.31 

The Commission report suggested that this religious teaching 
might take the form of a course in comparative religions. This, it was 
recognized, would call for specially qualified teachers who would of 
necessity have something more than facts from books to guide them in 
their teaching of this vital subject. 

The Catholic viewpoint has a distinct advantage over that of the 
Protestant group. It does not have to concern itself with divisions 
within its own group. The church speaks authoritatively and with one 
voice:

Ive introduce this topic by stating clearly and unequivocally, 
our belief in God and Eternity, of the existence in man of a soul 
raised to a supernatural order, and destined for eternal happiness 
with God. ... We hold that the prime aim and purpose of education 
must be to prepare man to serve God on this earth, and to be happy 
with Him in the next world.32 

Raymond A. Hhitney Jr. of Drevj University adds his plea for the 
inclusion of religion in the school curriculuia: 

Fortunately, there is a growing awareness of the importance of 
religion. Secularism has no longer the attraction for us that it 
once had. A depression, two world wars, and the threat of a third 
have done much to shake our confidence in the ability of man to 
fulfill his aspirations within the limits of earthly history. A 
belief in the inevitability of progress is losing its appeal, and 
there is a general recognition that technological and scientific 
progress without moral growth can produce chaos. There is a gro;d.ng 
dissatisfaction with the emphasis upon highly specialized knowledge 
alone, without at the same time undergirdling it with a thorough 
understanding of the great moral and spiritual values basic to our 

western civilization,^3 

VJhitney suras up the situation in these words: 

At the same time it is becoming apparent that any attempt to 
omit religion which has done so much to contribute to our art, 
music, and literature as well as to our political thinking is to 
make education at its best superficial.^4 

In discussing the results of a decline in religious interest, 
Wliitney injects another thought: 

A loss in religious faith creates a vacuum which may easily be 
filled by something else. Ivithin recent years it has sometimes been 
a belief in the principles of communism. It is difficult, if not 
impossible, for a man to remain neutral forever. In time he will

adopt some faith by which to live, be it a form of religion or 
atheism, democracy or communism. Since democracy itself is an 
expression of a spiritual ideal, it would seem wise not to weaken 
those forces that have given rise to that ideal and have sustained 
and supported it.83 

Harry Emerson Fosdick echoes Whitney’s concern at the danger of 
replacing a knowledge of Christianity with some of the dangerous faiths 
that are striving for the mastery of man’s soul today: 

Concern about this matter (religious illiteracy) especially in 
regard to our public schools, has been mounting rapidly. The 
present aspect of the world deepens this anxiety. All such move¬ 
ments as Fascism and Communism have creeds and confessions of 
faith, and exhibit all the symptoms of ardent religious missionary 
zeal. The only way to meet such faiths is with a faith; and if we 
. . . answer, ’’Faith in liberty and democracy I” the fact remains 
that this faith is rooted in a spiritual heritage, asserting the 
dignity and value of the human soul as the child of God .80 

In commenting upon the opposition to the introduction of religion 
into the classroom, Fosdick has this to say: 

Freud, for example, is proper education material, but to present 
Isaiah would be to lug in religion. The biography of Hitler is 
proper, but to present the life of Jesus woi^d call out protests 
against introducing religious instruction.-^' 

For the most part, this chapter has thus far been devoted to the 
purpose of shoirJing the growing interest in the introduction of religious 
education into the schools. Me shall turn our attention to the consid¬ 
eration of a question of paramoimt importance: ’’Should the public 
schools be expected to provide religious education for its pupils?”

From the discussion in Chapter I of the Seventh-day Adventist 
philosophy of education, it is quite evident that their views regarding 
the role of education are quite similar to those held by Fallaw, Mumford, 
Van Dusen, et al. The question that now requires clarification is this: 
Can this religious fimction of education be adequately supplied by the 
public school without violating the fundamental tenets of democracy? 

If the public school can furnish this service, what useful service is 
provided by the parochial schools of Seventh-day Adventists and others: 

Van Dusen frames the question thus: Can religion have a place 
in public education eithout contravening the basic laws of the nation?^^ 

Van Dusen holds that the answer is ’»yes” if the following five 
conditions are met: 

(a) The program in religion should be determined by the educa¬ 
tional authorities and conducted by persons appointed and certified 
by them. 

(b) Teaching of religion must meet the standards of objectivity 
and scholarly competence expected of every other subject. 

(c) The major religious traditions should be appropriately 
present. 

(d) No student should be required to come under instruction 
contrary to his or to his parents’ objections. 

(e) The teaching and practice of religion in public education 
should not be employed as an instrument of sectarian propaganda.39

Fallaw envisions the emergence of religion as an important sub¬ 
ject in the public school curriculum of the future when he asserts: 

The next fifty years may well see a new integration of knowledge 
taught in the classrooms of .uneilcan schools, the fruitage of the 
avjakened thinking and practices of educators who until now have 
kept education segmented and incomplete. 

In the National Education Association Journal of May, l93U^ there 
appeared the report of an interview with C. Martin, President of the 
National Council of the Churches of Christ. To the question, "How do 
you think public schools should deal with religion?” Martin answers: 

A committee statement received by the general Board of the 
National Council of Churches says: 

“We believe that the public school has a responsibility with 
respect to the religious foundations of our national culture. It 
can declare, as the state itself declares, that the nation sub¬ 
sists under the governance of God and that it is not morally autono¬ 
mous. It can acknowledge, furthermore, that human ethical and moral 
values have their ground and sanction in God. 

”The school can do much in teaching about religion, in adequately 
affirming that religion has been and is an essential factor in our 
cultural heritage.”^ 

In an editorial entitled “Religious Illiterates” which appeared 
in the October, IPSii^ issue of the Alberta School Trustee, A. G. Andrews 
comes out boldly in defence of more religious instruction in the public 
schools. Commenting on the charge that high school graduates are 
“religious illiterates,” Andrews asks this question:

If at the time of entrance to university, graduates are religious 
illiterates, is it not time that parents, school trustees and teachers 
look at religious education more seriously?h2 

Referring to the strong stand taken by the Roman Catholic Church 

in regard to religious instruction in their schools, Andrews goes on to 

say: 


The Roman Catholic Church is one church in Canada which maintains 
this relationship by the inclusion of religious education in the 
curriculum. Perhaps Protestants should take a leaf out of their 
book. Secular education, in order to be an effective instrument to 
uphold Christianity and combat Communism, must be built upon the 
solid foundation of the teachings of Christ, iiorld events seem to 
indicate that the people of the world are torn between the ideologies 
of Christianity on one side and Communism and Hitlerism (and there 
are still many followers of Hitler* s philosophy in the vjorld) on the 

other. 

Andrews sees the twin enemies of Communism and Hitlerism as being 
dedicated to the destruction of Christianity. Such a destruction, he 
maintains, can be achieved more thoroughly through an ideological victoiy 
than through the use of the hydrogen bomb. Andrews challenges school men 
to discharge their responsibility to their fellow citizens and especially 
to the children in this ideological warfare thus: 

In discharging this responsibility, should not more thought be 
given to the allocation of more time to the effective Bible teach¬ 
ing in our day schools? Are we not shirking much of our responsi¬ 
bility to our young people by sitting back and leaving this all 
important phase of education to the Sunday School and the home? 

Stirely it requires soraething more to be done in this direction than 
we are now doing if this damaging criticism of religious illiteracy 
is to be removed from our university students. And if Christianity

Pidgeon^ head of a comi'oission appointed to study religious education in 

Canadian public and secondary schools, in an address before the General 

Council of the United Church of Canada: 


The croxm of all education ought to be the development of moral 
character and the cultivation of a spirit of reverence and loyalty 
touard the sacred things of life. There is need of an inter-church 
comriiittee in each province to study tpp opportunities ifiich now exist 
for teaching religion in the schools. 

The Committee on 'Jeekday Religious Education, Canadian Council of 
Churches makes the following evaluation regarding the Canadian situation: 

Various laws in each of the provinces tell of the provision for 
religious services or instruction in the schools. ilLthough some 
provinces are not as generous as many xraiild like, nevertheless, if 
full use were made the regulations under the existing laws much 
more could be done.^^ 

The Ccsmiiiittee is optiraistic regarding the results ga.ined thus far 
as it continues: 

Vdiere advantage has been talcen of the provision of e>dLsting law, 
the response has been received enthusiastically by children, parents, 
teachers and school boards. Many of the fears concerning divisions 
wbj.ch might arise in the coriimunities have proved groundless. There 
have been few instances of parents malcing use of the ’’conscience 
clause” to excuse their children from the schoolroom during the 
period of religious exercises or religious teaching. Experience has

proved that Protestants can co-operate in selecting a course of 
study and in executing the religious instruction#^^ 

Table XXXVI provides a summary/' by provinces of the provisions by 
Ipw for recitation of the Lord’s Prayer, daily Bible readings, and 
religious instruction# It can be noted from the information contained 
in this table that in five of the ten provinces of Canada—Newfoundland, 
Quebec, Ontario, Alberta, and British Columbia—the recitation of the 
Lord’s Prayer is obligatory. In fo^or of the remaining provinces—Nova 
Scotia, New Brunsvdck, li»1anitoba, and Saskatchewan—such recitation is 
permitted. In the remaining province of Prince Sdward Island no specific 
ruling is made. Daily reading of the Bible is obligatory in six of the 
Canadian provinces and is permitted in the other four. Regarding relig¬ 
ious instruction, it is obligator^r in only three provinces, perraitted 
in three others, not permitted in three provinces, while in British 
Columbia elective credit may be gained through extra-mural study oj? the 
Bible, In the case of all provinces, however, there are ’’conscience 
clauses” whereby any parent may request that his child be excused from 
attendance at ary religious activity. 

In Newfoundland, Quebec, and Ontario, special courses are pro¬ 
vided for prospective teachers while enrolled at teacher-training 
institutions for the purpose of instructing them in the best methods 
of utilizing existing regulations governing re3.igious education in the 
public and secondary’" schools. (See pamphlet ’’Religious Education in 
the Schools of Canada”)

The School Act makes the folloviing provision for religious 
exercises and religious education in Alberta: 

/JLl schools shall be opened by the reading, without explanation 
or comTiient, of a passage of Scripture to be selected from those 
prescribed or approved for that purpose by the i-Iinister, to be 
followed by the recitation of the Lord's Prayer. 

Provided that any Board may, by resolution, dispense with the 
Scripture reading or the recitation of the Lord's Prayer or both. 

No religious instruction shall be permitted in any school from 
the opening of the school until one half-hour previous to its clos¬ 
ing in the afternoon, after which time any such instruction per¬ 
mitted or desired by the Board may be given. 

As mentioned in Chapter III, all schools in Nevjfoundland are 
operated by religious denominations. Of the other provinces. Prince 
Edvjard Island, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Manitoba, and British Colimibia 
make no provision for separate schools. In New Bininswick, however, there 
is in certain areas a gentlemen's agreement that Ptoman Catholic children 
attend cer-tain schools, while non-Romanists attend others, and the school 
board employs a teacher of the same faith as the children. 

The Comiiiittee on Weekday Religious Education, Canadian Council of 
Churches, offers six suggestions as to how weekday religious education 
can be promoted in the community by interested individuals: 

1. Study carefully the laws and regulations in your own province 
to see what is possible in the way of both religious exercises and re¬ 
ligious instruction and secure and study materials authorized for use.

2. Find out by inquiry at your denominational headquarters in 
the province and also from your provincial Minister of Education to 
what extent advantage is taken of existing regulations. 

3. Have a meeting called of all ministers in your community 
(including the Roman Catholic priest if there is no separate school) 
and e:Kplain carefully the regulations and familiarize the ministers 
ifith available materials. 

It. Lay out a plan for operation in the school or scuools by 
teachers and/or ministers and malce sure there is a fair division of 
responsibility. 

5. Have a deputation appointed to approach the local school 
board and make sure the deputation is carefully briefed and Imows 
all the answers before the meeting. 

6. Have a meeting mth the school teachers and e:Kplain the whole 
matter fully and sympathetically to them. Encourage them to give 
definite Christian instruction as far as regi.-G.ations pe nnit both in 
teaching the literature of the Bible and in their social studies. 

Help them, if possible, in tpe ways and means of conducting their 
opening religious exercises. 

If religious education were to be introduced into the public 
schools as suggested by the foregoing material contained in this chapter, 
the need for instituting a new phase of teacher education is ._uite 
apparent. In keeping mth the pressure being exerted for the inclusion 
of religious instruction in the public school curriculwa, there has been 
a growing realization that teachers will need to be equipped for this 
added responsibility. 

John G. Flowers has tliis to say in regard to the new problem 
facing teacher education: 


"^ ^Ibid ., p. 


20 . 






167 


The iimerican Association for Teacher Education has received a 
grant of $60,000 from the Danforth Foundation to finance a study 
of religion in teacher education.61 

The nature and scope of the proposed study is described thus: 

The committee recommends that the chief purpose of this study of 
teacher education and religion be to discover and develop ways and 
means to teach the reciprocal relation between religion andother 
elements in human culture in order that the prospective teacher, 
whether he teaches literature, history, the arts, science, or other 
subjects, be prepared to understand, to appreciate, and to convey 
to his students the significance of religion in human affairs. 

Essentially, then, the primary aim of the study is to deal 
directly and objectively with religion whenever and wherever it 
is intrinsic to learning experience in the various fields of stucjy. 
In no sense is it the aim of the study to stimulate individual 
committment or to encourage students to explore the resources of 
religion as a basis for durable convictions.62 

The teacher who emerges from this new type of teacher-education 
course will have a definitely ”new look.” Killian has this to say about 
the man or woman who will be in charge of the education of our children 
and youth: 

Exacting as the requirements for this kind of school man (or 
woman) are, and as hazardous as this whole work may prove if 
religious strife is aroused, I see this provision as basic to the 
proposed forward move for classroom education. Moreover, with 
about half of our elementary school-age children and adolescents 
of secondary school-age . • . outside the reach of organized 
religion—and therefore mainly under the non-religious influence 
of their homes—what agency other than the public and private 
schools may be expected to help students become whole persons. 63

As Killian so aptl2/' puts it, this nevj breed of person idll have a 
triple personality—he idll of neces. ity be ’’something of an educator, 
consulting psychologist, and a spiritual shepherd. 

The two 'orincipal methods for providing some form of religious 
instraction in the public schools are: (l) Bible reading (2) rsleased- 
time plan for religious instruction. 

Pfeffer lists these arguments for the released-tirae program: 

(1) The Traditional Arguments 

1. Demand of time for more and better religious education 
for youth. 

2. Short session of the Sunday church school does not 
give enough tliie. 

3. Religion must be identified in the child’s mind with 
weekday as well as Sunday life. 

It. To give every child a trulv complete ’’education for 
life,” he needs education in religion as well as in other 
subjects during weekday prograia. 

3. The church has a right to a fair proportion of the 
cl'lld’s weekday time. 

6. Weekday church schools enroll large numbers of children 
not reached by any other agency of religious education. 

(2) The Interfaith Argument: The released-time program would 
promote interfaith and interciltural haimony and understanding. 

(3) The Religious liberty Claim: This is the religious liberty 
arg'ument in reverse. The released-tirae proponents argue that refusal 
to release c’^lldren for religious education violates their religious 
liberty. 

(U) The cultural-plunalism argument. The practice of excusing 
Jewish children frora classes to participate in Jevlsh religious 
festivals and of Catholic children on Grtholic festivals is used as 
a precedent to justify the released-time prograia. 




roia. 






169 


(5) The Secularism-Communism Argument: The world today is 
engaged in a struggle between the forces of God-fearing democracy 
and atheistic Communism, The public school, as an organ of democ¬ 
racy and godliness, must do all it can to meet the threat of 
secularism and Communism. 

Edward S, Greenbaum states the case of released-time instruction 
in these words: 

The same law which permits absence for religious observance and 
music and dancing lessons permits absence to receive religious 
instruction.^^ 

After stating that approximately one-fourth of the children in 
the New York public schools were participating in the released-time 
program in 1932, Greenbaum makes this assessment: 

The released-time program is not perfect. Its most ardent 
supporters do not claim that it is. However, they are making 
an earnest effort to correct its imperfections, including those 
which might threaten the proper boundaries between church and 

state.-^7 

The case for public school responsibility for religious education 
could well be summarized at this point. Since we in the Western World 
consider ourselves to be Christian nations, we have a responsibility to 
perpetuate the religious aspect of our culture through the state- 
supported school system. Only in this way can a harmonious partner¬ 
ship between the home, the church, and the school be maintained and 
promoted. In no way should this recognition of the Judeo-Christian

heritage i-jlrLch has impregnated our cultural structure be considered a 
violation of the basic deraocratic doctrine of Separation of Cnurch and 
State, Rather, since democratic practice and Christianity have a 
common source, every agency available should l^^ork togetuer in establish¬ 
ing a world order based on the foundation stones of freedom, justice, 
and fair play. Since one of the prime objectives of a complete educa¬ 
tion is character-building, supporters of religious education in the 
public schools can see no reason why the greatest single force in the 
foming and maintaining of character should be deliberately omitted 
from the curriculum. 

The relatively?- short period of time elapsing between two world 
wars and the .imminence of a third global conflagration which threatens 
to utilize weapons of destruction unheai'd of before has caused educators 
to ponder their responsibility .in a world torn between conflicting 
ideologies. 

The failure of the church to stabilize the youth of this genera¬ 
tion has inspired educators to attempt to make up for this lack. The 
Bible, admittedly the source book of Chris'bianity and regarded by most 
scholars to represent the highest form of dng.lish .literature, is bs.ing 
recommended for a mors important place in the l.ife of the elementary and 
secondary pupil. Bible reading, without comment, coupled idth the 
recitation of the Lord’s Prayer, is becoming .increasingly common in 
public schools. Released-time religious instruction is already being 
offered in an increasingly large number of schools and has won a follo-tjing

among both laity and educators. Supporters of the inclusion of religious 
education in the schools maintain that only by talcing appropriate action 
can our schools disprove the charge that they are "godless” and are 
responsible for the production of "religious illiterates." 

Pfeffer sums up the case for public school responsibility for 
religious education in the following statement: 

(1) be are a religious people. 

(2) Religious education is necessary for the development of 
character. 

(3) Religion is the most important ttdng in human life. 

(U) The omission of religion from the curriculum is completely 
condemnatory .... If all subjects but religion are included in 
the curricoluiii, but religion is conspicuously omitted, the inevitable 
resLilt is that the child will be le^ to believe that religion is 
undesirable or at best uniiuportant.'^^ 


The Case Agains t Religious Ed ucation in the P ublic Schools . The 
opponents of religious education in the public schools base their argu¬ 
ments on the nature and. powers of the democratic state. This group 
maintains the view that to engage in any form of religious education is 
a contravention of the basic tenets of freedom. They regard freedom as 
an rdtimate goal of centuries of struggle and. they are loath to sacri¬ 
fice it even in what appears to be a cause which has many virtues to 
commend it, John Diefenbaker, national leader of the Progressive- 
Conservative party in Canada, long a stout defender of individual lib¬ 
erty, says:

The Freedom of the individual as we have it today is the result 
of many hundreds of years of struggle and progress • • • • 

Freedom was won by the assertion of the rights and dignity of 
the individual against the power of the state to the point where 
government or the authority of the state could no longer take a 
short-cut across the liberty of the individual * * ^ » 

Governments are composed of human beings who are often subject 
to considerable lobbying by well-meaning pressure groups. Un^jittingly 
a government may, although ostensibly a supporter of the principles of 
democracy, be guilty of legal enactments which are basically a denial 
of the democratic ideal. Diefenbaker emphasizes this danger when he 
asserts: 


Governments are now subject to such pressures that even with 
the best of motives and benevolent intentions the terrrotation to . 
cut across the liberty of the individual is almost irresistible. 

The group which opposes religious education in the schools does 
not oppose it simply because of an opposition to religion itself but 
because it considers religious education in the public schools a viola¬ 
tion of the fundamental principle of democracy—^the principle of 
the freed ora of the individual to act and believe in his aim v/ay as long 
as he does not interfere with the rights of his fellow men. It mainr- 
tains that although democracy is a natural concomitant of Christianity, 
to provide religious education in the public schools is to dery demo¬ 
cratic freedom. In Diefenbaker *s ?rords ;

zine, (Edmonton; Douglas Printing Co., lilay, 1952), p. 16.

173 


The concept of Freedom is eternal. Vigilance to preserve it 
for the individual is equally eternal. History shows that there 
have always been men who, by design or otherwise, would destroy 
or deny Freedom. 


Our concept of Freedom is founded on the Chjristian teaching 
that every human being is endowed with a . . . personality, which 
is sacred in the eyes of God. The consequence of this concept is 
that the State, if Freedom is to be maintained, must be the servant 
of the individual, rather than the individual being the servant of 
the State 


’*But,” say the supporters of religious education in the schools, 
’’since Christianity is a natural adjunct of democracy, should it receive 
adequate attention in our curriculum?” The opposition group maintains 
that a man’s religion or lack of it is strictly a mp.tter of conscience 
and the State has no legitimate right to interfere. Speaking of the 
group of citizens who hold this view, Pfeffer makes this observation: 

This group does not disregard or minimize the importance of 
religious education, but recognizes that the use of the public 
school system to promote religious education v/ould compromise 
the principle of the separation and would thus impair religious 
freedom. 

Dieferibaker attempts to define freedom: 

Tihat is Freedom? It cannot exist without Freedom of Religion, 
Speech, Press, and Association, Freedom is difficult of defini¬ 
tion. It does not mean the right to do the thing tliat each of us 
will* it does not mean license which is the abuse of Freedom. 

Freedom is not the right to do wrong, but it does imply the right 
to b e vrrong, in the view of the majority, otherwise ^ere would never 
be Freedom of Speech, of the Press, and of Religion.

Supporters of .eligious education in the public schools have 
always insisted that teachers should strive to bring out a common denom¬ 
inator in all religious instruction. This reasoning appears valid and 
may seem easy of attainment but opponents of religious education in the 
public schools claim that a close scrutiny reveals the impracticability 
of such an attempt. This opposition group argues that it is impossible 
to find sui'ficient common ground to make a program of religious educa¬ 
tion feasible. 

The anti-religious education group finds fault with the two 
popular methods in use today—the reading of the Bible and religious 
instruction through the releassd-t.iras prograiii. Frederick Bby^ in his 
book ”The Development of Modern. Education” makes tliis observation: 

Another popular method and the only one to rece.ive the approval 
of the courts (U. S.) is the reading of the Scriptures in the 
classroom or the school assembly. The objection to tliis is that 
Catholics and Protestants do not agree on the translation to be 
used and Jews oppose the use of the New Testaiaent^ .as a cor sequence^ 
of the objections, pupils are not required to attend this exercise. 

Arthur Moehlman makes practically the identical observation: 

Despite the fact that nuirierous religious persuasions exist in 
tliis country, there is an insistent demand in many sections for the 
reading of the Bible in school. The edition selected is always the 
Protestant King James version wliich does not appeal to the Greek or 
Roman Catholics, to the Jews or to the other nuraerous Christian and 
non-Christian persuasions.^^

In the Twenty-third Yearbook, American Association of School 
Administrators, the practice of Bible reading in the public schools is 
summed up in the folloTd.ng quotation: 

Hence, because of the chaotic status of Bible reading in the 
public schools and because many doubt the religious significance 
for children of the perfunctory compulsory reading of Bible 
passages, especially without comment, it is quite obvious that 
Bible reading in the public schools in general cannot be relied 
on to provide the kind of spiritual undergirding our nation needs. ° 

Pfeffer states the attitude of Seventh-day Adventists toward 
Bible reading in the public schools in these words: 


. • • the Unitarians, Universalists, and Seventh-day Adventists 
as well as some lutheran and Southern Baptist groups, oppose 

The practice of released-time instruction has produced even more 

definite opposition. This opposition takes many forms and numerous 

reasons are advanced for the prohibition of religious education through 

the medium of released-time. The practice of releasing pupils during a 

certain period of the school day to attend classes conducted by their 

own church-appointed leaders is condemned unequivocally by Conrad 


Moehlman: 


>Jhen procedure to line ip the youngsters for their "religion” 
classes segregates—as Catholics, Lutherans, other Protestants, 
Jevjs, cultists, smaller sects, non-churchgoing pupils, a conscious¬ 
ness of religious cleavage is inevitable and baneful . . . The 
religious disunity of the proponents of dismissed time plans is 
one of the principal arguments against released time. Released

sessions are held in the schoolrooms, they often become catechism 
against catecnism.^S 

The supporters of religious education in the public schools do 
not feel it impossible to overcome the difficulty presented by the 
multiplication of denominations and creeds during the past hundred years. 
Nor do they recognize the difficult task of finding a staff of teachers 
competent in the sphere of religious education. Kandel refers to these 
difficulties in the following statement: 

... the major difficulties to the introduction of religious 
instruction, which usually implies instruction in the tenets of 
a religious denomination, are overlooked. Of these, the one that 
was most influential in the abandonment of specific religious 
instruction in the schools was the difficulty of meeting the claims 
of the various denominations. These have increased in number since 
the middle of the nineteenth century and have rendered the task more 
formidable than ever. The second difficxilty which cannot be over¬ 
looked is the fact that there is a lack of teachers competent to 
give religious instruction with the sincerity and devotion that are 
essential if such instruction is to succeed. 

There is, however, the alternative of turning this instruction 
over to non-school personnel. With this practice would come additional 
problems. Agnes E. Meyer has this to say about the invasion of the 
public schools by the churches: 


^^Conrad H. Moehlman, pp. 106, 112, 113.

School and Society , Volume LX:CEII, (New York: The Society for the 
Advancement of Education, Inc., June 23, 1951), p- 395. 











177 


So acute has become the question of sectarian religious instruc¬ 
tion in the public schools that our whole education system may yet 
be torn apart.70 

Meyer sees only one course to follow if the public school system 
is to be preserved: 

If we are convinced that cur public school system is worth pre¬ 
serving, we should persuade the churches to vithdraw from it. For 
the school system is the one broad area left in our country vihere 
religious intolerance could be overcome. It is the one place where 
the child is not primarily a Protestant, a Catholic, or a Jew . . .^^ 

There is a ri^ng tide of feeling that the school is shouldering 
a responsibility that rightfully should be borne by the home and the 
church when it becomes a partner in religious education. V. T. Thayer 
expresses this view when he says: 

There is no lack of opportunity for reli^ous education under 
family and church auspices outside school hours. But this oppor¬ 
tunity does not satisfy the religious authorities. VJhy? Because 
then it would not be possible to use the authority or the influence 
of the school to bring about attendance at the church school. 72 

The opposition group admit that the functions of the school and 
church should be complementaiy but claim that they are still unique. To 
attempt to fuse the secular and religious functions in the public school 
would be an invitation, so they claim, for each party to neglect their 
own peculiar responsibility. Thayer analyzes the situation thus;

Education Under Criticism, (New York: Prentice-Hall, Inc., IPSUT^

T. Thayer, "A Crutch for the Churches,T^ Education Digest , 
Yol. XVII, (Ann Arbor: The Education Digest, April, 1932), p. l5. 














178 


A final objection to religious instruction on released time follows 
from the fact that it encourages the school and the church alike to 
neglect their own unique functions in character education. Both 
institutions are charged i^jith tiiis taslc^^ but their opportunities and 
their contributions are not identical. 

Tliayer then makes an effort to set the limits beyond which he 
believes the character-education program of the school should not go: 

It is the responsibility of the school to educate for common 
values—honesty and fair play, truthfulness and temperance, self- 
control, responsibility, respect for personality, and the like. 

It is Thayer’s contention that these virtues can be taught better 
in the public schools if separated from sectarian teaching: 

To be sure, religious instruction can and often does promote 
these virtues, but there is reason to believe that they are 
strengthened rather than weakened where they are envisaged as 
independent of sectarian doctrine and theological dograa.'^^ 

Both the school and the church are viewed as s'nirking their 
privileges and duties when they unite to provide sectarian instruction 
through the facilities of the classroom. 

To the school Thayer directs these remarks; 

Insistence on religious instruction—either inside the school 
or outside but in co-operation with the school—as an indispensable 
condition of moral education—both detracts from the significance 
of the school’s unique function in the area of common valu.es and 
encourages teachers and administrative officers to shirk their 
responsibility to the school.

Thayer's coimsel to the church is just as pointed: 

On the other liand^ the churches weaken their educational pro¬ 
grams when they resort to the schools as a crutch. ;ere the churches 
now providing vigorous and vital religious education they would not 
need to call on the school to act as recruiting agents. And as long 
as they continue to lean on the schools they vdll be encouraged to 
postpone the day oi reform. 

To show that even eminent churchmen share the view that the church 
itself should rise to the challenge of the moment and not enlist the aid 
of the state-supported school, Thayer adds: 

A comment of Dr. John Haynes Holmes, pastor emeritus of the 
Community Church of New York, seems to sura up this final point; 

There is the church rusiiing to the state for aid and comfort in 
supporting educational activities which, for one reason or another, 
it cannot support itself. And here is the state taking over a 
h-ighly religious function of the church jji giving away a precious 
period of time, to be used in the church's interest. 

Thayer closes with this final challenge; 

IrJhat tne churches need, is to be free, militant, and united in 
the etliical and social aspects of their faith. .hen the ch'^ches 
meet this test, they will have no need of "released time."'^ 

Meyer makes a very similar assessment of the present situation 
and the challenge it presents to the church today when she observes: 

So many of our people yearn for spiritual gu.idance in this cold 
and confused era that they are beating a path to the door of every 
religious teacher whose faith still shines like a light midst the 
encircling gloom, hhat oun country needs is not more sectarianism 
in the public schools but more religion in the church.

In dealing \d.th the case for released tiine^ it liras suggested that 
since pupils were often excused from a portion of a school day at regular 
intei’vals in order to take dancing, music lessons, or to attend some 
siiiiilar activity there should be no valid reason for not e::.cusing them 
to attend classes in religion. Opponents of released time do not admit 
the similarity claimed. They contend that since only a relatively few 
parents ask for concessions on the grounds of music lessons, dancing 
lessons, etc., there is no major disturbance in the school routine, 
dowever, when larger or smaller groups are excused for sectarian reli¬ 
gious instruction, the sponsors are adamant that during the time the 
religious instruction is being given, no significant instruction be 
given by the teachers to the students who remain behind. This attitude 
represents a definite threat to the organized school program. As Thayer 
points out: 

There is a significant difference between the occasional excusing 
of children from school for a music lesson, a dancing lesson, a 
family festival, or even the observance of a religious holiday and 
releasing them for religious instruction. Religious instruction on 
released t.ime requires the public school to orga.nize its prograia so 
that c-'iildren whose parents request it may drop their regular school 
work v-jithout missing any vital instruction. No matter how few those 
who go may be, the children who remain, and the teaching staff, are 
expected to suspend all significant operations wliile their fellows 
attend the church school. 

Thayer contends that it is contrary to the rights of the child to 
use the public school to emphasize religious differences and thus

introduce the divisions which inevitably accompany the introduction of 
religious education in the classrooms 

Moreover, we should distinguish between the parent’s right to 
the use of the school for his own ends and the right of the clrild. 
each c’oild, irrespective of his background, is entitled to an 
education in the public schools free from the divisiveness wliich 
an emphasis on religious differences inevitably causes. Objective 
studies of released-time programs i.jave confirmed again and again 
their unfortunate effects on children. 

According to Thayer the only type of community where religious 
instruction works successfully is in ’’the religiously homogeneous com¬ 
munity.”'^^ Thayer quotes this claim regarding coraraunities vrnich have 
experiimented with re leased-time religious instruction. 

’’News items from cities w’-here there has been released time for 
religious education indicate that there is now more intolerance, 
discrimination, and disunity than previously existed in the public 
schools of those communities.^^ 

The committee who prepared the Twenty-t’nird Yearbook, ilraerican 
Association of School Administrators, makes the foliovdng appraisal of 
the released-time program: 

... a movement to fill what was believed by some to be a 
religious void has over a period of more than thirty years failed 
to gain a foothold of vital significance .... It is doubtful if 
the public school can rely on weekday classes in religious education 
on released time as the solution to its problems, of providing pupils 
wdth significant spiritual and ethical values.

Frederick dby, in his survey dealing nith the question of 
religious instruction in the public schools, makes a similar negative 
evaluation of the results gained by such instruction: 

It is a demonstrated fact that formalized teac ing of religion 
in the schools is not followed by an increase in church attendance 
or membership, or even by a high moral standard of life. To teach 
religion in the schools along with other subjects has invariably 
reduced it to the status of a formal study to be put aside and for¬ 
gotten along with aritlimetic, grammar, and history. Nothing but a 
fain and cheap veneer of Christianity has ever been imparted by this 
conventional approach. 

The fact that Seventh-day Adventists line up with the opponents 
of religious education is apparent from the following quotation: 

They (the views of those who oppose religious .insti'niction in 
the public schools) also reflect the position of Seventh-day 
Adventists, whose publication "Liberty” has for many years been 
in the forefront of the struggle for the strict separation of 
church and stats. 

From the foregoing quotations, it is quite apparent that there 
exists not an insignificant amount of opposition to the inclusion of 
religion in the public school. This opposition comes from both educators 
and church leaders. This opposition represents the view taken by the 
Seventh-day Adventist church. It is not a view based on opposition to 
religion as such, but an opposition due in large portion to an inherent 
belief in the principle of the Separation of Church and State. The views 
of tiiis opposition group are not always identical. President ICillian of

The Massachusetts Institute of Technology represents the extremist group 
of anti-religionists when he says in regard to our public schoolst 

Its institutional policy must be one of equal opportunity for 
all beliefs and outlooks, which means that it must express no bias 
toward any creed, but also that it m\ist not exhibit any bias toward 
religion itself. 

Admittedly, this view is representative of the extreme position 
among the opposition group. Fosdick, while still opposed to sectarian 
instruction, feels that the school cannot divorce itself entirely from 
the Christian cultural background which is such an essential part of 
Western civilization. He feels that we must declare our belief in and 
our loyalty to the basic ideals of Christianity. He sets forth the 


problem in these words: 

Nevertheless, an unsolved problem still remains. These moral 
values are not simply separate items to be imparted in isolation 
from one another, but rather, like a tree*s branches, they have 
stemmed from a great tradition, a cultural heritage, profoundly 
rooted in religious faith. As these values have actually developed 
in our Western World, they have involved not siiT5)3y isolated loy¬ 
alties, to this or that good aim, but a central loyalty to Qod.^^ 

Fosdick makes it clear that, in his opinion, the answer to this 
problem cannot be found in sectarian instruction during released time: 

The total result of all this, however, is far from satisfactory. 
Sectarian classes in the school building, voluntary though the 
attendance be, and the sending of separate groups to separate

churches for religious instruction on school time have resulted in 
splitting the school body and emphasizing creedal divisions between 
cliildren.^^ 

As alternatives to Bible reading and sectarian instruction during 
released time, Fosdick has a number of suggestions which, he believes, 
would introduce the students to the cultural heritage of G^iristianity 
without involving the school in any action which could produce divisive 
results. In this vray, Fosdick woifLd hope to gain the advantages claimed 
for released-tiime instruction in the public schools and still avoid the 
criticisms leveled at this mediim. Fosdick presents his alternative 
program as followst 

In teaching history, the part religion has played in shaping the 
ideals of our developing culture, and in influencing the course of 
mankind’s story, might well be presented; in teacriing literature, 
the great religious classics, above all the Bible should be as 
openly set before the students as their immense influence deserves; 
in teaching sociology, the religious institutions of society, the 
churches and synagogues of the student’s own cormnunity, in particular 
need to be included. 

This attempt to discuss the proper relationslid-p or balance between 
the secular and religious aspects of our culture cannot fail to reveal 
the fact that there is a considerable amount of confusion as to where the 
boundary between these two spheres should be d.rairn. If the line of 
demarcation were easily discernible, much of the conflict betxieen the 


^°Ibid., p. 130. 


5'llbid 









opposing views could be easily resolved. lippraann refers to this 
indefinable boundary between the tworealms when he says; 


185 


In the traditions of civility, tne prevailing view has been 
that the tvro realms are inseparable but disparate, .^nd that man 
must wor’ * ' ’■'* ^ * balance ./liich is never fixed 



finally 


lippmann continues: 

Because we are drawn between the two realms, tnere can be no 
definitive line of demarcation of the orbits of the state and of 
the church. Though the politcal government is concerned primarily 
with the affairs of the existential world, though the churches are 
primarily committed to the realm of the spirit, they m-et whenever 
and wherever there are issues of right and wrong, issues of what 
is the nature of man, of Xirhat is his true ima.ge, liis place in the 
scheme of uhings and his destiny. Both the state and the churches 
are involved in these decisions and their relationship cannot be 
defined by any clear, orecise demarcation of their respective 
spheres of influence.^ 

This description by Lippmann of the approximate line of demar¬ 
cation between the txra realms x-fould probably coincide with Fosdick's 
suggestions for the partners’nip between the secular and religious 
aspects of our cultxiral background. The failure to attempt or peniit 
sectarian indoctrination X70uld prove to be a source of dissatisfaction 
to the supporters of religious education on a sectarian basis, as 
Fosdick admits; 

That this procedure will fail to satisfy certain types of 
religious sectarians is obvious. It teaches no dogmas as indis¬ 
pensable j it doss not with evangelical fervor try to persuade 


.alter Lippmann, The Public Philosophy , (Boston; Little, 
Broxm and Company, 19 $ 5 )} pp. Ip2-1;).3.

students to a paiticular personal decision. The answer seems clear; 
any religious group is at liberty to build its own schools. Let 
the church o.nd the home tak:^ care of specific indoctrination and 
persuasion. That is their function, but let the public school help 
them by presenting the background against which any intelligent 
decision must be made. Lot religion be recognized and presented in 
our classrooms as one of manlcind’s predominant concerns. It would 
add a new dimension to the thinld.ng of boys and girls nov: untouched 

b- the church. 

In passing^ it should be mentioned that wliile Idppmann subscribes 
to the doctrine of the Separation of Church a nd State, he does not 
envisage this separation as a complete divorcement in all phases of 
activity. ?Iis theory of separation is set forth thus: 

but v.jnile the separation of the powers of the ch-urches and the 
stats is essential to a right relationship bstwean them, the nega¬ 
tive rude is not the principle of tliis right relationship. Church 
and state need to be separate, autonomous, and secure. But they 
raust also meet on all the issues of good and evil.^^ 

In sumsiarizing the case against releassd-time instruction, 

Pfeffer lists seven arguments advanced by its opponents; 

(1) The argument of separation of Church end State. 

( 2 ) The opening wedge. 'ven if the released tirae program is 
not in itself a threat to the non-sectarian public school, it 
constitutes an opening wedge that may lead to further encroachi'aents. 
Released-time itself, the opponents feel, idll prove ineffective, 
and demands will be made for further public school .involvement in 
religious education. 

( 3 ) Di’^/isiveness. The released-t.irae plan emphasizes religious 
differences and therefore there is a divisive i.nfluence. 

(li) Ineffectuality. The time alloted under the plan is

inadequate and must rcanain inadequate unless a substantial portion of 
the little tirae devoted to secular education is sacrificed. Released 
pupils may discontinue Sunday school attendance in the belief of their 
parents that their spiritual needs are adequately provided for by the 
released-time instructions. 

(5) Iroselytizing. This concerns JevriLsh leaders because of the 
minority position of the Jet/ish children and their consequent vul¬ 
nerability to intentional or unintentional proselytizing by their 
Christian schoolmates. 

(6) The effect on the public school prograra. There is too little 
time provided for secular studies to afford time for religious 
instruction. The released-tiiae plan is unfair to the nonreleased 
Ciiildren if the time is used merely for "busy” iJork, or it is un¬ 
fair to the released children if the time is used for positive 
educational activity. 

(7) Hostile sectarian teachings. Many people believe that 
there is much present-day religious instruction that encourages 
religious prejudice and particularly contributes to anti-Semitism. 
Though the state may not constitutionally proliibit such instruction,, 
it should not facilitate the children's being subject to it.^'^ 


Religious Educati on in Alberta . As mentioned previously, the 
Albeila School Act makes provision for a limited araount of religious 
education in the public schools of the province. (See Appendix D, page 
231, for the sections of the School Act dealing >7ith religioun exercises.) 
Mr. R. W. Warren, Superintendent of Schools for Calgary, makes the follow¬ 
ing cormaents in response to a questionnaire (See Appendix S, page 232.) 
regarding the manner in which the provisions of the Act are being 
utilized: 

The Calgary school system follows the School Act in that classes 
open with the recitation of the Lord's Prayer. Time is taken for

Bible readings fTOin the prescribed list, and in Grades I to VI one 
half-hour per week, usually on Thursday afternoons, is devoted to 
some elaboration of the Bible readings.^ 

That the purpose of tlds elaboration of the Bible readings was 
not to indoctrinate the pupils is made clear by Warren's next statement: 

This does not mean that there is an attempt to indoctrinate any 
cliildren; it means simply that an attemot is made to make the Bible 
readings more vivid and meaningful by illustration, that is, vdth 
stories from a list of Bible Stories approved by the Departiaent of 
Education. ..e have, in fact, prepc^red a short syllabus for the 
g'oidance of teachers in handling these stories. 


In response to the question, "Are you able to give the view¬ 
point of the teachers in response to this orogram?" Warren replies: 

I have made an informal evaluation of this program from t.ime to 
time and I think it would be fair to say that our school principals 
are in favor of the program, and I thinlc probably they reflect the 
viewpoint of the teachers as well. 99 

Finally the questionnaire asked, "Have 2 ^ou any idea of the pro¬ 
portion of the students who are excused from any or all of the religious 
activities listed above? (Lord's Prayer, Bible reading, released-time 
instruction). Warren's r eply was: 

To my knowledge no pupils ask to be excused from the prograra. 

I tiiirJ^ that this arises chiefly from the fact that we do not have 
Roman Catholic students in our schools. I doubt if any of the ad¬ 
herents of the Protestant faith could possibly object to the type 
of program offered.^*^^

Appendix F, page 23^ contains a sample syllabus as prepared by 
the Calgaiy School Board and supplied to each teacher. This syllabus 
was prepared as a result of an unanimous action taken by the Calgary 
School Board in February of 19 I 4.8 (See Appendix F) that beginning in 
September of that same year, one-half hour, from 3:30 to UtOO p.ra, be 
set aside in all classes from grades I to VI for instruction in the 
Bible, In the introduction to the syllabus proper the following explana¬ 
tion for the new ruling is made: 

There has always been general acceptance among Canadian people 
that all children and young people should acquire, in school or 
elsewhere, some knox^ledge of the major events in Old Testament 
history and of the life and teachings of Jesus, A knowledge of 
the Bible is regarded as part of the equipment of any educated 
Canadian citizen. The Bible has been linked closely with the 
life of the Jhglish-speaking people and it is part of the back¬ 
ground of the speech and writings of our day. It is among the 
great books of literature with which everyone should have acquaint¬ 
ance, It provides, too, a record of the spiritual growth of the 
Jewish people, culminating in the life of Jesus Christ,1^1 

E, M, Erickson, Superintendent of Schools, Wetaskiwin, gives a 
somewhat similar report as far as his schools are concerned. The roain 
difference is in the use made of one-half hour made available by the 
School Act, Erickson states that once each week, in the three central 
schools of hetaskiwin, one-half hour is turned over to the Mnisterial 
Association. Erickson reports that the teachers consider the program to

be successful. He was unable to give any estimate of the proportion of 
students (if any) who ask exemption from attendance at the religious 
activities.^^^ 

In order to secure an idea of the operation in the province as a 
vjiiole of the sections of the School Act dealing xd.th religious educc^tion, 
a questionnaire was sent to .. Frame, Chief Superintendent of Schools, 
Province of Alberta. Frame has tl'iis general comment to make regarding 
the status of religious education in the public schools of Alberta: 

The School Act provides that the day’s activities in a school 
commences with the reciting of the Lord’s prayer and the reading 
of Scripture, xd.thout comraent. However, it also provides that 
the board may by resolution dispense with either the Lord’s Prayer 
or the Scripture, or both of them. I have reason to believe that 
these exercises are observed more in the breach than othenriise, 
possibly half the classrooms reciting the Prayer and a very small 
nujnber reading the Scripture. 

Frame next directs his'remarks to the section of the School Act 
xrhich permits a local board to authorize up to one-half hour per day, 
at the end of the school day, for religious instruction. He m.^kes this 
statement: 

In Roman Catholic communities, full advantage is taken of the 
provisions of the Act, but in Protestant comraunities, usually due 
to the heterogeneous natujre of the people from a religiou.s stand¬ 
point, religious instruction is seldom offered. Spasmaiic attempts 
are made in toi-ms and cities to have the clergy t£ike turns offering 
religious instruction once a week. These programs are often dis¬ 
continued after a year or so.^^^

In dealing vdth the attitude of the teachers as a group, to 
religious instruction in the public school. Frame says: 

I am sorry to have to indicate that the majority of the teachers 
are not enthusiastic about giving religious instruction and fre¬ 
quently claim that they are not prepared to do so. 1^5 

Frame makes one final observation in regard to released-time 
instruction: 

When released time is arranged for religious instruction, most 
of the children take it; in other words, there are very few cases 
where parents write asking that their children be excused.1^6 

The Case for State Aid for Private Schools . The case for state 
aid for private schools is based chiefly on the contention that since 
financial assistance is granted to education, and since private schools 
are providing the same service approximately as state schools, they 
(the private schools) are entitled to equal consideration. 

Ontario, Saskatchewan, and Alberta, by making provision for 
separate schools for Roman Catholics maintained with public funds, are 
presently subscribing to the policy of state aid for parochial schools. 
Quebec, by its dual system, provides the same service. Newfoundland, 
ivith its complete absence of a state educational system, provides 
financial assistance in the form of salaries to any religious group 
which wi3JL supply a school building and a qualified teacher.

The A.rDerta School Act, Sections 7-12 (See Appendix G, p. 2UL^ 
outlines the machinery by wliich a Roman C tholic or r'rotestant minority 
may come under the provisions of the Act. Under the teims of these 
sections, the mijiority of electors in any district, whether Protestant 
or Roman Catholic, may establish a separate school. The electors estab¬ 
lishing a Rrotestant or Roman Catholic separate school shall be liable 
only to assessments of such rates as they impose upon themselves. In 
addition, a person assessed for public school taxation purt'joses is not 
also liable to assessment for any separate school in the district. 

The petition for the establishment of a separate school must be 
signed by three electors and presented to the rlinister of Education. 

The persons pemitted to vote on the request for the separate school 
must be electors of the district concerned, and of the same religious 
faith as the petitioners. 

In passing, it should be noted that provision is made for Roman 
Catholic or Protestant school districts—not for any particuj.ar Protest¬ 
ant sect but for Protestants in general. This means that a Baptist 
minority group in a school district predominantly Roman Catholic could 
not set up a Baptist separate school. They could, however, petition for 
and organize a Protestant separate school. It thus becomes evident that 
e:^d.sting regulations are not intended to provide separate sco.ools for 
all denominations but rather for one denomination, the Roman Catholics, 
and Protestants as a group. This possibly reflects a sliarp division of 
opinion between these two categories ,in regard to the question of state 



aid for private schools* This possibility vdLll be explored a little 
later in tliis thesis. 

Pfeffer, in discussing the question of state aid for private 
schools, advances a number of reasons. Tne following list is a con¬ 
densation of the argunents as given by Pfeffer: 

(1) Our religious tradition giving impartial and nondiscrimin¬ 
ating aid to all religious groups would be an act of loyalty to the 
religious tradition of our life without violating the principle of 
the Separation of Church and State. 

(2) The civil function of parochial schools. Aside from its 
essential role in the field of religion, the parochial school system 
provides a vital civic function: it provides millions of children 
mth the same instruction in secular subjects that is given in the 
public schools. Even if the principle of separation of Church and 
State is construed to bar non-preferential aid to religion, it does 
not prohibit the state from paying for what it receives. 

( 3 ) Double taxation. Catholic parents whose religious con¬ 
victions require them to send their children to parochial schools 
are subject to the unfair burden of double taxation. 

( 4 ) The precedents. Governmental aid for education is by no 
means unprecedented. . . . The exemption religious institutions 
receive under the federal laws is an instance of substantial 
government aid. 

The Case Against State Aid . It is quite likely that there is 
more uniformity of opinion on the question of state aid to paroc’rdal 
schools than on most phases of religious education in the public school. 
In referring to the general attitude taken by most prominent church 
groups, Pfeffer has this to say:; 


^^'^Pfeffer, op. cit ., pp. 1|35-U37

Today there is probably no responsible Protestant group of any 
prominence in the countiy that favors direct government financial 
aid to confessional schools; and this includes such Protestant 
denominations as the Lutherans and the Seventh-day Adventists, which 
maintain such schools. 

In the NEA Journal, January, 1931> Gordon C. Lee refers to the 
general opposition of Protestant groups to state aid for parochial 
schools when he makes this observation: 

The official pronouncements of most non-Catholic churches condemn 
unequivocally the inclusion of denominational schools in programs of 
public assistance.109 

Arthur Moehlman contends that parents who send their children to 
private schools should not expect government assistance because they are 
carrying an extra burden. He maintains that this burden was accepted 
voluntarily and the state should not be expected to divide public funds 
among so many different agencies that its services will be impaired: 

The plea that people who send their children to non-public 
schools are required to carry an extra burden is true, but this 
is a personal choice. To support non-public schools would dis¬ 
tribute funds so widely among protest agencies that it might 
invalidate the common program, which is the first line of defense 
for preserving and improving democracy. 

W. G. Martin, President, National Council of the Churches of 
Christ, voices the council's attitude toward this question of financial 
aid to non-public schools in these words:

The subsidization of education carried on under religious aus¬ 
pices would both violate the principle of separation between church 
and state and be a devastating blow to the public-school system, 
which must be maintained.m 

Conrad Moehlman contends that state aid to church schools would 
be undemocratic, since they gain a number of benefits, among which he 
lists: 

1* Escape from direct democratic control over these schools. 

2. Right to impose their religious tests on teachers. 

3. The promotion of their doctrines under their own censorship. 

U. Ownership of their schools. 

3# Retention of their general voting rights and privileges in 
public school matters.112 

Arthur Moehlman conceives of private parochial schools as protest 
schools, in the sense that they signify a different concept in regard to 
the purpose for the existence of a school. Rather than expressing con¬ 
demnation for the public system, many supporters of private or protest 
schools are actually strong admirers of the public school, since it 
represents the effort of the community as a whole. If, however, they are 
not satisfied with the community effort, parents can exercise their legal 
rights and send their children to a private school supported by their own 
funds.^^

Pfeffer roakes a point of the fact that Seventh-day /i.dventists, 
who are strong supporters of ixivate schools^ are opposed to state aid 
for such schools: 


Indeed, the Seventh-day Adventists—who probably have a larger 
percentage of their faith enrolled in paroclxial schools than any 
other denomination, including even the Catholics—..re umong the most 
vigorous of all denominations in their opposition to state aid.H^' 


To support his statement regarding the percentage of Seventh-day 
Adventists in their ovjn schools in comparison to Catliolics, Pfeffer 
gives the follovjing figures for the United States as of 19U7:

At this point it is appropriate to consider the status of private 
school enrollment in Alberta for a recent year. In.1932-33, the total 
enrollraent of pupils in Grades I-XII in Alberta was l89,08l. Of this 
nuifoer, 3^476 or 1,8 per cent of the total, vrere enrolled in private 
schools,Of the 3^1-!-76 enrolled in pr.ivate schools in iOLberta, uUp,

During this sarie 1952-53 school term, the number of pupiiJ.s enrolled in 

Roman Catholic separate schools was 12,U38 out of a Catholic population

of 186 , 312 o Thj.s gives a Roman Catholic separate school enro3.1ment

1952-53, the enrollment in Seventh-da;^^ Adventist elementary and second- 
arj> schools in Alberta was UkS out of a population of ]4.,808, or 9.3 per

cent. The figures given above are used to show the measure of support 
which Seventh-day Adventj.sts give to the practice of establishing paroch¬ 
ial schools. This support is not born of any deep-seated opposition to 
the public schools. Adventists have a great deal of respect for the work 
of the public schools and are v/illing to pay ta:x:es to support this sys¬ 
tem as long as they are granted the privilege of maintaining their ovm 
schools at their own expense without the aid of government grants. Con¬ 
rad Moehlman describes the Adventist stand thusj 


Adventists claim the privilege but do not subscribe to the cor>- 
demnation of the point of view formulated by the Greater Detroit 
and Y/ayne County CIO Council, ”The public education highf/ay is the 
public school system, and if that is not good enough for you, it 
is your privilege to build your own private education highway, but 
why" should public funds be given to those who despise and ignore 
the public school system?**^"^

five reasons why its opponents feel that it is unwise to make state 
funds avilable for paroclTial schools: 

(1) The Separation of Church and State. Tliis by all odds is 
the most frequently and most vigorously asserted arguiaent against 
state aid to religious education. 

(2) Divisiveness. Parodiial schools divide . . . caildren along 
religious lines and are a hindrance to true cultural unity. 

(3) No double taxation .... operate on the theory that all 
the oublic is benefitted by the secular education of children and 
all the public must pay for it—whether or not they have children^ 
and whether or not they want to send them to public schools. 

(I4.) Fragmentation of the public school system. This world happen 
if each particular denomination received state support for its 
schools. 

( 3 ) Interreligious rivalries. Once it is adroitted that public 
funds may be used for religious schools^ there will inevitably follow 
conflict and rivalry among the sects as to how funds are to be 
divided. 

The foregoing discussion has been designed to show the divergent 
views held by various groups in regard to the question of religious 
education in the schools. The attitudes expressed range all the way 
from strong support for religious education to violent opposition. In 
several cases the arguments used by the opposing groups are definitely 
contradictory. There seems to be no iroiaediate prospect of any degree of 
unanimity on the subject. The Canadian scene is not characterized by any 
noticeable uniformity. Althouse has t’nis to say regarding present 
Canadian practice: 


^^Pfeffer, 00. cit . 3 pp. k37-h3o.

Where religious minorities enjoyed special educational rights 
before a province entered the Dominion^ these rights are continued 
after federation. This as. ures separate schools in three provinces; 
it perpetuates a dual system in uebec; it enables Newfoundland to 


retain its system of chiurch schools. 


12i 


Altliouse admits that such a diversity is boimd to add to a 
nation's headaches when he makes the fol.lowlng comraent: 


Few administrators would be likely to choose 
if they were asiced to devise a school system de

facing a situation which did not exist a generation or more ago. There 
was a time when the responsibility of the school was clearly defined. 


It was charged with the responsibility of providing for the academic 


trairdng of the children and youth of our nation. The home had its part 


to play in .imparting certaj.n fundamental types of training along the 


lines of health, manners, morals, and good citizenship, xilong v.jith the 
church, it accepted the responsibility of supplying the religious instruc¬ 
tion which society considered necessary. In discussing the greatly 
increased respons,ibility which has been thrust upon the school by our 
rapidly evolving society, Althouse makes this observation: 

Now the school finds that that simple day has gone. Now it 
must attempt all that the other socializing agencies fail or 
neglect to do. Tliis is a large order, and by no means definitely

stated. There is a real danger* that vjith its enlarged field, the 
school piay grope about ijith more good intent than clear riroose. 

. . 

Sby concludes that after centuries of experience in trying to 
solve the ;x oblems of religious education, a number of conclusions may 
safely be advanced: 

(1) Christian churches had proved so delinquent in enlightening 
the rational capacity of the people that their long monopoly of 
teaching was taken over by the state. 

( 2 ) Modern states have taught Christianity in order to inculcate 
reverence for public morals and authority and to perpetuate political 
and economic control rather than to evangelize individuals. 

( 3 ) Priblic school religion has usually tur’ned out to be just 
another curricular subject and a specious substitute for spiritual 
realization. It devitalizes the faith that subraits to, or promotes 
it^ and under it churches become formal and complacent, and lose 
their power. 

(li.) No statement, formula, or syllabus of religious hru.th has 
been devised that is satisfactory to all Christian bodies, much less 
to other faiths, which all agree should be taught as a cormnon 
denominator and a basis of morality. 

( 3 ) In the natiire of the case, state-employed teachers cannot 
teach Christian doctrine in a xvay that is acceptable to all Christian 
bodies. 

(6) Ho plan has yet been devised by which all church groups can 
teach their views in connection with the secular public schools with¬ 
out violating the constitutional provision of the separation of 
church and state. 

( 7 ) The Canadian system of nroviding both Protestant and Catholic 
schools at public expense is now breaking down. 


^^hb-Ia., p. 37. 






201 


(6) The European ^stern of teaching the several creeds in the 
state schools is equally a violation of the rights of individual 
conscienc9,‘^‘^^ 

Sby climajces his list of conclusions with this statement, ”In 
consequence of these difficulties, the problem of religious instruction 
remains unsolved«”^^^ 

Education today is thus torn betv/een t7;o opposing philosophies. 

On one side it is urged to do something about the great unsolved prob¬ 
lem of religious education. Arrayed against this school of thought is 
the viev7 e^qpressed by manj^ that the school cannot safely enter the realm 
of the conscience. In listing the outstanding unso7ived educational 
problems, Eby gives fjrst place to this problem of religious education: 

How the religious emotions, attitudes, and ideas, indispensable 
for the organization of ethical personality, ina.y be nurtured in 
all children, co-ordinate with a system of secular public sc^iopls, 
constitutes the supreme problem of contemporary^ civilization‘ 

Hov/ this can be done and still respect the right of the individ¬ 
ual to worship according tc the dictates of his 07;n conscience is a much- 
debated question. One view holds that the secular public school cannot 
enter the realm of the conscience and still be true to its responsi¬ 
bility to meet the needs and respect the rights of every member in 
the community. The other opinion ma.intains that, because of its 
religious heritage, the state and also the school, as the voice of the

state, must declare its allegiance to the principles of Christianity. 

The danger inherent in the situation which sees the state utilize its 
legislative powers to promote religion is referred to by John Diefenbaker 
as follows: 

Freedom of religion is in danger when it can be interfered vjith 
directly or Indirectly by national or provincial governments, or by 
the municipal by-laws of some city, toi'/n, or village. 128

CHAPTER V 


SUMLIARY AM) CONCLUSIONS 
SiuDniary 

In this final chapter an attempt will be made to answer the 
questions which were suggested in Chapter I as possible outgrowths of 
the discussion undertaken in this thesis. To refresh the memory of 
the reader, these questions will be repeated at this juncture: 

1. Can the system of public education as we know it today meet 
the demands of Seventh-day Adventists? 

2. Is it possible for the public school system to be so altered 
or adapted that it can more nearly meet the requirements of Seventhr>day 
Adventists ? 

3. liiibat attitude do Seventh-day Adventists take toward the sug¬ 
gested introduction of religious training in public schools? 

ii. Yfliat is the position of Seventh-day Adventists regarding 
state aid for private schools? 

5. What are some of the principal problems that must be solved 
if the Seventh-day Adventist educational program is to be expanded? 

6o Based on the experience of the past, what would the future 
of Seventh-day Adventist education in Canada appear to be? 

In addition to answering these questions, this last chapter win 
summarize briefly the general content of the thesis. In conjunction with 
question six, an attempt will be made to foresee some of the problems 



20h 


facing ieventh-day Adventist education in Canada and especially Canadian 
Union College. 

Question 1. Can the system of public education as we know it 
today meet the demands of Seventh-day Adventists? 

To this question, the answer woiild have to be '^No.” This deci¬ 
sion to differ with the objectives and ideals of the public school sys¬ 
tem does not stem from any violent disapproval of the system. Rather, 
the decision of Seventh-day Adventists to maintain their oi'jn private 
schools wherever possible is a recognition of a particular concept of 
the separation of church and state. Ttiis concept prevents them from 
aslcLng concessions of an institution maintained by public funds for the 
education of st^■ldents representing eveiy creed, illthough under any law 
permitting released-tirn.e instruction, they wovCLd have equal privileges 
with other religious denominations. Seventh-day Adventists are not vdll- 
ing to engage in any form of sectarian instruction when financed by 
public funds. 

Seventh-day Adventists find themselves in a somevjhat paradoxical 
position in regard to religious education. One the one hand, they 
subscribe to the necessity of including in their system of education 
the Judeo-Christian heritage which forms a significant part of western 
culture. They are ready to admit that only in this way can the v/hole 
man be educated. They agree with the supporters of re.ligious education 
in the schools that two world wars in the lifetime of many people still 
living and the iinminence of a third one of still greater porportions and 





205 


intensity have emphasized the need for a faith by v;hich to live. They 
concur that man’s ability to invent has outstripped Ills sense of control 
over the weapons of destiniction which now makes a third vjorld war virtual 
international suicide. They recognize in religion the answer for many of 
the problems which face the nations today. 

It is at tliis point, however, that the agreement between the oro- 
ponents of religious education in the public schools and the Seventh-day 
Adventists terminates. They are unalterably opposed to the state, 
tlirough the public scaool system, lending its authority to the propaga¬ 
tion and promulgation of religion. They contend that such action is a 
violation of the basic and fundaraental principle of the Separation of 
Church and State. Their interpretation of religious freedom would also 
provide for the individual who refuses to believe in God at all. They 
deny the right of the public school to use its influence in changing 
the views of the children who come from homes where such views are held. 
It is the contention of Seventh-day adventists that it is the right of 
any individual to believe or not to believe in any or all forras of reli¬ 
gion without any pressure being exerted by the state-supported school. 

The vievjs of Seventh-day Adventists on the subject of religious 
liberty is contained in the following Declaration of Principles, Inter¬ 
national Pueligious Liberty Association: 

lie believe in religious liberty, and hold that this God-given 
right is exercised at its best when there is separation between 
church and state. 







206 


..e believe in civil government as divinely ordained to protect 
men in the enjoyment of their natural rights, and to rule in civil 
things; and that in triis realm it is entitled to the respectful 
and willing obedience of all. 

ie believe in the individual's natural end inalienable right of 
freedom of conscience to worsnip or not to wors'nip; to profess, to 
practice, and to promulgate his religious beliefs or to change 
them according to his conscience or opinions, holding that these are 
the essence of religious liberty; but ohat in the exercise of this 
right he should respect the equivalent right of others. 

..■e believe that all legislation and other governmental acts 
which unite church and state are subversive of human rights, 
potentially persecuting in character, cind opposed to the best 
interests of church and state; and therefore, that it is not :n.th¬ 
in the province of human governirient to enact such legislation or 
perforra such acts. 

.ue believe it is our duty to use every lawful and honorable 
meaiis to prevent the enactment of legislation which tends to unite 
church and state, and to oppose every movement toward such union, 
that all roay enjoy the inestimable blessings of religious liberty. 

..'e believe that these liberties are embraced in the golden rule, 
Wtiich teaches that a man should d.o to others as he world have 
others do to him.^ 

It is upon these principles that Seventh-day Adventists base 
their pliilosophy of the separation of church and state in the realm of 
education, frank II. Yost, editor of Liberty , A Magazine of Religious 
Freedom , and a spokesman for Seventh-day Adventists, opines: 

It must be insisted upon, therefore, that children from homes of 
diverse faiths, or no faith, be protected from having to listen, in 
a puolic school, attendance upon which is compulsory, to religious 
teaching to which they do not subscribe. It must be insisted upon

also that the machinery of the public school, paid for from public 
tax money, removed by law from the pockets of citizens of every 
faith and no faith, shall not be used to propagate ariy one religion, 
however popular locally 3 several religions; or any composite reli¬ 
gion, set up for a given purpose by a group of citizens in a given 
locality, as a program for teaching religion to public school 

children ,2 

Question 2, Is it possible for the public school system to be so 
altered that it can more nearly meet the requirements of Seventh-day 
Adventists? 

In the light of the foregoing discussion, it is quite obvious 
that the answer must be, ”No.“ Because of their strong stand on the 
separation of church and state there is no apparent way of rsaching a 
solution. Seventh-day Adventists maintain that the public school should 
only properly concern itself with the teaching of skills and general 
moral principles and leave untouched the spiritual aspects of our cul¬ 
ture. Seventh-day Adventists believe that if any parents expect more of 
the school, they should be willing to pay for it by furnishing the funds 
necessary to maintain such a school. Adventists claim that the estab¬ 
lishment of such a church-sponsored school does not and should not exempt 
any individual from the payment of taxes to finance the public school. 
They contend that the public school, maintained through public itinds, is 
a buiwark of our democratic society and any protest school, no matter how 
large or small, must be an additional expense to those who receive the 
benefit, if any, of its existence.

Religious Freedom , (Washington, B. C.: Review and Herald Publishing 
Association, First Quarter, 1955), PP* 25, 26. 











208 


Question 3* ./nat attitude do Seventh-day i.dventists talce toward 
the suggested introduction of religious training in public schools? 

Here again Seventh-day Adventists join the ranlcs of the opposition. 
They are convinced that the religious training of the caild is essentially 
the duty of the home and the church. Seventh-day Adventists are opposed 
to having the govemraent legislate on the religious training of any child 
or youth in atteiidance at a public school. The apparent need for a re¬ 
newed effort in the inculcation of religious principles in the lives of 
our youth is conceded^ but adventists urge that this challenge be accepted 
by the parents in conjunction with a militant church. 

Question U. .hat is the position of Seventh-day Adventists regard¬ 
ing state aid for private schools? 

The official denominational stand of the devsnth-day adventist 
church is against the acceptance of state aid. The only place in Canada 
where there is any noticeable violation of this stand as far as Advent¬ 
ists are concerned is in Newfoundlr^nd, vjhich does not have any system 
of public education but utilizes the facilities of chuTch-sponsored 
schools. In return for this privilege, the provincial govemraent of 
Newfoundland pays the salaries of the teachers in these scnools. 

Cpiestion Ifnat are some of the principal problems that must 
be solved if the Seventh-day Adventist educational program is to be 
expanded? 

The complete answer to this question is beyond the scope of tliis 
thesis but an attempt will be made to discuss at least several of the 









209 


leading problems which confront Seventh-day Adventists today. It is the 
purpose of the author to consider three of these problems: (a) the 
financial problem, (b) the problem of school-operated industries, (c) 
and the need for accreditation of the college program at Canadian 
Union College« 

(a) The Financial Problem . The financial problem was pointed 
out in Table XXII, page llU, which shows an operating loss over the past 
seven years ranging from $k29 to almost #i3,000. Added to this picture 
is the fact that the difficulty of collecting accounts from former 
patrons has caused the accounts receivable, both current and old, to 
increase at a disturbing rate. Another look at liable XXXV, page 
emphasizes this fact. Current accounts, which amounted to approxi¬ 
mately $10,000 at the close of the 19Ult-li^ school term, had increased 
to over $ 14 . 3,000 for the 1955-56 term. Over this same twelve-year per¬ 
iod, old accounts sho?fed a similar increase, having moved from less 
than $ 15,000 at the end of the 19W4-ii5 school term to almost $i 45>000 
by the close of the 1955-56 term* This gives a total of almost $90,000 
in uncollected accounts at the close of the 1955-56 term. This unfavor¬ 
able picture has not improved, and at the end of March, 1957> current 
student accounts receivable stood at over $59^000 and old student ac¬ 
counts receivable at over $50,000, making a grand total of over 

$ 109 , 000 . 

l%ch of this large amount in student accounts receivable is 
traceable to the fact that a large number of the students come from farm 
families whose cash income has been greatly curtailed by the inability 




1 






210 


to market grain, especially v;heat. Some of the school's patrons find 
themselves in the peculiar situation of having as much as two crops 
in storage on the farm and part of a third crop. The cash income of 
many of these grain farmers is barely sufficient to meet the running 
expenses such as seed, paynents on machinery, taxes, etc. The Seventh- 
day adventist patron is faced tJith the possibility of sending his 
c'liildren to the public high school or asking the administration of 
schools, such as Canadian Union College, to extend creriit .in the hope 
that conditions will improve and he will be able to market his gra.in. 

The school, on the other hand, faces an awkward situation. Many of the 
pdtrons ho.ve themselves attended Canadian Union College in previous 
years and have possibly already sent one or more of their older cliildren 
to the school they once attended. These younger cnildren have a fixed 
determ.ination to attend the same school. The parents have thousands of 
dollars in grain but little else. The school administration finds it 
difficult to adopt a strictly impersonal, objective approach to the 
prob,l9m. The members of the finance committee, which meets regularly 
each month, knowing the patrons .in an intimate, personal way, authorizes 
the school adrainistration to allow the account to increase above the 
allowable maximum. Over ninety per cent of these accounts are finally 
collected, but during the interim the finances of the school are sub¬ 
jected to cons.iderable stra.in. 

On the elementary level, a financial problem is also encountered, 
but s,ince the amount involved is considerably smaller, the potential 



loss is not so great* To further ease the situation, the payment of the 
elementary teachers is cared for by the conference. In case the patrons 
fall behind, the conference brings pressure to bear on the local church 
school board to collect the fees. In many of the churches, a fund is 
provided to take care of any children in the church whose parents are 
unable to finance a church school education. In addition, most churches 
provide a regular church school subsidy out of local church funds. 

(b) The Problem of School-operated Industries . Various problems 
are inherent in the establishment of industries in a school. Without 
operating capital or any way to secure such capital, school-operated 
industries are a continual source of concern. In most cases, these 
school industries are started in a very small way and require years of 
careful management before they can be considered stable. Insofar as the 
industries at Canadian Union College are concerned, there are several 
problems that have proved to be of paramount importance: the general 
inefficiency of certain types of student labor, the difficulty of organ¬ 
izing an efficient industrial program through the utilization of student 
interrupted-time labor, and the difficulty of conforming to certain of 
the regulations of the Alberta Labor Act while still trying to integrate 
a scholastic program v/ith an industrial program. 

The problem of student labor as a whole is perhaps the number one 
problem. Since approximately seventy per cent of the student body is 
registered in the high school division, the greater proportion of stu¬ 
dents will fall in the fourteen to eighteen year group. In common with 








212 


many young people of this age gro ip, triis portion of the student body 
represents a definite liability to the work prograjn. There are excep¬ 
tions to this statement but, taken as a whole, the amount of supervision 
required for the successful utilization of this segment of the student 
population has always presented a definite problem. To train these 
young workers to be prompt in reporting for v7ork and dependable .j'hile on 
the job is almost enough to absorb the full time of a supervisor. 

The student labor is paid for at the rate of Ub to 65 cents an 
hour and in too many cases, labor performed by Ip, 16, and 17-year old 
students working for as little as two to three hours at one stretch is 
liighly \inpreductive. Such labor, instead of being cheap, becomes ex¬ 
pensive. Some of the more mature students can, however, make a definite 
contribution and make up to - 1.2p an hour on contract work. ‘ince the 
various industries are not run on a strictly coinraercial basis, there is 
no simple means of dispensing entirely with the marginal worker. 

The problems involved in running a school industry, utilizing 
student labor, are not entirely internal in nocture. The possibility of 
strictly comnercial industries paying ujiion wages and being compelled 
to compete with a similar industry which is reputedly earring much lower 
wages is a cource of contention. On at least two occasions between 
June, 1955^ June, 1957^ direct representation has been made to the 
Alberto. Department of Industries and Labor, charging the school with 
unfair business practices. In both cases, it has been necessary for 
the administration of Canadian Ihion College to make an explanation 
regarding the charges against the college industries.

The first incident in regard to this problem of alleged unfair 
business practices came to a climax, in June of 1953• Before the prob¬ 
lem was finally settled, it was necessary for a brief to be prepared. 

The vjriter of this thesis was asked to prepare the brief and also to 
present it. On June lli, 1953^ at a regular meeting of the Board of 
Industrial Relations, this brief was presented. In Appendix H, page 
2h3} the reader will find a copy of this brief. 

Shortly before the aforementioned complaint was lodged xfith the 
Department of Industries and Labor, investigation was made to .;Ietermine 
whether or not it would be possible for the workers in the various school 
industries to come under the provisions of the 'workmen’s Compensation 
^ict. Due to the fact that the development of the industrial program 
exposed an increasing number of the students to greater occupational 
hazards, it was felt advisable to take tliis step. In the process of 
this investigation, an interview was held with J. 3. Gormack, solicitor 
for the Workmen’s Compensation Board. Cormack gave careful study to 
the organization of the industrial program with a view to inclusion of 
the employees of college industries under the terms of the Act. 

Gormack stipulated that to warrant compulsory inclusion vdt’oin the 
terms of the ..orlamen’s Compensation Act, there must exist between the 
employer on one hand and the employes on the other a certain stipulated 
relationship. This relationship is known as the master-servant rela¬ 
tionship. Cormack’s d.ecision was that, since this mas ter-servant 
relationship was absent, there was no statute which wouJ.d make it

compulsoiy for the students to come under the terms of the Workmen's 
Compensation Act, He did, however, advise the college administration to 
make volimtary application to be included under the provisions of the Act. 

Such application was made and it was ruled that the only way for the 
students engaged in working in the industries to be covered by the pro¬ 
visions of the Workmen's Compensation Act would be for all students and 
teachers to be included in the plan. This went beyond the original in¬ 
tention which was only to include the industrial workers. Since the 
premium was based on the total payroll, this meant considerably more 
expense, but it was felt best to provide complete coverage in this way. 

Because of the ruling of the Workmen's Compensation Board that the 
master-servant relationship did not exist, the college argued that there 
were certain paragraphs in the Alberta Labor Act which were not properly 
applicable to the industries operated by Canadian t&iion College. The 
regulations which were in question were these: 

1. The regulation stating that an individual (man or woman) who 
works less than four hours is entitled to the payment for four hours. 

(See Appendixes I and J, pp. 250-31 )• 

2. The ruling that all labor must be paid for in cash within ten 
days of the close of the period of employment. (See Appendix K, p. 252). 

Because of the fact that most students found it impossible to work 
for four consecutive hours and still carry a full school load, Canadian 
Union College asked for permission to have this law waived in their 
case. The ruling that labor must be paid for in cash was also considered 
to impose a heavy strain on school finances. Since students were working

to defray school expenses^ permission was requested for the school to 
withhold payment in order to keep student accounts dovm. If, however, 
a student should sever his connection nith the school, it was agreed 
that the school must pay all monies owing wit’nin ten days of the ex¬ 
piration of the period of employment. 

As justification for granting exer^ption from these regulations. 
Sections 20 and 28 of the iilberta Labor Act were quoted. Under these 
sections (See Appendix K, page 232), the Board of Industrial Relations 
was granted the power of exempting any industry from part or all of 
the regj.lations pertaining to such industry if considered necessary or 
exoedient. 

It was further suggested that in the event Canadian Union College 
industries were granted certain concessions during the school year, it 
would be understood that these concessions would be waived during the 
vacation periods when students were not in attendance at classes. 

These requests were considered by the Board of Industrial Rela¬ 
tions and the requests for special consideration were granted. In 
addition, the Board cleared the college of the charge of engaging in 
unfair trade practices. 

The second complaint lodged with the Board of Industrial Relations 
occurred in May, 1957. This complaint also charged that one of the 
college industries, specifically the bookbindery, was cutting p.-ices and 
thus engaging in unfair trade practices. Explanation has been made to 
the department and it is quite unlikely that the complaint vjill go any 
further.

(c) The Need for Accreditation of the College Division » At the 
time of writing (May, 1957)5 the work offered in the college division 
is not recognized by the University of Alberta or by other provincial 
universities. It is the present practice for students who graduate from 
the Junior college division to complete their final tv/o years in one of 
the number of senior Seventh-day Adventist colleges in the United States. 
All these senior colleges in the United States belong to the accrediting 
associations in their own section of the country, and in this way the 
students who graduate from these schools gain a certain amount of 
recognition* 

ihere has been a growing awareness with the passing of the years 
that there would be a definite advantage if the Junior college work were 
recognized by the University of Alberta. A student whose work on the 
Junior college level v/as recognized as well as the v/ork taken in the 
final year or two would have a distinct advantage over the present-day 
graduates from the Junior college program. The present situation is 
rather paradoxical in that their senior v/ork is recognized, having been 
taken in an accredited school, while their Junior work is not recog¬ 
nized for the contrary reason. 

There are several problems that would require solutions before 
an accredited Junior college program could be implemented. Such prob¬ 
lems would naturally include the acquiring of properly qualified person¬ 
nel, certain additions to equipment, and the physical plant, and ouher 
items which could be handled by making the necessary funds available.

The greatest problem, hov/ever, and the one wldch apoears the least 
likely of solution stems from the basic policy and pLiilosophy of Seventh- 
day Adventists. Accreditation of the college program actually involves 
affiliation and as such means that all students receiving credit in any 
given course must write the s ame examination at the same time as do the 
students at the university of Alberta. This would mean that every time 
an examination was scheduled for a Saturday, a special examination would 
have to be prepared and adrainistered for a handful of students. Seventh- 
day Adventists are quick to recognize this inconvenience they would 
cau^e and are loathe to ask for special consideration. It has been 
suggested that possibly a special dispensation could be granted by the 
church to enable students in certain unavoidable situations to writs 
examinations on Saturday. The Seventh-day Adventist church has never 
attempted to be conscience for the individual, and it would refuse to 
take an official stand in any situation involving an individual’s 
duty to his God. The prospect of an accredited .junior college program 
is still a higlily desirable objective, but there does not appear to be 
any immediate possibility of a solution. 

Question 6. IJhat would the future of Seventh-day Adventist educa¬ 
tion appear to be? 

At the present tirae. Seventh-day Adventist education is in a 
satisfactory condition. The total enrollment in all schools operated 





218 


by Seventh-day Adventists was 1,8UU, or 13*8 per cent of church member¬ 
ship at the end of the 1956-5? school term,^ The trend is for the 
establishment of more ch-'irch schools and unless there is a major change 
in the attitude of either the government or of the patrons, this trend 
should continue. There is no immediate prospect of ary noticeable drop 
in either the number of church schools operated or in the total enroll¬ 
ment. It would seem safe to assume that the general pattern of natural 
growth will apply and that there will be a gradual increase in both. 

As far as Canadian Union College is concerned, there has been a 
gradual increase in the average enrollment during the first five decades 
of the history of the school.

From thds table it can be seen that^ except for the depression 
period in the thirties, there has been a definite pattern of increasing 
enrollmant as far as Canadian Union College is concerned. Because of 
the relatively small membership in Canada end oarticifLarly Western 
Canada,^ there does not seem to be much prospect of any unusual increase 
in the next decade. One factor which might possibly cause a definite 
trend tov/ard an increased enrollment would be the accreditation of the 
junior college division. In view of the fundamental difficulty of 
integrating Seventh-day Adventist students into a orogram which requires 
Saturday examinations, it is not likely that t'nere will be any move in 
tliis direction for the present. The general practice will be for 
Seventh-day Adventist youth to continue taking two years in the unac¬ 
credited college division and then transfer to a senior college in the 
United States. This means that the majority of these young people will 
ultfnately talce up perraanent residence in the United States instead of 
returning to Canada. A certain nuraber insist on attending an accredited 
school from the very beginning of their college work, and they go 
directly to the United States following the coiiipletion of grade ..II. 
These students xmo take all of their college .ork across the line are 
even less likely to return to Canada. In attempting to fill vacancies 

^hiccording to the latest report issued by ._i. L. Green, Secretary 
Canadian Union Conference of Seventh-day Adventists, Oshawa, Ontario,

that arise in denominational work of the Seventh-day Adventists in 
Canada, it is sometimes impossible to find a Canadian who is willing 
to return to this country. 

This problem of persuading Canadians to return to Canada to fill 
positions of responsibility is faced not only by Seventh-day Adventists 
but by many professions and organizations across the Dominion. 

The accreditation of the junior college work, especially in the 
field of elementary teacher training, would make it possible to place 
properly certificated teachers in many of the Seventh-day Adventist 
chiurch schools across Canada. It would also serve as an attraction 
for many of the young people who are going to the States in search of 
educational opportunities in an accredited institution. 

In the local Seventh-day Adventist churches, the supporters of 
the church school will continue to carry a double tax burden v/ithout 
complaint as long as they are granted the freedom of choice between 
the public and parochial schools. Inhere they are compelled by circum¬ 
stances to send their children to the public school, they will support 
the concept of a public school system free from sectarianism and cont- 
mitted to the imparting of a strictly secular and academic training. 

The larger boarding schools, of v^hich Canadian Union College would serve 
as a type, will undoubtedly continue to experience financial problems. 

The operation of industries manned largely by students will require care¬ 
ful management in the future as in the past. Since education has always 
been expensive from the standpoint of dollars and cents, the true profit

of this church-sponsored educational system will be in the contribution 
made to society by the students and graduates who come from these insti¬ 
tutions. If, perchance, these present problems should find a measure of 
solution, undoubtedly our changing environment will produce nev/ problems 
which will challenge the ingenuity of the educators of tomorrow. 

Conclusion s 

The history of Seventhr-day Adventist education in Canada has been 
presented in this thesis with a view to discussing the background prob¬ 
lem of parochial schools in a democratic country which may justly boast 
of the excellence of its system of public education. The author of this 
thesis has endeavored to show that the establishment of private schools 
by Seventh-day Adventists is not intended to convey condemnation of the 
public schools. Recognizing the inability of the state to fulfill the 
function of the church. Seventh-day Adventists are committed to the es¬ 
tablishment of elementary schools in which their children can receive an 
education which combines the academic phase with the spiritual. Board¬ 
ing schools similar to Canadian Union College have been established in 
Ti'yhich an attempt is made to preserve the atmosphere of a Christian home, 
(See Appendix L, p,$3for the school home regulations at Canadian Union 
College.) In the boarding schools maintained by Seventh-day Adventists, 
industries are established v/herever possible in order to implement their 
philosophy of useful labor as an adjunct to learning, 

Evidence has been presented to show that the system of public 
education as we know it today cannot meet the demands of Seventh-day

Adventists. In the light of the Adventist stand on the separation of 
church and state, it has been shown that the public school system can¬ 
not be altered so as to meet the requirements of Seventh-day Adventists. 
Adventist claim that the church and the home are the agencies which are 
failing the youth in this age of uncertainty and loss of religious faith. 
They believe in their own system of private schools where they can impart 
the religious training they feel is a necessary part of a complete educa¬ 
tion. They are not favorable toward the use of pijblic funds to support 
parochial schools and are equally opposed to the teaching of religion in 
the public schools. 

Finally, as a result of the historical sketch, an effort has been 
made to isolate some of the principal problems facing Seventh-day Advent¬ 
ists in their educational work today. Also an attempt has been made to 
foresee the future of Seventh-day Adventist education based on the 
experience of the past.

APPENDIX F 
CALGARY SCHOOL BOAiiD 

BIBLE READINGS - GR'»DB II - SEPIEl'IEER 1949 


Bible Instruction in the Calgary Schools 


The Calgary School Board in February of 1948 agreed unanimously 
that beginning September of this year, one-half hour, from 3:30 to 4:00 
p.m. on one day in each week should be used in all classes of Grades i 
to VI for instruction in the Bible, Authority is granted under Section 
157 of the School Act to Boards of Trustees to set apart one or all of 
the final half hours of the school day for this purpose. 

The reading of a passage of scripture, followed by the recitation 
of the LordVs Prayer at the opening of school in the morning is, and has 
been, obligatory for many years in all classrooms in the province from 
Grade I to Grade XII. 

There has always been general acceptance among Canadian people 
that all children and young people should acquire, in school or else¬ 
where, some knov;ledge of the major events in Old Testament history and 
of the life and teachings of Jesus, A knowledge of the Bible is re¬ 
garded as part of the equipment of any educated Canadian citizen. The 
Bible has been linked closely with the life of the English-speaking 
people and is part of the background of the speech and writings of our 
day. It is among the great books of literature with which everyone 
should have acquaintance. It provides, too, a record of the spiritual 
growth of the Jewish people, culminating in the life of Jesus Christ. 

In order to insure that all children in the Calgary Public Schools secure 
some knowledge of the Bible, the Calgary School Board has increased the 
time to be spent in Grades I to VI on Bible study by one-half hour per 
V7eek, 


The last half hour on Thursday or Friday afternoon is to be used 
throughout the schools as the regular Bible study period. Friday is un¬ 
doubtedly the best day, but since many schools use this half hour for 
school concerts or other programs, it is recommended that either of the 
ti/vo be chosen by each school and definitely assigned for Bible study 
purposes. In order that Bible instruction, v/hich will now be given both 
in the morning readings and in the half hour study on Thursday or Friday 
afternoons, may be as interesting and effective as possible, the graded 
series of books entitled, '‘Teachers’ Guide to Religious Education," pub¬ 
lished by The Ryerson press, Toronto, has been selected for use as the 
















(

te:ct in Grades III to VI, and as a supplementary reference in Grades 1 
and II; the study of each week will center around a single chapter from 
these te:x-ts. The series provides one hook for each grade, with the 
follo^ving titless 


The Friend of Little Children 
citories of God and Jesus 
Jesus and His Friends 
Servants of God 
Leaders of God*s people 
Jesus and the kingdom 


Grade I 
Grade II 
Grade III 
Grade IV 
Grade V 
Grade VI 


In classes of mixed grades the text of the senior group will be 
used. There are about thirty lessons in each book. These, with an 
additional five lessons on the special occasions of Thanksgiving, 
Christmas, i^aster. Empire Day, and Dom.inion Day, for v/hich Bible readings 
are suggested in the attached supplement, will provide sufficient lessons 
to allow one to be taken each week of the school year. 

The method of using these Teachers' Guides' in Grades III to '^U is 
to follow the series of lessons in the aj)propriate book, with its daily 
morning readings as given in the attached supplement, and then on Thurs¬ 
day or Friday afternoon from 3j30 to 4:00, base further study on the 
information given in the text as a means of summarizing, illustrating or 
reviewing the five Bible Readings which have been taken up in the morn¬ 
ing reading periods. The texts give many helpful teaching suggestions 
which will add to the interest and meaning of the Bible selections. 

VJiere a topic or series of topics lends itself to enterprise procedure, 
this should be used. Some hymns should be learned and sung, and some 
great verses or passages should be m-emorized. 

Maps, films and slides, flat pictures and blackboard illustin,- 
tions will aid considerably in promoting intei-est in Bible readings and 
in helping children to understand the people and the customs of Biblical 
times, Ivlaps, either purchased or drown on cardboard or wrapping paper, 
of the eastern Mediterranean, of Palestine or of special areas of 
Palestine will enable senior pupils to localize historical events, just 
as pictures such as those used in Sunday Schools will be helpful aids to 
junior pupils in making ancient people more real. If good films can be 
rented, they ’vill be placed in the School Board Office. A dozen film 
slides on the life of Christ have been purchased. 

The following is a list of Bible story books which are considered 
as 'V’/ell adapted to the unders'banding of children in Grades 1 and II. In 
these grades the Teachers' Guides will be used as supplementary texts. 

One book'may be requisitioned for each Grade I and II room.

OF TliB PROVINCU OF ADimA 
June 14, 1955 


Introduction 


This hrief is being submitted to the Board of Industrial Relations 
by Csnadian Union College for the express purpose of 

(a) Acquainting the board with the objectives and operation of 
Canadian Union College. 

(b) Inviting the Board of Industrial Relations to consider how, 
within the framework of the Alberta Labor ^ct, Canadian 
Union College can achieve these objectives and continue to 
make the maximum contribution to its patrons and to Alberta 
as a province and Canada as a nation. 

Canadian Union College is but one member of a world-wide system 
of elementary schools, academies, and colleges which total 4,871, v;ith 
a total enrollment of 233,950 and a teaching staff of over 10,000. 
(Figures as of June, 1953) 

All these schools share a common heritage of ideals designed to 
train the boys and girls, young men and young women to discharge their 
responsibilities to their fellow citizens and to their G-od. 


Objectives of Canadian Union College 

1. Ihe development of a character approved of Cod and in favor 
vjith man, TJhich reveres the sacred and holy, which has a. quick sense of 
honor, and which appreciates the genteel and cultuj*ed. 

2. To give youth such a vision of the world *s need that they may 
be led to dedicate their lives to the service of Cod. 

3. To guard sound health as evidenced by a strong and graceful 
body, an alert and inquisitive mind, and a happy and congenial spirit. 

4. To develop in the students those attitudes v;hich make possible 
the most successful and harmonious himian relationships. 

5. To train every student in the duties, responsibilities, and 
privileges of citizenship.

6, To emphasize the importanoe of the dignity of labor and the 
training of each student in a vocation, trade, or profession v/ith suf¬ 
ficient skill to earn a livelihood, 

7. To develop the resources within oneself to appreciate and 
noblest in literature, art, music, nature, and wholesome 

recreation—without depending on the mechanical or the art if icial—to 
find a worthy use of leisure. 

In short, Canadian Union College seeks to develop harmoniously 
the heart, the hand, and the mind. In its activities as a boarding 
school, attention is given to the four basically sound phases of all 
true education:

Bxtent of Offerings at Canadian Union College 


1, Elementary School - a three-room school offering instruction 
in grades 1 to 8 with a total enrollment of 78, 

2, High ‘School - an eighteen-teacher staff offers instruction in 
grades 9 to 12, 

Both the elementary and secondary schools employ only qualified 
teachers. At both levels of instruction, the work is fully accredited 
with the AlUerta Department of Education and is highly regarded by their 
representatives who make annual visits of inspection. The high school 
enrollment is 21S, 

3, College Division - a four-year course leading to the Bachelor 
of Theology degree is offered. In other fields, college courses are 
offered in pre-nursing, pre-medical, pre-X-ray, secretarial, applied 
arts, jiinior arts, and teacher training, 'ivork on the college level is 
not recognized by the University of AlUerta, but is accepted by Seventh- 
day Adventist senior colleges in the United States, where most of our 
students go to com.plete their college work. The enrollment in the 
college division is 75, 

A survey of the alumni list up to the end of 1950 reveals these 
interesting facts regarding our graduates*

Financial Operation of Canadian dnion College 

The question naturally arises as to how Canadian Union College is 
maintained. Since it is a private school, it receives no government 
grants of any kind. Its income is derived in the main from three 
sourcesj 

(a) Fees paid by the students 

(b) Income from industries 

(c) Gifts from the Seventh-day iidventist Church 

During the five-year period from 1946 to 1950, the total operat¬ 
ing loss after receipt of gifts and grants was 524,613.52. During this 
same period the total amount of capital and operating donations from 
the church for new buildings and to cover operating losses was 
5453,688.24. (This last figure is for the period 1950 to <^anuary 25, 
1951.) 


A look at a more recent auditor’s report shov;s that for the school 
year ending June 30, 1954, the net operating loss after adding gifts and 
grants v/as 515,971.99. 

For the current school year, the operating loss to April 30, 1955, 
was 528,137.41. 

For the current school year, some of the losses by departments 


are as follows: 

Instructional Division.|:24,405.63 

Housing (Dormitories, teachers, 

cottages). 11,128.72

This picture is not promising nd in some of your minds the 
question v/ill naturally arise as to the v/isdom of maintaining indus¬ 
tries where losses are so heavy. It must be borne in mind, hov/ever, 
that Canadian Union College is not a profit organization. It is essen¬ 
tially a training institution desi;^ed to train tho heart, the hand, 
and the mind, thus producing bet er citizens whose chief duty is to 
build a better Canada and a better world in v;hich to livo. 

TiTnen measured in dollars and cents, education does not pay. 

Great nations and farsighted individuals have always put money into 
education not because it shows a profit on the balance sheet but be¬ 
cause in the great race of life t lose who have enjoyed the advantages 
of a well-rounded education have led their generation to greater heights 
by the realization of great visions implanted in their souls by the 
institutions of learning that have moulded their ambitions. 

Since these consistently heavy losses are not attributible to 
mismanagement, vjhat are the real reasons for the financial picture? 

The losses would be considerably reduced if the v/ork in all departments 
were turned over to a full-time employee instead of students, z* young 
person v/ho is carrying a full school program cannot hope in his spare 
periods to achieve the same degree of proficiency as would be expected 
of a full-time worker. His productivity is greatly reduced and the 
training period required to develop proficiency is considerably length¬ 
ened. In spite of these apparent disadvantages, the industrious student 
is able to earn part of his expenses T/hile engaged in securing a formal 
education, buch a student is bet':er equipped to grapple with the 
vicissitudes of life and when opportunities may fail to present them¬ 
selves in a professional field, he can fall back upon the vocational 
skills acquired during the years of formal education. This plan is in 
keeping with the objectives mentioned earlier in this brief. 

Broken-time labor is not profitable and never can be e:}q)ectod to 
prove so, but from, the standpoint of training and citizenship its con¬ 
tribution is not to be minimized. It is the purpose of Canadian Union 
College to keep losses at a minim-um, but it is the aim of the adminis¬ 
tration to regard the training factor as of paramount importance. It is 
only in this way that losses can be justified. 

Most of the industries operated at Canadian Union College present 
little or no threat in the competitive field because of their small size 
and remoteness from available markets. The only ones that give any 
appreciable promiise of entering the competitive field are the bookbindery 
and the furniture factory. Hov/ever, even in these fields the problem of 
broken-time labor ^vill make it very unlikely that profits of any con¬ 
sequence will ever be realized. Hull-time, non-student labor could v/ell 


c 


c. 









2U7 


put these industries on the profit side of the ledger, hut this would 

call for a sacrifice of one of our primary objectives. >/0 urge the 

Industrial Relations Board to help us realize our objective as a train¬ 
ing institution and not force us into the strictly competitive field. 

In all cases the amounts earned during the school term are less 
than the expenses of the individual students and merely serve to reduce 
the unpaid balance at the end of each month. During the school year 
most of the student labor is paid according to an hourly scale ranging 
from 40 cents to 60 cents per hour, ^lome labor is performed under con¬ 
tract. During the summer vacation a limited number of students remain 
to work and accumulate a credit which it has been customary to aoply 
toward the following school term*s expenses. The rates during the 

summer are reasonably higher since a student works full time. The 

hourly rate v/ill range from 50 cents to 90 cents per hour. 

Most of the students enter school under financial plans which 
call for weekly labor ranging from 12 to 17 hours a week. *i/hen spread 
over the whole week the number of hours daily is necessarily at a 
minimum. 


Isolating the problem 


Undoubtedly our present predicament is due in large measure to 
our attempt to train young men in the field of furniture manufacture. 

ViTe have found it a costly venture to train immature students of high 
school age and. then lose their services just when they have developed 
a reasonable degree of proficiency. 

However, since most of our students are financially unable to 
pay all of their expenses in cash, the furniture factory, together with 
our other departments, furnishes a partial answer to the problem. The 
departments which furnish the students with the most labor credit ares 


Arranged in Order of Amount of Labor Qredit Supplied 
(As of April 30, 1956) 


1. Cafeteria 

2. Viood Products 

3. Farm 

4. Press 

5. Dormitories 


6. Maintenance 

7. Laundry 

8. Bookbindery 

9. Student Readers 


Jfhen the furniture factory was started in the fall of 1954, it 
was realized that some measure of protection must be afforded to 
students working around machinery. After some deliberation the

Viorlanen^s Compensation Board was consulted. Iir. J. o. CoiTiack, 
solicitor for the board, was interviewed and a ruling was requested 
regarding our status to determine the eligibility of our students 
under the terms of the kiorlonen’s Corapensation iict. ii representative 
of the board visited Canadian Union College and studied our organiza¬ 
tion and method of operation. On the basis of this inspection, ..r. 
Cormack informed us that our work program did not qualify us for inclu¬ 
sion under the ’.Torkmen^s Compensation iict because of a fundamental 
deficiency in the relationship between the college and its student 
workers. In order to qiBlify automatically for inclusion under the 
.Workmen’s Compensation j^ct, there must be a master-servant relation¬ 
ship. This relationship was ruled to be non-existent since the student 
enrolled as a student and not as a laborer. 

In spite of this, v;e were invited to make voluntary application 
to come under the provisions of the act v/ith no guarantee that our 
application would be accepted. This application was made and finally 
accepted by the board, ikll departments of the school are now under the 
protection of the V»orkmen*s 'Compensation Act, not because we are com¬ 
pelled to do so, but because of our application to be eligible for the 
protection afforded by the act. This incident could be interpreted to 
mean that it is recognized by the ‘Workmen*s Compensation Board that the 
v/ork program carried on at Canadian Union College is not truly indus¬ 
trial as the term is generally understood. 


Our Relationship to the provisions of the 
Alberta Labor Act 

The culmination of this entire brief is the problem of how the 
Alberta Labor Act is to apply to our v/ork program at Canadian Union 
College. A rather careful study of the provisions of the i*lberta 
Labor Act reveals three principal points, a strict literal interpre¬ 
tation of ?/hich v/ould seem to work unusual hardship upon the school. 

respectfully suggest that the Board of Industrial Relations give 
sympathetic consideration to our request that some compromise be ivorked 
out by which the hardship might be alleviated. 

The three points in qiaestion are; 

(1) The ruling that where an individual works less than four 
hours he (or she) is entitled to not less than four hours pay. 

(2) All labor performed must be paid for in cash. 

(3) All departments of the school where student labor is 
utilized are deemed to come under the terms of the Alberta Labor -ict.

This "brief has tried to oresent in some detail the operation of 
Canadian Union Jollei^e and the peculiar relationship between the 
scholastic program and the work program. It is our hope that this 
board can find some means of helping us to attain our objectives and 
still meet the requirements set forth in the labor act. 

In addition, we humbly suggest that it may be possible under 
oection 20 and 28 of the i^lberta Labor iict to provide some measure of 
relief from the conditions that would exist vjere the provisions of the 
labor act to be rigidly enforced. 

V/e would further suggest that this board appoint a representative 
to visit Canadian Union College at the earliest opportunity for the 
purpose of getting a first-hand knowledge of the institution, •^uch an 
inspection would make it easier for this board to make a decision based 
on a more complete knovjledge of conditions as they really exist. 

In conclusion, Canadian Union College wishes to thank the Board 
of Industrial T^elations for its kind consideration in permitting them 
to plaoe this brief before you. 

Respectfully submitted June 14, 1955,

careful and prayerful study has been given to the requirements set forth 
in this bulletin. There are the "rules of conduct" of our homes based 
upon our denomination standards and the counsel given us frora the Lord’s 
messenger. The administration of the school invites your support and 
observance of the rules set forth herein, as well as those in the 
regular bulletin.

SOCI.iL FltIVIL3aL3 

Bscortin^; at oocial iiivents : .re recognize at a co-educational institu¬ 
tion that learning to associate ;vith the opposite sex is a vital part 
of our college life, i'roper association refines the conduct and enables 
the character, oenior young men are granted the privilege of escorting 
senior young ladies to certain Saturday evening social events, iinnounce- 
ment will be made in advance concerning the evenings escorting is in 
order. Both the young men and women must be at least eighteen years of 
age or on scholastic college level. The dean of men has a list of the 
young ladies eligible for escorting. Young men may call at l.aple Hall 
for the young ladies 30 m.inutes before the announced time of the begin¬ 
ning of the programme, iill village or dormitory ladies being escorted 
should be called for at I'iaple Hall and accompanied back to i-japle Hall. 
Loitering around the entrance of any building or strolling in couples 
may result in loss of escorting or association privileges. Let us 
endeavor to conduct ourselves as true Clliristians in our association with 
each other. 

At Programmes and church in the chapel and auditorium only brothers and 
sisters are allo^^/ed to sit together. The east side of the chapel and 
auditorium is reserved for young men and the ivest side for the young 
ladies. Following the programme students are expected to go directly 
to their respective dormitories. 

Parlor Privileges s Young men of escorting age may visit young ladies 
of escorting age in the parlor of ivliaple Hall upon the approval of the 
deans. Continuance of such privileges is dependent upon high Cliristian 
conduct in keeping vnth Canadian Union College standards of association. 

MISCBLLAlTiiaJS - 

1* Music : Onl^r such playing of music as is in harmony with our high 
standards is allowed. Jazz and swing m.usic is entirely out of place. 
Cheap coYfooy music is not in harmony ’with good taste. 

2. Reading I'^iaterial ; Comics, cheap magazines, and obscene literature 
are forbidden, .‘iny such literature will be confiscated and destroyed, 
Pla^ring of rook, and regular playing cards is forbidden. Such games 
will be confiscated and destroyed. 

3, Dormitory Business Calls ; If the occasion arises .when students wish 
to visit someone in the other dormitory it is expected that he or she 
stop at the office of'^the dean and make proper arrangements. This in¬ 
cludes visits to the married couples in Liaple Hall, The domitory is 
not a public building. Calls should not be made during study period. 

If an emergency arises, the dean or monitor will make arrangements.

will be taken only to those approved by the nurse. If the young men 
must visit the nurse’s office please make proper arrangements at the 
monitor’s desk in Maple Hall,
