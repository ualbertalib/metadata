STUDIES ON N ON-SYMBIOTIC NITROGEN FIXATION 


IN SOME ALBERTA SOILS. 


K. C. IVARSON. 


INTRODUCTION 


Since one of the elements of protein is nitrogen, 
all living things on this planet, whether animal or vegetable, 
must have nitrogen in their food* This great demand for 
nitrogen means that large quantities of nitrogen are removed 
every year from the land. 

The earth 1 s atmosphere contains enough nitrogen to 
replenish this annual nitrogen loss, yet not nearly enough of 
this free nitrogen is converted by artificial synthesis into 
combined nitrogen. Therefore man depends to a large extent 
upon nature to capture and fix atmospheric nitrogen. 

One of nature 1 s methods of helping man is to provide 
microorganisms that are capable of assimilating atmospheric 
nitrogen. These microorganisms belong to two major groups, 
usually designated as non-symbiotic and symbiotic nitrogen¬ 
fixing bacteria. 

The symbiotic nitrogen-fixing organisms, as the name 
indicates, fix nitrogen while living symbiotically with 
leguminous plants. This relationship has been known since 1886, 
and the value of leguminous crops to mankind has been known 
for thousands of years.

In 1893 Winogradsky isolated anaerobic non- 
symbiotic nitrogen fixing bacteria which he called Clostridiu m 
pasteurianum * Eight years later Beijerinck isolated aerobic 
forms to which he gave the generic name Azotobacter * Following 
the discovery of these nitrogen-fixing organisms which could 
lead a free existence within the soil, keen interest was 
taken in their study* 

Milne (60) investigated non-symbiotic nitrogen fixa¬ 
tion in Western Canadian soils* However Milne ! s (60) experi¬ 
mental work was mostly confined to Saskatchewan soils* Also 
no information was obtained as to whether the nitrogen fixing 
organisms from these Canadian soils could fix nitrogen under 
apparently practical conditions. Thus, besides determining 
the relative nitrogen fixing powers of various Alberta soils, 
it was felt that additional work should be done to secure 
data regarding the effect, on non-symbiotic nitrogen fixation, 
of some of the cultural practices used by Alberta farmers* 

For these reasons seme attention was paid to the 
following problems: (1) the application of straw to soil 
culture to find out if the byproducts of decomposing straw 
could be utilized as energy for non-symbiotic nitrogen 
fixation, (2) the effects of cultivation on the soils 1 
nitrogen-fixing powers, (3) in southern Alberta the application 
of irrigation waters frequently leave the soil in a water¬ 
logged condition. Therefore some work was done to determine 
the effect that waterlogging has upon non-symbiotic nitrogen 
fixation, (4) also attempts were made to determine the effect

of fertilization upon non-symbiotic nitrogen fixation. 










REVIEW OF LITERATURE 


Since the discovery in 1891 hy Winogradsky, as 
reviewed by Waksman (75), of an anaerobic organism belonging to 
the group of butyric acid bacteria and capable of fixing atmos¬ 
pheric nitrogen non-symbiotically, a voluminous literature on 
non-symbiotic nitrogen fixation has accumulated. Therefore, 
because of such an abundance of available literature it is only 
possible in this thesis to review the more pertinent aspects 
and fundamentals of non-symbiotic nitrogen fixation. 

It is proposed here to divide the literature review 
into two parts, namely, Part I and Part II. Part I, the major 
portion of the literature review, will cover non-symbiotic 
nitrogen fixation. Part II, the minor portion,will give an 
extremely brief review of the decomposition of plant residues. 

The inclusion of this latter part was deemed desirable because 
a considerable amount of the author’s work pertains to the 
ascertainment of the beneficial action that decomposing straw 
has upon non-symbiotic nitrogen fixation. 

Part I: Non-symbiotic Nitrogen Fixation 

Stephenson (71) remarks, 11 the faculty of using molecular 
nitrogen for the synthesis of cell material is, so far as we 
know, confined to micro-organisms, and is not shared by any of 
the more complex forms of life.” 

Waksman and Starkey (78) report that these micro-

organisms can be divided into two groups: (1) the non- 
symbiotic bacteria which lead a free existence in the soil and 
obtain energy from various compounds found in the soil, (2) the 
symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria which live in symbiosis 
with certain plant roots, namely the legumeroots. 

(1) Non-symbiotio Nitrogen-Fixing Organisms 

These free existing organisms are generally divided 
into two groups; the aerobic organisms and the anaerobic organ¬ 
isms . 

(a) Aerobic Organisms 

This group is largely represented by the genus Azote - 

bacter . 

Bergey*s Manual of Determinative Bacteriology (6) 
lists three species; Az . chroococcum, Az. agilis and Az. indioum . 
Az . chroococcum Bei.jerinck.;bhe type species, is listed as a rod, 
2.0 to 3.0 by 3»0 to 6.0 microns, occuring in pairs and packets 
and occasionally in chains. The cells show three or four 
refractile granules. The organisms are surrounded by a slimy 
membrane of variable thickness, usually becoming brownish in 
older cultures, due possibly to the conversion of tyrosine to 
melanin. They are gram-negative and motile by means of numerous 
peritrichious flagella. On gelatin the colonies are very small, 
circular, yellow, granular, later becoming yellowish-brown. 

This organism produces only slight growth even in the presence 
of glucose, and peptone is utilized with difficulty. Litmus 
milk is reduced in 10 to 14 days. On potato, colonies are 
glossy, barely visible, slimy to wrinkled and may become

yellowish, brownish-yellow or chocolate brown. The organism 
fixes atmospheric nitrogen and gives off carbon dioxide, 
utilizing such carbon compounds as fructose, maltose, glucose, 
sucrose, mannitol, inulin, dextrin, galactose, arabinose, starch, 
glycerol, ethyl alcohol, acetate, butyrate, citrate, lactate, 
malate, propionate and succinate. It has an optimum temperature 
of 25°C. to 28°C., and occurs naturally in the majority of neutral 
or alkaline soils. 

Waksman (76) reports that some soil microbiologists 
recognize only two or three species. However, he states that 
there are five known species. Besides the three mentioned by 
Bergey (6) he claims there are also Az. beijerinckii and Az . 
vinelandii . 

Earlier workers such as Bonazzi (7) and Jones (41) 
found peculiar morphological phases occuring in azotobacter 
cultures. Jones (40) claimed that azotobacter had heat-resistant 
endospores and that the visible granules were reproductive organs. 

Lohnis and Smith (55) claimed that not less than 
seven different morphological types can be developed and stabi¬ 
lized from azotobacter cultures. 

Later workers like Eisenstark et al (15-j , with the 
aid of an electron microscope found that azotobacter had four 
distinct morphological cell types: (1) one day old cultures 
were predominately large plump rods, (2) after two or three days 
of growth cells became somewhat smaller, (3) two and three week 
old cultures showed long branching rods and thread forms, 

(4) cells from cultures one month old were predominately minute

coccoid cells. 

Eisenstark et al (16) found balloon forms and other 
morphologically abnormal cells if azotobacter were grown on 
nutrient agar or soil extract agar, but couldnt.t obtain these 
peculiar shapes if grown on nitrogen-free medium. 

Eisenstark and McMahon (14) using phase microscopy 
observed that azotobacter cells had a clear zone surrounding 
internal dark areas. On other bacteria this clear zone represents 
the polysaccharide capsule or slime layer. However, in the case 
of these azotobacter cells this clear area would not take a 
capsule stain. Consequently the authors concluded that perhaps 
azotobacter cells are differentiated into true cytoplasmic 
areas and true nuclear areas as are the cells of higher plants. 

(b) Anaerobic Organisms 

Waksman and Starkey (78) claim that the anaerobic 
nitrogen-fixing species are generally referred to as Clostridium 
pasteurianum but the anaerobic forms embrace numerous closely 
related forms most of which produce butyric acid when utilizing 
carbohydrate material. 

Bergey (6) mentions that both Cl. pasteurianum and Cl. 
butyricum fix atmospheric nitrogen and have many other similar 
characteristics. 

According to Bergey (6) Clostridium pasteurianum is 
a motile rod 0.7 by 5.0 to 7*0 microns, straight or slightly 
curved, with rounded ends, occuring singly, in pairs and in 
short chains. Their spores are oval, excentric to subterminal, 
swelling rods to clostridal forms. These organisms are gram¬ 
positive becoming gram-negative and do not liquefy gelatin. On

plain agar slant (anaerobic), little or no growth occurs. On 
glucose agar (anaerobic), surface colonies are circular, slightly 
raised, moist and creamy white; the subsurface colonies are 
biconvex, dense, yellowish-white, entire and the agar is frag¬ 
mented early by abundant gas. Blood agar is not hemolyzed. 

In plain broth there is little or no growth. In glucose broth, 
there is abundant, diffuse turbidity with much gas produced. 

In litmus milk, the organism produces acid and early coagulates 
the milk with stormy fermentation. It produces acid and gas 
from glucose, sucrose, inulin, galactose, fructose, and dextrin. 
Glycerol, starch, lactose and mannitol are not fermented. This 
organism is distinguished from Clostridium butypicum, by the non¬ 
fermentation of starch, and it fixes atmospheric nitrogen and 
grows well at 30°C # to 37°C. 

(c) Other Non-symbiotic Nitrogen-Fixing Organisms 

As reviewed by Allison et al (3) Drewes found that 
certain blue-green algae, especially species of Anabaena and 
Nostoc had the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen when grown on 
nitrogen-free medium. 

Allison et al (3) extensively investigated the nitrogen¬ 
fixing powers of Nostoc muscorum and found that the organism 
readily obtains its nitrogen and carbon from the atmosphere. 

The quantity of nitrogen fixed was as high as 10 milligrams 
nitrogen and IS milligrams of nitrogen in 45 days and S3 days 
respectively per 100 ml.of carbohydrate free medium. 

In recent years some other photosynthetic organisms 


have been found to have the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen

The first experimenters to report on this subject we.re Kamen 
and Gest (44)* They used isotopic nitrogen (N 15 ) and Rhodo - 
spirillium rub rum 5 a member of the family Athiorhodaceae , and 
found that the organism could fix atmospheric nitrogen when 
cultured both in the dark and in the sunlight* 

Wall et al (80) used three members of the family 
Athlorhodaceae and found them to be able to fix atmospheric 
nitrogen* 

Lindstrom et al (51) found five members of the family 
Athiorhodaceae and nine different strains of rhodopseudomonads 
were able to fix atmospheric nitrogen* 

(2) Mechanism of Nitrogen Fixation 

The mechanism of nitrogen fixation, by organisms, has 
attracted the attention of many workers* The conclusions mad© 
from their experimentations resulted in the formulating of many 
hypotheses which were and are still speculative. Hence it 
is proposed here to review only the two recent hypotheses which 
appear to be the most reasonable* 

(a) The Hydroxylamine Hypothesis 

As reviewed by Wilson and Burris (82) Virtanen and 
Laine found that in inoculated leguminous plants: (1) aspartic 
acid is the sole nitrogenous compound excreted in any quantity, 
(2) extremely small quantities of oximinoauccinic acid are 
detected in the excretory products, (3) oxalacetic acid is found 
in the plants, (4) excised nodules fix more nitrogen when 
oxalacetic acid is supplied.

Waksman (76) states that Virtanen found aspartic acid 
in young cultures of azotobacter before ammonia could be detected. 
Wilson ( 8 ) states that Endres found hydroxylamine in azotobacter 
cultures and since the hydroxylamine was found in the presence, 
but not in the absence, of free nitrogen Endres concluded that 
it originated from nitrogen fixation. Wilson ( 62 ) also reports 
that Virtanen found that about five percent of the nitrogen fixed 
by azotobacter is excreted as aspartic acid with traces of 
hydroxylamine. 

Waksman (76) states that Virtanen suggested the 
following series of reactions:

(b) The Ammonia Hypothesis 

As reviewed by Burk and Horner (9) Kostytchev, working 
with azotobacter, found measureable quantities of ammonia in 
a culture medium separated from the cells and pellicles. 
Winogradsky, as reviewed by Burk and Horner (9), found the 
greatest yield of ammonia occurred when the medium was at a pH 
of 9 . 0 . Consequently ’Winogradsky claimed that ammonia was the

intermediate product in the fixation of atmospheric nitrogen. 

The high alkalinity prevents the cells from assimilating the 
nitrogen as ammonia, hence it accumulated at pH 9*0. 

Burk and Horner (9) conducted several experiments 
and concluded that the presence of ammonia was caused by spon¬ 
taneous cell decomposition. 

Phelps and Wilson (63) reported the occurrence of 
hydrogenase, the enzyme which activates molecular hydrogen, in 
azotobacter and rhizobium. Wilson et al (81) also found hvdro- 
genase in azotobacter cells. Lee et al (47) showed evidence 
that this hydrogenase is capable of transferring molecular 
hydrogen to methylene blue or molecular oxygen. 

Lee and Wilson (46) found that sources of combined 
nitrogen which readily inhibit nitrogen fixation by azotobacter 
also inhibit the formation of hydrogenase. Hence, they concluded 
that hydrogenase is closely related to the nitrogen-fixing 
system in azotobacter. 

Wilson and Burris (83) supply evidence that points to 
ammonia as the key intermediate in nitrogen fixation by azoto¬ 
bacter. They cite three conclusive results: (1) isotopic 
nitrogen (N^) supplied as nitrogen or ammonia always accumulated 
in about the same proportions in the cell amino-acid fractions. 

In glutamic and aspartic acid is high; in histidine and 
arginine it is low, ( 2 ) ammonia is immediately accepted as a 
source of nitrogen even if the organisms have been previously 
grown in the presence of atmospheric nitrogen, (3) the organisms 
will only assimilate combines nitrogen, at a rate comparable to

free nitrogen, from compounds which are readily converted to 
ammonia. 

Wall et al (80) found that photosynthetic bacteria 
could utilize ammonia as readily as nitrogen and the nitrogen 
always accumulated in about the same proportions in the cell 
amino-acid fractions. Rosenblum and Wilson (65) and (66) 
report that ammonia can be utilized by Clostridium pasteurianum . 

Wilson and Burris (83) in support of the ammonia 
hypothesis proposed the following scheme.

From the foregoing papers it appears that these two 
hypotheses (which are the latest) are conflicting. The most 
impressive array of experimental data has been gathered for the 
ammonia hypothesis. Therefore, it would seem that ammonia is the 
most likely intermediate product in nitrogen fixation. However, 
as Wilson and Burris (83) point out, no one has disproved Burk 
and Horner’s (9) findings that ammonia is the result of catabolic 
instead of anabolic origin. 

(3) Distribution and Numbers of Non-symbiotic Nitrogen-Fixing 

Organisms In Different Soils 

As reviewed by Waksman (74) Ojaeliansky and Freudenreich 
found Clostridium pasteurianum in practically all of the Russian 
and G-erman soils. Haselhoff found Clostridium pasteurianum in 
137 soils out of 132 soils collected from different parts of 
the world. Riccardo isolated Clostridium pasteurianum from 
Vesuvian soils in Italy. Burri found azotobacter in 34 soils 
out of 103 soils sampled. 

Yamagata (83) found azotobacter in about 33 percent 
of the 300 soil samples collected from the northern to the 
southern part of Japan. Ohmasa (62) reports that 8 out of 29 
soils, taken from the forest of Tokyo University, in Japan, 
contained azotobacter. In the Szechuei province, China, Gaw 
(23) found that azotobacter was present in 78 percent of all 
soils examined. Altson (4) found azotobacter in certain 
Malayan soils where the pH was above 6.0 

Gainey (24) states that about half of the soils in

Kansas contain azotobacter. The organisms were seldom present 
in virgin, but were abundant in cultivated soils. Jones and 
Murdock (42) isolated azotobacter from 9 out of 17 soil types 
examined, and from 22 out of 29 soil samples representing 9 
tjrpes in Ontario. Lochead and Thexton (54) working with 
Ontario soils found: (1) azotobacter were consistently higher 
in unfertilized soils than in fertilized soils, (2) the numbers 
of azotobacter showed no relation to the productivity of the 
soils. 

Joffe (39) found that the cultivated soils in Crimea 
are more active in nitrogen-fixing powers than the virgin soils. 
Martin (57) reports that 82 out of 94 cultivated soil samples 
taken from Arizona contained azotobacter, while only 27 out 
of 119 virgin soil samples contained azotobacter. He also 
reported that 19.6 milligrams of nitrogen were fixed per gram 
of cultivated soil and only 5.3 milligrams of nitrogen were fixed 
per gram of virgin soil. 

Vandecaveye and Moodie (73) working with Washington 
soils observed; (1) the azotobacter population of virgin and 
cultivated soils in non-irrigated areas were the same, (2) azoto¬ 
bacter.were abundant in the irrigated soils of the 10 inch rain¬ 
fall area, (3) azotobacter were present in the non-irrigated 
soils of the 15-20 inch rainfall area. 

Greaves and Bracken (30) found numbers and fixing 
powers of the bacteria were twice as high in Utah cultivated 
soils as in virgin soils. Milne (60) working with Saskatchewan 
soils found the rate and amount of nitrogen fixed was similar

in sand cultures inoculated with cultivated and virgin soils. 

Waksman (76) reports that Duggeli found: (l) 100 - 
1,000,000 anaerobic and 0 - 100,000 aerobic nitrogen-fixing 
bacteria per gram of soil, (2) plots treated with sodium nitrate 
contained 1,600 - 12,000 cells of Clostridium and 4,900 - 6,300 
Azotobacter , per gram of soil, (3) plots treated with potassium 
and phosphorus contained 98,700 Azotobacter and 1,120,000 
Clostridium per gram of soil. 

Waksman (76) also states that Rossi found an average 
of 1,813 Azotobacter cells per gram of Italian soil, and Swaby 
isolated Azotobacter from 26 percent of all soil samples examined. 

Spiegelberg (68) found Cl. pasteurianum as a causi- 
tive organism in spoiled canned pineapple. 

It is evident from the above that the anaerobic organ¬ 
isms are more widely distributed than the aerobic organisms. 

This wider distribution is partly due to the anaerobic organ¬ 
isms' ability to tolerate a wider range of pH, which will be 
discussed later. 

Also of interest is the fact that cultivation and 
irrigation appear to increase the numbers and fixing powers of 
the aerobic organisms in some cases. 

(4) Factors Influencing Non-symbiotic Nitrogen Fixation . 

(a) Utilizable Energy Sources 

The large number of energy materials used in labora¬ 
tory cultures has already been mentioned under the heading, 

"Non-symbiotic Nitrogen-Fixing Organisms." However, apparently

there are sources of energy added by nature and farming 
practices that are of sufficient importance to be discussed 
here separately. 

Winters (84) reports that manure promotes nitrogen 

fixation, 

Richards (64) showed that azotobacter alone is unable 
to fix an appreciable amount of nitrogen in feeces, but in 
combination with B. lactis aerogenes it fixes three times as 
much nitrogen as when alone, 

McBeth (58) added dextrose and cellulose to: (1) a 
pure culture of azotobacter, (2) a mixed culture of azotobacter 
and Bacillus rossic a (a cellulose decomposing bacterium). He 
found, after a suitable incubation period, that the mixed 
culture gave an appreciable increase in nitrogen over the 
azotobacter culture alone. 

Krishna (46), using sandy cultures found that both 
azotobacter and Cl . pasteurianum could utilize, as energy, 
the byproducts of straw decomposition. 

Hutchinson (37), at Rothamsted, added 5 and 10 per¬ 
cent of wheat straw to soil contained in erlenmeyer flasks 
and found: (1) the 5 percent level of straw gave a more signi¬ 
ficant increase in nitrogen fixation than the 10 percent level 
of straw, (2) the use of sand and GaCO^ in conjunction ?d.th 
the experiment gave the best results. This was probably due 
to the neutralizing of the acid products formed, (3) the 
addition of 10 percent of elm leaves stimulated nitrogen fixa¬ 
tion to the same extent as 5 percent of wheat straw.

Fulmer (20) added 1.5 percent of green clover, wheat 

and oats straw to field and garden soils contained in pots. 

The soil moisture was maintained at 25 percent and the incu- 

o 

bation temperature was 25 C. Upon nitrogen analysis after 
a suitable incubation period he concluded: (1) green manures, 
as clover, wheat or oats when added to soil favor nitrogen 
fixation, (2) the non-legumes stimulated fixation more than 
the legumes. 

Jensen (38) showed that if actinomycetes were asso¬ 
ciated with azotobacter, the latter were unable to utilize 
the byproducts of cellulose decomposition. 

(b) Effect of Aeration 

Although Clostridium pasteurianum is an obligate 
anaerobe, Stephenson (71 ), in reviewing Winogradsky 1 s work, 
reports that in the presence of contaminating aerobes it can 
exist under apparently aerobic conditions. The aerobic organ¬ 
isms consume the oxygen, during growth, and create sufficiently 
anaerobic conditions to permit neighboring cells of Clostridium 
to develop. This symbiotic condition may account for nitrogen 
fixation in soil-sand cultures apparently devoid of azoto¬ 
bacter . 

Stephenson (71) states that the physical conditions 
of a medium which tend to increase surface area and hence 
improve aeration are beneficial for aerobic nitrogen fixers. 
Thus agar, sand, gypsum and colloidal silica are beneficial. 

Hunter (36) bubbled sterile air through azotobacter 
liquid cultures and found: (1) aeration gave a prompt and

(d) Effect of Reaction 

Waksman (74) states that the optimum reaction for 
Cl . pasteurianum is pH 6.9 - 7.3, hut they can develop well 
at pH 3.7. This is probably one of the contributing factors 
for its wide occurrence, which has already been discussed. 

On the other hand azotobacter, as the literature 
reveals, can very seldom withstand a greater acidity than 
pH 6.0. Fred and Davenport (18) report that they found the 
critical acid value for azotobacter to be pH 6.3 and the alka¬ 
line value to be pH 8.6. Gainey (22) found that pH 6.0 was 
the critical acid value. Burk et al (12) found that the 
nitrogen-fixing ability of azotobacter ceased below pH 6.0. 
However, when combined nitrogen was present in the medium the 
organism could survive a pH of 4.0 by using this form of nitrogen. 

Ohmasa (62) found azotobacter to be present in Japanese soils 
if the pH was 6.0 or higher, but not within the range of 4.0 - 
3.3* Martin (37) was unable to isolate azotobacter from 
mountain meadow soils of Arizona where the pH range was 4*9 - 

6.2 Milne (60), working with Saskatchewan soils, found viable 

were 

azotobacter in all but two soils. These/acids soils of pH 3.6 
and 3.0. 

Starkey and De (69) isolated a new species which 
they named Azotobacter indicum . It was capable of fixing 
atmospheric nitrogen at reactions ranging from pH 3 .0-9.0. 

Altson (4) reported isolating a few strains of azotobacter from 
Malayan soils which tolerated reactions as low as pH 3.6. The 
strains were not active, however, when inoculated into suitable

(e) Effect of Moisture 

As reviewed by Lipman and Sharp (52) Krainsky found 
that nitrogen-fixing flora were able to fix nitrogen when the 
soil contained less than one-fourth of the optimum moisture 
content. Lipman and Sharp (52), using a light sandy soil, found 
that 20 - 24 percent moisture, on air-dry basis, was the optimum 
moisture for nitrogen-fixation. 

Greaves (28) reports that Lipman and Burgess found 
that soils after being air-dried and kept in stoppered bottles 
for periods of 5 to 20 years still retained their nitrogen¬ 
fixing powers. Greaves (28) also states that Krainsky found 
soils should be damp but not wet for maximum nitrogen-fixation, 
and that Traaen gives the optimum moisture as 25 - 30 percent 
for a loam soil which he had used. Using calcareous loam 
Greaves (28) found the moisture content for maximum nitrogen- 
fixation to lie between 15 and 22 percent. He also found 
that if too large a quantity of water is supplied there is a 
tendency to depress the total nitrogen fixed. 

(f) Effect of Individual Ions 

A considerable amount of research has been reported 
regarding the role played by various elements in nitrogen-fixa¬ 
tion by azotobacter. If there is any literature concerning 
the effect that various elements have upon the growth of 
Clostridium pasteurianum, it is unknown to the author. There¬ 
fore, any reference to the stimulating or retardation effects 
that different ions have upon nitrogen-fixation deals only with

azotobacter. 

The well-known azotobacter (plaque) test for phos¬ 
phate deficiency readily shows that azotobacter are sensitive 
to phosphorous deficiencies, Greene (32) cites Staklasa*s 
research, which indicates that 3.0 - 3.7 milligrams of nitrogen 
are fixed for every gram of phosphorous used. The minimum 
required was found to be 2.46 milligrams of phosphorous per 
gram of glucose consumed. Ziemiecka (86) added phosphate to 
soils low in soluble phosphate and obtained an increase in 
azotobacter activity. Katznelson (43) showed that phosphate 
fertilization of soils enhanced the ability of a soil to support 
azotobacter growth. 

Bortels (8) was the first to observe and report that 
molybdenum and vanadium increased nitrogen fixation by azoto¬ 
bacter. For molybdenum the increase was as much as a hundred 
fold. Optimum concentration for molybdenum was found to be 
1:300,000 and for vanadium 1:100,000,000 up to 1:230,000. 
Steinberg (70) using purified nutrient solutions also found 
that molybdenum stimulated nitrogen-fixation by azotobacter. 
Horner et al (33) found that different strains of Azotobacter 
vinelandii varied considerably in their molybdenum requirements. 
Horner et al (23) also showed that vanadium could actually 
replace molybdenum. 

In 1949 Iordan and Anderson (43) found that boron 
had a stimulating effect upon the nitrogen-fixing powers of 
azotobacter. Silty clay loam, gravelly loam and sandy loam 
contained in pots were treated with borax at rates up to 160

pounds per acre. Upon plating onto nitrogen-free agar the 
soil from the treated pots gave increase:* in nitrogen values, 
up to 100 percent, over the untreated. Jordan and Anderson 
(43) also claimed that broth cultures inoculated with Az . 
ohroococcum and treated with varying amounts of boron showed 
significant increases in nitrogen fixed after seven days incu¬ 
bation. The optimum amount was 3*5 to 7 p.p.m. boron. The 
same results were found when using agar plates inoculated with 
Az. chroococoum . 

Greaves (27) inoculated a liquid medium with a soil 
low in sulfate and found the azotobacter growth to be scant 
and light of color. However, upon the addition of sulfates 
to the soil, before inoculation, a profuse brown chocolate 
growth could be seen. It appeared that sulfates were a stimu¬ 
lant for azotobacter growth. Greaves et al (31) applied 
varying amounts of Na2S0^, K^SO^, CaSO^, MgSO^, MnSO^ and 
Fe2(S0^)^ to soil contained in tumblers. They found: (1) MgSO/^ 
and ?e2<20^)3 failed to stimulate nitrogen-fixation at any 
concentration, (2) M118O4 had very little beneficial effect, 

(3) the rest of the sulfates did stimulate nitrogen-fixation. 
Greaves and Anderson (29) used eighteen different sulfur 
compounds, including inorganic and organic, and found: (1) azoto¬ 
bacter cannot oxidize a sulfur compound to a sulfate, (2) the 
only form in which azotobacter can utilize sulfur is in the 
sulfate form. 

Winters (84) found with soil cultures in the labora¬ 
tory that: (1) nitrogen fixation was stimulated by adding

30 - 100 p.p.m. sodium nitrate or calcium nitrate, (2) 300 
p.p.m. of sodium nitrate decreased nitrogen fixation. 

Gainey ( 23 ) found that: (l) high concentrations of sodium 
nitrate tended to depress nitrogen-fixation and azotobacter 
population, (2) decrease varied with different soils, (3) the 
sensitivitjr is due to the nitrate ion and not the sodium or 
calcium, (4) when urea was added, nitrogen-fixation was 
depressed only after nitrification of the urea took place. 

Zoond, as reviewed by Thompson ( 72 ) found that concentrations 
over 300 p.p.m. of nitrate nitrogen depressed nitrogen-fixation. 

Efficiency of nitrogen-fixation was shov/n by Hills 
(34) to decrease upon adding available combined nitrogen. 

Numbers of azotobacter increased but amount of nitrogen fixed 
did not increase proportionally.* 

Burk and Lineweaver ( 11 ), using the Warburg respi¬ 
rometer showed that calcium or strontium is essential to 
nitrogen fixation in pure cultures. Martin ( 37 ) showed that: 

(1) water soluble sodium and calcium contents of the soil 
were closely related to azotobacter activity, (2) the maximum 
limit for fixation in presence of sodium and calcium was 
around 3,000 p.p.m. 

As reviewed by Stephenson ( 71 ) both Rosing and Burk 
showed that nitrogen-fixation was markedly improved by the 
presence of iron. 

Lewis and Powers ( 49 ) have shown that iodine 
increases the growth rate of azotobacter. 

It appears from the above review that azotobacter

are like many other organisms in that they require an assort¬ 
ment of elements for their nutrition. 

(5) Importance of Non-symbiotic Nitrogen Fixation 

The beneficial effect of symbiotic fixation of 
nitrogen under field conditions can be easily demonstrated. 
However, the value and the amount of nitrogen fixed non- 
symbiotically, under field conditions, are still subject to 
doubt. 

They are subject to doubt because of three facts: 

(1) under natural conditions and farming practices the soil 
often receives very little of the type of energy material 
that can be utilized by the non-symbiotic nitrogen fixers, 

(2) since the soil contains a mixed bacterial flora, compe¬ 
tition for this small amount of utilizable energy will exist, 

(3) if any gain in the soil nitrogen is made, it is often 
not large enough to b© measured by ordinary quantitative 
analysis. 

Waksman and Starkey (78) say that it has been 

stated that in some soils as much as 40 pounds per acre of 

nitrogen annually has been nonsymbiotically fixed. Lipman (53) 

states that under ordinary conditions non-symbiotic nitrogen- 

fixation may amount to no more than a few pounds per acre each 

year. However, under s uitable conditions it may account for 

as much as fifty pounds of nitrogen per acre each year. Lipman 

(53) estimates that in the United States during 1930, there 

were 2,205,326,910 lbs. of non-symbiotically fixed nitrogen 
the 

added to/367,554,485 acres of harvested crop area.

This estimate approximately equals 6 pounds per acre. 

Almost from the time that non-symbiotic nitrogen¬ 
fixing bacteria were first isolated scores of workers have 
tried to ascertain the beneficial effect of inoculating 
soils and crops with azotobacter. Allison (1) states that 
"Azotogen”, which is a commercial preparation of Azotobacter 
chroococcum in a peat-soil-calcium-carbonate mixture, was 
used on 5 million acres of crops in the U.S.3.R. in 1942. 
Allison (1) also states that Soviet investigators began 
their inoculating trials about 1928, and since that time 
have made some startling claims. According to Allison (1) 
Sheloumova obtained average yield increases of 24 percent 
for mustard, corn and tobacco grown upon unlimed inoculated 
soils. For wheat and oats Savostin obtained average yield 
increases of 25 percent. Many soil bacteriologists in the 
Western Hemisphere have tried to duplicate the Russian suc¬ 
cesses but have failed. 

In 1923 Gainey (21), at Kansas, began a 20 year 
experiment to gain information on the following points: what 
factors influence the longevity of azotobacter after being 
inoculated into a soil from which it was absent* (2) what 
effect has the introduced azotobacter on the soil’s prod¬ 
ucing ability! The selected soil had a pH of 5.8 and from 
data collected during the experiment he concluded: (1) the 
addition of super-phosphate at the rate of 1,000 pounds per 
acre, did not influence the longevity of azotobacter, (2) the 
addition of superphosphate and lime, to give a pH of 6.5, 
enabled the azotobacter to survive throughout the 20 years ?

(3) the azotobaoter did not influence the crop yield, (4) 
the nitrogen balance of the soil was not affected, 

Allison et al (2) conducted greenhouse experiments, 
dealing with the effect of azotobaoter inoculation and found 
that inoculation gave no increase in yields for kali, barley, 
rape, rye and Swiss chard. For more evidence which contra¬ 
dicts the statements of the Soviet scientists the author 
refers those who are interested to Allison’s (l) excellent 
review of the subject. 

Part II - Decomposition of Plant Residue 

(1) Decomposition of the Plant as a Whole 

Waksman and Starkey (78) claim that immediately 
after the incorporation of plant residue in the soil, provided 
favorable conditions of moisture and aeration exist, it is 
attacked by a great variety of microorganisms. These micro¬ 
organisms consist of bacteria, fungi, actinomycetes, protozoa, 
worms and insect larvae. 

Waksman and Starkey (78) also state that the sequence 
in which the plant substances disappear by decomposition is 
as follows: (1) water-soluble substances, (2) starches, 

(3) protein, (4) hemicelluloses, (3) cellulose, (6) lignin, 

(7) fats, (8) waxes. 

From the above statement it would appear that an 
increase in structural complexity of a plant substance often 
results in a slower bacterial decomposition. 

As reviewed by Waksman and Starkey (78) the water- 
soluble substances such as sugars decompose within a few days.

Within 10 - 20 days only a portion of the cellulose, most 
of the lignin and a large part of the waxes and fats remains. 

According to MacBeth and Scales (39) cellulose may 
he decomposed either under anaerobic or aerobic conditions. 
The anaerobic process falls into two groups: (1) without 
the presence of nitrate the cellulose may undergo a hydrogen, 
or methane fermentation, (2) with nitrates present denitri¬ 
fying bacteria may decompose it with liberation of water and 
carbon dioxide. The aerobic process is divided according to 
the reaction of the medium: (1) if slightly alkaline certain 
aerobic bacteria will play the principal role, (2) if acid, 
the fungi are responsible for the cellulose destruction. 

Stephenson (71) mentions that cellulose is broken 
down in two stages: 

cellulase cellobiase 

Cellulose—— -> Cellobiose---—-^glucose. 

The two enzymes, cellulase and cellobiase, are 
present in cellulose decomposing organisms. 

Waksman and Starkey (78) state that only certain 
groups of Basidiomycetes and Actinomyces are able to attack 
lignin, and their action is very slow. Under anaerobic 
conditions lignin does not decompose. 

(2) Factors Influencing Plant Decomposition 

Waksman e t al (79) found that pure cultures of 
facultative-thermophilic organisms were less active than a 
mixed culture when used to decompose compost. 

Waksman et al (77) found that temperatures had the 
following influence upon the decomposition of composts:

(1) at 73°C; fungi were completely repressed. Actinomycetes 
were seldom present. The active bacteria were the hemicellulose 
decomposers, (2) at 65°C; fungi were still repressed. 

Thermophilic actinomycetes and bacteria were the predominant 
organisms. (3) at 30 °C; the most rapid decomposition took 
place. A mixed population containing thermophilic bacteria, 
actinomycetes and fungi were very active, (4) at 28°C; a 
heterogeneous population composed of bacteria, actinomycetes, 
fungi, protozoa and nematods was present. 

Waksman and Starkey (78) state that the optimum 
soil moisture for maximum bacterial development is between 30 
and 70 percent of the moisture holding capacity. 

Dubos (13) found that: (1) cellulose decomposing 
actinomycetes, in neutral soils, have an optimum moisture of 
30 percent saturation, (2) cellulose decomposing bacteria 
in neutral soils or slightly alkaline soils have an optimum 
moisture of 60 to 80 percent saturation, (3) cellulose decom¬ 
posing fungi have an optimum moisture of 30 to 90 percent 
saturation (4) in normal soils kept under water, a lag period 
of 14 to 16 days is required before active decomposition of 
cellulose takes place. 

Waksman (76) reports that nitrogen has the following 
influence upon decomposition of plant residue: (1) cereal 
straws which contain 0.2 - 0.3 percent nitrogen require the 
addition of available nitrogen for rapid decomposition, 

(2) if plant residue contains more than 1.3 or 1.7 percent of 
nitrogen ammonia will be liberated, (3) when the nitrogen 
content is less than 1.3 percent very little ammonia is liberated.

PURPOSE AND OUTLINE OF INVESTIGATION 


The work reported here was undertaken to determine 
the distribution, the activity and the beneficial action of 
the non-symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria in some of the soils 
located in Alberta’s four major soil zones. 

The four major soil zones of Alberta are separated 
on the basis of soil color and vegetation. The brown soil 
zone occupies all of south-eastern Alberta and is characterized 
by low precipitation and high evaporation. To the west and 
north of the brown zone is the dark brown zone which is char¬ 
acterized by having a slightly higher precipitation, resulting 
in denser and taller growth of grasses than in the brown zone. 
The black zone, which is found to the west and north of the 
dark brown zone, has an average precipitation of about 18 inches 
and is mostly tall grass land with many scattered woodland areas 
within its boundaries. The grey wooded zone, lying west and 
north of the black zone, is characterized by a fairly cool 
climate and is generally fairly heavily wooded with decidious 
and evergreen trees. 

A more detailed description of these zones may be 
obtained from n Soil Zones of Alberta”, a map which is distri¬ 
buted by the Extension Department, University of Alberta. 

The district and texture of the soils collected were 
as follows: 

(1) Edmonton clay loam. 

(2) Winterburn fine sandy loam. 

(3) Blue Ridge fine sandy loam.

In general, the work reported in this thesis can be 
divided into four parts. These parts are as follows: 

(1) Sand Cultures Inoculated With Soil 

Sterilized sand cultures variously treated, were 
inoculated with soil and used to determine: (1) the relative 
nitrogen-fixing powers of different soils, (2) the influence 
of the incubation period upon nitrogen fixation, (3) the 
influence of soil depth upon nitrogen fixation, (3) the 
essentiality or the non-essentiality of taking replicate compo¬ 
site samples in the field to obtain a more reliable value of 
a soil’s nitrogen-fixing power, (6) the relative quantities 
of nitrogen fixed when the amount of inoculum (soil) was 
varied, (7) the influence of mannitol concentration on nitro¬ 
gen fixation. 

(2) Sand Cultures Inoculated With a Soil-Straw Mixture 

Here, sterilized sand cultures were inoculated with 
a soil-straw mixture to determine whether or not the byproducts 
of various decomposing straws are beneficial for nitrogen 
fixation. 

(3) Soil Cultures Containing Straw 


Various straws were added to unsterilized soil

cultures. These experiments were conducted for the purpose 
of gaining information on the probability of non-symbiotic nitrogen 
fixation under field conditions, paying particular attention 
to the following points: (l) does decomposing straw aid 
nitrogen fixation? (2) will irrigated soils fix more or less 
nitrogen than non-irrigated soils? (3) does water logging 
a soil alter nitrogen fixation? 

(4) Bacteriological Examination 

Attempts were made to isolate azotobacter from all 
soils used in these experiments. Also to obtain the relative 
amounts of nitrogen fixed when pure cultures of these azotobacter 
were inoculated into sterilized sand cultures.

MATERIALS AND METHODS 


(1) Soil Sampling 

(a) Samples Collected For Sand Culture Inoculation and 

Bacteriological Examination 

Where soil samples were taken from non-irrigated 
areas, the location was so selected that virgin and cultivated 
samples could be taken from adjacent soils. In the irrigated 
areas the virgin, the cultivated irrigated and the cultivated 
non-irrigated soils were sampled only if a canal separated 
the cultivated irrigated from the cultivated non-irrigated 
soil and the virgin bordered either the cultivated non- 
irrigated or the cultivated irrigated. 

These precautions, in selecting a sampling site, 
were used to insure a uniformity between the virgin and culti¬ 
vated soils; thus any disclosed differences in nitrogen fixation 
would not be the fault of soil variation, but probably due 
to cultural practices. 

Once the site had been chosen duplicate composite 
samples, designated A and'B, were taken at a depth of 0 - 6 
inches and at a depth of 6 - 12 inches. A composite sample 
consisted of soil from three different holes. 

All holes were dug with a shovel that had been 
thoroughly scoured with the soil being sampled. The exposed 
profile (0 - 12 inches) was then sampled, at the two above 
mentioned depths, with a sterilized spoon, the dislodged soil

being placed in a sterilized pan. When the pan contained 
the three samples (composite sample) the contents were well 
mixed and a suitable portion of the soil was transferred to 
sterilized 500 ml. erlenmyer flasks. Following the sampling 
the erlenmyers, with their contents, were brought to the 
laboratory for air-drying. The air-dried soil was then finely 
ground, by using a sterilized mortar and pestle, and returned 
to its erlenmyer. 

In spite of gathering soil samples by using the 
above aseptic methods it was realized that because of air 
contamination, perfectly aseptic conditions are difficult to 
maintain. 

(b) Samples Collected For Soil Cultures 

The large samples required for this experiment made 
it necessary to abandon the aseptic techniques and gather the 
soil in jute sacks. Here grinding was accomplished in an ore 
pulverizer which was sterilized between samples with 5% mer¬ 
curic chloride. 

(2) Sand Cultures 

Forty-five or fifty grams of thoroughly washed 
Ottawa white sand placed in 300 ml. erlenmeyer flasks were 
used as a base for the cultural medium. Previous to inocu¬ 
lating with the soil, or soil-straw culture, the flasks and 
contents were autoclaved at 15 pounds steam pressure for 
thirty minutes. 

Sterilized spatulas and weighing dishes were used 
to add the inoculum, which was distributed amongst the sand

base by gently agitating the flask. 

Following the addition of the inoculum, 10 ml. of 
sterile nitrogen-free solution were added to each flask. 

The solution medium used is that described by Fred and Waksman 
( 19 ), modified to contain the following constituents: 


Mannite C^HgtOH )5 ..20.0 grams 

Magnesium sulfate MgS04 # 7H20.. • 0.2 

Dipotassium phosphate K^HPO^ . 0.2 " 

Sodium chloride NaGl.0.2 n 

Calcium sulfate CaS 0 / f * 2 H 20 0.1 ” 

Calcium carbonate CaC 03 ..5*0 " 

Distilled water .. 1000.0 tf 


Ten milliliters of this nutrient solution, the 
quantity used for the sand cultures, would contain 0.2 grams 
mannite. Where flasks contained 0.4 grams and 0.8 grams of 
mannite, the above solution contained 40.0 grams and 80.0 
grams of mannite respectively. In the case where flasks 
contained only water plus essential inorganic elements, the 
above solution, without mannite, was used. 

Using soil alone as the inoculum the amounts were 
either.0.1 grams or 0.5 grams. Six inoculated flasks, using 
the same amount of inoculum, were set up for each composite 
soil sample. Upon adding the nutrient solution two flasks 
were immediately sterilized to be used as controls. Generally 
the incubation period was 28 days. However, to ascertain what 
influence incubation periods had upon nitrogen fixation, a 
few sets were incubated 49 days and then compared with the

28 day incubated sets. All flasks were incubated in anhydro 
incubators where the temperature was approximately 28°C. 

When a soil-straw mixture was used as the inoculum, 
the amount of the mixture added was 5.0 grams or 7.5 grams; 
here 8 flasks were inoculated and three of the eight flasks 
were sterilized for controls. The incubation period was 
always 28 days and the flasks were incubated in cupboards at 
room temperature. 

To prepare the soil-straw inocula, two soils, 

Edmonton and Winterburn, were used. Five straws, namely, 
wheat, oats, barley, flax and alfalfa were finely ground and 
added at two rates. The rates were so calculated that the soil- 
straw mixture contained 2 and 33 percent of straw. 

After the straw had been added to the soil it was 
necessary to thoroughly mix the two. It was found from 
experience (about 200 results had to be discarded) that if 
the original preparation was not thoroughly mixed the nitrogen 
contents of the controls, for each set, were very variable. 
However, inocula taken from well mixed soil-straw mixtures 
gave excellent replication. 

The soil-straw inocula containing 2 percent straw 
were added in two conditions. The first consisted of the 
mixture after it had been incubated 42 days at 60 percent of 
the total water holding capacity. The object of this was to 
ascertain whether or not partly decomposed straw would have 
enough remaining energy sources to stimulate nitrogen fixation. 
The second consisted of the soil-straw inoculum immediately

after it had been mixed. 

In the case of the soil-straw inoculum that contained 
33 percent straw, the inoculum was not previously incubated to 
partly decompose the straw. 

For both conditions checks (no straw added to the 
soil) were set up. Hence the check for the 42-day previous 
incubation, was soil alone that had been incubated at 60 percent 
of the total water holding capacity for 42 days before using 
as an inoculum. 

After inoculating with the soil-straw mixture, four 
solution treatments were employed. Besides the solution treat¬ 
ment of water alone, water plus essential inorganic elements, and 
water plus essential inorganic elements plus two levels of 
mannite, were used. The essential inorganic elements were 
added to replace any element deficiency that may have been 
present in the soil. The mannite solutions were added to 
determine whether or not the nitrogen-fixing organisms could 
utilize energy under these conditions. Consequently mannite 
solutions were not generally added to all five straws. Using 
the soil-straw inoculum containing 2 percent straw, the mannite 
solutions y/ere added only to the check (no straw), a cereal 
(wheat), and a legume (alfalfa). Where the soil-straw mixture 
inoculum contained the higher percentage of straw (33 percent) 
the mannite solutions were added to all straws. 

All of the above mentioned inocula when placed under 
these apparently suitable conditions for growth should reflect 
the suitability of such soils or soil-straw mixture as

habitats for the nitrogen-fixing organisms. 

All flasks containing sand cultures were checked 
every two weeks for loss of weight due to evaporation, and 
sterile distilled water was added to bring flasks up to their 
original weight. 

(5) Soil Cultures Containing Straw 

For these experiments finely ground straw at the 
rate of 5 percent was added to large quantities, generally 
about 3000 grams, of air-dried soil. After very thoroughly 
mixing the straw and soil, 130 gram portions were placed in 
300 ml. erlenmyer flasks, and enough solution medium was added 
to bring the moisture content up to 60 percent of the water 
holding capacity (air-dry basis). For irrigated soils that 
have been accustomed to large amounts of water two levels of 
moisture were used; 60 percent and 105 percent of the water 
holding capacity (air-dry basis). The latter moisture content 
was used to determine the amount of nitrogen fixed under 
anaerobic conditions. 

Immediately after adding the solution, five 5 
gram portions (air-dry basis) of the soil-straw mixture were 
removed for nitrogen analysis. This left the flask containing 
105 grams of the original air-dried soil-straw mixture. The 
flasks were then incubated at room temperature for 35 days 
at the end of which time another five replicates were removed 
for nitrogen analysis. 

In the case of the controls (soil without straw) 

125 grams were added to the flasks. Therefore, after the

removal of the quantity for nitrogen determination, the flask 
would contain 100 grams of soil (air-dry basis). 

Since these large samples of soil should contain 
numerous nitrogen-fixing organisms, the solution medium was 
so calculated that each 103 gm. of the soil-straw mixture 
and each 100 gm. of soil alone (check) received twice as much 
of the essential inorganic elements as the sand cultures. 

Where mannite was added the rates were 0.8 gm. and 1.6 gm. 
per flask. 

For every flask set up in these experiments an 
identical amount of incubating material (103 grams for the straw 
treated and 100 grams for the control) were placed in "Gem” 
quart sealers. The purpose of this latter set was to determine 
the amount of carbon dioxide evolved during the incubation 
period. 

(4) Bacteriological Examination 

For the isolation of azotobacter, about 2 grams of 
soil were inoculated into 20 ml. of the above solution contained 
in 300 ml.erlenmyer flasks. After about three days the culture 
which developed in the medium was sub-Cultured into fresh medium 
and the. process repeated two or three times. At this stage 
the culture was plated onto nitrogen-free mannite agar plates. 
Any typical azotobacter colonies then found were transferred 
to slants for refrigerator storage. 

The controls consisted of the same additives, only 
here the flask was sterilized after the soil inoculation and 
then seeded with 1 ml. of a pure azotobacter culture. In this

way it was possible to ascertain from the absence or presence 
of growth whether the non-presence, which frequently occured, 
of azotobacter was due to adverse conditions present in the 
solution. 

(3) Analytical Methods and Calculations 

(a) Nitrogen Determinations 

Total nitrogen (organic nitrogen plus nitrate nitrogen) 
was determined by the modified Kjeldahl method, Lincoln and 
Walton (30), making use of zinc dust as the nitrate reducer. 

The boric acid method of Scales and Harrison (67) was used for 
the recovery of the distilled ammonia. For the sand cultures 
containing 0.1 and 0.3 grams of inoculum N/30 sulfuric acid 
was used to make the titrations. In the case of 3 gram soil- 
straw inocula N/14 sulfuric acid was used. 

The average for the controls, in each set, were 
subtracted from each treated flask to obtain the amount of 
nitrogen fixed in each flask. 

(b) Determination of Carbon Dioxide Evolved and Organic 

Matter Lost in Soil Cultures 

The method of determining the amount of carbon 
dioxide evolved by soil cultures during their 33 day incubation 
period was essentially that used by Norman and Lewis (61). 

The evolved carbon dioxide was absorbed by N/2 NaOH contained 
in L-oz. bottles resting on short glass rods which were on the 
soil surface. To make quart sealers air tight the tops were 
screwed on tightly. 

Each day for the first two weeks, followed by every

other day for the remainder of the incubation period, the 
4-oz. bottles were removed and BaGlg was added to precipitate 
the carbonates. The excess base was then titrated with N/2 
HC1. The sealers were left open while fresh NaOH was being 
added to the 4-oz bottles thus allowing fresh air to enter and 
insure an adequate supply of oxygen. 

The amount of carbon dioxide given off by the soil 
in a 24 or 48-hour period was calculated; one cubic centimeter 
of N/2 NaOH will absorb 0.0110 grams of carbon dioxide. 

Many authors including Lunt (56) state that multi¬ 
plying carbon dioxide by the conventional factor 0.471 is the 
most reliable method for determining the amount of organic 
matter present in soils. Its reliability is based upon the 
fact that soil organic matter averages close to 58 percent in 
content of carbon. Consequently this method was used to deter¬ 
mine the amount of organic matter lost by the soil cultures 
during their incubation period. 

The apparent necessity of knowing the amount of 
organic matter lost can be clarified by the following hypoth¬ 
etical example: Suppose 100 grams of a soil-straw mixture 
contains 0.400 grams of nitrogen. Here the percentage nitrogen 
would be 0.400 percent. After incubation the soil-straw 
mixture may have lost 3*0 grams of organic matter and still not 
have gained in nitrogen content; thus upon analysis one would 

find .0*400 j 100 s 0.412 percent nitrogen. 

97 

This would represent an erroneous increase in 
nitrogen and probably would be attributed to nitrogen fixation.

To make the necessary corrections the author deter¬ 
mined: ( 1 ) the oven dry wt. of the air dry soil-straw mixture 

being placed in the flasks, ( 2 ) the amount of organic matter 
lost by this soil-straw mixture using the above method. 

An example of the calculations is as follows: 

(1) 105.0 grams of air dry soil-straw mixture weighs 102.4 grams 
(oven dry). 

(2) During the 35 day incubation period the soil lost 5.82 grams 
of CO 2 or 5.82 x 0.471 = 2.74 grams of organic matter. 

(3) After incubation this soil-straw mixture would have weighed 
102.4 - 2.74 ” 99.66 grams (oven dry). 

( 4 ) Therefore, each oven dried gram, after incubation, analyzed 

for nitrogen should have weighed 1 x 102.4 = 1.028 grams 

99 .6 

before incubation. 

(5) A five gram sample (the approximate amount used for 
analysis) would have weighed 5 x L.028 = 5.140 grams 
before incubation. 

(c) Statistical Analysis 

Statistical analysts for data presented in this 
thesis were computed as described by Goulden ( 26 ).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 


Except for Table I the results presented and dis¬ 
cussed here are divided into the same sections as mentioned 
under the heading, "Purpose and Outline of Investigation.” 

Table I presents the results of two laboratory- 
analyses which were conducted on the soils under study. Although 
it is far from being a complete analysis, it gives the two 
factors which largely affect nitrogen fixation: (1) the red¬ 
action of the soil, and (2) the nitrogen content of the soil. 

The reaction, as surveyed in the literature review, is useful 
in corroborating the absence or presence of azotobacter. The 
nitrogen content of a soil should affect the quantity of 
nitrogen fixed for as the quantity of available nitrogen increases 
the amount fixed decreases. 

Virgin and cultivated soils (see Table I) from the 
brown zone have an average pH of 7*3 and 7.2 respectively. For 
the dark brown zone the virgin and cultivated soil averaged 7.0 
and 7.1 respectively. For the black zone the average pH is 
6.3 and 6.0 respectively, and for the grey-wooded soil zone the 
average pH is 3*3 and 3.1 respectively. These average pH 
results would indicate that only the soils from the brown and 
dark brown zones fall v^ell within the range of pH 6.3 - 8.6 
given by Fred and Davenport (18) as optimum for aerobic nitrogen¬ 
fixing bacteria. 

For all soils the nitrogen content averages 63 percent 
higher for the virgin than for the cultivated soil. This great

difference, especially where five grams is used as the amount 
of inoculum, may account for less nitrogen being fixed in the 
virgin than in the cultivated. 

( 1) Sand Cultures Inoculated With Soil 

The results of these experiments are presented in 
Tables II -VIII. Quadruplicate results are given in order to 
reveal the degree of variation evident between cultures. Each 
figure represents the amount of nitrogen fixed per flask after 
deducting the amount present in the sterilized controls. 

In Table II are the results of adding 0.3 gm. of 
Edmonton, Winterburn and Breton soils to sand cultures, receiving 
10 ml. of a solution containing essential inorganic elements 
and 0.2 gm. of mannite. The analysis of variance carried out 
on the milligrams of nitrogen fixed per gram of mannite indicate 
that duplicate differences are not significant. This would 
imply that single composite samples are as reliable as duplicate 
composite samples when determining the nitrogen fixing power of 
a soil. Or in other words the nitrogen-fixing organisms of a 
given soil probably do not Vary significantly in numbers and 
kinds over a small area. The differences in the amount of 
nitrogen fixed by the three soils were not statistically signi¬ 
ficant. The statistical analyses reveal that cultivated soil 
from these three areas are significantly better nitrogen-fixing 
habitats than the virgin soils. The explanation for this 
difference may be: (1) since conditions in the sand cultures 
are largely aerobic, nitrogen-fixing organisms from cultivated 
areas have become better adapted to these conditions, 



Milligrams of Nitrogen Fixed per Gram of Mannlte In Soil-Sand 

Cultures Following Inoubatlon for Periods of 28 Days and 49 Days at 28°C. 

One-half gm. portions of Edmonton, Winterhurn and Breton soils were mixed with 50 gm. 
sand and treated with 10 ml. of a solution containing essential inorganic elements 
and 0.2 gm. mannite.

(2) cultivation may have introduced more or better strains of 
nitrogen-fixing organisms, or (3) the lower nitrogen content of 
cultivated soil induces the nitrogen-fixing organisms to utilize 
atmospheric nitrogen. There was markedly less nitrogen fixed 
in the virgin than the cultivated soils for Edmonton and Breton, 
but there was less difference in the case of Winterburn. This 
differential response was not statistically significant. Although 
depths are not significantly different, the data do suggest 
that the depths influence nitrogen fixation in sand cultures. 

This is emphasized by the fact that the 0” - 6” depth for 
Winterburn cultivated and Breton virgin is significantly better 
than the 6” - 12” depth. For Edmonton cultivated the reverse 
is true. This change in trend is reflected in soils x types 
x depths being statistically significant. The reverse condition 
occuring in the Edmonton cultivated may indicate that the 
lower depth for Edmonton cultivated is just as fertile as, 
or more fertile than, the upper depth. In the case where 
incubation is significant it suggests that a 28-day incubation 
period is sufficient to determine the amount of nitrogen fixed 
by these organisms. 

Table III presents the data where 0.3 gm. of Breton 
soil was used as inoculum. This experiment was designed to 
determine whether or not fertilization enhances nitrogen fixa¬ 
tion. Duplicates again are not statistically different. Since 
types are not statistically different it is apparent, using 
this method of determination, that fertilization does not 
stimulate nitrogen fixation. Unlike the data of Table II where

three soils were used, it may be seen that where the analysis 
is based only on Breton soil there is a statistically significant 
difference for depths. Apparently the 0” - 6" depth is superior 
to the 6" - 12" depth. Reasons for this difference may be: 

(1) as compared to Edmonton and Winterburn, Breton soil is a 
relatively unfertile soil. Consequently the trace elements 
that are needed for nitrogen-fixation, and not supplied by the 
nutrient solution, are more concentrated in the top six inches, 

(2) Breton soil is located in a relatively cool humid climate, 
hence the nitrogen-fixing organisms in the lower depths are 
not as efficient at fixing nitrogen at 28°C, as the organisms in 
the upper depth. This adaption to temperature has been pointed 
out by Greene (33) using Arizona soils, (3) Breton loam is the 
type of soil that bakes and puddles easily, therefore the 
nitrogen-fixing organisms from the upper depths have become 
better adapted to grow under aerobic conditions. Again incu¬ 
bations (28 and 49 days) are not statistically different. 

During the 49-day incubation period the ammonium sulphate 
treated plot and the virgin soil fixed more nitrogen than during 
the 28 day period. Eor the unfertilized and complete fertilizer 
treated plots the reverse occured. This is reflected in types 

x incubations being highly significant, but no explanation is 
apparent. 

Table IV presents the data using 0.1 gm. of Breton 
soil as inoculum. These results were not compared statistically 
with the results of Table III (0.3 gm. of inoculum). However, 
a comparison of both tables will reveal that the 0.3 gm. amount

of inoculum has given a 20-fold increase in nitrogen fixation. 

The reason for the difference may he : (1) the smaller amount 

of inoculum (0.1 gm.) would have resulted in fewer nitrogen¬ 
fixing organisms being introduced; thus competitive organisms 
have become predominant. However considering the fact that the 
solution medium is of an elective nature this explanation may 
be Questioned, (2) using an unfertile soil such as Breton, 0.1 
gm. of soil does not supply a sufficient amount of the necessary 
trace elements for maximum nitrogen fixation. Further evidence 
that a lack of trace elements caused the difference is emphasized 
by depths differences not being statistically significant for 
Table IV (0.1 gm. of inoculum), whereas in Table III (0.5 gm. 
of inoculum) depths differences were statistically significant. 
The statistical data of Table IV also reveals that fertilization 
is not beneficial for nitrogen fixation. Types have responded 
differently to depths, however, but no explanation can be 
offered. 

Table V presents the data using 0.1 gm. of Winterburn 
and Edmonton soil as inoculum. Although the difference is not 
as marked as in Breton soil, there is definitely a decrease 
in nitrogen fixed where 0.1 gm. inoculum is used instead of 0.5 
gm. (Table II). For Edmonton soil the average decrease is 
fairly large while for Winterburn it is a great deal larger. 

The difference in the soils, where 0.1 gm. is used, is also 
revealed in the fact that soil differences are highly statis¬ 
tically significant for the data in Table V. Because of its 
higher fertility it would be expected that Edmonton soil should

have the least decrease. Also of interest is the fact that the 
0" - 6 ff depth for Winterburn and Edmonton cultivated soil is 
significantly better than the 6" - 12 fl depth, while in the 
virgin, although not significant, the reverse is true. This 
is pointed out by types x depths being statistically significant. 
The stimulatory effect of cultivation is the probable explanation 
for the upper depth in the cultivated soil being better than 
the lower depth. The higher nitrogen content of the virgin 
soil f s upper depth may account for the reverse finding in these 
soils. 

Table VI presents the data using 0.1 gm. of Edmonton 
soil as inoculum. The flasks received solutions containing two 
levels of mannite; 0.2 gm. and 0.4 gm. The experiment v/as 
designed to ascertain how efficiently nitrogen-fixing organisms 
from Edmonton soil utilize mannite. 

The statistical analysis reveals that the nitrogen¬ 
fixing organisms from Edmonton soil in a mixed bacterial flora 
use mannite more efficiently when the smaller concentration is 
used. This difference is highly significant. It should be 
observed that the same average amount of nitrogen (see ave. 
solution) was fixed per flask, 0.816 milligrams, for both 0.2 gm. 
and 0.4 gm. of mannite. This would indicate that 0.2 gm. of 
mannite supplies as much energy for nitrogen fixation as 0.4 
gm. of mannite. As in Table V the trend for the differential 
response of types x depths is the same. 

Table VII presents the data for comparing the amount 
of nitrogen fixed by Blue Ridge and Acme soils. Although not

statistically compared with the data in Tables IV, V and VI 
(where 0.1 gm. of soil was also used for Breton, Winterburn and 
Edmonton) it does appear that Blue Ridge and Acme soils exhibit 
no difference in nitrogen fixation from the Breton soil. However, 
Winterburn and Edmonton soils, especially the latter, appear to 
fix more nitrogen, under these conditions, than do Blue Ridge and 
Acme soils. It would seem from the statistical analysis of the 
data in Table VTI that the nitrogen-fixing organism from the 
Blue Ridge and Acme soils do not vary significantly in their 
ability to fix nitrogen. The statistically significant interaction 
types x depths x soils appears to be of no value for interpreting 
the data. 

Table VIII presents data using 0.1 gm. of Duchess 
and Vauxhall soil as inoculum. Both of these soils are located 
in irrigated areas; therefore the experiment was designed to 
determine whether or not Irrigation benefits nitrogen-fixation. 

The analysis of variance carried out on the milligrams of 
nitrogen fixed per gram of mannite indicates that even for 
irrigated soils, where the nitrogen-fixing organisms are likely 
to be shifted about and collected in certain areas, taking 
duplicate composite field samples appears to be unnecessary. 

As in Breton soil nitrogen fixation is influenced by depth of 
soil sample. The 0 ,f - 6 t! depth is superior to the 6 n - 12”. 

This is statistically significant. Irrigation definitely has 
enhanced nitrogen fixation for Duchess soil. The increase is 
approximately 12 fold. Although not significantly different the 
reverse is true of Vauxhall soil. This differential response

may be the probable reason for this differential response, as

non-irrlgated or virgin soil, For the Vauxhall soil azotobaoter

The sain object of them exp®rim©ats was to determine 
the possibility that nitrogen**fixing organism© from Edmonton and 
Winterburn soils, in a. natural mixed bacterial flora, could 
utilize, as energy, the byproducts of different decomposing 
straw©, 

The results of thea© experiments are presented in 
Tables IX - XJXX, Tables IX and X are the results for the first 
portion of this investigation, which consisted of furnishing 
the nitrogen-fixing organisms with partly decomposed straw®. 

Table XX gives the results for six straws {no straw, 
wheat, oats, barley, alfalfa and flax.) receiving water alone

between the amount of nitrogen fixed or lost by the two soils

Milligrams of Nitrogen Fixed or Lost In Soil-Sand Cultures 

Following Incubation for 28 days at Room Temperature 


Five gm. portions of Winterburn and Edmonton soils, containing 2 % straw, were mixed with 50 gm. sand and treated with 10 ml. 
of various solutions. The soil with the straw was incubated 42 days at optimum moisture before the soil-sand cultures were

a significant loss in nitrogen when compared to the check and 
the other straws. This significant loss may be due to alfalfa 
having a higher protein content, thus greater ammonification has 
taken place. Oats is the only straw that has given a significant 
gain in nitrogen fixation by comparison with the check. This 
would indicate that partly decomposed oat straw releases 
utilizable nitrogen-fixing energy under these conditions. 

Effects of inorganic elements in solution are not significant. 

For soils x straws, soils x solutions, and straws x solutions 
there was no significant differential response. Although there 
was a significant differential response of straws in different 
soils and solutions (soils x straws x solution) no explanation 
is apparent. 

Table X presents the results for the investigation 
involving three straws (no straw, wheat and alfalfa) and four 
solutions. Again soils are not statistically different, but 
unlike the previous experiment straws did not produce statis¬ 
tically significant differences. As might be expected mannite 
has produced a marked increase in nitrogen-fixation; this 
difference is highly significant. The interaction soils x 
solutions is highly significant but this cannot be explained. 
There was more nitrogen fixed in the case of wheat and alfalfa 
straws in Winterburn soil than in Edmonton soil. This differ¬ 
ential response is reflected in a highly significant interaction 
for soils x straws. For solutions without mannite alfalfa has 
produced a significant nitrogen loss when compared to the check; 
however, in the presence of mannite alfalfa gave a significant 
increase in nitrogen. Apparently alfalfa in combination with

mannite results in more nitrogen fixed than mannite alone. 

Tables XI - XIII present the data for the second 
portion of this investigation. Here fresh soil-straw mixtures 
have been added to sand cultures. Table XI gives the data 
for water alone and water plus essential inorganic elements 
added to six straws (no straw, alfalfa, barley, wheat, oats 
and flax). It is of interest to note that effects of undecom¬ 
posed straws are not statistically significant, whereas effects 
of partly decomposed straws (Table IX) straws were significant. 
Thus one would conclude that various partly decomposed straws 
have different stimulatory effects, but fresh straws do not 
exhibit such differences. As in Table IX effects of solutions 
are statistically significant. Adding alfalfa, flax and barley 
resulted in a nitrogen loss in both soils, however, and the 
losses in Edmonton soil were significantly lower than the losses 
in Winterburn soil. This would suggest: (1) Edmonton soil 
contains more proteolytic bacteria, thus more ammonification 
has taken place, (2) or if ammonification were the same in both 
soils, the larger inherent nitrogen content of Edmonton soil has 
retarded atmospheric nitrogen fixation. Oats again appears 
to enhance nitrogen-fixation, Winterburn soil being significantly 
better than Edmonton. In both solutions there is a marked 
increase in nitrogen fixed for oats when compared to the check; 
this difference is highly significant. 

Table XII gives the data for four solutions added to 
three straws (no straw, wheat and alfalfa). Both mannite 
solutions resulted in highly significant increases in nitrogen

fixation. The difference between these two were negligible, 
which indicates that 0.2 gm. of mannite supplies about as much 
energy for nitrogen fixation as 0.4 gm. mannite. Water alone 
and water plus essential inorganic elements gave significant 
losses in nitrogen. This would definitely mean that straws 
without mannite supplied at the indicated rate do not supply 
available nitrogen fixing energy, but on the contrary seem to 
create conditions that promote ammonification or loss of nitrogen. 
Alfalfa straw in conbination with Winterburn soil is significantly 
better than in combination with Edmonton soil. Eor the Winterburn 
soil there was no significant difference between the 0.2 gm. 
and 0.4 gm. mannite solution. However for the Edmonton soil 
the 0.4 gm. mannite was significantly better than the 0.2 gm. 
mannite. This differential response may mean: (1) the 
nitrogen-fixing organisms from Winterburn soil utilize energy 
more efficiently than those from Edmonton soil, (2) or the 
other microorganisms in Edmonton soil are more competitive 
than those in Winterburn soil, (3) ammonification may have been 
greater in Edmonton soil, thus it required more nitrogen fixing 
energy to compensate for the losses. The interaction straw 
x solution is statistically significant, but cannot be inter¬ 
preted without further study. 

Table XIII presents the results for a freshly prepared 
Winterburn soil-straw mixture containing 33 percent straw and 
receiving four solutions. Since the amount of straw, used for 
this experiment, was very large in comparison to the other 
experiments, the quantity of mannite was doubled. Therefore,

instead of the usual 0.2 gm. and 0.4 gm. amounts, the two 
solutions now contained 0.4 gm. and 0.8 gm. The addition of 
alfalfa has resulted in a tremendous loss of nitrogen. Of the 
straws involved in the statistical analysis of these data only 
flax has given a significant loss in nitrogen. Barley, oats 
and wheat, when compared to the check, did not result in any 
significant change in the amount of nitrogen fixed. This would 
suggest that barley, oats and wheat added to sand cultures at 
the rates indicated do not stimulate nitrogen fixation. For 
flax and the check the addition of essential inorganic elements 
and the further addition of mannite produced a linear response 
with respect to nitrogen fixation. Although the trend was 
linear in the case of barley it was in the opposite direction. 
The response for oats, wheat and barley was irregular. This 
difference in response of the straws to the different solutions 
was statistically significant. The reason for this differential 
response is not apparent. This variation in response is further 
emphasized by the fact that differences between different 
solutions are not significantly different as a whole. 

(3) Soil Cultures Containing Straw 

Table J1V presents the results using Winterburn 
fine sandy loam as a soil culture. The percentage nitrogen 
obtained for each replicate, after 35-day incubation period, 
is reported in two ways. The first column reports the actual 
percentage nitrogen obtained. The second column reports 
percentage nitrogen after corrections for loss of organic matter 
had been applied. Statistical analysis of the data indicates

that straws are significantly different. This difference is 
attributable to the inherent nitrogen content of the straws. 
Apparently for the straws as a whole, nutrient solutions and 
incubations did not benefit nitrogen fixation. Comparing the 
corrected with the non-corrected results there was no instance 
in which the difference was statistically significant. For flax 
receiving water only and water plus essential inorganic elements, 
and for barley receiving water plus essential inorganic elements, 
and water plus essential inorganic elements plus 0.8 gm. mannite 
the uncorreeted value shows a significant nitrogen increase 
for the 35 day incubation period, whereas the corrected value 
shows no significant difference. For all straws receiving 
water plus essential inorganic elements and water plus essential 
inorganic elements plus 0.8 gm. mannite, the uncorrected value 
shows no significant loss in nitrogen while the corrected value 
shows a significant loss in nitrogen. These last two statements 
would imply that further experimentation and study is required 
to ascertain the necessity of correcting for the loss of 
organic matter. However, since it is a well know*fact that 
organic matter is lost during the decomposition of straw, any 
significant differences referred to here will be based on the 
corrected values. Alfalfa has given a significant nitrogen 
loss regardless of the solution applied. Flax, barley, oats 
and wheat have given a significant nitrogen increase when 
receiving water only and water plus essential inorganic elements. 
From a practical standpoint it is important to note that all 
of these straws except alfalfa have produced significant increases 
in nitrogen by comparison with the check soil to which no

straw was added. However, with the addition of 0.8 gm. of 
mannite, flax, barley, oats and wheat have not produced a 
significant nitrogen increase, and where 1.6 gm. of mannite was 
used only barley and wheat gave significant increases in 
nitrogen. Hence it would appear that under soil conditions, 
straw in combination with mannite is not superior to mannite 
alone as a rule. 

Table XV presents the results for Duchess irrigated 
and non-irrigated soil. Three straw treatments were added (no 
straw, wheat and barley). The solutions added were water alone, 
and water plus essential inorganic elements, which were added 
until 60 percent of the water holding capacity (air-dry basis) 
was reached. The portion of these soil-straw mixtures to be 
placed under anaerobic conditions then received distilled water 
until the moisture content was 105 percent of the water holding 
capacity (air-dry basis). All reported nitrogen analyses of 
replicates taken after the 35-day incubation period are reported 
as the corrected values. The difference between straws and the 
difference between soils is highly significant. As in Table 
XIV this difference is attributable to their inherent nitrogen 
content. Under both anaerobic and aerobic conditions, for strav/s 
as a whole, the 35-day incubation period has produced a signi¬ 
ficant loss of nitrogen. The amount of nitrogen lost under 
anaerobic conditions is significantly more than that lost under 
aerobic conditions. This would indicate that more ammonifica- 
tion takes place under field conditions if the soil is water 
logged assuming that the nitrogen is lost in the form of

ammonia* There is a significant difference between water 
plus essential inorganic elements and water alone. Apparently 
the essential inorganic elements have benefited nitrogen 
fixation or they have prevented greater ammonification or loss 
of nitrogen. If they have benefited nitrogen fixation it is 
probably due to the beneficial effect of the phosphorus, because 
the soils from the brown soil zone are known to be low in 
available phosphorus. 

As compared to the check (no straw), water (alone) 
in combination with barley or wheat and cultivated irrigated 
soil has given a significant decrease in nitrogen regardless of 
whether aerobic or anaerobic conditions were used. Hov/ever, 
where water plus essential inorganic elements was used no 
significant decreases occured. Under both conditions water (alone) 
added to the combination of barley and cultivated non-irrigated 
soil has given a significant decrease in nitrogen, whereas when 
added to the combination of wheat and cultivated non-irrigated 
soil no significant decrease in nitrogen occured. Water plus 
essential inorganic elements added to barley In combination with 
cultivated non-irrigated soil did not give a nitrogen decrease, 
but wheat under aerobic conditions did give a significant 
nitrogen-decrease. Water plus essential Inorganic elements 
added to wheat in combination with cultivated irrigated soil 
and under anaerobic conditions is the only combination that 
gave a significant increase in nitrogen. These changes in 
trends have caused the interaction soils x straws x incubations 
x solutions to be significant.

In reviewing the results of Table XIV and XV the 
analyses of variance indicate that it is possible to measure 
the nitrogen increases or decreases that occur in soil cultures* 
Apparently straws low in protein favor nitrogen fixation when 
added to Winterburn soil. However, in combination with Duchess 
soil there seems to be a decrease In nitrogen. This difference 
is hard to explain, because as revealed in a later experiment 
no azotobacter could be isolated from Winterburn soil, but they 
were isolated from the Duchess irrigated soil. Because of the 
fact that Duchess soil Is a silt loam, anaerobic conditions may 
have prevailed below the soil surface even where only 60 percent 
moisture was present thus preventing azotobacter from fixing 
nitrogen and if anaerobic nitrogen-fixing organisms were present, 
they were apparently unable to utilize the byproducts of decom¬ 
posing straw. Or, on the other hand, more proteolytic organisms 
may have been present in the Duchess than in the Winterburn soil, 
thus nitrogen fixation did not compensate for the loss due to 
ammonification. 

(4) Bacteriological Examination 

Attempts were made to isolate azotobacter from both 
depths in all soils used in this experiment. Inocula from all 
soils when introduced Into a nitrogen-free liquid medium formed 
a pellicle after two to three days of incubation. However only 
inocula from three soils produced profuse growths, whereas in 
the case of the other soils only scant growths were observed. 

The inocula that gave rise to heavy growths in the liquid 
medium were from Duchess cultivated irrigated, Vauaxtiall virgin 
and Vauxhall cultivated non-irrigated. Upon microscopic

examination of the pellicles it was found that only these 
three soils showed the presence of typical azotobacter cells. 

It was also found that upon plating onto nitrogen-free agar 
plates that these were the only cultures that produced typical 
azotobactercolonies. They were found in both soil depths. 

Although in all controls (sterile medium and soil 5 
inoculated with a pure culture of azotobacter) only a scant 
growth of azotobacter was observed, it should still indicate that 
no adverse conditions were present in any of these cultures. For 
as Waksman (76) states the absence of contaminants retards 
azotobacter growth. 

Table XVI gives the milligrams of nitrogen fixed per 
gram of mannite by pure cultures of these isolated a z otobacter. 
Only the azotobacter from the 0 Tt - 6 ,T depths were used. As 
shown in the Table these azotobacter were able to fix atmospheric 
nitrogen. However, apparently they show no significant differ¬ 
ences in nitrogen fixing ability. 

It is to be noted (see Table I) that azotobacter were 
only isolated from soils that have a pH that falls well within 
the range of 6.5 - 8.6 given by Fred and Davenport (18) as the 
optimum for aerobic nitrogen-fixing organisms. The reader may 
then wonder why azotobacter could not be found in Acme soil and 
in Duchess cultivated non-irrigated soil where the average pH 
is about 7.0. 

The presence of salts, which may be harmful, in these 
solonetz-like soils could be the probable answer. In the 
case of Duchess cultivated irrigated soil, irrigation water 
may ha^e removed the harmful salts or brought in strains of

TABLE XVI Milligrams of Nitrogen Fixed per Gram of Mannite 
in Sand Cultures Following Incubation for a 
Period of 21 Days at 28°C. 

One ml. of pure solution cultures of azotobacter that had 
been isolated from Duchess cultivated irrigated, Vauxhall virgi: 
and Vauxhall cultivated non-irrigated were used to inoculate 
50 gnu of sterile sand in 300 ml. erlenmyers. Each flask 
received 10 ml. of a solution containing essential inorganic 
elements and 0.2 gm. of mannite.

azotobacter that could grow under these conditions. 

The fact that azotobacter were absent from, Breton, 
Winterburn and Edmonton soil indicates that in sand cultures 
containing these soils other important nitrogen-fixing organisms 
are present. If further studies are carried out it would be 
interesting to determine what organisms these are.

SUMMARY 


(1) A study was mad© to determine some of the factors 
influencing the nitrogen-fixing powers of virgin and cultivated 
soils from the four major soil zones of Alberta. 

(2) It was found that single composite soil samples are 

as reliable as duplicate composite soil samples when determining 
the nitrogen fixing powers of these soils. 

(3) Experiments with sand cultures inoculated with soil 
or soil-straw mixtures showed that Vauxhall, Duchess, Acme, 
Edmonton, Winterburn, Breton and Blue Ridge soils vary in their 
ability to fix nitrogen. 

(4) More nitrogen was fixed in sand cultures inoculated 
with 0.5 gm. than with 0.1 gm. of soil. The less fertile the 
soil the greater was this difference. 

(5) In some cases it was found that virgin soil fixed 
markedly less nitrogen than the cultivated soil. 

(6) The 0" - 6 !t soil depth generally fixed more nitrogen 
than the-6" - 12" soil depth. 

(7) A 28-day incubation period seems to be as satisfactory 
as a 49-day period when determining the amount of nitrogen fixed 
by a given soil. 

(8) Breton soil treated with ammonium sulfate and complete 
fertilizer since 1930 fixed no more nitrogen than the untreated 


soil

(9) Irrigation waters apparently have improved nitrogen¬ 
fixing power in a solonetz-like Duchess soil. 

(10) The nitrogen-fixing organisms from Edmonton soil 
utilize mannite more efficiently when the mannite is in smaller 
coneentration. 

(11) Nitrogen-fixing organisms from Winterburn and Edmonton 
soil are able, under certain conditions, to utilize energy 
released from various decomposing straws. 

(12) Nitrogen is lost when alfalfa straw, without mannite, 
is added to sand and soil cultures. 

(13) Cereal straws, without mannite, when added to Winterburn 
cultivated soil aid nitrogen fixation. However, when added to 
Duchess cultivated and Duchess cultivated non-irrigated soil 
nitrogen is lost under the conditions of these experiments. 

(14) Essential inorganic elements (other than nitrogen) 
seemed to enhanced nitrogen fixation when added to Duchess soil, 
but no response was observed when added to other soils. 

(15) More nitrogen is lost during the period of incubation 
when Duchess soil is waterlogged than when it is maintained at 
an optimum moisture content.
