The purpose of the present study is to attempt 
to discern what effect varying audiences may have had on 
Shakespeare’s work as a playwright. The more familiar 
one becomes with Shakespeare’s plays, the more conscious 
one is of a difference in technique and tone which 
divides the plays into ty;o groups. A careful analysis 
of them points to the possibility that the dramatist 
wrote each play for a particular stage and a particular 
audience. A play written for presentation before the 
Queen and a select group of the aristocracy at Whitehall 
might be expected to differ in quality and technique 
from a play written for the motley crowd which frequented 
the Globe Theatre. 1 shall endeavor to establish that 
this difference did actually exist and that Shakespeare’s 
plays can be so divided. 









Chapter I 

A DESCRIPTION! OP PRIVATE A1TD PUBLIC TIP AT RES 
I--.- SHAKESPEARE* S THE 

We know from existing records that fixere were 
several types of stages available for the initial offer¬ 
ing of new plays. Many plays were first staged in one or 
other of the public theatres,--The Theatre., The Globe, 

The Fortune, The Curtain, The Swan, or the theatre 
He wington Butts, (l) The public theatres, it is assumed, 
were similar in structure and all cs,tered to the public in 
general. (2) Other plays were first presented at the 
3 1 , 

These theatres were private in name only, for they 
actually catered to anyone who could afford to pay a 
shilling for admittance. (3) The price, exorbitant in 
those days, insured a more cultured audience, but neitl j 
11 t ■ -h 11 ■ t 3 ? 50% y u it' ' 

when Blackfriars was taken over from the Children of the 
Revels, a company which had occupied it for ten years. (4)

The third type of stage was that, found at the court, and 
there is every likelihood that sone of Shakespeare’s 
plays were written for this type of ultra-private presen¬ 
tation* Plays were enacted at the Universities* There 
was evidently a private stage at Gray’s Inn in 1594 and 
one at the. Middle Temple in 1602 . It is very likely that 
plays were frequently presented in the homes of some of 
the prominent families though I have found no mention of 
records which substantiate the surmise. The point which 
I wish to stress is that Shakespeare was not confined to 
the public theatre. The differences between the public 
and private stages are fundamental in this discussion. 

Prom contemporary sketches, descriptions, and a 
builder’s specificati .. , 9 get a remarkably clear 

picture of the structure and plan of a typical public 
theatre. (l) Against one wall of the theatre, there was 
an inner stage or domus. The domus was provided with a 
curtain which remained drawn when this stage was not in 
use. On either side of the domus, there were tiring rooms 
with doors which opened to the outer stage and likely 
with entrances to the domus. In front of the domus, a 
wide outer stage projected half way across the yard. 
Twenty-seven feet separated the curtain of the domus of

the Fortune Theatre from the front of the outer stage. 


The same stage 

was 

f orty-thr< 

feet wide (

is no evidence 

reg 

nrding the 

width of the 

stage of the 

Globe Theatre, 

but 

since the 

Globe had an 

interna,! dia- 


meter of eighty-four feet, the stage must have measured 
f or ty -1wo feet to the fr on t of t he p 1 at e a . Above the 

there was a balcony. A roof, known as "the heavens’ 5 
extended over most of the outer stage and was supported 


near the front by two pillars. Above the heavens, there 
was a hut which held certain machinery for handling 
properties or for producing aerial effects. 

The walls of a public theatre must have been re¬ 
markably high for there was provision for three tiers of 


balconies around three sides of the building

is 


meant that part of the audience must have viewed the per¬ 


formances across the stage rather than from the front. 
There is evidence that the stage balcony was occasional 
used to seat certain important. members of the audience. 
(3) The bah conies were protected from the elements by 
an over-hanging roof, but the yard or id it where the

"groundlings 11 stood to view the play was open to the sun 
and rain. The entry fee to the Globe was one penny. To 
get into certain balcony booths, customers had to pay 
extra, (l). The choice balcony booths were those that 
looked down on the side of the stage for they were nearer 
to the stage and farther from the mob which crowded the 
pit. 

There is no record of a, first-performance of a 
Shakespearian play. We know with considerable certainty 
the public theatres in which the Burbage players were 
playing from time to time, and we have some degree of 
certainty regarding the dates when most of the plays were 
written. If we can determine the plays that were written 
for a public stage, we can perhaps assume in what theatre 
the play was first produced. S’or plays written for a 
private stage the problem is more difficult. Certainly 
very few if any of the plays could have been written for 
the stage in Blackfriars. According to Sir W. If. Chambers, 
the Company performed a play before Queen Elizabeth and 
her maids of honor at Blackfriars December 31* 1^02, (2) 
seven years before the Kings 1 2 s Men acquired the property. 

If his statement is correct, there may have been other

occasions when the Company used Blackfriars. Such co¬ 
ns, r, ust ve been rare, for the first 

Quarto to mention Blackfriars appeared in 1622 . We know 
that The Lord Chamberlain * r Company and later The King ! s 
Company were frequently called upon to present plays at 
11 . In four years from 1603 to 16 07 , there were 
forty plays presented at court (l). Information regard¬ 
ing the court entertainment's has been preserved in the 
expense .accounts of the Fast er of Bevels, lout only rarely 
was the name of the play mentioned. Some pi' . 
been written for presentation in the homes of the nobility

acted at the Middle Temple, February 2 , 1602 . ( 2 ) I 
suggest that during the winter season when the weather 


interfered with profitable activities in the public 
theatres, Shakespeare’s Company was kept busy with enter- 
fc 5 } t] adding their bit to winter 

festivities in the gay capital. I further suggest that 
certain plays might have been written for special occasions

The first private plays were almost certainly 
academic. The school stage which.specialized in classical 
plays was set up in an interior auditorial where space was 
The pattern of the stage had followed the classi¬ 
c-1 pi y from Italy, When the time came for the Queen’s

copied the classic stage as the more practical for 
t x* , x y . t 

likely he adopted for all private product ions and possibly, 
too, in the semi-private theatres such as 11. b i - 
the child performers rere under court sponsorship. (l) 

The description which Sir k. K, Chambers gives us 
of the court stage is actually an accumulation of much, 
scattered evidence. The size of an interior stage was, of 
arse, governed by the amount of space av h ’ . The 
Cockpit which was a small auditorium on the grounds of 
Whitehall and which was used for the presentation of plays

private stage was box-like as if the inner stage of the 
public theatre had been enlarged and. the outer apron all 
but cut away. Drapes of painted canvas were used exten¬ 
sively. Two or more lath and canvas domus were provided.

chosen to call the "entrance lapse.” The distinction 
results from the relative sizes of the public and 



































private staler, The public c tage extended so far into 
the centre of the theatre that persons at the forward 
end of the apron were as met as forty feet from the 
actors entering from the back of the stage. (1} 6on- 
tl; , actors on the stage could make prolonged and 
sometimes critical remarks about newcoJ rs on th 
before the newcomers could get within hearing distance 
cf them, A very good example of the entrance lapse 
occurs in An You hike It , 1, ii, 46. The foilowi 
logue intervenes between the entrance of Touchstone and 
his first remarks. He has come tc deliver a message* s . 
there is little likelihood of his pausing after his 
entrance.

Had Touchstone heard the converaation, he would surely 
have retaliated in true Touchstone style. He would be 
compelled to do so in order to remain in character. Such 
a lapse could not have been possible on a private stage, 
f*or tbe newcomer was never more than a. few feet from the 


rfcors already on the

Tue fact that examples of the entrance lapse are not 
numerous may suggest that most of the action occurred 
at or near the rear of the outer stage. 

The third point in the argument has t do with 
the do bus . In the public theatre, there was only tl 
one inner stage which could serve as a bedroom or inner 
chamber separate from the outer stage. There is no 
evidence that seoarate dorous were used as was the custom 
on the private stage though tents must have been Bitched 
on the apron for certain of the war scenes. Traverses 
- - 0 ' ' " la a : r ; 

could the lath and canvas dorus have been used because 
they would have interfered with the view of that part of 
r tlie audience whiph occupied the galleries on either side 
of the stage. The scheme could be used only when the 
entire audience remained in front of the sts •'3 and could

of two or more downs made possible continuous action with 
no pauses necessary for changing interior properties. 

It is therefore essential that interior scenes which 
represent different places and which follow each other in 
uninterrupted sequence must have been written for per- 
formance on a private stage. 

An examination of the plays reveals that several 
plays have no interior scenes. Others have an occasional 


interior scene but never two in succession.

scenes to predominate is evident in plays which other

Sixty-four percent of the scenes have outdoor settings

The same is true of the comedies and tragedies

be more external in mood than As Y u ,h-ke It where the 
ratio is 1 & to 3 for outdoor scenes and Julius Caesar

vate theatre . 7 rb; g. r it is ' -ail , however, to examine 

each of the private theatre plays individually and to 
recount in each case the factors which provide evidence 


of the private origin of the plays. 

The Comedy of hrrors was written between the 
years 1539 and 1593 ^n& perhaps even earlier. it is pre¬ 
sumed to have been Shakespeare’s first effort in dramatic, 
composition, and it has abo 

c 

, fe.i. hmewsL . ( ■ 

her.es to the classical tradition of the unities. Beyond 
the classical style and the absence of a balcony" scene, 
there is no mechanical device by which we dan pin this 




























22 


play to the private stage* The only mention that is made 
of its -having "been acted is a reference to a performance 
t Gray’ s Inn in 1594. Frances Yates, who 
L ove ’ f _ h t, 

revels at Gray 1 - Inn in 1594-95* She says, 

"The members of Gray* s Inn included several of 
the most powerful nobles of the land including the 

1 i, bon, - 1 

Hichmond." (l) 

The Gray’s Inn perfor"ance must therefore have been of a. 
-private nature . The classical element of the play and 
the evidence of early composition may suggest that it was 
originally written for a school stage. This conjecture 
may he supported by the fact that Pinch, a schoolmaster, 
is included in' the dramatis ears or . e . There seems no 
logical reason for sc labelling Pinch unless as a good 
natured jibe which would appeal to students. 

In certain respects Love’s Labour* s host is a 
companion .piece to the Comedy o: p .TJrrors . Sir F. K. 

Chambers sets the date of t:'c cor.g osition at :1589 • If 
he is correct, it too may have been composed for a 
stage. Like the Corneas- ^ ". v rr orr , it ii eludes a school¬ 
master in the dr - vr.t is sens on me . The play displays the 
same evidence of immaturity, a love of puns, stichc

and all the other signs of youthful poetic excess. 

Keilson, however, selects l5 l ?4 as a re 

ffinitj > and Julie - 

despite its “artifloivlit ^ and linguistic virtuosity. ' : (1} 

This is interest in;;, for Prances Yates sets the dat 

1595* She suggests that Shakespeare was influenced by 

the evidence of gaiety which he saw at the Grey’s Inn 

Revels in 1594-95 when the Comedy of h'rrors was presented. 

Kells on says in his introduction to the play, 

y he a. d wit ted, however, is that the 
satire and wit flashing through the play are con¬ 
stantly suggestive of more than a. general object 
and may hint at more than meets the eye. ” (2) 

Miss Yates believes that the good-natured satire was 

directed at the aristocratic members of Gray’s Inn and 

that the theme is full of the light-hearted atmosphere 

characteristic of the Gray’s Inn Revels. Further on she 

says, 

f? It was no doubt first performed at a private 
, Earl of Southampton’s before 

an audience largely composed of ladies and gentle¬ 
men who had been present at the revels.” (3) 

Structurally, h 0 ve 1 s habour’s L 0 st is definitely 

a classical type of play. The unity of place is wore

restricted even than in The Comedy, of Errors , for every 
scene is enacted in the same garden. There is no balcony 
needed and no case of entrance lapse. The play is so 
completely a problem of witty dialogue that the out-of- 
doors aspect may be ignored. Actually, there is nothing 
to prevent the play from being enacted on a public stage. 
However, the nature of the dialogue suggests a cultured 
audience and records point only to performances on- 
private stages. In 159& it was presented before G,ueen 
Elizabeth at court, and in l 6 04~5 was presented at the 
court of James. A quarto published in 1631 refers to its 
presentation at Blackfriars. 

There is some justification in the theory that 
All’s hell That Ends hell is the play which Francis Meres 
in his 1598 list of Shakespearian plays refers to as 
Love’s Labour*s Hon . Ho other existing play fits the 
earlier title so well. If the theory is true, the play 
becomes a sequel to Love’s Laboar’s Lost and may have been 
presented to an audience similar to that at Gray’s Inn in 
159 4-5« The technique of the dramatist is typical of that 
employed in.private theatre plays though the evidence is 
not as conclusive as it is in the case of some others. 

Ho balcony was required, there are no ”entrance le.pses> ,} 













. 





and indoor scenes predominate. The interest of the play 
lies mainly in the plot and dialogue. The freedom with 
which Shakespeare introduces sexy dialogue may point to 
a private audience, for we find much less of this freedom 
in plays designed for the public theatre. As in hove’s 
hahour’s hos t, there are passages which might have been 
directly aimed at an aristocratic audience, but in this 
play there is less gaiety and more of the didactic tone. 
The King’s speech (II, iii, 124-151) is pie of the 

didactic touch. Then there is the point of the hidden 
eavesdroppers.(IV, i). T amatist seldom hides his 

characters on the public stage, for it was necessary to 
keep the view clear from three directions. 

The only existing Quarto of auch Ado About 
Kothina was printed in l6oo. The title page informs us 
that the play had been, ’’sundry times acted publikely.” 

It is a play which could have been acted on a public stage 
with little difficulty, and it is certainly well suited to 
an afternoon performance. However, I am inclined to in¬ 
clude it among the private plays for various reasons. 

What was said of the technique of Ill’s hell is also true 
for this play. Ho balcony is needed, there are no 
’’entrance lapses,” and the majority of scenes are indoors. 
In this play, too, there is some eavesdropping. 


The 


vn 























2o 


"bower required in III, i, 33 would "best "be served "by the 
projecting type of do inns employed on the private stage. 
While the play is set in Arragon and the characters are 
supposed to he Italians, the setting, the characters 
and the dialogue are essentially English. There is much 
of that play of wit so affected Toy the fashionable young 
men of the day, and therefore it is a form of dialogue 
which would have delighted a fashionable audience. There 
is little of the action and roguery which would appeal 
to the occupants of the pit of a public theatre. Surely, 
had Shakespeare had the ’’groundlings ’ 1 in mind as he 
wrote this play, he would have made more of, the villain 
Don John and of the villainy of Boca chi o (III, iii, 102- 
175) • The fact that the play was presented before the 
court in 1612-13 would suggest that it had won a reputa¬ 
tion among England’s aristocracy. 

A group of five plays which includes Twelfth 
Eight, The Jerry "Eves of rr i;:dnr , T b a vr 0 f r " ure , 
Hamlet end 10. or T--1 ' was beyond any doubt planned 
for the private stage. Besides the fact that they re¬ 
quire no balcony and that they have no ’’entrance lapse,” 
these five plays demand some provision for staging 
interior sequences. Only a stage with two or more domus 
















could be used in that day when custom demanded continuous 
p e rf orxnan ce t hr oug hout ■ the pr e sent at ion of a play, (1) 
Furthermore, records of the period refer only to primate 
performances of these plays. 

The only reference to a performance of Twelfth 
If i/.ht is that of John Manningham in his Diary, dated 
Eeb. 2, 1&01-2. The play was evidently acted at the 
Middle Temple at approximately that date. His descrip¬ 
tion of the play suggests that it was very new. One may 
assume th v 1 1 Twelfth E'iaht had heen written for presenta- 
tion at the celebrations at court on Jan. 6. 

This delightful comedy contains two plots, one of 
love romance and one of sheer comedy, yet both are beaut1 
fully interwoven. The story is set in Illyria, and the 
love theme retains some of the color of its Italian 
setting, but the scenes involving Sir Toby Belch and Sir 
Andrew Aguecheek are as English as roast beef. Malvolio 
in his stiff-backed conceit is typical of the convention¬ 
al English butler. Only an audience familiar with the 
plane of society portrayed in the play could properly 
appreciate and enjoy its humor. 

The finest eavesdropping scene to be found in 


















28 


Shakespeare’s plays occurs in Twelfth Eight , An eaves¬ 
dropping scene must provide for the listeners a suitable 
hiding place where they will be hidden from the persons 
being spied upon and yet, where they will be visible to 
the audience. Such provision is possible when the 
audience is seated in front of the stage, but,would 
hardly be convincing when part of the audience looks on 
from either side. We must remember that any obstruction 
on the apron of the public theatre would interfere with 
the view of some of the most influential members of the 
audience, those who occupied the side galleries. Actual¬ 
ly, the presence of an eavesdropping scene in a play is, 

I believe, a most reliable bit of evidence that the play 
was written specifically for a private stage. In column 
5I E H of the survey chart, 1 have indicated the plays in 
which eavesdropping occurs. 

The herry Wives of Windsor is said to have been 
written at the request of Queen Elizabeth who wished to 
see Sir John Ealstaff in love. What Shakespeare has 
done to Sir John in this play seems to bear out the 
tradition. If the play was so inspired, it must have 
been first presented at Whitehall. Certainly, 
has all the ear-marks of a private piece and the only 
records of its performance•are of performances at court 
in 1602 and in 1604 . 


















29 


In certain respects, T *easure for Measure is a 
companion play to All* s Well . In it, the stratagem of 
All Vs. Well is repeated and the character of Parolles is 
redrawn in the person of Lucio. What I have said for 
All ’ s Well can he said for this play. The plays are 
f ated 1602 and 3.6 03. It is remarkable that the dramatist 
should repeat his theme so soon unless urged to do so by 
the aristocratic audience which f ound All 1 s hell so 
satisfying that it demanded more of the same. Beilson 
in his introduction to the play comments on the perfor¬ 
mance at Court on December 26, 1604, and actually assigns 


comp os' it i on to that y ei 


He goes on to say 


H It was among the first, of Shakespeare f s plays 
t 0 be given for James at Whitehall * • 

company, now the King * s Men; and the lines I, i, 68-73 
and II, iv, 27 - 30 , touching up on the annoyance which 
well-intentioned public throngs may cause their 
rulers, seem e al cu 1 s .t e d to pie a s e Ja me s, wl lose 
aversion to crowds was well Mown. The central 
stratagem in the plot links the play directly with 
Al '. 1 1 g ] sp 1 ei 1 d 1 d passages in III, i, 4-41, 

118-132 and II, iv, 1-7 are unmistakably kin to the 
famous speeches in Hamlet.” (l) 

It seems reasonably certain that the Court performance 

of Measure for Measure on December 26 , 1104, was its 

first presentation. 

The records tell us that Hamlet was presented in 


(l) [ill, . cit ., p. ' 






















30 


London in 1603 and at sea in 1607. The paucity of infor¬ 
mation is remarkable considering the volumes that have 
been written about this play .in more recent.tines. Its 
present popularity is based on its great depth of drama¬ 
tic power and on its disturbing psychological interest. 
The strength of its appeal to the intellect suggests 
that it war written for an intellectual audience. Hamlet 
is believed to have been written in 1 & 02 . Since its 
‘London performance occurred in 1603, L 

theatres-.were all outside Lond n, we v fi- 

a for assuming that it was performed, ai i' 

first performed, at private house. Structurally the 
play is ideally suited for presentation on a private 

, best evidence is to be 

found in a passage in Act III of the play.

cover that a sixteenth century Cockney had as much stiff¬

would be as quick to resent a slight. Shakespeare would

Two somewhat similar plays which I assign to 


private 


stage are R T ah"iv" v a’-^.i "ah' ha'-:/' and The 


Tempest . Both are highly poetic and are almost ,pure 
fantasy. Both would lose much of their Beauty and 
mystery if presented in mid-afternoon in the. hold and 
searching' reality of the sun. They require a night-time 
setting where subdued lighting will add to the enchant¬ 


ment which the dramatist seeks to effect. There is some 
justification for the Belief t: . t .d. Hi dsn a a v.-r-Bight } f

there would be available for these parts the child actors 
then under the sponsorship of the Queen and her Faster of

Eho wn dates tie The Te'nest very closely to the 
private theatre. It was written in loll and was acted 
the same year at Whitehall .end again in 1612. There is

two-storied building. Burbage removed the floor of the 
upper story to give him ample space to erect galleries 
and to heighten and enlarge the stage. ( 2 ) He thus set 
for indoor theatres the pattern which was to last a long

ly Shakespeare meant these three plays to be presented 
in the evening on a stage where the lighting effects 
could be provided which would serve best to support the 
mood of darkness haunting these great tragedies.

AUD WOHK^TSHIP- OF HIS PLAYS 


We are now prepared to discuss the question of the 
differences in quality and wort.'unship which were forced 
upon Shakespeare by the differing audiences. Devotees of 
Shakespeare tell us that part of the perpetual delight 
in hi plays cones from the discoveries 


cr< ... pi] g up 
and dr amt i 
skill which 


in every reading, of new subtleties of poetic 
c excellenceof thought, 
had before escaped their notice. There will 


be, doubtless, much that has es 

ly clearly. 

I t ■ fi■ , ' 

tori cal Plays were written for the public theatres. 
Shakespeare had available the balcony and the large stage 
wh ig f ibile theatres. Thus, we find that 

balcony scenes and ff entrance lapses 1 ’ frequently occur in 


this group of plays. Sixty-two percent of the scenes re-

run to a pattern wherein the pageantry of king and court,

again. To suit the taste of the uncultured groundling a 
play must be lively. There must be abundant action end

some great dramatic moments, and a certain ageless 
quality which has made these plays universally popular 
in every generation. That excellence may be due in part 
to the fact that the plays had to meet the approval of a 
most diversified audience in the public theatres of that 
day, 

An interesting fact relating to the proposed dates 
of the plays may be here noted. Seventy percent of the 
public plays were written before 1^00 while sixty-nine 
percent of the private plays were written after l60Q. 

This may mean little or much. It is' possible that the 
Lord Chamberlain was first attracted to Shakespeare’s 
company by the skill of the actors and by the fine plays

more on his company for performances and upon Slia3.ceBper.-re 
to provide suitable plays. It was the training which 
Shakespeare got when writing for the public theatre with 
its peculiar problems of stage and audience which made 
It possible for him to produce the superb plays of the 
later period.

Pornographic literature has had its ups and downs 
throughout the centuries. In the Elizabethan age as in 
our own, immoral literature had its devotees and its 
bitte: rudis! , we may be sure, was not a 

trait of the people who frequented the public and private 
theatres, hut it was a trait of the powerful iddl 
people who frowned upon the theatre because they consid¬ 
ered it a den of iniquity. The fine moral precepts which

product of his age and environment to he a prude. He did 
not hesitate to introduce filthy characters, foul remarks 
and sexy situations if he felt that it would enhance the 
dramatic effect which he sought. While he did not write 
pornographically, certain of his scenes would he as ' - 

lightful to the lewd minded element in his audience on if 
he had written for the sake of filth, and at the 
time the scene could he misinterpreted by those who 
looked upon the theatre with distatte. TV point is that 
in the private ploys there is relatively more of this 
type of dialogue than in the. public plays. The -welfare 
of the public theatre was near to Shakespeare’s heart

and purse. 1 suggest that he was restrained from the use 
of filthy and suggestive dialogue hy a sincere desire to 
improve the reputation of the public theatre. He was not 
under the same restraint when writing for the private, 
audience. 


Another manner in which Shakespeare approaches 
his private audience is revealed in the tragi-comedies. 

' i re, ' ' 

ligence and understanding of the people who attended the 
private performances. The plays stand out in marked con- 
trast to the public plays. Whereas the public plays are 
clear, direct and plausible, t tr ;i- are in¬ 

clined to be abstruse and at times verging on the absurd. 
Ueilson says,

typical the widest gamut fcion,

Hr.' Broadus has stated, 

"Elizabethan fiction falls roughly into two classes, 
tales of the unvarnished realities of life, and 
romances of love-making and adventure in an idealised 
wor1d ofthe imagination.” (1) 

Only an audience familiar with the literary trends of that 

day could properly appreciate the remarkable interplay of

The private theatre offered him certain oppor-

of adapting his. plays to two theatres quite distinct in

and their stages. We have noted that each offered'-cer¬
