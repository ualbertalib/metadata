CHAPTER I 


DEMONSTRATIVE GEOMETRY AND THE CURRICULUM 

Geometry on the defence. 

The right of demonstrative geometry to a place on the 
school curriculum has been strongly questioned many times 
during recent years* In the past it was claimed that a 
course in geometry not only developed a reasoning ability 
but had, as well, certain disciplinary values which could 
ill afford to be missed in any educational program. With 
educationists in doubt concerning the disciplinarian values 
of learning, and with the school population changing so 
that a very small percentage of students continue their 
studies to the point where geometry is applied, the support¬ 
ers of geometry have been forced to re-examine their position. 

The geometry of Euclid as taught to the parents of 
our students, with its emphasis on formal proofs, constructions, 
theorems and rote learning, finds few proponents today. 

Since then school geometry appears to have branched in at 
least two directions. The first influenced by the progressive 
education philosophy emphasizes activity and utility. To 
have the students meet and find in the problems they face, 
situations which call for geometric knowledge and invest¬ 
igation is its aim. The problems may arise on the farm, at 
the carpenter f s bench, in the shop of the mechanic or around 
the home. Utility, not logic, is the principle used to

determine the choice of material. The value of the geometry 
does not depend on the flimsy hope of transfer, it advocates 
claim; here the knowledge is directly applicable.. Added to 
this advantage of immediate utility, is the claim that students 
interest becomes immediately aroused by material that has mean¬ 
ing to his daily living. With this enlivened interest the 
student may also learn the theoretical implications and gen¬ 
eralizations without the feeling that he is being forced to 
learn something abstract and artificial. 

A second plan in geometry teaching seeks to use geometry 
as subject matter by means of which to develop, on the part of 
the student, an ability to reason logically. There is no 
doubt that geometry exhibits a logical structure. Indeed 
Euclid’s "Elements of Geometry” was man’s first great epic 
of reasoning, the earliest work in which mathematical ideas 
were exhibited as a logically arranged sequence of propositions. 
However, Euclid’s Elements were written for men, not for boys 
and girls; and text writing is still under the sway of Euclid’s 
style. This formal logical emphasis may hinder the pupil*s 
understanding of logical principles. Can geometry be taught 
in such a manner as to develop in the student a working 
knowledge of the laws of elementary logic? Can he be made 
more alert to the fallacious forms argument can take? If the 
student can be taught to be logical in the field of geometry, 
and if this teaching will carry over into other fields, then 
geometry teaching need offer no excuses. Through it, the 
student has gained the ability to reason, an ability justifying

strenuous effort. Recent results indicate that the ’’errors 

due to not understanding the meaning of proof, persist and 

1 

account for the largest number of errors committed,” and 
should warn us against assuming that a study of geometry 
means a mastery of logic. Consequently the hope that geometry 
taught with the ability to reason logically as an objective, 
can achieve the desired results must be justified. 

In Alberta, the introduction of a new text in September 

2 

1940, focused attention on these considerations concerning 
the teaching of geometry. While throughout the body of the 
text continual reference is made to, and use is made of every¬ 
day occurences of geometric problems, still the text is def¬ 
initely prepared so as to develop an insight into the nature 
of logical reasoning. The author states in the preface, 

”as the student begins to gain some appreciation of how his 
proofs rest fundamentally on the use of undefined words and 
unproved propositions, his earlier confidence may be somewhat 
shaken. But probfs do make the propositions hang together; 
there is a system and order, even if the system is not rigid 
and the order is not irrevocable. Indeed the student should 
begin to understand that theories and systems are not certain¬ 
ties or absolutes, but tools in human hands which may be used 
for the furtherance or hindrance of human welfare,” 

In short, then the text on which the Alberta curriculum 
is based aims to use the everyday situation approach with its 
advantage of utility and at the same time develop an ability 
to reason logically, an ability pre-requisite to the contin¬ 
uance of our democratic form of life. This approach is

directly in line with the aim suggested in the 13th yearbook 

of the N.C.T.M.: "Geometry achieves its highest possibilities 
if, in addition to its direct and practical usefulness, it can 
establish a pattern of reasoning; if it can develop the power 
to think clearly in non-geometric situations; if it can 
develoo the power to generalize with caution from specific 
cases and to realize the force and all inclusiveness of 
deductive statements; if it can develop an appreciation of the 
place and function of definitions and postulates in the proof 
of any conclusion, geometric or non-geometric; if it can 
develop an attitude of mind which tends always to analyze 
situations, to understand their inter-relationships, to 
question hasty conclusions, to express clearly, precisely and 
accurately non-geometric as well as geometric ideas."1 

In developing the power to think clearly the author of 
our present text is alert to use the fact that the pupil has 
already reasoned accurately on a variety of subjects. Basing 
his development on this already existing ability, the author 
attempts to mould the student’s reasoning into more formal 
style. Nor are the exercises in reasoning confined to geometric 
situations. The student is encouraged to apply the same anal¬ 
ytical and critical methods to non-geometric situations. 


Purpose of Investigation. 

This study is an attempt to determine if any relation 

exists between a student’s ability in geometry and his mastery 

of logic. When reference is made to a student’s ability in 

geometry it will be his ability to solve actual specific 

problems that will be meant. Is this ability in any way 

related to his grasp of that "certain form of reasoning, a 

2 

method of attack that can be used on most problems."

While the above query was the primary concern of this 
study, it was hoped that many interesting points would be 
revealed regarding the new Alberta curriculum. How does the 
present Alberta curriculum compare with the traditional curr¬ 
iculum? With the curriculum of other provinces? Will certain 
schools consistently do work above the average? Or if a school 
stresses logic will it do poorly on the more specifically 
geometric problems, especially those requiring skill in original 
geometric manipulation? This last question is practically 
the same question' raised in the N.C.T.M. 13th year book. Using 
the terminology of this source the questions would read:- Can 
geometry achieve "direct and practical usefulness” and at the 

same time give the pupil "certain ideas about the nature of 

1 

proof?" 

Specific information might also be found concerning the 
types of problems offering greatest difficulty, along with the 
reason for these difficulties, thus making the test act in a 
diagnostic capacity. Added to this is the possibility that an 
analysis of the results of schools in conjunction with the 
teacher questionaire, might throw light on teacher methods 
giving best results. In studying teacher methods, caution 
must be exercised not only because of the impossibility of 
measuring or controlling human qualities involved but also 
because of the countless other factors that might affect a 
school f s attainment on the particular tests used.

CHAPTER II 


THE TEST BATTERY 
Description of the Test Battery. 

The test battery consists of five tests on 
geometry and reasoning, accompanied by the Otis 
B Higher Examination of Mental Ability. Since 
the purpose of the study is to examine the 
relation between the student f s ability to solve 
geometric problems, and the student T s ability 
to reason logically whether formally or inform¬ 
ally, the tests range by degrees from the type 
where the correct answer only is of importance, 
to the type where emphasis is placed almost 
exclusively on the form of reasoning. Each 
test is designed with a specific aim in view, 
an aim which to a large extent dictated the 
type of questions making up the test. A question- 
aire was completed by each participating 
teacher. This served to indicate the aims and 
emphasis of instruction. A Record Sheet, a 
copy of which follows, was also obtained from 
each pupil. A description of each test follows.

GENERAL INFORMATION AND INSTRUCTIONS EOR ADMINISTERING TESTS 


meral Statement 


The study in which you are cooperating is designed to determine to 
lat extent our present courses in Demonstrative Geometry, as taught, 
jvelop the student T s ability to reason. A number of allied questions 
111 also be investigated at the same time. The research is sponsored 
t the Canadian Council for Educational Research and is being conducted 
t a committee consisting of Dr. A. J. Cook, Mr. Stanley Clarke, M.A., 
id Mr. Leonard Pallesen, B.Sc. The scope of the study includes six 
?ovinces: Nova Scotia, Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba, Alberta and British 

)lumbia. 

At the present time such a study is of considerable importance, 
le results are not intended to answer any academic question about 
?ansfer of training in general, but rather to throw some light on 
itual results being achieved at the moment. There is no intention of 
’awing invidious comparisons between results from various provinces. 

It was considered necessary to obtain some information from each 
irticipating teacher. For this purpose you will find a questionnaire 
iich you are requested to fill in immediately. Any additional comments 
)u wish to make will be welcomed. They can be attached to the 
lestionnaire. 

jsts 

A test battery consisting of five tests on geometry and reasoning, 
id an Otis B. Higher Examination of Mental Ability, will be provided. 

Lis requires a total of approximately five hours of pupil time for 
•mpletion. Throe tests require about one hour each (two class periods) 
file the other three can be conveniently finished in one class period. 

The tests must be given in the right order—number one first, 
imber two next,and so on. Also, since each test is related to the 
■evious one, absolutely no class discussion of any test or test item 
.ould take place until after the last test has been given. Here is 
je order and time: 

Test I — about 20 minutes 
Test II -- about 60 n 

Test HI -- about 60 " 

Test IV — In two parts, each about 20 minutes 
Test V -- about 6 0 minutes 

time limit is not necessary for any of the above tests. If possible, 
low sufficient time for each pupil to finish each test. The Otis B. 
telligence must also be given, even though you already have the 1.^. 

each pupil concerned, because (l) We want to use mental age, not I.Q,., 
d (2) For comparable results on a large group the same test results 
st be used. You will be provided with an answer key so that you may 
cure the I.Q,. scores if you wish. 














•T-.' 

















. ministering the Tests 

General -- You are requested to emphasize to the students not to mark 

I the test “booklets where so instructed. 

If possible, do not hurry students for any test of I-V, if sufficient 
me can be allowed for completion by each student of each test. 

Foolscap or scribbling paper may be used by the student for every 
ist exco-pt number three and the Otis B c 

Test I — Distribute the answer sheets first and have the students 

II out the information asked for at the top of the sheet. You will have 
i help them fill in their standing in class. 

Then distribute the test. Go over the sample problem with the students 
id make sure that students are recording their answers on the answer-sheet 
rrectly. Avoid answering questions. If the student understands the 
rections, let him go ahead. 

Test II -- Distribute the answer sheets and have the student fill out 
Le information asked for. Distribute the sheet of reasons (8§ X 14 sheet). 
,en distribute the test. Go over the directions and the sample problem 
th the students. Make sure they are recording their answers correctly on 
.e answer sheet. 

Test III — Distribute the same sheet of reasons used for Test II. 
i answer sheet is provided here. The answers are to be placed on the test 
ieets in the spaces provided. The student is to follow the general 
rections for each problem. See that reasons are recorded in steps in 
ie blocked spaces provided. 

Test IV -- The first part (the sheet of statements to bc marked T or 
must be given first and the sheets collected before the second part is 
arted. After giving part one, if there is sufficient time to do part two 
the same class period, distribute the answer sheet first, then the test, 

1 before. Have the student note that some blanks require a word or phrase, 
me a number or numbers, according to the sense of the question. See that 
;ey are being recorded correctly on the answer sheet. 

Test V -- Follow the same procedure about distributing the answer 
eets, then the test booklet. Read aloud the directions and sample prob- 
im and definitions, with the pupils following you in their booklets. It 
i essential that this procedure be followed, since this is a new type of 
1st in the battery, and the student must understand how it is done before 
| tries to proceed. Tell the students to consider each problem carefully 
Id not to hurry too fast 0 

Otis B. Test -- Follow the instructions given in the manual. It 
i self administering. 

iff to Return the Tests 


If you receive more copies than you require, please return those not 
paired immediately. For the rest, wait until all the tests are completed 
lich will require about two weeks), then return all the test booklets, 

3 answer sheets, Otis B. tests and questionnaire (everything except your 
nplimentary copies), express collect to: 

Dr. M. E. LaZerte, 

Principal, College of Education, University of Alberta, 

Edmonton, Alberta. 

You will probably find the tests interesting and valuable. For 
irly all the tests (all except number III and the first part of number 
1 , you can redistribute the question booklets after all the tests have 
m completed, and discuss the test items. In addition,you may keep a 
iplimentary copy of each test (except the Otis B.)

Test I, - The questions in Test I call for only 
answers. The material is elementary, consisting 
of simple exercises in similarity, congruence, 
parallelism, and the basic properties of triangles 
and parallelograms, it was expected that the 
material of the test would be familiar to all 
candidates who had studied geometry. Hence if an exercise 
was missed, the omission would likely be due 
to lack of ability to apply this knowledge. Nat¬ 
urally then it was expected that the scores be high. 

Since no attempt was made to record the method 
of problem attack used by the pupil, the pupil*s 
score on the sixteen problems of the test may 
thus be considered only in the nature of an index 
of his ability to "get answers" irrespective of 
the rationality of the method used. 

To facilitate marking and to make possible 
the future use of the test itself an "Answer 
Sheet" was provided of which the pupil was re¬ 
quested to place his answers in the indicated 


blanks

Test II .- In Test II an attempt was made to determine the 

student f s ability to follow and to supply steps In a logically 

developed solution. As in Test I, the basic geometric knowledge 

required for the handling of the problems is kept at a minimum. 

in fact, the exercises of Test II can almost completely be 

paired with exercises of Test I requiring the same geometric 
1 

concept. It was thought that this might prove useful in 
diagnostic investigations. In all. Test II had seventy-nine 
blanks for completion, the answers being made on an Answer 
Sheet. 

The general outline of a solution to each problem was 
given in two columns headed Statements and Reasons. The 
responses sought can be classified as follows: 

(a) In some cases the student was required to select 
from a given list of reasons the supporting reason for a 
statement made. 

(b) The application of theorems to specific problems 
was checked by requiring the student to show the implication 
in the problem of a particular theorem whose number was in¬ 
serted in the Reasons Column. 

(c) The more difficult task of giving both the statement 
needed in the proof and the supporting reason was required 

in some of the questions of the test.

Before any conclusions are drawn from this test, it 
must be pointed out that those conclusions will be based 
on the following assumptions: 

(a) If the student can select from a list of 27 
theorems the one supporting or justifying a given state¬ 
ment, then he must comprehend in this problem both the 
theorem and statement. He has then apparently begun to 
learn the technique of going from the particular to the 
general, i.e, he has learned to generalize. 

(b) If a student can insert the reasoning step which 
the acceptance of a theorem makes necessary then too he 
understands, in this problem, the reverse of the above 
process, i.e. the argument from the general to particular. 

(c) When he supplies both statement and reason he reveals 
that he is beginning to apply the technique if logical 
thinking in the solution of specific problems confronting 


him

REASONS TO BE USED IN TESTS II & III. 


(The reasons have been roughly grouped, for convenience.) 

I. Things equal to the same thing are equal to each other. 

II. Equals added to equals give equals. 

Two Straight Lines. 

Ill* If two straight lines intersect, the vertically opposite 
angles are equal. 

IV. If two straight lines intersect, the sum of any two 
adjacent angles is 180 degrees. 

V. If one line is perpendicular to another then the angles 
formed are each equal to 90 degrees. 

VI. When two parallel straight lines are cut by a transversal, 
then the sum of any two interior angles on the same side 
of the transversal is 180 degrees. 

VII* When two parallel straight lines are cut by a transversal, 
the corresponding angles are equal. 

VIII. When two parallel straight lines are cut by a transversal, 
the alternate angles are equal. 

Th p Triangle . 

IX. The sum of the angles of a triangle is equal to 180 degrees* 

X. If one angle of a triangle is 90 degrees then the other 
two angles are complementary. 

XI. Any exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of 
the two interior and opposite angles. 

XII. Definition: A triangle which has two equal sides is 
isosceles. 

XIII. If two sides of a triangle are equal, then the angles 
opposite the equal sides are equal. 

XIV. If two angles of a triangle are equal, then the sides 
opposite the equal angles are equal. 

XV. Definition: A triangle which has three sides equal is 
an equilateral triangle.

If two sides and the included angle of one triangle are 
equal to two sides and the included angle of another 
triangle, then the two triangles are congruent. 

XX. 

If three sides of one triangle are equal to three sides 
of another triangle, then the triangles are congruent. 

XXI. 

If two angles and a side of one triangle are equal to 
two angles and a side of another triangle, then the two 
triangles are congruent. 

XXII. 

If two triangles are congruent, then the corresponding 
sides and angles are equal. 

XXIII. 

If two angles of one triangle are equal to two angles of 
another triangle, then the two triangles are similar. 

XXIV.

TEST II 


sctions : In the following exercises an outline is given of the steps 
sssary to obtain the solution, but there are blanks left throughout 
you to fill. 

The first column gives the steps necessary in the argument. The 
Der of the reason for each step (obtained from the list of reasons 
) XXVII) is given in the second column. 

If there is a blank in the second column, you must find in your 
; of reasons, the reason justifying the corresponding statement in 
first column. The number of this reason is to be recorded on the 
/er sheet. Should the statement be a statement of what is given, 

;e the letter "g" in the numbered space on the answer sheet. If 
'e is a blank in the first column, fill in on the answer sheet the 
lit that is obtained with the use of the reason whose number is shown 
;he second column. 

As indicated above, all answers ih test II are to be recorded on 
"answer sheet. Do not put any marks on the test sheets. 


Sample Problem

L The angle CDF. 

Statements 

B C --- 

(a) <lEAB = 55° 

(To) <lCDA = ( g) 0 

(c) Z.CDF = (3)° 

Comments 

(a) Since statement (a) is part of the given data, the 
letter (g) has been inserted in space (l) of the 
answer sheet. 

(b) Reason VII applied to this figure would give 
z.CDA = *-EAB = 55° • Hence 55 is shown in space (2) 
on the answer sheet. 

(c) Reason IV applied here shows that 
4 ADC + z_CDF = 180° 

But 4ADC = 35° 

Hence Z.CDF = 125°, and 125 is shown 
in space (5) of the answer sheet.

Test III, - In Test II where the pupil was required to 
give both his statement and the supporting reason, he 
was in reality supplying his own solution. Still, the 
general outline provided, gave incentive and help in the 
development of a formal solution. Test III requires the 
student to develop the entire proof or solution of the 
problem; both the steps in the argument and the reasons 
for each step were required. An attempt was made to base 
the problems on meaningful everyday situations yet involve 
only the geometric principles and theorems already used 
in Tests I and II. In fact, the same list of theorems 
supplied for Test II was used in Test III. Thus from 
the geometric point of view, Test III was no more difficult 
than the preceeding tests, but the students must have 
matured in thought to successfully attack it. Not only 
must he detect the basic geometric nature of an everyday 
problem, but also he must pick out the essential elements, 
what is given, what he is to find, and apply his knowledge 
of geometric facts to the development of a solution. 

With a view to facilitating marking, a framework 
was supplied within which the student was required to 
place his solution. The test consists of five exercises.

Test IV, Part I. - This test gives thirty-four statements 
of the principles of logic and of the fallacies that 
might arise in reasoning. These statements are arranged 
in pairs so that one member of each pair is true while 
the other is false. The statements are not made in 
geometric terminology but as examples of principles of 
logic that might be mastered in a course in geometry. 

The principles in each pair are arranged with slightly 
different wording. In this way, the recognition by the 
student of principles learned by rote, but otherwise 
meaningless, is discouraged. Almost certainly this 
ensures that a correct response indicates grasp of the 
full meaning of the principle. Student success on this 
test will serve as an index of his knowledge of certain 
general principles fundamental to logical reasoning 
such as the use of undefined words and unproved propos¬ 
itions. Unfortunately the results will throw no light 
on the question as to whether his knowledge has been 
gained from the study of geometry, from the study of 
some other subject, or merely incidentally. The follow¬ 
ing are the pairs of True-False statements:- 1 and 21, 

5 and 33, 8 and 16, 2 and 24, 9 and 23, 3 and 32, 18 and 
30, 14 and 26, 15 and 27, 4 and 13, 11 and 22, 6 and 17, 

7 and 29, 10 and 31, 12 and 19, and 25 and 34.

Test IV, Part II. - This test consists of nine geom¬ 
etrical situations. The exercises were chosen well 
within the experience of the student in an effort 
to determine to what extent the principles of Part I 
could he applied to geometrical situations. The 
situation is usually a discussion or disagreement 
concerning the correctness of a proof. After a brief 
description of the circumstances and an exposition 
of the argument, the student is required to decide 
whether the argument is logically sound or not, just¬ 
ifying his decision by reference to the pertinent 
principle or principles of reasoning chosen from a 
list supplied. This list includes most of the true 
statements of Part I. A correct choice of supporting 
principles certainly means, on the part of the student, 
both comprehension of the principle and also a real¬ 
ization of its application to specific situations. 

An "Answer Sheet" is supplied on which the 
student is to record his decision concerning the 
situation and his choice of supporting principles.

STATEMENTS FOR USE IN TEST IV, Part II 


The following statements are principles of logical reasoning. 
You are to use them in support of your decisions in a group of 
situations to follow. 


I. 

In an argument all the important words should be carefully 
defined. 

"■ II. 

A definition is of no use unless the people concerned are in 
agreement about every word used in the definition statement. 

III. 

When the people concerned are agreed about the meaning of a 
word, a correct conclusion can be reached without a formal 
definition of the word. 

IV. 

Changing the meaning of one of the words in the statement of 
a definition has the effect of changing the definition. 

V. 

Different conclusions can be logically arrived at using the 
same definition if one of the words used In the definition 
statement is not given the same meaning by all the people 
concerned. 

VI. 

A word may be correctly defined in several ways. 

VII. 

If one changes a definition the conclusion which follows may 
also be changed even though the argument is logical. 

VIII. 

The converse of a true theorem is not always true. 

IX. 

In an argument, what is to be proved should not, either 
directly or indirectly, be used as a reason in the argument. 

X. 

In the proof of a problem no construction should be made 
which implies or rests upon the statement to be proven. 

XI. 

A conclusion can not be drawn without somewhere in the 
reasoning accepting one or more assumptions. 

XII. 

In an indirect argument all the possibilities must be considered 
and all but one must be eliminated. 

XIII. 

To apply a given theorem to a special case, the special case 
must be shown to satisfy the conditions of the theorem.

TEST IV 


Part II 


actions : You are given an answer sheet and a statement sheet to go 

i this test. In the blanks on the answer sheet you are to answer the 
stions asked with regard to the following situations. 

Situation I 


following are three definitions of ANGLE:- 

i/hen two straight lines meet, an angle measured in degrees is formed. 
In angle, in degrees, measures the change in direction from one straight 
Line to another. 

Vn angle, in degrees, measures the amount of rotation of a line about 
a point. 


1 said :- At quarter after twelve the angle between the hands of a clock 
is about 90 degrees. 

L said : - You mean that in the fifteen minutes after twelve o*clock the 
minute hand of the clock sweeps through an angle of about 
90 degrees? 

_ Which boy is right? (a) Bill but not Jo$m; (b) neither; 

(c) John but not Bill; (d) both? 

__ Which definition, A, B or C, is John using? 

_ Which definition is Bill using? 

Which of the general statements on your statement sheet apply to 
this situation? Insert the number of each in blank (4) on your 
, answer sheet. 


Situation II 

following definitions of TANGENT to a curve were under consideration 
i reference to the figure given below. 

It is a straight line which touches a curve at a point. 

't is a straight line which however far it is produced has one and only 
me point in common with the curve. 

'.t is the limiting position of the secant as the two points in which 

the secant meets the curve move closer 
together. 

Eunice said :- Definition B. does not apply 
to this figure since tangent TPT ? meets the 
curve in one point beside the point P, 

Nancy replied :- Tangent TPT f meets the 
curve CD only in one point, hence defin¬ 
ition B. applies to the curve CD, DE is 
another curve. 

Eunice but not Nancy; (b) Nancy but not 
ice; (c) neither; (d) both? 

Over the meaning of what word are the girls in disagreement? 

Which of the general statements apply to this situation? 

Insert their numbers in the blank on the answer sheet. 


























' 


















Situation III 


3 class was discussing the definition of SIMILAR FIGURES as follows:- 

LI suggested :- Let us say that two figures are similar when they have 
the same shape. 

m replied :-- That definition would hardly be satisfact©ry for the 
word 7 shape 7 is too vague. 

n then offered a definition:- Two figures are similar if their sides 

are proportional. 

il objected: - The words 7 their sides 7 limit the use of the definition 
to figures bounded by straight lines. Why not say 
’’Two figures are similar if corresponding lengths are 
proportional throughout the figures.” 

m criticized again:- But have we definition^ of 7 corresponding lengths 7 
and proportional 7 ? 

LI defended himself:- We have not formal definitions but from our past 
work we are able to agree about their meaning, so my 
definition is workable. 

1 further discussion showed that there was agreement on the meaning of 

3 words in question, would formal definitions of these words be 

jessary? 

3) (a) Yes (b) No 

l) Which of the general statements apply to this situation? 

Insert their numbers in blank (9) on your answer sheet. 


Situation IV 



X and Y are the centres of two circles. 
The circles intersect at A and B. 

XS = SY 

SA is tangent to the circle BAQ,. 

P : 4 is perpendicular to SA. 


W-ith these data Dick proceeded with 
the following argument 

By one of our theorems we know 
that the perpendicular from the centre 
of a circle to a chord bisects the 
chord. Take S as'the centre of a 
circle, with PQ, as a chord. 

Then AP = AQ. 

class found that the theorem referred to had been correctly stated. 

Oj_ Would you accept the above proof as satisfactory? (a) Yes (b) No. 

1) List on your answer sheet the number of each general statement 


you would use to support your conclusion 


















C 











Situation V 


lass was trying to prove that the line joining the midpoint of a 
>rd RS to the centre 0 of a circle is perpendicular to the chord, 

John offered the following proof 

OR and OS are radii of the circle. 

Hence 0R=0S. . Therefore triangle ORS 
is isosceles. There is a theorem 
which states that the perpendicular 
bisector of the base of an isosceles 
triangle passes through the vertex. 
Therefore MO is perpendicular to RS. 

. The class agreed that John had correctly 
stated the theorem in question, but some 
members of the class thought that his proof 
was not logical. 

12) Do you think that John ? s proof is logical? (a) Yes (b) No. 

13 ) Which of the general statements explain your decision. 

Insert their numbers in the blank on the answer sheet. 

Situ ati on VI 

tuation V was still under consideration. Mary claimed that John ? s 
oof was not satisfactory, but that she had one which was logical, 
e stated it as follows:- 

We know that the perpendic ular from the centre of a circle to a 
ord bisects the chord . ’ But M‘ is' the midpoint of the chord RS, there- 
re MO must be perpendicular to RS. 

e class agreed that the underlined statement was correct. 

14) Accept their verdict. Do you agree that Mary has proved that 
the line joining the midpoint of a chord to the centre of a 
circle is perpendicular to the chord? (a) Yes (b) No. 

Il5)_Which of the general statements would you use to support your 

decision? Insert the number of each in the blank (13) on the 
answer sheet. 

• 

Situatio n VII 

1 a class discussion of the parallelogram a model made from laths, 

Itcd together at the ends, was used. Various properties of the model 
re noted and it was finally decided to define the parallelogram as a 
ur-sided figure w^hose opposite sides are parallel. On watching the 
agonals of the model for various positions Bill remarked that in any 
rallelogram the diagonals bisect each other. The class was able to 
ove that Bill ? s statement was correct. Jack then said M I ? ve been 
btching quadrilaterals on paper and it is quite clear to me that we 
ve proved that if the diagona ls of a four-sided figure bisect each 
her, then the figure is a paral lelogram.' 

i6) Do you believe that the class had proved the underlined statement? 

(a) Yes tb) No. 

L7) Insert the number of each reason you feel supports your conclusion.

z. PMA ~ / v^MA. 


Betty argued as follows to prove that 
PM = QM:~ 

Construct PC and QC perpendicular to AB. 
On comparing triangles CMP and CMQ, 

CM is common, *.CMP = 4 .CMQ, etc. 


Betty ? s argument is already in error. 

18 ) Insert on the answer sheet the number of each of the general 
statements which tells why the above is in error. 


C 



Situation IX 


A group of students were to prove that 
"If in the triangle ABC angle B is greater 
than angle A, then the sides BC and AC 
are unequal and AC is greater than BC." 

Ralph offered the following proof. 

If AC = BC 
then ^ A = ^ B 

but we are told that cA is not equal to^B. 
Therefore AC and BC can not possibly be 
equal and must be unequal. 

Hence AC is greater than BC, since it is 
not equal to BC. 


19) Rid Ralph prove that AC and BC are unequal? 

. (a) Yes. (b) No. 

£0) Did he prove that AC is greater than BC? 

(a) Yes. (b) No.

is attached to this report for completeness* 

Mr* Clarke has described the test and his findings 
in a separate report. 


The Distribution of the Test Battery. 

The test Battery has been distributed among 
six provinces, Nova Scotia, Quebec, Ontario, Alberta, 
and British Columbia, the greatest number being 
kept in Alberta. The results examined here are 
based on only the Alberta returns.

CHAPTER III 


THE MARKING OF THE TESTS AND THE TABULATING OF RESULTS, 

Original Marking and Recording of Student Answers. 

Tests I, II and Test IV, Parts I and II were 
objective in form and were quite easily marked. The 
results were first tabulated on large sheets with the 
question numbers written across the top and the 
students* names, grouped in schools, down the left 
hand margin. This gave a two way table, such that 
horizontal addition gave for each pupil the number 
right and the number wrong on each individual question. 
Adding these last totals gave the total results on 
each of the questions. The size of these record sheets 
makes their inclusion in this report impossible, 
Nevertheless they were useful in supplying detailed 
information, the obtaining of which would otherwise 
have necessitated the re-examination of the original 
answer papers.

Tabulating the Results of the Individual Tests. 

Test I.- This test has sixteen blanks to be filled 
by the students. On the large record sheets each 
answer was recorded as wrong or correct by an x or 
by a Check mark. The pupils being grouped by schools 
on the record sheet, it was possible to find, totals 
for each school. The total number of correct res¬ 
ponses (sum of check marks) and the total number of 
attempts at a given question (sum of checks and x f s) 
were found. The ratio of these two numbers, in each 
case, was converted to a percentage. These results 
by school and by question are given in Table I. 

For example, 22 pupils in School I tried question I, 
17 got it correct, giving a per cent score of 77. 

The total questions tried for each school, the total 
questions correct for each school and per cent score 
of the school on Test I are given at the bottom of 
Table I. Thus School VIII had a cumulative correct 
score of 492 out of 577 questions tried giving a per 
cent score of 85. This last figure provides a basis 
on which to compare the achievement of the various 
schools for Test I. 

The test Battery was given to eleven schools in 
Alberta where the students were currently studying 
Geometry. Each school is referred to by a number, 
the derivation of which is explained in Chapter IV.

Test II.- Test II has a total of 79 blanks to be 
filled in as responses in the solution of six exer¬ 
cises. The classification of the responses within 
each exercise as "Answers", "Statements" and "Reasons" 

along the line indicated in the description of the 

1 

test in Chapter II, gave a total of fifteen scores 
on Test II. For example, an examination of Exercise I 
shows that blank 6 is an "Answer", blanks 1, 2 and 3 
are "Statements" and blanks 4, 5 and 7 are the "Reasons" 
for these statements. The fifteen groups are indicated 
in the first column of Table II, Page 43. The total 
number of correct responses from a school on each 
of these fifteen groups was converted to a percent of 
the possible number of correct responses. To derive 
a School T s score on the entire test the total number 
of correct answers from the school was converted to 
a per cent of the total number possible. This 
percentage, which is indicated in the bottom row of 
Table II, is comparable for schools, whether they are 
large or small.

Test III,- Test III is not a completion test. The 

intention was to examine the answer papers for only 

certain schools which the other tests indicated to be 

either typical or exceptional. The results from the 

1 

study of Test III are related in a later Chapter. 


Test IV, Part I. - As was indicated in Chapter II, the 
statements which the student was to designate as True 
or False were arranged in pairs, one true, one false, yet 
both based on the same principle. 

Of the seventeen pairs, ten require a comprehension 
of the following ideas: 

(a) the importance of definition, 

(b) the relation between definition and conclusion, 

(c) the relation between assumptions and conclusions, 

(d) the technique of indirect argument. 

The results for these principles are given in Table III. 

The seven remaining pairs, recorded in Table IV, 
are based on the following common fallacies in reasoning: 

(a) personal attack 

(b) assuming a converse 

(c) the use of false authority 

(d) the use of irrelevant statements, and 

(e) arguing in a circle.

A correct response for both members of the 
matched pair of statements was recorded as "Correct” # 

If the statements were shown both true or both false, 
the combined reply was recorded as a "Guess". The 
inconsistency would appear to indicate the student 
did not understand the statements. An incorrect 
response for each statement was recorded as "Wrong". 

In Tables III and IV the total number of pupils in 
each school with the rating "Correct", "Wrong" or 
"Guess", is recorded for each pair of statements. 

To give the school its score the total "Correct" 
was expressed as a per cent of the number that school could 
possibly get correct (the product of the number 
of pupils and the number of pairs).

Test IV, Part II.- In Test IV Part II the student was required 
to select a correct conclusion from a multiple choice arrange¬ 
ment,, Then, from a list of principles of logic provided, the 
student was required to select those principles supporting the 
conclusion chosen. Since selecting a correct conclusion would 
seem to he a different kind of action from spotting supporting 
reasons, the two processes are at first handled separately. 

In the conclusion bracket of Table V is given the number of 
conclusions correct, followed by the possible number (number 
of pupils times the number of conclusions to be chosen in the 
test - 12) and the resultant per cent score. In the next 
section of the table the same procedure is followed with regard 
to correct reasons selected. Handling irrelevant reasons 
necessitated a slightly different procedure. Since the best 
possible that could be expected in this regard would be to 
choose no irrelevant reasons, the number of such reasons 
chosen can not be immediately converted to a per cent score. 
Instead the number of irrelevant reasons was subtracted from, 
the number of correct reasons; the difference was then 
converted to a percentage of the possible number of correct 
reasons (column 2 in reasons bracket) 0 

To get a single score for the entire Part, reasons and 
conclusions were combined. The number of correct conclusions 
was added to the number of correct reasons and from this total 
was subtracted the number of irrelevant reasons the student 

offered to support his conclusions. By stating the result as 

shown 

a per cent of the possible total, the score in the last 
Table & 

column^was secured for each school.

Deriving Basic Table. 

From the proceeding work, for each school there are five 
per cent scores, one on each of the following: Test I, Test II, 
Test IV, Part la and Test IV Part lb and Test IV Part II. 
Although all these scores are per cents, they do not seem 
to offer a satisfactory basis for comparing achievement of the 
respective tests since the ranges of the scores vary widely 
with the test. For example, the per cent scores of Test I 
are high, while those of Test IV Part II are low. To get 
these scores in a form where they are comparable, the results 
of the schools on each test were distributed from 0 to 10; 

0 going to the ^owest score (70$ for Test I) and 10 going to 
the highest score (93$ for Test I). Intermediate scores were 
scaled linearly. Thus a score of 85 is transformed to 


(85 - 70) 

( ~ 93 ~" - 7 Q) x 10 m 6.5 on the new scale. Consequently, with 
each per cent score converted to an "Index” between 0 and 10, 
each school has five "Index” scores to indicate its achieve¬ 
ment relative to other schools. The indices offer, also, a 
means of comparing the attainment of a given school on the 
various tests. In Table VI the per cent scores (taken from 
the table indicated at the head of the column) are recorded 
with the corresponding "Index” scores. Inasmuch as this table 


is the basis on which a comparison of schools is attempted 
it will henceforth be referred to as the "Basic Table”.

CHAPTER IV 


RATING OF THE SCHOOLS AND OF THE TESTS. 

Charts I & II - Graphical Comparison of Schools. 

With the results of the schools on each test 

reduced to an index, an attempt was next made to rate 

the school. Possibly the rating of schools needs a 

certain amount of justification* With over 200 students 

each filling in over 200 blanks, it was impossible to 

give to all schools the detailed examination which, 

in a study of this type, gives the most enlightening 

and useful results. If the schools could be classified, 

then one school from each class might be chosen as 

representative of that group. The conclusions obtained 

from a detailed examination of the one school it was 

hoped would yield results that could be taken as 

representative. The basis of classification or rating 

of schools was not easily selected. Charts I & II 

were obtained by arranging the tests along the vertical 

1 

scale and plotting the results from each school. 


1. The plotting of all eleven schools on one chart as was 
first attempted gave so many lines that the chart was useless 
to determine even trends. Consequently two charts were used 
with the Category A and Category C schools on Chart I and Cat¬ 
egory B and D schools on Chart II. The terms A,B,C and D will 
be explained later.

CHART II 





















56 


Examination of this chart reveals that no schools are uni¬ 
formly above all others or below all others. Indeed it would 
be surprising if such were the case. Instead we find the 
lines intersecting, indicating a school may do well on one 
test, poorly on another. Yet there are certain schools 
which, on the average, lie above the others. For example 
on Chart I it is apparent that School I is superior to the 
remaining schools. School VI seems unusual. On Chart II 
Schools II, III, IV are definitely above Schools X, XI and 
XII, although School X*s score on Test IV Part la seems 
unusual. All this indicates that there is a certain hier¬ 
archy of standing, but these charts are not sufficient to 
determine the relative positions of the schools in this 
hierarchy. 

Table VII - Grouping the Schools in Categories. 

In basic Table VI the index scores are recorded for each 

school. To try another approach the index scores of the 

schools were grouped as follows: 8-10 as A; 5-8 as B; 3-5 
1 

as C; 0-3 as D. The number of times a given school attained 

a given letter rating was counted and the school placed in 

the category in which it occured most frequently. This 

2 

gave a distribution as indicated in Table VII. The fraction 


1. These letter ratings A,B,C,D may be thought of as High, 

Good, Fair and Low, although perhaps these words have undesirable 
connotations. After all "low" only means low in this test, 
and with respect to the other schools. Hereafter the letter 
rating will be used; the reader may if he desires substitute 
the more descriptive word rating. 

2. The numbering that has been used to identify the schools 

up to this point in the study has been the rating given to the 
school in Table VII.

Chart III - A check on the Rating of Schools as given in

Chart III was used to study further the soundness of the 
rating given in Table VII with respect to Basic Table VI, and 
also to determine the relative difficulty of the tests. 

Placing the schools along the horizontal scale in the order 
of their rating and plotting percentage scores, gavec hart III. 
Each broken line represents the results of the various 
schools on each one of the tests. Vertical lines are inserted 
to classify the schools according to the rating given in

If the rating given in Table VII is sound then the 
schools to the left on Chart III should make higher scores 
than those to the right. In other words a negative slope 
would seem to confirm the adequacy of the rating. Let us 
look at each of these broken line graphs. In both Tests 
I and II, while there is no significant difference between 
B and C Schools, still the D group of Schools scored con¬ 
sistently lower than the other groups. C schools are below 
schools rated as A and B in both sections of Test IV Part I, 
although in these tests D Schools are almost equivalent to 
C schools. The broken line for Test IV Part II clearly has 
a downward trend as it progresses to the right. 

In summary it might be said that Chart III indicates the 

rating in Table VII to be fairly reliable. At least Schools 

I-IV are definitely sunerior to Schools IX-XI and Schools 
1 

V-VIII seem to be an intermediate group. However no 
test gives a broken line graph with a negative slope through¬ 
out. Thus no single test would give the same rating as that 
secured by combining the five scores as in Table VII. Still 
the general trend of all the broken lines indicates the rating 
to be sound. 


1. Note that School VI would be in Category B if reasons 
correct score had been used without irrelevant reasons being 
subtracted.

Rating of Tests by Chart III. 

The second use that was to be made of Chart III, was 

to indicate the relative difficulty of the tests* Inasmuch 

as the per cent scores on the test depends so predominantly 

on the method of marking, the degree of difficulty will not 

necessarily be of great significance although it may be quite 

interesting. Lying almost completely above the other tests 

Test I would appear to be easiest of the group. Test II would 

seem to be next in difficulty. To choose between the sections 

of Test IV Part I would be impossible, for one school found 

one part more difficult, another found the other. In 

evidence, notice the number of times the two lines cross. 

The scores on Test IV Part II were the lowest of the group, 

probably because the "Irrelevant Reasons” were subtracted 

from the ”Correct Reasons”. Suspecting that this might be an 

explanation of the low scores, the per cent scores were found 

1 

without subtracting "Irrelevant Reasons”. The broken line 
obtained on Chart III as a result is above the former broken 
line for this test but still below the others. In summary. 

Chart III would indicate that the tests in order of increasing 
difficulty were Test I, Test II, Test IV Part I, Test IV Part II. 
Does this mean that the increased emphasis on the reasoning 
process is the cause of the increasing difficulty?

Chart IV and Table VIII 

A study of Improvement of Schools as Tests Proceeded. 

With the schools rated as to attainment and the tests 
as to difficulty, the next question to ask is, ’’Did 
any schools improve as the tests proceeded?” Now it 
must be noted that improvement is relative, one school to 
another* The index for a school on the second test is 
improved if that school did better on the second test, 
relative to the other schools, than it did on the first 
test. This limitation on the meaning of improvement 
must be kept in mind. If a school improved, that im¬ 
provement is indicated by an increase in the index number 
(Table VI) or by a positive slope of the line segment in 
Charts I and II. These results are indicated in Table 
VIII. Since there are five tests there are four line seg¬ 
ments. Column three of Table VIII indicates the number 
of these which are positive or negative. Column Four 
records the mean slope of these line segments calculated 
by dividing the sum of the slopes by four. Chart IV 
illustrates these results with the schools distributed 
along the horizontal axis and the mean slope along the 


vertical axis

CHART IV 

IMPROVEMENT OF SCHOOLS ON TESTS 



































64 - 


Since Schools in Categories A and B tend to be above the 

horizontal axis on Chart IV it is evident that these schools 

improved as the tests progressed, in the matter of position 

1 

relative to other schools. Thus, for example, while School 

III falls in per cent score from 82 on Test I to 32 on Test 

IV Part II, still it improves relative to other schools, for 
its index increases from 5.2 in Test I to 9.2 in Test IV 
Part II. A negative mean slope for schools of the middle 
group (Category C) implies that they tended to lose place, 
while the schools of Category D changed very little, the mean 
slope being small but positive. 

If we recall that the tests become successively more 
reliant on reasoning, more abstract and theoretical, and less 
the mechanical "get-the-answer" type, then the following 
conclusions become evident: 

(1) The A and B schools, while showing no superiority over 

C schools in the early tests, are noticeably better as the 

2 

problems stress the logic more and more. (Will Test V 
show schools I-IV with still greater superiority, i.e. can 
we teach geometry well and still teach logic?) 


1. School II is the only exception and its negative slope is 
small (0.25) so the words "tend to” do not seem too strong. 

2. The Index scores of Schools I to IV on Test I are 3.9, 7.8, 
5.2 and 7.0 giving a mean of 5.98/ 

The index scores of Schools V to VIII on Test I are 10, 
7.4, 6.5 and 6.5 giving a mean of 7.60. 

On Test II Schools I to IV score 10, 6.5, 3.0 and 1.5 
giving a mean of 5.25. 

On Test II Schools V to VIII score 7, 4.5, 6 and 6 giving 
a mean of 5.88*

(2) Although Schools of Category C were superior to Category 
A and B Schools In the early tests they lost ground In later 
tests. Considering the nature of the tests this would 
apparently indicate that in these schools students have learned 
geometry in the old sense but are not cognizant of the concepts 
of logical thinking that underlie their work. 

(3) The Category D schools are inferior in all tests. Still 

the positive mean slopes on Chart IV would imply that the 

schools improved as the tests proceeded--or in other words the 

1 

inferiority decreases. This makes it dubious whether we can 
conclude that inferiority in "getting answers" is due to lack 
of ability in reasoning techniques. Probably the two def¬ 
iciencies are concomitant consequences of some other factors. 
The fact that the foregoing general statements can be 

made concerning the various categories would indicate the 
oossibility of choosing one school from each category as 
representative of that category. 


1 . 

This at first seems contradictory to the trend of tests 
in Chart III where the general slope seems about the same for 
all tests. By way of explanation it might be pointed out that 
Chart III is in terms of per cent scores, which, as it was 
pointed out earlier, are not comparative. Thus an improvement 
of 10 % on Test I is not of the same significance as an impro¬ 
vement of 10 % on Test IV, yet the graphs of Chart III would 
have the same slopes*

CHAPTER V 


COMPARING TYPICAL SCHOOLS 

Choice of Typical Schools 

As typical of the four categories in which the 
schools were placed, Schools I, IV, VII and X were chosen 
for detailed study. Within each category the school 
with the largest number of pupils was chosen in order 
to have the samples as large as possible. The number of 
geometry pupils for which the records are complete or 
nearly so varied from 15 to 21 in the schools chosen. 

At this point it might be well to recall the purpose 
of the detailed and comparative study of the individual 
schools. We already know with regard to our typical 
schools that, on the whole. School I excelled, while School 
IV performed better than Schools VII and X. An attempt 
is now to be made to determine the cause of the superiority. 
Various factors that might be thought to be responsible 
are now considered. 


Mental Age of the Typical Schools. 

Table IX shows the distribution of mental ages 
for the typical schools.

The schools of Category B, C and D with mean mental ages 
of 16.1, 16.3 and 16.1 are close enough together that for 
practical purposes they might be considered equivalent. 

School A, however, has an average Binet Mental Age 

1 

approximately one year higher than the other three. 

That this higher mental age is the cause of the super¬ 
iority of School A does not necessarily follow. School B 
is superior to Schools C and D even though it has no 
higher mental age. No conclusions concerning the relation 
between mental age and attainment on these tests will be made 
at the present. Instead Schools B and D which have 
identical mean mental ages will be compared to attempt to 
determine the cause of School B*3 superiority. 


1 . 

In the balance of the Chapter, by A B C and D Schools 
will be meant the Schools chosen as typical for each of these 
categories. For example; when the B School is referred to, 
it will be the results of School IV that are used.

Comparison of School B(IV) and School D(X). 

Chart III reminds us that School B is, in general, 
superior to School D. Only in section (a) of Test IV Part I 
is School D superior ; and even in this test, if sections (a) 
and (h) are considered as giving hut one score, then School B 
is superior. What is the reason for this general superiority? 
Already we have seen that these schools are equivalent in 
regard to mental age. The two schools may now be compared in 
regard to certain factors that might explain the superiority 
of School E over School D. 

Sex. - Commonly we hear the claim that boys ’’take to” 
mathematics while girls do not, or, more cautiously, that boys 
are better at mathematics than are girls. An examination shows 
that Category D School has 9 boys and 7 girls while School B 
has 8 boys and 11 girls. School D thus has the higher per¬ 
centage of boys so apparently sex offers no explanation of 
the difference. 

Year in school. - At first the year in high school seemed 
to offer a logical explanation of the superiority especially 
when it was found that 8 of the School B students were in their 
second year of high school while all the School D pupils were 
in their first year of high school. This would mean that 
educational maturity or experience was a contributing factor 
in a pupil*s success with a first course in Geometry. Added 
to the advantage of a year ! s experience in high school these 
eight students had all taken Algebra I in their first year of

high school; none of the School D pupils were taking, or had 
taken. Algebra I. Examination of the course in Algebra I 
would seem to make it clear that it would help in the Geometry 
course. However, further checking on the achievement of the 
eight second year pupils on the individual tests showed their 
work was not above the average of School B so could not 
account for the general superiority of the entire school. 

For example in Test I the average School B score is 13.4 
questions. The eight students in. their second year averaged 
only 12.3. On test II these same eight students averaged 
57.7 to a School average of 60.1 questions. Years in school, 
then, does not explain the superiority of School B. 

Other items on the record sheet.- A further examination 
of pupil record sheets shows the two schools to be practically 
equivalent in several respects which might affect ability in 
Geometry or in logical reasoning in general. In the first 
place, levels of past achievement in school (measured in 
terms of the distribution of A and B ratings on Grade IX 
examinations) are not fundamentally different. The total 
number of science courses, courses supposed to develop 
scientific attitude, which the students have taken, or are 
taking, show little difference in the two schools. Nor is 
there a noticeable difference in the number of students who 
have taken or are taking courses such as English or Social 


Studies

The teacher questionnaire ." It was felt that the point of 
view, the methods and the aims of the teacher might be a 
determining factor in pupil success on these particular tests. 

If the teacher was cognizant of the features of Geometry that 
these tests stress, then his pupils should do better than the 
pupils of the teacher that merely ’’covers the text”. Details 
in the matter of teacher methods, aims, etc, were called for 
in the questionnaire which the teacher was asked to complete, 

A copy of the questionnaire follows. 

An examination o£ the completed questionnaires sent in 
by the teachers of Schools B and D reveals no greater differences 
than did the comparison of the record sheets of the pupils 
of the respective schools. Both teachers have a background of 
University training on which to base their teaching. Both 
teachers believe, firstly that Geometry instruction is useful 
if it develops a pattern of thinking that will apply in other 
subject-matter fields, and secondly that one on the means of 
attaining this wider usefulness is to tackle new problems which 
the pupils raise, Neither teacher considers the study of 
Geometry to constitute a memorization of formal proofs and 
constructions. There is no method available to compare the 
actual classroom procedures and techniques of these two 
teachers but as far as their answers to the questionnaire 
reveal their training, attitude and methods, no difference is 
apparent that might explain the superiority of School B 0

The study in geometry in which you are participating aims to discover, 
elected provinces, what geometric concepts have been mastered by 
upils, and how well the pupils can reason in geometric and non- 
trie material. To throw light on these questions it is necessary 
ow what references teachers are using, the methods teachers use 
esenting geometry in the classroom, and the like. With this in 
you are requested to fill in the following questionnaire. 

'oes each student have a copy of a text? _, 

Name of text student uses. Author. 


'oes the student have access to any reference books in geometry? 

f. so, do students use such references: _ frequently;

our opinion in this way. A space is provided below for any comments 
bout your own aims you may wish to make. 

A, "Geometry achieves its highest possibilities if it can 
establish a pattern of reasoning; if it can develop the 
power to think clearly in non-geometric situations; if it 
can develop an appreciation of the place and function of 
definitions and assumptions in the proof and conclusion. 

Such are the aims of geometry teaching today." 

B. "In human life today, as in the past, geometry has 
played a great part. The history of this contribution to 
civilization has itself great cultural value, but coupled 
with the mastery of useful geometric concepts so necessary 
for advanced work in any of the sciences, it provides the 
complete justification for the teaching of geometry in the 
schools."

C. "The chief value of geometry lies in its power to train 

the mind. The rigid kind of teaching involved in proving 
propositions in geometry trains the mind to be critical and 
rigorous in thinking. It is the development of this habit 
of logical thinking that is the chief aim in the modern 
teaching of geometry."

iportant place a 1, opposite the outcome or outcomes next most impor- 
int a 2 and so on. If you consider some of these outcomes not worth- 
lile leave the space blank. 

i) The student will be able to prove a certain number of propositions. 

>) He will recognize the significance of defined and undefined terms 
for any argument. 

;) He will be able to solve geometric problems (deductions). 

t ) He will be able to solve more or less original geometric problems 
(i.e. where the geometric applications are not stated in the 
problem situation). 

0 He will require evidence for any important conclusions he is asked 
to accept. 

*) He will have acquired the habit of thinking by carefully graded 
steps as in the deductive proofs of geometry. 

j;) H e will have obtained some idea of algebra applied to geometry and 
vice-versa. 

l) He will have some idea of space geometry. 

.) He will have mastered a number of geometric concepts which are the 
necessary prerequisite for advanced work in mathematics. 

) He will appreciate the contributions of mathematics to the progress 
of civilization.

0 The best way to make geometry interesting and useful is to provide 
the students with many real life problems which apply geometric 
; principles. 

p) Students should be required to stick to one method of solving a 
problem. Individual proofs, all different, even though logical, 
will confuse the students and defeat the aims of geometry teaching. 
|) When a new principle occurs in the study of geometry, it should be 
discussed in terms of the students’ life situations, and for other 
studies if possible, e.g. the baseball game, the street corner 
argument, physics problems. Such a procedure is not really a 
waste of time. 

1) In a subject like geometry, class discussion is largely a waste of 
time. Students learn much more by watching demonstrations or 
doing them themselves. 

i) A geometry textbook should always contain answers to numerical prob¬ 
lems so that students can try again if they get the wrong answer. 

f) Students often want to tackle new problems which would sidetrack the 
main trend of your day-by-day work. A teacher must prevent this.

Study of Progress of Pair of Schools. 

School B (IV) and School D (X) 

Table X - Results of Schools B and D on Test I,- 

The number correct out of a total of sixteen questions in 
Test I is recorded for each student of Schools B and D, The 
students are arranged in order of decreasing mental age. (See 
Table IX) .The mean score of the 18 students of School B on 
Test I is 15.4 with a standard deviation of 2.24, while the 
mean score of the 14 students of School D is 10.4 with a 
standard deviation of 2.74. Thus on the average a B student 
got 3 more questions correct than a D student. 

Also worthy of note is the fact that 16 of the B students 
(89$) scored above the D school mean score while only 7 of 
the D students (50$) scored above this mean score. Also 10 fe 
students (56$) obtained scores above the B School mean score 
while only 3 D students (21$) excelled this mean score. 

The results indicate greater instability on the part of 
School D. Not only do the scores range from 4 to 14 in contrast 
to a range from 8 to 16 for School B but also School D has a 
larger standard deviation. 

Before proceeding with a search for the cause of the 
difference between the scores of School B and D on Test I it 
is necessary to ask the question, "Is this difference significant?" 
That is what chance would there be to get as large a difference 
in random samples of students taken from the same parent 
population.

To determine if the difference between the variances is 

1 

significant we use the technique outlined by Kenney. The 
difference in variance between the two samples gives a value 
of F equal to 1.52. Since the tables indicate 5 chances in 100 
of getting a value of F as large as 2.55 the chances of a value 
as large as 1.52 are even better. Hence we can say the diff¬ 
erence of variances is not significant; the observed instability 
of scores for School D might readily be entirely chance results. 

The Fisher t Test is used to determine the significance of 

2 

the difference of means. The value obtained for P is less than 
.004 o This shows that there are less than four chances in a 
thousand that two random samples from the same parent population 
would have a difference as large as 3.0. Thus the difference 
appears significant. What factors might account for the 
difference?

Table XI - Results of Schools B and D on Test II.- 

The comparison of Schools B and D has yet revealed no 
factor or factors that might account for the general superior¬ 
ity of School B or for School B*s significant superiority of 
3o0 questions out of sixteen in Test I, It has been shown 
that the two schools are equivalent with regard to mental age, 
sex, subjects taken, and nature of the instruction received. 

The possibility of a relation existing between a student f s 
grasp of the logic of the problem and his ability to handle the 
problem being the basic enquiry of this study, the schools 
were examined from this point of view. 

Being entirely objective in nature. Test * can yield little 
information concerning the details of the reasoning process 
used by the pupils. Some of the other tests will needs be 
examined to investigate the possibility that the difference 
between the achievement of the pupils in the "typical” school 
of category B and the achievement of the pupils of category 
D*s type school is due to a difference in the form of reasoning 
used to attack the given problem. 

The results of Test II are first studied. In Table XI 
the number of blanks correctly filled , out <nf a possible of 
79, is entered for each pupil of the two schools. These scores 
are totalled; then the means and standard deviations found. The 
significance of any differences in means or standard deviation 
between the two samples is checked by the same techniques 
outlined in the handling of Test t results.

As the reader might expect if he glances at Chart II 
Page 55, the superiority of School B over School D is not as 
great in Test II as it was in Test I. School B pupils average 
60 o 1 questions correct out of 79 to School D f s 54.6 questions 
correct. However, this average suoeriority of 5.5 questions 
on the part of School B pupils is much less significant on 
79 questions than was the superiority 3.0 questions per pupil 
for the 16 questions of Test I. 

It might be noted that 8 B students (47$) excelled the B 
mean score while only 5 D students (31$) excelled the score. 
Similarly 14 B students (82$) scored above the D mean score, 
while only 6 D students (37$) exceeded this score. 

Also interesting is the greater instability of the D 
students where the standard deviation is 10 o 7 compared with 
7.03 for B students. This same effect may be observed by 
noting the wide fluctuations of scores for D students, part¬ 
icularly at the lower part of the table where the students 
of loY/er mental age are listed. 

In spite of these apparent differences between the 
performance of the two schools on this test the checks for 
significance of difference of both mean and variances are 
applied to determine the probability of obtaining as large 
differences in random samples. In the case of variances

even if these were samples from the same parent population there 

would be slightly better than 5 chances in 100 to get standard 

1 

deviations as widely separated. Fisher f s t Test shows that 

under similar conditions, the probability of obtaining by random 

sampling one sample with mean as much as 5.5 above a second 

2 

sample ! s mean is .048. Thus we must conclude that School 
B*s superiority does not show up as highly significant for 
this test. 

Still certain conclusions can be made from the fact that 
School B f s superiority is less on Test II than it was on Test I. 
Since Test II outlined the solution of the problem, it is 
apparent that the Category D pupils on the whole, do relatively 
better if they are given certain hints regarding the steps in 
the proof. If the outline solutions given to the problems on 
Test II are the reason for D students r better showing on Test 
II, then it follows that their poorer showing on Test I is a 
result of their inability to develop themselves a logical sol¬ 
ution either because of a lack of geometric knowledge or because 
of a failure to see the applicability to the problem of the 
knowledge possessed. An attempt will be made in the subsequent 
work to determine which of these causes operate.

points of significance.

Tables XII and XIV - Results on Corresponding Problems of 

Tests I and IL- As w s stated on page 12, ’’the exercise of 
Test il can almost completely be paired with exercises of 
Test I requiring the same concept.’’ If a student is success¬ 
ful in a Test I exercise and not on the Test II exercise 
involving the same concept, then the only explanation that 
seems possible is that the student has not developed to the 
stage where he can put his thinking into formal pattern. 

a student is successful on a Test II item and not on the 
Test I item then he is apparently able to fill in an outlined 
proof but not able to develop it for himself. The distribution 
of errors in Test I is shown in Table XII, for both B and D 
students*

Since B School did better on Test I than D School It 
should not be surprising that a'higher per cent of the D 
students made errors on most of the questions. In Table XIII 
an attempt is made to pair the questions of Test I - part¬ 
icularly those questions where D students seemed to have 
trouble--with questions of Test II 0 The principles Involved

From the top three rows of figures it is evident that 

the D students made more mistakes than did B students on these 

1 

questions of Test II* The uniformity of the superiority 
even more than its numerical value is the feature which tends 
to indicate a reliable difference; for if no difference in 
ability existed between B and D Schools then each school would 
tend to excell in approximately one-half of the questions. 


1. Two exceptions, questions 40 and 68. Former needs 
investigation.

The nature of Test II should be recalled. Requiring the 
student, in the simpler cases, to fill in the specific 
implications of an indicated theorem, this test supplied to 
the student the advantage of knowing which theorem to apply to 
the problem. Or, in other cases, it was required that the reason 
(or theorem) supporting a given statement be filled in the blank. 
As was Indicated in the description of Test II correct responses 
required not only comprehension of the theorem and its implic¬ 
ations but also an ability to record correctly this comorehension. 
In reality the obtaining of an answer in Test I would appear 
more difficult as the student had to find and decide on the 
theorem to be used. However Test I was easier inasmuch as the 
student did not have to give a logical statement of his reason¬ 
ing -- just get the answer. 

With regard to a pair of questions —- one in Test I and 
one in Test II —- based on the same fundamental principle 
there are the following possibilities:- 

1. Test I question correct; Test II question correct. 

-indicating both a comprehension of the principle and an 
ability to use it constructively in a problem. 

2. Test I question correct; Test II question wrong. 

-This indicates an ability to use the theorem but an 
inability to express this principle logically. 

3. ' Test I question' wrong; Test II question wrong. 

-meaning a failure to understand the principle and hence 
naturally an inability to use it or state it.

4. Test I question wrong; Test II question right. 

This would mean an understanding of the principle but 

lack of power to see its application.to a oroblem. 

Since we are trying to find the reason for the statistic** 
ally significant inferiority of School D on Test I we are 
interested primarily in those cases where the Test I question 
is wrong - classes (3) and (4) above. The errors made on the 
matched questions of Test II were not necessarily made by the 
same students making errors on the Test I question. Table XV 
shows how the students who made errors on Test I questions did 
on the Test II questions. 

For example, 9 D students erred on Blank 1 Test 1. On the 
corresponding questions of Test II 6 of these students gave 
wrong answers and 3 gave correct replies. 

Similarly the other pairs were examined, the results 
being tabulated in Table XV. 

It must be kept in mind that while the number of students 
in the sample is small, the sample is in no way unusual. In 
fact it is hoped that each group is a fair sample of the 
category to which it belongs. Nor are the questions unusual, 
except that they can be paired in Test I and II.

Of 38 

errors made in Test 

I by D students, in 23 cases the 


student indicated, by a correct answer on the corresponding 
Test II question, that he understood the principle involved. 
In 15 cases he did not understand the principle. The figures 
of Table XVI lead to certain tentative conclusions:- 
1. Students* not being able to correctly apply a principle or 
theorem to a problem is responsible for more errors than is 
students* not understanding the theorem or principle.

2. Certain schools obtain poorer results than other schools, 
not because the pupils do not understand the geometry theorems 
involved but because the students have not progressed suff¬ 
iciently to be able to see when a theorem is applicable and 
how applicable to a specific problem. This would seem to 
imply that the students can give correct responses in questions 
on geometrical reasoning but they can not themselves proceed 
using the reasoning process. This might mean that the student 
has progressed to the stage where he understands a geometrical 
concept but can not go ahead himself to use it; or it might 
indicate that the student has memorized responses which he 
does not understand and which are meaningless to him. 

These tentative conclusions will be checked as the study 
progresses. In the first place the achievement of the Schools 
B and D on Tests III and IV will check the conclusions. Also 
the examination of the paired samples from the typical schools 
of Categories A and C will serve as a parallel analysis. 

Results of Schools B and D on Test III. - Test III called for 
the student to give the entire solution himself. With a view 
to getting greater uniformity in the solutions - a uniformity 
designed to facilitate marking - the page was ruled with 
special sections for the work. A place was supplied for the 
figure along with instructions regarding the labelling of the 
figure. To assist the student to think in terms of the 
geometrical facts of the problems, which were not stated in 
geometrical terms, space was provided where the student was

asked to list the items of information supplied in the problem. 
The solution itself was to be placed, a step to a line, with 
the reason for the statement to be placed immediately following 
the statement. The same set of reasons that was used in Test 
II was used in this test, consequently the student was already 
familiar with the list thus enabling him to work more rapidly. 

The marking of Test III was more laborious than the mark¬ 
ing of the two previous tests. There w r ere three respects in 
which the test was marked. First, the number of answers correct 
was found. In five exercises there were a total of seven 
answers required. The number of these answered and the number 
of correct answers were both recorded. Then as a second score 
the student was marked on his transfer of the information of 
the problem into geometrical terms as indicated by his figure 
and his listing of the data under the heading "given”. It 
was not required that the student give the information both 
in the figure and in words but merely that he indicate he had 
realized what geometrical information was available with which 
to work. With a mark of five assigned to each question the 
total possible score for "Interpretation" was 25. The last 
score on this test was given for the solution itself. Here 
again five marks were assigned to each exercise, a perfect 
score being given only if the student had correct statements 
and named the right theorems as authority for each statement. 
The scores in the individual questions and the totals are given 
in Table XVII for the students from Schools B and D.

The results on Test III as revealed in Tables XVI and 
XVII are very illuminating. In School D the pupils secured 
answers in only 39 cases, or an average of 2.4 questions per 
pupil. Five D students had no answers at all. In contrast 
each B student had three or more answers; also on the average 
each B student had answers to 5.9 questions. Of the 39 questions 
completed by D students 21 or 54$ were correct giving an 
average correct per pupil of only 1.3. Seventy-four per cent 
of School B f s one hundred completed questions were right 
giving an average of 3.9 questions per pupil. An application 
of the t test shows the superiority of School B to be highly 

significant both in regard to answers obtained and answers 

1 

correct. The number of answers obtained whether correct or 
wrong was included since it seems to be a mark of superiority 
if the pupil can get as far, as an answer. That is more credit 
goes to the student who can follow a question as far as an 
answer even though, through possibly a small mechanical mis¬ 
take, he does not end up with the right answer. Certainly the 
number of correct answers is a measure of ability in this test. 
Then summarizing we have the scores as follows

The superiority of School B in this part is shown by 

(1) significantly higher mean scores per pupil, 

(2) greater stability of scores (differences of variances 
not statistically significant) and 

(3) the higher ranges in which scores fall 

seems equally as outstanding as that found in Test I. Can 
the reason for the superiority be found or analyzed in the other 
totals of the test? 

The performance of the two schools on Interpretation can 
be summarized as follows

Tests of significance showed the mean for School B as signif-

icantly superior to the mean of School D. The difference in 
standard deviations is not significant. However in the 
matter of mean score per pupil the difference on interpretation 
is smaller than that obtained in the case of answers. This 
might be interpreted to mean that the inferiority of D students 
is not due to an inability to understand the terms involved 
in the problem. This would be as was hoped, for the problems 
were devised with the intention that all students undertaking 
them should be familiar with the vocabulary used and that any 
difficulties would then lie not in the understanding of the

problem but in the geometry of the problem. The results seem 
to show that this object has been achieved with a fair amount 
of success, for in the matter of answers the B School outscored 
the D School almost four to one, while in the matter of inter¬ 
pretation School B scored only approximately half again as high 
as D School. Certainly then this difference in ability to 
interpret the problem will not account for the total difference 
in achievement of the two schools. 

The results on "solution" show greater differences. The 
marks of School B ranging from 4 to 22 average 12.4 per pupil 
with a standard deviation of 5.8; while the marks of School D 
ranging from 0 to 15 average 4.7 per pupil with a standard 

deviation of 3.9. This difference by the t - test shows School 

1 

B significantly superior. What else can be implied from these 
figures? It has already been suggested that the small difference 
in regard to interpretation indicates that the difference 
between the two groups in geometric achievement can not be 
accounted for by saying that the B group has seen more of the 
world about them, is more familiar with the objective world 
in which they live and as a result can see meaning in the 
problems which are "over the head" of the less "worldly-wise" 

D students* This is often a reason given for the lack of success 
that some students have in the study of geometry. The score 
seems to discard this explanation.

If we draw the above negative conclusions from the small 
difference between the scores of the schools in the matter of 
interpretation to be consistent, then, we must conclude that 
the larger difference in the matter of Argument or Solution 
offers a plausible explanation of the difference in geometric 
ability of these two groups of students, which we have selected 
as typical of much larger classes. It might be carrying the 
results too far to say that the inability to reason is the 
CAUSE of the lower scores. Safer it would be to say that the 
inferiority of the second group shows up at this point — a 
point one step closer to the cause than the mere realization 
that the one group is superior to the other. A glance at the 
number of zeros in the solution part of Table XVI shows that 
the D students were completely baffled as to the method of 
attack to use on many of the problems. Actually there were 51 
problems in which the D students did not even get started on 
a solution. This in contrast to 25 problems for the larger 
number of B students. 

The conclusion here suggested corroborates the conclusion 
that was drawn from the results on the schools on matched 
problems of Tests I and II* The conclusion was that the 
student fails to solve the problems because they are not 
"able to see when a theorem is applicable and how applicable 
to a specific problem,’’not because they do not understand the 
problem or the theorem.

The examination of the results of some students seems to 
cast certain doubts on this conclusion which we have just stated. 
For example. Student 50 obtained the correct answer to Exercise 
II, he obtained full marks on interpretation but he received 
no marks for his solution. Student 216 does the same thing 
on Exercise III, While these cases are the exception rather 
than the rule, they apparently contradict the conclusion 
that was stated above. Various explanations might be offered. 

The sceptic might say that these students succeeded in obtain¬ 
ing the answer in spite of the cumbersome technique which 
we impose. Less rash would be the explanation that the students 
were using the methods of logical reasoning subconsciously 
but still were not able to put their thinking processes on 
paper. Another possible explanation is that the student had 
a good neighbor who helped him to the extent of giving an 
answer. Only the one explanation contradicts our conclusion, 
in contrast to the many explanations which can explain the 
phenomena in accordance with the hypothesis. Consequently 
till more information is fcund the tentative conclusion will 
be allowed to stand. 

In summary then. Test III seems to support the hypothesis 
that deficiencies in problem solving ability in geometry are 
usually due to the student*s not being able to proceed with a 
logically developed solution from the data that is supplied.

In the majority of cases this difficulty stops the student 
even though he does understand the problem that confronts 

him. At this stage there is no pedagogical remedy suggested 
to overcome the obstacle or any inference made as to the 
difference in training which has caused the deficiency. 

Results of School B and D on Test IV. - Two tentative conclusions 
have been derived. The first, based on Test II results, states 
that there is Very little difference between groups of students 
of comparable ages in regard to their understanding of the 
theoretical principles of logic. Thus, if two student groups 
are asked specific questions on the theory of logic they score 
approximately the same. The second conclusion that has been 
stated, subject to revision in the light of future findings, 
has to do with the ability of the student to apply known 
theoretical concepts to the solution of the actual problems 
which he encounters in the world around him. *^t appears that 
this is the aspect of problem solving that offers the greatest 
difficulty, and hence the one that most frequently accompanies 
inability to solve problems. This hypothesis was first stated 
as a result of Test II and verified in the results of Test III* 
Test IV is divided into two parts. The one part deals 
entirely in the abstract, theoretical concepts of logic; and 
the other deals with the application of these same concepts 
to actual problems, some of the working man variety, some of the

class room variety. Thus Test IV should offer a further 
basis to check the above conclusions. If the conclusions are 
to be borne out in this test, then the difference between Schools 
B and D should be small on Part I of the test where the stud¬ 
ents need only recognize certain principles of reasoning. 

On Part II where the students must apply these principles 
we should expect a larger difference. 

The results on Test IV are tabulated in Table XVIII.

"Reasons Correct" and "Irrelevant Reasons" are used in the

senses that have already been described.

Testing for significance shows that neither the differences 
in means nor the differences in standard deviations are of 
significant magnitude in Part I of Test IV. There is no 
superiority on the part of either school. That is the two 
schools are equal with regard to ability to respond correctly 
to general questions on the theory of logic. Inasmuch as 
School B has been superior in the logic of geometry this may 
seem at first surprising. For teaching the results are 
evidence that the imparting of a general knowledge of theo¬ 
retical principles is not enough to ensure an ability to 
apply these principles. 

Part II shows a different picture. School B gets 7.6 

conclusions correct per pupil to 5.9 correct per pupil of 

1 

School D - a significant difference. The slight numerical 
superiority of School B in correct reasons is not statist¬ 
ically significant. However, in including only 3.8 irrelevant 

reasons per pupil to 7.7 per pupil for School D, School B 

2 

is definitely superior. There are fewer than two chances 
in a thousand to secure such a difference by chance if the 
two samples were from the same parent population. 

These figures imply that while School B was not superior 
on a test where the principles were left in general terms it 
was significantly superior when asked to apply these principles 
to actual problems. This would bear out the two conclusions 
stated earlier. 


1* Chance probability is less than .0005 
2. C hance probability is less than .002

Summary of Argument from the Study of Schools B and D. - 

Although all visible factors are equal for the two schools, 
still consistently throughout the tests one school is superior 
to the other. If it were a matter of chance, then one school 
would be superior on the one test; the other on the next test. 
The uniformity of School B f s superiority and the magnitude of 
this superiority, especially in Test I, Test III (Answers) and 
Test IV Part II, makes it highly improbable that the difference 
is a matter of sheer chance or of random sampling. 

Since a difference exists the next thing is to find just 
where this difference lies and if possible to find a cause of 
the difference, so that the study might be of some value to 
teachers of Geometry. Certain factors that are commonly 
mentioned when the aptness of a student at Geometry is being 
discussed have been eliminated. Some of these factors are 
I.Q., sex, years in school, likings as indicated by High 
School courses selected and lastly the type of instruction 
being received. The two samples are equivalent in all these 
regards as far as is determinable. 

The results of the tests themselves showed that certain 
other factors were of little significance. The most surprising 
of these is the factor of score on a test dealing with actual 
book problems of geometry. To score highly on problems stated 
in geometrical terms and involving geometrical constructions 
and deductions does not ensure that a high score will be 
obtained where the knowledge must be applied to a problem

stated in non-geometric terminology. No more significant in 
determining pupil ability in this last type of problem is the 
score obtained on a set of questions dealing with principles 
of logic such as the If-Then argument, argument by exclusion, 
arguments involving converses and such fallacies of argument 
as personal attack, assuming a converse, arguing in a circle 
and the use of irrelevant reasons and false authority. A 
knowledge of these principles and fallacies sufficient to rec¬ 
ognize the truth or falsity of statements dealing with them 
is not always accompanied by an ability to apply them to 
problems in such a way as to support an argument or to show 
the error of an erroneous argument. No more effect has a 
knowledge of theorems and constructions as Euclid first set 
them up, upon the pupil*s ability to actually use these to 
solve the type of problems that might some day confront him. 
These conclusions are negative in nature. 

The positive conclusions, that the better a student can 
apply his theoretical knowledge to problems the better he will 
do on these same problems seems almost obvious without a len¬ 
gthy study to reveal it. But has it been so obvious in the 
past? Too often we have assumed that if the truth could only 
be driven into the pupil*s hard head then automatically the 
student would be able to apply the knowledge to any situation. 
This study has discredited any such rationalization. It now 
becomes clear that the student must be given definite experience 
in the application of the knowledge to the type of situation 
in which he must use it. We must be very careful in stating 
that the principles that we are developing in geometry can be 
transferred to other subject matter fields. All that this

study can so far conclude is that actual knowledge does not 
mean useful knowledge. 

It might be argued with some degree of truth that the 
student who can not apply a principle does not really KNOW it. 
This question has been evaded by using terms "know" and "know¬ 
ledge" to indicate the state of mind when the student can res¬ 
pond correctly to the type of question we have put before him 
in Tests II and IV Part I. It might be a memorization of for¬ 
mal statements but it is merely a quibbling over the definition 
of a word to argue on this point. 

One other comment should be made concerning the word usage 
in the study. Throughout the study, the tests, such as Tests I 
and III, calling for the application of concepts have been used 
as the scale according to which the student ! s ability has been 
measured. Why are not the other tests equally as reliable meas¬ 
ures of this ability? n ere the utilitarian concept enters into 
the discussion. When the student starts to make his way in the 
world he will be measured by the extent to which the things he 
knows help? him to adjust his life to his environment. Accord¬ 
ingly the idea that the most satisfactory measure of ability is 
the use to which it can be put has been used in this study. 

A very encouraging observation can be made from the compar¬ 
ison of Schools B and D. In Chapter I the question was asked, 
"Can Geometry be given direct and practical usefulness, and at 
the same time give the pupil certain ideas about the nature of 
proof." The results of School B would give an affirmative ans¬ 
wer to this question, for this school has excelled in the solving 
of problems and has at the same time indicated that it has mast¬ 
ered "certain ideas about the nature of proof" as thoroughly as 
has School D.

Study of the Results of School A and School C 

School I was placed by itself in Category A, not only 
because it gave higher results than any other school but also 
because it seemed a bit unusual. When it is said that this 
school is unusual it is not implied that the students are 
super-normal; but rather it implies that the conditions under 
which they are being trained are perhaps better than average. 

A high percentage of the students have A ratings on their 
Grade IX exams, and all the students are in at least the second 
year of high school. This last fact will mean the majority 
have the advantages of having taken Geometry and geing chron¬ 
ologically one year older. Table IX also showed the average 
mental age to be one year above the other typical schools. By 
the comparison of Schools B and D we saw that difference between 
schools could exist without any of these factors being present. 
The advantages of School A however, must be kept in mind in 
judging the achievements of the two schools. 

Besides these conditions in the student body the inst¬ 
ruction is of a high quality at School A. There is no intention 
to belittle the training given in School C but rather to note 
that School A has a condition not existing in every school. 

The teacher in this school has not only a University back¬ 
ground in Mathematics but in addition has a live interest in 
the relation between the reasoning processes in Geometry and

in the other subject fields. In response to questions 
on the teacher questionnaire he indicates that as principal 
of the school he is trying to get the other teachers of his 
school also to use their courses to develop in the students a 
realization of the significance of the principles of logical 
reasoning. This must be kept continually in mind in evaluating 
the results of this school. We will want to ask ourselves, n How 
well is he succeeding?” and ”ls he sacrificing something else 
to achieve these results?” 

When one considers these factors it is not surprising 
that School I is superior. The records of Schools A and C 
will not be examined in the same detail as were the scores of 
Schools B and D, but rather the results will be used to 
check the hypotheses that have already been stated regarding 
the nature of the superiority,one school over another. 

In Table XIX the total score of each pupil of Schools A and 
C is given for the complete set of tests. For this group 
no attempt will be made to analyze results on the individual 
questions of the test. 

The means and standard deviations have been calculated 
for each test and any differences between those attained by 
the two schools have been tested for statistical significance 9 
The results are discussed following Table XIX.

The results of these two Schools are in many respects 
surprising* A general preview of the relative behaviour of 
the two schools can be obtained from Chart I Page 53. From 
Table XIX the following comments can be made:- 
Test I. - This is the one test where School A falls below 
School C (also below all C category schools - see Chart I). 

The difference between 12.1 correct questions per pupil of 
School A and 12.4 correct questions for School C is not 
sufficiently large to be significant. In regard to stability 
of performance School A is superior (Standard Deviation 2.7 
Standard Deviation 3.0 for School C) but here again the 
difference is not significant. From this we can conclude 
that School A does not get its high rating because the students 
have a highly developed ability to solve everyday problems. 

Test II.- School A has a mean score of 67.7 per pupil with 
Standard Deviation of 6.5 compared to a mean score of 60.3 
and a Standard Deviation of 15.4 from School C. Thus School A 
is superior both in regard to level of score and stability of 
score. Using the technique outlined in the footnote of Page 76 
it is seen that the difference in variances is significant. 

This factor excludes the applying of the Fisher t-test for it 
shows the samples to be from different parent populations. 
However we are justified in saying that the results of the 
Test show School A superior.

In all three scores on this test, School A was superior to 
School C by amounts large enough to be statistically significant. 
The high average score of 25 out of 25 for School A on Inter¬ 
pretation is interesting as indicating a highly developed 
ability to interpret data and transfer it into geometrical terms.

School A excels School C in the number of statements of 
this test to which it responded correctly, but the difference 
is on the border line of significance for it has one chance 
in fifty of occurring even if these were two samples from the 
same parent population. There is very little difference in 
the number of guesses the students of each school made. 
However, School C has significantly more wrong replies per 
student than did School A, Considering the three scores to 
give a composite score on the entire test (e.g. 2R-2W-G) 
then it might be said that School A is significantly superior 
to School C. Recalling the introductory remarks concerning 
the type of instruction given in this school the results 
should not be surprising.

General Conclusions from the Comparative Study of the Two 
Schools A and c .- The superiority of School A In comparison 
with School C seems to be of a different sort to the superior¬ 
ity of School B over School D» The superiority of School A 
shows up most significantly in the general type of question 
relating to principles of logical reasoning. School B, in 
contrast, is superior in the matter of getting the answer to 
some actual problem. What conclusions can be drawn from 
these facts? Do they fall within the range of the hypothesis 
formulated on the basis of the first comparison. 

School A students have been taught extensively in regard 
to the application of, and the generalizations concerning 
the principles of logic, both in the special field of geometry 
and also in other subject matter fields. This instruction 
speaks for itself in the higher scores on Test IV Part I and 
the more judicious selection of reasons and conclusions in 
Part II of the same test. But this knowledge of logic has 
not developed to the stage where it enables the students in 
this School to score significantly higher on Test I. This 
seems to support the hypothesis that a knowledge of principles 
alone, whether of geometry or of logic, is not always accompanied 
by an ability to apply the knowledge. 

Now that we have complete results of School A we can

answer the question raised on Page lo4, ”Is the teacher 
sacrificing something to achieve his results on principles 
of logical reasoning?” Judging by the scores on Test IV 
we can say his students have learned something about the 
process of reasoning* To do this other aspects have not been 
neglected. The pupils of School A score as well in other 
tests as do students of other schools. Teachers should 
find encouragement in these results. Students can be 
brought to a given level of achievement on mechanical 
geometry problems and also be given additional experience 
in reasoning techniques which might be useful in other 
fields. Nor need School A rest in a feeling of having 
achieved the ultimate. There is still boom for improve¬ 
ment. Should not the knowledge of reasoning be able to make 
possible higher score on geometry problems? That is the 
pupils still need further experience in the application of 
their knowledge to practical problems such as Test I uses*

CHAPTER VI 

PUPIL SUCCESS ON THE INDIVIDUAL QUESTIONS OF THE TESTS 

Purpose of the study of the individual questions 

The study of the questions individually and *the relative 
success of the students on the questions was undertaken with a 
view to making the group of tests serve In a diagnostic 
capacity. If it can he found what type of question offers 
to the average student the greatest difficulty, then it would 
be possible for teachers to spend more time on this type of 
question , if it is felt that the accomplishment of a solution 
is of sufficient desirability to warrant the time necessary 
to master the difficulty of the question . The study might 
also reveal where the difficulties lay: and, in the light of 
the discoveries of the earlier sections of the study, attempts 
might be made to remove the cause of the difficulty. 

General Method of Attack 

Only the results of the four "Type" schools were used, 
a procedure which is justifiable if the schools have been 
accepted as typical. Since no attempt is here being made to 
compare the schools, no attempt is made to keep the schools 
separate. Rather the results of all the students who are 
actually taking the geometry course are used to give a 
composite picture*

Those questions on which the students get high scores 
are of interest only inasmuch as teachers should know that the 
students have reached near perfection on this variety, and 
that further drill is not only unnecessary but also, no doubt, 
is discouraging to the student. In this group of questions 
might be placed the following:- 

Question 2 - based on two distinct similar triangles* 
Question 15 - dealing with the radius bisecting the 
perpendicular chord. 

Question 3 - the Pythagorean theorem to find the 
hypotenuse of a right triangle. 

Question 6 - the perpendicular to the hypotenuse of a 

right isosceles triangle makes equal angles. 
Question 8 - relation of the size of angles in an 
isosceles triangle. 

The questions in which the students have the greatest 
difficulty should perhaps be given more detailed study. 
Although there are no very low scores when the results are 
expressed in terms of per cent, still a score of 50 or lower 
is low enough to warrant examination. The questions and the 
principles involved are the following:- 

Question 4 - Calls for the determination of the equal 
sides of a right isosceles triangle when the hypotenuse is 

given. it is interesting to note that this is the same 

$ 

situation that is met in Question I of Test III.

Questions 14 and 15 - Given a diameter perpendicular 
to a chord, and a second chord making a given 
angle with the first chord; the student is 
required to find the distance of the first chord 
from the centre of the circle, and also the 
angle between the diameter and the line joining 
the end of the first chord to the centre of the 
circle*. 

Question 10 - A compound figure involving both parallel 
and perpendicular lines. In this case it is 
likely that the difficulty lies in the involved 
nature of the figure. 

Question 5 - This question involves the same situation 

as number 4, namely the right isosceles triangle 
but this time the student is to find the altitude 

No ostensible differences can be found to exist between 
the problems offering difficulty to students and the problems 
which the students handle readily. In fact we find in this 
test the problems involving the isosceles right triangle 
have a large number of errors while in Test III the problems 
involving the same principle have fewer errors than any others 
The context in which the principle is applied, not the 
principle itself, seems to determine the difficulty pupils 
experience in solving the question.

TEST II 

There are too many questions In this test to arrange them 
singly in order of difficulty, so they were arranged in groups 
according to the number of errors students made on each. It 
was found that the number of students getting a given question 
correct varied from 30 to 90. This range was broken up into 
ten groups each containing a range of six. The questions 
falling into each group are listed in Table XXI.

Question 79 - Only 30 pupils replied correctly. The question 

required only the inserting of the number of the proposition 
that justified saying that since two halves of a triangle 
are congruent therefore two sides are equal and the larger 
triangle is an isosceles triangle. (Note that this again 
deals with an isosceles triangle, although it is not right 
angled. Still the students seem to have trouble with the 
idea.) 

Questions 36, 38, 39 and 40 fall into the groups offering great 
difficulty. (The other blanks of the exercise - 35, 37 - 
are also comparatively low in the distribution.) This 
exercise involves an isosceles triangle where the two equal 
sides are longer than the third side. From one of these 
longer sides a length is cut off equal to the shorter side 
such that a second isosceles triangle is formed inside the 
first. The student is required to prove the two triangles 
are similar and that hence a certain proportion exists 
between the sides. It was the recognizing of the corres¬ 
ponding parts of the inner triangle that seemed to offer 
the greatest difficulty, for blanks 36, 38, 39 and 40 all 
deal with the inner triangle. 

Questions 59 and 64 deal with an equilateral triangle with side 
of given length. A median is drawn. Blank 59 asl^s for 
the length of this median while blank 64 required the 
reason which explains why the median makes an angle of 
thirty degrees with the sides. These particular blanks 
are preceded by a skeleton solution which indicates that 
the two triangles formed by the median should be shown to

be congruent right triangles. The difficulties encountered 
by the majority of the students at this stage seem to 
indicate that they are not capable of applying the prop¬ 
erties of the right triangle in situations which have been 
complicated by lines other than the three sides of the 
triangle. 

Question 71 called for exactly the same reason as did blank 69. 
It might have been the feeling on the part of the student 
that such an immediate repetition must be wrong that 
caused the high frequency of error at this stage. The 
idea itself was not difficult, involving only the prop¬ 
osition which states that perpendicular lines make angles 
o 

of 90 . 


The results on this test indicate that greatest pupil 
difficulty occurs when a geometric figure with which they are 
already familiar is placed in unusual surroundings. It appears 
that a knowledge of the properties of the simple figure do not 
extend or transfer to the more complicated figure. V/e saw 
this to be the case for both isosceles and equilateral triangles. 
The answers oh the earlier questions of Test I show' that the 
students have, in general, mastered the principles concerning 
the common geometric figures when they appear in their simplest 
and most apparent forms, but the same principles are not con¬ 
quered when they appear in more complex situations.

Question I in geometrical terms is nothing more than 
the finding of the altitude and the side of a right 
isosceles triangle. We saw in previous questions that this 
situation offered difficulties to the average student. In 
this test however the students do better on this item than 
on any of the others of the test* How car, this apparent 
inconsistency be explained? In the previous tests where the 
student seemed to have difficulty with the right isosceles 
triangle it was in comparison with other geome trie figures 
which of necessity in a first course of high school Geometry

had to be kept simple. In this Test all the geometrical prin¬ 
ciples are concealed, to a certain degree, behind a real life 
problem. Thus we see while complex figures involving the right 
isosceles triangle do in some cases appear difficult, still in 
general this figure is better mastered for use than are many of 
the other geometrical concepts. This must inevitably lead to 
the conclusion that these other concepts would offer great 
difficulty if called for in complex figures or where the geom¬ 
etric nature of the problem is not immediately apparent. 

Questions IV and II bear out this statement for they are 
comparatively well handled. On examination it is seen that 
the geometry figures involved are simple, one being a single 
isosceles triangle, the other a circle with a chord and a 
perpendicular to this chord. 

The difficulty with Questions III and V seems to lie in 
the complexity of the figure for the concepts themselves are 
basic and simple. Question III involves only parallelism, 
perpendicularity and the sum of the angles in the triangle. 
Question V is nothing more than a rectangle inside a right 
isosceles triangle. Thus while a right triangle in Question 
I is well handled the same concept is poorly handled when the 
geometric figure is more complex in Question V*

Test IV Part I 

As has been described previously this part of the test 
gives pairs of statements concerning both Principles 8nd 
Fallacies of reasoning apolicable both in geometry and in 
other subject matter fields. Table XXIII merely lists 
those pairs and the number of students from the four 
typical schools who reply correctly to each. The information 
was secured from Table III. The pairs are arranged so 
that those offering the least difficulty are first.

With a total of 73 students 1 results included, the 
statements which fewer than 40 pupils marked correctly were 
examined with several questions in mind. In the first 
place the statement itself would be examined to see that 
it is correct, clear and not ambiquous in its wording.

Then it would be wise to ask ourselves the question, M Is it 
worth while that High School students know this principle?” 

If we answer this in the affirmative then, and then only, 
should we become concerned with the poor showing that the 
pupils have made dealing with the statment pair. The reason 
for the pairing of the statement should perhaps be repeated 
at this stage. It was felt that it would eliminate, to a 
large extent, the possibility of a student obtaining high 
score because he had memorized a number of statements. 

Pair 15 and 27, which gave greatest trouble expects the 
student to realize that in every argument there must be some 
starting point, some assumption or unproved proposition, 
and that the existence of this does not invalidate the entire 
argument. This principle, since basic to all scientific thought, 
is very important. Certainly also it is a valuable item of 
knowledge to students who are to be expected to examine crit¬ 
ically the statements of organizers, politicians, insurance 
salesmen and promoters who all claim there isn f t a doubt 
concerning the statements they make. True enough not a very 
large proportion of our adult population apply the principle 
but this makes it no less valuable. Obviously, from the 
results on each pair is a compound even with two possibilities 
to each, a chance distribution for the 73 students would 
result? in 18 correct, 56 guesses and 18 wrong. Only 13 
correct responses on this pair indicates an entire absence 
of understanding.

Pair 9 and 23 is based on the idea that a correct con¬ 
clusion can be reached without every word in the argument 
being formally defined, if the people concerned are in agree¬ 
ment concerning its meaning. This again obtains a score which 
might be accountable for by chance. 

Pair 25 and 34 relates to one of the commonest fallacies 
of both geometry and everyday argument. This fallacy is that 
of using in the argument a statement that is equivalent to 
the assuming of the conclusion to be proved. It is the type 
of thing that the lawyer is doing when he refers to the man 
on trial for murder as ”The Murderer”. Geometry certainly 
offers many chances to bring to the attention of the student 
this fallacy. Situations which are not colored with numerous 
prejudices are available more readily in the field of Geometry 
than in any other field.where the student has a class-room 
teacher. In view of this, the response is very disappointing. 

The Pair 12 and 19 deals with the revelance of the 
reasons in the supporting of an argument. To be useful in 
supporting an argument, a principle in addition to being 
true, must also relate to the argument. Certainly students 
already recognize this concept to a certain extent but still 
they need specific training and drill to make them clearly 
conscious of its wider applications. The Pair 8 and 16 deals 
with the extent to which a dictionary settles disputes concern¬ 
ing the meaning of words. An examination of the statement 
of the above two pairs of principles in the test itself

showed that the wording was not altogether without ambiquity. 
The low score in part might be due to this. Certainly rev¬ 
ision is necessary before the test is used again. 

Included in the test are many concepts which every 
student of the modern world should know and which can be 
taught through the use of geometry. Although in certain 
cases an attempt to keep the statements simple resulted in 
possible ambiquity still the results of Part I of Test IV 
Indicate that many of the concepts involved have not been 
mastered to any degree of perfection by Geometry students. 
However the high scores made on some of the pairs of state¬ 
ments show that a certain amount of progress is being made. 

This should be a challenge to every teacher when he realizes 
that something can be done and needs to be done. 

The results of a group of University students corroborate 

1 

the results obtained from the high schools. The order of 
difficulty was approximately the same - pair 15 and 27 lowest 
score and then pair 9 and 23. There was the same wide range of 
scores. Out of 57 students only 11 were right on pair 15 
and 27; 56 were right on pair 1 and 21. Thus we see there 
is still need of emphasis on this phase at the University 
level.

Test IV Part II 

Several situations formed the basis of this part of 
Test IV. The student was expected to choose the conclusion 
justified by the situation and then to support his choice by 
reference to one or more of the principles of reasoning that 
formed the basis of Part I of the test. Of the 73 students 
from the four typical schools the number getting each con¬ 
clusion correct is recorded. The blanks for conclusions are 
then ordered according to the total number of students getting 
them correct and the results entered in Table XXIV*

Blank 8 which is well handled is based on the idea that 
a correct conclusion can be arrived at without a formal 
definition, if all the parties concerned are in argument 
concerning the meaning of the words involved. It is part¬ 
icularly interesting to note that this idea as pair 9 and 32 
was the second most poorly handled in Part I of this Test. 
The better showing in this context might indicate that many 
students realize the truth of the statement but do not 
recognize it when formally worded.

Blank 5, v/bich Is only recognized correctly by 11 out 
of the 73 stuidents, also deals with definition* It involves 
the recognition of the necessity of agreement concerning 
every word of a definition before the definition is of any 
use in the settling of an argument. What can we conclude 
from the irregular performance with regard to principles 
dealing with definitions? It seems that under favourable 
circumstances - as Blank 8 - pupils can recognize the role 
of definition, but if the situation is more complicated, or 
the v/ording less familiar then the students are no longer 
cognizant of the true nature of the principles involved. 

In replying incorrectly to Blank 12 the students showed 
they had not been trained to recognize the fallacy of an 
argument which both assumed the converse of a theorem and 
assumed in the proof that which was to be proved. We saw 
on Part I of this test that the pupils did not understand the 
latter of these principles. - Pair 25 and 34 - Here is further 
evidence. 

The situation on which Blank 10 is based involves a 
construction which assumes what is to be proven. The student 
was asked whether he would accept a proof based on this 
construction. Table XXIV shows that only about half the 
students recognized the fallacy. 

Blank 14 expects the student to recognize the fallacy 
in an argument which? assumes the converse of a theorem- 
or more accurately uses a theorem where its converse is needed.

The poor results here, along with the results on Elanks 10 
and 12 indicate that even simple fallacies of reasoning 
such as arguing in a circle or assuming a converse are not at 
all uniformly well handled by high school students. 

Following this analysis of conclusions of Test IV Part II 
the use of supporting reasons was considered. Some of the 
reasons could be used to support several conclusions. The 
total number of times the reason was used correctly by all the 
students was divided by the number of places in the test the 
reason could be correctly used. The result was the mean 
number of times the reason was used correctly to support 
each conclusion to which it was applicable. The total number 
of times the reason was irrelevantly used was also recorded 
and this was subtracted from the total correct uses with 
a view to giving for each reason some measure of accuracy 
of use. These figures are included in Table XXV.

We see that statement III dealing with the use of undefined 
hut mutually agreed upon words is used correctly in a large 
number of cases. However it has a large number of irrelevant 
uses indicating that students do not completely understand 
the implications of the statement. Actually there were a 
large number of inconsistent answers regarding this statement 
in Part I of Test IV. Since all the statements to be used in 
Part II were correct the student had merely to recognize that 
the point at issue was a matter of definition in order to be 
able to pick out the correct reason. Also in the field of 
definition is Statement I which seems to be very well handled. 

The wording of this statement is quite simple, a fact which 

1 

might explain the better results. Statement I concerned 
with the importance of definition is relatively well handled. 

The score is higher and the statement has fewer irrelevant 
uses than for any other statement. 

Also well handled is Statement XIII. This theorem 
deals with the necessity of a special case fulfilling the 
conditions of a theorem before that theorem can be applied 
to the case. 

The fallacies of assuming a conclusion that Is to be 
proven, or using the converse of a theorem seem to be well 
understood in theory for Statements VIII and X give high 
scores.

The fact that every deduction is based on some 
unproved proposition as given in Statement XI seems to come 
in for a large amount of misuse. 

The low results on Statement V show that in general 
students have difficulty in recognizing the effect on a 
conclusion that results when the meaning of one of the words 
in a definition is changed. The necessarily longer, more 
involved wording of this statement might in part account 
for the difficulty experienced* 

The figures shown in the last two tables were not 
included here with the purpose of revealing once and forever 
the kind of error that first-course geometry students make 
in the sphere of logic. Rather, the intention was to show 
what is being done in this field and where there is room for 
further work to be done. It can be safely said that the 
students 1 knowledge of these principles of logic is still 
of the theoretical type that is not yet too readily applicable 
to the every day situation. As long as it remains of this type 
and instruction has not yet achieved its maximum possibilities.

CHAPTER VII 


GENERAL CONCLUSIONS OF THE STUDY 

To draw general conclusions from a study of this type 
where most of the work is detailed and specific is difficult, 
for in such an analysis slight changes in the wording of 
questions may have as large effect as changes in the actual 
nature of the problems. This fact may account for any 
apparent inconsistencies between the various parts of the 
study. Many conclusions have been stated in the body of 
the study as results seemed to warrant. These conclusions 
which have already been stated may be grouped into two 
sections: those derived from the comparative study of the 
two pairs of schools and those derived from the study of 
the relative difficulty of the individual questions of each 
test. The summarizing of the conclusions here will be 
directed to the answering of some of the numerous questions 
that have been raised from time to time throughout the study. 

In order that the statement of results might be clear 
the usage of certain phrases should possibly be mentioned 
again. When reference is made to a students * theoretical 
knowledge or his knowledge of theoretical principles, then 
we mean that which is measured by his score on actual tests 
of the older classroom type where he is questioned on general 
principles, either of geometry or of logic, which are not

required to be applied to everyday problems necessitating 
clear and original thinking on the part of the student. 

Test IV Part I checked this type of knowledge in the field 
of logic; Test II and to a lesser extent Test I did the same 
thing in the sphere of geometry. The "practical knowledge" 
of a student has been measured by Tests III and Test IV Part II. 
The problems or situations in these tests were commonplace 
and everyday. Consequently it was felt that the ability to 
apply the principles mentioned above could appropriately be 
termed "practical". 

Conclusions from the Comparative Study of Schools. 

One truth is apparent from the results that have been 
examined. This truth is that there is not always a relation 
between pupil 1 s knowledge of theoretical principles of 
reasoning or of geometry and his ability to actually solve 
problems. The results time and time again brought out 
this fact. 

In comparison of School B and School D there was 
no significant difference in the knowledge of the two schools 
on theoretical concepts either of geometry or of logic, but 
still School B was much superior when it came to the actual 
solving of problems. This was evidenced by the many cases 
in which a student obtained the correct answer in Test II

where an outline of solution was supplied, but did not 
get the equivalent Test I problem where he had to go ahead 
and supply his own solution. Also In Test III we saw that 
there was little difference between the two schools in the 
matter of interpretation, but still School B did noticeably 
better in regard to solution and hence also in the matter 
of correct answers. 

The comparison of Schools A and C illustrated this 
divorce between theoretical knowledge and practical know¬ 
ledge in a different manner. School A did not do much 
better than its mate in regard to the solution of actual 
problems even though it was noticeably superior in regard 
to theoretical knowledge of concepts of both logic and 
geometry. The superior theoretical knowledge of School A 
shown in Test IV Part I did not automatically result in 
superior practical knowledge. When the teacher quest¬ 
ionnaire of School A was examined tt was pointed out that 
this teacher has a particularly keen interest in the 
logical aspects of geometry. Consequently it is reasonable 
to assume that he would stress these aspects in his teaching. 
Hence the high score of his school on Test IV Part I. The 
point to notice here is that, even with this superior 
training and knowledge in theoretical principles, his 
school did not score significantly' superior to the 


matched school

The pedagogical implications of this is that to instruct 
a class in the geometric theorems of the type laid down by 
Euclid and to elaborate on the abstract principles of reason¬ 
ing is not sufficient if utility is to be an outcome. Know¬ 
ledge of theoretical principles alone is not sufficient to 
assure that the student can either solve mathematical prob¬ 
lems where his geometric knowledge is sufficient or that he 
will extend his reasoning techniques to other types of subject 
matter. It would appear that it is necessary to instruction 
in the above and in addition give the pupil actual experience 
in the application of the knowledge to situations in which 
he finds himself. These findings are in accordance with the 
results of Rolland Smith referred to on Page 2 of this 
study. To the question raised on Page 4 concerning the rel¬ 
ation between a student*s ability to solve actual specific 
problems and his mastery of the logic of the problems, the 
results would answer that there is no clear cut relation 
discernable. 

Conclusions from the Study of the Individual Problems of 
the Tests. 

1 

Early in the study the hope was expressed that the 
study would yield specific information concerning the type 
of problem offering greatest difficulty. However no general 
statement as to the type of problem follows from the study 
of the various items of the tests. Rather we are led to 
the opinion that it is the context in which a principle

is located that determines its difficulty to the average pupil 
Thus if a problem involving the right isosceles triangle 
appears in a simple set-up, then the student applies his 
knowledge with a degree of facility. But if the same 
knowledge is called for in a problem where there are more 
factors involved, where the figure is more complex, or 
where the information is not given in the exact form in 
which it is required, then the pupil response will indicate 
that the problem is too difficult for the majority of the 
students o 

This generalization has practically the same pedagogical 
implication that was made above; namely that some of the 
instruction time - even a large proportion - should be spent 
in the actual solving of problems. It is to be noted that 
none of the schools examined did poorly on the theoretical 
tests and then turned around and did well on the practical 
tests. As a result we can still say that the theory is 
necessary but this same theory must be applied. 

-^n the outlining of the purpose of the investigation 
the question, "Can geometry be given direct and practical 
usefulness and at the same time give the pupil certain ideas 
about the nature of proof?" was asked. Now we should be 
in a position to answer this question. Geometry is pract¬ 
ical and useful if the student can use it to solve the

everyday type of problem such as was given to him in 
Test III, He has gained "certain ideas of the nature of 
proof" if he can score well on Test IV and on Test II, 

Have any Schools done superior work in both fields? School 
I of Category A did especially well in regard to the ideas 
concerning the nature of proof and at the same time did 
as well as most of the schools in actual practical 
problems. Then in this school the teaching of geometry 
has accomplished this dual role of being practical and 
at the same time giving some notion of the nature of proof. 
What has been done once can be done again. This then is 
the challenge that the study offers to every teacher.

leral Direc tions: 


You have been given an answer sheet to go with this test. Fill in 
3 blank spaces at the top of your answer sheet. 

No time limit has been set for this test. If possible, sufficient 
ne should be allowed for the completion of all the problems. About 
sty minutes will probably be sufficient. 

Do not put any marks on this test booklet. 

You will find in this test booklet a number of problems, each of 
Lch is a situation from everyday life. You are asked to consider the 
asoning process used in each situation. 

AN EXPLANATION OF SOME TERMS USED IN THIS TEST 


iirect Argument : 

In an indirect argument a number of possible causes or conditions are 
isidered. All are eliminated except one, which then becomes the 
iclusion. 

Example: "According to Holmes, there were only four ways of entering 

$ room--through the door, through the window, down the chimney, or 
rough the trap-door in the ceiling. The thief did not enter through 
■> door, nor through the window, and the chimney was too small for him 
| enter that way, so he must have entered by the trap-door ." 

In this example of indirect argument the underlined statement is the 
iclusion. 

i verse : 

A proposition which interchanges the subject and predicate of another 
position. 

Example: Proposition:--All figures with four' right angles 

are rectangles. 

Converse:-All rectangles are figures with four 

right angles, 

SAMPLE PROBLEM 

The members of a high school class in Social Studies were discussing 
seizure of parts of China by Japan, and all agreed that^a nation is 
tified in demanding the return of former territory. As Henry put it, 
ce an area has belonged to a country, it should remain a possession 
that country. In too many cases unjust wars by a powerful aggressor 
e stripped a country of her rightful territory". 

When John pointed out that since Quebec province once belonged to 
nee, France could rightfully demand its return as a colony , everybody 
ghed.

irections : 

Assume that all the above statements are true, except the 
ne underlined. Use only the data given in the problem. According 
o the principles of logical reasoning with which you are familiar, 
ndicate what you think of the underlined statement by choosing one of 
he following conclusions. 


nclusions : 

John proved that France could rightfully demand the return of Quebec 
province as a colony. 

John did not prove that France could rightfully demand the return 
of Quebec province as a colony. 

More information is needed to decide whether or not John proved 
that France could rightfully demand the return of Quebec province 
as a colony. 


)te: 

Since you are to assume that all the given statements (except the 
le underlined) are true, you must accept as true that all the class 
$reed that a nation is justified in demanding the return of former 
;rritory. Further, you must also accept as true that Quebec province 
ice belonged to France. Your conclusion about John 7 s reasoning should 
\ conclusion (A), above. 

Henry f s statement, and the fact that everybody laughed, are addi- 
i.onal facts not required in determining which conclusion to choose. 


rections : 

Choose the reasons which support or explain the logic of 
ur conclusion. 


sons : 

The word "territory 5 ' must be defined before we can decide whether or 
not John proved his point. 

John deserved to be laughed at for such a silly statement. 

If we accept certain assumptions, then to be logical we must accept 
the conclusion which follows from them. 

John was trying to stir up racial prejudice in Canada. 

; Canada was at one time a possession of France.

Britain gained Canada as a result of war. 

We must admit that France could rightfully ask for the return of 
Quebec province as a colony if we agreed that Quebec was formerly 
French territory, and that a nation is justified in demanding the 
return of former territory. 

No schoolboy such as John can argue about questions whioh baffle our 
great statesmen. 

Some of the students may not have agreed that a nation is justified 
in demanding the return of former territory.

The important statements are those which are related to the

inclusion which follows from these premises. 

The statements to be chosen are numbers 3 and 7. 

Where reasons add to or contradict the data of the problem, re-

Problem 1. 


- 4 - 


''The members of a science class, as a result of an argument, decided 
;hat they would disregard any conclusions they held at the moment and 
experimentally determine whether sound required a medium such as air to 
; ravel in. An electric bell was set ringing and together with a pressure 
puge, was placed in a bell jar. e bell jar was then connected to a 
rubber hose which led to a fixed air pump in the basement. The gauge 
reading gradually declined to 2 pounds per square inch. At that time the 
’inging of the bell sounded much fainter than before. 

Albert, a member of the class, when considering the results of this 
experiment, argued that he knew that air had been removed from the bell jar 
eecause the ringing of the bell was fainter. 


Directions : Use only the data given above. Assume that the above 

statements, except the one underlined, are true. Indicate what 
you think about the underlined statement by choosing one of the follow*- 
ing conclusions according to the principles of logical reasoning with 
which you are familiar. 


INCLUSIONS : 

i. Albert proved that air had been removed from the bell jar. 

3. Albert did not prove that air had been removed from the bell jar, 

L More information is needed to decide whether or not Albert proved 
that air had been removed from the bell jar. 

erections : Choose the reasons which support or explain the logic of 

your conclusion. 

iSASONS : 

. A changed definition will lead to a changed conclusion even though the 
argument from each is logical. 

. Only a fool would say that air had been removed from the bell jar so 

i Albert, couldn’t have proved that it had. 

. Since the class agreed to disregard any conclusions they held at the 
moment, Albert is not justified in arguing that air had been removed 
from the bell jar because the bell sounded fainter. 

, The pressure gauge registered 2 pounds per square inch so the air 
had been pumped from the jar. 

. The word ’’fainter' * 1 * * * * * * 8 must be defined before we can decide whether or 
not Albert proved that air had been removed from the jar. 

, It is false reasoning if you use the statement you set out to prove 
as an argument in the proof. 

j. We must accept the conclusion which follows logically from an 
assumption which we have already accepted. 

. Albert wanted the bell to ring fainter so that he could show that air 
had been removed from the bell jar. 

Albert gave a good reason for saying that air had been removed 
from the bell jar. 

One cannot tell from the readings of the pressure gauge whether air 
had been removed from the bell jar or not. 

Albert proved his point because the school janitor, on hearing c± the 
discussion, stated that he was sure that sound required a medium to 

travel in. . 

Since it had not yet been determined that sound requires a medium to 

8 travel in, Albert is assuming the conclusion that the class set out 
to prove.

operating a restaurant.

"A high school class in English had a debate ’Resolved that the use 
cosmetics should be freely permitted in school’. At noon, Hazel and 
my continued the argument as follows: 

)NY:--"You girls just want to ’high hat’ the high school boys, You doll 
up so that the older boys will take you out". 
lZEL:- m ’Taint so. Using cosmetics improves a girl’s appearance and 
makes her attractive.” 

>NY:-- u What do you mean by ’girl’?" 

.ZEL:-”A high school girl. Appearing attractive gives a girl more 
confidence and so improves her personality. 15 
)NY:--"Yes, but a painted doll looks terrible. You have no discretion. 

Girls shouldn’t be allowed to use cosmetics in school”. 

.ZEL:-”I have too got discretion.’ Anyway, the use of cosmetics improves 
a girl’s personality, and anything that will improve a girl’s 
personality should be used by girls”. 

NY:--”I agree with everything you said so far, except that you haven’t 
any discretion * 1 '. 

ZEL:- "Then you must a d mit that cosmetics should be used by high school

frictions : Put yourself in Tony’s place’ Choose one of the following 

‘conclusions, 

EX CLUSIONS : 

To be logical, Tony must admit that cosmetios should be used by high 
school girls. 

Even if he is perfectly logical, Tony still does not have to admit that 
cosmetics should be used by high school girls, 

! Even if Tony is perfectly logical, we need more information to enable us 
to decide whether or not Tony must admit that cosmetics should be used 

I by high school girls. 

rections: Choose the reasons which explain or support the logic of 

r_y our conclusion. _______ 

-4S0NS: 

HSince Tony agreed to all of Hazel’s statements except that she haddiscre- 
tion,he must admit the logical conclusion which follows from these statements. 
Cosmetics should have some definition such as "lipstick, rouge, powder, 
and mascara” before we can decide whether or not Tony must admit Hazel’s point. 
Tony was insulting and talked like a smart alec instead of arguing, 

Iso he should admit Hazel’s point. 

'It is quite true that painted dolls look terrible and that most high 
|school girls have no discretion, so Tony need not admit Hazel’s point. 
When one changes a definition, the conclusion is changed even though 
the argument used is still logical. 

Bronx High, the best high school in the City of New York, encourages 
girl students to use cosmetics. 

If one accepts certain assumptions, even though the conclusion which 
logically follows is not necessarily true, it should be accepted. 

‘lust as a brightly painted barn doesn’t look attractive, a girl with 
;crimson lips doesn’t, so Tony should not have to admit Hazel’s point. 
'Hazel must be the kind who wants to flirt with the high school boys 
and that is why she thinks high school girls should use cosmetics. 

We need to know whether Tony’s statement that no high school girl ever 
has any discretion, is correct. 

In a logical proof the statement one set out to prove cannot be used 
,as an argument. 

I Since Tony must admit that cosmetics should be used by high school 
girls he cannot be a logical arguer.

A young Nazi prisoner one day had an argument with his guard. Here 
part of it: "Some of Herr Hitler T s conquests have been brilliantly 
anned. Take the occupation of Norway. The surprise element was 
Lectively used. Look how astonished the stupid English swine were! 
rwegian sympathizers were carefully employed to the best advantage. Co- 
iinated sea and air attacks were made with small losses. Anything that 
brilliantly planned is worthy of admiration. The pictures in the Art 
llery at the Louvre are famous because they combine a careful and 
illiant planning with masterly execution. A great and beautiful build- 
g like the Empire State Building has to be brilliantly planned. You 
st admit that some of Herr Hitler’s conquests are worthy of admiration , 
il Hitler.’ Down^nTlTTemocracyl 11

i deserved admiration. __ _ _

[more information is needed. 

The prisoner did not prove that some of Hitler’s conquests are worthy 
of admiration. 


sections: Choose the reasons which support or explain the logic of 

your conclusion. 


.SONS: 


Nothing such a treacherous, callous brute as Hitler (the murderer of 
women and children) does, deserves any admiration. 

The prisoner and guard must agree on the definition of "brilliantly 
planned" before we can decide whether or not the prisoner proved his 
point. 

The prisoner wants to destroy democracy and called the English "stupid 
swine", therefore he could not possibly have proved that some of 
Hitler’s conquests are worthy of admiration. 

If one agrees that anything brilliantly planned deserves admiration f 
and that the conquest of Norway was brilliantly planned, the prisoner's 
conclusion follows. 

|The prisoner was trying to convert the guard to Nazism so that he 
$ could escape. 

£ A changed definition leads to a changed conclusion even though the 
(argument from each is logical. 

|ln such an argument as this we must consider Hitler’s conquest of all 
■other countries, not only Norway, before we can be sure of the correct¬ 
ness of the conclusion. 

pThe conclusion is not necessarily true, but if one accepts the premises 
on which it is based, to be logical one must accept the conclusion. 

IPhe famous airman, Col. Charles A. Lindbergh, admires some of Hitler’s 
vorfcs. 

» ?he prisoner was abusive but he showed that if some of Hitler's 
conquests have been brilliantly planned and anything brilliantly 
planned is worthy of admiration, then some of Hitler’s conquests are 
orthy of admiration.

A speaker at a business men’s banquet told the following story: 

^Despite the shortage of man power in vital defence industries, our 
g cities are still crowded with ''bums’ and ’dead-beats’. Just the 
her day a big strapping fellow with toes out at his boots and a three 
y’s growth of beard, came up to me and pleaded: ’Nickel for a cup of 
ffee, liister?’ 

’Shame on you’, I replied, ’Have you no self-respect, to be begging 
,en Canada’s war industries need men for the defence of democracy? 5 

The dirty bum got quite huffy and replied, ’Respectable people want to 
rk. I want to work. I’ve looked high and low for work. I’ll have 
u know that I have plenty of self-respect. I’m a respectable man’ .” 


irections : Assume that the above circumstances are true, and that 

;he statements attributed to the ’bum’ are true, except the one 
Underlined. Indicate what you think about the underlined statement 
y selecting one of these conclusions: 


INCLU S IONS :

I More information is needed to decide whether or not he proved that 
he is a respectable man. 

The ’bum’ proved that he is a respectable man. 


i rection s: Choose the reasons which support or explain the logic 

of your conclusion. 


iSONS : 


A person with plenty of self-respect must be respectable. 

A man claimed that ho had looked for work but we must have more informa¬ 
tion about this because one cannot rely on the statements of a ’bum’. 

The conclusion is not necessarily true, but if one accepts the premises 
on which an argument is based, to be logical he should accept the 
conclusion which logically follows. 

Before we can decide 'whether or not he proved his point we must have a 
precise definition of : 'respectable". 

The man probably wasn’t a ; 'bum’ but the speaker was a prosperous 
business man so he tried to picture the man as a ’bum’ deliberately 
so that the speaker himself might appear in a more favourable light. 

Even respectable people sometimes can’t find work. The poor man might 
have been starving. 

The ’bum accepted without proof the truth of the converse of the 
statement, :? Respectable people want to work". 

If one changes a definition the conclusion which logically fellows is 
also changed. 

(The chairman of the banquet, at the conclusion of the address,stated 
that no respectable men were unable to find work nowadays. 

The ’bum’ assumes the conclusion he set out to prove when he said, 
j”I have plenty of self-respect” „ 

The converse of a true statement is not necessarily true. 

In a logical argument one cannot use the conclusion one set out to 
prove as part of the argument.

The following item recently appeared in a school paper: 

LUSCAR HOCKEY TEAL BEST 

’’The Inter High School League, made up of Luscar, Bella, Setter, and 
ayville high school hookey teams, is approaching the play-offs. Because 
the lack of finance the number of games has been limited. Here is the 
anding in the games which have been played so far: 

Jan. 21 Bella beat Setter 7-2 

Feb. 3 Trayville beat Bella 5-1 
Feb. 15 Luscar beat Trayville 5-3 

One of these teams must be the best. The best team, of course, always 
is any well-conducted hockey match. ’Vith the able refereeing of Spike 
£ernan, all the Inter High School League games have been well conducted 
Is year, which is in sharp contrast with last year f s showing. 

Loyal sportfans who analyze the above figures and arguments will con- 
ide with Sportswrite that Luscar team is the best in the Inter High 
lool League . Luscar should win the Trophy, ''--by Sportswrite. 


j-rec tions : You are to assume that all of the above statements, except the 
lie underlined, are true. On the basis of the above data, indicate what you 
link about the underlined statement by choosing one of these conclusions. 
JCLUSIONS :

IMore information is needed to decide whether Sportswirte did or did not 
prove that Luscar team is the best. 

Sportswrite proved that Luscar team is the best, 

Ire ctions : Choo‘se the reasons which support or explain the logic of 
""your conclusion, 

SONS: 

;Sportswrite assumes that Luscar team is the best and uses that as an 
argument,, 

'Amateur forecasters about hockey usually need an ice bag to cool them off. 
iThe girl-friend of the Luscar coach gave Sportswrite a hot tip that the 
team was best. 

|A changed definition leads to a changed conclusion even though the 
argument from each definition is logical. 

Just because Sportswrite showed that Bella beat Setter, Trayville beat 
Setter and Luscar beat Trayville, doesn ? t mean that Luscar is the best 
team. 

In a sound argument one cannot use the conclusion one set out to prove 
as part of the argument. 

jJe must have a proper definition of the word "best" before we can 
decide whether or not Sportswrite proved that Luscar team is best. 

Since Sportswrite stated that one team must be best, and according to 
his definition and the scores, showed that Setter team wasn*t best 
(Bella beat it), Bella team wasn’t best (Trayville beat it), and Tray- 
ville team wasn't best (Luscar beat it); Luscar team must be the best 
team. 

pportswrite proved that the best team in this year f s Inter High School 
League wins any game it plays. 

tn an indirect argument we must consider all the possibilities and 
eliminate all except one, which becomes the conclusion. 

Tust as the best side wins a war, so the best hockey team wins the game. 

8 [f we accept the assumptions on which an argument is based, to be 
Logical we must accept the conclusion which logically follows, even 
though this conclusion is not necessarily true.

According to Alberta Law, the only reasons for which a student may 
excused from attendance at school are: 

If he is sick. 

If he is over 15 years of age. 

If he is at necessary work by permission of the Principal of the school 
or a Justice of the Peace (for periods of not over six weeks). 

If he has passed Grade VIII and further instruction is not offered in 
his local school. 

If the Department of Education is satisfied he is receiving adequate 
instruction at home. 

In September, a farm bey, Kenneth Brown, had missed two weeks of 
hool. The teacher knew he couldn't be 15 for another half year. He 
jdn't passed Grade VIII. He wasn't receiving any instruction at home-- 
j fact, he was helping with the harvesting. The family was very poor 
p could not afford to hire any help. The Principal of the school had 
t given his permission for Kenneth to'v/ork at home. 

i The teacher concluded that his absence from school was not exousable 
1 notified the attendance (truancy) officer.

frSONS : 

Kenneth might have been sick and so missed the two weeks of school. 

|The teacher was picking on Kenneth to report him in the circumstances 
given. 

If one accepts the assumptions on which an argument is based, to be 
ilogical he must accept the conclusion which logically follows. 

We must have a precise definition of ’'excusable”, "necessary work”, 
land "adequate instruction" before we can decide whether or not he 
'should be excused. 

jThis teacher must have been one of those fussy ones who always stick 
to technicalities. 

A sound indirect argument considers all the possibilities and 
eliminates all but one. 

When one changes a definition the conclusion is changed even though the 
argument from each definition is logical. 

Farm boys should not be allowed to help with harvesting even though 
the family may be poor, because education is so important. 

Since Kenneth's absence was not excusable the teacher was justified in 
notifying the attendance officer. 

When fighting a war every man must do his part>, so when the family is 
fighting a war against poverty, Kenneth must help with the farm work. 
Kenneth might be working on permission of a Justice of the Peace, 
psing the conclusion one set out to prove as an argument is not sound 
reasoning.

A university student was reading a book on "How Men Think" when he 
as struck by this statement: 

"A critical thinker can recognize problems, weigh evidence and draw 
arranted conclusions and generalizations from, the data given". 

"Well," he said, "I can recognize problems and weigh evidence. I 
an also draw warranted conclusions and generalizations from the data 
iven. Although the author has not defined a critical thinker in this 
tatement, I believe it is true as far as it goes". 


irections : Let us assume that the student could do all these things he 
aid he could and let us accept in the same way as the student did, the 
ruth of the above statements about a critical thinker. Indicate what 
ou think of the underlined statement by choosing one of the following 
b nclusions: _ 


"I conclude", said the student, " That I am a critical thinker ". 
ONCLUSIONS :

b More information is required to decide whether he did or did not prove 
that he was a critical thinker. 


recti ons: Choose the reasons which support or explain the logic of 
your conclusion. 


AS ONS: 


A straightforward definition of "critical thinker" is required before 
we can decide Y/hether or not he proved his point. 

This student just boasted about himself instead of giving sound 
arguments so he showed he wasnH a critical thinker. 

The book "How Men Think" may not have been written by a reliable author 
who is an authority on Psychology and Logic. 

Without any proof, the student accepted the converse of the statement, 
"A critical thinker can recognize problems, etc.", as true. 

Changing the definition will change the conclusion even though the 
argument from each definition is logical. 

A sound indirect argument considers all the possibilities and elimin¬ 
ates them all except one. 

Just as a person who is free, white and 21 can vote, so a person who 
can recognize problems, weigh evidence, etc,, is a critical thinker. 
Since the student has eliminated all the possibilities by showing he 
can recognize problems, weigh evidence, etc., the remaining possibility 
must be correct and he has proved that he is a critical thinker. 

[Having accepted the truth of certain statements, to be logical we must 
accept the conclusion which logically follows even though it is not 
necessarily true. 

Since the student failed to show that he had all the qualities of a 
critical thinker listed in the quotation given, he did not prove that 
he is a critical thinker. 

The converse of a true statement is not necessarily true.^ 

The student f s teacher of English remarked in class just two days 
before, that this student was a careful, critical thinker.

-- " HEAVY SNO V. STORK FLATTENS CROPS 11 

"Old timers say that never before in their memory has such an early 
term occurred. Driven for five hours by a heavy wind, the granular snow 
Lattened all early crops. Farmers report that losses will be heavy". 
-From Granham Times, August ±2. 

Conrad lietz, a farmer of Granham area, had his crop insured against 
ill with the Mutual Hail Insurance Co. Immediately after the storm, he 
Jlephoned Granham for a hail insurance adjuster. The local agent report- 
1, after a time, that the Head Office refused to send out an adjuster 
jeause there was no hail. 

Mr. Metz wrote the following letter to the company: 

"I estimate a 30% loss from the hail storm of Aug. 12. The news- 
ipers reported snow; but the local teacher and all my neighbouring 
irmers will testify that the storm was driving hail. A heavy thunder- 
;orm with some rain preceded the hail. 

Since my farm is heavily mortgaged, I badly need the money. My 
,fe has been sick all summer. If you do not pay on my claim at once I 
[hall sue the company". 

The company still refused to pay, claiming that there was no hail. 

)irections : Using only the above data and the principles of logical 
’easoning with which you are familiar, select one of the following 
onclusions . 

INC LUSIONS : 

The company should pay the insurance. 

The company should not pay the insurance. 

More information is required before we can decide whether or not the 
i company should pay the insurance. 


jirections : Choose the reasons which support or explain the logic of 
i_ your concl usion.__ 

ASONS : 

The word "hail" must be accurately defined. 

The Granham Times reported snow and one can surely rely on anything 
that appears in print. 

The farmer was a fool to think that just because he said it was hail, 
the company would pay the claim. 

A rich insurance company should certainly pay a poor farmer so 
; obviously in need as Mr. Metz was. 

!A changed definition changes the conclusion even though the argument 
ijfrom each definition may be logical. 

I The insurance company was merely trying to get out of paying the 
I claim by stating that there was no hail. 

Mr. Metz is assuming the conclusion when he says that the storm was 
hail. 

1 Since Mr. Metz in his letter as quoted, claimed that the local teacher, 
the minister and several other prominent citizens could testify that 
! the storm was hail,it probably was hail. 

|In a sound argument, one cannot use the conclusion one set out to 
prove as a reason to support the argument. 

;If there was a hailstorm then the company should pay the insurance, 
r. Just as rain in winter usually turns to snow, a hailstorm in summer ends 
Bup with snow, then rain; so the storm was hail. 

t The conclusion is not necessarily true, but if we accept the premises 
; on which an argument is based, to be logical we should accept the 
Hconclusion which logically follows.

Jans summed up her report on ' Democracy as a Jay of Life" to the 
Dial Studies class as follows: 

"I have produced evidence to show that there are really only three 
ids of government in the world today: communist, fascist and democratic, 
lave shown that conditi. in& Germany, with communist and 

scist governments respectively, do not the needs of the common 

iple. I also demonstrated that in all other fascist or communist govern- 
countries, the common pe 're not satisfied. Hence, democracy "is 

j only for m of govern ment which satisfies the common people. T ' 


Lrections : Let us assume that Jane provided convincing facts to show 
lat conditions in all fascist and communist governed countries are un- 
itisfactory for the common people. Let us also assume that according to 
le definition she used, there are only three types of government in the 
)rld today (communist, fascist, democratic). Using only these data and 
le principles of logical reasoning with which you are familiar, choose 
le of the following conclusions.. 

ALLUSIONS: " ' “ “ 

[Jane did not prove that democracy is the only form of government which 
satisfies the common people. 

Jane proved that democracy is the only form of government which satis¬ 
fies the common peonle. 

There is not sufficient information given to decide whether Jane did or 
did not prove that democracy is the only form of government which 

s ati sfies t h e c. o mmc n pe o p 1 e « ____ 

A ctionsT "Uhoose the reasons which support or explain the logic of 
vour conclusion. 


SONS: 

We must know how Jane defined "communist, fascist and democratic" before 
we can decide whether she proved her point. 

The only thing Jane proved was that the saying "Fools rush in where 
jangels fear to tread" applies to her. 

G-oebbels claims that the common people of Germany are satisfied, and we 
require more information to know whether his claims are correct. 

Since we are told to assume that Jane proved that conditions in all 
fascist governed and communist governed countries are unsatisfactory 
for the common people, and since democratic government is the only one 
left, then democracy must be the only form of government which 
'satisfies the common people. 

til an indirect argument one must eliminate all the possibilities except 
pne and then accept the remaining possibility,as it stands, asthe conclusion, 
fane Ns arguments were silly because she wanted to please her teacher and 
he knew she must favour democracy as a way of life to do that, 
he conclusion may or may not be true, but if we accept the premises on 
hich it is based, to be logical we must accept the conclusion which 
o gic ally fc11ows. 

l changed definition leads to a changed conclusion evon though the argu- 
ent from each is logical. 

ane showed that fascist and communist governments are unsatisfactory to 
he common people, which left democracy as the only remaining kind of 
overnment. but she did not show that it satisfies the common people, 
ane ? s father said just the night before Jane gave the report that the 
eople of Russia and Germany were on the verge of open revolt. 

school in which the teacher keeps good discipline is better ordered 
han one where students run wild. Similarly, the good order kept by 
ascist or communist governments satisfies the common people better 
han a democratic government doss. 

ccording to the statements Jane made in the summary of her report there 
ight be'"many more than just three kinds of governments in the world todgy.
