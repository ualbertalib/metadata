ABSTRACT 


This thesis reports on the effects of various 
growth regulating substances applied at various rates and 
in various ways to certain crop plants including potatoes, 
spring wheat, winter wheat, flax, red clover, sweet 
clover, alsike clover and alfalfa. 

Soaking of potato eyepieces in solutions of 
various chemicals before planting failed to accelerate 
emergence or increase yield. Emergence was decreased and 
delayed and tuber yields reduced by as much as 72 per cent 
by certain chemical treatments. 

Spraying of winter wheat and spring wheat with 
growth substances was without effect. Variation in 
susceptibility of flax to damage from similar concentrations 
of various chemicals was recognized. 

Application of herbicidal sprays to sweet clover 
and alfalfa showed that sweet clover could not be success¬ 
fully weeded from alfalfa by 2,4-D derivatives. Top 
growth of alfalfa and sweet clover was very susceptible to 
2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxy- 
acetic acid, but their roots possessed marked resistance. 
Soil applications of phenoxy compounds at time 
of planting showed that very small quantities of these 
chemicals in the soil would decrease emergence of alfalfa, 
sweet clover, red clover and alsike clover. Emergence

stimulation was apparent at certain concentrations but was 
too greatly affected by environmental conditions to be 
consistently predictable. 

Certain low rates of phenoxy compounds sprayed 
on alfalfa throughout the flowering period significantly 
increased seed set but the margin of safety between 
rates causing increase or decrease was narrow. 

Possible practical applications of the various 
results are discussed.

SOME EFFECTS OF VARIOUS CHEMICAL TREATMENTS 
ON LEGUMES AND CERTAIN OTHER CROPS 


INTRODUCTION 


The Increase in the practical applications of 
plant growth regulators within the last decade has opened 
a vast field of research. Investigations mostly confined 
to selective weed control and weed eradication have 
resulted in the present multi-million dollar business in 
synthetic hormone herbicides of which 2,4-dichlorophenoxy- 
acetic acid is a major product. Although 2,4-D has been 
widely advertised and used as a herbicide there are other 
important uses of this and similar chemicals. Already 
many specialized uses have been found for these substances 
in horticultural work. Methods of chemical growth control 
have been effective in connection with rooting of cuttings, 
induction of dormancy in tubers and nursery stock in storage, 
the breaking of dormancy in tubers, production of flower 
clusters in place of leafy branches, stimulation of bud- 
growth, blossom thinning, control of flowering, influence 
on fruit set and control of preharvest drop of fruits. 

Since horticultural crops can be affected in these ways, 
it would seem worthwhile to investigate various possibilities 
in connection with growth control of field crops. 

In Alberta, as in other parts of the worId, 
agronomists strive to secure or develop high yielding, high

quality crop plants well adapted to the environment. As 
knowledge of growth regulating substances accumulates and 
the mechanism of action becomes more clearly understood 
it seems probable that plant characteristics such as 
flowering time, flowering abundance, seed setting and 
maturity date as well as plant composition, such as protein 
and carbohydrate content, may be regulated to make plants 
more adaptable to a specific environment and for a specific 
use. 

The writer*s investigations reported in this 
paper were undertaken at the University of Alberta to 
determine the effects on legumes and certain other crops 
of various growth regulating chemicals applied at herbi- 
cidal and non-herbicidal rates. 

LITERATURE REVIEW 


It is well known that plants bend toward the 
light. The history of plant hormones or growth regulators 
commenced in 1880 when Charles Darwin became interested in 
this phenomenon. The advancement in knowledge pertaining 
to these substances is recorded by Boysen Jensen ejb al (5). 
Depending on concentration of chemical used,hormonal treat¬ 
ments of plants can cause a range of reactions extending 
from growth stimulation to inhibition or to death of certain 
organs or of whole plants.

The Treatment of Seed, Seedlings and Growing Plants With 

Growth Substance. 

In 1933 it was shown that hormones govern, to 
some extent, the growth of buds (35) c One practical 
application, which has resulted from these findings, is 
the use of. growth substances to induce dormancy and to 
break dormancy in potatoes* This work is reviewed by 
Avery et al (4). The potassium salts of naphthaleneacetic 
acid (K,N*A,) and the methyl ester of naphthaleneacetic 
acid (MeNA) are capable of preventing formation of sprouts 
on potato tubers in storage while ethylene chlorohydrin 
and several other chemicals are capable of breaking either 
natural or induced dormancy* Smith et al (32) sprayed 
potato plants in the field with Me NA, sodium 2,4-dichloro- 
phenoxyacetate, a-naphthaleneacetic acid, indoleacetic acid 
and 2,4,5 - trichlorophenoxyacetic acid and found that 
sprout growth was significantly reduced in the stored 
tubers* 

Many attempts have been made to influence the 
subsequent growth of plants by applications of growth 
regulators to seeds. There have been both positive and 
negative results, Thimann and Lane (36) treated oat and 
wheat seeds with indoleacetic acid and found that, the 
general vegetative growth of the shoot was accelerated, 
the dry weight of the plant was often increased more than 
50 per cent and a slight hastening of flowering occurred*

On the other hand Stewart and Hamner (34) soaked seeds of 
various vegetable and field crop plants in a number of 
different hormone solutions comprising a wide range of 
concentrations and obtained no significant increase in 
growth in either field or greenhouse trials. Pearse (27) 
records that Amlong and Naundorf obtained increased 
germination and increased plant size in radishes and sugar 
beets while Walrand using the same chemical on sugar beet 
seeds reported negative results. 

Many controversial results have been obtained 
by using growth substances on growing plants. Grace (16) 
reported that the growth of young tomato plants was 
greatly increased if the plants were watered daily with 
nutrient solutions containing growth hormones. An optimum 
concentration was found and the extent of stimulation was 
greatest in young plants. Pearse (27) states that Amlong 
and Naundorf reported acceleration of vegetative growth 
and flowering by foliar applications of indoleacetic acid. 
Hamner (18) on the other hand could find no particular 
benefit from adding small quantities of growth regulators 
to the soil around the growing plants. Pearse (27) con¬ 
cludes by mentioning that Zimmerman in 1947 considered 
there was no established proof that any synthetic growth 
substances stimulate the growth of the whole plant. 

Hastening of the period of flowering is of 
commercial importance with certain plants. Clark and

Kerns (10) found that naphthaleneacetic acid and other 
naphthalene compounds sprayed on the foliage of pineapples 
at low concentrations advanced the flowering time by at 
least two months* Conversely, flowering could be retarded 
by heavier applications* Van Overbeek (37) has been 
successful in fully controlling flowering time in pine¬ 
apple with naphthaleneacetic acid and 2,4-D. Leopold and 
Thimann (21) shortened by 35$ the time to flowering of 
barley treated with naphthaleneacetic acid. Zimmerman and 
Hitchcock (42) working with tomato plants stimulated the 
production of flower clusters on leafy branches by using 
triiodobenzoic acid*. 

In reviewing the uses of plant growth regulators 
Weintraub and Norman (41) state that experiments aimed at 
prolonging the blossoming period of decorative fruit trees 
have given promising results. Gustafson (17) has shown 
that the retention of the flower on tobacco is a hormone 
phenomenon. Application of hormones resulted in retention 
of the flowers, but many of these flowers did not produce 
fruits* 

There are few indications that seed set can be 
Increased by hormone treatments. Ennis et al (12) noticed 
that potato plants sprayed with 2,4-D had set a considerable 
number of seed balls whereas the control plants failed to 
set any fruit. Conceivably, seed set might be Increased 
by use of chemicals to induce flowers to remain on the plant

for a longer time and hence increase the opportunity for 
pollination to take place. In some tests where this method 
has been tried on alfalfa no benefits have been obtained 
(8), Sokoljskaja (33), however, claims to have increased 
seed yield of red clover by 27.8$ with one spraying of 
2,4-D at the beginning of flowering. 

Growth regulators have been used on various 
plants in attempts to alter the chemical composition of 
the plant parts. Erickson ejb al (13) showed conclusively 
that the protein content of wheat increased in direct 
relation to the amount of 2,4-D applied in heavy herbicidal 
rates. Other workers, however, have shown that such protein 
increases are accompanied by a decrease in yield of grain 
apparently comparable to that which occurs under drought 
conditions. Warden and Bullette (38) sprayed wheat with 
2,4-D ester and obtained a highly significant increase in 
protein content of grain. There was a positive correlation 
between concentration of 2,4-D and protein content and a 
negative correlation between protein content and yield. 

High protein content was associated with severe stunting of 
the wheat plants. Priesen (14) used similar treatments 
in 1947 and reports that milling and baking qualities of 
the wheat were not affected. Pearse (27) reviewing the 
work of Amlong and Naundorf, noted that the sugar content 
of sugar beets was increased 123 per cent by soaking the 
seeds in a solution of indoleacetic acid before planting.

The Response of Plants to Growth Substances Used as Herbicides, 


Marth and Mitchell (22) in describing the action 

of 2,4-D applied in lethal concentrations to susceptible 

growing plants, pointed out that the growth substance does 

not cause rapid superficial burning like other toxic weed 
do 

killers A but that it brings about morphological and physio¬ 
logical responses at the point of application or in parts 
of the plant at some distance from the actual point of 
contact by active translocation within the tissues# Growth 
responses are characterized by distorted stem and leaf 
growth, inhibition of bud growth, especially the terminal 
buds, and sometimes by the production of galls on the thick¬ 
ened roots and main stems. Later the cells and tissues of 
the plant disintegrate and the plant dies# Weaver and De 
Rose (39) found that great stunting of bean plants occurred 
when 2,4-D was applied to the youngest parts of the plants. 
The growth substance readily passed downward through the 
plant and the velocity of movement was apparently greatly 
influenced by the photosynthetic activity and the age of 
tissue. Mitchell and Brown (26) concluded that when 2,4-D 
was applied to the leaves of bean plants the translocation

of this chemical was closely associated with that of organic 
food materials and therefore confined to the living cells 
or parenchyma*. When applied to the roots the stimulus was 
translocated through dead portions of the stem indicating 
that upward translocation was probably in the transpiration 
stream. 

Selective weeding of one species from another 
with plant growth regulators, as herbicides, is possible 
because different species show varying degrees of suscepti¬ 
bility to the same application. Pearse (27) compiled a list 
of 193 weed plants arranging them according to their sensi¬ 
tivity to 2,4-D. There were three divisions namely: Species 
readily killed; Species relatively resistant although growth 
retarded; and Very resistant species. The corresponding 
classification of weeds in western Canada include Susceptible, 
Intermediate and Resistant categories. (28). Akamine (1) 
in reviewing selectivity of growth regulators concluded that 
2,4-D has relatively little effect on most of the grasses 
if treated at or before jointing or after heading. Legumes 
are generally considered to be very susceptible to herbicides 
but there are variations according to species and chemical 
as shown by Miller (24), Kratochvil et al (19), Carder (7) 
Buchholtz (6), Churchill and Grigsby (9) and Shaw and Willard 
(31). The margin of safety between dosages of 2,4-D that 
injure most broad leaf crop plants and the dosages which 
effectively control weeds is usually narrow. Weed control 
is often confined to a certain stage of growth.

The presence of selectivity within a species has 
been shown. Albrecht (2) found that the tolerance of bent- 
grass to 2,4-D varied considerably among strains. In 27 
strains these variations extended from no injury to some 
strains, to almost complete destruction of others. 

Derivatives of the same chemical compound show 
varied effects on certain species. Ennis et al (12) showed 
that 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid had an extremely 
injurious effect on the Irish potato but such agents as 
2,4-D and 2-methyl-4-chlorophenoxyacetic acid when applied 
at the same rate in aqueous sprays produced little inhibi¬ 
tion of either vegetative growth or tuber yield. 

The age of plant has an important bearing on the 
susceptibility of the plant to herbicides. Robinson (29), 
summarizing trials with flax, generalized that flax is 
susceptible in the cotyledon stage, moderately resistant 
from the early rosette stage or first leaf stage to about 
two weeks before full bloom, very susceptible in bud and 
bloom stages and resistant after boll formation* These 
data indicate that developing floral and ovarial structures 
are as severely affected by the herbicide as young vegetative 
plant parts are. Klingman (20) working with oats and barley 
also expressed this view. 

Most manufacturers of 2,4-D and other hormone 
herbicides recommend the use of these substances on clear 
warm days for best results. Marth and Davis (23) found that

plants are killed more readily by 2,4-D under temperature 
conditions favorable for growth. 

Rainfall occurring shortly after a spray applica¬ 
tion of 2,4-D will result in a decreased plant response if 
the growth regulator is applied in aqueous spray. This was 
shown to be true by Weaver et al (40). If the growth sub¬ 
stance was applied in oil solution there was no diminution 
in the response to the herbicide. In another investigation 
Weaver and De Rose (39) determined that the leaves of young 
soybean plants absorbed maximum amounts of growth regulator 
within six hours from the time of application. 

Pre-emergence soil treatment is another method of 
plant growth control. Akamine (1) concluded from his review 
of the literature that since the emergence of most plants 
has been shown to be adversely affected or entirely prevented 
when selective growth regulators are applied to the soil the 
difference in the degree of susceptibility of the species 
is minimized. Mitchell and Brown (25) agreed with Allard 
et al (3) nevertheless that broadleaved species generally 
seemed to be more sensitive to 2,4-D and 2-methy1-4-chloro- 
phenoxyacetic acid than are grass species when planted in 
soil treated with these compounds. 

The foregoing review, though not an exhaustive 
account of research on plant growth regulators, has been 
selected to represent and provide access to the literature 
having a bearing on the projects discussed in the ensuing

PART I, 

PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATIONS WITH ANNUAL CROPS 


Introduction 


The foregoing literature review has indicated 
that various effects on plants have been obtained by the 
use of growth regulators at various concentrations, applied 
in various ways and at different stages of plant growth. 
Apparently effects extend from growth inhibition to stimu¬ 
lation depending on such factors as chemical concentration 
and time of application. 

This project was planned to investigate effects 
of various chemicals on perennial legume crops under field 
conditions. While suitable plots of alfalfa, sweet clover 
and red clover were being established during the first year 
preliminary investigations were carried out on annual crops 
so that techniques could be developed and resulting effects 
on growth and yield observed. In this way it was hoped to 
learn which of a large number of available chemicals might 
have most promise for the ensuing investigations. 

Certain effects which have been reported as a 
result of soaking seeds and potato tubers before planting 
have been indecisive. In view of this fact the studies 
reported in Section I were undertaken to investigate further

of chemicals 1-7 inclusive, and in concentrations of 
chemicals 8 - 12 inclusive as noted above*. Eyepieces 
for check plots were soaked in water. Triplicate rando¬ 
mized field plots, in factorial design, were planted in 
mid-May, In the design each block was assigned to a 
particular chemical and included treatments at 5 concentra¬ 
tions as well as a check, with each treatment represented 
by a row containing 8 eyepieces. Block number 8 was 
assigned the name "Group" * It contained chemical treat¬ 
ments 8-12 above and a check row* Rows were 12 feet 
long and spaced 3 feet apart. Rows were planted along 
the margins of the plots to eliminate border effect* At 
planting time the soil was very dry* 

Emergence counts were recorded June 7th, 11th, 

18th, 24th and July 4th and 16th, The tubers were dug by 
hand in mid-September, Those from each row were bagged 
separately and placed in storage preparatory to counting 
and weighing. The resulting data were analyzed statistically* 

Test 3 (Potatoes), 1950* 

Tubers of uniform size from each row in Test 2 
were retained in storage. In the spring.eyepieces from 
these were planted in the same design as Test 2 with the 
exclusion of the D.D.T. and "Group" blocks. Emergence was 
recorded in the first 2 weeks of June and tubers were dug 
in mid-September. Yields were so constant in all rows

that only the material from rows of the 200 p.p.m. treat¬ 
ments and from corresponding checks were bagged separately 
prior to storage, weighing of the tubers, and statistical 
analysis of the data. 

Test 4 (Potatoes), 1951. 

In reviewing the results of Test 2 it was noted 
that T.C.B. had in all replicates caused plants to emerge 
a few days earlier than the check. Although the difference 
was not quite statistically significant, further investiga¬ 
tion was considered advisable. Twenty-five potatoes of 
uniform size were selected from check material of Test 3. 

Three eyepieces were cut from the central•region of each 
potato to eliminate variations due to bud dominance, insofar 
as possible. The 3 eyepieces from each potato were identified 
and soaked for 6 hours in 20 p.p.m*, 40 p.p.m. of T.C.B. 
and water respectively. They were then planted at a 
uniform depth in the same pot and identified by stakes. 

The 25 pots were placed on the greenhouse bench and 
watered as required. Emergence was recorded at regular 
intervals until one month after planting. No stimulation 
was evident with the concentrations used.

Experimental Results 


Test 1 (Soaked Seeds). 

Very dry weather after planting, in combination 
with the dry condition of the soil at time of planting, 
prevented conclusive observations regarding time and per¬ 
centage of emergence of seedlings. Counts were made twice 
but the behavior of the checks was so erratic that further 
observations were considered inadvisable. In general 
however, the highest rate of chemical application (50 p.p.m.) 
retarded emergence. The winter wheat remained vegetative 
throughout the summer. 

Test 2 (Potatoes) 1949. 

The potatoes were not affected by drought to the 
same extent as were the seeds in Test 1. The variance 
analysis of the row emergence data appears in Table 1. The 
P. value 18.57 indicates that the differences between the 
treatment means were highly significant. The means of the 
200 p.p.m. treatments for 2,4-B and A.O.C.P. were just 
significantly lower than the means of their checks while 
the means of the 200 p.p.m. treatments for 2,4,5-T, N.A.A., 
P.C.P. and Comp, were considerably lower than the means 
of their controls. This is shown In Column 5, Table 2. 

These data indicate that soaking of Netted Gem potato eye¬ 
pieces for 6 hours, in aqueous solution of 200 p.p.m. of

2,4,5-T, N.A.A., P.C.P., 2,4-D, A.O.C.P. and Comp, before 
planting, significantly delayed emergence. 

Column 6, Table 2 summarizes the visible effects 
of the various chemicals and concentrations on top size of 
mature plants. Of the above mentioned chemicals and con¬ 
centrations those tried but not listed did not visibly 
affect top growth. During the early part of the season 
200 p.p.xn. of 2,4-D and P.C.P. produced marked abnormalities 
in the leaves and stems. Some of the 200 p.p.m. treatments 
had a lethal effect on the eyepieces. This is shown in 
Column 3, Table 2. 

The variance analysis of the data for tuber yield 
per row appears in Table 3. The P value 8.71 indicates a 
highly significant difference between tuber yields due to 
the effects of the different chemical treatments. Table 4 
compares the chemical concentrations which significantly 
decreased tuber yield and delayed emergence. Column 4, 

Table 2, gives the mean yield per plant for treatments which, 
either affected top growth or which significantly reduced 
tuber yield. 

Test 3 (Potatoes) 1950. 

Potato emergence in 1950 was normal and no effects 
on top growth were noted throughout the season. This would 
indicate that the effects of the chemical treatments were 
not, carried over in the progeny of the treated material. 

As a further check on this observation it was decided to

Discussion 


It is highly probable that, if moisture conditions 
had been normal in the spring of 1949, results very different 
from those of Tests 1 and 2 would have been obtained. More 
pronounced effects were expected in the potato eyepiece test 
but since the mean time to emergence of the checks was 33 days 
it is possible that the effect of the chemicals diminished with 
the elapsing of such a period of time in the soil. 

Considering the results obtained, it is evident 
that the various chemicals at rates of 200 p.p.m. had varied 
effects on the eyepieces and also on the subsequent growth of

the plants* N.A.A. at 200 p.p.m. was drastic in its 
action on the eyepieces as it killed 66 per cent of them* 

The lethal effect of N.A.A. on bud growth of trees has 
been shown by other workers (4)* From results obtained it 

is evident that the 200 p.p.m* treatments retarded the 

/ 

growth of sprouts from the eyepieces in the following 
order of decreasing effects: N.A.A. and 2,4,5-T equal, 
P.O.P., Comp., 2,4-D and A.O.C.P. 

Although N.A.A. at 200 p.p.m. was lethal to 
some eyepieces it did not have an appreciable residual effect 
upon the growth of those which survived since their yield 
was almost equivalent to the checks. The tops, however, 
were smaller than those of the checks. P.C.P. was outstand¬ 
ing in its effects on both top and tuber yield. The 200 
p.p.m. P.C.P. treatment reduced top size by 50 per cent or 
more and reduced yield 72 per cent. There evidently was an 
extreme residual effect attributable to only a small amount 
of this particular chemical in the plant. Top growth was 
retarded equally by 2,4,5-T and 2,4-D at 200 p.p.m. and 
yield was also reduced approximately 30 per cent. 2,4,5-T 
however delayed emergence considerably more than did 2,4-D. 

Since none of the treatments increased tuber yield, 
they appear to have no value from a practical standpoint 
apart from their possible use to prevent sprouting of non 
dormant potatoes in storage. N.A.A., P.C.P., 2,4,5-T and 
2,4-D would appear to be most promising in this regard.

N.A.A., 2,4,5-T and 2,4-D have already been used success¬ 
fully by other workers (32) for this purpose. It would 
seem inadvisable to use tubers previously treated in this 
way as seed potatoes since sprout growth would likely be 
inhibited, as with N.A.A., or tuber yield reduced, as with 
P.C.P. Counter treatments with other chemicals might be 
used to break the imposed dormancy. Ethylene chlorohydrin 
has been employed successfully in this regard (4). 

Apparently 2,4,5-T was the most toxic of all the chemicals 
used on Netted Gem potatoes as it reduced yield significantly 
following applications as low as 10 p.p.m. These results 
agree with those of Ennis et al (12) who worked with Irish 
potatoes. 

In the second year, eyepieces which were cut from 
the progeny of the previous test emerged and grew normally. 
Although the yields of the 200 p.p.m. rows in most cases 
were slightly below those of the checks statistical analysis 
proved these differences to be insignificant. Prom these 
results it is apparent that carryover of chemical, within 
the tubers from soaked eyepieces,would not be sufficient to 
affect yields in the second year. Whether or not this would 
be true following vine spraying remains to be determined. 

Although 20 p.p.m. of trichlorobenzene appeared 
to stimulate slightly the sprouting of potato eyepieces 
under field conditions it definitely inhibited sprouting

under greenhouse conditions* One month from the time of 
planting, emergence of the treated and untreated material 
was at a maximum* Following the 20 and 40 p*p*m* treatments 
28 and 60 per cent of the eyepieces from respective treat¬ 
ments failed to emerge as compared with a failure of growth 
of 4 per cent of the check material. From these results it 
is apparent that T.C.B., which is normally used as an 
insecticide, may have some possibilities as a plant growth 
inhibitor. 


Summary 


1. Significant delays in emergence and subsequent decrease 
in tuber yield of Netted Gem potatoes were caused by 
soaking eyepieces for 6 hours in 200 p.p.m* solutions 
of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, 2,4,5-trichlorophen- 
oxyacetic acid, naphthaleneacetic acid and parachloro- 
phenoxyproprionic acid immediately before planting. 
Other concentrations namely 5, 10, 20 and 50 p.p.m. of 
these chemicals had no significant effect on emergence 
or on yield except for 2,4,5-T. Applications as low 
as 10 p.p.m. of 2,4,5-T significantly reduced yield 


of tubers

2. Sixty six per cent of the eyepieces soaked in a 200 p.p.m. 
solution of N.A.A. failed to emerge 0 The tuber yield 

per surviving plant was not decreased however. 

3. Tuber yield of plants from eyepieces soaked in 200 
p.p.m. of P.C.P. was reduced by 72 per cent. 

4. Eyepieces from the progeny of the soaked eyepieces 
emerged normally and their tuber yields did not vary 
significantly from check yields. However there was a 
marked trend towards a yield reduction from eyepieces 
from treated material. 

5. In these tests 2,4,5~T showed the greatest toxicity 
to Netted Gem potatoes. 

6. A practical use for some of the chemicals has been 
discussed. 

7. At certain rates trichlorobenzene, an insecticide, 
had a definite inhibiting effect upon sprouting of 
potato eyepieces in soil under greenhouse conditions.

Section II, Chemical Spray Treatments of Growing Plants 

Materials and Methods 


Test 1 (Spring wheat). 

Red Bobs spring wheat was seeded at the rate of 

1 1/2 bushels per acre in the middle of May, 1949. After 

emergence, randomized plots were arranged in factorial 

design with 3 replicates. Each block contained 6 plots, 

each 5 rows wide and 18.5 feet long. The chemicals and 

Test 2 

concentrations used v/ere the same as infection I. Solutions 
were applied from hand sprayers at the rate of 100 cc. per 
37 square feet or approximately 26 gallons per acre. Sprayer 
hoods and v/ind screens were used to eliminate drift. Spray¬ 
ing was commenced early in June and continued at weekly 
intervals until the sixth and final treatment was applied 
when the wheat was headed out. The plots were harvested 
in early September and the threshed samples were weighed and 
retained for protein analysis by the Kjelaahl method using 
mercuric oxide as the catalyst. The yield data were analyzed 
statistically. 

Test 2 (Flax). 

In this test with flax, chemicals and methods were 
the same as in Test 1. Flax was sown at 1/4 bushel per acre. 
The first spraying was on June 15th during the 4 leaf stage

and the sixth was applied during the bud stage* These plots 
were not harvested owing to irregular germination and uneven 
growth resulting from drought conditions* 

Test 5 (Flax)* 

Plots of flax were sprayed with 2,4-D, 2,4,5-T, 
D.D.T., P.C.P., N.A.A., and Comp* at rates of 500, 1000, and 
2000 p.p.m* during the bud stage. Solutions were applied 
with hand sprayers at approximately 26 gallons per acre* 

The results were recorded July 16th. 

Test 4 (Winter wheat)* 

Kharkov winter wheat was seeded in the middle of 
May 1949* Chemicals and methods used were the same as in 
Test 1* 

Test 5 (Winter wheat). 

Duplicated plots of Kharkov winter wheat which 
had remained vegetative throughout the season were sprayed 
on August 15th, with solutions of 2,4-D amine, 2,4,5-T ester 
and a mixture of both. Application was at the rate of 50 
gallons per acre with rates of 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 pounds of 
acid equivalent per acre.

Experimental Results 


Test 1 (Spring wheat). 

Careful observation of the spring wheat revealed 
no visible effects of spray treatments on growth, heading 
or ripening* Table 7 shows the variance analysis of the 
yield data. Apparently Red Bobs spring wheat was not 
significantly increased or decreased in yield by the chemical 
applications* Protein data for the various treatments varied 
so slightly from those of the checks that statistical 
analysis was considered not to be worthwhile. 

Test 2 (Flax)* 

In this test flax germination was so uneven that, 
at the time of the first spray application, some seedlings 
were in the 4 leaf stage while others had just emerged. At 
the time of the fourth application it was noted that the 
200 p.p.m. 2,4,5-T rate had caused chlorosis and stunting* 
Three successive applications of 200 p.p.m. thus had a 
serious effect upon flax plants in the stage of active 
growth. A similar but less pronounced effect was observed 
in the plots treated with 50 p.p.m. of 2,4,5-T. By early 
September no plants remained alive in the 2,4,5-T 200 p.p.m. 
plots while those in the 50 p.p.m. plots were alive but

observed. Growth was so irregular that plots were not 
harvested. 

Test 5 (Flax). 

As noted above, flax plots were treated at bud 
stage in mid-July with herbicidal rates of various chemicals 
in order to determine their relative toxicity to this crop. 

A summary of the effects of the treatments appear in Table 8. 
Under the conditions of the test,flax showed responses to 
the applied growth regulators in the following order of

decreasing susceptibility: 2,4,5-T, 2,4-D, Comp., P.C.P., 
and N.A.A. At 2000 p.p.m. 2,4,5-T was lethal while N.A.A. 
had no visible effects on the flax plants. 

Test 4 (Winter Wheat). 

The spring planted Kharkov winter wheat grew 
very well. After 6 weekly sprays no visible effects were 
observed. By the middle of August the vigorous vegetative 
growth was about 2 feet tall. 

Test 5 (Winter wheat). 

Ten days after the herbicidal rates of the 
chemicals were applied to Kharkov winter wheat there was 
evidence of burning caused by all rates except 2,4-D at 1 
and 2 pounds per acre. Burning became progressively worse 
with increase in concentration of chemicals. Three pounds 
per acre of 2,4,5-T caused damage equivalent to that from 
5 pounds of 2,4-D. Because all the wheat winter killed it 
was not possible to observe later effects of these treatments 
such as may have occurred the following spring. 

Discussion 


The results obtained from the chemical spray treat¬ 
ments of spring and winter wheat were of no practical value. 
Winter wheat remained vegetative and spring wheat was not

affected either in growth, yield or protein content• The 
treatments applied were considerably below the herbicidal 
rates known to affect yield and protein content (13)• 

The spray treatments gave an indication of the 
extent of damage produced on flax by the various chemicals, 
applied during the bud stage of this crop*. As shown earlier, 
certain chemicals did not affect the flax plants while others 
killed the complete stand* 

Summary 


1* The yield and protein content of Red Bobs spring wheat 
was not significantly affected by any of the chemical 
treatments outlined in Section I* 

2. Spring planted Kharkov winter wheat remained vegetative 
after the various chemical treatments* 

3* Flax plants at the bud stage responded to aqueous 

chemical sprays in the following order of increasing 
susceptibility: Naphthaleneacetic acid, parachloro- 
phenoxyproprionic acid, composite mixture, 2,4«dichloro« 
phenoxyacetic acid and 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetie acid* 
At the 2000 p*p*m* rate 2,4,5-T was lethal while N.A.A. 
caused no visible response*

LEGUME CROP INVESTIGATIONS 

Introduction 

Since it has been shown that growth regulators 
possess both growth inhibitory and growth stimulatory 
powers, investigation of the extent and importance of 
such responses in legume crops seemed desirable. 

In the experiments dealt with in Section I an 
effort was made to investigate the possibility of selecti¬ 
vely weeding sweet clover from alfalfa at three stages 
of growth and also to determine possibilities of using 
synthetic hormone herbicides for weed control purposes 
within these crops. 

Section II was undertaken to explore possible 
favorable or unfavorable effects of phenoxy compounds in 
the soil on germination and growth of legume seedlings. 

The objectives of the work reported in Section 
III were to determine if hormone sprays applied at 
relatively low rates at Intervals throughout the flov/erlng 
season would significantly affect seed set of alfalfa 
and red clover.

were sprayed with 2,4~D amine and 2,4,5-T ester at rates 
of 2, 4, 8 and 16 ounces acid equivalent in 45 gallons of 
water per acre. Plot area was approximately 1/2000 acre. 
Observations were recorded in June, July and August. 

Test 2 (Alfalfa). 

During the early flowering stage randomized and 
replicated plots, in a one year old stand of alfalfa, were 
sprayed with chemicals 1, 2 and 3 above at rates of 1/2, 1, 

2, 4, 8 and 16 ounces per acre. Plot size and gallonage 
Was the same as in Test 1. Observations were recorded at 
intervals throughout the summer. 

Test 5 (Alfalfa). 

The remnants of the alfalfa field, which were not 
under test, were mown July 31st. When the second growth was 
6 to 8 inches tall on August 10th, randomized and replicated 
plots were sprayed with eleven rates of chemicals 1, 2 and 
3 above ranging from 1 ounce to 4 pounds per acre. Plot 
size and gallonage was the same as in Test 1. Effects of 
the treatments were recorded on September 2nd and October 5th. 

Test 4 (Sweet Clover). 

Sweet clover 4 inches tall was treated in the same 


way as the plots in Test 1. Observations were recorded in 
June, July and August.

Test 5 (Sweet clover). 

Sweet clover at the early flowering stage was 
given the same treatments as the plots in Test 2, and 
observations were recorded at the same times* 

Test 6 (Sweet clover)* 

Regrowth of sweet clover in the 6-8 inch stage 
was treated with the same chemicals and concentrations in 
the same way as Test 3* Observations were recorded 
September 2nd and October 5th* 

Experimental Results 


Test 1 (Alfalfa), 

As a result of the spray treatments on alfalfa 
at the early growth stage, only 2,4-D amine at 2 ounces 
per acre was without visible effect* All higher rates of 
amine and all rates of 2,4,5-T ester caused root brittleness, 
leaf chlorosis, stem twisting and stunting of the plant* 
Vigorous regrowth occurred from the crowns and from the nodes 
of the prostrate stems in all plots treated with 4 ounces 
per acre or more. The 1 pound per acre rate of 2,4-D caused 
death to 15 per cent of the plants while 2,4,5-T at 1 pound 
per acre killed 30 per cent of the plants. Flowering was 
delayed from 2 to 3 weeks by rates of 2,4-D higher than

2 ounces and by all rates of 2,4,5-T, One pound of 2,4,5-T 
per acre delayed flowering about 6 weeks, Toward the end 
of the season the regrowth in the plots treated with 1 pound 
of amine or ester per acre was as dense as the check plots 
and much taller despite the earlier death of some of the 
plants in these plots. 

Test 2 (Alfalfa), 

Treatments with the esters of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T 
at rates of 1 ounce acid equivalent or less, and with the 
amine at 2 ounces or less per acre, applied to alfalfa during 
the early flowering stage, had no lasting effect on the 
appearance of the plants. The 2 ounce rate of the esters 
and 4 ounce rate of the amine checked the growth of stems. 
This retardation led to regrowth from the nodes and crowns. 
The terminal buds were all killed. Flowering was thus 
delayed about 1 month. All rates above 2 ounces of ester 
and above 4 ounces of amine caused leaf chlorosis and in¬ 
hibition of stem growth to such an extent that regrowth was 
almost entirely from the crowns and not from the lateral 
buds on the stems. Seed pods were not present in these 
plots at harvesting time. All topgrowth and some roots of 
plants treated with 1 pound of the ester per acre died 
within 1 month after the spray application. By the end of 
the second month regrowth commenced from about 30 per cent 
of the plants.

Test 5 (Alfalfa). 

All rates except 1 ounce of amine caused visible 
distortion of alfalfa regrowth, the severity increasing 
with the rate. Observations recorded 5 weeks after treat¬ 
ment showed that growth was retarded by 2 ounces or less of 
amine and by 1 ounce of the esters per acre. Rates greater 
than these caused growth inhibition, chlorosis and stem and 
leaf necrosis. Increase in severity was proportional to 
increase in rates. Although 1 pound per acre or higher 
rates of chemical appeared to have killed 80 to 100 per cent 
of the alfalfa roots a final assessment cannot be made until 
the next growing season arrives. 

Test 4 (Sweet Glover). 

As regards the spray treatments of sweet clover at 
the early growth stage, 2 ounces of amine per acre caused 
slight stem distortion while all higher rates of amine and 
all ester rates prostrated the stems. Within two weeks after 
treatment, anthocyanin pigmentation became more evident in 
all treated stems and depth of color paralleled treatment 
rates. Lesions on roots and stems appeared following all 
treatments of 8 ounces or more of amine and 4 ounces or 
more of esters. Regrowth from the crowns and also from the 
lateral buds on the stems was vigorous in plots treated with 
1 pound or less of amine per acre and 8 ounces or less of

the esters per acre. Regrowth from terminal buds occurred 
only In plots treated with less than 4 ounces of amine per 
acre and with less than 2 ounces of the esters per acre. 

Thus of the treatments used here, it is assumed that terminal 
buds were killed by rates higher than 2 ounces of amine and 
1 ounce of the esters per acre, and that lateral buds were 
killed by rates higher than 8 ounces of the esters per acre. 
Eighty per cent of the plants in the plots treated with 1 
pound of the esters per acre were killed, the remainder 
produced some new growth in late August. Flowering was 
delayed 2 to 3 weeks by 2 and 4 ounces of the esters and by 
4 ounces of amine per acre, 4 weeks by 1 pound of amine and 
8 ounces of the esters per acre, and 8 weeks by 1 pound of 
the esters per acre. Almost without exception the results 
of this test show that 2,4-D or 2,4,5-T esters had a comp¬ 
arable effect on sweet clover. Rate for rate these esters 
were much more toxic to legume vegetation than was 2,4-D 
amine. In general twice as much 2,4-D amine as ester was 
required to produce a comparable effect on sweet clover. 

In the following discussion it can therefore be assumed that 
amine at double the ester rate produced a similar effect on 
the plants. 

Test 5 (Sweet clover). 

Treatments of sweet clover with 1 ounce or less 
of ester per acre applied during the early flowering stage

had no visible lasting effect on the plants. The rates of 

and 

2 ounces or greater checked growth^caused severe twisting 
of stems but regrowth was vigorous from crowns and from 
terminal and lateral buds of plants treated with 4 ounces 
or less. Plants treated with 8 ounces of ester per acre 
sent forth regrowth from the crown and lower nodes of the 
stem, hence it is assumed that this concentration killed 
the terminal and upper lateral buds. The 1 pound rate killed 
60 per cent of the plants but regrowth from the crown and 
lower nodes of the remainder of the plants appeared at the 
end of July. Anthocyanin pigmentation was more noticeable 
in the plants treated with 8 ounces and 1 pound per acre. 
Flower abundance decreased as concentration of chemical 
increased from 1 ounce up to 1 pound* The latter rate killed 
all inflorescenses on the plants* 

Test 6 (Sweet clover). 

All treatments except 1 ounce of amine per acre 
applied when sweet clover regrowth was 6 to 8 inches tall 
caused visible distortion of the plants. Observations 
recorded during the first week in October, 5 weeks after the 
treatment, showed that growth was retarded by 2 ounces or 
more of ester per acre. The 4 ounce rate prostrated the

before winter but this should not be taken as final 
indication that all the plants were killed. Observations 
should be made in the spring and a further test might be 
advisable to study the effects of chemical on regrowth 
from a stand mowed earlier in the season than August 1st. 

Discussion 


The results from herbicidal treatments of alfalfa 
and sweet clover indicated that these plants were very 
susceptible to phenoxy compounds insofar as damage to top 
growth was concerned. Rates ordinarily used for weed con- 
trol purposes damaged these plants at any stage of growth 
to such an extent that regrowth occurred only from the 
crown and lower nodes of the stem. Despite the fact that 
top growth was susceptible there was no evidence that the 
roots were easily killed. Applications of 1 pound per acre 
of 2,4,5-T ester killed about 30 per cent of the alfalfa 
plants and 80 per cent of the sweet clover plants in the 
early growth stage. Similarly 80 per cent of both alfalfa 
and sweet clover was killed by the same application at 
flowering time. Applications of l/2 pound per acre of 2,4-D 
and 2,4,5-T esters and of 1 pound per acre of 2,4-D amine, 
applied to 6 to 8 inch regrowth after mowing, appeared to 
kill all the plants, but owing to the lateness of the season

confirmation remained for future observation* 

In all tests 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T esters caused 
comparable effects while 2,4-D amine was about one half 
as toxic at the same rate. Sweet clover was slightly more 
susceptible to damage than was alfalfa at the early growth 
stage, but at other stages appeared equally sensitive. 

These findings indicate that selective weeding of sweet 
clover from alfalfa stands by the use of these chemicals 
is not feasible. 

The results suggest, however, that chemical 
control of weeds in alfalfa and sweet clover during the 
early growth stage might be possible. Under the conditions 
of the test in 1950, applications of 1 pound of 2,4-D amine 
or 8 ounces of the esters retarded the growth of all plants 
and killed some of them, but by the end of August the 
potential forage yield in the plots appeared to be even 
greater than that of the checks. The fact that forage 
yield appeared to increase even after a percentage of the 
plants were killed suggests the possibility of using these 
chemicals as sprays to thin out alfalfa stands to improve 
later seed production. 

Legume seed growers find second year stands of 
alfalfa are often too weedy to cut for seed, and hence 
mow the fields for hay. Because of the weed content the 
quality of the hay is often impaired. The results obtained 
in the above experiments suggest that weedy fields could be 
sprayed with 8 ounces of 2,4-D amine or 4 ounces of 2,4,5-T

ester at the early growth stage * This application would 
seriously distort the alfalfa plants and probably delay 
flowering approximately 3 weeks, but if the weed growth 
was controlled the second growth would likely be more 
vigorous than the first, and therefore the quantity and 
quality of the hay would be improved* Moreover in view of 
the fact that there were seed pods on the plants in the 
experimental plots treated in this way there might, in a 
long season, be a possibility of harvesting a crop of seed* 
It would be necessary to investigate this method under 
field conditions before practical recommendations could be 
made* 

Unpublished investigations at the University of 
Alberta have indicated that certain contact herbicides can 
be used successfully to remove annual weeds from alfalfa 
stands without damage to the crop* Such treatments would 
probably be more desirable to the seed grower but additional 
testing involving comparison of both types of herbicides 
would seem to be worthwhile* 

Summary 


1* The difference in the susceptibility of alfalfa and 
sweet clover to 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid or to 
2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid was insufficient 
to permit selective weeding of sweet clover from alfalfa.

2. In all tests the esters of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T caused 
comparable root injury, stem and leaf distortion and 
damage to reproductive organs, but it was necessary 
to apply the amine formulation of 2,4-D at twice the 
rate of ester application to produce an equal toxic 
effect. 

3. Alfalfa and sweet clover tops were very susceptible 
to the phenoxyacetic acid derivatives, but the roots 
could be considered quite resistant since concentrations 
greater than 1 pound of ester per acre were required 

to kill them. 

4. Possible practical applications of the results of 
these tests have been discussed.

Section II. Effects of Chemical Soil Treatments on Emer¬ 
gence of Legume Seedlings. 


Materials and Methods 


This investigation involved the planting of 264 
flats of soil with approximately 100,000 legume seeds. The 
tests were begun on a small scale in the greenhouse early 
in 1950 to determine the concentration of 2,4-D required 
in the soil solution to prevent emergence of seeds of alfalfa, 
sweet clover, alsike and red clover, and to determine possible 
variations in species susceptibility to the chemical. 

As the test progressed indications of a stimulative 
effect of certain concentrations of 2,4-D became evident. 

The test was then moved outdoors where the number of repli¬ 
cates could be increased to improve accuracy and where 
environmental conditions would be more natural than in the 
greenhouse. Subsequently esters of 2,4,5-T and 2,4-D were 
included in the experiment to compare their effects with 
those of 2,4-D amine at the same concentrations. 

Eight successive tests were carried out. The 
general procedure was the same for all experiments except 
that varying concentrations were used from time to time as 


shown below:

Plats (22.5 x 14.5 inches) of 3 to 1 soil sand 
mixture were each planted with 100 seeds of each species viz: 
alfalfa, alsike clover, sweet clover and red clover. Each flat 
contained 8 randomized rows of 50 seeds per row. Immediately 
after planting, 3 litres of water was applied to each check 
flat by means of a spray type watering can and the flats for 
hormone treatment watered with equal amounts of chemical 
solution. This moistening was usually sufficient to permit 
germination and emergence to take place before additional 
watering was required. As soon as the seedlings in the check 
flats reached the 3 leaf stage emergence was recorded and

emergence of treated and untreated material. 

Experimental Results 


Tests 1-8 (alfalfa, alsike clover, red clover 
and sweet clover). 

Test 1. 

Within 9 days no seedlings emerged in the flats 
treated under greenhouse conditions with 50 and 1000 p.p.m. 
of 2,4-D amine. Emergence in the check flats was at a 
maximum at that time. One month from the time of treatment 
seedlings had not emerged in the treated flats. 

Test 2. 

The emergence was reduced by treatments of both 
10 p.p.m. and 0.5 p.p.m. of 2,4-D amine under greenhouse 
conditions as shown in Figure 1. This test also supplied 
data on the relative susceptibility of the different species 
to 2,4-D under the conditions of soil treatment. Table 9 
illustrates these observations. From these data it is 
evident that when 10 p.p.m. was used the increasing order 
of species susceptibility was: Red clover, alsike and alfalfa 
approximately equal while sweet clover was most susceptible.

p.p.m. 2,4,5—T(Ester) 






























49 


2,4-D ester and 2,4,5-T ester were used. Concentrations 
of 0.005 p.p.m. of 2,4-D increased emergence of all species 
more than did 0.001 p.p.m* On the other hand, 0.0005 p.p.m. 
of 2,4-D had no effect on alsike and sweet clover but increased 
the emergence of alfalfa and decreased the emergence of red 
clover. Application of 0.005 p.p.m. 2,4,5-T ester increased 
emergence of alfalfa and sweet clover but decreased emergence 
of red clover and alsike while an application of 0.0005 p.p.m. 
2,4,5-T decreased emergence of all species. A concentration 
of 0.0005 p.p.m. of 2,4-D ester increased emergence of alfalfa, 
red clover and alsike but decreased emergence of sweet clover. 

A concentration of 0.005 p.p.m. of 2,4-D ester slightly 
increased emergence in red clover and alsike, but decreased 
it in alfalfa and sweet clover. These data for 2,4-D ester 
suggest that if a rate of 0.001 p.p.m.had been applied 
the species may have responded in a similar manner as they 
did to 2,4,5-T ester at that concentration. Figure 3 shows 
the increases and decreases in mean emergences above or 
below the check mean resulting from applications of various 
concentrations of 2,4-D ester. Certain concentrations which 
were not included in the tests are necessarily omitted from 
the table, but corresponding spaces are left in the graph 
to avoid confusion when making inter-chemical comparisons

Test 5. 


This test was first carried out in mid-July 
but heavy rains immediately after treatment necessitated 
covering the flats with tarpaulins. The seedlings became 
etiolated and died when they were exposed to the sun. The 
test was then repeated but rain interfered again and the 
cover had to be left over the flats on the day following 
application of solutions. This confinement had a forcing 
effect on the seedlings and they began to emerge the next 
morning. Consequently, it is probable that the results 
obtained from this test are not comparable with those from 
previous tests. The results are included in Figures 1, 2 
and 3. 

Test 6c 

This test was carried out in August using con¬ 
centrations of 0.1 and 0.05 p.p.m. of all 3 chemicals. 

Sweet clover reacted normally in that emergence was not 
increased by either concentration of either growth regulator. 
The other species showed increases and decreases which did 
not seem to conform to the pattern indicated by the previous 
tests. Evidence of this erratic behavior is apparent in 
Figures 2 and 3. It was hoped that tests could be performed 
which would include all the concentrations of one chemical 
at one time thus eliminating the time factor. Owing to

early frosts, however, these tests could not be performed 
outdoors where they should have been done in order to 
justify comparisons with the results of other outdoor tests. 

Test 7. 


Lack of bench space in the greenhouse necessitated 
carrying out this test with only 3 replicates and 6 concentra¬ 
tions (0.0001, 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1 and 10 p.p.m.) of 2,4,5-T 
ester. Substantial increases over emergence of checks were 
found only with alsike treated with 0.001, 0.01, 0.1 p.p.m* 
as shown in Figure 4. 

Since the effects of 10 p.p.m. of 2,4, 5-T in Test 7 
and 10 p.p.m. of 2,4-D amine in Test 2 were both investigated 
under greenhouse conditions it seemed justifiable to compare 
the effects of the 10 p.p.nu treatments on the emergence of 
the various species. Table 10 shows the effects of 10 p.p.m. 
of 2,4,5-T on the emergence of these species, and Table 11 
summarizes the effects of 10 p.p.m. 2,4-D amine and 2,4, 5-T 
ester thus showing the relative susceptibility of the 4 
species to the 2 chemicals under the conditions of the tests. 
It is apparent that sweet clover was most susceptible to 
both chemicals and that alfalfa and alsike clover responded 
similarly to either chemical. Red clover on the other hand 
was most resistant of all species to 2,4-D but moderately 
susceptible to 2,4,5-T.

Test 8, 


This test was planned to investigate the effects 
of concentrations of 2,4,5-T ester between 1 and 10 p.p.m. 
under greenhouse conditions as in Test 7. Figure 4 combines 
the results of Tests 7 and 8 0 


Discus sion 


The first two tests to study the effects of various 
concentrations of 2,4-D amine on the emergence of legume 
seedlings, indicated that concentrations of 0.5 p.p.m. or 
greater applied to the soil at planting time reduced the 
emergence of seedlings under greenhouse conditions. Emergence 
decreased with increasing concentration of chemical and a 
variation in susceptibility according to species was 
indicated. The greenhouse tests carried out the following 
winter with 2,4,5-T ester showed responses generally the 
same as from 2,4-D amine, but when concentrations between 
1 and 10 p.p.m. were tested increases of 2 to 8 per cent in 
emergence were apparent about midway in this range while 
below and above this point emergence was generally reduced. 
These results are not explicable on the basis of the 
earlier observation that susceptibility increased with 
increasing concentration. Variation in the environment 
may have been partly responsible for the differences since

the latter tests were carried out in December and January 
when growing conditions were greatly different from those 
in the previous March and April. It was very difficult to 
maintain suitable temperature in the greenhouse during the 
very cold weather in December and January. Growth was 
slow under the cold conditions, and the response to growth 
regulators likewise is different than when weather conditions 
are favorable for active growth (23). This might also 
partially explain why the lower concentrations (0.0001 to 
1 p.p.m.) failed to stimulate emergence in all species 
except alsike clover. Alsike is naturally adapted to a moist, 
cool environment. 

The results of the remaining tests, performed 
outdoors under more natural conditions, at first seemed to 
conform to a definite pattern. Generally concentrations 
of 0.01 p.p.m. of 2,4-D amine and 2,4,5-T ester depressed 
emergence while concentrations of 0.005 p.p.m. and 0.001 p.p.m. 
caused an increase in percentage emergence. Concentrations 
of 0.0005 p.p.m. were responsible for still less stimulation 
or in some cases a slight decline in percentage emergence. 

The weather throughout these two tests in May and June was 
hot, dry and sunny. Test 5 was carried out in July and 
August, but cannot be compared with the others as the seed¬ 
lings were forced by abnormal conditions prevailing under 
the tarpaulin covers. The results of this test were 
included with the results of the other tests to demonstrate

more effectively the extent to which results are modified 
by environment. During Test 6 in late August and early 
September the nights were cooler, and the days not so hot 
as those during earlier experiments. In this test the 
behavior of the species was very erratic involving increases 
and decreases in emergence for which no explanatory general¬ 
ization appeared possible* 

The results have shown that a variation in 
susceptibility of the various species to the chemicals exists 
and also that environmental effects probably modify chemical 
effects to a large extent. 

The tests also indicate that soil treatments 
intended to stimulate growth or increase emergence of alfalfa, 
sweet clover, alsike clover and red clover would serve no 
useful purpose on a field scale because the observed increases 
in emergence were so small and because there is, as yet, no 
possible way of being sure of stimulation from a particular 
concentration of chemical under varying environmental 
conditions.

definitely decreased emergence of alfalfa, alsike, 
red clover and sweet clover seedlings when applied 
as a pre-emergence soil treatment under greenhouse 
conditions. 

2. The legume species varied in their responses to 
2,4-D and 2,4,5-T. The order of increasing suscepti¬ 
bility to injury from 2,4-D at 10 p.p.m. was: red 
clover, alsike and alfalfa equal, and sweet clover 
most susceptible, whereas the order of susceptibility 
to 2,4,5-T at 10 p.p.m. was alfalfa and alsike equal, 
red clover next and sweet clover most susceptible. 

3. The evidence of damage by applications of 0.5 p.p.m. 

or greater of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T suggests inadvisability 
of post planting, pre-emergence treatments of small 
weeds which happen to emerge before the legume seed¬ 
lings in newly planted fields.

the plots were sprayed at the rate of 50 gals, per acre 
with concentrations of 5, 15 and 50 p.p.m. of 2,4-D amine, 

2,4,5-T ester and a mixture of both* Notes were taken 1 
week after treatment and plots were harvested late in 
September. Yield data on threshed and cleaned seed samples 
were analyzed statistically. 

Test 2 (Alfalfa), 1950* 

Prior to the flowering stage 84 plots were arranged 
in factorial design, with 3 replicates, in a fairly uniform 
1 year old stand of Grimm alfalfa at the University of 
Alberta, Plots were approximately 22.5 square feet in 
area. In each replicate chemicals 1, 2, 3 and 4 were 
applied, 2,4-D amine and A.O.C.P. at l/lS, 1/8, 1/4, 1/2, 1 
and 2 ounces, and 2,4-D ester and 2,4,5-T ester at 1/32, 1/16, 
1/8, 1/4, 1/2 and 1 ounce acid equivalent in 45 gallons of 
water per acre. A check plot was provided for each chemical 
in each replicate. Plots were sprayed five times at approxi¬ 
mately weekly intervals throughout the flowering season. (July 3 
August 1st). Applications were made only on clear warm days. 
Visual affects of treatments were observed at intervals through¬ 
out the season. 

At harvest time a rectangular iron quadrat 4 feet 
4 inches by 5 feet or approximately 1/S000 of an acre was 
used to mark off the sampling area. After cutting, the 
alfalfa was dried in the field for 2 weeks, then threshed.

and weighed. 

A study of the yield data showed that 5 plots on 
one side of the test had extremely high yields in comparison 
to the others. This was attributable to the fact that 
during the season the border on that portion of the test 
was accidentally removed during cultivation of the roadways. 
The yield values for these 5 plots were discarded and new 
ones calculated using the missing plot technique (15). 
Statistical analysis of the data was then carried out. 

Test 3, 1950. 

A duplicate of Test 2 was laid out in a 3 year 
old stand of G-rluim alfalfa on the farm of K. McKenzie at 
Tiger Lily west of Barrhead. Due to a combination of 
circumstances these plots were sprayed only twice, during 
the flowering stage, with a ten day intervening period 
between sprays. The plots were harvested in early September, 
and the samples dried indoors at the University of Alberta. 
The samples were subsequently threshed, cleaned, and weighed, 
and the yield data analyzed statistically. 

Experimental Results 


Test 1 (Red Clover), 1949. 

Three days after the spray treatments of red clover 
twisting of plants was general throughout the treated plots

Using extent of twisting as a criterion 2,4,5-T was most 
effective and 2,4-D amine least injurious. At 50 p.p.m. 

2,4-D amine appeared to have an effect equal to that of 
2,4,5-T at 15 p.p.m. The variance analysis of the yield 
data for test 1 is found in Table 12* It shows that the 
treatments had no significant effect on seed yield. This 
result however, may have been partially attributable to an 
early frost in the fall of 1949 which caused damage to 
immature red clover seeds. A duplicate experiment was 
planned for 1950 but much of the red clover winter killed and 
no fields suitable for experimental purposes were located.

Tests 2 and 5 (Alfalfa), 1950. 

Alfalfa plots at the University of Alberta were 
compared at the time of the fourth treatment. Table 13 
summarizes observations concerning flowering behavior and 
pod production of the plants. At the time the notes were 
recorded it was quite evident that both esters had approxi¬ 
mately the same effect at equal concentrations, and also 
that twice as great a concentration of amine was required 
to produce an effect equal to that of the ester. Apparently 
sprays containing greater than 1/8 ounce 2,4-D amine or 1/16 
ounce of 2,4-D ester and 2,4,5-T ester delayed abscission 
of flowers. Later in the season these flowers, after wither¬ 
ing, dropped from the plants. Such behavior was especially 
noticeable in the plots treated with 1 and 2 ounces of acid 
equivalent per acre. 

The effects of the chemical treatments on the 
yields of these plots are shown in Figures 5 and 6. The 
difference between the mean yields of treated and check 
plots was calculated as per cent increase or decrease over 
the control. The bar graphs compare the per cent increase 
or decrease for each concentration at both Edmonton and 
Tiger Lily. 

The variance analysis of the alfalfa yield data 
for the Edmonton plots is shown in Table 14 and that for 
the Tiger Lily plots in Table 15. The F values indicated

the alfalfa plants, was sufficient to cause significant 
decreases in yield and similarly applications of 1/4 ounce 
of 2,4-D ester per acre when applied either twice or five 
times increased yield significantly. In certain cases 
where significant increases or decreases were obtained only 
at Edmonton and not at Tiger Lily there must have been a 
cumulative effect from the 5 treatments.

Discussion 


Since the chemical was applied late in the flowering 
stage of Altaswede red clover and the first killing frost 
was 3 weeks later, it is probable that the seeds produced 
by the flowers, fresh at the time of the treatment, were 
immature when the frost occurred, and hence damaged by it* 
Shrivelled seeds were noted during cleaning of the samples 
so it is quite possible that any potential effect of the 
chemical treatments on the seed yields was masked by the 
frost. Sokoljskaja (33) reported increases in seed yield 
following sprays of 0.001 per cent of 2,4-D, but the amount 
of application was not stated. Further tests using various 
rates at various gallonages applied at various times through¬ 
out the flowering stage must be carried out before final 
decisions regarding effects of such chemicals on seed set 
of red clover can be made. Such tests would have been 
undertaken in 1950 at the University of Alberta had the 
red clover not been winter killed* 

The tests carried out in 1950 using successive 
spray applications of 2 ounces or less of 2,4-D amine and 
ester, 2,4,5-T and A.O.C.P. per acre produced various 
results with alfalfa at University of Alberta. Where twisting 
and thickening of stems was noted in the 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T 
plots it was found later that the same applications had 
caused considerable reductions in seed yield. This was

attributable to a lethal effect of the chemical on many of 
the flower buds. 

The graph for 2,4-D at Edmonton, Figure 6, appears 
to give an abnormal illustration of the effect of this 
chemical on yield. The mean yield for the check plots in the 
2,4-D block was unusually high in comparison with the other 
check means. If there had been more replicates in this test 
the mean check yield would probably have been smaller, and 
hence more in line with that of comparable untreated material. 

In this event the graph would have resembled that for Tiger 
Lily plot yields. 

It seems highly probable that, since retention of 
flowers on tobacco has been shown to be a- hormone phenomenon 
(17), hormones applied at the right concentration might cause 
the retention of the flowers on alfalfa. In the observations 
at Edmonton it was apparent that faded flowers were retained 
on the treated plants for a much longer period than on the 
checks. These flowers might have been killed and their 
abscission process thus destroyed or there may have been a 
hormonal effect, due to the applied chemical, preventing the 
formation of the abscission layer. If the latter was the 
case it seems possible that the flowers which were retained 
were in a condition receptive to pollen for a longer period 
than normal and hence their opportunity for pollination 
increased as compared with that of the untreated flowers. 

As a result increased seed set could be expected. Since 1/4 
ounce of 2,4-D ester per acre increased seed yield significantly

at both Edmonton and Tiger Lily, it does not seem possible 
that both these results were accidental. There is a greater 
probability that a significant increase at only one location 
might have been attributable to chance variation for example 
the result from treatment with 1/32 ounce of 2,4-D ester 
per acre at Edmonton* 

A.O.C.P. seems to show promise of being able to 

seed 

increase yield of alfalfa. At Tiger Lily yield was increased 
by all rates of this chemical applied only twice during 
flowering, while at Edmonton, where plots received 5 applica¬ 
tions, yield was increased by the lower rates and decreased 
following the higher rates of application. One of the 
increases at Edmonton, a rise of 49 per cent, was statistically 
significant. Possibly 3 or even 4 applications instead of 
the 5 actually applied might have been sufficient to give 
increases more significant than those observed. 

More work will have to be done before definite 
conclusions can be drawn. Plot size and number of replications 
should be increased to eliminate variation which is common 
in perennial crops. If it is possible to consistently increase 
seed set by these treatments, the minimum number of treatments 
necessary for optimum increases should be ascertained so that 
as little as possible mechanical damage would occur to the 
crop as a result of the operation of standard field spray 
equipment.

Field spray equipment should be used in further 
experiments because coverage by such sprayers is not as thorough 
as with hand sprayers* Use of a fog type spray might possibly 
be more effective than a high gallonage spray for this type 
of work* Probably large droplets from regular spray equip¬ 
ment contain more than enough solution to cause the flowers 
to remain on the plant, and may because of this possible excess 
damage the flower. A fog spray might provide better coverage 
of a greater number of flowers by volumes just sufficient to 
have the desired hormonal effect on the flower. It is known 
that pollen contains a hormone and also an enzyme system which 
can release a hormone from its bound form in the tissue of 
the pistil as the pollen tubes grow. This hormone initiates 
growth in the ovary, and since some of it migrates to the 
base of the pistil it is believed that part of it moves into 
the pedicel of the flower to prevent the formation of the 
abscission layer (17). This layer ordinarily forms when 
flowers are not fertilized and have outlived their natural 
life on the plant. The amount of hormone released by or 
stimulated into action by the pollen would be relatively 
small, and hence it is felt that a fog type application of 
synthetic hormone, intended to produce a comparable effect, 
might be most suitable for this type of work. 

Future investigations should also include caged 
plots or portions of plots from which insects would be 
excluded to make possible determinations as to whether or not

any increases in seed yield of chemically treated plots are 
due to selfing or to crossing. If increases in seed yield 
were found to be due to selfing then progeny tests would 
have to be carried out to determine whether or not there 
was a loss of vigor due to chemically induced self pollination. 
If there was a loss of vigor it would not be in the interests 
of agriculture to perfect a method of increasing seed set by 
these means. 

If there was no loss of vigor or if increases 
were due to cross pollination, and if techniques could be 
developed satisfactorily costs would appear not to be the 
limiting factor. Under conditions in Alberta an increase in 
seed yield of only 20 pounds per acre would be sufficient to 
meet the cost of operation for 4 successive sprays with 
2,4-D at rates that produced increases in the foregoing tests. 
Work of this type would have to be very accurate since, on 
the basis of available results, the margin between rates 
which increase and those which decrease yield appears to be 
very narrow. For example; 1/4 of an ounce of 2,4-D ester 
per acre gave a significant increase in yield, but 1/2 
ounce per acre reduced yield and 1 ounce per acre significantly 
decreased yield of alfalfa in the tests at Edmonton.

Summary 


1* Alfalfa plants treated during flowering stage with 

successive applications of the esters of 2,4-dichloro- 
phenoxyacetic acid and of 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic 
acid at rates of 1/8 to 1 ounce of acid equivalent in 
45 gallons of water per acre or with 2,4-D amine at 
1/4 to 2 ounces per acre retained their flowers for 
longer times than did those which were untreated. 

2. Successive sprays of 1/4 ounce acid equivalent of 
2,4-D ester in 45 gallons of water per acre applied 
during flowering stage of alfalfa increased seed yield 
significantly both at Edmonton and at Tiger Lily. The 
increases were 122 per cent and 55 per cent respectively. 

3. Successive sprays of 1 ounce acid equivalent of 2,4-D 
ester in 45 gallons of water per acre applied during 
flowering stage decreased seed yield of alfalfa 
significantly both at Edmonton and at Tiger Lily. 

The decreases were 75 per cent and 28 per cent 
respectively. 

4. At Tiger Lily all rates from 1/16 to 2 ounces acid 
equivalent of a-o-chlorophenoxyproprionic acid in 45 
gallons of water per acre increased seed yield whereas
