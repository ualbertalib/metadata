SYNOPSIS 


The author’s primary aim in this investigation 
was to determine whether the bus transportation system 
used by four consolidated school divisions in southern 
Alberta, had any effect upon educational achievement 
of grade two, four, and six pupils respectively, over 
a fourteen month period. 

Two forms of the Stanford Achievement Test, 
one given in January 1956 and the other in April 1957, 
were used to compare the educational achievement of 
children travelling to school by official school bus, 
with that of children who were not conveyed to school 
in this manner. The results of the tests were treated 
statistically using the analysis of covariance technique. 

To determine whether intra-group differences 
were present, a further analysis was made using the 
scores of children spending a long and short time in 
bus travel. 

In all samples, the data were tested to determine 
whether the assumptions necessary for the analysis of 
covariance were fulfilled. 

Results of the analysis indicated that the 
grade two children who traveled to school in the official 
school bus gained significantly less in achievement 
over the fourteen month period than did those children

not transported. This result was treated with extreme 
caution, since all the prerequisite assumptions for 
the analysis could not be made* There appeared to be 
no relationship between vanning and school achievement 
in grades four and six. 

Analysis of covariance techniques were also 
employed to determine whether there were any differences 
in achievement between children spending a long and 
short time in van travel. At the grade six level only 
did there appear significant evidence suggesting that 
pupils spending a short time in van travel made greater 
achievement gains than those travelling for a long 
period of time. 

The interpretation of the results of the 
covariance analysis for all grades and groups was found 
to be limited due to the methods of sampling, and equating 
of groups. Further limitations were thought to have 
been imposed by the reliability of the testing instrument, 
the previous effects of vanning, and intelligence and 
attendance.

CHAPTER I 
INTRODUCTION 

During the past twenty years in the Province 
of Alberta there has been a movement directed toward 
the elimination of the small ungraded rural school, 
through the reorganization of school districts into 
areas encompassing a population capable of supporting 
one large school unit. This process of reorganization 
is referred to as consolidation or centralization. 

Perhaps one of the most important advantages of 
consolidation is the equalization of rural and urban 
educational opportunities. Through consolidation it 
has been possible for the rural school divisions to 
recruit and retain teachers of high calibre, to offer 
compulsory and optional courses leading to grade twelve 
graduation, and to operate a modern school unit 
efficiently by distributing costs over a larger 
population. 

Since a consolidated unit serves a greater area 
than the isolated rural school, a transportation system 
is needed to convey students to and from school. In 
the Province of Alberta for the year ending in 1956 
school divisions maintaining consolidated schools were 
transporting 62,£64 pupils over a distance of 102,790 

miles per day, at an annual cost of almost six million

dollars^" It is evident that the transportation system 
entails a tremendous financial expenditure and therefore 
must contribute substantially to the equalization of 
educational opportunity if it is to justify itself. 

Research^ has shown that transporting of students 
to and from school has increased attendance of rural 
pupils. Regardless of how efficiently the transportation 
network has been designed, however, it tends to increase 
the length of school day for transported students. It 
might be expected that this would have an adverse 
effect upon rural children particularly when the 
children might have farm duties to perform before and 
after school. If the design of the present transportation 
system exerts and adverse effect upon the achievement 
of rural school students, then the advantages of 
consolidation may need re-examination.

THE PROBLEM 

Many teachers in consolidated schools have 
felt that there is a detrimental effect exerted by 
transportation upon the educational achievements of 
rural students, and that this effect is especially 
evident when comparisons of educational achievement 
are made with children not receiving transportation. 

This study, then, was undertaken to test the 
following null hypotheses: 

(1) The gain in educational achievement at 
the grades two, four and six levels, over 
a fourteen month period, as measured by 
the Stanford Achievement Test, does not 
differ significantly between children 
travelling on the official school van 
and those who do not. 

(2) There are no significant differences in 
gain in educational achievement, as 
measured by the Stanford Achievement Test, 
between students spending a relatively 
long or short time in bus travel at the 
grade two, four, or six levels. 

RELATED STUDIES 

An analysis of the available research data, as 
listed by the Education Index 3 1 and Encylopedia of 
Educational Research ^, indicate that studies of the 
relationship between vanning of pupils and educational

achievement are lacking. The majority of studies 
listed and available dealt with transportation, 
finance, bus routes, safety, vehicle standards, and 
driver selection. No studies available appeared 
directly related to transportation and its effect upon 
student achievement. Research reviewed in this study 
has received only a cursory treatment either because 
it does not relate directly to the problem at hand, 
or because the data were not considered sufficiently 
reliable to warrant serious consideration. 

Lambert^ has indicated that many rural 
children who must travel to school by van have the 
length of their school day considerably increased. 

He feels this is a particularly important problem 
since many rural children have already an extended day 
due to farm chores. He recommends the possible 
revision of school curriculum in consideration of 
bus travel to and from school. However he gives no 
direct indication of possible deleterious effects of 
bus travel upon educational achievement.

school division during the period of 1949 to 1952,

Andrews^* states that after consolidation grade nine 
failures decreased thirty-seven percent. Since these 
comparisons were not obtained by rigorous experimental 
analysis, their value in substantiating the beneficial 
effects of consolidation and the associated 
transportation system, is very limited. 

An experiment conducted by T. Lee^ in England, 
showed a greater degree of maladjustment for children 
transported to school than for children who were not 
so conveyed. His results also showed that there 
appeared to be an improvement with increase in age 
in the adjustment of children walking to school, and 
an increasingly poorer adjustment for pupils 
transported to school. Unfortunately, no measurements 
of educational achievement were made for these groups; 
however it is well known that poor adjustment at 
school usually has a deleterious effect upon educational 
achievement.

CHAPTER TWO 
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN 

The study undertaken in this thesis represents 
only a portion of a larger investigation of school 
achievement of rural pupils conducted during a 
fourteen month interval between January 1956 and 
April 1957# The main experimental design called for 
the testing of two groups of two hundred children 
each, in grades two, four, and six respectively, in 
four southern Alberta school divisions. Dichotomization 
of the pupils in each grade into control and 
experimental groups was based upon whether or not they 
travelled to school by van. 

The tests selected for administration to 
control and experimental groups were used to obtain 
quantitative measures of educational achievement, 
and intelligence. A personal data sheet compiled by 
the teacher, was used to obtain information regarding 
health, attendance, and time spent in van travel. 

The Stanford Achievement Tests and Otis Quick- 
Scoring Tests of Mental Ability were used to give 
measures of achievement and intelligence. 

This study is concerned with the analysis of 
differences in educational achievement, as measured 
by the Stanford Achievement Test, between control and

experimental groups. The information obtained from 
other testing instruments was not subjected to 
statistical analysis in this study. 

THE TESTS 

The Primary, Elementary, Intermediate 
Partial, and Advanced Partial batteries of the 
Stanford Achievement Tests, forms K and then J, were 
administered at the appropriate grade levels to 
determine the gains in educational achievement between 
control and experimental groups. 

The Stanford Achievement Test is basically 
divided into six subtests: Paragraph Meaning, Word 
Meaning, Spelling, Arithmetic Reasoning, and 
Arithmetic Computation. In the Elementary, Intermediate 
Partial, and Advanced Partial batteries, a Language 
subtest is added. 

The raw scores for each subtest of the Stanford 
Achievement Test were transformed into grade scores 
representing a grade placement equivalent to the 
degree of subject matter mastery. The grade scores 
for each student on the six subtests were then 
averaged to determine the battery median which was 
used for the statistical analysis in this study. To 
facilitate calculations the battery medians were 
multiplied by ten.

There appears to be no statistical evidence 
on the validity of the Stanford Achievement Test; 
however the designers state that because of theif 
rigid and extensive sampling technique, and their 
reliance upon the advice of subject matter 
specialists, the test gives a good measure of the 
skills and understandings commonly accepted as 
desirable outcomes of the school program. Hanna and 
Norcross^ have indicated that the spelling, word 
usage, and arithmetic content of the Stanford 
Achievement Test were quite adequate. The same 
authors also indicated, however, that the reading 
section of the test could be improved by better 
selection of content. 

Reliability coefficients for the various 
subtests within the Stanford Achievement Tests appear 
in Table I.

THE SAMPLE 

In 1956 two groups of children from each of 
grades two, four, and six respectively were obtained 
from the population of four southern Alberta school 
divisions. Of the two groups of children used in this 
study, one was conveyed to school by official school 
busses and the other was not. Henceforth, these 
children will be referred to as the vanned and unvanned 
groups.

Book Co., New York.

10 


In most cases the children in the vanned group 
resided on farms within the boundaries of the school 
division. The unvanned group resided primarily in 
small towns in which the consolidated schools were 
located. The number of children brought to school 
from farms by means other than the official school 
bus was believed to be negligible 0 

The initial design of the experiment called 
for the testing of a total of two hundred children in 
each grade and group drawn from the four consolidated 
divisions. In an attempt to obtain this number, all 
children at the grade two, four and six level were 
tested. At the conclusion of the fourteen months 
it was found that many children had incomplete sets 
of scores, and others had moved away, thus making it 
impossible to obtain the sample of the size originally 
decided upon. 

Table II lists the numbers of students in 
the control and experimental group whose scores were 
considered sufficiently complete for inclusion in 
this study.

PROCEDURE 

All the children of the control and experimental 
groups registered in grades two, four, and six in 
January 1956 were administered Form K of the Stanford 
Achievement Test* Fourteen months later all children 
in the control and experimental groups were retested 
using Form J of the same test. All tests were teacher- 
administered, and precautions were taken to ensure 
conformity to the instructions for test administration. 

Grade scores were calculated, and from these, 
battery medians were determined. The results for 
experimental and control groups for each school were 
tabulated and then pooled for the statistical analysis. 

In the design of this experiment it was decided 
the Stanford Achievement Test would give satisfactory 
measures of educational achievement gain over the 
fourteen month interval. Although the original number 
of two hundred children was not obtained, it is

believed the final sample size was large enough to 
give a reliable measure of any significant changes 
in educational achievement.

CHAPTER THREE 
STATISTICAL TREATMENT 

The scores on the Stanford Achievement Test, 
obtained for the control and experimental groups in 
April 1957, were compared for differences by the 
analysis of covariance technique. The analysis of 
covariance design has a specific advantage over 
other statistical treatments since it can be used 
when it is impossible or quite difficult to equate 
control and experimental groups at the start of an 
experiment.*^ 

In this study, the January 1956 mean grade 
scores for both control and experimental groups were 
used as the basis upon which final test scores were 
adjusted. These initial test scores in effect 
provided the basis upon which control and experimental 
groups were equated. 

Little appears to have been written regarding 
the assumptions upon which the analysis of covariance 
is based. However, since the analysis of covariance 
is an extension of the analysis of variance technique, 
assumptions presupposed in the latter are also considered 


H.E. Garrett. Statistics in Psychology and Education , 
Longmans, Green and Co., Toronto, 1953* P* 2WT~ 
















14 


to apply in the former technique. Eisenhart states 
the following assumptions are necessary for the 

"strict validity of the analysis of covariance 

12 lq 

procedure," when solving Class I problems. P 

1. The measurements obtained are observed values 
(of random variables) distributed about true 
mean values. 

2. The effects which contribute to the observed 
measurements are additive. 

3# The observed measurements in each group have 
a common variance. 

4. The observed values are normally distributed. 

In addition, Dixon and Massey indicate a 
further assumption necessary for the analysis of 
covariance. 

"In order to show mathematically that the F ratio 
can be applied in the analysis of covariance, 
it is necessary to assume that within each group 
the I values are normally distributed about the 
same regression line with the same variance for 
the difference values of X."14 

One further assumption necessary for the 
analysis of covariance is the linearity of relationship 
between initial and final scores. 

In most practical cases, it is difficult to

of Variance." Biometrics . March 1947 , Vol. 3, No. 1,

Analysis . McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York, “T951, p. 179.

15 


satisfy all assumptions necessary for strict 

justification of the technique. However, an experimental 

design which cannot presuppose all the necessary 

assumptions does not completely invalidate results 

obtained by the covariance technique. 

"Failure of any assumption will impair to some 
extent the standard properties on which the 
widespread utility of the technique depends. 

Since an experimenter could rarely, if ever, 
convince himself that all the assumptions were 
exactly satisfied in his data, the technique 
must be regarded as approximative rather than 
exact." 15 

In this study it was assumed that the observed 
mean scores were random variables distributed about 
a true mean. Statistically this means that the grade 
scores for each group, upon random selection, would 
vary about an average value. It was also assumed 
that the observed grade score is made up of additive 
factors. That is; 

y - +• + £jk 

where y is the observed grade score mean 9y u a general 
contributing factor, that part of y thought to be 
contributed by special treatment, and £ JK an error 
component. Another possible alternative assumption, 
that the factors contributing to y are multiplicative,

seems less tenable* 

The assumptions of normality, for the large 
groups were tested. The effects of non-normality 
of the parent population upon analysis of variance 
appear to be relatively small. In discussing non¬ 
normal populations, Kenney and Keeping^ state: 

Tt ....it appears that the ordinary F-test may 
be applied without serious error to most types 
of distributions that are likely to occur.” 

In discussing the effects of non-normal 
populations upon the analysis of variance, V/.G. 
Cochran states: 

”The consensus from these investigations is 
that no serious error is introduced by non¬ 
normality in the significance levels of the 
F-test or of the two-tailed t-test. 

If a guess may be made about the limits of 
error, the true probability corresponding to 
the tabular 5 percent significance level may 
lie between 4 and 7 percent. For the 1 percent 
level, the limits might be taken as J percent 
and 2 percent. As a rule, the tabular 
probability is an underestimate; that is, by 
using the ordinary F and t tables we tend to 
err in the direction of announcing too many 
significant results. 

The assumptions of homogeneity of variance, 
linear regression between initial and final scores,

and homoscedasticity in this study, also received 
statistical validation whenever group size would 
allow reliable results. 

TEST OF LINEARITY 

To determine whether there was a linear 

relationship between the January 1956 and April 1957 

grade score means, a correlation table was constructed 

to determine the correlation coefficient and 

correlation ratio. The computational procedures 

followed, were according to the outline in Kenney 
l£ 

and Keeping. 

The test of linearity involves the calculation 
of sums of squares from the observed scores which 
are attributable to linear regression, and comparing 
this value to the calculated sums of squares not 
accounted for by linear regression. The comparison 
is made on the basis of the F distribution. Table III 
shows the analysis of variance used to determine 
linearity of regression of Y on X.

TEST OF HOMOGENEITY OF VARIANCE 

In order that the results obtained by the 

analysis of covariance technique might reflect 

differences between means exclusive of group 

variability, the April 1957 test scores for each 

group compared were tested for homogeneity of variance. 

The basic design of this test is described 
20 

by Kenney and Keeping. A criterion value, M, is 
calculated from the comparisons of two groups variances. 
The method of calculating M follows below. 

M = 2.303 [ Nlog S k / N - n k log 10 (S k /n k )] 

and a correction for sample size 

C = 1 3[b - l) {E(i)-4] 

where, b - number of samples. 

Sj£ - Sums of Squares for both sample. 

n^ - size of sample being compared minus one, 

N - summation of - 2. 

M - measure of significance of homogeneity 
of variance. 

C - correction factor for size. 

M is then compared with selected probability values 
of the x 2 table with the degrees of freedom equal to

the number of groups compared minus one. (See sample 
calculation in Appendix C.) 

TEST OF NORMALITY 

The tests of normality utilized for the 

larger samples in this study were those outlined 

21 

by Kenney and Keeping. The distributions tested 
were the April 1957 test results for the vanned and 
unvanned groups. The observed frequency distributions 
tested for normality were obtained by taking the 
frequencies of the class intervals in the correlation 
chart used for the linearity test for each group. 

In each case the observed distribution was 
compared to a calculated theoretical normal curve 
having the same sample size as the distribution under 
test. T t’-values were calculated for each class 
interval of the observed distribution and with the 
use of these values the theoretical frequency was 
determined by finding the area under the normal curve 
between the successive t values. The goodness of fit 
was then tested using the x 2 distribution. 

The calculations were entered into a table 
illustrated below.

unvanned group in April 1957. 

The analysis consists of estimating variances 

from the April 1957 testing, correcting these for 

initial January 1956 scores, and then comparing the 

unbiased variance estimates by using the F test. 

The basic formula explaining the covariance is 

E(x jk - X) (y jk - y) a E(x jk -x. k )(y jk -y. k ) -r 

E n k(x.k~x)(y. k -y) 

where n^ is the number of pairs in the kth sample. 

In the analysis the computational process 
produces the following results for the kth group. 

U) C llk = E(xjk - x. k ) 2 

(2) c 22 k a E^jk ~ y*k) 2 

and the cross-product 

(3) C 12k « E(xj k - x. k ) (yj k - y-k) 

The regression coefficient was obtained for 

the control and experimental groups by: 

b k = 

c 12k 

The data calculated above was then entered 
into a table as illustrated below.

The quantities, obtained by squaring the 
subtracted individual scores from group mean scores, 
and the cross products of paired scores, are called 
sums of squares and sums of products, respectively. 

The sums of squares are in effect, measures of 
variability -when divided by the proper degress of freedom, 

represents the sums of squares of the y 
values when corrected for individual regression, or 
initial test results, 

S 3k = c 22 ■ \°12k 

The correction for regression is in the term 
*>fc c 12k 

where b^ is the coefficient of regression. 

The calculations described above result in 
the sums of squares and cross-products attributable 
to within the groups, with the summation being expressed 

by C ll'W’ C 12w> C 22v> and S 3w* 


















26 


Calculations which describe differences in 
variability between groups are given below. 

(}.) Sum of Products between groups: 

c 12f :E n k (x. k -x)(y. k - y) 

(2) Sum of Squares between groups: 

Cllf =E n k (x. k - x) 2 
c 22f =E n k (y. k - y) 2 

where x and y are averages of the X and Y variables 
after combining the samples. 

These formulae are very similar to C]_2k>

c 12f> c llf . and c 22f> whereas in C 12k , C llk , and 
^22k eac ^ individual observation retains its original 
value. 

As determined previously, a regression 
coefficient expressing the relationship between 
initial and final scores is necessary for correction. 
The regression coefficient for between groups is 
essentially a regression coefficient of the means 
since each Xj k has been assigned its column mean 
value. 

The regression coefficient between groups is: 
b f = C 12f 
C llf 







27 


The process of calculating sums of squares and 
products was repeated after pooling the scores of 
the groups. The necessary equations are: 

(1) Sums of Products after pooling: 

c i2o = £ ( x jk - x > (yjk " ?> 

(2) Sums of Squares after pooling: 

c no = £ Ujk - x ) 2 
c i2o = Z (yjk - y ) 2 

The regression coefficient for the pooled 
group is: 


^o -

'110 


The results of the calculation of the sums 
of squares after correcting for the effects of 
regression are called residual sums of squares. 

(1) For the whole sample the residual sums of 

squares are: ^ 

s o = z{ (y jk - y - b o < x jk - x ) 

= c 220 “ b o c 120 

and the unbiased estimate of population variance 
is S 0 /(N-2). 

(2) For the sample means (between groups) the 
residual sums of squares are: 

s l = Zi( nk ^ y,k ■ y “ b f ^ x *k “ x |j 

= C 22f " b f C 12f 

and the unbiased estimate of population variance 
is S^/(b-2) where b is the number of groups. 




(3) For within groups the residual sums of squares 
are: 

S 2 = c 22w “ b w C 12w 
and the unbiased estimate of population 

variance S 2 /(N-b-l). 

(4) The residual sum of squares within groups 
representing the difference between corrections 
made for group regression and combined regression 
is: 

S 4 =Z b k C 12k - b w c 12w 

and the unbiased estimate of population 
variance is S^/(b-l) # 

(5) The quantity So calculated previously, represents 
the sum of squares within groups corrected 

for individual group regression. The unbiased 
estimate of the population variance in this 
case is, 


S 3 /(N-2b) 

In each case the unbiased estimate of 
population variance is called the Mean Square. 

A summary of the residual sums of squares 
necessary for the covariance analysis appears below.

Results of the test of linearity indicate that: 

1. There was a linear relationship between initial 
and final test scores, on the Stanford 
Achievement Test for 171 vanned grade two 
children. The null hypothesis that the 
true regression is linear was accepted, 




















32 


since an F value of 0.751 could have 
occurred through chance error more 
frequently than five times out of one 
hundred times. 

2# There was a linear relationship between 
initial and final test scores, on the 
Stanford Achievement Test for 144 unvanned 
grade two children. The null hypothesis 
that the true regression is linear was 
accepted, since an F value of 1.17& could 
have occurred through chance error more 
frequently than five out of one hundred 
time s. 

On the basis of these results, the assumption 
of linearity was considered valid at the grade two 
level for the vanned and unvanned groups. 

The test of homoscedasticity for the vanned 
group indicated that the value of 0 # 969 was beyond 
the necessary 0.776 of the tabulated five percent 
level in Nayer»s table. On this basis it was concluded 
that the 1 65 mean grade scores of the grade two 
vanned children, were distributed with consistency 
about the regression line Y on X. The reduction of 
sample size was due to elimination of columns showing 
low frequencies since a reliable estimate of variance 
could not be made on the distribution of one or two 
scores. 


A similar finding was evident for the grade 
two unvanned students. In this case the test of 
homoscedasticity indicated the value of 0.&47 was 
greater than the 0.700 tabulated value at the five

percent level in Nayer's table. On this basis it 
was concluded that the 140 grade scores of the grade 
two unvanned children were distributed with consistency 
about the regression line Y on X. A reduction in the 
sample size was made for the same reasons as mentioned 
before. 

The test describing the goodness of fit 
between the observed distribution of the final 
Stanford Achievement scores and a theoretical normal 
distribution, gave a Chi-square value of 16.£3 for 
the vanned and 24.94 for the unvanned grade two pupils. 
The probability of the Chi-square being at least as 
great as that observed in both cases was greater than 
five percent. On this basis the assumption of 
normality of the distribution of the mean grade scores 
on the Stanford Achievement test for the vanned and 
unvanned grade two students was considered valid. 

The tests of homogeneity of variances has been 
summarized in Table X.

34 


The observed value of M/c when compared to 
the tabulated value at the five percent level of 
the distribution, indicated a significant 
difference in the variance of the test scores between 
vanned and unvanned groups at the grade two level. 

In this case, if the sample size had been 
smaller, a logarithmic transformation: 

0 (x) - log (1 f x) 

would have had to be made to stabilize the variance 
before the analysis of covariance was made. 

Since there appeared to be indication of 
slight heterogeneity of variance between the two 
samples (the criterion five percent value was 3*94$), 
the result of the covariance analysis should be 
treated with caution. However, in this regard W. G. 
Cochran states: 

n If the changes in error variance are 
large these losses (in efficiency) may 
be substantial. The validity of the F 
test for all treatments is probably the 
least affected.23 

The results of the analysis of covariance 
appear in Table XI.

An analysis of Table XI indicates a significant 


difference in educational achievement over the fourteen 
month interval, as measured by the Stanford Achievement 
Test, between 171 vanned and 144 unvanned students 
in grade two. The results were in favor of the 
unvanned group. 

The null hypothesis of equal treatment for 
vanned and unvanned groups is rejected by both F^ 
and F 2 , since the combination of variances obtained 
could have occurred through errors of chance less 
frequently than once in a hundred times.

differences, the analysis of covariance was repeated 
using the mean grade scores of children in 
approximately the first and fourth quartiles of the 
time-in-bus distribution* Figure One illustrates 
this distribution.

Those children who were in the bus from four 
to twenty-two minutes, and from forty-five to ninety 
minutes, were considered to have spent a long and 
short time respectively, in travelling to school. 

A test of linearity between initial and final 
scores was conducted. Table XII and XIII show the

In both cases, the null hypothesis that the 
true regression is linear, is acceptable since the 
observed F values could have occurred through chance 
error more frequently than five out of hundred times. 

A rigorous test of normality was not conducted 
upon the data obtained from those children spending a 
long and short time in van travel because sample sizes 
■were considered too small to provide reliable results. 

























38 


A cursory check of normality was made however, by 
graphing the cumulative values of the grade mean 
scores. These points appeared to distribute themselves 
normally. The graphs appear in Appendix F. 

No test of homoscedasticity was conducted on 
the groups travelling a long and short time on the 
bus. It was decided that the small number of 
observations in each column of the correlation chart 
would not give a true measure of the consistency of 
variance of the scores about the regression line. 

A test of homogeneity, however, was conducted. 
The results of this analysis appear in Table XIV.

Table XV indicates that there are no 


significant differences in educational achievement 
between forty-five grade two pupils spending a short 
time on the van, and forty-five grade two pupils 
spending a long time in bus travel. The null hypothesis 
that the treatment received by both groups does not 
differ was accepted since a combination of variances 
as obtained by the analysis of covariance technique 
could have occurred through chance error alone, more 
than five out of one hundred times.

Both F tests, indicated that there was a 
linear relationship between the grade score means of 
the January 1956 and April 1957 testing. In both 
cases the null hypothesis that the true regression is 
linear was accepted since neither of the observed F 
ratios were beyond the tabulated five percent level.

41 


On the basis of these tests the assumption 
of linearity of regression between initial and final 
scores for control and experimental groups was 
considered valid. 

The test of homoscedasticity, which measured 
the consistency of variance about the regression line, 
showed that for the vanned group was 0.953 with 
a calculated harmonic mean of 7 from 13 observations. 
Since the tabulated five percent level in Nayer T s 
table was 0.795, the assumption of equal variance of 
the April 1957 test scores about the regression line 
Y on X, was considered valid. 

Similar results for the grade four unvanned 
group were found. In this case the computed was 
0.302 with a calculated harmonic mean of 7 from 13 
observations. The calculated L]_ was beyond the 0.732 
tabulated at the five percent level in Nayer f s table. 
The assumption of homoscedasticity for the unvanned 
grade four pupils was judged valid on this basis. 

The test describing the goodness of fit 
between the April 1957 Stanford Achievement Test grade 
mean scores of the vanned group, and a theoretical 
normal distribution, gave a Chi-square value of 23.99. 
The tabulated five percent level of the Chi-square 
distribution with 20 degrees of freedom is 31.401. 






42 


On the basis of these results it was concluded that 
the observed distribution of the Stanford Achievement 
Test scores did not show any evidence of non-normality. 

The test of normality for the April 1957 
testing of the vanned group, gave a calculated Chi- 
square value of 13.46, with 23 degrees of freedom. 

The tabulated five percent level of the Chi-square 
distribution of 37*652 indicated there was no reason 
to suspect the distribution to be of a non-normal 
nature. 

The results of the test measuring the 
differences in variance between the grade scores 
of the Stanford Achievement Test for grade four 
vanned and unvanned student, appears in Table XVIII.

The analysis of covariance shoved that there 
vere no significant differences in educational 
achievement betveen 188 vanned and 160 unvanned grade 
four pupils, over a fourteen month period. The null 
hypothesis that treatments do not effectively differ 
vas accepted since the observed variances as calculated 
by the covariance technique could have occurred more 












44 


frequently than five out of one hundred times. 

In an effort to determine whether time on bus 
might contribute to educational achievement differences 
among the grade four vanned students, the analysis of 
covariance was repeated using the mean grade scores 
of children in the first and fourth quartile of the 
time-in-bus distribution. Figure Two illustrates 
this distribution and the quartiles selected'for 
further study*

A rigorous test of normality was not conducted

that the sample sizes were too small to provide

The test of homoscedasticity was not conducted on the

assumed.

The results of the test of linearity of 
regression indicated that: 

1* There is a linear relationship between initial 
and final test scores, of the Stanford 
Achievement Test for 167 vanned grade six 
children. The null hypothesis, that the 
true regression is linear was accepted, 
since an F value of 1.442 could have occurred 
through chance error more frequently than 
five times out of one hundred times. 

2. There is a linear relationship between 

initial and final test scores, of the Stanford 
Achievement Test for the 143 unvanned grade 
six children. The null hypothesis, that the 
true regression is linear was accepted, since 
an F value of 0.227 could have occurred 
through chance error more frequently than 
five out of one hundred times. 

On the basis of these results, the assumption 
of linearity was considered valid at the grade six 
level for the vanned and unvanned groups. 

The test of homoscedasticity indicated that the 
L-^ value of 0.932 was beyond the necessary 0.B10 of 
the tabulated five percent level in Nayer T s table. On 
the basis of these results, it was concluded that the 
variance about the regression line Y on X was consistent. 

Similar results for the grade six unvanned 
group were found. In this case the computed was 
O .&46 with a calculated harmonic mean of & from 12 
observations. The computed was beyond the 0.$07 
tabulated at the five percent level in Nayer»s table. 

The assumption of homoscedasticity for the unvanned 
grade six pupils was judged valid on this basis.

The test measuring the goodness of fit between 
the April 1957 Stanford Achievement Test scores for 
the vanned group, and a theoretical normal distribution 
resulted in a Chi-square value of 14*14. With 19 
degrees of freedom the observed value was below the 
tabulated five percent value of 30*144. Similar 
results were found for the unvanned grade six group. 

In this case, the observed Chi-square value was 23.99 
and the tabulated five percent level 31.410. On 
the basis of these results there appeared no evidence 
to suggest that the experimental and control group 
scores on the Stanford Achievement Test, were not 
normally distributed.

between experimental and control groups, appear in

CHAPTER V 

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FURTHER 
STUDY 

The effectiveness of the analysis of 
covariance technique depends largely upon the 
extent to which the assumptions embodied in the 
theoretical design are met by the data under study. 

For this reason the results of the analysis of 
covariance were judged with the reservations imposed 
by the degree to which tests of linearity, normality, 
homoscedasticity, and homogeneity of variance 
indicated the validity of the prerequisite assumptions. 

THE EFFECT OF BUS TRANSPORTATION ON 
GRADE TWO PUPILS 

The results of the linearity and homoscedasticity 
tests indicated that there were no reasons to suspect 
non-linearity between initial and final scores, or 
that final scores were not distributed with consistent 
variance about the linear regression line. The test 
of normality, also gave no evidence which might be 
indicative of a non-normal distribution. However, 
since the results of the tests of homogeneity of 
variance of the grade mean scores between groups did 
indicate, at just beyond the five percent level, a 
degree of heterogeneity, results must be interpreted 
very cautiously. Heterogeneity was not evident between 


fi .

57 

groups travelling for long and short periods in the 
bus. 

The results of the analysis of covariance 
indicated that there was a significant difference in 
educational achievement as measured by the Stanford 
Achievement Test over a fourteen month period, between 
171 vanned and 144 unvanned grade two children. The 
results appeared to be in favor of the unvanned group. 

For the same grade, there appeared no 
statistical evidence to support the thesis that the 
educational achievement of children spending up to 
twenty-two minutes in bus travel, was greater than 
children spending forty-five minutes or more in bus 
travel. 

THE EFFECT OF BUS TRANSPORTATION 
ON GRADE FOUR AND SIX 
PUPILS 

Preliminary analysis of the data of both 
grades gave no reasons to suspect that the basic 
assumptions necessary for the analysis of covariance 
were not fulfilled. 

The results of the analysis of covariance for 
both grades four and six showed that there was no 
statistical evidence which would lead to the belief 
that the vanned students did not achieve as well on 
the Stanford Achievement Test as did the unvanned 



58 


pupils, over a fourteen month interval. 

There were also no significant differences 
in educational achievement over a fourteen month 
period between grade four pupils spending up to 
seventeen minutes in bus travel, and pupils spending 
more than forty minutes in bus travel. However, there 
was a significant difference in educational achievement 
over a fourteen month period, as measured by the 
Stanford Achievement Test, between grade six pupils 
spending up to nineteen minutes on the bus and pupils 
spending forty-four or more minutes in bus travel. 

The results appeared in favor of the group spending 
the shorter time in bus travel* 









59 


DISCUSSION 

The results of the covariance analysis at 
the grade two level indicated that there was a 
difference in educational achievement between vanned 
and unvanned pupils over a fourteen month interval. 

The results appeared to be in favor of the unvanned 
group. The null hypothesis, that both vanned and 
unvanned groups received essentially the same treatment 
during the experiment, was rejected at the .01 level 
of significance. This meant that if treatments for 
both groups had been exactly the same, the results 
obtained by the covariance analysis would have 
occurred less than once in one hundred times. Since 
this probability was considered quite unlikely, it 
was concluded that treatments must actually differ 
in some respect. However, this conclusion must be 
treated with extreme caution in view of the fact that 
homogeneity of variance between groups was not supported 
by statistical evidence. 

Before rejecting the null hypothesis that 
treatments did not differ it was assumed that both 
vanned and unvanned groups, at the start and during 
the experiment, received no different treatment, with 
the exception of the vanning variable under study 
during the experiment. 







.

. 




* 




60 


Vanned and unvanned groups at the grade two 
level were in effect equated on the basis of the 
initial Stanford Achievement Test results through 
the use of the analysis of covariance technique. 

The vanned and unvanned groups, then, were equated 
for the variables which are components of the 
initial test scores. To the extent that a particular 
variable, which might affect final results is not 
accounted for in the initial criterion, the final 
results of the analysis will be biased to some unknown 
degree. 

It is doubtful that both vanned and unvanned 
groups at the grade two level were completely equated 
for all variables, aside from vanning, which might 
have affected the final analysis. Recognition of this 
fact is particularly important when there appears 
reason to suspect differences in intelligence, 
attendance, and in educational and cultural backgrounds 
of the farm and town children. 

It was shown however, in another study,that 
no significant differences in intelligence and 
attendance between vanned and unvanned groups appeared 
at the grade two level. The results of the covariance

analysis therefore, can not be attributed to the 
effects of attendance and intelligence. This does 
not discount the possibility of differing educational 
stimuli prior to and during the experiment, and of 
cultural differences biasing the results of the 
analysis to favor the unvanned group at the grade two 
level. These uncontrolled variables become increasingly 
important in light of the fact that no attempt was 
made to obtain children for the experiment in a 
random manner. 

The results of the analysis of covariance 
in favor of the unvanned grade two group might also 
be due to the fact that the vanned group had already 
received differential treatment by the vanning process 
prior to the experiment. Since it is impossible to 
determine the effect of this upon the initial test, 
the control and experimental groups cannot be 
considered properly equated. 

Measurements of the degree of fatigue present 
in vanned and unvanned groups at the grade two level 
were not obtained. The results of the analysis 
indicating differential treatment between groups might 
be attributable to some extent to the fatigue resulting 
from travelling in the school bus. The possible 
effects of fatigue become increasingly important

considering that a young child may have to rise very 
early in the morning to catch the school bus. 

The deleterious results of vanning upon 
educational achievement at the grade two level might 
also be due to some psychological effects associated 
with, and possibly occurring during, bus transportation. 
T. Lee 2 ^ has given evidence to suggest that transported 
children tend to show a greater degree of maladjustment 
then children not transported. He hypothesizes that 
this effect might be due to the fact that transportation 
abruptly isolates the young child for the greater 
part of the day from the maternal atmosphere of the 
home. If this is correct, the results of the analysis 
for the young grade two students may truly represent 
an effect of bus transportation. 

The results of the covariance analysis between 
children in grade two spending short and long periods 
in bus travel, suggested the acceptance of the null 
hypothesis, that both groups received the same 
treatment during the interval of the experiment. In 
this case the groups were probably slightly better 
equated since all lived on farms, although the effects 
of previous vanning might still have contributed to

group inequalities. 

Because no significant difference could be 
found between groups travelling long or short periods, 
this does not necessarily indicate that travelling 
time is not important. It does however suggest the 
possibility that the act of vanning itself causes 
the difference in educational achievement between 
vanned and unvanned grade two students. This result 
would tend to support the hypothesis that other 
factors associated with vanning, such as T mother 
deprivation 1 mentioned by T. Lee 2 ^, are operative at 
the grade two level. 

The analysis of covariance at the grade four 
and six levels gave evidence to support the null 
hypothesis that the vanned and unvanned groups did 
in effect receive similar treatment during the fourteen 
month interval of the experiment. This result would 
then suggest that the process of vanning did not affect 
the educational achievement of grade four and six 
children when they were compared to similar 
untransported groups. 

Even though the analysis of covariance did 
not support the rejection of the null hypothesis, the

fact still remains that the results might have been 
affected to some unknown degree by uncontrolled 
variables such as intelligence, environment and cultural 
inequalities, sampling technique, and the equating 
of the groups solely upon the January 1956 Stanford 
•Achievement Test. 

The study of Holman 2 ? has indicated, however, 
that there were no significant differences in 
intelligence between control and experimental groups 
at the grade four and six levels. His analysis did 
however indicate a significant difference in attendance 
in grade six between vanned and unvanned groups, in 
favor of the unvanned group* Apparently this difference 
in attendance did not appear to affect the results 
of the analysis of covariance. 

The acceptance of the null hypothesis at the 
grade four and six levels, might be accounted for by 
the increased physical maturation of the pupils which 
would increase their ability to withstand fatigue. 

Since no measures of fatigue were made, this possible 
explanation must remain tentative. The results may 
also be accounted for by the fact that as the child 
matures he becomes more self-sufficient, and in doing

so, the effects of isolation from his home by vanning 
upon school adjustment and achievement might become 
less important. 

The endorsation of the null hypothesis at 
both the grade four and six levels might also be 
explained by the fact that if differences in 
educational background due to the home environment 
were responsible for group differences at the grade 
two level, these differences tend to be nullified by 
the effects of the school program. 

The analysis of covariance at the grade four 
and six levels between groups travelling for a long 
or short periods indicated the acceptance of the null 
hypothesis at the grade four level, but not at the 
grade six level. 

The null hypothesis that grade six students 
travelling long or short periods received the same 
treatment, was rejected at the «01 level of significance. 
The result indicated that the variances calculated 
by the analysis of covariance technique, could have 
occurred through errors of chance only once in one 
hundred times. Since the possibility of similar 
treatments producing the observed results was considered 
rather remote, it was concluded that treatments did 
differ for both groups. The results were in favor of

the group travelling the shorter time. 

If the results of the analysis for grade four 
children who spend long and short periods, travelling 
in the van, might be accounted for by the disappearance 
of fatigue and other factors concomitant to van 
transportation, such as maternal deprivation, this is 
not supported by the results at the grade six level. 

The rejection of the null hypothesis in the 
case of the grade six groups travelling for long and 
short periods, might be accounted for by the possible 
lower attendance of those pupils travelling the longest 
time. This possibility appears reasonable since the 
grade six child might contribute substantially toward 
helping on the farm, particularly if the child did 
not have to spend a long time travelling to and from 
school. Since no attendance figures were obtained for 
groups travelling for different lengths of time, this 
factor was not subjected to analysis. Since there 
did appear however, evidence to indicate the vanned 
group had poorer attendance than the unvanned group, 
there is the possibility of poorer attendance being 
associated with students spending the longer time in 
the bus* 

Differences between groups travelling for 
different lengths of time might also be accounted for

by possible differences in intelligence. However, 
the importance of this fact becomes small in the light 
of Holman T s results which indicated no differences 
in intelligence between vanned and unvanned groups. 
This does not however, discount the possibility of 
students who travel for a long time having lower 
intelligence then students who travel for a short 
time. 

Since fatigue and psychological isolation 
from the home, did not appear to have an adverse 
effect at the grade four level, it might also be 
assumed that these factors are reduced to an 
insignificant point at the grade six level. If this 
be the case, then the covariance result between the 
grade six groups travelling for short or long periods 
is best explained in terms of attendance differences. 

There are two other important factors which 
might have biased the results of the analysis of 
covariance at every grade and between all groups. One 
is the reliability of the Stanford Achievement Test 
form J, and the other is sex differences.. 

If the Stanford Achievement Test Form J, does 
not give reliable results, the differences between

groups may be exaggerated resulting in the frequent 

rejection of the null hypothesis. 

29 

T. Lee has suggested that boys in his study 
consistently showed greater maladjustment than the 
girls. Since all the groups under study were not 
checked for equality in the number of boys and girls, 
it is possible that the samples were biased. This 
factor would also tend to increase the number of 
significant results in the analysis of covariance. 

In view of the fact that certain prerequisite 
assumptions necessary for the analysis of covariance 
were not entirely satisfied, it is not possible to 
critically evaluate the effects of the school 
transportation system upon pupil achievement. It 
would appear advisable, however, that an attempt 
should be made to reduce the amount of physical and 
psychological isolation from the home of the young 
pupils participating in van transportation in 
consolidated rural school divisions. This might be 
brought about by readjustment of bus routes to shorten 
time schedules for those busses carrying a large 
number of young children. At the present time, however, 
it would appear that this would impose a greater 


29 


Op. Cit. , T. Lee 




■V 



69 


financial burden upon the already heavily taxed 
rural population. 

For the older pupils, whose educational 
achievements may possibly be more closely associated 
to attendance, it would appear little can be 
accomplished since this variable is probably a 
function of the present economic condition of the 
farmer. 

It is recommended that future research in 
the field of school vanning should attempt to obtain 
control and experimental groups in a statistically 
random fashion in order that the application of certain 
statistical techniques be considered more appropriate, 
and to permit the generalization of hypotheses to 
encompass the whole population of Alberta rural school 
children. 

Groups should be equated on such variables 
as intelligence, previous vanning, educational 
stimulation of the home, attendance, and distribution 
of the sexes. With these variables under control the 
results measuring differences in achievement would 
more truly represent the effects of transportation. 

Further research is also necessary to 
determine how transportation may be affecting the 
school adjustment pattern of pupils at various age 
and grade levels.

APPENDIX C 

SAMPLE CALCULATION OF THE TEST OF HOMOGENEITY

The test which determines whether two groups 
differ in variability centers about the calculation 
of M/c. This value is distributed according to the 
Chi-square distribution. 


M = 2.303 |^N Log S k / N - n k Logio (Sk/njjJ 

Using the data of the vanned and unvanned

The five percent level of the Chi-square

larger than the tabulated five percent level, the null

APPENDIX D 

SAMPLE CALCULATION FOR THE TEST OF 
NORMALITY 

The data for this calculation are taken 
from the sample correlation chart of Appendix I. 

To calculate the theoretical normal 
distribution which is used for the goodness of fit 
test, the following steps were made. 

(1) Calculation of the t values. 

^ , where, 

Sy 

y - the mid value of the scores taken from 
the correlation chart. 

y - the mean of the y values calculated from 
the correlation chart. 

Sy - the standard deviation of the y variable 
taken from the correlation chart. 

(2) The theoretical probability of number of cases 
falling between successive t values was then 
calculated. 

t -2.32 to the mean contains 9$3 percent 
of the area under the normal curve. 

t “2.11 to the mean contains 4$.257 percent 
of the area under the normal curve. 

Subtracting, (4$*9$3 - 4^*257) it is found that 
0.726 percent of the area under a normal curve 
is found between -2.32 and -2.11. In other 
words, the probability of finding one case in 
this area is 0.00726. Out of 144 cases the 
probability would be 144 x 0.00726. 

(3) The Chi-square test was then used to describe 
the goodness of fit between the observed value 
and the theoretical calculated value.

The tabulated five percent level of the 
Chi-squared distribution for 22 degrees of freedom 
is 33 . 924 . Since the observed value is below 
33.924, there is no evidence to support the fact 
that the observed distribution is not normal 0

APPENDIX E 

SAMPLE CALCULATION OF THE ANALYSIS OF 
COVARIANCE 

That data used for this calculation will 
be that of the vanned and unvanned grade two groups. 

The preliminary step in the analysis of 
covariance is to calculate the sums, squares, and 
cross-products for the total sample.

*S-j_ in this case totals zero because at least two means 
are needed to determine a regression line for the means 0 
Since there are only two means, there are no other means 
for which sums of squares can be calculated from this 
regression line.
