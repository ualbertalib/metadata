ABSTRACT 


Physico-chemical and biological procedures for 
the assay of progestogens have been reviewed. A procedure 
based on the characteristic proliferation of the oestrone 
primed rabbit endometrium in response to intra-uterine 
implants of progesterone mixed with cholesterol, was 
investigated and found satisfactory for the estimation 
of progestogens in amounts as low as one microgram. 

Various procedures were used to prepare extracts 
from blood samples. A number of these extracts, when tested 
for activity in the rabbit uterus produced proliferation. 
Using a chromatographic extraction procedure, quantitative 
recovery of added progesterone was obtained. 

The threshold doses of oestrone and of ethinyl 
oestradiol required to produce oestrogenic effects in the 
rabbit uterus have been determined for systemic and intra 
uterine administration of these oestrogens. 

The doses of oestrone required to inhibit the 
uterine progestational response to progesterone, for 
various conditions of administration of these two 
hormones were determined. 

Various types of implants containing 
progesterone were tested and none was found more 
satisfactory than implants of progesterone in cholesterol.

in causing endometrial proliferation. Those made from 
0.2 % progesterone in cholesterol produced the greatest 
response with a given dose of progesterone. 

Color reactions of progesterone with salicyl- 
aldehyde and benzoyl chloride were examined. In 
preliminary tests the benzoyl chloride reaction appeared 
satisfactory for estimation of pure progesterone in 
amounts greater than ten micrograms.

NATURE OF THE PROBLEM 


Although several methods have been proposed for 
the estimation of progesterone, for various reasons none 
have been generally accepted. In this thesis work on a 
bioassay, based on the response of the rabbit endometrium 
to the local application of solid progesterone, is reported. 

Since this response is modified by the 
concentration of oestrogen that is present, certain aspects 
of the interaction of progesterone and oestrogen are also 
considered. 

Finally, as an aid to following progesterone 
through the stages of its extraction from blood, certain 
color reactions of progesterone were also investigated, and 


these are reviewed

reduced pressure (10 to 15 cm. of 
mercury). 

The solutions used in the experiments 
outlined in Table 7 consisted of pure 
crystalline progesterone dissolved in 
benzene. Suitable aliquots were then 
taken and washed with alkali. 

The purpose of these solutions of pro¬ 
gressively stronger chloroform concen¬ 
tration was to elute substances less 
strongly adsorbed on the alumina of 
the column than was the progestogen. 

It was concluded from the experiments 
listed in this table that the recovery 
of progestogen, using the chromato¬ 
graphic procedure, did not appear to 
be significantly less than that obtain¬ 
ed using the modified Corner-Alien 
procedure previously described. 

It was realized, however, that of the 
color reactions investigated by Elvidge, 
none was specific for progesterone, or 
even for 4-3 ketosteroids (6) ($) 

(14) (33).

INTRODUCTION 

SCOPE AND POSSIBLE APPLICATIONS OF A 
DETERMINATION FOR PROGESTOGENS 

Our present knowledge of the physiological proper¬ 
ties of the hormone progesterone has been attained without 
the assistance of a satisfactory means for its determination 
in the human bloodstream* It has been shown, for example, 

( 7 ) ( 43 ) that when progesterone is administered, pregnane- 
diol can be recovered from the urine. Also, pregnanediol 
has been demonstrated in the urine during the luteal phase 
of the menstrual cycle { 42 ) ( 45 )» 

In cases where the concentration of substances 
having progestational activity is abnormal, levels of proges- 
togens can only be inferred by the determination of pregnane¬ 
diol, a metabolic product to which progestogens are converted 
or by examination of the endometrium. 

A satisfactory bioassay would permit normal levels 
to be established directly, during the menstrual cycle and 
pregnancy. Further, abnormalities such as Metropathia 
Haemorrhagica in which progesterone is believed to be lack¬ 
ing, could be more specifically diagnosed and more

scientifically treated. Cases of habitual abortion and of 
sterility due to failure of implantation of the fertilized 
ovum could be similarly investigated. 

A progestational substance (probably progesterone) 
has been demonstrated in the blood of pregnant women ( 20 ) 

( 5 ). However, its metabolism is not well known. There is 
evidence that the liver is involved ( 28 ) and the kidney 
( 23 ) ( 25 )♦ 

A satisfactory means of determination would enable 
the fate of the hormone in the body to be established. A 
paper by Hooker and Forbes which appeared in August, 1950, 

( 23 ) does, in fact, make use of their mouse assay to inves¬ 
tigate the renal inactivation of progesterone.

REVIEW OF METHODS USED FOR THE BIOASSAY OF PROGESTOGENS 1 

A* The first systematic test for progestogens was 

described by Corner and Allen ( 9 )♦ In this, an adult doe 
rabbit is mated* If, on examination 1$ hours later, ruptured 
ovarian follicles are found, a piece of uterus is removed for 
control, and the is ov&ri e ctomized'. 

Five daily subcutaneous injections of the extract to 
be tested are then given and the animal is killed on the fifth 
day, 24 hours after the last injection* Parts of the uterine 
cornua are removed, fixed and examined by microscope* 

The test is considered positive if the endometrium 
has attained a degree of progestational proliferation equiva¬ 
lent to that normally attained on the eighth day of pregnancy* 
The authors define 1 rabbit unit of extract as the amount 
required to produce this proliferation* 

The authors state that presumably mature does will 
react whether previously mated or not. However, they recommend 
the above procedure of mating followed by laparotomy to ensure 


X The term "Progestogen" as suggested by Robson in his book 
"Recent Advances in Sex and Reproductive Physiology" will be 
used throughout this thesis to refer to substances having a 
progesterone-like activity* This term is employed in the 
same sense as the words "Oestrogen" and "Androgen". The word 
"Progesterone" refers to the specific chemical substance to 
which are generally ascribed the properties of the hormone of 
the Corpus Luteum.

exactly comparable conditions with regard to the reproductive 
systems of the test animals. They also state that experiments 
using immature rabbits led to very variable results. 

This method for the assay of progestogens is still 
widely used. However, it suffers from the disadvantage that 
at least 750 micrograms of progesterone or its equivalent are 
required to produce a positive response. 

B. McPhail ( 30 ) stated in 1935 that only two definite 

tests existed for the hormone of the corpus luteum. These 
were, "the causation of progestational proliferation of the 
rabbit uterus and the sensitization of the rat, mouse or guinea- 
pig uterus to the deciduomata reaction." He then discussed a 
method for the determination of progestin^ based on the former, 
using immature female rabbits. 

These rabbits were first injected intramuscularly with 
a priming dose of 15 micrograms of oestrone dissolved in oil, 
three doses being spread over six days. Progestin in oil was 
then injected daily for five days and the resulting endometrial 
proliferation compared with a series of standards which he had 
prepared. 

This method showed such individual variation between 
test animals that the author felt it necessary to use groups 
of at least five animals. The sensitivity was of the order of 
0.5 I.U. of progestin (1 I.U. ” 1 mg. progesterone).

mainly progesterone.

This investigation, while of little practical use 
as a method of assay, because of its low sensitivity and 
variability, did provide the following useful information. 

1 # An optimal priming dose of oestrone exists which, 
under the experimental conditions, ranged from 15 micrograms 
to 150 micrograms. 

2. Oestrone administration over a period of 6 days 
resulted in adequate growth of the uterus, while if the treat¬ 
ment was only for 4 days, even large doses were ineffectual. 

3* A given dose of progestin caused the greatest 
reaction when it was administered over periods of 3 or 5 days, 
longer periods giving a lesser degree of proliferation. 

4* A standard scale of progestational proliferation 
was described and illustrated. This scale has been used in 
the present work (see figure 1 ). 

G. In 1939 McGinty et al, also using the immature 

rabbit uterus, investigated the response to direct application 
to the endometrium of solutions of progesterone in oil. (29) 

The animals were first primed by injection of oestrin; 
ft 150 I.U. over 6 days". Then the uterus was prepared by liga¬ 
tion of the upper end of a uterine horn and placement of a 
second loose ligature three to four centimeters below. Next, 

0.1 cc. of lanolin or peanut oil containing the hormone was 
injected into the lumen of the uterus from below the second 
ligature which was pulled tight as the needle was withdrawn. 

The injection was thus retained in a restricted segment of 
uterus between the ligatures. The rabbits were killed ?2 hours

later and sections of the cornua were examined and rated accor¬ 
ding to the McPhail scale* 

The results indicated that amounts as small as 0*125 
to 0*25 micrograms of progesterone would give a proliferation. 
Further, the proliferation was confined to the segment of the 
uterus that was tied off and contained the injected progesterone* 

Although the investigation was apparently carried 
no further by these workers, the possibility of a highly sensi¬ 
tive method of assay was demonstrated. 

Haskins has used the method of McGinty and co-workers 
for the assay of progesterone in the serum of guinea-pigs 
(19 ) and of women ( 20 ). In the latter instance, he obtained 
no reactions stronger than would be produced by the intra¬ 
uterine injection of 0*25 micrograms of progesterone in oil* 

He also found that peanut oil alone, when injected, occasion¬ 
ally resulted in proliferation* 

D. A very sensitive and specific response of the endo¬ 

metrium of the mouse to progesterone is claimed by Hooker and 
Forbes and was made the basis of a bioassay. This response 
consists of hypertrophy of the stromal nuclei following intra¬ 
uterine injection of minute amounts of progesterone in oil* (22) 

In their procedure, the uterus was delivered through 
a mid-ventral incision and two ligatures were placed around 
it, a tight one cranially and a loose one caudally. These 
were held in a jig which effectively served to maintain them 
5 mm. apart. Injection was made between them by means of a

specially designed micrometer syringe which was found to deliver 
regularly 0.6 microliters. After injection, the caudal liga¬ 
ture was tied. Forty-eight hours later the animal was killed 
and the uterus sectioned. The sections were examined under 
a microscope. 

Amounts of progesterone as low as 0.0002 micrograms 
gave a consistently positive reaction. Moreover, testosterone 
and desoxycorticosterone acetate did not elicit the response, 
and the reaction appeared to be independent of the oestrogen 
concentration present. 

Additional experiments established that it was 
necessary to spay the mice at least 16 days prior to proges¬ 
terone implantation, and that the optimal progestational effect 
was evident 4^ hours after implantation. 

The following disadvantages are listed by the 

authors: 

1. A great deal of time and labour is required. 

2. The response is all-or-none, i.e. f it has not 
been possible to demonstrate different degrees of positive 
responses. 

3. It is very difficult to recognize the positive 
nuclear response of the test with certainty. This was further 
borne out by preliminary experiments of Dr. H$hn in which 
neither he nor I were able to identify the injected uteri 
without error. 

Thus, while this method apparently gives excellent 
results in the hands of skilled and experienced workers, it

is too difficult to assess and too tedious for general 
application* 

E. bzarka ( 41 ) published a method of assay of proges- 
togens based on the inhibition of the uterine manifestations 
of oestrus in rabbits and rats. Uterine oestrus was deter¬ 
mined by assessing the degree of distension of the uterus. 

The effect of systemic injection of a standard 
test dose of oestrogen (4*# micrograms) in the spayed rat was 
found to be inhibited by 1.5 milligrams of progesterone. By 
using immature rats the sensitivity of this method was in¬ 
creased so that a minimal dose of $0 micrograms of progesterone 
could be detected. This degree of sensitivity is not suffi¬ 
cient for the estimation of progesterone in human blood. 

F. The response of the ovipositor of a fish, the bitter- 
ling, to progesterone added to its aquarium has been made the 
basis of an entirely different type of bioassay. Duyvene d@ 

Wit ( 13 ) found that when amounts of progesterone as small as 
two micrograms, in solution in propylene glycol were added to 
the aquarium in which a bitterling was kept, the ovipositor 
lengthened. It was shown in a series of papers ( 17 ) ( ig ) 

( 26 ) that this response is elicited by a wide variety of sub¬ 
stances. This response also shows a marked seasonal variation. 
However, because this method is so simple to perform, it may 
yet prove to be useful, provided that the progestogen may first 
be purified. This could perhaps be done by some physico¬ 
chemical procedure such as chromatography.

REVIEW OF PHYSICO-CHEMICAL METHODS FOR THE 
ASSAY OF PROGESTOGENS 


G. A polarographic investigation of a large number of 

steroids was carried out in 1940 by Wolfe, Hershberg and 
Fieser. These authors demonstrated that many A 4 - 3 , keto- 
steroids would give a characteristic wave. These substances 
were suitably treated and then polarographed over the poten¬ 
tial range from -1 to -2 volts^, the span of the waves being 
then measured. (44) 

Three hundred micrograms of progesterone gave a 
span which corresponded to a current of 6.1 microamperes. 
However, when progesterone was first treated with Girard’s 
Reagent T, 500 micrograms gave a current of 13®$ microamperes. 
Thus, the fact that suitable chemical treatment can increase 
the sensitivity is demonstrated. 

These authors showed that the individual concentra¬ 
tions of two polariz^able steroids which had different half¬ 
wave potentials^ could be determined in the same solution and 


^In polarographic determinations, the concentration of the 
substance being determined is found to be proportional to 
the height (span) of the wave. 

^The half-wave potential is a constant for a given substance 
and is used as a qualitative test for such a substance when 
it is known that material having a similar half-wave poten¬ 
tial is absent.

at the same time provided that interfering substances were 
absent* 

Six A 4-3, ketosteroids, having similar physiological 
properties were investigated. This series included progester¬ 
one. It was found that their half-wave potentials all lay 
between -1.5 and -1.6 volts. This means that any one of these 
steroids cannot be determined in a solution in which the 
others may be present. This disadvantage might be overcome 
by means of a suitable chemical or physical procedure to 
remove interfering material. 

In the test, as described by these authors, 50 to 
100 micrograms of progesterone is the smallest amount which 
can be determined. This sensitivity could be improved by 
application of suitable microanalytical technique and by form¬ 
ing a suitable chemical derivative of the progestogen prior 
to examination in the polarograph. Referring to this paper, 
Reynolds and Ginsburg state { 35 ) "fflller, who has used the 
polarographic method in other types of work, believes the 
method could be developed to the point where 0.001 mg. could

H. Reynolds and Ginsburg in 1942 described a determina¬

is measured in a spectrograph and the unknown concentration 
is read from a calibration curve, prepared using crystalline

As a test of this method the authors added proges¬ 
terone to 1 $ samples of 10 cc, of rabbit serum. Each sample 
was then extracted and the progesterone was determined spectro- 
photometrically. Six of these samples contained added oestrogen 
as well as the progesterone, and four samples with no added 
hormone were also determined as blank controls.

This method also exhibits lack of specificity in 
that any ^ 4-3, ketosteroid (which means the presence of the

this region. This class of compound includes testosterone,

I* A paper chromatographic method was reported in 1950 

by Haskins, Sherman and Allen ( 21 ). Progesterone dissolved 
in sesame and cottonseed oils was chromatographed on paper 
strips for 16 hours, using 80 % ethanol as the solvent* The 
paper was then dried, cut into two strips and the progesterone 
located on the narrower of these by means of the blue color 
which resulted on treatment with m-dinitrobenzene and aqueous 
KOH* 

The hormone was then dissolved in ethanol from the 
untreated strip and determined by ultra-violet analysis in a 
Beckman Spectrophotometer* 

The authors stated that testosterone and desoxycorti- 
costerone acetate gave the same color on the paper but did not 
give information concerning the rate of movement of these sub¬ 
stances and did not deal with the individual determinations 
of these substances in the same solution* Only if the rate 
of movement were different could these two steroids presumably 
be separated by this method* 

Less than 5 micrograms of the pure hormones were 
determined by this method* 

J* W* F* Elvidge investigated several color reactions 

of progesterone and published a method for the estimation of 
this hormone in solution in ethyl oleate ( 14 ) * Three of 
the reactions which he investigated are briefly discussed 
here *

( 1 ) The Zimmerraann Reaction, with m-dinitrobenzene 
in alkaline solution. The author used the technique of Callow 
( g ) and found the color weak and inconsistent. He did not, 
apparently, investigate concentrations of progesterone less 
than 250 micrograms per cc. 

This reaction is a general one, commonly used to 
determine 17 -ketosteroids in urine and Elvidge remarks that 
the extinction values at 520 mu of the color produced by pro¬ 
gesterone were less than half that of androsterone (a 17-keto- 
steroid). 

(2) Benzoyl Chloride Method ( 6 )* Progesterone 
gives a green color with this reagent. This reaction was inves¬ 
tigated in the course of the work reported in this thesis and 

is discussed below (page 70 ) 0 

( 3 ) Salicylic Aldehyde Color Reaction (33 )* Elvidge 
finds that this procedure is satisfactory for the estimation 

of pure progesterone dissolved in ethyl oleate. He does not 
report experiments where concentrations of less than 50 micro¬ 
grams per cc. were used nor does he consider in this paper the 
specificity of the reaction in so far as other steroids are 
concerned. 

In general, it appears that in order to adapt any 
of these reactions to the estimation of progesterone in biolo¬ 
gical materials, further investigations will have to be made.

EVALUATION OF PROGESTOGEN ASSAY PROCEDURES 

The procedures reviewed above are listed in Table 
1 and several of the advantages and disadvantages of each 
are compared. In the column headed "Time Required" is an 
estimate by the writer of this thesis of the time required 
to extract a tissue sample and to determine its content of 
progestogen. Bioassays, for example, include time for what- 

s' 

ever histological procedures may be necessary. 

In considering this table, the following points 
may be made: 

1* In order to make use of a procedure for the 
assay of progestogens in blood, it must be possible to detect 
an absolute amount of progesterone of the order of a few 
micrograms. This rules out methods A, B, E and J. Method 
G, in the opinion of the writer, may, on further investiga¬ 
tion, be improved both in specificity and sensitivity to the 
point where it will be practicable for clinical use. 

2. Method D of Hooker and Forbes, although it 
appears to be extremely sensitive and specific for progester¬ 
one itself, has not yet been independently confirmed by other 
workers, although it first appeared in 1947® In preliminary 
trials in this laboratory, it has proven difficult to assess. 

3© Method C of McGinty, while quite sensitive, 




V • ; - ' ' 


t

gives a variable response. This necessitates the use of sev¬ 
eral animals in estimating the progestogen content of an 
unknown sample, and hence requires a larger original sample 
than would otherwise appear to be necessary. Further trials 
by independent workers will be necessary in order to assess 
fully its possibilities, 

4* The physico-chemical procedures G 9 H and I are 
either sufficiently sensitive as presently described, or may 
be improved until the required sensitivity is attained. How¬ 
ever, in using them to determine substances which have the 
physiological actions of progesterone, it is necessary to be 
certain that no substance which produces the same physico¬ 
chemical reaction but is not a progestogen is present in the 
extract being tested. If a procedure existed for the quanti¬ 
tative isolation of progesterone from a blood extract, the 
above requirement would be met. However, no such procedure 
could be discovered in the literature.

REVIEW OF PROCEDURES USED FOR THE EXTRACTION OF 
PROGESTERONE FROM TISSUES 

A. Allen ( 2 ) outlined a procedure which had 

been used successfully in his laboratory for the 
extraction of progesterone from luteal tissue of sows. 

This procedure which has been used as the model for 
our present work, included the following steps: 

1. The tissue (which had been preserved in 95% 
alcohol) was extracted in a Bloor Extractor, using the pre¬ 
serving alcohol as the extracting fluid. After three such 
extractions, the author could not demonstrate progestational 
activity in the residue. 

2. The alcohol was distilled off under reduced 
pressure until a thick sludge remained. This was extracted 
three times with ethyl ether. 

3. This ether solution was concentrated to about 
1/3 its volume and the phospholipids precipitated with four 
volumes of acetone and filtered off. The precipitate was 
dissolved and reprecipitated once, after which no activity 
could be demonstrated in the residue. 

4. The combined filtrates were distilled to a thick 
oil in vacuo. 

5. This oil was dissolved in absolute methanol and 



- 17 - 


water was then added to make the concentration of methanol in 
the final solution 70%. This solution was chilled at -4° and 
a precipitate which consisted of cholesterol and some fats 
was filtered off. This operation was repeated three times. 

6. The residue, after the evaporation of the solvent 
still in the form of a thick oil, was dissolved in ether and 
washed with dilute NaHCO^ to remove fatty acids. (This proce¬ 
dure would also remove oestrogens.) The washings were ex¬ 
tracted with ether after acidification and this ether solution 
was then washed as before and added to the previous extract. 

After concentration of the ether solution of stage 6, 
a thick oily product was recovered from which some crystals 
could sometimes be obtained with further treatment. Since 
the recovery of these crystals was variable and incomplete, 
this further step is not discussed here. The reader is referred 
to the original paper (2). 

In discussing extracts prepared using this procedure, 
Allen stated, "the purified progestin does not produce heat in 

rats unless given in fairly large doses ... even in the 

crude state one rabbit unit of progestin does not contain over 
0.5 to 1 rat unit of estrin." Since oestrogens have been shown 
to be soluble in dilute aqu^eous alkali (34), it may be 
assumed that they would larger be removed by the alkaline 
wash in stage 6. The importance of considering the fate of 
oestrogens in a procedure for the extraction of progestogens 
will be considered in the section of this thesis immediately 
following and dealing with the antagonism of oestrogens and 
progestogens.

B. Further improvement of the extraction procedure of 

Allen has been indicated in a subsequent paper by Allen and 
Goetsch ( 4 ). The authors eliminated several stages which 
involved distillation and precipitation procedures (stages 2 
to 6 of the procedure discussed above). These were replaced 
by the method outlined in the flow-sheet, Figure 2* 

The essential stages of this procedure are as follows 

1. Extraction of the progestogen from the alcohol 
used to preserve the tissue. (This alcohol was also used to 
extract any progestogen which remained in the tissue.) This is 
accomplished by using a continuous counter-current, liquid- 
liquid extraction apparatus, the design of which appears in 
their paper (see (1) in Figure 2 opposite). 

2. When the partially purified material thus ob¬ 
tained is distributed between petroleum ether and 10 % ethanol, 
additional impurities are removed in the ether and the hormone 
remains in the alcohol ((2) in Figure 2 opposite). 

3. At (4) the alcohol containing the progestogen 
and some further impurities is diluted. This alters the dis¬ 
tribution ratio of the progestogen which may now be extracted 
by the ether. Thus, a still greater degree of purification 
may be obtained. 

By making use of suitable micro liquid-liquid extrac¬ 
tion apparatus such as the one designed by Heberling and illus¬ 
trated in a paper by G. H. Morrison (32 ), the above procedure 
could be adapted to be used in the determination of progesto- 
gens in blood.

BEARING OF THE ANTAGONISM OF OESTROGENS AND 
PROGESTERONE ON THE PROBLEM 

The fact that progestogens will cause endometrial 
proliferation was demonstrated by Corner and Allen (9)* These 
authors noted that in mature doe rabbits which had been spayed, 
injection of progestin always produced a typical proliferation 
of the endometrium. However if the rabbits that were used for 
the test were immature, the proliferation was frequently 
absent or poorly defined. It is possible that in the immature 
animals the ovaries had not yet begun to secrete oestrogens, 
and that this fact is responsible, in part at least for the 
refractoriness observed in some of the rabbits. 

McPhail (31) established that the maximal prolif¬ 
eration was obtained when an injection of a progestogen was 
preceded by the injection of an optimal amount of an oestrogen. 
When either more, or less, than this optimal dose was given, 
little or no effect was apparent from an injection of 
progestogen. He published photographs illustrating the action 
of oestrogen alone, and of oestrogen followed by progestin on 
the uterus of the immature rabbit (see page 4). It will be seen 
from photo No. 2 that the administration of oestrogen alone 
does not produce the feathery development of the glands that 
is caused by progestogens. (photos 3 to 6)

Allen demonstrated ( 3 ) that 675 rat units of 
oestrin would completely inhibit the production of a 
typical rabbit endometrial response to three mg. of 
progesterone. However 1000 units did not prevent the 
formation of normal-appearing corpora lutea, i.e. did 
not visibly affect the ovarian changes that result in the 
production of progesterone. Thus oestrin inhibits the 
actions of progesterone on the uterus but does not 
interfere with the formation of progestogens in the 
corpora lutea. 

Courrier ( 10 ) showed that 0.02 mg. of oestrone would 
prevent 1.5 mg. of progesterone from producing this typical 
proliferation of the rabbit endometrium when both were given 
by injection. The ratio of oestrone to progesterone in this 
case was 1:75# 

In similar experiments on rabbits Robson ( 37 ) found 
that 0.75 mg. of progesterone was completely inhibited by 
1/75 its weight of oestrone. He also found that 1/300 its 
weight of oestrone still gave some inhibition. 

Gilman and Stein ( 16 ) confirmed the data of Robson 
ana Courrier but showed that the ratio of 1/75 quoted above 
applied only when the dose of progesterone administered to 
rabbits was near the smallest dose required to elicit a 
complete endometrial response^. Wien they injected & mg. of 
progesterone (approximately ten times the optimum^ - dose ) a 

■^optimum dose of progesterone ■ smallest dose which produces 
complete endometrial proliferation.

much smaller proportion of oestrone was required to inhibit 
its action on the endometrium. In this case an oestrone- 
progesterone ratio of 1:200 gave complete inhibition and 
1:1000 partial. 

Courrier ( 11 ) demonstrated that pregnenolone, 
another progestogen, could be similarly inhibited by oestrone. 

He also showed ( 12 ) that oestradiol applied locally would 
inhibit progesterone given systemically. He dissolved the 
oestrogen in oil and injected it between ligatures into the 
lumen of the rabbit uterus. Moreover he obtained complete 
inhibition of the progestational response when he used an 
oestrogen-progesterone ratio of 1:100. This indicates that 
when oestrogen is applied directly it may be antagonistic 
to progestogen in a dosage smaller than when it is systemically 
administered. 

Thus we find:- 

(1) An optimal priming dose of oestrogen potentiates the 
endometrial response to progestogen. 

(2) If the priming dose of oestrogen is greater, or less than 
this optimal dose, this endometrial response to progestogen 

is reduced. 

(3) The endometrial response to an optimum dose of progesterone 
can be inhibited by 1/75 its weight of oestrone simultaneously 
administered. 

(4) If the dose of progesterone is higher than the optimum a 
smaller proportion of oestrone than 1/75 is required to inhibit 
it. 



















22 - 


(5) It is indicated that oestrogen applied directly to the 
endometrium is more effective in antagonizing the proliferative 
response to progesterone than when it is systemically 
administered. 

When it is desired to assay an unknown sample of 
blood for the progestational action that it might produce, 
the presence of oestrogen must be considered. If the oestrogen 
should be removed during the extraction of the progestogen 
the progestational effect obtained from the blood sample 
would be an erroneous representation of the response which 
might result before the sample was extracted. 

Similarly if it were desired to estimate the 
progestogen content of an unknown sample and oestrogens 
remained in the implants prepared from the sample, false 
results might be obtained unless the level of the oestrogens 
was also taken into account. 

Because of the antagonism described above between 
oestrone and progestogens assays for progestogens using the 
endometrial response of the rabbit were performed on spayed 
animals, previously primed with a standard dose of oestrone.

SECTION II. 


EXPERIMENTAL WORK 

BASIS OF THE RABBIT ENDOMETRIUM ASSAY 


In the clinical application of any progestogen 
assay, it is the estimation of progestational activity of 
substances contained in a blood sample that is of the 
greatest importance. Thus it was considered that the 
primary objective of the present work would be to outline 
a method whereby such activity in blood could be determined 
within reasonable limits. A biological procedure which 
depended upon progestational activity for its end-point 
appeared likely to offer the best prospect for achievement 
of this objective. 

An additional objective which is also of considerable 
importance is the possibility of improving a progestogen assa}' 
so that it wo$ld be specific for progesterone itself. This 
would extend its usefulness in various researches, some of 
which are suggested in the introduction to this thesis. 

This latter aim is complicated by the fact that a 
number of substances have properties similar to those of 
progesterone. This is particularly true when some physical 
or chemical property of this hormone is made the basis of 
an assay. When, however, progestogen determination is based 




2U - 


on the progestational response, the number of known 
substances which can also produce this response is limited 
to a half-dozen or so compounds. Moreover the substances 
which interfere in such a manner with the bioassay are all 
less active in producing endometrial proliferation that is 
progesterone♦ 

McGinty and his associates ( 29) applied progesterone 
directly to the endometrium by injecting it in oil into the 
lumen of the uterus. He kept this oily material localized 
by two ligatures which encircled the uterus proximally and 
distally to the site of injection. 

When injected in this way, less than a microgram 
of progesterone usually gave a proliferation. However this 
response did prove to be somewhat variable so that the test 
had to be repeated in several animals in order to assay an 
unknown sample. 

It was hoped that by inserting progesterone in 
solid form into the lumen of the uterus, the sensitivity of 
the McGinty procedure would be retained while the variability 
would at the same time be reduced. 

Preliminary experiments performed by Dr. Hohut 
indicated that while the implantation of pure crystalline 
progesterone into the rabbit uterus did result in proliferation 
of the endometrium, a fairly large amount of the hormone was 
required. This could be explained by the hypothesis that a 
small amount of pure progesterone implanted into the uterus

is quickly absorbed and metabolized. Thus its presence 
at the cells of the endometrium is too short-lived to 
produce a recognizable response, buch a hypothesis is 
supported by the recent paper of Riegel ( 36 ) dealing with 
the metabolism of Radioprogesterone in mice and rats. 

bhimkin and White ( 40 ) published a method for 
rendering the absorption of hormonal implants slower and 
more uniform. They fused the hormone with cholesterol 
and implanted the resulting pellets. 

It was decided to follow this procedure and in 
view of the microgram quantities of progestogen with which 
it was expected to be dealing a one per-cent mixture of 
the hormone in cholesterol was used. This mixture was 
solid and varying doses were obtained by selecting pieces 
of it containing the appropriate weight of progesterone. 

Procedure JVJature doe rabbits were spayed. They were 
then primed with seven d aily subcutaneous injections of 
ten micrograms of oestrone in olive oil in preparation for 
implantation. 

Under ether anaesthesia the uterus was exposed by 
a ventral mid-line incision. Ligatures were placed as shown 
in Fig.3, those nearest the mid-point of each cornu being 
left loose. Care was taken to insure that at least one 
artery entered the segment between the ligatures.

ovary 



This diagram shows a uterus containing 
four implants. Those in the right horn are 
designated RO and RU, those in the left horn LO 
and LU.

Implants of the test substance were then inserted 
with forceps so as to lie between one or other pair of 
ligatures. Those implants which were too small to handle 
with forceps were placed by first inserting them in a hollow 
tube fitted with a plunger. The tube was then inserted into 
the lumen and the implant extruded into the uterus so that 
the ligature previously left loose could then be drawn tight 
leaving the implant in an isolated segment 8 - 10 mm long. 

Four such implants could usually be inserted in the rabbit 
uterus (Fig.3) and oceasionally as many as seven have been 
placed in the two cornua. 

The animals were killed after the implants had 
remained four days in situ. The implants were then removed, 
dried ana weighed and the uterine segments were fixed in 
formalin overnight. A control segment was removed from an 
unimplanted portion of one of the uterine cornua and 
similarly treated. The next day all these segments were 
serially passed through three changes of acetone, remaining 
thirty minutes in each to dehydrate them. The acetone was 
replaced by benzene which was changed after thirty minutes. 

This cleared the tissues which were next embedded in paraffin 
blocks and cut with a microtome into sections 10 microns thick. 

The resulting slides were stained with haematoxylin 
and eosin and examined under the low power of the microscope. 
The degree of proliferation was then assessed according to 
the McPhail scale. This scale is illustrated in Fig.l.

rated by McPhail as responses of 1 to 4 respectively. 
Intermedidate responses are designated by using the figure i 
(e.g. a response greater than that shown in photo 3 but 
less than that of photo 4 is rated li)o 

The slides of the uterine sections were read 
independently by Dr. Hohn and the author. They were then 
graded by each observer independently. The results were 
compared and it was found that there was invariable 
agreement within a grade of 1 and usually within a grade 
of i, (McPhail scale). Consequently results of experiments 
previously conducted by Dr. Hohn are included in the 
statistical treatment to follow. 

dome of the sections showed the typical proliferative 
response only in parts. This was attributed to the relative 
insolubility of the implants and hence the more localized 
effect of the hormone, buch sections were rated as 0 » i 
or J - 1 etc. depending upon the effect. 

Finally, in some of the sections, some effect from 
the implants was apparent to the experienced eye, although 
we were not prepared to rate the response as 1. To indicate 
this fact the value of J was assigned to these sections. 

However in the statistical treatment of the results all i 
responses were considered as zero. All those in which the 
figure 1 (or a higher number) appeared, e.g. 0 - 1 or J - 1, 
were considered positive.

of 1 % progesterone in cholesterol that were implahted. 

However it was noted that many of the implants of smaller 
size (mainly those which contained less than 5 micrograms 
of progesterone) were not recovered when the uterine segments 
were removed from the animal* 

It was realized that loss of some of these implants 
from their sites of implantation could significantly alter 
the threshold calculated from this data* Therefore it was 
decided to compare the threshold calculated from only those 
experiments in which the implant residues were recovered, 
with that obtained from all of the data* 

Table 3 lists only those experiments in which 
the implant residues were recovered* 

The results expressed in these two tables were 
submitted to statistical analysis using the method of 
Litchfield ana Wilcoxon ( 27 ), for the approximate evaluation 
of dose-effect experiments. The calculations are presented 
briefly below but the reader is referred to the original 
paper for a detailed explanation of each step and for the 
nomographs used to obtain some of the figures. 

The doses of progesterone were plotted against 
the percentage of positive responses obtained, using 
Logarithmic-Probability paper. The straight line which 
appears to be the best fit is drawn in. Figures 4 and 5 show 
the graphs obtained from the data in Tables 2 and 3* From 
these graphs the expected percentage of positives is read 
and the contributions to (chi)^ of each point that was 
experimentally obtained, are listed. To obtain these values

Thus we may say, with a 95% probability of being

response in 50% of the animals implanted lies between 1.17 
and 2.33 micrograms. These values were obtained by 
considering all of the progesterone doses implanted in the 
test animals. 

When only the implanted doses from which residues 
were recovered, were considered, the confidence limits were 
0.57 and 2.75 micrograms. The uncertainty is greater 
because these figures were based on fewer data. The 
calculated E.D.^ is 1.25 micrograms in this latter case as 
compared with 1.65 micrograms for the former.

above are illustrated in Fig. 6. The photomicrographs show:

In assessing these results, it must be realized 
that the sources of variability are multiple. In addition 
to the technical errors inherent in the procedure of 
implantation as described above, there is also varying 
individual sensitivity to progestogens, including occasional 
refractoriness. It is not considered however, that variation 
in the individual response to the priming dose of oestrogen 
is significant in the final evaluation of uterine sections. 
This is so because the priming oestrogen causes the uterus 
of the test animal to become greatly enlarged and hyperaemic. 
This condition is easily recognized and no animal in which it 
was not fully developed at the time of implanting would be 
used to assay an unknown sample. 

Errors due to individual variation in sensitivity to 
progestogens may be minimized by using the procedure suggested 
below for the assay of unknown samples. Essentially this 
consists of placing implants of known progestogen content in 
the uterus of the same animal used to assay the unknown 
material. It has been noted by the author that variation 
between various segments in different parts of the same uterus 
is slight, although no experiments designed to test this point 
have been performed. 







- 33 - 


Suggested Procedure for Samples Containing Unknown Quantities 

of Progestogen 

Into one uterine horn are placed two implants of a Vfo 
mixture of progesterone in cholesterol, weighing 0.2 and 1 mg. 
respectively. These can be weighed accurately and rapidly 
on a torsion microbalance. 

Two suitable implants are prepared from the unknown 
extract or mixture, their weights being in the approximate 
ratio of 1:10. These are placed in the other horn. The rabbit 
is then treated exactly as were those used to obtain the 
dose-response curve. The resulting sections are then 
interpreted in the light of the known control implants in the 
same animal. 

The use of two doses of each of the known and unknown 
mixtures permits a more accurate estimation of the progestogen 
content, based on the degree of proliferation. 

Since this assay is based on the response to a 
progestogen that is mixed with cholesterol, it is necessary to 
add cholesterol to an unknown extract in order to reproduce 
the experimental conditions that apply to the control segments. 
An arbitrary amount is usually added although the source of the 
material may furnish a clue to the progestogen level and 
hence to the cholesterol required. Should the assay indicate 
results greatly different from this level, a second 
determination will have to be performed, adjusting the amount of 
cholesterol added.

EXPERIMENTS DEALING WITH THE EXTRACTION 
OF PROGESTOGENS FROM TISSUES 

Most of the procedures used for the extraction 
of progestogens that have been reported, are modifications 
of the one used by Allen ( 1 ) in his original work on the 
hormone of the Corpus Luteum. 

It was realized that an extraction procedure which 
was to precede an assay for progestogens would have 
requirements differing from those of Allen in the following 
respects:- 

Allen was attempting to isolate a highly purified 
single chemical substance, or group of substances, in order 
to establish their identity and further properties* He had 
available large amounts of tissue with which to work. 

Moreover he could accept large and variable losses of hormone 
in order to obtain further purification. 

In a bioassay, on the other hand, the size of the 
sample would be limited. If the assay were to be used 
clinically, for example, a blood sample would be limited to 
approximately ten cubic centimeters. The recovery of 
progestogens from this sample must either be complete, or 
predictable, so that a factor may be applied to correct for 
losses. Furthermore the procedure used should not be 
excessively long or tedious. A complex procedure would be 













- 35 - 


likely to introduce errors greater than errors due to 

impurities which remained in the extract. 

A. Experiments Using Modifications of the Corner-Alien 
Procedure for Progestogen Extraction 

Preliminary experiments v/ere performed using the 

following procedure 

1. The tissue, in a finely divided state was extracted 
in a Soxhlet apparatus with 95 % alcohol. 

2. The alcohol was distilled off, stopping the process 
at the point where only a thick sludge remained. 

3. This oily sludge was extracted three times with 
ethyl ether, the three portions of the solvent being 
combined and concentrated to one-third their volume. 

4* The phospholipids were precipitated with 4 volumes 

of acetone. 

5* This precipitate was dissolved and reprecipitated 

once more with acetone. 

6. The filtrates from stages 4 and 3 were combined 
and the solvent distilled off, leaving an oily 
residue. 

7. This residue was redissolved in ether and washed 
with a saturated NaHCG^ solution. 

The washings were made acid with HC1 and extracted 
with ether. 

9o The ether from stage & was again washed with saturated 

NaHCO^ solution and combined with that from stage 7 * 





. i. 













- 36 - 


10. Cholesterol was added. (99 times the estimated 

progesterone content of the sample to make a 1 % 
mixture.) The ether was then evaporated off and 
the waxy residue scraped together to make several 
implants of varying size. 

Where this procedure is modified in preparing the 
extracts tabulated below this is indicated and details of 
the modified procedure are listed. 

A number of extractions were carried out by 
Dr. Hohn before the author began work on this problem 
and the results from these are included in the following 
tables. Such experiments are marked in the tables by 
placing the sign (#) before the number of the rabbit in 
which the extract was implanted, (e.g. § A 64 ).

Extracts Prepared from Tissues to which Progesterone 

Has Been Added 

The results of these experiments are shown in 
Table 6. The various extracts used will be referred to by 
the respective numbers of the rabbits in which they were 
implanted. Extracts A67 and A73 were carried only to stage 3, 
at which point cholesterol was added and implants made. No 
explanation can be offered for the complete lack of 
progestational activity that was exhibited by them other than 
that of inexperience in extraction procedures. 

Extract A74 was boiled with dilute alcoholic alkali, 

(4 drops of saturated NaOH to 6 cc. of 50% ethanol.) after 
completing stage 3 of the extraction procedure. The solution 
was then cooled, shaken with benzene and the implant made by 
adding cholesterol to the benzene fraction which was then 
evaporated. Allen suggests ( 2 ) that the treatment with 
alkali would lead to some loss of progesterone and it is 
perhaps significant that only a proliferation of 2 was 
obtained from this implant. 

Extract A93 was extracted with alcohol only and 175 
with a 3:1 mixture of alcohol and ether. Both of these extracts 
yielded implants that were oily and difficult to handle and in 
both the results indicate that the distribution of 
progestational activity was irregular.

Experiments Dealing With the Alkali Treatment 

of Progesterone Extracts 

In order to obtain more information on the effect

The experiments demonstrate that alkali washing as 
in the method of Allen (see page 35 ) does not completely 
destroy progesterone. Nevertheless even if half of the 
progesterone originally present were inactivated, it would 
still have been possible to obtain a response of 4 from the 
remainder.

made from these extracts, no proliferation could be detected. 
This result would be obtained if the oestrogens which would 
also be extracted from the ovaries were in a concentration 
sufficient to inhibit the progestogens present. 

Extractions of Blood Samples from Human Male Subjects 

Several samples of blood from human male subjects, 
which it was considered were not likely to contain progesterone 
were extracted and tested in the rabbit uterus for 
progestational activity. The results are indicated in Table &. 

It will be seen from this table that large volumes 
of male blood appear to contain a small amount of progestogen. 

Extractions of Blood from a Human Female Subject 

(B.C.H.) 

All the extracts listed in Table 9 were prepared 
using the procedure on page 

The proliferative response to all these extracts, 
with the exception of A33 and A 64 was weak. This could result 
from the following circumstances 

(i) Progestogen is lost or destroyed in the extraction 
procedure. In view of the results expressed above 
in Table 6 this is not considered likely. 

(ii) Progestogen is in low concentration in the blood 
sample extracted. This is considered likely and is 
discussed more fully on page $ 3 . 

(iii) A substance antagonistic to the proliferative 
response of progestogens is present in the extract 
(see page 21 ).

Extractions of Various Blood Samples Expected to 

Contain Progesterone 

In preparing this series of extracts, a revised 
procedure was attempted in the hope of simplification of the 
method of Allen. Also it was hoped to avoid the troublesome 
emulsions that were encountered at various stages of previous 
extractions that were performed. 

Procedure 

1. The plasma from a centrifuged blood sample was 
measured and added dropwise to 100 cc. of a 
mixture of 3 parts alcohol to 1 part ether. The 
whole was then heated to boiling, cooled and 
filtered. 

2. The solvent was then distilled off under reduced 
pressure from the filtrate from stage 1. 

3• The residue was shaken with benzene in the flask 

where it remained after stage 2. 

4o This benzene solution was washed with N/20 NaOH 

to removed fatty acids, and then with water. 

5. The solvent was distilled off and the residue 

weighed. It was then dissolved in ether, cholesterol 
was added and implants made as in the previous 
extraction procedure (page 36 ).

Table 10 lists the experiments that were performed 
using this modified extraction procedure. In extract C6l, 
stage 1. only of the revised extraction procedure was 
carried out. Cholesterol was added and the solvent distilled 
off, leaving an oily residue from which implants were made. 

The second implant in this animal (C6l) consisted of 5 to 10 
milligrams of the residue that remained after the plasma was 
extracted and filtered. 

It was found in all the experiments listed in 
Table 10 that this revised procedure gave residues which 
were very oily. This made it very difficult to make implants 
which bore a quantitative relationship to the tissue extracted. 
Moreover it was not possible to insert these implants into the 
lumen of the uterus without loss.

B. Chromatographic Procedure for the Extraction of Progesto- 

gens from Blood 

A paper dealing with the extraction of testosterone 
and related steroids from various tissues was published by 
L. T. Samuels in 1947 ( 39 )• These steroid substances, one 
of which was progesterone, had been incubated with the tissue, 
(the nature of which was not stated in the paper). The 
procedure which he used appeared to result in a comparatively 
pure extract. Moreover, it appeared simpler than methods 
reported in the preceding section of this thesis. 

Procedure 

A measured amount of plasma from 10 cc. of centri¬ 
fuged blood is added to approximately 20 cc. of distilled 
water in a 30 ml. erlenmeyer flask. The resulting diluted 
plasma is boiled under reflux for 20 minutes to one-half an 
hour using the apparatus illustrated in Fig. 6, and the flask 
is then cooled. Approximately 15 cc. ether is added and the 
flask containing boiled plasma, precipitated protein and 
ether is stoppered. Flask and contents are then shaken and 
the ether layer is allowed to settle out. Should an emulsion 
form, as is frequently the case, it is readily broken by 
placing the stoppered flask in a 250 ml. brass centrifuge 
cup and spinning the whole at 2,000 r.p.m. The centrifuge 
cups used had a rubber pad in the bottom, and as a further 
safeguard against breakage, about 50 cc. of water were added 
to each cup.

The ether layer was removed into a glass-stoppered 
flask by suction and the whole ether extraction procedure was 
repeated four times. It was usually found that centrifugation, 
if necessary at all, was required only on the first extraction. 

The combined ethers from the previous extractions 
were concentrated by distillation through the condenser that 
had previously been used when heating under reflux (Fig. 6). 

Any residue then remaining in the flask was dried by heating 
on a boiling water bath under the vacuum from a water aspira¬ 
tor. Petroleum ether (20 cc.) was then added and allowed to 
stand in the flask for a minimum of four hours ar room temp¬ 
erature. In order to ensure that the contents were dissolved 
in the petroleum ether, the flask was carefully shaken several 
times during this interval. 

A column was prepared as illustrated in Fig. 7 and 
packed to a depth of 5 cm. with Alumina (Alcoa Activated 
Alumina). A plug of glass wool was placed at either end of 
the column as shown in the diagram. 

Through this, the following solutions were passed 
in the order indicated 

(1) 10 cc. petroleum ether 

(2) The 20 cc. portion of petroleum ether contain¬ 
ing the substance under investigation 

(3) 30 cc. petroleum ether 

(4) 15 cc. of a 10% solution of chloroform in 
petroleum ether

bamuels stated that the hormone was usually found 
in fraction 5* This was confirmed in an experiment discussed 
in the section of this thesis dealing with colorimetric work* 

Fraction 5 was then distilled to dryness using the 
apparatus previously described. The residue was then dissol¬ 
ved in ether or alcohol, cholesterol added and the whole 
washed with further solvent into weighed 10 ml. beakers. 

The solvent was then evaporated, using a heat lamp from above 
the beaker. This procedure effectively served to prevent 
creeping of the ether over the lip of the beaker. 

A waxy residue remained and this was scraped toge¬ 
ther using a micro spatula. This was made from a steel knit¬ 
ting needle, ground flat and retempered. It was found that 
two implants totalling 1.7 to l.$ mg. in weight could be 
scraped from a residue weighing 2.5 to 2 mg. 

The procedure described above was used by the author 
in more than 30 extractions. It was noted during the first 
few of these that the ether layer could not be removed com¬ 
pletely without at the same time sucking over some of the sub¬ 
stratum. Therefore, in order to reduce the area of contact 
between the two layers and thus obtain a more complete separa¬ 
tion of the ether-contained hormone, an attempt was made to 
carry out the precipitation and ether extraction stages in 
glass-stoppered test tubes. Five cc. portions of plasma were

placed in test tubes and heated in a boiling water bath for 
periods up to one hour. The tubes were then cooled, ether 
was added and the contents shaken. 

This procedure resulted in the formation of a 
stable emulsion in every case. In one sample that was centri¬ 
fuged at 2,500 r.p.m. for an hour, the resulting clear ether 
layer amounted to only a small fraction of the total volume 
originally added. 

Two samples of plasma were similarly diluted and 
the proteins precipitated with sodium tungstate. Again, 
ether extraction gave a stable emulsion. 

In all subsequent extractions therefore, the pro¬ 
cedure outlined above, in which plasma was boiled under 
reflux after dilution, was used. 

Table 11 lists the results obtained in several 
experiments in which samples of plasma were extracted and the 
extracts submitted to assay in the rabbit uterus. The results 
of these few experiments are similar to those obtained using 
other extraction procedures and quoted above. 

It should be noted that the extracts implanted into 
rabbits 1142 and 1150 were prepared from blood samples from 
weakly pseudopregnant rabbits. That is to say, on laparotomy 
prior to taking the blood sample, only a few small corpora 
lutea were found to be present in the ovaries of these rabbits. 
This fact probably accounts for the low levels of progestogen 
indicated by the uterine response.

EFFECT OF CONCENTRATIONS OF PROGESTERONE OTHER THAN 
ONE PERCENT IN IMPLANTED MIXTURES WITH CHOLESTEROL 

Prior to my beginning this work, Dr. Hdhn had 
begun experiments using 1% mixtures of progesterone 
and cholesterol. In several experiments which he 
performed using 0.2% and 5% concentrations of 
progesterone in cholesterol, neither mixture appeared 
to be more effective in producing the progestational 
response than was the 1% concentration previously used. 

Therefore the problem was continued using this 
concentration, realizing however, that some time later 
the final conclusions might have to be modified ana 
some of the work, dealing with the dose-response curve, 
repeated. 

When, however, an assay procedure was drawn up 
it became apparent that the concentration of progesterone 
in an unknown mixture could only by accident be 1% with 
respect to the cholesterol which was added to this mixture. 

This made it necessary to investigate the progestational 
effectiveness of various concentrations of progesterone 
in cholesterol which contained a given dose of progesterone 
just above the threshold dose. 

Two groups of rabbits were implanted so that all 
of the rabbits in the group received the same dose of 
progesterone. Each animal in the group was given three implants,

having a different concentration of progesterone in each 
of them. This means in effect that a relatively large 
implant was required to hold the test doses of progesterone 
in 0.2% mixture, while a smaller implant held the same doses 
in 5% mixture. Tables 12 and 13 list these experiments and 
their results. 

Although only five animals were implanted, the 
results obtained from them were consistent. It appears that 
there is a difference between the effect produced by the 
three concentrations. The 5% mixture is less, and the 0.2% 
more, effective than the 1% mixture in the production of 
progestational proliferation. 

These results were unexpected. It had been found 
that whenever pellets of 1% progesterone in cholesterol were 
implanted, they lost approximately 15% of their weight during 
the four days that they remained in the uterus. It was then 
assumed that this loss of weight represented solution of the 
outer layer of the implant in the uterine fluids. To support 
this conclusion was the fact that the implants recovered 
from the uterus after remaining four days in situ still 
retained their original shape, although sharp edges present 
at implantation could be observed to have become somewhat 
rounded. This would mean that in segments containing the 
more concentrated mixtures, the endometrium would be exposed 
to a higher concentration of progesterone during the four days 
that the implant was present. This in turn would be expected 




- 4$ - 


to result in a greater degree of proliferation in the case 
of the more concentrated implants. 

Since this was not found to be the case it is 
possible that by some means all, or most of the progesterone 
in the more concentrated implants was dissolved out early in the 
period that the implant remained in the uterus. This would 
result in the endometrium being subjected to an adequate 
concentration of progesterone for a time, but the exposure to 
progesterone was of too short duration to cause a proliferation. 
With larger implants of a weaker concentration, release of 
progesterone from the cholesterol would be slower and more 
prolonged, allowing proliferation to occur. In support of 
this concept is the fact, as previously noted, that implants 
of pure progesterone were ineffectual, presumably due to 
its rapid destruction. 

Experiments designed to clear up this point are 
planned. Implants which have produced a given effect in one 
animal will be transplanted into the uterus of a second 
rabbit and if necessary a third, to determine how much 
progestational activity remains in implants of various sizes. 

The degree of activity in each rabbit will be compared in 
each case, and in the same uterus with fresh unused samples 
of the same mixture. Also implants will be left in situ for 
various periods up to ten days or so, and observation made 
of the time at which the progestational response begins to 
subside. If the explanation given above is correct, large

implants of weak progesterone concentration should show 
a prolonged effect, and small implants of stronger 
concentration a response of shorter duration. 

The results in table 13 are so striking that 
additional experiments should be performed in order to 
determine the concentration of progesterone in mixtures 
with cholesterol which will give the smallest threshold 
dose. From the two experiments in this table it would 
appear that this optimum progesterone concentration is 
significantly below the 1 °Jo level.

TRIAL BLIND ASSAYS OF PLASMA SAMPLES 
WITH ADDED PROGESTERONE 

As a test of the procedure proposed above for 
the assay of progestogen, the following experiments were 
carried out. 

Eleven 50 ml. flasks were lettered and into nine 
of them were placed accurately measured aliquots of a 
solution of progesterone in alcohol. This was done by the 
author, selecting the lettered flask for each aliquot by lot. 
A record was kept as to which flask contained the various 
progesterone doses used. Dr. Hohn then placed five cc. 
plasma samples in four of these flasks which he selected 
by lot and replaced the letters by numbers 1,2,3,4* His 
record of the correlation between letters and numbers was 
then sealed and was not opened until the tests were 
completed. Thus neither of us knew the progesterone 
content of the plasma samples except that the values lay 
between 0 and 40 micrograms. 

These four samples were then extracted using the 
chromatographic procedure outlined above and to each of 
the four extracts so obtained, two milligrams of cholesterol 

was added. Implants were made from the residue and assayed 
in the rabbit uterus along with implants containing known 
amounts of progesterone with results as indicated below.

In the first three examples the recovery- 
indicated is quite good. In assay IV, the difference 
between estimated progestogen content and actual 
progestogen content is so great as to be possibly due 
to some gross error in adding progesterone to the sample 
or in the extraction procedure. 


In considering the blood levels of progesterone 
that might be expected in unknown samples, the following 
factors indicate that these levels might usually be low: 

(1) Haskins (20), using the McG-inty procedure, was not 
iable to obtain a strong response from extracts of the 
blood, of pregnant women. 

| (2) Hooker and Forbes have placed the maximum solubility 
of progesterone in plasma at £ micrograms per cc. ( 23 ) 

(3) Riegel (36) found that when radioprogesterone was 
:administered to rats it was rapidly metabolized and re- 
;moved from the blood. 

! (4) In experiments tabulated on pp. 39 and 45, also in 
one experiment not reported, in which an extract of pregnancy 
plasma was implanted in oil contained in a gelatine capsule, 
the degree of proliferation observed was usually slight.

EXPERIMENTS WITH OTHER TYPES OF IMPLANTS 

During earlier extraction experiments, the 
progestogen containing residues were usually obtained 
in the form of a viscous oil* Tfhis was very difficult 
to handle and on implanting these residues, losses 
occurred. Freezing them did not satisfactorily solve 
this problem since they would quickly thaw as they were 
being inserted into the uterine lumen. 

Therefore, attempts were made to find some other 
means of implanting progestogens which would not result in 
a significant decrease in sensitivity of a bioassay based 
thereon. 

A,. Filter Paper Implants 

Solutions of progesterone, and of progesterone 
and cholesterol in a 1:99 ratio were evaporated on 
rectangular pieces of filter paper of varying size. The 
solvent used was ether or alcohol. These paper rectangles 
were then cut into small portions containing a suitable 
weight of progesterone, and were rolled up and implanted 
into the uteri of primed rabbits. An unimplanted portion 
of the uterus of each implanted rabbit served as a control. 
Table 14 shows the proliferative response obtained from the 
implanted rabbits, it appeared that implants prepared in 
this way were not more effective, and probably less so in

B. Implanted Micro-chromatographic Columns Containing 

Progesterone 

Small glass tubes, about 60 mm. in length and 
having a bore of two to three mm. were packed with alumina 
(Alcoa Activated Alumina) to a depth of one cm. These tubes 
had an enlarged upper end which served as a funnel when adding 
liquids. Solutions containing progesterone were poured 
through, and the entire contents of the tube were then 
extruded into the lumen of the uterus of a primed rabbit. 

These implants were then treated exactly as were the implants 
of one percent progesterone in cholesterol discussed in the 
previous sections of this thesis. Table 15 shows that the 
only positive response obtained from these implants was that 
due to a very large dose of progesterone. 

Since neither of these procedures appeared to offer 
greater sensitivity than that using 1% progesterone in 
cholesterol, and because of the technical difficulties 
encountered in quantitatively transferring the progesterone 
solution to the filter paper without loss work was discontinued 
on this type of implant. It is possible, however that a 
suitable absorbent might be found which in combination with a 
suitable technique would enable implants of this type to be 
used.

0. Implants in Gelatin Capsules 

It is possible using micropipettes of the type 
described by Paul L. Kirk ( 24 ) to measure accurately 
quantities of liquid between lAand lOOAin volume.*^ In 
preliminary trials using a 70 a pipette, solutions of 
progesterone and cholesterol (in a ratio of 1:99 by 
weight) in alcohol were placed in open gelatine capsules 
having a volume of 100A and evaporated to dryness♦ The 
evaporation was carried out by placing the filled capsule 
in a vacuum dessicator at 25 to 30°C for one half to one 
hour, and it was found that the solvent was completely 
removed by this procedure without apparently creeping 
over the top of the capsule. 

Capsules were prepared containing appropriate 
amounts of progesterone and cholesterol and were implanted 
into primed rabbits. One end of the capsule was left open. 
Table 16 shows the endometrial proliferation induced by 
them. The implants in animals 951 and 1295 were made from 
the same mixture of 1% progesterone in cholesterol. Those 
in the capsules were weighed out in the same manner and at 
the same time as the control implants. They were then 
placed in the respective capsules and dissolved in a drop 
of ethanol which was removed by evaporation. In the last 
two animals the implanted capsules were prepared by 
evaporating in them aliquots of a solution of progesterone 
and cholesterol in ethanol. This solution was made from

measurement of small amounts of liquids. (1000 = 1 ml.)

pure crystalline progesterone and pure cholesterol, 
dissolved in a 1:99 ratio as in previous experiments. 

The responses observed cannot be considered as 
completely satisfactory, since the relatively high doses 
of progesterone produced no higher response than two. 
However it appears that the threshold is but little 
changed if at all, in comparison with that obtained with 
1 % in cholesterol implants. 

Since this method offers a means whereby implants 
may be easily prepared and handled, and in view of the 
results from the four experiments quoted above, it is 
considered that further studies of this type of implant 
are warranted. 

Two animals were also implanted with capsules 
containing progesterone dissolved in peanut oil. McGinty 
had shown ( 29 ) that when dissolved in peanut oil, 
progesterone injected into the primed rabbit uterus was 
capable of producing endometrial proliferation in very 
low doses. The results obtained were inconclusive and 
do not warrant comment. Further experiments of this 
nature are planned.

EXPERIMENTS DEALING WITH THE ANTAGONISM BETWEEN 
OESTROGENS AND PROGESTOGENS 

It has been pointed out above (page 22 ) that the 
possible presence of antagonists must be considered in any 
assay for progestogens using the endometrial response of the 
rabbit as its basis. In the introduction to this thesis, it 
has been shown that oestrogens are antagonistic to proges¬ 
terone insofar as its progestational activity is concerned. 
Moreover, it was found that the dose of oestrogen required 
to inhibit completely the progestational response when both 
of these substances were given together, was in the neighbor¬ 
hood of 1/75 the weight of the progesterone injected. 

The work reported below was carried out in order 
to evaluate better the effect of oestrogens which might be 
present in implants containing progestogen and applied local¬ 
ly to the rabbit uterus. 

The antagonism between oestrone and progesterone was 
accordingly investigated under the following conditions of 
administration of the two hormones: 

(1) Oestrone implanted into the uterus and proges¬ 
terone injected subcutaneously. 

(2) Oestrone and progesterone both implanted into 


the uterus 









- 59 - 


(3) Oestrone injected subcutaneously and proges¬ 
terone implanted into the uterus. 

As will be shown below, inhibition of the progesta¬ 
tional response could be produced in all three sets of condi¬ 
tions. This pointed to the endometrium as the site of the 
antagonism between oestrone and progesterone. 

The quantitative aspects of this inhibition were 
studied by performing a series of experiments for each set 
of conditions, to determine the progesterone/oestrone ratio 
for inhibition, i.e., the minimal quantity of oestrone re¬ 
quired to inhibit the effect of a given quantity of proges¬ 
terone. 

As a general rule, the minimal dose of a hormone 
that is required to produce an effect is less when the hor¬ 
mone is applied directly to the tissue involved in that effect, 
than when the same hormone is administered systemically. 

This is true for the progestational response of the primed 
rabbit endometrium. It has been shown (page 27 ) that approxi¬ 
mately 2 micrograms of progesterone (given as a 1% mixture 
in cholesterol) will produce a proliferative response in 50% 
of the animals receiving that dose. The corresponding 
systemic dose may be taken as about 500 micrograms, giving a 
local/systemic dose ratio ;of 1/250. Emmens ( 15 ) reports 

a similar situation with respect to the action of oestrone 
in the vaginal response in the mouse. Median effective doses 
for local and systemic administration were 0.00029 micrograms 
and 0.075 micrograms, a local/systemic ratio of l/260 o 




- 60 - 


These facts led to the expectation that in the 
present antagonism experiments the response to a given dose of 
progesterone could be inhibited by a much smaller dose of 
oestrone, when that oestrone was applied to the uterus, than 
when injected subcutaneously. It soon became clear, however, 
that this was not the case and that similar amounts of 
oestrone were required under both conditions of administra¬ 
tion, i.e., the difference between the local and systemic 
effective doses for antagonism, in this case, was relatively 
slight. This raised the possibility that in the rabbit uterus 
the local and systemic effective doses for oestrogenic effect 
of oestrone were not very different. Experiments to deter¬ 
mine these doses were therefore performed. They showed that 
under the conditions used, the local and systemic doses were, 
in fact, close together. Since this result was somewhat 
unexpected, it was felt desirable to determine the local and 
systemic dose on the same preparation of another true oestro¬ 
gen. Ethinyl oestradiol was used for this purpose. 

A. The Effective Dose of Systemic Oestrone on the Babbit f s 

Endometrium 

Mature, non-pregnant rabbits were ovariectomized 
and left for four weeks to allow considerable atrophy of the 
uterus to occur. A segment of uterus to serve as a control 
was then removed and fixed. Oestrone in olive oil, 1 micro¬ 
gram per cc. was then injected subcutaneously twice daily for

four days, in the amounts required to produce the total doses 
indicated in Table 17. The animal was then killed and a seg¬ 
ment of the uterus was fixed and sections from it were made. 

The changes of the histological appearance in the 
rabbit endometrium produced by oestrogen do not appear to 
have been studied in any detail previously. Three endometrial 
effects were found on comparison with the control segments 
showing the atrophic endometrium. 

(1) Increase in size and number of blood vessels 

(2) A considerable increase in the thickness of 
the endometrium associated with a greater 
separation of the stromal nuclei from one 
another. Both these appearances are presum¬ 
ably due to oedema of the endometrial stroma 

(3) An increase in glands in the most superficial 
layer as well as the appearance of glands in 
the deeper layers of endometrium where they 
are entirely absent in the atrophic endometrium 
(Figure 3). 

In the various tables below, oestrogenic effects 
are indicated as - * for a minimal and t or + + for more 
marked effects. As indicated in Table 17, the minimal effec¬ 
tive dose is about 2 micrograms. 

The difference between the effects from doses of 2 
and 1 micrograms was quite clear-cut. It is of interest that 
the minimal dose for endometrial effects in mature rabbits is 
in agreement with a minimal dose of about 1 microgram of 





- 62 - 


oestrone which was reported to produce definite increase of 
uterine weight in immature rabbits by M. K. McPhail (31 ). 

B. The Effective Dose of Intra Uterine Oestrone on the Rabbit f s 

Endometrium 

Implants of 1 °/o oestrone in cholesterol were prepared 
by dissolving oestrone and cholesterol in ether, evaporating 
the solvent and fusing the residue. The oestrone content of 
these mixtures was checked by testing their effect on vaginal 
smears of ovariectomized mice, after subcutaneous injection. 

Rabbits ovariectomized four weeks previously recei¬ 
ved intra uterine implants of these mixtures in the manner 
already described (page 26 ). A control segment (Cl) was 
removed at the time of implantation. Four days later the 
animal was killed and a second control segment (G 2) as well 
as the implanted segments were removed. Sections from these 
various segments were prepared. 

The evaluation of responses to intra uterine im¬ 
plants was more difficult than that of responses following 
systemic oestrogen administration. Endometrial thickening 
and separation of stromal nuclei was found to some degree in 
ligated uterine segments from rabbits which had not received 
any oestrogen and can, therefore, be produced by mechanical 
interference alone. It was also found difficult to produce 
strictly localized oestrogenic effects. If the total weight 
of implanted oestrone was well above 1 microgram, gland devel¬ 
opment was often increased in the C 2 control segment nearly

as much as in the implanted segments. This was attributed to 
the effect of circulating oestrone absorbed from the implants 
However, it was found that doses of oestrone of 1 and 2 micro 
grams produced a distinct thickening of the layer of epithe¬ 
lial cells lining the inside of the endometrium. In spite of 
these difficulties of interpretation, it can be concluded 
from the results shown in Table IS that the minimal local 
dose is \ to 1 micrograms, giving a local to systemic dose 
ratio :of only \ to This finding raised the possibility 
that extremely little oestrone was, in fact, absorbed from 
the implants and experiments were performed to investigate 
this possibility. 

Two groups of fifteen implants, each weighing 0.2 
mg. were prepared from a 1 % mixture of oestrone and choles¬ 
terol. The total weights of the implants in these groups 
were 3o0 and 3*1 nig. respectively. Thus, each implant con¬ 
tained two micrograms of oestrone. The fifteen implants in 
one of these groups were placed in separate uterine segments 
(using a total of three rabbits) and left for four days. At 
the end of this period, thirteen of the implants were recov¬ 
ered. This group and the original group were then forwa.rded 
by Dr. Hohn to Dr. Robson for the assay of oestrogen content. 
The results of this assay are not as yet available. 

The final column in Table IS gives the percentage 
gain or loss of weight that was found when the weights of the 
recovered implants were compared with the original weight 
before implantation. Blanks in this column signify that the

implant was not recovered when the uterine sections were removed. 
Because of the large variations, no significant conclusions 
can be drawn from these weight changes. However, the fact 
that a particular implant was recovered establishes its pre¬ 
sence in the uterine segment and renders any responses obtained 
from that implant more significant. 

C. The Effective Dose of Systemic and Intra Uterine Ethinyl 

Oestradiol 

Because the systemic and local effective doses for 
oestrone were found to be so similar, another oestrogen, 

Ethinyl oestradiol was also investigated. Experiments exactly 
as those described above for oestrone were carried out with 
ethinyl oestradiol. The results are given in Tables 19 and 
20. It will be seen that the minimal systemic dose is about 
one microgram. With intra uterine implants, oestrogenic res¬ 
ponses are sometimes observed in the non implanted segments 
as was noted with oestrone. The minimal local dose is of the 
order of \ microgram, giving a local/systemic dose ratio of 
1:2. This is similar to the findings with oestrone and sug¬ 
gests that a low local/systemic dose ratio for effects on the 
rabbit T s endometrium apply to oestrogens in general.

D. Inhibition of the Progestational Reaction by Oestrone 

Under Varying Conditions of Oestrone and Progesterone 

Administration 


Technique 

All the experiments were conducted on the same gen¬ 
eral plan as those to determine the dose-response curve of 
progesterone. Spayed female rabbits were sensitized to 
progesterone by daily subcutaneous injections of 10 micrograms 
of oestrone in olive oil for seven days. Intra uterine im¬ 
plants containing progesterone or oestrone or both were made 
and left in situ for four days. Sections from the implanted 
segments were examined microscopically to determine the 
degree of progestational proliferation of the endometrium, 
which was rated on the semi quantitative scale described by 
McPhail (page 4)* 

1. Uterine Implants of Oestrone and Systemic Administrat ion 

of Progesterone (See Table 21 ) 

In these experiments implants of 1% oestrone in 
cholesterol were inserted into separate segments of uterine 
horn and left in situ for four days. During this time, the 
animal received twice daily subcutaneous injections of proges¬ 
terone in olive oil to produce the total dose indicated in 
the table. The histological condition of the control segment 
then indicates the endometrial response to the injected 
progesterone while the oestrone implanted segments indicate

to what extent this response had been inhibited by local 
action of the oestrone. 

The results given in Table 21 indicate that the 
effect of l o 0 mg. of systemic progesterone is inhibited by 
1.0 micrograms of oestrone acting locally. It is not consi¬ 
dered that the recorded weight changes of the implants during 
the four days in uteri permit significant conclusions to be 
drawn. 

2. Separate Uterine Implants Containing Oestrone and 

Progesterone (bee Table 22 ) 

In these experiments two implants, one of 1% oest¬ 
rone in cholesterol and one of 1 % progesterone in cholesterol, 
were placed in the same uterine segment. In some animals 
(as shown in the table), two segments were thus implanted. A 
further segment was given an implant of progesterone only. 

The results indicate that at a progesterone/oestrone ratio 
of 2:1, complete inhibition is obtained. 

3• Intra Uterine Implants Containing Both Oestrone and 

Progesterone in Cholesterol (bee Table 23 ) 

Implants containing both hormones in various pro¬ 
portions in cholesterol were prepared in the manner previously 
described for the preparation of oestrone in cholesterol 
implants. The composition of these mixtures was such that 
progesterone content was always 1%, the oestrone content being 
1/4, 1/3 or 1/2 of this, producing mixtures with 4:1, 3:1 
and 2:1 progesterone/oestrone content. The actual dose of

the two hormones in each implant is shown in Table 23* It 
will be seen that under these circumstances also, complete 
inhibition of the response to progesterone requires a proges- 
terone/oestrone ratio of 2:1, just as when separate implants 
of the two hormones are used. 

4* Uterine Implants of Progesterone and Systemic Administration 

of Qestrone (bee Table 24 ) 

In these experiments, three to four uterine segments 
were implanted, each with a different dose of progesterone 
given as 1 % progesterone in cholesterol, while oestrone was 
given by twice daily subcutaneous injection for four days to 
produce the total dose indicated in the table. The animals 
were killed, as in other experiments, after four days. 

The results indicate that while 20 micrograms of 
injected oestrone is insufficient to inhibit in most cases 
the response to 10 micrograms intra uterine progesterone, it 
can inhibit the response to 5 micrograms progesterone. The 
progesterone/oestrone ratio for inhibition under these circum¬ 
stances is therefore 1:4* 

In the series of experiments reported above, it has 
been shown that the progestational response to systemic 
progesterone can be inhibited locally by implants of oestrone 
placed in the uterus. These suppress the effect of the 
circulating progesterone only in the uterine segment which 
contains the implant. This is in agreement with similar 
results obtained with intra uterine injections of oestradiol

benzoate by Courrier and Poumeau Delille (12). Further, these 
experiments also show that this local inhibition of the 
response to implants of progesterone occurs with adequate 
amounts of oestrone, present either as a separate implant or 
mixed with the progesterone in a common implant. It is thus 
clearly established that the normal progestational response 
of endometrial cells to progesterone which reaches them 
(either systemically or from the uterine lumen) can be pre¬ 
vented by oestrogen. Also, this inhibition occurs in the 
region of the cells themselves and not elsewhere in the body. 

It is interesting to compare the quantitative aspects 
of the antagonism of oestrone and progesterone under various 
conditions of administration of the two hormones. From the 
papers of Robson (3&), Gillman ( 16 ) and Courrier (11), already 
referred to, it appears that in the rabbit, 1/75 of a milli¬ 
gram or less of oestrone is sufficient to inhibit 1 milligram 
of progesterone when both of these substances are given system¬ 
ically. A comparison may therefore be made on the following 
basis: 

(1) The observed progesterone/oestrone ratio for 
inhibition when both are given systemically 
is 75:1. 

(2) One milligram of progesterone (which is equiva¬ 
lent to the International Unit for progestin) 
given systemically will produce a degree of 
proliferation equivalent to that demonstrated 
on the eighth day of pregnancy. This is a

proliferation of about two to three on the 
McPhail scale and is given by about 10 micro¬ 
grams of intra-uterine progesterone ( 1 % in 
cholesterol). Therefore, it is considered 
that 1 mg. of progesterone is equivalent 
approximately to 10 micrograms of intra¬ 
uterine progesterone (1 % in cholesterol). 

(3) Two micrograms of systemic oestrone is equiva¬ 
lent to one microgram of intra-uterine 
oestrone (1 % in cholesterol). 

Table 25 shows a comparison of the calculated and 
observed ratios of these two hormones under the various con¬ 
ditions of administration. Although some differences are ob¬ 
served, it is considered that they are within the experimental 
range of error, since the experimental results upon which 
these ratios are calculated are comparatively few.

PROGESTATIONAL ACTIVITY OF STEROIDS OTHER 
THAN PROGESTERONE 


In using the procedure proposed in this thesis 
for the assay of progestogens (page 33) to determine 
progesterone specifically, it is necessary in evaluating 
the results to consider the properties of other substances 
which might be present. Hohn and Robson^- investigated the 
progestational activity of a number of steroids. The 


following were found active when implanted into the uteri 


of primed rabbits in the weights indicated: 


Progesterone ( 1 % in cholesterol) 
Ethisterone [ 1 % in cholesterol) 
Desoxycorticosterone 
Pregnenolone ( 10 % in cholesterol) 
17-Methyl dihydro testosterone 
17-Methyl testosterone 
Androsterone 
Dehydroandrosterone

Of these Ethisterone is the only one which 
demonstrated activity in concentrations of the same order 
as progesterone. However it must be noted that of the 
remainder, only pregnenolone was administered with 
cholesterol, and this was in 10 % mixture. 


The following were found to be inactive:

Testosterone, however, in implanted doses of 
20 mg. resulted in proliferative responses in the uterus 
remote from the implanted segment. This is explained if 
we assume that the testosterone which is inactive as a 
progestogen is absorbed from the implanted segment. 
Elsewhere in the body it is converted to a substance which 
is active and is carried back in the bloodstream to the 
uterus. 



COLOR REACTIONS OF PROGESTERONE 


It appeared that it would be useful to study further 
the behavior on adsorption columns of progesterone, and 
various substances that were known to interfere in determina¬ 
tions of this hormone. This required some rapid means for 
identification of these substances, and since the initial 
experiments would be performed with pure substances, this 
test need not be specific. 

¥. F. Elvidge (14) had published work dealing with 
several colorimetric methods for progesterone determination 
in solution in ethyl oleate and two of these were investi¬ 
gated in the hope of using them for the above purpose.

A intense yellow color, perhaps due to impure rea¬ 
gents, developed in each flask. This, and the inconstancy of 
the above results, indicated the presence of color coupling 
compounds other than progesterone, probably in the salicylal- 
dehyde, which was not available in pure form. This method 
was therefore abandoned in favor of method II below.

Procedure - Progesterone in 2 ml* chloroform was 
placed in a 10 ml. volumetric flask. One ml*, of the ZnClg 
reagent and one ml. Benzoyl Chloride were then added and the 
flask heated for three minutes on a vigorously boiling water 
bath. It was then cooled, diluted with Glacial Acetic Acid 
to ten ml. and read in the Fisher Electrophotometer using a 
red (650 mu.) filter. 

In a preliminary experiment using this technique, 
the following results were obtained.

These results indicated that Elvidge T s belief that 
the method was not accurate below 500 ug. was unfounded and 
that further experiments were warranted. 

The next three experiments gave very variable

results. However, it was discovered that during refluxing, 
the reagents were reacting with the rubber connector between 
the flask and the condenser. The condenser was replaced with 
one having a ground glass joint to fit the 10 ml. volumetric 
flasks used. 

A further experiment in which two flasks were heated 
for twice the time (6 minutes) gave the following results.

Apparently more prolonged heating gave a more 
intense color, although it was noted that the shade had 
changed somewhat also. 

Therefore, a series of microgram samples was 
heated for varying periods of time; the curve obtained is 
shown in Figure 9. Two blanks containing all the reagents 
but no progesterone were heated for fifteen minutes.

These blanks acquired a yellow color which, however, gave a 
reading of only 0.3 in the colorimeter. 

It was concluded from this graph that a heating 
time in the neighborhood of ten minutes would be more suitable 
than the three minute time previously used. 

At this time, very little Benzoyl Chloride remained 
and further supplies were not available. For this reason, 
and since it appeared more advantageous to complete experi¬ 
ments already in hand dealing with phases of the work discus¬ 
sed above, these experiments were carried no further except 
as noted below. 

Colorimetric Test of Elution of Progesterone from an Alumina 

Column 

A solution of 33.6 raicrograms of progesterone in 
petroleum ether was run through a column of alumina using the 
procedure outlined on page 42. Fractions 4, 5 and 6 were then 
evaporated to dryness in 10 ml. volumetric flasks and 2 ml. 
chloroform was added to dissolve the progesterone. The ZnCl^ 
reagent and Benzoyl Chloride were added as described above 
and the flasks were heated for ten minutes. When examined 
in a colorimeter, the following results were obtained in two 
trials: Fractions 4 and 6 - no readings higher than 0.1 

were obtained 

Fraction 5 - readings of 2.5 and 2.6 

This indicated that most of the added progesterone 
had appeared in fraction 5 and little, if any, in fractions

(39) that in no case had progesterone been found in fractions 
other than 5o

SECTION III, 


CONCLUSIONS 


It was stated above that the primary objective of 
this research was to obtain a procedure whereby the progesta¬ 
tional activity of a sample of blood could be estimated. 

Such a procedure has been outlined, but it is considered that 
this procedure is subject to a number of considerations 
which limit the uses to 2which it may at this time be put. 

In the section dealing with antagonism it was point¬ 
ed out that oestrogens in certain concentrations will pre¬ 
vent, or reduce the degree of, progestational responses to 
implants of progestogen in the test animal. Also, oestrogens 
which are present in the blood sample undoubtedly play a 
part in the hormonal actions of progestogen on the tissues 
of the animal from which the sample was obtained and thus it 
is essential to take into account the presence or absence of 
oestrogens at all stages of the procedure. 

However, it is noteworthy that when the progestogen 
is applied locally, it requires a much greater proportion of 
oestrogen to progestogen to inhibit the progestational res¬ 
ponse than when the progestogen is administered systemically. 

Certain problems still remain to be settled, such 
as that of the concentration of progesterone in implants 
where it is mixed with cholesterol, which will produce the

greatest degree of proliferation for a given dose of 
progesterone. 

A second important question that still remains 
unanswered is whether all of the progesterone in a blood 
sample is recovered by the extraction procedures discussed 
above; and if not, what proportion is lost at various 
stages of the procedure? 

An interesting side-issue that arose and is still 
unsettled is why two micrograms of progesterone in a 0*2% 
mixture with cholesterol will exert greater progestational 
effect on the rabbit endometrium than will a 1 % or 5 % 
mixture. 

The procedure described in this thesis for the 
bioassay of progestogens in blood samples will detect 
progesterone in such samples in absolute amounts as low as 
one micrograra* It is specific for substances having direct 
progestational activity on the endometrium and it is not 
significantly interfered with by oestrogens in concentrations 
less than one-tenth of the amount of progesterone present 
in the sample*

SUMMARY 

1. Various procedures for the assay of progestogens have 
been reviewed. The advantages and disadvantages of each as 
applicable to the estimation of progestogens in blood were 
discussed. 

2. Pellets containing progesterone mixed with cholesterol 
were implanted into the rabbit uterus and the progestational 
proliferation which they evoked was evaluated according to 
the semi-quantitative scale proposed by McPhail. The curve 
relating dosage level to response was plotted from the 
uterine responses to 199 of these pellets and the data was 
found to be significant when a statistical test was applied. 

A threshold dose for this response was found to be in the 
neighborhood of one microgram. 

3. A procedure based on this response was outlined for the 
estimation of progestogens in blood. This was tested by the 
analysis of four 5 cc. samples of plasma, to which known 
amounts of progesterone had been added. In three of these 
samples, good recovery of the hormone added was demonstrated. 
4* Several procedures for the extraction of progestogens 
from blood or plasma were tested and found satisfactory for 
use in the rabbit endometrium assay referred to above. 

Previous work on the antagonism of progesterone and oestrone 
was reviewed. The doses of oestrone and of ethinyl oestradiol 
required to produce observ^able oestrogenic changes in the 





- Si - 


rabbit uterus were determined for both local and systemic 
administration of these two substances. The dose of oestrone 
required to inhibit the proliferative response to intra-uterine 
progesterone was also determined when administered locally 
and systemically. 

6. The effect of concentrations of progesterone other than 
one percent in implanted mixtures with cholesterol was 
briefly examined, A 0.2% mixture with cholesterol was found 
to produce the progestational response in lower dosage than 
did the 1% or 5% mixtures. 

7. Various progesterone-containing implants were tested. 

None was found more satisfactory than the appropriate 
mixtures of progesterone in cholesterol referred to above. 

&. Color reactions of progesterone with benzoyl chloride 
and with salicylaldehyde were examined. Benzoyl chloride 
appeared to be a satisfactory reagent for the estimation 
of progesterone in amounts greater than ten micrograms. 

However it is not specific for progesterone.
