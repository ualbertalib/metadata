INVESTIGATION OF THE OXIDATIOH-REHUCTIO 


OF THE METHYLENE BLUE THIOCYANATE SYSTEM 
The Object of the Investigation 

The object of this investigation was primar¬ 
ily to determine the oxidation-reduction potentials of 
methylene blue thiocyanate over a complete range of 
hydrogen ion concentration. It was also desired to 
compare the results obtained w T ith those of W.M. Clark, 
who worked with the impure methylene bine chloride, 
since the thiocyanate can be prepared in a state of 
excellent pnrity. 

The w T ork is also of importance in connection 
with the methylene bine reduction test for the bacterial 
content of milk. It is important to demonstrate that 
the thiocyanate salt, which may be used in preference 
to the chloride, in this test, is reduced over the same 
range of potential as the chloride. 

The Methylene Blue Reduction Test 

Before commencing on a more detailed study 
of oxidation reduction, it may be well to first con¬ 
sider the methylene blue reduction test. 

The test may be regarded as an index of the 
care exercised by the milk prodticer in the handling of 
the milk. Bacteria in the milk due to their oxygen 






requirements, reduce the dye to the leuco form. 

Due to the impurity of the methylene "blue 
chloride which was used for the test, the test working 
standard which was available was, that at the commence¬ 
ment of the test, the methylene blue - milk solution 
should be of a Tf robin T s egg blue” color, ^he time re¬ 
quired for this color to disappear was an index of the 
bacterial content of the milk. For example, good milk 
would take from five to six hours to completely reduce 
the dye, fair milk from two to five hours, and bad 
milk less than two. 

The advantages of substituting the thiocyan¬ 
ate salt for the chloride, in the test, are few in 
number but very important. 

1. Methylene blue thiocyanate can be pre¬ 
pared practically 100^ pure, thus giving the dairyman 
an absolute standard to work by. 

2. It is thought by some workers that due 

h 

to its purity, the thiocyanate gives a clearer blue 
color and a sharper end point. 

a) 

Other substances such as Janus green and 

( 2 ) 

ikesazurin have been suggested for use in similar re¬ 
duction tests. 

In this investigation it was found that 
over a complete range of pH the methylene blue thio- 





























. 

. 











cyanate gave the same oxidation-reduction potential as 

the methylene "blue chloride. Thus we may-assume that 

from this standpoint it is a suitable substitute for 

the chloride in the reduction milk test. 

Some Theoretical Aspects of Oxidation-Reduction Poten¬ 
tials . 

Introduction 

Upon that great problem, biological oxida¬ 
tion, the attack has been continuous from 1774, when 
Joseph Priestly isolated "Dep'hlogistigated air" and 
with it conducted animal experiments. In 1775 
lavosier published his discovery of oxygen, and two 
years later his studies on respiratioh gave new mean¬ 
ing to the fact that the life of man hangs, moment to 
moment, upon the maintenance of a line of communica¬ 
tion between his tissues and the air. This knowledge 
inclined all investigators to state the facts of 
biological oxidation in terms of the element oxygen 
itself. The facts of anaerobiosis brought to light by 
Pasteur have been twisted to fit preconceptions, and 
Ehrlich 1 s suggestive studies on the reduction of dyes 
by tissues have been interpreted in terms of oxygen 
demand. As a consequence of this attitude the main 
problem has been regarded to be the discovery of the 
mechanism by which the oxygen of our atmosphere enters 














4 


the chemistry of life. 

When in 1920 G-illespie published some 
suggestive data upon electrode potentials induced 
by bacterial reduction, there was hoped that a 
method had been revealed, whereby it might be poss¬ 
ible to accumulate quantitative data and, step by 
step, build up exact evidence upon one of the mani- 
| fold aspects of the general problem. 

W.M. Clark repeated G-illespie T s work and 
confirmed its main features, but he came to the con- 
| elusion that some of the remarkable relations 

suggested were altogether too important to justify 
their acceptance, without more rigid confirmation. 
There also seemed to be a need for a supplementary 
method with which to check electrode measurements 
of reduction intensity. 

Accordingly he suspended biological studies 
and began a study of the potentials of various dyes 
in equilibrium with their reduction products--systems 
which can be used as indicators of oxidation-reduc¬ 
tion intensity in a manner comparable to the use of 
acid-base indicators in hydrogen ion studies. 

Since the various aspects of the subject 
are somewhat complicated it seems best to preface t^e

description of experimental data "by a review of 
elementary principles and a theoretical analysis of 
relations between electrode potentials and pH. 

The Meaning of Oxidation-Reduction 

The Element iron is known in aqueous solu¬ 
tion in two states, each recognized by specific re¬ 
actions. The one is called the ferrous, the other 
the ferric state. Ferrous iron may be converted 
into ferric iron by any one of a group of reagents, 
among which are oxygen, chlorine and permanganate. 

In each case the nature of the change in the state 
of the iron is the same, even though the trans¬ 
forming agents vary. We then seek the factor common 
to the three agents. Two of them contain oxygen, 
and if we consider that chlorine reacts with water 
to liberate oxygen we may assume that in each case 
the agent common to the transformation of ferrous 
to ferric iron is oxygen. 

Thus it was that a great many transforma¬ 
tions came to be systematized in terms of the par¬ 
ticipation of oxygen and were termed TT Oxidations n . 

In the progressive action of oxygen the products 
were known as higher and higher states of oxidation. 
The reverse process was then looked upon as leading 
to lovfer states and was termed "reduction. rr This 













6 


term however, was applied not only to the removal of 
oxygen hut also to the addition of hydrogen. This 
is of no serious consequence to the systematist 
since he can always devise a way to shew that the 
addition of hydrogen is equivalent to the removal of 
oxygen. Given the liberty of avoiding a roundabout 
expression of experimental facts the experimentalist 
will avoid any consideration of oxygen in describing 
a reaction such as 

FeCl* * Cl —* Fed* 

As a matter of fact, the best evidence 
indicates that such salts exist largely in the 
ionized forms, as indicated below, and the reaction 
may be regarded as the transference of an electron. 
FeCl z FeCl 3 

i i 

Fe + ’ + SGI + Cl —> Fe'"' 3Cl' 

That is Fe ■ - » Fe plus an electron. The 

chlorine is thus merely the absorbent of electrons, 
and we can conceive of any agent which induces the 
reaction, to act merely by withdrawing electrons to 
itself. The reverse process, the transformation of 
Fe to Fe +f ^ could be conceived as due to any 

f 44 

agent which contributes electrons to Fe 

The call under discussion is a reversible 







Y 


reaction which may he expressed by means of double 

arrows, + *. * 

Fe f e Fe 

Thus the breach in the original systematic 
classification has been widened until there has- 
entered a meaning quite foreign to the original terms 
"oxidation 11 and "reduction". If required to define 
terms we can say that oxidation can be regarded as the 
withdrawal of electrons from a substance, with or 
without the addition of oxygen or elements analogous 
to oxygen or as the withdrawal of electrons, with or 
without the withdrawal of hydrogen or elements anala- 
gous to hydrogen. Reduction is the reverse of oxida¬ 
tion as defined above. 

Oxidation Reduction Equilibria 
Since the ion Fe**is capable of losing an 
electron.' it may be regarded as a reducing agent. 

Since Fe is capable of taking up an electron it 
may be regarded as an oxidizing agent. Now it is 
practically impossible to prepare a solution absolute¬ 
ly pure with respect to either oxidant or reluctant 
and in many instances it is desirable to know the de¬ 
gree to which a. mixture of oxidant and reluctant is 
oxidized or reduced by another system. Our interest 
then centers on the ratio of reluctant to oxidant 



























- 8 - 


and upon the conditions under which this ratio 
assumes different values. 

As suggested in the previous section we 
can regard the reversible transformation of ferric 
to ferrous iron to proceed through any one of a 
number of possible courses such as the following:

If we express the concentrations by means of brack- 
ets, the equation expressing the equilibrium condi¬ 
tions for the cases mentioned are as follows:

This proceedure is capable of indefinite 

































expansion and shows that from the schematic point 
of view we are at liberty to choose any hypothetical 
scheme with which to express the equilibrium state. 
The discovery of finite values for the chosen terms 
does not prove that the selected species are alone 
involved, in the actual mechanism^ and that-values 
representing no actuality are still useful for pur¬ 
poses of calculation. 

It will be found convenient to use the 
following schematic treatment. In a solution con¬ 
taining ferrous and ferric ions there can be a con¬ 
tinuous exchange of electrons as represented by the 
reversible reaction. 

Fe 4 ** %-e ^ Fe *"*" 

It is improbable that the mechanism of 
this exchange is such that there ape present at any 
instant an appreciable number of free electrons. On 
the other hand the solution certainly possesses the 
ability to Tl reduce" certain substances brought in 1 
contact with it. This ability is expressed in terms 
of the electron escaping tendency, or n fugacity. TT 
We shall not do great violence to the subject if in 
this discussion we replace the "fugacity" by the more 
familiar term "concentration * 1 and formulate the 
equilibrium state of the reaction in accordance with 






-L. 


the mass law as follows: 

(F + t O (e) _ K 

(Fe + ' + ) 

In general for any oxidation-reduction 
reaction, involving the transfer of n electrons, 
the equilibrium state is formulated "by 
( Ox ) ( e Y _ K 

(Red) 

Where (Ox) represents the active con¬ 
centrations of oxidant and (Red) represents the 
active concentration of reductant. 

Now let the equilibrium of one system 

be formulated by (Red) __ (e)

If the absolute, of relative values of K 

and yJ were known we could at once predict what ratio 

of given oxidant and its reduction product would 

exist writh a given ratio of another oxidant and its 

(Red) 

reduction product. For instance, if __ p

tieallv completely reduced., practically complete¬ 
ly oxidized, or at some intermediate stage. This 
would enable us to arrange all systems on a relative 
oxidation-reduction scale. The position of a system 
on such a scale would show its oxidizing or reducing 
tendency with respect to other systems. 

Electrode Potentials 

An evidence of some actual state of which 
fejis representative is found inrthe fact that a 
noble metal placed, in a solution containing an oxi¬ 
dation-reduction system, acquires an electron charge 
increasing in intensity with increase of the reducing 
tendency, the electron fugacity, or as we choose to 
say, the CO value of the solution. 

let us assign the value (e nT) to the con¬ 
centration of free electrons in the noble metal.

If new we measure such electromotive forces 


against a hydrogen electrode, taking the single 
electrode potential of the hydrogen electrode as 
zero, w r e have a set of readings of E, in which E is 
defined as the difference in potential "between the 
electrode and the normal hydrogen electrode. To 
make this clear, it is written E ^ . Sj. nc e the

We have now arrived at a result amen¬ 


able to experimental test, and which has been 
successfully submitted to such tests in a wide 
variety of instances.

tally, definite E values in any given system, it 
is possible to express n relative oxidation-reduction 
intensities in terms of electrode potential 1 / This is 
illustrated graphically in figure 1, where E values 
are plotted as ordinates and instead of the ratio 
jped) / jpx} , the percentage reduction is plotted 
as abscissa. The distinctly different slopes of A 






and B are determined by the value, of n in the equa¬ 
tion. It will also be noted that the position of 
a system in the potential scale depends on the 
value of E 0 and within any one system E ^ depends on 
the ratio of reluctant to oxidant and not on the 
total concentration. 

It must be borne in mind that E ^ is a 
measure of oxidation-reduction intensity and not 
capacity . It will be noted that when (bed) / flu 
approaches one, the value of Eh is stabilized. 

This is comparable to buffer action and is known as 
"poising action." 

The charting of all systems as in figure 
1, would then systematize the subject thoroughly, 
were it not for difficulties which we will now have 
to deal with.

Hdre the active reduetant is the anion of an acid 
and its concentration is therefore dependent not 
only on the total amount of reductant present, hut 
also on conditions which govern ionization. "Among 
these conditions the hydrogen ion concentration is 
most important." 

Since it is offlen difficult to obtain the 
exact values of FI it will he more useful to set 
up equations relating E to total reluctant present 
and total oxidant. Assuming our reaction to he

In dilute solution we may assume that the

Here (S d ) represents the total concentration of oxi¬ 
dant s. 

Inspection of this equation shows that when 
the ratio (S^) / (S 0 ) is kept constant, Bk will vary 
with pH alone. When K^is small it will be a linear 
function of pH and when K a is large the variation 
will be inappreciable. When (H*) - K« E ^ will be 
the mid point of the inflection, connecting the one 
extreme set of conditions with the other. This fact 
makes determinable experimentally.

If on the other hand the hydrogen ion 
concentration is held constant hy means of buffers 
we can write the constants then found, and the 
equation becomes

This equation is identical with the one 
obtained before. Now, however, we are working with 
measurable quantities of oxidant and reductant. 

If the value of E K is known for each 
value of the ratio N~* the number of electrons 


concerned is determinable. This of course, is 
fundamental in the investigation of any new system. 

If we have two electrons to deal with 
there are several possibilities. Three will be 
indicated at this point.

primarily 


interested in the potentials of the methylene blue

system, thus we will terminate our general dis¬ 
cussion and- enter upon a more specific discussion. 

The Electrode Equation of a Thiazine 

Both methylene Blue and Lauth T s violet 
are thiazines of the same general structure. Lauth T s 
violet contains four less methyl groups than methylene 
"bine. 

If for each of these two substances a 
series of potential readings are made for various 
values.of pH, in each case keeping the ratio 
(s jjL. - l and 'k* 16 results plotted, as E ^ against 

fs 0 

pH, we would obtain curves such as are shown in 
figure 2. 

Then with the experimental data before 
us we come to their formulation in accordance with 
the principles outlined before. 

Since the Lauth T s violet system displays 
an inflection in the E^ - H curve (figure 2), in 
alkaline solutions which the methylene blue system 
does not, it furnishes the more complete picture. 
Therefore, the following interpretation will be made 
wiija the aid of Lauthds violet. 

In the acid region, the value of -dE is

0 9 09 which we shall call the 0.09 slope. The 0.09 

slope abruptly changes to 0.03 slope at a pH of 

about 5, and since two electrons or their equivalent 

are concerned in the reduction process making the 

RT coefficient 0.03, this change of 0.06 (i.e. 2x 
nF 

0.03) indicated that two acid base dissociations 
are encountered in this p H region. The two dissoc¬ 
iation constants concerned are obviously not iden¬ 
tical, because the actual inflection of the curve 
is not nearly so abrupt as would be the case were 
they identical. Bo- both, of these constants repre¬ 
sent ionizable groups created or destroyed in the 
act of reduction? If they do, we still have, un¬ 
accounted for, a third group made apparent by the 
change from a 0.03 slope to a 0.06 slope at pH 11. 

Since the electrometric data reveal 
"directly TT little, regarding the nature or the loca¬ 
tion of the acid base groups encountered, it is 
possible to express the experimental data as des¬ 
cribed before' but such equations call for bizarre 
chemical properties on the part of the thiazines. 

By adopting the following rational development we 
can reach a result which seems satisfactory from 
every viewpoint. 

We shall assume that Bernthsen T s formu¬ 
lae for a thiazine is essentially correct. Writing 











- Act — 

the formula from the electronic point of view we 
then have for a thiazine formula 1 and for its re¬ 
luctant formula 11 in figure 5. 

It will he particularly noted that the 
double bonded terminal nitrogen, formula 1, con¬ 
tributes but four electrons to the surrounding octet 
while it has five positive charges reserved for its 
outer shell. Consequently this group has a distinct 
polar valence comparable with that of ammonium. On 
reduction this polar valence is destroyed and at 
the same time a potential anion is created at the 
bridging nitrogen. 

The oxidation-reduction -process may 
therefore be expressed in the following form

Since we shall have to deal with basic 


groups, and for the sake of uniformity, desire to 
deal with hydrogen ion rather than hydroxyl ion 
concentrations, we shall find the first section 
of onr derivation simplified by Bronsted’s formu¬ 
lation of acid-base equilibria. 

Bronsted unifies the representation of 
acid-base equilibria by the expression- 
acid base t H*

(base) 

The group RNH^may be treated as if it 
acquired basic properties either by addition and 
subsequent ionization of hydroxyl or by direct 
addition of hydrogen ion. It is*therefore, 
immaterial to the present formalistic treatment, 
whether we use the ordinary dissociation con¬ 
stants or K ^ constants, so long as we retain the 

relation K a r ~ . We shall use either constant 
^b 


in accordance with convenience and shall later 
summarize with the customary K symbols. 

In the following summations we shall re¬ 
gard each represented species as equivalent to the 
sum of the hydrated and unhydrated molecules of 







- 25 - 


the same species. For the reductant the sum (S ) 
of all the species is, 

(S n ) =: (Her!) + (H Red) 4(H 2 Red + ) + (H 3 ReV )

it is more realistic to treat it as a cation adding 
the hydroxyl ion directly. Hence.

Without further discussion we shall

The peculiarity arises from the fact 
that we have assumed both hydroxyl and hydrogen 
ions to be concerned, and obviously we would 
have met a similar situation, had we continued 
with the same assumption and chosen to formulate 
the equation in terms of hydroxyl ions.

Dissociation Constants 
Since we ascribe a polar valence to the 
double bonded terminal nitrogen, and discover in 
Lauth T s violet an inflection of the E/,~pH curve 
at pH 11, we shall give to ~r^ a value of 1CT* # . 

- i Hi 

Tentatively accepting the value 1.88 x 10 for 
Kuj at 30° we find K ^ to be 1.88 x 10 

It will have been noted that we have left 
but of consideration a second group of potentially 
basic properties in the oxidant. T $ere this group 
active, forming the cation 0*H 1 ’*' within the exper¬ 
imental range of pH, we would have found at some 
pH zone lower than that at which the 0.03 slope 
occurs an inflection of the curve tending toward a 
zero slope. The inflections observed are in the 
opposite direction. Consequently, we can conclude 
that the basicity of the amino group in the oxi¬ 
dant is so TI weak TT that for all practical purposes 
we may neglect it, with the resulting simplifica¬ 
tion of the equation. The inflections found, must 
then be ascribed to ionizations, of the two re¬ 
maining groups of the reductant. The constants of 
these two groups are represented by K m. and 

In determining the values of K n ^and K^ s 
it is helpful to use the intersection of the pro- 








28 


Sections of the so-called 0.09 and 0.03 slopes. 

Those sections of the curve which are found in the 
regions concerned are, when considered independently, 
determined "by the following equations.

The first of these three determines the 
0.03 slope, the last, the 0.09 slope, while the 
second determines the 0.06 slope between these two 
limbs of the curve. 

The intersection of the 0.03 and 0.09 


slopes occurs at E. = E 3 or when log

It was suggested above that the section of 
the E^-pH curve having a slope of 0.09 lies between 















the region of ionization of a group in the oxidant 
so weak that the Kfc value is negligible, and the 
region of an appreciable ionization of that same 
group as it appears in the reductant. 

Turning now from Lauth T s violet to meth¬ 
ylene bine, we can apply the same principles, and 
with the exception of new values for the constants 
employed, the only essential difference is the ab¬ 
sence of an inflection of the curve in the alkaline 
region. This simply means that in methylene bine 
the Value of K&y is too large to permit suppression 
of its basic ionization by the alkaline buffers 
employed.

Discussion of hxu^rimcntal Methods 

In all the experimental work, the concen¬ 
tration of the solutions used was of the order of 
0.0001 M. The work was done on the assumption that 
the observed potentials were dependent on the ratio, 

1-1 , 

(6x) 

and not on total concentrations of the two together. 
The work of W. M. Clark (3) has shown that this is 
not true in the extreme. Thus while there may have 
been variations in concentration from one experiment 
to another, all concentrations were of the same order 
and the authors feel that no error has been intro¬ 
duced, through this source. 

In stating results, we shall reduce the 
single observed potential differences to the hydro¬ 
gen standard, designating by Ethe reduction elec¬ 
trode potential. In this treatment there are in¬ 
volved, the following assumptions. The ultimate 
working standard, with; which the saturated KC1 
calomel half cells were compared, was the hydrogen 
electrode potential difference of an M/20 K acid 
phthalate solution, to which was assigned the 
value of - 0.2347 at 25°C. Liquid junctions were 
in all cases, made with saturated KC1 and the 




































- 51- 

potential differences of such junctions were ig¬ 
nored. 

The buffers used in the experimental 
work were either those suggested by W. M. Clark 
in his "Studies on .'Oxidation-Reduction 11 , or ones 
which were very slightly modified to include citric 
acid. 

lainds of p H were run on each buffer 
just before use. This was necessary, because it 
was found difficult to accurately duplicate any 
pH, by simply making up a similar buffer. 

All E.M.F. measurements were made at 
25°C ±0.10.° 

Oxidation-reduction potentials were 
measured by three different methods. While only 
one of these methods gave satisfactory results, 
all three will be described here, because the 
author/ feels that these can be used satisfactor¬ 
ily, and intend to try to accomplish this at a 
later date. 

The first, and from a theoretical 
standpoint, the best method employed was that of 
simply measuring the potentials of mixtures of 
oxidized and reduced forms containing no other 

oxidizing or reducing substances. 

A diagram of the apparatus is shown in

figure 4. This is merely a prbtected system in 
which the reduced methylene hire can he prepared, 
stored, and delivered in measured amounts without 
coming in contact with oxygen. 

When a reduced solution was to he pre¬ 
pared, A was first left empty. Purified nitrogen 
was passed in at F and different branches of the 
system were flushed. Meanwhile filter D was pre¬ 
pared. A firm pad of asbestos was formed against 
the perforated platinum disc and ^sucked free from 
water, in order to open its texture for passage, 
of nitrogen. The filter was then attached to H, 
while nitrogen was escaping. With nitrogen 
running through the filter,vessel C was put in 
place containing buffered dye solution and plat¬ 
inized asbestos. The dye was then reduced in 
C by means of a stream of hydrogen. When the re¬ 
duction was complete a Cenco Pump was attached at 
G-, cock (5) was closed and the apparatus was evac¬ 
uated. Cock (1) was opened only when an outward 
flow of gas TAras insured. Cock (2) was now turned 
so that the reduced solution would be forced from 
C to A. 

When A, of about 200 cc. capacity was 
nearly full, nitrogen was admitted and bubbled

through the solution by way of 5, 4, 6 and 3, es¬ 
caping through 2 and 1, and mercury trap attached to 
G-. C was now disconnected at H and the tube between 
H and cock 2 was left full of reduced solution. The 
material in A, when held between closed cocks, showed 
no signs of oxidation. 

The reduced solution was now moved to the 
burette B, from which it was measured out into the 
electrode vessel through K. From a separate outside 
burette, the oxidized form was added to the reduced, 
and the E.M.F. was measured on a type K potentiometer. 
Having obtained a series of F.M.F. readings and a 
corresponding series of values for (S r ) a curve 

(S 0 ) 

could be plotted representing the complete behavior 
of the system for the particular pH at which the 
measurements were made. 

This method did not give a satisfactory 
curve however. As was stated before the author 
feel that this method can be made to give the best 
results of any method, when the technical difficul¬ 
ties involved are mastered. 

The second method employed, and one 










which also gave unsatisfactory results was that 
of a quinone titration. The apparatus of figure 
4 was used to prepare a reduced solution of the 
methylene bine salt. A measured amount of this 
solution was then titrated potentrofiietrically with 
quinone. 

The third method and the one which gave 
very satisfactory results was the converse of the 
quinone titration, that is, it was a reduction 
titratioh using titanous chloride solution. 

By this method potential readings were 
made at various steps, during the titration of the 
oxidized Methylene blue with titanous chloride 
solution, each being dissolved in buffers, and con¬ 
tained in a protected system. Both visual and 
graphical end points were taken and in all cases 
these were very close together. The E.M.F. at the 
half titrated point was then taken as equal to E 0 . 

In some eases, the methylene blue solu¬ 
tion was titrated into the titanus chloride 
solution. When the first permanent blue color 
appeared the number of c.c, of Methylene blue which 
had been added was taken as equal to total reluc¬ 
tant. As more Methylene blue was added, EM.F. 
readings were made until the total oxidant exdeed- 
ed the total reluctant. -The value of E^ was then 










read from the point on the curve where total 
oxidant was equal to total reluctant. 

It was found that the titanous chloride 
could he kept in solution at alkaline pH T s by the 
addition of citric acid to the buffers. By this 
method, titanous chloride solutions down to a 
pH of 10 were made quite stable. The apparatus 
used was that which is shown in figure 5. The 
titanous chloride solution was contained in a 
hydrogen protected system which held its concen¬ 
tration constant for several hours. The absolute 
strength of the solution did not matter since 
the half titrated point was obtained graphically 
in all cases, and not from calculations of normal 


ities.

Observations and Results . 

The following sets of data and graphs 
were those obtained from measurements during 
the titration of reduced solutions of methylene 
bine salts with quinone. It was expected that 
a curve 7 would have been obtained similar to one 
of those shown in figure 1. Had such a curve 
been obtained the inflection point would have rep¬ 
resented the E^ value at the point where 
(Red) m (Ox). 

Figures (a) to (c) show the curves which 
were obtained. These results were unsatisfactory 
and no interpretation has as yet been placed upon 
them. While all three do Somewhat resemble the 
curves of figure 1, they are not reproducable, and 
the apparent end.point does not correspond to the 
calculated end point. 

All such titrations were conducted in an 


oxygen free system, at 25°C

The following four tables and graphs 
represent attempts to obtain oxidation reduction 
potentials of methylene blue systems by the method 
of mixtures. The apparatus of figure 4 was used 
for these measurements. The system, at all times, 
consisted of nothing more than simple mixtures of 
the oxidized and reduced methylene blu.e salts in 
buffers at a definite pH. 

The curves obtained by plotting the 
v data are shown in figures (d) to (g). While these 
curves' are consistently of the same general type 
they are useless for purposes of calculating oxi¬ 
dation reduction potentials.

The following set of data andgraphs 
were obtained from measurements during the 
titration of oxidized methylene blue salts with 
titanous chloride. The stoichemetric end point 
of such a titration can be obtained from a visual 
observation as the blue color disappears during 
the titration, or it can be obtained from the 
graph. On the graph it is represented by the 
number of c.c. directly below the middle of the 
vertical drop in the curve. This point represents 
100ft reduction, of the methylene blue solution. 

The half titrated point represents the point where 
(Red) is equal to'(Ox) or where (Red)/ (Ox) 1 
This method gave the most satisfactory 
results of the three which were tried. The values 
of E Q were in most cases the same for both the 
chloride and thiocyanate.

The following two curves were obtained 
by a slightly different proceedure from that used 
before. A solution of titanous chloride was added 
to the electrode vessel, and methylene blue solution 
run in from a burette until the first permanent 
blue color made its appearance. It was now assumed 
that all the methylene blue which had been run in 
was in the reduced form, and that this quantity could 
be used as a measure of (Red). Mqre oxidized methy¬ 
lene blue solution was now run in and E, measurements

Sttmmary of the Observations 

If the curves from (h) to (o) he plotted 
on one graph as E^ against percentage reduction, 
each pair will he represented by a single curve as 
shown in figure 6.. 

The following table shows the relation 
of E^ to pH, and the corresponding graph is plotted 
in figure 7. This curve agrees well with both the 
experimental curve obtained by W. M. Clark and with 
the theoretical analysis given before.

Summary 

The oxidation-reduction potentials 
of the system methylene "blue thiocyanate have 
"been run over a complete range of pH and have 
been found to check satisfactorily with the 
work of W. M. Clark. 

The oxidation-reduction potentials 
of methylene "blue thiocyanate are the same as 
those of methylene blue chloride under the same 
conditions.

A New Protected Burette for Standard Reducing Solutions 

The apparatus used for holding and measur¬ 
ing out the titanous chloride solutions, in the in¬ 
vestigation of the oxidation-reduction potentials of 
methylene blue, is shown in figure 5. While this 
apparatus was satisfactory for the purposes to which 
it was put in that work, it is most unsatisfactory 
for general quantitative analysis. 

It has been found that with the best of 
materials and.using the purest of hydrogen, and 
keeping the system under a positive pressure of 
hydrogen at all times, still oxygen of the air 
leaks into such a system and the strength of the 
reducing solution will not remain within analyt¬ 
ical specifications for more than a few hours. In 
order to obtain a burette which would hold the 
concentration of such solutions constant over long 
periods of time, the one shown in figure 8 was de¬ 
signed, using mercury instead of hydrogen to fill 
all the dead spaces. While the design is original 
the principle is not new. MeFarlane has applied 
the same principle in the case of a microburette.(1) 

The burette is so designed that it can 
be made in two pieces and put together with rubber 
tubing. At no point in the system does the 


































reducing solution come in contact with any material 
other than glass, or mercury. 

The mechanical principle of the appara¬ 
tus is as follows. A storage reservoir of mercury 
B is placed above the rest of the system, and from 
it mercury is siphoned over, creating a head of 
pressure at G-. When cocks C and K are closed and 
F opened, mercury flows from B to D and the vol¬ 
ume which passes into the burette I) is equal to 
the volume of standard solution which flows out 
of D through F into the titration vessel J. The 
bulb L is a storage vessel in which the reserve 
standard solution is stored. This bulb is filled 
with standard solution through E while mercury 
passes out through I, and K remains closed. The 
burette 3) is filled by opening both K and C while 
F remains closed. Mercury flows from D to L by 
way of K and standard solution flows from 1 to 
J) by way of C. 

The apparatus is set up as shown, and 
solution of titanous chloride in hydrochloric acid 
is run into L. All air is flushed out through F, 
and when the system has stood for a day the solu¬ 
tion is standardized. It is restandardized at

intervals over a period of a month and a half during 
which time there is no appreciable change in concen¬ 
tration. 

The method of standardization is as 
follows. A sample of FeSO^NB^)gS 046 Hg 0 of about one 
gram, is weighed out and dissolved in HgS 04 .. This 
is then titrated with TT/10 KMn 04 to an accurate end 
point. After boiling to expel dissolved oxygen, 
the solution is cooled and an excess of KG ITS added 
as an indicator of ferric ions. The vessel is now 
placed in position J and with a stream of purified 
nitrogen passing through it, it is titrated to a 
colorless solution with the titanous chloride solu¬ 
tion. The observations are shown in the following 
table.

Conclusion 


- / a - 


A new burette has been designed, and 
tested which will preserve standard reducing 
solutions, indefinitely. The apparatus is simple 
and easy.-to make.
