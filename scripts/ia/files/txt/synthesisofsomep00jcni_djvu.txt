THE SYNTHESIS OF 


SOME POLYNUCLEAR AROMATIC HYDROCARBONS 

Introduction 

The object of the research outlined in 
this thesis was to synthesize 1,2,7,8-dibenzotetra- 
cene (IV), a compound necessary for the testing of 
Bergmann f s theory of the carcinogenic activity of cer¬ 
tain chemical compounds (1). Noting that the majority 
of carcinogenic agents, including the most active ones, 
were the chemically inert polynuclear aromatic hydro¬ 
carbons, Bergmann in 1942 postulated that cancer-pro¬ 
ducing activity was related to the adsorbability of 
the carcinogen on living tissue, the adsorbability in 
turn depending on the shape and size of the molecule 
as a whole. Further, he postulated an ideal carcinogen 
of maximum activity, the shape and size of which were 
perfectly adapted for adsorption on whatever molecule 
or molecules functioned as acceptor in the living organ¬ 
ism. The more closely a molecule approached the ideal 
shape and size, the more potent a carcinogen it would 
be. As regards size, general shape being the same, 
Bergmann reasoned that it could vary only within narrow 












2 


limits if the molecule were to be adsorbed on the 
acceptor. If the molecule were too small, adsorptive 
forces would be weak, while if it were too large there 
would be physical obstruction of adsorption. Thus, in 
the series 



III is a potent carcinogen. I, II and IT by reason of 
their size should be inactive. Bergmann pointed out 
that experimentally I and II were inactive, while IT 
at the time he wrote had not been synthesized and 
tested. To provide the compound necessary for the com* 
pletion of the proof of his theory as applied to the 
above series the synthesis of 1,2,7,8-dibenzotetraeene 
(IT) was attempted#

Discussion 


Synthesis of 1,2,7,8-dibenzotetracene (IV ) 

No report of IV was found in the litera¬ 
ture when this investigation was started. However, 

Cook (2) in 1931 reported the synthesis of its unsym- 
metrical isomer, 1,2,9,10-dibenzotetracene (VI), by 
means of the Elbs pyrolysis. He pyrolyzed 
3-(2 , -methyl-l , -naphthoyl)phenanthrene (Va). VI was 
obtained as a canary-yellow compound melting at 
341-343°. A very small quantity of an orange-red isomer, 
melting at 245-248°, was also obtained. We thought that 
pyrolysis of the isomer of Va, 2-(2 ? -methyl-1 T -naphthoyl)- 
phenanthrene (Vb), would give two isomers, IV and 
3,4,8,9-dibenzotetraphene (VTI). 

A survey of the melting points of aromatic 
hydrocarbons as recorded in the literature showed that 
linear, symmetrically-shaped compounds had higher melting 
points than unsymmetrical or irregularly shaped isomers. 

IV therefore was expected to have a higher melting point 
than VI, which in turn, because of its linear shape, 
would melt at least as high, if not higher, than VII. 

Thus isolation of a hydrocarbon melting appreciably 
above 341-343° would indicate the formation of IV.

Ketone Vb, m*p* 184-185° (5), was prepared 
from phenanthroyl-2-chloride and 2-methylnaphthalene 
by means of the Friedel and Crafts reaction, carbon 
disulfide being used as the solvent. The phenanthroyl- 
2-chloride was prepared from phenanthren© using the 
general procedure of Mosettig and van de Kamp (4, 5) 
and Bachmann (6). The ketone was pyrolyzed at 425-4350, 
and the pyrolyzate sublimed and recrystallized twice

from xylene-toluene to give a yellow hydrocarbon, A, 
C 26 H 16> m *P* 383-385° (corr.). The hydrocarbon formed 
a red dipicrate, m.p. 230-233° (corr*). The formula 
c 26 h 16 indicated an aromatic hydrocarbon of six rings, 
while the melting point, in view of the considerations 
already outlined, indicated that it was the hydrocarbon 
desired, (IV). 

However, shortly after this synthesis there 
was obtained an abstract of a paper by E. Clar (7), in 
which he reported the synthesis of 1,2,7,8-dibenzotetra- 
cene (IV), m.p. 345°, and 3,4,8,9-dibenzotetraphene (VII), 
m.p. 385°, by the pyrolysis of a mixture of ketones Va 
and Vb. VII was assumed by us to be identical with our 
hydrocarbon A. Brief reference was made in Clar’s ab¬ 
stract to certain synthetic and spectroscopic proofs of 
structure. These seemed insufficient, and an effort was 
made to obtain the original article (8). At the same 
time more convincing synthetic evidence of structure 
than was indicated in Clar f s paper was sought. 

II. Attempted synthetic confirmation of the structure 
of IV by pyrolysis of 2-(2*-methyl-1*-naphthoyl)- 
9,10-dihydrophenanthrene . 

Burger and Mosettig (9) had reported that 
in all cyclization reactions encountered with 9,10-di- 
hydrophenanthrene substituted at the 2- position, the 
cyclization took place along the Cg- Cg bond of the 
















-

dihydrophenanthrene nucleus. This accorded with their 
view that 9,10-dihydrophenanthrene behaved as diphenyl 
with alkyl substituents in an ortho position of each 
ring. If this principle were to hold true in all cycli- 
zations, then pyrolysis of Vc, the 9,10-dihydro deriva¬ 
tive of ketone Vb, would result exclusively in the 
hydrocarbon 1,2,7,8-dibenzo-3,4-dihydrotetracene (VIII), 
which would dehydrogenate to give IV. 



Ketone Vc was prepared from 9,10-dihydro- 
phenanthrene and was pyrolyzed at temperatures ranging 
from 420° to 470°. (The acyl halide was prepared from 
phenanthrene via 9,10-dihydrophenanthrene using the 
general procedure of Burger and Mosettig (10) and Stuart 
and Mosettig (11)), 2-Methylnaphthalene was formed 
during the pyrolysis. The pyrolyzate, on sublimation 
and recrystallization from xylene-toluene, yielded two 
hydrocarbons (carbon and hydrogen analyses on these 
indicated the formula CggE^g instead of the expected 
C 26 H 18 ):

(1) Compound B, nearly white, melted at 398-400° 
(corr.), and gave a somewhat unstable orange- 
red dipicrate melting at 238-241°. 

(2) Compound C, bright yellow in color, melted 
at 353-355° (corr.) and gave a stable red 
dipicrate of m.p. 234-237°. 

The above pyrolysis thus involves dehydro¬ 
genation. The only previous examples of such aromatiza- 
tion in the Elbs synthesis were reported by Cook (2) 
and Clar (12) for certain tetrahydronaphthyl ketones. 

C resembled in general description the 345° 
compound of Cook and Clar, and this latter compound was 
synthesized for comparison from ketone 7a, m.p. 150° (3) 
(made using phenanthroyl-3-chloride and 2-methylnaphtha- 
lene). The bright yellow hydrocarbon D (or 17) melted 
at 350° (corr.). (The acetone-soluble low-melting 
orange-red isomer was also obtained in smaller quantity.) 
Mixed melting-point determinations of D with C consis¬ 
tently gave a seven to eight degree depression, while 
similar determinations using the two dipicrates gave no 
appreciable depression. These results remained unchanged 
despite repeated recrystallizations and purifications of 
the compounds via the picrates. As far as B was concerned 
it did not seem to correspond to any hydrocarbon described 
in Clar’s abstract (7). 

To save time it was decided to obtain

absorption spectra of the compounds. This work was done 
at Queen’s University by R. N. Jones and G. D. Thorn. 
Absorption curves were obtained for compounds A, B, C 
and D in dioxan. A, C and D were purified as far as 
possible via their picrates and by recrystallization, 
while B, which formed an unstable picrate was purified 
by recrystallization alone. Jones and Thorn Interpreted 
the absorption curves as follows: 

(1) B and D were pure compounds. 

(2) The curve for B, m.p. 398-400°, corresponded 
exactly with that given by Clar (8) for VII 
(m.p. 385°), while that for D, m.p. 350°, as 
expected, corresponded exactly with Clar’s 
curve for IV (m.p. 345°)(Jones and Thorn had 
access to Clar’s original paper). 

(3) Compound A was a mixture of 80$ B and £0$ D, 
while compound C was a mixture of 60$ B and 
40$ D. 

The above results were checked by mixing 
portions of the pure compounds B and D in the proportions 
indicated by the absorption curve analysis, and then 
running melting points and absorption curves on the 
mixtures. The melting point values and absorption 
curves thus obtained checked with those for A and C. 

(The discrepancy in melting points of B and D with VII 
and IV of Clar was explained by the fact that all Clar’s

values were uncorreeted. ) Pure B and D were obtained 
from A and C respectively by recrystallization from 
xylene-toluene, and benzene extraction. Mixed melting 
points with the pure compounds gave no depression. 

The absorption curves are shown in figures 
1, 2, 3 and 4. Peaks which form part of the absorption 
curve of B are marked 0, while those forming part of the 
curve of D are marked X. Certain peaks in A and C are 
due to the light absorption of both compounds and are 
marked ® . Em is the molecular extinction coefficient. 

Jones and Thorn calculated the percentage 
of the components in the mixtures A and C as follows: 

Peaks at wavelengths 4350 and 3230 were 
peculiar to D, but occurred also in the mixtures A and 
C. Peaks at wavelengths 3620 and 3090 were common to 
all curves. The values for the molecular extinction 
coefficient Em are shown in Table I.

For wavelengths 3670 and 3090 the peaks were due to both

At 3090 the absorption due to 40$ D = 15800 x = 63300.

The above evidence identified compounds B 
and D with certainty with those synthesized by Clar. 

The question of the correctness of the structures as¬ 
signed by him remained unanswered, as far as a reliable 
synthetic proof was concerned, since the dehydrogena¬ 
tion accompanying the pyrolysis of ketone Yc rendered 
useless any conclusions that might have been drawn re¬ 
garding cyclization along the Cg-Cg bond. 

III. Partial synthetic confirmation of 

the structures assigned by Clar . 

Clar in his original paper (8), as well as 
assigning structures IY and YII to the compounds melting 
at 345° and 385° respectively, assigned structure VI to 
the orange-red isomer obtained by Cook (2). He set 
forth the following evidence in favor of these struc¬ 
tures:

(1) On the basis of his experience, Vb would cyclize 
most readily at position 1- to give VII with possibly 
some IV* Va would follow the general rule he set forth 
as regards the behavior of unsymmetrical ketones in the 
Elbs pyrolysis by rearranging to give finally IV with 
possibly a small amount of VI* 

There would be no cyclization along the 
C 3 -C 4 bond, since in phenanthrene reactions, attack at 
the 4- position is invariably avoided. 

Clar made no mention of the fact that VII 
was not isolated as a pyrolysis product of Va as one 
would expect following the rearraugment to Vb. Such a 
rearraugment Clar himself assumed. 




IV 




































(2) He noted that VII resembled 3,4-benzpyrene (IX) 
in general chemical behaviour and appearance whereas IV 
and VI resembled 1,2,5,6-dibenzanthracene (III) and 
1,2,7,8-dibenzanthracene (X) respectively, IV and VI dif¬ 
fering from each other in a similar fashion to III and X.

derivative (XI) with hydrazine hydrate.

This Clar considered very strong evidence for the struc¬ 
ture of VII. 

(4) In his work on aromatic hydrocarbons Clar elabo 

rated a system of "ordinal numbers" based on the observa 

tion of a progressive shift of certain regions of the 

spectra to longer wavelengths with the addition of each 

aromatic nucleus (13, 14, 15, 16). He found that the 

position of the absorption maximum of lowest frequency, 

np 

|/p, fitted an equation of the type J—E = n, R p being a 
numerical constant and n an integer. For linear anel- 
lation of an aromatic ring, as in the case naphthalene 
—^ anthracene, n increased by 1. For angular anena¬ 
tion, as in the case naphthalene —£ phenanthrene, n 
increased by 0.5. For further increases in molecular 
size by these two types of anellation, definite changes 
in n were noted and used by Clar as an aid to synthetic 
evidence for structure. For the compounds in question

Clar gave data which qualitatively supported the relation 
of VII to IX and of IV to III, and he stated that IV 
and X were similarly related. However, in his paper (8) 
Clar reported that he was unable to isolate VI from his 
reaction mixture, and he made no mention in any of his 
papers of having obtained a sample from another labora¬ 
tory as he frequently had done for some hydrocarbons (16). 
Neither did he give an absorption curve for the compound. 
Thus it is not quite clear whether he actually did obtain 
spectroscopic data for VI. 

A sample of the red hydrocarbon obtained in 
the synthesis of D was sent to Queen's for absorption 
analysis. Thorn found that it bore considerable resem¬ 
blance to D, and that there was a slight but definite 
difference in the ordinal number n of the two compounds, 
such as would be expected for two isomers with small 
variations in structure. This would seem to bear out 
Clan's viewpoint. 

The question of structure was still uncer¬ 
tain however and a synthesis of one or more of IV, VI 
and VII involving no possibility of such rearrangments 
as characterize the Elbs pyrolysis seemed highly 
desirable. 

Two synthetic approaches were planned, the 

second of which led to the synthesis of the orange-red 
hydrocarbon and almost certainly identified it as VI:

directions of Baehmann and Boatner (18, 19), the latter 

from Jf-phenylbutyric acid according to the directions

of Hershberg and Fieser (20, 21). This acid was itself 
made using the procedures of Somerville and Allen (22) 
and Martin (23). Considerable difficulty was encountered 
in forming the Grignard reagent from the 3-bromophenan¬ 
threne and work on this , method was suspended for the 
time being while the second synthetic approach was 
attempted.

This procedure was used by Cook (17) in 
his synthesis of 1,2,7,8-dibenzanthracene from 
1-(2 f -methyl-1 f -naphthoyl)naphthalene. It has the 
advantage of giving only one acid instead of a pair of 
isomers as in the first method above. Isolation of 
Clar’s VI by the reaction series starting with Va and 
of his IV and VII starting with Vb would be practically 
conclusive evidence in favor of these structures. 

The oxidation of Va was carried out success¬ 
fully and gave a keto-acid which was characterized by

orange-red hydrocarbon from pyrolysis of Va by a mixed 
melting point determination. Conclusive evidence in 
favor of the structure VI assigned by Clar to the orange- 
red hydrocarbon was thus provided, and at the same time 
the possibility of either of the two higher-melting 
hydrocarbons having this structure was ruled out. Re¬ 
liable synthetic evidence for their structures remains 
to be furnished.

Experimental Procedure 

Melting points unless otherwise indicated 
are corrected for exposed stem. Carbon-hydrogen analy¬ 
ses were performed using the semi-micro apparatus of 
Niederl and Niederl (24). 

I. Purification of phenanthrene (6). 

Kilogram batches of Eastman 90% phenan¬ 
threne were recrystallized once from six litres of 95% 
ethanol. One kilogram of the air-dried recrystallized 
material was dissolved in 2200 cc. hot glacial acetic 
acid. Sixty g. chromic anhydride, dissolved in enough 
water to make 72 cc. solution, was added gradually to 
the boiling liquid; 30 cc. concentrated sulfuric acid 
was added slowly and the solution was refluxed 15 
minutes more and diluted with an equal volume of water. 
The cooled mixture was filtered. The solid was washed 
copiously with water and air-dried. After two re¬ 
crystallizations from ethanol the phenanthrene (about 
750 g.) melted at 98.5-99.5°. This material was used 
for the preparation of 2- and 3-acetylphenanthrenes. 

For hydrogenation the purified phenanthrene 
was further treated to remove sulfur compounds: 

Two hundred and fifty g. batches of phenanthrene 
(m.p. 98.5-99.5°) were heated in 500 cc. pyrex distilling 




















22 


flasks with 25 g. portions of sodium at 220-240° for 
four hours with frequent shaking. The black-colored 
reaction mixture was distilled directly from the flask. 
The phenanthrene came over at a constant temperature in 
the neighborhood of 320° (uncorr.). After one recrystal¬ 
lization from 95% ethanol about 500 g. phenanthrene, 
m.p. 98-99°, was obtained. 

II. Preparation of 2-(2 *-methyl-1 *-naphthoyl)phenanthrene 
(Yb) and 5- (2 ♦-methyl-1 1 -naphthoyl)phenanthrene (Ya) .

( a ) 2- and 5-Acetylphenanthrenes (4, 5, 6). 

Eighty g. batches of phenanthrene were 
acylated as follows: 

Solutions of 132 g. anhydrous aluminum 
chloride in 500 cc. nitrobenzene (Merck "pure", freshly 
distilled) and of 80 g. phenanthrene in 200 cc. nitro¬ 
benzene were mixed and cooled in an ice-bath. Forty- 
eight g. freshly distilled acetyl chloride was added 
all at once. The mixture was stirred at ice-water 
temperature for one-half hour and then was allowed to 
stand at room temperature overnight. It was hydrolyzed 
with about 400 g. ice and 80 cc. concentrated hydro¬ 
chloric acid. Following steam distillation to remove 
the nitrobenzene, the black residue was taken up in 
benzene, the benzene was removed under reduced pressure 
and the mixture of aeetylphenanthrenes vacuum distilled 
material boiling at 240-260° (20 mm.) being collected. 
(The bulk of the material distilled at 240-242° (20 mm. 
The distillate was shaken up with about 200 cc. ether 
and the insoluble 2-acetylphenanthrene filtered off and 
recrystallized from methanol. Yield, 13-16 grams, 
m.p. 143-144°. (Mosettig and van de Kamp reported 
143° (4).) 

The ether was removed under vacuum and the 
3-acetylphenanthrene vacuum distilled, giving 50-55 g. 
material, b.p. 240-242° (20 mm.). On cooling and 


















- 24 


standing this material solidified and melted at 69-72° 
(Mosettig and van de Kamp reported 73° (4).) 

The acetylphenanthrenes were used without 
further purification for the succeeding steps of the 
synthesis, 

(b) Phenanthrene-2- and phenanthrene-3-carboxylic acids (4) 

The following is a typical run for 
3-acetylphenanthrene: 

Twenty-eight hundred cc. 2% sodium hypo¬ 
chlorite was prepared by running chlorine (from potas¬ 
sium permangate and hydrochloric acid) into an aqueous 
solution of 75 g. sodium hydroxide until the weight 
increased by 56 grams. Forty g. 3-acetylphenanthrene 
was added, and the mixture boiled with vigorous mechani¬ 
cal stirring for three hours, at the end of which time 
only a small amount of solid material remained and the 
odor of chloroform was no longer perceptible. After 
cooling to room temperature, the solution was neutral¬ 
ized with 6N acetic acid. The precipitated phenanthrene- 
carboxylic acid was filtered by suction, washed copiously 
with water and air-dried. Yield, 38-40 g. white material, 
m.p. 255-265°. Further purification of the acid was 
effected by recrystallization from benzene-alcohol which

the same manner melted at 257-260°. (Mosettig and van 
de Kamp reported 258-260° (4).) 

For most of the work to follow, recrystal¬ 
lization was found to be unnecessary. 

(°) Phenanthroyl-2- and phenanthroyl-5-chlorides . 

Twenty g. of the crude phenanthrene-car- 
boxylic acid was. boiled with 100 cc. thionyl chloride 
for two hours. The thionyl chloride was removed by 
heating under vacuum on the water bath. The crude acyl 
halide, on recrystallization from benzene, yielded 
14-16 g. of the pure compound. 

The 5- and Z~ compounds melted respectively 
at 114-116° and 99-100°. (Mosettig and van de Kamp 
reported 116-117° and 101.5-102° (5).)

J. W. Cook’s procedure (25) for the con¬

or phenanthroyl-3-chloride and 10 g. 2-methylnaphthalene

was added in one hour ten g. anhydrous aluminum chloride. Stirring 
was continued three to four hours, following which the 

reaction mixture was allowed to stand overnight at room 

temperature. After hydrolysis with ice and hydrochloric 

acid the carbon disulfide and unchanged 2-methylnaph-

thalene were removed by steam distillation. The crude 
ketone was freed of phenanthrene-carboxylic acid either 
by carrying out the final part of the distillation in 
basic (sodium hydroxide) solution, or by shaking a 
benzene solution of the ketone with 10% sodium hydroxide 
In either case the ketone was dried by treating its 
benzene solution with sodium sulfate, finally the ben¬ 
zene was distilled from the filtered solution, and the 
ketone recrystallized from acetone. 

In the case of Vb further recrystallization 
from glacial acetic acid was necessary. This gave 7-8 g 
material of m.p. 183-185°. (Bachmann and Pence reported 
184-185° (3).) 

In the case of Va vacuum distillation was 
sometimes necessary before the acetone recrystallization 
7-8 g. material of m.p. 148-149° being obtained. 
(Bachmann and Pence reported 148.5-149.5° (3).) 

III. Preparation of 2-(2*-methyl-1 f -naphthoyl)- 

9,10-dihydrophenanthrene, CggHgQO. 

The same reaction sequence was used as 
in the synthesis of Va and Vb. 

(a) 9,10-Dihydrophenanthrene . 

Dr, Pepper of McGill University kindly 
hydrogenated a 367 g. batch of purified phenanthrene. 

The general conditions recommended by Mkins (26) were 














- 27 - 

used. The phenanthrene was treated in small batches, 
the following being the procedure finally adopted: 

Twenty g. phenanthrene in 50 cc. ethanol 
was hydrogenated in the presence of 2 g. copper chromite 
catalyst for two hours at 100-105°. The initial hydro¬ 
gen pressure was 2000 lb./in. 2 . The crude product 
readily crystallized upon cooling and melted only slowly 
at room temperature. A small amount re crystallized from 
methanol melted in the correct range for the 9,10- com¬ 
pound . 

From the crude hydrogenation product re¬ 
ceived from McGill, 280 g. 9,10-dihydrophenanthrene, 
b.p. 270-272° (15 mm.), was obtained by fractional dis¬ 
tillation. 

(b) 2-Acetyl-9,10-dihydrophenanthrene (10). 

To 72 g. 9,10-dihydrophenanthrene, 40 g. 
acetyl chloride and 144 cc. dry nitrobenzene (stirred 
mechanically in a 2-litre round-bottomed flask set in 
ice and water) was added over a period of thirty mi¬ 
nutes 115 g. anhydrous aluminum chloride dissolved in 
520 cc. dry nitrobenzene. The solution, after standing 
overnight at room temperature, was poured on ice and 
hydrochloric acid, and the mixture was steam distilled 
to free it of nitrobenzene. The residue was taken up 
in benzene, the benzene removed under vacuum, and the 
2-acetyl-9,10-dihydrophenanthrene vacuum distilled. 










28 


Yield, 62 g. boiling at 204-210° (2 mm.)* 

The ketone was purified through the oxime. 
Sixty g. crude 2-acetyl-9,10-dihydrophenanthrene in suf¬ 
ficient 95% ethanol to dissolve it and 60 g. sodium 
hydroxide in 220 cc. water were added to 155 g. hydro- 
xylamine hydrochloride in 220 cc. water. The mixture 
was heated with the addition of more 95% ethanol until 
all the ketone had dissolved. Water was added to 
cloudiness and the mixture clarified with a few drops 
of ethanol. The cooled solution deposited 54 g. white 
crystals, m.p. 159-142°. 

The oxime was decomposed by boiling and 
stirring with one litre of 2.5N hydrochloric acid for 
two hours. The ketone so obtained was used without 
further treatment for the succeeding reaction. 

(c) 9 > 10-Dihydrophenanthrene-2-carboxylic acid . (10). 

Nineteen g. 2-aeetyl-9,10-dihydrophenan- 
threne was treated with two litres of a solution con¬ 
taining 30 g. sodium hypochlorite for four hours at 
70°C. Vigorous stirring was maintained. The solution 
was filtered and neutralized with glacial acetic acid. 
The white precipitate was filtered off, washed copiously 
with water and air-dried. Yield, 14 g., m.p. 190-200°. 
On recrystallization from ethanol 8 g. acid, m.p. 

212-213°, was obtained. (Burger and Mosettig reported 
212.5-213.5° (10).)

There was also isolated some insoluble 
material which crystallized from acetone-water to give 
white needles, m.p. 300°. The proportion of this ma¬ 
terial increased and a yellow color made its appearance 
in the crude acid product when the oxidation was carried 


out above 70° or when hydrochloric acid was used for 


neutralization. Analysis for carbon and hydrogen indi¬

boxylic acid and 40 cc. thionyl chloride were refluxed 
on the water bath three hours. The thionyl chloride was 
removed under vacuum on the water bath, and the residue 
used directly for the next step. 

(e) 2-(2 1 -Methyl-1 f -naphthoyl)-9,10-dihydrophen- 

anthrene (Vc), CggHgQO. 

Seven g. finely powdered anhydrous aluminum 
chloride was added slowly with mechanical stirring to

7 g. crude 9,10-dihydrophenanthroyl-2-chloride and 7 g. 
2 -methylnaphthalene in 25 cc. carbon disulfide. The 
mixture was stirred five hours at 0° and was allowed to 
stand overnight at room temperature. The red solution 
was steam distilled three hours then was basified with 
sodium hydroxide and steam distilled another hour. The 
crude ketone was taken up in benzene, the benzene re¬ 
moved under vacuum and the ketone vacuum distilled, b.p. 
about 250° (5 mm.). The distillate was a gold-brown 
glass. Recrystallization from acetone-alcohol finally 
gave a white crystalline product melting at 150° to a 
turbid liquid which did not clear up completely below 
162°. Repeated recrystallization failed to give a more 
sharply melting product, and all attempts to make the 
oxime by Bachmann and Boatner’s method for highly 
hindered ketones (18) failed.

IV. preparation of A, B, C, D and Clar f s M VT W 

by pyrolysis of ketones Va, Vb and Vc . 

Pyrolyses were carried out in 15 ec. pyrex 
bulbs to which were attached necks 50 cm. long and 1 cm. 
in diameter. Water condensing during the course of 
pyrolyses was removed from time to time by brushing the 
flask neck with the bunsen flame. Reactions were con¬ 
sidered ended when no more water formed (two or three

hours), A potassium nitrate-sodium nitrite bath (27) 
heated by a bunsen burner was used to maintain the 
desired pyrolysis temperature. Vacuum sublimations and 
melting point determinations above 300° were likewise 
performed with the aid of the salt bath. 

(a) Preparation of hydrocarbon A from ketone Vb . ■ 

Vb (2 g.) was heated at 425-435° for two 
hours, and the reaction mixture shaken from the tube 
with a small amount of toluene and filtered. Sublima¬ 
tion at 325° (5 mm.) and two recrystallizations from 
toluene-xylene yielded 0.4 g. A, m.p. 383-385°. The 
analysis of A corresponded to formula (see part 

(e) of this section). 

About 0.3 g. picric acid was added to 10 cc. 
of a saturated benzene solution of A. On cooling the 
solution deposited red needles, melting at 230-233°. 
Analysis indicated the dipicrate, G 38 H 22 N 6°14 - 

(b) Preparation of hydrocarbons B and C from Vc . 

Vc (2 g.) was heated at 420-430° for two 
hours. The residue was shaken from the tube with ben¬ 
zene and filtered and washed with the same solvent. 

The 0.08 g. material so obtained was sublimed at 325-335° 
(5 mm.) and recrystallized from toluene-xylene to give 
0.066 g. almost white crystals of B, m.p. 395-398°. 
Further recrystallization raised the melting point to 
398-400°. 








f

32 


A second pyrolysis on Vc (2 g. ) was 
carried out at 460-470° for two hours. 2-Methylnaph- 
thalene refluxed up the tube in considerable quantity, 
and finally 0.4 g. was driven over into a receiver and 
characterized by its picrate, m.p. 114-115°. (Heilbron 
reports 116° (28).) The residue was washed with benzene 
and the solid material remaining (0.47 g.) sublimed and 
recrystallized twice giving 0.26 g. B, m.p. 396-398°. 
(Further purification raised the m.p. to 398-400°.) 

The mother liquor from the first recrystal¬ 
lization was concentrated and treated with picric acid. 

The red picrate so formed was decomposed with ammonium 
hydroxide and the hydrocarbon recrystallized from toluene 
to give 0.05 g. yellow crystals melting at 353-355°. 
Further recrystallizations and purifications via the 
picrate failed to change this value. Carbon-hydrogen 
analyses of B and C corresponded to the formula CggH^. 

The dipicrate of B came down from xylene as 
orange-red needles, m.p. 238-241°, and that of C from 
xylene-toluene as red needles, m.p. 234-237°. The former 
compound was quite unstable and difficult to get pure 
for an analysis. The latter compound was not analyzed 
since at first sight it appeared identical with the di¬ 
picrate of D (to be described) and later was shown to have 
originated from a mixture of B and D. Analysis of B di¬ 
picrate gave values corresponding to CggHggNgO-^. 











- 53 - 

(c) Preparation of D and Claims "VI" . 

Va (2 g.) was pyrolyzed at 420-430°, washed 
free of gummy material with acetone, and sublimed and 
recrystallized from xylene-toluene as for the other 
hydrocarbons. No trace of B was detected. D, 0.5 g., 
m.p. 350°, was a bright yellow compound, and formed a 
red dipicrate melting at 234-237°. Mixed melting point 
determinations with C gave a consistent depression of 
7-8°, while similar determinations of the two dipicrates 
gave no appreciable depression. 

VI was obtained in good yield when an 
attempt was made to vacuum distil some crude ketone Va 
at too high a pressure and temperature (water-pump 
vacuum). Pyrolysis occurred in the distillation, and 
2 g. D and 0.5 g. VI were separated from each other with 
acetone in which VI was fairly soluble. VI on recrys¬ 
tallization from ethanol-acetone melted at 248-250° 
(uncorr.). It formed an easily decomposed dipicrate which 
melted at 210-212° (uncorr.). 

Analyses for D and VI indicated formula 
c 26 h 16 an(i for tlieir pierates indicated formula C36 H 22 N 6°4* 

(d) Isolation of pure B and D from A and C . 

D was removed from samples of A and C by jj 

repeated extraction with warm benzene in which B was 
extremely insoluble. Pure B was easily obtained by 
recrystallization from xylene-toluene, as was previously 
















- 




n 













- 34 


done in the pyrolysis of ketone Vc. The benzene solu¬ 
tions were then evaporated to dryness and extracted with 
insufficient benzene to dissolve all the solid, the 
soluble material being treated in the same manner until 
a hydrocarbon was obtained which gave no mixed melting 
point depression with pure D and which gave the absorp¬ 
tion curve for Clar’s "IV". Thus A and C were shown 
conclusively to consist of B and D. 

The proportions of B and D in A and C 
indicated by the absorption spectra were checked by 
mixing B and D in these proportions and running melting 
points:

V. Attempted synthesis of the keto-carboxylic acids 
XVI and XVII from 1,2-naphthalic anhydride and 
the Grignard reagent of 5-bromophenanthrene . 

(a) 1,2-iMaphthalic anhydride . 

(The series of preparations given in 
Organic Syntheses (20, 21, 22, 23) was used.) 

-Benzoylpropionic acid was made from ben¬ 
zene and succinic anhydride in the presence of anhydrous 
aluminum chloride (22). A Clemmensen reduction was used 
to convert the acid to -phenylbutyric acid (23). This 
acid was esterified using absolute ethanol and concen¬ 
trated sulfuric acid. The ester was vacuum distilled 
and condensed with ethyl oxalate (purified by washing 
with sodium carbonate, drying with sodium sulfate and 
distilling). (The powdered sodium needed for the pro¬ 
duction of sodium ethoxide was readily made by placing 
freshly cut sodium in a pyrex bottle along with toluene, 
bringing the toluene to the boiling point and shaking 
the stoppered bottle vigorously until the temperature 
of its contents had dropped below the melting point of 
sodium.) After the separation of the condensation pro¬ 
duct, ethyl-ar-ethoxyl-y-phenylbutyrate, cyclization was 
accomplished by means of concentrated sulfuric acid (20). 
The 3,4-dihydro-l,2-naphthalic anhydride so obtained was 
dehydrogenated by fusion with sulfur (21) to 1,2-naph- 
thalic anhydride. The yields and quality of the product 
obtained corresponded with those recorded in the literature 








































37 


(b) 2- and 3-Bromophenanthrenes (18, 19). 

Fifty g. 3-acetylphenanthrene was refluxed 
three hours with 40 g. hydroxylamine hydrochloride, 

180 cc. absolute alcohol and 90 cc. pyridine. Most of 
the solvent was removed and the golden-yellow liquid was 
poured on water. The solid oxime was filtered off, dried 
overnight at 50° and rearranged with 50 g. powdered phos¬ 
phorus pentachloride in 800 cc. dry benzene by refluxing 
fifteen minutes. The reaction mixture was cooled and 
hydrolyzed and the amide mixture refluxed with 2000 cc. 
alcohol and 70 cc. concentrated hydrochloric acid for 
twenty-four hours. The alcohol was removed on the water- 
bath, the residue digested with 3000 cc. boiling water, 
and the solution filtered. Addition of ammonium hydrox¬ 
ide to the cooled filtrate precipitated 3-aminophen- 
anthrene which was filtered, washed and air-dried. Yield, 
33 g., m.p. 83-85°. (Bachmann and Boatner reported 87.5° 
(IB).) 

Three g. 3-aminophenanthrene was diazotized 
with nitrosylsulfuric acid exactly according to Bachmann 
and Boatner (19) and the diazonium solution converted to 
a double salt with 24 g. mercuric bromide and 24 g. potas¬ 
sium bromide in 400 cc. water. The yellow double salt, 
after filtering, washing and thorough air-drying was 
decomposed by heating on a sand-bath with twice its weight 
of potassium bromide. The 3-bromophenanthrene was 





- 







- 38 - 

extracted with benzene and recrystallized from alcohol. 
Yield, 1 g., m.p. 82-83°. (Bachmann and Boatner re¬ 
ported 83-85° (29).) 

(c) Attempts to form the magnesium derivative, XII, were 
unsuccessful. Addition of methyl iodide promoted a 
darkening of the solution, but the magnesium appeared to 
be unchanged. A similar failure was recorded in an 
attempt to prepare the lithium compound. 

VI. Synthesis of 1,2,9,10-dibenzotetracene (VI). 

(a) Oxidation of ketone Va to 3-(2 , -carboxy-l f -naphthoyl)- 

phenanthrene (XVI) . 

Five g. S-^-methyl-li-naphthoylJphenanthrene 
(Va), 8.5 g. selenium dioxide (twice sublimed), and 8.5 g. 
water were heated for four hours at 210° (as registered 
by the thermometer in the top of the furnace). The brown- 
black reaction product was ground up fine (the selenium 
produced had formed a hard pellet) and was boiled with 
4 g. sodium carbonate in 100 cc. water. The dark-brown 
solution was filtered from the selenium (there was no 
evidence of unchanged ketone) and acidified with dilute 
acetic acid. The gray-white precipitate was filtered by 
suction, washed copiously with water and air-dried. The 
dry material was recrystallized three times from acetic 
acid-water with the addition of Norit. It melted at 
145-150° to a murky liquid which went clear at 215°.

The acid was purified through its acetoxy- 
lactone, XX. Two g. acid, 3.5 cc. acetic anhydride and 
13 cc. pyridine were heated on the water bath for three 
hours. The material dissolved at once to give a solution 
which turned green-black over a period of one and one-half 
hours, then back to a dark amber color. Treatment with 
ice and water resulted in a white precipitate which after 
two recrystallizations from acetic acid melted at 205-206°.

(b) Reduction of 3-(2 , -carboxy-l , -naphthoyl)phenanthrene 

(XVI) to 2-carboxynaphthyl-3-phenanthrylmethane (XVTII) , 

A mixture of 0,5 g. XVT and 3.5 g. zinc dust 
was heated in 75 cc, normal potassium hydroxide solution 
at the boiling point for twenty-four hours. The mixture 
was filtered by ordinary filtration and washed with water. 
Acidification with acetic acid gave a white granular 
precipitate (0.4 g.) which had an indefinite melting point ' 
of about 200 °.

(XVIII) to l,2,7,8-dibenzo-5-tetranthrone (XXI) and 
aromatization of XXL to 1,2,9,10-dibenzotetracene (VI) . 

An intimate mixture of 0.4 g. XVIII and 
1.5 g. zinc chloride was heated at 180-185° for thirty 
minutes, during which time it changed to a brown liquid 
which rapidly stiffened and formed a brittle mass on 
cooling. This material was extracted with dilute sodium 
carbonate solution to remove unchanged acid, and was 
finally filtered and washed with water. The precipitate 
was treated for three hours with 1.5 g. zinc dust in 
boiling normal sodium hydroxide solution. After filtra¬ 
tion all solid organic material was readily separated 
from the zinc dust with acetone. The acetone was removed 
by evaporation, leaving an orange-red residue of m.p. 
230-255° (uncorr.). This material was sublimed at 260° 

(2 mm.). It melted at 248-250° (uncorr.) and the melting 
point of a mixture of the compound with the orange-red 
hydrocarbon isolated from the pyrolysis product of Va 
was also 248-250° (uncorr.). No trace of any hydrocarbon 
except VI was detected in the acetone mother liquor or 
zinc residue.

Summary 

An attempt was made to synthesize 1,2,7,8- 
dibenzotetracene (IV), a compound necessary for the 
partial testing of Bergmann's theory of carcinogenic 
activity. 

By the pyrolysis of a number of o-methylaryl 
ketones, three hydrocarbons were isolated. These were 
shown by means of absorption spectra, melting points and 
general description to be identical with three hydro¬ 
carbons to which Clar assigned the structures 1,2,9,10- 
dibenzotetracene (VI), 1,2,7,8-dibenzotetracene (IV), and 
3,4,9,10-dibenzotetraphene VII* The pyrolysis of one 
of the ketones, Vc, was of especial interest since it 
involved not only ring closure with loss of water, but 
also dehydrogenation. 

Since some doubt as to the certainty of the 
hydrocarbon structures assigned by Clar was entertained, 
their synthesis by methods involving no possibility of 
rearrangments was planned and partially completed. The 
synthetic route chosen which seemed most promising in¬ 
volved the formation and cyclization of keto-carboxylic 
acids such as 3(2 , -carboxy-l , -naphthoyl)-phenanthrene 
which was made from 3(2*-methyl-1 1 -naphthoyl)phenanthrene 
by selenious acid oxidation. The ketone group was 





42 


successfully reduced with zinc and alkali, the resulting 
acid cyclized to the enthrone with zinc chloride, and 
aromatization to 1,2,9,10-dibenzotetracene (VI) with 
zinc and alkali carried out. This compound was identi¬ 
fied by a mixed melting point determination with Clar f s 
VI. Complete synthetic confirmation of the structures 
of the two remaining hydrocarbons has yet to be provided.
