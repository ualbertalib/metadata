THE EOKiaTION OF AN ULTEA-SOHIG BEAM. 


Ultra-sonic waves, as the name implies, are longitudinal 
waves of pitch above the limit of audibility. Ordinary sound 
waves in air or water have a length, roughly, from five or six 
centimetres to thirty metres, whereas the wave-lengths of the 
ultra-sonic energy are below the length of the shortest audible 
waves of sound. It was convenient in the experiments here des¬ 
cribed to measure frequencies rather than wave-lengths and the 
values used ranged from fifty thousand to two hundred thousand 
cycles per second. Converting these into lengths of wave in the 
medium employed, viz., water, the velocity of ultra-sonic radia¬ 
tion in water being 1.6 x lO^cms./sec. we have a range of wave¬ 
lengths in the experiment from 3.0 to 0.75 cms. 

With waves of this nature it was expected that some similarity 
of behavior would be found both to audible sound waves of much 
greater wave-length and also to light waves whose wave-lengths 
are very much less. This was found to be the case, for inter¬ 
ference and diffraction effects have been demonstrated and in¬ 
vestigated, and also the more common effects of reflection and 
refraction. But unlike ordinary sound ultra-sonic energy is 
transmitted mostly in a definite direction providing that the 
face of the radiating transmitter is large in linear dimensions 
compared with the ultra-sonic wave-length. Under such conditions 
in the ideal case the same laws may be expected to apply as in 
the case of the passage of plane waves of light through a small 
aperture. 

















It will easily be seen that the wave-lengths used in 
ultra-sonic work are very convenient for experimental investi¬ 
gation, for they have neither the long wave-lengths of ordinary 
sound, nor the extremely short wave-lengths of visible light. 

The former are so long that transmission and reception 
devices used in the laboratory are small compared with a wave¬ 
length. On the other hand the extremely short waves of light 
are too small to be comparable in size with the dimensions of 
any instrument, and on that account many types of experimental 
investigation are precluded, e.g. the distribution of energy 
by diffraction close to a pin-hole - i.e,. only a few wave-lengths 
away. 

A previous study of the types of ultra-sonic transmitters 

had been made, and of the energy distribution from them at some 

distance from the radiating face.^ Also some qualitative work 

had been carried out she?/ing, as simple diffraction theory would 

indicate, that the energy distribution close to the transmitter 

2 

is not at all uniform. But the results of this survey were 
not sufficiently definite, and it was difficult to discover the 
actual direction or change of direction of the maximum and mini¬ 
mum positions of energy. Maxima and minima of energy were found 
to exist along the geometrical axis of the ultra-sonic beam near 
the transmitter, but it could not be concluded whether or not 
these were an approximation to the mathematical diffraction 
theory. It is this section of the work virhich this report attempts

to cover somewhat in detail. As has been mentioned previously, 
the convenient wave-lengths in use greatly facilitate this process. 

The problem to he considered is the investigation of the 
distribution of energy close to its source, i.e. within thirty 
or forty wave-lengths of the transmitting face. No mathematical 
treatment has been given of the distribution of energy off the 
geometrical axis within such distances, but w i t h^' 

»- o»>-> 

using irresnel diffraction theory, the position of maximum and 

minimum points of energy on the axis may be computed. values 

plotted against distance from the transmitter face -are shewn in 

/N 

the graphs on plate YI. The values were taken from a paper by 
Professor Smith in the Proceedings of the Royal Society of Canada.^ 
These intensities were obtained using a wave-length of 
centimetre, and though the wave-length used in the experimental 
curves shewn herewith is over a centimetre, nevertheless the 
theoretical curve should act as a guide. 

In the optical, analogous, case Yerdet has calculated the 
intensity at a distance of a large number of wave-lengths from 
the aperture. He was able by making some assumptions to calcu¬ 
late the intensity over the field in planes parallel to the source. 
If a distance of some ten centimetres from the optical aperture 
could be considered great enough for this work, the corresponding 
distance in the case of ultra-sonics would be of the order of two 
kilometres. He found rings of maxim.um and minimum intensities 
and ooraputed thei£ position and saieifc withir) fhtm.

The purpose of the presenlj paper is to investigate experimen¬ 
tally the distribution of energy from the transmitting face or 
"aperture" and to compare the results with those given mathematically 
in the ideal case. 

The apparatus used in generating energy of these v/ave-lengths 
consists of an ultra-sonic transmitter and an electric circuit for i 
exciting it. The transmitter depends upon the property of piezo¬ 
electricity possessed by hemihedral crystals. In this case the 
crystals used were quartz. It has been found that quartz slabs | 

cut perpendicularly to an electric axis of the crystal exhibit 
this property. If a pressure is applied to the face of the slab, 
opposite electric charges appear on the opposite surface, and con¬ 
versely, if a charge is given to the surface, the crystal dilates 
or contracts according to the sign of the charge. It is upon this 
converse effect that the generation of the ?(/aves depends. 

A circuit of high frequency alternating e.m.f. is used and a 
rapidly alternating voltage is imposed on the quartz, thereby 
producing a succession of dilations and contractions within it. 

These set up condensations and rarefactions in the surrounding 
medium in contact, thus creating in it longitudinal waves. 

The specimens of quartz which may be obtained are, at best, 
imperfect. I’or a given pressure, the charge liberated is not 
equal for all points on the surface and furthermore it is possible 
to get charges of opposite signs on spots quite close together on 
the same plate. The latter is due to twinning of the right and 
left handed varieties of qua.rtz. For these reasons each piece 
of quartz cut from a crystal must be tested over its entire surface.

and its charge for a given pressure compared with a standard., 
Specimens shewing at least 75 per cent of the charge of the 
standard may be retained. When transmitters are large in dia¬ 
meter, the quartz plates are not large enough for one piece to 
form a whole transmitting disc, and accordingly a mosaic of 
separate pieces must be built up to compose the whole active plate. 

The transmitter in use during the present experiments con- 

Ok-t^d try dm.rne.fcr', 

sisted of a mosaic 0.6 cm. in thickness^as above described, and 
shewn in Flatten I , backed by a steel plate 4.14 cm. thick. It 
had a resonance point of mechanical longitudinal vibration at a 
frequency of about sixty thousand cycles per second and also at 
one hundred and twenty and one hundred and eighty thousand. 

The variation of energy emission with frequency is exceedingly 
important, and hence for each instrument a "characteristic*’ curve 
is taken which consists of readings of energy intensities on a 
frequency base throughout the range of frequencies to be used. 

The ordinates of the curve shewn here are intensities and not 
amplitudes and do not express the total energy emission since 
at lower frequencies the energy is distributed over greater angles. 
The characteristic is shewn along with the design of the trans¬ 
mitter. 

On account of the great variation in ultra-sonic emission 
with frequency, the latter must very often be checked. For this 
purpose a Hertzian Wave-meter was used in the usual manner. 
Furthermore care must be taken to operate at some point on the 
instrument characteristic where small fluctuations in frequency 
have no great effect on the energy emission. It was therefore

necessary to check up the characteristic in the vicinity of the 
working frequency to hecome assured that such was the case, This 
fact necessitated that the point of operation be a maximum or a 
minimum and this may be noticed in the frequencies chosen for use. 

J'or the first set of readings the frequency was set at 147,000 
and by reference to the characteristic curve of the transmitter 
(Plate I) it will be seen that this frequency is at a minimum point 
and slight changes in the frequency will not affect the energy 
field to any extent. 

Since the quartz plate is not of uniform quality the beam 
itself YJill not be uniform, and hence the results obtained cannot 
be expected to represent the possible result under the ideal con¬ 
dition of a perfectly uniform transmitting face. The quartz plate 
or mosaic together with the metal plate backing it in the trans¬ 
mitter will have a natural period of mechanical longitudinal vib¬ 
ration, and when the applied e.m.f. is of this frequency, the 
plate will be strongly excited into a resonant vibration which 
will tend to smooth out the irregularities of emission of the 
transmitter face. 

hiWh 

The source of g c fcfe e rna t la g e.m.f. was an ordinary oscillating 
circuit as used in wireless, and may best be explained by the use 
of a diagram. Both plate and grid circuits were tuned. The 
frequency was varied by changing the position of the lead from the 
oscillating circuit inductance to the transmitter, ?;hile the plate

filameiib voltage of about 15 and a plate voltage of 2000. 

The oscillating circuit consisted of a variable inductance, j 
(i.e., a tapped coil), and a condenser, the transmitter itself. 

The metal plate of the transmitter formed one side of the condenser, 
while the medium in contact with the quartz (in this case, water), 
formed the other aide, which was grounded. The input to the 
0 SC iliatingleould be obtained from three sources, two of which 
were A.C. and one of P.C. The latter was usually used in experi¬ 
ments as much finer voltage control could be obtained. The former 
two sources were different in frequency, one being the ordinary 
lighting circuit at 60 cycles, end the other being at a frequency 
of 600 cycles. From voltages of 110 these are transformed up to 
2200. In practice t?/o transformers are used with the mid”Point 
of the secondaries grounded. Between these transformers and the 
plate, two rectifying valves convert this alternating potential 
to a pulsating, uni-directional e.m.f. Since two rectifiers are 
used the pulsations occur at twice the frequency of the alternating 
e.m.f. 

When operating with A.C. excitation from the line, the only 
control over the voltage is obtained by the regulation of filament 
heating in the oscillators and rectifiers. With the I)«G. machine, 
the field of the generator may be varied and also the speed of 
the meter. Thus for steady conditions of high frequency voltage 
on the transmitter the B.C. was used. Changes from one poY^er 
source to another merely meant the shifting of a switch point. 

In setting the oscillating circuit to a resonance frequency, 
the power was drawn from the sixty cycle A.C. source and the

listener, described later, was used. The maximum sound inten¬ 
sity, as the frequency was vatied, gave the resonant peak. This 
frequency was then determined and the circuit excited by D.C. at 
the voltage desired. Usually the greatest permissible voltage 
v/as used to obtain the best figures, and this is indicated on 
the diagrams. Foic points other than resonant points the circuit 
was set at approximately the right frequency and tuned by a 
variometer to the point as indicated by the instrument charac¬ 
teristic. 

To detect the ultra-sonic energy three methods are in use 
at present. These do not overlap in their use, for each is 
available for a particular type of investigation. 

The first of these is a qualitative test, at most only 

roughly comparative, but nevertheless convenient for preliminary

work and saving time. A diagram is shewn in . The 

device is in the form of a listening tube and consists of a small 
ring of aluminium 1.2 cm. in outside diameter and 3 mm. in thick¬ 
ness, covered on each side by a very thin disc of mica, fsee 
Plate III). A radial hole is made in the ring and a brass tube 
is soldered over it, whose other extremity is attached to s 
stethescope. The ?t/hole is made water tight. When placed in the 
beam it forms a complete discontinuity and thus causes reflection 
from its surface by means of which the beam is detected as will 
be explained immediately. 

It is, of course, quite impossible to hear vibrations whose 
frequency is far out of the audible limit, but it is not these 
vibrations which are detected. As has been mentioned before.

the circuit may be excited by means of an A.C. source. The 
Source usually used was the lighting line. This, when recti¬ 
fied gives a pulsating uni-directional potential of frequency 
120. This causes a variation of intensity in the high frequency 
oscillations in a series of pulses called a "tonic train" which 
may be detected in the telephones of the Hertzian wave-meter 
or in the listening tube when placed in the ultra-sonic beam. 

The frequency of the note detected will be 120. This device 
vms used, as mentioned above, to determine when the transmitter 
was actually in resonance, as it was only at the resonant fre¬ 
quencies that the energy intensity was of sufficient strength 
to be audible in the stethescope. It was also used in conjunc¬ 
tion with the following quantitative method in locating the 
peak of the beam. 

It }ias been found possible to obtain figures shewing nodal 
and antinodal lines by sprinkling dust in the beam.^ This dust

thus indicating the maximum and minimum of energy in the 

field. This method was used in obtaining the distribution near 
the face of the instrument where, at the resonant points of the 
transmitter the energy density was sufficient to cause the par¬ 
ticles to fall in fairly sharply defined areas, shewing areas 
of minimum and maximum intensities. The particles used were 
cinders which were passed through a forty mesh and retained by 
a sixty mesh sieve.

A few outstanding precautions must be taken in carrying out 
the experiments and these will be mentioned. In previous work 
it had been found necessary to put in screens at the end of the 
tank to prevent the beam from being reflected back along its own 
path and forming stationary waves. In this experiment this v;as 
important, for the formation of such waves would distort the 

Fif?TE ^ 

figures desired, fhe screens^were made of wood sheeted with 
galvanized iron and painted. These ?/ere set in at the end of 
the tank remote from the transmitter at an angle of 45*^ ?;ith the 
end of the tank and trapped most of the energy in the spaces 
between the screens by causing multiple reflections. Stationary 
waves were found near the screens parallel to the screens but 
none parallel to the back of the tank, at any appreciable dis¬ 
tance from it. 

r'or quantitative measurements a torsion pendulum was found 
to be the most satisfactory. By means of the pressure of radia¬ 
tion in the ultra-sonic ?/ave train the pendulum is deflected 
and this deflection is measured by twisting the suspension until 
the pendulum returns to its normal position of zero deflection 
and noting the t\¥ist required by the rotation of a pointer at¬ 
tached. Variable control was obtained by different types of 
suspension. 

The pendulums used were of t¥;o types, first a double vane 
pendulum made of a solid metal disc, hung vertically from one 
side, and balanced by a similar horizontal disc acting as a 
counterpoise, for which a correction had to be applied; second

a single vane light hollow pendulum similar to the listening 
capsule fastened on the suspension without any counterpoise. 

The former was hung from above, since its own weight caused 
it to sink into position, while the suspension in the latter 
case was fixed at both extremities,, for a tension V7as needed 
to keep the light pendulum in position and to afford means of 

average. 

control. Since the^specific gravity of the light pendulum was 
nearly one, no counterpoise was needed. In the first mentioned 
type the mass was considerable due to the necessity of having a 
thickness sufficient to reflect most of the energy, and the re¬ 
sult was a long natural period of vibration, and hence delay in 
obtaining readings. The light type was very highly damped and 
came to rest almost without any vibration. This advantage led 
to its being used in most of the Y/ork, while there was no uncer¬ 
tain correction for the counterpoise necessary in the metal vane. 
The double vane pendulum was made with lead vanes; it v/as m-ore 
sensitive than the single vane type, but this advantage v/as more 
than counter-balanced by the quick period of the light pendulum 
Y/hich so greatly facilitates the taking of long sets of readings. 
This allowed of mor e constant conditions during the periods of 
observation. Another advantage in using the mica vane is the 
lack of the counter poise ?;hieh must be kept in the weals: part 
of the field, necessitating the reversal of the heavy pendulum 
when crossing the field. 

The supports for the suspension of the single vane pendulum 
needed to be quite clear of the beam, for even a small obstacle 






in the beam was found to cause very definite stationaries. These 
would cause trouble, as the pendulum readings v/ould be affected 
and the true field would be disturbed. 

By means of the moveable stand shewn in Plate III, the posi¬ 
tion of the pendulum may be moved to any part of the energy field. 

In a previous paper,^ it was found that for a given thickness 
of pendulum, the energy reflected was some function of the ratio 
of the diameter to the wave-length. By reference to this paper 
a suitable diameter was chosen for the wave-length used, and will 
be considered in detail later. 

The upper end of the p.b. suspension was fastened t© a torsion 
head v;ith a pointer and scale. The following was the procedure in 
an experiment. The pendulum was set with its vane parallel to the 
face of the transmitter and observed through a telescope with a 
cross hair in the eye-piece also parallel to the transmitter face. 

A reading of the pointer is taken and the po?/er is turned on the 
transmitter. The pendulum deflects and the torsion head is turned 
to counter balance the effect of radiation pressure. When once 
more at its zero position a reading is taken and the difference is 
called the pendulum deflection. The null method eliminated the 
effect known as the Haleigh Disc effect. This is the name given 
to the tendency of a suspended body to set itself broadside to the 
streamlines of the ?/ave motion. Eecently experiments were under¬ 
taken to show that this effect was noticeable on a circular lead 
pendulum hung by a single suspension from the top. However since

in the present readings the pendulum is in the position normal to 
the streamlines both at first and after the deflection, this effect 
need not further be considered. 

The deflection obtained is proportional to the radiation pres¬ 
sure whicln is proportional to the energy intensity, for the 
radiatiocpressure P = E E, if the reflection is total, and the 

torque T = Pa£, where ”a” is radius of pendulum. But torque

The transmitter must be vertical so that its radiated 
ultra-sonic beam does not hit either the surface of the water, 
or the bottom of the tank, for here again stationaries ¥i/ould 
result. When a set of readings is to be taken the voltage across 
the transmitter must be noted carefully, for the deflection varies 
directly as its square. Voltages were usually kept as nearly 
constant as possible by regulating the input to the valves. The 
presence of one of the experimenters very near the circuit some¬ 
times affected the frequency slightly, and although in most oases 
the change was negligible, it was considered advisable to remain 
at some distance from the circuit. 

The transmitter and screens being placed in position as 
nearly as possible according to the foregoing remarks, a table 
was placed in front of it horizontally as shevm, (Plate IV). 

This allowed the dust to come to rest in the energy field, and 
since the height of the table could be varied the best position 
could be obtained. As for the best height of the table, t?/o 
ideas were considered; first, if the table were fixed at the

centre of the active face the particles would settle in a field 
of maximum energy and give sharp definition. Again it was thought 
that by lowering the platform so that the particles would pass 
completely through the energy field before coming to rest that 
they would have more time to settle into the lines of minimum 
energy. Neither of these positions gave the best figures, for 
the former brought the dust to rest too soon while in the latter 
position the dust began to spread out after passing through the 
field. Hence a mean position was used which gave the figures 
shewn. 

The photographs will hardly shew the true longitudinal beam 
section, as the platform on which the figures were formed was of 
galvanized iron and reflections from its surface certainly inter¬ 
fered with the beam to a certain extent. On the other hand the 
figures certainly are approximately similar -to the actual con¬ 
ditions for they check fairly well with the sections obtained 
quantitatively. 

Attempts were made to obtain dust figures at four different 
frequencies, but satisfactory figures for photographing were ob¬ 
tained at only two of these. Hirst-attempts were made at the 
fundamental resonant peak of the instrument, viz., 60,000 cycles, 
but though here we get the greatest output, the energy is dis¬ 
tributed over a wider beam and hence the particles were not suf¬ 
ficiently acted on by the beam to give sharp and well-defined 
figures. However using the instrument at the second and third 
resonant peaks, the ener^ was more concentrated and intensity 






was thereby increased, since the angle of spread is much less 
(given approximately by sin 6 - 1.^where <9 is the half angle 
of the beam). Good figures were obtained at both these frequen¬ 
cies, shewing the main beam and a number of side beams. The 
energy beams being nearly free from the dust particles shewed up 
as white streaks on the painted tin background. The minimum zones 
are shewn as the black areas along which the particles actually 
settled. The figures shew remarkable symmetry considering the 
imperfections of the instruments, the energy being distributed on 
all sides of the geometrical axis of the beam. 

The figures distinctly shew that most of the energy is con¬ 
fined to the central or main beam, the side beams becoming indis¬ 
tinguishable beyond about thirty cms. As a matter of fact they 
still continue and may be further traced by the more sensitive 
means of torsion pendulum measurements. 

The trace of the zones may be definitely observed to be 
practically straight lines inclined at some angle to the geometric 
axis, and do not curve to form closed surfaces of revolution 
about this axis. Variations of intensity passing through maximum 
and minimum values were noted approximately along the beam axis 
and these seemed to be the sources of the nodal surfaces and lines. 

The photographs shew that some of these nodal surfaces and 
lines definitely start at the face of the transmitter and no doubt 
they actually exist even inside the instrument. This is to be 
expected since multiple internal reflections must occur, and 
these would account for nodal lines and surfaces by interference 
actually within the steel disc and quartz plate.

By rotating this figure about its axis of symmetry, the solid 
of revolution would give the rings of maximum and minimum energy. 

To make this more clear it was decided to attempt to obtain a 
cross-section photograph of the beam. The transmitter was^with 
its face horizO'ntal and facing upward. A celluloid tray was 
placed parallel to the face and directly above it. Since the 
product of wave-length and density in celluloid and water is very 
nearly the same it was known that this tray would not distort the 
energy field. T’igures were actually obtained but they i^ere not 
sufficiently v/ell-defined to make a good photograph. The figures 
indicated the presence of rings but these v/ere very imperfect. 

This imperfection may have been due to interference in the settling 
due to the stationeries from the surface. The latter were shewn 
to exist by placing at an angle to the horizontal and sifting the 
cinders on it afterwards slightly tapping the tray. A number of 
positions were tried but the only figures which were photographed 
were the ones formed right on the transmitter face. Even these 
only shew slight traces of the zonal formation in a series of 
spots of minimum intensity. They do shew, however, that the radia¬ 
tion with which the experiments were done was anything but uniform 
at the face of the transmitter. The frequencies tried were the 
same as in the other figures.

In connection with these figures it was also noted that at 
some distances the centre of the figure was a minimum spot, while 
at another distance the centre seemed a maximum. As soon as the 
distance was increased beyond about twenty centimetres from the 
face of the instrument the traces of zones disappeared and only a 
dust free spot in the centre shewed the central beam. This 
checks with the other figures and also with the later quantitative 
work. 

T’or the quantitative survey the single vane pendulum, as 
previously described was used. The suspension was phosphor-bronze 
strip 0.0015” wide. The transmitter was set up Y^ith its active 
face vertical as in the first part of the experiment, with the 
radiation in such a direction that the ener^ was dissipated at 
the far end of the tank, by the screens. See Plate IV. 

The first set of readings ?/as taken at a non-resonant fre-“ 
quency of the transmitter. This gave small deflections which were 
easily measured and also gave the distribution of energy when the 
transmitter v;as not in resonance, so that it might be compared with 
a later set of readings which were taken at a resonant peak. 

In order that the pendulum might be as sensitive as possible 
to the radiation which it was to measure, and also to give correct 
determinations of energy, it ?ms necessary to consider its diameter, 
or, rather, the ratio of its diameter to the length of the energy 
wave. The best diameter was chosen to suit the range of frequen- . 
cies through which it Yms expected to work. The diameter was ob¬ 
tained from the accompanying curve in Plate V which was obtained 
and which gave the relation between pendulum diameter divided by

wave-length, and the ae-at M ft.rtprnd.uQ.e^> The maximum of this 
curve was broad and hence a choice of this nature was possible 
without sacrificing much sensitivity. The diameter used was 
1.2 cm. 

The first problem to be attempted v/as a series of readings 
along the axis of the main beam. A first glance at the photo¬ 
graphs shewed the general direction of the axis and a trial by 

device 

means of the listen^ijj^located the peak roughly. To aid in this

beam^. To make more certain ?7here the maximum reading and hence 
presumably the beam peak was located, several readings were taken 
horizontally across the beam and by constructing the curve of 
instrument readings on a base of horizontal scale position the 

i 

peak could be obtained in magnitude and position. Starting at a 
distance of one hundred centimetres from the transmitter, readings 
were obtained every four centimetres until a point about 1.5 cm. 
from the face of the instrument was reached. These maximum def¬ 
lections were plotted (See Plate VI, 2), as ordinates against 
distance from the transmitter as abscissae, and thus shewed 

, the ener^ distribution near the geometrical axis 

of the beam. 

To complete the survey at this frequency both vertical and 
horizontal sections were taken at the apparent maximum and minimum 
points. These horizontal sections are included in the diagram of the; 
completed survey Plate VII, and are shewn herewith. The vertical

ones are similar, and tables of value covering these are appended. 
Considering the section taken closest to the transmitter, a number 
of irregular peaks may be noticed; even the central peak has a cleft 
in it. Very little indication of symmetry exists near the trans¬ 
mitter. This is true both horizontally and vertically. As the 
position of the section recedes from the transmitter they become 
more symmetrical in form and more and more does the energy seem 
concentrated in the central beam. 

It was expected that irregular sections would be obtained at 
this frequency, especially close to the transmitter, for each part 
of the quartz mosaic was giving energy of an intensity peculiar to 
itself since the metal block in the instrument was not in resonance. 

Therefore to discover if these heterogeneous effects would be 
eliminated, or partly eliminated, it was decided to repeat the 
foregoing procedure at a new frequency which ¥/ould be a resonant 
frequency of the steel disc behind the quartz. 

The best peak for this second set of readings was determined 
to be the second resonant point harmonic, at 130,000 approzimately, 
for the energy density permitted the use of fairly high voltages 
across the transmitter and hence a fair total energy. To obtain 
readings which were not too large to manage, the operating voltage 
was decreased to 5£5 volts. 

The expected positions of the peak readings at each distance 
from the transmitter, were obtained as in the previous case, fi.e. 
by obtaining peak readings at tv^^o distant points and interpolating). 
But to commence v/ith, a complete set of readings at half centimetre 
intervals were taken vertically and horizontally in front of the 
face. The horizontal section shewed a very strong central beam 









( 20 ) 


and a much weaker beam to one side. In the vertical section the 
curve was quite symmetrical about the axis of the main beam. 

Upon moving out from the transmitter it v/as noted that the 
peak was becoming less in intensity and that the subsidiary peak 
was increasing. This effect may best be explained by reference to 
the complete set of sections shewn, (Plate VII). On account of 
this effect it was deemed advisable to take horizontal sections 
covering the main part of the beam each time and not merely the 
peak reading. The result of this procedure shews quite a different 
set of conditions than heretofore supposed. It distinctly shews 
that the central beam does not form, as such, until some distance 
has been passed over. By a closer inspection of the photographs 
obtained it ?/ill be seen that the central energy portion is made 
up of several beams each at a slight angle with the geometric 
axis and each dying out as its successor commences. This effect 
is not noticeable beyond about thirty centimetres in the cases 
considered. Their positions vary with the frequency of the energy. 

By comparing the sections in Plate VII taken across the face 
of the transmitter at the two frequencies, it will be seen that 
the assumption that the energetic vibration of the plate in reso¬ 
nance would smooth out the irregularities, v/as well founded, as, 
although the general distribution was found similar, fi.e. the 
presence of a main central beam), the absence of great irregulari¬ 
ties characterized the second set. But the effect of non-uni¬ 
formity of transmitting face, as far as the symmetry of the beam 
is concerned, does not seem to extend very far from, the transmitter.

N.B. These 

readings have been taken 

from the 

peaks of the 

curves 


shewn in Plate VII. 





















A plot of maximum readings was also made for the resonant 
frequency, and this is shewn in the lower graph on Plate VI. 

No comparison must he made between the ordinates of the different 
graphs as conditions were not the same. The position of maximum 
and minimum intensities may be compared. The top curves are cal¬ 
culated by using two values for the obliquity factor. It may be 
seen that the position of the maximum and minimum intensities do 

or* 

not change even when the obliquity^ is changed. In fact, the posi¬ 
tions computed from the simple zone theory also coincide with the 
points plotted until the third minimum point is reached. 

It V7ill be seen at a glance that the experimental curves 
are not of the same type as the theoretical curves, particularly 
the non-resonant one, and by computing the positions of maximum 
and minimum intensities for the wave-lengths used, from the 
formula given by simple diffraction theory d = (kVn - n/4)> 
where k = it was found that they do not coincide even ap¬ 
proximately. Furthermore there are neither the required number 
of maximum points nor are the maximum points on the geometric 
axis of the beam. 

But it is not to be expected that the actual determinations 

would check with esperimental values. Conditions are far from 

ideal. In place of a beam "of uniform intensity we have shewn

Instead of a source at which every part of the beam is in the same 
phase, it is quite apparaent that with a transmitter of finite 
thickness and many discontinuities multiple reflections must be

present and hence the phase of vibration at the emitting surface 
will not be constant over the face. It would be surprising in 
the face of these difficulties if the experimental figures did 
approximate those of theory. 

It is interesting to note that if we add a distance about 
equal to the thickness of the transmitter to the distances of the 
maximum and minimum points observed in the case of resonant fre-

This is quite a remarkable agreement. The remaining maximum 
and minimum points may be within the transmitter and as a number 
of the zonal formations in the dust figures do appear to come 
from points inside the face this does seem a possible explanation.

Verdet worked, the results here cited were not obtained at a 
sufficient distance to make the assumptions ?/hioh were made in

This couples the work of fresnel to that of Verdet and shews 
what distribution of energy may be expected in the hitherto un¬ 
explored sections of the beam, where the mathematical analysis 
has not so far been completed. 





















PART II. 


The Verdet Beam 


In Part I of this report it has been found that the ultra¬ 
sonic beam consists of a central conical beam of great intensity 
surrounded by concentric beams of wider angles whose intensities 
are relatively small. 

For the optical analogous case,the distribution of energy 
in these beams has been deduced by Verdet,^ for a distance of 
many wave-lengths from* the source of energy and such that ob¬ 
liquity may be neglected. He assumes a plane wave of uniform 
phase over the entire aperture. 

Taking the centre of the aperture as origin, the following 
formula gives the relative intensity of energy at a point whose 
angular distance is B from the axis of the beam, using the centre 
of the aperture as the pole. 



X = wave-length of the radiation under consideration. 

R = radius of the opening, 
m = IT R sin ^ 

H = constant. 

This value becomes alternately positive and negative as m 
increases and hence passes through zero values. Thus, circular 
zones of energy are traced out on the plane. 

The intensity of energy in all the zones except the central 
one is very small indeed and in this report it is merely the 
central zone or beam to w'hich attention 7^ill be drawn.

The angle 0 which gives the first zero value in the optical 
case is found to he given by 

sin 0 = 1.2 D = diameter of aperture. 

wave-length. 

Since the theoretical considerations applied by Verdet in 
the optical case may apply also to ultra-sonics, notwithstanding 
the difference in the types of these radiations, it v;as desired 
to compare the energy distribution given by the above formula with 
that found experimentally with ultra-sonics. 

Tv;o sets of readings vjere obtained, one with a double vane 
lead pendulum, similar to those used in previous experiments 

whose diameter of vane was 1.5 cms. and thickness 0.15 
cm., and a second with a hollovi/ vane pendulum of the same diameter 
and 3.0 millimetres in thickness. 

The former pendulum required a correction for its horizontal 
counterpoise vane, and this has been applied as in the previous 
work. The sections w;ere taken at a distance of 81 cms. from the 
face of a single plate transmitter of diameter 15.2 cms., operating 
at a frequency of 131,500 cycles per second w/hich was resonant 
frequency of the instrument. 

The resulting intensities have been plotted (Plate IX) on the 
same base with the theoretical values obtained for the optical case 
by Verdet. It will be seen that the agreement is very close, par¬ 
ticularly for the hollov/ vane. Results here obtained agree ?;ith 
those of Lehmann^ who worked under similar conditions with a 
double-vaiB pendulum, but with a different transmitter and at

different frequencies. 

It must be remembered that the conditions of ultra-sonic 
emission at the face of a practical general are not ideal, for 
the intensity of vibration and its distribution close to the 
source is not uniform. This has been shewn in Part I of this 
report. It also follows from the fact that the quartz slices 
making up the generating quartz mosaic are not of uniform piezo¬ 
electric quality; and since undoubtedly there are multiple re¬ 
flections within the back metal plate of the transmitter itself - 
it is certain that the two ideal conditions of vibration in the 
optical case - viz., that all points of the aperture are vibrat¬ 
ing fl) with the same intensity and (2) in the same phase and 
cannot here be strictly applied. But it has been shevTn in this 
report that the beam at some little distance from the face of the 
instrument becomes much more uniform. It has been shewn also that 
by throwing the vibrating plate of the instrument into mechanical 
resonance much of the irregularity and lack of uniformity due to 

the inequalities of the quartz face are smoothed out. Thus, under 

that 

these conditions the curves of Plate IX shew/the relative inten¬ 
sities in the ultra-sonic beam at any appreciable distance from 
the transmitter may be calculated with fair accuracy from Verdet^s 
theoretical formula. 

However, it must be stated that in all cases ?;here the energy 
intensities in the main beam have checked closely with the computed 
values, the transmitter had been made with a definite circular 
radiating face which was made to vibrate freely without at the 
same time causing the face of the casing of the instrument also

vibrate. In oases where such designs were not adopted, although 
definite ultra-sonic beams were generated, they did not follow the 
distribution of energy as given by Verdet*s formula.^ In the pre¬ 
sent instance the quartz disc was circular in shape, and the whole 
circular face was free to vibrate directly into the water as in 
the oases which had in previous work indicated that Verdet^s 
formula would hold. 

The accompanying curves also shew in the satisfactory prac¬ 
tical agreement of the results ?;ith both single vane and double 
vane pendulums, that either of these devices may safely be used 
for the delineating of an ultra-sonic beam and for measurements 
of ultra-sonic energy intensity, and that results of measurements 
so obtained are not dependent on the type of pendulum used. 

GOXPFISH SXPSSBISNT . 

Here an incidental experiment may be mentioned briefly. 

Certain experiments have been reported privately that intense 
ultra-sonic radiation caused a physiological effect on some types 
of small fish, causing them to be acutely shocked or even killed. 
The effect was tried here of placing the fish in a thin celluloid 
box which is quite transparent to ultra-sonic energy and placing 
this in the path of the ultra-sonic beam. Eight varieties of gold¬ 
fish were used, and the frequency was varied from 60,000 to 170,000 
with voltages of 5800 to 1000 across the transmitter. No visible 
discomfort to the fish or any effect whatever was apparent. The 
tests only covered a short period, and the energy intensity in the 
beam was not very high.

PAET III. 


REHiSCTIOH OP UliTEA-SONIC ENERGY . 

The purpose of the following experiments on reflection of 
ultra-sonic energy, was to obtain a preliminary idea of the be¬ 
havior of the phenomenon and the laws which govern it, with a 
view to the predetermination of what results might be escpected 
in practical detection of objects in water by means of ultra-sonic 
energy reflected from their under-water surfaces. It had been 
known that reflection freely occurred since pains had been taken 
to avoid difficulties due to reflected energy from the end of the 
experimental tank. This energy had been dissipated by screens 
set at about 46 degrees with the end of the tank, thus shewing 
that the energy could be reflected by ordinary materials. Further¬ 
more, ultra-sonic stationary ?i/aves had been produced^ and this 
method used for measuring velocities in different liquid media. 

But no quantitative measurements of the energy of reflected ultra¬ 
sonic beams have hitherto been made. 

In the present experiments reflectors of different materials 
and of different thicknesses were used, and the intensity of the 
reflected and incident beams were measured quantitatively by the 
small hollow vane pendulum devices referred to in Part I of this 
report. 

The same conditions near the face of the transmitter, due to 
non-uniform radiation over the face, were encountered as in the 
previous experiments; but in this instance it was possible to 


1. Some Problems in Ultra-Sonics - S.O. Morgan. 







(30) 


place the reflector heyond the axial maxima and minima of energy 
intensity close to the face, and also to talce measurements where 
the ultra-sonic side beams were of negligible intensity. By the 
application of the formula derived from simple diffraction theory, 
viz: 

d = - H) X k = E/x 

n 4 

n = an integer 

d = distance from source of energy, 
it was possible to calculate the distance from the transmitter at 
which this axial maxima and minima ceased. Experimentally they 
were found to stop before this actual distance was reached. The 
distance calculated from this relation, putting ”n” = 1 to give 
the distance of the furthest maximum from the transmitter, was 
found to be 50.5 oms., and the closest position of the reflector 
to the transmitter in these experiments was 170 cms. All the 
readings ?/ere taken with a total length of path from the trans¬ 
mitter to the reflector and from that to the measuring pendulum 
in excess of £E5 oms. 

Most of the reflected sections were taken at an angle of 
incidence of nearly forty-five degrees, though no convenient very 
accurate method could be used to measure the angles. The measure¬ 
ments of the incident angles v\/ere made graphically by measuring 
the co-ordinates of the point of incidence as well as the position 
of the centre of the reflector and the position of the transmitter. 

It was assumed that the incident angle was eq^ual to the reflected 
angle as in the optical case. This method measured the angles at 
least to the nearest two degrees, but probably somewhat more closely, 
and gave the angle for the central, most intense portion of the 






(31) 


■beam only. For the outer, less intense rays of the beam, the 
incident angles would be a few degrees greater or a few degrees 
less than the measured value, e.g. for the beam taken at 173,000 
cycles per second, the total variation in incident angle over all 
the main beam was about five degrees. 

The side beams were spread at much voider angles and were too 
weak to be measured by the pendulum, but have been detected by 
means to be mentioned below. 

A photographic method was also used for shewing just what was 
involved in the case of reflection. A steel plate thirty centi¬ 
metres square and 2.E cms. in thickness was used as a reflector 
since steel gives the strongest reflected beam of any of the 
materials at hand. As in such figures obtained heretofore, cinder 
dust ¥;as used to map out the energy zones. It v^^as found necessary 
to move the reflector much nearer to the energy source than in the 
case of the pendulum method so that the intensity of energy might 
be sufficient to cause the dust to indicate the lines of maximum 
and minimum energy and hence to map out the field. The reflector 
was placed just beyond the axial irregularities at a distance of 
about sixty centimetres from the source of energy. 

Eeferring to photograph No. 1 it will be seen that there ?i/ere 
several sets of stationary ?/aves present. Those at C may be seen 
to be due to the interference of the incident and its own reflected 
beam. They are roughly triangular in shape and are distinctly se¬ 
parated from the waves at B and A. By drawing in full lines the 
main section of the beam, as it would be theoretically reflected, 
it will be seen that the stationaries at A and B are in the section 
where the direct side beams from the transmitter cut across the 




f32) 

reflected beam from the reflector. 

The intense portion of the beam may be seen as a light streak 
across the stationaries, and it may further be noticed that another 
beam of lesser intensity cuts across closer to the transmitter 
passing through the point D. The remainder of the reflected beam 
is only shewn by the presence of the stationaries where the side 
beams cross. The most intense section of the beam does not appear 
to be in the centre of the beam but slightly to one side with a 
distinct minimum between it and the side beam. 

To make certain that the stationaries referred to above v;ere 
actually due to interference with the direct beam, a piece of lime¬ 
stone three inches thick was placed so as to block off the side 
beams on one side of the central beam. The result is clearly shewn 
in photograph No. 2 as no stationaiies are present at A or B. The 
ones at G still persist and others are noticeable at 3 and F. The 
former are due to the waves incident on and directly reflected from 
the rock, ¥;hile the latter seem to be caused by reflections from 
the edge of the roclL. The intense portion of the main reflected 
beam from the steel plate reflector is still to be seen, but the 
remainder of the beam is not visible due to the small amount of 
energy present being insufficient to cause the dust to settle out 
of the maximum zones. The side beams of the reflection are barely 
visible in the second picture. The analogous optical case is that 
of Lloyd’s interference bands.^ These are caused by the interfering 
rays from a real source and an imaginary source beyond a mirror. 

The mirror in the present instance is the reflector of steel, but

the interference beams shev; up as stationary ultra-sonic waves at 
A and B. Taking a cross-section a-b the interference bands are 
apparent. Of course in Lloyd's mirror the angle of incidence of 
the beam was much greater than in the photograph accompanying this 
Again there is no phase change upon reflection because in the case 
under consideration the steel is the medium of greater velocity. 
The distance between these bands would be approximately D A/gd. 

The source is not a point source and hence modifications would 
have to be made in the formula. The distance between those at 
G will be found to be A/g.cos 0 apart. v;here 9 is the angle of 
incidence of the beam. These also have their optical analogy 
in the interference lines produced in Wiener's^ experiment with 
reflection of polarised light. These are really interference 
planes and it was just the trace of these upon the inclined photo¬ 
graphic plate which Wjaier obtained. The stationaries at B in the 
second photograph are caused by interference betv;een the incident 
and a directly reflected beam and the distance between these v;ill 
be X/2, The slight traces of stationaries at F are similar to 
those at A and B. 

The assumption that the incident angle is equal to the angle 
of reflection is shewn to be true from observing the paths traced 
out in the photographs. 

These qualitative experiments give some idea of what may be 
expected when quantitative experimental work is carried out. More 
over it gives at a glance a general outlook on the energy field 
which could only be obtained otherwise by means of very difficult 
and wearisome experimental work. 


1. Treatise on Light - Houston. 









'J?he quantitative survey was carried out with the same measur¬ 
ing apparatus that was used in the survey dealt V7ith in Part I. 

The disposition of the apparatus was different and some additional 
apparatus was required. The lighter reflectors were held in posi¬ 
tion in the middle of the tank as shewn at A in Plate Part I, so 
that the reflected beam was directed down the side hay of the tank 
and dissipated at the end of the hay hy the dissipating screens 
previously described. The reflector holder v;as suspended from the 
top and was free to he swung through any desired angle. The heavier 
hlocl^ of reflecting material were supported hy a platform standing 
on the bottom of the tank, and the angle of incidence was varied 
hy turning the reflecting block upon its base. The pendulum v/as 
protected from the direct beam by the corner between the main body 
of the tank and the bay. The ice reflector was a large block and 
had to be heavily ?/eighted in position; this made it more difficult 
to handle. Smaller pieces of ice were found unsatisfactory for 
the work on account of the rapidity with which melting took place. 
The stone reflectors were cut with smooth reflecting surfaces but 
were not polished. Their width was about 20 cms. and their length 
from 30 cms. to 60 cms. in the case of the thick blocks. 

All work was done at a frequency of 173,000 cycles per second, 
(the wave-length in vmtei being 1.14 cms.) with a voltage of 1500 
across the transmitter. 

In optics it is known that the intensity of the reflected beam 
depends upon the angle of incidence. Similarly in sound the same 
effect has been found. It has also been found that the intensity 






of the reflection ‘depends upon the ratio of the products of the 
density and the velocity of the energy in the two media.^ To 
obtain a reflection must not be equal "to • This value 

is termed the weight of a wave-length. If the sound travelled 
from a medium of lesser velocity to one of greater velocity the 
angle of refraction would be greater than the angle of reflection, 
according to the law sin © / sin = v/v^ where © is the angle of 
reflection and 0 is the angle of refraction, and v and v’ are the 
velocities in the first and second medium respectively. It will 
be seen that at some value of 9, (j will become a right angle, and 
the refracted beam w’ill skim along the surface of the reflector. 

Fox angles greater than this no refracted beam exists in the or¬ 
dinary sense, but actually some disturbance inside the reflector 
takesplace, but this has a daijping factor and dies out rapidly in 
the thickness of a few/ wave-lengths. 

Although the experiments must be considered as preliminary 
only, and consisted of too few readings to formulate as yet definit 
laws, nevertheless the results were of sufficient value to act as 
a starting point for future more detailed investigation. 

Three factors have been noted, the effect of the variation of 
the incident angle over a small range, the effect of thickness of 
the reflector, and the reflections from different materials. 

In Plate I the results of the observations on the effect of 
incident angle are shewn. The angles used were the ones that 
were used in the later parts of the experiment. The curves shew 
that in the vicinity of an angle of forty-five degrees an increase

,'4. . . brir. 



(36) 


in the incident angle results in an increased maximum intensity 
of the reflected beam. 

The angles of incidence in the later experiments varied only 
slightly in most cases, whereas the intensity of reflection varied 
much more than would be accounted for by any change in angle. 

As was expected the most intense reflected beam was obtained 
from the material of greatest change in product It is to be 

noted that this steel reflector was the thinnest of the reflectors 
used, being only about a half wave-length in thickness normal to 
its face. The reflections from the reflectors of m.arble and lime¬ 
stone YJhieh were of thickness comparable to the steel were very 
much less in intensity. This result follovt^s from the law that 
where the greatest difference exists betv;een the weight of a wave- 
length, (i.e., p#*) in the first medium and that in the second, we 
have the greatest reflection. The limestone was found to be a 
better reflector when first immersed, the decrease in the intensity 
of the reflected beam being quite noticeable after the rock had 
been soaked. The section shewn was taken after thorough soaking 
had taken place. 

With increased thickness of reflector the reflection becomes 
much greater at the same incident angle. This is shev/n in the 
granite and limestone reflections. The physical properties of 
these varieties of rock are very similar and thus we should expect 
similar reflections. This we obtain where the thickness of the 
reflector is of the same order in each case, 

Tifith ice the conditions Ys/ere slightly different. The face 
was not so smooth as in the other reflectors, and melting was 






f37) 


certainlj^ going on while the readings were being taken thus 
altering the face and hence the actual angle of incidence. More¬ 
over the angle of incidence was greater than in the other materials 
used. All that could be done in the case of ice was to get the 
readings as quickly as possible, and it is not pretended that the 
numerical results are as definite or as accurate as when reflectors 
of other materials v;ere used. The shape of the curve is quite dif¬ 
ferent from the others and this may be due to interference on ac¬ 
count of the humps and hollows of the face. The purpose of trying 
ice as a reflector was 7;ith reference to a proposed practical in¬ 
vestigation into the possibility of the use of ultra-sonic energy 
for detection of objects under the surface of the water by means 
of echoes obtained by reflections from their surfaces. It was 
particularly desired to find out what was the strength of the 
beam reflected from ice, since its detection Y7as to be one of 
the primary objects of the forthcoming trial. Since all available 
information tended to shew that hardly any energy would be reflected 
the results v/ere in doubt, for in the case of ice the value for/^/ 

= 0.916 X 1.74 X 10^ = 1.595 x 10^, and in water^/iV= 1 x 1.5 x 10^ 

= 1.5 X 10^. For sea water1. 025 x 1.8 x 10^ = 1.845 x 10^. 
These are all of the same order in comparison to steel, where 
= 7.8 X 5.2 X 10^ = 40.5 x 10^. However at the angle of incidence 
used reflections ?/ere obtained vjhich v/ere comparable v/ith that of 
the stone slabs. This was surprising in view of published figures 
on the elastic constants of ice, but suggested that in the case 
of practice investigation positive results might not oe impossible.

It was noticed in reflections from the steel and granite that the 
peal: of maximum intensity of the reflected beam was greater than 
that of the incident. The reflected beam was sharpened more than 
the incident one and seemed narrower than the direct beam taken at 
the same distance from the transmitter. This may have been due to 
irregularities in the reflecting face. If the surface v;ere concave 
slightly rather than plane, this result might be expected. The 
remaining reflected beams all shev; a much smaller maximum intensity. 

since some energy can enter the plate the possibiIjJy-<rf^ 
internal mln^4iJ^e reflections must be expected and,.,J;^Te'niterf ere

Iti^-^g^'^estion as to whether of these eff ects j^^Hau^ic ient to 
cause noticeable effects. 

The distribution of energy in the reflected beam is not the 
same as in the direct beam taken at an equal distance from the 
transmitter. This will be noticed in all cases of reflected beams 
shewn on Plate X* The beam divides into two peaks one of which is 
slightly higher than the other at the incident angles used. It was 
first thought that this might be due to reflections from the screens 
at the end of the bay of the tanli, but this could not be the cause 
since the position of the minimum point varied relatively to these. 
It might also be attributed to some lack of uniformity in the in¬ 
cident beam, but this is improbable since the distance of the re¬ 
flecting plate from the transmitter was far beyond any irregularity 
as shewn by the preceding survey in Part I. Again some effect might 



But since some energy does enter the plate, rnuitiple'^^ 
internal reflections take place and the emerging' energ;>^ 
must interfere, both with the incident energy and also with 
the reflected energy from the surfa.ce. Hence maxima and in 
minima, ri'je.y be expected, at apj_ roxT'ria.te points. In other 
v;ords, the r^l^.te is acting as a thin film towards the- ultra¬ 
sonic energy. It may^ he a question as to whether the mo.g“ 
iiitude of these interferences is great enough to produce 




(39) 


be due to interference from reflection from the back and front 
of the reflector as in the optical thin film theory. But since 
in all cases (except in the ice experiment) the incident angle 
v;as considerably beyond the critical angle for reflection very 
little of the incident energy would penetrate the plate; thus 
any thin film effect would be exceedingly v/eak. 


However, in the case of the thin slabs of material used for 
reflectors another factor enters into the computation of the 
transmitted and reflected energy. J'ollov/ing Rayleigh’s method 


Boyle and Rawlinson^ have obtained the following equation for the 
reflected energy, in the case of normal incidence. 



\ = wave-length. 

This will be seen to become zero at a value of 1 eoual to an 


integral number of half wave-lengths and to be a maximum at a 
thickness equal to an odd number of quarter wave-lengths. As the 
reflecting plate is turned so that the incident angle is varied, 
the length of path of the energy in the reflector is changed. The 
fact that the incident beam spreads over an angle of some five 
degrees has already been mentioned. Hence it is possible that the 
path of some part of the beam through the plate may be exactly 
equal to some multiple number of half v;ave-lengths, and others 
sections have a path of an odd number of quarter wave-lengths. 

Thus the reflections ?/ill pass through maximum and minimum values. 

Rayleigh mentions that some of the incident energy does enter

a short distance into the reflector even when the incident angle 
is greater than the critical angle. Since the reflectors are only 
a few wave-lengths in thickness at most it is possible that some 
of this energy will pass through the plate before it is damped out. 
This would be particularly so, if the path of this energy through 
the plate happened to be some integral number of half wave-lengths. 
Now some part of the incident beam will have a refracted component 
whose path through the plate will be an integral number of half 
wave-lengths and hence will have a relatively smaller reflected 
component. This would result in a minimum in the reflected beam i 

vjhich need not necessarily correspond with the centre of the beam, | 
but which would be the most noticeable if it were near the maximum. ' 
This may possibly account for the minimum point in the experimental j 
curves. More readings would be required to substantiate this theory. 

Tv/o transmitted sections were taken with the incident angle 
very much sm.aller, the reflections being from a plate whose thick¬ 
ness was not an integral number of wave-lengths at the frequency 

i 

used. At normal incidence a very small part of the incident energy i 

passed through as Yill be seen by reference to curve ^ on ?lateXlII-i | 

I! 

The plate v;as now turned so that the incident angle v/as made greater.|j 
The angle chosen (27^) was that at which the transmitted energy 

was sufficient to be detected by the listener behind the plate. | 

jl 

A section of the transmitted beam was nov/ taken and this is plotted 
on the same sheet. The position of the peak of this ?/as found to 
be displaced about nine centimetres to the side from the line of 
maximum energy of the incident beam, but was plotted so that the 
peaks correspond for the sake of comparison. It was to be expected

that with inoreasing incident angle the transmitted energy should 
decrease, hut it is plain to he seen that other factors enter into 
the result, and more work must he done before a definite conclusion 
can he reached. However, the above explanation given in the case 
of reflection also may he used to account for this result in 
transmission. 

It appears that so many things can take place in such reflec¬ 
tions as are here considered, that the whole is a very complicated 
phenomenon, and made more so by the fact that in the beginning at 
incidence the wave is not a simple plane wave, hut a beam over the 
width of Y;hich the phases undergo a total change of TP , and the 
amplitudes of vibration vary from a maximum at the centre to zero 
at the outlines. The whole phenomenon probably is beyond mathe¬ 
matical analysis. 

GONGLUSIOH - 

Recapitulating, a survey has been made of the ultra-sonic 
energy field close to the transmitter, mapping out the field off 
the axis, in a region not as yet treated by mathematicians, and 
along the axis in the region investigated by Rresnel, In the 
second part the investigation has been made in the region treated 
by Yerdet, i.e., in a plane at some distance from the energy source. 
It has been found that, under the conditions here studied, the 
energy intensity in the central beam agreed vath that computed from 
Yerdet^3 formula. Finally, some idea has been obtained as to the 
relative values of rook, steel and ice as reflectors of ultra-sonic 
energy, but it must be remembered that this is only an introductory 







f4E) 


investigation and much further must be done before definite lav/s 
may be laid dov/n to govern this phenomenon.
