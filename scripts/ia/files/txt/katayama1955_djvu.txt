ABSTRACT 


The influence of various carbohydrates on the utilization 
of dietary protein by the albino rat was investigated. The 
methods of evaluating the diets consisted of growth experiments, 
protein digestibility studies, and the determination of certain 
of the essential amino acids in the feces. 

Potato starch, autoclaved potato starch or dextrin each 
induced greater levels of amino acids in the feces of rats 
than either sucrose or glucose. The inclusion of 10% of 
lactose in the sucrose ration resulted in an increase in 
the levels of lysine and histidine in the feces. The amino 
acids found in feces appeared to be derived chiefly from 
endogenous sources. 

Rats fed ad libitum a ration containing 9?« casein and 
O.jT/o methionine with corn starch as the source of carbo¬ 
hydrate, grew at a higher rate than those fed a corres¬ 
ponding ration with sucrose as the source of carbohydrate. 

The nutritional efficiency of the sucrose ration was improved 
when histidine, valine, threonine, lysine, and tryptophan 
were included in small quantities. 

Unmodified potato starch as the source of carbohydrate 
in the diet of the rat was poorly utilized and also induced 
a decrease in the digestibility of dietary protein. The 
poor utilization of unmodified potato starch was attributed 
to the resistance of the outermost layers of the starch 
granules to attack by alpha-amylase.

SECTION A 


INFLUENCE OF VARIOUS CARBOHYDRATES ON THE UTILIZATION 
OF PROTEIN BY THE ALBINO RAT 

INTRODUCTION 

The protein sparing action of dietary carbohydrates has 
been extensively studied and has recently been comprehensively 
reviewed by Munro (31)• However, little attention has been 
paid to the influence of different carbohydrates on the uti¬ 
lization of low protein diets* There is some evidence to 
indicate that protein utilization may be modified by altering 
the carbohydrate fed* Harper and Lepp (9) observed that only 
when the level of casein was increased from 18% to 20% or 227 * 
did chicks receiving sucrose diets grow as well as those fed 
dextrin as a source of carbohydrate* 

Hall and Sydenstrieker (8) found that rats, receiving a 
9 Q /o casein diet containing added methionine and with sucrose 
as the carbohydrate, grew at about half the normal rate* 

Normal growth was obtained when histidine, lysine, valine, 
threonine, and tryptophan were added to the diet. However, 
normal growth was also obtained when sucrose was replaced by 
corn starch, and inositol, p-aminobenzoic acid, and nicotinic 
acid were added. Hall and Sydenstrieker suggested that with 
the 9% casein diet, corn starch and additional vitamins pro¬ 
moted intestinal synthesis which made up the small deficiencies 
in essential amino acids other than methionine* 

Nrehl, Henderson, de la Huerga, and Elvehjem (20) noted

that relatively good growth of rats was obtained when dextrin 
or corn starch was employed as the carbohydrate in 97° casein diets 
low in nicotinic acid. The addition of nicotinic acid or tryp¬ 
tophan did not benefit growth significantly. However, when 
sucrose was used as the carbohydrate, growth was poor. The 
addition of nicotinic acid gave only a partial improvement, 
whereas the addition of tryptophan resulted in still better 
growth. 

The present investigation was designed to study the in¬ 
fluence of various carbohydrates on the utilization of low 
protein rations by the albino rat. The methods of evaluating 
the diets consisted of growth experiments, protein digestibility 
studies, and the determination of certain of the essential amino 


acids in the feces

REVIEW OF LITERATURE 


In 1909, Kendall v. 19 > demonstrated that the nature of 
the diet determined the dominant types of intestinal bacteria. 
Using monkeys and cats, he found that a carbohydrate diet 
produced an acidophilic type of fecal flora, whereas pro¬ 
teolytic bacteria predominated when the animals were placed 
upon a purely protein regimen. Similarly, Hull and Rettger 
U7) showed that the character of the intestinal flora of the 
rat could be altered by changing the diet from the ordinary 
mixed food to a synthetic diet containing milk or lactose. 

Such a change quickly resulted in a marked simplification 
of the intestinal flora, bacillus coli and other intestinal 
organisms were practically eliminated, while bacilli of the 
type of Bacillus acidophilus predominated. Later, Porter and 
Rettger {J4) studied the influence of diet on the distribu¬ 
tion of bacteria along the alimentary tract of the rat. On 
a stock diet of calf meal, the "normal” bacterial flora of 
the young white rat was found to be comparatively simple, 
especially in the upper segments of the alimentary tract, 
the flora being made up largely of the Lactobacillus 
acidophilus type of aciduric organisms. Bacteria became 
increasingly more abundant in the lov/er sections of the 
small intestine, the lower ileum and caecum. These regions 
contained appreciable numbers of coli-like organisms. The 
"normal" bacterial flora throughout the digestive tract

could be altered by certain foods or by starvation. Gall, 
Fenton, and Cowgill (6) have shown that the intestinal flora 
of mice fed a dextrose diet is different from that of mice 
maintained on a ration containing dextrin. 

The possibility of the intestinal bacteria making an 
essential contribution to the nutrition of the host was 
suggested when several investigators found that coprophagy 
reduced the B-vitamin requirements of the rat. Steenbock, 
Sell, and Nelson (43) found that rats kept on screens required 
2 to 3 times as much yeast in the ration as a source of B- 
vitamins as animals kept on shavings. Heller, McElroy, and 
Garlock (13) were able to show that spore-bearing organisms, 
found in the feces of rats, synthesized B-vitamins. Roscoe 
(3^) confirmed earlier investigations showing that coprophagy 
prolonged the life of rats receiving diets deficient in the 
vitamin B-complex. She suggested that coprophagous rats were 
able to utilize the B-vitamins in the feces that had been syn¬ 
thesized by bacteria in the caecum. 

In 1935* Guerrant, Butcher, and Tomey (7) found that the 
type of carbohydrate used in the diet influenced the amount 
of B-vitamins found in the feces. Dextrinized corn starch 
was more effective than sucrose, glucose or commercial corn 
starch in promoting the synthesis of B-vitamins. Lactose 
appeared to occupy an intermediate position between dextrin 
and sucrose in this respect. On finding that B-vitamin forma- 






- 5 - 


tion occurred in the caecum of the rat, Guerrant £t al. sug¬ 
gested that the peculiar property of dextrinized corn starch 
resulted from the incomplete digestion of this particular 
form of carbohydrate; the undigested carbohydrate, on reaching 
the lower part of the digestive tract of the rat, presumably 
stimulated the growth of the intestinal microorganisms which 
were believed to be the specific agents synthesizing the B- 
vitamins. This view was later supported by Schweigert, Me In¬ 
tire, Henderson, and Elvehjem 141; who showed that caecectomy 
or the feeding of sulfasuxidine decreased the synthesis of 
riboflavin in the intestinal tract of rats which received 
either lactose or dextrin as the only carbohydrate. With 
sucrose diets, caecectomy or sulfasuxidine administration 
caused little effect on the riboflavin level in the intestinal 
tract. The importance of the amount of carbohydrate reaching 
the caecum of the rat in promoting the intestinal synthesis of 
the B-vitamins was also shown by refection, whereby spontaneous 
synthesis of B-vitamins occurs in the intestinal tract of rats 
fed either raw potato starch or raw rice starch as the source 
of carbohydrate. 11,18,36;. 

The conversion of non-protein nitrogen to protein by the 
microorganisms of the rumen and the subsequent digestion and 
utilization of this protein by the ruminant has received much 
attention. The more important investigations between 1937 and 
1947 have been extensively reviewed by Metaught and Smith i25i*

jj'rom the results of their feeding experiments, Hart, 

Bohstedt, Deobald, and Wegner ill 9 concluded that urea and 

ammonium bicarbonate nitrogen could be used by growing calves 

to replace a portion of the dietary protein. Later, a procedure 

was used by Mills, Booth, ^ohstedt, and Hart (26; whereby rations 

with and without urea were given to heifers through a rumen 

fistula. The ammonia and crude protein in the rumen contents 

were estimated at intervals after feeding. A decrease in 

ammonia and an increase in crude protein after the ingestion 

of urea were regarded as evidence of the conversion of ammonia 

nitrogen to protein. Mills et al. found that the utilization of 
A 

N.P.N. occurred to a significant extent only when the ration 
contained ample starch and was low in protein. That ammonia 
was converted to protein in significant amounts only when low 
protein rations were fed had also been observed by Wegner, 

Booth, Bohstedt, and Hart (46;. They found that with urea 
added to a basal ration containing 8.^7° °£ protein no clear 
indication of protein synthesis was obtained. When the basal 
ration contained 4% protein, the addition of urea resulted in 
an increase in the crude protein content of the rumen ingesta. 
Harris and Mitchell (10), using nitrogen balance studies, showed 
that the addition of urea to a low protein ration converted the 
ration into one that was capable of promoting a nearly normal 
rate of growth of lambs. They also showed that such a ration 
need contain no more than 11% of conventional protein, when 
urea provided 5>0% of the total nitrogen. Similarly, Hart et al . 

A non-protein nitrogen 




- 7 - 


had shown that when urea supplied 43% of the total nitrogen, 

the ration gave far better utilization than when urea supplied 

61% and 707® of the total nitrogen, 

Pearson and Smith (33 ) devised a technique to study rumen 

synthesis in vitro . The lumen contents were strained through 

muslin to remove coarse particles and the resulting liquid 

o 

was incubated at 39 C for 3 to 4 hours under conditions similar 
to those in the rumen. Within the first 3 hours, the total 
N.F.N. diminished while the total nitrogen remained unaltered. 
The results supported the view that synthesis of protein oc¬ 
curred. That this synthesis was microbiological in origin 
was shown by the decrease in synthesis which occurred when the 
rumen fluid was incubated with minute amounts of toxic sub¬ 
stances, Further investigations by Pearson and Smith hi owed 
that protein synthesis from ammonia, and protein breakdown 
with the production of ammonia, appeared to proceed at the 
same time in rumen contents. However, synthesis exceeded 
breakdown when starch, maltose or galactose was present. The 
stimulating effect of carbohydrates on protein synthesis in 
vitro was confirmed by Smith and Baker (42). They found that 
hydrolysis of protein predominated in the absence of carbohy¬ 
drate, but when either glucose or maltose was added, marked 
synthesis was observed. The greater portion of the synthesis 
was attributed to the masses of microiodophilic bacteria which 
abound in the rumen. Protozoa did not appear to contribute 
to the synthesis.

Recently, attention has focused on the synthesis of 
individual amino acids in the rumen. Thomas, Loosli, Ferris, 
Williams, and Maynard (44) compared purified diets, one con¬ 
taining casein and the other an equal nitrogen level of urea 
as the only source of nitrogen. Growth of goats and sheep 
was poorer on the urea diet than on the casein diet, but the 
essential amino acid content of the rumen materials was similar 
for both groups of animals. Block and Stekol (2) fed sodium 
sulfate containing radioactive sulfur to a cow and collected 
milk from the animal for several days. The proteins were 
isolated, hydrolyzed, and the amino acids separated on chro¬ 
matograms. Both cystine and methionine ?/ere found to contain 
radioactive sulfur in appreciable amounts. Thomas, Loosli, 
Williams, and Maynard (4j>) noted that growing lambs fed a 
purified diet low in sulfur exhibited gradual failure of 
appetite, loss of body weight and death. In the absence cf 
dietary sulfur, urea nitrogen was apparently not utilized, 
since deficient lambs were consistently in negative nitrogen 
and sulfur balance. Earlier investigations by Loosli and Harris 
(22) had shown that when the basal diet was supplemented with 
urea and methionine, nitrogen retention by lambs was significantly 
greater than when the ration was supplemented with urea alone 
or with urea and sodium sulfate. Williams and Moir (47) con¬ 
firmed these results. They suggested that the value of methio¬ 
nine as a supplement to urea in improving nitrogen retention 
in growing lambs was due largely to its stimulating effect on

bacterial growth in the rumen, which increased the amount of 
bacterial protein available to the host. 

McNaught (24) has shown by experiments in vitro that the 
lysine content of the rumen liquid increases after incubation. 
This increase was estimated to represent a 12% increase in the 
lysine of whole rumen contents. 

Current evidence supports the view that not only can 
N.P.N. indirectly support nitrogen metabolism in ruminants, 
but that also in the rat, the nitrogen of ammonium salts and 
certain other compounds can replace amino acid nitrogen in 
metabolism and growth. Rittenberg, Schoenheimer and Keston 
(55) fed rats a purified diet containing 157 ® casein and 
ammonium citrate which contained isotopic nitrogen. The proteins 
from the liver, intestine, kidney, and muscle of these rats 
contained significant amounts of isotope. Labelled nitrogen 
appeared in the glutamic acid and glycine prepared from liver 
and intestinal protein, in the arginine from all the proteins, 
and in the aspartic acid from liver protein. It was claimed 
that the foregoing results demonstrated the ability of the 
rat to utilize ammonium nitrogen for amino acid formation. 

Rose, Smith, Womack, and Shane (57) found that young rats 
grew slowly when restricted to a ration in which the nitrogen 
was provided by the essential amino acids alone. When the 
non-essential amino acids were added, good growth occurred. 

When the non-essential amino acids were replaced by diam¬ 
monium citrate or L-glutamic acid containing an equivalent

' 




- 10 - 


amount of nitrogen, excellent growth was observed. Neither 
glycine nor urea was as effective as diammonium citrate or L- 
glutamic acid in providing non-protein nitrogen for growth. 
Lardy and Feldott (21) conducted experiments in which rats were 
given a ration producing a minimal positive nitrogen balance; 
when diammonium citrate was added, a marked retention of nitro¬ 
gen occurred. No added growth was produced by adding sodium 
citrate, showing that it was the ammonium nitrogen which ?/as 
active. The results obtained by Frost and Sandy (3) confirmed 
those of other investigators. They suggested that the best 
utilization of amino acid mixtures occurred when at least 20% 
of the total nitrogen was present as nitrogen other than that 
of the essential amino acids; this 20% of nitrogen appeared 
to be fairly non-specific. 

The possibility that the intestinal microorganisms of the 
rat play a role in the synthesis of the non-essential amino 
acids was suggested by Martin ( 23 ). He found that the inclu¬ 
sion of sulfasuxidine in the diet caused a loss of weight in 
rats fed the 10 essential amino acids as a source of nitrogen. 
In attempting to explain his results, Martin proposed that 
certain amino acids were synthesized in the intestinal tract 
and thus did not appear essential. He concluded that the in¬ 
clusion of sulfasuxidine reduced this synthesis and caused 
the deficiencies to be precipitated. William and Watson (48) 
fed arginine-free diets with and without sulfasuxidine to rats. 
Since there was no dramatic weight loss by the rats fed the

. 










o 


- 11 - 


arginine-free diet containing sulfasuxidine, these investiga¬ 
tors concluded that the intestinal tract was not the source 
of the arginine synthesized by the rat. Rose and Smith 138 ) 
further investigated the role of alimentary microorganisms 
in the synthesis of non-essential amino acids and obtained 
inconclusive results. With a ration containing the 10 essential 
amino acids in moderate excess, the presence of sulfasuxidine 
led to a slight, but statistically significant decrease in the 
rate of gain. However, the drug was without effect upon the 
growth of the rats which consumed a ration containing diammonium 
citrate and the 10 essential amino acids at their tentative 
minumum level. Rose and Smith suggested that the microorganisms 
which are inhibited by sulfasuxidine may play a role in the 
synthesis of non-essential amino acids, but that this role is 
of minor importance. They concluded that either microorganisms 
which are not affected by sulfasuxidine, or the cells of the 
host must be largely responsible for the synthesis of non- 
essential amino acids.

EFFECT OF VARIOUS CARBOHYDRATES 
ON THE LEVEL OF AMINO ACIDS IN THE FECES 


Experimental 


Animal-feeding techniques 

Weanling male rats of 40 to j?0 gram body weight (21 to 
2.5 daysj were used as the experimental animals. Each animal 
was housed in an individual cage having an elevated bottom 
of one-half inch mesh screen. The animals were weighed weekly 
and individual food consumption records ?/ere kept. 

Groups, consisting of 5 to 6 animals each, were fed the 
experimental rations for a period of either 4 or 6 weeks. The 
food consumption of rats fed diets containing 18 % casein was 
controlled by restricting the amount of ration offered. Equal 
quantities of food were offered during the first few days, but 
when the average food intake readied 10 g. per day, the ration 
thereafter offered was restricted to this amount. Ad libitum 
feeding was employed with rats fed diets containing 9 % casein. 
Water was supplied ad libitum to all rats. 

The composition of the basal rations is shown in Table I 
and the vitamin supplements used are shown in Table II. The 
levels cf vitamins and minerals used were estimated to be 
optimal for the rat. 

The various experimental rations are listed in Table III. 
The amounts of supplements added to the rations are reported

as percentages of the diets and were added at the expense 
of the carbohydrate. With the exception of sucrose, all 
the carbohydrates used in these experiments have been reported 
as favoring the synthesis of B-vitamins by the intestinal 
flora. During the first week of experiment II, it was found 
that 20% lactose incorporated in the sucrose diet caused 
diarrhea; therefore, the level of lactose was decreased to 
10%. In experiment III, either 3®00% of ammonium citrate or 
3.497® of ammonium bicarbonate was incorporated into rations 
11, 13, and 13. The levels of ammonium salts used provided 
0.619% nitrogen. 

It was previously noted that rats could not be satis¬ 
factorily maintained on a 97° casein diet with potato starch 
as the only source of carbohydrate. Therefore, in rations 
10 and 11 of experiment III, 407® of potato starch was used 
and the remainder of the carbohydrate consisted of sucrose. 
Coates, Henry, Kon, £on, Mawson, Stanier and Thompson (4) 
found that refection was obtained when potato starch made 
up 407« of the ration. 

Analyses of feces for amino acids 

Jj'eces excreted during the first three days of the 
experiment were discarded. Thereafter, the feces from each 
rat were collected at least twice weekly from absorbent 
paper that had been placed beneath the cage. The feces 
were screened from food particles and hair, and were then

air-dried at room temperature, weighed, and ground for the 
analyses. 

The proteins in one gram samples of the feces were 

hydrolyzed by autoclaving in 20 ml. of 5 N HC1 for 10 hours 
o 

at 120 G. The amino acids were determined by means of 
microbiological assays using essentially the same procedure 
as Henderson and Snell (lj>). Leuconostoc mesenteroides P. 60 
was used as the test organism for lysine determinations, 
Lactobacillus arabinosus for valine, and Streptococcus 
fecalis for methionine and histidine. A Gannon titrator 
(14 ) with a quinhydrone electrode was used throughout 
for titrations. 

Protein digestibility studies 

The animals were housed in cages with one-quarter inch 
wire screen bottoms. The cages were supported by metal 
funnels. To collect the feces, a fine mesh screen was placed 
a few inches above the inverted apex of each funnel. The 
feces were removed every second day and were air-dried for 
twenty-four hours before being analyzed for nitrogen by the 
micro-Kjeldahl method (3)« 

The techniques followed were similar to those used by 
Mitchell (27)* For the determination of metabolic nitrogen 
loss, each group, consisting of three young male rats, was 
placed on a ration containing 4% egg albumen. Each group 
was then fed a test ration containing 9% casein. In changing

from one ration to another, at least three days were allowed 
to elapse before the feces were again collected and analyzed. 
The carbohydrates tested for their effect on protein digesti¬ 
bility were corn starch, potato starch, autoclaved potato 
starch, and sucrose. The basal composition of the 9% casein 
ration used is shown in Table I. The low-nitrogen diet had 
the same general composition except that 4% egg albumen was 
substituted for 97° casein; the difference was made up by 
increasing the amount of carbohydrate.

Kesults and Discussion 

Groups of rats fed rations containing sucrose, glucose, 
dextrin or autoclaved potato starch as the source of carbo¬ 
hydrate exhibited no marked growth differences under the 
conditions of experiment I* However, when unmodified potato 
starch was used as the only source of carbohydrate in the 
diet, the growth rate of the rats was low* The rats on this 
ration excreted white, bulky feces which were found by 
microscopic examination to consist largely of undigested 
starch granules. Also, the digestibility of dietary protein 
was shown to be impaired when unmodified potato starch was 
used as the sole source of carbohydrate (Table IX). 

Apparently the lower rate of growth of rats fed the unmodified 
potato starch ration was due to the poor utilization of 
unmodified potato starch and to the coincident decrease in 
the digestibility of the dietary protein. 

The incorporation of lactose at a level of 20‘/o into the 
unmodified potato starch ration improved the growth rate 
slightly, whereas the incorporation of 10% of lactose into 
the sucrose ration did not cause any observable change in 
the growth of rats. Mitchell (29j> using diets containing 
various levels of lactose combined with corn starch, found 
that the growth of rats was practically normal on diets 
containing 30/» or less of lactose. Similarly, Outhouse, 

Smith, Merritt, and White (22j observed that there was no

alteration in growth when 2^7« sucrose or lactose replaced 
an equivalent amount of corn starch in the basal ration. 

The beneficial effect obtained ^dien unmodified potato starch 
was partially replaced by lactose may have been due to the 
utilization of lactose per se by the rat. 

The rate of gain of rats was not improved by supple¬ 
menting 97® casein rations with ammonium salts. Similar 
results were obtained by lardy and neldott (21; when they 
incorporated ammonium citrate into rations containing 
suboptimal amounts of fibrin or soybean oil meal. 

Values presented in Table V indicate the effects of 
various carbohydrates on the progressive weekly excretion 
of lysine, valine, histidine, and methionine in the feces. 
Potato starch, autoclaved potato starch, and dextrin induced 
much greater excretion of amino acids in the feces than 
either sucrose or glucose. Mitchell, Hamilton and Beadles 
128; found that sucrose, fructose, and lactose caused greater 
losses of organic nutrients in the feces than did glucose. 
They concluded that carbohydrates may have differential 
effects on the digestibility of the organic nutrients con¬ 
tained in the rations. In the study reported here, a 
significant loss of dietary protein was induced by potato 
starch, whereas dietary protein was almost completely 
digested and absorbed when either autoclaved potato starch 
or sucrose was used as the source of carbohydrate (Table IX).

The extent to which dietary protein contributed amino acids 
in the feces was apparently modified by the type of carbo¬ 
hydrate fed. 

The levels of amino acids excreted in the feces were 
lower or tended to be lower during the first week of the 
experiment than during the following weeks. During the first 
week the quantity of food consumed by the rats was least. 

Since Mitchell 127) has shown that the metabolic nitrogen 
excreted in the feces is proportional to the food intake, 
the smaller quantity of amino acids from endogenous sources 
could partly account for the lower levels of amino acids 
found in the feces during the first week. 

That the intestinal secretions and the intestinal micro¬ 
organisms probably contribute the major portion of the amino 
acids found in the feces is supported by the data in Table IX, 
which show that the metabolic nitrogen makes up a large portion 
of the nitrogen excreted in the feces. Also, unmodified 
potato starch and autoclaved potato starch, which induced 
relatively large excretions of metabolic nitrogen, were found 
to induce the highest levels of amino acids in the feces. 

It thus appears reasonable to conclude that the type of 
carbohydrate ingested by the rat influences the amounts of 
amino acids from endogenous sources which are found in the 
feces.

valine, and histidine is shown in Table VI. The incorpora¬ 
tion of 20 % of lactose into the potato starch ration apparently 
did not influence the amino acid content of the feces; however, 
the inclusion of 10 % of lactose in the sucrose ration caused 
an increase in the fecal amino acid content. The it test was 
applied and the increase in the lysine and histidine values 
were found to be statistically significant (t= 3 . 73 , P<0.01; 
t=2.80, P-0.02). The increase in the valine value was not 
statistically significant (t=1.64, P>0.1). Ross (39,40) 
has shown that breast-fed infants excrete greater quantities 
of free amino acids in the feces than do infants receiving 
artificial diets. The high lactose content of human milk 
was mentioned as possibly influencing the amount of free 
amino acids excreted in the feces. Ross also found that 
in the feces of the breast-fed infant the predominant organism 
was Lactobacillus bifidus , which comprised almost the whole 
flora; whereas in the infant on artificial diets the fecal 
organisms were mixed, and L. bifidus was either scanty or 
absent. Mitchell (29) shoY/ed that there was an increase 
of Bacillus acidophilus in the intestinal flora of the rat 
when 13 % of lactose was incorporated into the diet, it 
might be assumed then that the intestinal flora of the rats 
fed ration 8 (sucrose) was different from the intestinal flora 
of the rats fed ration 9 (sucrose & lactose). Possibly the 
higher levels of fecal amino acids obtained with ration 9 ,

as compared with ration 8, resulted from changes in the 
intestinal flora. 

From Table VII, it can be seen that the average levels 
of the fecal amino acids determined for ration 10 are similar 
to the levels determined for ration 1 ITable V). Since 
ration 10 contained 9% casein, in contrast to ration 1 which 
contained 187® casein, there does not appear to be any cor¬ 
relation between the amount of protein in the diet and the 
amount of amino acids found in the feces. 

The effect of autoclaved corn starch on the excretion 
of fecal amino acids was similar to the effect of the auto¬ 
claved potato starch. The levels of fecal amino acids induced 
by unmodified corn starch were approximately the same as the 
levels induced by sucrose. Corresponding results were obtained 
in the digestibility studies ITable IX). The amount of 
metabolic nitrogen excreted when unmodified corn starch was 
fed was approximately the same as that observed when sucrose 
was fed. 

Since the food intake influences the amount of metabolic 
nitrogen excreted, Table VII does not offer a comparison 
between groups. The amounts of amino acids excreted per gram 
of protein ingested are reported in Table VIII. On this basis 
there was a tendency for an excretion of slightly higher levels 
of amino acids in the feces, with the incorporation of ammonium 
salts into rations containing either unmodified potato starch 
or autoclaved corn starch.

Experimental 

Animal-feeding techniques 

Groups of weanling rats c£ 43 to 6 0 gram body weight 
[22 to 26 days old) were fed experimental rations containing 
either corn starch or sucrose as the source of carbohydrate. 
Each group consisted of 3 males and 3 females except in 
experiment I.b, where 4 males and 2 females were used. 

The rats were housed in individual cages with raised screen 
bottoms and were given food and water ad libitum for a period 
of either 4 or 6 weeks. Each rat was weighed weekly and the 
food consumption for each was recorded every other day. 

The basal rati ons used v/ere the same as shown in Table 
I, with the exception that whole liver powder was omitted. 

The same levels of vitamins as shown in Table II were also 
used. 

The experimental rations fed are shown in Table X. 

The supplements, reported as percentages of the ration were 
added at the expense of the carbohydrate.

Results and Discussion 

The results of the growth experiments are shown in Table 
XI and figure 1. The growth data for experiment I. a were 
obtained from experiments conducted in .Part I and are presented 
here for comparison with the present results* 

Hats, under restricted food intake, when fed rations 
containing 18% casein, grew well and at approximately the 
same rate with either corn starch or sucrose as the source 
of carbohydrate. The growth rate of the rats fed 97° casein 
with either corn starch or sucrose as the source of carbo¬ 
hydrate, was poor, growth was undoubtedly limited by the 
suboptimal amounts of certain essential amino acids, in 
particular methionine, provided by the 97° casein diet. 

When 0.57® methionine was included in the 187® casein 
diets, the growth rate was very good. Rats fed this diet 
with corn starch as the source of carbohydrate, grew at 
an average rate of 33 grams per week during the six weeks 
of the experiment. Rats fed a similar diet with sucrose 
as the carbohydrate, grew at an average rate of 33®3 grams 
per week. 

In experiment l.b, the addition of 0.37® methionine to 
the 97® casein rations resulted in a growth rate of 24.0 
grams per week when corn starch was used as the source of 
carbohydrate; whereas the growth rate when sucrose was 
used as the carbohydrate was only 16*3 grams per week. 

However, during preliminary experiments with equalized and

restricted feeding, the growth rates of rats fed this ration 
were approximately the same regardless of whether corn starch 
or sucrose was used as the carbohydrate• Apparently.,marked 
differences in growth between groups of rats fed corn starch 
and groups fed sucrose occurred only after the inclusion of 
0.3% methionine in the rations and then only with ad libitum 
feeding. 

The animals consumed less of the ration containing 97° 
casein, methionine, and sucrose than of the corresponding ration 
containing corn starch as the carbohydrate. The difference in 
food intake was not thought to be due to a difference in the 
palatability of the rations, because the food consumption was 
approximately the same for animals fed diets containing 187° 
casein and methionine, with either corn starch or sucrose 
as the carbohydrate, further, with the inclusion of only 
1% of a mixture of essential amino acids in the ration con¬ 
taining 97° casein, methionine and sucrose,the food consumption 
was greatly improved. 

The differences in food intake were considered to be 
caused by differences in nutritional efficiency of the rations. 
Hegsted and Haffenreffer 112) found that for young rats the 
mean daily food intake varied as the mean body weight raised 
to the 0.88 power. They suggested that the food intake of 
young rats was controlled, by some means, at a relatively 
constant percent above the requirements for basal metabolism.

If the food consumed contained adequate nutrients for growth, 
the animal grew, its basal metabolism increased, and thus 
its food intake increased upon succeeding days. If the food 
eaten did not support normal growth, then the food intake 
was correspondingly decreased. 

The results of experiment II show that an increase in 
the level of B-vitamins in the ration or the addition of 
liver concentrate did not substantially influence the growth 
rate of the rats fed the sucrose ration. The low mean gain 
in weight ^10.7 grams per week; of the control group in this 
experiment can be accounted for by the failure of 2 rats to 
eat normally. Apparently, intestinal synthesis of vitamins, 
at least of the known vitamins and of any unknown growth 
factors contained in liver concentrate, does not explain the 
growth differences obtained between groups of animals fed 
corn starch and those fed sucrose rations. 

Histidine, lysine, valine, threonine, and tryptophan 
were added to the 9?« casein-sucrose ration in amounts equivalent 
to those used by Hall and Sydenstricker (8). The growth rate 
of the rats fed this ration was approximately the same as that 
of rats fed the 9% casein - corn starch ration. Apparently, 
the amino acid supplement overcame the factor which was 
limiting the growth of animals fed the sucrose ration. Hall 
and Sydenstricker suggested that corn starch promoted intestinal 
synthesis which made up small deficiencies of these essential

amino acids, if intestinal synthesis of essential amino 
acids occurred, it would appear that the dietary casein supplied 
sufficient nitrogen for this purpose, because the addition of 
non-essential amino acids to the corn starch ration did not 
cause an increase in the growth rate. Since marked differences 
were obtained between animals fed corn starch and those fed 
sucrose only when methionine was present in the ration } 
intestinal synthesis of this amino acid was not significant. 
Williams and Moir {AT) suggested that the value of methionine 
as a supplement to urea in improving nitrogen retention in 
growing lambs was due largely to its stimulating effect on 
bacterial growth in the rumen, which increased the amount of 
bacterial protein available to the host. It is possible 
that methionine may play a similar role in the rat. 

The addition of 1> sulfasuxidine did not appear to affect 
the growth rate of the rats fed either the 9> casein - sucrose 
or 97* casein-corn starch rations. Since the inclusion of 
sulfasuxidine did not cause a decrease in the rate of growth 
of the rats fed the corn starch diet, the intestinal bacteria 
which were inhibited by sulfasuxidine apparently did not play 
a role in the possible synthesis of essential amino acids. 

Monson, Dietrich, and iilvehjem {30) found that the rate 
of growth of chicks was greater when dextrin rather than 
sucrose was used as the source of carbohydrate. Uellulose, 
sulfasuxidine, reticulogen, fish solubles, or vitamin

did not change the significant growth difference observed 
when these carbohydrates were used. They suggested that 
dextrin favoured the synthesis of some unknown chick growth 
factor • However, in a preliminary investigation, Harper and 
Lepp (9) found that chicks fed a sucrose diet grew as well as 
those fed a dextrin diet when the level of protein in the 
sucrose diet was increased. These results are similar to 
the observations made during this investigation. Further 
study is required to explain the growth differences induced 
by various carbohydrates.

summary 


The effect of various carbohydrates on the levels of 
amino acids excreted in the feces has been studied. Potato 
starch, autoclaved potato starch or dextrin each induced 
much greater levels of amino acids in the feces than either 
sucrose or glucose. Data from protein digestibility studies 
indicate that the slowly digested polysaccharides caused a 
greater excretion of metabolic nitrogen in the feces than 
either sucrose or glucose. Since the major portion of the 
fecal nitrogen consisted cf metabolic nitrogen, the amino 
acids found in the feces were thought to be derived chiefly 
from endogenous sources. The digestibility studies also showed 
that potato starch induced losses of dietary protein in the 
feces. 

The inclusion of 10% of lactose in the sucrose ration 
resulted in statistically significant increases in the levels 
of lysine and histidine in the feces. However, the incorpora¬ 
tion of ammonium salts into casein diets had no apparent 
effect on the amounts of amino acids in the feces. 

A study was made to compare the growth of rats fed diets 
containing either corn starch or sucrose as the source of 
carbohydrate. Hats fed ad libitum a ration containing 9% 
casein and 0.j>% methionine with corn starch as the source 
of carbohydrate, grew at a much higher rate than those fed 
a corresponding ration with sucrose as the source of carbo¬ 
hydrate. The addition of non-essential amino acids, B~

vitamins, a liver concentrate or sulfasuxidine did not 
change the marked differences observed. However, the 
nutritional efficiency of the sucrose ration was improved 
when histidine, valine, threonine, lysine, and tryptophan 
were included in small quantities. A possible explanation 
for the growth differences between animals fed corn starch 


and those fed sucrose was discussed

SECTION B 

INADEQUACY uF UNMODIFIED FOTATO STARCH 
AS DIETARY CARBOHYDRATE iTOR THE ALBINO RAT 

INTRODUCTION 

It was noted during the preceding investigation that 
potato starch, in contrast to corn starch, was poorly utilized 
by the rat. However, when the potato starch was autoclaved 
or oven-baked it was rendered more digestible. This was shown 
by the increase in the growth rate of rats fed rations containing 
either of these modified starches as the source of carbohydrate. 
Further study of potato starch as a dietary carbohydrate seemed 
warranted by these observations. 

A review of the literature revealed scattered reports 
published over the past half century which gave clear evidence 
that potato starch was poorly utilized. Several investigators 
15»9>10,1J found that the human body manifested much greater 
efficiency in the digestion of starches from cereal grains 
than in the digestion of starch from potatoes. Raw potato 
starch has also been shown to be poorly utilized by rats 
dogs i4;, guinea pigs 112;, hens (7), mice (3;, and sheep l6j. 

The digestibility of potato starch was shown to be greatly 
improved by cooking or by mechanically grinding the starch lllj. 

The present investigation was designed to study further 
the factors influencing the utilization of raw potato starch. 

The methods used in the pursuit of this objective were: 

(a) alteration of the rations in an attempt to improve the 




- 45 - 


utilization of potato starch by the rat; lb) a comparison 
of wheat, corn, and potato starches which were prepared in 
the laboratory without the use of chemicals; (c) a study 
of enzyme digestion of starches in vitro .

Exp eri mental 

Animal-feeding techniques 

Groups of weanling male rats of 40 to 50 grams body weight 
(21 to 2 5 days old) were used as the experimental animals. 

The 5 rats which comprised each group were housed in individual 
cages with raised screen floors and were given water ad libitum . 
As in Section A, Part I, the food intake was controlled by 
restricting the amount of ration offered each rat to 10 grams 
per day. Each animal was weighed weekly and individual food 
consumption records were kept. 

In experiment i, rats were fed 18% casein rations 
(Tables I and II), containing unmodified commercial potato 
starch as the source of carbohydrate, for a period of 4 weeks. 
Each ration contained one of the following supplements which 
was incorporated at the expense of potato starch: 7*5% 
celluflour; 57° lactose; 20% lactose; 57* sucrose; 20% sucrose. 

To maintain equivalent caloric intakes, the rats fed the 
ration which was supplemented with 7 *5°]o celluflour were each 
offered 10.7 to 10.8 grams of ration daily. The utilization 
of the carbohydrate component was assessed by (a) its capacity 
to promote growth and (b) its effect on the quantity of feces 
excreted by the rat. 

In experiment II, laboratory preparations of corn, wheat, 
and potato starches were compared as the source of carbohydrate 
in 20% casein rations. The composition of these rations was 







.

basically the same as shown in Tables I and II, but 20% casein 
was substituted for 18 % casein at the expense of the carbo¬ 
hydrate. After the experimental period of 3 weeks, one rat 
from each group was sacrificed and the gastrointestinal 
tracts were compared. 

Preparation of starches 

Wheat starch was prepared by working wheat flour into 
a paste with a small amount of water and extracting the paste 
several times with water to separate starch from the gluten. 
The starch granules were allowed to settle from the washings 
and the supernatant liquid was decanted. After repeated 

washings with water, the starch was air-dried at approximately 

o 

6o c. 

Potato starch was prepared from potatoes which were 

peeled, washed, and put through a meat grinder. The minced 

product was mixed thoroughly with water and then the pulp was 

separated from the starch granules by filtering the mixture 

through cotton cloth. After allowing the starch granules 

to settle, the supernatant liquid was decanted. After 

repeated washings with water, the starch was air-dried at 
, o 

approximately 60 U. 

uorn starch was prepared by shaking a quantity of corn 
meal with about 3 volumes of water in a large glass jar 
for one hour on the mechanical shaker. The starch granules, 
suspended in water, were transferred to another container, and

allowed to settle, rhe supernatant liquid was discarded and 
the corn starch thus obtained was air-dried at approximately 

6o°o. 

u-round potato starch was prepared by pulverizing com¬ 
mercial potato starch for 4 hours in a ball mill containing 
porcelain balls. 

■Enzyme digestion studies 

The rate of hydrolysis by pancreatin was determined 
in vitro for each of the starches prepared in the laboratory. 
The enzyme solution was prepared by shaking 230 mg. of 
pancreatin with 30 ml. of distilled water. The solution 
was centrifuged and the supernatant liquid was used as the 
source of alpha-amylase. 

The rate of hydrolysis of each of the starches was 

determined as follows: 230 mg. of the starch was placed in 

a 30 ml. rubber-3toppered cylinder. 3 ml. of the enzyme 

t. 

solution, 2 ml. of phosphate buffer ipH 7J, and distilled 
water to provide a total volume of 30 ml. were added. The 
starch granules were suspended in the liquid by shaking and 
then the cylinder was placed in an incubator at 30 °u. 3 ml. 

samples were taken from the cylinder after 0, 1, 3> and 20 
hours of incubation and the reducing power, expressed as 
maltose, was determined by the Somogyi method (14).

Results and Discussion 

The growth response of rats fed the supplemented potato 
starch rations and the respective average weights of the feces 
are shown in Table XII. The incorporation of celluflour 

into the basal ration did not appear to influence the 
utilization of potato starch by the rat. The increase in 
the weight of the feces excreted by rats fed this ration 
was probably due to the presence of undigested f celluflour. ? 

The inclusion of lactose or sucrose in the basal ration 

resulted in a slight increase in the rate of growth with a 
coincident decrease in the amount of feces excreted. The 
incorporation of 20 c /> of lactose or sucrose into the basal 
ration accentuated the increase in the rate of growth and 
the decrease in the amount of feces. It seems probable that 
the dissacharides were completely or almost completely 
assimilated, while the potato starch in the ration remained 
poorly utilized. 

The data for experiment I.b were obtained from experiments 
of Section A, Part 1, and are presented for comparison with 
the present results. The growth rate of rats fed rations 
containing autoclaved potato starch or dextrin as the source 
of carbohjnirate was approximately the same as that of rats 
fed rations with sucrose as the carbohydrate. Apparently, 
potato starch which was autoclaved or baked was well utilized 
by the rat.

In experiment II, the laboratory preparations of corn 
starch and wheat starch each supported a rate of growth 
which was only slightly lower than that induced by sucrose. 

Two rats, when fed the 207» casein ration with ground potato 
starch as the source of carbohydrate, grew at an average 
rate of 23 .0 grams per week. It would appear that wheat 
starch and corn starch are well utilized, and that grinding 
of the potato starch improves its utilization by the rat. 
Langworthy and Deuel (9) found that raw corn and wheat starches 
were completely utilized by human subjects. 

Meteorism lan extension of the abdomen by gas), which 
occurs with the ingestion of unmodified potato starch, was 
exhibited by rats fed the laboratory preparation of potato 
starch. A comparison of the gastro-intestinal tracts of 
the rats fed the different starches is shown in figure 2. 

The ingestion of unmodified potato starch caused a distension 
of the caecum and intestines. The main causative factors 
for this enlargement was thought to be due to the accumulation 
of food residue in the caecum and the formation of gases by 
fermentation of the food residue. In a previous experiment, 
it was found that the average dry weight of the gastrointestinal 
tracts of 3 rats fed an 18% casein ration with potato starch 
as the source of carbohydrate was 9.9 grams, whereas the 
corresponding average weight when rats were fed a ration 
with sucrose as the carbohydrate was 3.3 grams.

fhis marked difference in the weights of the gastrointestinal 
tracts was probably caused by a greater accumulation of food 
residue in the caecum, when potato starch was ingested. 
Langworthy and Deuel, working with human subjects, found 
that the ingestion of potato starch caused excessive forma¬ 
tion of gas and frequent intestinal cramps. Beazell, 

Schmidt, and ivy [1) later confirmed these findings and 
further suggested that bacterial fermentation may account 
for an important part of the breakdown of unmodified potato 
starch which occurred during passage through the alimentary 
tract. 

The extent of hydrolysis by pancreatin, of ground potato 
starch, wheat starch, corn starch, and unmodified potato 
starch is illustrated in .Figure 3* u-round potato starch was 
hydrolyzed very rapidly whereas the hydrolysis of unmodified 
potato starch was very slight. Pronounced hydrolysis 
occurred with both corn starch and wheat starch, but 
probably the presence of fatty or waxy material in the 
crudely prepared starches interfered with the action of 
amylase. Uonsiderable growth of microorganisms was 
noticed in the corn starch suspension after 20 hours of 
incubation and since reducing sugars had been consumed, 
the extent of hydrolysis of the corn starch could not be 
determined at this point. Sherman, Walker, and ualdwell [1J> j 
found that boiled potato starch showed a rate of enzymic 
hydrolysis equal to or slightly greater than that of the

cereal starches. Beazell et al. found that the quantity 
of reducing sugar obtained from raw potato starch never 
exceeded 7*6% of that obtained from the digestion of 
boiled starch. Since lengthening the incubation period to 
20 hours did not increase the quantity of raw potato starch 
digested, they suggested that as a result of mechanical 
rupture of the envelope of the starch granule during milling, 
a constant fraction of the raw starch may have been more 
easily digested than the remainder, in view of the results 
obtained by these investigators and the observations made 
during this study, it is likely that unmodified potato 
starch is appreciably digested by alpha-amylase only when 
the outermost layer or layers of the starch granules are 
ruptured. 

The observations made during this investigation were 
recently confirmed by Booher, Behan, and McMeans (2) in a 
report on the biological utilizations of unmodified and 
modified food starches. They suggested that the relatively 
low digestibilities of such unmodified starches as those 
from the potato, sago palm, and arrowroot are entirely 
attributable to a firmer degree of hydrogen-bonding of the 
molecules of the outermost layer or layers of the granules 
than occurs with starch granules from the cereal grains 
and cassava root. 

As a matter of general interest, it was noted that the 
"true" digestibility of the dietary protein appeared to 



vary directly with the digestibility of the carbohydrate 
component. The data from the protein digestibility study 
(Table IX) shows that the dietary protein was almost 
completely digested when either autoclaved potato starch 
or corn starch was used as the source of carbohydrate; 
whereas the digestibility of dietary protein was decreased 
when potato starch was the source of carbohydrate.

SUMMARY 

Unmodified potato starch was poorly utilized, whereas 
corn starch and wheat starch were almost completely digested 
by the rat. The ingestion of unmodified potato starch caused 
a distension of the caecum and intestines. This enlargement 
resulted from the accumulation of food residue in the caecum 
and the consequent formation of gas from fermentation. The 
utilization of unmodified potato starch did not appear 
to be improved by the incorporation of either lactose or 
sucrose into the ration. However, autoclaving, baking or 
grinding improved the utilization of potato starch by the 
rat. 

Digestion studies performed in vitro with pancreatin 
showed that pronounced hydrolysis of either corn starch or 
wheat starch occurred, but the hydrolysis of unmodified 
potato starch was very slight. Ground potato starch, however, 
was hydrolyzed very rapidly. The low digestibility of 
unmodified potato starch was attributed to the resistance 
of the outermost layer or layers of the starch granules to 
attack by alpha-amylase.
