CHAPTER I 


INTRODUCTION 

Educators are in a dilemma over the question of religious educa¬ 
tion in the public schools. Should time be given to religious instruc¬ 
tion during classroom hours? Should the classroom teacher be expected 
to teach religion? Should credits be given for religious courses? Who 
is to determine course content and the interpretation to be put upon it? 
These are just a few of the problems concerning religious education 
which plague educators today. Many experiments with religion in public 
education have been tried in Canada and the United States with varying 
degrees of success. On the #iole, a satisfactory solution has not been 
found. The main difficulty is in the lack of agreement as to what 
should be taught. No two sects are willing that their youth be indoc¬ 
trinated in the other’s peculiar tenets. 

A compromise has been made in Alberta vfaich is generally con¬ 
sidered to be worthless from the point of view of religionists. Ac¬ 
cording to Section lf>6 of the School Act; "All schools shall be 
opened by the reading, without explanation or comment, of a passage 
of scripture to be selected from those prescribed or approved for 
that purpose by the Minister, to be followed by the recitation of 
the Lord’s Prayer: 

Provided that any Board may, by resolution, dispense with 
the scripture reading or the recitation of the Lord’s Prayer or both." 

The reading of a passage of scripture without explanation or 
comment to avoid sectarian bias, is of very doubtful value, for it 
raises many questions which must go unanswered and leaves the young

enquiring mind in doubt and frustration. Beyond tbis half-hearted 
attempt to inculcate respect for the Deity the School Act makes 
religious instruction in the last half-hour of the school day 
"permissible*" These measures tell the story. Because of the 
division within the Protestant sectarian religions it has been 
impossible to find one workable solution. In some towns of Alberta 
there has been open hostility to religious instruction in the last 
half-hour of the day* Popular opinion has not accepted this meas¬ 
ure as a solution to the problem. 

In the United States, at the opening of the 20th Century, 
people sought to connect the public school with religious instruc¬ 
tion without violating the century-old tradition of the divorce of 
church and state in the matter of religious education* The prin¬ 
cipal form was that of arranging for released public school time 
during which children could attend religious instruction at churches 
of their choice or pastors of these churches could come to the public 
school and offer instruction to members of their respective flocks. 

This attempt at a solution of the problem was not, on the whole, suc¬ 
cessful, and a great deal of harsh criticism has been directed against 
it. The latest approach to a solution Is that of introducing "charac¬ 
ter education" into the schools* This would certainly avoid sectarian 
bias and the division over what to teach, but it would not give religi¬ 
ous education in the commonly accepted meaning of that term. 

One method of discovering the "common elements" in Protestant 
religions, which might successfully be integrated into a religious 
program acceptable to all Protestants, is that of examining what is

being done, with apparent success, by the private Protestant schools. 

One purpose of this thesis is to attempt to find common elements within 
these private schools which might profitably b© adopted by the public 
schools. 

Another vital purpose of this thesis is to investigate the nature 
of the growth of these private Protestant affiliated schools. They are 
not indigenous to Alberta. At the beginning of the century they were 
not in existence. Educators must be in possession of the facts concer¬ 
ning the conduct of these schools and the contribution which they are 
making to education. If the contribution is creditable these schools 
should be encouraged and emulated. This thesis is an attempt to ap¬ 
praise the status of these schools, and to examine their academic and 
religious curricula with a view to discovering elements which might b© 
carried over into the public schools.

THE PROBLEM EOR INVESTIGATION 

1. The Problem 

The general problem is to investigate the significance of Pro¬ 
testant affiliated and accredited schools in the Alberta educational 
system. This significance will be ascertained in terms of such di¬ 
mensions as number, size, academic efficiency and emphasis on reli¬ 
gion. An effort will be made to evaluate their present status, past 
accomplishments and especially all trends which will give an insight 
into their potentialities for the future. 

2. Sub-Problems 

1, Examining the Electives Offered . - The above statement of 
the problem can be logically broken down into a number of smaller sub¬ 
problems. One of these is to examine the electives offered in these 
private, Protestant schools to determine whether or not they are be¬ 
ing kept at a minimum to allow more time for the religious programs. 
There is a minimum number of electives required by the Department of 
Education before these schools can be "accredited". This minimum 
permits university matriculation upon graduation. It is important 

to know Tf&ether these Protestant accredited schools offer just the 
minimum to "get by" or whether they are interested in enriching 
their academic offerings. 

2. Examining the Religious Programs . - Another part of the 
problem is to examine the religious programs of these schools. It 
is important to know how much time is spent on religious instruction 
within foimal school hours and how much time, if any, is given to 
religious instruction outside formal school hours. It is equally

important to know what these schools are offering in their religious 
curricula by way of subject matter and devotional exercises. The 
conduct of these courses and exercises will, to a limited degree, find 
a place in this thesis. 

3. Surveying School Populations . - In order to determine the 
rate of growth or decline of these schools it will be necessary to ex¬ 
amine student populations over a number of years. If the number of 
schools has increased or decreased over a period of years, this also 
will be indicative of expansion or decline. A similar survey will be 
made of the number of teachers over the same period of time which may 
or may not prove to be significant. 

4* Examining the Accomplishments of the Schools . - Another 
part of the problem consists in investigating the results achieved by 
these schools. In order to do this we must know the percentage of 
students who graduate with the high school diploma, the percentage who 
graduate with university matriculation and the approximate percentage 
of students who @0 on to university. A knowledge of these facts, to¬ 
gether with the other info mat ion contained in this thesis, will enable 
one to assess the contribution made by these schools to the work of 
educating the youth of our province. 

5 . Appraising Teacher Qualifications . - An important part of 
the problem is to examine the qualifications of teachers in these 
schools, since the qualification of the teachers will be some crite¬ 
rion of the quality of teaching done. 

6. Investigating any Common Elements . - Another sub-problem 
of first importance is to discover any common elements within the re-

ligious curricula of these schools which might have implications for 
the public schools of the province* If it is found that no common 
elements exist, that in itself would also be an important discovery. 

7. Suggesting Implications for the Future . - To be forewarned 
is to be forearmed. Educators must know the facts to be able to deal 
ihtelligently with them. If it is found that there is anything sinis¬ 
ter or undesirable about the schools under this survey the facts should 
be made public. On the other hand, if these schools are functioning in 
a way which reflects credit upon education in Alberta, educators must 
be informed in order that they may encourage their growth and emulate, 
as far as possible, their example. Part of the problem then, is to 
suggest what the implications for the future seem to be. 

8 . Discovering Trends . - Educators will be interested to know 
what trends of development or change are apparent in these Protestant 
affiliated and accredited secondary schools in Alberta. We must exam¬ 
ine the religious and academic curricula of these schools to ascertain 
the answer to certain questions. Is there a trend towards increase or 
decrease of academic offerings? Are these schools growing or declining? 

Are they improving teacher qualifications or do they seem to b© content 
with existing status? The answer to these questions may reveal significant 
developmental trends which are of vital importance to students of educa¬ 
tion in Alberta. 

3. Purposes of the Investigation. 

The purposes of the investigation can be outlined as follows: 

1. To examine the religious programs of these schools with a view 
to revealing any common elements which may exist in them.

CHAPTER III 


METHOD OF GATHERING DATA 
1. Limiting the Sample 

This investigation is intended to be illustrative, but not final 
or comprehensive. Catholic schools are excluded from the survey. All 
of the private, religious schools, which, although they are doing com¬ 
mendable work with Alberta youth, do not offer university matriculation 
upon graduation, are excluded from the survey. Only private schools, 
which are affiliated with some Protestant denomination, and which are 
accredited by the Department of Education because they offer courses 
leading to university matriculation, are the subjects for this investi¬ 
gation. Moreover, within these private, Protestant affiliated schools, 
only the secondary grades, that is to say, grades X, XI and XII, are in¬ 
cluded in this study. The investigation is also limited to the province 
of Alberta.

2* Documents Used in Gathering Data 

Two data-gathering techniques were used to find the information 
contained in this thesis® First, a questionnaire was sent out to the 
principals of each of the eight schools in the survey, asking for in¬ 
formation relating to: 

1 ® Electives taught in the year 194 $ - 49 * 

2. Formal school hours, as defined in Section 150 of the School 
Act® 

3® Times when religious instruction is offered within the formal 
school hours® 

4® Times when religious instruction is offered outside formal 


school hours

5. Times when devotional exercises are held during formal school

7. Devotional exercises held during formal school hours. 

8 . Devotional exercises held outside formal school hours. 

9. Titles of religious courses offered and textbooks used. 

10. Status of school with regard to student graduation. 

11. Academic and religious qualifications of teachers. 

The other technique employed was a two-table device filled out 
by the writer himself at the Department of Education from the students* 
Form-A cards. It must be kept in mind that the information upon these 
records will not exactly correspond with that gathered from the schools 
themselves, the reason being that the school principals present their 
whole program, curricular and extra-curricular, accredited and non- 
accredited, while the Form-A card is concerned only with courses pres¬ 
cribed and accredited by the Department of Education. Both records 
are important and essential to this study. The principals of these 
schools could not be expected to supply the data for the ten-year in¬ 
terval. These data were gleaned from the Form-A cards. Information 
for the year 1948-49, however, was supplied by the principals and ap¬ 
pears much richer and fuller than that taken from the cards. There¬ 
fore, the data from the A-cards will not do justice to these schools, 
but it will serve a useful purpose in that it may reveal trends ich 

are significant.

instruction either before or after school hours. All the schools except 
one spend time on devotional exercises during school hours. All but one 
spend time on devotional exercises outside of classroom hours. 

The average total time given to religious instruction during and out¬ 
side school hours is 2 hours and 3 minutes. The School Act allows 2j hours 
per grade per week for religious instruction in the public schools, but 
this time is not used by the public schools for that purpose. The average 
total time spent per grade per week on devotional exercises during and out¬ 
side school hours is 3 hours and $1 minutes. The average total time spent 
during formal classroom hours on religious devotion and instruction is 2 
hours and 48 minutes. 

The average total time spent on all religious activities during and 
outside school hours is f> hours and 54»7 minutes per grade, per week, in 
each school. Even this total does not represent all the time spent on 
religion in the schools because various activities are mentioned on the 
questionnaire for which no definite allotted time is given. For example, 
Concordia College stated that: "Every second Friday night a number of 
students attend Bible classes in their respective churches." Mount Royal 
College reports: "We regret that we cannot give any definite times for our 
devotional exercises outside classroom hours. They are held at various 
times during the day or week, at the convenience of deans or whatever 
instructors or leaders may be concerned." When we consider that these 
schools offer academic courses which lead to university matriculation as 
well as devoting on an average of at least 6 hours a week to religi,ous 
education, we must acknowledge that they are giving creditable service to 
Alberta youth.

Table VI shows which devotional exercises are held in the schools 
and the number of schools in which each is held. No schools in the sur¬ 
vey have catechism during school hours. Only one school holds religious 
discussions in classroom hours. Two have scripture memorization. The 
most common forms of devotion during school hours In descending order 
are scripture reading, prayer, singing and sermons. 

Outside foimal school hours catechism is held in only one of the 
schools. (Scripture memorization is held in two of the schools outside 
sehool hours.) Three have sennons outside classroom time. The most 
common devotional exercises held before or after school hours in des¬ 
cending order are singing, prayer, scripture reading and religious dis¬ 
cussions. It is interesting to note that religious discussions, which

Table VII presents the titles or designations of courses offered 
on religion and the titles of religious textbooks used. On© school 
reports no formal instruction in religion. Of the seven remaining schools 
which give formal religious instruction six have definite prescribed 
courses to follow, one reports no definite courses on religion. 

All of the schools which follow prescribed courses, excepting one, 
use the Bible, in part or entire. The one exception is a school which 
offers a course on "Literature of the Old Testament" through a book 
called The Master by I. R. Bowie. Another school follows only Acts and 
St. .John in the New Testament. Two of the schools study nothing but the 
Bible. Of the six schools which have prescribed courses, four study in 
addition to the Bible some other religious book. Alberta College has 
"Mission Study" for two hours twice a month in which they study a book 
called China . Concordia College follows Luther*s Small Catechism, a

handbook of Christian doctrine* Mount Royal College studies a book 
called The Master by J. R* Bowie* Canadian Union College studies, be¬ 
sides the Bible, two textbooks, one called Youth Problems , another 
Academic Doctrine . 

An examination of these data would seem to indicate that there is 
one common denominator which might serve as a basis for a common program 
in the public schools, the Bible* However, it is too much to expect that 
the Bible is taught without sectarian bias in any of the schools in the 
survey. Hence we are left with a few devotional exercises as a possible 
basis for a common program, viz. scripture reading, prayer, singing and 
sermons, which are the most popular forms of devotional exercises in 
these schools. The scripture reading, to suit everyone, would have to b© 
without explanation or comment, and sermons would be subject to the same 
variable factors as Bible study. Hence, we are reduced to three forms of 
devotional practice viz. scripture reading without explanation or comment, 
prayer and singing* The School Act provides for the first two, and we emerge 
with one possible addition to out present school curricula, singing. 

4* Conclusions Relating to Data Presented in Chapter IV. 

Subject to the limitations of methods used in gathering data the 
following conclusions emerge from the data presented in this chapter: 

1. The average amount of time spent by these sc too Is on religious 
activities during classroom hours is little more than that 
allotted by the School Act to the public high schools. The 
School Act allows hours per week, these schools average 
2 hours and IS minutes per week.

2. These schools have vigorous programs of a religious nature in 
addition to offering the academic subjects prescribed by the 
Department of Education. On an average, approximately six hours 
a week are given to religious work in and out of school hours. 

3 . an impressive program of extra-curricular religious activities 
is offered in these schools. Just over three hours a week are 
given, on an average, to religious activities outside school 
hours. 

4 . The most common devotional exercises are: scripture reading, 
prayer, singing and sermons. 

5 . The Bible and its supplements form the most common basis for 
course content. 

6 . Very little beyond what is provided for in the School Act might 
be abstracted from the programs of these schools for adoption 
in the public schools.

Table VIII shows that in the year 1948-1949 Alberta College offered 
six academic and three commercial electives in Grade X and in Grade XI, 
twelve general electives in Grade X, and eleven in Grade XI. However, 
credits were given by the Department of Education for only five general 
electives in Grade X and two in Grade XI. It is well to point out that 
no student would be allowed to take all of the general electives offered 
in this school in Grade X or in Grade XI and that no student would likely 
take more than three or four at the most. This is a good example of the 
variety of subjects offered and the extra work done by these schools. All 
of the schools in the survey more or less conform to this pattern. 

Alberta College offered seven academic electives, no eomercial, 
and two general electives to Grad© XII. Here again, the Department gave 
no credits for the two general electives offered in Grade XII. It will 
be noted that no technical electives were offered at Alberta College in 
the year 1948-1949*

none in Grade XII in any school. Grade XII, except for academic electives, 
receives very little by way of options in these schools. In Grade XII are 
offered no comaercial and no technical electives. In three of the schools 
no general electives are taught in Grade XII. In four of the schools one is 
offered, and in one school two general electives are offered in Grad© XII. 

2. Conclusions Relating to Data Presented in Chapter V. 

The following conclusions emerge from the data presented in this 

chapt er: 

1. An adequate selection of academic and general electives is 
offered in the schools under the survey. 

2. Commercial electives are being offered in half of the schools, 
largely in Grade X. 

3. Grade XII in these schools receives a good choice of academic 


4 


electives, but little else by way of options. 

Technical electives are practically unknown in these schools.

Table XVII shows the number of electives offered at Alberta 
College each year of the ten-year period (1939-49)* It will be noted 
that seven academic electives were taught in 1939-40, but six has been 
the maximum number taught since that year. The reason for this lies 
in the fact that German, which was being offered in 1939-40 has not been 
offered since that year at Alberta College* This holds true for Grades 
XI and XII also, where one more course was offered in 1939-40 than has 
been offered in any year since* 

Table XVII reveals that, except for the year 1945-4&, Alberta 
College has offered a good program of commercial electives to Grade X 
since 1940-41, with Grade XI lagging a little behind some years and 
Grade XII receiving no instruction in commercial electives throughout 
the ten-year period* No technical electives were taught at Alberta 
College in the ten-year period,, A fair variety ©f general electives 
was offered in Grade X in the ten-year period, fewer in Grade XI and 
none in Grade XII since 1940*

Table XXII shows the number ©f electives offered at Canadian 
Union College each year ©f the ten-year period, 1939-1949® A fair choice 
of academic electives was taught in Grades X and XJ and ©specially in 
Grade XII during the ten years. Except for 1 eomnereial elective in 
Grade XI in 1939-40, commercial electives were not taught at Canadian 
Union until 1947-4® when two were taught in Grade X* The next year two 
were added in Grade XI, but none in Grade HI, Technical electives took 
a similar course, being introduced to Grade X in 1946-47» then added to 
Grade XI, but not Grade XII, the next year. An extraordinary variety of 
general electives was offered to Grade X at Canadian Union College through 
a number of years in the ten-year period® Grade XI was not so favored 
and Grade XII was altogether neglected in the field of general electives®

Alberta Mennonite had its inception as an accredited, private 
school in the year 1946* Consequently, nothing appears on the records for 
this school before that date# Table XIV shows that this little school 
made a brave start in 1946 by offering three academic electives to Grades 
X and XI and four to Grade XII. Commercial and technical electives were 
luxuries beyond their capacity, but they did manage to offer three general 
electives to Grade X in 1946-47 an<i bwo to Grade II by 1947* Alberta 
Mennonite has, in general, maintained the status with which it began in 
1946o

2, Conclusions Relating to Data Presented in Chapter VI* 

The following conclusions ©merge from the data presented in 
this chapter: 

a® There is no significant trend apparent with regard to the 
offering of academic electives in these schools throughout 
the ten-year interval, 

b. Half of the schools offered commercial electives during the 
ten-year period but no consistent pattern is apparent. Two 
of the schools added two or three commercial electives during 
the years, one showed no change and the other decreased its 
offerings, 

c. Technical electives did not appear in any of the schools 
through the ten-year period except that Canadian Union College 
introduced two in Grade X in 1946 and two more in Grad© XX 

in 1947. 

d. An adequate choice of general electives was offered in Grade X 
in all of the schools through the ten-year interval, but no 
trend is apparent, 

e. There was a slight increase in the number of general electives 
offered in Grad© XI through the ten-year period, 

f. Grade XXI received no general electives in four of th© schools 
through the ten-year interval. The other four schools offered 
very few general electives in Grad© XII,

The method chosen to appraise teachers* academic qualifications 
is that of comparing the qualifications of teachers in the schools of the 
survey with qualifications of teachers in public high schools® These 
public high schools have been chosen at random throughout Alberta with 
no attempt to match school for school® Seven public high schools, whose 
total teacher population approximates that of the private schools, were 
chosen® 

The following facts appear from the data in Tables XXV and XXVI, 

a. The percentage of teachers in the private high schools holding 
two degrees is 27*7$» 

b® The percentage of teachers in the public high schools holding 
two degrees is 15% * 

c® The percentage of teachers In the private high schools who 
have one degree is 1+6%, 

d. The percentage of teachers in the public high schools who 
have one degree is 48$.

3. Conclusions Relating to Data in Chapter VII. 

Subject to the limitations of the data-gathering procedures used 
the following conclusions emerge from the data presented in this chapter. 

a. These schools are above average in the academic qualifica¬ 
tions of their teachers. In the private schools 73*7$ of the 
teachers have one or two degrees as compared to 63% in the 
public high schools. 

b. The percentage of teachers with two degrees in the private 
schools is almost double the percentage in the public schools, 

27.7# in the private schools as against 15$ in the public high 
schools. 

c. The schools of the survey are, on the whole, staffed by teachers 
well qualified to conduct religious activities and to guide the 
youth of our province*

CHAPTER VIII 

PUPIL AND TEACHER POPULATIONS AND STUDENT GRADUATIONS 
1* Ten-Year Summary of Student Populations* 

The simplest way of ascertaining the growth or decline of the 
schools in the survey is to examine student enrollment over a period of 
yearso It should be kept in mind that the statistics presented in this 
section come from the students* Form-A cards which list only full-time 
students* A number of the schools, perhaps all, have an enrollment almost 
double that shown on the A-eards® For example, Alberta College, in the 
year 1946-47 had an enrollment of 130 in day-school and 100 in evening- 
school* The A-card for that year lists 85 full-time students and makes 
no mention of the enrollment for evening-school. However, the data which 
follow are valid and useful for indicating population trends*

Table XXVTII shows the populations of students in the Protestant 
affiliated and accredited secondary schools in Alberta for each year of 
the ten-year interval, 1939-1949* According to this table, allowing for 
fluctuations within schools and variations from school to school, the 
general trend has been a steady growth from a total number of students in 
all the schools in the year 1939-40 of 319, to a total number of 765 in 
the year 1946-47* The year 1947-48 shows a slight decline, but the year 
1948-49 a come-back, almost to the high of 1946-47* In view of this rise 
in 1948-49, a slight decline apparent in 1947-48 may not be significant. 

Of the eight schools in the survey one only shows a drop in student 
population at the end of the ten-year period to an enrollment lower than 
that in the initial year. Three of the schools show a spectacular expan¬ 
sion during the ten-year period, Concordia College from an enrollment of 22 
in 1939 to 111 in 1949, Mt. Royal from 44 to 149, and Canadian Union from 
48 to 226. Th© over-all population of the schools more than doubled during 
the ten-year interval.

Table XXIX shows the number of teachers teaching in each of the 
schools in the survey, each year of the ten-year period. 

The totals for Table XXIX show a trend to increase teachers throu^i 
the ten-year period® After an initial drop in the first two years of the 
war the total number of teachers began more or less steadily to increase 
from a total for all schools of 39 in 1941~42 to a total of 54 in 1946-49* 
The drop from a total of 46 teachers in all schools in 1939 to 39 teachers 
in 1941 might be accounted for in two ways. First, teachers may have been 
leaving their positions to enlist in the war. Second, Geiman, which was 
being taught in 1939 , was generally dropped during the war. Latin, too 
fell off in a number of schools during the ten-year period.

An attest is made here to ascertain the standard of the private 
Protestant schools with regard to such facts as the number of graduates 
obtaining the high school diploma, number earning university matriculation, 
approximate percentage vto.0 go on to university. In order to do this it was 
necessary to find provincial norms with which to compare the records of the 
schools in the survey. Statistics for this purpose were supplied by the 
Registrar of the University of Alberta from the University Statistical 
Report and from statistics supplied by Mr. Evensen, Associate Director of 
Curriculum. 

Tables XXXI and XXXII show that in 1946 there were Ii.3% of Grade 
XII students in Alberta who earned university matriculation, as compared 
to 17.5% in the private schools in the year 1948* Assuming that these per¬ 
centages would remain fairly constant from year to year these figures favor 
the private schools. 

These tables further reveal that in 1946 there were 26% of Grade 
XII students in Alberta who graduated with the high school diploma as 


1} Provincial norms for Table XXXIII were supplied by the Registrar of 
the University of Alberta and are from the University Statistical 
Report.

went on to university from the private schools with the percentage from the 
province as a whole* There were 32*5$ of graduates who went to university 
in 1948 from the private schools as compared to 14*7$ from the province as 
a whole that same year* These figures show that over twice as many gradua¬ 
tes went to university from the private schools as went from the province 
as a whole. 

3* Conclusions Relating to Data Presented in Chapter VIII 

Subject to the limitations of the data-gathering procedures used and 
the human element involved, the following conclusions ©merge from the data 
presented in this chapter* 

a. There is rapid growth in these schools* In the last decade the 
total population of the eight schools in the survey more than 
doubled, from 319 in 1940 to 754 in 1949® Also the number of 
schools increased from 7 in 1940 to 8 in 1946. 1 

b. The number ©f teachers increased during the ten-year interval 
from 48 in all the schools in 1940 to 54 in 1949 * 

c. The record of these schools with regard to the number of stu¬ 
dents earning the high school diploma is higher than the average 
for the province as a whole. In 1946, 26% of Grade XII students 
in Alberta obtained the high school diploma. In 1948, 29.7% of

students in the private high schools*^ 
d* The record of these schools with respect to the number of stu¬ 
dents who earn university matriculation is above the average 
for the province as a whole* In 1948, 17*5% of Grade XII 
students in the private schools earned university matriculation. 
In 1946, 11*3$ of Grade XII students in the province obtained 
university matriculation. 

e. The record of these schools with regard to the number of their 
graduates who go on to university is impressive. The percent¬ 
age for the private schools was 32 . 5 $ in 1948 as compared to 
14 * 7 $ for the province the same year. 1 2 
The apparently high record of these schools with respect to the 
number of their students earning the high school diploma, university matri¬ 
culation and the number who go on to university, may be due to a higher 
degree of selectivity of students, or it may be due to a superior school 
environment. The real reason would be difficult to determine. 


1) Data for (c) and (d) concerning student graduation for the pro¬ 
vince as a whole were supplied by Mr. Evenson, Associate Direc¬ 
tor of Curriculum. Facts for the private schools are from the 
questionnaire. Conclusions (c) and (d) are valid subject to 
the correctness of the assumption that provincial norms relat¬ 
ing to these facts remain fairly constant from year to year. 

2) Data for (e) is from the University Statistical Report.

CHAPTER IX 
CONCLUSIONS 

This chapter will be devoted to conclusions which emerge from the 
data presented in this thesis* The conclusions will be set down under 
headings corresponding to the purposes of the thesis as detailed in 
Chapter II* Subject to the limitations of the data-gathering procedures, 
and subject to all the human factors which may be involved, the following 
conclusions emerge* 

1* Conclusions Relating to Religious Programs* 

I* The schools of the survey are fostering religious education in 

Alberta to the extent of 1 hour and 20 minutes for religious 
instruction in school hours, 43*7 minutes for religious instruction 
outside school hours, 1 hour and 20 minutes for devotional exercises 
during school hours and 2 hours and 23 minutes for devotional exer¬ 
cises outside school hours* These times are averages, per grade, 
per week* 

2* Due to the varying points of emphasis in Protestant religions very 

little can be abstracted from the religious curricula of these 
schools by way of common elements for adoption by the public 
schools* The only religious practice common in the private schools 
during school hours which is not provided for in the School Act is 
singing* 

2* Conclusions Relating to Academic Offerings. 

1* An adequate selection of academic and general electives is offered 

in most of the schools of the survey.

Commercial electives are taught in only half of the schools. 
Technical electives are unknown in seven schools out of eight. 

3 * Conclusions Relating to Pupil and Teacher 
Populations. 

The private Protestant schools studied in this survey show, on the 
whole, a significant growth in pupil population in the last decade, 
during which they more than doubled in student population. 

These schools, after an initial drop in teacher population in the 
first two years of the war, showed a more or less steady increase 
in the number of teachers up to 1949 * The total number of teachers 
increased from 39 in 1942 to 54 in 1949 . 

4. Conclusions Relating to Student Graduation. 

The record of these schools with regard to the number of students 
who earn university matriculation is above the average for the 
province as a whole. In the private schools 17*5% of Grade XII 
students obtained university matriculation in 1948 as compared to 
11.3% in the province as a whole in the year 1946. The norms for 
the province remain fairly constant from year to year. Whether 
the high record of these schools is due to a higher degree of 
selectivity of students or whether it is caused by other factors 
in the school environment, would be difficult to ascertain. 

These schools stand high with regard to the number of their stu¬ 
dents who graduate with the high school diploma. In 1946 , 26% of 
Grade XII students in Alberta obtained the high school diploma. In 
1948 29.7% of Grade XII students in the private schools obtained 
the high school diploma.

The record of these schools with regard to the number of their 
graduates who go on to university is significantly high. The 
percentage for the private schools was 32 * 5 $ * n 194& as compared 
to 14 * 7 % Tor the province the same year. 

% Conclusions Relating to Teacher Qualifications. 

These schools have a high record with regard to the number of teachers 
holding degrees. The percentage of their teachers having one or 
two degrees is 73 . 7 % as compared to 63 % in the public high schools. 

The religious qualifications of the teachers appear to be high. 

6. Conclusions Relating to Trends Apparent in 
This Survey. 

The trend is for these schools to grow and expand in a number of 
directions: student populations, number of teachers, number of 
schools (one school was added during the 10-year period) but only 
alight increase in the number of subjects offered. 

7* Implications Growing Out of the Findings in 
This Thesis. 

Schools which send over thirty percent of their graduates to 
university are making a laudable contribution to education. 

This is the record of the private Protestant high schools in 
Alberta. Therefore, the implication is that they should b© 
encouraged to carry on and assisted to expand. 

The data presented in this thesis indicates that these schools 
mere than doubled in population during the last decade. The 
implication is that they will likely continue to grow in the 
future. Therefore, it behooves educators in Alberta to be in-
