ABSTRACT 


The conditions at which methane-ethylene and 
methane-propylene mixtures form solid hydrates in the 
presence of liquid water have been determined for pressures 
up to 2000 lb/in. abs. Experimental data for the vapor, 
hydrate and water-rich liquid equilibrium in the ethylene- 
water system have been extended from £67 to 2000 Ib/in.^abs. 

Solid-vapor equilibrium ratios were calculated for 
ethylene and propylene. A comparison between predicted 
and actual hydrate forming conditions for a methane- 
ethylene-propylene mixture showed that these equilibrium 
ratios must be used cautiously. 

Schematic phase diagrams are presented which depict 
the phase relations peculiar to the metlrane-propylene- 
water system.

I. INTRODUCTION 

A number of gases, including the to paraffinic and 
olefinic hydrocarbon gases, when under pressure and in the presence 
of water, will form solid hydrates. For example, methane appears to 
react with approximately seven molecules of water to form a solid 
crystal resembling snow or ice, that is 

CH^ (gas) + 7H 2 0 (liquid) ->• CH/^HgO (solid) 

The temperatures, at which hydrates will form, are dependent upon 
pressure and may extend considerably above 32°F. 

The industrial importance of this phenomenon was first realized 
in 1934 when Hammerscbmidt (?) informed the natural gas industry that 
the formation of solid compounds of methane, ethane, propane and 
butane and water were responsible for the plugging of natural gas 
transmission lines. More generally, hydrate formation may occur in 
any equipment involved in the production, transmission and processing 
of light hydrocarbon gases where liquid water may be present along with 
favorable conditions of temperature and pressure. The solid hydrate will 
accumulate at low spots in pipe lines or around valves and fittings 
until the lines may become entirely plugged. 

: Prevention of liquid water deposition, and consequently hydrate 
formation, is ordinarily accomplished by dehydration of the gas. To 
determine when and to what extent the gas should be dehydrated, it is 
necessary to know the conditions of temperature and pressure at which 
hydrate formation is possible, as well as to have equilibrium moisture 
content data for the gas.

Hydrate forming conditions have been investigated for many 
pure hydrocarbon gases and for many different natural gases. Katz (l) 
and his co-workers, at the University of Michigan, have prepared a 
correlation which can be used to predict hydrate forming conditions for 
mixtures of the components generally found in natural gases; namely 
C]_ to C4 paraffinic hydrocarbons, hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide. 

Although ethylene and propylene are known to form hydrates no 
previous attempt has been made to include these gases in the above 
mentioned correlation. This, along with the fact that ethylene and 
propylene are common components of many process gas streams in 
industrial petro-chemical plants, has warranted a further investi¬ 
gation of hydrate forming conditions for these pure unsaturated 
hydrocarbon gases and for mixtures of gases containing these olefins. 

This report describes an investigation of the hydrate equil¬ 
ibria in the methane-ethylene-water system, the methane-propylene- 
water system and associated binary hydrocarbon-water systems. ‘These 
systems were chosen so that the experimental data could be used to 
include ethylene and propylene in a correlation of the type developed 
by Katz (l).

II. LITERATURE REVIEW 

(1) Historical Aspects 

The first experimental investigations of the formation of 
hydrates in gas-water systems are adequately reviewed by Katz and 
Rzasa (8), Hammerschmidt (7) and by Schroeder (18). According to 
these sources, Humphrey Davy in 1810 discovered the first known 
hydrate, a crystalline compound formed from chlorine and water. 
Cailletet in 1878 reported acetylene hydrate and was the first to 
discover that a sudden decrease in pressure aided in the formation 
of these crystalline compounds. Woehler in 1840 reported a hydrate 
of hydrogen sulfide. Villard (21,22), working in the period between 
1880-1900, made an extensive experimental study of gas hydrates 
including the determination of decomposition curves of methane, 
ethane and ethylene hydrates. De Forcrand (6), working during the 
same period, was the first to attempt the determination of the com¬ 
position of hydrates by thermodynamic methods. No further work was 
reported on gas hydrates until 1934* when Hammerschmidt (7) related 
hydrate formation to the freezing of natural gas transmission lines. 

He obtained experimental data on hydrate formation conditions for a 
number of natural gases and investigated ways of preventing their 
formation. 

Hammerschmidt f s work touched off a renewed interest in gas 
hydrates and a number of workers have since contributed greatly to 
this field. Deaton and Frost (2,3) studied decomposition curves for a

number of natural gases as well as for methane, ethane, propane and 
mixtures of methane with various concentrations of other hydrocarbons. 

They also attempted to determine the composition of paraffinic hydrates 
and found pressure-temperature data for several pure gases below 32°F (4). 
Roberts et al. (14,15)* in 1940 and 1941, presented an excellent discussion 
of the methane-water and ethane-water systems. Katz et al. have contri¬ 
buted significantly to the hydrate field. Wilcox, Carson and Katz (23,1), 
in 1941, introduced vapor-solid equilibrium constants, for use in calcul¬ 
ating and predicting hydrate forming conditions for natural gases. 

Carson and Katz (l) studied the methane-propane-water, methane-pentane- 
water and methane-hexane-water systems. Their results indicated that 
the paraffin hydrocarbons formed solid solutions. They also found no 
evidence for the existence of hydrates of the pentanes and heavier 
hydrocarbons. Kobayashi and Katz (9) studied the methane hydrate at 
high pressures. Unruh and Katz (20) investigated hydrates in the 
methane-carbon dioxide-water system and Noaker and Katz (10) studied 
the me thane-hydro gen sulfide-water system. Reamer, Selleck and Sage (13) 
in 1952 studied the propane-water and propylene-water systems in the 
hydrate region and, in addition, obtained limited data on the propane- 
propylene -water system. An extensive study of the ethylene-water system 
was undertaken by Diepen and Scheffer (5) in 1950. 

Parent (12) made a very complete appraisal of the technical and 
patent literature pertaining to the reaction of paraffinic hydrocarbon

gases with water to form solid hydrates and to the storage and subsequent 
decomposition of these substances. He concluded that there is an inade¬ 
quate amount of data available in the published literature to permit a 
plant design; there being a need for quantitative rate data, heat capa¬ 
cities and pressure-temperature equilibrium data for more typical natural 
gases. However he felt that the process involving the formation of 
hydrocarbon hydrates from natural gas and water at times of low demand 
for the gas, followed by storage and subsequent regasification during 
the peak load season, appeared to warrant further investigation. 

The basic method of preventing hydrate formation in a gas is 
dehydration. A number of investigators (7,17,19), beginning with 
Hammerschmidt (7) in 1934, have studied methods of dehydration. 

Figure 1 is a temperature-pressure plot showing hydrate equil¬ 
ibrium curves that have been determined for binary hydrocarbon-water 
systems. Curves are also shown for two nonhydrocarbon hydrate forming 
components of natural gas; hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide. The 
equilibrium curves shown depict the temperatures and pressures at which 
the respective gases will form hydrates in the presence of water. 

The curves for n-butane and i-butane are dotted because reliable 
experimental data do not exist. The range of temperatures and pres¬ 
sures for their hydrate equilibria is very narrow and the formation 
of ice interferes with the crystallization of a solid hydrate phase 
and masks any hydrate that my be formed.

(2) Previous Work on Systems Under Investigation 

(a) Methane-Water System 

Villard (21,22) published data on methane hydrate in 1888. The 
data was considered quite reliable. He worked over a very wide range 
of pressures and temperatures and stated that 70.7°F was the highest 
temperature at which the solid hydrate could be formed. Deaton and 
Frost (3), in 1940, published more data for this system in the temper¬ 
ature range of 33°F to 55°F. Their sample was 99*7 percent methane 
and 0.3 percent carbon dioxide. Roberts et al. (14,15) reported some 
data in 1940 and 1941* The methane used was 99*9 percent pure. In 
1946 Deaton and Frost (3) reported data for the vapor, ice and hydrate 
equilibrium. Finally, in 1948, Kobayashi and Katz (9) reported the 
results of a study of methane hydrate at pressures up to 11,200 lb/in. abs. 
Their work disproved Villard f s postulate that a critical decomposition 
temperature of 70.7°F existed for this system. By extrapolating the 
data of Katz and Kobayashi, it appears that a pressure of 40,000 lb/in.^abs. 
will cause hydrate to form at a temperature of 100°F. The published 
data are presented in Table I. 

(b) Ethylene-Water System 

Villard (21,22) was the first to obtain some data for this 
system and he reported experimental data for the three-phase equilibrium, 
hydrate, vapor and water-rich liquid, at temperatures from 32°F to 63°F 
and pressures from 95*5 lb/in.^abs. to 867 lb/in.^abs. By extrapolating

his data, Villard reported a critical decomposition temperature of 
65-7°F for this system. Diepen and Scheffer (5) reported data for the 
three-phase equilibria, vapor, ice and hydrate and vapor, water-rich 
liquid and hydrate, from 5°F to 64»4°F, at pressures up to 793 lb/in.^abs. 
They also reported data for the metastable equilibria, vapor, hydrocarbon- 
rich liquid and water-rich liquid, and hydrate, hydrocarbon-rich liquid 
and vapor. Reamer, Selleck and Sage (13) reported some data for this 
system but their data is somewhat scattered and does not agree very 
well with the data of (21,22) and (5)» The published data for this system 
are presented in Table II. 

(c) Propylene-Water System 

Reamer, Selleck and Sage (12) reported the data given in Table III. 
They made experimental equilibrium measurements for the following three- 
phase equilibria: vapor, water-rich liquid and hydrate; water-rich 
liquid, hydrocarbon-rich liquid and hydrate; water-rich liquid, hydrocarbon 
liquid and vapor. The critical temperature of pure propylene is 196.S°F 
so that a liquid hydrocarbon layer can exist in this system at ordinary 
temperatures. The formation of this hydrocarbon liquid terminates the 
hydrate, water-rich liquid, vapor equilibrium at approximately 
91 lb/in. abs. and 34*5°F. The highest temperature at which hydrate 
can exist in this system appears to be approximately 35*5°F, which is 
the approximate limiting temperature for the hydrate, water-rich liquid 
and hydrocarbon-rich liquid equilibrium.

(3) Non-Equilibrium Behavior of Gas Hydrates 

Hammerschmidt (7) made the following significant observations 
regarding hydrate formation; 

if The formation of gas hydrates in natural gas pipe lines 
depends primarily upon the pressure, temperature and composition 
of the gas-water vapor mixture. After these primary conditions 
are fulfilled, the formation of the hydrate is accelerated by 
high velocities of the gas stream, pressure pulsations or 
innoculation with a small crystal of the hydrate.” 

Deaton and Frost (2) observed that hydrate may not form even 
though the pressure is 300 to 400 lb/in.^abs. above the decomposition 
temperature. They found that even violent agitation failed to initiate 
hydrate formation when the pressure was only slightly above the equili¬ 
brium value. 'They also observed, 

;f In making the hydrate tests it has been observed that although 
most of the hydrate decomposes readily when the pressure in the 
cell is reduced at constant temperature, a small, indefinite 
amount of hydrate persists for a considerable time, even after 
the pressure is reduced to atmospheric. This hydrate which 
fails to decompose is submerged in the water or covered by a 
water film. 51 

In general most workers have indicated that it is difficult to 
form hydrates even when well into the region for hydrate existence, 
and that the decomposition is by no means instantaneous when pressure 
is released. This behavior is not peculiar to hydrocarbon-water 
systems, but is characteristic of many phase changes and the general 
behavior of crystal formation.

(4) Composition of Hydrocarbon Hydrates 
(a.) Pure Hydrocarbon Hydrates 

The compositions of pure hydrocarbon hydrates have not been 
definitely established. Difficulty in completely isolating the solid 
hydrate phase from coexisting phases, so that its composition can be 
determined, is largely responsible for the uncertainty existing as to 
the number of molecules of water which react with a hydrocarbon gas to 
form hydrate. 


R f nHpC -—> R.nH 2 0 

where R is a hydrocarbon gas capable of forming a hydrate, with 
n molecules of water to every molecule of R. 

Hydrates tend to occlude water during their formation and this, 
along with any adsorption or solid solution effects, makes it difficult 
to determine n definitely. Experimentally determined values of n 
generally vary from six to eight (4,13)• 

Parent (12) states: 

T? It would appear likely that the hydrocarbon hydrates are 
isomorphous and that they should have the same ultimate 
structure. Villard held this view in 1888, and others since 
have believed it, but no one has clearly established the 
-composition of any one of the hydrates, or that they are all 
isomorphous ..... If isomorphism can be established, and if 
the composition of any one of the hydrates can be established 
beyond doubt, then the composition of all the hydrates will 
be known. ft 

However, it is also possible that hydrocarbon hydrates are mixtures of 
hexahydrates, heptahydrates, etc., or are of somewhat indefinite 
composition due to solid solution effects.

Several workers (6,7,14*5) have investigated thermodynamic 
methods for determining the hydrate composition. These methods are 
subject to a number of approximations but give values of n in the same 
range as those obtained by chemical methods. 

(b) Mixed Hydrocarbon Hydrates 

Katz and his co-workers based their development of the solid- 
vapor equilibrium ratio concept, for the prediction of hydrate forming 
conditions in natural gases, on the belief that the various hydrocarbon 
hydrates form solid solutions in each other. They obtained evidence 
with which to substantiate this belief. Carson and Katz (l) studied the 
four-phase, vapor, water-rich liquid, hydrocarbon-rich liquid and hydrate, 
equilibrium data for the methane-propane-water system and found that there 
was one degree of freedom; that is, their data fell on a single continuous 
curve on a pressure-temperature diagram. According to the phase rule 
the system comprised four phases since there were three components 
present. Since two liquid layers were visible, and a vapor phase 
existed, three phases were readily accounted for. This meant that the 
solids which were observed were all the same phase. It was concluded, 
then, that the single solid phase was likely to be a solid solution of 
methane hydrate and propane hydrate. 

Carson and Katz also measured the concentration of methane and 
propane in the hydrate and found that the composition changed contin¬ 
uously along the four-phase equilibrium line. This indicated that the

15 


single phase hydrate gradually changed in composition. Hammerschmidt (7) 

and Wilcox, Carson and Katz (23) noted that gas given off during the 

decomposition of natural gas hydrates had a gradually increasing density. 

"This behavior is characteristic of solid solutions and 
indicates that natural gas hydrates are likely to be solid 
solutions" (l). 

As previously mentioned Carson and Katz found no evidence to in¬ 
dicate that the pentanes and higher hydrocarbons enter into the solid 
solution. They found that the addition of propane to the methane-water 
system displaced the pressure-temperature curve for the hydrate in the 
direction of the curve for propane. However, the addition of either 
pentane or hexane did not alter the hydrate equilibrium for the methane- 
water system and these components behaved only as inert diluents. Deaton 
and Frost (3) showed that the addition of either iso- or normal butane 
shifted the hydrate equilibrium curve. Parent (12) suggests that if 
solid solutions are formed then the hydrates are probably isomorphous 

"since this is the normal requirement for extensive solubility 
of one solid substance in another." 

Thus, it seems probable that mixed hydrocarbon gases will form 
hydrates which are solid solutions in each other and that the pentanes 
and higher hydrocarbon gases will not be present in the hydrate 
crystal, except for that which may be present due to occlusion or 
adsorption effects. These hydrates may also be of the same ultimate 
structure. For example, they may all be heptahydrates.

III* THEORY 

(l) Phase Rule - General Considerations 

The phase rule states that if a heterogeneous system consisting 
of C components in P phases is in equilibrium then 

F = C - P + 2 

where F is the number of degrees of freedom, or the smallest number 

of independent variables that must be specified in order to define 

completely the remaining variables in the system. In using the phase 

rule as expressed by the above equation the only variables to be 

considered are temperature, pressure and composition. 

Conventional phase diagrams may be used to represent the phase 

relations in hydrocarbon-water systems. 'The following generalities 

help in constructing these diagrams (l6). 

”The addition of a component to a- system adds a degree of 
freedom to all features represented for the system. In other 
words, lines will generate surfaces and points will generate 
lines. These features will have one extra degree of freedom 
but will not be changed in designation. That is, a point 
representing vapor, solid and liquid in equilibrium for a one 
component system will generate a line in space on the addition 
of a second component, but this line will represent equilibrium 
between the same phases. Similarly, a line representing vapor- 
liquid. equilibrium will generate a surface which will 
represent a liquid saturated with vapor. Associated with each 
surface there must be another surface representing vapor 
saturated with a liquid.” 

Phase equilibria can be terminated in three ways: 

1. by addition of a phase, 

2. loss of a component, or 

3» by critical behavior where two phases become 
identical. 


















17 


(2) Two Component Phase Equilibria 

Single hydrocarbons in the presence of water form two component 
systems. The conditions at which three phases are in equilibrium in a 
two component system are represented by a three-phase line, since a two 
component system in three phases has only one degree of freedom. For 
a two component system in two phases, two degrees of freedom exist and 
are seen as areas on the phase diagram. These areas are defined by the 
three-phase equilibrium lines bounding the individual areas. 

Conventional pressure-temperature projections, such as Figure 2 
and Figure 3, may be used to represent the two possible types of phase 
diagrams that may exist for hydrocarbon-water systems. The type of 
diagram for each particular system depends mainly on the behavior of 
the pure hydrocarbon at different temperatures and pressures. The 
first type is represented by Figure 2 which is typical for systems 
where the pure hydrocarbon is above its critical point at the 
temperatures and pressures under consideration. Accordingly, only the 
hydrocarbon vapor can exist and there will be no region of two 
immiscible liquids. The systems methane-water and ethylene-water 
are of this type. 

The pressure-temperature projection in Figure 3 represents 
systems of the second type. In this case the hydrocarbon vapor is 
capable of condensation to a liquid phase and thus a hydrocarbon 
liquid shows up on the diagram. The systems ethane-water and propylene- 
water are of this type.

'Throughout this discussion the letter H denotes hydrate, I 
denotes ice, V denotes vapor, S denotes solid hydrocarbon, and L2 and 
Lq denote hydrocarbon-rich liquid and water-rich liquid respectively. 

In Figure 2, BF represents the three-phase equilibrium water-rich 
liquid, hydrate and vapor. This equilibrium is of special significance 
in that it represents the hydrate decomposition (or formation) curve for 
the hydrocarbon gas and water. Point B is approximately at 32°F and 
below this point ice will form. Hydrocarbons are generally only slightly 
soluble in water and thus cause no appreciable lowering of the freezing 
point. The freezing point line ABE Is practically vertical, since a 
variation in pressure has very little effect on the freezing point. It 
is seen that hydrate can exist to the left of CBF. Other phases present 
to the left of CBF depend upon the mole ratio of hydrocarbon gas to 
water. If the ratio is exactly that required for hydrate formation only 
hydrate will exist. If there is excess water present. Ice and hydrate 
will exist in the area above CB and to the left of BE, and hydrate and a 
liquid layer will exist above BF and to the right of BE. If excess 
hydrocarbon gas is present there will be hydrocarbon vapor and hydrate 
in the entire region above CBF. 

In Figure 3* BF again represents the three-phase equilibrium VLqH. 
As the pressure and temperature of the three phases are increased, point 
F is reached where a hydrocarbon-rich liquid is formed. At this point 
we have a quadruple point representing hydrocarbon-rich liquid, water-rich

liquid, vapor and solid hydrate existing in equilibrium at a single 
temperature and pressure. The conditions at which vapor, hydrocarbon- 
rich liquid and water-rich liquid exist in equilibrium are represented 
by FG. The line HFG can usually be approximated with the vapor pres¬ 
sure curve for the pure hydrocarbon as the presence of water affects 
it only slightly. HF represents the HLpV equilibrium which exists 
only if there is an excess of hydrocarbon-rich liquid. HF may also 
represent a metastable equilibrium for VL^L2* FI represents the 
HLqLp equilibrium. The effect of pressure on a condensed system 
is slight and thus the curve representing the HL^Lg equilibrium rises 
very steeply. It is seen that hydrate can exist to the left of 
C3FI. If the ratio of hydrocarbon and water corresponds to that 
required for hydrate formation, only the hydrate phase will exist in 
this region. If water is in excess, hydrate and liquid water will 
exist above BF, to the left of FI and to the right of BS, and hydrate 
and ice will exist above BC and to the left of BE. If excess hydro¬ 
carbon vapor is present, hydrate and hydrocarbon vapor will exist above 
CBF and below HF, and hydrocarbon liquid and hydrate will exist above 
HF and to the right of FI. 

A more complete picture of the two types of phase diagrams can 
be obtained from diagrams such as those illustrated in Figure 4 and 
Figure Here space curves, existing in three dimensional figures 
representing pressure, temperature and composition of the hydrocarbon- 
water systems, are projected on a pressure-temperature plane. These 
diagrams and the constant pressure sections to follow have been taken

from a report "Application of the Phase Rule to a Study of Natural Gas 
Hydrates" by Robinson (l6). Temperatures and pressures of important 
features are located approximately in their correct relative positions. 

No attempt has been made to keep a uniform scale because of the wide 
range of pressures covered and the limited solubility of the hydrocarbons 
in water. The phase diagrams of pure water and pure hydrocarbon in one 
component system appear on the boundary planes of the three dimensional 
figures. 

Point A is a quadruple point formed when the equilibrium, hydro¬ 
carbon solid, vapor and hydrocarbon-rich liquid, is terminated by the 
addition of a hydrate phase. The phase rule tells us that, if four 
phases are present, there must be at least four lines representing dif¬ 
ferent three-phase equilibria, all intersecting at a point in the 
pressure-temperature projection. 'Then, associated with the above quad¬ 
ruple point will be three other space curves representing equilibrium 
between 

1. Solid hydrocarbon, hydrate, vapor; 

2. Hydrate, hydrocarbon-rich liquid, vapor; and 

3. Hydrate, hydrocarbon-rich liquid, solid hydrocarbon. 

On the water side of the diagram similar features arise and the 

quadruple point B represents ice, hydrate, water-rich liquid and vapor 

in equilibrium. The associated three-phase equilibria intersecting to 

form this point must be as follows: 

.(i) Vapor, ice, hydrate; 

(ii) Vapor, hydrate, water-rich liquid; 

(iii) Ice, water-rich liquid, hydrate; and 

(iv) Vapor, ice and water-rich liquid.

For systems where the hydrate equilibria exist above the 
critical temperature of the pure hydrocarbon (Figure 4)* the termin¬ 
ation of the line representing hydrate, water-rich liquid and vapor 
is somewhat in doubt. Kobayashi and Katz (10) have determined this 
equilibrium, for the methane-water system, up to 11,200 lb/in.^abs. 
and 84°F. Robinson (l6) suggests that this equilibrium is termin¬ 
ated by a critical point where vapor and water-rich liquid become 
identical. If this is true, there will be a locus of points where 
vapor and water-rich liquid are identical, joining this critical with 
the critical for pure water. A similar situation arises where the 
hydrocarbon liquid and vapor become identical. 

For systems where the hydrate equilibria exist below the critical 
temperature of the pure hydrocarbon (Figure 5), a quadruple point exists 
at point F because the three-phase equilibrium, 1*2VH, intersects the 
LqVH equilibrium at some temperature and pressure before critical 
behavior has been reached. Hence, the three-phase equilibrium, 

LqVH, has been terminated by the addition of a phase, which is in 
this case 1 * 2 * 

■By drawing temperature-composition diagrams at constant pres¬ 
sures these systems may be described still more completely. Two 
typical diagrams are shown in Figure 6(a) and Figure 6(b). Each three- 
phase equilibrium line, cut by the plane of constant pressure, will 
appear on the temperature-composition diagram as an invariant temper¬ 
ature line drawn through three points; each point representing the 
fixed composition of a phase at that pressure and temperature.

The pressure of the system shown in Figure 6(a) is on Figure 4* 
The intersection of the constant pressure plane with the HVL-j_ equilibrium 
at point K (Figure 4) is shown on Figure 6(a) by the three-phase invar¬ 
iant temperature line JK. This is the highest three-phase temperature 
possible for this system at this pressure. The disappearance of the 
hydrocarbon-rich liquid at this pressure is indicated by the small 
enclosed area representing the hydrocarbon-rich liquid, vapor equilibrium. 
The area is closed because the constant pressure plane crosses the locus 
of critical points twice. 

Figure 6(b) is the temperature-composition diagram drawn for 
P2 (Figure 5)» This pressure plane passes through the quadruple 
point F. The four phases, hydrate, water-rich liquid, hydrocarbon-rich 
liquid and vapor are in equilibrium along the invariant temperature 
line HP shown on Figure 6(b). 

Lines of real practical significance on these diagrams are the 
invariant temperature lines JK and HP, above which hydrate will not 
form, and the dew point lines represented by MJR on Figure 6(a). A 
discussion of the significance of dew point lines is given in 
Section III (4)« These constant pressure, temperature-composition 
diagrams are also helpful in visualizing the three dimensional diagram, 
and illustrate the amount of information that can be obtained about a 
system from a pressure-temperature projection of space curves and 
application of phase rule principles.

(3) Three Component Phase Equilibria 

A two component gas with water comprises a three component 
system. Application of the phase rule tells us that a three component 
system in one phase has four degrees of freedom, therefore, in order to 
represent such a system in three space coordinates, it is necessary 
to specify one variable as constant for the whole diagram. The varia¬ 
tions in concentration of three component systems are conveniently 
represented in two dimensions by the use of triangular diagrams, which 
permit direct plotting of the two independent concentrations and the 
dependent concentration. These are constant temperature-constant 
pressure diagrams. A three dimensional model may then be constructed 
by representing temperature or pressure on a perpendicular to the 
plane of the triangular diagram. Thus, the complete isobaric or 
isothermic phase equilibrium model consists of a prism, the sides of which 
represent either the temperature-composition or the pressure-composition 
diagrams for each of the three binary systems. 

For the three component system two degrees of freedom will exist 
for three-phase equilibria. Therefore, assuming that all hydrates 
formed are solid solutions, the vapor, water-rich liquid and hydrate 
equilibrium will show two degrees of freedom and hydrate, existing in 
a system of fixed total composition, can be expected to melt over a 
range of temperatures for a particular constant pressure. Only if a 
four-phase equilibrium such as vapor, hydrocarbon-rich liquid, water-

FIG. 7 DEW POINT CURVES FOR METHANE - WATER (14)

(4) Significance of the Dew Point to the Formation o f Hydrates 

The prevention of gas hydrates formation can ordinarily be 
accomplished by dehydration of the gas. This dehydration must be 
carried out at least to the point where condensation of water is 
prevented when in regions of pressure and temperature where hydrate 
can form. It is thus of considerable importance to consider dew 
point equilibria. The dew point is defined as the pressure and 
temperature at which water will begin to condense. For example, 
above the dew point line MJB in Figure 6(a), mixed hydrocarbon and 
water vapor exist only. Below the dew point line,water-rich liquid 
will condense and hydrate can form once the temperature is equal to 
or below the temperature represented by JK. 

Figure 7 is a pressure-temperature projection of dew point 
curves for the methane-water system, along with the hydrate equilibria 
curves. Below the dew point lines on this figure, that is, at pre¬ 
sumes lower than the dew point pressures, methane and water will 
exist as a vapor. Above the dew point lines water-rich liquid will 
condense. It is seen that as the methane content of the system rises 
that the dew point curve is displaced toward higher pressures. An 
interesting case, which may be brought about by dehydration, is 
shown in Figure 7 where the 99*96 mole percent curve intersects the 
hydrate curve at A ? and B ? . For a system of this composition the 
parts’ of the equilibrium curves represented by 0B T , 0A T and CO lie 
within the vapor region and therefore do not exist. Therefore, there

is a region, lying between temperatures corresponding to A T and B T , 
respectively, where hydrate is formed directly from the vapor phase. 

For an operating pressure of P f , hydrate formation will begin at T T 
if a water-rich liquid phase is present. If dehydration is carried 
out until the composition is 99«98 mole percent methane, hydration 
will not begin until a temperature of T n is reached. 

Diagrams of this type are useful as guides for adjusting op¬ 
erating conditions when working with hydrate forming gases under 
pressure and for predicting the amount of dehydration that will be 
most economical in any particular situation. 

(5) Vapor-Solid Equilibrium Ratios 

The equilibrium ratio K is used as a practical means of cal¬ 
culating vapor-liquid equilibria for hydrocarbon mixtures when the 
vapor does not behave ideally. The vapor-liquid equilibrium ratio 
KL-V, Tor any component i, is defined as follows: 

= _zi 

y^_ Is equal to the mole fraction of component i in the vapor phase 
and is equal to the mole fraction of i in the liquid phase. 

Kj^_y is, in general, a function of pressure, temperature and the nature 
and composition of the solution. 

Wilcox, Carson and Katz (23,1) applied this equilibrium ratio 
concept to the vapor-solid equilibrium existing when solid hydrate 
forms in a multi-component gas-water system. They reasoned that if 
multi-component gas hydrates form solid solutions in each other then 

vapor-solid equilibrium should be somewhat analogous to vapor-liquid

equilibrium. Then, basing their calculations on the fact that experi¬ 
mental data indicate that mixed hydrocarbon hydrates are solid solutions, 
they prepared vapor-solid equilibrium ratios which have proven useful 
in predicting hydrate forming conditions in natural gases. They 
defined the vapor-solid equilibrium ratio as follows: 

%-S = y = mole fraction of hydrocarbon in vapor (dry basis) 

z mole fraction of hydrocarbon in hydrate (dry basis) 

Only the hydrocarbon portions of the vapor and solid phases are 
considered. These vapor-solid equilibrium ratios are used for computing 
hydration conditions in the same manner in which calculations are made 
for dew point, percent vaporization or bubble point for liquid-vapor 
systems. 

Carson and Katz first determined vapor-solid equilibrium ratios 
for methane. They are given in Figure 8. To calculate these ratios 
they required composition data for gases containing methane and gases 
resulting from the decomposition of hydrates in equilibrium with these 
gases. 'They were able to obtain one point at each pressure up to 
1,000 psia by using the hydrate composition data they collected when 
studying the four-phase equilibrium (VlqLgH) in the methane-propane-f^O 
system. They assumed that water had only a small effect on the vapor- 
liquid equilibrium for the propane-methane system and used,for the 
vapor compositions,the composition of vapor in equilibrium with liquid 
in the propane-methane system at the same temperatures and pressures 
that the hydrate equilibria existed. 'They obtained one point at

600 lb/in. abs. from data Hammerschmidt reported for the decomposition 
of hydrate formed from a natural gas. They also knew that K equals 
one for points on the hydrate formation curve for pure methane. They 

O 

then had three points for the 600 lb/in. abs. curve and so drew this 
curve first. Other curves were drawn in symmetrically and the range of 
pressures covered expanded by extrapolation. 

To find Ky_£ values for other gases it is not necessary to obtain 
hydrate composition data. If initial hydration points and vapor com¬ 
positions are available for a binary gas system containing methane, the 
relationship, 

51 z =Z—JL _ = 1 

%-S 

at hydrate forming conditions, may be used to calculate solid-vapor 
equilibrium ratios for the gas in the system with methane. The point 
at which hydrate initially forms corresponds to the dew point in vapor- 
liquid equilibrium. 

Katz et al. (l,10,11) have published solid-vapor equilibrium 
ratio charts for components of natural gas known to contribute to the 
composition of natural gas hydrates. These charts are for methane, 
ethane, propane, n-butane, carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide. A 
comparison (l) of predicted and experimental values for several natural 
gases has shown that these vapor-solid equilibrium ratios may be used 
to predict the pressure of hydrate formation for a given pressure 
with an error of generally not more than 10 %. Considering the various 
assumptions and extrapolations used to prepare these charts and the

IV. EXPERIMENTAL 
(l) Experimental Apparatus 

The system of experimental equipment used was similar to that 
used at the University of Alberta for other phase equilibria work. 

The principal unit of the apparatus was the equilibrium cell in which 
the systems were studied. The equilibrium cell was of the same type 
used for the above mentioned work and by Katz at the University of 
Michigan for his investigations of hydrate equilibria. 

Figure 9 is a schematic diagram illustrating the general 
assembly of the basic equipment. 

(a) Equilibrium Cell 

Investigation of the high pressure phase equilibria involved in 
a study of gas hydrates requires the use of an equilibrium cell that is 
built to withstand high pressures and yet will allow one to observe 
visually the phases present in a system as well as phase reactions 
between these phases. A cell having these requirements was adapted 
from a high pressure Jerguson liquid level gauge and is shown in 
Figure 10. The cell was a high pressure stainless steel chamber 
fitted with two sight glasses, through which conditions inside the 
cell could be readily observed. It was capable of withstanding 
2,000 lb/in.^abs. at 100°F and had a volume of approximately 120 ce. 

The equilibrium ceil was enclosed in a clear lucite jacket. 

The jacket consisted of a 6 inch O.D. lucite cylinder closed at both 
ends with machined lucite discs. 0-rings were used to obtain a tight 
seal between the discs and the cylinder. The use of 0-rings made it 
easy to remove the discs for dismantling purposes.

FIG* 10 EQUILIBRIUM CELL 































































39 


The jacketed equilibrium cell was mounted on a central axis 
made from two machined rods, each of which was coned at one end. These 
coned ends fitted into conical seats countersunk in the sides of the 
equilibrium cell. The other ends of the rods protruded through the 
sides of the ludte jacket and were fastened to a dexion frame. The 
weight of the cell was thus transferred to the dexion frame without any 
strain being put on the lucite jacket. The cell could be rotated 
about the central axis so that the contents of the cell could be 
thoroughly and easily agitated. A light was located behind the cell 
to illuminate the cell interior. 

(b) Measurement and Control of Phase Variables 
(i) Temperature: The temperature of the equilibrium cell and 
its contents was controlled by controlling the temperature of varsol, 
which was circulated from an auxiliary temperature bath through the 
jacket enclosing the cell. The varsol entered and left the jacket 
through openings machined in the rods used for the axial mounting. 

The auxiliary temperature bath was a small cork insulated tank 
filled with varsol. An immersion pump mounted in the tank continuously 
circulated the varsol. The evaporator coil from a Frigidaire refriger¬ 
ating unit was also mounted in the tank to facilitate cooling of the 
circulating liquid. A 500 -watt immersion heater connected in series 
with a variac was used for heating purposes. A Minneapolis-Honeywell 
(1 5 _90 °f) refrigeration temperature controller was used to maintain 
the system at the desired temperatures. The temperature of the bath

could be held constant within £0.8°F of any set temperature. This 
kept the temperature within the cell at a constant value within 
£0.1°F. 

The temperature within the cell was measured with an iron- 
constantan high-pressure thermocouple assembly which was mounted in 
the equilibrium cell. This assembly was purchased from the American 
Instrument Company. A mercury in glass thermometer (0-120°F) was mounted 
in the temperature bath surrounding the equilibrium cell for the obser¬ 
vation of approximate temperatures. A significant temperature lag 
existed between the outside and inside of the cell. Raising the 
temperature at the rate of 1°F every 5 minutes would give a lag of 
2°F. 

(ii) Pressure: Changes of pressure within the equilibrium cell 
were brought about by injecting mercury into the cell with a hand- 
operated Ruska mercury pump. The capacity of this pump was 100 cc. 
and additional mercury was added to the pump from a connecting reser¬ 
voir as it was needed. 

Two Bourdon-tube pressure gauges,manufactured by the Heise 
Gauge Company,were used for the measurement of pressure. 'The rating 
and serial numbers of these gauges were: 

(1) No. H 11718 R 0 - 1500 lb/in. 2 abs. 

(2) No. H 3272 R 0 - 5000 lb/in. 2 abs. 

These gauges were calibrated by comparison with a dead weight 
tester. Each indicated gauge pressure was corrected to absolute pres- 





41 


sure by an allowance for atmospheric pressure and for the head of 
mercury between the gauge and the point in the system at which the 
pressure was desired. 

(c) Assembly of Apparatus 

The apparatus was mounted on a dexion framework as shown in 
Figure 11. All valves, tubing and fittings were Superpressure equip¬ 
ment manufactured by the American Instrument Company, Inc. Valves 
used were of the 30,000 lb/in? series and tubing was made of 304 
stainless steel having 1/4 inch 0.D* and 3/32 inch ID and a pressure 
rating of 30,000 lb/in.^ at 100°F. All connections were union-type 
Superpressure connections specified by the American Instrument Company 
Inc. 

A vacuum pump was used to evacuate residual gases from the 
system and to provide a vacuum source for the sampling operation. 

(d) Materials Used 

The methane used had a purity of 99mole percent and was 
supplied by Phillips Petroleum Company. Gas chromatography tests 
detected a small amount of nitrogen present in the methane. The 
ethylene was obtained from the Matheson Company, Inc., and was 7? CP 
grade 71 , having a minimum purity of 99*5 mole percent. The propylene 
was obtained from Phillips and had a minimum purity of 99 mole percent 
Gas chromatographic analysis showed that there was less than 0.3 mole 
percent methane present in the propylene. No attempt was made to 
further purify these gases.

(2) Experimental Technique 

(a) Hydrate Formation 

The general procedure for forming hydrates was as follows: 

(i) The system was first evacuated to remove any residual gases, 

(ii) The- cell was then filled with mercury and approximately 4 cc 
of water was drawn into the cell via valve A, (Figure 9) by allowing the 
mercury to gravitate to the pump with valves E, D and F open. 

(iii) The desired gas was then introduced to the cell, through 
valve C, by utilizing the cylinder pressure of the gas. If two gases 
were introduced to the cell, the one with the lowest tank pressure was 
introduced first. 

(iv) The contents of the cell were then agitated to insure that 
the gases were uniformly mixed and that equilibrium existed between the 
vapor and liquid. 

(v) The desired pressure was obtained by increasing or decreas¬ 
ing the level of mercury in the cell by means of the mercury pump. 

(vi) The cell contents were then subcooled 5 to 15°F below the 
temperature at which hydrate formation was anticipated. 

(vii) Vigorous agitation of the cell then caused hydrate to form. 

(b) Hydrate Equilibria 

The hydrate equilibrium points desired are the pressures and 
temperatures where hydrate just begins to form when a gas of known 
composition is in the presence of liquid water. For a two component 
system in three phases there is one degree of freedom, thus the initial 










44 


decomposition temperature should be identical to the initial formation 
temperature at a given pressure. However, for a three component system 
in three phases, two degrees of freedom exist and the hydrate will melt 
over a range of temperatures at a given pressure. 

The technique for obtaining the pressures and temperatures where 
hydrates just begin to form for a two component gas in the presence of 
water was as follows. 

After hydrate was formed, the temperature was raised until the 
hydrate began to melt and the pressure began to rise. The temperature 
was then raised very slowly until all but a few small crystals of hydrate 
had melted. The temperature was then reduced a few tenths of a degree 
and a few small crystals would begin to form on the inside face of the 
glass windows of the cell. The temperature was then slowly increased 
again and the pressure and temperature were observed and recorded for 
the point where these crystals melted. This melting point was quite 
sharp and thought to be, at least, within 0.5°F of the final melting 
point. 

For the two component systems hydrate was formed and tempera¬ 
tures and their corresponding pressures were observed and recorded 
for points where the hydrate just began to melt. Some points were 
also obtained by using the final melting point technique described 
above. The same results were obtained by using either technique. 







45 


(c) Sampling and Analytical Procedure 

For the three component systems investigated, samples of 
the vapor phase were obtained and analyzed for each equilibrium 
point determined. Sampling of the gas phase was carried out under 
isobaric conditions by the addition of mercury to the cell at a 
rate just equal to the rate at which gas was removed. The vapor 
samples were collected in previously evacuated glass sample 
bottles. 

Equilibrium points, for a particular mixture, were first 
determined at a high pressure and then, after the vapor sample was 
removed, the next point was determined at a lower pressure. In 
this way up to five points, covering the pressure range 2,000 to 
100 lb/in. abs., could be determined for one particular mixture. 

The vapor samples were analyzed by using gas phase chroma¬ 
tography. A chromatographic column, packed with fl 3x fl adsorbent, 
supplied by the Burrell Corporation, was used for the analysis. 
Calibration curves, which were plots of peak height versus mole 
percent, were prepared for each of methane, ethylene and propylene. 
Chromatographic analysis proved to be a fast and accurate method 
for determining the composition of the vapor phase.

V. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 

(l) Experimental Phase Equilibrium Data for Binary Systems 

(a) Methane-Nater System 

The hydrate equilibria for the methane-water system have 
been well defined by a number of investigators. The main purpose 
of obtaining more equilibrium data in this work was to obtain a 
check on the experimental technique employed for determining the 
equilibrium pressures and temperatures for hydrate formation. 
Comparing the experimental data with data in the literature 
provided this check. 

The pressures and temperatures where hydrate just began to 
melt were determined for the hydrate, water-rich liquid and vapor 
equilibrium between 412 lb/in.^abs. and 33°F and 991 Ib/in.^abs. 
and 4B.5°F* The data are recorded in Table IV, in the Appendix, 
and are plotted on Figure 12, along with the published data 
presented in Table I. The experimental data agree quite well 
with those of previous investigators. The methane used by Deaton 
and Frost contained 0.3 percent carbon dioxide and the equilibrium 
pressures are slightly lower than those obtained in this work and 
by Villard. 

Two points were obtained for the hydrate, ice and vapor 
equilibrium and they agree with data of Deaton and Frost and 
Roberts et al. The technique used to obtain these two points was 
as follows: Hydrate was formed above 32°F and then the system was 
cooled until ice formed. The pressures and temperatures were

recorded at the instant that the hydrate just began to decompose 
upon heating. 

(b) Ethylene-Water System 

The vapor, water-rich liquid and hydrate equilibrium for the 
ethylene-water system was studied up to 1963 lb/in.^abs. The 
experimental data are recorded in Table V in the Appendix. The 
equilibrium pressures and temperatures are plotted on Figure 13 , 
along with the published data presented in Table II. Published 
data for this equilibrium exists up to &67 lb/in.^abs. The experi¬ 
mental data for pressures below 700 Ib/in.^abs. agree very well 
with those determined by Diepen and Scheffer. The equilibrium 
pressures published by Villard are a bit higher than those determined 
in this work and by Diepen and Scheffer. This is particularly 
noticeable at lower pressures. 

In this work, it was found that the slope of the pressure- 
temperature locus, representing the vapor, water-rich liquid and 
hydrate equilibrium, begins to increase very rapidly at approxi¬ 
mately 700 lb/in. 2 abs. and 62.9°F. This slope reaches a very high 
value and then begins to decrease again at approximately 1100 lb/in. abs. 
and 64-.9°F. The equilibrium temperature at 2000 Ib/in.^abs. is 68.3°F. 

(c) Propylene-Water System 

The vapor, water-rich liquid and hydrate equilibrium for the 
propylene-water system exists over a very narrow temperature range; 

32°F to 34«5°F. Several unsuccessful attempts were made to form

hydrate in this system. Cooling to 32°F and agitating for a period 
of several hours failed to produce a hydrate. When the system was 
subcooled to a temperature below 32°F, ice would form with the re¬ 
sult that hydrate formation could not be detected. However, several 
equilibrium pressures and temperatures were determined for the 
vapor, water-rich liquid and hydrocarbon-rich liquid equilibrium 
and these data are recorded in Table VI and plotted on Figure 14* 

The published data of Reamer, Selleck and Sage from. Table III are 
also plotted on Figure 14- The experimental points for the vapor, 
water-rich liquid and hydrocarbon-rich liquid equilibrium are seen 
to agree fairly well with the data of these authors. 

From Figure 14 it is seen that the vapor, water-rich liquid, 
hydrocarbon-rich liquid and hydrate quadruple point exists at 
approximately 34«5°F and 90 lb/in. abs. 

(2) Exrpermental Phase Equilibrium Data For Ternary Systems 

(a) Methane-Ethylene-Water System 

The pressures and temperatures where hydrate just begins to 
form were determined for mixtures of ethylene and methane at pres¬ 
sures up to 2000 lb/in.^abs. The experimental data are recorded 
in Table VII in the Appendix and are plotted on Figure 15« The 
vapor, water-rich liquid and hydrate equilibrium curves for the 
methane-water and ethylene-water systems are also shown on Figure 15•

The composition of the vapor phase, on a water-free basis, 
was determined at each equilibrium point. Curves were drawn through 
equilibrium points having approximately the same vapor composition 
and are shown for eight mixtures, ranging in composition from 2.8 
mole percent to 96.7 mole percent ethylene. 

Below 600 lb/in.^abs., the equilibrium curves all have approxi¬ 
mately the same slope and parallel the vapor, water-rich liquid and 
hydrate equilibrium curves for methane-water and ethylene-water. 

Above approximately 600 lb/in.^abs., the slop® of these curves begin 
to increase and this increase becomes more pronounced as the amount 
of ethylene in the gas increases. Below 730 lb/in. 2 abs., the 
equilibrium curves, for compositions greater than approximately 
70.0 mole percent ethylene, become indistinguishable from the 
curve for pure ethylene. 

As described previously, the slope of the 100 percent 
ethylene equilibrium curve becomes much greater at approximately 
700 Ib/in.^abs. The 65*8 mole percent curve parallels this 
curve up to 700 lb/in.^abs. and exhibits equilibrium pressures 
only 15 to 40 pounds higher but does not suddenly increase in 
slope. It continues as a smooth curve with a gradually increasing 
slope and crosses the 100 percent curve to give an equilibrium 
temperature of 71«4°F at 2000 lb/in.^abs. The equilibrium curves 
for 33*7 and 45*0 mole percent ethylene also cross the 100 percent 
curve. Hydrate equilibrium curves were determined for mixtures

containing 90.0 and 96.6 mole percent ethylene at pressures greater 
than 750 lb/in.^abs. Equilibrium pressures for these mixtures are 
lower than for 100 percent ethylene but are higher than those for 
the 65.8 percent mixture. 

The trend of the equilibrium curves in this region can be 
more clearly seen on Figure 16, which is a cross plot drawn from 
Figure 15 and shows constant equilibrium temperature curves on a 
pressure-composition diagram. For temperatures below 63°F the 
equilibrium pressure decreases uniformly as the mole percent of 
ethylene increases. At higher temperatures the pressure decreases 
uniformly until a composition of approximately 74 mole percent ethy¬ 
lene is reached. However, at higher compositions the curves reverse 
and the equilibrium pressure increases as the composition increases. 

The locus of temperatures and pressures, above which hydrate 
will not form, for mixtures of ethylene and methane,is defined by 
the curve representing the vapor, water-rich liquid and hydrate 
equilibrium in the ethylene-water system for pressures up to 700 
lb/in.'°abs. At higher pressures, it is approximately defined by 
a smooth extrapolation of this curve up to 950 Ib/in.^abs. and by 
the equilibrium curve for 65.8 mole percent ethylene from 950 to 
2000 lb/in.^abs. Only hydrocarbon vapor and water-rich liquid 
exist to the right of this tem.perature-pressure locus.

(b J Methane-Propylene-Water System 

The conditions of temperature and pressure at which mixtures 
of methane and propylene will begin to form hydrates in the presence 
of liquid water are given in Tables VIII and IX in the Appendix and 
are plotted on Figure 17. Figure 18 is a cross plot of the 
experimental data. 

For gaseous mixtures containing less than approximately 25 
mole percent propylene, continuous vapor, water-rich liquid and 
hydrate equilibrium curves exist which extend to pressures well 
above 2000 lb/in. abs. A number of equilibrium points were deter¬ 
mined for vapor compositions ranging from 0.5 to 23.9 mole percent 
propylene (water-free basis) for this equilibrium. Four curves have 
been drawn to indicate the initial hydrate forming conditions for 
methane-propylene mixtures of approximately 1.5, 3*0, 10.0 and 15*0 
mole percent propylene. These curves have the same characteristic 
slopes as similar curves for the methane-ethylene-water system. 

The addition of small amounts of propylene has a very pro¬ 
nounced effect on the vapor, water-rich liquid and hydrate equili¬ 
brium for the methane-water system. The addition of 1.4 mole percent 
propylene to methane lowers the equilibrium pressure 400 pounds at 
50°F. 

For mixtures containing greater than 25 mole percent propylene, 
any vapor, water-rich liquid and hydrate equilibria are terminated 
by the appearance of a new phase, hydrocarbon-rich liquid. A main

point of interest in this system is the appearance of the quadruple 
locus brought about by the presence of this hydrocarbon liquid. The 
addition of another component, methane, to the propylene-water 
system causes the quadruple point (HL]L2V) at 34*5°F and 90 lb/in.^abs. 
to gain a degree of freedom and move out into the three component 
diagram as a single line having one degree of freedom. Thus, as long 
as the three phases, vapor, hydrocarbon-rich liquid and water-rich 
liquid, are present, the conditions of temperature and pressure at 
which hydrate will form are fixed for any particular vapor composi¬ 
tion. 

Experimental data were taken to define this quadruple locus. 

Final melting points and initial melting points were determined 
and found to fall on the same curve. The composition of the vapor 
phase was determined at each final melting point. As one progresses 
to higher pressures along the quadruple locus the amount of hydrocarbon- 
rich liquid increases and the vapor phase becomes richer in methane. 
However, near 1000 lb/in.^abs. the mole percent of methane in the 
vapor reaches a maximum and begins to decrease. This maximum is shown 
on Figure 18 as 74*5 mole percent methane. Increasing the pressure 
above 1000 lb/in.^abs. consequently causes the amount of hydrocarbon- 
rich liquid phase to decrease. The highest point where four phases 
would exist in equilibrium was found to be 1370 lb/in.^abs. and 69*3°F, 
when the system was approximately 34*8 mole percent propylene on a 
water-free basis. At this point, critical phenomena were encountered

and the vapor and hydrocarbon-rich liquid phases appeared to form 
one phase, thus terminating the four-phase equilibrium. 

Initial hydration points were determined for mixtures con¬ 
taining 34•8, 36.2 and 47*0 mole percent propylene respectively, 
at pressures above 1370 lb/in.^abs. These three points lie on a curve 
that would result from a smooth extrapolation of the quadruple locus. 
The hydrocarbon phase for the 47»0 percent mixture was very dense 
and only a single hydrocarbon phase would exist above approximately 
1250 lb/in.^abs. at 70°F. Thus, for mixtures containing greater 
than approximately 45 mole percent propylene, the region of two 
hydrocarbon phases terminates below 1370 lb/in. abs. at the 
temperatures investigated. 

The quadruple locus and a smooth extrapolation of this 
locus appear to define the temperature-pressure boundary above 
which hydrate will not form in the methane-propylene-water system. 

(3) Hydrate Behavior 

The behavior of the hydrates formed in the systems studied 
was generally the same as that described by other investigators of 
hydrate equilibria. 

As discussed in Section II ( 3 ), it was found that at least 
5 to 15 degrees of supercooling and vigorous agitation were neces¬ 
sary to first form a hydrate in a particular system. Generally, a 
greater amount of supercooling was required at higher pressures. 

After melting the hydrate phase, sufficient seed crystals 
would usually remain in the system so that hydrate could be re-

formed by cooling the system to the equilibrium temperature and 
agitating. Supercooling would speed up the reformation of hydrate 
but was unnecessary. Seed crystals would remain in the system for 
an extended period of time, even when the system was left at a 
temperature and pressure considerably out of the region for hydrate 
formation. 

Once hydration was started in a system crystals would con¬ 
tinue to grow quite rapidly and, if the cell contents were not dis¬ 
turbed, the cell would fill up with elongated white crystals which 
would form on and extend out from the walls of the cell. Continuing 
agitation of the cell contents after hydration was started, would 
result in most of the water being converted to hydrate almost immed¬ 
iately. In this case the hydrate would form in a porous like mass 
somewhat resembling loosely packed ice crystals or snow. 

The melting of the hydrate could readily be observed. For 
the final melting point technique, the few crystals, formed on the 
walls of the cell, would suddenly melt and little droplets of water 
would remain. For the initial melting point technique, the point 
where the hydrate just began to melt could be detected by movements 
in some part of the hydrate mass. This movement occurred when the 
crystalline structure of the hydrate mass began to fall apart upon 
decomposition of the hydrate. The aqueous liquid from the decomposed 
hydrate could be seen trickling down through the hydrate structure. 

When heating a system containing hydrate up to the melting

point, the pressure of the system would slowly increase. The rate 
of pressure increase would generally increase sharply when the 
hydrate began to decompose. This provided another method for deter¬ 
mining the initial melting point. However, visual observation of 
the melting points proven to be just as accurate and less painstaking. 

(4) Critical Phenomena in CH/j-C qHA -HpO System 

The four-phase' equilibrium line, representing vapor, hydro¬ 
carbon-rich liquid, water-rich liquid and hydrate in equilibrium, 
was shown to exist to 1370 lb/in.^abs. and 69«3°F, when the system 
was 34»S percent propylene and 65.2 percent methane on a water-free 
basis. At this point interesting critical phenomena were encountered, 
with the result that the hydrocarbon-rich liquid and vapor became 
one homogeneous phase. Consequently, the four-phase equilibrium, 
VHLqL2, was terminated. As this point was approached, the surface 
of demarcation between the hydrocarbon liquid and vapor became fainter 
and flatter and the liquid phase became more fluid as the surface 
tension decreased. Finally, only one homogeneous hydrocarbon phase 
would remain. 

InEhen in this region, sudden decreases in pressure would cause 
a vigorous boiling action to occur and a finely dispersed white fog 
of varying intensities would form. This fog would sometimes remain 
for a short time before the single phase would become clear again. 
Lowering the pressure to 1370 lb/in.~abs. would result in two phases 
separating out. Agitation near this point would also cause a 


violent dDulIition action to occur.

When this system was cooled to lower temperatures, striking 
color phenomena occurred at approximately 1382 lb/in.^abs. At a 
pressure considerably above the region where two hydrocarbon-rich 
phases existed, the system was colorless. As the pressure was 
lowered toward this region, the single phase took on a color ranging 
from yellow to dark red. A further pressure drop of only 1 lb/in. 
would cause a phase separation. Opalescence existed over a range of 
temperatures and the color intensity depended upon the temperature. 
The color was fairly intense at 55.7°F and 1382 lb/in.^abs. but was 
even more intense at 49*3°F and 1382 lb/in.^abs. A maximum 
intensity of color would be expected to occur at the critical point, 
thus indicating, that the critical point for the hydrocarbon rich 
phases, in the 34«8 mole percent propylene mixture, existed at a 
temperature and pressure close to 49«3°F and 1382 lb/in/'abs. 

(5) Correlation of Experimental Data 

The desired correlation of the experimental data is a method 
of predicting the effect that propylene and ethylene will have on 
the hydrate forming conditions for a gas mixture containing either 
or both of these components. As described in Section III (5), 
vapor-solid equilibrium ratios have proven fairly successful for 
predicting conditions for hydrate formation in natural gases. 

From the experimental data obtained for the methane-propylene-water 
and methane-ethylene-water systems, it was possible to calculate 
vapor-solid equilibrium ratios for ethylene and propylene. That is.

the vapor phase analysis at hydrate equilibrium points in these 
systems and the vapor-solid equilibrium ratios for methane shown in 
Figure 8 were used, along with the relationship x y_ must equal 

%s 

unity at conditions of hydrate formation, to calculate vapor- 
solid equilibrium ratios for ethylene and propylene. Vapor phase 
compositions were taken from Figures 16 and 18, which were used to 
expand and extrapolate the experimental data. The calculated equi¬ 
librium ratios are given in Tables X and XI. Smoothed curves 
representing these equilibrium ratios are plotted on Figures 19 and 20. 

The constant pressure curves, for the solid-vapor equilibrium 
ratios for ethylene, have a gradually decreasing slope until a value 
for Ky 3 of approximately 0.8 is reached. The slope then increases 
quite sharply. This occurs because methane-ethylene mixtures containing 
greater than about 70 percent ethylene form hydrates at essentially 
the same conditions as for pure ethylene. The equilibrium ratios 
are equal to unity at the pressures and temperatures at which pure 
ethylene forms hydrate. The curves for pressures of 1000 lb/in.^abs. 
and higher, exhibit a temperature maximum above values of Kyg equal 
to 0.9 because of the nonuniformity of arrangement exhibited by the 

2 

constant composition equilibria curves in the region above 700 lb/in. abs. 
and 62.9°F (Figure 15)* The curves for pressures of 1500 lb/in.^abs. 
and higher have a much smaller slope than the other curves. This is 
mainly because the values of Kyg for methane are almost equal to unity 
at these pressures and have approximately the same value at different 
temperatures.

The solid-vapor equilibrium curves for ethane (l), which 
forms hydrate at nearly the same conditions as ethylene, have 
somewhat the same slope as the curves for ethylene. However, 
the value of the equilibrium ratio at any particular temperature and 
pressure is smaller than the value at the same temperature and 
pressure for ethylene. 

The constant pressure, solid-vapor equilibrium ratio curves 
for propylene, shown on Figure 20, have a gradually increasing slope 
and become very steep at values of Kyg greater than approximately 
0.3* The highest value of Kyg calculated at each pressure, is the 
value where four-phase equilibrium exists at this pressure. 

Curves for 1500 lb/in. abs. and higher pressures, again have differ¬ 
ent slopes than the other curves. 

Constant pressure equilibrium ratio curves for propane (l) 
exhibit slopes similar to those for propylene. This is to be 
expected, since a quadruple locus is also present in the methane- 
propane -water system. 

To use the equilibrium constants to calculate hydrate 

forming conditions for some temperature, pressures are assumed 

until_ 1 for all the components. 

K 

In order to evaluate the usefulness of the calculated vapor- 
solid equilibrium ratios, hydrate forming conditions were calculated 
for a gas mixture containing 64*8 mole percent methane, 31*7 mole 
percent ethylene and 3*5 mole percent propylene. These predicted 
conditions -were then compared with experimental equilibrium temper-

atures and pressures, which were determined for a mixture of the same 
composition. The comparison of the calculated and experimental 
hydrate forming conditions is shown on Figure 21 and given in Table XII 
in the Appendix. It is seen that the predicted equilibrium pressure 
at any given temperature is much lower than the experimental value. 

In fact, the predicted values are from 21 to 28 percent in error. 

(6) Phase Diagrams for the Methane-Propylene-irtfater System 

In general, the variations in concentration of three component 
systems are conveniently e^ressed by means of isobaric, isothermal 
triangular diagrams. Sufficient phase composition data were not 
obtained to be able to construct quantitative diagrams of this 
type for the methane-propylene-water system. However, sufficient 
information was available to draw, schematically, the temperature 
composition diagrams which make up the boundaries of constant pres¬ 
sure space figures for this system. These were drawn for pressures 

A . O 

of 450 lb/in. abs. and 1500 lb/in. abs. and are shown in Figures 
22 and 24. Using these figures as guides, schematic constant tem¬ 
perature sections have been drawn, which we thought to be represen¬ 
tative of the types of diagrams that could be drawn, if the necessary 
phas-e composition data were available. Although these diagrams are 
only schematic, they are an aide to a better understanding of the 
phase relations peculiar to this system. 

The pressures of 450 lb/in. 2 abs. and 1500 lb/in. 2 abs. have 
been selected for illustration in order to present the features which 
give rise to the four-phase equilibrium, VLqL2H, and the features

which cause this equilibrium to be terminated. A quadruple point 
exists at 450 lb/in. 2 abs. and 56.6°F. At 1500 lb/in. 2 abs. we are 
above the VL]_L2 region so that the four-phase equilibrium will not 
exist at this pressure. 

The boundary of the space figure for 450 lb/in.^abs. is shown 
in Figure 22 and for 1500 lb/in. 2 abs. in Figure 24. The temperatures 
of triple points for the methane-water system were obtained from 
Figure 13 and for the propylene-water system from Figure 14. Boiling 
points and freezing points for the pure substances are readily avail¬ 
able. Where temperatures of important features had not been deter¬ 
mined experimentally, they could be estimated with sufficient accuracy. 

The constant temperature sections dram at 450 lb/in. abs. 
are shown in Figure 23. The quadruple point is an equilibrium 
between and H and is at 56.6°F. Associated with this point 

will be four three-phase equilibria, VL]_L2> VLpH, HL^V and HL 2 L 1 . 

Since the three-phase equilibrium, I^LqV, is the only one starting 
at a higher temperature than the quadruple point, we know the four- 
phase equilibrium will be formed by one triangle coming down and 
three going away from the quadruple temperature. 

Figure 23(b) is typical of diagrams for this system at 450 lb/ 
in. abs., when the temperature is greater than 56.6°F but less than 
approximately 150°F. The I^LqV equilibrium is represented by a 
triangle having the phases mentioned at its vertices. Associated 
with this three-phase area there must be three two-phase regions 
and three one-phase regions. From the methane-water edge of the

figure, lines representing V in equilibrium with L-j_ and Lq in 
equilibrium with V will be generated. Similarly, from the propylene- 
water edge, lines representing L 2 in equilibrium with Lq and Lq in 
equilibrium with L 2 will be generated and lines representing V in 
equilibrium with L 2 and L 2 in equilibrium with V will be generated 
from the methane-propylene edge of the diagram. These lines will 
all be terminated by the addition of a phase. For example, the line 
representing L 2 in equilibrium with Lq — designated ^(Lq) — will 
be terminated by the appearance of V. Coming down from the propylene- 
water eutectic at approximately 15C°F there will be three space 
curves representing V in equilibrium with Lg and Lq — V(LgLq), 

L 2 (LiV) and Lq(VLg). These curves will pierce the constant temper¬ 
ature plane at points which will be vertices of the triangle repre¬ 
senting the three phase area LgLqV. Any point within this three- 
phase area represents the total composition of a system containing 
these three phases. The composition of the phases are given by the 
vertices of the triangle. 

At temperatures below 56.6°F but above 35®2°F we can expect 
to find three three-phase' areas representing I^VH, LqVH and HLqLq. 

These areas are shown on Figure 23 (d) along with the associated 
two-phase and one-phase regions. 

At 56.6°F, which is the quadruple temperature, we find the 
four three-phases areas, VLqH, VL]_L2, VLgH and HLqL2, combining into 
one four-phase area, which represents the VLqLgH equilibrium (Figure 23(c)). 
Each one of the four vertices in tnis four-phase area represents the 
fixed composition of one of the phases. 







75 


At 35«2°F, we are at the HL^L 2 equilibrium for the propylene- 
water system and, as shown on Figure 23 (e), this equilibrium does 
not exist below this temperature for the three component system. 
Similarly the HLV equilibrium does not exist below 34.8°F, which is 
the temperature for this equilibrium in the methane-water system. 

This is shown on Figure 23 (f). At 32°F ice will begin to form 
and an Lql equilibrium exists (Figure 23 (g)). Below about 31°F 
no Lq is present and an equilibrium between hydrate and ice exists 
(Figure 23 (h)). Figure 23 (a) is representative of diagrams for 
this system at temperatures approximately between 150 and l60°F, 
at 450 lb/in.^abs. 

2 

At 1500 lb/in. abs. we are above the critical locus and 
no hydrocarbon-rich liquid will form. The boundary of the three 
dimensional space figure at this pressure is shown in Figure 24 and 
constant temperature sections are shown in Figure 25. 

Above approximately 70.5°F, at this pressure, a hydrate 
phase is not present and only water-rich liquid and a hydrocarbon- 
rich phase will exist. This hydrocarbon phase is designated both 
by the symbol (L 2 ) and (V) to indicate that the density of the 
phase changes with composition. 

Below 70.5°F, a hydrate phase appears and H(V)lq and 
H(L 2 )lq equilibria are present. These three-phase areas are shown 
on Figure 25 (a) which is similar to Figure 23 (d) except that the 
VHL 2 and VL 2 equilibria do not exist. 'The H(V)L]_ equilibrium termin¬ 
ates at 54*7°F, which is the temperature for this equilibrium in the

methane-water system. Extrapolating the curve representing the 
L^HL 2 equilibrium for the propylene-water system, shows that it 
should exist at approximately 36°F at 1500 lb/in.'-abs. Thus, 
above 36°F and below 54»7°F, the constant temperature sections 
will be similar to Figure 25 (b). Below 36°F the H(L 2 )lq_ 
equilibrium no longer exists (Figure 25 (c)) and at approximately 
31°F ice will form (Figure 25 (d)).

VI, DISCUSSION 

(1) Validity of Experimental Data 

p 

Pressures were determined with an accuracy of £ 0.5 lb/in. 
with the 1500 pound gauge and of /5 lb/in. 2 with the 5000 pound 
gauge. It is thought that the temperatures were determined with 
an accuracy of ^G.1°F. The hydrate equilibrium temperatures are 
thought to be at least within /0.5°F of the actual equilibrium 
temperatures. 

It is believed that the use of chromatography provided an 
accurate method of analysis and that vapor compositions were 
determined with an uncertainty of not more than 0.5$. 

(2) Bthylene-Water System 

Experimental data for the ethylene-water system show that the 
pressure-temperature gradient, of the curve representing the vapor, 
water-rich liquid and hydrate equilibrium in this system, becomes 

r\ 

much greater at approximately 700 lb/in. abs. and 62.9°F. This 
phenomena occurs quite close to the vapor-liquid critical for pure 

p 

ethylene, which exists at 748 lb/in. abs. and 49«4°F* Thus, in this 
region, it is possible for a phase, which was initially a gas at 
lower temperatures, to be compressed to such a high density that 
the type of behavior associated with a liquid can be expected. In 
a system such as the ethane-water system, where the VL^H equilibrium 
exists below the vapor-liquid critical temperature, a hydrocarbon- 






ao 


rich liquid phase terminates the VL^H equilibrium and an IqLpH 
equilibrium is formed. The effect of pressure on the hydrate 
formation temperature for this equilibrium is much smaller than 
for the HLqV equilibrium and consequently the curve representing 
the new equilibrium rises very quickly. Thus, a likely explanation, 
for the increase in slope, of the curve representing the HL^V 
equilibrium in the ethylene-water system, is that the ethylene- 
rich phase assumes properties close to those of ethane liquid and 
the effect of pressure on the HL^V equilibrium is consequently 
similar to the effect on the HL]_L 2 equilibrium in the ethane-water 
system. 

p 

Villard studied this system up to 867 lb/in. abs. and noted 
that the HlqV equilibrium curve became steeper in this region. 

After extrapolating his data, he reported a critical decomposition 
temperature of 65«8 0 F, above which he felt hydrate would not form 
irrespective of the pressure of the system. An experimental 
investigation of the ethylene-water system up to 2000 lb/in. abs. 
has shown that Villard T s postulate is wrong and that the slope of 
the equilibrium curve begins to decrease at approximately 1100 lb/ 
ih.^abs. and that hydrate will form at 68.5°F at 2000 lb/in.^abs. 

(3) Ternary Systems 

The conditions of temperature and pressure, at which hydrates 

will just begin to form in methane-propylene and methane-ethylene 

2 

mixtures, have been defined up to 2000 lb/in. abs.

In the methane-ethylene-water system, a region exists above 
700 lb/in. 2 abs. and 62 . 90 F where the addition of methane to ethylene 
unexpectantly lowers the equilibrium pressure for hydrate formation. 

A quadruple locus is present in the methane-propylene-water 
system. The pressure and temperature at which this four-phase 
equilibrium terminates depends upon the composition of the system. 

It terminates when the conditions of temperature and pressure are 
such that the vapor phase and the hydrocarbon-rich liquid phase 
become one homogeneous phase. 

It is interesting to note that the conditions of temperature 
and pressure, above which hydrates will not form in either the 
methane-ethylene-water system or the methane-propylene-water system, 
are represented by practically the same curve. 

(4) Solid-Vapor Equilibrium Ratios 

Application of the solid-vapor equilibrium ratios to predicting 
hydrate forming conditions for a gas containing 64«S mole percent 
CH^, 31*8 mole percent Q 2 H/^ and 3*5 mole percent propylene, showed 
that the calculated equilibrium pressures deviated as much as 28 
percent from the actual values. This indicates that the equilibrium 
ratios can not be used with any great dependability. 

The calculated equilibrium pressures are very sensitive to the 
propylene concentration. In fact, the experimental hydrate forming 
conditions for the above mentioned mixture are essentially the same 
as for a methane-ethylene mixture containing 31*7 percent ethylene. 






82 


In a discussion, published with the paper (l) in which Katz 
presents the solid-vapor equilibrium ratios for paraffin hydro¬ 
carbons, Hammerschmidt gives experimental data for a rich gas 
containing approximately 40 percent methane, 18 percent ethane and 
30 percent propane, plus small amounts of other hydrocarbon gases. 

Using the equilibrium ratios published by Katz, he also calculated 
the hydrate forming conditions for this gas and found that the cal¬ 
culated equilibrium pressures were as much as 30 percent in error. 

He suggested that the equilibrium ratios be used with caution for 
rich gases. This discrepancy between predicted and experimental 
values could indicate that some error does exist in the values 
given for the equilibrium ratios for methane or perhaps it means 
that the solid phase does not behave ideally. 

The calculated equilibrium ratios are probably adequate 
for calculating hydrate forming conditions for gases rich in 
methane and containing only small amounts (less than 5 percent) 
of each of propylene and ethylene. 'This assumption is based on 
the fact that the equilibrium ratios developed by Katz work fairly 
well for natural gas mixtures which are very rich in methane and 
generally contain less than 5 percent of either ethane or propane. 

For mixtures of methane, ethylene and propylene, containing 
greater than approximately 20 percent propylene, hydrate equilibrium 
points will probably fall along a four-phase equilibrium line, which 
can probably be approximated by the four-phase locus for the propylene- 
methane -water system.

VII. FUTURE WORK 

Future work might include the following: 

(i) A study of the systems investigated in this work at 
pressures greater than 2000 lb/in.^abs. 

(ii) Determination of the compositions of some hydrates. The 
composition of the hydrocarbon portion of hydrates formed 
in the methane-ethylene-water and methane-propylene-water 
systems would be useful for checking the equilibrium ratios 
for methane. 

(iii) Determination of hydrate forming conditions for more 
mixtures containing ethylene and propylene. This data 
would be useful to further check the validity of the equi¬ 
librium ratios determined in this work.
