ABSTRACT 


PART I 

The half-wave potential of a number of anthraquinones 
have been measured. These indicate that the steric effect of the 
methylene group in methyl is much greater than the methylene group 
in trimethylene and tetramethylene. The greater stability of 
9,10-dimethyl-1’,2*,3*,4*-tetrahydro-1,2-benzanthracene as compared 
to that of 1,2,9,10-tetramethylanthracene confirms this. 





INTRODUCTION 


The steric effect of the methylene group has been measured 
by Arnold (1). Working principally with compounds containing the 
trimethylene and the tetramethylene group, he has shown that the 
tetramethylene group has a greater hindering effect than the trimethylene 
group and attributes this to the fact that the tetramethylene group 
has a larger angle at n a n than the trimethylene group, an effect first 
postulated by Mills and Nixon (2). 


tfv 



Arnold (1) has also determined the steric effect of the 
methylene group in methyl. He has shown that the space effect of 
the methyl, trimethylene, and tetrametorlene groups in the following 
compounds 



can be arranged in the following order 

CH^ tetramethylene trimethylene 

Other work on the space effect of the methylene group has been done 





















by Bachmann and Brockway (3), Grunert, Nicjiol and Sandin (4), and 

Christiansen and Sandin (5). These workers have measured the rate 

I ' 

of the dissociation of some pentaaryl ethanes. The following shows 
the compounds and their corresponding half life periods.

Considering the steric effect to be the determining effect in the half 
life, the space effect of the groups is as follows 
tet ram ethylene CH3 trimethylene 

The object of the present work was to gain some idea regarding 
the space effect of the methylene group in some 1,2-di- substituted 
anthraquinones, viz. 1,2-dimethylanthraquinone, 1,2-cyclopenteno- 
anthraquinone and 1',2 1 ,3 1 ,4 f -tetrahydro-1,2-benzanthraquinone. 

To determine the steric effect of the methylene group in 
the anthraquinone concerned, the oxidation-reduction potential of 
the quinone was determined. The greater the hindering effect the more 
difficult it is to reduce the quinone to the hydroquinone and therefore 
the lower will be the oxidation-reduction potential of the quinone. 

There should also be a relationship between the oxidation- 
reduction potential of the quinone and the stability of the corresponding 
9,10-dimethyl substituted hydrocarbon. For that reason the two 
hydrocarbons, 1,2,9,10-tetramethylanthracene and 9,10-dimetbyl-l l ,2 , ,3 , ,4* 
tetrahydro-1,2-benzanthracene were synthesized and their stabilities in 
air compared. 



























EXPERIMENTAL 


The first method used in determining the oxidation-reduction 
potential of the quinones was the potentiometric titration of the 
quinone with titanous chloride. The quinone studied was dissolved 
in 95$ ethyl alcohol, 0.5N with HC1, and was titrated with titanous 
chloride dissolved in the same solution as that in which the quinone 
was dissolved. The titanous chloride solution was kept under hydrogen 
in an apparatus described by Thornton and Chapman (6). The reaction 
mixture was kept under an atmosphere of oxygen-free nitrogen during 
the titration and a hydrogen electrode was used as the reference 
electrode. Using this method a value of E° for anthraquinone was 
obtained which checked with the value of other workers. On the other 
hand attempts to determine the oxidation-reduction potential of 

1,2-dimethyl anthraquinone failed. It is obvious now why this is so. 
The normal potential of the reaction 

Ti +++ + H 2 0 -* TiO ++ + 2 H + + e 

is -0.04 volts. From Table I it is seen that the normal potential 
for the reaction 1,2-dimethyl anthraquinone + 2H + + 2e “*■ 

1,2-dimethyl anthrahydroquinone is -0.47 volts. In other words 

1 ,2-dimethyl anthraquinone is a better reducing agent than titanous 
chloride. This was the first intimation of the very low oxidation- 
reduction potentials of the methyl anthraquinones. 

The next method used in the determination of the oxidation- 
reduction potentials was the determination of the half wave potential 
of the quinones polarographically. The automatic recorder used was 
a No. 42200-A1 Electro-chemograph manufactured by Leeds and Northrup. 
The cell used was of the usual construction, viz. a dropping mercury 
electrode as the negative electrode and a saturated calomel cell as

the positive and reference electrode, 

A stock solution, 50$ ethyl alcohol and 50$ water by volume 
and approximately 0.2N with respect to tetramethyl ammonium hydroxide, 
was used in all the determinations. The tetramethyl ammonium hydroxide 
acted both as a buffer and as the carrying electrolyte. A small 
amount of the quinone, whose half wave potential was to be measured, 
was put in the alcoholic mixture and the temperature of the mixture 
raised to 40°. The temperature was then allowed to drop to 25° and 
the resulting saturated solution was placed in the measuring cell. 
Nitrogen gas which had first been passed through a 0.5M solution of 
chromous chloride, a 1 M solution of sodium hydroxide, a O.IM solution 
of mercuric chloride, and the stock solution used to dissolve the 
quinones, was then passed through the quinone saturated solution for 
one-half hour. The height of the mercury column of the dropping 
mercury electrode was adjusted to give a drop time of one drop every 
four seconds. The determinations were carried out at a temperature 
of 25 - 0.1®G. No maxima were encountered in any of the determinations. 

All the quinones were prepared by a method analogous to 
that for l f ,2’,3 T ,4’”tetrahydro-l,2-benzanthraquinone given below. 

All were crystallized first from dilute acetic acid and then from 
acetone. Their melting points are as follows: 1,2-dimethylanthra- 

quinone 156-157°, eyclopentenoanthraquinone 127-128°, 
1-methylanthraquinone 172-173°, 1,4-dimethylanthraquinone 140.5-141.5°, 

l, 2,5,6-tetramethylanthraquinone 198-199°. The anthraquinone used 

was that of the Eastman Kodak Company and was crystallized from benzene, 

m. p. 286-287°.

2-Aminotetralin (7,8,9) 

To a solution of 45 g. of commercial «-naphthylamine in 
48 g. of boiling amyl alcohol was added 36 g. of sodium, a little 
at a time, ifter the reaction had ceased, water was added to the 
mixture. After shaking, the amyl alcohol layer was separated, acidified 
with hydrochloric acid and the amyl alcohol removed by steam distillation. 





































The residue was filtered and upon addition of concentrated hydrochloric 
acid the hydrochloric acid salt precipitated. This salt was steam 
distilled from a strong alkali solution and the free base obtained, 
fractionated in a fractionating column, boiled at 258-259°. 

cc-Bromotetralin (7,10) 

A paste consisting of 30 g. (1 mole) of amine, 100 ml. 

(2.5 moles) of hydrogen bromide (sp. gr. 1*3) and 50 ml. of water 
was diazotized at 0-5° with the required amount of sodium nitrite. 

This solution was then added slowly to a mixture of 8-12 g. of 
copper powder, 160 ml. of 48$ hydrogen bromide and the cuprous bromide 
from 61 g. of hydrated copper sulfate, 39 g. of potassium bromide, 
and 12.5 g. of sodium bisulfite. The mixture was slowly steam 
distilled and the oil obtained was washed in ether with alkali and 
distilled giving 28 g. (52$) of <*-bromotetralin, b.p. 236-240°G. 

2-(<x-Tetraloyl) -benzoic Acid 

The Grignard reagent from 15 g. of cc-bromo tetralin and 
2 g. of magnesium in 125 ml. of anhydrous ether was added slowly 
to a well stirred solution of 17.8 g. phthalic anhydride in 125 ml. 
of hot benzene. The mixture was refluxed on the water bath for one 
and one-half hours and after cooling, dilute hydrochloric acid was 
added until all the solid disappeared. The benzene-ether layer was 
separated and treated with dilute sodium bicarbonate solution. The 
water layer was separated and on acidifying a gummy material came down 
which solidified on standing. Recrystallization from dilute acetic 
acid gave 8 g. of material, m.p. 204-207°.

solution was poured over ice and the mixture heated to boiling. After 
filtering, the quinone was recrystallized first from dilute acetic 
acid and then from acetone (4 g.), m.p. 155-156°. 

The preparation of 1,2,9,10-tetramethylanthracene is similar 
to that of 9,10-dimethyl-l , ,2 l ,3‘,4 , -tetrahydroanthracene given below. 
The method used was that of Sandin, Kitchen and Fieser (ll).

magnesium and 2.0 ml. methyl iodide in 15 ml. of anhydrous ether 
was added 0.5 g. of l , ,2 , ,3 , ,4 , -tetrahydro-l,2-benzanthraquinone. 

The flask was stoppered, and after standing in the refrigerator for 
four days, the fluorescent solution was poured dropwise and with con¬ 
stant stirring (0°) into a solution of 5.7 ml. of 50$ HI and 4 ml. of 
HBr (Sp. Gr. 1.4) in 15 ml. of methanol. Glacial acetic acid (15 ml.) 
was then added. The iodo compound separated as an orange solid, 
yield 0.6 g. 

9,10-Dimethyl-l f .2 1 .3* .4* -tetrahydrobenzanthraeene 

A solution of 1.2 g. of the iodo compound in 45 ml. of 
dioxane was added to a solution of 7.5 g. stannous chloride in 40 ml. 
of dioxane and 12 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid. The solution 
was brought to its boiling point, diluted with 250 ml. water and 
immediately extracted with benzene. The highly fluorescent benzene 
extract was washed with water as quickly as possible and dried by 
filtering through ordinary filter paper. The benzene was evaporated 
under vacuum in a suction flask using a water bath. The brown S 3 >rupy 
material left was extracted with alcohol and the extract saturated 
with picric acid. On cooling the black crystalline picrate separated. 

One crystallization from ethyl alcohol gave 0.6 g. of the picrate, 
m.p. 153-154°.

DISCUSSION 


The values for E° in Table I were derived from the formula 
E° = El. + 0.0591 pH (12) 

where the pH indicated is that of the quinone solution used in the 
determination of Ei, It is apparent from the above equation that 
for two quinones in solutions of the same pH the difference in their 
half wave potentials, Ei., is the same as the difference in their normal 
potentials, E°. Since only a comparative and not an absolute idea 
of the hindering effect of a group is required, only comparative 
values for E° are necessary. Comparative values for El-, which are 
numerically the same since the pH 1 s of all the solutions were similar, 
can be used instead. Therefore, the lower the half-wave potential 
of a quinone the greater the hinderance to the reduction of that 
quinone. 

The values for E° are not considered exact and are included 
only for the purpose of comparing the above results with other deter¬ 
minations for which E°, but not Ei., is available. The reason for 
the error in the calculated values for E° is the error in the deter¬ 
mination of the pH. A pH meter, even using a special high pH electrode, 
does not give reliable results when measuring the pH of highly basic 
solutions such as were being used. The method used for the deter¬ 
mination of the pH was the determination of the total hydroxyl ion 
concentration of the stock solution by titration and the calculation 
of the pH from this value. Since the solution used was 50$ alcohol, 
it is apparent that the method is not too exact. 

It should be noted that the above value for E-J- for anthra- 
quinone corresponds favourably with that determined by Adkins and 
Cox (13) . Working under similar conditions, except for the concen-

tr&tion of the quinone, they obtained a value of -0.60 volts for 
E*. as compared to our value of -0.61 volts. 

It is seen from the results, the half wave potential of 
1 1 ,2 *,3',4 1 -tetrahydro-l,2-benzanthraquinone and cyclopentenoanthra- 
quinone being much less than that for 1,2-dimethylanthraquinone, 
that the steric influence of a methyl group is much greater than 
that of the methylene groups in the trimethylene and tetramethylene 
rings. This is what would be expected from a study of Fisher- 
Hirschfelder-Taylor models. In a ring the methylene groups are not 
free to rotate and thus occupy less space than the same group in 
the methyl compound whose methyl group has free rotation. This is 
indicated in the diagram which shows the extra space occupied due 
to rotation increasing the hinderance to the hydroxyl of the anthra- 
hydroquinone. 


hydroxyl group 



It is also seen from the results that the half-wave potentials 
for anthraquinone, l , ,2 , ,3*,4 , -tetrahydro-l,2-benzanthraquinone, and 
cyclopentenoanthraquinone are practically identical. This is not 
unreasonable for cyclopentenoanthraquinone since the atomic models 
show that the steric effect of the methylene group causing the hinder- 
ance Is about the same as that of the hydrogen atom occupying the same

place in anthraquinone. In the case of l , ,2 , ,3 l .,4 , -tetrahgrdro-l,2- 
benzanthraquinone it would be expected that the methylene group would 
have a greater hindering effect than indicated. A study of the models 
shows that in going from this anthraquinone to cyclopentenoanthra- 
quinone the methylene group next to the oxygen is pulled away from 
the oxygen, an effect mentioned earlier, which would indicate that 
1 *, 2',3 1 ,4'-tetrahydro-1,2-benzanthraquinone should have a higher 
negative half wave potential. A possible explanation might be the 
following. 

According to the Mills-Nixon effect the strainless form 
of a compound containing a tetramethylene ring attached to a benzene 
ring is one in which there is a double bond between the two rings 
and with a compound containing a trimethylene ring attached to a 
benzene ring the strainless form is one with a single bond between 
the two rings.

has one strained form out of two and cyclopentenoanthrahydroquinone 
has three strained forms out of four. Therefore, from the standpoint 
of Mills-Nixon strain, it is easier to reduce 1',2* ,3* ,4'-tetrahydro- 
1 ,2-benzanthraquinone than it is to reduce cyclopentenoanthraquinone. 
?/hether this is enough to counteract the greater steric effect of the 
tetramethylene group or whether another effect is present is hard 
to say, and therefore, no final conclusion can be reached. 

Another interesting point about the results is the fact 
that a quinone containing hindering groups at both ends of the mole¬ 
cule has a half wave potential not much greater than one containing 
only one hindering group. For instance a methyl group in the one 
position lowers the half wave potential 0.60 volts, from anthraquinone, 
-0.61, to 1-methylanthraquinone, -1.21; while the introduction of 
a second methyl group in the 4 position only lowers the potential 
0.08 volts. This effect is also seen with 1,2-dimethylanthraquinone 
and 1,2,5,6-tetramethylanthraquinone. Although some thought has been 
given to this no final conclusions on the cause of this effect have 
been reached. 

The slightly greater hindering power of the 1,2-dimethyl 
anthraquinone as compared to the 1-methyl can be explained as being 
due to the repulsion between the methyl groups which forces the 
1 -methyl closer to the carbonyl. 

In a paper by Iball (14) normal potentials of quinones 
closely related to some of the above are given. Using the method of 
potentiometric titration with titanous chloride the following values 


were determined

The most striking fact is that, unlike the effect of 
a methyl group in the work outlined above, here the methyl group 
seems to have no greater hindering effect than the tetramethylene 
group. Work done on dimethyl anthracenes, to be discussed below, 
definitely indicates that the normal potential for 1 , 2 -dimethyl-

anthraquinone should be less than that for 1*,2*,3 1 ,4'-tetrahydro- 
1,2-benzanthraquinone. Since the only difference between our quinones 
and those used by Iball is the 5,6 benzene ring there must be some 
effect, caused by this ring, which is at present not discemable.

Before discussing the results of the tests on the stability 
of 1,2,9,10-tetramtheylanthracene and 9,10-dimethyl-l , ,2’,3 , ,4'- 
tetrahydro-1,2-benzanthracene, the theory of this method will be 
discussed. 


The structure of a 9,10-dimethylanthracene can be shown in 
two ways, as a bi-radical with two free electrons (i), a form in which 
these compounds exist to a greater or lesser extent, and in the usual 
manner (II).

It is evident that the bi-radical structure of the dimethyl 
compound corresponds to the structure of the quinone while structure 
(II) corresponds to that of the hydroquinone. Since the oxidation- 
reduction potential of a quinone measures the ease of the change from 
a quinone to a hydroquinone (the lower the potential the harder it 
is for the change to take place) then there is a connection between 
this potential and the tendency of the dimethyl compound to form a 
bi-radical. That is, the lower the oxidation-reduction potential the 
harder it is to change the structure of the quinone, and the greater 
is the tendency for the dimethyl compound to exist in its quinone type 
structure, viz. as a bi-radical. 

Since oxygen is a bi-radical also, it would be expected to 
react with the bi-radical structure of the dimethyl compounds to 
form a peroxide.

The greater the tendency for a compound to exist as a 
bi-radical the faster it will react. Therefore, allowing 1,2,9,10- 
tetramethyl anthracene and 9,10-dimethyl-l,2-tetramethylene anthracene 
to stand in air and measuring their rate of reaction with the oxygen 
in the air will indicate their tendency to form bi-radicals, and any 
difference in this rate would indicate a difference in the oxidation- 
reduction potential of the respective quinones, viz. 1,2-dimethvlanthra- 
quinone and 1*,2’,3 1 ,4 ! -tetrahydro-l,2-benzanthraquinone. 

To follow the rate of oxidation a very simple procedure is 
used. The pure dimethyl compound is allowed to stand in air and 
melting points are taken at intervals. A change in the melting 
point indicates a change in the structure of the material. 

In connection with bi-radicals and quinones it is interesting 
to note the relationship between the oxidation-reduction of quinones 
and the biological activity of the related dimethyl compound.

As can be seen from the above list the dimethyl compound 
tends to be biologically inactive if the corresponding quinone has 
a high oxidation-reduction potential and active if the corresponding 
quinone has a relatively low oxidation-reduction potential. As 

explained earlier those dimethyl compounds whose corresponding quinone 







































- \ r> I" ' ' : 




' 

. 













has a low oxidation-reduction potential have a tendency to exist as 
bi-radicals. One theory of carcinogenic activity of polynuclear 
hydrocarbons (15) states that it is the bi-radical form of hydrocarbon 
which is the active form and that this bi-radical attacks the active 
centres of the nucleoprotein in the chromosome. Thus the lower the 
oxidation-reduction potential of a quinone the greater the tendency 
for the corresponding dimethyl compound to exist as a bi-radical and 
the treater the biological activity of this dimethyl compound. 

The results of the tests on the stability of 1,2,9,10- 
tetramethylanthracene and 9,10-dimethyl-l 1 ,2 1 ,3 1 ,4’-tetrahydro-1,2- 
benzanthracene (see Table II) show definitely that the former compound 
is less stable, and therefore, more likely to exist as a bi-radical than 
the latter. It would therefore be expected that the oxidation-reduction 
potential of 1,2-dimethylanthraquinone would be less than that for 
1*,2*,3*,4 ! -tetrahydro-l,2-benzanthraquinone. As noted before, this 
is actually so. 

That it was a reaction with oxygen that caused the change 
in the melting point is shown by the fact that the fresh tetramethyl 
compound did not react with potassium iodide-starch solution, while 
the compound when tested after being in contact with air for 7§r days 
gave a very definite test. Also when heating the tetramethyl anthracene, 
which had stood for a few days In air, in a melting point tube, 
bubbles of a gas appear at 109°C, and a very large bubble appears at 
114 c . The only logical explanation for this is that at this tem¬ 
perature the peroxide oxygen is given off. 

Another indication that the 1,2-dimethyl anthracene derivatives 
prefer the quinonoid structure is illustrated in the failure of early 
attempts to synthesize 1,2,9,10-tetramethyl anthracene. Badger,

Cook and Goulden (l6) synthesized compound I and tried, by shaking 
this with powdered sodium, to form the tetramethyl compound 



Although this works for other, less hindered, anthracene 
compounds, it did not work in this case. Also Fieser and Webber (17) 
tried to synthesize the tetramethyl compound by dehydrating II. 



This also failed. It is apparent now why these two methods 
failed. In each case the change is from a quinone type to an 
hydroquinone type structure and, as the oxidation-reduction potential 
of 1,2-dimethyl anthraquinone indicates there would be a strong 


resistance to this change.

ABSTRACT 


PART II 

Substitution of a fluorine in the !1 7 n position of 
2-acetylaminofiuorene increases the carcinogenic activity of 
this compound. The relationship between this and the theory 
of detoxification of carcinogens by hydroxylation is discussed. 





















INTRODUCTION 


Biological hydroxylation as an avenue for the elimination 
of carcinogens in a detoxified form has been recognized as a possibility 
ever since Boyland and Levi (l) and Chalmers and Peacock (2) noted the 
presence of phenolic derivatives of carcinogenic hydrocarbons in the 
excreta of rabbits, rats and mice. Over a number of years other 
workers have found evidence in favour of this theory. Berenblum and 
Schoental (3) found that the metabolite of 1,2-benzanthracene, a 
strong carcinogen, is 4-hydroxy-l,2-benzanthracene. Miller and Miller 
(4) have found that the two main metabolites of 4-dimethylaminoazo- 
benzene are 4-aminophenol and p-phenylenediamine. Their work and 
the work by Meuller and Miller (5) indicates that the metabolism 
consists of hydroxylation at the 4' position, demethylation and reduction 
to give the final products. Bielschowsky (6) has shown that rats 
receiving 2-acetylaminofluorene excrete 2-acetylamino-7-hydroxyfluorene 
in the urine. 

If the hydroxylated compounds are actually metabolism 
products of the carcinogens, then it would be expected that these 
hydroxy compounds would be less carcinogenic than the unsubstituted 
carcinogens since they would be eliminated by the animal faster and 
to a greater extent than the latter. That this is true has been shown 
by the work of Miller, Sapp and Miller (7) who have found that 
4 ! -hydroxy-4-dimethylaminoazobenzene has no carcinogenic activity 
and by Hoch-higeti (8) who has shown that 2-acetylamino-7-hydroxy- 
fluorene is much less carcinogenic then 2-acetylaminofluorene. 

Not only studies of metabolites of carcinogens but also 
studies of the degree of carcinogenic activity of substituted car-

The object of the study reported here was to find the 
effect that fluorine substitution at the 7 position in 2-acetylamino- 
fluorene and at the 4* position in 4-acetylaminobiphenyl has on the 
carcinogenic activity of these compounds.

EXPERIMENTAL 



4-Pluorobiph enyl (9) 

To a mixture of 125 ml* of concentrated hydrochloric acid, 

125 ml. of water and 85 g. of 4 aminobiphenyl at 0°Q war added 
43 g. of potassium nitrite. When diazotization was complete a solution 
of hydrogenfluoborate, from 30 g. of boric acid and 105 nil. of 48$ 
hydrofluoric acid, was added with vigorous stirring. Stirring was 
continued for one-half hour at 0°C. The filtered biphenyldiazonium- 
fluoborate was washed with 250 ml. of ice cold water, 250 ml. of cold 
commercial methyl alcohol and 15 ml. of ether, the precipitate being 
sucked as dry as possible after each washing. (102 g.) Decomposition 
temperature 116°. 

The salt was dried in the open air for four days and then 
placed in a one-litre florence flask with a tube leading to a 500 ml. 
distilling flask cooled with running water. The solid was heated 
gently until evolution of gas indicated that decomposition had begun. 
Then the reaction was allowed to proceed spontaneously; heat being

applied intermittently until the light yellow salt disappeared. The 
mixture was then steam distilled in an acid medium. The 4-fluoro- 
biphenyl which came over melted at 72-74° (64 g.). 

4 1 -Nitro-4-fluorobiphenyl 

Thirty-six grams of 4-fluorobiphenyl was dissolved in 100 ml. 
of glacial acetic acid and 80 ml. of concentrated nitric acid added 
to the mixture which was then heated at 100°C for one-half hour. The 
solution was allowed to stand overnight at room temperature during 
which time the product precipitated spontaneously. This product 
Yjas filtered and water was added to the mother liquor precipitating 
more of the product. The two batches were crystallized from alcohol 
(17 g.) m.p. 123-123.5°. 

4 ! -Amino-4-fluorobiphenyl 

A suspension of 22 g. 4 f -nitro-4-fluorobiphenyl, 500 ml. of 
alcohol, 70 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid and 70 g. of granulated 
tin was refluxed for 3 hours. The mixture was filtered and 300 ml. 
of the solvent distilled off. The concentrated solution was allowed 
to cool and the tin complex salts separated. The crystals were filtered, 
covered with 215 ml. of 3 N sulfuric acid, mechanically stirred and 
again filtered. The precipitate was returned to a beaker, suspended 
in 100 ml. of water and concentrated ammonium hydroxide added dropwise 
until the suspension was distinctly alkaline. Then 215 ml. of 3 N 
sulfuric acid was added slowly, the suspension stirred well, filtered, 
and the precipitate washed twice with 50 ml. of water. The free amine 
was liberated by suspending the sulfate in a mixture of 300 ml. of 
water and 30 ml. of concentrated ammonium hydroxide (13 g.), m.p. 119-120°.

glacial acetic acid. The temperature was raised to 50°C and 80 ml. 
of concentrated nitric acid was added with stirring over a fifteen 
minute period. The temperature of the mixture was slowly raised to 
60-65°. After five minutes the mixture was allowed to cool to room 
temperature. After two hours at this temperature the solid was collected 
on a Buchner, sucked dry, washed with two 25 ml. portions of glacial 
acetic acid containing 0.5 g. of potassium acetate, and then with 
water (60 g.) 155-156°. 

2-Aminofluorene (10) 

In a 3 litre florence flask 60 g. of 2-nitrofluroene (dry 
and powdered) was made into a thin paste with 2010 ml. of 78$ ethyl 
alcohol. A solution of 18 g. of calcium chloride in 30 ml. of water 
together with 600 g. of zinc dust was added to the suspension and 
mixed well. The mixture was then refluxed for two hours, the zinc 
dust filtered from the hot solution, and washed with .75 ml. of boiling 
78$ alcohol. The combined filtrates were then poured into three 
litres of water. The precipitate which formed was filtered and crys¬ 
tallized from 750 ml. of hot 50$ alcohol (42 g.), m.p. 127-128°. 

2-Fluorofluorene (11) 

A solution of 43.8 g. of 2-sminofluorene and 1,695 ml. of

The salt was decomposed, 10 g. at a time, on an oil bath, 
in a small florence flask fitted with a downward condenser. The salt 
was heated to 145° and after the violent reaction stopped the temperature 
of the mixture was held at 150° for twenty minutes. Then the hot 
contents of the flask were poured into a porcelain mortar, pulverized 
into a powder, and dissolved in ether. The solution was dried with 
sodium hydroxide pellets and after the ether had been evaporated off, 
the residue was vacuum distilled, b.p. 165° at 10 mm., (26 g.), 
m.p. 98-99°. 

2-Fluoro-7-nitrofiuorene 

A solution of 24 g. of 2-fluorofluorene in 102 ml. of 
glacial acetic acid was treated at 70° over a period of fifteen minutes 
with 22 ml. of concentrated nitric acid. To complete the reaction 
the mixture was allowed to stand twenty minutes at 70-80°. The yellow 
solid was filtered and washed with water (28 g.). Crystallized from

DISCUSSION 


If the elimination of carcinogens occurs through hydroxylation 
at a certain point in the carcinogen molecule^ then a compound containing 
a group, at this active point, which aids hydroxylation should be less 
carcinogenic than the parent compound since this substituted compound 
can be detoxified and eliminated faster. On the other hand substi¬ 
tution at the active point by a group which resists hydroxylation 
would produce a compound which should be more carcinogenic than the 
parent carcinogen since the detoxification of the substituted com¬ 
pound by the body is greatly hindered. 

One of the strongest known chemical linkage is the carbon- 
fluorine linkage in aromatic compounds, a linkage which is very re¬ 
sistant to hydrolysis. Therefore, a substitution of the hydrogen by 
fluorine at the active point of a carcinogen should increase its 
carcinogenic activity. Conversely, substitution at the active point 
of a carcinogen by a methyl, nitro or chloro group should lower the 
carcinogenic activity since these groups are more susceptible to 
hydroxylation than the hydrogen they replace, fork done by Miller, 

Sapp and Miller (7) confirms this. As noted before the position which 

is hydroxylated during the metabolism of 4-dimethylaminoazobenzene is 

the 4* position. The above 'workers found that the relative carcinogenicities 

of 4 1 - substituted derivatives of 4-dimethylaminoazobenzene is as 

follows (unsubstituted = 6): CK^ - 1, NOp - 0, Cl - 0, F - 10. 

This is what one would expect if the theory of detoxification 
by hydroxylation is true. 

It has been noted that it is the 7 position of 2-acetyl- 
aminofluorene which seems to be hydroxylated during its metabolism. 

Therefore, 2-acetylamino-7-fluorofluorene would be expected to show 

more carcinogenic activity than 2-acetyl aminofluorene due to resistance

to hydroxylation at the 7 position. Also, since the 4* position in 
4-acetylaminobiphenyl is analogous to the 7 position in 2-acetylamino~ 
fluorene, the former compound would be expected to hydroxylate at the 
4* position. Therefore 4-acetylamino-4*-fluorobiphenyl should show 
greater carcinogenic activity then 4”&cetylaminobiphenyl• 

Results which are available at present (12) shot/ that 
2-acetylamino-7-fluorofluorene has a much greater carcinogenic activity 
than 2-acetylaminofluorene which would seem to add further proof to 
the hydroxylation detoxification theory.
