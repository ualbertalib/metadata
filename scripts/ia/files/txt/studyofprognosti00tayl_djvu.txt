CHAPTSR I 


INTRODUCTION 

A leading took on measurement says: “Science holds 
prediction as its most iii 5 )ortant aim and prognosis is the 
ultimate aim of endeavor in the scientific study of education,'*^ 
Any prognosis, that is worthy of the name, must he huilt upon 
measures of indlvidueil ability and achievement, not upon 
personal opinion^ How then shall we predict high school 
achievement? For the practical school man the choice of the 
best basis of prediction narrows down to two possibilities, 

* general^ intelligence tests and previous academic record* 

Which basis is better? Unfortunately there is no general 
agreement as to the answer* 

Briefly stated, a satisfactory prediction meets three 
conditions, namely, validity, reliability and usability* The 
most inqportant of these is validity, for by validity is meant 
truthfulness. Insofar as the prediction is realized, it is 
considered valid* By reliability is meant consistency of 
prediction* The validity of a prediction is limited by its 
reliability, although high reliability in itself does not 
guarantee high validity* By usability is meant practicality* 
Are the predictions capable of being arrived at and used with 
sufficient ease to make them practical, or do they call for 
too great an expenditure of time and energy for the returns 
they yield? The extent to which they meet this test determines

their uaahility. 

When measured hy these three standards or criteria how 
do the bases of prediction, named above, compare in merit? As 
the previous records of the pupils are always available it is 
clear that such records excel the other basis in usability 
but the relative merits of the two in validity and reliability 
present a more troublesome problem as the literature of both 
is quite extensive* 

In this investigation it was impossible to deal with 
the whole problem as outlined above. Definite limits had 
to be set*

PURPOSE OF THE INVESTIGATION 

It is the purpose of this investigation to present 
data concerning the value of the Otis Self-Administering Tests 
of Mental Ability, Hi^er Examination: Foim A in predicting 
success or failure in the later years of high school. For 
the purpose of this investigation, the measure of a pupil’s 
success in a subject was determined by the marks obtained by 
that student on a departmental examination in the subject. 
School success is usually measured by means of ordinary marl® 
because they can be objectively Judged and recorded, and, 
barring accidents, they represent differences in the q.uality 
of school work. Several investigators^ have made studies of 
the value of scores yielded by different intelligence tests 
in predicting high school or college success. Usually the 
investigator gives his subjects several tests and is thus 
able to compre the predictive values of the various tests 
used. It was necessary to limit the present investigation to 
scores obtained on a,single intelligence test, 

A minor purpose of the investigation is to present 
data concerning the reliability of the measures used, namely, 
intelligence test scopes as yielded by the Otis S-A Tests

A second minor puipose of the investigation is to

depeirtmental examinations in the preceding units of a subject 
in predicting success or failure in the final unit of that 
subject* This latter data is given for only one subject 
(Algebra) and is for the purpose of comparison and check* 

Data on the reliability of Ti scores and marks will 
be presented first, the main thesis of the study will next 
be presented in some detail, and, finally, the data concerning 
the relative predictive value of academic record vs I<ii scores 
will be presented.

CHAPTJSR III 


RELIABILITY OF THE MEASURES USED 

Before proceeding with the main thesis of this report—to 
find the value of the I^i scores (obtained by Otis S-A Tests 
of Mental Ability: Higher A) in predicting high school 
success—it seemed desirable to present data on the 
reliability of the measures used throughout the investigation, 
as follows: 

Reliability of the Otis Higher A Scale 

(a) Reliability given by Otis ^^Ey reliability is meant 
the degree to which the scores of the test measure whatever 
the test measures* Reliability is best determined by means 
of the correlation between different forms of the seme test* 
Otis^gives the coefficients of correlation between Foots A 
and B of the Otis Self-Administoring Tests of Mental Ability 
as follows: 

Higher Examination, Grades 7 to 12: 

Group I, Form A first, 128 cases, r =*717 ± * 009 ) Aver* 

Group II,Foim B first, 125 cases, r zr *925 ± * 009 ) *921 

The values of the probable error of a score determined 
from these groups were 2*56 and 2*68 points for the Higher 
Examination. This means that the probable error of an IQ, 
is about 21 - points* 

(^) Reliability found by repeating the test* »In this 
study reliability of the Otis Higher A Test was measured by 


!• **Manual of Directions and Key (Revised) For Intermediate 
and Higher Examinations Otis Self-Administering Tests of 
Mental Ability.” p* 12.

finding the coefficient of correlation of the measures 
obtained by repeating the same test. This method was used 
because only Form A of the Otis Higher Examination had been 
given the subjects under consideration. 

The measures used in this test of reliability were 
obtained in the Gameau and Victoria High Schools. Ninety- 
seven pupils in Garneau High School grades X, XI and XII 
and one hundred and forty-one in Victoria High School 
grades IX, X, U and XII took the Otis Hi^er A test (Otis^^) 
in January 1932, and the same test (Otis^) in May 1932. 

This made a total of 238 pupils. The data obtained from 
this source ate given in Table I:

Table I is an excerpt from a Ruch and Stoddard Correlation 
sheet* The Pearson r representing the degree of relationship 
between the two paired series is positive 0 *79 t: 0*02. 'The 
two series of measures may be summarized as follows: The 
range in score values on the Otis^^ Test (January 1932) 
was from 8l to 129 with a meein score of 108*85 ^ standard 

deviation of 9 # 87 j on the OtiSg Test (May I932) from 87 to^ 

128 with a mean score of 112.98 and a standard deviation 
of 9 . 39 . 

One hundred and forty-six pupils had IQ scores higher 
on the second test than on the first* The score range of 
these increased scores extended from 1 to 30 points IQ with 
a median of .7*17 points IQ hi^er on the 0tiS2 Test than on 
OtiSj^, and a quartile deviation of 3*67 points IQ, Forty 
pupils had IQ scores lower on the second test than on the 
first* The score range of these decreased scores extended 
from 1 to 12 points IQ with a median of 3*30 points IQ lower 
on the OtiSg Test than on OtiSj^^ and a quartile deviation 
of 1,81 points IQ* Fifty-two pupils in the group of 238 
had the same IQ on both the Otis^ and the Otis2 Tests* In 
this investigation the trend in IQ shift is upward on the 
re-test. 

On the reliability of repeated tests Terman says, ”In 
general, the same tests give consistent results* Something 
depends, however, on the age and intelligence of the subject 
and on the time interval between the examinations*. He

found that, on the whole, older and superior children 

profited more from the e^cperience of a retest than 

younger and backward children did* He concluded, "While 
it would probably be desirable to have one or more 
additional scales for testing the same children at very 
brief intervals, the same scale may be used for repeated 
tests at intervals of a,year or more with kittle danger 
of serious inaccuracy* 

Truman L* Kelley attaches very little in^ortance to 

the reliability coefficient found by giving the same test 

twice at short intervals*^ He says, "The correlation 
coefficient so found is very misleading and, in general, 
higher numerically than the correct reliability coefficient* 
This is because there is a correlation between errors* 

The mental operation in the second test is not at all of 
the same sort as the operation in the first test* On 
the second the main feature is memory or a reinstating 
of what took place on the first, while on the first the 
question was a typical problem situation not involving 
these memory elements at all*’! 

Notwithstanding criticism of the only method of 
finding the reliability coefficient which could be used 
in this study, the writer decided to include in her 
report the results found by correlating two sets of 
measures obtained by the re-test method* It was thou^t 
that such results could be relied upon to a degree since 
at the time of taking the first test no pupil thought 
that he would ever again be asked to take an intelligence 
test* Under such conditions, it does not seem possible 
that the second test would merely be a reinstating of 
what took place on the first* If the tests had been given

at least one year apart, instead of four months, one could 
be reasonably certain that the ^carry over^ to the second 
test was negligible. 

At this point it is interesting to look into a study

Intercorrelation of the Otis with other Tests 

(a) Intercorrelation with the B,C, Survey ,^The coefficient 
of reliability shows the accuracy of the measurement but 
it does not tell us if what is measured is really 
intelligence. Some idea as to whether or not intelligence 
is really measured by intelligence tests, that is, if 
all the tests measure the same things, is obtained from the 
intercorrelations of various tests. As in finding the 
reliability coefficient, so in finding the intercorrelations 
with other tests^the supply of available material was 
limited, Otis Hi^er A scores were correlated with B,G, 

Survey Test scores. The measures used in this part of the

The Pearson r representing the degree of relationship 
between the two paired series is positive 0*84i0*03* The 
two series of measures may be summarized as follows; The 
range in I'4 score values on the Otis test was from 94 to 
127 with a mean score of 115«71 and a standard deviation of 
7o82; on the B«C* test from 88 to 122, with a mean score of 
108.81 and a standard deviation of 7.98# 

One pupil had an score higher by three points on 
the B.G. test than on the Otis. Fifty-seven pupils had IQ, 
scores lower on the B.G. than on the Otis. The score range 
of these decreased scores varied from 1 to 22 points 
with a median of 7.88 points lower on the B.G. than on 
the Otis, and a ^uartile deviation of 2.62 points IQ,. Only 
four pupils in the group of 62 made exactly the same Iw. on 
both the Otis and B.G. tests. In this investigation the 
trend in 14 shift is downward on the B.G. test. No information 
could be obtained on the reliability of the B.G. Test. It 
is a cou^aratively recent one. 

(b) Intercorrelation with other tests rep orted .-Of the 
intercorrelating of intelligence tests there seems to be no 
end. It appears that the Otis Higher Examination; Form A 
has been correlated against every other well-known test, 
both group and individual. Excerpts from two or three of 
these studies, as reported, will be given here; (1) J.A. Clement 
reports the interoorrelations of the Army, Otis, Thurstone, 
Pressey and Indiana group tests as follows;^

Otis A-B, r - .03 ave., N r. 50 schoolrooms (Colvin) 

with the correlations found in Clement’s report. He 

concludes that the wide variation leads one to doubt somewhat 

that the different tests—Anay, Otis,Thurstone, Pressey and 

Indiana—are really measuring the same elements in the 

pupil’s endowment.^ 

Another study (2!) is reported by W. S, Miller. He 
gave ten (10) intelligence tests to fifty-seven (5?)

freshmen entering the Univ. of Minn. High School in 1^22. 

From the data so obtained he made a study of the variation 
and significance of I^’s from group intelligence tests.

^ From Tables III and I\r it may be seen that although 
the spread in IQ is considerable (1-34) the intercorrelation 
between any two of the tests is never less than 70# It 
is a well-established fact that IQ^s yielded by some tests 
are consistently lower than those yielded by others. The 
student , under consideration, was given a lower M,A, on 
the Otis than on any other# The highest possible score 
for a 12-year-old on the Otis Higher A Examination is 75 
and the Binet Mental Age eq.uivalent of this score is 19-6# 
The corresponding IQ is 152# Assuming that the pupil»s 
performance on all the tests was eq^ually good, we may 
conclude that relatively speaking the IQ yielded by the 
Otis Higher A is low, or, at most, average# Of course, the 
fact that a test measures consistently low or consistently 
high does not alter the value of the coefficient of 
intercorrelation with another test# The average of the 
interoorrelations for four of the tests is. higher and 
for four lower than for the Otis, 

The Reliability of Examination Marks 
Marks are the universal measures of school work# 
Hmaerous and momentous problems in the operation of a 
school depend upon them. If we consider marks from a 
scientific viewpoint as a measuring scale, three fundamental 
questions arise: (l) How fine a scale of units may be used 
satisfactorily? (2) How reliable are the ratings made on 
the particular scale adopted? (3) How shall the marks be 





17 


distributed? Only the second problem need concern us in 
this study* Our problem is. How reliable are departmental 
examination marks? 

Dearborn, Finkelstein, and others have conducted 
investigations in order to show precisely the accuracy, 
or rather the inaccuracy, of marks. They each found that 
the marks assigned to the same paper by different teachers 
varied enomously and that the variability or unreliability 
of marks was as great in one subject as in another.^ In 
these experiments no attempt was made to control conditions 
under which the papers were marked. In each case the 
examiner was given a q^uestion paper and an answer paper and 
asked to evaluate the latter. 

In general, marks are unreliable because they suffer 

not only by a want of any common standard but also by a 

lack of agreement as to the basis of marking. 

a 

With reference to the lack of/^common standard of marking 
examination papers, we may say that althou^ Max Meyer and 
others have developed plans for overcoming this difficulty 
in school or university marks , no such plan has been devised 
for doing away with the variability of standards of teachers 
marking departmental examination papers. We may say then, 
that, roughly speaking, there are as many standards of 
marking as there are examiners and, perhaps, as many as there 
are papers marked. One writer on Educational Measurements 
assures us that an examiner sets a new standard every time

he marks a paper. If this he true, our measures are highly 
unreliable on this score. 

lYith reference to the basis of mar king,in our case 
something has been done to secure agreement. Groups of 
examiners who had made a study of the examination questions 
met, discussed, and agreed upon a basis of marking before 
marking emy papers, with the exception of three or four 
evaluated by each examiner for demonstration purposes. 

In case of unforeseen difficulties, requiring new rulings, 
the chairman of the group was the final court of appeal. 

He also re-read papers close to the dividing line between 
passing and failing, and a small percentage of papers 
marked by each member of his group. On the whole, it 
would seem that marks on departmental examinations are quite 
reliable, as marks go.

METHODS , SUBJECTS , MATERIALS 

The main thesis of this investigation was "based upon 
data obtained from files and records in the Edmonton Public 
School Board Offices, Twenty-four large sheets were 
required for the complete record. 

Methods 

For each student the following items were recorded: 
the number assigned to him by the investigator, name, 
score, and the various marks obtained by him on departmental 
examinations, June 1932# Although only Grade XII marks 
were used in this investigation, it was thou^t that the 
other marks might be used in a subsequent investigation, 
hence they were included# 

With this arrangement it was a simple matter to read 
off the score and the mark obtained on any subject for 

any pupil. For each of the thirteen (13) Grade XII 
examination subjects a list was made of the Ii*s and marks 
obtained by all pupils taking departmental examinations in 
that subject. The next step was to fjnd the coefficients of 
correlation between each of the paired series: M scores 
vs Marks (Lit, 4); scores vs Marks (Comp,4); etc, Ruch 
and Stoddard correlation sheets were used except for German 3 
where the number of students taking the examination was only 
eleven. From the intercorrelation values obtained the value 
of ISi scores (yielded by the Otis S-A Tests of Mental

Ability; Higher A) for predicting success in the various 
high school subjects was calculated. 

Sub jects 

The subjects serving throughout this investigation 
were selected from Grade XII students attending the 
fidmonton high schools (exclusive of the Separate high 
schools) during the school year I93I-32. The students 
considered ?rere those who took the Otis Self-Administering 
Tests of Mental Ability, Higher Examination: Form A 
in May 1932 and who wrote at least one departmental 
examination in a Grade XII subject in June I932. 

For the purpose of this investigation a Grade XII 
pupil was defined as one who wrote at least one examination 
on a Grade XII subject, June 1932; and a Grade XII subject 
was defined as one of the following: Literature 4, 
Composition 4, History of Snglish Literature 1, History 4, 
Algebra 3, Geometry 3, Trigonometry 1, Physics 2, 

Chemistry 2, Biology 1, Latin 3, French 3 and German 3. 

The list of Edmonton high school pupils writing 
Grade XII examinations, June 1932, contained seven hundred 
and eighty-three (783) names. Of this number twenty-nine 
(29) names were dropped for reasons as follows; In 
twenty-eight cases no IQ, rating was given, in the remaining 
case an rating of 78 was given, while the average mark 
obtained by this student on nine (9) Grade XII examinations 
was 68*2. On investigation it was found that the pupil

In q.u8Stion was subject to seizures and that in all 
probability the test came on one of her bad days. The writer 
felt justified in dropping this case. The number of oases 
considered was, therefore, seven hundred and fifty-four (754). 

Materials 

The materials used in this investigation were IQ scores 
and marks. The IQ scores were obtained in the intelligence 
test survey of the Sdmonton high schools in May 1932. The 
marks are those obtained by Grade XII students in the 
Edmonton high schools, June I 932 . This material is 
summarized in the next chapter.

subjects were arranged on twelve (12) Ruch and Stoddard 
correlation sheets^ the IQ along the X-axis and the marks 
along the Y-axis. The sheets contained IQ scores and marks 
for each of the following subjects: Literature 4, 

Composition 4, History of English Literature 1, History 4, 
Algebra 3, Geometry 3, Trigonometry 1, Chemistry 2, Physios 2, 
Biology 1, Latin 3 and French 3. For German 3, r was 
computed without tabulation of a correlation table. 

The paired series of measures arranged on the different 
sheets were correlated, values being computed for r, P.E.^, 
and My, and (X = IQ, y = Marks). Since correlation 
sheets were too large to be included tables containing a 
summary of the data were made from them and presented, as 
follows:

CHAPTER VI 


QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS OP THE DATA 
Correlation 

A correlation may bo thought of as the decimal fraction 
which tells us what proportion of the causes affecting the 
magnitude of the two variables is common to both variables* 

The results of the correlations, based on the data of 
Tables V—ZVII, are as follower; 

Table V. IQ vs Marks (Lit* 4) *^ Throe hundred and eighty- 
six (386) pupils wrote the Literature 4 examination. The 
Pearson r representing the degree of relationship between 
the two paired series of scores is positive 0*24^0.03. 

The two series of measurements may be summarized as follows; 

The range in IQ score values on the IQ testing (May 1932) 
was from 83 to 132 with a mean score of 114.25 and a 
standard deviation of 8.76; on the Literature 4 Marks (June 1932) 
from 20 to 95, with a mean score of 57.36 and a standard 
deviation of 13.08. 

Table VI. IQ vs Marks (Comp. 4) .-Three hundred and 
thirty-seven (337) pupils wrote the Composition 4 examination. 

The Pearson r representing the degree of relationship 
between the two paired series of scores is 0.30—0.03. The 
two series of measurements may be summarized as follows; The 
range in IQ score values on IQ testing (May 1932) was from 
84 to 132 with a mean score of 113.78 and a standard deviation 
of 8.85; on the Composition 4 Marks (June 1932) from 7 to 90, 
with a mean score of 55.17 and a standard deviation of 13.52.

himdred and five (105) pupils wrote the History of English 
Literature 1 examination. The Pearson r representing the 
degree of relationship between the two paired series of 
scores is positive 0.14^ 0.07. The two series of measure¬ 
ments may be summarized as follows: The range in IQ score 
values on the IQ testing (May 1932) was from 83 to 131 with

Prediction 

One of the chief puiTposes of correlation is for use as 
a measure of the degree to which one measure can he predicted 
from another. If we wish to find the predictive value of 
intelligence tests, we must have some measure of scholarship, 
with which to correlate the score. As a measure of relative 
success in this investigation we used the marks the students 
made in the final Grade XII examinations at the end of the 
school year. This measure of success is called the criterion. 
The value of the test is judged principally hy the degree to 
which it correlates with the criterion. 

One measure of the predictive values of scores is called 
the coefficient of alienation. The greater this coefficient 
is, the less is the predictive value. We represent the 
coefficient of alienation hy the letter k. If k = 1.00, 
there is no predictive value at all. If k=0, prediction is 
perfect, k may he calculated very simply from the coefficient 
of correlation, for k= Jl - r^. The percent of forecasting 
efficiency of the scores is 100 - k (where k is expressed 
as a percent). 

The method of finding the prognostic value of an 
Intelligence test, just explained, was used in this 
investigation. Tables XIX and XX, which follow immediately, 
are the result of applying Kelley’s formula for the coefficient 
of alienation (k = /l^- r^), and then deducting this 
alienation coefficient from 100%. This difference expressed 
as a percent represents the forecasting efficiency of the

A second method of finding the predictive value of scores 
is based on the observation that in a random distribution 
there is a regression or stopping back of the variable towards 
the general average# The lines representing this general 
tendency are called lines of regression# Their equations 
are given by Earl Pearson# By using those formulae we find 
the most probable .value of one variable corresponding to a 
given value of the other# 

Thus^, for a person whose IQ is 110 the most probable 

mark (y^^) will be found, as follows: 

^ ^ - x) + y 

. .24 (110 - 114.27)+6V.36 

8#76 

-= 56#8S. (1) 

By using the formula for the probable error of an 
estimated score, we find: 

P#E# ( 0 gt#scora)‘' •6745 J , jl - r^ 

. .6745 8,76 + 13.08 (. 24,2 

= 7#14. (2) 

Combining (1) and (2) we find the estimated mark in 
Lit# 4 for a pupil whose IQ is 110, as follows: 

Lit. “ 65#83^7#14. (3) 

This means that the chances are 1:1 that the mark of 
this pupil lies between 65#83't7#14 and 65#83 - 7#14; i#e#, 
between 62#97 and 48#69# 


## This calculation was based on data given in Table ETIII, p. 41# 














• 4 '. 


\ *

47 


Tlie chances are about 4:1 that the mark lies between 
56*83 i~2(7.14) and 55*83 - 2(7*14); i*e*, between 70*11 and 
41*55* 

The chances are about 20:1 that the score lies between 
55*83+-3(7*14) and 65*83 - 3(7*14); i.e*. between 77.25 and 
34*41* 

This method was used for computing the scores for each 
of the other Grade ZII subjects, for a student having the 
sane IQ (110)* The complete results are given In Table ZXI,

Conclusions 

If we make use of Table ZX in interpreting the results 
obtained by using Kelly’s formula for predictability (Table XIX), 
we see that since r is always less than 0*50, the forecasting 
efficiency of our highest measure is always lass than 13^, which 
is practically useless* Wood says, ”In the matter of predicting 
academic achievement, the intelligence test stands without a 
serious rival*The Otis S-A Test of ^^^^ental Ability: Higher A 
does not seem to have been particularly successful in predicting 
the academic achievement of Edmonton Grade XII students, as 
measured by the marks obtained by them on departmental 
examinations, June 1932* 

If we examine the results obtained by the second method 
of predictability (preceding page), we see that the magnitude 
of the probable error is from 7*01—9*90* This indicates the 
uncertainty of prediction based upon correlation values as 
low as those found in this study. 

Having found the value of the intelligence test, used 
in our investigation, to be very low in predicting achievement 
in the later years of high school, it seemed desirable to 
see how its predictive value compared with that of marks 
obtained on earlier departmental examinations in the same 
subject* The following chapter was, therefore, devoted to 
this study*

CHAPTER VII 

AN EXTENSION OF THE INVESTIGATION 

In judging the worth of a new instrument it is often 

more meaningful to compare its results with those of the 

old instruments which it is to displace or supplement than 

to learn how far short of prediction its results fall. The 

presentation of the data which follows is prompted hy the 

desire to define more clearly the efficiency of the 

intelligence test as a criterion for the prediction of 

achievement in the later yeairs of high school* 

In ccmqparing the predictive value of the Otis Higher A 

Tests with that of the traditional content examination, the 

con 5 )arisons here made are with Algebra 1 and Algebra 2 

departmental examination marks in predicting success in 

Algebra 5* **To predict success in a special subject one 

would use data that have something in common with the 

particular subject being predicted.l*^ Symonds warns us that 

”it is a mistake to assume that each subject predicts best 

that subject which has the same name. The work of Gowan 

2 

and Gooch shows the fallacy in such an assumption.” It 
was thou^t that the data of Algebra 1 and Algebra 2 would 
have more in common with that of Algebra 3 than any other

continuous throughout the high school course* 

f 

Methods, Subjects, Materials 
Me t hods * -Arme d with the list containing the names, 
I<^»s, and departmental examination marks for the 344 
Bdmonton high school pupils who wrote Algebra 3 in June, 1^32, 
the investigator visited some of the city high schools to seek 
in their records, files, etc. Algebra 1 and Algebra 2 marks 
for as many of the 344 as could be found* Before beginning 
this work it was necessary to decide which Algebra 1 and 
Algebra 2 marks she would look for* It was found that 
certain students had 2, 3 , or 4 different marks in each class 
which meant 1 , 2 , or 3 failures in the subject for these 
students. The first plan was to find the first mark(whether 
passing or failing) in Algebra 1 and Algebra 2 for each 
student. This plan was followed in about a dozen oases but 
the writer, knowing neither when the pupils entered the 
school nor where they came from, could not be certain whether 
the mark she had so diligently sought was the first, second 
or third* Accordingly this plan was given up and the method 
adopted of considering only those pupils on our list for 
whom a passing mark in both Algebra 1 and Algebra 2 could be 
found* The chief objection to this method was that the time 
factor was not considered* It was realized that one should 
not pool Algebra marks obtained after one, two,three or four 
years of study of the subject* Some system of weighting 
marks inversely as to the time factor should have been worked 
















52 


out and applied to the measures tut, unfortunately^the 
time could not "be definitely ascertained in meiny cases* 

However, since the investigator had decided to compare 
the predictive value of marks with that of I^»s, she chose 
what seemed the better of the two methods and proceeded 
with the investigation. For that matter, she did not know 
whether the 1^52 departmental examination marks in her 
possession represented first, second, third or fourth trials. 

In all probability, the Algebra 1 and Algebra 2 marks were 
just as reliable as the Algebra 3 marks. Accordingly, 
passing marks in Algebra 1 and Algebra 2 were entered on 
the list for as many of the 344 as could be found. 

Subjects .^The subjects serving in this minor investigation 
were 144 of the 344 who wrote the Algebra 3 departmental

Multiple Correlation^.-Table XZT shows that Algebra 2 


correlates with Algebra 3 to the extent of .46 and Algebra 1 
with Algebra 3 to the extent of .28. Our next problem is 
to determine whether the results of a test correlating .28 would 
add anything of value to the results of a test that correlated 
•46 with the criterion. Wo have a formula for finding the

correlation which it is possible to get between the combined 
score in the two tests and a criterion without actually 
combining the scores. This kind of correlation is called 
a multiple correlation. 

In order to find the correlation between the combined 
score in two tests and a criterion, it is necessary first 
to find the conflation between the tests themselves. In 
our case, for Algebra 1 vs Algebra 2, r is . 47 . We may 
then substitute the three correlations in a formula and 
find the coefficient of multiple correlation. 

The three coefficients of correlation may be represented 
as follows: 

Correlation between Criterion (Alg.3) and Test 1 (Alg. 2) 

« 1 ® ® • 

Correlation between Criterion (Alg. 3 ) and Test 2 (Alg. l) 

a s 0#28 

Correlation between Test 1 (Alg. 2) and Test 2 (Alg. l) 

Let us represent the highest correlation that is possible 
between a combined score in Tests 1 and 2 and the criterion 
by the symbol Bq ^ 3 ^ 2 * ^ben __ 

„ . 1/^01+^52-2^01- ^^02- ^12 

Ro.12 = U -2-

Substituting in this formula the values r^j^, and r^g 

given ab ove, we have ____ 

Ro.12 = i- (.28)^- 2 X .46 X .28 .47

r .47

This shows that by properly combining the scores in 
Tests 1 and 2, which correlate .46 and .28 respectively 
with the criterion, and .47 with each other, it would be 
possible to get a correlation of .47 between the combined 
score and the criterion. The combined score, therefore, 
would be a slightly better prediction of success in Algebra 3 
than either Algebra 2 or Algebra 1 alone. 

Prognosis .-Throughout this investigation our chief 
concern is with the predicrtive values of the correlations 
found. The measure of this value was found by means of 
the coefficient of alienation technique. Table XXVI^ls 
the result of applying Kelley’s foimula for the Coefficient 
of Alienation (k = JIl - ), and then deducting this 

alienation coefficient from 100^. This difference expressed 
as a per cent represents the prognostic value of the 
correlation coefficient. Table XXVlgives the efficiency 
of Algebra 1 Marks, of Algebra 2 Marks, also of the combined 
score of Algebra 1 and Algebra 2 Marks for forecasting 
Algebra 3 Marks, as follows:

Conclusions we make use of Table XX, p. 45 
in interpreting the results of this investigation, as 
found in Table XXVli we see that since r, in both cases, 
and is always less than 0 « 50 , the forecasting- 

efficiency is always less than 13 ^, which is practically 
useless. It should also be noted that the combined score 
of Algebra 1 and Algebra 2 Marks increased the predictability 
only 1% above that of Algebra 2 marks alone. We conclude, 
that when either rd or r^g very small, and r-^2 small, 
the value of will not greatly exceed that of the 

greater single correlation. In such cases it is useless 
to find the multiple correlation of the combined scores

COMPARISONS 

Many investigators have used Intelligence test scores 

1 2 

as bases for predicting success in high school and college. 
Several have used elementary school records as a basis of 
prediction for high school success,^ and high school records 

4 

as a basis for predicting college success. And some have 
used both intelligence tests and marks, and showed their 
relative values for predicting achievement in high school^ 
or college,^ 

Insofar as the writer was able to discover in the 
literature of educational measurements, very few investigators 
distinguished between the problem of predicting success for 
the hi^ school freshmen and that of predicting success

for the high school senior, Ross and Hooks made this

distinction tut limited their study to that of predicting 

success for the high school entrant, Ross has made an 

extensive study of the value of elementary school records 

for predicting high school success^ hut he only considers 

one or two years of senior high school. Ross and Hooks 

2 

refer to an investigation hy Brooks in which he compiled 
data showing that the achievement of pupils in the later 
years of high school in iinglish^ foreign languages, 
mathematics, social and natural sciences can he predicted 
better hy the marks received in the same subject during 
the previous year than hy a general intelligence test.. 

Comparison of Minor with Major Investigation 
At this point it is interesting to recall the results 
of our supplementary investigation—finding the 
predictive value of marks obtained in previous units of 
the same subject—and to compare the results with those 
of the major investigation—finding the value of IQ, 
scores for predicting achievement in the later years of 
high school. In our minor experiment we used three sets 
of marks. Algebra 1, Algebra 2 and Algebra 3 for 144 of 
the pupils who wrote Algebra 3 in June 1932. For 
Algebra 1 vs Algebra 2, r - 0.47 *0.04

In order to make our comparisons as valid as possible, 
a new correlation was worked out between and Algebra 3 
marks for the 144 subjects who served in the minor 
investigation* For the purpose of completing this comparison, 
the result of that correlation will be used here and 
Table XX7I with complete summary will be presented at the 
close of the comparison* The Pearson r representing the 
degree of relationship between the IQ Scores and Marks 
(Algebra 3 ) was 0*28 ^0*04. 

Comparing this result with those given above, we see 
that the coefficient of correlation between IQ Scores and 
Algebra 3 Marks is just equal to the coefficient of 
correlation between Algebra 1 and Algebra 3 Marks, is less 
than that between Algebra 2 and Algebra 3 Marks, and less 
than the coefficient of multiple correlation between 
(Algebra 1 + Algebra 2) and Algebra 3 . These results are in 
agreement with those of Brooks, namely, that the achieve¬ 
ment of pupils in the later years of high school in 
mathematics (Algebra) can be predicted better by the marks 
received in the same subject during the previous year than 
by a general intelligence test*

now be presented:

Table XX^TII, IQ ys Marks (Algebra 5) ♦-One hundred and 
forty-four (144) of the 344 pupils who wrote the Algebra 3 
examination (June 1932) were considered, these being the 
144 for whom passing marks in Algebra 1 and Algebra 2 were 
available* The Pearson r representing the degree of 
relationship between the two paired series of scores is 
positive 0*28—0*04* The two series of measurements may 
be summarized as follows: The range in IQ score values 
on the IQ testing (May 1932) was from 93 to 132 with a 
mean score of 116*54 and a standard deviation of 8.26; 
on the Algebra 3 Marks (June 1932) from 0 to 100 with a 
mean score of 61.66 and a standard deviation of 21.30. 

Comparisons with Other Investigations 

In order to find anything with which to compare the 
results of our investigation it was necessary to read 
reports of a large number of studies. It was found helpful 
to compare our results with the following excerpts, 
summaries, conclusions, etc., gleaned from other studies, 
more or less similar to our own: 

Symonds^ states that school success may be predicted by 
a general intelligence test such as may be administered 
in an ordinary school period to the degree represented 
by a coefficient of correlation of .48. Separate tests 
of elementary school subjects taken in combination are 
as satisfactory as a general intelligence test.

Jordan^ reports the following correlation with high 
school marks obtained by himself; Otis Group Intelligence 
Tests with High School Marks (composite) *450; with 
English *412; with Mathematics *281; with General Science 
.407; with History .340. 

The correlations given by both Symonds and Jordan are 
for IQ, vs Marks (Junior High School). All coefficients 
were less than . 50 , which means that as predictors of success 
in Junior High School achievement the intelligence test 
is practically useless. In general, the coefficient of 
correlation between I(Q and Marks (Senior Hi^ School) is 
lower than the corresponding correlation for Junior High 
School. 

P 

Flemming gives the correlation of marks in the Junior 
and Senior High School with Otis Self-Administering Test B 
as .52 and .32 respectively. In our experiment the average 
of r for 1^ vs Marks (Senior High School) was 0.27^0.04. 

Jordan gives the value of r for IQ, vs Marks in the 
following Junior High School subjects^as follows; with 
English .412; with Mathematics .281; with General Science .407; 
with History .340. In our study the values of r for 
vs Marks in the following Senior High School subjects were; 

Lit. 4-h Comp. 4, av. r-.27; Alg. 3 -f-Geom. 3 -t Trig. 1, av.r - . 27 ; 
Hist. 4, r = .20; Phys. 2tGhem. 2 + Biol. 1, av. r - . 37 . 

In general, our correlations are lower than those found between

M and Junior High School Marks. That is, our findings 
are in agreement with those of Flemming. It was ingpossihle 
in our investigation to find a correlation between and 
composite marks (Senior High School) because very few 
Grade XII pupils wrote exactly the same examinations in 
June 1932 . 

It was equally difficult to find any figures to compare 
with our correlations between Marks in a previous unit of 
Algebra and Marks in the final unit of Algebra. Miles, 

Kelley, Fretwell, and Ross^ found correlations between 
elementary school marks and marks in the first year of high 

school as follows: . 71 , * 789 , .49 and .64 respectively. 

2 

MacPhail made a summary of the studies which have correlated 
high school marks and college marks. An average of twenty- 
eight such coefficients is . 47 . This correlation is small 
compared with the correlation of .64 between elementary 
school marks and high school marks found by Ross. These 
figures concern the prediction of success in the hi ^-school 
or college course as a whole. 

In the prediction of success in separate courses Gowen 
and Gooch have made elaborate correlation studies of the 
relation of high school marks to college marks in the University 
of Maine They found that the correlation between H.S . 
and college marks in Algebra was .407 that H.S. marks in

Algebra predict Klementary French (College) better than 

they do Algebra (College). Whitman^ gives the average 

correlation between college Algebra and H. S. Algebra 

as . 43 . In our investigation we found for Algebra 1 

vs Algebra 2, r . . 47 , for Algebra 2 vs Algebra 3, r = .46 

and for Algebra 1 vs Algebra 3, r sr .28 and for IQ, vs 

Algebra 3 » r - . 28 . The first two correlations are in quite 

close agreement with the correlations given above for 

H. S. Algebra vs College Algebra. We would expect the 

correlation between successive units of H. S. Algebra 

to be higher than between H.S. and College, because of the 

highly specialized nature of the latter. Our results are 

2 

also in agreement with those of Brooks who found that 
marks in a subject are best predicted by marks in the same 
subject during the previous year. Our results showed the 
correlation between a general intelligence test and marks 
obtained in Algebra 3 to be .28. This result also agrees 
with that of Brooks. In regard to the whole matter of 
prognosis of ability in separate subjects Symonds says, 

"It is very complex and the factors concerned are subtle 
and little understood, so that perhaps premature 
generalizations should not be attempted.”^

Besides the above comparisons which are more or less 
statistical, excerpts from three other more or less similar, 
non-statlstical studies will be presented: 

MoCuen^ attempted to determine the relative value of 
a number of test scores in predicting success in Algebra. The 
study was made in the Palo Alto Union High School and the 
success in Algebra was measured by the Douglass Stanford 
Diagnostic Algebra Tests. In all 116 students were given the 
tests. The author found that the Group IQ, as deteimined by 
the Terman Group Test of Mental Ability is a better basis 
for grouping students in algebra according to probable 
success than any of the other criteria used in the study, 
which were the Revision of the Stanford Achievement Test 
and the sections on arithmetic computation and arithmetic 

reasoning of this test.

A study reported by C. H. Toll has especial interest 
for us here. For five of Amherst»s freshmen classes and 
for three classes followed throughout their entire college 
course scholastic grades were correlated with scores on 
at least one of the' following tests; Army Alpha, Otis S-A, 
Terman Group, Smith College Information, Amherst Test and 
three tests constructed in 1^24 by.the American Council on 
Education. Toll found that none of the tests was especially 
valuable for predicting scholastic standing, the correlations

ranging from -t- .19 to -h . 38 . Tha extremes of this range, 
interestingly enough, were found among the correlations 
for the Otis test, thus showing that the instrument varied 
in its predictive value from class to class. 

Kaulfers^ made a study of intelligence and Spanish 
failures. It was thought that the factors leading to 
failure in subjects other than Spanish would he about the 
same, accordingly, Kaulfers^ conclusions are given here. 

He found that pupils of relatively mediocre intelligence 
may succeed if possessed of the proper habits of volition 
and application; pupils of mental ability below I 05 IQ 
are at present bad risks in Spanish unless possessed of 
unusual interest in the subject and high capacity for 
effort and persistence. He concludes that the prediction 
of probable failure from the level of mental ability (as 
measured by the IQ) may hold in general for large numbers 
of students, but it is far too uncertain for purposes of 
individual prognosis and guidance. Other factors equally 
as important as mental ability condition failure in 
Spanish. An auxiliary basis, such as an index of 
industriousness or studiousness, must be used (collaterally) 
with measures of intelligence to insure even moderately 
trustworthy predictions of probable success, 

McCuen^s study would confirm our faith in the group 
intelligence test as an instrument for predicting probable

success in Algebra and other hlgh-school subjects, Toll*s 
study would tend to destroy our faith in the value of group 
tests, especially the Otis S^, for this purpose. In our 
investigation it was impossible to find out whether the 
instrument varied in its predictive value from class to 
class. Kaulfers reminds us that in the prediction of 
probable success^ intelligence is only one of the factors 
to be reckoned with. We must take into account such factors 
as interest in the subject, industriousness, persistence, etc. 

Conclusion 

These three studies suffice to illustrate the fact 
that there is neither general agreement as to the best means 
of predicting success in school or college nor as to the 
part intelligence, as measured by scores, plays in 
determining this success. 




CHAPTiilR IX 


STO'IARY, CONCLUSIONS,AND CRITICISMS 
Susnmary and Conclusions 

This investigation was undertaken to determine the 
value of the record in intelligence tests as a means of 
predicting success in the later years of high school. The 
fact that in our study scores in intelligence tests and 
departmental examination marks in Grade XII do not show 
closer agreement may he explained in several ways. In 
the first place, the students dealt with are a selected 
group from which the less able individuals have been for 
the most part eliminated by failure to pass preceding units 
in the various subjects. All but 47 of the 754 students 
given the Otis Higher A examination have K^^s above 100 
and most of the students have mental ages above seventeen. 
The level of intelligence in the case of practically every 
student is high enough to warrant adequate work in senior 
high school if interest, habit of work and the necessary 
preparation are also present. Factors other than 
intelligence play a large part in the student’s success. 

In the second place, very intelligent students have 
often not been trained to work to the limit of their 
capacity in the lower school. Their mental level has been 
high enough to enable them to do fairly satisfactory work 
with a minimum of effort. These students enter high

school with inadaq^uate preparation and with the habit of 
working only enough to ’’get through.” If this habit 
persists through all four years of high school it may lead 
to a very intelligent student’s receiving poor marks. 

In the third place, some of the most intelligent 
students are not interested primarily in high school work, 
and unless pride in academic success is sufficient to make 
these students put forth a determined effort to obtain 
high grades most of their energy may find its outlet in 
extra curriculum activities* 

Lastly, the low correlations between and achievement 
suggest that the validity of the test as a test which will 
differentiate between mental levels in pupils I 7 or over 
may not be as great as could be desired. Our problem in 
the later years of high school is for the most part that 
of differentiating between abilities at the top of the 
scale, a far more difficult one than that of separating 
into groups the whole range of mental ability* 

With an average prediction no higher than that obtained 
here it must be concluded that intelligence tests are 
neither a very truthful nor a very consistent basis for 
predicting average achievement for senior high school. The 
result of our tests showed (1) that marks correlated more 
highly with achievement than IQ, scores did, (2) that the 
Intelligence Tests could not with fairness be used to 
exclude students who had passed the preceding units of the

subject, (3) that the I^»s selected the students whose work 
proved poorest, better than did marks on previous 
examinations. 

The work of C.C. Ross and others has demonstrated that 
the entire grade school career of a pupil predicts high- 
school career far better and more consistently than any 
intelligence test, and at no expense other than a few minutes 
of work on the adding machine—a smaller amount of labor than 
is rev^uired to score a mental test. Several investigations 
have found secondary school marks the best basis of 
prediction for the first two years of university. Brooks 
has found the marks of the preceding year the best predictors 
of achievement in the later years of high school. 

If these findings are correct, naturally we ask why 
intelligence tests are used at all to predict educational 
achievement. Before condemning intelligence tests it seems 
only fair to remember the criterion with reference to which 
they are judged practically useless as predictors of success. 
This criterion is invariably marks, usually final examination 
marks. This briiBS us back to the reliability of marks. In 
this connection, Huffaker^ says, ”If the criteria of scholastic 
success were as reliable as the present psychological tests it 
is probable that prediction would be satisfactory in three

The correlation between a test proposed as one having 
prognostic value and later demonstrated degrees of success or 
failure constitutes the final measure of whether the test 
is actually valid for the purpose claimed, ^here success or 
failure is measured solely by academic marks, the prognostic 
value of intelligence tests is practically worthless. Group 
tests are chiefly useful for purposes of rough classification 
and for very rough prediction but either should be undertaken 
only after inquiry into various factors such as. Has the 
pupil taken tests before? Did the subject lose any time for 
any reason during the test? What has been the subject's 
training in school subjects? One of the greatest advantages 
of the intelligence test is that it enables the administration 
to adjust academic load to individual capacity so much more 
precisely than heretofore that many mediocre students, who 
would otherwise have dropped out of hi^ school or college, 
are saved from failure, and thus are allowed to go on through 
college with as much speed and progress as their intelligence 
allows. 

In conclusion, we would say that school marks should 
not be relied upon alone for prognosis but should be 
supplemented by intelligence tests. All the studies that 
have tried out both criteria find that they tell more together 
than either one does alone* 

Criticisms and Suggestions

measures used throughout the investigation was discussed in

some detail. The writar, however, feels that one or two 
suggestions from a paper by Gates^ should he included here. 

This study presents data which show that at least under 
certain conditions, quite ridiculous I^^ts may he derived 
from certain group tests. Gates gives an example of a 
fairly bright hoy in Grade VII who earned a mental age of 
46 years on one test giving an I^ of 408• Sir Francis Galton, 
whose IQ, was estimated by Terman to he only about 200, would 
look pitiful beside this Myers prodigy. Gates urges a 
restraint of certain inappropriate uses of group tests. 

In conclusion Gates says, ”We should not compute M.A,»s 
and 14^3 from raw scores, but these raw scores themselves 
may be put to profitable use.” The data presented by 
Gates should be sufficient to make one very cautious in the 
interpretation of group test scores and particularly cautious 
in the use of the M.A. or IQ,. Gates says the factor of 

greatest iii 5 )ortance is practice in group tests.

Symonds points out three factors that make a test 
more reliable; ’’increased length; narrower range of 
difficulty of the items; more objective scoring.” Anyone 
who has given group intelligence tests realizes the sound¬ 
ness of this observation. The imperative need is for longer 
tests, probably of two or three hours. There is a direct 
ratio between length of test and size of validity.

on Group Tests of General Mental Ability,” J. App . Psych.

The Otis S-A Test of Mental Ahlllty Imposes a time 
limit* This means that there is the ever present group of 
individuals who will he penalized hy this limit* Their 
M*A*»s and will he lower than they would he on a test 

where speed is not a factor* 

Cattell^ found that nine well-known intelligence tests 
tended to rate similarly children of average brightness, 
hut gave widely divergent results for children whose I^»s 
fall at the extremes of the range* The Higher Otis S-A was 
especially criticized on this score. 

The following paragraph from a study hy George Tozer^ 
gives us seme idea of the factors influencing the thing we 
are trying to predict hy a 30-minute group intelligence test; 

’•Many factors seem to enter into the school success of 
students* Sears mentions general mentality, special abilities, 
interests, physique, social and moral capacity, native 
language, home conditions, race traditions, home occupation, 
and social and economic status of the family. Proctor adds 
previous training, kind of teaching, health, character, 
vocational ambition and personal disposition. Vi teles includes 
appearance, experience and temperament*** 

In conclusion, we would say. that since the non-intellectual 
influences so greatly outnumber, and very probably outweigh, 
the intellectual factors leading to school success it is not 
surprising to find that our instruraent, which is supposed to 
measure only native intelligence, is practically useless for 
prognostic purposes.
