INTRODUCTION 


The desire of the concrete industry in general to obtain as dense 
a concrete mixture as possible because of the resulting high strengths and 
imperviousness, which in turn made the concrete more durable, delayed the 
use of air-entrained concrete mixtures. Sven when the beneficial effects 
of entrained air on resistance to freezing and thawing were recognized, the 
accompanying reductions in density and possible losses in strength were 
deemed sufficient reason to discontinue work on the subject. In recent 
years, interest in the possibility of increasing concrete durability by 
means of air entrainment has been revived largely because of the scaling 
effects of CaC^ used to remove ice from pavement surfaces. Structural 
concrete, unlike highway concrete, is seldom if ever exposed to the dis¬ 
integrating effect of CaCl^. It is, however, very frequently exposed to 
alternate cycles of freezing and thawing in the presence of excess moisture. 
It is important therefore to be able to distinguish between durability as 
measured by freezing and thawing in the presence of chlorides and dur¬ 
ability as measured by freezing and thawing in plain water. 

The effect of entrained air on resistance to freezing and thawing 
seems to be independant of the means employed to entrain the added air. 

One of many different air entraining agents including fatty acids, wetting 
agents, oils, resins, and chemical compounds can be used. The beneficial 
effect of the air entrained by such agents on resistance to freezing and 
thawing of concrete is general, but the changes in strength and density of 
concretes do vary considerably with the type and amount of agent used. 

Proper dispersion of the air is required for it to be beneficial. It is 
generally accepted that the minimum additional air required to increase 
materially the resistance to freezing and thawing is 3 percent of the vol¬ 
ume of the concrete. The entrainment of more air gives additional

increases in resistance, but this added improvement is of doubtful value 
because of the resulting lower densities and possible losses in strength. 

In the investigation to be reported in this paper the effect of 
entrained air on the durability of concrete was evaluated by the use of 
an automatic freeze-thaw unit and by CaCl^ scaling tests* 

The effect of the cycles of freezing and thawing on the concrete 
were determined by use of the sonic test in which the modulus of elasticity 
of the concrete was obtained dyanmically. Scaling tests were used to 
determine the resistance of air-entrained concrete to scaling caused by 
the use of CaC^ for ice removal. An air meter was designed to determine 
the air content of the mixes used. The effect of the entrained air on the 
strength of the concrete was evaluated by cylinder tests and beam flexural 


tests

PART I LABORATORY EQUIPMENT 
CHAPTER I 


PRESSURE AIR METER 


Introduction 

The amount of air entrained by air-entraining agents in concrete 
is of major importance* If too little air is entrained in the concrete 
the full potential benefits of air entrainment are not realized; if too 
much air is entrained serious losses in strength will result. 

For many years determinations of the air content of fresh con¬ 
crete have been made by the so-called "gravimetric method" (A.S.T.M. C13S- 
44 ) « In this method the sum of the absolute volumes of the ingredients 
in a known volume of concrete is calculated and subtracted from the known 
volume, the difference being taken as the volume of air in the concrete. 

The accuracy of this method depends upon the accuracy of a series of 
measurements and assumptions as follows. 

(a) Weight per cubic foot of fresh concrete. This measurement is 
dependent on the accuracy of the sampling, uniformity of placing, accuracy 
of strike-off, and the precision of the weighing scale. 

(b) The weight of materials used per batch of concrete. The accuracy 
of these weights is dependent on the type and accuracy of batching equip¬ 
ment used. 

(c) Specific Gravities of cement and aggregate. 

(d) Absorption of water by aggregate in concrete. 

(e) Moisture content of aggregate used in concrete. 

The gravimetric method is not as accurate, rapid or practical 
as desired for field determinations of air content and requires a weigh¬ 
ing scale which is difficult to transport and maintain under job conditions.

In both field and laboratory the accuracy of results depends on compu¬ 
tations which must be carried to at least the fourth decimal place — 
well beyond the accuracy obtainable with a slide rule. 

The direct volumetric method (A.S.T.M. - C173 - 42T) is a 
widely used laboratory method. In this method the absolute volume of a 
known weight of concrete is obtained by displacing the air in the concrete 
with water. The air content is then obtained by subtracting the absolute 
volume from the bulk volume of an equal weight of the concrete. This 
type of test has several sources of error. 

(a) In the displacement process, the sample of concrete is diluted with 
some six to eight times as much water as the original sample contained* 

This further solution of the cement particles causes shrinkage which will 
be greater than that in the original mix. As a result the percentage of 
air as determined is too high, 

(b) Another source is the possibility of not displacing alT the air 
from the sample in the washing-out process. 

(c) The difficulty encountered due to foam and scum from the air- 
entraining agent in bringing the final volume of water up to the pycnometer 
calibration level. 

(d) Weight per cubic foot of concrete. This measurement is dependent 
on the accuracy of the sampling, uniformity of placing, accuracy of strike- 
off, and the precision of the weighing scale. 

(e) A temperature correction is required to get the accurate volume of 
water displacing the air. This requires calculations accurate to four 
significant figures. 

The volumetric method is not practical for field determinations 
of air content as it requires scales accurate to,5 grams in the field. 

The method is very time-consuming as well as requiring calculations of

accuracy considerably beyond that of the slide rule. 

Two new methods of measuring the air content of fresh concrete 
have been advanced in the last few years. A vacuum method has been ad¬ 
vocated. This method consists essentially of measuring the amount of 
water required to replace the air removed from a given volume of concrete 
during agitation under a reduced pressure. This method effects a more 
complete removal of the air, especially from concretes containing air 
entraining agents. However, this method is practically restricted to 
laboratory testing because of the numerous weighings and measurements 
involved. Considerable trouble is encountered with the foam resulting 
from the use of air-entraining agents. It is sucked off during the de¬ 
airing process but cannot be discarded because of its water content. It 
is drawn off into a trap where further suction breaks it down so that it 

dan be taken into account in the calculations. 

1 

The pressure method in which the concrete is placed in a closed, 
pressure-tight vessel and then subjected to pressure to compress the en¬ 
trained air, is the method used in this investigation. By the application 
of Boyle*s Law, according to which the volume of a gas (at a given temper¬ 
ature) is inversely proportional to the pressure to which it is subjected, 
the volume of air present in the concrete is determined by the amount it 
is compressed by a given increase in pressure. 

This method Is well adapted for field testing as the pressure 
meter can be calibrated to indicate directly the gross air content of 
fresh concrete. As a result it was decided to design a pressure air meter 
which would be well suited for rapid and accurate air-content determinations 
both in the laboratory and the field.

General Details of Design and Description of Meter 


It was decided to keep the design as simple as possible by 
using standard pipe sizes and fittings wherever possible. This kept 
the machining costs at a minimum and made the pressure meter as economical 
a unit as possible. 

In deciding on the size of the meter container two things had 
to be kept in mind. First of all the meter as a unit had to be of such 
a size, shape, and weight as to be readily handled by one man. • Secondly, 
the container and stand pipe had to be of such a size as to ensure volume * 
changes that could give scale divisions of 0.1 percent. A container of 
0.3 cubic foot volume was considered the upper limit for handling by one 
man. Volume changes of one percent in the container give water level 
changes of one inch in a li-inch diameter stand pipe. This allowed a 
calibration accuracy of around 0.05 percent which is adequate. A 10-inch 
length of 8-inch diameter wrought iron pipe was used for the container.. 

A standard water gauge was used for the scale. The meter scale was cal¬ 
ibrated for an applied load of 15 p.s.i. An ordinary bicycle pump is 
adequate for applying this pressure. The pressure gauge used on the meter 
has a working pressure of 30 p.s.i. with scale divisions to the nearest 
pound. A rubber gasket is used to make the junction between the container 
and the stand pipe air and water tight. (See Figure 1). 

Calibration of Air Mete r 

The calibration of the air meter was carried out in the manner 

9 

suggested by ^Klein and Walker* 1 . The calculation of the air content is 
based on Boyle 1 s Law — the volume occupied by a given mass of any gas at 
constant temperature varies inversely as the absolute pressure to which

Procedure in Determining Air-Content by the Pressure Method 


j 






Figure 4. Illustration of Pressure Method of Test for Air Content 



















13 


A 0.30 cubic foot cample of concrete is placed in the container 
of the pressure meter. The container is filled in three lifts of equal 
volume, each lift being rodded twenty-five times. On completion of rodding 
each lift, the container is struck sharply ten times with the tamping rod. 
This will bring the mortar to the surface and thus prevent excessive 
quantities of air being trapped by the following lift. A sheet of plexi¬ 
glass was found to be very satisfactory for leveling off the concrete in 
the container and for finishing the concrete surface. However, a trowel 
or the tamping rod would be adequate in the field. The cone shaped cover 
is then clamped to the flange of the container, a pressure tight seal being 
obtained with a thin rubber gasket. Pressure is then applied to the sur¬ 
face of the concrete through the water in the stand pipe which is attached 
to the vertex of the cone. The air pressure is furnished by a small bi¬ 
cycle pump, and is measured by the pressure gauge on top of the stand pipe. 
The contraction in volume of the air in the concrete with the increase in 
pressure is indicated by a lowering in level of the water in the glass 
gauge connected to the stand pipe. The scale on the glass gauge is cal¬ 
ibrated to indicate the total air content directly for an applied pressure 
of 15 p.s.i. The applied air pressure is then released slowly allowing 
the water column to come back to rest near zero. This difference from 
zero has to be noted and subtracted from the total reading. 

The variation of barometric pressure in any one general locality 
is not likely to be sufficient to cause appreciable error in the meter 
calibration. However, barometric pressures do vary sufficiently from 
locality to locality. This variation can be taken into account without 
appreciable error by changing the applied pressure.

Corrections Made to Gross Air Content Reading 

The actual air content (net air content) of the concrete is 
obtained by subtracting a correction factor from the total (gross) air 
content reading. This factor corrects for: 

1. Compression of the air in the aggregates. 

This factor is determined independently by applying pressure to a 
sample of fine and coarse aggregate in the same condition, amount, and 
proportions as they occur in the concrete sample under test. It is 
generally more convenient to determine this factor on separate samples 
of fine and coarse aggregate. In running this test the aggregate should 
be poured slowly into the container filled with water. Vigorous stirring 
should accompany the pouring in an effort to keep the air trapped about 
the aggregate particles to a minimum. 

The air content of the aggregate depends upon the absorption 
and moisture content of the aggregate.

This compression factor for the aggregate used need only be 
checked when the source of aggregate is changed or there is a marked 
change in the absorption of the aggregate. 

2. Expansion of apparatus under applied pressure. 

This expansion is measured by noting the drop in level of the water 
in the graduated gauge tube when the apparatus filled only with, water is 
subjected to the same pressure as is applied in the test of a sample of 
concrete. The expansion factor for the meter used in the laboratory is 
0.1 percent. 

3. Recover} 7 * factor. 

On release of the applied pressure the water column does not as a 
rule return to the zero mark. This is due to a readjustment of the con¬ 
crete mass under the applied pressure and cannot be attributed to the air 
content of the concrete. The percentage that the water column does not 
recover on release of the applied pressure has to be subtracted from the 
gross air content reading. This percentage is called the recovery factor. 

In laboratory work the above three correction factors should be 
subtracted from the total air content reading to get the net air content 
of the concrete. When used as a control in field testing sufficient 
accuracy is obtained by correcting for the recovery factor. 

Comparison of Air Content Determination Methods 

Results used are from tests made in the laboratory. Local sands 
and gravel were used in all cases. Some of the batches of concrete were 

made without air entraining agents, while in the majority of cases air was 
entrained by the use of commercial air-entraining agents. A few tests were 
carried out using air-entraining portland cement. All batches were mixed in 
the 0,5 cubic foot laboratory mixer. 

The diagrams of Figures 5, 6 and 7 compare air contents as 
determined by the gravimetric, volumetric, and pressure methods.

Gravimetric vs. Volumetric 

The best fit line of the plot of % Air Content (gravimetric 

method) vs. % Air Content (volumetric method) is parallel but displaced 

considerably to the right of the line of equality* The graph indicates 

the the gravimetric method gives air contents some* one percent lower than 

the volumetric method. This difference is consistant with those found by 

3 

others between the gravimetric and volumetric method* J.C. Pearson re¬ 
ported an average difference between the two methods of 0.8 percent. In 
several of the tests when no air entraining agent was used the gravimetric 
method was found to indicate negative air contents. This is probably due 
to the inaccuracy of obtaining the weight per cubic foot of the concrete, 
which is dependent on the accuracy of sampling, uniformity of placing, and 
accuracy of the strike-off. 

Gravimetric vs. Pressure Method 

The best fit line of the plot of % Air Content (gravimetric 
method) vs. % Air Content (pressure method) is offset to the right of the 
tt line of equality* 1 . The t?;o lines are not parallel indicating that the 
gravimetric method gives results closer to those of the pressure method 
at the higher air contents. In general the gravimetric method indicates 
air contents some one percent lower than the pressure method. 

Volumetric vs. Pressure Method 

The best fit line of the plot of % Air Content (volumetric 
method) vs. % Air Content (pressure method) nearly coincides with the line 
of equality. There is a very good check between the two methods. The 
graph does indicate that the volumetric method tends to give slightly

higher results at loi/er air contents and slightly lower results than the 
pressure method at high air contents, 

Conclusions 

A very good check was obtained between the results from the 
pressure method and the volumetric method. The pressure method has, 
however, the advantage of being much more rapid and requires no computing. 
This makes it an ideal method for field testing*

CHAPTER II 


SONIC EQUIPMENT 


Introduction 

Two important dynamical properties of any elastic system are 
the natural frequency of vibration and damping capacity. In the case of 
a vibrating beam of given dimensions, the natural frequency of vibration 
is related principally to its modulus of elasticity and the mass density* 

The modulus of elasticity of materials such as concrete has been 
determined during the past few years by dynamic methods. This method re¬ 
quires the measurement of the natural frequency of vibration of prismatic 
bars, from which the modulus of elasticity can be calculated by various 
known relations, depending on the nature of the vibrating system employed. 
Both longitudinal and flexural vibations have been used, the specimen 
being vibrated by electro magnetic, electrostatic, or by mechanical means. 


Equations Used 

In any complete text book on sound there may be found the follow¬ 
ing equation relating the natural frequency of vibration of a beam to the 
modulus of elasticity.

Equation (1) was obtained by solving the differential equation 
for the motion of a bar vibrating in flexure in the free mode. When a bar 
vibrates a cross-sectional element may be thought of executing two move¬ 
ments, a motion of translation laterally, and one of rotation relative to 
the position of the unbent neutral axis. In the derivation of equation (3), 
the rotary inertia was neglected for the sake of simplicity and because 
in most cases the error introduced thereby is not large. However, if the 
thickness of the vibrating beam is relatively large compared to the length, 
as in the case in most concrete beams, the rotatory inertia must be taken 
into account. Also neglected are the effects of the moments of shear and 
lateral inertia. Lateral inertia is due to the lateral contraction and 
expansion of the vibrating bar. A more rigorous solution has been worked 
out in which these effects are taken into account. 

The results of this solution give: 

E = 4tt 2 J? 4 f 2 g T 

Y? a/* 

where T is a complicated correction term depending on the 
ratio of thickness to length and on Poisson 1 s ratio. The values of T 
for different ratios of thickness to length are shown in Figure 8. This 
correction is applicable to beams of rectangular cross-section only.

Apparatus 

The dynamic testing apparatus consists of a method of supporting 
the specimen so that it will vibrate in some prescribed mode of vibration; 
second, a method of vibrating the specimen in that mode; third, a means 
of measuring the frequency of vibratipn; and fourth, a measurement of the 
dimensions and density of the specimen* 

The means of support should permit the specimen to vibrate 
transversely in the free mode without restriction. This was accomplished 
by supporting the beam at its nodal points (0.224 of its length from each 
end) or on a thick pad of sponge rubber. Identical results were obtained 
also by supporting the beam at its ends. Supporting the beam at its ends 
would not prove feasible as disintegration progressed under freezing and 
thawing. Supporting the beam at its nodal points was found to give better 
and more consistent results than those obtained with the beam supported 
on the rubber pad. This is quite possibly due to the fact that the beams 
are tested in the saturated condition so that an adhesive or suction 
force is developed between the beam and rubber pad causing a damping effect 
on the vibration. This damping effect was found to cause differences of 
as much as 100 cycles/sec. in the resonant frequencies. As a result it 
was decided to vibrate the beam with supports at the nodal points. The 
supports used were obtained by splitting a l/8 M square steel bar down a 
diagonal. 

The driving circuit consists of a variable frequency audio 
oscillator, and a driving unit. The oscillator is a Hewlett Packard 
No. 11012, calibrated to.read within f 2 % of the true frequency over its 
range of use (550 to 6000 cycles). The oscillator is coupled through a 
transformer to a 6 inch magnet type loud speaker, a light aluminum rod 
being cemented, to the voice coil of the speaker, for transmitting the

vibration to the specimen. The speaker is attached to a wall of the 
beam supporting box by a hinge in such a way that the driving rod pro¬ 
trudes through a hole in the top and can be brought into contact with 
the underside of the supported beam by means of an adjusting screvj. The 
speaker was found to have a resonant frequenBj of its own at around 650 
cycles/sec. This is well below the resonant frequency of most concrete 
specimens tested and should not give testing difficulties* 

The pickup circuit consists of a pickup unit, an amplifier, and 
a meter. The pickup unit should be of the type which generates a voltage 
proportional to the amplitude or velocity of vibration of the test specimen. 

It is required that the vibrating parts of the pickup be small in mass as 

compared with that of the test specimen. This is to guard against the 

- 

. 

pickup having a resonant frequency within the range of the test specimen. 

' 

A piezo-electric crystal pickup was tried first. It proved unusable be¬ 
cause of the inconsistent and erratic results obtained with it. Much of 
the trouble was probably due to the needle contact which proved over-sensjgive. 
The crystal oickup was also found to have a series of resonant frequencies 
from 500 to 1000 cycles/sec. An electro-magnetic pickup proved satisfactory 
giving consistant results. This type of pickup has a much larger contact 
surface and as a result is not as susceptible to local aggregate vibrations 
as tbs crystal pickup. This type of pickup was also found to have a flat 
resonant peak at around 700 cycles/sec. This type of resonant peak will 
not give testing difficulties. Due to the low impedance of electro magnetic 
pickup less difficulty can be expected from stray electrical disturbances. 

Since the ratio of the amplitude at the ends to that at the center of a 
beam vibrating in the free free mode is approximately 1.6, better results 
are obtained by placing the pickup in contact with the end of the beam.

Since many specimens will vibrate at their natural frequency 
when excited at half or one third, or even one fourth their natural fre¬ 
quency, care must be taken that the oscillator and specimen are vibrating 
at the same frequency. This is readily ascertained by synchronizing the 
sweep frequency of an oscillograph with the osciOLstor frequency and by 
placing the pickup unit first on the speaker and then on the specimen; an 
identical frequency is shown if the same number of waves appear on the 
oscillograph for each case. By using a double switch the oscillator and 
pickup can be both connected to the oscillograph and a comparison of waves 
can be more readily made. Familiarity with the relationship existing 
between beam size, concrete strength, and resonant frequency make the use 
of an oscillograph unnecessary. 

The dimensions of the specimen should be determined with con¬ 
siderable accuracy (*f 1 %) because they are used to a power in the equation 
relating resonant frequency and, the modulus of elasticity. The density 
of the specimen is best obtained by obtaining the weight of the beam while 
submerged. This proved more accurate than weighing the displaced water 
because of the varying effect surface tension had on the amount of water 
displaced. The density of the beam is best obtained while in the original 
state before undergoing freezing and thawing. This density can be used 
in all subsequent calculations as the cycles of freezing and thawing have 
little or no\ effect on the beam*s density. 

Testing Procedure 

The specimen is supported at the nodes. The driver is then 
brought into contact with the beam. The pickup ie held in place on one 
end of the beam by a strong rubber band. The pickup should be placed on 
the top surface of the beam so that it'will be actuated in the plane of

vibration. The frequency of the oscillator is then varied until the 
amplitude of vibration of the specimen reaches a maximum as shown by the 
meter. The reading on the frequency dial of the oscillator is then noted. 
The amplifiers in the driving and pickup circuits should be adjusted to 
provide a satisfactory meter reading. To avoid chattering of the driver 
against the specimen, the driving force should be maintained as low as is 
feasible for good resonance response. 

Conclusions 

1. When the elastic behavior of concrete is studied under the 
action' of a deteriorating agent it is often sufficient to present the 
results in terms of the frequency of vibration. If the results are to be 
compared with the findings of other investigators It is desirable to 
present them in terms of the modulus of elasticity which is a physical 
property of the material. 

2. If quantitative values of the modulus of elasticity are to 
be determined it is necessary to correct the value for the size and shape 
of the specimen. This is done by using the correction curve of Figure 8. 

3. Testing of the beams in a saturated condition proved satis¬ 
factory. Moisture changes were found to have an effect on the resonant 
frequency. However, they are negligible for any change which is apt to 
occur in normal practise.

CHAPTER III 

AUTOMATIC ACCELERATED FRESZ ING-a nd- THAff ING APPARATUS FOR C PNC PE'IE 

Introduction 

The resistance of concrete to frost action is dependent on many 
variables potentially present in the composition of the hardened material 
and the method of test. Such factors as the chemistry of the cement, 
degree and rate of hydration; the nature, grading, and thermal properties 
of the fine and coarse aggregate; and the homogeneity of the mixture affect 
the composition of the hardened concrete. The rate of cooling, degree of 
cooling, the rate of warming, degree of warming, size and shape of specimen, 
the relative degree of moisture saturation of the aggregate and matrix are 
independent variables which affect the resistance of the concrete to frost 
action. 

It is impossible to reproduce in the laboratory conditions of 
weathering to which any particular member of a structure will be exposed. 

In one case a structure may be subjected to many and frequent reversals of 
freezing and thawing due to exposure to sunlight in the daytime and 
temperatures below freezing at night. In other cases a structure may be 
exposed for long intervals to very low temperatures. In most cases the 
structure would be under highly varying conditions of moisture saturation. 
The degree and depth of frost penetration of each cycle will be a function 
of the mass of concrete and the ambient temperature* 

It is thus impossible to standardize a test procedure which 
will permit definite correlation with service of the structure. However, 
a procedure which is highly reproducible and sufficiently severe and rapid 
to permit determination of the potential relative durability of the concrete 
in question in sufficient time to make the data usable as the basis of an

acceptance test would be of great value. This type of procedure would be 
ideal for running comparative durability tests on concrete and concrete 
materials. 

With this in mind, Charles E. Wuerpel and Herbert K. Cook^, de¬ 
vised an apparatus which 11 (a) would be entirely automatic and require no 
movement of the test specimens during the desired reversals of temperature, 
(b) would develop thermal gradients of a severe but highly reproducible 
nature, and (c) would maintain a constant moisture saturation influence. 

The premises upon which the mechanical design was based were: (a) reduction 
in specimen temperature from 42 f 2° F to 0 + 2° F in one hour; (b) ele¬ 
vation of the specimen temperature from 0 + 2° F to 42 4* 2° F in the second 
hour, (c) repeated reversals of this cycle to the number desired, (d) im¬ 
mersion of the specimen at all times in the water, and (e) uniform thermal 
effects on all specimens tested.” 

A similar piece of equipment was designed, constructed and 
installed in the concrete laboratory. This unit has a capacity of 12 
specimens as compared to the 102 specimens of Wuerpel 1 s equipment. 

Description of Apparatus 

The apparatus consists essentially of three tanks; a specimen 
tank, cold tank, and thaw tank; with means for cooling the cold fluid, 
heating the thaw fluid, and circulating the cold and thaw fluids at the 
right temperatures in and out of the specimen tank during the right inter¬ 
vals of time. A schematic diagram of the apparatus is shown in Figure 11. 
The unit is capable of reducing the temperature of 12 - 4i x 3i x 16 
specimens from 55° F to 0° F in one hour and in raising the temperature

from 0° F to 55° F in the following hour. It will repeat the above 
2 hour cycle any number of times. A detailed description of the units 1 
various component parts follows. 

Freezing-and-Thawing Solutions 

A mixture of 60 percent denatured alcohol and 40 percent water 
is used for both the thaw and cold solutions. This mixture has a freezing 
point of -40° F. The cold fluid in the cold tank is kept at -20° F but 
the temperature of the cold plates of the refrigerator may be as low as 
-35° F making the alcohol water mixture necesssary* The concentration of 
the mixture was not changed for the thaw fluid because of the intermingling 
of the fluids which is bound to occur and also because of the possible 
necessity of storing all the fluid in two tanks while the system undergoes 
repairs. Approximately 90 gallons of alcohol and ^0 gallons of water were 
required to fill the system. 

Gold Tank and Refrigeration Unit 

The cold tank is made of IB gauge galvanized iron with soldered 
joints. The inside dimensions are 24 H x 24^ x 4^ M . The tank is insulated 
with 4 inches of cork. A vapour barrier of asphalt was placed between the 
tank and cork and between the cork and tongue and groove board sheathing. 
This vapor barrier prevents the formation of a layer of ice between the 
tank and cork insulation or insulation and sheathing. Four refrigeration 
plates in units of two, are supported 6 inches above the bottom of the 
tank. The plates are 19 T! x 21 f! x 1»* having double radiation surfaces. 

The plates are controlled by a thermostatic expansion valve. The upper 
B inches of the tank house the expansion valves, refrigerant piping, and 
solinoid valve. The cold tank contains some 75 gallons of fluid when not 
in use. The cold fluid is removed from the bottom of the cold tank through

a li n pumpline. The fluid then passes through a strainer into the cold 
pump. It is then pumped passed a check valve and through a globe valve 
into the specimen tank. The globe valve is used to control the rate of 
flow of cold fluid into the specimen tank. A perforated pipe the length 
of the specimen tank distributes the cold fluid uniformly throughout the 
specimen tank. The cold fluid returns by means of a lj° gravity line 
from the overflow pipe. 

This method of inlet and discharge provides ample circulation 
across the refrigeration plates and mechanical agitation is not required* 
The cold inlet and return lines are insulated with 2 inches of asbestos 
paste. An asphalt vapour barrier was placed on both sides of the in¬ 
sulation. The refrigeration is performed by a 2 H.P., 220 volt, 60 cycle, 

3 phase, water-cooled condensing unit using Freon F-12 as the refrigerant. 
The unit has a capacity of 10,000 B.T.U. per hour. 

Thaw Tank and Heating Equipment 

The thaw tank is constructed out of 16 gauge galvanized iron 
with soldered joints. It is a circular tank 24” in diameter and 43 inches 
high. The thaw tank was not insulated as the thaw solution was to be kept 
at or near room temperature. The tank has a tongue and groove sheath cover 
which keeps evaporation losses to a minimum. Two 1000 watt, 200 volt 
immersion heaters are installed diagonally across from each other 6 inches 
above the bottom of the tank. The heaters are controlled by a thermostat 
set at 70° F which actuates a mercury switch which- operates the heaters. 

The solution of the thaw tank is kept at a depth of 12 inches when the 
thaw fluid is in circulation. The thaw tank contains some 75 gallons of 
fluid when not in use. The arrangement and size of the circulation lines 


are similar to those for the cold fluid.

Specimen Tank, Racks, and C o ntainer 

The specimen tank is constructed from 18 gauge galvanized iron 
with soldered joints. It has 2 inches of cork for insulation. A vapour 
barrier of asphalt w a s placed between the tank and cork and cork and tongue 
and groove sheathing. The cover consists of tongue and groove sheathing 
on both sides of a 2 inch layer of cork. The inside dimensions of the 
tank are 21” in depth, 21” in width, and 27 ” in length. The tank is 
designed to hold 4 racks. Each rack is capable of holding 3 specimens. 

There is a li inch diameter drain pipe in the bottom of the specimen tank. 

The flow through the drain is directed to the right tank by motorized valves. 

The overflow pipe consists of a horizontal I 4 inch diameter pipe with the \ 

upper half removed. It is connected to the vertical overflow drain line 
by a T fitting.

Figure 15. Plan View of Specimen Tank 



Figure 16. Specimen Racks and Containers 






























The overflow pipe is centered in the tank and is as long as the specimen 
tank is wide. The solution is pumped into the specimen tank through two 
perforated pipes each running the length of the specimen tank. One is for 
the incoming thaw solution and one for the cold solution. The openings in 
these pipes are 3/16" diameter at 6" centers. The openings are directed 
slightly downward from the horizontal so as to cause a circular flow of 
solution across the lower portion of the tank and specimens, up the other 
side, and back across the top portion to the overflow outlet. 

The concrete specimens are pl a ced in vertical containers made 
out of 18 gauge galvanized iron. The inside dimensions of these containers 
are 3 3/U" x k 3/h" x 17 3/U" deep. 

The racks are made from 1" x 1" x angle iron and 3/8” and 
rod. These rods form an open structure above the base made of the angle 
iron. This allows free circulation of the solution around the specimen 
containers. There are four racks identical in si z e each holding 3 specimens. 
The recks suspend the specimens 3 inches above the bottom of the specimen 
tank. The racks are of such a size as to be handled by one man. 

Pu mps, Valves, Controls, and Safety Device 

The circulation of the cold and thaw fluids is accomplished by 
two centrifugal pumps rated at 25 U.S. gallons per minute at a 15 foot head. 
Direct connected motor pump units were used. Since only one solution is 
circulated at a time common pipes are employed in the overflow and drain 
lines from the specimen tank. The solution is directed to the proper tank 
by valving through three electrically operated globe valves. One on the 
cold return line, one on the thaw return line, and the other on the drain 
line. Since the specimen tank is at a higher elevation than the cold and 
thaw tanks, overflow and drainage from the specimen tank is accomplished 
by gravity flow through 1 jlj diameter pipes. All drainage lines and the 
cold pump line are insulated with asbestos paste. Leakage of solution 
from one tank to another through pump lines is prevented by a check

valve installed above the pumps. 

Since all valves and pumps are electrically operated, circulation 
of the solution is made entirely automatic by means of a 2 hour four 
circuit timer. The timer consists of a series of properly shaped cams 
mounted on a common shaft and driven by an electric motor. As the shaft 
revolves the cams will open and. close the various circuits in their 
proper sequence. (See Figure 19 for circuit diagram). For example, con¬ 
sider the cold pump circuit. When the cam-operated contacts close the 
circuit is completed and the coil is energized and closes the relay start¬ 
ing the cold pump. When the contacts separate due to the rotation of the 
cam the circuit is broken, the relay opens and the pump stops. Similar 
circuits operate the hot pump and drain valves. However, the cold return 
valve and hot return valve are capable of being operated by a double relay 
since when one valve is closed the other valve can be opened in the same 
operation. This cuts down on the number of circuits required in the timer. 
The timer is fitted with a four circuit, double pole, double throw switch 
which when thrown to the right makes the controls automatic, and when 
thrown to the left makes manual control possible. An ordinary revolution 
counter which records the accumulative number of cycles is attached to the 
cam shaft. Figure IS shows the timer, the counter, and liquid level safety 
controls. The sequence of operation of the valves and pumps is given below.

Without automatic liquid level control devices it is possible 
for any of the three tanks to be filled to overflowing because of failure 
of any of the electric valves to operate. Because the cold return valve 
is at a lower elevation than the hot return valve there is a gradual 
transfer of solution to the cold tank. This requires a periodical re¬ 
transfer of solution from the cold tank to the thaw tank. Overflow and 
loss of solution by either of the above means is prevented by a pair of 
liquid level control probes installed in each tank just below the point 
where overflow might occur. See Figure 20 for circuit diagram of liquid 
level safety controls. When the liquid control probes are not shorted 
by touching the solution a voltage drop occurs across the 100K resister. 
This voltage drop puts a potential on the probe in the cold cathode tube 
causing it to fire, and thus pass current through relay coil number one, 
and consequently closing relay switch number one. This completes the 
current through relay coil number two and keeps the contacts on relay 
number two closed. This in turn completes the circuit through the hold

button for the supply for the whole unit. 'hen the liquid control probes 
are shorted by coming in contact with the solution no potential is devel¬ 
oped on the probe in the cold cathode tube. As a result the tube passes 
no current. This opens relay number one which breaks the circuit in relay 
coil number two. This in turn breaks the hold button circuit and cuts the 
whole unit from the supply. This maintains the solutions at whatever 
level they may be. The solutions can then be redistributed by use of the 
manual controls. 

Temperature Records 

A beam with thermo couples embedded in its ends was used to 
check the circulation of the fluid in the specimen tank and to determine 
its effect on beams in various positions of the tank. A thermo couple was 
also suspended in the center of the specimen tank to get the mean temper- 
cature of the circulating fluid during a freeze-thaw cycle. The normal 
operating temperature of the circulating fluid and the temperature changes 
of the thermo couple specimens are shown in Figure 21. The circulating 
fluid holds its temperature very well giving rapid freezing and thawing. 

The temperature difference between the top and bottom ends of the specimens 
will have little if any effect on the results especially if the specimens 
are turned end for end daily on completion of testing. 

O peration of Equipment and Testing of Specimens 

Except for routine checking of the liquid level in the hot and 
cold tanks and for general mechanical operation the unit is completely 
automatic. A great advantage of this type of unit is that the specimens 
require no handling except when actual testing is required. The unit does 
give a large number of exposure cycles rapidly and without attention.

Figure 21. Typical Freeze-Thaw Cycle 

































































A suggested laboratory procedure is to store the specimens in 
water at 70° F for nine days after making before subjecting them to the 
accelerated freezing and thawing test. This makes it possible to furnish 
test results by the end of a 2£ day period. This brings it in line with 
the present 2& day testing of cylinders. It is customary to have control 
specimens for each group of test specimens. The dynamic modulus of 
elasticity of both the test and control specimen is determined by the 
sonic method at the 9 day age. 

The test specimens can be removed daily from the apparatus and 
the dynamic modulus again determined. This allows for eleven complete 
cycles of freezing and thawing every 24 hours. All results are expressed 
in terms of relative E which is the percentage change in dynamic E. The 
dynamic 3 at zero cycles is taken at 100 percent. Freezing and thawing 
cycles are continued until the relative E has decreased to 50^ of that 
at the 9 day age or until the test has been continued to a specified 
number of cycles. When the freeze-thaw testing has been completed and the 
final determination of 33 has been made the specimens are tested in flexure 
by mid-point loading. The dynamic E and flexural strength of the control 
specimen is also determined at this time. The durability factor (DFE) 
based on dynamic modulus of elasticity, and the durability factor (DFM) 
based on the modulus of rupture are calculated from the following formulas. 

DFE = PN - 
M 

where DFE = durability factor in percent of the dynamic 
modulus of elasticity at 0 cycles. 

P z relative dynamic modulus of elasticity or greater 

N z number of cycles at which P reaches 50 percent or 

the ultimate number of cycles of the test if 
P does not reach 50p prior to the ultimate cycle,

THE LABORATORY CONCRETE MIXER 


Description of Mixer 

The laboratory concrete mixer is a 0.5 cubic foot tilting drum 
type mixer (Figure 22). It was designed as a scale model of the mixers 
used on the Grand Coulee Dam. The mixer is powered by a 1/3 H.P. electric 
motor and is operated at a speed of 20 revolutions per minute.

? 

Efficiency tests run on the mixer indicated that a mixing period 
of 5 minutes gives the most uniform and consistant results. 

Tests were run on the mixer prior to its use in the investigation 
to determine its suitability for mixing air-entrained concrete. Compar¬ 
ative tests were run between the laboratory mixer and a cubic yard field 
mixer. Identical mixes of normal concrete and air-entrained concrete were 
mixed by the two mixers. Air content determinations were run on the con¬ 
crete as well as test cylinders. Air entrainment was obtained by the use 
of both air-entraining cement and air-entraining agents added to the mixer. 
Results from these tests are given in Table 5.

The results indicated that the laboratory mixer entrained 
air contents comparable to those obtained with the field mixer. A 
reasonable check was also obtained between the cylinder results although 
more tests should be conducted on strength comparisons. 

This comparison with the field, mixer is of definite value as 
it allows for a direct correlation of the results of the investigation to 


field conditions 
















































PART II LABORATORY INVESTIGATION 


SYNOPSIS 


The purpose of the laboratory work carried out was to inves¬ 
tigate air-entrainment in concrete and to determine its effect on 
durability. 

Cylinder compression tests and beam flexural tests were used 
to determine the effect of air-entrainment on the strength characteristics 
of concrete. 

The effect of entrained air on the workability of concrete was 
evaluated by slump and flow tests as well as by visual descriptions. 

Freeze-thaw tests and scaling tests were used to bring out the 
effect of entrained air on the durability of concrete. The sonic method 
of obtaining the modulus of elasticity of concrete beams was used to 
evaluate the effect of freeze-thaw cycles on concrete beams. The loss in 
weight accompanying the freeze-thaw cycles was also used as a means of 
comparison.

CHAPTER II 


GENERAL LAYOUT OF TESTING PROGR AM 

Two series of tests were conducted on each of two lots of 
Doncaster washed sand. The two series of tests on a particular lot 
were conducted on different days* - One series of tests was made using 
Elk Island sand* 

Five air-entrained mixes and one normal mix were used in each 
series of tests* Pozzolith was added as suggested by the producer. 
Darex was added to give one mix with approximately 3 per cent air and 
one with approximately 6 per cent air. Ayr Trap was added to give two 
mixes with similar air contents. 

The specimens prepared during each test and their identifica¬ 
tion are given in Table 13.

CHAPTER III 


MIX DESIGHS: CONCRETE AND SPECIMEN MANUFACTURE 


Mix Designs 

All mixes used in the investigation were designed for a 
cement content of 5 bags per cubic yard. The slump of the normal mix 
was 3 inches. The workability of the air-entrained mixes was made com¬ 
parable to that of the normal mix by having equivalent flow as obtained 


by the A.S.T.M. C124 - 39 flow test. 


The design of the normal mix was carried out according to 
the A.C.I. Mix Design Procedure^, as follows:

Trial batches proved the mix to be well designed. The 
47 percent sand was found to be the optimum sand content for the normal 
mix. 

The normal mix was redesigned for use as an’air-entrained mix 
7 

as suggested by 7.A. Gordon , The sand content, by weight of total 
aggregate, was reduced one percent for each percent of air entrained. 

The water content was reduced in each case to give a flow equivalent to 
that of the normal mix. 

Trial batches were run to find the quantity of admixture . 
required to give the desired air contents (See Table 13).

Concrete and Specimen Manu f acture 

The sand and gravel were taken up from the storage Bins in 
quantities sufficient for the particular day’s tests. Moisture contents 
were taken regularly on both the fine and coarse aggregate. All pro¬ 
portions were weighed to the nearest ounce. Mixing was accomplished in 
the laboratory 0.5 cubic foot tilting drum mixer. Half of the mixing 
water was first added to the mixer, followed by the coarse aggregate. 

The cement and sand premixed by hand were then added followed by the 
rest of the mixing water. The admixtures Darex and Ayr-Trap were added 
to the water. Pozzolith was added to the sand cement mixture. The 
batches were mixed for five minutes. Timing of mixing started when all 
materials including water had entered the drum. The number of batches 
required for each test were mixed in quick succession in the mixer, and 
then combined by hand mixing with a shovel. A constant check was kept 
on the consistency of the concrete by running a slump test and flow 
test on each mix. The workability of the concrete was also evaluated 
descriptively.

The specimens prepared from each mix are outlined in Table 13. 
All specimens were prepared according to A.S.T.M. standards. The speci¬ 
mens were tested and cured as follows: 

Cylinders - all cylinders poured were 6 ,f x 12 M in size. They 
were stripped at 24 hours and cured in water till time of test. Tests 
were carried out at 7 days, 28 days, and 3 months. All testing was 
carried out in a 200,000 pound range Baldwin testing machine. 

Beams - the 3i u x 4lr M x l6 n beams were stripped at 24 hours and 
cured an additional twenty-seven days in water. One beam from each mix 
was then tested for flexural strength using a concentrated load applied 
at the mid point. (See Figure 23).

CHAPTER IV 


P LASTIC CONCRETE TESTS AND OBSERVATIONS 

The basic mixes (see Table ll;) were designed to develop a 
slump of 3 inches. The actual slumps obtained varied from 2.5 inches 
to 3*5 inches. In an effort to keep the workability of the various 
air-entrained mixes similar to that of the normal mix the flow test 
was used in conjunction with the slump test. A flow of 70% was found 
to be equivalent to a 3-inch slump for the normal mix. This relation¬ 
ship was found to differ very little for the air-entrained mixes. As 
the air content of the mixes increased the slump required for a 70% 
flow decreased' slightly. At constant slump and flow the air entrained 
mixes became appreciably more workable. The entrained air made the 
mixes more cohesive and plastic, as well as making them more rodable. 
Small amounts of segregation were evident in the flow test. No trace 
of segregation was evident while handling the air entrained mixes. 

Constant amounts of air entraining agents were used through¬ 
out the investigation. Considerable variation was obtained in the 
resulting air contents. A decrease of approximately one per cent in 
air content occurred in the tests conducted on lots 1 a,nd 2 of 
Doncaster Sand. This decrease can be accounted for by the difference 
in grading of the sands used in the two pours. Lot 1 of washed 
Doncaster Sand was used in pour 1. It had some U6% passing sieve 
#30. Lot 2 of washed Doncaster Sand used in pour 2 has only 39% 
passing sieve #30. The percentages passing sieves U8 and 100 are 
the same for both sands. Thus the sand from lot 1 has some 7% more 
passing sieve #30 than the sand of lot 2. According to data published 

q 

by H.L. Kennedy this change in sand grading could account for some

Q.k% change in air content. There is a fundamental difference between 
the natural air content of a mix and the entrained air content of a mix. 
The entrained air consists of minute sized air bubbles entrained amongst 
the fine sand particles. These air bubbles act as very efficient fine 
aggregate and have a marked effect on the workability of the mix. The 
natural air content , however, is air entrained mechanically by mixing. 

It consists of large air voids which have little or no effect on the 
workability of the mix. The amount of air entrained is dependent on the 
structure of the plastic mix which is in turn dependent on the grading 
and shape of aggregate used. As a result a change in sand grading can 
have an effect on the natural air content of a mix as well as on the 
entrained air content. This is the case with the sands of lot 1 and 
lot 2. The normal mix using sand from lot 2 has an air content of 
only 1.1$ as compared to 1.5$ with sand of lot 1. This 0.1;$ reduction 
in normal air content Would also show up in the total air content of 
the air-entrained mixes. As a result the change in sand grading will 
account for some 0.1;$ decrease in the normal air content and some 0.1;$ 
decrease in the entrained air content. 

The air contents obtained by using Ayr-Trap air-entraining 
agent vary considerably from mix to mix. Variations as great as 0.6$ 
in an air content of 3$ were obtained from two identical mixes. Darex 
proved very stable as an air entraining agent. Air contents were found 
to vary only 0,1$ to 0.2$ from mix to mix. Pozzolith gave consistent 
air contents in the second pour but the air contents varied some 0.6$ 
in pour 1♦ 

The effect of the admixtures used on the water-cement ratio 
in gallons per bag of cement are given in Table 15. Pozzolith has the 
greatest effect reducing the water-cement ratio about 1 gallon per bag 
of cement for an increase of each one per cent in air content. Ayr-Trap 
reduced the water-cement ratio about 1 gallon per bag of cement for an

from 2 to 2 0 $% Darex seems to have a varying effect on the water-cement 
ratio. Reductions of 0.5> to 1 gallon per bag of cement were obtained. 
For an increase of 5% in air content using Darex a consistent reduction 
of 1 gallon per bag of cement was obtained. This ability to reduce the 
water-cement ratio is the controlling factor in the relationship between 
the air entrained in a mix and the resulting strength of the hardened 
concrete. The larger the reduction per per cent increase in air content 
the less adverse effect the entrained air will have on the strength of 


the concrete

CHAPTER V 
STRENGTH TESTS ' 

The cylinder test results of the investigation are given in 
Tables 16, 17, 3.8, 19, and 20. The influence of the various admixtures, 
in the amounts used, on the compressive strength is shown in Table 21. 

All air-entrained mixes used gave compressive strengths greater than those 
of the normal mix except the 6% Darex mix 1 of pour 1, where the 28-day 
and 3-month cylinder results were lower than the normal. The 3% Ayr-Trap 
mix of mix 1, pour 1, also gave 3-month cylinder results lower than those 
of the normal mix. The 6 % Darex mix had an air content of 6,6% which is 
in the range where losses in strength can be expected. The Pozzolith 
mix shows a large increase in strength at the early ages. This could be 
expected because of the large reduction in water accompanying its use and 
because of the accelerator incorporated in the admixture. The Ayr-Trap 
mixes gave good strength increases over those of the normal mixes. The 
strengths increased with increases in air content for the range of air 
contents used. This is due to the large reduction in water demand 
resulting from the use of Ayr-Trap. The beneficial effect on strength 

resulting from the use of the admixtures falls off with age. This is 

particularly evident from the 3-month cylinder results. (See Figures 2li 
and 25). The effect of the accelerator in Pozzolith is very evident in 
Figure 25. 

Plots of water-cement ratio versus compressive strength were 
made from the results. (Figures 26 and 28). Different plots were ms.de 
f or each pour because of the variation in cylinder strengths obtained from 

pour 1. These variations were due to organic material in the sand. Plots 

of void-cement ratio versus compressive strength were also made, (Figures 
27 and 29). These plots are not very informative because of the small

range of compressive strengths used. As a result of this small range of 
compressive strengths only horizontal groupings of points were obtained. 
The plots due, however, indicate a better relationship between void-cement 
ratio and strength than between the water-cement ratio and compressive 
strength. This is in accord with the generally accepted view that the 
void-cement ratio is the controlling factor in air-entrained concrete mix 
design rather than the water-cement ratio. 

The influence of the various admixtures on the flexural strength 
of concrete is shown in Table 22. The results shown are values obtained 
on 3-| n x x 16" beams tested at 28 days. The data indicate that none 
of the admixtures used exert an appreciable adverse influence on the 
flexural strength of the concrete.

CHAPTER VI 


SCALING TESTS 


Introduction 

It is common practice to use rock salt (NaCl) and calcium 
chloride for ice removal from city pavements. It is particularly impor¬ 
tant that the ice which forms during cold weather be removed from the grades, 
at curves, intersections, and around street railway switch points. The in¬ 
creased use of these salts for ice removal has resulted in severe scaling 
of the pavements. The mixing of the salts with cinders and sand to re¬ 
duce the concentration of the salt has not solved the problem. The salt 
accumulates during the course of the winter due to repeated applications, 
and at times has been found in layers as much as i inch thick. Traffic 
has a tend.ancy to carry the salt from intersections onto the side streets. 

In this way the scaling problem becomes fairly widespread, involving con¬ 
siderable maintenance and. new construction. 

The purpose of this phase of the investigation is to determine 
the effect of air-entrained in concrete on the resistance of concrete to 
scaling produced by using salts for ice removal. 

Testing Procedure 

18 H x 6 ft x 2 U concrete slabs were used as test specimens. 

A 1 M x l n dyke was formed around the bottom surface by building up the 
center portion of the bottom of the form. This gives a test surface 
16» x A ,} . See Figure 30.

Figure 30* Slab Forms for Scaling Test 


All test specimens were fabricated by use of a standardized procedure* 

The forms were covered with a thin film of petroleum to facilitate their 

removal. The form was then filled ?<rith concrete and rodded 25 times* 

The sides of the slabs were spaded to insure that a water-tight dyke was 
formed on the bottom surface of the slab. The surface was troweled level 
with the forms* The slab was then placed in the moist room for 24 hours 
after which time the forms were removed. The specimens were then allowed 
to cure under water for an additional 27 days* 

At the end of the curing period the slabs were weighed and 

placed in the cold room for a period of 24 hours. A thin layer of fresh 

water was then allowed to freeze on the surface of the slab. After approx¬ 
imately 18 hours of freezing the ice surface was covered with 60 grams of 
calcium chloride. This corresponds to 3 pounds per square yard which does 
not exceed the quantity generally used in practice. The slabs were allowed 
to remain in the cold room under the thawing action of the calcium chloride 
for from 4 to 6 hours. The cold room was kept at -13° C. During the last 
hour of the thawing period the salt solution was poured off and the surface 
brushed with a wire brush, and fresh water again applied to the surface.

The slab was then again frozen for 13 hours. This ‘cycle was repeated 
every day in the week except Sunday, when the slabs were allowed to freeze 
some 42 hours. 

The calcium chloride used was purchased from local sources, 

A chemical analysis was obtained on the lot to see if it contained any 
foreign material. The chemical analysis indicated the calcium chloride 
to be of very good quality, having only 0,21$ of sodium sulphate. Salts 
used have occasionally been found to contain a high percentage of sodium 
sulphate. Severe scaling will result from a high sulphate content. 

A visual evaluation of the scaling based on the percent of the 
surface scaled proved satisfactory. The extent of the scaling of the 
surface of the slabs is indicated by the following rating. 

F.S. - Fine Scaling - scaling off of a fine layer of cement 
paste from the slab surface. 

L. S. - Light Scaling - scaling off of a thin layer of fine 

aggregate exposing the coarser particles of fine 
aggregate as well as the coarse aggregate very near 
the surface. 

M. S. - Medium Scaling - scaling off of fine aggregate 

exposing the coarse aggregate, 

H.S, - Heavy Scaling - scaling off of layers of fine aggre¬ 
gate exposing the coarse aggregate to a quarter of 
its thickness.

Test Results 

A series of photographs were taken of six of the slabs of 
Set 2 and of the four slabs of Set 3 as the scaling tests progressed. 
See Figures 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37 and 38. They give a clear idea 
of how the scaling progressed under the cycles of freezing and thawing. 
Slab scaling test results are given in Tables 2k to 28.

Discussion of results 

Results from the scaling tests show clearly an increased 
resistance of concrete to scaling due to entrained air. This resistance 
increases with increases in air contents for the range of air contents 
used in the investigation. 

Slabs with air contents ranging from 4*5$ to 7$ were found to 
have at least twice the resistance of the normal concrete. The pozzolith 
mixes with air contents of around 2 % were found to have little or no in¬ 
crease in resistance to scaling as compared to the normal mix. This could 
be due to the fact that only small amounts of air are entrained by pozz¬ 
olith, Another possibility is that the calcium chloride which is added 
to pozzolith as an accelerator exerts a detrimental effect on the dur¬ 
ability of the concrete. This possibility is discussed further under 
freeze-thaw test results. Mixes having air contents of 2 $ to 4? were 
found to have approximately 50$ to 100 % more resistance to scaling than 
normal concrete. 

Two types of scaling were found to occur. One in which the 
mortar slowly scales away gradually exposing the coarse aggregate. This 
type of scaling generally occurred on air-entrained slabs. On slabs of 
Set 2 and Set 3 this type of scaling progressed rapidly until the slabs 
were 100$ medium scaled. After this stage was reached scaling cycles were 
found to have very little effect on the surface. This occurred only with 
the slabs having air entrained by Darex and Ayr-Trap. The second type of 
scaling is the case where the whole top layer of the slab, to a depth of 
•|- n to , loosens and scales away in large pieces. As much as 70$ heavy 
scaling can occur this way after a scaling cycle. This type of scaling 
was very evident with the normal slabs. Three out of four of the pozz- 












olith slabs also scaled in this manner. A few other air-entrained slabs 
also scaled tJ^ls way but an increased resistance to scaling was still 
evident. The top layer of the slab tended to heave and break the bond 
with the rest of the slab. This bond failure occurred as a rule inhere 
the first concentration or layer of coarse aggregate existed. This 
heaving of the top layer is probably due to the alternate freezing and 
thawing which takes place only in the top layer of the slab. The air- 
entrained slabs, because they are less permeable and also because they 
contain these tiny entrained air bubbles, are more capable of absorbing 
the stresses and strains caused by the scaling cycles. 

The first type of scaling proceded on the slabs made with 
Elk Island sand. The change in sand had no noticable effect on the re¬ 
sistance of the normal concrete to scaling. However, the 6p Darex mix 
slab is holding up well and much longer than any similar mix using washed 
Doncaster sand. The tests are too limited, however, to show any pro¬ 
nounced effect of sand type on the resistance of concrete to scaling. 

In several cases scaling was found to start in the form of 
popouts over coarse aggregate. This seems to be caused by the expansion 
of the free, water in the concrete on freezing, which breaks the bond 
between the surface paste and the coarse aggregate. This occurs only 
where the coarse aggregate is very close to the surface. 

On comparing these scaling tests with those conducted by the 
Portland Cement Association Cj ' L0 , our slabs were found to have scaled

that the Portland Cement Association carried out the scaling tests on a

CHAPTER VII 


FREEZING AND THAWING TESTS 


Testing Procedure 

The specimens, 3i; u x 4lf !t x 16 H beams, were subjected to re¬ 
versals in temperature from 55° F to 5° F. Eleven cycles were completed 
every 24 hours. The first series of beams were put in the freeze-thaw 
unit at an age of 28 days. This practice could not be continued for 
later sets of beams because of the large number of cycles required to 
break down some of the beams. The modulus of elasticity of the concrete 
vtfas determined dynamically (Sonic test) just prior to the freezing and 
thawing test. The values obtained are given in Table 29. Other values 
of the modulus of elasticity ?/ere obtained after every 11 cycles of test¬ 
ing except on weekend's when 23 cycles elapsed before another set of 
readings were taken. 

The durability factors (DFE) of all beams tested are given in 

Table 30. 

A review of literature on previous investigations dealing with 
air-entrained concrete failed to disclose a durability factor which takes 
into account the loss in weight of beams undergoing cycles of freezing 
and thawing. In an effort to correlate the effect of air entrainment on 
loss in weight due to cycles of freezing and thawing a durability factor 
(DM) based on the loss in weight is used. It is calculated by use of 
the following formula: 

DFW = KX 
I 

where DM = durability factor in percent of the original 
weight of beam at 0 cycles. 

R = percent of original weight of 90 percent or 
greater

A more rigorous evaluation would have to take into account the 
actual area under the curves obtained by plotting % original weight vs. 
cycles of freezing and thawing.

Test Results 


The influence of the various admixtures on the resistance of 
concrete to rapid freezing and thawing is summarized in Tables 30 and 
31, in terms of durability factors. A series of pictures were taken of 
the beams in order to show the effect of c 3 ’ - cles of freeze-thaw on the 
various concrete mixes. (See Figures 39 to 48). The history of the 
decrease in Dynamic E and of the decrease in weight of the specimens 
is shown in Figures 49 to 56.

Discussion of Results 

The history of the decrease in dynamic modulus of elasticity 
and of the decrease in weight of the specimens is shown in Figures 49 to 
56. The beneficial effect of air entrainment is very evident. This 
beneficial effect increases with the air content for the range of air 
contents used in the investigation. 

One percent entrained air increased the durability of concrete 
as indicated by the durability factor DFE by some 2000 percent. Entrained 
air contents of from 4 to 5 percent gave increases ranging from 12,000 
to 20,000 percent. These remarkable increases are possible because of 
the fact that the normal mix had a very low durability factor. This low 
durability factor is probably due to the coarse aggregate. This- is 
suggested by a comparison of results with those of an investigation 
carried out by Gharles E. Wurpel^*. It is also evident from Wurpel 1 s 
work that the coarse aggregate is the controlling influence on the dur¬ 
ability of concrete mixes as evaluated by the modulus of elasticity. 

Air entrainment seems capable of equalizing the relative durability of 
mixes containing highly durable aggregate and mixes containing non-durable 
aggregate. 

The durability factor (DFW) seems capable of evaluating the 
effect of fine aggregate on the durability of concrete subjected to cycles 
of freezing and thawing. The fine aggregate would have a controlling in¬ 
fluence on losses in weight due to the freeze-thaw action. Test results 
indicate the loss in weight due to cycles of freeze thaw to be directly 
related to the air content, the loss in weight decreasing with increases 
in'air content. Entrained air contents of one percent were found to give

increases in durability of from 100 percent to 400 percent. Entrained 
air contents of from 4 to 5 percent gave increases of from 900 percent 
to 1500 percent. No appreciable difference in durability due to type 
of fine aggregate used was evident. The normal mix using Elk Island 
sand being some 25 to 50 percent more durable than the mixes containing 
Doncaster washed sand. However, the entrained air mixes using Elk 
Island sand are not as durable as the entrained air mixes using Doncaster 
washed sand. In evaluating results it becomes evident that a standard 
procedure for casting the specimens is required. The amount of surface 
finishing and spading probably having an appreciable effect on the losses 
in weight due to freeze-thaw cycles. All- specimens cast for the inves¬ 
tigation were rodded and spaded under a standardized procedure. 

A comparison of mixes PI and A31 of Pour 2 indicates the effect 
the admixture itself can have on the durability of concrete. Both mixes 
have air contents of 2 percent. The durability factor DEE' indicates com¬ 
parable durability with regard to loss in modulus of elasticity. However 
the durability factor D Fif indicates the A31 mix to be some 350 percent 
more durable with regard to loss in weight. A possible explanation is 
that the calcium chloride added to the pozzolith as an accelerator causes 
the more rapid loss in weight. 

An interruption of a few days in the accelerated freeze-thaw 
process was found to allow the concrete to recover varying percentages of 
the modulus of elasticity. The percentage recovered varied from mix to 
mix and is probably dependent on such variables as time of recovery, age 
of specimen, air content, strength, and reduction in modulus of elasticity 
before recovery period. This recovery between cycles of freeze-thaw could 
definitely be a factor in correlating the laboratory results with field 
service results.

CHAPTER VIII 

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 


Summ ary 

An evaluation of air-entrained concrete was made based on 
the effect of air entrainment on the properties of plastic concrete 
mixtures and the durability and strength of hardened concrete. The 
durability of the concrete was evaluated by determining its resistance 
to scaling action and cycles of freezing and thawing. The effect of 
the entrained air on the strength of concrete was determined by cylinder 
compression tests and beam flexural tests. 

Con clusions 

1. An appreciable increase in workability was noted in the air- 
entrained mixes as compared to the normal mix at equal slump 
and flow. This increase in workability was noted in the 
absence of segregation, the reduced bleeding of poured cylin¬ 
ders, and the increase in rodability and finish ability of the 
air-entrained mixes. The air-entrained mixes proved to be 
considerably more cohesive and plastic than the normal mix, 

2. In all but a few causes the air entraining admixtures added had 

a beneficial effect on the compressive strength of the concrete. 
This beneficial effect decreased with age being practically zero 
at an age of 3 months. The admixtures used were found to have 
little or no detrimental effect on the flexural strength of the 
concrete. 

3. An appreciable increase in resistance to scaling caused by 
using calcium chloride for ice removal was noted in the air- 
entrained mixes. This resistance increased with increases in 
air contents. Air contents of ij. to 6 per cent were found to

increase the resistance to scaling from 200 to 300 per cent, 
Pozzolith added in quantities suggested by the manufacturer 
had little or no beneficial effect on the resistance of the 
concrete to scaling* 

U. Air entrainment increased the durability of concrete to a 
remarkable extent. The effects of cycles of freezing and 
thawing on concrete beams was evaluated by durability factors 
dependent on relative losses in the modulus of elasticity of 
the concrete and losses in weight of the concrete beams. 
Entrained air contents of U to 5 per cent increased the 
resistance of the concrete to loss in weight by some 900 to 
1500 per cent and its resistance to losses in modulus of 
elasticity by some 12000 to 20000 per cent.
