A STUDY OF PARENTAL LINES AND BULK PROGENIES 


FROM SINGLE AND COMPOUND CROSSES IN 
WHEAT AND BARLEY 


Douglas K. Taylor 


INTRODUCTION 


With hybridization playing a major role in the 
production of new cereal varieties, it has become important 
to know more about the behavior of hybrid populations. The 
plant breeder has found that certain crosses yield a higher 
proportion of desirable segregates than others. It would 
therefore be valuable to him to be able to predict for any 
cross the probability of obtaining a high proportion of 
desirable segregates. 

An approach to this subject has been made by a few 
workers (11, 12, 13, 14) who have studied the yielding ability 
of hybrid material in early generations. Their results 
suggest that yield tests of bulk populations in the F^ and F^ 
generations might be used as a basis for discarding crosses 
which eventually will give a low percentage of high-yielding 
segregates. With the increased use of the bulk method of 
handling hybrid material, where selection is delayed until a 
late generation, the ability to discard the poorer crosses 
in an early generation would be a valuable aid to the plant

breeder. 

That certain varieties have a higher combining 
value than others is a fact now established. Some varieties 
are good parents as judged by their ability to transmit high 
yield and quality to their progeny. Much has been done 
along this line in the production of hybrid corn. Similarly, 
it would be of great value to the cereal plant breeder to 
know which of his parental varieties consistently transmit 
high-yielding ability to their offspring. 

The phenomenon of hybrid vigor complicates any 
study of bulk populations in early generations, and its 
expression in crosses is found in varying degrees of inten¬ 
sity. It is generally accepted that hybrid vigor can be 
accurately measured by a study of the yields of the hybrid 
population in comparison with the parents. Knowledge of the 
amount of heterosis to be expected is important in the study 
of the yields of early generation hybrids. 

It was hoped that the- present study would show the 
behavior of hybrid material in the F 2 and F^ generations, 
particularly in comparison with the parents. Many of the 
hybrids were multiple crosses and the results of these com¬ 
pound matings were of special interest. It was thought 
that this study might give a preliminary evaluation of the 
various crosses as a source of future superior selections. 
Finally it was hoped that some information could be gained 
in regard to the combining ability of the parents, since such 
knowledge would be an important contribution to the planning 
of future crossing programs.

LITERATURE REVIEW 


The phenomenon of hybrid vigor has long been recog¬ 
nized. In cereal crosses, heterosis manifests itself in 
many ways, but since this study has been confined to days to 
head, days to mature, height of plant, yield of grain, weight 
per bushel, and protein percentage, the literature review has 
also been confined to these factors. 

East (4) points out that yield is the result of 
the operation of the plant as a whole and is therefore con¬ 
sidered a reliable estimate of the amount of heterosis. 
Engledow and Pal (7) and Rosenquist (17) with wheat, Coffman 
and Wiebe (3) with oats, and Immer (14) with barley have all 
shown that F^ hybrids on the average give higher yields than 
the parental average. Unpublished data by Jenkins (15) show 
that wheat crosses in a replicated yield test of spaced Fi 
plants in the field gave on the average a 14 per cent increase 
over the parental average. However, the F^ generation is 
rather unsatisfactory for yield determinations, owing to the 
cost of producing enough hybrid seed for an adequate test 
and because the results can usually be expressed only in 
terms of plant yield. 

Yield tests of F g , F 3 , and F4 populations are more 
satisfactory, and several workers have attempted to determine 
the residual hybrid vigor exhibited by these generations.

found that Fg populations outyielded the average of the 
parental varieties in three out of four oat crosses studied. 

In 1940, Harrington (13), using replicated half- 
rod-row yield trials of ten unselected Fg wheat hybrid bulk 
populations, reported that all but two yielded significantly 
more than the mean of the parental varieties. In six F^ 
crosses only one, Reward x Hope, yielded significantly more 
than the parental average, and the two crosses involving 
Quality yielded significantly less. Replicated plot tests 
of purified F 6 , F 7 , and F Q lines selected for high yield and 
agronomic characteristics showed the Reward x Hope combina¬ 
tion to be particularly valuable. On the other hand, selected 
lines from the two Quality crosses were definitely unpromis¬ 
ing. Harrington suggest therefore that bulk Fg yield trials 
may be used to indicate the potential yield possibilities of 
a cross. 

Harlan et al (11) carried 379 barley crosses 
separately in unselected bulk populations for seven years 
and recorded the yields of single ten-foot rows. Yields of 
pedigree crosses before selection gave a sound indication of 
the crosses from which high-yielding segregates might be 
expected. Low-yielding crosses could have been discarded 
without loss on the basis of their preselection yields. 

Immer (14), with six barley crosses, compared the 
yields of unselected bulk hybrids with the parents in the 
Fg, F 3 , and F 4 generations. The average yield of the six 
crosses in the Fg and F 3 for an average of two years exceeded

the mean of the parents by 24 and 13 per cent, respectively. 
The F 4 showed an average increase of five per cent over the 
parental average as the result of one year’s test. This 
represented a decrease in hybrid vigor with the increasing 
homozygosity of the successive generations. Although unsup¬ 
ported by any data on yield results of selections of these 
crosses, Immer suggests that yield trials in early genera¬ 
tions may be used for discarding certain crosses, since the 
proportion of high-yielding genotypes in low-yielding crosses 
will be less than in crosses with a higher average yield. 

Harlan et al (11) have established that certain 
varieties are more valuable as parents and produce an unusually 
high percentage of superior selections in their offspring, 
while other varieties give very few high-yielding segregates. 
Some varieties that had not been sufficiently promising in 
nursery tests to be grown in plots were found to be superior 
parents. 

As early as 1919, East and Jones ( 6 ) stated that 
earliness often accompanies hybrid vigor. Thompson (19) in 
1921, after a study of F 2 and Fg wheat hybrid populations, 
found that most Fg families fell between the parents in 
maturity although families earlier than the parents were 
obtained. Florell ( 8 ) found a fairly good 3:1 ratio of early 
and late groups respectively when studying the Fg generation 
of wheat hybrids. Clark (1) and later Clark and Hooker (2) 
found earliness to be dominant or partially dominant when Fg 
and Fg generations were compared with the parents in date of

heading. 

Plant height has often been used as a criterion of 
hybrid vigor. Sax (18) found the average height of F^ wheat 
hybrids to be 8 cm. greater than the average of the parents. 
Griffee (10) reported both an increase and a decrease in 
height in the F^ generation. Of 11 crosses, six showed an 
increase and five a decrease when compared with the parental 
average. Rosenquist (17) found that of 26 F^ wheat crosses 
seven were intermediate and 19 exceeded the tall parent. 
Heights of Fg and F 3 hybrid populations of wheat were shown 
by Clark and Hooker (2) to be intermediate between the 
heights of parents, but on the average to exceed the parental 
mean. 

Clark and Hooker (2) found that crude protein was 
inherited in intermediate degrees between wheat parents, 
through multiple factors. The protein content of grain from 
F 2 plants was found to be intermediate between that of the 
parents, and not significantly more variable. A very low 
correlation existed between F 2 and Fg lines.

METHODS 


During the past few years the cereal breeding pro¬ 
gram of the Department of Field Crops at the University of 
Alberta has included the production of many wheat and barley 
crosses. Not only were single crosses produced but also 
hybrids involving three, four, five, six, and eight varieties. 
These multiple crosses in subsequent discussion will be 
referred to as follows: triple, double, five-variety, six- 
variety, and eight-variety crosses. The following table 
gives the construction of the various multiple combinations, 
using letters for variety names:

The male and female parents were reversed in some of the

crossing. All crosses were made using F]_ plants or parental 
varieties.

In order to study these hybrid populations, the 
crosses were arranged in three main groups: early wheat 
hybrids, soft wheat hybrids, and barley hybrids. 

The parents involved in the early hard wheat breed¬ 
ing program included five of the earliest maturing varieties 
and strains available, four standard high-yielding varieties, 
and two unnamed hybrid lines. The pedigrees of these 
varieties are given in Table II. Many of the single crosses 
include one early variety and one relatively late high-yield¬ 
ing variety, and these in turn were used to produce the 
multiple combinations. It was hoped that some of these 
single and multiple crosses would be the source of relatively 
early-maturing, high-yielding segregates. 

At the same time as the multiple crosses were being 
increased in the greenhouse, a preliminary yield test was 
conducted with the F]_ plants. One standard variety, Canus, 
and 24 F^ hybrids were planted in pots with six replicates in 
an incomplete randomized bloch arrangement (9). Five plants 
were grown in each eight-inch pot and these were considered 
to represent a plot. Notes were obtained on date of heading, 
date of maturity, plant height, and yield per plant. During 
the past summer a replicated yield test was arranged in the 
field, involving a comparison of 52 unselected bulk early 
wheat hybrids and 11 parental varieties. The hybrids included 
seven groups of crosses as follows: in the F 2 generation, 14 
single, 7 triple, 15 double, 2 five-variety, 4 six-variety, 
and 1 eight-variety; and in the F^ generation, 9 single crosses.

The crosses made in an attempt to produce an early 
soft wheat involved only six parents. These included three 
soft white spring wheats (Dicklow, Onas, and Pacific Blue- 
stem) and three hard red early spring wheats (Master, Prelude, 
and 482B) (Table II). The parents were included with 28 Fg 
unselected bulk populations in a field yield test. The 
hybrids included ten single, eight triple, and ten double 
crosses. 

Twelve parental varieties (Table III) differing 
widely in origin and in agronomic characteristics were used 
to produce the barley hybrids. The latter included nine 
single, three triple, six double, two five-variety, and four 
six-variety crosses. The 24 unselected Fg bulk hybrids were 
included with the twelve parental varieties in a field yield 
test. 

All field experiments were of the square lattice 
design. To obtain the exact number of varieties required by 
this design in the wheat tests it was found necessary to 
include "filler" varieties, results from which were included 
in the analysis but have not been reported in this paper. Six 
replicates were used in the early wheat test, but only four 
in the soft wheat and barley tests. Split-replicates helped 
to make each replicate a compact and uniform unit. Single- 
row, ten-foot plots were used with the rows one foot apart. 
Pathways between the banks were four feet wide. Border 
effect at the ends of the rows was reduced to a minimum by 
the use of winter rye, planted in a continuous row along the

pathway at right angles and approximately six inches from the 
ends of the plot rows. The seed was planted with a "V^-belt 
seeder at the rate of 120 seeds per ten-foot row. 

Field notes included date of first head, full head, 
and maturity, and plant height. Heading and maturity notes 
could not be obtained on the barley hybrids owing to severe 
lodging at heading time, and for the same reason date of 
maturity was omitted in the soft wheat test. 

At maturity the plants were pulled, each row was 
wrapped in a cotton wrapper, tied, and the butt chopped off. 
Pulling and wrapping helped to avoid mixing and loss of seed. 
The sheaves were threshed in a small rod-row thresher and 
the yields recorded. The replicates of each variety or 
hybrid were bulked and passed through a Boerner sampler. 
Weight per bushel was obtained and a small sample taken for 
a protein determination.

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 


Greenhouse 


F^ multiple cross test 

A summary of the results from the early wheat F^_ 
multiple cross study in the greenhouse is given in Table IV. 
Analyses of variance indicate significant differences in all 
the characters studied (Table V). These included yield in 
grams per plant, days to head, days to maturity, and height 
in inches* Except in the case of Canus a comparison of the 
F-j_ bulk hybrids with their parents was not possible. A com¬ 
parison of the relative yielding ability of the various 
multiple crosses was, however, possible. In the results 
shown in Table IV, the crosses are arranged in descending 
order of yield within groups. It is quite evident that 
within each group the Reward combinations have a tendency to 
be low yielding. It would seem that although Reward may be 
valuable for its earliness, its presence in multiple combina¬ 
tions has deleterious effects on the yield of F^ plants* 
Reward may not be a suitable early parent to include in mul¬ 
tiple crosses where high-yielding segregates are desired. 

The greenhouse test gave a fair indication of what 
might be expected of the F 2 multiple crosses in the field. 
There was a significant positive correlation between the Fj_ 
greenhouse yields and the Fg field yields, while the correla-

Heterosis in single and multiple hybrid populations 

Yield 

In the early wheat hybrid yield test, the F^ 
bulk hybrids gave a wide range in yield varying from 
48.0 to 74.1 bushels per acre (Table XII). All the 43 
F 2 hybrid populations displayed hybrid vigor for yield 
exceeding the parental average in both the single and 
multiple crosses. Increases varying from 1.1 to 14.7 
bushels per acre represented an increase of from 2 to 
30 per cent over the mean of the parents. Single crosses 
gave the highest average percentage increase, whereas 
the triple crosses had a lower mean increase than 
either single or double crosses. The triple crosses, 
however, contained a higher percentage of high-yielding 
parents, as is indicated by a high mean parental average 
and, therefore, it would be hardly logical to expect as 
great an increase over a high parental mean as when two 
lower yielding parents are involved. 

Of the 28 Fg bulk hybrids in the soft wheat 
hybrid yield test, all but one, namely Pacific Bluestem 
x Dicklow, yielded more than the parental average. 

Results in Table XIII show mean yields of 72.7 and 58.3 
bushels per acre for the bulk hybrids and parental ave¬ 
rages respectively. The F 2 bulk hybrids show an average 
increase of 14.4 bushels per acre over the parental 
average. Mean yields of single, triple, and double

crosses exceed the parental average by 19, 24, and 34 
per cent respectively. The multiple crosses displayed 
further increases in vigor over the Fg yields of the 
crosses used in their parentage. Many of the double 
combinations, whose parentage included two high-yielding 
soft wheats and two early low-yielding hard wheats, gave 
results quite comparable to single combinations involv¬ 
ing two relatively high-yielding soft wheat parents. 

In the barley hybrid yield test the Fg popu¬ 
lation yields ranged from 75.6 to 126.4 bushels per 
acre. The results in Table XIV show the F g hybrid 
yields varying from 10,2 bushels per acre below, to 
37.1 bushels per acre above the parental average, with 
a mean increase of 15.7 bushels per acre. Only three 
out of the 24 Fg crosses failed to exceed the parental 
average, and none of these yielded significantly less. 
Eleven of the remaining 21 crosses gave significant 
increases over the mean of the parents. The triple and 
five-variety crosses showed exceptional hybrid vigor 
and this may perhaps be a good method of intensifying 
the qualities of the single parent while still retaining 
the advantages of multiple crosses. Owing to severe 
lodging at the time of heading, the barley test was not 
as accurate as the wheat hybrid yield tests. It is 
quite possible that some of the strong-strawed varieties 
or hybrids had an advantage, and perhaps the yields of 
some were reduced owing to second growth. A minimum

significant difference of 15.7 bushels per acre was 
required between varieties, indicating a high variability 
between plots. Nevertheless, the range in yields was 
sufficient to give significant differences between hy¬ 
brids or between hybrids and parents. 

Heterosis for yield was general in all three 
field tests. Although increases of the Fg hybrids over 
the mean of the parents were not statistically signifi¬ 
cant in all cases, the fact that only four out of 95 
crosses yielded below the average of the parents, and 
only one of these significantly less, makes it possible 
to conclude that such increases in yield may be expected 
in the early generations of wheat and barley hybrids. 

If such increases in yield are a part of hybrid 
vigor in the Fg, the question arises as to how much of 
this hybrid vigor for yield is maintained in the F 3 
generation. Immer (14) with barley hybrids and Harring¬ 
ton (13) with wheat hybrids have both shown a decrease 
in the F 3 yields as compared with the Fg. In the early 
wheat bulk hybrid test nine crosses were present in 
both the Fg and F^ generations. Results in Table XV 
show that all the F 3 crosses yielded significantly 
lower than the corresponding crosses in the Fg genera¬ 
tion. The decreases in yield ranged from 6.3 to 20.5 
bushels per acre and are striking and consistent through¬ 
out. The average reduction in yield was 13.1 bushels 
per acre, representing a loss in yield vigor of 21 per 
cent.

Eight out of nine Fg hybrids yielded less 
than the parental average. Expressed in per cent of 
the parental average the Fg and Fg yields would be 116 
per cent and 92 per cent respectively. The results in 
Table XV also show that the crosses with the greatest 
amount of hybrid vigor for yield in the Fg were the ones 
with the greatest reduction in yield in the Fg. This 
would be an important consideration if Fg yields were 
to be used in the evaluation of hybrid material for 
selection purposes.

A close relationship exists between the hy¬ 
brid yields and their parental averages* Innner (14) 
in a study of barley yields found that the highest 
yielding !F;l hybrids came from the parents which had the 
highest average yields. A highly significant correla¬ 
tion coefficient of *838 was obtained between the early 
wheat bulk hybrid yields and their parental averages. 

The correlation surface in Figure 1 shows the distribu¬ 
tion of the single and multiple crosses. The single 
crosses cover a slightly wider range than the multiple 
combinations. In the single crosses alone even higher 
correlation coefficients of .886 and .956 exist between 
bulk hybrid yields and the parental averages for the Fg 
and F 3 respectively (Figure 2). The slopes of the 
regression lines for the Fg and Fg points are signifi¬ 
cantly different to the 5 per cent point. The higher 
regression coefficient of the Fg crosses indicates that 
crosses with low parental averages have had greater 
reductions in yield in the Fg generation than crosses 
with high parental averages. 

A significant correlation was obtained for 
the soft wheat bulk hybrids and their parental averages 
but it was not as high as the correlation found in the 
early wheat test. The single crosses again covered a 
wide range as shown in Figure 3, but the correlation 
surface for the multiple crosses was inclined to be 
restricted to the central portion of the scatter diagram.

Since the regression coefficient for the soft wheat test 
was much lower than that for the early wheat, similar 
increases in mean parental yield did not result in as 
great increases in bulk hybrid yield* 

In the barley tests the relation between the 
Fg yields and the parental average was not so close as 
in the wheat tests. The points on the correlation sur¬ 
face shown in Figure 4 are very scattered, and although 
positive correlation coefficients were obtained they 
were not significant* The scattered arrangement of the 
points may be due partially to the large experimental

Earliness 


Many workers have shown F^ hybrids to be 
earlier in heading and maturity than plants of the 
parental strains. As mentioned previously Florell (8), 
and Clark and Hooker (2) found that earliness was 
dominant in the Fg and Fg generations. In the wheat 
tests the majority of the Fg hybrid populations reached 
first head, full head, and maturity before the parental 
average. Only four out of forty-three early wheat Fg 
hybrids were in full head after the mean of the parents 
and only nine were later in maturity. The Fg crosses 
were on the average later maturing than similar Fg 
crosses, while six out of nine F 3 hybrids came into full 
head and maturity later than the parental average. 

In most of the single crosses segregates 
appeared which headed as early as the earlier parent. 

Some of the multiple combinations gave segregates which 
were as early as the earliest parent but since the mul¬ 
tiple combinations often had a higher proportion of late- 
yielding varieties in their parentage than the single 
crosses, it was not unexpected when many failed to give 
segregates as early as the earliest variety in their 
parentage. Results in Table XVI show the mean growth 
period for the different types of crosses as compared 
with the mean of the parental averages. Differences in 
days to first head indicate that the multiple crosses

showed greater deviations from the parental mean than 
did the single crosses. This is evidence of the wide 
segregation that may be characteristic of multiple 
combinations. 

Soft wheat multiple combinations also showed 
greater deviations from the parental mean than did 
single crosses. Results in Table XVTI show that the 
average date of heading of the first segregate of the 
double crosses is 4.2 days earlier than the parental 
average as compared with 2.7 days for the single crosses. 
It would seem that double crosses should be a good 
source of early and perhaps high-yielding segregates. 

A very high positive correlation coefficient 
of .991 was obtained between days to full head and days 
to maturity. This indicates that date of heading is an 
accurate estimate of earliness and, as it can often be 
more conveniently secured than the date of maturity, the 
use of heading notes is a valuable estimate of the growth 
period required by any variety or hybrid. A lower cor¬ 
relation coefficient of .896 between days to first head 
and days to maturity indicates the possibility that 
certain crosses will yield a few very early-maturing 
segregates. 

Highly significant positive correlation coef¬ 
ficients were obtained between yield and days to maturity 
.832 for the 11 parents and .720 for the 43 Fg hybrid 
populations. The higher yielding crosses are usually

later maturing. However, the correlation is low enough 
to allow hybrids of equal growth periods to be signifi¬ 
cantly different in yield. If the hybrids are classi¬ 
fied into groups of equal maturity, crosses may be 
selected with good yield potentialities as well as with 
certain early maturity prospects.

Height 

Increases in plant height in the F^ wheat 
hybrids have been reported by Sax (18), G-riffee (10), 
and Rosenquist (17). Results from the wheat tests show 
that hybrid vigor in the Fg and F 3 generations is also 
accompanied by increases in plant height over the 
parental average. The results in Table XVIII give a 
comparison of the Fg and F 5 single early wheat crosses

with the parental average. All the F g bulk hybrids 
exceeded the parental average, the average increase 
being 1.8 inches. The F^ hybrids were also usually 
taller than the mean of the parents and at the same 
time averaged one inch shorter than the corresponding 
Fg hybrids. 

Greater and more consistent increases over 
the parental average were found for the soft wheat 
hybrids (Table XIX). Without exception the Fg hybrids 
were taller than the parental average. Mean increases 
for single, triple, and double crosses were 2.6, 2.3, 
and 3.4 inches respectively. 

Although the significant positive correlation 
coefficient of .860 indicates a close relation between 
the height of the early wheat parental varieties and 
their yield, corresponding correlation coefficients for 
the hybrids were positive but not significant. This is 
perhaps due to the small range in height of the hybrids 
as compared with the relatively greater range in yield. 

Weight per bushel 

The parents and the hybrids of the early wheat 
test did not differ greatly in weight per bushel. The 
Fg hybrids gave on the average only very small increases 
over the parental average. Differences between the Fg 
and F 3 hybrids were not significant.

In the soft wheat hybrid yield test with 
greater differences existing between the parents, more 
variation occurs in the weight per bushel of the hybrids 
All 28 Fg crosses showed increases in weight per bushel 
over the mean of the parents. Mean increases for the 
single, triple, and double crosses were 0.9, 1.0, and 
1.6 pounds per bushel respectively. Prelude was espe¬ 
cially high in weight per bushel and all crosses 
including Prelude also showed a comparatively high 
weight per bushel. 

Out of 24 Fg barley crosses 18 showed an in¬ 
crease in weight per bushel over the parental average. 
Despite the fact that the majority of the crosses showed 
increases, however, varietal response was not consistent 
throughout. 

Protein content 

The early and soft wheat bulk hybrids gave 
protein percentages that were intermediate between the 
parents or were very close to the parental averages. 

The barley hybrid populations had a slight tendency to 
be lower in protein content than the mean of the parents 
Twenty-four Fg barley hybrids showed a mean reduction 
from the parental average of 0.4 per cent. 

A few of the F^ early wheat hybrids shown in 
Table XX had a reduced protein percentage as compared

with corresponding F 2 hybrids. As shown by Neatby and 
McCalla (16) a negative correlation exists between yield 
and protein. Correlation coefficients for the Fg early 
wheat, soft wheat, and barley hybrids were -.567, -.478, 
and -.406 respectively. If the yield-protein relation¬ 
ship were to be maintained, it would be natural to 
expect an increase in protein percentage with the marked 
reduction in yield as found in the Fg. This is not the 
case, however, and there seems to be a tendency for the 
Fg hybrids to have a lower percentage than the preceding 
generation. With environmental influences as constant 
as possible for all the hybrids, it might be concluded 
that this decrease in protein percentage may be due to

the segregation of the multiple genetic factors which 
determine the relative protein content of each variety. 

The correlation surface for protein content 
and yield of the parental lines and bulk progenies of 
the early wheat test is presented in Figure 5. Owing 
to hybrid vigor for yield, the regression line of the 
Fg bulk hybrids is much higher on the correlation sur¬ 
face than the regression line of the parents or the F^ 
hybrid populations. The parental variety, H-29-35, with 
a low protein content of 13.1 per cent made a large con¬ 
tribution to the steep slope of the parental regression 
line. All parental varieties do not contribute equally 
to the hybrids and this may account for the difference 
in slope of the regression lines of the parental and 
hybrid populations. 

The results in Figure 6 show the relationship 
of protein and yield in the F 2 soft wheat bulk hybrids 
as compared with the parents. Although the regression 
coefficient for the parents is higher than in the early 
wheat test, the F 2 hybrid populations give a lower 
regression coefficient. The very high correlation 
coefficient of -.983 between protein and yield, obtained 
for the parents, may be somewhat misleading. The high 
correlation value is due to the small number of points 
in the population and to the grouping of the three soft 
wheat parents at one extreme and of the three early 
parents at the other.

The results for the barley bulk hybrids and

Genetic relation and heterosis 

Many studies have indicated that hybrid vigor is 
dependent on genetic differences in the parents. East and 
Hayes (5) and later East (4) showed that the amount of heter¬ 
osis in an F^ plant is roughly proportional to the genic 
differentiation of the two parental stocks. Harrington (12) 
with Fg wheat hybrids found that the amount of heterosis was 
dependent on the genetic differences of the parental varieties. 

In the early wheat test a comparison of the yield¬ 
ing ability of single crosses with both closely and distantly 
related parents is possible. The single early wheat crosses 
are arranged in Table XXI, in order of the estimated close¬ 
ness of their parental genetic relationship. In the first 
cross, the parents, Canus and Thatcher, are very closely 
related whereas the parental varieties in the succeeding 
crosses are pregressively more distantly related. The last 
three crosses have parents which are related only very dis¬ 
tantly if at all. It would appear that the first three 
crosses, each with closely related parents, have shown less 
heterosis for yield as compared with crosses with more dis¬ 
tantly related parents. With the exception of H-37-30 x 
482B, however, the first three crosses have the highest 
average parental yield. Perhaps it is not reasonable to 
expect as great an increase over a high parental average as 
when two low-yielding parents are involved. By comparing 
crosses with equal parental averages it can be seen that

H-37-30 x 482B with unrelated parents shows more hybrid vigor 
than H-37-30 x Reward or Canus x Thatcher, both of which have 
closely related parents. No other comparisons show appre¬ 
ciable differences in hybrid vigor. 

In the barley hybrids, very few of the varieties 
used as parents are related. In Table XXII, however, two 
crosses in particular have closely related parents, namely 
Titan x Trebi and Newal x O.A.C. 21, Trebi is a parent of 
Titan and O.A.C. 21 is a parent of Newal. These two closely 
related crosses showed the greatest increases in hybrid vigor 
of all the single crosses. The suggestions of East (4) and 
of Harrington (12) are not, therefore, supported by these 
results.

Combining ability of the parents 

As stated in the introduction it was hoped that 
these yield tests with hybrids might give some information as 
to the relative value of the parents for crossing purposes. 
Despite the number of crosses, only a limited number of com¬ 
parisons was possible. In the early wheat bulk hybrid test, 
the single crosses were not complete—that is, one variety 
was crossed with only four others—and in the comparison of 
any two parents there were only one or two matings in common. 
For example, in the comparison of H-37-30 and Red Bobs in 
Table XXIII, it would appear on the basis of four crosses 
that H-37-30 gave higher yielding offspring than did Red Bobs.

the soft and hard wheat varieties show the parent soft 
wheats—Dicklow, Onas, and Pacific Bluestem—to be equal as 
parents. In the barley test, however, the relatively small 
number of barley crosses studied made it impossible to 
evaluate the large number of parental varieties.

DISCUSSION 


Hybrid vigor for yield has been found in almost 
all the hybrid bulk populations studied in the F^ generation. 

As this study did not include an investigation of individual 
plants, it is not possible to attribute increases in yield to 
definite plant characters, Immer (14) made a detailed study 
of heterosis and reports that six Fi barley hybrids as an 
average exceeded the mean of the parents by 8.3 per cent in 
number of heads per plant, 11.1 per cent in seeds per head, 
and 4.9 per cent in weight per seed. It is quite probable 
that these three factors in varying proportions are respon¬ 
sible for the hybrid vigor in the present study. 

It has been impossible in this short study to deter¬ 
mine whether the yield of early generation bulk populations 
can be used to evaluate crosses for future selection purposes. 
If the findings of Harlan et al (11) and Harrington (12) are 
accepted, however, it would seem possible to make a preliminary 
evaluation of many of the crosses included in bulk hybrid 
yield tests. Despite the range in yields it would be hard 
to make a close estimate of the yielding potentialities of 
each cross on the basis of one Fg yield test. For prediction 
purposes a rough classification might be set up in which the 
Fg hybrids could be placed in three groups, and these would 
include promising, average, and unpromising crosses. 

If Fg bulk population yields alone are to be used 
as a basis for discarding low-yielding crosses, it seems

important to determine the amount of hybrid vigor present. 
Results in Table XV show a definite tendency for crosses 
with a large amount of hybrid vigor in the F 2 to have the 
greatest decreases in yield in the F 3 generation. The 
limited number of comparisons in this study seems to indi¬ 
cate that the amount of heterosis may be a valuable aid in 
predicting F 3 yields. Therefore, it seems worth while to 
include the parental varieties in any test of F 2 bulk hybrids 
in order that some estimation may be made of the amount of 
hybrid vigor involved in the F 2 yields. 

Owing to the fact that certain crosses show more 
reduction in yield in the F 3 than others, it would seem that 
the results of two generations would be required to give a 
good estimate of the true yield potentialities of a hybrid 
population. If the bulk hybrids were allowed to segregate 
in the F 2 and yield tests were conducted in the F 3 and F^ 
generations, a more accurate evaluation of the hybrids as a 
source of high-yielding segregates might be obtained. Yield 
tests of the F 3 and F4 would be less complicated by hybrid 
vigor and the yields obtained would represent to a greater 
degree the actual yields of the segregates themselves. If a 
bulk hybrid were high yielding in the F 3 and F4 there must 
have been a good proportion of high-yielding segregates 
making up that particular population. Another advantage of 
delaying the yield tests until the F 3 would be that it would 
give an opportunity to secure sufficient seed for a fully 
replicated yield test.

Notes on days to head or mature, strength of straw, 
height, weight per bushel, and protein percentage would be a 
valuable addition to yield data. They would be especially 
important in evaluating crosses from parents about which 
relatively little is known, or if the crosses were being 
tested in areas where the parents are not commonly grown. 

The segregation of the multiple crosses for earli¬ 
ness indicates the possibilities for wide segregation in 
other characters such as yield. A study of the hybrid vigor 
of multiple combinations in the F 3 would be worth while. It 
would give information particularly as to whether the 
decreases in yield which accompany increasing homozygosity 
in multiple crosses are as great as those found in single 
crosses. 

The pronounced heterosis shown by the soft wheat 
hybrid populations, especially the multiple combinations, 
may have been due to the distantly related parental varieties 
involved. In the early wheat crosses, with relatively 
closely related parental varieties, the amount of heterosis 
in the multiple combinations was considerably less. It 
would seem that the difference in genetic relationship would 
account for the variation in hybrid vigor. 

Limited comparisons within the early wheat test 
indicate that the above relationship still exists although 
complicated by differences in the yield levels of the parents 
The opposite tendency is shown in the single barley crosses 
where crosses with closely related parents show more hybrid

vigor than those with distantly related parents. 

Results of the present study seem to indicate that 
in general the amount of hybrid vigor is dependent upon the 
closeness of the genetic relation of the parents. In a com¬ 
parison of individual crosses within tests, however, the 
relation between genetic disparity and heterosis is not 
consistent. 

The small number of comparisons available limited 
any definite conclusions in regard to the combining ability 
of the parental varieties. If the crosses were complete— 
that is, each variety combined with each other variety—then 
averages might be worked out to show the amount of yielding 
ability each parent contributed to its resultant crosses. 
However, as far as the hybrids of the early wheat test have 
shown, the combining value of the parents may be represented 
by their relative yielding ability. In the soft wheat paren¬ 
tal comparison, no one of the soft wheat parents was consis¬ 
tently better than another. These limited results show the 
importance of having crosses complete to give adequate com¬ 
parisons for parent evaluation. 


SUMMARY 


In order to study the behavior of single and mul¬ 
tiple crosses in early generations as compared with their 
parents, replicated yield tests were conducted in the green-

house and the field. In the greenhouse, 24 hard wheat F 1 
multiple combinations were arranged in a preliminary test. 
Three separate field tests consisted of parental varieties 
with the following hybrids: 52 early hard wheat crosses; 

28 combinations of hard and soft wheats; and 24 barley 
crosses. With the exception of nine F^ early hard wheat 
crosses all the unselected bulk hybrids in the field tests 
were in the Fg generation. 

The greenhouse test gave a good indication of what 
might be expected of the multiple crosses in the F^o There 
was a significant positive correlation between the Fj_ green¬ 
house yields and the Fg field yields, while the correlation 
coefficients for days to head, days to mature, and height 
were all highly significant. 

In the field, on the average, the F 2 hybrid popula¬ 
tion exceeded the parental average in earliness, height, and 
weight per bushel. The protein content of the hybrids was 
intermediate between the two parents but was not consistently 
above or below the parental average. The F^ crosses were on 
the average slightly later in heading and maturity, shorter 
in straw, and reduced in protein content. 

Hybrid vigor for yield was found in almost all of 
the F 2 hybrids. Only four out of 95 crosses yielded below 
the average of the parents and only one of these significantly 
less. Multiple crosses on the average showed at least as 
much hybrid vigor as single crosses. In the soft wheat bulk

hybrid test, mean yields of single, triple, and double crosses 
gave average increases of 19, 24, and 34 per cent respectively 
over the parental average, showing maximum increases in yield 
in the double crosses. 

The Fg hybrid populations gave wide differences in 
yield. If yield tests of bulk hybrid populations in the early 
generations are used to evaluate crosses as a source of high- 
yielding segregates, then certain low-yielding crosses may 
be discarded as definitely unpromising. 

The Fjj early wheat bulk hybrids showed a mean reduc¬ 
tion in yield of 13.1 bushels per acre as compared with the 
Fg yields of the same crosses, representing a loss in vigor 
of 21 per cent. Some of the Fg hybrids showing the greatest 
increases in yield over the parental average had the greatest 
reduction in yield in the F^. For prediction purposes it 
would seem unwise to place too much confidence in the results 
from the Fg generation. 

The pronounced heterosis shown by the multiple 
crosses of hard and soft wheats may have been due to the com¬ 
bination of distantly related parents. In the early wheat 
single crosses, however, the variation in genetic relation 
of the parents alone would not account for the differences 
in hybrid vigor; and in the single barley crosses, those 
bulk hybrids with closely related parents showed the most 
hybrid vigor. 

In the wheat tests a close relationship existed 
between Fg yields and the parental average. The yields of the
