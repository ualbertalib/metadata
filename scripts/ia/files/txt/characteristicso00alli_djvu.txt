SYNOPSIS 


The study was based on the grade seven failures in 
the Edmonton Public School System for the years 1951 and 
1952. The purpose of the dissertation was to present as 
comprehensive a study of failure, with particular refer¬ 
ence to the students* scholastic progress prior to failure 
and their subsequent achievement after failure, as the data 
would allow. 

The data were provided from the records at the Edmon¬ 
ton Public School Board offices; the promotion sheets and 
the cumulative record cards. Two hundred and twenty-eight 
students failed in 1951 and 1952, but only 212 cumulative 
record cards of these students could be located. It was 
believed that the sixteen missing cards would in no way 
invalidate the study. A second group of 212 cumulative 
record cards was drawn from the files to act as a basis for 
comparison in the study with particular reference to the 
studies on intelligence, home status, fathers’ occupations 
and the teachers* ratings on the six areas of personality 
development. 

A questionnaire sent to each of the 212 of the study 
sample was invalidated since a significant number of stu¬ 
dents could not be reached by mail. 

The data gathered were classified into three main 
areas: the students* progress prior to grade seven, the

students* grade seven record, and the achievement of the 
students beyond grade seven. 

Conclusions were arrived at with respect to the data 
in each of these areas of study. Four main causes of fail¬ 
ure were indicated by a study of the data: low ability, 
poor achievement in elementary grades, poor attitude toward 
school, and poor socio-economic status. Implications with 
respect to non-promotion as a policy suggest that this 
policy creates overageness for the grade and has the ultimate 
effect of eliminating the non-achiever from school by means 
of drop-outs from the system. There would seem to be a 
need for the establishment of both special classes and 
special curricula for students of low ability if they are 
to be retained in school. 

A further implication is made that an evaluation of 
the present experimental two year, three year and four year 
plan in Division I be made and thought be given to its ex¬ 
tension to Divisions II and III. Within the plan are pos¬ 
sibilities for the elimination of some of the problems that 
are a by-product of non-promotion.

CHAPTER I 


INTRODUCTION 

Much careful and painstaking research has been made 
with respect to problems relative to promotion, school pro¬ 
gress, retardates and drop-outs. This research has influenced 
present promotional practice, but every student who fails 
poses many problems for the teacher and the administration: 

Why did he fail? What aspects of previous school achieve¬ 
ment may have led to failure? What effect did environmental 
factors have on his school progress? What effect did ability 
have with respect to failure? Should he have been a member 
of a regular class or should he have been in a special class? 
Does failure seriously affect the remainder of his educational 
career? These and many other questions are asked by thought¬ 
ful teachers and administrators. 

I. THE PROBLEM 

The purpose of this investigation is to make a thorough 
study of the student who fails by particular reference to four 
areas: 

1. Teachers* ratings. 

2. Environmental factors. 

3* Achievement and ability. 

*+. Academic record.

The purposes of this study might be more clearly ex¬ 
pressed by the following questions: 

1. What influence did the student’s health have on his 
school progress? 

2. What is the relationship between failure and the fa¬ 
ther’s occupation? 

3. What is the relationship between age at grade seven 
failure and the I.Q.? 

k. What is the relationship between age at grade seven 
failure and drop-outs from the city system? 

5. What is the relationship between age at grade seven 
failure and student achievement prior to grade seven? 

6. What is the relationship between achievement prior to 
grade seven and drop-outs from the city system? 

7• Are teachers on sound educational ground in failing 
these pupils? 

8. What are the probable chances of a grade seven failure 
completing high school? 

9. Should these failing students be retained in a regular 
classroom or should provision be made for them outside 
the regular classes? 

10. Are these failing students merely biding their time 
until they reach the legal age of fifteen so they may 
drop out of school? 

The population for this study was made up of the 212 
failures in grade seven during the years 1951 and 1952 in the

Edmonton Public School system. Grade seven was chosen as the 
focal point of the study for three main reasons: 

1. The prior educational progress of these students could 
be assessed. 

2. The post grade seven school achievements of these 
pupils could be evaluated. 

3. Grade seven is the mid-point on the educational ladder 
toward a high school diploma. 

II. BASIC ASSUMPTIONS 

The first major assumption in this study is that the 
information given on the students* cumulative record cards 
has been carefully and thoughtfully recorded. It is assumed 
that the ratings given by a teacher represent a true picture 
of the pupil*s progress as seen by the teacher. It is fur¬ 
ther assumed that the subjective markings with respect to 
emotional development were made only after thoughtful consid¬ 
eration by the teacher. 

The second major assumption is that these students 
whose records are studied were failed only after due delib¬ 
eration and for a variety of valid reasons. 

III. THE NEED FOR THE STUDY 

There have been many studies related to promotion and 
non-promotion in the school situation. It was believed, 
however, that a comprehensive and consolidated study of a

group of failures with reference to their scholastic history 
prior to failure and their subsequent scholastic record after 
failure might prove rewarding, particularly if other pertin¬ 
ent factors such as environment, health and mentality were 
also considered. 

Although an examination of the related literature 
shows considerable study has been made of this problem of 
promotion, none of these studies has been related to the com¬ 
plete scholastic life of the non-achieving child. This study 
should provide information of value with respect to failure. 
It should prompt principals and administrators to take a 
second look at failures, and should also prompt all of those 
connected directly with education to be concerned about these 
potential drop-outs. It may be that the present method of 
elimination by failure is the best solution for the problem 
of failure, or it could be that there is an alternative in 
providing something other than regular classroom instruction 
for the less academically gifted student. There is evident 
need for a careful appraisal of our promotional system, not 
only from the point of view of successes achieved but also 
from the point of view of failures. The latter position is 
the one of concern in this study.

standards that are stated in the promotional regulations of 
the Edmonton Public School Board 1 as they apply to junior 
high schools. 

Pass . A student shall have successfully completed his 
grade if he makes an average of 60 per cent in all subjects 
and a minimum of *f0 per cent in each. 

Failure . A student who does not achieve the minimum 
standard for the grade, and who, in the opinion of the 
teacher, is not ready for the next grade, is a failure. 

Recommend . A teacher may make a provisional pass, on 
the basis of a trial for a two month period in the next high¬ 
er grade. A student failing to make the minimum standard 
but who, in the opinion of the teacher, is worthy of a two 
months* trial in the next grade is given an r, R n or "Recommend 11 
standing. 


V. LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY 

The study was dependent on the accuracy and care with 
which the data on the cumulative cards were recorded. The 
large majority of the cards were filled in carefully and the 
necessary information supplied. Limitations in the study 
were due to some omissions and incompleteness in the cumula¬ 
tive record cards. 

1. The majority of the cumulative cards did indicate what

had happened to the student when he left the Edmonton 
system. On some others it was merely indicated that 
the student had "quit' 1 or "left school". A few cards 
had no notation at all as to the reason for school 
leaving. The ’’quit 11 and "left school" students were 
recorded as drop-outs. 

2. The cards that gave no reason for school leaving im¬ 
posed a second limitation on the study. It could be 
assumed that because of age and poor school progress 
the pupil dropped out of school. The Provincial 
Government grade nine files were consulted to check 
the possibility of transfer to other Alberta points 
of students whose cards had no notation as to the 
reason for school leaving at grades seven and eight, 
and during grade nine. No transfers to other Alberta 
points were discovered, so these students were re¬ 
corded as drop-outs. There still remained the 
possibility of the transfer of these students to 
points outside of Alberta.

CHAPTER II 


A SURVEY OF THE RELATED LITERATURE 

There has been a great deal of research on promotion 
and non-promotion and the allied topics of school progress, 
retardates, acceleration and drop-outs. In general the re¬ 
lated literature has three underlying conclusions: 

1. The present grade system for class grouping is most 
unsatisfactory. 

2. Social promotion, progress at the pupil*s maximum 
rate and streaming are devices used to circumvent the 
objections to the rigid grade system. 

3* Pupils must be dealt with individually. Each child 
has different rates of learning and growth from every 
other child. The duty of the school is to insure the 
maximum development of each child*s potential ability. 

I. LITERATURE ON PROMOTIONAL PRACTICE 

More recent research has attempted to determine more 
objectively the effects of non-promotion practices. Although 
there are individual exceptions, the following generaliz¬ 
ations seem warranted from the survey of the investigations. 2 

1. Retention practices do not significantly increase a 
slow rate of learning.

2. Retention practices do not make for better student 
morale. 

3. Retention practices do not assure mastery of a subject. 

k. Retention practices do not reduce the variability of 

achievement found in individual classes nor increase 
the grade achievement averages. 

5. Retention practices do not increase the personality 
adjustment of the retained pupil. 

McManus,^ in surveying pupil progress in Edmonton 
city schools, approached the problem by considering the grade 
nine pupils in two Edmonton schools and retracing their school 
progress as far as data allowed from grade one to grade nine. 
He found that while only 2.2 per cent of the sample were 
accelerated, 37*8 per cent of the sample had been retarded. 

He found, too, that grades one, two, seven, eight and nine 
accounted for 73*1 per cent of all grade failures. He also 
suggests that too few students are accelerated and too many 
are retarded. 

A 1955 report 1 ** dealing with Alberta promotional 
policies revealed the emphasis placed by Alberta teachers 
on the mastery of subject matter. The net effect of Alberta

practices, this study shows, is to produce overageness or 
retardation. It is also indicated that failure and drop-out 
rates have decreased since 1929. From an inquiry made of 
seventy-five school systems* promotion policies, it was 
found that twenty-two had definite policies that could be 
classified into three distinct types: 

1. Promotions based on achievement of definite scholastic 
or grade standards. 

2. A compromise between achievement of standards and 
development of personal social and emotional qual¬ 
ities. 

3. Regular promotions with rare exceptions. 

The report states further that there is an unmistak¬ 
able trend away from the rigid promotions of the past towards 
promotional policies that are concerned with the total growth 
of the child in the light of his individual capacities and 
needs. In Canada there is an ever increasing distrust for the 
traditional promotional policy and the recognition of the 
need for a better way of dealing with these individual dif¬ 
ferences in children through more flexible programs to meet 
their needs. 

This trend away from rigid grade lines in an attempt 
to deal with the promotional problem has received the atten¬ 
tion of several authors. Various names are applied to the 
process being used, “streaming", “continuous promotion'*, 
“progress at the pupil*s maximum rate", and so on. In

developing one approach to this problem, Shane states that: 

Teachers and administrators must start with the indiv¬ 
idual child and a consideration of his difficulties as a 
basis for promotion. Creative imagination applied to the 
promotional dilemma can do much to resolve the problem. 
The child*s total development is the consideration as to 
whether he should or should not progress as fast as his 

classmates.5 

Edwards^ goes a step further than Shane. She thinks 
that before long the term school grade will be relegated to 
the past along with the birch rod and the dunce cap. The 
present difficulty in promotion is a dichotomy of adherence 
to academic standards on the one hand and of adjusting the 
standards to the child on the other. 

II. LITERATURE ON SCHOOL PROGRESS 

Sumpton and Phillips^ in a review of school progress 
research point out that normal progress means the advancement 
of pupils from grade to grade. Normal progress is one grade 
per year, eight grades in eight years. When a pupil advances 
more slowly he is said to be retarded. Underage and overage 
are related to school progress. Thus an underage pupil is 
one who, as measured by the normal age, is too young for his

grad©, an overage pupil is one too old for his grade. Under¬ 
ageness may represent acceleration and overageness retardation, 
but such is not always the case* Many children do not enter 
school at the normal age and others may drop out for a half 
year or more after their entrance* 

Reliable research on school progress began around 1900 
with age-grade studies setting the general pattern* These 
became very popular in the second decade because of activities 
in four areas: 

1. Many superintendents included age-grade studies in 
their annual reports. 

2. The U. S. Bureau of Education became interested in 
publishing elimination and age-grade studies. 

3. The expanding school survey movement included age- 
grade studies as an important part of the survey. 

b 9 A number of graduate students adopted the area as a 
fertile field for study. 

The third decade brought a still greater number of 
studies and followed with only minor improvements the pattern 
laid down previously. The depression of the third decade 
and the consequent federally supported educational programs 
for out-of-school youth in the United States caused an inten¬ 
sified realization that schools must increase their holding 
power. Doubt about the advisability of maintaining grade 
standards greatly increased the number of studies which com¬ 
pared the development of regularly promoted children with

the development of retained children. 

A general shift in philosophy is shown by the number 
of schools using an ungraded curriculum and promotion accord¬ 
ing to some other basis such as social maturity. This change 
in practice has lessened the significance of school progress 

g 

as a field for research. 

One way of assessing a promotional policy is to find 
out the degree of overageness or retardation represented 
through the grades. Another approach is to evaluate student 
progress at a particular grade level and note the wide vari¬ 
ation in ability represented in all subject areas. In refer¬ 
ring to this latter approach, Cook^ points out that a random 
group of six year olds entering grade one has a range in 
ability of from four to eight years in mental age. As these 
children grow and develop this range is widened until by the 
age of twelve the gap has spread to eight years. Within any 
one grade the range of abilities is so great that a slow 
learner in grade eight demoted to grade four would be a slow 
learner in grade four. He points out that strict policies of 
promotion have the effect of hoarding the dull pupils. He 
favors an administration policy that provides an opportunity 
for the teacher to know the pupil and also to have material

with a range of difficulty and interest. Coupled with this 
administrative policy, he believes in regular promotions for 
slow learners. This he warns can be done, but it requires 
enthusiastic teachers, small classes and a systematic testing 
program. Cook believes that: 

Books, books and more books, together with educational 
procedures based on greater insight on how creative power 
and imagination can be released in children will do much 
to encourage, develop and stimulate all children. 10 

Dunlop * 11 in a recent Alberta study refers to the wide 
variation in ability that exists within every classroom. Be¬ 
cause of this wide range of abilities, teaching must be as 
individualized as possible. In an average grade seven class¬ 
room, the range of the reading ability extends over five 
grades, in language over 4.6 grades, in spelling six grades. 
The range of arithmetic achievement in the average grade 
eight classroom is over five grades. This study also points 
up the promotional problem that must be met by teachers and 
administrators at each term end. 

In order to deal effectively with such a situation as 

*i p 

reported above, Hellerstein refers to three problem groups 
dealt with in an experiment in Rawlings Junior High School in

Cleveland, Ohio. These three groups; outsiders, a group 
needing orientation in a large school, and a group accustomed 
to the environment of failure, were put in an Adjustment 
Group which began as an experiment and became a permanent 
class. By means of achievement and individual tests, the 
degree of retardation found was disturbing. By dealing with 
pupils on an individual basis and adjusting the curriculum 
and the reading to each child*s level, much progress was made. 
An Adjustment Group II was begun for those in the original 
group who had progressed above the grade four level but were 
not able to cope with the regular class. Adjustment Group I 
remained for those who had not progressed above the fourth 
grade level. 

Mentioned throughout the literature with respect to 
promotion are the three major types of promotional policy. 

The grade standard policy is traditional and still has many 
adherents; the second is termed **the continuous promotion 
policy** which keeps the pupil within his own age group, and 
the third called “the continuous progress policy** is con¬ 
cerned with the factors affecting a pupil*s adjustment. Hall 
and Demarest 13 reported an experiment in Phoenix, Arizona, 
extending from 1946 to 1956 in which they adopted a com¬ 
bination of policies two and three above. In this period of

ten years neither the ability rating nor the reading ability 
of fourth grade pupils has changed markedly. Yet in that 
same period of time 69 per cent of fourth graders now fall 
within the normal range as compared with 56 per cent in the 
first year of the study. Their conclusion is that keeping 
children within their age group does not result in a lowering 
of standards. 

Not all writers are content with '’social promotion". 
Barlow 1 ** asks why a student should be promoted when his work 
is on a level one step below his present grade. A teacher's 
gradings become meaningless in the student's eyes, for the 
student knows he will be promoted. Socially promoted students 
do not try to do well. He states further: 

Retention of students might catch problems before they 
become too serious. Social promotion is advisable only 
where the child is doing the best possible job with his 
limited intellect, and even then, only when the child may 
work on his own level and not that of the class'. 

Anfinson 1 ^ in a study of four junior high schools in 
Minneapolis is not convinced that the popular belief that 
non-promotion as an administrative device is harmful. He 
selected 116 matched pairs, fifty-nine pairs of boys and 
fifty-seven pairs of girls. Students who had failed were

matched with students who had not on the bases of sex, atten¬ 
dance, chronological age, intelligence, socio-economic status. 
He eliminated those with I.Q.'s below eighty-five and atten¬ 
dance less than 80 per cent. To these matched pairs were 
given the following tests: 

Otis Self-Administering Form A Intermediate. 

The California Test of Mental Maturity. 

The Minnesota Occupational Scale. 

The Minneapolis Reading Test. 

The Minneapolis Arithmetic Test. 

The New Stanford Achievement Tests. 

The Symonds-Block Student Questionnaire. 

The Bell School Inventory. 

The findings were interesting: 

1. Social and personal adjustment - the advantage lay 
with the non-repeater. 

2. Non-repeaters were better adjusted to the school 
curriculum, the administration, teachers and in their 
personal affairs. 

3. However, not all the advantages lay with the non- 
repeaters. Repeaters ranked higher: 

a) In the social life of the school. 

b) In their relations with other pupils. 

c) In their relations at home and with their families. 
Poorly adjusted and well adjusted students were found 
in both groups.

Anfinson concluded that: 

Non-promotion can not be regarded as the essential 
factor in future maladjustment. Instruction based on 
individual differences, is as the readers may perceive, 
really an avoidance of the problem of school progress, 
for an individualized approach would eliminate the 
possibility of maladjustment due to non-promotion.1 < 

The case for continuous promotion has its proponents 

and so does the opposite viewpoint, that of non-promotion. 

1 8 

Lobdell x takes the latter position and states emphatically 
that repeating aids many pupils to achieve academic success. 

He warns, however, that repeaters must be individually dealt 
with and their teachers guided by definite criteria pains¬ 
takingly applied. 

Other ideas for dealing with school progress are re¬ 
peated in the literature, one of these being that of homo¬ 
geneous grouping. An exponent of this idea, Pearson 1 9 reports 
that grouping in the Deer Park School in Lake Forest, Illinois, 
brought out the best in their students. Students were divid¬ 
ed into classes on the basis of mental ability and academic 
achievement. The top group does not receive more work, but 
more challenging work. The program is flexible and students 
can be moved up or down as their progress warrants.

Those favoring an accelerated program feel that the 
school without such a program is not doing its job in proper- 

PD 

ly aiding the brighter student. One of these is Alltucker 

who claims that the accelerated student is not a misfit in 

school as he is claimed to be. A later study x supporting 

Alltucker was concerned with a group of high school students, 

one to three years younger than the control group, matched 

by sex, I.Q., father*s occupation, and school class. Age 

was the only variable. The younger group held more offices, 

received more scholarships, took part in more athletics. 

2 ? 

Higginbottom and Whitcomb make a strong point for 
establishing principles that are a sound basis for the pro¬ 
motion of pupils. They list five basic principles: 

1. Promotion must be in consonance with state law and 
local board of education regulations. 

2. Promotion policy must be the practical evidence of 
our educational philosophy. 

3* The level of values must be progressive through a 
student*s life from grade to grade and school to

school. These values need to be arrived at co¬ 
operatively. 

b. Promotional policies must stand on the premise of the 
dignity and worth of the individual. If we have 
streamed students into certain areas we should defend 
promotion on the basis of effort and success. 

5. The basic standard of promotion is that students should 
achieve basic standards in keeping with their ability, 
and the aggressively negative elements in our schools 
should be eliminated. 

An interesting approach to the practical aspect of do¬ 
ing something about student failure was reported by Brun- 
dage. 2 ^ The staff of the Whitehall Public School, Whitehall, 
Ohio, decided to study the problem as a group project. 

Pupils who had failed once or more in the course of their 
academic careers were of concern in the study. Each staff 
member was made responsible for three students. A questionnaire 
was sent to the parents and a questionnaire filled in by the 
student. The students* replies indicated that 57 per cent 
felt that they did slightly better or much better work be¬ 
cause of repeating a grade; the parents felt that 27 per cent 
had benefited slightly from repeating. In considering the 
social adjustment of students, many students felt that they

had more friends after being failed, while parents stated 
that the difference was very slight. More students than 
parents felt that retention was a good thing. The next step 
was a series of parent-teacher interviews which had two pur¬ 
poses, first to keep the parents informed and secondly to 
solicit their cooperation and support. The study stated 
that students of good mental ability or socially immature 
often benefited from retention and the retention of students 
with low mental ability is seldom beneficial. 

III. LITERATURE ON SCHOOL FAILURE 

As mentioned earlier, various points of view on deal¬ 
ing with promotion have their proponents. There are some 
who warn that caution must be exercised. Goodlad 2 ** states 
there is no panacea for taking care of the difficult pro¬ 
blem of promotion or non-promotion. His research (based on 
a bibliography of twenty-one studies) indicates that repeat¬ 
ers show a consistent pattern of undesirable growth charac¬ 
teristics and unsatisfactory school progress. Slow learners 
who have been promoted make better progress than their peers 
who have been kept back. Not all evidence favors the pro¬ 
moted group. Certain individual children have gained from 
the repetition of a grade. He states that the evidence

gathered does not favor a blanket promotion policy. Reten¬ 
tion in the lower grades is more beneficial than retention 
in the higher grades. His investigation pointed up the need 
for communication between the home and school at the time of 
retention. Failing is a severe emotional experience to both 
parent and pupil. The value of the study was that teachers 
were sensitized to the individual problems of students and 
all teachers realized the necessity for good records in a 
school system. 

Literature on failure at the high school level in a 
study of Texas schools showed that mental slowness and lack 
of effort were reasons given for *+9 per cent of the failures. 
A surprisingly high 2b per cent was attributed to mental 
deficiency. Lafferty 2 ^ asserted that 76 per cent of the 
failures were due to conditions for which the school was 
essentially responsible. The size of the school had little 
bearing on the per cent of failures. 

In a much more intensive study, Coleman 2 ^ tests as 
many as 113 reasons for student failure. Poor ability and 
lack of effort, along with parental indifference, are high 
on the list. Coleman groups the 113 causes under fifteen

general types: low mentality, lack of interest, lack of effort, 
excessive absence and poor study habits. Some causes rest with 
the school itself (overcrowded classes, curriculum inadequa¬ 
cies, lack of guidance services, incompetent instruction, lack 
of special classes). Many causes of failure are found in the 
out of school environment which are not so easily identified 
by nevertheless are important. To overcome school failures 
and lack of progress many devices have been introduced into 
the school program including trial promotions, special 
classes, semi-annual promotions and promotional units. 

In a study very similar to that of Coleman’s, Snyder 2 ? 
lists among the major causes of failure; poor foundation, 
frequent changes of schools, slow learning, irregular atten¬ 
dance, poor health, physical defects and low mentality. Other 
causes she would add are: the home environment, poor teaching 
and a lack of proper sleep. Each year there are a total of 
about two million elementary students in the United States 
who fail. She feels that proper guidance at the grade one 
level and homogeneous grouping would avoid the present 
strait-jacket grade system and eliminate many of these 
failures. The teacher must know the child. Trial promo¬ 
tions should be used in grade one because of the very high 
failure rate in this grade.

The goal to be achieved is a functional curriculum 
that eliminates failure. There should be a growing con¬ 
cern on the part of all those associatedoWith education 
for the development of the whole child, 

McKinney 2 ^ in his study of the problem of promotion 
concluded that only 35 per cent of the elementary school re¬ 
peaters actually did better work the second time, 53 per cent 
did not improve and 12 per cent did poorer work. 

Critics state that the spirit of competition has been 
eliminated by the one hundred per cent annual promotion pol¬ 
icy and the multiple standard report card.^ 0 The research 
on the subject is not at all certain that higher rates of 
non-promotion will uphold academic standards. School pro¬ 
grams must be adapted to children as they are. There can 
be no defense for any other policy than one hundred per cent 
promotion. 

Grace^l in his study of sixty grade one repeaters as 
compared with non-repeaters found that the average repeater 
did not learn more in two years than the non-repeater of the

same mental age learned in one year. 

One problem area as Hadley^ 2 points out is due to the 
fact that teachers do not agree on a standard meaning for a 
school mark. It is used for incentives, warnings, for per¬ 
manent records and for evaluation. A school mark often in¬ 
cludes subjective factors other than actual achievement. His 
study found that the students who were most liked by the 
teacher did better than their ability warranted. Conversely, 
the students least liked by the teacher received lower marks 
than their actual attainment. Girls particularly were ranked 
higher than their attainment warranted. In a study of twenty 
classrooms girls achieved better than boys in eleven out of 
the twenty classrooms, yet they were assigned higher marks 
in sixteen out of the twenty classrooms. He sums up his re¬ 
view by quoting from Ross: 

It seems too bad that marks received by certain in¬ 
dividuals are conditioned more by the contours of the 
face than the contents of the head.33 

In a Long Beach, California, public school study,^ 
two groups of potential failures were equated. One group 
repeated the grade; one group were promoted on trial. It

was found that those of normal ability gained more from trial 
promotion than children of equal ability who repeated the 
grade. Children of less than average ability gained a little 
more by repeating the grade than by trial promotion. 

IV. LITERATURE ON SCHOOL EVALUATION 

Considerable attention has been given by educators of 
late to the complicated task of evaluation. Evaluation is 
primarily concerned with an estimate of student progress, 
but it can, and often does, go much farther. Evaluation may 
be extended to include a school plant, equipment, staff, cur¬ 
riculum and teaching practices in addition to evaluation of 
the progress of the student. 

A difficulty that presents itself whenever pupil grad¬ 
ing is discussed, is just how progress in a school subject 
area is measured. Durost^? believes that teachers are in¬ 
adequately trained either to properly construct, administer 
or interpret test findings. He would like to see as part of 
every teacher*s training a course involving test construction 
and measurement. For those teachers already in the field a 
good deal of "in-service f} training on this vital subject is, 
he feels, a pressing need. 

In referring particularly to evaluation at high school

level, Carrothers^ introduces the teaching load both in and 
out of school as a contributory factor in the problem of 
student failure. Lack of interest on the part of the pupil 
and lack of understanding pupils on the part of the teacher, 
are fundamental reasons for student failure. Combined with 
the inability of the pupils to do the work expected, was paren¬ 
tal unconcern and community misunderstanding of what educa¬ 
tion consists. He felt that educators can neither measure 
educational growth nor show the public that educational 
growth has been made. "Spoon feeding" at home and in the 
school and the community has done much to limit the effort of 
application needed for success. 

Evaluation, however, is not limited to subject areas. 

If we agree with the philosophy of education which is con¬ 
cerned with the total growth of the child, then evaluation 
of a child*s progress in school becomes a very difficult and 
complete type of analysis. This overall view is taken by 
Wrightston@37 W ho states modern evaluation must consider the 
school plant, curriculum, the staff, subject offerings, and 
the pupils. Evaluation can only begin when the objectives 
of the school program have been considered and clarified.

All phases of a child *s growth and development must be con¬ 
sidered and as wide a variety of testing devices in as many 
areas as possible must be used* To accomplish such a pur¬ 
pose there must be effective leadership, staff cooperation, 
and a willingness to explore the weaknesses in order to im¬ 
prove the effeciency of the school to promote and develop 
the whole child. 

V. LITERATURE ON SCHOOL DROP-OUTS 

It would seem logical to assume that there is a re¬ 
lationship between retardation and drop-outs. The pupil who 
is overage for his grade often shows negativistic attitudes 
toward school and often becomes a problem child. This group 
are prone to leave school when the legal leaving age is 
reached. The remedies proposed for school failure in all 
probability are the ones which will most effectively meet 
the threat of elimination. When a child is happily adjusted 
in his school work, the danger of retardation and eventual 
elimination is greatly reduced. 

The reasons for school drop-outs, says Hohol,38 are- 
many and operate as a cluster. The most pertinent seem to 
be economic status, retardation, becoming overage, intelli¬ 
gence, and home status. Hohol states, "Low intelligence has

been overrated as a primary cause of early school leaving."^ 
With the present concern over drop-outs and much 

LlQ 

being written on the subject, Byrne takes a rather dif¬ 
ferent approach than most. He states flatly that students 
drop out, research shows, for two basic reasons; they leave 
school to work or are uninterested. There is no purpose, he 
feels, in retaining these pupils as the schools already have 
their facilities taxed to the utmost. To retain many of 
these pupils would be a trying experience to all concerned. 
Certainly, we should not harbour any idea that we would some¬ 
how increase the pool of technically trained workers by re¬ 
taining these. 

On the positive side this writer states that the school 
can do five things about the drop-out problem: 

1. Identify potential drop-outs early. 

2. Coordinate those factors so that a student may stay 
in school if he is able. 

3. Provide school experiences that offer fruitful learn¬ 
ing. 

4. Help each drop-out leave school with his head high 
and a solid plan for the future. 

5. Beware of sweeping plans to keep everybody in school.

The difficulties of trying to retain all pupils in 

Llt 

high school is part of a recent report. x The report con¬ 
tinues that it is not desirable nor possible to hold all 
pupils through graduation, but it is possible to hold a 
greater portion of high school students for a longer period 
of time than now obtains. The measurement of holding power 
was arrived at by relating the number of graduates to the 
number of ninth grade pupils. On this basis the holding 
power of Ithaca Public Schools varied from 70 per cent to 
77 per cent between 19*+7 and 1951. The report also notes 
that holding power is affected by conditions outside as well 
as within the school. The greatest failing of the high 
school, the report continues, is the lack of understanding 
of children. Many of the fifty students who dropped out 
between 19^5 and 1950 might have been saved if some staff 
member had gained a fuller understanding of the situation 
and made appropriate adjustments. However, youth who left 
school revealed a pattern of values and attitudes at vari¬ 
ance with the school, the home or the community. To be re¬ 
tained the child’s values and the school's values must be 
consonant.

CHAPTER III 


I. SOURCES OF THE DATA 

The data for the study were made available by the 
Edmonton Public School Board* This was supplemented by 
reference to the files of the Provincial Department of Edu¬ 
cation. From the promotion sheets of all grade seven pupils 
in the Edmonton city school system, the names of students 
who had failed during the years 1951 and 1952 were deter¬ 
mined. In all, 228 students were listed, and the cumulative 
records of 212 were still on file in the School Board of¬ 
fices. A search of the cumulative records on file and an 
examination of the present high school pupil rosters failed 
to turn up the missing cards or to determine whether the 
missing pupils were presently, or had recently been, enrolled 
in Edmonton public schools. There were two possible reasons 
to account for cards not being available. The first, a 
change of name or serious misspelling of a name on the pro¬ 
motion sheets; and the second, which was more likely, the 
actual loss of a card somewhere in the system. It was be¬ 
lieved that the missing sixteen cards would in no way inval¬ 
idate the sample which would be used as the basis for any 
valid conclusions that the data might reveal. 

To serve as a basis of comparison with the study sample 
a reference sample of 212 cumulative record cards was drawn 
from the files at the Edmonton Public School Board offices.

From sixty-five hundred alphabetically arranged cards, every 
thirtieth card was drawn until 212 were in the sample. While 
this method of selecting the reference sample could not meet 
the basic requirement of a true random sample, it was con¬ 
sidered that any bias in sampling introduced by the method 
used would be negligible. It was believed that a basis of 
comparison would be helpful in four areas: with reference to 
the Laycock Mental Ability Test because statistics were lack¬ 
ing with respect to the normal distribution of scores of city 
pupils; with reference to fathers’ or guardians’ occupations; 
with reference to home status; and particularly with refer¬ 
ence to the teachers’ ratings on the six areas of personality 
development. The significance of the differences between 
the study sample and the reference sample was tested by 
in each of the four areas mentioned above. 

A careful study of the cumulative record cards re¬ 
vealed pertinent information that could be used advanta¬ 
geously in assessing these grade seven failures. The cumu¬ 
lative record card was supplemented by a separate attendance 
and progress card which included the complete medical his¬ 
tory of each child. The data from each student’s set of 
cards was duly noted on specially prepared summary data 
sheets. This information was then coded on International 
Business Machine cards for analysis. The coding of the vari¬ 
ous data is summarized in Appendix A.

II. THE QUESTIONNAIRE 

To supplement the information on each student, a ques¬ 
tionnaire was sent each of the 212 that constituted the study 
sample (Appendix B). This questionnaire inquired about the 
highest grade of schooling attained, the further training 
taken since leaving school, the present employment and the 
type of employment. They were asked, with respect to their 
attitude toward school, if they were attending school now 
would they continue with their schooling or drop-out at the 
same grade; and finally whether or not they were married. 

III. ANALYSIS OF DATA 

The data on the students' records were divided into 
three main areas: 

1. Pre grade seven. 

2. Grade seven. 

3. Post grade seven. 

In addition, the following study sample data were 
tabulated as contingency tables and tested for the existence 
of pertinent relationships using the %’ 1 " test. 

1. The age at grade seven failure and the intelligence 

quotient. 

2. The age at grade seven failure and the achievement 
prior to grade seven. 

. The age at grade seven failure and the drop-outs from 
the city system.

CHAPTER IV 


ANALYSIS AND SIGNIFICANCE OF THE DATA 

The data were organized to present as complete a de¬ 
scription of grade seven failure as possible. Grade seven 
failures were analysed in main areas: 

1. Pre grade seven. 

2. Grade seven. 

3. Post grade seven. 

4. Relationship of selected factors to failure. 

I. PRE GRADE SEVEN STUDY 

To deal effectively with this particular area of the 
students’ progress, academic achievement and the environ¬ 
mental factors of the 212 students in the study sample were 
examined as follows: 

1. Age at grade one entrance. 

2. Health factors. 

3. Home status. 

4. Father’s occupation. 

5. Achievement prior to grade seven. 

6 . Pre grade seven schooling in Edmonton. 

7. Unit Scale Reading, grade four. 

8 . Spelling Ability Test, grade four. 

9. Intelligence.

Ayres in reference to judging overageness and accel¬ 
eration from age tables used a two year age span to represent 
normal progress for each grade. In Edmonton the earliest 
starting age for grade one is five years six months. Using 
Ayres* scale, five years six months to seven years six months 
is normal for grade one.

Table II above gives the health records of the sample. 
One hundred and ninety-three enjoyed normal good health. 

Only 9 per cent may have been adversely affected by personal 
health reasons. Health may be discounted as a major reason 
for failure in this sample. 

Coleman* 1 * in his study lists conditions in the home 
as one of the reasons for failure. Table III shows the home 
conditions for the study sample compared with the reference 
sample.

In the study sample, 159 come from normal homes. An 
arbitrary grouping of other than normal homes as broken homes 
puts fifty-three in that category. A clearer understanding 
of the significance of this data may be seen from a compar¬ 
ison with the reference sample. Twenty-four came from homes 
which could be described as broken, as compared with fifty-

three among the failures. It would appear that abnormal home 
conditions are almost twice as frequent among the failing 
group as in the normal population. The differences for both 
totals and for sex in the study sample and the reference 
sample when tested by were significant at the 1 % level of 
confidence. 

Socio-economic status of the home and student failure 
are often linked in the research literature. Douglas and 
Campbell state: 

Failures come largely from homes of inferior mental 
status, there were few evidences of cultural interests 
and the fathers were skilled laborers. ^ 

Table IV indicates that 91*5 per cent of the parents 
of the pupils in the study sample were in the unemployed, 
unskilled, semi-skilled or skilled group. The sample repre¬ 
sents very much the same group as studied by Douglas and 
Campbell. Thirty-three of the reference sample, as compared 
with 128 of the failure group, were in the semi-skilled, un¬ 
skilled or unemployed group. Fifty-eight, or 27.3 per cent, 
of the reference group were in the managerial or profes¬ 
sional group as compared with only eight, or 3*8 per cent, in 
the failure sample. Thirty-five more parents were in the 
skilled group in the reference sample than appeared in the 
failure sample. Considering the lower three categories;

the reference sample were represented in this group. The 
differences between the study sample and the reference sample 
were significant at the if level of confidence for totals;

The history of academic progress in grades prior to 
grade seven is presented in Table V. One hundred and eleven, 
or more than half the study sample, had experienced previous 
failure in one or more grades. An additional thirty-one had 
been recommended on one or more occasions. Of those who had 
passed all grades previously the majority were borderline 
cases. Most of the study sample had indicated by their 
academic records that they were n out-of-step n with the school 
curriculum.

the sample spent all their school years in Edmonton. Arbi¬ 
trarily considering three years or less in the system as a 
possible source of academic difficulties, fifty-eight, or 
27.3 per cent, of the sample were so affected. Another 
possible source of academic difficulty does not show, that 
is movement from school to school within the system.

What about the reading ability of these failing stu¬ 
dents? The ability to read affects every subject area in the 
curriculum. To provide a basis for examination of the reading 
ability of this sample of 212 failing students, the scores of

a city wide school population. Revisions have been made and 

revised norms were determined in 1948 and 1951. Since the 

test is administered in January, an average grade four student 

would score about 4.5 to 4.9 at this time of year. However, 

small deviations from the norms should not be regarded as too 
L a 

significant. °

An examination of the failing sample indicated that 
within the group was a range of reading skills of 4.5 years. 
Thirty-six students out of 212 in the sample scored normal 
or better than normal scores, while ninety-three, or 72.6 per 
cent, of those who took the test showed some reading dis¬ 
ability varying from slight to serious.

At the grade four level a Spelling Ability Test was 
given to all Edmonton public school students. This test was 
normalized on the city school population in exactly the same 
way as the reading test mentioned earlier. This test was 
given in May and scores of 4.5 to 5*0 were considered normal.

Table VIII shows a spread in spelling ability of five 
years. Only 35*2 per cent of those who took the test have 
normal scores or better for their grade. Eighty-one, or 64.8 
per cent, of these students were poorer than average spellers. 
Again, eighty-seven missing scores prevented a complete pre¬ 
sentation of the spelling ability of this sample. 

Low mental ability is referred to frequently in the 
related literature as one of the major reasons for failure. 

The cumulative record cards of the study sample were examined

for test scores on the Laycock Mental Ability Test, the 
Departmental General Test score at grade nine, and the Otis 
Test Form A in high school. Both the Departmental Test at 
grade nine and the Otis Form A were discarded because of the 
relatively few students in the sample who had taken the tests. 
The recorded scores of the study sample in the Laycock Men¬ 
tal Ability Test were tabulated as shown in Table IX.

If I.Q. scores of 95 to 10b are considered as normal, 
then an examination of Table IX indicates that of the 191 
whose test scores were recorded, 59.6 per cent had scores 
lower than normal and only 11 per cent had scores above nor¬ 
mal, 

A study of Table IX B indicates that I.Q.’s below 
normal (95 to loV) were 18.7 per cent of the reference sample 
whose I.Q. scores were recorded, as compared with 59.6 per 
cent below normal in the study sample. Considering scores 
above normal (105 and above), 51*8 per cent of the reference 
sample had I.Q. scores in this group as compared with 11 per 
cent in the study sample. The differences between the study 
sample and the reference sample for both the total group and 
sex were significant at the 1 % level of confidence. 

II. GRADE SEVEN STUDY 

In order to present the grade seven academic achieve¬ 
ment, or lack of achievement, of the 212 failing grade seven 
students, the following aspects of student progress were 
tabulated for the grade seven study: 

1. Age at grade seven failure, 

2. Attendance in grade seven, the year of failure. 

3. The teacher’s ratings of personality development at 

grade seven, the year of failure.

Table X indicates that seventy- 

-eight, 

or 36.8 per 


cent, of the study sample are of normal age for grade seven, 
while the remaining 13^, or 63.2 per cent, are retarded from 
one to four years. Since all of this sample began grade one 
at a normal age (Table I, page 35) ? causes other than late 
starting were responsible for this retardation. Sex dif¬ 
ferences in this sample are not significant. 

How successful were the repeaters the second year in 
grade seven? The related literature is in general agreement 
that repeaters do not do as well scholastically the second 

) j Q 

year. McKinney in a study of promotion, states that only

Table XI Indicates that 119,

cent, of the 


study sample did better work the second year, as compared 
with McKinney*s figure of 35 per cent. Thirty-two, or 19 
per cent, of the sample did work about the same level, as 
compared with 53 per cent in McKinney * s study. Only eleven, 
or 6.7 per cent, did inferior work the second year, as com¬ 
pared with McKinney*s figure of 12 per cent. The improve¬ 
ment in the second year may be more apparent than real. 

Table XXXVII, page 76 , indicates that the majority who re¬ 
ceived higher marks the second year were given only minimum 
passing grades.

Table XII indicates that l6^f, or 77«3 per cent, had 
an attendance of 160 or more days. Forty-seven, or 22.7 per 
cent, had attendance fewer than 160 days. Considering that 
this latter group generally are poor achievers, the poor 
attendance may have had an important bearing on the year*s 
results. 

The teachers 1 ratings of these failing students in 
personality development is of particular significance. It 
must be remembered that these ratings are entirely subjec¬ 
tive, but are,nonetheless*pertinent. Ayres stated that:

Overage children constitute a serious problem to the 
teacher. Misfits require special attention if they are 
to do satisfactory work, and make more difficult the 
work with the other children.50 

Goodlad in a later study said essentially the same 


thing: 


Students who repeat show a consistent pattern of un¬ 
desirable growth characteristics and unsatisfactory 
school progress.51 

If overage and retarded students tend to be problems, 
this fact should show up on the personality development rat¬ 
ings as recorded in Tables XIII - XVIII. In order to have 
some measure by which to judge these ratings, each of the 
six areas of personality development is tabulated first for 
the study sample of 212 failures and then for the reference 
sample of 212. The teachers’ ratings in these subject areas 
are made with reference to a handbook issued by the Edmonton 
Public School Board .' To save space the ratings may be 
summarized thus: ratings are given by numbers on a four 
point scale; 1. Very Good, 2. Good (average pupil), 3* Fair 
(a smaller number will rate 3)? Poor (only a very few 
poorly adjusted students would ordinarily need to be rated

cases as compared with nineteen in the reference sample. It 
is to be expected that those students with a background of 
either previous failure or poor achievement found school a 
frustrating experience and this frustration was shown in 
their lack of co-operation in the classroom. The differ¬ 
ences between the study sample and the reference sample for 
both the total group and for sex were significant at the 1 % 
level of confidence. 

The personality development rating of dependability

Table XVII A indicates that 79 of the failures rated 
3 (much supervision and prodding needed to complete work) 
and nineteen rated b (unreliable)• Table XVII B indicates 
that only eleven of the reference sample rated 3 and only two 
rated 4. Fifteen of the failures rated 1 (very dependable), 
as compared with seventy for the reference sample. The dif¬ 
ferences between the study sample and the reference sample

In Table XVIII A, the failure sample, forty-seven 
rated 3 (self-centred, saucy, insincere), and ten received 4 
(anti-social, insolent, crude). Table XVIII B shows that 
only fourteen of the reference sample rated 3 and none rated 
4. In the failure group 144 rated average or better in cour¬ 
tesy, while the reference sample showed 162 in the same 
categories. The samples were significantly different for 
both the total group and sex at the 1% level of confidence. 

It is apparent that the group of failures are more 
trouble to their teachers than the normal group and gen¬ 
erally have been rated lower in all six ratings of the per¬ 
sonality development scale. A number of these failing 
students must have been a considerable trial to the teachers 
and interfered with normal classroom progress for the other 
students in the class. 

III. POST GRADE SEVER STUDY 

The third phase of the study on grade seven failures 
has to do with their post grade seven history. To deal with 
this part of the study, the following areas will be con¬ 
sidered as they apply to the study sample of 212 failures: 

1. The Reading Ability Test Grade Eight. 

2. The Spelling Improvement Test Grade Eight. 

3. Grade eight averages. 

4. Grade nine averages. 

5. Grade nine departmental transmuted scores.

Drop-outs from the city system. 

Because of drop-outs at grade seven and during grade 


eight and succeeding grades, the numbers involved in the 
tables relating to the study sample will become smaller and 
smaller. 

The Spelling Improvement Test Grade Eight is a test 
developed on the population of Edmonton city schools. Scores 
of 8.5 to 9*0 are considered normal for the test, which is 
given in May of each year to grade eight classes.

Table XIX indicates that only eighty out of the orig¬ 
inal 212 wrote the test. Of this group thirty-six made scores 
of 8.5 or higher, while forty-four, or 55 per cent, had 
spelling difficulties. 

The Reading Ability Test was given in June and ratings 
of 8.5 to 9.0 were to be considered normal for the grade. 

This test, like others referred to, was normalized on the 
population of grade eight students in the Edmonton public 
school system.

An examination of Table XX indicates that of the 
ninety who took the test, forty-two rated as normal or better 
in reading, while forty-eight, or 53 per cent, had reading 
difficulties.

Sex differences with respect to these two tests are 
interesting. In the Spelling Improvement Test, *+5*7 per cent 
of the girls where below standard and 66 per cent of the boys 
who wrote the test were rated substandard. In the Reading 
Ability Test thirty-five girls out of forty-five who wrote the 
test, or 71 per cent, were below normal reading ability, while 
thirty boys out of the fifty-five who took the test, or 5^*5 
per cent, were below normal. It would appear that among these 
failures the girls are the better spellers and the boys are 
the better readers. 

What about the post academic record of the grade seven 
failures? Recorded in the tables are fewer and fewer numbers 
as drop-outs occur along the way.

Ninety-eight have dropped out (thirty-five girls and sixty- 
three boys). Eighty-nine of the 114- made averages of 50 per 
cent or better. Only thirty-four, however, made passing 
averages of 60 per cent or better. Consideration due to age 
trial promotions and other devices must have been used to 
enable most of those in the bracket above 50 per cent to go 
on to grade nine.

The grade nine averages of the thirty-nine boys and 
thirty-three girls who wrote the grade nine departmentals 
are grouped mainly as B ! s and C’s, with 92 per cent in these 
two categories. Although an A standing was achieved by only 
one student, only four of the seventy-two were failed in 
this grade. 

The differences in achievement of these seventy-two 
students who wrote the grade nine departmental examinations 
can be better illustrated by their transmuted scores in each 
subject area as recorded from the Provincial Department of 
Education^ files. These scores are shown in Table XXIII.

NOTE: TOTAL POSSIBLE MARK FOR LITERATURE IS 50. 

ALL OTHER SUBJECTS HAVE A TOTAL POSSIBLE MARK OF 100 
































































62 

In Table XXIII there is a wide range of scores noted 
in all subject areas. In language, social studies, math¬ 
ematics and science, a range of about 60 per cent is shown, 
while reading has a range of about 70 per cent. Literature, 
which is based on a total mark of fifty, shows a range of 
nearly 40 per cent. Boys received a higher score than girls 
in both reading and science, but also received a lower score 
than the girls in both mathematics and social studies. Girls 
did not obtain higher scores than boys in any subject area, 
but received a lower score in science. 

Of the sixty-eight who could go on to grade ten, 
only forty-seven wrote the grade ten finals.

averages above 50 per cent, while the remaining twenty-eight 
had averages less than 50 per cent. The group who have 
managed to remain in school thus far are not doing well. 

A better idea of these students 1 progress in grade ten 
can be gained by the following table which indicates the 
number of grade ten credits that were actually received by 
the study sample.

Table XXV shows that twelve secured fewer than twenty- 
five credits and only seventeen actually completed a full 
year*s work in grade ten. In terms of the original sample, 
only 8 per cent had completed a full grade ten program. 

Forty-seven of the sample had entered grade ten, only 
twenty-two wrote the grade eleven finals. Table XXVI shows 
that of the twenty-two who wrote the grade eleven examinations 
only six secured an average of better than 50 per cent.

less than twenty credits. Note that 8.3 per cent of the 
original sample of girls have reached grade eleven, while 
11.7 per cent of the original sample of boys have reached the 
same grade.

From the 

original 

sample of 212, 

numbers have been re- 

duced 

to nine. 

Of these 

nine, only five 

received 

a high 



school diploma, and only one obtained a University entrance 
standing. 

The drop-out rate is more clearly shown in Table XXIX. 
If from this table the drop-outs are added cumulatively, 
eighty dropped out in grade seven, a total of 130 by grade 
eight. This is increased to 159 by grade nine, to 168 by 
grade ten, and 203 at the end of grade eleven. Of the

In order to complete this part of the study, a ques¬ 
tionnaire (Appendix B) was sent to each of the 212 students 
in the study sample. Seventy-five forms were not returned 
and eighty-nine letters were returned to the sender because 
of "no such address", "address unknown" or "moved". The 
distribution of the forty-eight completed questionnaires by 
grade of completed schooling are tabulated in Table XXX. 

Table XXX shows that for the whole sample, the rate 
of return was only 22 per cent. It is worth noting, however, 
that the returns become progressively better as the grades 
advance, until in grade twelve 73 per cent replied. The 
percentage of returns was so low that little significance 
can be attached to the findings of this part of the study.

However, the returned questionnaires were tabulated for the 


interesting data they did contain. Extreme caution should

In Table XXXI it is shown that of the forty-eight 
replying, thirty-four had taken additional training. With 
respect to their attitude toward school, if they were atten¬ 
ding school now thirty-nine would continue their education 
and only nine would stop at the same grade. Thirty-nine are 
employed, mainly in the skilled and semi-skilled trades, and 
the majority are manual workers. The work pattern follows 
closely that of their parents (Table IV, page 39). Sixteen 
of the individuals replying were married.53

IV. RELATIONSHIP OF SELECTED FACTORS TO FAILURE 

Certain pertinent relationships affecting failure 
were tabulated and tested for significance. Those examined 
for relationship were: 

1. Distribution of age and I.Q. at the time of grade 
seven failure. 

2. Age at grade seven failure and achievement prior to 
grade seven. 

3. Age at grade seven failure and drop-outs from the 
city system. 

4. Father*s occupation and the I.Q. 

5. Achievement in the repeated year of grade seven and 
drop-outs from the city system. 

Table X, page 46, indicates that 134 of this study 
sample were retarded one or more years. Is there a re¬ 
lationship between their retardation and their intelli¬ 
gence? 


to contact the University. Because of the interest shown 
in her boy by the questionnaire, she would like the Univer¬ 
sity to do something for him. The boy is twenty-three and 
unable to hold a steady job. He had been refused appren¬ 
ticeship training and the armed services had turned him down. 
The boy was referred to the Educational Clinic under Pro¬ 
fessor W. B. Dockrell. Tests indicated that this boy has 
an extremely low intelligence quotient. During his school 
years this boy should have been in the special classes for 
those with low intelligence. He was referred to the Na¬ 
tional Employment Service and reference made to his dis¬ 
ability, in the hope that they might find him employment 
within his capacities.

Table XXXII indicates a relationship between the age 
at grade seven and the intelligence significant at the 1 % 
level of confidence. The table shows that generally, the 
older a student is in grade seven, the lower his intelligence 
will be. Conversely, the younger students have the highest 
intelligence. The mental age aspect must not be overlooked. 
The mental age of an older student with low intelligence is 
comparable to that of a younger student with higher intelli¬ 
gence. Chronologically, this study sample at grade seven 
showed a range in age of five years. The range in mental 
age of the group was three years seven months. This table 
underlines the importance of intelligence as one of the 
factors in retardation.

Table XXXIII examines the possible relationship be¬ 
tween the age at grade seven and the academic achievement 
prior to grade seven. This table indicates that those who 
are overage in grade seven at the time of failure are over¬ 
age because of failure in elementary grades. More than half

in grade nine. In detecting potential drop-outs at the grade 
seven level, the age factor is an important prognosticator of 
an imminent drop-out. The relationship between age at grade 
seven and drop-outs from the city system is significant at 
the 1 % level of confidence.

Table XXXVII gives the year*s averages of those stu¬ 
dents repeating grade seven and adds to the findings of Table 
XXXVI. It suggests that while 70 per cent of the repeaters 
did in fact receive higher marks the second year, the majority 
of these, 72 per cent, received only minimum passing grades. 
The findings suggest the possibility of some of these stu¬ 
dents being promoted for purposes of expediency.

CHAPTER V 


SUMMARY OF FINDINGS 

I. THE PRE GRADE SEVEN STUDY 

All of the 212 students who comprised the group of 
failures that made up the study sample, entered grade one 
at a normal age. Their lack of progress in the grades was 
therefore not due to late school entry. Nineteen of the 
sample were affected by poor health. However, the drop¬ 
out rate of this group was not materially different than 
that of the complete sample. Health was not an important 
factor in failure in the complete study sample. The major¬ 
ity came from normal homes. Fifty-three came from broken 
homes. When the study sample was compared with the refer¬ 
ence sample, it was found that broken homes were more than 
twice as frequent in the failing group as in the reference 
sample. The socio-economic status of the study sample as 
represented by the fathers’ occupations was almost identical 
with the fathers’ occupations represented in a study of 
junior high school failures.^ A comparison of the fa¬ 
thers' occupations in the study sample with those in the 
reference sample revealed that only 3.8 per cent of the 
study sample were in the managerial or professional group 
while 27*3 per cent of the reference sample were in this

category. In the study sample 58.5 per cent of the fathers 
were represented in the semi-skilled, unskilled and unemployed 
group as compared with only 1?.5 per cent of the fathers in 
the reference sample. Previous failure had been experienced 
by 52 per cent of the study sample and 14-.1 per cent had been 
given trial promotions on one or more occasions. Late entry 
into the Edmonton system might have adversely affected fifty- 
eight, or 22.6 per cent. The majority of these grade seven 
failures were below grade standard in both reading and spelling 
during grade four. The intelligence quotient of the study 
sample as measured by the Laycock Mental Ability Test was 
considerably lower than that of the reference sample. The 
study sample had 59*6 per cent of the students with I.Q. ! s 
below 95 as compared with 18.7 per cent of the students in 
the reference sample. Only 11 per cent of the study sample 
had I.Q.’s above 105 as compared with 51*8 per cent of the 
reference sample. 

II. THE GRADE SEVEN STUDY 

A study of the ages at the time of grade seven failure 
indicated that 63.2 per cent were overage for their grade. 

This is significant when it is recalled that all of these 
students were of normal age in grade one. Seventy per cent 
of grade seven repeaters did better work the second year in 
the grade. The majority of these, however, received only 
minimum passing grades. A consideration of school attendance

during grade seven, the year of failure, indicated that 22.7 
per cent of the sample could have been adversely affected by 
poor attendance. A comprehensive study of the six areas in 
personality development (emotional control, creativeness, 
judgment, co-operation, dependability and courtesy) of the 
study sample compared with the ratings in the same areas of 
the reference sample revealed that the study sample rated 
significantly lower in every trait than did the reference 
sample. 

III. THE POST GRADE SEYEN STUDY 

The majority of the students who reached grade eight 
and were given the grade eight spelling and reading tests 
were below normal grade standards. Grade eight final marks 
indicated that only 29 per cent made averages of 60 per cent 
or better. In grade nine, only one student received an A 
standing. The grade nine departmental transmuted scores re¬ 
vealed a wide range of achievement on each of the depart¬ 
mental tests. In grade ten,seventeen students actually 
completed a full yearns work and in grade eleven there were 
seven who successfully carried a complete grade eleven pro¬ 
gram. Nine students entered grade twelve and five of these 
earned high school diplomas, one student earned a matric¬ 
ulation standing. Drop-outs from the city system when added 
cumulatively by grades show eighty drop-outs at grade seven, 
130 by grade eight, 159 by grade nine, 186 by grade ten, and 
203 by grade eleven.

The lack of a sufficient number of replies invalidated 
the follow-up questionnaire. The returns were progressively 
better the higher the grade the student had reached in school. 
Of the forty-eight who replied, thirty-four indicated they had 
taken some type of additional training since leaving school. 

IV. RELATIONSHIP OF SELECTED FACTORS TO FAILURE 

1. The relationship between the age at grade seven and 
the intelligence quotient was found to be significant 
at the 1% level of confidence. 

2. The relationship between the age at grade seven fail¬ 
ure and the achievement prior to grade seven was 
found to be significant at the 1% level of confidence. 

3. The relationship between the age at grade seven fail¬ 
ure and the drop-outs from the city system was found 
to be significant at the 1% level of confidence. 

k. The relationship between the fathers* occupations and 
the intelligence quotient was not a significant one. 

5. The relationship between the achievement the repeated 
year in grade seven and the drop-outs from the city 
system was found to be significant at the 1% level of 
confidence.

CHAPTER VI 


CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 

This dissertation has described the grade seven fail¬ 
ures in three main areas: the progress of the pupils prior 
to grade seven, the achievement of the pupils at grade seven, 
and the achievement of those who stayed in school and pro¬ 
gressed beyond the grade seven level. Conclusions are stated 
with respect to each of these areas, 

I. CONCLUSIONS RESPECTING PROGRESS 
PRIOR TO GRADE SEVEN 

1. Late starting in school was not a factor in later 
retardation. All of the pupils in the study sample began 
grade one within normal age limits. 

2. More than half of the students, 52 per cent, had 
failed once or more during their elementary school years. 

An additional l*+.l per cent of these students had been given 
trial promotions on one or more occasions. There \*as ample 
evidence available by the time these students reached grade 
seven to indicate that they were having difficulty in school. 

3* These students were handicapped by low intelligence. 
When compared with a Reference sample it was revealed that 
59.6 per cent of the failures, as against 18.7 per cent of 
the reference sample, had I.Q.’s below ninety-five. Only 
11 per cent of the failures, as compared with 51*8 per cent

of the reference sample, had I.Q.'s above 105. The majority 
of these students could not proceed at a normal rate due to 
lack of ability. 

II. CONCLUSIONS RESPECTING THE 
GRADE SEVEN STUDY 

1. At the time of grade seven failure 63.2 per cent 
of the pupils in the study sample were overage for their 
grade. Since they all started school within normal age 
limits this retardation was due to failure in elementary 
grades. 

2. The fact that 70 per cent of the pupils who re¬ 
peated grade seven did better work the second year would 
seem to indicate that repeating the grade was of value to 
the majority. It must be borne in mind, however, that the 
majority of those doing better work the repeated year re¬ 
ceived only minimum passing grades. However, there was the 
suggestion that those who did much better work the repeated 
year in the grade progressed farther in school. 

3. The study sample rated significantly lower on 
all six areas of the personality development scale on 
ratings given by the teachers than did a reference sample 
with which it was compared. The greater number of 3 and 4 
ratings in the study sample was an indication that these 
pupils had much more difficulty in adjusting to the school 
situation than did the normal students.

III. CONCLUSIONS RESPECTING THE 
POST GRADE SEVEN STUDY 

1. Eighty students dropped out at grade seven, 130 
by grade eight, 159 by grade nine, 186 by grade ten and 
203 by grade eleven* A large number of these students ob¬ 
viously waited until they were of legal age so they might 
leave school. 

2. Five students of the original sample of 212 com¬ 
pleted high school. The chances of a grade seven failure 
completing high school are about two in one hundred. 

IV. GENERAL CONCLUSIONS WITH RESPECT 
TO FAILURE 

No summary of the teachers’ reasons for failing 
these pupils was compiled. A study of the collected data 
reveals certain contributing factors that caused failure at 
the grade seven level: 

1. Low intelligence. 

2. Poor achievement in elementary grades. 

3. Poor attitude toward school. 

b. Poor socio-economic status as represented by the 

fathers’ occupations.

V. IMPLICATIONS WITH RESPECT TO 
NON-PROMOTION AS A POLICY 

A study of the data with respect to the grade seven 
failures has indicated that 66.1 per cent of the sample had 
experienced previous failure or trial promotion. This was 
a major factor in creating the situation in which 63.2 per 
cent of the failures were overage at grade seven. Certain 
questions arise with respect to these overage students: Is 
it possible they had difficulty in adjusting socially with 
the younger students in their classrooms? How did they do 
in sports? Did they become problems in the classroom? The 
tables with respect to the six areas of personality develop¬ 
ment indicate that there were areas of maladjustment for these 
students. It would seem probable that previous failure and 
poor achievement had conditioned these students to expect 
little success from school. However, although 70 per cent 
of the repeaters in grade seven received better marks the 
second year, the bulk of these, 72 per cent, received min¬ 
imum passing grades. It would appear that some of these 
students benefited from the repeated year and others may 
have been expediently promoted. 

About sixty per cent of the failure sample had I.Q.'s 
below ninety-five. It would seem that this group is ser¬ 
iously handicapped with respect to making normal progress 
in school. The analysis of the six areas of personality 
development ratings suggests that this group of students

could have benefited from some type of program apart from 
the regular classes. 

VI. IMPLICATIONS WITH RESPECT TO DROP-OUTS 

There is evidence to suggest that a number of these 
students remained in school only until they reached the legal 
age of school leaving. There are certain implications that 
arise with respect to the drop-out problem as it affected 
these failures. Is the school program geared to favor those 
with normal or better intelligence? It would seem likely 
that a number of grade seven failures left school simply be¬ 
cause the school curriculum had nothing to offer them. Should 
consideration be given to a general broadening of the cur¬ 
riculum to provide for those of lower intelligence? Should 
there be classes to provide specifically for those of lower 
intelligence with a special program of studies? It would 
appear that if anything specific is to be done with respect 
to a group like that represented by the study sample, con¬ 
sideration must be given to some special type of program in 
the schools. 

Hohol^? in his study of the problem of drop-outs in¬ 
dicated that low intelligence has been overrated as a reason 
for early school leaving. It would appear from the study 
sample of grade seven failures that low intelligence may have

been the major factor in poor achievement with consequent 
discouragement and drop-out. The apparent disagreement be¬ 
tween Hohol’s findings and those of this study is caused by 
the fact that Hohol's study surveyed a much broader area, in¬ 
cluding all those who dropped out of school for reasons other 
than failure, while this study is limited to the grade seven 
failures. 

VII. IMPLICATIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE 
PRESENT EXPERIMENT IN DIVISION I 

The problem of non-promotion at the elementary level 
is being considered with respect to a streaming program in 
which non-promotion is but one facet of the problem. An 
experiment is being tried in several Edmonton city schools 
with respect to three streams in Division I: an accelerated 
program of two years, a regular program of three years, and 
a four year program to look after the slow learner. The par¬ 
ticular value of the program is that students under this plan 
take the same work but at different rates according to their 
ability. No assessment of the program has been made as yet, 
but it is the first major step in recognition of individual 
differences. Calgary has had a similar program for a longer 
period of time and Gillespie^® in his evaluation of it, notes 
that the four year program students do not achieve as well as 
the repeaters and suggests that this is probably caused by the

fact that teachers in dealing with the four year children do 
not treat them differently than others in the class. A fur¬ 
ther assessment is necessary, he believes, to see if this is 
the case. His study points out the need for individualized 
attention for these slower students. If such individualized 
attention is to be provided, small classes, keenly interested 
teachers, and principals sympathetic to the program are nec¬ 
essary. 

It would seem that this experimental plan should pro¬ 
vide separate classes for the slow learners. With this 
addition, the experimental plan may have at least partial 
answers to two of the major problems of promotion. Retar¬ 
dation creates overageness for the grade, and may also cause 
the overage student to be socially maladjusted to the younger 
students in the class. The provision of separate classes 
for the slow learners will have the effect of keeping stu¬ 
dents of the same age in the same classroom and should be a 
means of lessening this problem of social maladjustment. 

The repetition of a grade may result in both boredom and 
frustration for the student who repeats. Under the exper¬ 
imental plan, slow students do not repeat but proceed at a 
slower pace. The provision of separate classes should pro¬ 
vide the necessary opportunity to give these slow learners 
the individualized attention that they need. 

The ultimate extension of this plan, with special 
classes for slow learners, to Divisions II and III in the

school system could possibly be the means of reducing the 
problems of non-promotion in the Edmonton city system. 

VIII. THE NEED FOR FURTHER STUDY 

It is noted in this study that 128 boys as compared 
with eighty-four girls failed in grade seven during the years 
1951 and 1952. A cursory study of the promotion sheets for 
the Edmonton school system reveals that more boys than girls 
fail at most grade levels. A profitable area for study, but 
beyond the scope of this dissertation, would seem to be an 
inquiry into the reasons for more boys failing in school 
studies than do girls. 

Another area of study that would be profitable, and 
to which reference has already been made, is that of an 
evaluation of the two, three and four year programs being 
experimented with in Division I in the Edmonton city system, 
and their possible extension to Divisions II and III. There 
seem to be possibilities in this experiment, particularly 
with respect to some of the problems of non-promotion.
