ABSTRACT 


This study was carried out to determine the behavior 
of the univalent chromosomes of Triticum vulgare * at meiosis* 

In particular it was made to ascertain if differences or simi¬ 
larities of behavior existed among any of the 21 monosomes of 
Chinese Spring* The two major problems studied were the divi¬ 
sion of the univalent and the formation of micronuclei by the 
lagging univalent* 

Differences and similarities existed among the 21 mono¬ 
somes in regard to the percentages of the quartets containing 
micronuclei* ^he values obtained ranged from for Mono-X 

to 6^*2 % for Mono-11 * Little variability was observed between 
plants within a monosomic line or between florets, spikelets, 
or anthers within any particular plant* It was therefore con¬ 
cluded that the factor (or factors) regulating the formation 
of micronuclei was inherent within each univalent chromosome* 


The priority of Triticum aestivum L* for the common bearded 
wheat species is recognized* However, T*. vulgare Vill.as 
amended by Host has been accepted by most wheat specialists 
because it is more descriptive of this species*

The occurrence of micronuclei at the telo-interphase 
stage of division was noted. A correlation between the per¬ 
centage of quartets with micronuclei and the percentage of the 
telo-interphase cells with micronuclei was established for some 
but not all of the monosomes. 

Five other aberrations other than monosomies were 
found. Because in these plants a percentage of the quartets 
had micronuclei it was concluded that the presence of micronu¬ 
clei may not be too reliable an indication of the monosomic 
condition. 

Differences in sizes of univalents at metaphase I 
were established. No connection was found to exist between 
size of the monosome and the percentage of the quartets having 
micronuclei# 

From a study of the distribution of the chromosomes 
at anaphase I and telophase I, it was concluded that there is 
a definite cycle for orientation and disjunction of bivalents 
and a definite cycle for univalents. The bivalent cycle pre¬ 
cedes the univalent cycle and may exert an influence on the 
movement forces of the univalent.

THE BEHAVIOR OP THE UNIVALENT CHROMOSOMES OP 


MONOSOMIC TRITICUM VULGARE AT MEIOSIS 


J, W» Morrison 


INTRODUCTION 


During the first anaphase of normal meiosis bivalent 
chromosomes disjoin and migrate to opposite poles. If the chro¬ 
mosomal number includes a univalent chromosome there is no syn¬ 
aptic mate present to participate in this regular division and 
movement. It is recognized, therefore, that in plants which 
have univalent chromosomes the meiotic division will not proceed 
normally. This study was carried out to determine the behavior 
of the univalent chromosomes of monosomic Trlticum vulgare at 
meiosis * 

In particular the study was made to ascertain if dif¬ 
ferences or similarities of behavior existed among any of the 
twenty-one univalents of monosomic hexaploid wheat. It is 
apparent from the many published reports that there is still no

unanimity of opinion among cytologists regarding the behavior 
of the univalents at meiosis. It was felt that a study of single 
univalents would help to clarify the mechanism of their activity* 
It was thought too, that if there were major differences or 
similarities of behavior among certain chromosomes it would shed 
some light-on the chromosome homologies and thus on the phylogeny 
of T_* vulgare * 

The two main problems studied were (a) the division of 
the univalent and (b) the formation of micronuclei in the micros¬ 
pores by the lagging mivalent. The latter problem has b ecome 
particularly important because the presence of micronuclei in the 
quartets of microspores has been used as an indication of the 
monosomic condition. Similarly the division or misd.ivision of 
the univalent, as well as the products of any such division, 
would have a direct bearing on the stability of the monosome and 
thus on the results of fundamental wheat breeding problems in¬ 
volving the use of monosomic plants* 

In seeking an explanation for some of the results ob¬ 
tained, nearly all of the later phases of the meiotic cycle 
were examined. These observations are reported In this paper, 
together with information on the cytological technique employed 
in the examination of these phases of meiosis. 

In so far as they have a bearing on the question of 
univalent behavior, this report also Includes some cytological

observations on (a), a few additional aberrations other than 
monosomies and (b), normal wheat plants* 


LITERATURE REVIEW 


Monosomies 


Monosomic plants are deficient for an entire chromo¬ 
some* They have been obtained in several polyploid species* 

Unrau (24) gave a comprehensive review of the literature on 
monosomes and nullisomes* He also pointed out the advantages 
of their use for genetical studies in contrast to conventional 
methods* 

The credit for obtaining, developing and numbering of 
the various monosomes, and for visualizing their great possibili¬ 
ties for genetical and breeding work of common wheat must go to 
Dr* E* R* Sears* He pioneered this field of research with his 
publications (17, 18).

Presence of Micronuclei 


As indicated in the introduction, the presence of 
micronuclei in quartets has been used to identify monosomic 
plants. In 1932, Powers (10) examined the meiotic stages of 
monosomic plants and found that 23$ of the quartets had micro¬ 
nuclei. The majority of the quartets having micronuclei con¬ 
tained only 1, but some with 2, 3 and 4 were also observed* He 
concluded that the presence of more than 1 micronucleus was pro¬ 
bably caused by some other chromosomal aberration. He also re¬ 
ported the presence of micronuclei in lj2.ij$ of the quartets from 
a plant with a chromosomal complement of 19 ft 2*. Differences in 
the percentage of quartets with micronuclei occurred within an¬ 
thers; one count revealed that in the upper pollen sac 23*3$ and 
in the lower sac only 1.6$ of the quartets had micronuclei. 

In the same year Powers (11) reported that in Marquis 
wheat 0.8$ of the quartets had micronuclei, compared with 2.8$

in the variety Marquillo* A correlation was found to exist be¬ 
tween the non-orientation and non-conjunction of chromosomes* 

The occurrence of micronuclei was an indication of the frequency 
of both types of these aberrations* 

Myers and Powers (9), in 193$, found that in LjJ.-chromo¬ 
some wheat plants more than 20 % of the quartets had micronuclei* 
They also concluded that heritable differences affected the number 
of micronuclei formed in normal plants* The percentages of 
quartets with micronuclei ranged from 0*8$ in Thatcher to 8*3$ in 
Supreme* Significant differences between the dates of collection 
of microspores indicated that environment may also be a factor in 
determining the difference in meiotic irregularities* 

Love (8) found statistically significant differences 
in the frequencies of occurrence of micronuclei in quartets of 
1 $ wheat hybrids* The percentages varied from 82 to 100 and the 
mean number of micronuclei per quartet ranged from 1*6 to 

In 194-8 9 Howard (4-) used the presence of micronuclei 
as an indication of abnormalities in the Picton variety of oats* 

He suspected variations in the percentage of quartets with mi¬ 
cronuclei from late and early selected anthers* He found, how¬ 
ever, from an examination of four slides for a number of plants 
studied, that there were no significant differences* 

An investigation of the speltoid wheat of the B-series 
was conducted by Sanchez-Monge and MacKey (llj.), in 194-8* They

used the classification of Huskins for speltoids and as such the 
chromosome complement of the B-series consisted of IpO chromosomes 
and 1 univalent or I 4 .O chromosomes and 1 telocentric chromosome* 

In some of the quartets O-lp micronuclei were noted* When there 
were 3 micronuclei in the quartet, one was always smaller than the 
other two; when there were I 4 ., two of the micronuclei were smaller* 
While they did not report an actual percentage, the calculation 
from Table lj_, page 328, shows that 7 3 % of the quartets contained 
micronuclei* They attributed the formation of micronuclei to 
the lagging univalent* 


Behavior of Univalent Chromosomes 


The behavior of univalent or unpaired chromosomes has 
been reported by many authors ( 22 , 15 , 1 , 7 , 8 , 25 , 3 * l 6 , 26 , 
6 , 5> 21, 13)* Most of these dealt with the behavior of the 
univalents formed from interspecific or intergeneric crosses* 


Interspecific Crosses

the univalents arranged themselves at the equator in regular 
fashion and each then divided equationally. Only rarely did 
one remain near the pole without dividing* At metaphase II the 
univalents remained near the centre undivided and then moved 
slowly at random to one pole or the other* Because of tardiness, 
several univalents failed to become incorporated in the new 
nucleus and formed small micronuclei* 

Sax (15>), who studied the same cross, reported a dire¬ 
ctly contrasting behavior of the univalents* At anaphase I, the 
univalents passed undivided at random to the poles* At anaphase 
II, the division of the bivalents and univalents was normal and 
seldom were any lagging chromosomes found. Few quartets with 
micronuclei were found* 

According to Aase (1) most of the univalents of a tri- 
ploid divided at anaphase I* The number that actually separated 
depended upon their location on the spindle at the time the 
equatorial split began. 

Kihara (7) concluded that some univalents divide at 
first and lag at second division; others do not divide during 
first division but migrate at random to either pole* Those that 
divide at first division wandered at random to either pole in 
the second; the undivided univalents presumably divided normally. 

There is more agreement among cytologists regarding 
the behavior of pentaploid univalents. Sax (15), Thompson (22),

Kihara (7), and Love (8), found that most of the univalents 
orientated on the equatorial plate after the bivalents divided* 

The univalents then split and passed poleward* At anaphase II, 
the lagging chromosomes did not divide but passed, apparently at 
random, to either pole* Micronuclei were observed in a few of 
the quartets* Aase (1) reported that none to all of the univalents 
divided equationally and although quartet formation was regular, 
one or sometimes two small micronuclei were formed. 

Cytological studies of interspecific crosses in the 
genus Rubus L*, were made by Vaarama (25)* At metaphase I, 
univalents were scattered throughout the spindle* Some of them, 
apparently those which had lingered in the neighborhood of the 
poles, were included with the separated bivalents in the daughter 
nuclei* The remainder lagged near the plate, split and the halves 
moved poleward, but were usually not included in the interkinetic 
nuclei. 

Gajewski (3) reported irregular behavior of univalents 
at meiosis in five interspecific G-eum hybrids* In hybrids number 
1 and 2 , the 2-7 univalents mostly passed to the poles undivided 
at anaphase I* In hybrids 3 and I|_, the 11|. and 21 univalents re¬ 
spectively, lagged at the equator* Thereafter some divided, 
some passed poleward undivided and some remained passive in the 
cytoplasm. At interkinesis 12$ of the cells showed the apparent 
loss of chromosomes into the cytoplasm* After the bivalents 




. 



divided in hybrid number $ 9 some of the univalents (lj.2 univalents 
resulted from this cross) appeared to remain at the poles, others 
scattered on the spindle and the remaining few orientated at the 
plate. Those on the spindle moved uncha%ed to the poles; those 
at the plate divided. Gajewski suggested two main factors in¬ 
fluencing the univalent action. First, the difference in geno¬ 
typic constitution and secondly, the difference in numerical re¬ 
lationship between univalents and bivalents. 


Inter ge neric Crosses 

In a cross of Aegilops cylindrlca x Marquis (a common 
hexaploid wheat variety). Sax and Sax (l6), reported that at 
anaphase I, the univalents were most frequently grouped at the 
poles. There was some division of lagging univalents, however, 
but usually all were included in the daughter nuclei at telophase 
I. In the second division some laggards were observed. They 
suggested that if the univalents did not divide in the first di¬ 
vision they would divide in the second# 

Wakar (26) concluded that univalents resulting from a 
Triticum x Agropyron cross may go undivided to either pole at 
•random. There was marked lagging of chromosomes at the second 
division, ^he tardy chromosomes were transformed into lumps of 
chromatin (micronuclei). 










nd 





10 - 


Unpaired chromosomes arising from the cross of Triticum 
compactu m x Secale cereale sometimes split and moved to opposite 
poles or the two split halves moved to the same pole according 
to Kagawa and Chizaki (6)* In the second division, a great 
deal of irregularity of movement and lagging of chromosomes 
was observed and micronuclei frequently formed* 


Univalents in Monosomlc Plants 

Huskins (5), from an examination of a IpL-chromosome 
fatuoid oat plant, reported that in all of the 33 cells examined 
an univalent was lagging at the plate and splitting longitudin¬ 
ally at anaphase I* At telophase I, the halves of the univalent 
usually reached the poles before the nuclear membranes were 
formed* In a few of the cells, however, the daughter univalents 
were left out. In the second division there was usually one 
daughter univalent lagging at the plate in each of the daughter 
cells. Occasionally both were in one cell. The formation of 
quartets was not greatly affected although in a number, small 
dark bodies lying outside the nuclei were formed* These were 
likely split univalents which had failed to reach the poles be¬ 
fore nuclear membranes were formed* 

Smith et al (21) studied the behavior of chromosomes 
in a speltoid wheat plant with Z0 n 1*<, As the bivalents passed 












11 - 


toward the poles at early anaphase I, the univalent moved to 
the plate* Then the univalent “split” longitudinally and its 
halves proceeded to opposite poles but very frequently arrived 
too late to be included in the daughter nuclei* The occurrence 
of “unsplit” univalents or the inclusion of the two halves in 
one dyad nucleus was not observed although genet!cal evidence 
indicated that it did occur* While transverse fragmentation 
was not observed in this strain, there was genetical evidence 
that it must have occurred* During the second division the 
daughter univalents were either left out of the microspore nuclei 
or were included without further splitting* Prom l£0 pollen 
quartets it was calculated that 86$ of the pollen grains contained 
only 20 chromosomes* 


Movement of Chromosomes 


A more accurate knowledge of the complicated phenomena 
of chromosome movement would no doubt throw some light on the 
question of univalent behavior. Sanchez-Monge (13), suggested 
that the movement of the univalent, at anaphase I, towards the equ¬ 
ator was independent of centromeric forces* He concluded that nor¬ 
mal disjunction was the result of normal insertion of the spindle 
fibres and erroneous insertion led to the misdivision of the uni¬ 


valent

The material used in the preliminary study was 
collected in 19^9 and stored until used in May and June, 1950® 

In April, 19^0* seed from each of the 21 different lines was 
planted in the field at two different dates. Heads were col¬ 
lected for cytological study in June. All material was killed 
and fixed in Carnoy*s fluid A. All cytological observations 
were made from acetocarmine smear preparations as outlined by 
Smith (20). Some slight modifications employed are outlined 
in related following sections* 

Photomicrographs were taken from freshly prepared slides 
at magnifications ranging from 3&0 to 800 diameters. 


Examination for the Presence of Micronuclei in Quartets 


The preliminary count was made under the following 
conditions. Approximately 1000 quartets from each monosome were 
examined. The counts were made on any anthers that were found to 
be in the quartet stage and no distinction was attempted between 
different plants representing a monosome or between anthers, 
florets or spikelets of a plant* This examination was made at 
a magnification of 120 diameters. Quartets were designated as 
(a) with micronuclei and (b) without micronuclei, ^he use of a

partially blackened-out eyepiece to limit the size of the field 
was employed for a time but its use was found unsatisfactory* 

A second count was undertaken using a different pro¬ 
cedure* All three anthers from a floret of a monosomic plant 
were smeared on a slide. An attempt was made to study at least 
500 quartets per slide* Quartets were again classified into two 
categories but in those with micronuclei the number per quartet 
was noted* 

A critical stage of quartet development was selected 
from information gained during the preliminary count and from 
the subsequent second count. At the stage selected, the majority 
of the quartets showed the formation of the cell wall at telophase 
II, prior to splitting apart or rounding up of microspores* A 
clear wall surrounded each quartet at this stage* This stage 
could be recognized during the preliminary inspection of the 
anther smear and only those that were at this stage were examined 
in detail. (Pigs. 1 - 6, Plate 1, show quartets at the critical 
stage). 

In the preparation of a slide for counting only slight 
pressure on the cover slip could be exerted to prevent rupturing 
of the quartets. It was therefore necessary to focus at various 
levels because all parts of the cell were not in the same optical 
plane.

-Examination for the Presence of Micronuclei in 
Telo-interphase Cells 


Because wall formation at telophase I between the two 
daughter nuclei of a microsporocyte is not always definite and 
because cells at interphase in many instances had diffused nu¬ 
clei, the counts were made at a stage approximately midway be¬ 
tween the two (at telo-interphase)« The time lapse of division 
from anaphase I to metaphase II is very short. It was frequent¬ 
ly observed that all the cells from the three anthers were not 
at the same phase of division. A definite stage for examination 
was decided upon to insure accurate and comparable counts between 
different plants. At this stage both pre- and post-telo-inter¬ 
phase cells were present in approximately equal proportions with 
the majority of the cells at the desired stage. The telo-inter¬ 
phase cells were classified similarly to the quartets, i.e. (a) 
without and (b) with one micronucleus, etc. 

Although at this stage of division greater pressure on 
the cover slip could be applied than at the quartet stage, ex¬ 
cessive pressure ruptured the cells and made counting impossible. 
A magnification of 2lj.O diameters was found satisfactory.

Metaphase I 


Metaphase I was studied in determining which plants 
were monosomic# When the count of micronuclei in quartets was 
obviously irregular, the chromosome constitution was examined 
more closely# A magnification of $l\.0 diameters was used for 
most observations but some of the critical examinations were 
made using the oil immersion objective at a magnification of 
1080 diameters# 


Measurement of Metaphase I Univalents 


An attempt was made to determine the sizes of the 
various univalent chromosomes at metaphase I. The measurements 
were made with an eyepiece micrometer* For each monosome 30 
determinations were made at a magnification of 0 diameters#

Univalent Behavior at Anaphase I and Telophase I 


Anaphase I was studied to determine the distribution 
of bivalents and univalents at this phase* Where it was pos¬ 
sible, counts were made of the dyads and monads® The division 
of the univalent was studied in detail a 


Chromosomes at Metaphase II and Anaphase II 


While a thorough study of the chromosomes at this 
stage of division was not attempted, some observations were 
recorded® The position, possible fragmentation and distrib¬ 
ution of the chromosomes was examined in some detail but no

RESULTS AND OBSERVATIONS 


Preliminary Count 


The results of the preliminary count are given in 
Table 1# While there were variations from plant to plant in 
some monosomic lines, for others a set pattern seemed to be 
operative. There were indications that part of the variability 
was likely caused by examination of the quartets at different 
stages of development. Furthermore, all preliminary experiments 
led to the conclusion that a greater magnification was neces¬ 
sary for these examinations.

Second Count 


The difference between monosomes observed during the 
preliminary count suggested a definite behavior of univalents 
in the formation of micronuclei* It was felt that a more care¬ 
ful count at higher magnification and statistical analysis of 
results would confirm or disprove this hypothesis. 

In Table 2 , the results of the second count are recorded. 
Statistical analysis indicated that there were significant dif¬ 
ferences between some of the monosomes. In the comparison of 
the mean percentages of quartets with micronuclei of the various 
monosomes, with the results obtained in the preliminary count, 

9 out of 19 monosomes agreed within 3f°* The difference ranged 
from 1.1 to 18 .Prom the regularity of some lines and the 
irregularity of others, it was apparent that either the form¬ 
ation of micronuclei was uniform for some monosomes and not for 
others, or that these differences were caused by errors suggested 
from observations made during the preliminary count* 

The three major possibilities for error indicated from 
the preliminary observation were: 

1 * breaking up of quartets into dispersed microspores, 

2 . loss of micronuclei by isolation of microcytes (miniature 
microspores), 

3 * disappearance of micronuclei by absorption into the cyto¬ 
plasm or the nucleus.

It was realized during the second count that break¬ 
ing up of the quartets was responsible for some of the varia¬ 
bility within plants of a certain monosome# 


Determination of the Critical Stage 


It was decided to make further counts of quartets from 
individual plants to see if there were variations within one spike 
and to see if any evidence could be found to substantiate the 
suggested possibilities for error. In any event a critical stage 
had to be established to keep future counts comparable® 

For this study, plant 98 A-2, Mono-III, was selected. 

The results are summarized in Table There was a tendency for 
the formation of microcytes at older stages of development of 
some of the quartets# Even with the slight pressure used to clear 
a slide of air bubbles, some microcytes were forced out of the 
quartet arrangement and would therefore be missed in counting, 
(Figs, 2, 3 9 4 and 5>, Plate 2, illustrate some of the conditions 
observed). When these counts were being made the stage for each 
count was designated as young when no breaking up had occurred 
and as old when a number of quartets had broken up# Ihe difference 
between counts of old and young quartets was striking. Statistical 
analysis revealed that counts 1 and ij. were significantly below the 
other three. The lower percentage of quartets with micronuclei in 
counts 1 and I4. was undoubtedly brought about by a loss of micro¬ 
cytes in older quartets,

As a further check on the correctness of this con¬ 
clusion, a number of counts were made using plant 97A-21, Mono-II* 
Here the stages were designated as young or old (reliable or 
unreliable) before the count was made* The results in Table 3 
show that counts were similar when the stage designated as young 
or reliable was examined* When an old stage was counted, the 
percentage of quartets with micronuclei was significantly lowered* 
The possibility that micronuclei were absorbed at later 
stages of quartet development was not disregarded* An examin¬ 
ation of dispersed microspores revealed the presence of micro- 
nuclei© This examination was extended to later developmental 
stages, where some of the microspores had formed cellulose 
intine walls. The micronuclei, when present, were small dark 
bodies and indistinguishable from the micronuclei observed in 
quartet microspores* It appears probable that micronuclei can 
be lost from microspores prior to intine wall formation. 

Results similar to those reported above have been ob¬ 
tained by other workers. Frankel (2) reported that microcytes 
were formed from lagging centric and acentric fragments of wheat 
chromosomes* Thompson and Hollingshead (23) found a slight de¬ 
crease in number of micronuclei from the conclusion of second 
division to the separation of microspores* These two authors 
believed that micronuclei were reabsorbed by nuclei, or that 
they degenerate.

Counts Within Monosomic Plants 


The hypothesis that the formation of micronuclei was 
uniform within one plant was further confirmed by the results 
given in Table Ij.* Most of these counts were made after the 
critical stage had been decided upon* ^he variability observed 
between counts of the same plant was non-significant* 

These results agreed with the results obtained by 
Howard, but are seemingly contradictory to the conclusions of 
Powers (c*f* literature review)* The regularity of the form¬ 
ation of micronuclei in different florets of the same plant 
suggested a regular formation in the individual anthers* A 
study of single anthers was made and the results are given 
in Table No statistical analysis is necessary to show the 
similarities between the three anthers of the one floreto 

These results, therefore, indicate that within any 
spike, micronuclei are formed with equal frequency in the var¬ 
ious florets or anthers*

Pinal Count of Quartets for the Twenty-one Monosomes 


After the establishment of a critical stage of quartet 
development and with the practice acquired from previous count¬ 
ing, it was decided to make final quartet counts of three dif¬ 
ferent plants for each monosome. The percentages of quartets 
with micronuclei for each of the different lines are tabulated 
in Table 6. The monosomes are listed in order of increasing 
frequency of quartets with micronuclei* 

Although approximately 20 heads were fixed and stored 
for each monosome, in some lines more normal plants than were 
expected on the basis of 75:25~distribution (Sears (18)) were 
present* This can partly be explained on the basis that some 
monosomic plants do not mature as early as normal plants* The 
random selection included more of these normal plants* Con¬ 
sequently, only two monosomic plants were available for mono¬ 
somes, VIII, IX, XIII, XV and XVII, for this count* In order 
that the estimation of the means for this final count could 
be kept comparable, one of the counts obtained in the previous 
study was included for each of the five monosomes*

With the exception of Mono-XIX, the differences in 
means obtained in the second and final count were within a range 
of 0• 4- ‘ to 6.6$o In Mono-XIX, There the difference was 2$%, it 
was possible to determine the cause of this difference« One of 
the plants used in the second count had been saved and two fur¬ 
ther examinations of quartets at the critical stage were made* 
The percentages of quartets with micronuclei were and 63% 

respectively® Likely the second count in both plants was made 
from an unsuitable (too old) stage of the quartet development® 

Analysis of variance showed a significant difference 
between chromosomes* Inspection of the plant results shows that 
very little variability existed between plants of the same 
monosome® 

In Table 7 the distribution of quartets containing from 
1 to over Ip micronuclei is shown* (Pigs* 2, 3» k -9 5* 6 , Plate 
1 and Pig. 1, Plate 2, show quartets with different numbers of 
micronuclei)® The significance and probable source of the higher 
nunbers of micronuclei per quartet will be discussed in a later 


section

Additional Aberrations in Monosomic Lines 


The presence of micronuclei was frequently used as an 
indication that a plant was monosomic, when selecting anthers for 
quartet examination# In all cases, however, metaphase I was 
studied to verify this supposition. Frequently this latter study 
was made after the quartet count had been established. This 
procedure was followed with plant l^-H in which 79 °f the 
quartets had micronuclei. The metaphase examination revealed the 
constitution of this plant to be 19 " 2 * and not 20 !t 1 *, as was 
expected (Fig. ij., Plate 1].). In three other plants, aberrations 
other than the monosomic condition were found. (Fig# 5, Plate Ip, 
shows the chromosomal complement of plant 09-A.) The percentages 
of quartets with micronuclei were established for four of these 
plants and are recorded in Table 8 . 

Of the four plants studied, the presence of extra univa¬ 
lents or fragments caused a marked Increase in the number of quartets 
with micronuclei. The presence of a fragment increased the per¬ 
centage by approximately 20# The number of micronuclei varied from 
0 to 9 . In plant 09-A, one further count was made to determine if 
this aberrant condition affected the formation of micronuclei uniform¬ 
ly throughout the spike. The results obtained indicate a regular 
formation within this plant.

Normal Chinese Spring 


Counts of quartets were made from normal Chinese Spring 
plants to ascertain if micronuclei were present and if so, in what 
proportions* These results are presented in Table 9* There were no 
statistical differences between the counts involving five different 
plants# The number of micronuclei per quartet varied from 0 to lj_ and 
of the quartets having micronuclei, 55*6$ had 1, 31*2$ had 2, 9$ had 
3 and had Ij. micronuclei*

Telo-interphase Counts 


During the examination of anther smears, it was noted 
that micronuclei were also present at the telo-interphase stage 
of cell division. In a count of lOl^lj- cells from three normal 
Chinese Spring plants, 53 or had micronuclei. As this fre¬ 

quency was similar to the percentage of quartets with micro- 
nuclei ( 5 * 0 /£)> counts were made to determine if in monosomic 
plants a correlation existed between the number of quartets with 
micronuclei and the number of telo-interphase cells with micro¬ 
nuclei. Twenty-six plants from six different monosomes were stu¬ 
died and the results are summarized in Table 10.

With the exception of the count from plant I 4 . in Mono- 
XII, the differences between plants of any monosome were not 
significant* The count of plant Ij. was just significantly lower 
than plant 3* Since this was the only exception, it was con¬ 
cluded that this exception was not too important. 

The correlation between the percentage of telo-inter- 
phase cells with micronuclei and the final computed percentage 
of the quartets with micronuclei was not significant (r =* +. 687 )* 
Examination of the results in Table 10 reveals that this low 
correlation value was greatly affected by the results of Mono- 
XII and Mono-IV. The correlation of the four remaining monosomes 
was highly significant (r = +* 992 )* 

Analysis of variance indicated that there were signi¬ 
ficant differences between some of the monosomes in the number 
of micronuclei observed at telo-interphase. 

The distribution of the telo-interphase cells having 
micronuclei is given in Table 11. (Pigs. 1-6, Plate 3* show 
cells with different numbers of micronuclei). Three and If. 
micronculei per cell were observed but in only one cell out of 
over 3,000 were more than Ij. micronuclei found. It is striking, 
that in telo-interphase the proportions of cells with 1 and 2 
micronuclei are not very dissimilar in different monosomes. It 
will be recalled that in the quartet study, there were very marked 
differences between the various monosomes.

Metaphase I 


In the majority of cells at metaphase I, the univalents 
were lying off the metaphase plate* This is in agreement with 
the observations of other workers (c*f* literature review)* 

Metaphase I of l6 plants representing four different 
monosomes was studied in detail with the objective of determining 
if irregular chromosome behavior (in addition to the univalent) 
was associated with quartet differences between monosomes• These 
results are presented in Table 12 * (Fig* 3 > Plate I|_, shows the 
metaphase configuration of 19” 3 1 )* 

No significant differences were demonstrated between 
Mono-VIII and Mono-XX or between Mono-XII and Mono-XXI which had 
counts of 34*3> 63*3* 4° *4 and 44*9$ of the quartets with micro¬ 
nuclei respectively©

Metaphase I Measurement of Univalent Chromosomes 


The mean lengths and widths of six monosomes at metaphase 

I are given in Table 13 * A statistical analysis of the original 
micrometer readings showed that there were significant size dif¬ 
ferences between the univalent chromosomes* Comparisons were 
made using length and also the product of length x width* In 
both analyses, chromosome-XVIII was significantly smaller than 
all the others* No difference could be shown between chromosome- 

II and XII, or between XXI and VIII*

Chromosomes at Anaphase I and Telophase I 


The anaphase observations recorded in Table lip show 
the various stages of normal and univalent chromosome movement 
that were thought to be most important* Because of the small 
number of counts and the error involved in classification, also 
the similarities of some classes, all results were examined on 
the basis of total counts* 

In 165 cells in which the chromosomes could be clearly 
counted, none wes found that had 21 chromosomes (20 dyad,s and 
one monad) at each pole* It can therefore be assumed from this 
count that the univalent often moves to the pole undivided. That 
each of the two daughter nuclei may eventually contain 20 dyads 
and one univalent chromatid is of course possible* The probab¬ 
ility that the univalent which was lying in the centre (class 
No. 2 )would split and pass poleward was indicated by classes 3 
and ip* It can be safely assumed, ho?/ever, that if the univalent 
does split, it does so after the bivalents have passed towards the 
poles. A partial split of the monosome was evident in some cells 
but the complete longitudinal separation and disjunction to the 
poles did not commence until after the bivalents disjoined. This 
characteristic behavior was observed even when it appeared that 
the univalent had orientated with the bivalents at metaphase. 

(Pig* ip, Plate 5 )* This indicates that the bivalents and the uni¬ 
valents behaved precociously and mitotically respectively.

The possibility of both halves of the univalent being 
included in one nucleus was indicated by class No# Ij. where 23#4$ 
of the cells show the chromatids going to one pole# If both were 
not included with the nucleus, the cell would have 2 micronuclei; 
if only one was included, a cell with 1 micronucleus would result# 
Fragmentation of the univalent occurred in 12 or 
of the telophase cells examined# Because of the position of the 
micronuclei in telo-interphase stages it was assumed that this 
fragmentation was the cause of at least some of the telo-inter¬ 
phase cells with 3-ij. and Lj. micronuclei# Ihe difference in size 
of fragments was manifested in the size of the micronuclei# 

The other laggards observed at anaphase I could partly 
be explained by tardy disjunction of bivalents# There were, how¬ 
ever, cells in which it was definitely observed that the laggards 
resembled univalent chromosomes in that they had the characteristic 
longitudinal split into chromatids# 

Other observations noted but not tabulated were: 

1# appearance of only one partner of a split chromosome outside 
of the two daughter nuclei (Fig# 1, Plate 7)> 

2# appearance of a partially split chromosome, presumably being 
held together at the unsplit centromere, (Fig# 2, Plate 7)$ 

3# Cells in which the dyads or univalents could not be counted 
but because there were no laggards it was assumed that a dis¬ 
tribution of 21--20 had taken place# 

In Plates 5, 6 and 7 > some of the observations of ana¬ 


phase I are illustrated

Metaphase II and Anaphase II Observations 


While paucity of material did not permit a thorough 
examination of chromosomes at metaphase II and anaphase II, 
several observations of these stages were recordedo 

1* In many cells the univalent chromatids which had formed 
micronuclei in the first division failed to orientate at 
second metaphase. The micronuclei resolved into chromosomal 
structure but appeared to remain passive in the cytoplasm 
remaining in the same position that they occupied at the 
end of the first division (Pig. 1, Plate 8). 

2o The split univalent chromosome was found with both chromatids 
in one cell or with one chromatid in each daughter cell, 
(Pigs. 1 and 2, Plate 10)* 

3* Counts of chromosomes at anaphase II, indicated the possib¬ 
ility of having microspores with either 20 or 21 and even 
22 chromosomes (Plate 9 )* In. Pig* 5 * Plate 9 > because 
no micronuclei were present and the lower cell had 20 
chromosomes at each pole, it was assumed that in each nu¬ 
cleus of the upper daughter cell there were 21 chromosomes.

4<> Morphological and size differences existed among the 
chromosomes (Fig. 2, Plate 8). 

5* Bridges or apparent bridges resulting from the stretching 
of a dicentric univalent were frequently formed (Fig. 3> 
Plate 9)a 

6. The misdivision of the univalent occurred more frequently 

at second division than at first division. In the majority 
of cells the fragmentation occurred in a definite place in 
the chromosomes. The likely point of breakage was at the 
centromere (Fig* Plate 10) 0

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS 


The apparent irregularities among plants of a parti¬ 
cular monosome for the formation of micronuclei in the quartets 
of microspores, observed in some of the preliminary and second 
counts, were an indication that some error was involved in 
classification. Counts of quartets from anthers of plants 97A- 
21 and 9^A-2, showed that a random selection of anthers was un¬ 
satisfactory in the evaluation of the percentage of quartets 
having micronuclei. The greatest sources of error involved were 

(a) the breaking up of quartets into dispersed microspores and 

(b) the loss of microcytes from the quartet arrangement. 
Although there was some evidence that micronuclei were absorbed 

by the cytoplasm, the loss of micronuclei in this manner was too 
sm a ll to affect greatly the quartet counts. The variations 
caused by the above mentioned sources were eliminated when a 
critical stage was used. 

It was confirmed by further counts that the regulating 
factor for the formation of micronuclei was uniformly active 
throughout the spike. The plants for which this uniformity was 
established were selected at random from the monosomic lines. 
While only nine plants were studied, it is reasonable to assume 
that this factor operated similarly in all plants of a monosome.

From the results of individual anther counts it was concluded 
that the force influencing formation of micronuclei was simi¬ 
lar in different anthers of a floret. No evidence was found to 
support the theory (10) that variability existed within an 
anther. The regularity between plants of the same monosome for 
the formation of micronuclei in quartets showed that the forces 
or factors contributing to this formation were inherent within 
the particular monosomeo 

Sears (18) numbered the monosomes in the order in which 
he obtained them. They were designated I to XIV if belonging to 
the tetraploid series, and XV to XXI if they were in the 0 genome. 
From the compensating effect of Tetrasomic-II, Nullisomic-XX, 
and from phenotypic observations such as male and female steril¬ 
ity of monosomies and nullisomics. Sears (19) suggested possible 
homoeology between Mono-II, XX and XIII* Similarly he postu¬ 
lated the association of Mono-VII, XI and XXI; VI, X and. XIX; 
and III, XII and Mono-XVI, There is no statistical difference 
between the percentages of micronuclei observed for the mono- 
some s of series 1 and 2, In the other suggested series no 
similarity between these chromosomes was indicated by the micro¬ 
nuclei count# 

The limitations of this approach to a study of chromo¬ 
some homologies and phylogeny were indicated by the estimations 
for the chromosomes in the C genome. The lowest value obtained

was l\.0% and in five of them over 5>0$ of the quartets had micro¬ 
nuclei. Sears (19) tas suggested that hexaploid wheat arose from 
a common progenitor# The process of evolution involved first, 
divergence into related genera, and then convergence through 
allopolyploidy into the present day hexaploid wheats# During 
the process of divergence and convergence the constitution of 
some chromosomes may have been altered more in one genome than 
in another# Whether the formation of micronuclei can he taken 
as an indicator of homology, is of course a matter of conjecture# 
Certainly one should not hesitate to associate two chromosomes 
even if counts between them are significantly different. Dif¬ 
ferences as large as 1$ to 30$ (and consistent differences) are, 
hov/ever, likely reflections of diverse material carried by 
such chromosomes# 

If the formation of micronuclei were influenced by an 
internal force it would be expected that a correlation could be 
established between the number of micronuclei in the telo-inter¬ 
phase cells and in the quartets of microspores. This was demon¬ 
strated for only four of the six monosomes studied# However, 
the lack of great variability between counts of the same 
monosomic plants lends weight to the theory that some set force 
is operative for each chromosome. At the moment there appears 
to be no adequate explanation to account for the results obtained

for Mono-IV and Mono-XII* ^t may be that the force (or forces) 
acting on univalent chromosomes is not entirely similar at all 
phases of cell division for the different chromosomes# Con¬ 
sequently, frequency of micronuclei formation in the two stages 
studied may thereby be differentially affected* 

One fact was clearly shown* There were more telo- 
interphase cells with one micronucleus than there were'*’quartets. 
More misdivision or lagging of univalents occurred in the second 
division than in the first which would largely account for the 
difference# For all the monosomes the pattern for 3 micronuclei, 
and over L|_ micronuclei was very similar, in both the quartets 
and the telo-interphase cells* 

The cause of different numbers of micronuclei per 
quartet should be briefly discussed# 

Some possible sources of 1 micronucleus per quartet are 

1. complete failure of conjunction and disjunction of the uni¬ 
valent, 

2. longitudinal division of the univalent at anaphase I and 
inclusion of only one chromatid at telophase II, 

3* fragmentation at either first or second division and inclu¬ 
sion of all but one fragment# 

Some possible sources of 2 micronuclei per quartet are: 

1# longitudinal division at anaphase I and failure of inclu¬ 
sion of both chromatids at telophase II, 

2# inclusion of one chromatid at second division but fragmen¬ 
tation of the daughter chromatid and failure of inclusion of 
both fragments.

3* fragmentation at either division and inclusion of all but 
2 fragments# 

Some possible sources of 3 micronuclei per quartet 

are: 

I© longitudinal division at anaphase I and subsequent frag¬ 
mentation of one chromatid at second division with all 
three portions being left out at telophase II, 

2# bipartite fragmentation of both chromatids and inclusion 
of only 1 fragment, 

3# fragmentation at first division of one chromatid and 

subsequent failure of inclusion of all three portions in 
second division# 

A possible source of 1{_ micronuclei per quartet is: 

1# bipartite fragmentation of univalent chromatids and ex¬ 
clusion of all fragments at telophase II# 

The lagging caused by non-conjunction and non-dis¬ 
junction of bivalents or univalents other than the monosomes 
(other laggards observed at anaphase I) could cause over ij. 
micronuclei per quartet. Such additional laggards could be 
responsible for various numbers of micronuclei, since they also 
could undergo fragmentation# Additional laggards present 
with the normal monosome could also cause the formation of one 


or more micronuclei in quartets

The presence of five aberrations, other than the mono- 
some, representing approximately 5% of the plants studied, 
suggests that the stability of the monosome may not be too great. 
Because micronuclei were observed in the quartets of these 
plants it also indicates that the presence or even the percent¬ 
age of micronuclei as a criterion of the monosomic condition 
is not a completely reliable practice* 

Myers and Powers (9) suggested that the frequency 
of formation of micronuclei may be a measure of the stability 
of a variety* ^he fairly high value obtained for Chinese Spring 
may be some indication of its lack of complete stability* 

The micronuclei in normal 21 paired wheat must be the 
result of some weak pairing, predisjunction or non-conjunction of 
bivalents and univalents. Perhaps secondary pairing occurred 
between slightly homologous chromosomes of different genomes or 
even within genomes and thus unpaired univalents might be present* 
No difference in frequency could be demonstrated be¬ 
tween Mono-VIII and Mono-XX, regarding the metaphase configur¬ 
ation of 20 f! 1» and 19 n 3 T « There was no similarity regarding 
the percentage of micronuclei formed in these two chromosomes* 

It was therefore assumed that no connection existed between the 
frequency of 19 ,f 3 1 observed and the percentage of micronuclei 
’formed in quartets*

In plants with very small or numerous chromosomes it 
is often possible to use morphology as a character in the study 
of relationships. In T_. vulgare there are three genomes and it 
may be possible to associate chromosomes or to distinguish each 
genome by morphological structure and size of the chromosomes. 
Differences in size of the univalents were demonstrated by 
metaphase I measurements. As shown by Fig# 2, Plate 8, the 
morphological difference between chromosomes is more apparent 
at anaphase II. A critical study in rnonosomic plants at this 
phase would possibly yield more information on chromosome homo¬ 
logy if this is reflected by the chromosome size and morphology. 

Some theories of chromosome movement involve the 
influence of the mass or physical condition of the chromosome* 
Sanchez-Monge (13) attributed the movement of the univalent to 
the metaphase plate to cytoplasmic currents. If mass h a s an 
effect on movement it is reasonable to assume that larger bodies 
might lag to a greater extent than smaller ones. Prom the 
measurements made at metaphase I, however, no correlation be¬ 
tween size of monosomes and the number of micronuclei formed 

*7 

could be demonstrated. 

The difficulty of interpreting results from fixed 
material is that the worker can only postulate the progressive 
behavior of the univalent from one stage to another by the

observations of the intermediate stages. Prom a study of 
anaphase I the following conclusions were made: 

1® There is a definite cycle for bivalent orientation and dis¬ 
junction and a definite cycle for univalents. The division 
of the univalent does not occur until after the bivalents 
have disjoined. Or in other words, the bivalents and uni¬ 
valents behave precociously and mitotically respectively. 

2* The univalent moves towards the plate (presumably under the 
same orientation force to which bivalents are subjected) but 
often does not reach it before the phase of poleward movement 
is started. 

3. If the univalent does not orientate the separation is usually 
not completed and the univalent moves to the nearest pole. 

If the univalent is near the metaphase plate and splitting 
when poleward movement sets in, both halves likely move to 
the same pole* One or both may be either included or left 
out of the nearest daughter nucleus. If the univalent orien¬ 
tates on the plate, splitting is completed and the halves 
pass towards opposite poles. Again one or both may fail 
to be included within the membrane of the daughter nucleus*

1|_« Fragmentation from orientated or non-orientated univalents 
is possible and from observed constrictions the likely point 
of breakage is at the centromere# 

After making allowances for sources of variability 
including personal error of observations and natural variations 
in plant material, it is clear that differences and similarities 
of behavior occurred among the 21 univalents of monosomic T#
