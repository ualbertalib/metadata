STUDIES OF SEED INJURY IN CEREALS RESULTING 


FROM SEED TREATMENT* 


By 

J. B* Skaptason 


INTRODUCTION. 


Historical Review , 

Seed treatment for the prevention of bunt, by 
one method or another, haa been practised for nearly three 
centuries* Before the true nature of the disease was known 
many of the more intelligent farmers conceived methods of 
seed treatment on the theory that the seed needed a stimulus 
to enable it to resist the disease, hence the use of fer¬ 
menting animal manures* With the idea of the infective nat¬ 
ure of smut came the use of toxins* The origin of the use 

i 

of copper sulphate has been generally credited to Kuhn, but 
he makes no claim to originality and credits it to Prevost, 
who in turn passes it back to Tessier (50)* 

Guether suggested the use of formaldehyde as a 
sterilizer or sterilizing agent in combatting smuts in gen¬ 
eral and supported his recommendation with experimental 
evidence (15)* Bolley (4) gives the results of laboratory 
and field experiments in the treatment of seed wheat for the 
years 1893 to 1896 inclusive. In these experiments he used 
copper sulphate, mercuric chloride, hot water and formalde¬ 
hyde. This is the first recorded use of formaldehyde in the

United States as a fungicide for the prevention of hunt* 

He considered corrosive sublimate superior to all fungicides, 
with the probable exception of formaldehyde which at the time 
had received only preliminary tests* 

Prom 1900 to 1903 Parrer (10) carried on extensive 
seed treatment experiments in Austrailia from which he con¬ 
cluded: "1. Copper sulphate was fairly efficient in kill¬ 
ing the spores on the grain, and although it was more injur¬ 
ious to the seed than either formaldehyde or mercuric chloride, 
it furnished greater protection against reinfestation. 2. For¬ 
maldehyde was cheap, effectual and safe, and compared to copper 
sulphate was non-injurious to the seed, but afforded no pro¬ 
tection against reinf©station. M Following this and findings 
of other workers, the use of either copper sulphate or for¬ 
maldehyde has been determined largely by local practices* 

More recently however, formaldehyde appears to have been fav¬ 
ored and used almost in all countries where seed treatment 
for bunt is necessary* This is accounted for by its cheap¬ 
ness, ease of handling and its lees injurious effects than 
copper sulphate* Within the last few years these fungicides 
are being replaced by various mercurial compounds used in dry 
form and diluted with inert dusts* Due to their costs how¬ 
ever, it will probably be sometime before they become gener¬ 
ally used. 

During the forty years approximately that formal¬ 
dehyde has been used as a dip or spray, as a gas, Perdrix (24), 
Thomas (29) or with steam, Melhus (23) reports have differed

radically in the degree of favor with which it has been view¬ 
ed. Varying degrees of injury have been reported by various 
workers. Other workers again, principally Stewart and Steph¬ 
ens (29) noted vitality reduction in wheat, oats and barley, 
but thought the advantages outweighed the injury* 

That formaldehyde does cause seed injury is obvious 
from the results of findings of many workers natably, Hurd (17), 
Brittlebank (6), Brown (7), Coons and McKinney (8), Cranefield 
(9) and many others. The importance of this injury becomes at 
once apparent when one realizes that formaldehyde is being used 
for smut prevention in all the major wheat growing areas of the 
world and probably more than any other fungicide in western 
Canada* 

One of the modem trends in plant pathology is a 
search for chemicals which are efficient fungicides and free 
from injurious effects. Formaldehyde is a cheap and efficient 
fungicide but it usually has some injurious effect on the grain* 
It is being realized now that besides formaldehyde having a 
direct injurious effect on germination it may occasion certain 
indirect effects for example in delaying emergence, increasing 
severity of damage from molds, and rendering plants more sus¬ 
ceptible to adverse conditions in the spring. These indirect 
injurious effects from the formaldehyde treatment of seed may 
be of equal or greater importance than its direct effects. 

Object of investigation * 

This investigation has been confined to a study of 
formaldehyde seed treatment because of the general use of this

fungicide and because of its known injurious effects. The 
project was undertaken for the purpose of investigating the 
following aspects of formaldehyde seed injury viz: 

1. Factors affecting formaldehyde seed injury* 

2. The effect of formaldehyde seed injury on 
the development of certain diseases. 

3* A study of cereal varietal reaction to for¬ 
maldehyde seed injury* 

4* A study of the nature of formaldehyde seed 
injury with particular reference to dias- 
tatic activity. 

FACTORS AFFECTING FORMALDEHYDE SEED INJURY. 


Literature Review. 

A number of factors have been shown to influence 
the severity of seed injury by formaldehyde* Delay in sowing 
after treatment and sowing in unduly dry soil were found by 
Miss Hurd (17) to increase the injurious effects. This author 
believes that when seeds are treated in formaldehyde and sub** 
sequently allowed to dry the polymer paraformaldehyde is de¬ 
posited on the seed coat with serious eventual consequences* 
Probably the greatest injury from formaldehyde treatment 
occurs on grain which has been mechanically injured from 
machine threshing. Hurd (17) reports twice as much damage 
in machine threshed grain as hand threshed material, and that

the greatest injury occurs when the seed is broken over the 
embryo* It has been shown by Hurd (17), Braun (5), Atwood 
(l) and many others that injury increases proportionately 
with an increase in the concentration of the formaldehyde* 
Hurd reports no injury from the recommended 1-320 concen¬ 
tration of formaldehyde or even from 2-320 concentration 
where treatment consists in immersion of the grain for 10 
minutes and for periods up as high as 8 hours* Atwood (1) 
reports the first decrease in emergence with 20 minutes 
immersion in formaldehyde of 1-320 concentration* Hurd (17) 
considers humidity to be the determining factor in seed in¬ 
jury* The formation of paraformaldehyde was dependent on 
the dryness of the atmosphere* She shows that there was no 
injury in the damper atmosphere of a 70^ humidity and over* 
Other factors, such as maturity of the grain when harvested, 
viability of the seed, conditions under which the crop was 
raised, influence the amount of injury from seed treatment* 

Effect of Soil Temperature* 


The soil-temperature factor was chosen for study 
since equipment was available and since it seemed a factor 
which might be of considerable importance under field con¬ 
ditions* ISost of the wheat sown in western Canada is sown 
in the spring when the soil temperature is relatively low, 
whereas the coarse grains are sown somewhat later in soil of 
slightly higher temperature* These studies were made with 
wheat*

Experimental Methods * 

The experiment v/as conducted in soil temperature 
tanks in which constant temperatures from 10° to 30° C. were 
maintained* Soil moisture was kept constant for all temper¬ 
atures. It was maintained at a minimum for germination since 
dry soil is known to favor seed injury hy formaldehyde. The 
soil was made up of three parts of Edmonton "black soil plus 
one part of sand, and not sterilized# 

Marquis wheat from the 1933 crop was used. The 
seed was treated by immersion for one-half minute in formal¬ 
dehyde solution, or in the case of the checks in distilled 
water, then covered for four hours with bags and dried* Two 
concentrations of formaldehyde were tested, 1-320 (recommended 
commonly for the treatment of cereal seeds) and 2-320. The 
seed was planted immediately# After allowance of sufficient 
time for the seedlings to emerge counts were made of the per¬ 
centage of seedling emergence, and by taking the difference 
between the figures for the treated lots and those of the 
check the per-cent seed injury was calculated.

It will be seen from these that seed injury was more 
pronounced at the lower soil temperatures than at the higher* and 
especially so at 15°G* This happens to be about the average soil 
temperature at which much of the wheat is often seeded in the 
Edmonton district* For instance* the. average soil temperature 
at seeding depth between April 20th and May 10th in 1934 was 
13°C* Further tests at low temperatures, however, should be 
made in order to determine more accurately where the maximum 
injury occurs* The results so far are in agreement with those 
of Gassner (13) who states that formaldehyde causes greater 
damage at the lower temperatures than the higher, while the 
reverse is true for mercurial dust preparations*

EFFECT OF CHEMICAL SEED INJURY ON THE DEVELOPMENT 
OP CERTAIN DISEASES. 


Wheat seedlings handicapped in their early stages 
of growth by various kinds of injury to the seed are render¬ 
ed more susceptible to invasion from saprophytic and para¬ 
sitic organisms. The attempted study here is an effort to 
determine the effect of chemical seed injury. Prom formal¬ 
dehyde treatment, on the subsequent disease development from 
pathogenic organisms common to Alberta soils* The specific 
investigation was outlined to include various degrees of 
seed injury caused by different concentrations of formalde¬ 
hyde and also the severity of damage from two groups of fungi 
viz: seed-borne and soil-borne organisms. 

Literature Review . 

Geuther (14) found treatment with mercuric chloride 
a perfect protective against PenicilIlian and Pusarlam , while 
formaldehyde promoted the attack of these fungi. The work of 
Kurd (18) indicates that either chemical injury by or 

formaldehyde, or mechanical injury render germinating wheat 
kernels more susceptible to molds. Maehacek and Oreaney (20) 
report increased injury from foot-rots when mechanically in¬ 
jured seed was used over that when normal kernels were used. 

Mead (22) has recently reported that seedlings from seed in¬ 
jured by various agents including rust, drought, frost, sprout¬ 
ing and formaldehyde were more susceptible to attack by 
Helminthosporium sativum than were seedlings from normal kernel a

Influence on Diseases Caused by Seed-Borne 
Organisms* 


In the following experiments Kelminthosporium and 
Fusarium were used as seed-borne organisms* Spore suspen¬ 
sions were prepared and the spores sprayed on to seed which 
had previously been injured with different concentrations of 
formaldehyde* The spores of the bunt fungi were shaken up 
with the seed in envelopes just previous to planting* It was 
thought that the formaldehyde might exhibit different residual 
effects on fungus spores which were in contact with the chemical 
on the seed than those which were not as in the case of 
Ophiobolus and Pythium * 

Formaldehyde seed injury in relation to the 
severity of foot-rot diseases of wheat caused by 
Helminthosporium sativum P*K* and B* and Fusarium 
graminearum Schwabe* 

Experimental Methods * 

Marquis wheat from the 1933 crop was used through¬ 
out for this experiment* Lots of the wheat were treated with 
formaldehyde of the following concentrations* 1 part of com¬ 
mercial formaldehyde [37%) to 360 parts of water, 1-320, 2-320, 
and 3-320* The check was treated with distilled water* Treat¬ 
ment consisted of immersion in the formaldehyde solution for

2 minutes followed by a covering of four hours with moist 
sacks* The seed was then allowed to dry over night* Next 
morning separate lots were inoculated with spore suspensions 
of Fusarium graminearum and Helminthosporium sativum as 
follows: suspensions were made up from 15-day old cultures 

in sterile water, and sprayed on the seed with an atomizer* 

The seed was then placed immediately in a desiccator where 
it was allowed to dry for 24 hours* It was then planted, 25 
seeds per pot, in sterilized soil, which consisted of 3 parts 
Edmonton black soil plus 1 part sand* The experiment was re¬ 
plicated 10 times* The plants were harvested after 21 days, 
and notes taken on emergence, height and infection rating of 
individual plants* 

Experimental Results * 

Data on emergence, height and infection rating are 
presented in Table TT* Percentage emergence is calculated on 
the basis of the number of surviving plants from uninoculated 
water treated seed which is taken as 10G$* Height figures 
represent the average height of surviving plants in centimeters* 
Infection rating is a numerical estimation taking into consider¬ 
ation the percentage of plants which did not emerge and the 
extent of necrosis of the crown, mesocotyl and primary root 
system*

Emergence* 

On taking notes on emergence it was evident that 
germination was delayed 1 to \\ days by the 3-320 concen¬ 
tration of formaldehyde in comparison with the check* In¬ 
termediate delays were caused by the other concentrations* 
Emergence results are illustrated in Figure 2* Differ¬ 
ences of 10% and greater are considered significant* From 
the graph it will be observed that for uninoculated seed, 
emergence decreases uniformly as the formaldehyde concen¬ 
tration increases* For inoculated seed we get a very evident 
decrease at the 1-360 concentration which is significant in 
comparison with the water treatment 9 and in the series inocul¬ 
ated with Fusarium is significantly lower than the 1-320 con¬ 
centration* In general the data brings out two important 
points; (1) the excessive damage produced by the 1-360 con¬ 
centration, (2) that the 1-320 concentration is probably 
the most favorable one to use in so far as emergence is 
concerned. 

Figure 4/ shows the emergence of wheat seedlings 
just previous to harvesting* 

Height of Plants. 

The height of plaints presented in the above data 
illustrates how these figures follow somewhat the trend of 
emergence in that there is a decrease in height even at 
the 1-360 concentration* The curve in the case of both

organisms rises slightly again at the 1—360 concentration® 

The table also indicates that Fusarium graminearum caused a 
greater decrease in the height of plants than Helminthospor - 
ium sativum ® 

Infection Rating® 

The strains of Eelminthosporium sativum and Fusarium 
germinearum used were isolated at this laboratory and have 
proved to be very pathogenic* Careful temperature records 
were maintained throughout the experiment® Soil temperatures 
varied between 14°C* and 25°G.» averaging 20°C® Air temper¬ 
atures recorded by a thermograph varied between 15°C* and 32°G* f 
averaging about 21°G* 

Infection rating figures illustrated in Figure 3$ 
demonstrate the effect of chemical seed injury on increasing 
severity of damage from seed-borne organisms® The trend is a 
marled increase in infection rating on seedlings from formal¬ 
dehyde injured seed over that on seedlings from normal seed® 

The 1-32C concentration appears to be the most satisfactory 
one tested from a standpoint of seed injury and infection rat¬ 
ing. Both organisms produce excessive damage on seedlings from 
seed treated with the 1-360 concentration® The decrease in 
infection rating from the 3-320 concentration can be partly 
accounted for by the residual effect of the formaldehyde on the 
grain at this concentration® 

Fusarium produces more pre-emergence blight than does 
Eelminthosporium » and plants failing to emerge were scored as 
killed: therefore* Fusarium in general produces a higher in¬ 
fection rating than does Helminfhosporium ® 

Eo statistical analysis was made of the daua from 
results of experiments with these organisms as differences were 
sufficiently pronounced to interpret without such an analysis.

Effect of Formaldehyde seed injury on infection 
from hunt fungi* 


Formaldehyde is the chief chemical used for the 
prevention of hunt in wheat* In view of the results obtain¬ 
ed with experiments on Helminthosporium sativum and Fusarium 
gram in ear um it was thought, however, that formaldehyde might 
hy reason of its seed injury cause an increase in the severity 
of hunt infection resulting from recontamination of the seed* 

Experimental Methods* 

Red Bohs 222 a very hunt susceptible variety, was 
used throughout for this experiment* The experiment was con* 
ducted in flats containing unsterilized soil* One hundred 
kernels were sown in each flat and the experiment was replicated 
four times* The grain was treated with the various concentrate 
ions of formaldehyde hy immersion for 1 minute* The treated 
grain was covered 6 hours and then allowed to air dry for 12 
hours* Following this the seed was artificially smutted with 
a composite sample of Tilletia tritici (Kuhn) and T* laevis at 
the rate of 0*5 grams of smut per TOO grams of grain* The flats 
were kept in a cold chamber for 10 days where an average soil 
temperature of 11°C* was maintained* Following this they were 
removed to one of the colder sections of the greenhouse* 

Experimental Results* 

The experiment was terminated when the plants had 
matured sufficiently to take smut notes* Rotes were taken on

with formaldehyde emerged as follows* that treated with the 
1-320 concentration on the sixth day, 2-320 on the seventh day, 
3-320 and 4-320 on the eighth day* It is to be noted that

the time of removal from the cold chamber* 

Height of plants* 

The data in Table 111 show that plants from water 
treated seeds are decreased in height due probably to the 
high smut infection in this treatment. The increase in height 
of plants from seeds treated with the concentrations 3-320 and 
4-320 may be accounted for by the decrease in emergence at 
these concentrations which would allow for better growth of 
surviving plants. 

Smut Infection. 

Treatment with formaldehyde apparently did not pre¬ 
dispose Red Bobs wheat to infection by the bunt fungi. The 
data however are not satisfactory for its detection becausd of 
the high percentage of infected plants in the check. There 
is instead a significant reduction in the severity of infection 
in the treated grain ©specially where the 3-320 and 4-320 
concentrations were used. While formaldehyde has little pro¬ 
tective value after the grain is dry it does have some and this 
may have obscured any predisposing effects on the plants which 
the treatment may have had. 

The spores of bunt fungi may b© more susceptible to 
the fungicidal effects of the residual formaldehyde or the para¬ 
formaldehyde than those of Helminthosporium sativum or Pusarium 
gr amine arum . This may account for the positive evidence of pre¬ 
disposition to attack by the two latter fungi and the negative 
results for the former. 

Figure 5 illustrates the effect of formaldehyde seed 
injury on infection by the bunt fungi. It was observed in scor¬ 
ing plants for smut infection that a higher percentage of sterile

is not available to discuss this point in detail, but sterility 
in plants is possible another deleterious effect of formaldehyde 
which has hither to been unobserved* 

Influence on Diseases Caused by Soil-Borne 

Organisms* 


general Methods * 

In these experiments inoculum was added to the soil 
rather than directly to the seed* The inoculum was prepared 
by growing the organism on a substrate consisting of sterilized 
Edmonton black soil plus 10^ cornmeal and water* This was 
added to the pots of sterilized soil at the rate of 30 grams 
per 6 inch pot* The treated seed was then sown directly into 
the inoculum* Treatment of the seed consisted of immersion of 
the seed in the different concentrations of formaldehyde for 
1 minute, draining, covering for four hours and drying 12 hours 
at room temperature before planting* The check was treated with 
distilled water. All experiments were replicated 16 times 
and the plants harvested after 21 days* The check pots received 
an equal amount of sterilized soil plus cornmeal in place of the 
inoculum.

from the seedling stage to maturity. The stems, leaves and 
heads of the plants are bleached; the heads are empty or contain 
only shrunken grain; the base of the stems and roots are black¬ 
ened. The strain of Ophiobolus graninis used was isolated in 
this laboratory from diseased wheat collected at Athabasca, 
Alberta, in 1930 and has proved to be very pathogenic on wheat. 
The test was conducted on Marquis wheat from the 1933 crop. 

The experiment was started in the cold chamber where the pots 
were kept at an average soil temperature of 13.5° C. follo\¥ing 
this the pots were removed to the green house where the soil 

temperature varied between 12° and 20° G. with an average 

o 

temperature of 17.8 C. 

Experimental Results . 

Emergence. 

It was observed here as in experiments with Helmin- 
thoaporium sativum and Fusarium graminearum that emergence 
was delayed somewhat due to the formaldehyde treatment and was 
more pronounced in infested soil from the combined action of the 
treatment from formaldehyde and the organism Ophiobolus graminis. 
Final emergence results are presented in Table IV .

These figures show that in /iinfested soil, dis¬ 
regarding minor fluctuations, emergence in general is re¬ 
duced with increasing concentrations of formaldehyde, but 
does not become significantly reduced until a concentration 
of 3-320 is reached* However following treatment with 1-400 
concentration emergence becomes significantly reduced in infest¬ 
ed soil and this reduction is enormously accentuated when 
more concentrated solutions of formaldehyde as 3-320 are used* 
These results also indicate that in the presence of infested 
soil 1-360 concentration is more injurious than the 1-320 con¬ 
centration*

Height of plants. 

In note taking there appeared to be definite differences 
in height of plants in infested soil between treatments with 
different formaldehyde concentrations, and it was thought ad¬ 
visable to examine the significance of these differences® 

Table V shows the height of plants in infested and uninfested 
soil from seed treated with different concentrations of 
formaldehyde®

In order to verify the results a thorough exam¬ 
ination of the data was essential* Fisher's analysis of 
variance method was utilized for this purpose* The method 
of the analysis of the data cannot he given here in detail 
hut will he found in papers hy Fisher (11), Fisher and Wish- 
art (12) and Goulden (16). This method of the analysis of 
randomized pot experiments permits an evaluation of the sign¬ 
ificance of the experiment as a whole as well as of the in¬ 
dividual treatments* The results of the analysis of variance 
for plant height and formaldehyde concentration in infested 
soil and uninfested soil are given in Table VI*

of 20 to 1 against the results obtained being merely due 
to chance, was used in these studies* The results of the 
statistical analysis of the data establish that there is a 
very significant difference in height of plants among the 
different concentrations of formaldehyde, as the F value 
greatly exceeds the one per cent point* It will also be 
observed from the above table that soil treatments are very 
significant. Referring to the previous table it will be ob¬ 
served that in the uninfested soil only the concentration 
3-320 significantly reduces the height of the plants* In 
the soil infested with Ophiobolus graminis plants treated 
with 1-360, 2-320 and 3-320 concentrations are significantly 
reduced in height from the check, but the 1-320 treated plants 
are not. This is an interesting point and will be discussed 
again later. 

Infection rating. 

Per cent infection rating data as determined by 
scoring individual plants by means of a scale from 0 to 10 
(0 clean to 10 killed) are presented in Table VlT and il¬ 
lustrated in Figure 6*

Iri the above table we note that variance due to error 
is larger than the variance due to concentrations. Therefore 
we may say that the concentrations do not differ significantly 
among themselves. This does not necessarily mean, however, 
that differences between any pair of treatments is not sig¬ 
nificant, and it will be seen from data in the previous table 
that all concentrations produce a significant increase in in¬ 
fection rating in comparison with the water treated seed. The 
treatment with the 3-320 concentration is the only one showing 
an increase in infection rating which is significant over any 
other concentration. Therefore the other four concentrations 
may be grouped as one in so far as infection rating is con¬ 
cerned. 

Effect of Formaldehyde Seed Injury on the Development 

of Damage from py t hi urn sp. 

Experimental Methods . 

The strain of Pythium used in this experiment was 
isolated from wheat roots sent in from Ashmont, Alberta in 
1934. This strain designated P^ has been tested and found to 
be fairly pathogenic on wheat seedlings, producing the 
symptoms of browning root-rot disease. 

Inoculum in this experiment was produced by growing 
the fungus on Edmonton black soil plus 10% cornmeal. This 
added to 6 inch pots of sterilized soil at the rate of 50 grams 
per pot seemed to give satisfactory infection. The check or 
uninfested pots received 50 grams of sterilized soil plus 1Q%> 
corn?neal in place of the inoculum. The soil temperature thro- 
u'ght the experiment varied from 13^ to 19^ C. with an average

wheat from the 1934 crop* 

Experimental Results * 

Emergence* 

Emergence delay of plants from formaldehyde treat¬ 
ed seed in both the infested and uninfested soil was part¬ 
icular ily striking* Daily counts were made in order to follow 
these trends in emergence delay and particularly to observe 
the delay caused by intermediate concentrations* In Table BIT 
are shown the daily emergence counts expressed in per-cent* 

The data show that the final emergence in infested soil is not 
a great deal different than the final emergence in uninfested 
soil* It appears, however, that delay in emergence the diff¬ 
erent formaldehyde concentrations behaves differently in the 
infested soil and in uninfested soil*

It will be noticed from the data in Table TX , that 
first emergence occurred in all the treatments in the uninfest¬ 
ed soil on the 5th day, whereas no emergence had occurred at 
all in the infested soil on the 5th day* On the 6th day in 
the infested soil there was 9 % emergence of plants from water 
treated seed hut practically none from the formaldehyde treated 
seed* The 3-320 concentration delayed emergence 3 days in the 
infested soil* To illustrate how delayed emergence operates 
in these intermediate concentrations a graph was prepared. 
Figure ?, showing the final emergence and the emergence on 8th 
day in infested and uninfested soils* It is interesting to 
observe in the uninfested soil how emergence drops at the 
1-400 concentration and arises again at the 1-360 and then 
gradually falls off again, with increase in concentration* 

In the infested soil there is a steady drop from the water 
treated seed to the 1-360 concentration when it suddenly 
rises again at 1-320 and then gradually drops off* This will 
be discussed further under diastatic activity* 

The height of plants under these different seed and 
soil treatments exhibited unusual differences and it was 
thought that a more detailed analysis of the data might be 
valuable in determining their significance* Height of plants 
in centimeters is presented in Table X and illustrated in 
Figure 8*

jBxamining the above table we observe that for con¬ 
centrations the F value is larger than the 1% point therefore 
the concentrations differ significant!y among themselves. 
Treatment of the soil constitutes the largest variance and is 
very significant as shown particularily by the previous table. 
The above analysis also shows that interaction between soil 
treatments and seed treatment is significant. This is inter- 
preted to mean that the height of plants under different formal¬ 
dehyde concentrations is affected differently in infested soil 
than in uninfested soil. In this case it is apparently due to 
the reversal of the height figures in the 1-400 and 1-360 for¬ 
maldehyde concentrations in the infested and uninfested soils. 
This difference in the hieght of plants is illustrated in the 
accompanying photograph, which was taken at the time of harvest¬ 
ing, Figure 9. 

Referring to Tabl e X further and taking 2.40 centi¬ 
metres as the minimum significant difference between the means 
of treatments we observe in the uninfested soil that none of the 
concentrations significantly reduce, the height of plants in 
comparison to the water treated check. There is a significant 
reduction in the 1-400 treatment in comparison to the 1-360 
treatment. However in infested soil all concentrations are sig¬ 
nificantly reduced in comparison with the water treated check, 
and from the data in the table the treatment from the 1-360 
concentration is more injurious than 1-400 concentration so far 
as the height of plants is concerned in infested soil. Also 
1-360 concentration is more injurious than the 1-320. This 
may be directly traceable to the severity of infection which 
is significantly higher following treatment with the 1-360 
concentration as compared with the 1-320 concentration.

Infection rating* 

Due to the lack of definite foot-rot symptoms and 
blighting it was much more difficult to score the plants 
in this experiment than those infected with Ophiobolua 
graminis . However, plants were scored on a scale from 0 to 
10 and the infection rating was expressed in per-cent* 

Plants were just beginning to show symptoms of browning at 
the time of harvesting. One of the striking features of the 
plants from seed treated with formaldehyde in infested soil 
was the complete lack of primary roots in all concentrations 
with the probable exception of 1-320 where browning symptoms 
were least marked. This complete rotting of primary roots 
is shown in Figure 9, of plant© grown in infested soil and 
photographed at the time of harvesting. 

The data on per-cent infection rating of plants 
from treatments with the different concentrations of for* 
roaldehyde are presented in Table Xll and illustrated in 
Figure IQ.

Figure 10# 

Effect of formaldehyde seed treatment on the severity 

of infection by gythium sp» 























(41) 


The statistical analysis presented above shows the 
variance due to error to be larger than the variance due to 
concentrations. Hence the concentrations taken as a whole do 
not differ significantly among themselves. However referring 
to the data in the previous table and taking the minimum sig¬ 
nificant difference as 7.44 it will be observed that all con¬ 
centrations of formaldehyde produce a significant increase in 
infection rating over that produced in the water treated seed* 

As in the experiment with Ophiobolus inoculum the 3—320 
formaldehyde concentration is the only one producing a signi¬ 
ficant increase in per cent infection rating over any other con¬ 
centration used. Plants from seed treated with the 1-320 con¬ 
centration of formaldehyde developed the lowest infection rating 
in the infested soil. 

Discussion . 

The results obtained with the bunt fungi will be 
excluded from this general discussion as they behave different¬ 
ly from any of the other organisms studied for reasons stated 
previously. 

In experiments with soil borne inoculum the infection 
rating increases with the increase in concentration of the 
formaldehyde. But in seed borne inoculum the infection rating 
in general increases up to 2-320 and falls off markedly at 
3-320. This would seem to indicate that at this concentration 
the formaldehyde has a fungicidal effect in the case of the 


seed borne inoculum,

In general the fungi studied produce a significant 
increase in infection rating in plants from formaldehyde treated 
seed in comparison with those from water treated seed* Using 
soil borne inoculum there is no significant difference between 
the concentrations 1-400, 1-360, 1-320 and 2-320 in infection 
rating produced, 3-320 showing the first significant increase 
over other concentrations in this respect* Therefore for the 
concentrations studied there appears to be no fungicidal effect 
from the seed treatment* From the data presented it appears 
in general that 1-320 is the most satisfactory concentration to 
use as it tends to be least injurious from the combined action 
of the seed injury and damage from the organism* This may be 
due to either of two causes, either it produces less injury to 
the seed or it may possess its greatest fungicidal effedts at 
this concentration* The 1—360 concentration appears to be the 
least desirable from this standpoint as it consistently re¬ 
sulted in most damage in the case of soil-borne and seed-borne 
inoculum* In per cent the actual difference between the two 
concentrations 1-360 and 1-320 is only 0.01^ which, under seed 
treatment methods employed by farmers is a very narrow range and 
a slight error in preparing the formaldehyde solution may lead 
to a very significant increase in the infection from pathogenic 
organisms. 

The practical significance of this increase in infection 
rating of foot and root-rotting organisms resulting from form¬ 
aldehyde seed injury is at once evident in a province such as 
Alberta where the foot-rot and root-rot diseases of wheat are 


major problems

REACTION OF CEREAL CROPS AND CEREAL VARIETIES 
TO FORMALDEHYDE 


Reaction of Cereal Crops 


It has long been a belief amongst agricultural work¬ 
ers and farmers that barley is more susceptible to injury from 
fungicides than is wheat* Hurd (17) in this regard concluded 
that barley is very much more susceptible than wheat to injury 
from copper sulphate* She concluded that this difference in 
injury was due to the barley hull being ruptured on each kernel 
where it was broken from the rachis* 

In order to study the relative reaction of different 
ce reals to formaldehyde single varieties of wheat* oats and 
barley and also the averages of several varieties were compared* 

Exp erimental Methods* 

I ran ii rf*r T . ■ . <-:■-» — ^ »— 

The grain to be tested was obtained from the Cereal 
Divison of the Department of Field Crops* It had all been 
grown under similar conditions in varietal trial plots and had 
all been threshed and handled in the same way. The experiment 
during 1933 and 1934 was conducted in 5 row plots, 1 rod long* 
spaced 1 foot apart and replicated 4 times* Emergence counts 
and yield determinations were made on the center rows* The 
grain was treated by immersion in the required formaldehyde 
concentration for 15 seconds* covered 4 hours and then allowed 
to dry thoroughly before counting and seeding.

It will be observed from Figure 11, that wheat is 
most injured, barley the next and oats the least injured* 
Experimental results for 1934 are presented in 
Table XVI1 , and illustrated in Figure 12* 

An examination of Figure 12, shows that in general 
wheat tends to be more injured than either barley or oats, 
and that oats are least injured* It is to be observed here 
that oats are more injured by formaldehyde than they were the 
year previous* This slight discrepancy in the results for 
the two years illustrated the extent to which experiments of 
this nature are subject to seasonal variation* This may be 
caused by seasonal conditions under which varieties mature, 
stage of maturity at the time of harvesting, and slight 
uncontrollable variations in treatment from season to season*

Figure 12a 


Reaction of cereal crops to formaldehyde in 1954 












( 48 ) 


The data in Table XVI1 , show that emergence in 
wheat, oats and barley is significantly reduced by a 1-320 
concentration of formaldehyde* It will be observed that 
the S*E* for the experiment in 1934 was a great deal lower 
than in 1933, this probably being due principally to the 
greater uniformity of the soil in 1934* Our 1933 plots were 
contaminated with patches of couch grass and also were dam¬ 
aged somewhat by gophers and wireworm^ 

The per-cent seed injury calculated on the basis 
of the decrease in emergence resulting from treatment with 
a 4-320 concentration of formaldehyde from that of water 
treated seed was determined for five varieties within each 
crop* The figures were then averaged to obtain a represent¬ 
ative figure for per-cent seed injury by formaldehyde for 
all varieties of wheat, oats and barley over a two year 
period* The figures are presented in Table XVlTl*

These results show in general that over a period 
of two years the order of decreasing formaldehyde seed injury 
in cereals is wheat, harley and oats* The presence of the 
hull on the harley and oat grains probably affords the pro¬ 
tection which makes them more resistant than wheat to the 
harmful effects of treatment by formaldehyde* The marked 
resistance of oat kernels may be due to the loose attach¬ 
ment of the lemma and palea to the caryopsds thereby forming 
an air pocket* The hairy covering on the caryopsis may also 
help in resisting the penetration of formaldehyde* 

Reaction of Cereal Varieties* 


Varietal differences of barley in susceptibility 
to injury by formaldehyde, particularly as indicated by 
yield data, were demonstrated by Tisdale et al (32)* They 
concluded that different modifications of the formaldehyde 
treatment would be necessary for different varieties of 
barley if seed injury was to be avoided* 

Experimental Results for 1933 * 

hi studying varietal susceptibility to seed injury

It will be observed that distinct differences occur 


between the different varieties of wheat* Garnet according to 
tiiese figures, showing the greatest susceptibility to seed 
injury,and Red Bobs 222 the least* Similar differences, 












( 51 ) 


though somewhat less pronounced, are shovm between the varie¬ 
ties of oats and barley* In oats the variety Leader proved 
the most resistant of those tested. Varieties like Glabron 
and Hannchen appear to be very little affected by a 4-320 
concentration of formaldehyde, and therefore appear to be very 
much more resistant to injury than O.A.C. 21 and Trebi. Since 
all factors such as soil temperature,air temperature, soil 
moisture and treatment were relatively constant and the only 
variable being variety, such differences as are observed in the 
data of the above table must be attributed to varietal reaction*

It will be observed that distinct differences occur 
GitDong the different varieties* In the oat varieties taking 
the b% point as the level of significance and the difference 
between the check and 2-320 it will be observed that all varie¬ 
ties are significantly reduced in emergence, with the probable 
exception of Leader, which is just on the border line. White 
Cross is most injured.. The three remaining varieties while 
showing a significant decrease from the check do not exhibit 
sufficient differences among themselves to warrant placing them 
in any order of injury. At 4-320 Gopher Is significantly in¬ 
jured over Banner and Victory, but the latter two do not show 
a significant difference one. over the other. So probably the 
final order of placing in regard to increasing seed injury 
would be Leader, Victory and Banner the same, Gopher and then 
White Cross. 

In barley, using the 2-320 concentration of form¬ 
aldehyde for testing varietal reaction, and the b% point as the 
level of significance, all varieties were significantly injured. 
Canadian Thorpe and Glabron were least injured. All varieties 
were severely injured by the 4-320 concentration, so that this 
concentration was not of much value in showing varietal dif¬ 
ferences. Tentatively, however, one may place them in the 
following orders Canadian Thorpe and Glabron equal| Han- 
nchen intermediate and O.A.C. 21 and Trebi most susceptible. 

Although as has been suggested by Tisdale (3&) var¬ 
ieties susceptible to seed injury should be treated with a 
weaker concentration of formaldehyde it does not necessarily 
follow that such a weakened concentration would be effective 
in controlling smut* It is preferrable that if formaldehyde 
be used we try to select varieties which are not susceptible 
to formaldehyde seed injury*

EFFECT OF FORMALDEHYDE TREATMENT OF WHEAT ON 
DIASTATIC ACTIVITY. 


The following studies were made with the end in 
view of obtaining information on the nature of seed injury 
by formaldehyde* It seemed possible that a reduced activity 
of the enzyme in the seed might account for impaired germ¬ 
ination caused by formaldehyde. Diastase was chosen for 
study since it is one of the most important enzymes concern* 
ed in germination* 

Literature Review . 

Nopaezewslci (19) in 1912 could observe no effect 
of chloroform or toluene in a concentration of 0.1$ upon the 
action of diastase, which action however, was prevented by 
1*0$ formaldehyde* Bohorny (3) in. 1919 reported that malt- 
ase was injured by 0*1$, and destroyed by 1*0# formaldehyde. 
Sherman and Wayman (2?) reported that formaldehyde concen¬ 
tration o£!0*0035$ and 0*035$ distinctly depressed the act¬ 
ivity of a number of amylases studied* They concluded that 
the- loss of activity depends neither on the concentration of 
the enzyme or on the concentration of the substrate present, 
but directly and solely upon the concentration of the an¬ 
tiseptic. Atwood (l) concluded similarily that there is 
a reduction of the amount of starch digested with an increase 
of the concentration of the formaldehyde used.

Exper imen t al M e tho d s . 

Di&static activity as used in these studies was 

measured "by the number of mgm* of maltose produced by 10 gm. 

of dry ground wheat in 1 hour at 27*5°C. The method used 

was Halloch’s (21) modification of Ramsey* s method (25)• 

The procedure was as follows t the grain was treated with 

formaldehyde by immersing it in the solution for 2 minutes, 

following this it was air dried 36 hours and ground to pass 

a 1 mm* Wiley Mill sieve. Duplicate 10 gram, samples were 

weighed into Koirausch flasks and 100 cc. of Sorenson*s 

HGl-Gitrate buffer (pH 4.7) added. Digestion was carried 

out at 2?*5°G* for exactly 60 minutes. Diaatatic activity 
by ly 

was calculated* subtracting the amount of natural A occurring 

reducing sugars from the amount determined after digestion* 
Experimental Results * 

The effect ©f the formaldehyde concentrations 1-400* 
1-360, 1-320, 2—320 and 3-320 on the di&static activity of 
seed of the wheat varieties Red Bobs, Marquis and Garnet was 
studied. These varieties as determined by field experiments 
represent respectively resistance, semi-resistance and sus¬ 
ceptibility to formaldehyde seed injury* Results for the 
diastatic activity determinations are presented in Table 
JXV 9 and illustrated in Figure 12. Duplicate determinations 
checked very closely, and the figure presented represents the 
average of these determinations.

It Is evident from the above table that formalde- 
hyde decreases the activity of the diastase of the wheat 
kernel and that different concentrations have different 
effects on diastatic activity* Examining graphs plotted from 
these figures one at once notices the. sharp drops in the curves 
at the 1-360 concentration in the case of Marquis and Garnet, 
and at 1-400 for Red Bobo* This would lead one to believe 
that the 1-360 concentration is more injurious to the enayme 
than the 1-320 concentration in the case of Marquis and Garnet, 
and that 1-400 is the most injurious concentration for Red Bobs* 
Presumably the action of the chemical on the enzyme does not 
become manifest until penetration has taken place* Since treat¬ 
ment with formaldehyde was applied before the grain was ground, 
differences in permeability of seed coats may play a part in

FORMALDEHYDE CONCENTRATION

determining injury from different concentrations of formalde¬ 
hyde* It is possible that certain concentrations of formalde¬ 
hyde penetrate more readily and more rapidly than other concen¬ 
trations. 

Discussion* 


Evidence accumulated from the above experiment points 
strongly to the fact that formaldehyde injury to seed occurs* 
partially at least, through its deleterious effect on the enzyme 
diastase. Diastatic activity of ground grain, following for¬ 
maldehyde treatment* is shown to decrease with an increase in 
concentration of the formaldehyde used for treatment. It is to 
be noticed also that a 1-360 concentration of the formaldehyde 
has a very marked depressing effect on diastatic activity* and 
a 1-320 concentration has the least depressing effect in the 
varieties Marquis and Garnet. 

In an earlier section of this paper it was shown 
that formaldehyde injury to wheat seed definitely increases the 
susceptibility of seedlings to attack by certain pathogenic 
fungi. It was also shown that treatment with a 1-360 concen¬ 
tration of formaldehyde resulted in excessive damage to wheat 
seedlings from several pathogenes studied* and that seedlings 
from seed treated with a 1-320 concentration of formaldehyde 
were least susceptible to damage from these organisms* Therefore 
it seems, that a decrease in diastatic activity is associated 
with a corresponding increase in severity of damage from path¬ 
ogenic organisms. This relationship holds true in all cases 
for the concentrations 1-360 and 1-320, and for all the con¬ 
centrations studied where soil-borne inocolum was used.

However, using seed-borne inoculum this is not so with the 

concentration 3-320 and may be explained as suggested above 

as due to the residual effect of the paraformaldehyde on the 

grain at this concentration* 

In uninfested soil seed injury from formaldehyde 

increases progressively with an increase in concentration of 

the formaldehyde* In infested soil, however seed treated with 

a 1-360 concentration of formaldehyde consistently renders 

seedlings more susceptible to attack from pathogenic organisms 

than does a 1-320 concentration* Since the 1-360 concentration 

only behaves this way in infested soil it must in some way 

be associated with the pathogene, and one would be inclined 

hand 

to interpret the results as follows: On the one* formaldehyde 
tends to cause seed injury and increase the damage from path¬ 
ogenic organisms, and on the other hand it tends to possess 
fungicidal properties and reduce the damage from these organ¬ 
isms* Therefore at the concentration 1-360 one could say that 
its seed injuring properties were operating at a maximum to 
induce excessive damage from the organism. At the 1-320 con¬ 
centration, where the least damage occurs from certain path¬ 
ogenic organisms, one might say that the seed injuring prop¬ 
erties of the formaldehyde were operating at a minimum and its 
fungicidal properties were at a maximum* With further increase 
in concentration of the formaldehyde the fungicidal effects 
tends to be masked by the seed injury effects which tend to 
increase disease rating in the case of soil-borne organisms* 

In the case of diseases where inocolum is seed-borne the fung¬ 
icidal effect of the formaldehyde masks any predisposing effect

EFFECT OF FORMALDEHYDE ON DIASTATIC ACTIVITY 
OF DIFFERENT CEREAL VARIETIES. 


Cereal varieties having exhibited definite differ¬ 
ences in susceptibility to formaldehyde seed injury in the 
field, it was thought well to determine what effect differ¬ 
ent formaldehyde concentrations might have on the diastatic 
activity of these same varieties. 

Experimental Methods. 

Diastatic activity was determined as already out¬ 
lined* Seed of the varieties of cereals to be tested was 
produced by the Cereal Division in rod row varietal trial 
plots in 1934* The varieties, were therefore all grown and 
handled under similar conditions* Treatment of the grain 
was as follows* 60 grams of seed of the variety to be tested 
was immersed in a formaldehyde solution of the required con¬ 
centration for 2 minutes, drained, covered 4 hours and then 
allowed to air dry for a period of 48 hours* The temperature 
of the formaldehyde solution and the drying room was kept as 
uniform as possible*

The data 

in the 

above table shows 

that the 

decrease 


in diastatic activity from formaldehyde treatment varies mark¬ 
edly with the variety * This is brought out more clearly in 
figure 14 o The drop in the curve for Garnet is particularily 
interesting when compared for instance with the curve for 
Red Bobs where the drop is very slight, or even with the curve 
for Marquis* The differences are too large to be ignored and 
since other factors were constant it must be assumed that such 
differences are due to varietal reaction* 

In experiments on the reaction of wheat varieties to 
formaldehyde it will be rembered that Red Bobs, was most resist¬ 
ant to seed injury by formaldehyde and Garnet the most suscept¬ 
ible* It appears, therefore, that the reaction of wheat var¬ 
ieties to formaldehyde seed injury in the field is determined, 
at least partially, by the effect of the formaldehyde on the 
activity of the en&yme diastase* In this regard it is possible

that the enzyme itself may differ in different varieties suff¬ 
iciently to account for the injury to the seed of different 
varieties* 

Since diastase is presumably borne within the tests 
in the embryo and in the endosperm another explanation of the 
varietal differences observed may be found in the relative per¬ 
meability of their seed coats* It has been shown by various 
workers e*g* Atwood (l), Schroeder (26), Bakke and Plagge (2), 
and many others that the seed coat of wheat is permeable to 
formaldehyde, but it is quite possible that the different 
varieties vary in the permeability of their seed coats* An 
apparent difference in the seed coats cf these varieties is 
their thickness* Ko literature is available on this point 
but it is recognised by millers that Reward has the thick¬ 
est bran and Garnet has a very thin bran* Red Bobs and 
Marquis are intermediate* The thin bran in Garnet may account 
for the susceptibility of this variety to seed injury, but 
resistance to injury in Red Bobs may be governed by other 
factors* The permeability of the semi-permeable layer may 
not necessarily be correlated with the thickness of the bran, 
but varietal differences as demonstrated above may be due to 
differences in the nature of the semi-permeable membranes 
of different varieties, irrespective of bran thickness* 

Atwood (l) makes the statement that formaldehyde 
retards the availability of carbohydrates to the germin¬ 
ating seedling, but does not inhibit the action of the dia¬ 
stase as digestion of the starch to sugar took place after 
the first three hours. There is no doubt a retardation as 
it has been demonstrated that seedlings from formaldehyde 
treated seed are invariably delayed in emergence from 1 to 





( 64 ) 

3 days depending upon the concentration of the formaldehyde 
used* It is hard to conceive* however* that the action is 
only one of retardation and not inhibition when Garnet drops 
in diastatic activity from 179*8 to 87*6 units from the check 
to the 8-320 concentration of formaldehyde, particularly when the 
8-320 concentration is sufficient to reduce emergence to 3 or 
5^* These results would appear to justify the suggestion that 
there may be a complete inactivation of the enzymes which come 
in contact with the formaldehyde* 

Results of formaldehyde on diastatic activity in 
varieties of oats and barley are presented in Table X&XV .

It will be observed from the data in the above fable 
that all varieties of oats e re more reduced in diastatic act¬ 
ivity by 8-320 formaldehyde than the barley varieties. This 
concentration of formaldehyde was used as a differential between 
the varieties* It will be observed* however, that great differences

( 65 ) 


do not occur between the 03 t varieties and possibly a weaker 
concentration could have been used to better advantage* It 
is interesting to note that the hulless variety Laurel shows 
no greater reduction in diastatic activity than Banner* 

Gopher in these tests was more injured than any of the other 
varieties* This corresponds to injury in the field where 
Gopher was more susceptible to formaldehyde seed injury than 
either Banner or Victory* In the barleys the hulless var¬ 
iety Himalyan is more injured than any of the hulled var¬ 
ieties* This shows the Importance of the attached lemma and 
palea in protecting the seed from injury» but is somewhat 
contradictory to the finding in oats where the hulless var¬ 
iety Laurel is less injured than some of the hulled varieties* 
This indicates that factors other than the protective cover¬ 
ing of the hull may be operating in reducing seed injury, and 
also that the nature of resistance in oats may be <quite differ¬ 
ent from that in barley* 

SUMMARY 


1* Wheat is commonly sown in western Canada when 
soil temperatures are relatively low* It was found in these 
studies that maximum seed injury of wheat by formaldehyde 
occurs at soil temperatures around 15°C* This is approx¬ 
imately the temperature of the soil in the Edmonton district 
when much of the wheat is sown* 

2* Wheat seedlings from formaldehyde treated seed 
were more geverely attacked by certain pathogenic organisms 
than seedlings from water treated seed* 

3* It was found that the severity of damage to 



zo 





0 I 



( 66 ) 


wheat seedlings caused by seed-borne inocolum of Helminthos- 
porium sativum and FuBarium graminearum increased to a certain 
point with increasing concentration of formaldehyde used for 
seed treatment. However the residual effect of the formalde¬ 
hyde concentration 3-320 on the seed reduced the severity of 
damage from these organisms# 

4# The severity of damage caused by soil-borne 
inocolum of Pythium sp# and Ophiobolus graminis increased 
steadily as increasing concentrations of formaldehyde were 
used for seed treatment, and appeared unaffected by residues 
of the higher concentrations of formaldehyde on the seed# 

5# With the exception of the bunt-fungi all the 
pathogenic organisms studied produced more damage to seed¬ 
lings from seed treated with a 1-360 concentration of for¬ 
maldehyde than to those from seed treated with a 1-320 con¬ 
centration# 

6# The 1-320 concentration of formaldehyde, the 
concentration usually recommended for treating cereal seeds, 
consistently produced least seed injury and tended to pre¬ 
dispose the seedlings the least to attack by the pathogenes 
studied# 

7# Wheat is most injured by formaldehyde seed 
treatment, barley the next and oats the least injured# 

8# Varieties of each of the cereals wheat* ogts 
and barley differ in their susceptibility to seed injury by 
formaldehyde# Red Bobs was the most resistant and Garnet 
the most susceptible of the wheat varieties studied# Leader 
was found to be the most resistant cf the oat varieties and 
White Gross the most susceptible# Canadian Thorpe and Glabron

were most resistant of the barley varieties while Trebi 
was the most susceptible* 

9* Formaldehyde treatment of the grain results in 
a decreased activity of the enzyme diastase within the kernel* 
10* Diastatic activity of wheat* oats and barley 
grain following treatment with formaldehyde decreased with 
increasing concentration of the formaldehyde solutions used* 

11* In Marquis and Garnet a 1*360 concentration of 
formaldehyde depressed diastatic activity more than a 1*320 
concentration* In Bed Bobs a 1*400 concentration was more in* 
jurious than either a 1*360 or 1-320 concentration. 

12* The decrease in diastatic activity of the grain 
following treatment with formaldehyde varies with the variety 
used* The diastatic activity of the seed of Red Bobs was con¬ 
siderably less reduced than that of Garnet* 

13* In the wheat varieties a decrease in diastatic 
activity of the grain following treatment with formaldehyde 
corresponds to the reaction of varieties to formaldehyde in¬ 
jury in the field* 

14* In oat varieties a decrease in diastatic activity 
corresponds to injury in the field resulting from formaldehyde 
seed treatment* This did not hold for barley varieties.
