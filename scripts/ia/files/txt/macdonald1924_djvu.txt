"Canadian Shorthorn Sires"

1923 - 1924. 





In the ownership and management of good 
livestock of the leading breeds there is that which mast 
fairly fascinate any honest student f s mind; there is 
something that appeals to all that is worthiest and best 
in the heart of every lover of the soil* And ever before 
the eye of even the humblest caretaker nises the alluring 
vision of producing champions and epoch-making specimens. 
They may appear any day or in any herd. The potential 
achievements are therefore immeasurable, and perse¬ 
verance is sooner or later to be well awarded. There 
is always the chance to improve upon the type, always 
the thought that what others have don© by wise matings 
we ourselves may do or even excell; and as we come to 
find and feel the pulsations of creative power within 
ourselves and see Nature f s wonderful response to our 
lightest touch, we shall know and understand that in 
the animal breeding world there is infinite scope for 
the intelligent exercise of the highest human faculties. TT

Canadian Shorthorn Sifea . 

Canada is one of the greatest livestock countries 
in the world, and Canadians have done a great deal in 
the development and improvement of good livestock. 

One of the earliest of the improved breeds to be 
imported to Canada and the one which has probably 
made more history in this country than any other is 
the Shorthorns. They were first imported to Canada 
in 1825 or 1826 and since then Canada has ranked 
high in th© Shorthorn World* 

In order to be successful, a breeder must not 
only have a thorough understanding of every known 
principle of breeding, but he must also have a complete 
knowledge of the breed he is working with. He must 
know the individuals and families of the breed that 
are most valuable on account of their individuality 
and prepotency. Although much Shorthorn history has 
been made in Canada, the young breeder, the man 
starting in the purebred Shorthorn business for the 
first time, finds it difficult to learn of the 
earlier breeders and individuals. He finds it diffi¬ 
cult to learn what bloodlines and what sires have 
been the most prepotent in the production of high 
class individuals. 

Success or failure of a herd depends largely

upon the sires used in the herd. It has been said 
that the bull is_ at least half the herd. 

The following work was undertaken with the object 
of determining the influence of sires upon the Short¬ 
horn breed and to bring to light such information as 
will be valuable in the selection of foundation 
bloodlines for a herd. 



( 3 ) 


B esume of Previous Iffork. 

The importance of the study of pedigrees and 
bloodlines is generally recognized in all the 
improved breeds of livestock. In order to make this 
information available, books have been written and 
articles published showing the leading sires and 
families as shown by show ring awards and performance. 

B.O. Cowan (1) has made a study of the prize 
winning Shorthorns at the American Boyal and Inter¬ 
national Shows from 1900 to 1918 and at several state 
fairs and leading expositions. He gives an extended 
pedigree covering three generations and a footnote 
showing the breeders, bloodlines and prizes awarded. 

A study of this book shows that certain sires are 
outstanding in their ability to transmit excellent 
individuality, and the majority of the prize winners 
have been sired by relatively few bulls. 

The Editor of the "Shorthorn f/orld" (£) submits 
the following tables:- Summary of Champion Bull 
Awards at the Internationals, Summary of Champion 
Females at Internationals. Summary of Shorthorn 
Champions and Exhibitors at the American Boyal. 

Summary of Champions and Exhibitors at the Canadian 
National Exhibitions. Also summaries of Champions 
and exhibitors at numerous state and other fairs

and lists of the first and second prize winners 
in their different classes at the Internationals 
from 1916 to 1923. These tables are further proof 
of the facts brought out in Mr. Cowan*s book on tT 
"Prize Winners". 

Further work along this line has been done by 
Hunt and Turner (3). They point out the great 
Aberdeen Angus sires in America. The sires are 
scored according to the awards of their offspring. 

For each fourth prize the sire is credited with one 
point; for a third prize, two points; for a second 
prize, three points; for a first prize, four points; 
a senior or junior Champion, five points; and a 
grand Champion, six points. This table shows that 
a few sires have been outstanding in the production 
of prize winning individuals. A genealogy table is 
also given of the really great sires tracing back 
through their male lineage. This table shows that 
they all trace to a common ancestry. 

The same authors (4) show the leading Hereford 
sires in a similar investigation. In addition charts 
showing the ancestry of the three leading sires and 
lists of the senior and junior champions of the Inter¬ 
national and American Boyal expositions are given. 

As with the Aberdeen A^gus it is shown that a few

( 5 ) 


noted Hereford sires have been the most prepotent 
in the production of prize winners. In the gene¬ 
alogy tables the names of certain bulls appear very 
frequently, thus showing the effect of their blood 
in later generations. 

Hunt and Turner (5) also worked with the Guernseys 
and show the great transmitting sires of that breed* 

In this investigation a study is made of the trans¬ 
mitting ability of Guernsey Bulls in relation to: 
production, show ring winnings, production and type, 
and their dams. A certain correlation is found to 
exist between these headings and as with other breeds 
quoted, certain bulls stand out as the really great 
sires of the Guernsey breed. 

Prescott & Prescott (6) have made a study of 
the foundations of the Holstein Priesian breed. 

Analyses are based on th© pedigrees of cows that have 
produced over 1000 lbs. of butter fat in a year. A 
genealogical table is given showing the number of 
times the important foundation animals appear in the 
ancestry of each of the first seventy-five 1000 lb$ 
fat producers. Sketches of the principle foundation 
families and five generation pedigrees of the leading 

fat producers are given. In this investigation

attention is paid to the females rather than the 
sires and it is shown that the great producing cows 
of the Holstein-Friesian breed all trace to some 
twenty odd imported foundation cows.

The need for such a reference as this was 
forcibly brought home to the writer when he wished the 
contained information for his own use. Since the days 
of Oolling*s "Barham Qx" and the "White Heifer that 
Traveled” the record of prize winners has been an 
effective means of advertising the merits of Shorthorns. 

In the preparation of this work the basis used 
for rating the Shorthorn sires of Canada is according 
to the awards of their get. As the exhibits of Short¬ 
horns at the Toronto Exhibitions are representative 
of the leading breeders and herds of Canada, the 
prize winning animals of these fairs are used as a 
basis of study im this investigation. Approximately 
nine hundred pedigrees of the first, second, and third 
prize winners at the Toronto Industrial and the 
Canadian national Exhibitions were traced out. These 
include the prize winning animals from 1890 to 1922, 
inclusive. 

The record of the great sires is given in a 





















' 














* 

t 























( 7 ) 


condensed form in the table "Great Shorthorn Bulls fT . 
This table shows the animal and number, date of birth, 
breeder, and the record of the bull as a sire and 
grandsire each year of his career. In scoring the 
bulls each one is credited with five points as the 
sire and two points as grandsire of prize winners. 
Emphasis is layed on the number of the get of a bull 
winning prizes rather than the number of prizes won 
by the different individuals. This eliminates the 
possibility of a bull ranking high because of the 
winnings of one or two of his progeny as might happen 
if the method used by Hunt and Turner were followed. 

At exhibitions where the competition is close there is 
very little difference between the prize winners and 
often placings are reversed at different exhibitions. 
Because of this equal credit is given to first, 
second, and third prize animals. It is realized that 
this system of scoring is not perfect, in fact, it 
probably is impossible to get a perfect system. 
However, the writer believes it sho?/s the true worth 
of the bull better than other systems of scoring. 

Get of sire classes and championship awards are 
always of interest, so tables of these awards at 
Toronto are given and their relation t 0 this study

discussed. Sketches of the animals in the table, 
"Great Shorthorn Bulls", are included and give a 
three generation pedigree and interesting information

about these sires. 

A brief early history of Shorthorns in Canada 
is given and mention is made of some of the early 
sires without which an investigation of this kind 
would not be complete. The close relationship between 
this country and Great Britain and the United States 
indicates the necessity of including the topics; 
Canadian Shorthorns in Other Countries, American Bred 
Shorthorns in Canada and the Effect of Imported Blood 
in Canada. 






( 9 ) 


Early Shorthorn History in Canada * 

It is appropriate that a study of the noted 
Shorthorn sires of Canada should he prefaced by a 
brief history of the earlier importations. The 
following statement includes just a few of the many 
important importations which had such a profound 
effect upon development of the breed in this country. 

The first importation of registered Shorthorns 
to Canada was made in 1825 or 1826 by the Hew Brunswick 
Board of Agriculture. It consisted of four bulls bred 
by Mr. John Wetherell, of Brampton, England and 
registered in the first volume of the English Herd 
Book. The next importation was made in 1832 by Judge 
Bobert Arnold, of St. Catherines, the pioneer breeder 
of Shorthorns in Canada. Prom 1832 on one or more 
importations were made every year. 

In 1867 the Hon. M.H. Cochrane made his first 
importation. It consisted of one cow and two bulls. 

One of the bulls, Baron Booth of Lancaster *1216*, 
later became one of the most famous sires in America. 
This marked the beginning of a series of importations 
by Mr. Cochrane. In 1871 J.I. Davidson of Balsam, 

Ont. made his first importation of six heifers, all 
bred by A. Cruickshank of Sittyton, Aberdeen, Scotland. 





fio) 


This was the start of Mr. Davidson’s series of impor¬ 
tations of cattle hred "by Mr. Cruickshank. The same 
year Messrs. Geo. S. Shaw of Bowmanville and John 
Dryden, M.P.P. of Brooklin, imported five cows and 
three bulls. In this shipment was the famous cow 
Mimulus (imp.) *343 s , by Champion of England (17526). 

In 1876 The Canada West Farm Stock Association made 
their great importation of Bates cattle. It consisted 
of fifty three females and fifteen males and was the 
start of the fine herd maintained at Bow Park. This 
shipment included the celebrated Pourth Duke of 
Clarence *79=. 

Many other importations of note were made during 
these years and those following, and included many 
famous individuals and the progenitors of the high class 
Shorthorns found in Canada today.

Early Sire s* 

While it is more important for the present 
day breeder to study the records and pedigrees of the 
noted sires of recent times, a reference of this kind 
would not be complete without some mention of the 
famous sires of the day when Shorthorns were new in 
this country. Of the many early sires the following 
deserve particular mention. Baron Booth of Lancaster 
=1216= (imp.); Fourth Duke of Clarence *79= (imp.); 

Royal Barmpton *217= (imp.); Baron Surmise *1223= (imp.) 
Earl of Mar *3.248* (imp.); Hospodar =2703* (imp.); 
Abbotsbum =1210= (imp.) 

Baron Booth of Lancaster *1216=, White, calved Feb. 22, 
1867, Bred by Mr. Gr.R. Barclay, Bumferline, Scotland. 
Imported in 1867 by Hon. M.H. Cochrane of Hillhurst, 
Quebec. He was undefeated as a yearling in Canadian 
shows and first at the Hew York State Fair. Baron 
Booth of Lancaster was sold in 1869 to J.H. Pickrell, 
Harrington, Ill., and from then until 1869 his record 
in American show yards was phenomenal. His winnings 
aggregated $4,000 and he was never defeated in a 
get of sire class. Shown at the head of nineteen of 
his produce, at Canton, Ill. in 1870, he won the $500 
for ten head or more by one sire.

Fourth Duke of Clarence *79=, was one of the most 
famous bulls ever imported to America. He was bred by 
Col. Gunter, Wetherby, England and imported by Hon. 

George Brown of the Canada West Farm Stock Association. 

He was used in their herd at Bow Park, where he 
remained until his death. The price paid for him was 
$13,000. This bull was never beaten in a Canadian show 
ring. Conspicuous amongst his get is the white bullock, 
Clarence of Kirklevington, winner at the American Fat 
Stock Show for three years, the last year over all beef 
breeds. Champion Carcass of the show. Fourth Duke of 
Clarence was a splendid type of an English bull; large, 
very smooth and very stylish. 

loyal Barmpton s 217* (imp.) , led, calved May 16, 1873. 

By lord Dansdown© (29128) out of Butterfly's Delight. 

He was bred by Amos Cruickshank and imported in 1873 by 
Hon. John Dryden. loyal Barmpton is considered one of 
the best bulls ever owned by Mr. Dryden. He was 
considered so valuable as a sire that he was never 
highly fitted for shows, but even so, he was successfully 
exhibited. He is noted as the sire of Barmpton Hero 
=324= out of Mimulus (imp.) =343* 


Baron Surmise (imp.) =1225= Bed, calved Oct. 25, 1879 






(13) 

Got by Pride of the Isles (35072), out of Souvenir; 
a Secret* He was bred by Mr. Cruickshank and 
imported by Hon. John Dryden in 1880. Baron Surmise 
was used in the herd of Mr. Dryden and then sold to 
Col. C.A. W. Graff of Minnesota. 

Earl of Mar =1248= (imp.) Red, calved May 2, 1881. 

Got by Bentick (42787) out of Emma 2nd. Earl of Mar 
was bred by W.S. Marr and was imported by and used in 
the herd of Green Bros., Innerkip. He was one of the 
finest bulls ever imported and lived to a great age. 
H ospodar (imp.) ■ 2703 - by Dunblane (47792), roan, 
calved April 8, 1884. Hospodar was bred by Mr. 
Cruickshank and imported in 1884 by J.I. Davidson of 
Balsam t He was sold to Joseph Robinson of Romney, 
Ont. and bought back by Mr. Davidson in 1892. He was 
exported back to England by Mr. Robert Bruce of 
Darlington, England. 

Abbotsbum (imp.) al210« by Roan Gauntlet (35284). 
Roan, calved May 7, 1882. Abbotsbum was bred by A. 
Cruickshank and was imported in 1883 by Mr. Davidson 
of Balsam. He was sold to Messrs J. & W.B. Watt and 
used in their herd where he sired the famous bull 
Young Abbotsburn «6236*

Great Shorthorn Sulls . 

Believing the value of a sire is shown by the 
number of his get which are high class individuals 
rather than the number of prizes won by one or two of his 
progeny; and that credit is due the grandsires for the 
excellent individuality of the prize winner as well as 
the sire, the following table is prepared to show those 
sires which are great when rated on this basis. The 
sire of each prize winning animal is credited with 
five points and the grandsires with two points,each. 

The scoring is based entirely on the number of get of 
a bull that have won prizes and no additional credits 
are allowed for a first prize over a second prize or 
for additional prizes won by the same animal. This 
is to prevent a sire from obtaining an inflated score 
from the awards of one or two of his progeny. 

Owing to the fact that many of the leading 
breeders do not exhibit regularly and that only a 
partial list of the swards of the get of some of the 
earlier sires is given, this table can only be partially 
correct in its rating of the bulls. In order to 
alleviate this difficulty as much as possible the date 
of birth of the bull is given and the awards of his 
get are tabulated by years. On the top line is given

(15) 

the number of prize winning animals sired by him 
each year, and below the prize winners of which he is 
grandsire* This allows the reader to make allowances 
for bulls whose record here is not complete* For 
example, Barmpton Hero was calved in 1878 and the 
table starts with the prize winners of 1890, that is, 
when Barmpton Hero was twelve years old* Also the get 
of Spicy Marquis were awarded prizes in 1903 and 1904 
and not again until 1909 because he was used in the 
West and his get were not exhibited at Toronto* 
Attention is called to the fact that where 
prizes were awarded to an individual more than one 
year, the sire and grandsires get credit for the first 
year only*

Get of Sire Batings . 

The following table gives the sires of the 
winning groups in the get of sire classes at the 
Toronto Exhibitions. The get of sire awards are not 
included in the previous table. As this class is one 
of the most popular at the leading exhibitions, the 
awards at Toronto are given here. 

A comparison of this table with the previous one 
shows that many of the bulls are prominent in each. 
Hoyal Sailor was first in the get of sire class in 1900 
and his sons, Hoyal Victor and Hoyal Prince were first 
in 1902 and 1906, respectively. Marquis of Z enda was 
quite prominent in the years 1901 to 1907. Spicy 
Marquis was second in 1903 and first in 1910 while 
Prince Glo 1 ster , s name appears several times during 
these years. Gold Prop is first seen on the list in 
1906 and Old Lancaster appears the next year. In 1908 
Missie Champion, a son of Village Champion, was second 
and Prime Favourite was third. In 1910 and 1911 
Avondale was quite prominent in these classes. All 
of these bulls are included in the previous table or 
are sons of bulls in it. From 1913 to 1922, all the 
awards in the get of sire classes, with the exception 
of six, were to the get of bulls listed in the previous 
table. Gainford Marquis was third in 1913 and first 







the seven years following* The names of Newton 
Ringleader and his son Broadhooks Ringleader appear 
several times, and Oakland Star, Prince of Archers 
and Archers Hope are also seen on the list* Right 
Sort, lavendar Sultan, Bandsman f s Commander and 
Browndale provided keen competition for Gainford 
Marquis for several years. The last few years the 
names of the young hulls Sea Gem T s Pride, and Matchless 
Bale appear, and also Escana Champion and Pride of 
Escana, sons of Right Sort, and Sultan Choice, a son 
of lavender Sultan. It is interesting to note that 
lavender Sultan is by Superb Sultan, listed with the 
great bulls, and that Browndale is a son of Avondale. 

In the get of sire classes prizes are awarded 
for the best three animals, the get of one bull. In 
some cases names of the sires of these groups were 
not available and the name of the breeder only given. 

In choosing the sire in these cases there is a chance 
that errors have been made, but the table is essentially 
correct. Ho awards are available for 1909 and 1912, 
so these years are left out.

In the exhibiting of livestock the pinnacle is 
reached in winning championships. In the following 
table the senior, junior and grand champion bulls at

A study of this table may b© linked up with the 
Get of Sire ratings and the table of great bulls. 

Valiant, a son of Abbotsford was senior champion in 
1901 and Royal Wonder by Royal Sailor was junior 
champion. Spicy Marquis was senior champion the next 
two years, and a son of Sailor Champion, lord Chester¬ 
field, was junior champion for two years, and in 1905 
Old Lancaster was senior and grand champion, while in 
1907 Prime favorite, Pettits herd bull was senior and 
grand champion. The blood of Royal Sailor was 
prominent in 1908 when Royal Chief, by Mildred*s Royal, 
was senior and grand champion and Gallant Sailor, by 
Sailor Champion, was junior champion. Prince Imperial, t 
the famous son of Prince Glo*ster, won the highest 
awards in 1909 and the following year Mutineer, by 
Gold Drop, was junior champion. 

The name of Gain ford Marquis appears for the first 
time in 1911, when he was junior champion, following 
this he was senior and grand champion in 1912, 1915 and 

1917. Matchless H ero, a son of M iiared>s Royal, was 




( 21 ) 


junior champion in 1913 and the following year Gainford 
Perfection, by Gainford, Marquis was junior and grand 
champion* Cecilia Sultan, by Lavender Sultan, was 
junior champion in 1915 and in 1916 Burnbrae Sultan, 
by Superb Sultan, was senior and grand champion and a 
son of Right Sort, Escana Model, was junior champion. 
Following this, Sultan Royal, by Lavender Sultan, was 
junior champion in 1917, Gainford Matchless in 1918, 
Lancaster Lord, by Archer’s Hope, senior and grand 
champion in 1918 and Eseana Champion by Right Sort, 
senior and grand Champion in 1919. 

The name of Browndale comes to the front as a

junior champion. The following year he was senior 
and grand champion and Browndale Count was junior 
champion. In 1921 Browndale Hero was junior and grand 
champion and in 1922 Browndale Count came back and won 
the senior and grand championship.

Shotthom Sires . 

The table of Great Shorthorn Bulls gives the 
record of noted sires of Canada in condensed form. 

The following pages give more information about these 
bulls. The sketches follow in the order of the winnings 
of their get at Toronto or approximately according to 
their age. As Avondale was never used as a sire in 
this country, his record is given with the American 
Shorthorns.

Barmpton Hero was bred by the Hon. John Dryden 
and sold as a calf to Messrs J & W.B. Watt of Salem, Ont. 
A glance at the above tabulation shows he is of 
Cruickshank breeding and out of the famous cow Mimulus, 
This Barmpton Hero is a half brother to Royal Duke of 
Gloster (29864), by Grand Duke of Gloster (26288), out 
of Mimulus. Royal Duke of Gloster was a remarkably 
successful stock bull and sire of the renowned Roan 

Gauntlet (35284) ana Barmpton (37763) Brea ada nsea By 
Mr. Cruickshank. From this Breeaing we see that it 















































( 35 ) 


was no accident that Bampton Hero turned out to be 
such a great hull* 

Barmpton Hero was first shown as a yearling in 
1879, and from then on he was the winner of sixteen 
first prizes at the Provincial and other leading 
exhibitions, eight diplomas, one gold and two silver 
medals and has stood at the head of he&jLs that were 
awarded first prizes ten times. With four females, at 
the Provincial Pair, Guelph, he was awarded the "Prince 
of Wales Prize" (King Edward YII) for the best herd of 
Durhams. In 1885 he headed the herd that won the 
"Elkington Shield Prize”, donated by Messrs, Elkington 
& Co., Silversmiths, London, England, for the best and 
largest exhibit of pure bred cattle, not less than 
twenty head, the bona fide property of the exhibitor." 
This achievement is better explained in the words of 
the editor of the Canadian Stock Baisers Journal in 
an article in that magazine in 1883. "The crowning 
success, however, of the Messrs. Watt was at Toronto, 
where twenty one of their broad-backed Durhams stood 
side by side with thirty five handsome Galloways and 
thirty stately Herefords, in competition for the 

"Elkington Shield Prize”, referred to above. The Judges 
comprised the different sets who had made awards to all

( 26 ) 


the different breeds. They were unanimous in the 
opinion that the red ticket should go to the Shorthorns”. 
Barmpton Hero was defeated in the show ring but once, 
and that time by a bull he had always defeated on other 
occasions. Referring to this one defeat Mr. J.A. Watt has 
said, ”1 have heard my father say at different times 
he and Uncle William offered to pay all expenses of 
the winning bull to come to Guelph the next week and 
meet Barmpton Hero again, but they wisely shipped for 
home.” 

As a sire Barmpton Hero was just as great as he 
was a show bull. A record of all the winnings of his 
get is not available. In the table of Great Bulls he 
is down as seventh as sire of nine prize winners and 
grandsire of nineteen. As this is a record at Toronto 
since 1890 there is no question that with the prize- 
winnings of his get for the preceding ten years added 
to this, he would stand at the top of the list. It is 
claimed that Barmpton Hero has been the progenitor 
of more prize stock in Canada than any bull of his time. 
Amongst his many noted sons and daughters may be 
mentioned Prince Albert *3669= and Challenge *2933- 
both of whom were noted sires and show animals. 

Barmpton Hero was used in the herd of Messrs. 

Watt until he was thirteen years.old. The greatest bull 
in the history of Shorthorns in Canada.

In the table of Great Bulls Prince Albert is 
shown with a score of 37 as sire of three prizewinners 
and grandsire of eleven. This hardly does him Justice 
as it only takes in the latter part of his career. 

Prince Albert was one of the best sons of Barmpton Hero, 
a good show bull and a good sire. His complete show 
ring record is not available but in 1883 he was first 
prize yearling at Guelph and Itadon, defeating his half 
brother. Challenge. He was sold, that year, to Thos. 
Nickolson & Sons for $400. In 1891 he was third in 
the aged bull class, Challenge *2933- coming second. 
Prince Albert was later sold to Smith Bros, of 
Innerkip and then to H. & W.D. Smith of Hay. It was 
while in the hands of Messrs. Smith that Prince Albert 
did his best work.

magnificent bull and was kept at the head of the 
Miller herd for many years. In the table of Great 
Bulls he receives credit for being the sire of five 
prize winners and the grandsire of eight. Vice 
Consul was one of the most famous bulls used by Mr. 
Miller. His latter days were spent in the United 
States where he was brought by Messrs. Sanger.

blood of Champion of England, it is little wonder 
that Indian Chief became or® of the noted bulls of 
his day. He was the sire of many successful show yard 
winners and from 1890 to 1900 at Toronto, his get won

Toronto in the ten years prior to 1900. At the 
7forld l s Columbian Exhibition, Chicago, in 1893 he was 
first in the get of sire class with four of his progeny 
and first in the 'Grand Sweepstakes Prize" open to all 
beef breeds. His get won numerous other prizes at 
the Chicago Pair including first sweepstakes yearling 
bull and gold medal open to all beef breeds and first 
sweepstakes heifer calf and gold medal open to all 
beef breeds. Of his many illustrious sons and daughters 
particular mention may be given to lord Stanley *17849-, 
1st bull calf in 1892 and 1st aged bull at Toronto in 
1896. At the World*s Pair at Chicago in 1893, lord 
Stanley was the first prize Yearling bull, first 
sweepstakes yearling bull and gold medalist, and stood 
at the head of the first prize Young Herd, Get of Sire 
herd and Grand Sweepstakes Herd. lord Stanley also 
attained considerable success as a sire and many of 
his get were prize winners. The complete show yard 
record of Stanley and his get is not given here, but 
from the above mentioned facts there can be little 
doubt that he was one of the great Shorthorn bulls of 
Canada.

Royal Bailor was bred by Mr. W.S. Marr of Aberdeen, 
Scotland and imported in 1893 by Mr. D.D. Wilson of 
Seaforth, Ont. He was shown as a yearling in Toronto 
but did not get in the prize money. At this show he 
was bought by Messrs. J. & W.B. Watt and in their 
herd he demonstrated his worth as a sire. In the 
table of Great Bulls he heads the list with a score 
of 125, the sire of thirteen and grandsire thirty 
prize winners at Toronto. His record as a breeder 
is shown through several generations. Royal Sailor 
was the winner of the get of sire class in 1900 and 
he has sired numerous first and champion winners. 

Many of his sons became famous as the producers of 
prize cattle of which special mention may be given 
to the following

1904 and 1905 and many other prizes^won by his heifers* 
Royal Sailor was a beautiful colored light roan 
bull, not of great size but showed splendid fleshing 
qualities. He was kept in the herd of Messrs. Watt 
until he was five years old when unfortunately he broke 
his shoulder and had to be disposed of. As a sire he 
was considered In the same class as Barmpton Hero by 
Messrs. Watt and was a worthy successor to that great 
bull.

Marquis of Zenda was bred by Mr. W.S. Marr and 
was imported to Canada in 1897 by W.C. Edwards & Co. 
of Bockland, Ont. He was a full brother to the J>6000 
Missie 153rd. At Toronto in 1899 he was 3rd prize 
yearling bull and in 1903 he was 2nd aged bull. In 
the get of sire classes he was third in 1901, second 
in 1902, first in 1903, second in 1904, third in 1905, 
and first in 1906 and 1907. Marquis of Zenda was a 





massive trull weighing at one time £800 lbs.,with a 
very deep body, straight lines, but lacking somewhat 
the compactness most desired. He was considered a 
better getter of heifers than of bulls but his real 
greatness as a sire was due more to the high average 
of his get rather than on any really outstanding 
individuals.

Toronto in 1904, first prize senior yearling bull and 
junior champion 1905, and second prize two year bull

He was bred by Mr. S.G. James of Iowa, and it is 
interesting to note that on the dam*s side he traces 
to Duchess of Gloster 12th, one of the early cows 
imported by Mr* Dryden. In 1903 Prince Gloster was the 
second prize*- Three year old bull at Toronto* He 
sired Prince Imperial the senior and grand champion 
bull at Toronto in 1909. This bull was bred by a 
neighbor of Mr. Dryden. Wfeen young he was neglected 
and Mr. Dryden bought him for $60. The following 
January he was sold to Thos. Stanton for $2,500. In 
the table of Great Bulls prince Gloster has a score 
of sixty three as sire of nine and grandsire of nine 
prize winners. In the get of sire awards at Toronto 
he was third in 1904, second in 1905 and third in 1906*

In the table of Great Bulls Spicy Marquis receives 
credit as sire of six prize winners and grand sire of 
three. This hardly does him justice. He was exhibited 
in 1902 and 1903 by W.D. Platt of Hamilton, and was 
first in his elass and senior champion each year, and 
in 1903 he was second in the get of sire class. His 






( 37 ) 


get were not shown in Toronto after 1905 until 1909. 

This accounts for the fact that he does not stand 
higher in the table of Great Bulls. In the herd of 
Sir W.O. Van Horne he sired many good individuals.

Mr. Smith says that Gold Drop was a very deep 
ho&ied low set hull of great substance. His fleshing 
qualities were prohahly his greatest asset combining 
thickness and smoothness to a remarkable degree. He 
was unusually smooth in his shoulders and full in the 
heart girth with deep flanks and long full quarters. 
Mr. j8d. Duthie, when he saw Gold Drop and some of his 
get, said that if he were in his herd he would never 
leave it. Of the many good hulls used by Mr. Smith, 
Gold Drop was one of the best.

Gainford Marquis is one of the greatest show hulls

is claimed that his winnings in three countries have 
probably never been equalled by any other bull. A 
partial list of his awards shows that he was:- 
First and undefeated nine times as a calf in Great 
Britain, first and Junior champion at Toronto and the 
International live Stock Show, Chicago, 1911; grand 
champion seven times and undefeated; and head of champion 
herd at 1912 Canadian shows; Canadian undefeated 
champion in 1913; grand champion at Winnipeg, the only 
show where he was exhibited in 1914, defeating his son, 
Gainford Perfection, who was grand champion at all other 
leading shows that year. In 1915 and 1917 he was grand 

champion at the Canadian National Exhibition and head 








( 40 ) 


of the champion herd. 

The record of Gainford Marquis as a sire is equal 
to his record as a show hull. He sired Gainford 
Perfection -90890-, second junior hull oalf at Canadian 
national Exhibition in 1913, first Junior and grand 
champion in 1914 and grand champion at all the leading

any hull in Canada. 

Gainford Marquis was imported hy Mr. J.A. Watt of 
Elora, a son of Mr. J. Watt of the firm of Messrs. J & 
W.B. Watt. He was used in the herd of Mr. Watt for a 
time and then was sold to Mr. Caswell of Saskatoon. He 
was bought hack in 1914 and has remained at the head 
of the Watt herd since then. 

The Watt family have been raising Shorthorns since 
1861 and it is doubtful if any other herd in Canada has 
been benefited hy three such great hulls as Barmpton

one of the greatest Shorthorn bulls of all time. 
Maxwalton Mina 2nd, his dam, is also by Avondale and 
out of Mina Princess 4th, senior champion at Toronto in 
1908 and a winner of many prizes in the United States 
and Canada. 

A study of the show ring awards of 1910 shows that 
Dale f s Renown «80112«, 334947 by Avondale out of 
Maxwalton Mina 2nd was first junior bull calf at the 
American Royal and Chicago International and second 
junior bull calf at Toronto and was sold to Mr. H.F. 
Brown for $1000. Upon looking up the American and 
Canadian numbers of Dale's Renown it was found that they 
were the same as the American and Canadian numbers of 
Browndale. Browndale also was second aged bull at 
Toronto in 1913 and third in 1915. 

In the herd of Mr. Jas. Douglas, Browndale has 
proved himself to be one of the greatest sires of Canada. 
In the get of sire classes at Toronto Browndale was third 
in 1919, second and fourth in 1920 and first in 1921 and 
1922. The table of Great Bulls shows Browndale to have 
a score of eighty four. He has sired fourteen prize 
winners and is grands ire of seven. This record was made 
since 1918, as few of the get of Browndale were shown 








fee) 


in Toronto before then. The get of Brown&ale wre still 
being shown and his record will be much better as time 
goes on. 

Of the many prize winners sired by Browndale, the 
following deserve particular mention:- 
Brov/ndale Banner -12519 9-, first senior yearling and 
junior champion at the Canadian National Exhibition in 
1919 and first two year old senior and grand champion in 
1920. 

Browndale Count -142627 -, first senior calf and junior 
champion bull at Toronto in 1920, second senior yearling 
in 1921, first two year old bull, senior and grand 
champion in 1922. 

Browndale Hero -142628- , second senior calf at Toronto 
in 1920 and first senior yearling, junior and grand 
champion in 1921. It is interesting to note that Brown¬ 
dale Count was second to Browndale Hero in 1921. Also, 
recent publications show that Browndale Hero was grand 
champion at Toronto in 1923*

Sultan Choice is the greatest son of lavender 
Sultan and has succeeded his sire at the head of the 
herd of John Guardhouse & Sons. The record of his 
awards has "been given with that of his sire, lavender 
Sultan. His worth as a sire has been demonstrated by 
the fact that he was second and fifth in the get of 
sire classes at Toronto in 1918, fifth in 1920 and 
fifth in 1921. His get are the winners of many awards 
at the leading fairs in Ontario and at the Canadian 
national Exhibition since 1918, They have won three 
firsts, six seconds and three thirds as well as prizes 
in the Breeder's herd class, junior herd get of sire and 
four calves bred and owned by exhibitor.

Other floted Sires 

When rating sires according to the winnings of 
their get at different exhibitions, one is confronted with 
the problem of where to place sires of known worth whose 
get have not been exhibited to any extent* The following 
are sires, generally reoognized as some of the good bulls 
of Canada, whose record, as shown by the awards of their 
get at Toronto, does not show their true worth. 

Royal Prince —26062— (Imp.), was for many years 
at the head of the herd of John Miller and Sons, where the 
quality of his get stamped him as one of Ontario*s best 
sires. The Millers did not show at all but many of his 
progeny went thseugh sales, selling as high as four figures. 

Lord Banff —26065--(Imp*) , was the first prize 
two year old bull at Toronto in 1901 and first at the 
Illinois State Pair the same year* He was bred by Mr* C. 
Watson of Aberdeen afid was imported by W.D.Platt of 
Hamilton. At Mr. Platt*s sale in Chicago in 1901 Lord 
Banff was sold to Mr. George E. Ward of Hawarden, Iowa 
for $5,100. His career as a sire in Canada was brief 
but long enough for his get to win third in the get of 
sire class at Toronto in 1902. 

Golden Drop Yi ctor —32065—(Imp.), was bred by 
Wm. Duthie of Collynie and was imported by H. Cargill 
and Son of Cargill. He is recognized as one of the out¬ 
standing bulls of Canada and **ke sire of Gold Drop 







—43723—, used for many years in the herd of H. Smith of 
Hay, Ont. 

Mistletoe Eclipse —63987— was one of the good 
bulls bred by Miller Bros, of Brougham, Ont. He was kept 
tn their herd and is noted as the sire of Meadow King — 
72853--, first senior yearling bull at Toronto in 1909, and 
first senior and grand champion in 1910 and 1911, defeating 
Gainford Marquis in 1911. He also won numerous prized in 
the United States and was bought by Heart T s Delight Farm 
of Chazy, New York, to head their herd. 

Knuckle Duster (Imp.) —28868— was bred by J. 
Bruce of Scotland. A Bruce Augusta. He was a prize-winner 
at London in 1899, winning over the Toronto prize winners. 
He was used in the herd of Mr. H. Smith* 

Uppermill Omega (Imp*) —64425—. This bull was 
bred by Representatives of the late W. S. Marrand was 
imported by and used in the herd of Miller Bros* Few of 
the get of Uppermill Omega were ever exhibited but those 
that were show his value as a sire. He sired Bridal 
Boquet —91991—, first junior yearling heifer and junior 
champion at Toronto in 1910 and first two year heifer in 
1911. Bridal Boquet was sold to Heart*s Delight Farm at 
Chazy, New York for $3,000* He also sired Burnbrae Wimple 
— 99659—, first senior calf and jdnior champion at Toronto 
in 1912 and fourth senior calf at the Chicago International.

Blarneystone --86798-- is considered as the best 
hull ever used at Sprinhurst Farm, He was sired hy 
Mutineer --80006—, one of the best sons of Gold Drop and 
first prize senior bull calf and junior champion at Toronto 
in 1910; and his dam is imported Butterfly 32nd. Blarney- 
stone was a splendid type, low set thick fleshed bull, in 
speaking of him Mr. Smith has said that he cannot recall 
an inferior calf sired by him. As Mr. Smith has not exhi¬ 
bited in recent years the get of Blarneystone have not 
been shown. 

Bmma T s Prince —95099-- was one of the best bulls 
used in the herd of J.G. Barron of Carberry, Manitoba. He 
was sired by Missie f s Prince, the $20,000 bull of Messrs. 

X. B. Ralphs and H. A* Currie of Alberta, a noted show bull 
and sire, and through him traces to the champion bull 
Prinee Imperial. Mr. Barron has only exhibited at Toronto 
a few times but in the years that he did, Emma T s Prince 
shone as a getter of prize winning stock. He was third in 
the Get of Sire class in 1918 and second in 1920. He is 
noted as the sire of Lavender 47th —139095--, first 
senior heifer calf and junior champion in 1918, first sen¬ 
ior yearling, junior and grand champion in 1919 at Toronto 
and junior champion at Chicago. 

Hewton Grand Champion —1079521--(Imp.) was bred 
by A. T. Gordon of Scotland. He was used in the herd of 

Messrs. Geo. Amos and Sons and is considered by them as a

worthy successor to Old Lancaster. He was second in the 
Get of Sire class in 1921. He is the sire of Roan Lady 
28th —150755--, first two year old heifer, senior and 
grand champion at the Canadian National Exhibition in 1921 
and first aged cow senior and grand champion in 1922. 

Rothes King 4th (Imp.) —148265— is a bull that 
gives promise of being an excellent sire. He was fifth 
in the Get of Sire class at Toronto in 1922 and in the herd 
of the late Sir Prank Baillie has sired several prize 
winners including Butterfly King —158195--, first senior 
bull-calf and junior champion at Toronto in 1922. Rothes 
King 4th is now owned by Messrs. Campbell and Amos of 
Moffatt, Ont., who purchased the entire Baillie herd. 

Millhills Comet —141900— is the most sensational 
bull imported to Ganada in recent years. He was bred by 
Mrs* D* Stewart and was purchased by J.J. Elliott of 
Guelph for the record breaking price of $33,000. He is 
a magnificent type of a bull and a son of Cupbearer of 
Collynie, an outstanding bull in the Old Country. Much 
is expected of Millhills Comet* 





Canadian Shorthorns in Other Countri es. 

The position Canada holds in the Shorthorn World 
has already been pointed out. That this position is justi 
fied is shown in the following pages where a partial record 
of Canadian Shorthorns in other countries is given. 

Baron Booth of Lancaster (previously referred to) 
was bought by Mr. J.H. Pickrell of Harrington, Illinois 
from Hon. M.H. Cochrane of Hillhurst, Quebec and has been 
spoken of by Mr. A«H. Sanders as ”the greatest Shorthorn 
of his day and generation”. At the head of the herd of 
Mr. P/ickrell, Baron Both of Lancaster made an enviable 
show ring record defeating the celebrated herd of Mr. 

Daniel McMillan of Ohio, headed by a Canadian bred bull 
Plantagenet,for the first time. 

Plantagenet was a great show bull in the herd of 
Mr. McMillan. At the McMillan sale in 1870 the get of 
Plantagenet sold for very high prices; Forest Queen realiz¬ 
ing $>2,800; 6th Louan of Oakland, $2000; Linda Belle 2nd, 
$1525; 6th Duchess of Oakland $1500; 7th Duchess of Oak¬ 
land, $1400; Magenta $1105 and others from $500 to $1000. 
The highest priced bull of the sale. Royal Oakland by 
Plantagenet brought $1300. He was a noted prise winner 
and was resold the next day for $2000. 

When Col. W.S. King started his prize her^d, 
winners at St. Louis in 1870, he went to Canada and bought 



) ') 


\ ' ; 







from the Hon. M.H. Cochrane, Rosedale, imp. Queen of 
Diamonds and Maid of Atha. and he gave instructions to 
Mr. Cbohrane and Simon Beattie to select and Bring out 
from Great Britain the Best animals money could Buy to 
fill out the herd. In referring to the achievements of 
the Lyndale herd at St* Louis, Mr. Sander in his "History 
of Shorthorn Cattle'? says, "The herd prize fell to Lyndale 
after one of the most exciting contests ever known in 
American show yards* Illinois, Missouri and Kentucky were 
defeated But Great Britain and Canada had Been ransacked 
with a Blank check to do the trick". 

In April of 1871 Mr. Cfeohrane sold to Col. Kings- 
cote of England for #4000, the yearling Bull Duke of 
Hillhurst. He was the sire of Duke of Connaught, for which 
Lord Fitzhardinge gave $26,904, the highest priced Bull 
in Great Britain until recent years. The same shipment 
included 11th Lady of Oxford, purchased By the Earl of 
Dunmore for $3760. 

During the "Boom days" of Shorthorns, in the 1870s 
the show herds of the Western States depended largely on 
Canada for show stock* Mr. Cochrane *s stock was proBaBly 
the most sought after and at his sale in Toronto in 1875 
many high class individuals were sold to the United States 
including, Airdrie Duchess 5th Bought By Avery and Murphy 
for $18,000 and 5th Duke of Hillhurst By Mark S. Cochrill 
of Tennessee for $8300. 



When the tide had turned in America and the high 
priced Booth cattle were not selling so well, Mr, Cochrane 
began exporting cattle to England. After several private 
sales, a public sale of Canadian bred cattle of Booth and 
Bates bloodlines was held in 1877 at Windemere. This sale 
was very successful and very high prices were realized; 

5th Duchess of Hillhurst bringing 4,300 guineas, the 
highest price paid for a cow in Great Britain. 

During the years following sales were held in the 
United States by Mr. Cochrane and the Canada West Stock 
Farm Association and the majority of the stock was pur¬ 
chased by Americans at fair prices* 

With the rise of Scotch Shorthorns, Canada once 
more came to the front. Although the first importations 
of Scotch cattle wAre not made by Canadians, Canada soon 
took the lead in the promotion of Scotch cattle* The 
importations of Geo* Isaac of BAwanville, John S. Armstrong 
of Guelph, John Miller of Brougham, Jas. I. Davidson of 
Balsam, Hon. John Dryden of Brooklin and many others soon 
placed Scotch Shorthorns on the map in Canada. The fact 
that Mr. Davidson was for years the representative for 
Mr. Cruickshsnk in America meant that all America had to 
come to Canada for Criiekshank cattle. 

Great credit for the popularity of Scotch Short¬ 
horns in the United States is due the famous show bull

Young Abbotsbui% bred by J. and W. B. Watt. He was sired 
by Abbot sburn out of imp. Village Blossom, also the dam of 
Abbotsford. Col, Moberley of Kentucky purchased Young 
Abbotsburh in 1890. At the Illinois State Pair at Peoria, 
Young Abbotsburn was shown against the undefeated American 
show yard champion imp. Cupbearer. Young Abbotsbvmwon 
and became one of the greatest show bulls in the United 
States. Young Abbot sham was never noted as a sire altho 
some of his get became famous. Mary Abbotsb^rvi 7th was 
the greatest of his progeny and for many years reigned in 
the American show yards. Young Abbotsbun* End was also 
a noted show bull in the United States. 

St, Valentine was another Canadian bull that 
gained prominence in the United States. He was bred by 
J. Guardhouse and Son and is famous as a prize winner and 
breeder. He was winner in the get of sire classes at 
the leading fairs in the United States many times and is 
noted as the sire of the Lad for Me, Ruberta, Rose 0 T 
Grady and many other champion and prize winning animals. 

At the time Young Abbotsbvrn was in his prime Col. 
Moberley purchased from Mr. Arthur Johnston of Canada the 
young bull Nonpareil Chief by Indian Chief. This bull 
was a prize winner in Canada before going to the United 
States. He was third at the Columbia Exposition in the 
greatest ring of aged bulls ever seen in America; Young 
Abbotsburn winning first.

Since the early importations of Shorthorns to 
Canada Americans have been securing breeding stock and herd 
bulls from Canadian herds. The late Frank Bellows of the 
firm of I. Bellows and Sons (now Bellows Bros.) purchased 
his first Shorthorns from Hon. John Dryden of Brooklin. 

Among the many noted Shorthorn individuals that 
have gone to the United States may be mentioned Fair tyueen, 
bred by Mr. H.X. Fairbairn of Thedford, Ont. a champion 
and sensational show hei^fer in 1902,1903 and 1904; Flora 
90th, bred by Geo. Amos & Son, a strong contender for show 
yard honors in 1907 and 1908 and Gainford Perfection and 
Gainford Matchless, bred by J.A. Watt; at the present time 
sires in prominent herds in the United States. 

Many countries have been benefited by Canadian 
bred Shorthorns and Canada is recognized as one of the 
greatest Shorthorn countries in the World.

American Brad Shorthorns In Canada, 

Until White Hall Sultan and his sons became 
famous, few Shorthorns were brought to this country from 
the United States, 

Prince Glofcter, for many years the main her^d 
bull at Maple Shade Farm, was bred by S,C. James of Hew 
Sharon, Iowa. His record in the her^d of Hon. John Dry- 
den & Son has already been given. A grandson of Prince 
Oldster, Missie f s Prince, became quite famous as a sire 
in WEStern Canada. He was bred by Thos. Staunton of 
Wheaton, Ill, and is a son of the champion bull Prince 
Imperial. He was brought to Canada by J. Chas. Yule of 
Carstairs, Alta., and later sold to T.B. Ralphs of 
Calgary. A half interest in him was sold by Mr. Ralphs 
for $10,000. Missie f s Prince was a good show bull and 
a noted sire® 

Altho Whit© Hall Sultan was never used in Canada 
the influence of his blood has been felt in herds all over 
the Dominion. In speaking of White Hall Sultan, Mr. B.O. 
Cowan has said, 19 It would require a most well informed 
student of Shorthorn history to name a bull that has made 
a greater improvement in the breed; certainly none such 
have existed in modern times". 

Of the many excellent sons of White Hall Sultan, 

Avondale holds the premier place when considered as a

prize winner and the sire of prize winners. He was the 
first prize aged hull at Toronto in 1910 and in the United 
States he was the winner of many prizes from 1906 to 1910. 
Altho he was never used in Canada his get were successfully 
exhibited at Toronto on different occasions, and in the 
table of Great Bulls he ranks fourth with a score of 
ninety three. In the get of sire class he was third in 
1910 and first and second in 1911. He is the sire of Max- 
wait on Glo*ster 3rd, first junior yearling heifer and Junior 
champion at Toronto in 1911 and first two year hei^fer in 
1912; Bale*s Gift, third two year old heifer in 1910 and 
first aged oow senior and grand champion in 1911; and 
Bale*s Gift 2nd, first senior yearling in 1910, second two 
year heifer in 1911 and first aged cow, senior and grand 
champion in 1912. 

In the United States, Avondale f s record as a sire 
ranks second to none. His get have been awarded prizes 
in the get of sire classes at the International and 
American Eoyal shows every year from 1908 to 1917. He is 
noted in Canada as the sire of Browndale, the great herd 
bull of Jas. Bouglas and through him has made a lasting 
impression on the herds of Canada. 

Avondale as well as being a son of White Hall 
Sultan is out of the famous cow, Imp. Avalanche 2nd, bred 
by C. H. Jolliffe.

Another son of White Hall Sultan that has made a 


name for himself in Canada is Superh Sultan. He is the 
sire of lavender Sultan. The records of these hulls have 
been given so are not repeated here. 

In the herd of Hon. Duncan Marshall, Olds, Alberta, 
Dale Viscount has made q name for himself. He was bred 
by W. E. Pritchard of Avoca, Iowa and is sired by Dale 
Clarion, a son of Double Dal© by Avondale. In 1917 Dale 
Viscount was first junior calf at Iowa State Pair, fifth 
at the American Royal, and at the International he was 
second and first in Futurity class. He is the sire of 
Match less Dale, the yoking herd bull of T. A. Russell.

Effect of Imported Blood in Canada. 

The inestimable benefit dervied from the blood 
of imported animals is clearly demonstrated in the table, 
Great Shorthorn Bulls. 

Royal Sailor, the great bull bred by W.S. Marr 
and used in the herd of J. and W.B. Watt, heads the listo 
His record as a sire is well known and the effect of his 
blood was felt in numerous herds for many generations. He 
was the sire of Sailor Champion and the grandsire of 
Mildred’s Royal. 

Ho bull in Canada has had a more sensational car¬ 
eer than Gainford Marquis. He was bred by Geo. Harrison 
and imported by J.A. Watt. Although his record as a show 
bull has never been beaten, his ttxm wofcth is shown in his 
ability to produce champions and outstanding individuals. 
His sons are the heads of herds from coast to coast, in 
the United States and Canada. Through them the effect of 
his blood will be felt for many years. 

Following Gainford Marquis in the table of Great 
Bulls and third on the list is Right Sort. He was bred 
by A# T. Gordon. In the herd of Mitchell Bros, he has 
sired some of the outstanding individuals of Canadian 
show yards. Escana Champion and Pride of Escana are two 
of his sons that are continuing his good work. 

The fifth bull on the list of Great Bulls is

. ) 







Indian Chief, the famous Cruiokshank hull used by A* 
Johnston. His record as a producer of prize winners stamps 
him as one of the greatest sires of his day. Many of his 
sons were outstanding sires thus showing the effect of his 
blood. 

Marquis of Zenda, a Marr Bull; Old Lancaster, hred 
hy A. Cromhie; and Ben Lomond, from the herd of F. Simmers, 
are imported hulls of note whose get have had a lasting 
effect on the Shorthorns of Canada. Many of the more 
famous progeny of these hulls were females and do not 
show up the effect of their hlood as well as if they were 
males* 

Many noted imported individuals have been used 
with good effect in the herds of Canada for the past 
hundred years. To prevent this record from becoming too 
voluminous, a detailed account of their performances can¬ 
not he given hut the following may he mentioned as out¬ 
standing sires*- Royal Barmpton, the sire of Barmpton Hero; 
Vice Consul, Bapton Chancellor, Boyal Prince, Newton Ring¬ 
leader, the sire of Broadhooks Ringleader; Oakland Star, 
Uppermill Omega, Nonpareil Archer, the sire of Archer 1 s 
Hope; and Spicy Marquis. 

At this point it would not he inappropriate to 
mention some of the great imported dams. Because of the 
difficulty in determining the value of the dam they are

seldom mentioned. At the most the number of their pro¬ 
duce is small compared with that of bulls and it is diffi¬ 
cult to determine the effect of their blood. 

Probably the greatest female ever imported to 
Canada was Mimulus —343—. In the herd of Amos Cruick- 
shank she produced the famous bull Royal Duke of Gloster, 
a successful sire in Mr. Cruickshank , s herd. In this 
country she is noted as the dam of Barmpton Hero, the 
greatest Shorthorn bull of Canada. 

The names of Young Abbotsburn and Abbotsford suggest 
Village Blossom as one of the great imported dams. She 
is the dam of numerous prize winners sired by different 
bulls thus showing the effect of her blood. In the herd 
of H. Smith she has given rise to the Village Blossom 
family, highly prized in Canada today.

Conclusions 


The table. Great Shorthorn Bulls, shows that 
thirty nine sires stand out for their prepotency. It has 
been pointed out that any method of scoring bulls at the 
best only gives an approximate estimation of their true 
value, ftn analysis this table shows that certain bulls 
are outstanding. 

Barmpton Herjifo, seventh on the list, may be con¬ 
sidered the greatest Shorthorn bull in the history of 
Canada. His complete record as a show bull and sire is 
not available so his true value is not shown in the table 
of great bulls. It has been said that he never sired a 
poor individual* 

The record of Hoyal Sailor is outstanding for 
many reasons. Although he only lived to be five years 
old he heads the list in the table of great bulls. Hot 
only a great bull himself but he is the sire of great 
bulls, his prepotency being sho?m through many generations. 

The record of Gainford Marquis does not naed 
particular mention. He is the most noted bull of recent 
years and although his days of usefulness are over, his 
many noted sons will be heard from for some time to come. 

Right Sort has proved himself to be a bull of 
unusual merit.. His years of sergice in Canada were short 
but the effect of his blood is still being shown through 
his many good sons.

The record of Indian Chief stamps him aB one of 
the greatest hulls of Canada. In his prime his get were 
much sought after by leading breeders in the United States 
and Canada* 

Avondale and his son© Browndale show the effect 
of the blood of White Hall Sultan. The record of Avon¬ 
dale shows him to be one of the best bulls of all breeds. 
Browndalefs record has practically been made in the past 
few years and is not yet complete* 

Lavender Sultan is a bull whose record stamps 
him as one of the best bulls of his day. His career was 
brief but his good work is being carried on by his son 
Sultan Choice* 

Prince Glcster, Gold Drop and Old Lancaster are 
bulls whose get have proved them to be outstanding. The 
latter died at three years of age but his brief career 
as a sire clearly indicates the great loss the breed ex¬ 
perienced* 

Sailor Chamfion and Mildred’s Eoyal indicate the 
influence of the blood of Boyal Sailor^and Marquis of 
Zenda is another bull whose get were prominent in the show 
rings for many years. Stanley is another outstanding sire. 
The winnings of his get at the World’s Pair at Chicago 
show him to be a great bull. 

Of the present day sires. Matchless Dale gives 

promise of becoming one of the greatest bulls of this

country* At the time hfms three years old seven of his 
get had won prizes at Toronto, the largest number of prize 
winners sired by one bull in one year since 1890. 

From this record it is seen that of all the bulls 
used in Canada, many are good, but only a few can be 
classified as great, from the standpoint of producing high 
class individuals.
