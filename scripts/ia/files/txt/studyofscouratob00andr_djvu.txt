ABSTRACT 


"The main objectives of the investigation described 
herein were to:- 

1. Obtain practical rules for estimating the 
scour to expect at various obstacles or constraints in a 
river of mobile bed. 

ii. Observe the settlement of stone aprons laid to 
protect such obstacles or constraintsf rom undermining» 

The need for the investigation lies in the scanty 
information available, and the practical importance of 
being able to determine, in advance, the probable quantitive 
consequences of obstructing a river by bridges, spurs, gui.de 
banks, pipe-lines and tunnels within the reach of scour. 

The natural development of a simple set of circum¬ 
stances in a model river, or a flume with mobile bed, may 
take several weeks. Therefore, to obtain a fair return of 
information for a given expenditure of time, experiments 
were devised to give a variety of happenings and, so far as 
possible, experiments on different pieces of apparatus were 
run concurrently. 

Thus the work done fell into the following four Parts:- 
Part I - Plotting, to suitable coordinates, the available 
field data of **worst scours” from outside sources, together 
with laboratory data from outside sources from the writer's 
and others' work at the University of Alberta. The specific 
object was to obtain a working rule for scaling up from

Part I I - Attempting to produce the general pattern of 
behaviour that occurred at an actual bridge where, after 
continual buttressing of the piers by piles of stone, and 
after two major floods, a pier collapsed into a scour hole 
as the consequence of a minor flood. The specific object 
here was to demonstrate the practical utility of a small 
model for predicting, with the aid of engineering judgement, 
the probable major occurrences to expect in the field. 

Part III - Studying the process of apron launching upstream 
and downstream of a weir-like obstruction built across a 
river. This was done in two-dimensions in a glass sided 
flume, and was supplemented by some other studies of apron 
behaviour in the river tray. The specific objective was 
to obtain an understanding of the mechanism of apron launch¬ 
ing, and to obtain coefficients for scour under circum¬ 
stances on which information was not very detailed. 

Part IV - Studying stone apron launching, model distortion 
and effects of sloping ends on protection walls at three 
submarine crossings with guide banks. These crossings were 
placed in awkward positions to develop "worst scours" by 
disadvantageous approach conditions, and had a subsidiary 
objective of verifying whether they would straighten a

PART 1 


STUDY OF SCOUR DATA 




1 

PART I 

]ntroduction 

Scour around bridge piers, groynes, spurs, and noses 
of guide banks can seldom be observed visually but has to 
be determined by "feeling" such as sounding , manually or 
electronically. These soundings show analagous conditions 
are produced by wind in snow around poles, trees, and other 
isolated obstructions Noticeably bowl shaped scour results. 

An obstruction such as a tunnel or apron crossing between 
guide banks can be compared to a corridor connection between 
two parallel taller buildings. The wind blowing and snow 
being transported between the two buildings comes upon the 
corridor connection. One part of the flow dives and follows 
the face of the corridor wall, scouring the snow for a certain 
depth and distance away from the face of the wall. The other 
part flows over the roof and then curves downwards for additional 
scouring. The last scour can be portrayed by eddies shed 
from high pavements or connected stone protection placed around 
bridge piers. 

The main scour points that we are interested in are at 
bridge piers, noses of guide banks, spurs and groynes, down¬ 
stream of bridge piers, along guide banks and meander bends. 

Studies have been made with models and field measurements of 
maximum depths under extreme conditions have been recorded. 

The writer has used these data from various sources to plot 
ordinates of "d 5 Ft ? vs q" , where d 5 is the observed maximum

scour depth in feet, is derived from the equation = l.9YnT 

where m is the median grain size of the bed, and q is the 
discharge intensity in cusecs./ft. The master plot of all 
available data aimed at obtaining so large a range of q 
that the regime relation do<_q* /? could be verified with prac¬ 
tical accuracy in spite of the differing circumstances that 
caused the observed depths. When the relation had been 
established plots of special circumstances assumed that a 
formula of the type d ^ q^/pj /3 


was justified.

Procedure

The available record of field conditions is that of C.C. 

Inglis (I) for Indian plains' rivers. These records of severe 

scour under peak flood discharge were tabulated and plotted to 

show the ratio of scoured depth to the "regime depth" of the 

river at peak flood discharge. The regime depth dr was cal- 

q 

culated using the original Lacey regime equations for canals, 
where the relative effect of sides and beds had been averaged 
out for canal analysis, so was not necessarily very exact for 
the rivers. This depth was 0.47 ^QAr" where f is the Lacey 
"silt-factor". 

Inglis plotted d 5 f* 3 against Q where d 5 is the observed 
maximum scour depth below peak flood level and Q is the peak 
flood discharge. The points on double logarithmic paper were 
fitted well by a straight line of slope 1/3 as regime theory 
suggests. For adding data of gravel and boulder rivers where 
the relative importance of bed and sides is not that of the 
Indian rivers general regime theory (2) is applicable and gives 
d r = y F s /F^ Q , where F s is the side factor and Ft the bed 
factor. But F 5 is not easily assessible, and for models 
with rigid sides cannot be assessed. So the equivalent formula 
dr =fqVF b was used by the author. 

To plot Inglis* results on a chart of dsF^ 3 against q, the 
relation q 2 = F 5 /F b Q has been used where F 5 /F b is assumed 
to be about 1/5 ( on recommendation by Professor Blench.) Ft 
in this case is designated as the bed factor corresponding to 
a vanishing small charge (charge is the ratio of weight of dry 
sediment per second to the weight of water per second), since

-the charge was believed to be small. For large charges experiments 
will be needed to verify if a correction is needed. 


Inglis' field data and some model data are reproduced in Appendix 
A. They are retabulated on the ]/q VFb system in Tables I, 2, 3. 
Special experiments made by him with a model of the Hardinge Bridge, 
with sands of different sizes, gave a relation between relative 
breadth of pier and relative depth of scour; data from these are 
retabulated in Table 4.

An article "A Generalized Model Study of Scour Around Bridge 
Piers and Abutments” by E.W. Laursen and A. Toch (3) has yielded 
additional information for scour depths. This study is similar 
to the Hardinge Bridge pier analysis by Inglis. The authors 
have brought forward a concept of active scour and indicate 
that the depth of flow might be involved in determining depths 
of scour holes. Their Figure 10 page 129 was used to obtain 
values for depth of scour measured from water surface and 
discharge intensity in order to plot on the graph d s F^vs q ) 
the calculations and results are recorded in Table 5. 

E.M. Laursen (4) made a special model of an actual prototype. 

He superimposed his model results on data obtained by Hubbard 
from the prototype. Close relationship was found between the model 
and prototype at the lower values of discharge. For this 
particular case only the observations by Laursen were used in 
the writer*s plot. The calculations are shown in Table 5.

A study by Mushtaq Ahmad entitled ”Experiments on Design and 
Behavior of Spur Dikes” (3) had two figures 3 (a) and 4 (a) 
indicating slow asymptotic increase in depth of scour with time. 

How quickly the ultimate depth was reached depended mainly upon 
discharge intensity and grain size of the bed. This factor should 
be kept in mind when determining scour by models. Table 6 has 
the computations leading to values for the dsF^vs q plot from 
figures 3 (a) and 4 (a), where the d«, values were the ultimate 
depths obtained for each discharge. 

A University of Alberta Civil Engineering 66 Laboratory 
report by R. Sanders and S. Smotrych listed several scour depths. 
These values are shown in Table 7 where d^ is the observed 
depth and q is the total discharge available divided by the 
model distance between guide banks. 

The last table of data. Table 8 for Part I, was collected while 
both river trays were being prepared to obtain regime conditions, 
for other parts of this report. This preparation resulted in 
continous flow for approximately fourteen days. Fairly stable 
conditions were obtained in the east river tray with the fine 
sand and very stable conditions resulted in the west tray with 
its coarse sand. 

All the values of q in Table 8 were estimated by the width 
of the main flow attacking the structure and the percentage of total 
discharge of 0.I I cusecs. in the f!6w. Both factors are difficult 
to estimate especially obtaining the discharge intensity.

RESULTS 


The initial graph, termed the ’'master plot”, had all the 
data in Tables I to 8 plotted to the coordinates d s Fb 3 vs q 
(Fig. I). The best fit line by eye through the points has a 
slope of 0.74 . The equation then is d s Ft/ ? = 1.35 q 01 ^. 

According to the regime theory the discharge intensity index 
should be two-thirds for canal - like conditions. Setting 
this slope on the master plot and fitting it to pass through 
the field data gives an equation, d s - 1.8 q 2/3 , which 

passes through the higher model points. As the writer's work 
shows that scour in some models may not have reached its full 
depth, and as the flume models gave the q actually attacking 
obstacles while the rivers gave average q of whole river 
width model points must be expected to be biased to the right. 
Therefore the regime line is as plausible as the "best fit" one. 

The master plot was next divided into three. These divisions 
are bridge pier scour, scour at obstructions, and scour down¬ 
stream of bridge piers. In Fig. 2 the results of bridge pier 
data show about the same difference as in Fig. I between 
obtaining scour depth by the best fit Iine of equation 
d s Fb 3 = 1.4 q° 7 and the regime equation of d 5 F|/ 5 = 1*7 q^ 3 . 

Fig. 3 for guide banks, groynes, spurs and sharp bends is 
not much different from Fig. 2 . One line slopes at 0.7 and 
the other at 2/3. The multiplying factor for the former is 1.7 
and the latter is 2.05 times "regime depth".

determination hinges upon choosing a correct discharge intensity. 
For data of Table 6 q was the flow per unit width in the 
constricted portion of the channel. For attack on guide banks 
and groynes q resulted from considering the amount of flow 
concentrating on the obstruction and its width. 

Fig. 4 for scour downstream of bridges had insufficient 
points to fix a line. Lines of slope 2/3 have been drawn through 
different groups of data to obtain regime depth multipliers. 

The Fraser River data were not spectacular although associated 
with a bridge failure.

CONCLUSIONS 

1. The accumulation of more field data or model data from 
a large outdoor hydraulic station is needed to fill the gap 
between 5 cusecs./ft. to 30 cusecs./ft. 

2. The regime relation that depth of a channel varies as 
discharge intensity to the power two-thirds, all other factors 
being equal, seems confirmed reasonably after allowing for the 
differences in measuring q . 

3. For severe scour at bridge piers an average relation 
is ds = l.7|7q*/F b , q be ing the mean discharge per unit 
width upstream of the bridge waterway. 

4. For severe scour at obstructions an average relation 

is ds = 2.05v^VF^ , with q having the following qualifications 

(a) guide waI Is - q measured as the percentage of water 
attacking divided by the width of attack, (b) spurs - q 
measured in the 4*#*conf i ned portion of flow. 

5. For scour downstream of bridge piers, there are insufficient 
data, and q is difficult to estimate because waterways may 

have been blocked. 

6. The values of multipliers in the above findings do not 
justify any change in design coefficients already on record (I), (6).

P ART II 

SCOUR DOWNSTREAM OF 
PROTECTED BRIDGE PIERS 



PART 1 i 


28 


INTRODUCTION 

Scour can be displaced, though not prevented, by proper 
placement of a non-cbhesive material that cannot be transported 
or quickly destroyed by the water flow. Rock is often abundant 
and economical. 

A model was constructed of a prototype where rock was placed 
around the piers periodically for many years. This placement 
had protected the piers through two major floods but a pier 
failed into the scour hole during a minor flood. The theory 
is that launched rock from adjacent piers met and formed a 
type of ,! V H notch weir. The effect was jetting action between 
the piers that caused scour downstream. Then failure of the pier 
occurred when the resulting scour hole undermined the stone 
around the structure. 

The model, in spite of a variety of additions of stones, 
produced scouring action with two faint holes instead of the 
two conspicuous ones now present in the prototype. Apparently 

a barrage of stone does not cause severe scour - as shown 

by later experiments of this thesis - and the cause of the 

prototype scour was probably jetting from gaps in the barrage 
as in the theory.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE 


Attainment of steady channel conditions. 

The west river tray with its coarse sand bed of 0.41 
mm was used for the model study. The channel was straightened 
as shown on Photo 1 with flow through the channel being cont¬ 
inuous for a period of 432 hours. Water surface slopes on the 
centre line of the tray and scour depths at spur noses, along 
guide banks and bridge piers were measured with the scour 
values being tabulated for use in Part I. During this period 
the model piers were omitted. The long interval of time in¬ 
volved is due to the type of recirculating system used in the 
river tray construction. Any change in the bed of the channel 
along the tray took a very long time to return to its initial 
spot. One to two weeks seemed to be the time required to 
complete the cycle. 

Determination of channel scales. 

The vertical scale was determined as follows. Sound¬ 
ings measured from a geodetic datum on the prototype plan at 
a distance upstream of the bridge crossing were averaged. The 
value was 25 feet. To this figure must be added the height 
to high water, a value of 26 feet. Therefore the total depth, 
for flow of 600,000 cusecs, is 51 feet. The average depth 
of flow determined by the discharge of 0.11 cusecs over the 
area where the model was to be placed was 0.12 feet. Hence 
the vertical scale is 0.12 feet is equal to 51 feet or 1 
foot equals 425 feet.

The horizontal scale was established by the distance 
between the parallel walls. These walls, placed 2.35 feet 
apart, were to mirror the prototype conditions of a straight 
reach ahead of the bridge. If the walls were closer together 
a depth of flow greater than 0.12 feet would result with a 
tighter arrangement of bridge piers. Turning to the other 
extreme, with the walls farther apart, a depth of flow would 
be obtained that measurements of scour depths around the 
bridge piers would be difficult. To model the total bridge 
waterway of the prototype case would have the piers too close 
together and each one would be affected by the other. There¬ 
fore a similar model bridge was constructed with less piers 
but including the large pier for the swing bay section. In 
this way the distance between piers would be a multiple factor 
of the depth. The distance 2.35 feet of the model would re¬ 
present 1754 feet in the prototype and the horizontal scale 
is then 1 foot equals 746 feet. 

These scales of 1 foot to 746 feet for the horizon¬ 
tal and 1 foot to 425 feet for the vertical result in the 
model having approximate geometric similarity- with the prototype. 

A quick check can be made to determine if the scales 
being used are reasonable. 

By the equation Q 2 =■ Fb B 2 8 3 , where Q is the dis¬ 
charge ratio, Fb the bed factor ratio, b the width ratio 
(horizontal scale) and d is the depth ratio(vertical scale), 

Fb the bed factor is calculated to be 1.43. This value of 
Fb is very reasonable, indicating that the scales chosen are 
satisfactory.

Model Layout and Dimensions 

The bridge piers were constructed to the horizontal 
scale determined by the 2.35 foot width representing the tot¬ 
al bridge length. The piers were spaced apart three to four 
times the model depth of flow of 0.12 feet. (See Plate 1 for 
dimensions and Photo 1. for location) . 

Discharge 

A flow of 0.11 cusecs was used. The measurement 
of this discharge was by a n V" notch weir at the head of the 
tray. The operation of the river tray is explained in its 
entirety by Mr. A.W. Peterson(5). 

Slope 

The control exerted by the flap gate at the bottom 
of the tray adjusted the water surface slope to approximately 
a steady value of 0,07%.Actual slope measurements on the 
centre line of the tray were 0.14% and the regime slope by 
computation was 0.07%. 

Apron Stone Size 

The 1/8" stone had been used in another model where 
it had launched satisfactorily. Since the same discharge was 
used in both models, the same size of stone was placed. 
Scaling the stone size to the prototype dimensions results in 
1/8” rock representing 4 foot rock of weight 6 tons. This 
factor indicates a smaller size of stone should be used in 
the model, but this new size is approaching the coarse sand 
sizes of the bed. Hence a median has to be decided and a 
size of stone placed determined by practical model experience.

Procedure 


32 


Since the rock was placed annually for the proto¬ 
type case, the model was treated in the following way the 
scaled rock would be placed for different scour depths, which 
were 0.5d, 0.75d and l.Od measured below mean bed level where 
d was 0.12 feet. The first portion of l/8 H rock required was 
3 layers, 0.75d wide by the length of the pier. Then for the 
other scour depths only 1.5 layers with the same dimensions 
would be placed. The initial 3 layers and the following 1.5 
layers were quantities required to have the launched rock in 
2 layers, with no special attention paid to the ends of the 
piers. These values were obtained by calculations as made on 
Data sheet 1. 

For the first run of 0.5d scour, observations of 
the settlements were noted and a period of 7 days seemed sat¬ 
isfactory for obtaining equilibrium conditions in which final 
settlement had occurred. This period was used for the other 
scour depths as well. Complete sounding programs were made 
at the beginning and end of each run using a grid as shown 
in Photo 2. This grid was the fixed datum for all soundings 
taken. The height of the grid above water surface of 0.20 
feet would be subtracted from the sounding recorded to obtain 
total depth to bed level. A correction for slope of the 
water surface under the grid was not made since the figure was 
very small and greater errors result from the sounding itself. 

After each lapse of 7 days the recorded soundings 
were converted to prototype depths, using the scale 1 foot 
represents 425 feet. Contours were drawn for each case with 
photographs taken before and after each particular test run.

RESULTS 


33 


Run I - 0.5d scour 

Photo 3 shows the initial appearance (zero hours) 
of the area around the piers and the location of the stone. 
There was no attack initially without stone at the piers. 

The photograph indicates a deeper section to the left of the 
largest pier and observation of Plate 2 will give an idea of 
the depths prevailing. After 7 days the observations yielded 
a contour plan of final conditions for 0.5d scour (Plate 3). 
From Photo 4 large changes in the model sand bed have occurred. 
This is due to the obstructions to flow created by the piers. 
Comparing Photos 3 and 4, it can be clearly seen that in the 
shallower areas the stone has been covered by the sand. Faint 
scours have occurred downstream of the piers. They are crescent 
shaped and not like the two holes in the prototype. The depths 
of the scour holes that are closest to resembling the ones 
in the prototype are 55 feet and 47 feet. 

Run II - 0.75d scour. 

The additional 1.5 layers of stone were placed 
around the piers. If the sand covered the original rock, no 
removal of the covering was made. This procedure would be 
similar to actual field conditions. The initial appearance 
is shown by Photo 5. It is identical to the final conditions 
of Run I Photo 4 except for the stone addition. In Photo 6 
the crescent shaped scour holes have disappeared. Again sand 
has covered portions of the stone. Within the swingbay area 
the launched stone has met to form a complete obstruction 
between piers. Plate 4 shows the depths for final scour of 


0.75d.

Run III 


l.Od scour. 


34 


Photo 7 has the initial appearance for 1.0 d scour. 
After 504 hours the waterway between the piers is entirely 
covered with stone(Photo 8). Two scour holes (Plate 5) of 
depths 72 feet and 55 feet were obtained, but they are not 
within the area we are interested in. 

Conditions similar to the prototype contour plan 
(Plate 6) we are trying to imitate were not obtained. Approach 
elevations were quite different, with an extremely deep sec¬ 
tion along the left side of the contour plans. 

Run IV --- 

The time factor was then considered as being 
important, and therefore the final conditions for Run III 
were subjected t (^additional 310 hours. The model had then 
been under scouring conditions for a total time of 814 hours. 
After this test no scour holes have appeared. 

Run V- 

The flow pattern was the next factor studied. As 
mentioned before there was a deep section along left side. A 
study of the model cross-sections at the piers by comparing 
them with the similar prototype cross-section Plate 7, further 
assisted in pointing out that the water was tending to flow 
around the ends. This was probably due to the build up of 
sand and rock in the swing-bay area which tended to dam the 
flow and direct it around the ends. This condition led to 
the idea of raising the end elevations to that in the proto¬ 
type, with no section above prototype elevation being removed. 
Photo 9 shows the additional rock in place at the ends. The

new elevations are practically the same as for the final 
conditions of Run III except at the ends where they are 
raised to prototype depth. (Plate 7 Run III). 

Hardly any change had occurred in the area we were 
interested in, after an additional interval of 168 hours of 
flow (total to date 982 hours). The flow had a tendency to 
attack the swing bay section but the height of rock protect¬ 
ion directs the discharge around the ends. 

Run VI --- 

The next step was to direct the flow at the swing 

Cl. 

by area. This was done by placement of a spur (Photo 10). 

After a further 216 hours (1198 hours total) of attack, a 
slight hole was obtained, the deepest depth being 85 feet 
(0.20 ft. model). The water was still concentrating at 
the ends, but to a far lesser extent. 

Run VII --- 

More stone was added to bring the elevation higher 
than the prototype plan but in proportion the swing bay section 
was already above the prototype elevations. The appearance of 
the model bed between piers was now similar to the prototype 
bed with model bed being at a higher elevation. This state 
received 288 hours (total 1486 hours) of continuous discharge 
of 0.11 cusecs over the testing area. Two holes appeared, 

38 feet and 55 feet deep. These values do not compare with 
the prototype case but the factor obtained from the ratio of 
depth of hole to depth of flow between piers is practically 
constant in both model and prototype. This factor is from 
1.5 to 2.0. The final cross-section is drawn on plate 7

SUMMARY 


As in the prototype, stone was placed periodically at 
relatively long intervals. Initial placing had no appreciable 
effect and settlements were associated with the passage of 
bed waves. Continual observation of the erosion and scouring 
abilities of the flow in the coarse sand section of the 
river tray showed developments were very slow. 

The model finally developed two scour holes after the 
launched rock had met. The holes were not of a spectacular 
size but they were there. Attempts to enlarge them by 
concentrating flow to one side of the bridge and adding 
stone in bays where the effect was not wanted did not produce 
enough jetting into the holes to increase their depth up 
to expectation from the prototype.

PART III 


A - PIPELINE CROSSING 


INTRODUCTION 

The problem of crossing rivers for different 
transport media is highly important. Bridge crossings pro¬ 
blems are gradually being overcome. Whenever a tunnel is 
contemplated, its construction may be far below the reach of 
scouring action. Pipelines are placed at great depths or 
suspended by overhead crossings. The procedure of excavat¬ 
ing beyond possible scour depth or constructing a overhead 
crossing may be very costly. Laying the pipe two feet or 
three feet below average river bed level and protecting it 
by installing stone aprons and guide banks is an alterna¬ 
tive that might be acceptable and cheap. 

A suggested design of a pipeline crossing 
(Plate 10) with stone apron protection at an actual site 
(Plate 9) in a mobile bed river was given by Professor 
Blench. The pipeline was in an area where the river was 
deep at the outside of a bend with a large shoal on the 
inside.. A guide bank was designed to be built on this large 
shoal and act as a bank of the river. This guide bank 
would prevent the river from depositing a shoal in the deep 
region and eroding the present one during the course of its 
river changes. 


The pipeline, guide bank, and opposite bank

were protected by stone. Behaviour of such stone aprons has 
been studied in two dimensions (1) while three dimensional 
behaviour under the conditions presented by a variety of con¬ 
ventional river works does not appear to have received much 
attention. It is hoped that the following results assist in 


furthering apron studies.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE 


Attainment of steady channel conditions. 

Since the river tray had been used in analysis of 
another problem before, the existing conditions such as 
meander pattern dependent upon discharge, and two small 
guide banks 1.22 feet apart - 1.5 feet in length, were 
utilized in the pipeline crossing problem. One thing was 
changed and that was to lengthen the non-erodible guide 
banks. They were increased to approximately four feet in 
length. Two diverging non-erodible banks extending from the 
upstream end of our model channel were installed for a 
distance of four feet at a 1 to 1 slope (fig.b). These 
banks for the model were of \ inch plywood.)

The limitations of the tray's weir imposed a 
maximum discharge of 0.11 cusecs. This discharge of 0.11 
cusecs was continued for 140 hours. During the interval of 
time, elevations from water surface to model bed were 
determined and recorded. These soundings (fig. c without 
spur) were taken every 0.2 feet and the reoccurrence of an 


average depth of 0.17 feet in the soundings indicated that

this value could be the regime depth. 


Fig. 





o 


The next step was to obtain a deepening, of the 


regime channel on one side to simulate the prototype. This 
was done by placing an obstruction in line with one of the 
diverging sides and extending one foot into the channel 
proper. (fig. c) Soundings were taken at 0.5 feet along 
the 4 foot portion and at 0.4 feet across the channel. 
Records of the scour along the jutting obstruction like 
a spur were analyzed. In this case the. scour hole at the 
nose was approximately twice regime depth. 


After an interval of 97 hours (total time 237 


hours) a general cross-sectional profile fairly representa¬ 
tive of the prototype was obtained, (Plate 9). 

Determination of Scales. 


The width of the model of 1.22 feet corresponding 


to the width of 650 feet at low water level elevation 83 in 
the prototype (Plate 9) was imposed. The horizontal scale 
is then 1.22 feet equal to 650 feet or 1 foot equals 533 feet. 

The value of 0.17 feet for regime depth represents 


40 feet of depth in the prototype. The vertical scale is

0.17 feet equal to 40 feet or 1 foot equals 235 feet. 

The scale ratio of vertical to horizontal is 0.44. 

Discharge. 

The object of the model was to observe scour under 
extreme conditions. Therefore there was no need to run any¬ 
thing but high discharge. As mentioned before the maximum 
discharge attainable was 0.11 cusecs. 

Model Stone Size. 

The stone protection was assumed to scale accord¬ 
ing to the vertical (or depth scale) so that eighth inch 
material selected would represent 30 inch rocks. The 
specific gravity of the stones used was 2.5. Therefore 
these l/8 !: stones (30 inch) model would be of about 1 ton 
in weight scaled to prototype size. 

Model Layout. 

The plywood banks were removed and replaced by the 
sand of the river tray, (grain size 0.27 ram). A small piece 
of galvanized pipe % inch diameter was placed across the 
river at elevation 65 and sloping upwards towards the guide 
bank where the elevation was 70. The stone apron and guide 
bank were then constructed according to the design on 


Plates 10 and 11.

RESULTS 


A small flow was started with the stone apron and 
guide bank receiving the full flood flow of 0.11 cusecs. in 
approximately 20 minutes. In another 30 minutes the stone 
apron was covered by a large sand wave. The origin of this 
wave could be attributed to a wave just beginning to enter 
the vicinity when the flow was stopped for model construc¬ 
tion or the substituted sand banks were unable to withstand 
the erosion* Since no progress would be attainable for a 
long period, with the obstruction, the flow was discontinued 
and a large channel was excavated upstream to trap sediment 
and let sediment free water erode the transplanted sand bar. 
A number of flows were used for attack on the stone apron. 
These flows were 0.06 cusecs for 46 hours, and 0.11 cusecs 
for 64 hours. The smaller flow was used to gradually adjust 
the channel for larger flows. 

The stone apron launched as expected with the 
dimensions and appearance shown on Plate 12. During this 
interval, the nose of the guide bank was protected by the 
sand bar and no attack on the guide bank occurred. This 
effect on the model could very well indicate that no 
attack would occur 6n the guide bank (prototype) while the 
river was flowing in its present course parallel to the 
guide bank. 

To observe whether the guide bank had been 
adequately designed in the prototype, the flow in the model 
was directed at the upstream end of the bank. The sand

SUMMARY 


From Plate 12 when the flow was in a direction 
parallel to the guide bank as is now present in^prototype, 
scouring upstream of the apron occurred and the launched 
rock displaced the hole further upstream away from the 
pipeline. In the articles on such happenings the launch¬ 
ing may take place at a 1:2 slope. In this case the final 
slope was approximately 1:7. Why there was no scour down¬ 
stream of the stone apron protecting the pipe, will be 
explained in a section describing a stone protected tunnel 
crossing. 

The flow was now directed against the guide bank, 
about 30° to the centre line of the guide bank. The 
original hole was filled in and a long scour hole at the 
base of the bank was obtained. The depths were not excess¬ 
ive compared to some prototype scours discussed. Plate 13 
shows the appearance of the scour hole obtained. The stone 
launched at a slope of 1 upon 5 instead of the theoretical 
1*.2. At the junction of the guide bank stone protection and 
the pipeline stone protection, no indication was found 
whether more stone iaunc^d from one part or the other or 
that excessive action caused deeper scour. Probably launch¬ 
ings took place evenly. 

Another model was constructed with the same dimen¬ 
sions and stone protection in order to obtain the same re¬ 
actions as before. The flow directed against the guide bank 
was at about 30° to the guide bank. Photo 12 shows the

initial appearance and is of the same dimensions and stone 
protection as on Plate 10. For this particular run the 
directed flow was very severe and only a half hour was 
needed to notice the stone launching from guide banks and 
the crossing apron. Within two hours complete destruction 
occurred, which may be due to the breaching of the dike and 
the quickening action of the sand that was used in the con¬ 
struction of the guide bank. This phenomena is shown on 
Photo 13. Essentially the launched stone has taken shape as 
in the preceding model, with the stone launching to a cone 
shape from a circular nose construction. 

The stone has launched in a tapering form of 
protection^that is, 2 layers close to the top and one larger 
at the bottom, while at the intersection, there is no 
evidence of one part launching excessively compared to the 
other. In both cases, the final launching is very close to 
the pipeline. Now the question is, is it the fault of the 
design where more stone was determined for launching down¬ 
stream, and did not occur, or the model layout of the stone 
apron is dependent upon certain model scales. It can be 
shown that excessive scour will occur upstream of a stone 
apron crossing and therefore equivalent amounts should be 
designed on both sides of the pipeline or more stone on the 
upstream side. The model stone aprons were laid to the 
horizontal, scale. One would say that if the stone launches 
to a depth scale why not lay the stone to the vertical scale. 
This factor should be reviewed very closely. Depending upon

would obtain a type of stone rapid design (see Photo 14). 

The ratio of vertical to horizontal should be approximately 
less than one and the stone protection area measured to the 
horizontal scale, but with the volume of stone needed for it

PART III 


B - TUNNEL CROSSING 


INTRODUCTION 

Further studies on apron launchings were made 
available by a proposed design of a stone protected concrete 
tunnel crossing. The tunnel was to be located in a navig¬ 
able channel of fairly uniform cross-section. A model was 
made representing a section in the deepest part of the pro¬ 
totype channel. This model portion was then placed in the 
glass walled flume and studies of stone launching conducted. 
Results from this model indicated that a water surface draw¬ 
down will occur over the w&tr-like obstruction, the weight 
of stone to be used in the' prototype would be inadequate in 
the navigational channel, and the stone designed for slope 
protection would launch satisfactorily.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE 


Attainment of steady conditions. 

The flow through the flume was continued until 
there was no change in the mean depth of flow and whole bed 
consisted of waves. The mean grain size of the bed 
material was 0.27 mm. 

Discharge. 

The initial discharge used was 0.27 cusecs and 
then 0.35 cusecs. The measurement of the discharge was by a 
sharp crested wdter which was calibrated by assuming the 
discharge through a rotameter assembly as being correct. 

(See Fig. 5 for calibration curve). 

Determination of Scales. 

The vertical scale was determined by the mean model 
depth of 0,31 feet for 0.27 cusecs. representing 55 feet in 
the prototype. Therefore the scale is 1 foot is equal to 
178 feet* 

The cross-section dimensions of the tunnel were in 
proportion to the depth and since a unit length of section 
was removed for model construction, the horizontal scale 
chosen is the same as the vertical. Furthermore the flow 
pattern must be the same in both model and prototype. This 
can only be achieved if dynamical similarity exists.

Model Layout and Dimensions. 


Plate 14 shows the prototype and model dimensions 
used for the tunnel crossing study. 

Four layers of stone were placed in order that the 
final protection would be in three layers. 

Apron Stone Size. 

1/8 inch chips of specific gravity 3 were used. 
Scaling by depth scale to the prototype they would repre¬ 
sent 1.8 foot size rock of weight 1100 pounds. 3/8 inch size 
chips were also placed for study, this size would represent 
approximately 6 foot rock of weight 20 tons. 

Procedure. 

Continuous flow over the model was made. Observa¬ 
tions of how the stone launched were kept. Obstructions 
were placed close to the roof and their effects recorded. 
Since only a ship could produce the turbulence to move the 
stone, the model depth had to be raised in order for it to 
correspond to a section of tunnel in the navigational 
portion. This additional depth of 6 feet was obtained by 
increasing the discharge to 0.35 cusecs. At the same time 
the larger size of stone was placed on the roof for study 
under effects of a ship’s propeller and structure. A model 
boat was used to produce the prototype ship effects. The 
downstream portions of rock were continously covered by the

for one run, no stone was placed on the downstream side and 
for two runs stone at different slopes was tried.

RESULTS 


Run 1 -- 0.27 cusecs. - both sides and roof of tunnel 
protected by l/8' ! stone. 

The initial appearance is shown by Photo 15. A 
heavy black line on either side of the model represents the 
mean bed level from continuous flow to obtain steady con¬ 
ditions. The model was under scouring attack for 49 hours 
and Photo 16 shows the final appearance for this interval 
of time. 

The downstream portion has not launched at all. 

It has been covered by the sand that has been carried back 
by a returning jet. This division of sand movement sc curs 
approximately at the location of the arrows on the Photo 16 
The bed has been scoured below mean bed level. Photo 16 
does not show the bed sloping upwards again to the previous 
level where bed waves are again dominant. 

There was a definite drawdown of water surface 
over the tunnel section. The value was 0.03 feet model or 
5 feet prototype. 

Wherever an obstruction was placed in the flow 
approximately 5 to 8 feet above the tunnel roof a movement 
of the stone on the roof occurred. On Photo 16 this rock 
can be seen downstream. The unstable portions seem to be 
the stone on the roof and stone protection on the 1*5 slope 
at the edges of the tunnel.

Run 2 


0.35 cusecs. 


The depth of flow was increased another 6 feet to 
represent a section in the navigational channel whereas the 
previous section was outside the navigational channel. The 
model was under attack for 51 hours. During this time the 
model boat was placed over the roof and movement of stone 
occurred. 

Run 3 -- 0.35 cusecs - top of the roof protected by 
3/8 n rock (prototype 6 foot - 20 tons). 

During this interval of 18% hours the model boat 
with its rotating propellor moved the larger size stone. The 
propellor actually touched some portions and this probably 
started the first few moving and the rest moved much more 
quickly over the exposed tunnel roof which was very slippery. 

Run 4 -- 0.35 cusecs. - downstream slope replaced 
by l/8 n stone at It2 slope. 

The upstream stone protection was untouched, the 
roof protection was left alone with the same stone size of 
3/8 ,? as in Run 3. Since the downstream protected slope had 
been covered by sand, the rock and sand were removed to be 
replaced by new protection at a slope of 1 upon 2 beginning 
at the tunnel edge. This new slope is the slope that the 
rock is to launch to. Photo 17 shows the initial appearance. 
After 98 hours of 0.35 cusecs flow the downstream slope is 
again covered by sand (Photo 18).

Run 5 -- 0.35 cusecs - downstream slope just sand 
backfilled at 1.2 slope. 

The upstream and roof protection were untouched. 

On the downstream face the rock was removed and only sand 
backfill at 1*.2 was left to the elements of scour. The 
downstream slope has the same appearance as Photo 17 except 
the stone is removed. No scour on the slope developed after 
48 hours of attack (see Photo 19). A spur was placed up¬ 
stream to cause a different flow pattern over the tunnel. 

No drastic scour holes occurred on. the downstream portion 
and the upstream stone protection did not fail.

SUMMARY 


The model results indicate that stone of approxi¬ 
mately 20 tons in weight would have to be placed on the roof 
within the navigational channel to withstand the turbulence 
caused by ships' propellors. The stone protection on both 
sides of the tunnel is adequate. On the upstream portion 
launching of stone will occur to a maximum depth measured 
to the trough of a bed wave. Cross-currents may actually 
increase the depth but this cannot be foreseen with the type 
of testing procedure used. Downstream stone protection can 
be decreased to the 1?2 slope design, since no launching of 
this portion will occur, any protection placed in this area 
will be merely a safeguard against turbulence from ship pro¬ 
pellors . 

The decrease in water surface elevation over the 
tunnel is very important. The drawdown is about 6 feet, hence 
a 42 foot depth of water is decreased to 36 feet. If any 
large ships of draft 26 feet to 30 feet must travel upstream, 
the stone will be displaced easil}?.

CONCLUSIONS - for Part III - A & B 


The model of a pipeline crossing protected by stone 
indicated that a prototype construction could be feasible. A 
number of precautions indicated by the model would have to 
be taken: 

1. Where two layers of rock were required on the 

river side of the guide bank, three layers should be specified. 

2. The upstream stone portion protecting the pipeline 
should be increased in order that the width of stone aprons 

for launching on either side of the pipe be equal or in a ratio 
of upstream to downstream protection not less than 1. 

In further studies of similar models layout of 
stone apron areas should be to a scale that will result in 
the model appearing in proportion. 

The study made in Part III - B - Tunnel Crossing - 
showed that downstream scour from flat apron protection occurs 
some distance away, while the sections close to the part 
being protected may be covered by sand. This phenomena was 
observed in Part III - B - Tunnel Crossing, a two dimen¬ 
sional study and also in Part III - A - Pipeline Crossing - 
where the three dimensional effects were taking place. The 
discharges in all cases represented peak values. If the 
models were subjected to a fluctuating discharge different 
results could be obtained. When another similar model is 
made the author suggests a varying discharge be used. These

stone aprons may force low discharges into waterfalls at 
their edges where scour will be severe. 

From these studies the coefficients of scour chat 
can be expected upstream of a stone apron crossing is 1.5. 
This value indicates that scour will occur to a depth 1.5 
times the mean depth of flow for the peak discharge in that 
area measured from water surface. The coefficient along 
a guide bank obtained from Part 3 - A is 1.5. Therefore 
the design of stone aprons and guide bank protection can be 
based on these coefficients if the attack is not too severe. 
These coefficients will have to be increased if the guide 
bank is very short, say its length would be less than 3/4 
of the distance between guide banks. 

Inspection of the launched aprons indicated that 
it was a very rare occurrence to obtain protection on the 
launched slope of more than one layer of rock. This factor 
itself may indicate that less stone should be designed to be 
placed for launching. From the models there was no 
indication of excessive amounts of rock left for launching. 
The reason may be that some of the lighter rock has been 
carried away by the flow and this deficiency probably 


balances the overdesign.

MODEL DISTORTION 





PART IV 


MODEL DISTORTION 


INTRODUCTION 

Three identical submarine crossings were tried out 
as a model test in the study of stone aprons. They were set 
parallel to each other on the centre line of the tray, 
inclined to it at meander cross-over angle and located at a 
distance half a meander length from each other. In this way 
two of the crossings would have very disadvantageous approach 
conditions. 

The construction of the model system was based on 
a number of questions that were to be answered for an exercise. 
Prophesies by the theoretical answers were to be checked by 
model results. 

The attack by the flow in this model was very severe, 
aprons were washed out and scour holes extending across the 
width of the model submarine crossings developed. The original 
model channels were filled in by sand and new channels eroded 
on the opposite sides. A record of this model distortion 
was obtained on 800 feet of 16 mm film.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE 


The fixed conditions upon which the calculations 
were based, for model design, were discharge, bed factor, and 
depth(which is partially dependent upon discharge). Since 
the test was in the interest of aprons, a fluctuating discharge 
was not required. The maximum attainable discharge was 0.11 
cusecs. A depth of approximately 0.2 feet would result from 
the fixed discharge in the east river tray. This fine sand 
of 0.27 mm median grain size fixed the bed factor at a value 
of 1.1. 


Slope 

Assuming a side factor of 0.15, the regime slope 
for 0.11 cusecs. is 0.06%. 

A check for laying out the meandering channel by 
the calculated slope is, the slope across a meander bend is 
3 to 4 times the calculated regime slope. These values are 
based upon the assumption that the length around a bend is 
1.5 to 2 times the distance straight across the bend and the 
friction factor around the curvature of the bend is about two. 
Therefore a slope 3 to 4 times regime slope straight down the 
tray is comparable to the slope measured along the river 
channel. 

Meandering Channel 

The channel was constructed in a meandering condi¬ 
tion based upon the formula meander length being approximately

equal to 36 Q^ v , where Q is measured in a canal section for 
steady discharge. The meander length was computed to be 12 
feet, from this value the meander breadth was 6 feet, assum¬ 
ing meander breadth was one half the meander length. 

Guide Banks 

The distance between guide banks is 1.17 feet. This 
value was obtained from the equation Q*V b d, where 0 is the 
model discharge of 0.11 cusecs., V the velocity determined 
from V /d = Fb (bed factor 1.1), b the width between guide 
banks, and d the depth of flow 0.2 feet. 

Three types of guide banks were made, the first one 
had vertical ends (Apron crossing 10) and the other two had 
sloping ends. One with 1:1 slope(Apron crossing 20) and the 
other with ends at 1:2 slope (Apron Crossing 30). 

Stone Aprons 

The stone was the same 1/8" size as used in other 
models of 0.11 cusecs. discharge, and approximately 0.2 feet 
depth of flow. 

The assumed scour upstream of the stone apron is 
0.2 feet below mean bed level (a coefficient of 2) and scour 
downstream of 0.15 feet below bed level (coefficient of 1.5). 
The rock should launch into a final position of 1:2 slope. 
Therefore the rough formula for laying the stone on the 
initial flat level of 1.5 times the scour depth below bed 
level will be used. Then total width of apron at mean bed 
level before scour is 0.52 feet. This value was obtained 


by addition of flat portions required upstream(1.5 x 0.2 - 0.3)

a section as shown A . level portion should be 

retained for further protection as shown in the following 

_- S=-/a w 

diagram 

Hence an arbitrary 0.08 will be added to 0.52 feet to obtain 
a final design width for the apron of 0.60 feet. 


Model Layout 

Photo 20 shows the appearance and location of the 
test sections. The aprons are 0.6 feet wide by 1.17 feet 
long. The length 1.17 feet being the distance between guide 
banks. The submarine crossings are spaced 6 feet apart and 
practically block the channel. 


Procedure 

The bottom part of the tray and channel was filled 
with itfater in order that the oncoming flow would not scour 
the aprons and erode the sides too badly. Individual photo¬ 
graphs and 800 feet of film were made of the progressive 
changes that occurred in 165 hours that the models were 
tested. Two undergraduates recorded the depth of scour at 
the guide banks and also plotted scour depth vs time (7).

RESULTS 


After 6 hours 

Photo 21 shows the two imposed channels between the 
aprons being filled with sand. Sand has been scoured out in 
the bend above 10 to be deposited in the bend above 20. A 
straight channel is being eroded from 10 to 20 and the 
beginning of the same action is occurring between 20 and 30. 

Apron 10 

Photo 25 shows the apron and guide bank at 0 hours. 
The right guide bank looking upstream is practically block¬ 
ing the channel. This guide bank with the vertical ends and 
its location, will result in producing very disadvantageous 
approach conditions. 

Photo 26 indicates the stone apron has received a 
very severe beating. The flow has completely removed the 
apron on the left side, depositing the stone approximately 
three feet downstream. This is due to the right angle turn 
the river had to make to enter the guide bank channel. A 
hole has been scoured to such a size that the effects are 
felt on the opposite bank. This is a very good case of model 
distortion. 

Apron 20 

Initial appearance is given by Photo 30. The 
opposition to flow is not too great, due to the sloping ends. 

Flow pattern over these ends is not diverted too

quickly to create excessive turbulence for increased scour. 

Photo 31 shows the main flow is occurring parVallel 
to the guide bank Trails. This is due to the direction being 
imposed on the flow by Apron 10. The stone has launched and 
portions of the rock have been carried downstream. The scour 
holes at the upstream noses of the guide banks are smaller 
and are not influencing the opposite bank or each other. The 
channel downstream has not been straightened to the extent as 
crossing 10 straightened the flow. Thus the sloping ends are 
a factor in forming less obstruction to the flow, which is 
clearly indicated by the two submarine crossings with such 
ends. 


Apron 30 

The initial conditions as obstructions to flow 
through the area are not severe. Photo 35 is the initial 
appearance. Photo 36, indicates that the attack was much 
less drastic. Part of the apron has launched and other 
sections have been covered by sand. The length of the scour 
hole has touched the apron to partially influence the launch¬ 
ing. 

After 60 hours 

Photo 22 shows the channel between the outermost 
aprons has been straightened and the flow is gradually being 
switched to the opposite side. Portions of the original 
channels have been left open, a condition that occurs in the 


prototype.

Apron 10 

Further erosion has occurred on the outside of the 
bend (Photo 27) and at the exit of the Apron the original 
bank has been removed. The scour holes at the upstream noses 
have merged, while scour holes at downstream noses have not 
been obtained. 

Apron 20 

Photo 32-by the appearance of the bed waves, the 
flow is directly upon the guide bank. The bed elevations 
have increased considerably and large amounts of sand are 
being transported. At the exit there is a slight turn of the 
flow to follow the original bend. The stone apron is 3:ill 
intact and covered by sand. The shapes of the scour holes 
do not seem to be well defined for sloping end guide banks 
compared to guide banks with abrupt ends. 

Apron 30 

Photo 37 shows the guide banks very nearly covered 
by sand, especially the downstream nose. A large wave of 
sand is intruding the area between guide banks, but no sand 
has been deposited along the guide bank. The apron is still 
probably intact under the coverage of sand. The slight turn 
of the flow from the exit of Apron 20 is now directly in 
line with Apron 30. At the exit of Apron 30 it has been 
diverted to the right again looking upstream and further 
erosion of the bank that was obstructing the exit has occurred.

Again the photograph shows the old channels are still open. 

After 120 hours 

Photo 23,- after the bank in front of Apron 10 was 
eroded, the channel width at the top of the tray has become 
wider. This is shown by the small upright sticks which were 
placed at the meander breadths and on the outside of the bends. 
Further erosion has occurred to develop the new channels on 
the opposite sides. At the exit of Apron 30 a large increase 
in elevation has been obtained. This may be due to the 
enormous amount of sand eroded from the banks to form the new 
channels. 

Apron 10 

The bank in front of the apron has been removed and 
a new attack on this area has developed. The old channel to 
the right is just filled with water and no erosion is taking 
place. The flow is now attacking from a reasonable direction. 
The attacks on the right bank past the exit of Apron 10 is 
less severe. 

Apron 20 

The attack is gradually developing from the right 
as the right bank is being eroded (Photo 33). Upon exit from 
Apron 20 it swings to the left for further widening of the 
channel before entering Apron 30.

Apron 30 

The flow has curved again to enter Apron 30. From 
Photo 38 the large scour hole developed from the left guide bank 
encroachs upon the right guide bank to extend the jetting action 
beyond the guide bank area. Considerable erosion on the right 
sand bank has occurred. The bed has risen to such an extent 
at this particular apron that the water is nearly flowing over the 
wooden guide banks. The approximate increase in elevation is 
0.2 feet. 

After 165 hours 

The rate of bank erosion has slowed down consider¬ 
ably as shown in Photo 24. The new channels are being deepened 
by scouring and seem to be approximately the same depth as the 
original channels. They are directly opposite to the old ones. 
Definite banks were confining the flow originally, but now 
water is flowing through a very much increased, width expecially 
between the guide bank locations. 

Apron 10 

The attack is definitely from the left (Photo 29) 
with the old channel being a spill area. The flow still has 
to make a right angle turn to develop scour holes that are 
typical at vertical end spurs or guide banks.

originally it was from the left. The scour hole extends 
completely across the two guide banks. Bed elevations 
have increased and the flow of water, being disturbed less 
by sloping ends than vertical ends. This is clearly shown 
by the bed waves which are moving in the same direction 
above and below the apron crossing. 

Apron 30 

Photo 39 - the water is flowing over the dikes on 
the left side looking upstream. The same effects that 
occurred at Apron 20 are found in this area. Main channel of 
flow is on the opposite side, with the old channel above Apron 
30 still open but at the exit it is practically filled in. 

The size of the scour hole is larger than at Apron 20 but 
this is due to increased portion of guide bank slope being 
exposed to the flow.(ends slope 1:2).

SUMMARY 


The question of how much scour to expect at obstruc¬ 
tions cannot be answered too well by the results from this 
model. Most models scale their depth of scour to the proto¬ 
type dimensions very well. The slopes of the sides of the 
scour hole are the same in model and prototype. Thus where 
the scour edge extends practically half ways along the guide bank 
in the model, it is not at all representative of what occurs 
in the prototype. In the prototype the edge of the hole is 
very close to the nose of the bank. Good examples of such 
distortions are seen on Photos 21, 26, 27 and 40. Photo 40 
has a very large hole as developed by the direct jet imping¬ 
ing the non-erodible wall. Compared to the width of flow, 
such a scour in the prototype would not occur. The depth of 
this hole is very representative of the prototype when 
scaled correctly. 

a_ 

The scour measurements upstream and downstrem of 
a stone apron crossing could not be obtained. The apron 
stone definitely launched but the distortion developed by 
the scour holes would not give reliable answers to scour 
measurements. Studies made in the previous section will be 
of assistance for this problem. 

The depths to expect at guide bank noses and along 
their length may be obtained from Bibliography 7. Their data 
will give values for final depths. The plots of scour 
depth vs time resulted in curves that showed scour increasing

with time very quickly and then leveling off, but still in¬ 
creasing slowly. Other plots, Bibliography 3, Ahmad, show 
the same results. Therefore final measurements of scour 
depths should be taken approximately after 180 minutes have 
elapsed. 

Some values that have not been too greatly 
affected by the model distortion were chosen to assist in 
verifying some coefficients that are being used. For 
instance the right guide bank of Apron 10 looking upstream 
(Photo 26) has a large scour hole. The attack in this case 
has been very severe and the coefficient obtained is 2.35. 

The sloping ends on guide banks have a very 
definite effect on scour holes. The holes are much shallow¬ 
er and elongated. A coefficient will be quoted but further 
work is necessary and this value of 1.5 is subject to 
revision. If vertical ends had been used on all the guide 
banks, coefficients could have been checked. Finally, the 
straightening effect, would have been developed at a quicker 
rate with vertical ends and a straight canal between sub¬ 
marine crossings may have been obtained. 

The terrific increases in elevation merit dis¬ 
cussion. A slope for the channel was calculated assuming 
no charge being present in the flow. This factor may be 
important but to determine a charge to use in the revised 
slope equation would have been difficult. The slope layouts 
were made from the remaining pipeline apron crossing which 
was used as a controlling point. Setting the slope from

the pipeline crossing may have established too steep a 
gradient and erosion had to occur to flatten the slope. The 
actual slope should have been measured from the exit weir 
at the bottom of the tray and the old pipeline crossing 
removed.

CONCLUSIONS 

The preceding model analysis gave important infor¬ 
mation on bed waves, model distortion, effects of sloping 
ends on protection works and types of scour holes. Further 

studies should be made on guide banks as modeled by 

use4 

Aprons 20 and 30. If a sloping guide bank was^in place of 
Apron 10 the results may have been quite different, but only 
additional model runs will clear the mystery. Definitely 
sloping guide bank ends reduce scour depths and scour effects, 
as : indicated by the model experiment. 

An alternative to pitched islands for river train¬ 
ing could be the construction of such guide banks as were 
modelled. The expense will probably be formidable, but the 
river may be straightened. 

Further work on a model similar to the one tried 
will give valuable answers. Changes could be made in the 
width (to be increased) between guide banks, an increase 
in discharge and better control at the start of the model 
in order to prevent movement of the stone protection. 

of 44vz. causes of 

Close study should be made to prevent- aprons be¬ 
coming covered by the sand. This phenomenon has occurred in 
practically all apron studies made by the author.
