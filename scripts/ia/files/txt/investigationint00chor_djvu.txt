INTRODUCTION 


The demand that religious education he put into 
the public schools is growing rapidly at the present 
time. In Great Britain,the United States and Canada, 
various groups are striving to have religion given a 
place in the schools. Here in Alberta, certain bodies 
are vitally interested in this problem today, some 
striving for religious education and some working 
against it. At the 1948 Convention of the Alberta 
School Trustees* Association, the following resolution 

was passed by the delegates: 

• 

"WHEREAS the School Act of Alberta now makes pro¬ 
vision for setting aside of certain time during 
school hours for religious instruction, and 
WHEREAS many schools are staffed by teachers not 
trained to give such instruction; 

RESOLVED that the Department of Education be 
requested to make provision for proper training 
of teachers in the Faculty of Education to enable 
them to give the necessary instruction. 

"RESOLVED that the Curriculum Committee of the 
Department of Education be requested to arrange 
a syllabus for simple Bible teaching in the 
schools." § 


# The Alberta School Trustee, Vol. XVIII, No. 9, 
TOct. 19487, p. 11.~ 


On the other hand, at the Annual General Meeting

of the Alberta Teachers’ Association the following 

resolution was referred to the Provincial Executive: 

”Be it resolved: That this A. G. M. go on 
record as being opposed to any further extension 
of religious instruction in public schools.” § 


# The Alberta Teachers’ Association Magazine, Vol. 29, 
No. 2, iNov. 19487, p. 38. 


These two quotations show that the question is a live 
one in the province today. One final quotation may 
complete the picture. This one, as reprinted in the 
A. T. A. Magazine, is taken from the Lacombe Globe and 
gives the point of view of one layman. 

’’Although religious study undoubtedly would 
be good moral training, it is too dangerous to 
be practised in the ordinary school curriculum. 
Most of us jealously guard our right to select 
and follow the religion of our choice. To be 
exposed as adults to the various philosophies of 
different religions is part of our religious 
education. But an immature school student might 
be unduly influenced by his teacher’s beliefs, 
no matter how innocently they were put forward. 
Nor is there any guarantee that our sch ool 
instructors today are qualified to pass judgment 
on the Bible’s solemn teachings.” ff 


# Ibid ., p. 8. 

This is an indication of the situation in Alberta 
at the present time. The fundamental aim of this thesis 
is to investigate the desirability of religious education 
in schools, with particular reference to Alberta. 

The limiting of the scope of the subject by relating

it to this province does not make it less important, 
hut, to persons interested in the field of education 
in Alberta, rather enhances its value. To put the 
situation in Alberta in its proper perspective it is 
necessary to examine the situation in the world today, 
and, to understand any part of the problem it is 
necessary to take a brief look at the history that 
led up to the conditions of the present. This 
historical overview of the topic is presented in three 
short history chapters near the beginning of this study. 

The next logical point of attack in a thesis would 
be to present in brief form some of the more pertinent 
statistics on the subject, showing the results of 
former studies and interpreting them. However, there 
are no statistical studies on the topic of religious 
education which delve into the results of programs, 
for there are so many extraneous factors that a study 
on a statistical basis is rendered invalid before it 
is begun. One must deal entirely with opinion from 
one source or another, with a few facts here and there. 
This thesis is not a mere counting of pro and con 
opinions, however, for a definite attempt has been 
made to evaluate the whole situation on the basis of 
the arguments expressed in the literature on the topic, 
and a qualitative rather than quantitative estimate has 
been our objective.

Articles in periodicals proved to be the largest 
source of material for this study. Books, magazine 
articles, and letters from teacher associations, 
Departments of Sducation or their equivalents, 
representative seminaries, and interested individuals 
in each of Great Britain, United States and the other 
provinces of Canada made up the rest of the sources of 
general information. The subject is one that has had 
few books written on it that are valuable as far as 
the Alberta scene is concerned. Most of the material 
that dealt with this province was obtained from letters 
and questionnaires that were sent out late in 1948 to 
all divisional boards, A. T. A. Locals, and persons 
who had shown themselves interested in religious 
education. More information on the provincial situation 
came from the Alberta School Act, interviews and news¬ 
papers. After a picture of the whole situation had 
been obtained by a brief reading of periodicals and 
books, the history of the problem was studied to put 
the present situation in its proper perspective. Alberta 
became the next point of attack, and the provincial 
picture was studied to ascertain the exact position 
of religious education in Alberta schools at the 
present time. The legal aspect of the problem was ob¬ 
tained from the School Act. The sources of pressure 
for and against religious education were examined, with

their respective arguments and counter-arguments. The 
literature on the parallel part of the problem in 
Great Britain, the United States, and the rest of 
Canada was examined to determine whether these areas 
had anything that would shed further light on the 
Alberta problem. The aims and objectives of the various 
world pressure groups were evaluated as to their 
theoretical soundness; that is, to see if the argu¬ 
ments they submitted in favor of religious education 
would withstand scrutiny from the standpoint of theory. 
They were then examined as to practicality, first in 
their own locale and then as tot heir practicability 
in Alberta. What could be used from the schemes that 
had broken under examination? To assume that nothing 
would work because nothing had worked would not be 
sound. The final part of this thesis endeavors to 
present something constructive out of all the foregoing 
analysis, to offer a suggestion as to what might work 
if all the examined schemes failed to stand up.

CHAPTER II 

WHAT IS RELIGIOUS EDUCATION ? 

Literature on the subject affords many definitions 
of religious education, from clear, terse explanations 
to those wrapped in wooly, nebulous phraseology which 
only serves to cloud the original term. These defini¬ 
tions are given from the viewpoint of the child, from 
that of the parent, from that of the teacher and even 
from that of the curriculum, and deal with matters 
ranging from how a religious education program should 
be conducted to what it should accomplish. 

Why is there such a range of possible meanings 
of the term, religious education? Each meaning is 
based on individual differences; that which constitutes 
religious education for one person may mean nearly 
the opposite for his neighbor. As there is no hard, 
cold, definition for religious education, the next few 
pages will be devoted to a survey of some popular 
definitions and a discussion of them, in an attempt 
to find one suitable for use throughout this thesis. 

An article by R. A. Smith# on the subject negates 

# R. A. Smith, "Distinctive Province of Religious 

Education", Religious Education , (Oct. 1927), pp. 863 ff. 


the term, religious education, completely. There is

no such thing, according to that particular writer. 
Education is education, and the inclusion of religion 
in the curriculum does not make it religious education. 
This argument does not impress one as being much more 
than quibbling over words, but other writers# put 

# Cf. G. H. Betts, "What Makes Education Religious", 
Religious Education , (April 1923), pp. 84 ff. 

Cf. L. A. Weigle, "What Makes Education Religious", 
Religious Education , (April 1923), pp. 90 ff. 

forth an argument with real significance. It is the 
idea that education is education and if it is good 
education, it is religious. If education makes the 
individual a constructive, up-building force in 
society, a person who practices decency, kindliness, 
forbearance, justice, honesty and democratic ideals, 
then that education is religious. 

Closely paralleling this line of thought is the 
definition of religious education as non-sectarian, 
non-timetabled religion permeating the whole curri¬ 
culum and the very atmosphere of the school. In such 
a program there would be no formal teaching of 
religion, but incidental religious teaching would be 
going on all the time. This is one of the most favored 
illustrations of religious education#; in other words, 

# Cf. L. E. Cabot, "Unsectarian Religion for Our 
Schools", Religious Ed uc ation , (February 1924), 
pp. 39 - 44.

it is what many people would like to see in the schools. 

In an Alberta school not long ago a travelling 
missionary approached a row of small children and 
asked: 

"Are there any sinners here?” The whole row of 
little heads shook in negation. "Has no one here 
ever told their Mummy a lie?" The denials were less 
vociferous the second time, and finally one little 
girl admitted telling a lie. "Ah, I thought so”, 
said the missionary. Soon the whole class was con¬ 
vinced that they had all sinned.# To some people,

letter now in the authors* files.

Some persons state bluntly that religious education 
is the teaching of the child to live his life for Cod.#

Cf. W. Fallaw, "Uniting Home and Church for 
Religious Teaching", S chool and Society, 
(March 18, 1944), pp.~195 ff. 


Very few writers include the idea of ’living for Cod’ 
in a definition of religious education, except those 
who advocate that such a life should be according to 
given dogmatic principles. In other words, many people 
would accept this definition if the child was to be 
taught according to their own sectarian beliefs.# 

# Cf. S. F. Bacon, "Character Education", Catholic 
World , (July 1935), pp. 483-4. 

Cf. 0. Brady, "Catholic Education", Religious 
Education , (June 1928), pp. 540-5. 

The part the teacher must play in religious 
education is often incorporated in definitions of 
that education, and occasionally is used to form 
the major part of the definition, as in "Religion 
in the Public School" when Blashfield# says: 


# H. Blashfield, "Religion in the Public School”, 
Religious Education , (June 1926), pp. 290-292. 


"We need and must have religious teachers, teachers 
who have had experience and training in religion 
so that they themselves are religious and can 
therefore give a religious interpretation to 
what they teach. .. .When our teactiers leave their 
training schools, they should carry with them to 
their work religious appreciations and values 
which will influence and motivate them as they 
work with the children."

While the part the teacher must play in religious 
education can hardly be over-emphasized, such a role 
is not religious education in itself, but simply an 
indispensable part of the whole* As to what the 
rest of that whole should be, the foregoing definitions 
may illustrate. One final addition may also help. 

Many people are agreed that religious education 
should be a non-sectarian, separate course, non¬ 
evangelical, non-dogmatic, in which religion is 
defined ganerically and in terms of its world sweep: 
Shintoism, Buddhism, Zoroasterianism, Christianity 
and others all having equal emphasis.# 


# Of. W. C. Bagley, "New Proposal for Religious 
Education in England", School and Society , 

(September 4, 1943),pp. 1S9 ff. 

Of. E. C. Cunningham, "An Approach to the (Question", 
Phi Delta Kappan , XXVTII, (Dec. 1946), pp. 167 ff. 

Cf. W. Fallaw, "Where is Religious Education Now?”, 
Christian Century , (January 21, 1948), pp. 74-76. 


In the School Act of the Province of Alberta, the 
following provisions are made • 

"All schools shall be opened by the reading, 
without explanation or comment, of a passage of 
scripture to be selected from those prescribed or 
approved for that purpose by the Minister, to be 
followed by the recitation of the Lord’s Prayer: 

"Provided that any Board may, by resolution, 
dispense with the scripture reading or the reci¬ 
tation of the Lord’s Prayer or both." #

of Alberta, Sec. 156, p. 58.

"No religious instruction shall be permitted 
in any school from the opening of the school until 
one half-hour previous to its closing in the 
afternoon, after which time any such instruction 
permitted or desired by the Board may be given.# 

# Ibid ., Sec. 157, p. 58. 

The foregoing illustrations can be classified into 
three main types. 

(1) The first type includes the compulsory 
exercises stipulated in the Alberta School Act , and 
consists of prayer and reading of the Scriptures 
without comment. Those persons who are championing 
the cause of religious education in Alberta feel that 
this type is desirable, but most of them also feel 
that such instruction is not enough. 

(2) The second type consists largely of sectarian 
instruction in, and interpretation of, the Christian 
religion. This is the most common of the three types, 
and has many minor variations. Several sects may co¬ 
operate and arrange a syllabus which is agreeable to 
themselves. Within the group, such a syllabus may 

be considered non-sectarian; outside the group it 
must be classed as sectarian. 

(3) The third type consists of the impartial and 
objective study of all the great religions, with the 
aim of understanding them and the people who adhere to 


them.

As the first type is compulsory in Alberta at 
the present time, it does not require examination 
here. The only argument against it is advanced by 
many people for either of two reasons. Some feel 
that it is inadequate and for that reason it should 
be discarded. Others feel that it is inadequate and 
that it should be reinforced by the introduction of 
the second type mentioned above. 

Because the third type of religious education, 
consisting of a study of all religions, is not common 
in public schools, consideration of this problem 
has been deferred to the last chapter. 

Religious education of a sectarian nature is the 
type of religious instruction which is most common 
today, and around which most of the controversy 
arises. It is to this type of religious education 
that reference is made in the remainder of this thesis, 
exclusive of the final chapter. If occasionally 
another type is mentioned, that type will be explained 
specifically.

CHAPTER III 

A BRIEF HISTORY OP RELICIOUS EDUCATION IN 

GREAT BRITAIN, THE UNITED STATES AMD CANADA 

In a study of the present status of religious 
education in Great Britain, the United States and 
Canada, terms recur throughout the literature which 
need clarification. Terms such as ’combined sylla¬ 
buses’, ’the Cowper-Temple clause’, ’released time’, 
’dismissed time’, ’the principle of separation*, 
’parochial schools’, ’provided schools’, and ’the 
Anson By-law’ are scattered through the material, 
used as if they were household words, but which 
require clarification for the ordinary reader. 

Besides the question of terminology, the literature 
raises other problems as well. Why have the programs 
of dismissed and released time developed to such a 
degree in America, while in Britain combined sylla¬ 
buses are more popular; how has the Canadian picture 
become a composite of both? To answer such questions 
as these, a brief study of the history of the develop¬ 
ment of religious education in these three countries 
is necessary. Three chapters are now devoted to a 
brief examination of the path religious education has 

followed in Great Britain, the United States and 


Canada

HISTORY OF RELIGIOUS EDUCATION 

IN GREAT BRITAIN 

England and Wales 

For at least a thousand years in England and 
Wales there has been a close connection between 
religion and education. This is shown by the events 
of that period, leading from complete control of the 
educational system by the Church (Catholic) in the 
Middle Ages, to the passing of the Education Act of 
1944 wherein the Government declared that "the school 
day in every county school and in every voluntary 
school shall begin with collective worship on the 
part of all pupils in attendance at the schools jf This

transition over the centuries from Church control to 
State domination has been a painful one; it has 
occupied a large place in public speculation, and 
taken a great deal of Parliamentary time, especially 
in the last 150 years. To outline in detail the 
various steps in the transition would occupy many 
volumes, for Church and State, denominational rivalries, 
and individual freedoms have all become involved in 
religion and education. All that this chapter can do, 
then, is to trace briefly the broad changes that have

occurred as far as religious education in schools in 
England and Wales is concerned<> 

Education in England was under ecclesiastical 
control for centuries. "In England, the monasteries 
were the early places of education, and later, 
following the lines of the Continental Church system, 
when bishoprics were organized and cathedrals estab¬ 
lished, a school formed part of the cathedral establish¬ 
ment. Here one of the clerks of the bishop ... taught.” § 

# A* E. Ikin, "The State and Religious Education in 

Great Britain and Ireland", The Year Book of Education, 
p. 231 

After the Norman conquest, the Church endeavored 
to retain her control of educational matters and a 
custom developed that the Bishop granted a license 
authorizing a person to teach, and only those who held 
such a license could teach. By 1400, however, other 
persons were setting up schools despite threats and 
actual sentences of excommunication. Because of 
persecution these teachers began proceedings in the 
London City Courts for permission to teach without the 
consent of the ecclesiastical authorities. In 1410, 
as the result of a case in this court, it was 
ruled that a person could not be punished for teaching 
without a license from the Church. Soon after this 
we find evidence of private endowments being made

(e.g., to Sevenoaks Grammar School in 1432) on the 
condition that a schoolmaster, not a priest, should 
preside in the school® 

In the fourteenth to sixteenth centuries there 
was a slow growth of reaction against the Catholic 
Church and the authorities used repressive measures 
in an attempt to stamp it out® Parliament, in 1401, 
forbade any sect (e.g., Lollards) to found churches or 
schools; in addition, ¥/yclif f s books were banned from 
any educational institution. The State was taking a 
more active interest in religious education. 

With the Reformation, education came to be dealt 
with by the State for political purposes. In schools 
which were established or re-established during the 
Reformation period, the study of the Bible was generally 
included as a fundamental part of the curriculum. The 
national feeling against the possibility of subjection 
to a foreign power increased the feeling in favor of 
the changed religious outlook. The Reformation thus 
introduced a new basis for elementary education, the 
necessity of personal study of the Scriptures in order 
to secure salvation. It was considered by the Reformers 
that the reading of the Bible in the language of the 
people was essential, fundamental and necessary, while 
in the view of the Church of Rome the Bible was only

in the pre-Reformation schools the scholars received 
a traditional indoctrination in Catholic beliefs and 
practices. 

During the reign of Edward 71 Parliament decreed 
that once a week the clergyman in each parish should 
instruct the children of that parish in their 
Catechism. This is one of the earliest examples of a 
state legislating compulsory education, the instruction 
being religious and given by the Established Church. 

From the time of the Reformation until the 1900 f s 
Roman Catholic education may more easily be considered 
as a separate section. After the Reformation Catholics 
were a persecuted minority and this persecution, as 
well as the Catholic tradition in education, resulted 
in the growth of a separate Roman Catholic school 
system. No Catholic schools existed from Elizabeth’s 
time till that of lames II when a few schools were 
established. Most of these were closed when James was 
deposed; the only school which could claim continuity 
from that period was a school at Twyford, near 
Winchester. This school later became St. Edmund’s 
College. Another school was founded in 1762 at Sedgely

Park. With the exception of these two schools, all 
other schooling of Catholic gentry took place on the 
Continent where English Catholics had established 
schools of their own. 

With Catholic emancipation in 1829, and the 
Irish famine of 1846, together with the moral and 
intellectual force of Manning and Newman (of the 
Oxford Group movement) Catholic education entered 
into a new period. After 1829 a large number of 
secondary schools were opened, many of them convents 
for girls. Although Catholic elementary schools 
received grants in 1849, it was not until 1902 that 
any Catholic secondary schools began to receive Board 
of Education grants. In these schools, as in the 
Catholic elementary system, the standards and the 
methods do not differ much from Protestant or council 
secondary schools, but a certain consciousness of 
different tradition is jealously preserved. The 
President of the Annual Conference of Catholic 
Colleges in 1936 thus defined the difference: "Our 
boys are to preserve trust faithfully; they must 
feel not merely equality, but a sense of difference, 
a sense of superiority of their Catholic culture, 
a conviction that they hold a key position containing 
the adequate and ultimate solution of all problems. 
They must be wary of the corroding acid of neo-pagan

contact, and without being prigs or recluses, look 
upon themselves as a race apart.” # 

# N. Hans, "Educational Traditions in The British 
Commonwealth of Nations and The United States of 
America,” The Year Book of Education , 1938, p. 750. 

The Irish immigration into English industrial 
centres after the 1846 famine in Ireland changed the 
Roman Catholic position in education. The elementary 
education of the poor or of children of the industrial 
group had not been so important before, because 
Catholic educators had been dealing with people of 
the middle or upper classes able to afford private 
tuition for their children. The few Catholic elemen¬ 
tary schools in existence now had to be augmented by 
many others in order to handle the Irish children. 

In 1847 the Catholic Poor School Committee was formed, 
and succeeded in 1849 in getting its first Government 
grant on equal terms with the National Society and the 
British and Foreign Schools which had been receiving 
grants since 1833. When attendance for all children 
of elementary school age became compulsory in 1870, 
Catholics were able to build enough schools to 
accommodate all Catholic children able and willing to 
attend. Thus Catholic children were saved from having 
to go to the undenominational Board schools. In the 
Catholic elementary schools at present ”the standards.

the methods, the teachers and the inspectors are the 
same as in other elementary schools, the only 
difference being a special religious atmosphere, 
which is often lacking in the provided (i.e. government) 
schools.” # 

# Ibid ., p. 749. 

The Industrial Revolution created changes in the 
British educational system. One of the effects of the 
Revolution was that it forced people to live in great 
concentrations of population. The children of the 
poor ran the streets or sweated in workshops, mills 
and factories. "Although there was provision in 
many endowed Grammar Schools for the education of the 
poor, there was little in the way of real elementary 
education. By the end of the eighteenth century 
there were already many Parish and Dame schools, but 
the Charity and Sunday schools were more influential 
and more important. The former, mainly established 
by the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, did 
some good work at the end of the century, and the 
latter, originally founded by Robert Raikes in 1780, 
did not confine themselves to religious teaching, but 
taught reading, writing, and sometimes, cyphering.” #

Public opinion about the condition and ignorance 
of the apprentices developed and in 1802 Parliament 
passed an act on their behalf. It specified that 
apprentices should get one hour of instruction in the 
Principles of the Christian Religion* ©very Sunday; 
the Master or Mistress of the apprentices was to pay 
the teacher, and the instruction, for the most part, 
was assumed to be under the guidance of the Anglican 
Church. However, even this one hour of instruction 
was avoided by the owners; they criticized the Act 
as 1 harsh 9 , *aggressive*, and 1 impracticable f . #

About this time two societies for promoting 
elementary education came into being; they depended 
upon subscriptions and small fees to run their schools. 
In order to economize, and yet contact the largest 
number of children possible, they adopted the Monitor* 
system whereby the teacher instructed older boys and 
girls of the school and these monitors instructed the 
other children. One society was the f National 
Society for Promoting the Education of the Poor in 
the Principles of the Established Church’. As its 
name suggests, the National Society was an Anglican 
organization, having as one of its main aims the

instructing of children in Anglican principles. The 
other society, the ’British and Foreign Schools 
Society’ (1808) was founded largely to advance the 
educational ideas of a Quaker, Joseph Lancaster. In 
British and Foreign schools, open to children of any 
sect, Bible reading constituted the only formal 
religious education given to the children. 

Representatives of the two factions fought for 
over half a century, both in Parliament and out, about 
various religious questions. "There were deep rooted 
differences: ... on the one side men who regarded 
instruction in reading, writing and arithmetic, with 
simple Bible reading without note or comment, as one 
of the greatest needs of the day; on the other side 
were men equally honest and desirous for children’s 
education, but who considered that religious 
education in the principles and customs of the Church 
of England was of far more value than other forms of 
more secular instruction. ... Soon these differences 
developed into the question of whether the State 
should provide education or whether education was 
not similar to preaching and entirely a matter for 
the Church to deal with." #

In 1807 and 1833, attempts were made through 
Parliamentary bills to have a state education system 
set up, but Church opposition was too great• An 
1820 bill with the same purpose fell into disfavor 
for opposite reasons because it contained clauses 
saying that the schoolmasters of the proposed 
national system should be members of the Established 
Church. 

In August of 1833, though, a grant of $8,000 
was made to aid education* Both the National and 
British and Foreign School Societies were able to 
draw on the fund, but only when they wished to build 
schoolso By 1839 other groups were building schools 
so a Committee of the Privy Council was appointed by 
Q,ueen Victoria to administer government grants to 
education, and to arrange for inspection of schools* 

Various bills in Parliament between 1837 and 
1870 attempted to set up government normal schools 
or a state-controlled system of education, but the 
’religious 5 battles forced withdrawal of the bills* 
In 1847 State aid was extended to Methodist and 
Roman Catholic schools and to Jewish schools in 
1851* 

By the Education Act of 1870 (relating only 
to elementary education), a national system of 
education was organized alongside the voluntary,

or church-supported systems, which continued to be 
given State grants. Thus, the ’dual 1 system came 
into being. In the new government Board schools 
(i.e. under the authority of a School Board), 
religious instruction was separated from the other 
subjects by being definitely time-tabled either for 
the beginning or the end of the school daily session; 
if the Board wished religious instruction in their 
school or schools then the teachers had to give that 
instruction* Parents were free to withdraw their 
children from, the period of religious instruction - 
but not from the school. In order to avoid the 
possibility of Anglican or Roman Catholic doctrines 
being given in the religious education period, the 
famous Cowper-Temple clause was included in the Act; 
"No religious catechism or religious formulary which 
is distinctive of any particular denomination shall 
be taught in the school." # This, naturally, did 

# Ibid *, p. 248. 

not apply to schools not provided by the local 
Education Authority. 

In addition, to remove all risk of the State 
interfering with religious instruction anywhere, 
the school inspectors were now to examine schools

only with regard to the secular instruction given. 
Previously, inspectors in areas where there were 
Anglican schools were appointed only with the con¬ 
currence of the Archbishop of the Province in which 
the schools were situated, and the inspectors had 
made yearly reports to the Archbishop* 

By the Education Act of 1902, the School 
Boards were abolished and the County Councils, 

County Borough Councils and certain Borough and 
Urban Councils were made the Local Education 
Authorities (LEA’s). These LEA’s became responsible 
for all education below the Universities. They were 
to help maintain, out of taxes, government schools 
and also grant money to voluntary schools. Where 
the LEA gave such a grant it expected to appoint two 
of the school’s six •managers’; the religious 
instruction was placed in the hands of these managers, 
not of the clergyman or priest. Though denominational 
authorities had some say in the character of the 
religious instruction, the mode was left entirely to 
the discretion of the managers. 

The Anson By-Law, formulated for guidance of the 
newly-formed LEA’S and optional for each LEA, allowed 
parents to send their children to school only when 
secular instruction was being given. This withdrawal 
could only be made if the parent wished the child to

have religious instruction in his own church or 
some other place (at the same time as the religious 
instruction was being given in the school). It was 
not very practical in small rural or urban school 
areas and a partial solution of the problem was 
found later in *agreed syllabuses*. 

"In 1922 the Cambridgeshire Education Committee, 
wishing to give greater fullness and educational 
efficiency to the religious instruction in its 
schools, called together a group of Biblical and 
theological scholars representative of work in 
elementary and secondary schools and members of the 
Authority itself to devise a Syllabus, which it 
issued in 1924. Taking the Cowper-Temple clause 
(of the 1870 Education Act) to mean what we have 
seen that its authors intended (i.e. Christian, 
but not denominational teaching) the compilers of 
the Syllabus sought to discover how much the Churches 
had in common, and what might therefore legitimately 
be taught. The extent of agreement was unexpected 
and inspiring. The basis of the Syllabus was the 
Bible, the oecumenical Creeds, the story of the 
Christian Church, Christian ethics, and of course, 
Christian worship. While prepared for the guidance 
of teachers in the elementary schools in the first 
instance, the Syllabus did in fact provide for all

By agreeing to use one of these syllabuses in 
voluntary (church) schools the LEA f s were increasingly 
able to take over control of these schools* For this 
reason the number of Anglican schools, for example, 
fell between 1901-1938 from 11,552 to 8,979* 

By the 1936 Education Act the government moved 
a little nearer complete control of the school system, 
because in return for tax-aid in building Anglican 
or ^oman Catholic secondary schools, the LEA f s were 
empowered to appoint all teachers in these schools 
except for a few teachers who were to give religious 
education in the tradition of the school* The LEA 
might also stipulate that as a f term f of a grant 
agreed syllabus instruction should be given in a 
voluntary school so aided (i.e* in voluntary schools 
other than Roman Catholic)* The LEA could also force 
voluntary schools to give agreed syllabus instruction 
if there were children in the voluntary school who 
desired such instruction, but who could not conveniently 
attend a provided school. This, again, did not affect 
Catholic schools because only Catholic children 
attended them. Parents continued to be allowed to 
withdraw their children from school religious instruc¬ 
tion if they could satisfy the LEA that at the time¬ 
tabled period of such instruction their children were

age groups up to 16 and the material was selected 
and arranged to suit the developing powers of 
children year by year from infancy to early adoles¬ 
cence, so that by the time the pupil left school he 
should have a clear grasp of the contents of the 
Bible and the elements of the Christian faith in 
outline and should have been trained in the practice 
of worship. The Cambridgeshire Syllabus was adopted 
by a large number of other Authorities, and speedily 
some of the greater Authorities produced Syllabuses 
of their own, on amilar lines, which also found 
favor elsewhere. By 1939 there were few of the 
Authorities which were not using one or other of the 
well-known Syllabuses - the Cambridgeshire, the West 
Riding of Yorkshire, the Cumberland, the new Surrey - 
and several of the pioneer ones had been revised and 
developed, notably in respect of their doctrinal 
content. In 1945 a national basic outline of 
religious instruction was prepared as a guide for 
Agreed Syllabus Committees by a committee of repre¬ 
sentatives of The Joint Conference of Anglicans 
and Free Churchmen, the Association of Education 
Committees and The National Union of Teachers.” $

religious instruction prepared by the above committee.

receiving competent religious instruction elsewhere. 

By 1939, then, the situation was briefly this: 

(1) Agreed Syllabus arrangements were helping to 
reduce the number of Protestant voluntary schools. 

(2) The Government was working towards a system 
that would include as many schools as possible. 

(3) The teachers objected to the Dual system 
because they had to face religious tests when 
seeking positions in any of the many voluntary 
schools. 

(4) The voluntary schools would not agree to the 
surrender of their schools until they could get 
satisfactory guarantees as to future religious 
instruction in those schools. 

(5) The Catholics and Anglo-Catholics, not being 
able to accept agreed syllabus procedure, were 
still protesting that their supporters were 
carrying too heavy a financial load in supporting 
two school systems. 

The Education Act of 1944 brought about the most 
recent changes in the British educational system. 

These changes are concisely stated in a recent pamphlet.#

"The Act provides that the school day in 
every state-aided Primary and Secondary School 
shall begin with a collective act of worship, 
and that religious instruction shall be given 
in all these schools for all children attending. 
The Conscience Clause has naturally been 
retained; and at the request of parents, children 
may be excused from attending. The LEA may also 
allow parents to withdraw their children, and 
send them to another County (i.e. government) 
or Voluntary School for religious worship and 
instruction of a kind that they desire their 
children to have, or they may allow the parents 
to make other arrangements, satisfactory to the 
LEA, for the religious instruction of their 
children during the school day. Where child¬ 
ren are withdrawn for religious instruction on 
these conditions, it must not be to the pre¬ 
judice of their secular instruction... . 

"The religious instruction and worship in 
any County School must not be ’distinctive of 
any particular religious denomination’, but 
must be conducted in accordance with an Agreed 
Syllabus. The Act made special provision for 
the drawing up of such a syllabus. Each LEA 
was to convene a conference, on which should be 
represented the Church of England {except in 
Wales and Monmouth), other important religious 
groups in the area, teachers’ associations, 
and the Authority itself. The work of this 
conference was to frame a non-sectarian syllabus 
acceptable to the Churches and to the Authority, 
which could then be adopted and used in all the 
County Schools in the area, and in the Voluntary 
Schools when necessary. The syllabus is expected 
to be used by teachers only as a guide. The 
LEA’S' also have power to appoint standing 
advisory councils on religious matters connected 
with religious instruction, whose function is 
particularly to give help and advice to the 
teachers. 

"In many areas, similar syllabuses had been 
in use for several years before the Act, and 
this is one more instance where common practice 
has been given statutory force. 

"All the teaching in the County Schools 
must be undenominational. In particular cases,

however, in County Secondary Schools where the 
school is not near a Voluntary Secondary School 
of a particular religious denomination to which 
parents of children in the County School belong, 
the LEA may provide facilities for instruction 
and worship in that denomination, so long as the 
denomination, and not the LEA, bears the full 
responsibility for any cost involved. 

"For the Voluntary Schools not able to main¬ 
tain themselves financially the Act has offered 
the choice of the following alternatives: 

(1) If the managers of the school are unable or 
unwilling to pay half the cost of alterations 
and improvements necessary to bring the buildings 
up to the required standards, and to keep them 
to that standard, all financial obligations pass 
to the LEA. The LEA will also assume the power 
to appoint and dismiss teachers, but the managers 
have the right both to a voice in the appoint¬ 
ment of a headmaster or headmistress, and to be 
satisfied concerning the appointment of a 
proportion of the teachers (not more than one- 
fifth of the teaching staff), who as ’reserved’ 
teachers, may give denominational instruction 
for not more than two periods a week for those 
children whose parents desire it. Apart from 
this denominational teaching, the religious 
instruction given in the school will be according 
to an Agreed Syllabus. Schools in this category 
are now known as ’Controlled Schools’. 

(£) If the managers of a Voluntary School are 
able and willing to meet half the cost of 
necessary alterations and improvements, the 
remaining half is met by a direct grant from 
the Ministry. The powers and duties of the 
managers in the appointment and dismissal of 
teachers and the giving of denominational 
instruction remain substantially as they v/ere 
before the Act, but religious instruction 
according to an Agreed Syllabus must be given 
to children whose parents so desire it. Schools 
in this category are known as ’Aided Schools’. 

"For the first time, the religious beliefs 
of the teachers are taken into consideration. 

No teacher may be penalized in any ?/ay for his 
religious beliefs or absence of them. Nor may 
any teacher be compelled to attend collective 
worship or to give religious instruction. 

Managers of Voluntary Schools and the LEA’S may,

of course, take into consideration the 
religious tenets of teachers when making 
appointments for staff in Aided schools, 
and for reserved teaching positions in 
Controlled or Special Agreement Schools• 

"The wording of the Act made it quite 
clear that the religious instruction should 
be regarded as a normal part of the school 
day. Regular inspection of religious in¬ 
struction by His Majesty’s Inspectors is 
provided for in all schools which abide by 
an Agreed Syllabus. Voluntary Schools which 
do not observe an Agreed Syllabus may make 
their own arrangements for the inspection 
of religious instruction#" 

A brief summary of the points in this chapter 
may clarify the material covered. 

The first schools were under Church juris¬ 
diction and were taught by clergymen. 

The next schools were still under Church 
influence but had laymen as teachers, though many 
of the first type of schools were still in existence# 
After the Reformation the Church of England 
monopolized education and repressed (as had the 
Catholic Church) other religious groups interested 
in education. The Anglican schools were mainly for 
members of the upper classes. 

Much later both the Established Church and 
humanitarian interests began elementary schools 
for the poor# 

The state finally granted money to these groups 
and had to follow it with control in the form of a

Committee of the Privy Council (the forerunner of 
the Ministry of Education). 

A long battle ensued between proponents of 
state control and church control of education. 

A compromise was reached whereby a ’dual* 
system was set up - church and state schools. 

Religious education was allowed in state schools, 
but because of denominational conflicts and secular 
pressure all sectarian instruction was prohibited in 
state-supported schools. The teacher was to give the 
religious instruction; no right of entry could be 
had by clergymen or priests. 

The church schools, needing and receiving 
government grants and tax aid, had to reciprocate 
by yielding partial control of their school 
management to the LEA’s. 

This control eventually extended to partial 
control of the mode of religious education given in 
some church schools. 

A number of the non-Oatholic groups compromised 
on the question of sectarian differences by working 
out Agreed Syllabuses for those Voluntary Schools 
where they had to- yield control to the LEA. 

The government eventually adopted the plan of 
agreed syllabuses for all schools under its control.

Voluntary Schools (Anglican, Roman, Catholic, 
Methodist, etc.) are in most instances still free 
to give their own sectarian instruction. 

The British Government (with respect to England 
and Wales) is, in a sense, in the same position as 
was the Catholic Church and later the Church of 
England, in that it actively supports a form of 
religious education in the schools of the land. 

Scotland 


"In England, as shown in the earlier part 
of the present survey, the religious question 
has loomed large for a century and a quarter 
whenever education matters have been under con¬ 
sideration, but as far as Scottish educational 
matters are concerned the religious question 
has been raised very seldom during that period, 
either in Parliament or locally. This is due 
to the fact that controversies within the 
Church of Scotland have not arisen out of 
matters of faith, but out of practical questions 
of Church government, and of the relations of 
Church and State; whereas in England, questions 
of faith and belief have loomed large and 
the emotional feelings of the disputants have 
been aroused." #

Great Britain and Ireland", The Year Book of

In 1696 an Act was passed setting up a parish 
school system to be supported by the heritors and 
the Kirk-session. This Church influence has con¬ 
tinued to the present day. In these early parish

and burgh schools the Bible and the Westminster 
Shorter Catechism were the texts upon which the 
teacher based ’cultural 1 education. 

By the 1872 Education Act for Scotland, 
popularly elected schools boards were to take over 
the management of parish and burgh schools with 
power to give religious instruction. Consequently, 
in these Board schools the old texts continued to 
be used. The time for religious instruction was to 
be timetabled before or after regular work, children 
were to have a right of withdrawal, inspectors were 
not to be concerned with religious education and a 
majority of voters might vote to discontinue religious 
instruction in schools in their area. Almost all the 
public schools in Scotland were transferred to these 
Boards; only a few Episcopal and Roman Catholic 
church schools remained outside, forming a ’dual 1 
system. 

The 1918 Education Act ended the ’dual’ system 
by transferring church schools to the jurisdiction 
of the education authorities, the school boards. 
Schools that did not comply with the Act ceased to 
receive government grants. Schools transferred 
were allowed to retain their denominational character 
and the teachers were all appointed by the education 
authorities with the reservation that teachers thus

appointed had to be approved by representatives of 
the church body concerned. The time set apart for 
religious instruction, in these cases, was not to be 
less than given before transfer. In addition, a 
supervisor of religious education was to be appointed 
by each education authority to report on the quality 
of religious education given in the area under the 
authority’s jurisdiction. New denominational schools 
might also be established under these conditions with 
the consent of the Scottish Education Department. 

School inspectors, as in the 1872 Act, continued to 
have nothing to do with the religious instruction 
given in any Board school. 

Under the Education (Scotland) Act of 1945 
parents continue to have the right of withdrawal for 
their children and inspectors continue to inspect only 
secular school subjects. One change, however, is that 
the traditional half hour of religious instruction may 
now be given at any time during the school day. The 
religious instruction is also now a matter for which 
education authorities are expected to make arrangements 
at all levels of education; what was once optional is 
now obligatory. In addition, under the Act the existing 
custom in many Scottish schools of ’Services of Praise 
and Worship’ is recognized. 

In 1947, because of the greatly increased numbers

of students at teacher training colleges the 
churches had great financial difficulty in main¬ 
taining lecturers in religious education at the 
four teacher training centers. The State, therefore, 
took over from the churches the responsibility for 
the optional religious education courses given to 
student teachers. The lecturers will be appointed 
by the State subject to consultation with the Church 
of Scotland and the Free Churches. 

Various groups in Scotland have also come to¬ 
gether in recent years to work out agreed syllabuses. 
The Joint Committee on Religious Education, for 
example, representing the Scottish Churches, the 
Educational Institute of Scotland, and the Association 
of Directors of Education in Scotland, has published 
syllabuses of religious instruction. These have been 
authorized by many of the Local Education Authorities 
for use by teachers in their schools. § 

# See appendix for what children in the Primary 

Division, for example, will be taught in the fifth 
year or that Division. {scotch children attend 
an infant Section from five to seven years of age 
and the Primary Division from age seven to age 
twelve. Thus the fifth year of the Primary 
Division corresponds roughly with the Alberta 
sixth grade.)

churches, teachers, and local school authorities has

extended to the appointment of a minister to each 
school as a Chaplain. The Chaplain consults with 
the Head Teacher of the school as to the help he 
may render the teachers. 

In conclusion, we see that although the schools 
in Scotland are now under a common administrative 
authority freedom of religion for Christian groups is 
preserved. Any religious group, Protestant or 
Catholic, mustering sufficient pupils, may ask for 
a school where its own particular denominational 
instruction is to be given. Smaller and scattered 
(Protestant) sects have been given satisfaction from 
the dominant Presbyterian group through the formation 
of agreed syllabuses. The State actively supports 
the giving of religious instruction in all schools. 
Scotland seems to have solved, for itself at least, 
problems of general policy and administration that 
still trouble England and that are very live issues 
in the United States of America at present. 

It is to these controversial problems of Church 
and State, tax support of denominational schools, 
and religious education in the public schools that w© 
turn now in a brief historical survey of the United 


States

CHAPTER IV 

RELIGIOUS EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES : 

ITS DEVELOPMENT AND PRESENT PRACTICES 

The history of religious education in the schools 
of the United States is closely bound up with the prin¬ 
ciple of separation of church and state. A survey of 
the development of that principle in America will help 
in following the trend of religious education in that 
country. Johnson and Yost, in their book. The 
Separation of Church and State , # say: "By many, it 

# A. W. Johnson, E. H. Yost, The Separation of Church 
and State , p. 1. 

[the separation of church and state] is considered to 
be the greatest contribution to civilization the people 
of the United States have made." This unique factor 
in American life evolved slowly, from the ideals of 
liberty-seeking colonists who had suffered persecution 
for their beliefs to a nation*s expression of faith 
which has been alive and growing for the past century 
and a half. 

It was Roger Williams who enunciated this prin¬ 
ciple and strove for its inception in the colony of 
Rhode Island. In 1636, Williams began his campaign 
which aimed at a republican form of government and 
religious liberty through complete separation of cbnrch

and state. He attained his aim in 1647, when he was 
granted a charter in England which recognized the 
separation of church and state. 

In other colonies, there was a myriad of 
religious conflicts. In the middle colonies, such as 
New Jersey and Delaware, religious tolerance existed* 

In Maryland, settled by Catholics in 1634, there had 
been passed the Toleration Act (1649), which provided 
that "no person ... professing to believe in Jesus 
Christ shall be in any way troubled ... for his religion 
... so that he be not unfaithful to the Lord proprietory 
or conspire against the government established." § 

# P* 

This first act of toleration in America fell short of 
granting full religious freedom by excluding non- 
Christians. Pennsylvania offered religious liberty to 
all who could acknowledge God, but enforced certain 
religious restrictions on people who sought office in 
the government. On the other hand, many colonies tried 
to perpetuate and retain one religion to the exclusion 
of all others. Thus, in the Carolinas and Georgia, 
where the Anglican churchmen were outnumbered by 
dissenters, the monopoly of the church was enforced 
in practice. The Protestant sects were generally 
against the Catholics and the Jews. In Virginia, the

problem of religious tolerance became acute in 
1776, when Jefferson and Madison secured the passage 
of a bill which legalized all forms of worship and 
exempted dissenters from parish rates. This bill was 
debated back and forth till 1785, when Madison brought 
about the passing of ’The Virginia Act for Establishing 
Religious Freedom*, which disestablished the Episcopal 
Church, abolished all parish rates, and forbade the 
use of all religious tests for office. Other states 
were not slow in following this action and cleavages 
between church and state began to appear. 

There were many reasons for this new attitude of 
tolerance. The attempt of the Church of England to 
establish an episcopacy and tax the colonies (at a 
time when feeling regarding taxation was already high), 
was a rallying point for the New England Protestants. 
The grov/th of wealth had emphasized the present and 
its enjoyment, and diminished in men’s eyes the 
importance of credal differences. The growing trade 
of the states had led to an exchange of ideas. Then, 
in the colonies were men like Washington, Jefferson, 
Franklin and Madison, who regarded religion as a force 
which should be outside the state. All these were 
forces which were working for the separation of the 

church and state. 

The War of Independence created a favorable

situation in which to legalize the principle of 
liberty. The Declaration of Independence, while 
announcing an all-important principle, did not in 
itself have any force as a legal enactment in pro¬ 
tecting the rights of the individual. It was the 
Ordinance of 1787 which was the first important 
enactment regarding religious freedom. It referred 
to the 'North West Territories' of the United States 
and stated that no person who behaved in an orderly 
and peaceable manner should be molested on account 
of his mode of worship or religious sentiments while 
residing in those territories. The Federal convention 
of 1787, drafting the Constitution, took a further 
step when in Article YI of the Constitution of the 
United States it provided that no religious test 
should ever be required as a qualification to any 
office of public trust under the new Union. However, 
there was still the feeling among the proponents of 
religious freedom that these measures were not satis¬ 
factory. They demanded a positive statement upon 
the religious liberties which the constitution 
guaranteed, thus assuring the separation of church 
and state. In 1791, Congress passed the First 
Amendment, which prohibited an established church and 
guaranteed freedom of worship. The states were still 
left free to determine their policies in matters of

religion* A few even maintained state churches. 

Not till the passage of the Fourteenth Amendment 
in 1868 was the final step taken to assure religious 
freedom to all within the jurisdiction of the states 
as well a^fche national government. The amendment 
declared that "no state shall make or enforce any 
laws which shall abridge the privileges or immunities 
of citizens of the United States; nor shall any state 
deprive any person of life, liberty or property, 
without due process of law; nor deny to any person 
within its jurisdiction the equal protection of laws." § 

# Fourteenth Amendment, as quoted by Y. T. Thayer in 
Religion in Public Education, p. 25. 

Absolute separation of church and state was now 
guaranteed by the constitution. 

What were the relations between religion and the 
schools during the period in which the principle of 
separation evolved? Let us examine this relation of 
the church and education from the inception of schools 
in the colonies, through their developmental period, 
and down to the present time. 

The American schools had their beginning in three 
main religious traditions: Catholic, Anglican and 
Puritan, all of which were later to be affected by the 
growing secular movement just outlined. A separate 
examination of each of these systems will be necessary

before the school system as a whole can be 
considered. 

The Catholic tradition in the United States had 
its roots in the Spanish colonies. In the first half 
of the seventeenth century, Franciscan missionaries 
established a network of schools in New Mexico, Florida 
and California. This system, however, did not survive 
in an uninterrupted continuity. The California branch 
lasted until 1834, when it was secularized by the 
Mexican Government. In the English colonies, where the 
Catholic Church was not an established institution as 
it was in the Spanish and French sectors, the early 
development of the Catholic schools was short lived. 

In Maryland, where Catholics established schools in 
1634, the Puritans took power in 1649. The Roman 
Catholic church was proscribed and its development of 
schools in that state was suspended. The French 
Catholic schools fared differently, enjoying an un- 
terrupted growth. The schools established in New 
Orleans by the Capuchins and the Ursuline Sisters in 
the 1720 f s later formed the nucleus of the present 
Catholic system. Following American independence, 
all restrictions on Roman Catholics were rescinded 
and Catholics began to build schools in all places 
where they were congregated. This system grew until it 
attracted attention in the first quarter of the

nineteentii century, when the question of state grants 
to Catholic schools had to be decided. These schools 
demanded the same measure of public support as the 
Protestant denominational schools received, agreeing 
to accept all regulations and State inspection* How¬ 
ever, their petition was refused, and Catholics were 
compelled to build up a separate independent system, 
which existed side by side with the public system. 
Since then, the Catholics of America, as in other 
English-speaking countries, have been segregated in 
their own institutions. After about 1850, the trend 
was for Roman Catholics to provide parochial schools 
for their children. Only in exceptional cases, with 
the permission of the bishop, were the parents allowed 
to send their children to public schools. In 1892, 
there was an attempt by Roman Catholic dignitaries to 
reach an agreement whereby Catholic parents would be 
allowed to send their children to public schools in 
the absence of parochial schools, but the attempt at 
compromise failed. "All Catholic schools had to form 
a separate and independent system, as public un¬ 
sectarian schools were incompatible with the ideas of 
Catholic education." #

In the southern colonies there developed the 
Anglican tradition in United States education. Its 
stronghold was Virginia, y;here two different systems 
of schools were founded under the auspices of the 
established church: one, on the English grammar- 
school model, for the upper class children; another, 
a type of charity school, for poor whites. There 
was no great concern over the education of the poor* 
They were neglected and there was general opposition 
to the establishment of schools for them. However, 
the revolution entirely changed the position and the 
influence of the church. The Church of England had 
to be reorganized separately from its English head, 
and the State took over the schools. 

In the states on the north-east seaboard, a 
different set of circumstances and conditions led to 
the development of the Puritan tradition. The Puritans 
considered education the responsibility and function, 
not of the state, but of the family and church. The 
chief motive in establishing schools was religious, 
and the school teachers obtained licenses to teach 
from the Bishop. § Among the Puritans, the most 

# Johnson and Yost in The Separ ation of C hurch and 

Stat e, p. 21, state: "In t&e selection of tie ac tilers, 
as much attention was given to their piety and 
religious standing as to their scholarship."

influential group was the Congregation Church of New 
England, and its school system served as a model for 
other communities. The church made definite proposals 
for education. It influenced the passing in 
Massachusetts in 1647 of the famous law requiring the 
establishment of an elementary school in every town 
containing fifty families, and a grammar school wherever 
there were one hundred families. Johnson and Yost 
comment: # ’’This law which really established a school

system is noteworthy in that it is distinctly civil in 
character.” It was an early step towards the secular¬ 
ization of the church controlled schools. # 


# A. Y. Thayer, in Religion in Public Education , 

pp. 30-33, discusses the development oFThe public 
school and mentions the following as some of the 
forces which contributed to the secularization of 
the church-sponsored schools: (1) The enrichment 
of the curriculum beyond its religious aspects to 
meet the needs of the colonists. (2) The establish¬ 
ment of the ’academies’ emphasized the need of 
giving a general education and training to America’s 
rising generation. (3) The realization that 
education was necessary for all men if the new re¬ 
public was to prosper and develop. ’’These broader 
concerns of the school both encouraged and pointed 
to the need for public support of education.” 

The Year Book of Education, 1938, pp. 884-892, 
adds other factors, sucIT’as the influence of the 
French Encyclopedists, and of such men and 
institutions as Jefferson and Franklin and the 
Philosophical Society, who were concerned with this 
problem.

We have seen that the schools of the United States 
had their origins in religious organizations and that 
in the case of the Anglican and Puritan traditions 
there was a gradual increase in state control of the 
schools. It was the American Revolution which further 
accentuated the trend tov/ard public support and control 
of education. The separation of church and state, was 
carried over into the field of education. Religion in 
the schools lost its exclusive sectarian character and, 
although it still formed an integral part of the 
curriculum, its position there was to be challenged. 

It was only natural that public support of education 
should lead to the suggestion that in a country where 
the church and state are separate, the latter should 
not further the interests of one sect over the interests 
of another. Gradually, the religious nature of the 
schools declined. States developed systems of 
education financed by public funds and under public 
control which could direct what was to be taught in 
the schools. Private schools were subsidized under 
the agreement that the state would determine the 
nature of the curriculum. In many states, attempts 
to establish sectarian education were prohibited. 

The sectarian element in American education was 
being checked and was losing the position it had 
maintained for so long.

The hind red years follov/ing the American Revolution 
saw a great change in the American school system. The 
academies begun by Franklin, the influence of the 
French Encyclopedists, the work of Horace Mann, the 
influx of the many different races, and the growth and 
prosperity of the new republic itself, were all in¬ 
fluences which were making the public school secular. 

By the time of the civil war, the public school system 
was established in all the states. 

The spread of the principle of non-sectarianism 
in what had once been sectarian schools paralleled 
that of public support and control. "By the time 
public schools, publicly supported, developed in great 
numbers, the principle of non-sectarian religious 
teaching in Protestant parochial schools was quite 
firmly established.” § Prior to the Civil War, various

sectarian schools, particularly Catholic, were still 
being supported by public funds. However, this practice 
was becoming more generally opposed. When in the 1870 f s 
the Catholics attempted to obtain the same support as 
the public schools enjoyed, they encountered the 
opposition of President Grant, who was championing the 
separation of church and state. In 1875, Grant proposed 
an amendment to the constitution which would forbid the

teaching of religious tenets in the schools and the 
granting of any school funds or taxes for the benefit, 
directly or indirectly, of any religious sect or 
denomination. The amendment was defeated in the 
Senate. This is sometimes regarded as the peak in the 
movement for secularization of the public schools. 
Following this, it became more common to exclude 
religion from the schools. Religious exercises were 
still carried on, and the obligatory Bible readings 
disappeared very slowly. By 1903, ten states required 
reading of the Bible. By 1913, this number was reduced 
to three. Thus, ea&y in the twentieth century, nearly 
all vestiges of religious education had disappeared 
from the public schools of America. 

During the twentieth century there have been four 
distinct reactions to the separation of church and 
state in the United States. Two of these have been 
characterized by attempts of the church to provide 
religious instruction for children outside of the 
public school, while the remaining two have been dis¬ 
tinguished by direct involvement of the schools through 
the use of released and dismissed time and the inclusion 
of religion in the curriculum. 

The growth of the principle of separation of 

church and state left sectarian religious groups 

with two alternatives. They could entrust the education 

of their children to state-supported, ’secular’, public

schools, or they would have to provide parochial schools 
which could teach sectarian religion but would receive 
no state support. The Protestants were largely in 
accord with the idea of public schools, and at the 
present time there are relatively few Protestant 
parochial schools in the United States. In 1933, the 
Anglican Church controlled about 190 parish schools, 
with about IE,000 pupils. In the same year, other 
Protestant denominations were supporting 1,E6E elementary 
and 198 secondary schools, with 74,114 and 18,057 pupils 
enrolled, respectively. The bulk of these schools were 
controlled by the Lutherans, # By 1947, the enrolment

of nearly forty per cent over that of 1937. # However,

it appears that this progress is to be short lived. At 

a meeting of the International Council of Religious 

Education in Columbus, Ohio, in February, 1939, American 

and Canadian Protestant denominations decided to reject 

parochial schools. Time says: 

"The council recommended: (1) that Protestant 
parochial schools be discouraged as ’a serious 
threat to public education and democracy’; 

(2) that the cultural and non-sectarian aspects

People of Catholic faith reacted more strongly 
against the secularization of the public schools. They 
felt that their children ought to get religious in¬ 
struction in the schools. To assure this, they turned 
to parochial schools. Since 1900, there has been an 
extremely rapid development of the Catholic parochial 
school system in the United States. .American. Catholics 
spend $182,250,000 a year to run their church schools. 
This is more than any Protestant denomination spends 
for all purposes. The total expenditure of the 
Methodist Church was only $165,000,000; the second 
highest in Protestantism, $132,000,000, was raised by 
the Southern Baptist. # In 1933, the Catholic parochial

pupils, and 2,074 secondary schools with 269,309 pupils. 
Instruction was provided by 6,807 lay teachers and 
67,486 teachers who belonged to religious orders.^ In

This rapid growth of the parochial system has been 
paralleled by increased demand for state support for 
parish schools. The parochial system T s adherents argue 
that they not only support their own schools but are 
also taxed to support public education. Since their 
schools save other taxpayers a vast amount of money, 
they feel that the state should give some support to 
their schools.# Though the argument of the parochial

school supporters is sound financially, other people 
feel that state support of these schools would con¬ 
stitute a violation of the principle of separation 
of church and state* Up to the present time, no 
parochial school has obtained outright state support. 
However, in Supreme Court, rulings have upheld the 
legality of parochial schools receiving public aid 
in such fields as transportation, textbooks and health 
services, in certain states. 

The early part of the twentieth century also saw 
the attempt of churches to assume the responsibility 
for providing religious education for children. This 
was the era of the great Sunday School movement. 

G. H. Betts has this to say of the period: jf "From

about the year 1905 and continuing well past the year 
1920, the star of religious education [Sunday School] 
was in the ascendant. ... education was to be made 
the effective instrument of religion. The church was 
to center its efforts on the young, creating for their 
enlightenment a true teaching church." Teachers 1 
institutes, college departments and directorates of 
church education were all established by the church 
in conjunction with this movement. However, late in 
the 1920’s, this movement waned and the gains of the

past two decades began to fade. "The retardation in 
Sunday School enrolment in the United States as far 
as Protestantism is concerned came to over thirty 
per cent between 1916 and 1926. The actual decrease 
during the next decade amounted to much more." # 

# C. H. Moehlman, The Church as Educator , p. 59. 

Though the principle of the separation of church 
and school had been established in the public schools 
of America in the nineteenth century, this did not 
mean that it was strictly observed. There were constant 
attempts to re-introduce sectarian religious education 
into the schools, and in the twentieth century there 
have been progressively stronger attempts to make the 
schools re-assume the task of sectarian religious 
instruction. The most successful of these attempts 
have been the allied movements known as the Released* 
and ’dismissed* time plans. Essentially, the ’dismissed 
time’ plan provides for the dismissal of children from 
school one or more times a week at the request of the 
parents, for the purpose of receiving religious in¬ 
struction. The public school by this plan assumes no 
responsibility after the pupils leave its grounds. 

This plan was introduced in 1913 by Wm. A. Wirt, at 
Gary, Indiana, and is referred to occasionally as the 
’Gary Plan’. As a rule, under this plan, there is no

missed early one day a week, "with no school check-up 
on whether they improve the shining hour in the local 
church, movie house or pool room". # The public school

is not concerned about what is taught in the religious 
classes. On the other hand, in the practice of 
’released time’ the public school has a more direct 
relation to the religious instruction. In this other 
attempt to re-introduce religious education into the 
public schools, religious instructors are permitted to 
enter the schools to give classes in religion on time 
released from the curriculum. With many modifications, 
these two plans, ’released’ and ’dismissed’ time, are 
the most common programs of religious instruction in 
the public schools of America. The growth of both 
plans has been rapid. From the beginnings at Gary 
in 1913, the practice spread till by 1925 it was in 
operation in twenty-four states and affected 40,000 
children. In 1935, 260,000 public school children 
in thirty states were receiving religious instruction, 
and by 1943 the number had risen to 750,000. By 
1947, 2,000,000 public school children in 2,200 
communities were enrolled in week-day religious

the program of weekday religious instruction has not

or dismiss pupils if attendance is to be enforced or

of released time programs in the United States have 
been ruled unconstitutional. 

However, the dismissed time program still re¬ 
mains. It has received favorable attention, and 
now, by express statutory provisions, court decisions, 
ruling of state attorney-generals, and opinions of 
state boards of education or chief state officers, 
approximately forty states authorize the dismissal 
of public school pupils for religious education 
classes.# In its ’pure’ form, it is not likely that

and State, p. 75. 

the ’dismissed time’ plan will be challenged. 

Another development in the field of religious 
education has been the attempt to organize religious 
instruction as part of the curriculum. Although the 
instruction is not given during school hours or in 
school buildings, an allowance of high school credits 
is given for attendance at these classes. The classes 
are provided for children of various sects under the 
auspices of the religious denominations concerned. 

This plan, though widely prevalent, has been opposed 
and has met with limited success. 

Thus, we have seen that in the United States in 
the nineteenth century, secular education was gradually

CHAPTER ¥ 

THE HISTORY OF RELIGION IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS 

OF CANADA 

When the settlers from the Old World began to 
form communities in the New, they set up schools 
in which to teach their children. In the Maritimes, 
and in Upper and Lower Canada, most of the schools 
were of a religious nature, not only supported and 
controlled by the various denominations, but also 
primarily religious in the emphasis they held. Study 
of the Scriptures and religious instruction formed 
a large part of the curricula. 

A brief history of the early schools of Ontario, 
such as is given in a pamphlet of the Interchurch 
Committee on Protestant-Roman Catholic relations* # 

§ Interchurch‘Committee on Protestant-Roman Catholic 
Relations. The Separate School in Ontario, p. 3. 

will serve to illustrate what took place in the eastern 
provinces with regard to the secularization of the 
schools.^ At the conquest in 1763 the only white

French Canadian farmers who had spread upward across 
the border from Detroit. While these people received 
religious teaching from the French missionaries, there 
were no schools in the usual sense of the word. The 
first schools of Upper Canada sprang up with the 
coming of the United Empire Loyalists, after 1783. 
Usually an earnest clergyman or a needy but educated 
gentlewoman, anxious to increase a meagre income 
as well as to improve the well-being of the community, 
gathered the children into some suitable building. 

The small fees of the pupils made up the teacher 1 s 
pay. Early in the nineteenth century, in villages and 
towns, the private schools were partly replaced by 
schools conducted by churches and civic communities. 

These were managed by trustees, but the pupils 1 fees 
were still the chief source of revenue. Soon, however, 
the provincial government recognized that such important 
institutions, especially since they were becoming wide¬ 
spread, could no longer be financed locally; nor should 
they continue uncontrolled. In 1816, 1820,. and 1824 
grants were distributed to the best qualified of these 
schools, but the provincial governments at first felt 
it too big a burden to take firm control. There were 
no inspectors appointed to visit the schools, regulations 
were few and unenforced, and each school was largely 
under the control of its local board as to the subjects

taught, textbooks used, and qualifications of teachers. 
The one book taught and stressed in all the early 
schools was the Bible. Indeed in many of the early 
schools the Bible, or more usually the New Testament, 
was the only book on the premises. 

However, as the communities grew and became more 
populous, the churches became overwhelmed with the 
task of educating the common man. K. MacLean Glazier# 

# K. M. Glazier, "Teaching Religion in the Public 
Schools of Canada", Religiou s Education , XXXVII, 
(November - December, 19427, pp. 349-355. 

gives a clear picture of this part of the school’s 
development, covering the question rather completely. 

As the church could not levy taxes, it could not carry 
such a heavy burden as that into which the support of 
the public schools had grown.; the task was obviously 
one for the state. At the same time, various 
denominations which had grown up in the community 
were unwilling to let any one denomination gain control 
of the school which their children attended. The state 
took over the burden of the support, as well as the 
control of the school program, and the churches lost 
the influence they once held. Because those same 
churches could not agree on what sort of religious 
teaching they would accept in the public schools, 
religious teaching for the largest part disappeared

frorn the curriculum of the public schools, driven 
out not by secular demands but by the interdenomina¬ 
tional bickerings of the churches themselves. 

There are factors in the Canadian scene which 
have made this country’s approach to the problem of 
religious education slightly different to that of 
the United States and G-reat Britain. These factors 
are dealt with very well by Glazier# and the authors 

# Ibid ., p. 349. 

are indebted to him for many of the ideas in the 
following summary of the Canadian scene. The first 
of the factors to be considered here is the size and 
distribution of the population. Because of the 
scattered nature of the people and the relative lack 
of large cities, it has been necessary to develop a 
program of religious instruction which could be 
carried on in small schools with a minimum amount of 
equipment. It has often been the small towns rather 
than the cities which have led the way in setting up 
systems of religious education. 

A second factor# which has played a large part 


# Ibid,, p. 350, 


in the development of religious education in the 
schools is the unique separate school system, provided

for in four of the nine provinces. If, after a 
public school has been established in a community, 
a minority group - either Homan Catholic or 
Protestant - wishes to establish a school of its 
own, it is permitted to do so. This T separate 
school 1 has the same course of study as the public 
school, is under government supervision, and is 
supported by public funds, (It is in this last 
point that such schools differ from the parochial 
schools of the United States, which are not state- 
supported.) It is taught by teachers of its own faith, 
attended by children of its own faith, and is under 
denominational control. This type of school is per¬ 
mitted in Quebec and Ontario by the British North 
/unerica Act of 1867. When Saskatchewan and Alberta 
entered the Confederation in 1905, the privilege of 
having separate schools was made permanent for them 
also. The other five provinces have no legal provision 
for such schools, but in practice do have them, 
especially in the larger cities where certain schools 
are attended by children and taught by teachers of a 
particular faith. Separate schools are permitted 
only to the Roman Catholic and Protestant faiths, and 
in this way should be considered privileges, and not 
an inalienable right.

follows: § 

# The Dominion situation is very clearly and 

concisely stated in the following report, to which 
the authors are indebted:

Weekday Religious Education, "Religious Education

introduction of religion into their schools. Their - 
laws permit religious exercises, and also permit or 
rather provide for the teaching of the principles of 
Christian morality. No statistics are available on 
the number of schools taking advantage of the per¬ 
mission for religious exercises. The law providing 
for the teaching of the principles of Christian 
morality might be broadly interpreted to mean per¬ 
mission to give religious instruction, but practically 
none is given. In Prince Edward Island, not only 
has the question of increasing the emphasis on 
religious education not been raised, but it has 
generally been avoided. New Brunswick has a pro¬ 
vision in its laws for the giving of religious 
instruction in the schools out of school hours, and

consisting of reading a passage of Scripture from 
either the King James 1 or the Douay Version, Up to 
the present time there has been no provision for 
formal religious education in the New Brunswick 
schools. However, the Minister of Education has ex¬ 
pressed his willingness to include it in the program 
if the various denominations can agree upon its con¬ 
tent. Committees of some of the various faiths are 
now dealing with the problem. # 

# Religious Education Council of Canada, Committee 
on Weekday Religious Education. O p. Cit . 

In Nova Scotia, eight or nine years ago, the 
major Protestant faiths formed an interdenominational 
committee to study the question of religious education 
in the schools and to make recommendations to the 
Department of Education. This committee drew up 
Scripture lessons for four age groups, comparable to 
Grades I - III, IV - VI, VII - IX, X - XII. These 
were published and recommended for the use of the 
schools. Later the same committee issued a set of 
Devotional Exercises for the schools, which was 
approved. The next aim of the committee is to dis¬ 
cover some plan of religious instruction for the 
regular school day, to be included in the curriculum 
as a subject as reading is included, and generally

Quebec has the most comprehensive system of 
religious instruction in the Dominion. Religion is 
an integral part of the curriculum of the public 
schools, not only permitted but required in both 
Catholic and Protestant schools. The Department of 
Education in Quebec is divided into two closely 
cooperating halves, one controlling the Protestant 
schools and the other the Catholic. In this manner, 
each faith has its share in the control of the schools 
in which it is interested, but control is not so 
divided as to be chaotic. Let us look at the Catholic 
system first. The regulations of the Catholic 
Committee of the Council of Public Instruction require 
that the organization of the schools be of such a 
nature that religious instruction shall hold first 
place in the curriculum and be taught daily. Also, 
religion should permeate the atmosphere of the school 
and be not only taught as a separate subject but be 
linked up with all the other subjects of the course. 
Teachers are instructed to follow the course of 
studies not as an end to be attained in itself, or 
as a mass of knowledge to be absorbed, but as a 
rational means to rightly direct the moral and Intel-

leotual life of tlie child to help him become a better 
Christian and a better citizen. The whole course is 
aimed at making the pupil better able to meet life - 
physically, intellectually and morally. § 

jf Ibid. 

In the Protestant schools of the province, 
religious instruction Is also required. In the 
elementary grades it is given for twenty minutes 
daily. The course is arranged on the basis of topics 
with appropriate readings from the Bible. Topics 
such as helpfulness, thankfulness and service are 
studied, with the Bible for background reading. In 
the high school grades, the Bible is an integral 
part of the course in English, with a thorough study 
of the life of Jesus, Peter, Paul, and the development 
of religious and ethical ideas. All the work in this 
subject is taken during school hours as a part of the 
regular curriculum and, in almost all the schools, 
instruction is given by the class teacher. #

years an increasing number of clergymen have been 
giving religious instruction in the schools before 
or after school hours in accordance with the regu¬ 
lations, However, in 1944, the Ontario public 
schools began teaching a new course in religious 
education as a regular part of the elementary school 
program, using two half-hour periods per week. The 
instruction and exercises, made up of prayers, Bible 
readings for memorization, choral reading and speaking, 
and instructional help, are such as to be acceptable 
to the great majority of Protestant churches and every 
effort has been made to avoid content which might be 
found objectionable to members of these churches. 
Reports to date indicate that the course has been 
generally satisfactory and worthwhile, although a 
great deal of criticism has been heard in strong 
opposition to it.# No official program has so far

These exercises are given at the option of the school 
trustees, and are held just before the closing hour 
in the afternoon or just after school opens in the 
morning. There is also provision for religious 
instruction in the province, which must be given 
between three-thirty and four o f clock in the after¬ 
noon, by any Christian clergyman whose charge 
includes a portion of the district. The content of 
the course taught is made the responsibility of the 
clergyman.# In the small town of Selkirk, just

of the Lord’s Prayer permitted once during the school 
day, and religious instruction allowed during the 
last half hour of the school day, such instruction 
being under the jurisdiction of the local board of 
trustees. However, little advantage of these 
provisions is taken and religious exercises and 
instruction are far from common in the province. 

One community, Lloydminster, has implemented a pro-

has been in operation now for nearly fourteen years. 
Two half-hour periods of instruction per week are 
given by the various clergymen. #

that each school shall be opened with the reading of

that the last half-hour of the school day may be used

Alberta will be dealt with more fully in a later 
chapter« 

In British Columbia there is no program of 
religious instruction in the schools, but since the 
beginning of the 1944 school year there has been 
daily reading of the Bible and the recitation of the 
Lord’s Prayer, There are also four special optional 
courses in Bible study for high school pupils which 
may be taken extramurally for credit towards high 
school graduation and university entrance.^

To sum up the various laws of the provinces, 
Quebec is the only province requiring religious 
instruction in all public schools, both Catholic 
and Protestant; Ontario permits clergymen to give 
religious instruction in the school building before 
or after school hours; Manitoba, Saskatchewan and 
Alberta permit such teaching the last half hour of 
the school day; British Columbia has recently made 
provision for elective extramural high school 
courses; and Nova Scotia, Prince Sdward Island and 
Ne?tf Brunswick require instruction in Christian 
morality. In each province the legislation contains 
a ’conscience clause’. This permits any child to be 
excused from religious teaching at the request of his

parents or guardian. Besides these provisions 
for religious instruction, all of the provinces 
either permit or require some kind of religious 
exercises, either Bible reading or the recitation 
of the Lord’s Prayer, or both. This, at the 
present time, is the situation in Canada with 
regard to religious education in the public 


schools

CHAPTER VI 

RELIGIOUS EDUCATION IN ALBERTA TODAY 

In this chapter, it is our intention to set forth 
as fully and clearly as possible the situation regarding 
religious education in the province of Alberta at the 
present time: to show the legal basis of the prob¬ 
lem, to ascertain what has been done so far in various 
districts, to examine the pressure groups that are 
working for and against religious instruction, to out¬ 
line the arguments put forward by these groups, and to 
present the attitude of the general public as far as 
we have been able to determine it. 

In brief review of the preceding chapter, the 
following is the situation in Alberta from the stand¬ 
point of the laws of the province: 

(1) The province was given the right to maintain 
separate schools by the Dominion Government in 
1905, 

(2) In 1942, the opening of the school day by the 
reading of a passage of Scripture and the 
recitation of the Lord f s Prayer was made 
obligatory, provided that the Board may dis¬ 
pense with either or both by resolution* 

(3) Also in 1942, the last half-hour of the school 
day was set aside for the giving of such 
religious instruction as might be desired or

approved by the board. In 1947, this section 
was amended to the effect that in a high school 
which employed more than one teacher and which 
provided departmentalized instruction, religious 
instruction might be given in any half-hour of 
the school day, subject to the approval of the 
board and the Inspector. 

(4) Finally, any child whose parents do not desire 
him to have religious instruction may be 
excused for the time of such instruction. 

Investigating what advantage had been taken of the 
legal provisions for religious instruction throughout 
the province, we found the following situation: 

Vermilion has what is probably the oldest estab¬ 
lished program, in which Roman Catholics, Missionary 
Alliance, Salvation Army, United Church and Church of 
England co-operate to give one half-hour per week of 
religious instruction to Grades III to VI inclusive, in 
the Vermilion School. Each of the instructors plans 
his program separately. In the towns of Red Deer, 
Banff, Grande Prairie and Altario, some form of 
religious instruction is being given, beyond Bible 
readings and the recitation of the Lord’s Prayer. In 
Barrhead and in more than thirty of the surrounding 

local schools, the Bible Instruction Society has the 
approval of the local boards to give non-denominational

instruction in religion. In St. Paul, Beiseker, 
Standard, Blackie, Schuler, DeBolt and Lac Ste. Anne, 
religious instruction is given in the schools. In 
Calgary, the School Board agreed in February 1948 
that beginning in September of the same year one half- 
hour per week should be used in all classes of Grades 
I to VI for instruction in the Bible. In a letter to 
the authors, the Rev. Dr. Scott makes the following 
observation: "What has been done in Alberta as far 
as Protestant instruction is concerned has been ex¬ 
perimental, both in cities and the rural areas. Some 
areas have been carrying on for quite a number of years 
without a break, and other have not continued beyond a 
brief period. From our little experimentshere and 
there we are trying to learn." # This is a brief

of Provincial Interchurch Committee, in a letter to 
the authors now on file. 

indication of the advantage that various groups have 
taken of the legislation of the Province providing 
for religious education in the schools. 

What are the pressure groups in the Province that 
are working to establish religious instruction in the 
curriculum of the schools? As was mentioned in the 

introductory chapter, the Alberta School Trustees’ 
Association passed a resolution at its 1948 convention

to give religious instruction, and a second resolution

to arrange a syllabus for simple Bible teaching in the 
schools. § The first of these resolutions was

proposed by the Executive and the second by the Red Deer 

local; both were passed by the delegates. However, the 

divisional trustees are far from unanimous agreement 

on the matter. In answer to a form-letter question: 

7 Do you favor some form of religious education in the 

schools? 1 * * * * * , the following replies were among those 

received from divisional boards: 

7 ... not in favor of any change in present regu¬ 
lations o 7 

f ... leads to confusion and, often, bitterness. 7

unworkable and impractical. 1

7 The Board does not favor religious education in 
the schools. 7

’... best taught by the churches. 1 

The letters from which the above quotations have 

been taken are on file. 

Unanimous or not, however, the Association in question 
by its action must be considered as a point of pressure 
for the institution of religious education in the 
public schools of the province. 

The churches have also provided some agitation 
for the inclusion of religion in the school system; 
theirs has been no organized pressure, but, rather, 
occasional and individual movements to arouse interest 
in small areas. Most of the churches have been either 
content to make use of the present regulations to give 
instruction in the local schools, or to do nothing, 
usually after some unsuccessful attempt to reach a 
local inter-church agreement or after encountering too 
great disapproval from different sources in a district. 
However, in 1940, there was set up what is known as a 
Provincial Inter-church Committee with the Rev. Dr. 
Stanley Scott as the chairman. Representative of the 
Anglican, Baptist, United and Presbyterian Churches, 
the committee surveyed the situation in relation to the 
activities of the various denominations, but little has 
emerged from this investigation in the way of suggestions 
or reouests which would alter the situation, other 
than the approval of a text to be used in giving

instruction to classes in religion. Cn the whole, 
the churches seem to be more interested in using the 
present privileges of the province to the greatest 
advantage than in agitating in a body for new con¬ 
cessions. The Rev. Dr. Scott, in a letter to the 
authors, estimates that there are over 16,000 child¬ 
ren in Alberta who are receiving one half-hour of 
religious instruction per week at the present time. 

The total school enrolment at present is approximately 
175,000. 

In 1942, the Alberta Federation of Home and School 
Associations was described as "working to get required 
religious instruction in the schools and courses in the 
teaching of religion in the normal schools. " # In a

Schools of Canada; Some Recent Developments."

letter from the headquarters of the Federation to the 
authors, no indication of any concerted drive was given, 
but the opinion of the Federation was that the teaching 
of religion is of utmost importance and that it should 
be begun in the home and carried on in the community 
school and church. There does not seem to be any large- 
scale activity on the part of this Federation concerning 
the problem, but it can perhaps be classed as a source 
of some pressureo

Tho work done by individuals in furthering 
programs of religious instruction, as shown earlier 
in this chapter, is also a source of pressure, more 
local in its influence than provincial. These 
scattered points of interest, however, do add to the 
whole provincial picture and when taken in total are 
not insignificanto 

Opposed to the foregoing organizations and 
individuals, and creating a drive against the 
institution of religious instruction in the schools 
as part of the regular curriculum, are other organi¬ 
zations and individuals. The Alberta Teachers 1 
Association is one of these, as evidenced by the 
resolution passed by the delegates of the Annual 
G-eneral Meeting in 1948. § Again, as in the case of 

# Ofo Ante, p. 2. 

the Trustees, there was no unanimity of opinion in 
answer to a questionnaire sent to the local branches 
of the Association by the authors. This seems to be 
the situation in all eases, e.g«, no group can whole¬ 
heartedly agree one way or another on the problem. 
Individuals approached by means of questionnaires, 
interviews and letters also gave a wide variety of 
answers ranging from definite f noes* to ’undecided* 
to definite ’yea’s 1 . Although the majority in various

organizations may deoide the question pro or con, to 
say that any group is in wholehearted agreement one 
way or another would not be true. 

With the sources of the existent pressure in the 
province clearly in mind, some of the aims and objec¬ 
tives which the advocates of religious education hope 
to gain may prove interesting. In the answers of 
persons who are active in giving religious education 
in the schools today the following definitions of 
aims are given: 

f We hope that ... the child may have a Faith which 
he can practice, not only as a child, but also as 
an adult citizen - ... love of God and neighbor, 
honesty, purity, temperance, respect for authority, 
and appreciation of the wonders of God-created 
nature .... On the realization of this hope 
amongst school children in general one would expect 
to see: a reduction in crime rate, divorce and 
juvenile delinquency; more good-will and co-operation 
amongst men and nations. T 

*... give an understanding of Christianity, its 
teaching and history . 1 

1 ... give the individual something to ?t tie to ! V in 
time of difficulty . 1 

1 .. . religious instruction in the schools is most 
important, especially in these times when atheism 
and communism are so active. f 

T ... education in the teachings of the Bible. 1 

’... bring religion into the atmosphere of the 
school and the world ... . 1 

1 .. . children must be taught a definite faith . 1 

’Teachers ... tell us there is a marked difference 
for good (morally) in those who receive religious 
instruction ... . Many children have come to a 
personal trust in Christ as their Saviour ... . f

f ...children will understand that the Bible is 
a record of facts rather than a story book. f 

*... result should be a Respect for God’s Word.’ 

Again, in the objectives hoped for by the champions 

of religious education there is no more unanimity of 

opinion than there was in the groups whose majority 

wanted the instruction put in the schools. The above 

quotations are from letters of individuals who are at 

present giving religious instruction in schools. 

As shown by the following ezcerpts, there is just 
as wide a variety of opinion in the minds of the 
school trustees concerning the benefits accruing from 
religious education. 

f ... improve moral and social living; acquaint the 
children with the Bible and its teachers and 
principles. f 

f ... such things as divorce, ... cheating, ... 
and animosity ..., are bound to decrease.’ 

’... divorce, juvenile delinquency, lack of church 
attendance show the need for religious education.’ 

’... basis later for decisions as to conduct, etc.’ 

’Christianity is the cure for all social ills ... .’ 

’... give children a broader view of religion and 
qualify them to think for themselves.’ 

’... provide the pupil with an idea of right and 
wrong as applied to everyday conduct, without which 
many young lives are going on the rocls. ’ 

’... the practice of Christian Charity towards all 
men. ’ 

’... children learn Bible stories, characters, 
history, (and) ... feel free to discuss stories 
without a feeling of shyness. 9

The reasons in favor of religious education as 

given by some teachers who advocate it are given here. 

T ... students should recognize virtues and vices. 
Make them honest, charitable ..., morally upright 

... » 


’Can we have ethics or morals without a religious 
concept? There is a common Spiritual heritage to 
be passed on ... . ’ 

t An understanding of our way of life today demands 
a knowledge of Christian principles and beliefs . 1 

’... higher standards of conduct and happier lives 
... achieved in the adult world . 1 

f ... our greatest weapon against enemy propaganda 
in our social setup. T

present an ideal of conduct, or morals ... . ’ 

f ... usefulness in bringing a fuller life to the 
children ... . 1 

f Some children ... never have the opportunity of 
getting religious instruction . 1 

These, then, are the reasons presented by some of the 

proponents of religious education. 

In this chapter, the problem has been presented 
from the standpoint of the laws concerning it, of the 
advantage taken at the present time of provision for 
religious education, of the different groups in the 
province who are working for religious education today, 
and, of the aims and objectives which these groups hope 
to achieve by some religious instruction program. In

the next chapter, some of these aims will be examined 
in an attempt to determine to what degree they are 


valid

CHAPTER VII 

IS RSLiaiOUS EDU C ATION TH EO RETICALLY SOUND ? 

An intelligent man bases bis actions on some 
critical consideration of the past and present 
experiences and actions of mankind, and an assess¬ 
ment of their results. On this basis of information 
(which may be experiential or philosophical, and 
which has been examined critically), he is guided 
* ahead. 

A study concerning the desirability of religious 
instruction in the schools of Alberta can only 
assume validity if the conclusions reached are the 
result of an examination of the soundness of the 
philosophical implications, and an estimate of the 
practical successes of similar experiments in other 
areas of the world. Such considerations we feel should 
be made before any attempt is made to introduce any 
form of religious instruction into the schools. 

The fact that certain groups and individuals advocate 
such instruction does not in itself make the 
instruction desirable. Since, in Alberta, experience 
concerning religious education is somewhat limited, 
we must examine the problem on a broader basis and 
attempt to apply the conclusions at which we arrive 
to the local situation.

In previous chapters we traced the history of 
religious education in Great Britain, the United States 
and Canada, and examined it in the Alberta setting. 

In each case we saw that there were forces today 
which are working to introduce, or to increase the 
amount of, religious education in the schools. We 
now propose to consider these forces more specifi¬ 
cally. We shall examine their nature and look for 
possible reasons for their growth. Are the claims 
for religious education, as put forth by its pro¬ 
ponents, sound in theory? Are the systems of religious 
education which are in existence sound and justi¬ 
fiable in practice? These two questions will form 
the basis of the examination of religious education 
in the next two chapters. If the philosophy under¬ 
lying the claims of groups which are advocating 
religious instruction is sound, then such instruction 
should be generally introduced into the schools for 
the benefits which would result. However, if such 
claims will not bear examination, then the programs 
for religious instruction advocated have no place in 
our educational system. Similarly, if the systems of 
religious education in existence show results which 
would justify their use, we should consider their 
introduction into the classrooms. But, if such plans 
will not stand the test of practical application,

or, if it should become apparent that the good 
they do does not exceed the dangers inherent in the 
systems, we shall have to conclude that the forms 
of religious education considered cannot be admitted 
to the school. 

In this chapter, we shall briefly consider the 
forces advocating religious education. We shall 
discuss some of the theories which would explain the 
present emphasis on religious education. We shall 
present the aims and objectives of religious education 
as it is generally advocated at the present time. 
Finally, we shall attempt to ascertain the validity of 
these aims and objectives by examining the philo¬ 
sophical bases upon which they rest. In all cases 
our arguments will concern the types of religious 
education advocated at present; that is, types which 
are sectarian in nature. Our conception of public 
schools will be those schools which are publicly 
owned and operated. 

In our investigation of the history of religious 
education in Great Britain, the United States and 
Canada, we saw the sectarian influence disappearing 
from the public school to a greater or lesser degree, 
and secularism taking its place. We also saw during 
the past twenty or thirty years increasingly stronger 
attempts by various groups and individuals to bring

about a return or religious instruction to the 
schools. Since movements are generally a reaction 
to specific situations, we must logically assume 
that there is some underlying cause for the present 
pressures. What are these motives which underlie 
the present day demand for religious education? 

Let us examine the problem in the light of state¬ 
ments made by distinguished historians, sociologists, 
philosophers, religious leaders and educators. 

These range from simple statements regarding 
present day conditions to involved studies of the 
history of man. R. Niebuhr, writing in the 
E ncyclopedia of Social Sciences , says: 

"The development of sectarian education as 
competitive with public education is due to the 
same factors which brought forth the latter; the 
rise of the democratic movement and of nationalism, 
with the correlate secularization of life, partly 
as a result of the industrial revolution. While 
these movements produced systems of public 
education, they left denominational and other 
minority interests unsatisfied, and the eli¬ 
mination of all religious instruction from 
state schools - partly as a result of denom¬ 
inational conflict - outraged the convictions 
of those groups for whom the religious interest 
was the primary value of life." ft 


ft Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences , Yol. 5, p. 423. 

Sorokin, on the other hand, goes much deeper 
for an explanation. According to him, we are living 
at one of the epoch-making turning points of history,

”when one fundamental form of culture and society - 
sensate - is declining and a different form is 
emerging.” # This crisis, like the crises which have 

# P. A. Sorokin, The Crisis of Our Age , p. 22. 

preceded it, fT is marked by an extraordinary explosion 
of wars, revolutions, anarchy and bloodshed; by social, 
moral, economic, political and intellectual chaos.” § 

# Ibid ., p. 22. 


Sorokin asserts that such a change seems to be 
necessary to any culture or society which is to remain 
creative throughout its historical existence. The 
world crisis which marks the ’turning point* of a 
culture arouses people to make adjustments. However, 
these are originally petty attempts at minor change 
which may be effected in the economic system, in 
government, and even in the church. 

"Other doctors see salvation for the world 
crisis in a mild religious therapy: making 
the church more comfortable, the services 
more attractive, and the sermons more enter¬ 
taining. Still others believe in the magic 
power of education and expect marvels from 
changing here and there the curricula of the 
schools ... .” # 


# Ibid ., p. 309. 


However, such minor adjustments are insufficient

for the situation. Toynbee, although he does not 
specifically concern himself with our contemporary 
problem of religious education, does stress the 
existence of a crisis now. He sees our western 
civilization as having already passed through one 
and one-half beats of his * rout-rally-rout f rhythm. 
He concludes: 

”... fife are already far advanced in our time of 
troubles, and if we ask what has been our most 
conspicuous and specific trouble in the recent 
past, the answer clearly is: nationalistic 
internecine warfare, reinforced as has been 
pointed out in an earlier part of this study, 
by the combined drive of energies generated by 
the recently released forces of Democracy and 
Industrialism.” § 


# A. J. Toynbee, A Study of History , Abridgement by 
D. C. Somervell, p. 552-3. 


Thus Toynbee, while differing from Sorokin in thesis, 
concurs regarding the existence of a world crisis at 
the present timeo 

Lucock, writing in 1934, also saw a crisis, § 


# H. E. Lucock, ”Religious Education Tomorrow”, 

Chr istian Century , Vol. 51, (January 17, 1934), p.

”... a revolution, an economic and social 
collapse, unprecedented in immensity and 
severity, creating conditions that are proving 
far beyond the power of routine and traditional 
ways of thinking and acting to meet.”

reprimanded the church for not adjusting its teaching 
to the social conditions of the time. Because its 
teaching had been neglected, the church had ceased to 
be a dynamic institution to many of its former ad¬ 
herents. Now it was attempting to use similar tech¬ 
niques in religious education. Lucock expressed his 
own feelings as he said: 

"The major facts of our world today are 
social facts; the major emphasis of our 
religious education has been on individual 
conduct. The prevailing picture of the moral 
struggle in the world has been unreal in that 
it has been not plumbed deep enough to uncover 
the real immoralities in the structure of 
society which result in the enrichment of the 
few and the exploitation of the millions, or 
the fundamental paganism of the profit motive 
as the chief and all sufficient incentive of 
human action ... . The result has been that 
people have been trained to become perfectly 
adjusted to an environment which no one with 
the spirit and outlook of Jesus has any business 
being adjusted to.” # 


# » P« 85. 


Moehlman, writing ten years later, presents what 

might perhaps be regarded as an extreme reaction to 

the warning of Lucock: 

"Christianity is a minority in our 
population. The religion of the American 
majority is democracy." #

Way , preface, p.TvT

and Sorokin saw it in the perspective of total civil¬ 
izations. Sidney Hook sees it in a narrower sphere, 
more intimately related to our problem of religious 
education in the schools. He states that the situation 
out of which the desire to introduce religious 
instruction grows is the absence of a unifying 
faith and an authoritative set of values. 

"What is called the Spiritual crisis of our 
time 1 , the quest for certain integrating values 
to guide us amidst the unprecedented problems 
of our time, testifies to the fact that there 
is no commonly agreed philosophy of life in 
the community." §

discussing the church and school program. He sees this 
problem taking on new forms both in theories of 
education and in steps toward new procedures in the 
schools. The main reason for this view (as far as 
mental drives are concerned), seems to be a fear for 
civilization that has been inspired by contemporary 
trends.

our disintegrating economic order produces

terror and a calling upon Ood. The per¬ 
sistence of war and tiie increasing horror of 
it, make the centuries-old preaching of 
peace seem weak. The failure of nationalism 
to master some of the elementary functions 
of government adds to the sense of in-, 
security. The race is voyaging through 
tempestuous seas, where - so it is thought - 
nothing is dependable except an upward look 
away from earth. ...All these anxieties 
contribute to a growing opinion that 
religious doctrines, attitudes and habits 
should be wrought into our civilization by 
including specifically religious teaching 
within the universal education of the 
young.” # 


§ I bid ., p. 129. 


Finally, let us consider the argument of V. T. 
Thayer, who specifically sets out to show the con¬ 
ditions which have been responsible for the com¬ 
paratively recent growth of pressure for religious 
education in the public schools.# He sees in American

society the growth of a questioning, doubtful and 
uncertain attitude through the past three decades. 

He writes: 


"Scarcely was the Armistice signed before 
the * softening-up process® of fear and doubt 
and intolerance began to operate in the 
country... . Then ... came the depression of 
the Thirties. The suffering engendered by 
unemployment and the resulting cut-throat 
competition of man against man for the 
privilege of earning one’s daily bread 
tended further to undermine men’s confidence

as well as men f s generous attitudes to¬ 
wards differences in race, color and creed.” # 


# Ibid., p. 44. 


Paralleling the depression was the steady retreat 


of democracy in Europe. There followed a loss of 


confidence in political and economic institutions, 
and a rapid change in religious outlook in America. 


”... These trying years, particularly the 
depression years, brought to large numbers of 
people, the intelligentsia as well as the run- 
of-the-mine individual, the conviction that our 
civilization is in a process of disintegration.” 



# Ibid., p. 49. 


If conditions were such, says Thayer, as to 
bewilder and disillusion youth, then education between 
1918 and the depression of the 1930’s did nothing 
to direct them, but rather ignored its task of helping 
young people. By the Thirties, when education, shocked 
by the depression and awakening to new practices, 
was showing promising trends, the economic conditions 
of the times prevented their implementation. The 
doubts and the fears of the people grew. 

”Economie uncertainty, racial and religious 
antagonism, resulting often in violence and the 
intimidation of minorities, confusion and 
frustration in the minds of youth, who began 
to feel themselves a group apart, a lost 
generation - all these began to generate a

fear that old foundations were washing away." § 


# Ibid., p. 73. 


Doubt and fear have caused man to react more or 
less characteristically through the ages. 

"It is a psychological fact that fear 
prompts people to revert to early patterns 
of behavior ... to react as [they were] 
wont to do in childhood. ...It is not 
surprising, therefore, to ... find many 
serious-minded people turning to religion 
as an anchor to windward ... [and] ... 
willing to have their children taught 
[religion in the schools] tf . # 


# Ibid ., p. 74. 


All of these expressions imply that man faces a crisis 
and that in a crisis man turns to religion. 

The point we wish to make here is not that 
every person sees a crisis of the scope suggested 
by Toynbee or Sorokin. The crisis may be merely an 
individual one. Nor do we wish to infer from our 
survey that as a result of a crisis all people will 
turn to religion. Rather, we wish to state that of 
people who are aware of a crisis, some will turn to 
conventional religion.put forward this statement 
because we believe that to a large extent it underlies 
the problem of religious education in the schools. 

Let us examine the problem further.

religious education in the schools? Let us look at 
the facts. We have seen that about one hundred years 
ago secularism began to supersede sectarianism in 
the public schools of Britain, the United States and 
Canada. The past century has also seen a broadening 
and an increase in the diversity of thought and 
opinion. The growth of the principle of a free, 
general education, the spread of the concept of 
democracy and the rise of other ideas of government, 
the harvest of science, the linking influence of 
transportation and communication, have all resulted 
in a more critical, more self-expressive, if less 
uniform, attitude on the part of the people. To 
many people these conditions are symptomatic of 
a disintegrating society. As Coe says: 

”The obsolescence of some old standards 
of conduct is interpreted by some as a 
general breakdown of moral life through 
lack of conviction and the authority of 
religion.” # 


# G. A. Coe, "Shall the State Teach Religion?”, 

Scho o l and Society , Vol. 51, Feb.(1940), p. 130. 

To such persons religion seems to be a cohesive 
force which should be applied to the world. Consequent¬ 
ly they advocate the introduction of religious education 
into the public schools as an antidote to what appear 
to them to be undesirable qualities in the youth of

today. 

In the same way, a feeling of crisis will pre¬ 
cipitate a demand for religious instruction. When 
a state of unsettlement prevails, when the world is 
f going to pot f , it is to the welfare of our children 
that we look. If some section of mankind feels that 
a ’return to religion’ is the answer to its problems, 
it will not omit the children from that influence. 
People will feel that in order to protect or pre¬ 
serve society and its institutions they must get at 
their children. There is no better place to reach 
those children than in the schools. Consequently 
they advocate religious education. 

Let us now turn to the arguments which are 
put forth by those who advocate this religious 
instruction in the public schools as a way out of 
the crisis, - an antidote to the evils they see 
in society and youth today. What do these people 
hope to achieve? What are their aims and objectives? 

Probably the most frequent and most persuasive 
argument in support of religious instruction in 
public schools is that it improves moral behaviour. 

It is argued that only religion can cause men to 
follow the path of morality. Furthermore, since 
moral character is essential for good government,

it is agreed that democracy as well as morality 
must be rooted in conventional religion. We cannot 
neglect giving to our children this basis for morality 
and democracy. To people of this conviction the 
schools are the best instrument for achieving this 
end. It is toward achieving such an end that state¬ 
ments such as the following are directed: 

"What is the situation in religious il¬ 
literacy in New York City? There are 1,200,000 
children receiving education in public, private 
and parochial schools. Only 700,000 of these 
children are receiving any organized spiritual 
nurture. The remaining 500,000 children are a 
menace to society, to themselves, to our country, 
and to our country f s future. Spiritual 
illiteracy must be abolished for the sake of 
the children and for the sake of the nation. 
Released time for religious education is the 
next best step we know in stamping out the 
spiritual illiteracy of our children." #

Tliese children, says Fehr, are living in a religious 
void and must be given religious instruction which 
will give them a stable philosophy of life* 

In Thayer we see another instance of the same 
argument• 


tft The fifty per cent of our children who 
are not now receiving any training in religion 
because of parental neglect or other reasons 
should not be denied this most important 
element in their complete social history. ..* 

Social welfare is jeopardized as much or even 
more if any child.. is dsnied his right to 

know and to make use of all that society has 
learned in the area of religion 1 . 

The arguments quoted are in support of a 
program of religious education on released time.” # 


# Op. Git. p. 78 


Religious illiteracy is thus regarded as a public 
menace which should be recognized by the state. Con¬ 
sequently, provision should be made in the public 
school for religious instruction of the children® 
Secular public education without religious instruction 
is not preparing our youth adequately for its place 
in society. 


"Education is intended to be much more 
than the process of acquiring a superficial 
gloss of culture, information or occupational 
attitude. Being more important even than the 
system of government, a system of education so 
oriented does not frown upon religious 
instruction but on the contrary makes it the 
cornerstone upon which to build a stable 
philosophy of life.

"Relegating religious categories into the 
background, it [education] has placed its 
imprimatur upon a secularized system of 
miscellaneous instruction which now passes for 
education. ,f § 


# Jo C. Fehr, Off. Git ., p. 453 


It would follow, then,that religious education must be 
introduced into the public schools. 

Among the arguments put forth for religious 
instruction is the claim that education alone is 
insufficient in preparing our youth for democracy. 

"It must be equally clear that education 
alone, at least in the sense of mere transmission 
of knowledge, is far from being sufficient to 
produce the complete citizen of a democracy. ... 
We are told that education should be for life, 
that education should be related to living. We 
are told that to live is to act, that education 
should therefore be related to action. But 
human action is necessarily moral action, and 
thus education for living, for life, should 
certainly include moral education. ... religion, 
at the very least, religious morality, is 
indispensable to the very notion of religious 
education." § 


# R. J. Gushing, "Religion in Liberal Arts Education", 
Vit al Speeches , Vol. 13, (Mar 15, 1947), p, 336. 


J. J. Reilly agrees with Archbishop Cushing 
that our morality and consequently democracy is rooted 
in religion. 

"Democracy, he holds, ’derives its reason 
for being, its life, its vitality, its spiritual 
force solely from religion, because the freedom 
and the rights that constitute democracy have 
their origin in God from whom they come as free

gifts to man* ... The democractic conception 
of the dignity of the human being, the worth 
of human personality, has its foundation in 
religion. Religion teaches that man is the 
handiwork of the Creator, that we are individually 
His children and made in His image and likeness.’” § 


# V. T. Thayer, Religi on in Public Education , p. 101, 
quoting Dr. I. I. ReiTley in radio address series 
entitled ”God and American Education.” 

The essence of these remarks is that morality and 
democracy - that is, the democratic principles implicit 
in the democratic way of life - can be taught effectively 
in the schools only when they are positively grounded 
in religion. From this it would follow that the 
secular public school which does not provide specific 
cally for religious education is not fulfilling its 
function. 

Another argument put forth for religious 
instruction in the schools is that such instruction is 
necessary ,f to meet the universal need and increasing 
demand for dynamic religion to act against widespread 
immorality and deterioration of ethical standards 
characteristic of the present”. # In other words,

Re ligious Education , Vol. 17, (Feb. 1922), PP* 11-15.

pinning of religion. Consequently, to develop sound 
ideas of morality it is necessary to introduce

religious education into the schools. This is the 
thesis of F. Lynch, writing on "Religion and the 
Schools". 


"These [morals and ethics] grow out of 
religion, but they are not religion, and 
personally I doubt if they are much use when 
they are dissociated from religion. ... 
Children can be transformed and nurtured only 
by religion ... and my opinion is that the 
more Christian it is, the surer and greater 
the transformation is." § 


# F. .Lynch, "Religion and the Schools", Christian 
Century, Vol. 43, (April 29, 1926), p. 546. 


Lynch quotes the Bishop of Durham and Lord Hugh 
Cecil to substantiate his view. 

"Effective morahfcyiis to my mind 
inconceivable apart from religious training. 

In none other is there salvation. 1 " 

(Bishop of Durham) 

"'That is not Christian religious 
education at all, merely to teach people to 
be honorable, to "play the game", to be clean 
living'in the broad sense of avoiding anything 
disgusting and hateful. ...Nothing that does 
not train people to be and feel themselves to 
be members of the body of Christ, is worth 
having.*" 

(Lord Hugh Cecil) 


# Ibid ., p. 546. 

If we are to accept these views as sound, then 
religious education, because it involves 
morality,should be introduced into the schools. 
The charge is often made that juvenile

delinquency results from the omission of religious 
influences in the lives of children and can be 
checked only by bringing religion back into the 
schools. Belief in such an idea prompted the 
following statement to be presented before a 
Congress of Religious Education in California in 
1926, as a reason for introducing religious instruc¬ 
tion into the schools: 

"The recent alarming increase in juvenile 
delinquency, the flaunting disrespect for law, 
the challenge of conventions of marriage, 

. society, even of morality itself, and the 
acuteness of international relations, plead 
for religious education. Wiser measures will 
furnish needed elements of truth, of motive, 
of social consciousness, of moral dynamics - 
of God Himself. The trend for ten years has 
brought us to a crisis imperilling our people 
and our civilization." § 


# I. L. Corley, "Week-day Religious Training Debated" 
Chr istia n Century , Vol. 43, (March 23, 1926), p.394 


A similar belief of the inadequacy of present day 
secular education because of the lack of religious 
education in the schools prompted Dr. A. L. Kinsolving 
of Boston to deliver the following sermon: 

" T If priests, ministers, and rabbis were 
given an hour in the public schools several 
times a week, to meet their own children and 
teach them the Scriptures and the way of life, 
it would cost the government nothing, do the 
ministers a lot of good, give many of them 
just what they crave, reduce juvenile 
delinquency, create a new church. ... It is 
secular education, divorced from religious 
impulse and moral objective that is found

want ing. .. • There never was a time when 
religion was given so little recognition 
in education. ... We must reinstate religion 
in the public schools. ,tf § 


# E. 1. Root, "Urges Clergy in Public Schools", 

Christian Century, Vol. 52, (July 3, 1935), p. 900 


The following statement, while it is taken 
from a pamphlet which aims at encouraging Sunday 
School attendance, also has application to our 
examination. 

"There are a number of outstanding facts 
which have come to light relative to the value 
of Bible teaching to children. The follov/ing 
are a few examples: 

"In a certain police court, 4000 boys 
were examined and it was discovered that only 
three were members of Sunday schools when the 
crime was committed. 

"In another court, of 8000 cases, less 
than three per cent had ever had any religious 
education in home, school or church. 

"Statistics show that Canadian Sunday 
School attendance is decreasing and it would 
appear that, with the decrease of Sunday School 
attendance, goes the increase of juvenile crime. 

"Our daily papers view with alarm the 
increase in juvenile delinquency. If our boys 
and girls are to be kept out of the police 
courts, they must be kept in Sunday School. 
Surely these statistics indicate the value of 
Sunday School work in the making of good 
citizens." § 


7 f G. Mitchell, Th e Future of Your Child , published by 
The Home Evangelical Book Shop, 418 Church Street,

While the above statement speaks of Sunday Schools, it 
has application to our problem in that it suggests 
that Bible teaching will prevent juvenile delinquency -

a claim which is also made for religious education 
in the schools. 

In the light of all the above statements that 
religious education in the public schools would 
prevent or reduce juvenile delinquency, one must 
conclude that unless this religious instruction is 
introduced into the schools, society will suffer. 

There is a further argument put forth by the 
proponents of religious education. It concerns 
itself with the young people generally, and is ex¬ 
pressed in the statement that "the training of the 
young, especially at the formative levels of high 
school and college, has on the whole been drained 
of a social dynamic and a directive which the 
mediaeval church provided." § There is a feeling 

§ H. L. Parsons, "Church, State and Schools", 

New Republ ic, Vol. 113, (Oct. 1, 1945), p. 440 


among some people that the youth of tcciay, unhampered 
by religious restraints, is deviating from the path 
of their fathers and that this deviation is considered 
unhealthy. 


"The real danger in present day morals is 
to be found in the changing mental attitudes so 
alarmingly evident among young people toward 
what they term archaic and outworn rules of life 
and conduct. ... Large segments of the human 
family have deliberately sought to free them¬ 
selves from the rigid restraints which religion 
fastened upon private morals.

f, The eventual recovery .. . can come only 
through the proper education and rearing ... 
of our children.^ ... they will not be able to 
cope with them, [great problems] unless they 
are in their formative years prepared through 
discipline, inconvenience, discomfort and 
menial tasks to recognize the ultimate truth 
that education ... deals with the spirits, 
not the fortunes of men.” § 


# 1. 0. Fehr, On. Git. p. 437-8. 


It would appear, then that if our youth is to be 
kept on f the gold standard 1 religious instruction 
must be introduced into the public schoolso 

Aside from these moral motives for which people 
advocate religious education, a more selfish one also 
seems to be discernible«. It seems to be implied in 
statements such as the following: 

"More and more people are constantly being 
alienated from religion. Many countries in 
which education was once religious in the sense 
that it aimed at a supernatural philosophy of 
life have one by one forsaken the faith. and 
their people have long lived in a religious 
void." # 


§ Ibid ., p. 435. 

These motives originate in the fear that 
unless the schools are used to present religious 
education, the churches will shortly lack public 
support and will dwindle in enrolment and power. 
Moehlman claims that the 286 religious bodies in 
the United States claim only forty-three per cent

of the population* He remarks: 

"In 1936, the five-to-seventeen age 
population in the United States was 
31,618,000. The total Sunday School 
enrolment was less than five million. 

About fifty-seven per cent of the Catholic 
five-to-seventeen-year-old children were 
not in parochial schools. In Protestant 
parochial schools the total enrolment 
was-only £75,643. Between 1926 and 
1936, Sunday School enrolment decreased 
forty per cent. In that year the United 
Sates Baptists had over 3,000,000 less 
Sunday School pupils than church members." § 


§ C. R. Moehlman, School and Church, th e American 
Way, p. 123. 


To men and women concerned with perpetuating and 
expanding their institutions of religion, this 
shift from the church is alarming. They see in 
the schools an instrument which will check this 
trend. By introducing religious education into 
the schools they can increase interest, and through 
interest, enrolments in the church. Thayer quotes 
Blair as an example of this attitude. 

"’Neither the Sunday school, the vacation 
church school, nor the young people’s 
societies, nor all these combined, reach as 
high a percentage of the total youth group 
in a great many communities as does the 
week-day school.’" #

TT According to Blair, the plan of releasing 
pupils from school during the school day, in 
order that they may attend church schools, 
results in an enrolment of ninety to ninety- 
nine per cent of the public school constituency 
in many localities. And this in turn, it is 
hoped, will eventually swell the rosters of 
the churches.” # 


# Ibid ., p. 88. 


In securing the opportunity to instruct a child 
in the school, a sect can attempt to interest the 
child in its church. As E. L. Shaver (quoted by 
Thayer) remarks: 

n ’Wherever a cooperative church school 
has been in operation, it has succeeded in 
reaching on the average one third of this 
neglected half of our children and youth, 
a remarkable evangelistic record. f ” § 


# Ibid ., pp. 89-90. 

Such, then, are the aims and objectives of the 
groups and individuals advocating religious education 
in the schools. These aims are concerned primarily 
with democracy, morality and juvenile delinquency. 
Less markedly, they concern themselves with the 
waywardness of youth and with church membership. 

The claim is made that it is necessary to introduce 
religious education into the schools in order to 
underwrite democracy and morality and to decrease

juvenile delinquency and crime. Let us examine 
these claims individually. 

The proponents of religious education claim that 
religion provides a basis for democracy. Therefore, 
they argue, we must include religious instruction in 
the schools so children may benefit from its influence. 
The religious education these people propose is sec¬ 
tarian religion, - in the majority of the cases, based 
on Christianity. Evidently, then, democracy depends 
not merely upon religion but upon one religion, the 
Christian, - Hebrew-Christian at most. 

Few will deny that the Hebrew prophets made a 
significant contribution to the evolution of demo¬ 
cracy. They asserted the rights of the humble against 
the powerful. They proclaimed the concept of the 
worth of the individual, and promoted the idea of 
the equality of man in the eyes of God. But,as 
Thayer says, this was only half the picture. 

"The Hebrew ideal of government was a 
theocracy, not a democracy, and even the 
concept of social democracy occasionally 
pictured in the Bible remained far more 
an ideal than a reality." # 


# Ibid ., pp. 106-7.

many opposing points of view. Although a basic tenet

of slavery only a century ago, and each one quoted 
from the Bible to support its position.# And only

three hundred years ago in the country which is 

probably the greatest democracy, kings ruled by ’divine 

right’ as ’God’s ministers’ by sanction of the Bible. 

In struggles between democracy and totalitarianism, 

men of both sides had equal faith that their cause 

was just in the light of the Bible and in the eyes 

of God. Yon Papen hailed the Concordat between 

Pope Pius XI and Hitler thus: 

"’The Third Reich is the first power in 
the world not only to recognize but to trans¬ 
late into practice the high principles of the 
Papacy.’ He also proclaimed that Nazism was 
’the Christian countermovement against the 
spirit of 1789... . We therefore stand at 
the beginning of a Christian revolution!’" # 

# Ibid ., Preface, p.v. 

Rather than having developed our governmental 
institutions out of our religions, it may be more 
probable that the development of our social 
institutions has paralleled that of our religions, 
each perhaps drawing from the other, so that the two 
have appeared to be associated. As Frederick Mayer 


says:

"Religions of the world, like Hinduism, 
Mohammedanism, and Christianity are so 
closely identified with the cultural 
environment in which they developed that 
their essential mission has become ob¬ 
scured, They have frequently become 
spokesmen for their civilizations. 

Thus, during the world wars the 
ministers of the warring nations prayed 
to a national God, and all attempted to 
show why Divine intervention would take 
place on their side. Religion in America 
is guided by the success motive, and we 
hear preachers say: ’Be religious and you 
will be successful. 1 Antiquated social 
institutions like the caste system are 
being upheld in part by theological 
theories.” § 


§ F. Mayer, "Education for World Religion", 

Religious Education, Vol. 43, (Mar.-April, 1948),

Democracy has always been a growing, living 
thingf It never has been and cannot be a static 
institution, but must be pliable to the wishes of 
the people. Our concept of government bas changed 
from ’privilege for a few’ in the reign of Xing 
John to ’democracy for the many’ at present. It 
has its roots in the past and although it has 
drawn from the Hebrew-Christian religion, it has 
in its process of evolution drawn from other 
sources along the way. As Thayer states: 

"The fact is that democracy, as we 
envisage it today, derives from plural sources: 
in part from Hebrew and Christian, in part 
from the Greeks; in large measure from the 
philosophy of the Stoics and from the Roman 
law which gave expression to Stoic principles;

from economic developments in Europe since 
the fifteenth century; from the fearless 
methods of thinking developed by modern 
science; and in no small degree for the 
relations of man to man which were peculiar 
to life on the frontier.” # 


§ V. T. Thayer, Religion in P ublic Education , p.106 


History does not seem to justify the view that 
the principles of democracy require the acceptance 
of a religious conception of life* 

Thayer quotes Sidney Hook to show that logic 
also fails to sustain the above contention. 

"As Hook points out: 1 From the alleged 
fact that all men are equal before God, it does 
not follow logically that they are, or should 
be, equal before the state or enjoy equal right 
in the community. Even in the theological 
scheme, although God is equally the creator of 
angels, men, animals and things, they are not 
equal in value before him T . And is it not a 
cardinal principle of democracy that a man is 
a man irrespective of origin and entitled to 
equal and open opportunity for the development 
of his potentialities.” # 


# Itid ., p. 107. 


Thayer quotes Hook again to show that men have used 
religion to justify both equality and inequality. 

"’Some Christians have held - with as 
much logic as their brethren who drew contrary 
conclusions — that because all men are equally 
sinners in the sight of the Lord, their social 
and political inequalities in this transitory 
life are unimportant.’” #

It seems that neither logic nor history can 
support the claim that religion - more specifically, 
one type of religion - underwrites democracy. 

Let us return to the claim regarding religious 
instruction in the public schools as a basis for 
democracy - that evidently democracy depends not 
only upon religion but (on the basis of the teaching 
proposed) upon one religion, Christianity. What 
does this mean? Literally, it means that we cannot 
expect a democratic union of the nations of the 
world until all people are converted to a religion 
in the Christian tradition; that inter-national 
morality and government cannot rest on a number of 
cultures. Yet each nation, each society, considers 
its own culture and religion equally good. Would it 
not be wise to take the attitude of Carl Seashore of 
the University of Iowa, writing on ”One World, One 
Religion”. 

fl A good religion is an attitude towards 
some supreme power other than self which 
results in a progressive realization of truth, 
goodness and beauty in life. This is a 
definition which holds for all the great 
religions of the world regardless of their 
creed, historical background, civilizations, 
theories or philosophies.” § 

# C. 1. Seashore, ”Cne World, One Religion”, School 
and Society , Vol. 64, (Sept. 7, 1946), pp. 161-2."

Fur the more, in its own society, each religion is 

regarded with reverence. As Ghandi said: 

"Every nation considers its own faith to 
be as good as any other." § 

$ 0. R. Moehlman, The Church as E d ucator , p. 54. 


Would it not be better to show that despite the 
particular development of each culture and religion 
man generally has been looking for the same answers 
and searching for the same goal. 

"... Frank points out that despite all 
1 difTerences in size, shape, color and some 
psychological functions, man as a species is 
essentially alike everywhere.* Everywhere, 
also, man encounters what Frank calls per¬ 
sistent tasks of life, problems associated 
with the gaining of food, clothing, shelter, 
security, with organizing group life and 
regulatirg human conduct by transforming com¬ 
pulsive behaviour into standards, codes and 
methods of living cherished by a group. In 
seeking to realize these ends he evolves 
assumptions about himself, about nature and 
the world. Out of these assumptions grow 
his religion, his philosophy, his art, and 
his social, economic and political insti¬ 
tutions. Now as we examine these varying 
philosophies, religions and practices, we 
discover certain valuable insights into 
man’s nature and his need, and we observe 
also that no one cultural expression is 
complete or adequate in itself. Each is 
limited, partial, and can with profit be 
supplemented by the insights of others." # 


§ Y. T. Thayer, Religion and Public Educa t ion , p.108, 
quoting L. P. Frank, "World Order and Cultural 
Diversity", Free World ,(June 1942). 


In a world which needs to find a common goal of

peace and unity towards which all nations can strive, 
it is important that the education of our youth should 
include an acquaintance with, as well as a respect for 
the cultures and religions of other places. We must 
respect the ideas of other people besides cherishing 
our own. We cannot afford to inculcate into the minds 
of our youth narrow conceptions of religion or of race 
On this basis also, we cannot justify sectarian 
religious education in the schools. 

If we consider religion in its broadest sense as 
a way of life, then democracy and religion may have 
common ground, How T ever, there, seems to be no justi¬ 
fiable reason for believing that public schools must 
include instruction in sectarian religious education 
in order to insure a loyalty to the principle of 
democracy. 

Let us now turn to the problem of religion and 
morals. 

The advocates of religious education argue that 
morality requires a religious basis and consequently 
contend that to insure morality in our youth we must 
introduce religious instruction into the schools. 

What does this imply? It would seem that morality 
and ethics require T outsidd support; that good conduct 
is foreign to human nature. It would seem to imply 
that morality is based and dependent on religion.

But is this true? Many people support such a point 
of view. 

Edward Caird, in his Evolution of Religion , 
writes: 


"Man’s relation to God is inevitably 
conceived as the ground of a social relation 
between himself and other beings like himself, 
which determines at once their practical 
obligations to him and his practical obli¬ 
gations to them . 

"In this sense, then, we may say that, 
as is a man’s religion, so is his morality. 

As he conceives of his relation to the power 
which determines his place in the world - 
and especially his place in relation to other 
men who with him are the members of one 
society - so also he conceives of the duty 
which he owes to them. Those who have denied 
that in early times religion had anything to 
do with morality, really meant that it does 
not produce what we call moral conduct. And 
to this it is sufficient to answer that their 
religion is not what we call religion. But 
it would be absurd to say that at any time 
man’s relation to the beings he conceived as 
divine has not had a determining influence on 
his view of his relations to his fellow-men, 
and of the conduct therefore incumbent on 
him. ...Perhaps we might even go farther 
and say that ... religion and morality are 
necessary correlates of each other, and that 
it is impossible to elevate one of them with¬ 
out also elevating the other." # 


§ E. Oaird, The Evolution of Religion , p. 236-7. 


W. R. Inge holds a similar point of view. He 


says: 


"Religion and Ethics are, for a Christian, 
inseparable. There are unethical religions, 
and there are irreligious ethical schools or 
societies; but these are not Christian. Ethical 
societies, in spite of their moral earnestness,

seern dry and ineffective; and an unethical 
religion may sometimes be worse than no religion 
at all. ... 

"The moving force in ethical religion is 
the natural attraction which goodness, truth, 
and beauty exercise upon a healthy mind led, 
as we believe, by the Holy Spirit. ...Man longs 
to transcend his empirical self and its 
surroundings; he stretches forward towards the 
eternal values, and he finds them in morality, 
in science, and in art. 

"It is through the divine life in men, the 
Christ in us, that Ethics belong to the eternal 
or spiritual world, and that moral conduct 
becomes as it were the sacrament, the outward 
and visible sign, of faith, hope, and love 
directed to a B e ing who in His nature sits above 
the conflict between right and wrong. What is 
relative and subjective in morality is thus 
anchored to absolute truth and goodness." # 


# W. R. Inge, Christian Ethics and M odem Problems , 
p . 3*79. 


E. H. Sneath in The Evolution of Ethics speaks 
of the emphasis moral values receive in the sphere 
of religion. This emphasis, he feels is particularly 
true in the Hebrew and Christian religions in which 
the moral values are supreme. These values "are thus 
recognized to be supreme because, as a matter of fact, 
they are so." # The highest values of true religions

are ethical, and all other forms of religious life 
have value only as they contribute to the realization 
of righteousness. - He quotes from Professor Browne’s

M, Whatever our theological faith, 
whatever our religious practices, and what¬ 
ever our religious pedogogics, their sole 
use and value consist in helping us to 
live lives of love and righteousness before 
God and man. 1 ” jf 


# Ibid ., p. 359-60. 


The conception of God as a God of Righteousness 
in the higher religions relates to motivation in the 
moral life. To believe in a God who rewards virtue 
and punishes vice, says Sneath, proves to be a power¬ 
ful dynamic in the moral life of the individual and 
of society, although it does not always result in 
the highest type of morality. The concept of a God 
of Righteousness also furnishes a powerful inspiration 
to the cause of righteousness. Furthermore, man is 
inspired and sustained through the belief in the 
immortality of virtue. Sneath summarizes his argu¬ 
ment : 


t? Xn conclusion, it may be said that the 
recognition of the supremacy of moral values, 
and a statement of what these values are,

E. W. Barnes discusses morals in terms of 
absolutes. He argues "that the two realms of nature 
and moral purpose belong to a single scheme, and 
that the God of Nature is also the Source of the 
moral values of which we are conscious." § In other 

# E. W. Barnes, Scientific Theory and Religion, 

p. 605. - ----— 


words he conceives of absolute morality as being an 
attribute of God. 

"Our ethical principles are not' merely our 
own. We may differ as to what is the right 
course of conduct in certain circumstances. But 
the difference will arise from a conflict between 
different ethical loyalties and not from dispute 
as to whether ultimate principles are good or 
evil. The moral law is universal, although it 
may be imperfectly apprehended by even the 
highest in moral attainment. Yet as we reflect 
upon experience, and criticise in intersubjective 
intercourse the results of our reflection, we 
get an ever fuller apprehension of the moral 
order. We thus discover that which is objectively 
valid." § 


# Ibid., p. 607. 


However, Barnes does not deny that moral 
consciousness has been formed by the necessities of 
the social order and that it is ultimately a product 
of man’s reaction to his environment. Morality is 
most certainly the result of a process of development. 
Moreover, the conduct and principles of men have 
changed with the growth of civilization. It is by the 















- 120 - 


growth of understanding, by reflection upon the world 
in which he finds himself, that man has been led from 
grossly imperfect moral judgments to a more adequate 
appreciation of the moral law. But we cannot deny 
the objectivity of such judgments. The historical 
process by which man has become aware of values can 
be described in rough outline; but we must not confuse 
this process with the construction of the values them¬ 
selves, says Barnes. 

"Man in his development has merely discovered 
morality. Thus he has not created ethical 
principles though he has increasingly taken them 
to be criteria by which conduct is regulated." # 

jf * Ibid., p. 603• 

The discovery of the moral law has been a slow 
process. It began when elementary moral judgments 
were applied by the family or tribal group to parti¬ 
cular actions and issues. Such judgments were the 
outcome of a critical examination of intuitive 
judgments of value made by individuals. These judg¬ 
ments may be erroneous. How are we to eliminate 
this possibility of error? Barnet * answer is that 
the critical examination at its moral experience 
will in the end enable humanity to discover moral 
law. Humanity constructs an increasingly perfect 
system of ethical principles by a process of critical 
analysis which continuously removes the contradictions

which arise from the different judgments of individuals. 
In the end we shall reach a system of moral principles 
which is objectively valid. 

,f We must think of the elements of morality 
... as uniting to form an organic whole, some 
unity which resembles an organism rather than 
aggregate. As we learn to appreciate such 
organic wholes our moral experience grows. 

With its growth we are enabled more and more 
completely to see ethical principles as a system. 

We thus reach the idea of the Absolute Good; and, 
though our comprehension is never perfect, our 
discovery of the objectively valid moral order 
becomes progressively the more complete.” # 


# Ibid ., p. 604. 


Reinhold Niebuhr also conceives of morality in 
terms of absolutes. He sees religion making a distinct 
contribution to morality, in its "comprehension of 
depth in life”. A secular moral act resolves the 
conflicts of interest and passion, revealed in any 
immediate situation by whatever means prudence may 
suggest, the most usual counsel being that of 
moderation. A religious morality by its sense of a 
’dimension of depth’ traces every force with which it 
deals to some ultimate origin, and relates every 
purpose ot its ultimate end. It is concerned not only 
with immediate values but with the problem of good 
and evil; not only with immediate objectives, but 
with ultiraat© hopes. Man is not capable of solving 
his moral problems by himself. He needs God’s help.

All life is. dynamic? religious faith, seeks for the 
solution of the problem of evij. by focussing its 
gaze upon the beginning and the end of this dynamic 
process, upon God the creator and the God the 
fulfilment of existence. 

"The dimension of depth in the consciousness 
of religion creates the tension between what is 
and what it ought to be. Xt bends the bow from 
w hich every arrow of moral action flies. Every 
truly moral act seeks to establish what ought to 
be, because the agent feels obligated to the ideal, 
though historically unrealized, as being the order 
of life in its more essential reality. Thus the 
Christian believes that the ideal of live is real 
in the weill and nature of God, even though he 
knows of no place in history where the ideal has 
been realized in its pure form. And it is be¬ 
cause it has this reaLity that he feels the pull 
of obligation. ...The ’pull* or ’drive’ of moral 
life is a part of the religious tension of life. 

Man seeks to realize in history what he conceives 
to be already the truest reality - that is, its 
final essence. 

"The ethical fruitfulness of various types 
of religion is determined by the quality of 
their tension between the historical and the 
transcendent. This quality is measured by two 
considerations: The degree to which the trans¬ 
cendent truly transcends every value and achieve¬ 
ment of history, so that no relative value of 
historical achievement may become the basis of 
moral complacency; and the degree to which the 
transcendent remains in organic contact with the 
historical, so that no degree of tension may rob 
the historical of its significance." § 


# R. Niebuhr, An Interpretation of Christian Ethics , 

p. 8-9. 


The significance of Hebrew-Christian religion 
lies in the fact that the tension between the ideal 
and the real which religion creates can be maintained

at any point in history (no matter what the moral 
and social achievement has been), because the ultimate 
ideal always transcends every historical fact and 
reality. 


”...There are two resources in human nature 
to which this religio-moral discipline must be 
related: The natural endowments of sympathy, 
paternal and filial affection, gregarious 
impulses and the sense of organic cohesion which 
all human beings possess, and the faculties of 
reason which tend to extend the range of these 
impulses beyond the limits set by nature.” # 


# Ibid ., p. 202-3. 


Reason can provide principles of criticism and norms 
but no rational moral idealism can create the dynamics 
for moral conduct. 

The dynamics of Chrstian religion are found in 
the Christian doctrine of perfect love and the Christian 
faith in Cod which supports it. Man is under obligation 
to emulate the love of Cod, to forgive as Cod forgives, 
to love his enemies as Cod loves them. 

"The Christian love commandment does not 
demand love of the fellow man because he is 
with us equally divine ..., or because we ought 
to have ’respect for personality 1 but 

because Cod loves him. The obligation is 
derived, in other words, not from the obvious 
unities and affinities of historic existence, 
but from the transcendent unity of essential 
reality.” #

”The Christian doctrine of love is thus the 
most adequate metaphysical and pscyhological 
framework for the approximation of the ideal of 
love in human life. It is able to appropriate 
all the resources of human nature which tend 
toward the harmony of life with life, without 
resting in the resources of ’natural man’. It 
is able to set moral goals transcending nature 
without being lost in other-worldliness. The 
degree of approximation depends upon the extent 
to which the Christian faith is not merely a 
theory, but a living and vital presupposition 
of life and conduct. The long history of 
Christianity is, in spite of its many failures, 
not wanting in constant and perennial proofs 
that love is the fruit of its spirit. Martyrs 
and saints, missionaries and prophets, apostles 
and teachers of the faith, have showed forth 
in their lives the pity and tenderness toward 
their fellow men which is the crown of the 
Christian life. Nor has Christianity failed to 
impart to the ordinary human relations of 
ordinary men the virtues of tenderness and 
consideration.” # 


# Ibid ., p. 814-15. 


However, the moral fruits of religion are not 
the consequence of a conscious effort to achieve them. 

w The love commandment is a demand upon the 
will, but the human will is not enabled to con¬ 
form to it because moralistic appeals are made 
to obey the commandment. Moralistic appeals are 
in fact indications of the dissipation of 
primary religious vitality. Men cannot, by 
taking thought, strengthen their will. If the 
will is the total organized personality of the 
moment, moving against recalcitrant impulse, 
the strength of the will depends upon the 
strength of the factors which enter into its 
organization. Consequently, the acts and 
attitudes of love in which the ordinary re¬ 
sources of nature are supplemented are partly 
the consequence of historic and traditional 
disciplines which have become a part of the 
socio-spiritual inheritance of the individual

and partly the result of concatenations of 
circumstance in which the pressure of events 
endows the individual with powers not 
ordinarily his own. " # 


# Ibid., p. 215. 


"The moral effectiveness of the religious 
life thus depends upon deeper resources than 
moral demands upon the will. Whenever the modern 
pulpit contends itself with the presentation of 
these demands, however urgent and fervent, it 
reveals its enslavement to the rationalistic, 
presuppositions of our era. The law of love 
is not obeyed simply by being known. Whenever it 
is obeyed at all, it is because life in its 
beauty and terror has been more fully revealed 
to man. The love that cannot be willed may 
nevertheless grow as a natural fruit upon a 
tree which has roots deep enough to be nurtured 
by springs of life beneath the surface and 
branches reaching up to heaven." # 


§ Ibid ., p. 220. 


These, then, are some of the views supporting 
the contention that religion is basic to morality. 
However, in opposition to the foregoing viewpoints, 
we find many rational and convincing arguments that 
morality has no basis in religion. 

Westermarck, in his Christianity and Morals , 
states: 

"While the origin of religion may be traced 
to the feeling of uncanniness and mystery, 
moral consciousness has an entirely different 
foundation." # 

# E. Westermarck, Christianity and Morals , p. 6.

Sidney Hook makes a more positive statement in the 
same vein. 


"The history of moral insight from Socrates 
to Dewey, from Democritus to Santayana, is 
sufficient to show that the meaning and validity 
of moral insight does not require any theological 
underpinnings. ...There is no evidence ... that 
beliefs in the existence of the supernatural is 
an essential condition for public order or 
private morality." § 


# S. Hook, "Moral Values and/or Religion in Our 
Schools”, Progressive Education, Vol. 23. (Mav 
1946), p. 257. “ 


In primitive societies with elementaiy religions 
which consist mainly of ritual, the members still 
adhere to the ethical code of their societies*. As 
Westermarck says: ”... savages follow their own 
rules of morality no less strictly, or perhaps more 
strictly, than civilized people follow theirs." § He 

if Oj). Git., p. 29. 

adds: 

"... It is common experience that contact with 
a higher civilization exercises a deteriorating 
moral influence upon the conduct of uncultured 
races, although we may be sure that Christian 
missionaries do not fail to impart the doctrine 
of Hell to their savage converts." § 

# Ibid ., p. 29. 

Religious devotion is not necessarily accompanied by 
a strict morality. People who profess religious

beliefs most fervently are not necessarily the most 
moral. Westermarck illustrates this point: 


"A Christian of the seventh century, 
who was canonized by the Church of Rome, 
described a good Christian as a man f who 
comes frequently to church, who presents 
the oblation which is offered to God 
upon the altar; who doth not taste fruits 
of his ora industry until he has con¬ 
secrated a part of them to God; who, when 
the holy festivals approach, lives 
chastely even with his wife during several 
days, that with a safe conscience he may 
draw near the altar of God; and who, 
in the last place, can repeat the creed 
and the Lord’s Prayer.’ A scrupulous 
observance of external ceremonies - 
that is all which in this description 
is required of a good Christian. Smollet 
observes in his Travels Into Italy that 
it is held more infamous to transgress 
the slightest ceremonial institution 
of the Church of Rome than to transgress 
any moral duty; that a murderer or 
adulterer will be easily absolved by 
the Church, and even maintain his 
character in society; but that a 
man who eats a pigeon on a Saturday 
is abhorred as a minister of reprobation. 
... And how many a Protestant does not 
imagine that by going to church on 
Sundays he may sin more freely on the 
six days between?” § 


# Ibid., p. 30. 


”When we study the moral rules laid 
down by the customs of savage peoples we 
find that they in a very large measure 
resemble the rules of civilized nations. 
In every savage community, homicide is 
prohibited by custom, and so is theft.

Savages also regard charity as a duty 
and praise generosity as a value, 
indeed their customs regarding to 
mutual aid are often more exacting 
than our own; and many of them are 
conspicuous for their avoidance of 
telling lies. But in spite of the 
great similarity of moral commandments, 
there is at the same time a difference 
between the regard for life, property, 
truth, and the general well-being of 
a neighbor which displays itself in 
savage rules of morality and that 
which is found among ourselves: it 
has,broadly speaking, only reference 
to members of the same community or 
tribe. Among peoples more advanced 
in civilization the social unit has 
grown larger, the nation has taken 
the place of the tribe, and the 
circle within which the infliction 
of injuries is prohibited has ex¬ 
tended accordingly.” # 


# Ibid :., p. 37. 


A basic point upon which a number of writers 
seem to agree is that morals have grown out of 
man’s relationship to man throughout the ages. 
Religions may contain the ethics of their con¬ 
temporary society, having absorbed these in a 
parallel growth but the moral code arises from 
man’s relationships in society - from the primitive 
one of a few people to a complex modern civil¬ 
ization.

. ^ "It can clearly be shown that morals 

and justice and right are basic terms that 
antedated every human system of religion* 

The Christian religion is no exception to 
this fact. Morals have to do with conditioning 
the battle of life. Social morality arose 
in the dim and distant past, when two men began 
to hunt and fish and seek for pleasure over 
the same restricted area of the earth’s 
surface. So its growth has continued to this 
day.” # 


§■ W. B. Smith, "Indictment and a Challenge”, 

Educ ational Heview, Vol. 69, (April 1925), pp. 172-3. 


The origin of morality is stated more specifically 
by 1. 0. Lindeman, Professor of Social Psychology at 
Columbia University. 

"Morality arises out of conflict. Where 
there is life there is conflict, and where 
there is conflict, a moral life begins." § 


# E. C. Lindeman, "Moral Life in a World of Conflicts”, 
Religious Education , Vol. 42, (July-Aug. 1947), p.2-19. 


The moral precept evolved by society serves to 

make the new individual member conform to certain 

ways of life which the society feels desirable or 

necessary. As Will Durant says; 

"It is one purpose of a moral code to adjust 
the unchanged - or slowly changing - impulses 
of human nature to the changing needs and 
circumstances of human life.” § 


# W. Durant, The S t ory o f Civilization, p. 51.

about the non-religious origins of morality. Westermarck

challenges the theological argument that religion 
is the basis of morals* 

"The theological argument in favor of the 
objective validity of moral judgments, which is 
based on belief in an all-good God who has 
revealed his will to mankind, contains of course 
an assumption that cannot be proved scientifically. 
But even if it could be proved, would that justify 
the conclusion drawn from it? Those who maintain 
that they possess in such a revelation an absolute 
moral standard and that, consequently, any mode 
of conduct which is in accordance with it must 
be objectively right, may be asked what they mean 
by an all-good God? If God were not supposed to 
be all-good, we might certainly be induced by 
prudence to obey his decrees, but they could not 
lay claim to mor al validity; suppose the devil 
were to take over““the government of the world, 
what influence would that have on the moral 
values - would it make right wrong and wrong 
right? It is only the all-goodness of God 
that might give his commandments absolute moral 
validity. But to say that something is good 
because it is in accordance with the will of 
an all-good God is to reason in a circle; if 
goodness means anything it must have a meaning 
which is independent of his will. God is called 
good or righteous because he is supposed to 
possess certain qualities which we are used to 
call so: he is benevolent, he requites virtue 
and vice, and so forth, ^or such reasons do we 
add the attributes goodness and righteousness 
to his other attributes, which express qualities 
of an objective character, and by callimg him 
all-good we attribute to him perfect goodness. § 


#( Westermarck 1 s Footnote): Of. Shaftesbury. _"Who¬ 
ever thinks there is a God and pretends formally 
to believe that he is just and good, must suppose 
that there is independently such a thing as 
justice and injustice, truth and falsehood, right 
and wrong; according to which he pronounces that 
God is just, righteous and true. st 


As a matter of fact, there are also many theologians 
who consider moral distinctions to be antecedent 
to the divine commandments. Thomas Aquinas and

his school maintain that the right is not right 
because God wills it, but that God wills it 
because it is just* 

"I have thus arrived at the conclusion 
that the attempts of philosophers and theo¬ 
logians to prove the objective validity of 
moral judgments give us no right to accept such 
validity as a fact. I am now prepared to take 
a step further and assert that it cannot exist." # 


§ Op. Git. pp. 32-3. 


Westermarck*s conclusions regarding the influence 
of religion on morals do not agree with the claim 
that religion is basic to morality. He says: 

"It has been claimed that Christianity 
has proved itself the highest ethical force in 
the history of man*; that all virtue and good 
conduct in mankind owe their origin to the 
Christian religion; that it has been the main 
source of the moral development of Europe. I 
have examined the influence which Christianity 
has exercised both on morals in general and 
within various departments of social and moral 
life, and arrived at different conclusions. 

It is interesting to note that even a theological 
writer like Dr. Inge says ’it is disquieting for 
Christians to have to admit that the growth of 
humanity, in the sense of humaneness does not 
owe much to the churches.’ 

*My criticism has not been based on_any 
standard of ’moral objectivity’ because I 
maintain that there is no such standard, moral 
judgments being ultimately based upon emotions, 
which vary in different individuals. It has 
been said that Christianity lifts morality out 
of mere relativity, and that ’the Christian 
point of view gives to conduct an absolute 
value 1 , but as we have seen, there are in 
Christianity many different points of view." #

As was mentioned earlier, as morality and religion 
developed, the moral codes were taken up and identi¬ 
fied with the religions. However, the religions had 
also retained some aspects of the magic of the past, 
and thus mystery and supernaturalism lent weight to 
social disapproval and law as influences for morality. 
Durant says: 

"... To provide, so to speak, an invisible 
watchman to strengthen the social impulses 
against the individualistic by poiAerful hopes 
and fears, societies have not invented, but 
made use of, religion. 

"... Religion is not the basis of morals, 
but an aid to them; conceivably they could 
exist without it, and not infrequently they 
have progressed against it© indifference or its 
obstinate resistance. ... as a rule religion 
sanctions not any obsolute good (since there is 
none), but those norms of conduct which have 
established themselves by force of economic 
and social circumstances; like law it looks 
to the past for its judgments, and is apt 
to be left behind as conditions change and 
morals alter with them." § 


# 


W. Durant, 



Civilization, 


PP«

70.-71 


Religion, Durant says, supports morality by two means 
chiefly: myth and taboo. 

Westermarck sees religion affecting morality in 
a similar way. 

"Prom this survey of Christian ethics ... 
we now come to the question, how far they may be 
supposed to have influenced the morality of 
human conduct. The belief in a god who acts 
as a guardian of worldly morality undoubtedly 
gives emphasis to its rules. To the social and 
legal sanctions a new one is added, which derives

peculiar strength from the supernatural power 
and knowledge of the Deity. The divine avenger 
c'an punish those who are beyond the reach of 
human justice and those whose secret ways 
escape the censure of their fellow men; and 
the righteous G-od can also reward goodness 
w r hich receives no other reward, j&mong the 
early Christians the hope of blessedness and 
especially the fear of eternal punishment 
must have exercised a powerful effect in 
connection with-their belief in the imminence 
of the millenium." $ 


§ Otd. Pit . , p. 406 


Westermarck cautions, however, that there are 
also certain circumstances which detract considerably 
from the influence of the religious sanction when 
compared with other sanctions of morality. The 
supposed punishments and rewards of the future life 
have a disadvantage of being conceived as being 
very remote and fear and hope decrease in inverse 
ratio to the distance of their objects. Death is 
commonly considered as something that is far off, 
and therefore the retribution after death also 
appears distant and unreal and is comparatively 
little thougit of by the people who believe in it. 

Moreover, in the nineteenth century a considerable 
number of Christians began to feel shocked by the 
ancient doctrine of eternal punishment. 

"Nowadays, according to Dr. Major, the 
general belief in the Snglish church is that 
f the soul at death passes into the spirit 
world and never again has anything to do with

its fleshly integument, which has been 
deposited in the grave 1 ; and a conviction 
has grown up that heaven and hell are 
thought of not as localities but as 
personal states, and that there is every 
degree of purgatory between them. Dr. Inge 
does not think that in our time at any 
rate self-regarding motives, based on 
calculation of future happiness or misery, 
have much influence. For those who accept 
the views expressed in the recent Report 
of the Commissioners on Christian Doctrine 
appointed by the English Archbishops, 
that the essence of hell is merely ex¬ 
clusion from the fellowship of Cod, there 
cannot be much fear of it. fT § 


# Westermarck, 0j>. Git., p. 407. 


Westermarck concludes that although acts which were 

originally prompted by hope or fear may leave behind 

habits for which there is no longer any motive, and 

although sincere devotion to a divine law-giver may 

lead to a perfectly unselfish desire to d>ey his will, 

religion is still not basic to morality. 

W. T. Stace also sees no necessity for holding 

religion as basic to morality. 

"It has been held that the obvious necessity 
for a standard outside pleasure, by which 
pleasure is to be judged, points to some 
criterion of judgment outside of experience 
altogether. We can only understand this 
mystery, we are told, in terms of the Absolute, 
only if we accept some such philosophy as 
that of absolute idealism. Or else - it 
has been asserted - we must introduce a 
teleological conception of the universe at 
large. The satisfactions of the spirit are 
higher because of the spiritual nature of 
the whole universe, because they forward the 
cosmic plan in which the movement towards

spirit, and away from matter, is the 
leading idea. 

7 "I do not assert that there is no 

cosmic plan. I only assert that I do not 
know whether there is or not, and that if 
there is I have no understanding whatever 
of what the plan may be. And I am certain 
that those who talk big about the Absolute 
and about teleology are as completely 
ignorant of the matter as I am. And for 
this reason, if for no other, it is futile 
to make either the cosmic plan or the 
Absolute the standard of higher and lower 
satisfactions. Nor is it necessary to 
attempt to do this. For the explanation 
of the riddle, I should say, lies under 
our noses in quite ordinary, empirical, 
and mundane considerations. It is capable 
of an entirely naturalistic solution. It 
is therefore unnecessary to seek for an 
explanation beyond the stars.” § 


# W. T. Stace, The Concept of Morals, p. 154-5. 


Stace rejects both ethical absolutism and ethical 
relativity. He believes morality relative to the 
universal needs of human nature, but not relative 
to the particular needs of particular nations, ages 
or social groups. Morality to him is not absolute 
but is universal. He sets out to show that there 
is this universal morality which applies not merely 
to a race, or to an age, but to all humanity in all 
ages. 

Stace first formulates a general law of morals 
which embodies the three concepts of happiness- 
production, altruism and justice. 

”Act always so as to increase human 
happiness as much as possible. And at the

same time act on the principle that all 
persons, including yourself are intrinsically 
of equal value." # 

# Ibid., p. 180. 

From this law,*Stace draws the conclusion that 
the essence of morality is unselfishness. Conversely, 
the essence of immorality is selfishness. Therefore 
any objection which anyone may urge against any 
course of action on any ground other than that it is 
selfish is not a moral objection. In other words, 
nothihg can be morally wrong which does not cause, 
or tend to cause, injury (unhappiness or decrease 
of happiness) to a fellow being. Actions which do 
not cause happiness may often be objectionable. But 
they are not morally objectionable. They may contra” 
vene perfectly reasonable rules of conduct. But these 
cannot be moral rules. Essentially, morality is 
based on altruism. 

Stace then proceeds to show the universality 
of morality as expressed in his law. He does not 
claim that all people, everywhere, have consciously 
accepted the morality of altruism in the form or 
in the words in which he has expressed it. He sees 
his principle as equivalent in meaning to the precept 
"Do unto others as you would that they should do 

He does not say that all the practices 


unto you."

which are approved in a particular social group 
are expressions of altruism. Neither does he say 
that the principle of altruism is found everywhere 
complete and fully developed. Altruism evolves in 
mankind from the primitive moral code of a savage 
society to the gdden rule of Christianity. 

"To sum up what has so far been said. 

There actually is a single universal morality 
which all humanity has recognized in the past 
and recognizes today. But this bold statement 
does not mean that men’s moral ideas about 
particular duties or crimes are everywhere the 
same. ...What it does mean is that the 
principle of altruism, as formulated is the 
abstract statement of that which, whether as 
vague feeling or as conceptual idea is every¬ 
where the moving spirit and the inner life 
of whatever morality exists. Here it is no 
more than a scarcely visible seed. There it 
is a full grown tree. Here it is dim and 
misty. There it shines out with the purity of 
a star. Here it is overlaid and encrusted with 
barbarities. There it is found nearly pure. 
Wherever there is morality at all,there, in 
that place, there is altruism in greater or 
less degree." § 


# rbid.,p. £43-4. 

Moral obligation arises out of two special parts 
in human nature, says Stace. The first is the social 
nature of man. The second - which is closely 
connected with the first, but not identical with 
it - is his capacity for being made happy in some 
degree by the bare fact of the happiness of other 
persons. Stace explains these two facts of human 


nature

"This social nature of man is one of 
the two sources of moral obligation. It is 
the most primitive source and perhaps the 
most important. It is this which in the 
first instance forces morality upon us. For 
without society men cannot be happy, and they 
cannot have society except upon the basis of 
a greater or lesser degree of altruism. The 
only condition upon which men can live to¬ 
gether is that they shall have regard to the 
needs, desires, and feelings of each other. 
Thus it is impossible for me to be happy un¬ 
less I am prepared to act for the happiness 
of other men. And to say this is to say that 
morality, at least the rudiments of it, is a 
necessity for happiness. Why, then, should 
I be moral? Because I myself can only be 
happy if I am moral, that is, if I consult 
the happiness of my fellows." § 


# Ibid ., pp. £66-7. 


"Thus this second universal fact of human 
nature is also one of the foundations of moral 
obligation. For it is an essential basis of 
altruism. It means that men cannot be happy 
unless they work for the happiness of others. 
Why should I be moral? This means, Why should 
I be unselfish? One reason has already been 
found in the fact of sociality. The other 
reason is now before us. That I am, willy 
nilly, made directly happy by the happiness 
of others, and unhappy by their unhappiness, 
means that I can only attain complete happi¬ 
ness for myself through unselfishness, through 
seeing others happy and making them happy. 

Work for the happiness of others is the most 
valuable source of my own happiness. " # 


# Ibid ., pp. £73-4. 

Moral obligations flows from these two sources, 
says Stace. The real road to happiness is the road 
of altruism, and this is true whether men recognize 


the fact or not

Having now considered the arguments both for 
and against the claim that religion is basic to 
morality, what conclusions may we draw? It would 
seem that the arguments quoted conflict so 
strongly that no definite conclusion is possible. 
Inasmuch as men such as Niebuhr, Caird and Barnes 
can be challenged so strongly, we cannot accept 
as conclusive the claim that religion is basic to 
morality. 

We shall now turn to a more specific aspect 
of the problem of religion and morals and examine 
the relation between religion and juvenile de¬ 
linquency. The charge is often made that juvenile 
delinquency results from the omission of religious 
influences in the lives of children, and can be 
checked only by bringing religion back to the 
school. We have seen this claim frequently made 
by the proponents of religious education in their 
statements of aims and objectives. Are these claims 
sound? 

No studies have been made to determine the success 
of religious education programs in attaining their 
objectives. The only objective statements concerning 
the relation of religious instruction to delinquency 
are to the effect that of the boys who appear in

Police Court, few have ever been members of a Sunday 
School. 

However, there have been careful investigations 

into the relation of church membership to crime, and 

into the effects of instruction in religion upon 

delinquency, all of which bear upon our problem. 

As long as 1917, criminologists stated that 

religion did not necessary reduce crime. In that 

year, Enrico Ferri said: 

"History and criminal psychology bear witness 
that a corrupted religion foments criminality. 

... Religion, even when it works for the common 
good and not for the profit of a caste, can offer 
only a transitory obstacle to crime." # 

# Enrico Eerxi, Criminal Sociology , p. 271. 


His contemporary, Cesare Lombroso, professor of 
psychiatry and criminal anthropology at the University 
of Turin, wrote: 

"It is time to free ourselves from the 
ativistic tendency which has survived unnoticed 
even in the most scientific observer, to regard 
religion as a universal panacea for crime... « 

"We cannot ... find in religion, at least 
as it is understood in the Latin countries a 
remedy against crime.” # 


# C. Lombroso, Crime . Its Causes and Remedies , pp. 292-3. 

Although these are statements of men working in the 
field of criminology, they mu3t be regarded only as 
early opinions in this controversial field

of study. 

Let us look at the problem of religion and crime 
in the light of more scientific data. 

If religion were a deterrent to crime, one would 
expect to find few people in our penal institutions who 
acknowledge a religion. But such is not the case. 

From a study conducted by Franklin Steiner on the 
religious preferences of prison inmates, it was found 
that of 85,000 individuals eighty per cent expressed 
a preference for Christianity; only 8,000 indicated 
no preference at all, and a mere 150 identified them¬ 
selves as either atheists or agnostics. # 

# Cf. V. T. Thayer, Religion in Public E ducation , p.110. 

Healy and Bronner studied 1636 delinquents who 
appeared before the Chicago Juvenile Court in 1910 
and found that ninety per cent of them were of religious 
background, and less than one-tenth of one per cent 
definitely of no religion.# They concluded that

in combatting stresses that make for the production of 
delinquency." #

Dr. Teeters, investigating the religious 
affiliations of inmates of twenty-seven penitentiaries 
and nineteen reform schools, found that 71.8 per cent 
of the inmates were affiliated with some religion, 
whereas only 46.6 per cent of the total population in 
the United States are members of religions bodies. § 

§ V. T. Thayer, Qg_. Git., pp. 109-10. 

Dr. George Mur sail, of the Ohio Department of 
Welfare, from a comparison of a group of boys in the 
Ohio Reform School at Lancaster with lav/-abiding 
children outside, found that the inmates of the 
reformatory had received fully as much religious 
training as had non-offenders. He concluded from the 
evidence that ,f f it seems safe to state that there is 
no significant relation between religious training 
and delinquent or non-delinquent behaviour. ttf # 

§ Ibid ., p. 110. 

Sheldon and Eleanor Glueck made a study based on 
a careful investigation into the life histories of 
all (510) prisoners released from the Massachusetts 
Reformatory whose sentences expired in 1921 and 1922. 
Regarding the religion of these men, they state: 

tf 0f the 460 men about whom this fact was 
known, 8.5 "per cent attended church regularly 
every Sunday prior to their commitment to the

While the G-luecks could find no basis for the 
claim that religion checks delinquency, they did bring 
up other interesting information. Of the members of 
the group which was studied, sixty per cent came from 
homes where one parent was dead, and twenty-five per 
cent from homes where the parents had been separated, 
divorced, or had deserted* Educationally, forty-xive 
per cent had never got beyond the fifth grade in 
school, and ninety per cent did not get beyond grade

Luba comments thus on the situation: 

"To the picture of the failure of a great 
Christian country to educate its citizens, let 
this damning trait be added: 84 per cent of 
these unfortunates came from broken homes; the 
parents were dead, or separated or in the 
institutions," #

# S. L. Pressey, I. E. lanney, R. G. Kuhlen,

From a study of the results he concluded that: 

" ? There appears to be no relationship of 
any consequence between Biblical information 
and the different phases of conduct studied. 

It indicates very definitely that mere 
knowledge of the Bible is not in itself 
sufficient to insure character growth, 1 " #

In all the above studies, we find no evidence to 
support the claim that religion is effective in cneching 
delinquency.

of religious instruction of children. Probably the 
most extensive study of this nature was the one 
conducted by Hartshorne and May, and published in a 
three-volume work under the general title: St udies 
i n th e Nature o f Char a cte r, The investigators 
found from an extensive survey of the actions of 
children under stress that those who attended Sunday 
Schools acted no better than did children of a 
similar background who lacked religious instruction. 

’’Indeed the authors conclude that ’apparently 
the tendency to deceive is about as prevalent 
among those enrolled in Sunday Schools as it is 
among those who are not.™ § 

§ Ibid ., p. 110. 


The point is that children are not necessarily 
moral because they go to Sunday School, but they go 

i 

to Sunday School because they are moral, - that is, 
because the influences of the home and of the parents 
which result in their going to Sunday School are also 
conducive to good moral development. 

M In the matter of honesty, cooperation, 
inhibition, and persistence, we find a general 
tendency for children enrolled in Sunday Schools 
to exhibit more desirable conduct than the 
children who are not enrolled in Sunday Schools. 
But, on the other hand, we find (and this is 
especially true of honesty) that there is 
practically no correlation between frequency of 
attendance at Sunday School and conduct. 
Apparently it is only necessary to be enrolled. 
It is clear that we have here an excellent

illustration of selection. It is the better 
trained children who are enrolled in the 
Sunday Schools in the first place. Further¬ 
more, it is not expected that the Sunday School, 
having the children for one out of one hundred 
waking hours, could do very much in the way of 
establishing habits of conduct.” § 


$ Hartshorne, Character in Human Relations, mD. 
224-5. -----^ 


Hartshorne and May conclude that no one is honest 
or dishonest by nature. Where conflict arises between 
a child and his environment, deception is a natural 
mode of adjustment. If indirect ways of gaining his 
end are successful, they will be continued unless 
direct training is undertaken through which direct and 
honest methods may also be successful. The main 
attention of educators should be placed not so much 
in devices for teaching honesty or any other trait, 
as on the reconstruction of school practices in such 
a way as to provide, not occasional, but constant and 
regular opportunities for the successful use by both 
teachers and pupils of such forms of conduct as make 
for the common good.f 

# H. Hartshorne and M. A. May, Studies in Decei t, 
pp. 412-14. 

Mere talking about morality without creating 
opportunities for moral development will not promote 
moral growth. This is the basic implication that

pervades the conclusions drawn from the studies of 
Hartshorne and May. They restate it in their Studi es 
i n S erv ice a nd S elf-Contr ol . 

"If standards and ideals, whether already in 
the possession of the group or not, are to function 
as controlling factors, they must become a part of 
the situation to which the child responds and 
assist in the achievement of satisfactory modes 
of adjustment to those aspects of the situation 
which are independent of these standards and 
ideals - they must be tools rather than objects 
of aesthetic appreciation." # 


§ H. Hartshorne, M. A. May, I. B. Mailer, Studi e s in 
Service and Se lf-Con trol, p, 454. 


Hartshorne and May summarize what they consider 
to be the basic facts which underlie any attempt at 
moral development: 

(1) What must be learned must be experienced. 

(2) What must be experienced must be represented 
in the situation to which the children are 

exposed. 

(3) If what is to be learned is some form of 
conduct or mode of adjustment, then the 
situations to which the children are 
exposed must be opportunities to pursue 
interests which lead to the conduct to 
be learned. 

(4) This conduct must be carried on in relation 
to the particular situations to which it

is the preferred mode of response. § 


# Ibid., p. 454. 


In other words, the moral response can only be learned 
in the moral situation for which it is the accepted 
response, and not from mere discussion of morality. 


It seems that such principles were recognized by 
the members of the Royal Commission appointed to 
investigate the penal system of Canada. In a section 
of their Report, which discusses religious services 
and chaplains, they say: 

ft It appears to your commissioners that it 
has been regarded officially that a chaplain is 
performing his duties satisfactorily so long as 
he can show that he has been holding the required 
religious services and going through the form of 
his pastoral functions, albeit with a minimum of 
inconvenience to himself. In the opinion of your 
commissioners, the mere holding of religious 
services, important as this is, when without 
diligent and constant personal service, is of 
little avail in accomplishing any measure of 
reformation. 

* f It is essential that the chaplain should 
gain and hold the confidence of the prisoners. 
Experienced prison officers are unanimously of 
the opinion that there are few prisoners who 
are without some good in them. The task of the 
chaplain is to find that good and develop it, 
and the task cannot be accomplished merely by 
the preaching of sermons. It may be accomplished 
by rendering small personal kindnesses (e.g., 
communicating with the prisoner 1 s wife and 
children) or by assisting the prisoner through 
personal contact, to find employment on release, 
or even by advice and encouragement during his 
incarceration. Works, not words, make a good 
prison chaplain. 

"While the regular instruction must be a 
part of the chaplain’s duty, it will be very

unfortunate if the lad [the prisoner] comes to 
associate the profession of religion with the 
clergy alone. Officers [of the prison] of every 
rank ought to be encouraged to take an actual 
part in the services. The fact that they have 
faith and live in accordance with their faith 
may have more influence with the lad than 
anything else. He does not find it easy to 
believe what he is told, or what he reads, but 
he will believe what he sees. n § 

ff Report of the Royal Commission to Investigate the 
Penal System of Canada, 1938. pp. .123-4. 

Now what are we to draw from these data? What 
implications have these studies for our problem con¬ 
cerning the relation between religious education and 
juvenile delinquency? Three conclusions seem indi¬ 
cated. First, on the basis of the studies of the 
church affiliation of prisoners and delinquents, 
it does not seem that these affiliations were potent 
in combatting the stresses which make for the pro¬ 
duction of delinquency. Secondly, contact with 
religious information, or exposure to moral instruction 
will not in itself produce moral behavior. Thirdly, 
moral behavior arises out of moral situations - if 
we would promote moral growth in our youth we must 
provide opportunities for developing uhis socially 
desirable behavior. As religious education as it 
is proposed would consist mainly of the transmission 
of religious and Biblical knowledge, it is unlikely 
that such instruction would develop a morality which

would counteract delinquent behavior. Neither does 
it seem that sectarian religion is effective in 
stemming delinquency. It appears, therefore, that 
the claim that sectarian religious education in the 
schools will check delinquency cannot be accepted. 

One more objective of religious education is 
left for our consideration. It is a worldly one 
which we have seen was implied more than stated, and 
which aims through sectarian religious instruction 
at acquainting children with the church, in the hope 
of increasing church membership. Such an attitude is 
dangerous to the school. 

The objectives of the school are meant to 
transcend the narrow aims of the individual or sect. 

Our schools were conceived to provide for all children. 
The rich, the poor, the strong and the infirm, 
children with strange pronunciations and varying 
customs, black, v^hite, yellow, red - descendants of 
many races, expressing various creeds and professing 
many religions, find equality and opportunity in the 
school. Here they learn that one’s accent, one’s 
color, one’s religion, do not set him apart from his 
fellows. The school attempts to provide a broad basis 
of knowledge, and to foster a critical yet sympathetic 
and broadminded attitude, by which the individual can 
search out the truth for himself. It does not try

to turn out members of one craft, or one profession, 
or one political creed or of one religious sect. 

Its functions must be broader. The aim of the school 
is to find common ground for all to live together 
and not to emphasize the differences of race or of 
religion which are basic to much of the bigotry and 
intolerance which so often characterize our adult 
society. 

We have now examined the basic aims and objectives 
of religious education in the public school as they 
are set forth by its advocates. On the basis of 
our study we have found that religion cannot con¬ 
clusively be accepted as a basis for morality. The 
argument that religion forms such a basis cannot 
therefore be accepted as a reason for introducing 
religious education into the schools. Similarly, 
the claims that religious education will underwrite 
democracy and check delinquency cannot be substantiated. 
Consequently, we must conclude that there is no 
justification for introducing sectarian religious 
education into the public schools on the grounds 


advocated

CHAPTER VIII 

IS RELIGIOUS EDUCATION PRACTICABLE ? 

In the preceding chapter, the theories behind 
religious education were examined and found invalid* 

Do the practical results of programs of religious 
education now in operation substantiate or refute 
these findings? It is the purpose of this chapter 
to examine the methods which are suggested for 
attaining the objectives of the champions of 
religious education, to determine the practicability 
of such methods and the extent to which they have 
achieved, or show promise of achieving, the results 
for which they were designed* 

The schemes for religious education now in 
effect in Great Britain, the United States and Canada 
fall into four groups, each with many minor variations. 
They are: 

(1) Released time programs. 

(£) Dismissed time programs. 

(3) Combined syllabuses, in or out of the 
curriculum. 

(4) Religion as a part of the curriculum. 

These plans will be dealt with singly, in the order 
given.

Because there is little likelihood of any valid 
empirical evidence being obtained on the problem, we 
must assess the various approaches to religious 
education on the basis of their obvious advantages and 
disadvantages. The development of closer harmony among 
pupils, the growth of tolerance, and other desirable 
results or their opposites are factors to be considered. 
The previous chapter pointed out that there is no 
measurable difference in behavior traits between those 
who obtain religious instruction regularly in Sunday 
school and those who do not. Religious instruction 
given in the public school may have different results. 
Simply because the administration of a program of 
religious education is a difficult problem, the plan 
should not be discarded. If a program produces the 
desired results, a method can be found to implement it. 
The fundamental principles upon which our public 
school system is based are democratic ideals including 
tolerance, unity, non-discrimination, equality of 
opportunity and freedom of religion. Keeping these 
basic principles in mind, let us examine the four types 
of program already mentioned, 

’Released time’ programs essentially require the

are permitted to meet with children of their faith 
for the purpose of giving them sectarian religious 
instruction. This arrangement raises obvious pro¬ 
blems. Is the dividing of children into groups on 
the basis of religious beliefs likely to promote 
unity or tolerance? Are children usually aware of 
religious differences until they are taught that 
awareness? Are pupils who are unable to accept any 
of the various faiths taught being discriminated 
against? Have they equality of opportunity in spirit 
as well as in letter? These questions must be satis¬ 
factorily answered before a released time plan for 
Alberta can be endorsed. 

The released time plan was the most common type 
of religious education program in the United States 
until the early months of 1948, when the Supreme 
Court’s decision on the McCollum Case# ruled such

been possible in evaluation of the positive effects 
produced in students attending released time classes, 
much has been written concerning the negative aspects

America", Elementary Sc h ool Jou r nal , Vol. XLVI,

summary of the disadvantages of the released time 

systems in Chicago and New York, when he summarizes 

an article in Nation*s Schools by E. H. Wilson: 

"The programs: (1) are administratively a 
nuisance; (2) deprive the pupil of time needed 
for his regular school program; (3) introduce 
a divisive religious identification into our 
melting pot; (4) actually and practically work 
to the detriment of the smaller sects and of 
secular pupils; (5) bring discredit on religion 
because of its utilization of the coercive 
authority of the state over the child, and are 
but an opening wedge for further inroads of 
sectarianism." 

Later in the same article Herrick points out the 
arguments in favor of released time programs, as 
given in a 1943 report of the New York Public Education 
Association. Improvement in cooperation between 
schools and religious institutions in the community, 
betterment of understanding of mutual problems by 
lay and religious leaders, and the creation of an 
awareness in children of religious values, God, and 
the Bible, were given by the report as inherent 
benefits accruing from released time programs. It is 
interesting to note that the first two of these points 
have no direct relation to the pupils, around whose 
education and intellectual betterment our educational

system is supposedly built* An ’awareness 1 of 
’religious values, God, and the Bible’ does not seem 
to constitute sufficient reason for instituting a 
released time program if that program carries with 
it the disadvantages already mentioned. 

An editorial in Christian Century § gives a 

# "Religion in the Public Schools", Christian Century, 

(March 19, 1941), pp. 384-85.-- ~~— 

broad view of the released time approach to religious 
education. This article argues that such systems are 
hot properly integrated in the school system and there¬ 
fore cannot produce integrated personalities in children. 
Such systems do not command unanimous approval from 
the public and are the cause of bickering and animosity. 
Gains of most of such systems are short-term ones. The 
losses may be long term, such as an accentuation of 
religious differences, a reduction of the churches’ 
sense of responsibility, and an increase in the pressure 
of religious groups on schools. W. C. Bower § writing

Century, (August 6, 1941), pp. 980-81. 

in the same magazines, comes to similar conclusions. 

Very few writers acclaim released time programs as an 
outstanding success. Moehlman #, in a recent book in

which he endeavors to show how the American way of 
life is antithetical to any program of a released 
time nature, gives fifteen reasons why such programs 
are valueless. Each of these points was phrased as 
a question for which Moehlrrian sought answers from 
arguments and experiences of others. The answers 
he found have been paraphrased below. 

(1) Student reaction to released time has not been 
very favorable. 

(2) Released time is a disintegrating force in the 
classroom and on the campus. 

(3) Released time is viewed by the average American 
as a confession of weakness and failure on *che 
part of the churches. 

(4) Released time points out the conflict within 
Protestantism between religious education and 
the Sunday school. 

(5) Examinations of released time experiments 
predict future schism among its promoters. 
Sectarians want it to perpetuate dogma. 

Liberal leaders want it to further understanding 
and appreciation. It cannot do both. 

(6) Ministers, who are seldom qualified teachers, 
can seldom teach the whole program. Teachers, 
on whom the burden falls, are seldom qualified 
to teach religion.

(7) The released time programs do not promote 
Protestant unity. 

(8) Released time does not promote Catholic- 
Protest ant understanding. 

(9) Teachers are not in favor of released time. 

(10) The granting of credit for released time 

courses conflicts with public school standards. 
(Points 11 &..]£ deal with the relation between released 
time and American law, and are irrelevant here). 

(13) Church interest in released time is declining. 

(14) The released time experiment is not adequate 
to the religious needs of our time. 

(15) Released time is promoting the disintegration 
of public educational programs which provide 
the only valid general approach to religion 
in the American way of life. 

While Moehlman*s thesis is one with which we are not 
directly concerned here, his arguments are conclusive 
when taken in context. Other writers concur with many 
of his main points. Agnes. E. Meyer,# in examining the 

§ A. E. Meyer, "The Public School and Sectarian 

Religion", Liberty , Vol. XLIII, (Second Quarter, 1948),

situation, finds many of the same arguments against 
released time and supports them as competently as 
Moehlman. Again, some of the arguments do not affect

the pupils directly and, perhaps, could be ruled 
irrelevant on that ground. 

Thayer quotes a statement by the Reverend Phillip 
Schug a minister of Champaign, Illinois, who "was 


# V. T. Thayer, Religion in Public Education , p. 126-27. 


so moved by the effects of religious segregation upon 
the children that he advised one parent, a firs. V. 
McCollum, to challenge the legality of sectarian 
teaching in tax-supported schools during school hours." 
Rev, Mr. Schug says, in part: 

"I can sympathize with the frustrations 
experienced by religious people who have seen 
their world split asunder. But I do not agree 
that the solution - taking over public school 
classes, dividing the children into two, three, 
four or more different groups, and instructing 
them separately in varying religious philosophies 
is a wise solution. Many problems arise. To 
illustrate, the problem of the direct teaching 
from divisions into different groups is a most 
serious one. Religious instruction is the only 
instruction for which children must be so divided. 
The public school is a great agent for democracy 
in that rich and poor, Jew and Gentile, and all 
social classes unite for common activity. It. 
breaks down divisions, but when sectarian religious 
instruction is added it automatically teaches, 
division and becomes an active agent in creating 
frictions. 

"Indeed, it was just this which brought Mrs. 
McCollum to me. Her boy, Terry, was ostracized 
and ridiculed by his classmates because he did 
not take religious instruction. For a child there 
is probably no punishment more severe or more 
serious than being shunned and ridiculed by.his 
fellows. Yet it is inevitable that such things 
will happen when sectarian teachers take a natural 
group and divide the sheep from the goats and 
then subdivide the sheep for instruction in 
conflicting philosophies. Such a program of

education, in my estimation, is basically unsound 
and destructive of the finer values regardless 
of the high hopes and good intentions of the 
instructors." 

A lawyer acting as corporation counsel for the city of 
Buffalo reinforces Seims*s statements: 

"Some of the more stupid teachers lined up 
against different walls of their classrooms the 
children of the various faiths, in order to 
classify them. And so these little ones stared 
across the room at each other - the Catholics at 
the Protestants, the latter at the former and 
both at the Jews. These children, for the first 
time in their short lives, were made conscious 
of alleged differences among themselves. The 
results have been the expected ones. 

"The administrative problems which have 
arisen are legion, the irritations numerous." jj 


§ Ibid ., p. 128. 

Speaking of the operation of released time programs 
in fifty-seven California cities after having made two 
surveys of the atuation, the Public Education Society 
of San Francisco has the following to say: 

"The plan is a failure in California T s 
Public Schools measured by any conceivable 
yardstick." #

In Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, a released time

abandoned. Similarly, in Baltimore, Maryland, the 
results of a released time program did not seem to 
warrant its continuation and it was abandoned also. 

In San Diego, California, after a year’s trial of a 
released time program, the Board of Education decided 
that "the results did not justify a continuation or 
extension of the plan." # 

# Ibid ., p. 84. 

That some sort of religion should be taught is 
generally accepted. That it should be sectarian, as 
provided for in released time programs, seems doubtful. 
"If religion is theology, and doctrine, and creeds made 
over disputed definitions of God and theories of man’s 
destiny, it cannot be taught in our schools. But if 
religion is love to God and man, it can be taught any¬ 
where and it ought to be taught in our schools. If it 
is not taught, our whole educational pyramid will 
continue to wobble on its pinnacle instead of resting 
firmly on its base." #

In view of tiie dearth of sound benefits attribut¬ 
able to released time programs, it does not seem 
unfair to consider these programs impracticable and 
undesirable* The situation in Alberta will be 
examined in the next chapter to determine whether 
or not the Ibregoing conclusions are applicable in 
this Province. 

Since the Supreme Court of the United States 
ruled released time programs unconstitutional in its 
decision on the McCollum Case # in March, 1948, the 

# Cf., p. 57. 

dismissed time f type of religious education program 
has increased in popularity. In this sort of program, 
the pupils are simply dismissed early one day per 
week, with no check made by the school as to where 
the children spend the hour. The onus is on the 
parents, the church and the pupils themselves to see 
that it is not wasted. The church will conceivably 
use its influence to draw the students to classes in 
religious education. What parents and children do 
remains to be seen. The system has more obvious ad¬ 
vantages than the released time plan. Divisiveness 
among the students is not accentuated, for they are 
not split into groups for instruction but simply go

individually to the church of their choice. The 
school is not burdened with administrative duties such 
as arise from many released time programs. Children 
who do not wish to participate in the religious in¬ 
struction do not create a problem for they are dismissed 
v/ith the others and can spend the time as they or their 
parents wish* As the school is not connected with the 
instruction in any way, the cry that public funds 
are being used to further particular sects cannot be 
raised. 

As this type of plan has only recently come into 
prominence, books and articles containing evaluations 
of it are still lacking. Because the legislation of 
the Province of Alberta permits religious teaching in 
the school building, dismissed time programs have not 
received attention here. At the present time, they 
seem the most acceptable method for the giving of 
religious instruction to school children of the 
United States. The same is not true of Alberta, for, 
although the plan does not carry with it many of the 
disadvantages of the released time plan, it does have 
one demerit. If the school is to give some of its 
already crowded schedule to the church, it may reason¬ 
ably ask that such time be used to advantage. Unless 
future events in the United States show tnat such plans 
are producing good results in a high percentage of the

pupils involved, similar programs cannot be justi¬ 
fiably advocated for Alberta. As mentioned in the 
previous chapter, studies have shown that there is 
no significant difference between children who attend 
Sunday school regularly and those who do not.# If a 

# Gf. , p. 

program for religious education on a dismissed time 
basis did succeed in enrolling a high percentage of 
the student body, there would still be no guarantee 
that the desired results would be achieved. When 
one considers the irresponsibility of some children 
when left to their own pursuits, and the attitude of 
many parents towards religion today, the success of 
a system of religious education on dismissed time 
v/ould seem doubtful. 

f Agreed 1 or 1 combined* syllabuses derive their 
name from having been agreed upon by several Christian 
sects as suitable programs for public school children. 
Sometimes they are taught by church leaders, but 
more often by the teacher. The agreed syllabus 
approach to the problem of religious education has 
had its major growth in Britain, but plans of a 
similar nature are becoming more numerous in Canada. 

In Britain, because relatively few sects constitute

for ease of agreement or compromise) the system has 
encountered a minimum of difficulty. In Ontario, 
where most districts have a heterogeneous population, 
the situation is more complex. 

There has been very little written concerning 
the success of agreed syllabuses, perhaps because 
such ventures are relatively new in the field of 
religious education. Perhaps, too, most people 
realize that in any program of religious instruction 
"the test of the whole enterprise is not whether 
the juniors can recite the list of the minor prophets, 
but vtfhether, when they are forty, they will be friendly, 
co-operative, intelligent, unquarrelsome Christian 
men and women." # Again, it must be stressed that

Volo 40, (Dec. 6, 1923), pp. 1573-4. 

empirical evidence as to the relative success or 
failure of a program of religious education is virtually 
impossible to obtain. We must again turn to the argu¬ 
ments and experiences of others. I. L. Kandel, in 
a short review of the report issued by the American 
Council on Education’s Committee on Religion and 
Education,# states that the Committee did not believe

that the combined syllabus was a practical solution 
to the problem of religious education* The strong 
feeling of sectarianism between most faiths would 
render such a plan unworkable. Any ’watered-down 1 
version of religious beliefs would be unacceptable 
to those people who really hold to one faith. Others#

lias come to the Department on this score from any 
part of the province." 

The situation is not as rosy as might appear 
from this letter, however. In a brief submitted to 
the Royal Commission on Education by the Central 
Division of the Canadian Jewish Congress#, the 

# "Religious Education in Ontario Schools", Canadian 
Jewish Congress, C en tral Division’s Brief to Royal 
Commission on Education, (Sept. 15, 1945), Brief 
No. 46. 


following observations were made: 

"All faiths professed by citizens of Canada 
should be on an equal footing before the law. 
Whatever may be the view of the majority of the 
people concerning religious belief, that major¬ 
ity endangers the principle of equality when it 
utilized the resources of the State to propagate 
its own view of religion, and, at the same time, 
approaches perilously close to the totalitarian 
system. 

"To speak of religious education in the public 
schools of Ontario as Christian and undenominat¬ 
ional at one and the same time is self- 
contradictory, for not only do Canadians of 
Jewish and other non-Christian faiths refuse to 
accept such teaching for their children, but 
some Christian denominations, Protestant and 
non-Protestant alike, cannot conscientiously 
permit their children to receive such teaching. 

In fact, a number have already recorded their 
protest. 

"The course in Religious Education intro¬ 
duced into the public schools of Ontario ... 
merely adds to the fifty-seven different creeds 
or denominations already reported by the dominion 
Bureau of Statistics, a fifty-eighth denomination 
or creed, with its own dogma, and perhaps 
eventually its own name. 

"In the Education Act of Great Britain passed 
in 1870, when Mr. Cowper-Temple was Minister of 
the Board of Education, an attempt was made to 








X-' o'iJU:

draft a ’non-sectarian* clause covering the 
religious education in State-provided schools, 
a clause which did not win the approval either 
of the Anglican or Non-Conformist Churches* 
Designed to eliminate sectarianism, it actually 
resulted in developing an additional sect, for, 
among the generations of children who grew up 
under the teaching of the so-called ’Cowper-" 
Temple* clause, many afterwards described 
themselves as *Cowper-Temple-ists* when asked 
their religious denomination* 

**It has been well said that few divisive 
influences in human society cut deeper and 
entail greater rancour than differences in 
religious belief. The public school is, and 
should be, our greatest unifying influence* 

It is the function and the glory of our public 
school that it is the most successful instrument 
yet devised for preparing people of every sect 
and of no sect, people of every grade and people 
of the most diverse nationalities, for progres¬ 
sive citizenship in our democracy. The obvious 
attention to religious differences, which re¬ 
ligious education in the public schools will 
promote, cannot fail to fan the flames of 
intolerance in every community where a religious 
minority exists. The more sensitive parents 
are to the facts of child development, the more 
serious will their prohIsm becorns« 

,f The provision that pupils may be excused 
from the classroom during religious instruction, 
upon written request of the parent, does not 
prevent or correct injustice. It subjects the 
children of a small minority to the embarrassment 
of excluding themselves from a school exercise in 
which others are called upon to share. The 
excluded child may become the object of reproach 
and suspicion. Such a course tends to destroy 
that equality of pupils which democratic law 
seeks to maintain and protect. Some parents, 
rather than expose their children to the em¬ 
barrassment of segregation from their fellow 
pupils, may yield in silence. 

**The continuation of such instruction will 
weaken the unifying bond of Canadianism and 
accentuate the divisive influence of credal 
friction. ff

the teachings of the religious education program of 
Ontario were recorded.# The Guide-books which are

Religion in the Textbooks for Religious Education 
of the Ontario Public Schools", Brief 46, App. 1 


provided to facilitate the instruction of the course 

were the main target of attack. Arguments, based on 

contemporary literature on Biblical matters, were 

presented under the following headings: 

"According to the Guides , Jesus 1 teaching was 
entirely novel and superior to Jewish religion." 
(The argument that it was not is based upon 
work of leading contemporary Christian 
theologians.) 

"The Guides construct an imaginary ’Jewish 
Religion’ of the time, and set Christianity 
in anti-thesis to this ’inferior’religion, 

- in spite of the warnings of G. F. Moore 
(Judaism, 3 vols., Cambridge, 19£7), and 
many others." (Examples of such mis¬ 
representation are given from the Guides .) 

"The Guides criticize Jewish beliefs without 
mentioning”that the very same beliefs were 
fundamental in the teachings of Jesus and the 
Church." (Examples are again given.) 

The Congress did not present its arguments without 

proof, but, to an ordinary reader, proved them beyond 

doubt•

"The manual is exclusively Christian. It 
is not just Bible stories but doctrine. Nor 
does it teach the fundamental agreement of all 
religions on ethical conduct and the brotherhood 
of man. No child of Jewish or unorthodox 
Christian parents could possibly participate 
in these classes if the teacher follows her 
manual. 

"To be isolated from one’s group, not to 
belong, to walk from the room alone when everybody 
else stays behind, to be jeered at in the school 
yard or on the way home... - can a child suffer 
much worse? Any reputable psychologist knows 
that a sense of security, of ’belonging 1 , is 
quite as essential as good food to a child’s 
mental and physical health." 

Although the agreed syllabus system may encounter 
a minimum of difficulty in some areas where the popu- 
lation is composed largely of one sect or of sects which 
can easily reach an agreement, In districts where the 
number and type of creeds is large, difficulties 
increase proportionately. Considering the foregoing 
arguments from the standpoint of both weight and quality, 
it would appear that the Ontario agreed syllabus system 
is not entirely satisfactory. 

Let us examine some comments on programs which 
include religion in the curriculum of the school. In 
four provinces of Canada, separate schools are per¬ 
mitted to make religion an integral part of the general 
program. These cannot be considered public schools, 
which are our main interest. However, concerning the 
results of the religious education of the separate 
schools, statistics from juvenile courts present an 
unfavorable picture of these institutions, showing

can be placed on these figures is questionable, but since 
no statistics have been shown to prove them wrong, it 
is unlikely that they have been distorted to such an 
extent that the opposite is true. The admittedly 
poorer separate school plants are less likely on the 
whole to turn out better products. The argument 
that separate school supporters are forced to live 
in the poorer sections of towns has been advanced to 
explain the high incidence of separate school children 
in juvenile courts. It is still unlikely that the 
environment of these children constitutes such a dis¬ 
advantage that the school T s work in developing good 


moral character is entirely negated, but any success 


in such training has not been statistically proven.

a program of religion was instituted with the intention 
of giving the boys "an anchor to windward, a faith 
to live by", # the necessity of which was made evident

directly out of school and putting them into the 
armed forces. On the success of the program, which 
was entirely undenominational and non-evangelistic, 
Springer has the following comments: # 

# Ibid ., p. 60. 


"The program has become an outstanding 
success through the cooperation of many persons. 

... The faculty as a whole have taken a real 
interest and, in daily contact with the boys, 
carry out the purposes and ideals of these 
studies in practical application throughout 
the school. 

"The great majority of the seniors stated 
that Pingry the [school in question] had 
been much more influential than the church or 
the home in forming their religious outlook, and 
the large majority stated that their faith or 
interest in religion had been increased by the 
work done in Pingry. Not one reported that 
his faith had been weakened. There was a call 
for greater emphasis on religion all along the 
line in school, both in the courses and in 
chapel exercises.” 

That the system is successful in raising moral standards 
of the boys and in making them better citizens has not 
been proven, but from the enthusiastic acceptance of 
the plan by the pupils, the teachers and the parents, 
it would seem to have had a most auspicious beginning. 

Religion in the curriculum seems to have been the 
most successful of any type of religious education, - 
meaning by religion ’teaching about religion 1 , not the 
inculcation of any particular creed or dogma. Not only 
does it generally receive approval by parents, but, 
if it is broad enough and completely non-sectarian,

British Columbia, in 1942, introduced a modified 
plan of curricular religious education when it per¬ 
mitted high school students to take elective courses 
in Bible study for credit. The courses were based on 
an agreed syllabus and were given off school premises, 
usually in churches. Glazier # has the following to 


§ K. M. Glazier, "Teaching Religion in The Public 
Schools of Canada; Some Recent Developments", 
Religious Education , Vol. XXXVII, No. 6, 

(Nov. - Dec. 1942)7 p. 354. 


say of the experiment: 

"The experiment, however, has been far from 
successful, according to reports from various 
ministers and authorities in British Columbia. 

A number of reasons have been given for its 
failure: the plan was launched without adequate 
build-up and without proper planning, it was 
introduced too late for students to rearrange 
their programs to include it, it was extra-mural 
and scheduled at inconvenient times, and it was 
met with indifference by some of the teachers. 
While it is true that not many students enrolled 
in the courses, yet the Province is to be 
commended for taking a step forward. An excellent 
course of study, based on the Cambridgeshire 
syllabus has been worked out, and with proper 
planning it is quite possible that something 
may still be made of the project." 




















- 175 - 


In British Columbia, as in Ontario, the question 
of what is to be done arises concerning pupils who 
wish to take the course and yet cannot accept the 
agreed syllabus. Can they be said to have equality 
of opportunity? Can a syllabus based on a few 
religious creeds teach tolerance? Will such a course 
as just outlined be approached with eagerness as 
being interesting and valuable, or will it simply 
be an easy method of obtaining high school credits? 
Will an elective course in religion, based on an 
agreed syllabus, make students tolerant and sympathetic 
individuals or will it develop a snobbish clique 
that despises all students beyond its ranks? Can 
one or two years in any period-per-week course be 
expected to meet the needs of religious education 
as its proponents see them? 

Unless a system of religious education shows 
promises of achieving long-range benefits, and unless 
it is acceptable to the people as a whole, it cannot 
be justifiably advocated for the public schools. It 
would appear that a program of public school religious 
instruction that is in any way limited by sectarianism 
is destined for failure in a country whose population 
is as heterogeneous as that of Canada, We cannot 
unconditionally reject all of the four examined 
schemes, hov/ever, until we have determined that

CHAPTER IX 

IS RELICIOUS EDUCATION DESIRABLE 
IN ALBERTA PUBLIC SCHOOLS? 


In an earlier chapter the present status of 

religious education in Alberta was examined. It was 

found that various groups and individuals in the 

province were advocating public school religious 

education. The programs they suggested were as 

various as the results they hoped to achieve. In a 

previous chapter, several aims and objectives were 

examined and found invalid. If the various objectives 

which the Alberta pressure groups hope to attain are 

the same, they must be considered invalid also. These 

aims and objectives have already been stated in Chapter 

VI, but they are repeated here for convenience. 

f We hope that ... the child may have a Faith which 
he can p ractice , not only as a child, but also as 
an adult citizen - ... love of Cod and neighbour, 
honesty, purity, temperance, respect for authority, 
and appreciation of the wonders of Cod-created 
nature .... On the realization of this hope 
amongst school children in general one would 
expect to sees a reduction in crime rate, divorce 
and juvenile delinquency; more good-will and co¬ 
operation amongst men and nations. 1 

f ... give an understanding of Christianity, its 
teaching and history. 1 

f ... give the individual something to "tie to" in 
time of difficulty. 1 

religious instruction in the schools is most 
important, especially in these times when atheism 
and communism are so active. f

’... usefulness in bringing a fuller life to the

’Some children ... never have the opportunity of

These various objectives can be roughly classified 

under five headings: 

(1) The creation in children of an awareness of 
religion. 

(2) The giving to children of a definite faith. 

(3) The underwriting of democracy. 

(4) The provision of a basis for morality. 

(5) The reduction of juvenile delinquency. 

Those objectives which fall into the first two 

categories, ’making children aware of religion’ and 
’giving children a definite faith’, cannot be termed 
invalid, for it is quite conceivable that they might 
be attained through a program of religious education. 
The place that the teaching of a definite faith has 
in a public school system, and the part the school 
should play in creating an awareness of religion, are 
dealt with in the final chapter of this thesis.

Xn Chapter VII, it was found that religious 

... . 

education cannot h ope to attain the objectives which 

fall under the last three of the above headings* It 
was found that religion does not necessarily under¬ 
write democracy, that it has not been proven basic 
to morality, and that it has very little connection 
with juvenile delinquency. Therefore, on the basis 
of this previous analysis, we must consider the last 
three aims listed above as invalid, and inconclusive 
as arguments for the institution of a program of 
religious education in Alberta. 

Are the four types of religious education pro¬ 
gram (released time, dismissed time, agreed syllabuses 
and religion in the curriculum) practical in Alberta 
even though they are impractical in other places? 

Let us examine the variables which might make Alberta 
unique as far as these systems are concerned. 

The legislation of the province provides for 
religious instruction in the public schools.$ The

last half hour of the school day may be used for 
such religious instruction as permitted or desired 
by the board. However, in rejecting the four common 
types of religious education, the authors did not 
base any of their arguments on the laws of the areas

in question. In fact, any arguments so based were 
rejected.# The fact that Alberta permits religious 

# Of. Chapter VIII, p. 

education by law does not in any way affect the im¬ 
practicability of the four types of program. 

In Alberta 1 s government, its area and its geo¬ 
graphical make-up there is nothing which makes the 
province unique insofar as religious education is con¬ 
cerned. The four systems common today do not appear 
to be cast in a more favorable light by any of these 
three factors. 

Finally, let us examine the population of Alberta. 

If the people of the province are largely of one creed, 
or if the province is divided into large sections 
whose residents are largely one creed, there would be 
a possibility that one or more of the four types of 
religious education programs might work. That such a 
possibility is a remote one is indicated by the following 
comments:# 

# These comments are from letters received by the 
authors from various parts of the province. 

f ... My subdivision has only two schools ... but 
in these two centralized schools we have seventeen 
different faiths represented ... as well as those 
who claim no religious affiliation, and atheists. 1 * *

Lutherans, Moravians, Roman Catholics, Greek 
Catholics, Russian Orthodox, Canadian Orthodox 
and United Church Protestants. P. S. I should 
add I ehovah 1 s Witnesses. r 

f ... the Board felt that with so many church 
affiliations represented in our schools it was 
difficult to arrive at a basis satisfactory to 
all concerned. 1 


’It would be difficult to arrive at a course 
which would satisfy the religious beliefs of all 
families represented in the average one room “ 
country school. 1 

Alberta does not appear to be unique in any way 
which would facilitate the implementation of any one 
of the four common types of religious education pro¬ 
gram. 

We must conclude, therefore, that religious 
education, as advocated, in any of the four common 
types of program can not be considered desirable 
in the public schools of Alberta, either from the 
standpoint of theory or practicality.

CHAPTER X 

SOME POSITIVE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS STUDY 

After viewing the conclusions reached in the 
preceding chapter one may well ask, "If we do not 
believe that the types of religious education con¬ 
sidered are practicable for Alberta, are we suggesting 
that religious education be left out of the schools 
altogether? Are the various religions of our nation, 
and the world, to be disregarded entirely? Are we 
to assume for purposes of teaching that religion 
is a thing apart from man’s existence - that 
religions have had neither origins, evolutions or 
literature, or that knowledge of these developments 
is no part of a child’s school life?" To these 
questions the authors of this thesis would like to 
make a qualified "Ho". In explanation of our answer 
there are a number of facts we believe should be 
considered. 

In the first place, it is obvious to any observer 
that religions have long been, and still are, - for 
-geod or for ill" - tremendous forces in the world. They 
are forces with which even the commonest man is at 
least slightly acquainted, and forces which his leaders 
are rarely able to ignore safely. Delegates to the 
United Nations have made us conscious of the various 
religious creeds represented around the conference

tables, and the allowances to be made for those 
beliefs; each religious group (though present through 
national or political choice) is proudly aware of 
its own religious customs, traditions and literature. 

In a smaller area, there are those who realize that 
throughout the world many peoples have each taken 
their separate w f ays of searching for deities, values, 
and philosophies of life. It is possible to sense 
man’s drive towards these religious values of various 
kinds, to understand that man has tried many ways of 
finding what he believes to be the ’good life’, to 
see how religions have affected and permeated cultures, 
and through these approaches to understanding something 
of the affinity existing among religions. To make this 
effort is something almost in the nature of an obli¬ 
gation, for in a world that is steadily ’shrinking’ in 
size, we need to make our ideas ’larger’. 

It is with this broad viewpoint, then, that we 
would like to suggest what Alberta schools might do 
in the way of religious education for their children, 
and what the aims, content, and dangers of such re¬ 
ligious education might do. 

We believe that any religious education in the 
schools should be given on a very broad, non-sectarian 
basis. It should include something of all main world 
religions - their stories, legends, literature, great

men, music, art - and should be given by the teacher 
as fairly and impartially as possible. The aims of 
education, as we understand it, are to give not only 
habits, skills, information, and techniques for 
locating information, but also a certain critical 
open-minded attitude towards information gained or 
presented. In Social Studies, for example, the school 
attempts to consider the evolutions and histories of 
governments. Information is located from various 
sources, studied, and conclusions drawn in the light 
of what seems reasonable. We suggest that the 
schools carry out the same aims and procedure with 
regard to religion, for the school exists to give 
historical and cultural implications in all areas, 
not to indoctrinate the precepts of any one area* 
Sectarian traditions are best kept in the spheres of 
home and church. 

If the schools admitted religion on this basis, 
they vtfould cease to omit wha.t has been a large force 
in our national and international life. W e could 
hope for a more critical open-mindedness with regard 
to religion. We might also hope for a greater under¬ 
standing by the pupil of his own sect, and an increased 
tolerance of his immediate ’neighbor-sects 1 . 

Finally, if our youngsters studied a little of the 
social and spiritual forces of other nations as well

as their food, clothing, shelter, and machines, they 
might leave school with a more balanced view of 
society as a whole. 

More specifically, we would suggest that in 
Grades One to Six of a child’s school life he should 
come in contact with the legends, stories, and perhaps 
some of the music, from as many religious sources as 
possible. Through a wide selection of such material 
he would begin to have a broad awareness or con¬ 
sciousness of religions. Many of the stories, most 
particularly those of a Biblical nature, have a 
further usefulness in providing a more meaningful 
background for much of his school and later reading. 
There is hardly an area of English literature (in 
its broadest sense) that does not have many allusions 
to, or quotations from, religious leaders or religious 
literature. We would suggest that this phase of 
religious education should occur in connection with 
the school literature and Social Studies and not as a 
separately time-tabled subject. That is, the material 
suggested should be deqlt with as it arises in its 
natural historical or literary context; it should not 
be treated in isolation or forced in artificially. 

In the Intermediate grades the school should 
attempt to develop the previously mentioned religious

awareness into a more specific knowledge. It is in 
these grades that the stories of the great men of 
religions - Jesus, Moses, Buddha, Mohammed, Lao-tse, 
and the great disciples of these men, would be given. 

By the time Grade Nine has been reached there should 
be some definite knowledge of some of the separate 
ways in which man has searched for religious values, 
and how various contemporary cultures have been 
affected by religion. This might be accomplished 
by dealing with the many phases of religious activities 
as they arise in the context of the various subject 
matter fields of the Intermediate School. 

In the High School, however, we think that 
religious education might be offered in one or two 
of the grades as an optional subject. The lines of 
activity begun in the Elementary and Intermediate 
Schools could be carried on. This background material, 
and some examination of basic religious literature, 
might form a core for a discussion course which would 
be largely socially oriented. In the light of their 
knowledge of religions, and of contemporary conditions, 
pupils might attempt to approach individual and social 
problems related to conduct and philosophy. If the 
attitude of a critical {that is, constructively 
critical, not cynical) open-mindedness has been created

and maintained throughout school life, then such 
a procedure should be far from impossible. 

The difficulties and dangers of the proposed 
plan are very obvious. It is evident that such a 
course requires far more forethought, preparation 
of material, and impartiality, than any of the four 
religious education schemes previously discussed 
and dismissed. The course materials should be drawn 
up by the ablest people available only after very 
careful consideration of a large subject-matter 
field. Comprehensive teacher guides would have to 
be constructed and many hints to do with the 
handling of material inserted in the general Course 
of Studies. The teachers themselves would need a 
great deal of preparation, either through University 
courses or private reading. 

It is, however, in the handling of the course 
that all possible precautions need to be taken. 1 l he 
individual teacher can ’break* the course far more 
easily than he or she can ’make* it, and for that 
reason is by far the most important person concerned. 
It is through the teacher that the plan is open to 
abuses.of various kinds, such as an attempt to 
inculcate particular sectarian ideas. This is 
dangerous because such a procedure defeats the broad 
aims of both the school and the original course. In 
addition, it brings disrespect for both the teacher

ana the sectarian ideas emphasized, for school 
children are very sensitive to partiality - 
especially when both teacher and course set out 
to be ♦impartial 1 . As well, community reaction to 
prolonged sectarian detours might endanger the 
continuance of the course in the school program. 

In connection with community reaction there is also 
the real danger that elements within the community, 
unable to see any immediate benefits of the non¬ 
sectarian plan, would become a pressure group for 
wholesale sectarian religious education. Thus the 
non-sectarian plan might eventually become a wedge 
for the entry of ’improvements 1 . 

Because of the dangers and difficulties out¬ 
lined, we suggest that, if such a religious education 
scheme as we propose were initiated, it be tried 
first of all in not more than ten schools in the 
province. In this way community co-operation and 
reaction, and teacher experience, could be assessed. 
Through the information thus gained the original 
plan would be confirmed, modified, or rejected be¬ 
fore it was attempted on a large scale. r !he 
experiment might well occupy at least ten years. 

Thus, although we do not agree that sectarian 
religion has a place in the -school, we feel that 
religion, generally speaking, cannot be ignored.

Scope A. 

APPENDIX I 

NATIONAL BASIC OUTLINE OF RELIGIOUS 

INSTRUCTION 

1. - PRIMARY 

{a) Infant s (5 - 7) 

Stories illustrative of God’s care; parables 

of nature; God’s provision for food, clothing 

and shelter for man and beast. 

B. 

Stories of Jesus. These would be chosen to 

show His home life; His deeds of kindness and 

His love of children. 

C. 

Stories from the Old Testament which illustrate 

how God’s love and care helped those who became 

great men, e.g., Joseph, Moses, Samuel. 

D. 

Similar stories from other times and other lands 

E. 

Memorisation of appropriate sentences or short 

passages from the Bible. 

Method 

Narration of stories by the teacher. The pres¬ 
entation should be of a kind which will preserve 

the joy of the story. Teaching which stresses 

the memorising of facts should be used sparingly 

The usual methods empbyed in Infant’s schools 


should be fully used, such as the use of pictures, 
plays and free dramatisation, and other forms of 
expression work.

Use should be made of the festivals during the 
year, e.g., Christmas, Easter, Whitsuntide, Harvest 

(b) Junior (7 to 11) 

Scope A* Stories of Jesus. These would be chosen so that 
an outline of the whole of the Story of Jesus 
would be covered during the first three years. 
During the last year the Life of Christ as given 
in St. Mark’s G-ospel might be taken. 

B. Stories Jesus would hear of great men and women 

of his own country at various stages of the nation’ 
history, showing the part they played, how they 
served their fellow men and how they were in¬ 
spired by their belief in Cod and His purpose as 
they understood it. 

C. Stories from the New Testament to illustrate how 
Christianity spread through the adventures and 
travels of its early preachers and heroes. 

D. Stories of the followers of Jesus who have served 
their fellow men in different countries and at 
various periods of history. 

E. Memorisation and choral speaking of suitable 
passages. 

Method During this stage there will be a gradual trans¬ 
ition from stories which appeal mainly to the im¬ 
agination, and an increasing emhasis on historical 


fact.

Opportunities for activities should be pro¬ 
vided by dramatisation and other, forms of exp¬ 
ression work, including pictorial representation, 
modelling and written work. 

While oral work w r ill play the most important part, 
children should be encouraged to read the stories 
as given in the Bible. 

Memory work should be included* but more time 
might be given to choral speaking to enable 
children to become familiar with appropriate 
passages from the Bible. 


II. - SECONDARY 
(a) First Stage (11 to 15) 

Scope A. The Bible viewed as a continuous record of God’s 
unfolding purpose and man’s response to it. 

B. The life and teaching of Jesus Christ. 

C. The spread of Christianity and its influence upon 
the life of various countries at different periods 
of history. 

D. The fundamental beliefs of Christianity; this may 
include comparisons with the beliefs of other 
religions. 

E. Memorisation and choral speaking of great 
passages from the Old Testament, the New 
Testament and the Apocrypha.

With so comprehensive an outline of work the 
temptation will be to attempt too much. This is 
to be avoided for two reasons - (i) the teacher 
may be so anxious to cover the scheme of work that 
pupils are unable to grasp what they are studying; 

(ii) the pupils may acquire a distaste for the subject 
and look forward to dropping it when they leave 
school. 

The problem is therefore to devise a scheme of 
work which will afford sufficient basic knowledge 
and permit of sufficient time for this to be 
assimilated. Ommission is as important as inclusion 
in the formulation of a good scheme. 

There will be a four years f course which should be 
a unified one. In its formulation account will 
necessarily be taken of the developing capacity of 
pupils. The methods of organising the course may 
differ. In some schools the concentric method will 
no doubt be followed, by which each year f s Yrork, 
dealing with the Old Testament, the Life of Christ 
and the spread of Christianity will be planned as a 
unit. In other schools the course will be consecutive 
for the four years, probably falling into two parts 
for the years 11 to 13 and 13 to 15 years respectively. 
But whatever method may be adopted, it is important 
that the New Testament should not be omitted from

any year’s work and that the balance of the course 
as indicated in A-E above should be maintained. 

The fact that many children will leave school at 
the end of this period wall obviously have an im¬ 
portant bearing on the shaping of the course. 
Opportunities should be afforded for dealing 
adequately with inquiries; and provision should be 
made for the discussion of religious and ethical 
problems which may arise. At no stage should the 
teaching be divorced from the life of the pupils; on 
the contrary, its application to their everyday 
experiences should be regarded as an inherent part of 
the scheme of work. Special care should be taken to 
see that for those who are leaving school the later 
part of the course includes some preparation for the 
problems they will meet when they enter industry or 
commerce• 

(b) Second Stage (16 to 18) 

In the later years of school life (i.e., 16 to 18) 
the scheme of study and instruction will be determined 
by the consideration of the needs and interests of the 
pupils. In addition to having regard to the pupil’s 
stage of development and to his growth in knowledge 
and experience account will have to be taken of his 
other studies. To some extent these will influence his

approach to the study of the Scriptures, and of 
religious topics generally, and special measures 
may be necessary to achieve the desired coadination 
of various aspects of knowledge and experience. 

In these circumstances there cannot but be at this 
stage a wide variety in the methods of approach to 
the study of the Scriptures and of religious questions. 

It is suggested that material should be drawn from the 
following: - 

1. The study of the Bible and the growth of Christianity. 

2. The Bible, its origin and growth, how the various 
books came to be written, and why they were 
selected. 

3. The history of the English Bible and its influence 
on literature and civilisation. 

4. The development of the conception of God in the 
Bible and in Christian thought. 

5. The study of St. John’s Gospel and of the Epistles 
of St. Paul. 

6. The problems of the Bible - inspiration the truth 

of the Bible, the historical accuracy of the Gospels, 
the Bible and science, miracles, progressive 
revelation. 

7. Problems of personal and social ethics. 

8. The influence of Christianity and of the Christian 
fellowship in the world today.

- 227 - 


9. The history of Christianity in Great Britain 
with particular reference to the last 300 years* 
10* Christianity and other religions. 


Method 

At the secondary stage there will be a transition 
from story to history, and the pupil’s reading of the 
Bible should be planned withthis aim in view. 

For teaching purposes the Revised Version of the 
Bible is preferable to the Authorised, especially in 
reference to the Old Testament; and for purposes of 
interpretation, modern versions have their value. 

In the early years narration will still play an 
important part. But as the period progresses the 
reading of the Bible itself by the pupils should be 
given a larger place. At first it might be taken in 
preparation for, or as supplementary to, narration. 

In successive years, however, Bible reading should 
provide more and more possibilities for discussion. 

The fullest use should be made of opportunities to 
associate religious instruction with work in other 
subjects; and methods usually considered appropriate 
with pupils of this age in the study of such subjects 
should be used. 

The spirit of enquiry should be welcomed, stimulated 
and fostered. The aim of the teacher at this period
