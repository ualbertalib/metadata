ABSTRACT 


The recent drilling of a number of deep 
wells has supplied the first* direct* information 
regarding the nature of the Precambrian under 
the central plains of Alberta, This thesis 
sets forth the results of the petrographic, 
analysis and., interpretation of Precambrian 
cores from twenty-eight wells. Granite and 
granodiorite are the roost common rock types.. 
Syenite, diorite, gabbro, rhyolite porphyry, 
schist and hydrothermally altered rock are 
also represented in the samples. Structural 
determinations cannot be. made at present with 
any degree of certainty.

Hocks of JHre Cambrian age are expo sea at. the surface over 
only a small part of the province of Alberta* Of the vast area of 
the Canaaian Shield only 6,000 square miles lie in north-eastern 
Alberta. In the Waterton Lakes area, and at various points in the 
western ranges of the Rocky Mountains, sedimentary and volcanic 
strata of Precambrian age have been thrust up by late Mesozoic 
faulting* The structure of the Precambrian basement underlying 
the great area between these outcrops has been inferred from the 
dips of the overlying formations and their estimated thicknesses* 
It is only in the past four years that the deep wells completed 
in the process of the extensive oil exploration program have pro¬ 
vided any significant amount of direct information* 

In October, 1950, samples were obtained from 30 of the 
40 wells reported to have reached the Precambrian* The study of 
this material had two objectives* The first object was to make 
petrographic descriptions of the available cores* Based on these 
descriptions an attempt could then be made to interpret the struc¬ 
ture of the Precambrian in those areas where a number of wells had 
been drilled in reasonable proximity. 

HRlViauS WORK 

While no comprehensive report on the subsurface Pre¬ 
cambrian of Alberta has been published to date, a number of refer¬ 
ences have been made to samples examined in the process of logging 
core* The earliest wells for which records are available are in 
the Me Murray area* Here the Precambrian occurs at a relatively

shallow depth and is directly overlain by commercial deposits of rock 
salt, interbedded with anhydrite* In 1910 the Do* 2 well of the 
iNlortnern Alberta Exploration Company was drilled in the KE-fc of 17-89- 
9-W. of IT* Hard red rock, which was logged as possible Precarnbrian, 
was encountered at a depth of 1159 feet, (l) 

Athabasca Oils Limited in 1912 drilled a well on the east 
bank of the Athabasca River approximately twenty miles below Port 
McKay* The depth to the contact between the sedimentary formations 
and the Precarnbrian was 1105 feet* A gold assay of $13 per ton was 
reported for the rock on the contact* (2) 

The only early well for which an accurate log and core 
samples of Precarnbrian were available was the Alberta Government Ho* 

2 Sait Well, drilled in 1923* A complete log and a brief description 
of the granite core are given by Allan’ (3)* The core from this well 
was stored for many years in the Department of Geology at the Univer¬ 
sity of Alberta* A petrographic description of the Precarnbrian core 
was made in 1947 by MacDonald* (4) 

In 1928- the Weymarn Do* 1 well in 16-89-3-W* IT was drilled 
to a depth of 495* The lowest samples were described as ^possibly a 
detrital zone over the Precarnbrian*** (A) 

The exploration program in Turner Talley, in southwestern 
Alberta, gave no record of the Precarnbrian of the area, as the base-

ment was considerably below the sedimentary strata drilled at that 
time. Prior to the discovery of the Leduc field in 1947 only two 
wells had been drilled to Brecambrian in central and southern Al¬ 
berta. In 1940 the G.P.R. Princess Bo* 1 well was drilled by Cali¬ 
fornia Standard Oil Company in 13-22-20-12-W. of IV* Core samples 
and a thin section of the BreCambrian, penetrated at a depth of 
6147 feet, are filed in Miscellaneous Collection Bo. 1 In the De¬ 
partment of Geology. Imperial Provost Bo. 2, drilled in 1946, re¬ 
corded Precambrian at a depth of 6968 feet. Bo samples of this 
core were available. The core was described by HcGehee (2) as a 
pinkish white granite* 

The extensive exploration program initiated after the dis¬ 
covery of the Leduc field provided the material which made this 
study possible. Data for these more recent wells are given in tables 
in Chapter II of this paper. 

The study of the Precambrian exposed at the surface in Al¬ 
berta has been rather limited. Id important mineral deposits nave 
been discovered in the portion of the Canadian Shield lying within 
the province. The other areas of Brecambrian lie within the nat¬ 
ional parks. While an extended discussion of these areas is beyond 
the scope of this paper, a brief description of the lithology will 
be given.

RELATE!) STUDIES 


Petrographic studies of the "basement samples in West 
Texas have been published by Patton, (l) and (2). Samples from 
nineteen wells were examined and quantitative studies made wher¬ 
ever possible. Mineralogical analyses were made, using an im¬ 
proved Wentworth recording micrometer. The- modes of the rocks 
were computed according to the Rosiwal method* The rocks were 
then classified according to Johannsen 1 s system of quantitative 
mineralogical classification*

Chapter II PETROLOGY 


The fundamental purpose of this study, as outlined in the 
introduction (p*l), was the preparation of petrographic descriptions 
of the available Precambrian cores, (Appendix Bj* In the present 
chapter related rock types are grouped together for comparative pur¬ 
poses* The basis of division into groups is twofold; areal and petro¬ 
graphic* 

Wells drilled to the Precambrian basement are widely scattered 
over the province, but show concentration in certain areas* For the 
descriptive purposes of this chapter three areas are outlined, as shown 
in Figure 1. These areas will be referred to as: 

A* the Mcltoray area* 

B*. the Peace River area. 

C* the Edmonton area* 

Imperial Crossroads Ho* 1, in northwestern Alberta, will be discussed 
with the Peace River area. The wells in southeastern Alberta will he 
considered with the Edmonton area* 

The Precambrian drill cores are classified as: 

Intrusive Rocks and Metamorphie Equivalents* 

1* Alkali Granite 
2 * Biotite and Hornblende Granite 
5* Granodiorite and Tonalite 
4* Syenite 

5* Diorite and Gabbro 
Extrusive Rocks- 

6 * Rhyolite Porphyry. 

Sedimentary Rocks* 


7* Schist

The locations and depths of wells in the Me Mur ray area are 
shown in figure 2. Data for the wells are given in Table 1. Of the 
wells listed, eight were drilled by the Bear Oil Company in 1948 and. 
iy49* Core samples of igneous rock are available from five of these 
we11s. Samples of the detrital zone overlying the Precarabrian are 
available from two others* The other four wells listed were drilled 
at a considerably earlier date* Samples and accurate data are avail¬ 
able only from the Alberta Government Do* 2 Salt 'fell* The remain¬ 
ing three wells are included for the purpose of extending the con¬ 
tours drawn on the surface of the Precambrian* 

The samples studied may be classified as either alkali 
granite or normal granite* A discussion of the various wells is 
given below* Following the name of the well the depth of the sample 
and the number of the slide are given* The descriptive classification

depth of 2850 feet, shows very little garret. The second sample was 
classed as a granite. The considerable variation occurring in a re¬ 
latively short distance, together with the composition and texture 
of the rock, suggest that it may he a pegmatitic intrusive.

Pegmatitic Granite (226P, Granite}* 

This sample is generally similar to the 2860 ft. sample 
hut contains very little garnet and considerably more biotite* The 
grain size is also somewhat coarser, with feldspar crystals up to 
20 mm* in size. The high quartz content and the texture indicate 
a pegmatitic source. (See previous paragraph). 

-Bear Va mpire fq» 1 , 2302 feet, 50-47 
ferruginous Granite (226 P, Granite) 

This sample presents a number of features which are common 
lo most of the cores from the Me Mirray area* The sample has a deep 
reddish color, due to the presence of a considerable amount of hema¬ 
tite. The rock is coarse^ granular, with feldspar crystals up to 
10 mm. The distribution of the mafic constituents gives the rock a 
somewhat gneissic appearance. 

Microscopic examination reveals that the feldspar crystals 
are highly fractured. The quartz grains show sutured contacts and 
undulatory extinction* llyrmekitic and perthitic intergrowths mar¬ 
ginal to the orthoclase crystals are very pronounced* 

The content of iron oxides is greater than would normally 
De expected in a rock of granitic composition. The hign iron con¬ 
tent may be attributed to one or more of the following factors:

(i) an abundance of primary magnetite 

(ii) the alteration of hornblende and biotite 

(iii) the introduction and subsequent oxidation of pyrite 

(iv) the introduction of magnetite. 

The author considers it probable that at least part, if 
not all, of the magnetite is primary. Oxidation of this magnetite 
under normal surface conditions would produce hematite* 

The alteration of the ferromagnesian constituents of the 
rock is also a possible source of hematite. The absence of horn¬ 
blende and the relatively small amount of biotite present support 
this concept. The total destruction of hornblende while biotite 
still remains is in accordance with the stability series suggested 
by Goldich (l). The fact that the salic minerals, as a group, are 
more stable than the mafic minerals would account for the relative¬ 
ly slight alteration of the feldspars. 

The presence of gypsum as a fracture filling indicates 
that meteoric waters circulated through the rock during or after 
the deposition of the overlying evaporite beds. These meteoric waters 
might have been responsible for the introduction of hematite, derived 
from the overlying detrital zone. 

Pyrite is present in some quantity in the Precambrian core 
from tne Alberta Government ITo. 2 Salt Well* The introduction and. 
subsequent oxidation of pyrite is a possible source of the hematite 
in the core from Bear Vampire 2To. 1* However, no pyrite was found, 
in the thin-section or core to substantiate this theory.

In composition and texture the two rocks are nearly identical* There 
seems to be little doubt that they are part ol' the same intrusive 
mass •. 

Alberta Government llo* 2 . Salt Well, 789 feet 
Pyritized Granite (226 P, Granite) 

The rock is medium gray in color with a conspicuous amount 
of pyrite along the fractures. The freshness of the pyrite Is in 
marked contrast to the cores of the adjacent wells, which show ex¬ 
tensive oxidation* This is also the only well in the area in which 
pyrite is dominant over magnetite. The freshness of the pyrite may 
be explained by r 

(i) a local reducing environment at the time of introduction of the 
pyrite * 

(ii) a lack of deep leaching at this particular location* 

(iii) a much later date of pyritization, possibly post-Precambrian* 

An examination of the core for the interval from 784 to 
78b feet (tauseum Specimen j$C* 4 } showed, no oxidation at the contact 
between the granite and the overlying detrital zone• Fresh pyrite 
was visible one-quarter of an inch below the contact* The detrital 
zone above the contact consisted of angular fragments of quartz and 
feldspar, rock fragments, and a few grains of garnet. The matrix 
consisted of gypsum* A few of the rock fragments showed rusty spots 
where pyrite had been oxidized. On the whole, the detrital zone 
shows little discoloration due to the presence of iron oxide. There 
is no evidence of the Introduction of pyrite after the formation of 
the aetrital zone. The freshness of the pyrite in the sample from

a depth of 789 I'eet is attributed by the writer to a reducing en¬ 
vironment at the time of introduction and. lack of deep leaching* 

Several small clusters of red garnet are visible in the 
hand specimen. The only other cores in the McMurray area contain¬ 
ing gax*net are those from hear hi It mo re Ho. 1. Whether any gene¬ 
tic relationship between the samples from the two wells can be in¬ 
ferred is a matter open to question. 

An examination of the llfiin-sect ion reveals strong evidence 
of extensive deformation. The quartz shows undulatory extinction 
and sutured- contacts. The feldspars are fractured* Mortar struc¬ 
ture is common. The resistance of feldspar to crushing has pro¬ 
duced a parphyroclastic texture, visible in the hand specimen* 
Several large feldspar crystals remain among the finer crushed 
material.

The core showed a perfect cleavage parallel to the axis 
of the core. Examination revealed that the cleavage plane was a 
fracture cemented with gypsum. The fracture was probably a joint¬ 
ing plane. 

The polished section of this rock revealed well developed 
augen structure. The auger; consist mainly of flattened feldspar 
crystals, with some associated quartz. Intensive cataclastic de¬ 
formation has produced this structure, (l)

The high magnetite content of the rock is of interest* 

Part of the magnetite occurs as a filling for fractures in the 
feldspars. At least part of the magnetite must therefore be post- 
deformational in age. 

The high content of hematite has been discussed at length 
in connection with the Bear Vampire Ho. 1 well.

Ferruginous Augen Gneiss (226P, Granite) 

There is no fundamental difference between the cores from 
Bear w'est mount Ho. 2 and Bear West mount Ho. 1. The core from the 
Fo. 1 well shows the same augen structure, dark reddish color due 
to high hematite content and post-deformational magnetite. The 
mineralogical composition is similar with respect to quarts, felds¬ 
par ana biotite. In both cores apatite and zircon are abundant 
accessories. 

dear Vanin ir e I To.» 2 , 883 feet, 50-49 
Arkose. 

The sample of core from the bottom of this well appar¬ 
ently represents the detrital zone overlying the Precambrian. The 
main clastic constituents of the rock are angular grains of quartz: 
and feldspar, and rock fragments. Considerable hematite is pre¬ 
sent, as indicated by the reddish color of the core. The matrix be¬ 
tween the fragments consists of clay minerals, essentially kaollnlte. 
The whole aggregate has been cemented with gypsum. Crystals of 
gypsum occur in the core.

Summary of the :~Ciurray Area 

1 * All of the Precambrian cores examined are igneous rock of* gra¬ 
nitic composition. Sedimentary or volcanic rocks of Precambrian 
age may occur in the area but their presence has not been confirmed 
to date. 

2 , Two of the cores show little alteration. The other four cores 
show marked evidence of oxidation, 

3 . All cores show evidence of deformation at moderate or shallow 

is 

depths. Gataclastic metamorphism dominant, with little evidence 
of recrystallisation,

The Peace -liver Area 

The locations and depths of wells in the Peace River area 
are given in Figure 3- Data for the wells are given in Table 2* 

All of the wells listed were drilled in 1949 and 1950* Surface 
elevations and depths of Precambrian are not released for many of 
the wells* Estimated elevations, given in Table 2, are based on 
topographic maps of the area. The depth of the surface of the Pre¬ 
cambrian is taken as approximately equal to the total depth of the 
well* Approximations made on this basis are indicated in Table 2. 

Samples of Precambrian were available from all wells 
except Imperial Wembley ho. 1. A wide variety of igneous rocks, 
as well as a metamorphosed sedimentary rock, are represented in 
the samples* 

1* Alkali Granite * 

Imperial Clairmont ho* 1 , 11,700 feet, 50-6, 50-52 A and B* 
Granite (115 P, Kalialaskite)* 

The core from this well is unique in this collection in 
that it shews a sharp contact between two rock types* Part - of the 
core is a coarsely crystalline igneous rock, dark greenish gray in 
color* The remainder of the core is fragmental and dark reddish 
brown in color* 

The igneous portion of the core consists almost entirely 
of orthoclase and quartz* The feldspar crystals are fractured but 
show little alteration to hematite or kaolinite*

vided a localized channel for a very fluid basic intrusive* The 
margins of the fracture are no longer sharply defined, due to the 
development of myrmekitic intergrowths. The intrusive was of gab- 
broic composition, with magnetite and pyrite as common accessory 
minerals. The labradorite of the gabbro is extensively kaolinizea. 

The fragmental rock consists of orthoclase and quartz, 
with a considerable amount of hematite and kaolinite. A series of 
fractures has-- developed parallel to the contact with the crystal¬ 
line rock* The fractures are filled with quartz, calcite and chal- 
copyrite* 

The fragmental rock may represent the detrital zone over- 
lying the Thecambrian. If this concept is adopted the quartz, cal¬ 
cite and chalcopyrite may be attributed to cold meteoric solutions* 

| (1). The presence of a basic intrusive suggests another possibility. 

| The fragmental material may represent a fault breccia* The fault 
would provide a suitable locality for the intrusion of a basic dyke. 

- Late emanations associated with the dyke would account for the pre- 
| sence of the quartz, calcite and chalcopyrite, which seem to be 
later than the basic magma*

Gneissic Hornblende Granite (226 P, Granite) 

This rock is only slightly more basic than the granite from 
Imperial Tangent. The two samples could readily represent part of 
the same intrusive mass. 

The distinctive feature of the Whitelaw granite is the in¬ 
tensive deformation recorded in the rock. The feldspar crystals are 
fractured,, with displacement evident along the fracture planes. The 
quartz has been almost completely granulated, assuming a lenticular 
shape. The arrangement of the quartz around the larger feldspars 
gives a distinctive augen structure. The lack of recrystallization 
indicates deformation at shallow to moderate depth. (1)

Hornblende Biotite Granodiorite (227P, Granodiorite ) 

This sample presents few features not normal to this type 
of rock. The hornblende has been altered in part to epidote, visible 
in the hand specimen. The hematite occurring in the orthoclase, to¬ 
gether with the quartz and Hornblende, give the rock a red, white 
and black mottled appearance. A small amount of pyrite is dissemi¬ 
nated through the rock*

Gneissoid Hornblende Granodiorite (227P, Granodiorite) 

The core from this well is distinctive in that it is the 
only well-banded gneiss in the collection* The bands vary from 2 to 
5 mm* in width. The banding may be metamorphic in origin but the 
author considered it to be a primary igneous feature. Oataclastic 
deformation was notably absent in the thin section examined* There 
was also little evidence of recrystallization* The epidote is attri¬ 
buted to denteric action rather than metamorphism* The presence of 
kaolinite, hematite and leucoxene supports this interpretation*

Biotite Hornblende Gneiss (227 P, Granodiorite) 

The core from imperial Lalby possesses certain features 
which identify it with cores from Stanolind Grimshaw Ho* 1 and Shell 
Kunaway Lake Ho* 1* These three cores are distinguished from all 
other cores in the area by the fact that the rock consists of two 
phases. The acid phase forms lenticular bodies enclosed in the 
more mafic phase* The acid phase in the Lalby well consists of 
quartz, orthoclase and oiigoclase. The basic phase is oligoclase, 
biotite, hornblende and quartz, with minor amounts of potash feld¬ 
spar. The biotite occurs as large, well-formed flakes, showing 
marked orientation parallel to the major axes of the lenticular bodies. 

In appearance the sample resembles an injection gneiss* 
However, the lenticular rather than ribbon-like shape of the acid

constituents suggests another origin* Composite and hybrid gneisses 
are explained by barker (l) as follows: 

spoliation in igneous gneisses arises partly from inter¬ 
nal movement, which may be discontinuous, under the influence of 
great differential stress, partly by segregation due to molecular 
diffusion* the latter emphasizing and exaggerating- the effects of 
the former. Gneissic banding, i.e. the alternation of distinct 
lithological types in parallel bands, streaks and lenticles, has 
a different origin* It results from the drawing out in fluxional 
fashion of a mass which was already of a heterogeneous nature* 

The necessary conditions for the setting up of a prolonged gneissic 
Danaing are realized in a plutonic complex. Here heterogeneity 
arises, not as in the former case from incomplete differentiation 
in a single body of magma, but from partial intermingling of dis¬ 
tinct rock-types. An earlier (normally a more basic) rock >; already 
solidified, is invaded by a later (more acid) magma, which sends 
veins into it. The veins branch and anastomose, and in this way 
fragments of the older rock become detached and, enveloped by the 
new magma, may be further broken up* This mechanical process is 
complicated both by simple metamorphism of the older rock and by 
chemical reaction between the two rock types, giving rise to hybrid 
products of* intermediate composition* Cooling being gradual, a 
considerable time must elapse before the complex mass, becomes too 
rigid to yield to deformation; and, if during this time it is

forced into flowing motion, it will take on the character of a 
group of banded gneisses*"' 

This concept would seem to present an explanation of 
all of the features of the cores from Imperial Laiby, Stanolina 
Grimshaw and Shell Runaway Lake* The dominance of biotite in the 
first two mentioned cores could be accounted for by late magmatic 
alteration of hornblende and augite* in the Shell Runaway Lake 
core hornblende and augite are still dominant over biotite* Appar¬ 
ently less acid magma was involved, as the rock is still of dior- 
itic composition*

ionalite Gneiss (228 P, Tonalite ) 

The core from this well is somewhat more basic than that 
from imperial lalby. The theory of origin outlined above is sub¬ 
stantiated by the unaltered cores of ferromagnesian mineral which 
occur in the centers of crystals of epidote* There is little evi¬ 
dence of cataclastie deformation* la mineralization is apparent*

4* Syenite 

Imperial ngrmandville ko* 1 , 7 424 feet, 50-61 
Gneissic Syenite* (2110F, Sodaclase-Syenite). 

The composition of this rock serves to place it in a 
category by itself* In other respects, however, It has much in 
common with the core from Imperial Tangent* In both of these 
wells the cores show the effects of strain and hydrothermal al¬ 
teration * 

The Dan-section of the Eormandville syenite shows highly 
fractured feldspars with warped twinning. Foliation is not well 
developed but is suggestive of gneissic banding. All of the pri¬ 
mary mafics have been altered to chlorite and epidote. The al- 
bite is highly kaolinized. Hematite occurs in fractures and as 
a coating on magnetite* 

5* Dior ite and Gabbro 

Shell Kunaway hake ho* 1 , 6071 - 6077 feet, 50-68 and 50-69* 
Dlorite Gneiss (2212 P, Biorite}*, 

This core bears a strong resemblance in texture and 
structure to those from Imperial Lalby ana Stanolind Grimshaw. A 
full discussion of the origin of these structures is given in the 
description of Imperial lalby* 

The mineralization of this rock is of interest* Pyrr¬ 
ho cite and chaicopyrite occur disseminated through the basic part 
of the rock* Several bands of sulphide also occur, paralleling 
the general alignment of the mafic constituents* The sulphides 
should probably be considered primary* (1) The presence of sirl-

A large myrmekitic intergrowth has replaced

alteration. Hornblende forms a large part 
of the rock. SOX. 











phiaes in only the mafic part of the rock would seem to substan¬

later acid magma. 

Bacii i c St. Germain ho* 1 , 5 589 feet, 50-39 and 50-40 
hornblende C-abbro (2311 P, Syenogabbro ). 

Apart from the fact that this rock is the only one in 
the collection with feldspar more basic than AbbO An50, if possesses 
few unusual features. There is no mineralization apparent. The 
feldspar is fairly fresh, although there has been patchy hydro- 
tnermal alteration to kaoiinite, paragonite and epidote. 

The medium grain size may indicate a dyke rock. The 
absence of a diabasic texture could be explained bjr the fact that 
plagioclase makes up less than the eutectic proportion of the 
rock* (1J

Quartz. Sericite Schist. 

This rock resembles the mica schists commonly exposed 
on the Canadian Shield. Although sericite is the dominant mica, 
with a lesser amount of biotite, the specimen does not show the 
perfect cleavage characteristic of a phyllite * The aggregates of 
mica are commonly bent, indicating deformation during or after re¬ 
crystallization.

An arenaceous snaie probably constituted the original 
rock from which the schist was derived, ho garnets are visible in 
the nand specimen or thin-section» The rock is tentatively assigned 
to tne biotite-zone of metamorphism* (l) 

The kaolinite and hematite in the specimen probably re¬ 
sulted from the weathering of feldspar and magnetite during the 
post-HTecarabrian interval, when the schist was exposed on the sur¬ 
face. The orthoclase, oligoclase, magnetite, zircon and apatite 
are considered to be primary detrital minerals.

Imperial Kathleen ho* 1, 7857 feet, 00-58. 

Hydrothermally Altered Diorite (?) 

The original com|)osition of this rock has been totally 
obscured by alteration. The rock now consists almost entirely of 
fine-grained quartz and epidote* The epilate occurs mainly as 
massive, granular aggregates but a few euhedral crystals have 
formed. The quartz is finely granular but shows little evidence 
of strain* 

The rock may be of metamorphic origin, in which case it 
would be called an “epidosite* 1 2 ! darker (2) considers such rocks to 
be rare, and attributes most quartz-epidote rocks to alteration* 

Tne core from Imperial Kathleen probably represents the hydrother- 
mally altered equivalent of a diorite or gabbro*

Plato XIX. 

Imperial Kathleen No. 1, 50-58. 

Hydro thermally Altered.. Dior! to (?). 

The well-formed crystals, are secondary epidote. 
Some epidote is massive and-fine-grained. The 
remainder of the rock is quartz. 75X. 


Plate XX. 

Imperial Crossroads No. 1, 50-56. 

Hornblende Granodiorite. 

A large crystal of. oligoclase shows partial 
alteration to secondary mica and kaolinito. 
The twinning appears to be slightly warped. 
Biotito and,quartz are the other minerals 
visible in the photograph. 30X« 



























There are few special features to note in connection 
witii this sample* The grain size is somewhat coarser than the 
average for the Peace River area. The composition presents no 
anomalies. Mineralization consists of disseminated pyrite, and 
calcite filling fractures in the rock. Deformation has been 
moderate but no obvious foliation has developed. There has been 
limited alteration of the feldspars. The mafic constituents are 
unaltered. it is reasonably certain that this core represents 
the unaltered Precarabrian basement. 

Summary of the Peace River Area * 

1* A wide range of igneous rocks is represented in the samples. 
The acid igneous rocks, with the exception of the core from Shell 
IhA. ,/hitelaw, are massive. The intermediate igneous rocks are 
typically gneissic. 

id. The only sedimentary rock so far revealed by deep drilling in 
Alberta occurs in Imperial Grouard Ho. 1, in the southeast part 
of the Peace River area. 

3. Trie core from Imperial Kathleen Ho. 1 is interpreted as a 
hydrotnermally altered basic igneous rock.

The Edmonton Area 

The Preearnbrian petrology of the Edmonton area presents 
greater difficulty than that of the Murray or of the Peace .liver 
area. In the Edmonton area only six cores are available. The wells 
are wiaely spaced, the closest two being some twenty-five miles 
apart. The three cores from widely scattered points in southeastern 
Alberta cannot be related directly to those in the Edmonton group. 

The locations of wells drilled to Precambrian in the Ed¬ 
monson area are shown in -figure 4. Data for these wells, and tnose 
drilled in southeastern Alberta, are given in Table 3. 

!♦ Alxali Granite 

Imperial Ardrossan Ho. 1 , 7 800 feet, 48-24. 

Muscovite Granite (ll6P, AlaskiteJ. 

This rock was originally a muscovite~biotite granite. The 
alteration of the biotite to chlorite has given a greenish color 
to the sample. Alteration of the feldspars to kaolinite and sen- 
cite is very noticeable. The sample shows a quarter-inch quartz: 
vein. Hydrothermal alteration may have been due to hot solutions 
v/hich circulated through this fracture before the quarts vein was 
formed. 

imperial Plain hake Ho. 1. 6437 feet, 30-621. 

Muscovite Granite (117P, Leuco-Sodaclase-Granodiorite}. 

The highly acid nature of this rock is indicated by the 
large, well-formed flakes of muscovite. A small amount of garnet 
also occurs. Alteration has not been so extensive as in the Ardro¬ 
ssan core. Ho mineralisation is apparent in the sample. Defor¬ 


mation has been sufficient to produce warped tYfinning and frac-

Biotite Granite (116?, Alaskite) 

Biotite is a rather minor varietal mineral in this core. 

In ooth color and texture the rock is entirely different from the 
cores of Imperial Ardrossan ana Plain Lake* The fresh surface pre¬ 
sents a somewhat foliated appearance, related not so much to the 
biotite as to the felsic constituents. There are numerous evidences 
of stress* The lenticular shape of some of the quartz grains may 
contribute to the apparent foliation* 

The biotite shows considerable alteration to chlorite* 

The feldspars are relatively fresh* Lack of hematite associated 
with the orthoclase probably accounts for the light color* 

Pyrite is a minor constituent of the veins formed in 
narrow fractures* Quartz, calcite and albite are the most common 
fracture fillings* 

2* normal Granite 

Lone of the samples were classified as a normal granite 
(as contrasted with an alkalic granite), although the Darling

The composition of this rock is rather unusual in that 
andesine is combined with a fairly large percentage of quartz and 
orthoclase* Hornblende is not present in the thm-sect ion. Bio-

The texture of the rock is gneissic, with the hiotite 
flakes showing noticeable alignment.

The striking features of this core are the high content 
of hornblende and the almost complete alteration of plagioclase to 
secondary mica. The hornblende occurs, for the most part, as euhe- 
dral and subhedral crystals. Corrosion of the hornblende is common* 
Alteration to epidote and biotite has been slight. The feldspars 
show twinning only in small, unaltered patches* Practically all 
of the andesine has been altered to paragonite and kaoUnite. 

Several fractures in the core have been filled by cal¬ 
otte veins, with minor amounts of pyrite*

Garnetiferous Propylite. 

The nature of the original igneous or sedimentary rock 
from which this rock was derived has been totally obscured by sub¬ 
sequent hydrothermal alteration. The amount of garnet is rather 
greater than would normally be found in an igneous rock. if the 
garnet is the product of metamorphism of a sedimentary rock, the 
chlorite should have been altered to biotite. A metamorphosed sedi¬ 
mentary rock containing feldspar should also contain quartz, ho 
quartz was observed in the thin-section. On the whole, the con¬ 
cept of a hydrothermally altered igneous rock seems to be the most 
plausible. More positive identification of the primary ferro- 
magnesian mineral may provide a better clue to the source.

The determination of structural relationships in areas 
of highly metamorphosed rocks presents certain difficulties. in 
some parts of the Canadian Shield detailed field work has been 
necessary to establish accurate structural concepts. Even in those 
areas mapped on a scale of four miles to the inch, several field 
seasons are normally required to cover some 4,000 square miles of 
territory* 

The main structural data acquired by the field worker 
are the strikes and dips of the sedimentary formations, the nature 
of the contacts between sedimentary and intrusive rocks and bet¬ 
ween different intrusives* in the present study all such data 
are lacking. The core from imperial Grouard, the only well in 
which a sedimentary formation was penetrated, revealed few fea¬ 
tures from which a strike or dip could be determined* In most 
of tne deep wells drilled core samples were, obtained from, only a few 
feet of the -recambrian basement. The possibility of encounter¬ 
ing a contact between sedimentary and intrusive rocks in the 
limited depth of hrecambrian penetrated is very slight* For these 
reasons, mapping on a basis similar to that used by surface workers 
has not been attempted. Mapping of the subsurface Irecambrian 
of Alberta in any detail will be possible only when a great many 
more wells have been drilled* 

The structural interpretations made in this chapter are 
based on three fundamental concepts*

(x) In areas without marked regional relief a prolonged period of 
erosion will produce local relief based on the relative stability 
of tne different rock types* 

lii) Along the mobile shelf bordering a continental block an ex¬ 
tensive mass of igneous rock may act as a positive area during 
times of tectonic instability* 

(iii) Over relatively short distances igneous rocks of similar 
composition and. texture may be considered as part of the same in¬ 
trusive mass* 

The possible errors arising from the application of this 
last concept are great, but such an approach provides the only 
oasis for making structural interpretations* 

The idea of local relief as a criterion of relative rock 
stability has considerable support from observations made on the 
Canadian Shield. Tracts of low-lying land, underlain by sedi¬ 
mentary schists are common. Acid igneous intrusives often form 
low ridges, and in some cases hills of considerable height* Other 
prominent ridges may be composed of metamorphosed volcanic rocks, 
it seems fairly certain that the pre-glacial relief of the Cana¬ 
dian Shield was considerably greater than that at present. it 
is quite possible that the raiaeosoic sedimentary strata weve de¬ 
posited on a surface showing fairly marked local relief. Once 
buried, local surface features are likely to be preserved. 

The local relief of the subsurface Precambrian becomes 
apparent only when several wells, are drilled close together. In 
the Mcxiurray area the Alberta Government Ho. 2 Salt fell is four

and one-half miles west of Bear Westmount No* 2. The regional 
strike of the unconformity between the Erecambrian and the over- 
lying Palaeozoic strata is N. 40° Tf* The average dip is 22 feet 
per mile to the southwest* u n the basis of the regional dip the 
unconformity should be approximately 100 feet lower at Alberta Govt* 
Ho. 2 Salt ./ell than at Bear West mount' No. 2* The actual eleva¬ 
tions (M.S1L. ) are + 25 feet and - 75 feet respectively* The exis¬ 
tence of a local high appears to bear some relation to the fresh¬ 
ness of the granite in the Salt Well core, as compared to the 
highly oxidized granite in cores from adjacent wells. Whether the 
freshness is responsible for the high, or whether the reverse is 
the case, is open to question. 

In the Weace Elver area two Imperial Oil Company wells, 
hormandville and Lalby, are three miles apart. Here the differ¬ 
ence in elevation of more than 300 feet seems to bear a direct re¬ 
lation to the rock types. The high area adjacent to Hormandville 
is an alkalic syenite. The Lalby core is a gneissic biotite grano- 
diorite. The high content of biotite would render this rock highly 
susceptible to weathering. 

The use of local relief as a criterion of rock stability 
appears to be substantiated in the case of the Normandville syenite 
body. The evidence in the area adjacent to the Alberta Govern¬ 
ment No. 2 Salt Well is inconclusive* 

Correlations of regional structural features with specific 
igneous rock types are generally unsound. However, certain assemb- 






37 


lages of igneous rock may be suggestive of such major structures. 

In figure 6 the distribution of wells in Alberta drilled to Pre- 
carabrian has been plotted, together v/ith the rock type as deter¬ 
mined from core samples* 

Contours drawn on the unconformity between the Precambrian 
and the Palaeozoic reflect the presence of certain structural highs 
ana basins. in southeastern Alberta the Sweetgrass arch is a promi¬ 
nent positive area. The Edmonton salient is partially obscured on 
the contour map by the regional dip to the southwest. A positive 
area in the vicinity of Peace River is also rather poorly revealed 
on the contour map of the Precambrian - Palaeozoic unconformity. 

The existence of a positive area during early Palaeozoic 
time, coinciding in part with the present Peace liver structural 
high, is indicated on the isopach map of the Silurian and Middle 
Devonian prepared, by /ebb (l). The subsequent sinking of this 
positive area is indicated by the thickness of the overlying Mis si- 
ssippian strata. 

When Webb's isopach map of the Silurian and Middle Devon¬ 
ian is used as a base for plotting the distribution of Precambrian 
rock types, {Figure bj a highly suggestive pattern is evident. The- 
distribution of rock types suggests a large igneous complex, domi¬ 
nantly basic at its periphery and becoming more acid tov/ard its 
core. The samples from Shell Runaway Lake, and. possibly Imperial 
Kathleen, are placed in the outer basic zone. Closer to the center, 
such wells as Imperial haiby, Magloire, Spirit River and Stanolina

Grirnshaw yield samples of intermediate composition. The central 
acid core is made up of rocks such as are found in imperial Cl&ir- 
mont, Tangent, Normandville and Shell B.A. V/hitelaw. The pro¬ 
gression from a more basic margin to an acid core may be related 
to differentiation in a large body of magma. 




CHAPTER IT. SU: l. '^u(Y Aii) CQHCLU oIOITS 


Ail of the information obtained during the preparation of 
this thesis supports the concept that the Precambrian underlying 
the central plains of Alberta is an extension of the Canadian Shield. 

A wide range of rock types is represented in the collec¬ 
tion of Precambrian cores. intrusive igneous rocks are the domi¬ 
nant group, quantitatively, comprising 24 of the 28 crystalline 
cores. Of the remaining 4 cores, one is of volcanic origin, one 
is a metamorphosed sedimentary rock, and two are hydrothermally 
altered rocks of uncertain origin. Within the intrusive igneous 
group the granites and granodiorites are dominant. Division on a 
petrographic basis is as follows: alkali granite, 6; normal granite, 
7; granodiorite and tonalite, 7syeni te , 1; diorlte and gab’oro, 6 ♦ 
Most of the samples examined showed marked evidence of 
metamorphism. The group of cores from the McMurray area showed 
evidence of intense cataclastic deformation* The gneissic band¬ 
ing of the intermediate and basic rocks of the Peace River area was 
! considered a primary magmatic feature. 

The structural concepts developed in this thesis are based 
jon the material available to the writer. The large scale explora- 
1 tion program currently being carried on in the Peace River area 
swill provide many new samples. inforrnation derived from these 
samples may substantiate or disprove the concepts presented in this 
thesis. The author feels that a continued study of the subsur¬ 
face PreCambrian of Alberta is merited.

APPENDIX. A, COLOR.PHOTOMICROGRAPHY . 


A aeries of thirty photomicrographs in color was prepared 
to illustrate this thesis. It was the original intention of the 
author to include color prints of these photomicrographs in the 
manuscript. After considerable experimentation it became evident 
that- the production of color prints of high fidelity was extreme¬ 
ly difficult with the materials available at present. The high 
cost prohibited- the inclusion of a large number of these prints. 
The. quality of- the positive color, transparencies was generally 
satisfactory. A set of thirty transparencies has been mounted 
in glass and is. filed, in the Department of Geology. 

All of the photographs v^ere. taken with a Leite Photomicro- 
graphic Apparatus, Model MA IVb, in conjunction with a Leite 
Polarizing Microscope, Model III M. The author, expended a con¬ 
siderable amount of time and money in determining the proper 
lighting source and exposure time. The following information 
is presented as a guide to those preparing color photomicro¬ 
graphs in the future. 

Film: Ansco Tungsten Color Film, 12.0 size. 

Nine exposures per roll were obtained.by using the 
Si x &£« mask in a Suydam Roll Film adapter. 

Filter: Ansco UV 16 filter. 

A Series VI filter was attached below the lower 
polarizer, replacing the diaphragm. 

Light Source: The- G volt, 6 ampere lamp attached to the apparatus 
was found to be satisfactory. The lamp was clamped

at the top of the standard.*, and. set as close as possible 
to the microscope. A piece of white frosted glass 
was inserted between the lamp and the mirror of the 
microscope. The concave side of the mirror was used.. 

Reflex attachment: The reflex focusing attachment was removed.. 

The ground glass was placed directly on top of the 
bellows. 

Bellows extension: Bellows extension was. measured from the 

lowest, part of the complete bellows assembly to the 
plane of the film. 

Exposure time: 

For a magnification of 40X the following, combination 
was satisfactory. Eyepiece, 5X; objective, 10X; 
bellows extension, S5 cm.; time, 15 to SO seconds. 

For low-power work (15X) the following combination 
was used. Eyepiece, 8X; objective, &.SX; bellows 
extension, 19 cm.; time, 6 to 8 seconds.

PECIAL FEATURES: 

P.M. A small cluster of dark red garnets, generally less than 1 m.m. 
in size, occurs in the hand specimen. None we re observed in the 
thin section. Plagioclase: Ng>C.B., Np=C.B. 

| L.M. The orthoclase commonly shows a microperthitic intergrowth of 

plagioclase. Myrmekitic intergrowths of quartz and plagioclase 
are common marginal to large orthoclase crystals. Large, rounded 
quartz inclusions occur in the orthoclase. 


Min. The pyrite forms thin films, filling the fractures in the rock. 


Met. The feldspars are extensively fractured, with mortar structure 

marginal to the porphyroclasts. The quartz shows sutured contacts 
and undulose extinction. Strain shadows are evident around the 
quartz inclusions in the large feldspar crystals. 

Alt. The feldspars are only slightly altered. There has been little 

oxidation of pyrite to hematite. The hornblende is highly corroded

SPECIAL FEATURES: 

The original nature of the rock has been almost totally obscured 
by subsequent hydrothermal alteration. The zoisite forms fine¬ 
grained masses. Kaolinite is present but is distinguished irom 
zoisite with difficulty. Garnet appears to be the most recently 
formed mineral. A ferromagnesian mineral, with the following 
properties, forms a small part of the rock. 

Pleochroism: Yellowish to greenish blue. Maximum birefringence: 
Low second order. Biaxially negative, with 2T approximately 
4b degrees.

SPECIAL FEATURES: 


P.m* Many of the plagioclase phenacrysts show zoning. Some phena- 
crysts are not zoned and have a composition Ab 9b. Metacrysts 
of orthoclase occur, but are not as common as plagioclase. 

'me matrix is felsitic. 


L.M. ihe cores of the more basic phenacrysts are highly corroded. 

Min. ho mineralization is apparent. 

met. There is little evidence of metamorphism. 

Alt. ihere has been extensive alteration of the feldspars. All of 
the mafic constituents have been altered to epidote.
