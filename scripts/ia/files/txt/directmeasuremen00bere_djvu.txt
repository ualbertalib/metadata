I. ABSTRACT 


Beginning in the fall of 1958 an investigation was 
undertaken to study the behaviour of the concrete pavement with 
reference to temperature changes. This experimental concrete 
strip consisting of unreinforced, reinforced and continuously 
reinforced concrete slabs was situated on the Trans-Canada. High¬ 
way in Bowness, near Calgary, Alberta. The depth of the slab 
varied from 6 to 8 inches and the steel percentage from 0 to 
0.815. 

Instrumentation was planned and installed in order to 
observe conditions at cracks in the reinforced and continuously 
reinforced concrete pavements . Measurements were made of the 
strain in the reinforcing steel and the accompanying crack widths 
at various slab temperatures encountered during the months of 
October 1958 to March 1959. 

The results of this investigation indicate that cracks 
in the interior section of the continuously reinforced concrete 
pavement opened to objectionable widths and the reinforcing steel 
spanning the cracks yields in tension due to a temperature drop 
varying from 50 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit. The temperature drop 
at which the reinforcing steel yielded in tension depended 
directly on the amount of longitudinal reinforcement. On the 
basis of the data obtained there is an indication that the pave¬ 
ment design should be based on the total area of the steel if yieldin 
of the steel is to be prevented at shrinkage cracks.

II. INTRODUCTION 

Up until the present time, highway departments in 
Western Canada, have favoured asphalt pavements on main high¬ 
ways because of economic considerations. However, recent 
developments in pavement technology suggest that certain 
types of concrete pavements may be used economically in some 
parts of the Province of Alberta. 

In 195^ the Alberta Department of Highways con¬ 
structed an unreinforced concrete test road just north of 
Calgary to evaluate the economics and merits of a rigid pave- 1 
ment. This program was continued in 1958 by the construction 
of a second test road composed of unreinforced, reinforced and 
continuously reinforced sections. This test road is a part of 
Highway No. 1, west of Calgary. 

Under the auspices of the Research Council of Alberta, 
the instrumentation of the test road was designed and installed. 
The instrumentation consisted of control points to measure hori¬ 
zontal and vertical movement of the slab, gage points to measure 
the width of instigated craxks, thermocouples to measure slab 
temperature and "SR-4" strain gages to measure strain in the 
reinforcing bars. 






Ill. HISTORICAL REVIEW 


(a) Plain Concrete 

The use of plain concrete for road surfaces dates 
back long before the beginning of the twentieth century. At 
the end of the nineteenth century plain concrete pavement was 
in existence both in Europe and the North American Continent. 
One of the earliest concrete pavements on record is that con¬ 
structed in Inverness, Scotland in 1865 . In North America 
there is a record of one which was constructed in Belle- 
fontaine, Ohio as early as 1892 . In Canada the earliest 
concrete pavement of which there is a record was that con¬ 
structed in Toronto in 1902. 

The early concrete pavements were laid in blocks 
ranging from 6 to 25 foot square with expansion joints ranging 

i (1 )* 

from ^ inch to 1 inch between blocks x 1 . 

The general practice until the late 1920*8 involved 

6 inch unreinforced concrete slab with both expansion and con¬ 
traction joints . Field performance and mathematical analysis 
of the stresses in concrete pavements under wheel loads made 
in the 1920 ! s showed that greatest stresses existed at the 
corners and edges of concrete panels. This finding led to 
development of designs with thickened edges such as 9 inch to 

7 inch to 9 inch, in which the slab was made 9 inches at the 

edges and 7 inches over the central portion. This type of 

design,however, was abandoned some years ago because of the 

increasing cost of preparing the base to take the slab of 

( 1 ) 

varying depth

The present practice in plain unreinforced concrete 
pavement involves uniform slab thickness which varies from 7 
to 10 inches in depth. 

(b) Reinforced Concrete with Closely Spaced Joints 

As a result of extensive research and experience in 
the field, reinforced concrete pavements came into use. These 
have increased in size to encompass 10 to 12 foot lane widths, 
lengths of 30 to 100 feet, the thickness of from 6 to 10 inches 
or more. Comparatively light reinforcing has been utilized as 
a means of fcieing the cracks in the pavement together and to 
give the pavement some flexural strength. 

The design of conventional reinforced concrete pave¬ 
ment with load transfer joints every 30 to 100 feet is based 
on the assumption that minor thermal cracking will occur between 

the joints, and that all deformations will take place at load 
(o) 

transfer joints v J . 

This form of construction, because of its increased 
resistance to damage, is superior to plain concrete, especially 
in regions where poor soils and low temperatures are encountered. 

(c) Continuously Reinforced Concrete Without Joints 

Although conventional reinforced pavement has given 
satisfactory service over the years, engineers connected with 
the road building industry felt that it was not the optimum 
that could be accomplished with reinforced concrete. Factors 
such as pumping, roughness and displacement at the joints, breaks 
and warping due to frost action and volumetric changes in the 
subsoil have become recognized as major deficiencies in the 
performance of the conventional reinforced pavement. 





4 


Several years ago it was suggested,on a theoretical 
basis, that if cracks which form were held tightly together, 
pavement cracking could be permitted to occur at any natural 
interval. However, sufficient reinforcement should be pro¬ 
vided to prevent the cracks opening to the extent which would 
permit pavement pumping and cause extreme strains in the steel 
due to vehicle loads . In the continuously reinforced concrete 
pavement, emphasis is transferred from the stress consideration 
and is placed on the relation between the strain in the steel 
and the width of the crack opening. 

The elimination of contraction and expansion joints 
and relative displacement at the cracks should give smoother 
riding qualities. Perhaps the most important advantage of such 
construction for the Province of Alberta could be the elimina¬ 
tion of spring road bans. 

Continuously reinforced concrete pavements have been 
constructed in the United States as experimental projects in 

New Jersey, California, Illinois, Indiana, Texas and Pennsyl-

IV. OBJECTIVES 


The objectives to be studied in this thesis may be 
stated as follows: 

1. To determine the maximum strains in the reinforcing 
steel, taking into account the varying percentages 

of reinforcement and varying thicknesses of pavement. 

2 . To determine the' effects of temperatures on the 
strains in the reinforcing steel. 

3. To determine the behaviour of the pavement at a crack 
by measuring the crack width and the strains in the 
steel. 

4. To determine strain in the reinforcing steel at points 
removed from the preformed crack. 

5. To determine the thermal effect on the width of the 


cracks.

V. THEORY 


6 


Theoretically, the behaviour of a continuously rein¬ 
forced concrete pavement is dependent upon three factors: The 
shrinkage of concrete; expansion and contraction caused by temp¬ 
erature; and strains induced by imposed external wheel loads. 

Shortly after concrete is poured it tends to contract 
due to capillary forces. This mechanism is commonly referred to 
as "shrinkage". In reinforced concrete pavement, the restraints 
offered by the bonded steel and the subgrade establish net tensile 
forces in the slab. When this tensile force reaches the magnitude 
of the rupture strength of the concrete, a shrinkage crack forms. 

The temperature mechanism of cracking for continuously 
reinforced concrete pavements is similar to shrinkage mechamism, 
except that the contraction of concrete is not caused by shrink¬ 
age but by the drop in temperature. For a given temperature 
drop, the total displacement of a slab resting on a subgrade will 
be less than for a free slab because of the subgrade restraint. 
Thus the magnitude of horizontal movement will depend not only on 
the coefficient of thermal expansion, but also on the friction 
which will be developed between the subgrade and pavement. With 
the drop in temperature the concrete will tend to contract. No 

restraint is offered by the steel whose coefficient of expansion 

( q ) 

or contraction is almost the same as that of concrete. How¬ 
ever, shearing forces mobilized between the subgrade and the 
pavement will tend to prevent any movement of the slab, thus 
causing tensile stresses to develop in the concrete pavement. 

The magnitude of these stresses will depend on the temperature 
drop and the subgrade restraint.

if j: ..:j 


- 




uu::, .. , , 






The distribution of stress in the concrete will start 
from zero at the free end and build up to a fully restrained 
value at some distance from the free end. At a point some distance 
away from the free end, at which the total frictional force be¬ 
comes larger than the potential tensile force of concrete, the 
slab will crack. It is assumed here that the steel takes no 
tension stress until the concrete cracks. This is a good assump¬ 
tion since the load taken by the steel just before the concrete 
cracks is small compared with that taken by the concrete slab. 

Once the crack develops, all the load is picked up by 
the steel, thus providing continuity of the pavement. Any tensile 
stress that develops in the steel at cracks must occur in the 
immediate vicinity of the crack. As a result, the reinforcing 
steel spanning each crack must either maintain the strain within 
its elastic limit by losing bond with the surrounding concrete, 
or yield in tension. 

Shrinkage and temperature induced straining are in 
operation to varying degrees of magnitude at all times. Initially, 
the shrinkage mechanism predominates, while at a later age, the 
temperature mechanism is the major one . Initially, all cracks 
are probably due to shrinkage. These cracks may well set the 
pattern of future behaviour (3).

Transverse reinforcing consisting of \ inch round 
bars were spaced at 23” in sections A-6, A-7, and A-8 and at 
30” in sections B7-1, B7-2, B6-1 and B6-2. 

The construction of the pavement was started in the 
first week of September, 1958 and, because of freezing tempera¬ 
tures, had to be stopped two months later in the first week of 
November. Six sections were completed in the fall of 1958, 
namely: Section A-6, B6-1, B6-2, B7-1, B7-2 and Section C. 
Sections A-7 and A-8 will be completed in the spring of 1959. 

Only sections A-6, B6-1, B6-2, B7-1 and B7-2 are dis¬ 
cussed here. A full discussion on Section C is to be presented 
in thesis entitled "Experimental Concrete Pavements in Alberta" 
by K. Ellert ^. 

The pavement was built on 4 inch granular base course 
throughout the length of the test road. 

Continuously Reinforced Concrete Pavement 

Thfe total length of the continuously reinforced pave¬ 
ment, comprising of Sections B6-1, B6-2, B7-1 and B7-2, is 
9,469 feet. 

At both ends of the continuously reinforced section 
finger type steel expansion dams were built (Figures 1 and 2). 

In Sections B6-1 and B6-2, the longitudinal reinforce¬ 
ment for each lane consisted of 14 and 16 No. 6 intermediate 
grade deformed steel bars resulting in 0 . 715 $ and 0.815$ cross- 
section area of the pavement respectively. In Sections B7-1 
and B7-2, longitudinal reinforcement for each lane consisted 
of 9 and 10 No. 8 intermediate grade deformed steel bars result¬ 
ing in a 0.706$ and 0.784$ cross-section area of the pavement 
respectively. 







'

i 











The longitudinal reinforcing bars were placed and 
tied to 2§ inch risers. The | inch transverse bars were laid 
on top and tied at every point the transverse bar crossed the 
longitudinal bar (Figure 3)• 

Special gages were installed in ten locations to 
facilitate the measurement of temperature and longitudinal 
strain in the vicinity of transverse pavement cracks at an 
artificially induced plane of weakness . 

Bakelite type "SR-4' T strain gages were attached to 
the surface of four of the longitudinal reinforcing bars at 
each location. These gages were located at the preformed cracks 
and at distances ranging from 18 to 40 diameters away from the 
crack. 

Thermocouples were placed at the same locations in 
the pavement to indicate local temperatures, and also to permit 
a study of the effects of vertical temperature gradation in the 
concrete slab. 

Steel gage points were installed on both sides of the 
plane of weakness near the edges of the pavement and near the 
centre line to allow the measurement of crack opening. 

The electrical leads from gages within the pavement 
were carried in the ground below the base course to a plywood 
terminal box located on the sideslope of the pavement (Figure 4 
and Plate 1) . 

Strain and temperature readings were taken within 
eight hours after concrete was placed at the sections where 
gages were installed. The initial gage readings provided a 
base for all subsequent readings.

During the first 10 days* readings were taken at

Subsequent readings were taken once every 7 days for the first 
month.

VII. INSTRUMENTATION 

Altogether forty-eight longitudinal reinforcing bars 
were gaged to measure the strains at the instigated cracks and 
also at distances from 12 to 40 diameters on each side of the 
crack. 

Surface Preparation 

To obtain a smooth surface suitable for attaching 
the "SR-4 n gages, it was necessary to remove the deformations 
from the deformed bars. The deformations were filed off while 
the final polished surface was obtained using different grades 
of emergy cloth (Figure 5)• The removal of the deformations 
and surface polishing caused reduction of cross-sectional area 
by about 5$* 

Type "AB-3" wire resistance strain gages were attached 
to the bars as strain transducers (Plate 2). They were arranged 
to allow measurement of direct strain. 

The process of attaching the n SR-4 n bakelite gages to 
steel surface involves baking at temperatures ranging from 175 °^. 
to 350 °F. to cure the cementing resins. In order to produce a 
correct amount of heat and fascilitate a systematic method of 
curing a number of gages, an oven housing eight bars was designed 
(Figure 6). Special clamps were fabricated and used to apply the 
required pressure to assure a good bond between the gages and the 
steel (Figure 7). 

After all the gages were attached, completely wired, 
waterproofed and checked for stability, the bars were placed in 
wooden racks and shipped to the test site (Figure 8).

The alloy wire used in "SR-4” gages is sensitive to 
temperature as well as strain. While this temperature sensi¬ 
tivity is very small compared with that of strain, it must be 
considered in cases where accurate measurements are to be made 
under varying temperature conditions w ' . 

The four-arm bridge circuit used in most electrical 
strain reading instruments provides a means for correction of 
errors due to temperature changes. This involves the use of 
temperature compensating gages that must be subjected to all 
of the conditions of the active gage except strain. When this 
gage*commonly known as a r, dummy", and the strain measuring gage, 
known as "active gage", comprise adjacent arms of a four-arm 
bridge circuit, only the strains in the active gage influence 
the output of the bridge. 

Two temperature-compensating gages were prepared for 
use at each test location (Figure 9 )* A strain gage was 
attached to a bar 4 inches in length and of the same type of 
steel as used in a given test location. After the gage was 
attached, wired, waterproofed and checked for stability, the 
unit was inserted into a pipe 6 inches in length and sealed with 
petrolastic asphalt (Figure 10). This device, when placed in 
concrete pavement, would be subjected to the same temperature 
conditions as the reinforcing steel, but would not be affected 
by external strain producing loads. 

As the paving operations approached the test location, 
the prepared bars and thermocouples were set in place (Figure 11). 
At each test location four bars were removed and replaced with 
prepared bars. All the lead wires at the test panel were carried 
into the terminal box located on the side-slope of the road.

Figure 11 Prepared Bars in Place 















A "Demec" strain gage, with an 8 inch gage length 
and a range of 0.10 inches, was used to measure the width 
of the instigated crack at each test section. An invar cali¬ 
bration bar provided a standard gage reference for measurements 
that would be made at regular intervals for an extended period 
of time. 

Two steel plugs, \ inch in diameter and 3 inches long, 
provided receptacles for the conic points of the gage. The steel 
plugs were fabricated of a No. 4 reinforcing bar by simply cutting 
the reinforcing bar into 3 inch lengths, machining one end and 
drilling a hole 1/64 inch in diameter and 1/32 inch deep. After 
the finishing operations these plugs were placed in concrete 
pavement at chosen locations, approximately 8 inches apart. After 
the initial set of concrete, the "zero" measurements were made 
and recorded . 

Several types of- temperature transducers were con¬ 
sidered for use in the measurement of temperature at selected 
positions within the pavement structure. 

Economic considerations and time of delivery indicated 
the use of copper-constantan. The end of both copper and con- 
stantan wire was bared for about 1 \ inches . The ends of these 
wires were twisted into a loop and soldered together. After it 
was determined experimentally that calibration curve for all 
practical purposes was a straight line, the soldered end forming 
what is known as "warm junction 1 ' was waterproofed by dipping 
several times in neoprene. 

Four to five temperature gages were installed in the 
pavement in the predetermined locations. Three gages were placed 









21 


vertically, one above the other, 1 inch up from the bottom of 
the slab, at a longitudinal centreline of the pavement, and 
1 inch below the pavement surface.

VIII. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS 
A. Continuously Reinforced Concrete Pavement 

1. Section Type B7*-2 

The reinforced concrete pavement. Type B7-2, 2,648 
feet in length, consists of a seven inch slab reinforced with 
No. 8 intermediate grade, deformed steel bars, comprising 
0.784$ of the cross-section area of the pavement (for details 
see Plate 4). 

Two test sections, referred to from here on as 
’’Location I and Location II”, were located at stations 364+00 
and 357 + °0 respectively. 

(a) Location I 

Concrete, in the test section located at station 
364+00, was poured at 9 a.m. on September 30, 1958. The first 
strain gage readings were taken about three hours after the 
finishing operations, at which time the air temperature was 
60°F. Subsequent readings and strain calculations revealed 
that using the strain readings taken immediately after the 
finishing operation gave questionable results, so readings taken 
8 J- hours after the concrete was placed were used as the basis 
for strain calculations for all subsequent gage readings. 

Two ”SR-4” strain gages were attacned at each gage 
point, one on each side of the horizontal diameter of the re¬ 
inforcing steel. Strains at each gage point were averaged and

”7” refers to the slab thickness.

plotted against time elapsed after construction in days. 

(For gage position, see Plate 1-12.) 

Curves in Plate 1-1 represent the strain history at 

the instigated crack for the first two weeks after placing of 

* 

concrete in the test section. Curves in Plate 1-2 represent 
the strain record at the instigated crack for sixty-six days 
after construction. Subsequent strain readings that were taken 
113 days and 133 days after construction indicate that the re¬ 
inforcing steel spanning the instigated crack had strained far 
beyond its yield point. 

During the first four days after construction, when 
the average slab temperature was between 60 and 70°F., maximum 
compressive strains of 120 micro inches/inch were recorded. 

After four days when the slab temperature dropped below 60°P., 
the strains in the steel increased indicating tension. Readings 
taken 6.3 days after construction at a slab temperature of 52°F 
indicate that the slab had cracked at the plane of weakness, 
and tension strains in the steel of 350 micro inches/inch were 
recorded. Curves in Plates 1-1 and 1-2 indicate that steel in 
the south lane of the pavement was affected by temperature 
change to a greater degree than in the north lane. In the early 
life of the pavement higher compressive strains have been record¬ 
ed in the south lane, and when a crack developed along the plane 
of weakness, the steel in the south lane was subjected to much 
higher tensile strains. 

Readings taken 27 days after construction indicated 
that steel in the south lane had strained to 700 micro inches/ 
inch tension at the crack, and that in the north lane to 225 

micro inches/inch compression. Average crack width in the south 
lane at the time of strain readings was 0.028 inches while in

the north lane the average crack width was 0.032 inches (Plate 
1-7) . The average slab temperature recorded at the time of 
readings was 34°F. An explanation of this phenomenon will be at¬ 
tempted when the discussion of the strain pattern at the gage 
points away from the crack is presented . 

The maximum elastic tension strains in the steel 
spanning the crack were measured on November 28, 1958, when 
the average slab temperature was +1°F. The reinforcing bars 
at the crack in the south lane were strained to 1,675 micro 
inches/inch and in the north lane to 1,250 micro inches/inch. 
Readings taken on December 5th of the same year, or sixty-six 
days after construction when the slab temperature was about 
2°F., indicate somewhat lower strains in the bars spanning 
the crack. 

Strain Pattern at Gage Points Away from the Crack 

It has been pointed out that the strain history at 
the instigated crack is quite different In the two lanes of the 
pavement. Due to this dissimilarity, discussion of the strain 
pattern at gage points away from the plane of weakness may best 
be presented separately. 

South Lane 

The curves in Plates 1-3 and 1-4 represent the strain 
history in the reinforcing steel at gage points 16 to 27 inches 
away from the crack. 

The magnitude of the strain in the reinforcing steel 
at the crack stayed approximately equal as long as the strains 
remained below the yield point. 









After the bars yielded in tension, the strain at gage 
points 5-6 and 11-12 reached 1,400 micro inches/inch, while at 
gage points 1-2 and 7-8 strains of 380 and 700 micro inches/inch 
respectively were measured. 

The development of this unusual strain pattern at gage 
points on each side of the instigated crack may best be explain¬ 
ed by an increased loss of bond between the reinforcing bars and 
concrete west of the crack (Plate 1-8) . 

North Lane 

The strain pattern in the north lane at the gage points 
away from the instigated crack was very similar to that in the 
south lane for the first 9 days after construction (Plate 1-3 
and 1-5) • Measurements taken 13 days after construction indicate 
large compression strains both at the instigated crack and at 
gage points away from this crack. A similar strain occurrence 
took place 20 and 27 days after construction. No definite explan¬ 
ation is available. It should be noted that a truck drove over 
one day’s pour when the concrete slab was from 12 to 18 hours 
old, leaving deep tracks in the slab. These tracks were made 
in the north lane and in the vicinity of the prepared bars . The 
damage was corrected by the contractor the same day by filling 
the tire tracks with freshly mixed concrete. Additional repair 
work on these tire tracks was carried out about two weeks later. 

This occurrence may account for this rather unique strain 
pattern at gage points, both at the instigated crack and away from 
it. No other explanation is available at the present time. 

Considering the fact that the average width of the in¬ 
stigated crack in the north lane was 0.0325 inches when the strain 






• •

26 

measurements indicated compression in the steel at the crack 
of 250 micro inches/inch, it seemed reasonable to assume that 
these strain measurements were unrealistic and incorrect. 

The close relationship between strain in the rein¬ 
forcing steel, crack width, and slab temperature is shown in 
Plate 1-2. 

Curves in Plates 1-9* 1-10, and 1-11 indicate that 
the definite relationships existed between strain in the re¬ 
inforcing steel and crack width, temperature and crack width, 
temperature and strain, when strain in the reinforcing bars 
spanning the crack remained within elastic range. 

The above relationships ceased to exist after the 
reinforcing steel yielded in tension. It may be observed in 
Plate 1-10 that after the reinforcing steel yielded in tension 
the width of the instigated crack was wider for a given tem¬ 
perature . 

No definite relationship seems to have existed 
between strain in the reinforcing steel and the crack width 
when strain in the steel was in the low elastic range . However, 
when strain in the reinforcing steel was in the medium to high 
elastic range, the strain in the steel increased in proportion 
to the increase in the crack width (Plate 1-9) . 

The temperature-crack width curve in Plate 1-10 
indicates that the width of the instigated crack increased in 
proportion to the drop in temperature after sub-freezing temper¬ 
ature cycle started . 

The relationship between strain in the reinforcing 
steel and the slab temperature is shown in Plate 1-11. It is 
evident that in the elastic range the strain in the reinforcing

steel Increased in proportion to the drop in temperature. 

During the early pavement life after the crack develop¬ 
ed at the plane of weakness, constant temperature cycling 
prevented the formation of the adhesive bond between the steel 
and the concrete, and only the mechanical bond was developed 
at the extreme limits of differential movement between the 
concrete and the deformations on the reinforcing bar. The range 
of the differential movement deminished as the strain in the re¬ 
inforcing steel at the crack increased, and as the distance from 
the crack became greater (Plate 1-11) . 

Conclusions 

Loss of bond between the reinforcing bars and the 
concrete extended to a point about 16 bar diameters from the 
crack when strain in the reinforcing steel was in the elastic 
range . Additional bond loss took place after the reinforcing 
bars yielded in tension. 

The reinforcing bars yielded in tension at the insti¬ 
gated crack when the slab temperature dropped below -2Q°F. If 
reinforcing steel with a yield point strain of about 2,500 micro 
inches/inch had been used, it appears probable that no yielding 
would have taken place at slab temperature as low as -40°F. 

When the reinforcing bars started to yield at the slab 
temperature of -20°F., the width of the instigated crack probably 
increased to 0.06 inches. Assuming no yielding of the reinforc¬ 
ing steel, the instigated crack would have likely opened up to 
0.07 inches at -40°F. unless additional cracks were forned . 

It is of interest to note that the strain of the re-

inforcing steel crossing the instigated crack remained within 
the range of M SR-V bakelite gages (15,000 to 20,000 micro 
inches/inch).

(b) Location II 

Concrete in the test section located at station 357+00 
was placed at 11:00 a.m. on October 1st, 1958. First strain 
gage readings were taken about four hours after the finishing oper¬ 
ation. These readings served as the basis for strain calculations 
for all subsequent strain measurements. 

Separate strain-time curves for gages 3-4, 9-10, 15-16 
and 21-22, located at the instigated crack have been plotted. 

These curves are- given in Plates 2-1 to 2-4 inclusive. Strain¬ 
time curves for the above gage points have been superimposed in 
Plates 2-5 and 2-6 in an attempt to show variation in strain 
pattern along the instigated crack. For gage positions see 
Plate 2-15. 

Curves in Plate 2-5 represent the strain history at the 
instigated crack during the first two weeks of the pavement life, 
while curves in Plate 2-6 represent strain history from the time 
of concrete placing until the prepared bars yielded in tension 
at the gage points. 

A very good correlation between strain in the reinforc¬ 
ing steel, crack width, and average slab temperature is shown in 
Plate 2-6 . 

It may be seen from the curves in Plates 2-5 and 2-6 
that largest variations in strain in the steel spanning the crack 
occurred in the south lane, the differences increase with the 
increase in strain. The strains in the steel spanning crack in 
north lane are of the same magnitude as in the south lane, but 
they are nore consistent with the maximum variation of 200 micro 
inches/inch.

Measurements taken on November 28th, 1958 when the 
test section was 57 days old, and the average slab temperature 
was -3°F., show that the crack had opened to O.O 67 inches and 
the reinforcing steel spanning the crack was strained to an 
average of 1730 micro inches/inch tension. The maximum strain 
recorded at one gage point was 1900 micro inches/inch. 

This was the lowest temperature at which measurements 
were made on the gages before the reinforcing steel spanning 
the crack strained past its yield point. 

Strain Pattern at Gage Points Away From the Crack 

Strain history at gage points on each side of the 
instigated crack is shownjn Plates 2-7 to 2-10 inclusive. 

In order to show strain distribution along the re¬ 
inforcing bar away from the crack, strain versus L/D curves 
were plotted (Plate 2-11) . 

During the first five weeks after construction when 
strain in the steel bars at the crack remained in the low 
elastic range, strain along the bar decreased at a diminishing 
rate for a distance of about 30 inches from the crack, and 
then began to increase gradually. When the reinforcing steel 
spanning the crack strained past the yield point, strain of 
1400 micro inches/inch was measured at the gage point 16 bar 
diameters from the crack and 1260 micro inches/inch 24 bar 
diameters from the crack. It may be concluded that loss of 
bond at the instigated crack extended to a point about 27 bar 
diameters from the crack. 

The very close relationship between strain in the, re¬ 
inforcing steel, crack width, and average slab temperature is 
shown in Plate 2-6.

Curves in Plates 2-12, 2-13 and 2-14 show that definite 
relationship existed between strain in reinforcing steel and 
crack width, temperature and crack width, temperature and strain, 
when strain in the reinforcing steel remained within elastic 
range. 

Extrapolation of steel strain-rrack width curve, 
temperature-crack width curve and temperature-strain curve 
indicated that the reinforcing steel at the instigated crack 
began to yield at a slab temperature of -10°F., and the crack 
opened to 0.07 inches. 

Measurements taken 113 and 133 days after construction 
indicate that after the reinforcing steel yielded in tension 
cracks opened to 0.107 and 0.115 inches when the slab tempera¬ 
ture was -2 and -4°F. respectively (Plate 2-13). 

If higher yield point strain reinforcing steel had 
been used, the crack would not have opened to such an objection¬ 
able width but perhaps additional cracks would have developed. 

During the early pavement life, constant temperature 
cycling prevented the formation of adhesive bond, and only 
mechanical bond was developed at the extreme limits of the 
differential movement between the concrete and the deformations 
in the reinforcing bar. This differential movement was most 
significant for a distance of about 27 inches on each side of 
the crack, and decreased at a diminishing rate as the distance 
from the crack became greater. 

This behaviour of the pavement during its early life 
had a significant effect on future strain history and crack width 
pattern at the instigated crack.

The shape of the strain-crack width curve suggests 
that when the reinforcing steel at the crack was in the low to 
medium elastic range * the width of the crack increased in pro¬ 
portion to the strain in the steel at a rate of about 70 micro 
inches of crack opening per every micro inch of strain in the 
reinforcing steel. In the high elastic range * the width of the 
crack increased in proportion to strain but at a greatly reduced 
rate (Plate 2-12). 

With the approach of a cooling cycle when temperature 
dropped below 50°F. the width of the instigated crack increased 
in proportion to drop in temperature (Plate 2-13) . 

Conclusions 

The data seem to indicate that the reinforcing steel 

at the instigated crack began to yield when slab temperature 

o 

dropped to about -10 F. Measurements taken on November 27th* 

1958 show that yield point strain of the steel had been reached 
at least at some of the gage locations when the slab temperature 
was -3°F. and the crack opened to 0.0685 inches. 

After the reinforcing bars spanning the crack yielded 
in tension, the width of the instigated crack exceeded 0.12 inches. 

Temperature records at the Calgary airport indicate 
that the lowest temperature recorded for the winter season was 
-25°F. Assuming no yielding of the reinforcing steel, it is 
probable that at this extreme low in temperature, the crack 
would have opened to 0.088 inches. 

The loss of bond between the reinforcing bars and the 
concrete extended to a point about 27 bar diameters from the 
crack. This comparatively large loss of bond had an adverse 
effect on the width of the crack opening.

(c) Comparison of Results at Location I and Location II 

Concrete was placed at the gaged panel* Location I* 
on September 30* 1958 and at gaged panel* Location II* on 
October 1st of the same year. After the first set of readings 
was taken at Location II* all the subsequent measurements at 
the two locations were taken about one-half hour apart. 

During the first six weeks after construction close 
relationship existed, between strain in the reinforcing steel 
and the crack width at the two locations . Reinforcing steel 
at Location II was subjected to somewhat larger strains than 
at Location I. Strains of 820 and 910 micro inches/inch were 
measured at Locations I and II when the pavement was 44 days 
old. Average crack width at both locations was 0.03 inches 
when the above strain measurements were taken. 

The effect of sub-freezing temperature was more pro¬ 
nounced at Location II. Measurements taken 58 days after con¬ 
struction* when slab temperature was about 0°F.* indicated that 
the reinforcing steel at the crack was strained to 1650 micro 
inches/inch at Location I and 1900 micro inches/inch at Loca¬ 
tion II* and the instigated crack opened to 0.049 inches and 
0.064 inches at the two respective locations. 

Examination of strain transfer distribution curves 
(Plates 1-8 and 2-11) reveals that loss of bond at Location II 
extended much further from the crack than at Location I. Greater 
loss of bond combined with larger strains in the reinforcing 
steel account for the wider crack opening at Location II.

2. Section Type B7-1 

Concrete pavement Type B7-1, 2645 feet in length, 
consists of a 7 inch slab reinforced with No. 8 intermediate 
grade deformed steel bars comprising a 0 , 706 % cross-section 
area of the pavement (Plate 4) . 

The test section was located at station 334+00 approx¬ 
imately 4,072 feet from the expansion dam, constructed at the 
west end of the pavement (Plate 6) . 

Concrete at the test section referred to from here on 
as Location III was poured on October 6, 1958 about 4.00 p .m. 

The first strain gage readings were taken immediately after the 
finishing operation. These readings served as the basis for 
all subsequent strain measurements. Out of 24 strain gages, 
gages 1, 2, and 24 could not be connected to the terminal box. 
(For gage positions see Plate 3-14.) 

Curves in Plates 3-1 to 3-6 inclusive represent the 
strain history at the induced crack. Curves in Plates 3-1 to 3-4 
represent the strain history for the individual gage points . 
Curves for the individual gage points have been superimposed 
in Plates 3-5 and 3-6 in an attempt to determine the strain 
pattern along the transverse crack. Curves in Plates 3-7 to 
3-9 inclusive represent the strain history at gage points away 
from the crack. 

During the first two weeks after construction, the re¬ 
inforcing steel in the south lane was subjected to considerably 
larger strains than in the north lane (Plate 3-7) • 







. 






























.. 






































A good relationship between strain in the reinforcing 
steel, crack width, and average slab temperature is shown in 
Plate 3-6. 

Some trends became apparent when concrete was several 
days old. Curves in Plates 3-10, 3-H and 3-12 suggest that 
definite relationships existed between the strain in the steel 
and crack width, temperature and crack width, temperature and 
strain, as long as the reinforcing steel spanning the crack 
remained in the elastic range. 

By extrapolation of temperature-strain curve and 
strain-crack width curve, combined with a knowledge of rein¬ 
forcing steel characteristics (Plate 9)* it may be shown that 
the reinforcing steel began to yield at the instigated crack 
at a slab temperature of about -15°F., and the crack probably 
opened up to 0.038 inches. Extrapolation of temperature-crack 
width curve reveals that at -15°F. the crack would open to 
0.036 inches. It may also be shown that if the reinforcing 
steel, having higher yield point strain had been used, no yield¬ 
ing would have taken place at the cracks. As a result, addition¬ 
al cracks would have probably formed at very low temperatures 
and the existing cracks would not have opened to objectionable 
widths . 

During December of 1958, measurements were made at a 
slab temperature of 6°F. when the pavement was 60 days old. 

These measurements indicated that the strain in the reinforcing 
steel at the crack reached 1,350 micro inches/inch and that the 
crack opened to 0.03 inches. 

This was the lowest temperature at which measurements

were made on the gages before the reinforcing bars yielded in 
tension. It may be pointed out that a temperature of -13°F. 
was recorded at the Calgary airport on November 26, 1958 before 
the 60-da.y readings were taken. It is possible that the strain 
in the reinforcing steel approached the yield point at that 
temperature. 

Measurements that were made on January 22 of 1959 
when the pavement was 108 days old, revealed that the crack 
opened to 0.036 inches, the reinforcing bars at the crack were 
strained to about 7*000 micro inches/inch in tension, or well 
beyond the yield point, and the slab temperature was -1.5°F. 

Temperature records at the Calgary airport indicate 
that during the second week of December, 1958 and the first 
week of January, 1959 a low of -12°F. and - 25 °F. respectively 
was recorded. 

It is believed that during the time when the pavement 
was subjected to these low temperatures, reinforcing bars span¬ 
ning the crack strained past the yield point and the cracks 
opened much wider. 

Strain measurements at the gage points away from the 
plane of weakness indicated that the loss of bond between the 
concrete and the steel extended to a point about 24 bar diameters, 
or in this case 24 inches from the crack (Plate 3-13) . 

During the first few days of pavement life, shrinkage 
crack formed in the vicinity of the plane of weakness (Plate 
3-14) . Strain data indicate that the shrinkage crack developed 
before the pavement cracked at the plane of weakness . It is 

quite possible that this shrinkage crack formed before the 
plane of weakness was induced . It must be pointed out that

on numerous occasions the plane of weakness was induced after 
the concrete was 3 to 5 days old. 

The shrinkage crack in the vicinity of the plane of 
weakness prevented the opening of the instigated crack to 
objectionable width. 

Since the formation of the potential bond between the 
concrete and the steel was prevented by the application of 
plastic tape over all the bars for a distance of about 6 inches 
along the plane of weakness, it is believed that the crack at 
the plane weakness opened wider than the shrinkage crack for a 
given drop in temperature. 

It may be observed in Plate 3-5 that one of the pre¬ 
pared bars was not subjected to post yield straining. The forma¬ 
tion of the two closely spaced cracks in the test section brought 
about a loss of bond between the gage points 15-16 and 17-18, and 
some distance beyond; as a result strain in that bar distributed 
over a relatively long length preventing eventual yielding at 
low temperatures. 

The shape of the strain-crack width curve shown in 
Plate 3-10 seems to indicate that the width of the crack at the 
plane of weakness increased at an increasing rate until a certain 
strain in the reinforcing steel was reached, after which the 
width of the crack increased in proportion to strain increase. 
Similarly, temperature-crack width curve shown in Plate 3-11 
indicates that the width of the crack increased at a decreasing 
rate during the early life of pavement when temperatures were 
above freezing. When the slab was subjected to sub-freezing

temperatures, the crack width increased in proportion with the 
decrease in temperature. 

During the first few days after construction, there 
seemed to be very little relationship between the magnitude of 
the strain in the reinforcing bars at the plane of weakness and 
the slab temperature, even though the reinforcing steel was strain 
sensitive to the changing temperature. This action continued 
until the seasonal cooling cycle started, the lower temperatures 
caused an increase in the steel strain at the crack, and then a 
reasonable relationship became apparent (Plate 3-12) . 















66 


Conclusions 

(a) Pavement Behaviour when Reinforcing Steel at the Crack 
Remained in the Elastic Range 

Constant temperature cycling during the first few 
days of pavement life prevented the formation of adhesive bond 
and only mechanical bond was developed at the extreme limits of 
the differential movement between the concrete and the deforma¬ 
tions on the reinforcing bar. 

With the advance of low temperatures and continuing 
shrinkage, the crack opened beyond the range of free movement 
and all of the strain was transferred into the reinforcing bar. 

Curves in Plates 3-11 and 3-12 indicate that the crack 
width and the strain in the reinforcing steel at the instigated 
crack increased in proportion to the decrease in temperature . 

The upper and lower boundary shown in Plate 3-12 give an indi¬ 
cation of the amplitude of the relative movement during the 
course of the temperature fluctuation. 

Curves in Plate 3-13 indicate that the loss of bond 
extended to a point about 24 bar diameters from the crack. 

Strain-crack width curve and temperature crack width 
curve are quite well defined by points which represent measure¬ 
ments that were made at least 21 days after construction when 
behaviour of the pavement was well established. 

Tension yielding took place in three out of four 
prepared bars at the instigated crack before 108 day strain 
measurements were made. It is believed that the steel spanning 
the crack yielded in tension between the second week of December 
of 1958 and the first week of January, 1959* during which period 

. 





lowest temperatures of the winter season were recorded. The 
lowest temperature recorded at the Calgary airport was -25°P. 
during the first week of January, 1959* 

The manner in which the reinforcing bars yielded made 
it very difficult, if not impossible, to determine the average 
strain once the yield point had been reached . Due to reduction 
in cross-section area of the bar at the gage location, yielding 
was localized at the gage points . 

Strain history in the reinforcing bars and the crack 
width pattern at the instigated crack do not truly represent the 
conditions at the cracks spaced 7 to 10 feet apart due to the 
fact that an additional crack formed in the vicinity of the 
plane of weakness. 

The marked influence exerted by the shrinkage crack 
on the strain history and the crack width pattern at the insti¬ 
gated crack leads to the belief that in the absence of this 
crack, the instigated crack would have opened much wider and the 
reinforcing steel would have been subjected to higher strains, 
thus giving better representation of the conditions that existed 
at the cracks spaced from 7 to 10 feet apart. 

(b) Pavement Behaviour After the Reinforcing Steel Yielded 
in Tension 

When the pavement was subjected to extreme sub-zero 
temperatures reinforcing steel at the cracks yielded in tension 
and cracks opened to objectionable widths. 

A simple calculation will reveal that the potential 
tensile force that may be developed in the concrete slab is 




. 


■ • .. ■ • . • ■

' 


















much higher than that which may be developed in reinforcing 
steel at the yield point strain. For this reason instead of 
additional cracks being formed * the steel yielded at existing 


cracks.

3 . Section Type B6-1 

The reinforced concrete pavement Type B6-1, 1,972 feet 
in length, consists of a six inch slab continuously reinforced 
with No. 6 intermediate grade deformed steel bars comprising a 
0.715$ cross-section area of the pavement (Plate 4). 

Prepared bars were placed at four cross-sections in 
this test strip. Full consideration was given in selection of 
a suitable location for gage installations . For the purpose of 
comparison. Locations IV and V were selected on the test strip 
where there was a cut of one foot while Locations VI and VII 
were selected to be on a fill of six feet. The plan and the 
profile of the test road are shown in Plate 6. 

(a) Location IV 

Concrete was placed in the test section at 8 a.m. on 
October 15, 1958- First set of readings was taken three hours 
after the finishing operation. 

The strain history in the reinforcing steel at the 
plane of weakness is shown in Plate 4-1 and 4-2. Strain history 
at gage points on each side of the plane of weakness is shown in 
Plates 4-3 and 4-4. The diagram in Plate 4-5 shows the position 
of gages in the test section, and also the location of the shrink¬ 
age crack which developed before the plane of weakness was in¬ 
duced . 

The presence of the shrinkage crack coupled with a 
probable bending action explains the strange strain pattern in 
the reinforcing steel at the plane of weakness and at gage points 
on each side, (Plates 4-1 to 4-4).

The crack width measurements indicate that the slab 
did not crack at the plane of weakness. Therefore, strain 
measurements at gage points located at the plane of weakness do 
not truly represent the strain condition in the reinforcing 
steel at the crack but at some distance from it. 

Strain measurements indicate that the reinforcing 
steel at the crack began to yield in the south lane before the 
pavement was 51 days old. It is probable that the reinforcing 
bars started to yield 4l days after construction when a low of 
-13°F. was recorded at the Calgary airport. 

It should be pointed out that the crack width measure¬ 
ment taken on February 10, 1959 showed that the crack had opened 
to 0.0445 inches at the north edge of the pavement when the slab 
temperature was -3°F. The crack width measurements at the north 
edge of the pavement are questionable because the crack passed 
through one of the gage points . 

Due to the irregular strain pattern in the reinforcing 
steel at the plane of weakness, and due to the uncertain width 
of the shrinkage crack, no relationship between strain in the 
reinforcing steel, crack width and temperature, could be 
established. 

The last strain and temperature measurements were made 
on December 5, 1958- Subsequent to this date water entered the 
terminal box preventing further measurements .

(b) Location V 

The pavement was placed at the test section at 7 a.m. 
on October 16, 1958 when the temperature was 34°F. Gage read¬ 
ings taken about two hours after the surface finishing operation 
provided the basis for all subsequent measurements. 

The strain history in the reinforcing steel at the 
instigated crack is shown in Plate 5-1• The strain history for 
gage points located at each side of the crack is shown in Plates 
5-2 to 5-5 inclusive . Diagram in Plate 5-8 shows the gage 
positions and the location of the shrinkage crack. 

An examination of the strain-time curves in Plate 5-1 
reveals that the prepared bars in the north lane of the pavement 
were subjected to considerably larger strains at the plane of 
weakness than in the south lane. 

Measurements taken on November 6, 1958 when the pave¬ 
ment was 28 days old indicate that the prepared bars at the 
plane of weakness were strained to 1,100 micro inches/inch in 
the north lane of the pavement and 700 micro inches/inch in the 
south lane when the slab temperature was 30°P. The crack at 
the north edge of the pavement opened to 0.021 inches. 

This was the lowest temperature at which readings 
were made on the gages before the prepared bars yielded in 
tension. Measurements were made on December 5* 1958 when the 
pavement was 50 days old and the slab temperature was 5°F. The 
crack width at the north edge of the pavement had increased to 
0.043 inches and the reinforcing bars at the crack were strained 
to 9,000 micro inches/inch, or far beyond the yield point.

Good relationship seems to have existed between 
strain in the reinforcing steel, crack width and slab tempera¬ 
ture during the first four weeks of pavement life. However, 
insufficient data are available at this location to establish 
definite trends. 

Curves in Plates 5-2 and 5-3 indicate compression in 
the reinforcing bars at gage points 1-2, 7-8 and 11-12. Com¬ 
pressive strains at these gage points seem to increase with a 
decrease in temperature. No explanation for this unusual strain 
pattern at these gage points is available at the present time . 

An examination of curves in Plates 5-^ and 5-5 reveals 
that almost identical strain pattern existed in the reinforcing 
steel at gage points away from the plane of weakness in the north 
lane . 

Conclusions 

Reinforcing bars yielded at the crack when concrete 
pavement was between 28 and 50 days old. Sufficient data are 
unavailable to determine the approximate temperature range at 
which yielding started . 

Considering the strain history in the reinforcing steel 
for the first four weeks of pavement life, yielding probably 
started in the steel embedded in the north lane of the pavement. 

Due to unusual strain behaviour at gage points at each 
side of the plane of weakness, it is not possible to determine 
the length over which the loss of bond extended .

(c) Location VI 

The pavement was poured at the test section at 8.00 
a.m. on October 16 of 1958- The initial readings were taken 
3 hours after the finishing operations when the slab tempera¬ 
ture was 53°F. 

The strain history in the reinforcing bars at the 
instigated crack is shown in Plates 6-1 and 6-2, and at the 
gage points at each side of the plane of weakness in Plates 
6-3 to 6-6 inclusive . The diagram in Plate 6-8 shows the 
position of the strain gages and the location of the gage 
points at which crack measurements were taken. Curves in 
Plate 6-7 show strain variation in the reinforcing steel at 
the instigated crack and the variation in the crack width. 

The behaviour of the pavement during the first few 
days after pouring provided very interesting information. 
However, the most significant feature of the early behaviour 
did not become apparent for some weeks . 

Curves in Plates 6-1 and 6-2 show that close relation¬ 
ship existed between strain in the reinforcing steel and the 
slab temperature. 

Measurements taken four days after concrete was placed 
in the test section indicate that the slab cracked along the 
plane of weakness. The crack opened to 0.0025 inches and strain 
in the prepared bars reached 210 micro inches/inch tension, at 
the slab temperature of 49°F. 

Measurements taken 5* 8 and 8 days after construction 
when the slab temperature dropped to 40°F. indicate that the 











pavement was subjected to bending action in the horizontal 
plane (Plate 6-1) . Strain and crack width measurements taken 
on November 27 when the pavement was 42 days old, tend to 
verify the "bending action" at the instigated crack. 

The curves in Plate 6-7 show that for a given slab 
temperature the width of the instigated crack .decreased in pro¬ 
portion to the distance from the south edge of the pavement. 
Similarly, strain in the prepared bars decreased linearly from 
south to north. 

Further examination of strain curves in Plate 6-7 
reveals that the reinforcing bars closest to the south edge 
of the pavement started to yield before 42 days measurements 
were taken. The reinforcing bars closest to the south edge 
probably started to yield in tension on November 26, or 4l 
days after construction, when a low of -13°F. was recorded at 
the Calgary airport. 

Considering the previous strain pattern, it is probable 
that progressive yielding of the reinforcing steel took place 
with an additional drop in temperature until all the bars 
spanning the crack yielded in tension. 

Examination of strain history at gage points at each 
side of the crack reveals that loss of bond extended to all 
gage points west of the crack. 

The strain in the prepared bars and the crack width 
pattern seem to indicate that the horizontal curve tends to 
straighten out as the pavement contracts due to shrinkage and 
the temperature drop. With this in mind, it appears that more

reinforcement is required at the intrados lane of the curve. 

No other trends can be established at this location 
because of the very limited data available . The last measure¬ 
ments at this location were taken on November 29* 1958 when the 
pavement was only 6 weeks old. Subsequent to this date, water 
entered the terminal box preventing further measurements .

(d) Location VII 

The pavement was poured at the test section at 9 .00 
a.m. on October 16 , 1958 when the temperature was 50°F. Initial 
readings were taken 3 hours after the finishing operation when 
the average slab temperature was 60°F. The crack was formed 
at the induced plane of weakness before the pavement was 4 
days old. 

The strain history in the reinforcing steel at the 
instigated crack is shown in Plates 7-1 and 7 - 2 . The strain 
history at the gage points away from the induced plane of 
weakness is shown in Plates 7-3 to 7-8 inclusive. 

The very close relationship between the strain in the 
reinforcing steely crack width and slab temperature is shown 
in Plate 7-2. 

Measurements were made when the pavement was 20 days 
old and the slab temperature was 26°P. The crack opened to 
0.026 inches and the gaged bars at the crack were strained to 
ll 60 micro inches/inch in tension. 

This was the lowest temperature at which readings 
were made on the gages before the reinforcing steel spanning 
the crack yielded in tension. 

Some definite trends became apparent at this location 
after a relatively short period of time. Curve in Plate 7-8 
indicates that the width of the crack increased in proportion 
with the strain in the reinforcing steel. Linear relationship 
appears to have existed between the slab temperature and the 
width of the crack and between the slab temperature and the 
strain in the reinforcing steel at the instigated crack. It

must be pointed out that these relationships are valid when 
strain in the reinforcing bars remained within the. elastic 
range of the steel. When the strain remained within the 
elastic range of the reinforcing steel, loss of bond between 
the concrete and the steel extended to a point 24 bar diameters 
or 18 inches from the crack. After the reinforcing bars 
yielded in tension, loss of bond extended beyond the gage 
point 2' 9" from the crack (Plate 7-7) • 

By extrapolation of the temperature-strain and crack 
width-strain curves using the yield point strain of the re¬ 
inforcing steel of 1900 micro inches/inch, it may be shown 
that the reinforcing bars started to yield at a slab tempera¬ 
ture of 6°F. (Plate 7-10), and the width of the crack reached 
0.047 inches (Plate 7-8). It may be noticed that this value 
of the crack width fits very well the temperature-crack width 
curve (Plate 7-9)• 

The pavement behaviour at the crack at this location 
suggest that if a reinforcing steel having a yield point strain 
of 3100 micro inches/inch had been used, no yielding would have 
taken place in the reinforcing bars at the crack at a slab 
temperature of -25°F. and the instigated crack would have 
opened to 0.074 inches at this extreme low in temperature. 

It may be observed in Plate 7-9 that after the re¬ 
inforcing bars strained past the yield point strain of the steel, 
the crack at the induced plane of weakness opened to 0.123 inches 
when the slab temperature was -6°F. 

Crack width measurements taken on February 10 and 

o 

March 7 of 1959 when the slab temperature was -6°F. and 35 F. 






















Ill 


respectively, indicate that the width of the crack at the 
induced plane of weakness was much wider at the south edge 
of the pavement and decreased linearly from south to north 
indicating bending in the horizontal plane. See data on 
Page 26L 
CONCLUSIONS 

The sub-freezing temperatures had noticeable effects 
on the pavement behaviour. The tension strains in the prepared 
bars increased appreciably and the crack at the induced plane 
of weakness opened wider, resulting in more uniform strains 
in the reinforcing steel at the crack. 

After all the reinforcing bars yielded in tension 
and the strain equilibrium was established at the crack, bend¬ 
ing action became noticeable. 

Three out of the four prepared bars yielded in tension 
before the pavement was 50 days old . Considering the tempera¬ 
ture-strain relationship, it is probable that the reinforcing 
steel started to yield 31 days after construction when a low 
of -5°P. was recorded for the first time at the Calgary airport. 

Th& lowest temperature of the winter season was 
recorded at the Calgary airport during the first week of 
January 1959 when the temperature dropped to -25°P. Measure¬ 
ments made on January 22, 1959 indicate that the reinforcing 
bars were strained in tension past the range of the "SR-4 n 
bakelite type strain gage. 

Loss of bond between the concrete and the re-inforcing 
steel extended to a point about 24 bar diameters from the 
instigated crack when strain in the reinforcing steel was in

the elastic range. After the reinforcing steel yielded in 
tension, loss of bond extended beyond a point 44 bar diameters 
from the crack. 

(e) Comparison of Pavement Behaviour at Locations IV to VII 
in Section Type B6-1 

During the first two weeks of the pavement life, 
similar behaviour was observed at all four locations . Strains 
of 850 to 900 micro inches/inch tension were measured in the 
gaged bars at each location during this time . Bending in the 
horizontal plane became apparent at each location to a varying 
degree immediately after the shrinkage cracks formed at or in 
the vicinity of the plane of weakness . Data indicate that 
bending action was most significant at Locations IV and VI. 

The development of shrinkage crack close to the plane 
of weakness at Locations IV and V occurred very likely before 
the plane of weakness was induced . It may be observed from the 
diagrams in Plates 4-5 and 5-5 that the shrinkage crack at both 
locations formed outside the steel gage points or passed through 
one of the gage points;as a result the width of the crack at 
Locations IV and V could not be measured accurately. 

It seems that the most significant feature of the 
early pavement behaviour at Locations IV and VI was bending 
in the horizontal plane. No other trends seem to be apparent 
at this time. 

Some definite trends become apparent in the pavement 
at Location VII during its early life. Reasonably good re¬ 
lationship existed between strain in the reinforcing steel, 
slab temperature and crack width. After the reinforcing steel

spanning the crack yielded in tension, crack width measure¬ 
ments at Location VII tend to indicate bending in the hori¬ 
zontal plane . 

In view of the fact that measurements in the test 
sections in pavement type B6-1 were taken over very short 
lengths of time, great caution is suggested in drawing any 
conclusions as to the future pavement behaviour in this 
section. 

Considering the strain history in the reinforcing 
steel, crack width, spacing of cracks and loss of bond between 
concrete and the steel, it seems reasonable to assume that the 
worst conditions were encountered at Location VII, and any 
comparisons that are made between different section types 
should be made with this location In mind .

4. Section Type B6-2 


125 


The continuously reinforced concrete pavement. Type 
B6-2, 2204.5 feet in length, consists of a six inch slab re¬ 
inforced with No. 6 intermediate grade deformed bars comprising 
a 0.815$ cross-section area of the pavement. (For full details 
see Plate 4.) 

Prepared bars were placed at two cross-sections in 
this test strip. The test sections located at stations 294+00 
and 289+50 are referred to from here on as Location VIII and 
Location IX respectively. The test section at Location VIII 
was constructed on a 25 foot "fill 11 and at Location IX in a 
2 foot "cut". 

(a.) Location VIII 

The pavement was poured at the test section at 7 a.m. 
on October 20, 1958 when the air temperature was at 30°F. The 
first set of readings was taken two hours after the finishing 
operation when the air temperature was at 32 . 5 °P • and the slab 
temperature was at 47°F. The crack developed at the induced 
plane of weakness when the pavement was between three and five 
days old . 

The strain history in the reinforcing steel at the 
instigated crack is shown in Plates 8-1 and 8-2. Curves in 
Plates 8-3 and 8-6 represent the strain record in the reinforc¬ 
ing bars at the gage points on each side of the plane of weakness. 

The diagram in Plate 8-12 shows the position of the 
strain gages, steel gage points, temperature gages and the 
location of the two cracks which developed before the pavement

was 46 days old. A crack survey taken on March 7* 1959* 

when the pavement was 136. days old, indicates that an additional 

crack developed two feet east of the plane of weakness. 

The very close relationship between the strain in the 
reinforcing steel, crack width and slab temperature is shown 
in Plates 8-1, 8-2 and 8-8. 

Measurements taken during the first two weeks after 
construction when the slab temperature varied between 40 and 
50 °F. indicate that the reinforcing steel at the crack was 
strained to 600 micro inches/inch in tension and the crack 
opened to 0.01 inches. 

Measurements taken 16 days after construction, when 
the slab temperature was l8°F, show that the strain in the 
reinforcing bars reached 1,200 micro inches/inch in tension 
and the width of the crack increased to 0.228 inches. This 
was the lowest temperature at which the readings were made on 
the gages before the reinforcing steel at the crack yielded in 
tension. 

Measurements made on November 27 and 28, 1958 when 
the pavement was 38 to 39 days old and the slab temperature 

i 

varied between zero and 27 °F., indicate that the prepared bars 
at the crack yielded far beyond the yield point strain of the 
steel. Considering the previous strain history, combined with 
a knowledge of the reinforcing steel characteristics, it is 
probable that the reinforcing bars yielded in tension 37 days 
after construction when a low of -13°F. was recorded at the 
Calgary airport for the first time .

The strain gages at the instigated crack failed 
before the 94 day measurements were taken. Temperature 
records at the Calgary airport indicate that a low of -25°F. 
was recorded during the first week of January 1959- It is 
believed that the reinforcing steel at the crack strained 
past the range of the n SR-4 n bakelite gages at this extreme 
low in temperature, resulting in the eventual failure of 
these gages . 

When the strain in the reinforcing bars spanning 
the crack remained in the elastic range, loss of bond between 
the concrete and the steel extended to a point 16 bar diameters 
or 12 inches from the crack. After the reinforcing bars 
yielded beyond the range of "SR-4 i! strain gages, the loss of 
bond extended to a point 32 bar diameters or 24 inches from 
the crack. 

By extrapolation of temperature-strain and crack 
width-strain curves, it may be shown that the prepared bars 
started to yield at a slab temperature of -5°F. and the 
instigated crack opened to 0.039 inches (Plates 8-11 and 8-9). 
It is also apparent from these curves that if a reinforcing 
steel having a yield point strain of about 2,700 micro inches/ 
inch had been used, no yielding would have occurred at the 
cracks. However, more new cracks would have probably develop¬ 
ed and the cracks would not have opened to such objectionable 
widths . 

It may be observed in Plate 8-10 that the width of 
the crack opened to 0.07 inches when the slab temperature was 
-5°F. after the reinforcing steel spanning the crack yielded 








128 


in tension. However* it is believed that an additional crack 
developed two feet east of the plane of weakness before this 
measurement was taken. 

Conclusions 

The strain history at the gage points on each side 
of the induced plane of weakness seems to indicate that during 
the first few days of the pavement life when the concrete was 
weak relative movement between the concrete and the steel took 
place due to constant temperature cycling. This type of action 
prevented the formation of the adhesive bond between the concrete 
and the steel resulting in purely mechanical bond development 
at the extreme limits of the differential movement between 
the concrete and the deformations on the reinforcing bar. 

The formation of an additional crack in the test 
section when the slab was subjected to extremely low tempera¬ 
tures prevented the instigated crack from opening much wider.

(b) Location IX 

The pavement was placed at the test section at 11 
a.m. on October 20, 1958 when the air temperature was 50°F. 

The first set of readings was taken two hours after the finish¬ 
ing operation. 

Curves in Plates 9-1 and 9-2 show the strain history 
in the reinforcing steel at the instigated crack. The strain 
history at the gage points at each side of the plane of weakness 
is shown in Plates 9-3 to 9-6 inclusive. The diagram in Plate 
9-10 shows the position of the strain gages, crack plugs, 
temperature gages, and the location of the shrinkage crack 
which developed in the south lane east of the plane of weakness 
four days after construction. Strain data indicate that the 
shrinkage crack advanced into the north lane to the point shown 
in Plate 9-10 before the 46 day readings were taken. Subsequent 
measurements tend to indicate that this crack advanced to the 
position of the gage point 13-14 but not any further. 

During the first two days after construction tempera¬ 
ture fluctuations had only minor influence on the strain pattern 
of the reinforcing steel at the instigated crack, and at gage 
points on each side of the plane of weakness (Plate 9-9)• 

Measurements taken five days after construction when 
the slab temperature was 45°F indicate that the pavement cracked 
at the induced plane of weakness and another crack developed 
about 18 inches east of the plane of weakness in the south lane. 
These cracks developed as a result of shrinkage and sudden drop 
in temperature . It may be observed in Plates 9-1 to 9-4 that

the presence of the shrinkage crack east of the plane of weak¬ 
ness had a measurable effect on the future strain pattern at 
gage points 1-2, 3-4, 7-8, 9-10 and 13-14. 

After the pavement was subjected to extremely low 
temperatures, the instigated crack became wider and the rein¬ 
forcing bars at the crack were strained more evenly. 

It must be pointed out that no yielding of reinforcing 
bars spanning the crack took place even at very low temperatures. 

The data indicate that for a given increase in strain 
in the reinforcing steel and for a given drop in the slab temper¬ 
ature, the width of the instigated crack increased at a decreas¬ 
ing rate (Plates 9-7 and 9-8) • Also, for a given drop in 
temperature, strain in the reinforcing bars at the crack in¬ 
creased at a diminishing rate. 

Temperature records at the Calgary airport indicate 
that a low of -25°F. was recorded for the winter season. By 
extrapolation of the temperature-strain and crack width-strain 
curves, it may be shown that at this low in temperature, re¬ 
inforcing steel at the crack was strained to 1,900 micro inches/ 
inch, the approximate yielding strain, and the width of the 
crack probably opened to 0.043 inches. 

In order to explain the pavement behaviour at this 
location it is necessary to review the basic theory for the 
continuously reinforced concrete pavements. 

Temperature contraction of short pavement slabs is 
not greatly diminished by frictional tension stress, but long 
pavement slabs as used in continuously reinforced concrete

pavements actively contract and expand for some hundreds 
of feet near each end. The length of actively moving ends 
and the relative movements are related to the thermal change, 
the coefficient of friction, and the modulus of elasticity 
of the pavement. Movements for daily temperature changes 
extend in diminishing amounts to a distance of a few hundred 
feet from the free ends until a point of zero movement is 
reached . The length of the actively moving end extends from 
the free end of the continuously reinforced concrete strip to 
a point at which the total frictional force is equal to the 
elastic potential force of the reinforcing steel(°). This is 
illustrated in Plate 10. 

The length of the central portion of the pavement 
extending from Y to Z remains constant, while the length of 
the pavement extending from A to Y and from B to Z changes 
in length due to movement which is caused by shrinkage and 
temperature fluctuation (Plate 10) . 

The fact that the strain in the reinforcing steel 
remained in the elastic range and the crack did not open to 
an objectionable width, tends to indicate that the length of 
the actively moving end extended from the expansion dam con¬ 
structed at the east end of the continuously reinforced 
concrete strip to a point some distance beyond the test 


section at this location.

Conclusions 

The presence of the shrinkage crack, a short distance 
east of the plane of weakness, had measurable effect on the strain 
pattern in the reinforcing bars located in the south lane of the 
pavement. Moreover, at extremely low temperatures, the strain 
in the reinforcing bars across the instigated crack distributed 
itself more evenly and the crack east of the induced plane of 
weakness became inactive. 

During the first few days temperature fluctuations 
had only minor influence on the strain pattern in the reinforc¬ 
ing steel. A constant temperature cycling when the concrete 
was weak prevented formation of an adhesive bond between the 
concrete and the reinforcing bars, and only mechanical bond 
developed at the extreme limits of differential movement 
between the concrete and the deformations on the reinforcing 
bar. 

There is some evidence which leads to the belief 
that the length of actively moving end extended some distance 
west of the test section at Location IX. 

The apparent differential movement between the concrete 
slab and the base during the cooling cycle prevented the cracks 
from opening up to objectionable widths and the reinforcing 
bars at the crack from yielding in tension. 








145 


(c) Comparison of Results at Test Sections in Pavement Type B6-2 

During the first twenty-four days after construction 
when the slab temperature remained above 20°F. * similar pave¬ 
ment behaviour was observed at the two test sections with some 
minor variations in strain in the reinforcing bars and width 
of the crack opening. The reinforcing bars were subjected to 
higher strains at the crack at Location VIII and the induced 
crack opened wider at Location IX. Low temperature had a much 
different effect on the strain pattern and the crack opening 
at the two respective locations . 

With the approach of t’he sub-zero temperatures* re¬ 
inforcing steel at Location VIII yielded in tension and the 
crack opened to an objectionable width ( an eighth of an inch) . 

At Location IX* the relative slab movement which accompanied 
the temperature drop prevented a large crack opening* and the 
reinforcing steel from straining past the yield point . 

The loss of bond at both locations extended to a 
point about 16 bar diameters from the instigated crack at 
both test sections. When the reinforcing steel strained beyond 
the yield point, the loss of bond at Location VIII extended to 
a point about 32 bar diameters from the instigated crack.

B. Reinforced Concrete Pavement with Joints Spaced at 30 Feet 

Section Type A-6 

The reinforced concrete pavement with contraction 
joints spaced at 30 foot intervals. Type A-6, 2,610 feet in 
length consists of a. six-inch slab reinforced in longitudinal 
direction with No. 4 intermediate grade deformed steel bars, 
comprising a 0.185$ of the cross-section area of the pavement 
(for full details see Plate 4). One test section referred to 
from here on as ’’Location X” was located at station 262+50. 

The pavement was poured at the test section on 
October 28, 1958* The first set of readings was taken about 
three hours after the finishing operation. These provided the 
basis for all subsequent strain calculations . 

A crack at the induced plane of weakness developed 
before the pavement was three days old . Measurements made 
3.2 days after construction indicated that strain in the rein¬ 
forcing steel reached 1,320 micro inches/inch and the width of 
the crack opened to 0.022 inches. The slab temperature at the 
time of reading was 45°F. Measurements were made 7*3 days after 
construction when the slab temperature was 30°F. The strain 
in the reinforcing steel reached 1,900 micro inches/inch and 
the width of the instigated crack increased to 0.048 inches. 
Measurements taken 6 hours later when the slab temperature 
dropped to 28°F. showed a considerable decrease in strain in the 
reinforcing steel and the width of the instigated crack indicat¬ 
ing that sufficient force was developed in the steel to cause 





















157 


movement of the slab. Subsequent measurements tend to indicate 
that width of the crack and strain in the reinforcing steel 
increased with a drop in temperature until a sufficient force 
was developed in the reinforcing steel at the crack to cause 
additional slab movement. Plates 10-7 and 10-8 verify this 
type of action. 

The loss of bond between the concrete and the rein¬ 
forcing bars extended to a point between 24 and 30 bar diameters 
on each side of the crack (Plates 10-3 to 10-6 inclusive) . Gages 
located on the bars at a distance greater than two feet on each 
side of the crack indicated some compression when the strain in 
the reinforcing steel at the crack remained in the low elastic 
range. 

Conclusions 

The loss of bond between concrete and the steel 
extended to a point about 24 bar diameters on each side of the 
instigated crack. 

The strain in the reinforcing bars reached the yield 
point range, at which point sufficient force was developed in 
the steel at the crack to cause initial movement, closing the 
crack. Subsequent to this, additional movement occurred when¬ 
ever the reinforcing steel was strained into high elastic range.

IX■ GENERAL OBSERVATIONS 

1. The first cracks developed due to shrinkage. 

2. Very few additional cracks developed as a result of 
extremely low temperatures. 

3. The average crack spacing throughout the entire continuously 
reinforced pavement as of March 7* 1959 was from eight to 
ten feet. 

4. At extremely low temperatures, cracks at some locations 
opened to widths exceeding one-i-eighth of an inch. 

5. The cracks at the induced planes of weakness developed 
three to five days after construction. 

6. • Results presented indicate that temperature was the most 

damaging influence to which the continuously reinforced 
concrete pavement was subjected. 

7. The concrete pavement was subjected to extreme temperature 
changes during its early life. 

8. On numerous occasions the curing compound was not applied 
until a few hours after the finishing operation. If concrete 
were allowed to cure until it gained sufficient strength 
before being subjected to extreme temperature changes, a 
more satisfactory bond would have formed between the concrete 
and the reinforcing steel, resulting in a more ideal crack 
pattern. 

9. Reinforcing steel having a higher yield point strain should 
give better service. 

10. It appears from the data that additional reinforcement is 
required in the intrados lane of the curve. This additional 1 
steel should be carried some distance along the tangent of 


each end of the curve. 











168 

11. The reinforcing steel spanning the crack yielded in tension 
due to temperature drop varying from 50 to 75 degrees 
Fahrenheit (See Appendix D). 

12. It is shown in Appendix E that in all section types a much 
higher percentage of reinforcing steel is required to cause 
temperature cracking of the pavement. 

13. It has been mentioned previously that yielding of the re¬ 
inforcement caused by extremely low temperature could be 
prevented by using a steel having a higher yield point. 

Or alternatively, yielding could be prevented if more re¬ 
inforcement were used. No relationship exists between 
strain in the reinforcing steel and the steel percentages. 
However, there is an indication that relationship exists 
between area of steel used and the strain in the steel.

The trend lines of Plate 11 indicate that pavement 
design should be based on the total area of the steel if yield¬ 
ing of the steel is to be prevented at shrinkage cracks. The 
slab thickness does not affect this part of design.

It is seen from Plate 11 that if yielding were to be 
prevented for a temperature drop of 95°^., 16.8 square inches 
of steel should have been provided in each section type. 
Expressing this in percent of the cross-section area of the 
pavement, then 0.84$ steel is required in a 7 inch slab and 
0.98$ steel is required in a 6 inch slab.

X. SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS 


1. Location I - Section Type B7-2 (7 inch slab, 0.y84$ Steel) 

The loss of bond between the reinforcing bars and the 
concrete extended to a point about 16 bar diameters from the 
instigated crack when the strain in the reinforcing steel was 
in the elastic range . Additional bond loss took place after 
the reinforcing bars yielded In tension. 

Reinforcing steel yielded in tension when the slab 
temperature dropped to -20°F. At this low temperature * the 
width of the instigated crack opened to l/l6th of an inch. 

An additional drop in temperature resulted in the crack 
opening to about l/8th of an inch and the reinforcing bars 
spanning the crack strained to 8,000 micro inches/inch. 

The use of a reinforcing steel having a yield point 
strain of 2,100 micro inches/inch would have prevented yielding 
of the steel bars at the cracks. As a result, the existing 
cracks would have not opened to such objectionable widths but 
more new cracks would probably have developed . 

Linear relationships existed within the elastic range 
of steel between strains in the reinforcing bars and slab 
temperature, strain and width of the crack, and width of the 
crack and temperature after the pavement was about four weeks 
old . 

2. Location II - Section Type B7-2 (7 inch slab, 0.784$ steel ) 

The loss of bond between the concrete and the rein¬ 
forcing bars extended to a point about 27 bar diameters from 
the instigated crack when the strain in the reinforcing bars

remained in the elastic range. After the bars yielded in 
tension additional loss of bond occurred . The reinforcing 
steel at the instigated crack started to yield at a slab 
temperature of about -10°F., at which temperature width of 
the instigated crack probably opened to l/l6th of an inch. 

When the temperature dropped to a low of -25°F. reinforcing 
bars at the crack strained far beyond the yield point of the 
steel and the width of the instigated crack exceeded l/8th 
of an inch. 

If a reinforcing steel having a yield point strain 
of 2,200 micro inches/inch had been used, no yielding would 
have taken place at a low in temperature of -25°F., and the 
width of the instigated crack would have remained within 
1/llth of an inch. 

A linear relationship existed within the elastic 
range of steel between strain in the reinforcing steel and 
slab temperature, strain and width of the crack, width of 
the crack and temperature after the pavement was about two 
weeks old . 

3. Location III - Section Type B7-1 (7 inch slab, 0.70-6'$ steel ) 

The loss of bond between the concrete and the steel 
bars extended to a point about 24 bar diameters from the 
induced plane of weakness . No additional loss of bond occurred 
after the reinforcing bars at the crack yielded in tension. 

The reinforcing steel at the instigated crack yielded 
in tension when the slab temperature dropped to about -15°F. 

At this low temperature the width of the instigated crack 
reached 1/32 of an inch. When the slab temperature dropped 








172 

to about -25°F ., the reinforcing steel strained far beyond 
the yield point and the width of the crack increased probably 
to l/l6th of an inch. 

The shrinkage crack which developed in the vicinity 
of the instigated crack had a considerable effect on the crack 
width opening at the induced plane of weakness . 

No yielding of the reinforcing bars would have taken 
place at the instigated crack at -25°F. temperature if a re¬ 
inforcing steel having a yield point strain of 2,300 micro 
inches/inch had been used. 

4. Location IV - Section Type B6-1 (6 inch slab, 0.715$ steel ) 

The lack of sufficient information, the development 
of a shrinkage crack close to the plane of weakness, coupled 
with a strange strain history at the instigated crack, does 
not permit the drawing of any definite conclusions at this 
time . 

The reinforcing bars started to yield at the south 
edge of the pavement before the 51-day measurements were taken 
during which time a low of -13°P. had been recorded at the 
Calgary airport. There is some evidence of bending in the 
horizontal plane. 

5. Location V - Section Type B6-1 (6 inch slab, 0.715^ steel ) 

As at Location IV, only limited information is avail¬ 
able . The data that are available indicate that reinforcing 
steel spanning the crack yielded in tension before the pave¬ 
ment was 50 days old. Some indications of bending action is 
also present at this location.

6. Location VI - Section Type B6-1 (6 inch slab, 0.715^ steel ) 

The gaged panel at Location VI was subjected to 
bending action when the reinforcing bars at the crack strained 
elastically. The reinforcing bars spanning the instigated 
crack started to yield before the pavement was 42 days old, 
during which time a low of -13°F. had been recorded at the 
Calgary airport. 

7. Location VII - Section Type B6-1 (6 inch slab, 0.715$ steel ) 

The reinforcing bars spanning the crack started to 
yield before the pavement was fifty days old . It is probable 
that the reinforcing steel began to yield within thirty-one 
days after construction during which time a low of -5°F. was 
recorded at the Calgary airport. The yield point strain of 
the reinforcing bars was probably reached when the slab 
temperature dropped to 5°^* and the width of the crack opened 
to about 1/20 of an inch. 

The reinforcing steel yielded in tension past the 
range of n SR-4' ! bakelite type gages when the pavement was 
subjected to an extremely low temperature and the instigated 
crack opened to a width exceeding 1/8 of an inch. 

If a reinforcing steel having a yield point strain 
of 3,100 micro inches/inch had been used, no yielding would 
have taken place at the cracks, additional cracks would have 
probably developed and the existing cracks would not have 
opened to such objectionable widths. 

8. Location VIII - Section Type B6-2 (6 inch slab, 0.815$ steel ) 

The loss of bond between the concrete and the rein¬ 


forcing bars extended to a point 16 bar diameters from the

instigated crack when the strain in the reinforcing steel 
remained within the elastic range . After the reinforcing 
bars spanning the crack strained past the yield point, the 
loss of bond increased to a point 24 bars diameters from 
the crack. 

The reinforcing steel spanning the crack started 
to yield when the slab temperature dropped to about -5°F. 
and the instigated crack opened to 1/25 of an inch. 

When the pavement was subjected to extremely low 
temperatures, the reinforcing bars strained past the range 
of the n SR-4" bakelite-type gages and the instigated crack 
opened to width exceeding 1/10 of an inch. 

If a reinforcing steel having a yield point strain 
of 2,700 micro inches/inch had been used, no yielding would 
have taken place at the instigated crack at the slab tempera¬ 
ture of -25°F.j and the crack would have opened to 1/20 of 
an inch, unless additional cracks were developed . 

9. Location IX - Section B6-2 (6 inch slab, 0.815$ steel ) 

The reinforcing steel at the instigated crack 
strained within its elastic limit. The strain in the rein¬ 
forcing bars reached 1,900 micro inches/inch when the slab 
temperature dropped to about -25°R. and the width of the 
instigated crack at this low temperature probably increased 
to 0.043 inches. 

The loss of bond extended to a point about 20 bar 
diameters from the crack. 

The strain in the reinforcing steel and width of the 


instigated crack increased at a decreasing rate for a given drop

in slab temperature. 

The shrinkage crack which developed several inches 
east of the induced crack had a measurable effect on the strain 
pattern in the reinforcing bars located in the south lane of 
the pavement. At extremely low temperatures, the strain in the 
reinforcing steel distributed itself more evenly along the 
instigated crack, and the shrinkage crack east of the induced 
plane of weakness became inactive. 

The length of the actively moving end extended some 
distance west of the test section from the expansion dam con¬ 
structed at the east end of the continuously reinforced concrete 
pavement.

XI. RECOMMENDATIONS 

In the course of strain measurements it was found 
that the ,f SR-4 n strain indicator responded "sluggishly" to any 
change in strain. No explanation was available for this strange 
phenomenon for some time. 

Experiments that were conducted at the University of 
Alberta revealed that when a capacitor was introduced into the 
electrical circuit, the "SR-4" strain indicator responded to 
change in strain in a similar manner as at the test site. 

Further investigation revealed that capacitance in the Wheat¬ 
stone Bridge Circuit affects the initial reading only, and 
does not influence the change in strain. When a capacitor 
of 220 u u f was introduced into an electrical circuit the 
initial strain reading on the gage was changed by 100 micro 
inches/inch, a capacitor of 10,000 u u f changed the reading 
by 200 micro inches/inch. By immersing 40 feet of lead wire 
in a pail of water it was found that a capacitance of 12,000 
u u f was developed. Therefore, the extreme conditions to 
which the lead wire might be subjected under the pavement would 
be a change in capacitance from 0 to 12,000 u u f, resulting in 
a maximum error of 200 micro inches/inch in strain measurements . 

In view of the fact that moisture in the granular 
base may vary considerably, particularly below the crack in the 
pavement, it is felt that for the best results lead wires con¬ 
necting the strain gages to the terminal box should be housed 
in a watertight conduit.

Terminal boxes buried in the ground had given very 
poor service. It is suggested that in future the terminal 
boxes be installed above the ground surface. 

Initial strain measurements should be made before 
placing of concrete or after the initial set of concrete. On 
occasions, readings taken immediately after the finishing 
operation have given ridiculous results. 

If at all possible, measurements should be taken 
every few hours throughout the day and night for the first few 
days after placing of concrete so that initial behaviour of 
the pavement could be determined. 

Useful information may be gained by making a complete 
observation of crack widths at selected locations other than at 
the test panel. 

Copper-constantan type temperature transducers were 
used to measure slab temperature at selected positions. Using 
this type of temperature gage it was necessary to measure cold 
junction temperature and the e.rn.f. produced. The cold junction 
temperature was measured using an ordinary mercury thermometer 
and the e.rn.f. was measured using a potentiometer. It was found 
that this method of securing temperature records was not very 
accurate and was time-consuming. Due to the difficulties en¬ 
countered In measuring the cold junction temperature and read¬ 
ing the potentiometer, particularly in the winter season, it is 
suggested that in future projects of this type temperature 
sensitive resistance-wire measuring device be used . 

This type of gage was designed and used successfully 


by the Continuous Pavement Research Group at the Lehigh University.

APPENDIX A 


APPLICATION AND WATERPROOFING OF ELECTRICAL STRAIN GAGES 







181 


APPENDIX A 

APPLICATION AND WATERPROOFING OF ELECTRICAL STRAIN GAGES 
(a) General Description 

Basically there are two general types of Baldwin 
"SR-4" strain gages: (l) gages made on paper base which is 
impregnated with nitrocellulose; (2) gages molded in bakelite 
resins . 

An electrical strain gage consists of a small grid 
of very fine wire which is either cemented to a paper base or 
bakelite resin base. Its principle of operation in measuring 
strain depends on the fact that the electrical resistance of 
the grid of wire varies directly as the strain the grid under¬ 
goes . If the gage is cemented firmly to a material, the fine 
wire grid will suffer the same strains as the material itself. 
By measuring the resistance changes of the grid by a sensitive 
galvonometer the actual strains in the material may be found. 
The strains are then converted to stresses by multiplying by 
the modulus of elasticity of the material. 

The gages used in this project were M SR-4 n made by 
Baldwin Southwank Locomotive Works, Philadelphia, U.S.A. The 
type of gages selected for this work were "AB-3" bakelite 
gages . The reason for selecting this type of gage was its 
proven stability under long time service in adverse climatic 
conditions and ability to withstand a moderate amount of abuse 
in installation and handling. A complete description of the 
method of applying those gages to steel surface is given by 
the makers in their bulletin No. 179* "The SR-4 Bonded 
Resistance Wire Strain Gauge i; , and need not be repeated here.

When properly attached, the strain gage grid is 
rigidly bonded to the steel (or other surface) and yet is 
electrically insulated from it. The gage will function 
satisfactorily as long as it remains completely dry. The. 
principle cause of instability is moisture which is absorbed 
into the body of the gage. The effects of moisture are: 

(a) dimensional changes of bonding medium and cement which 
cause resistance changes due to resulting strains set up in 
gage filament; (b) changes of resistance due to conductivity 
caused by absorbed moisture. A secondary cause of instability 
is the long time aging of bonding medium and cement. The lower 
limit of the electrical resistance against this type of leak¬ 
age is 50 megohms between grid and bar for absolutely reliable 
results. 

Several methods of waterproofing gages embedded in 

( 8 , 9 , 10 ) 

concrete have been developed by different investigators 
In a paper to the A.C.I.^^, two investigators of the U.S. 

Bureau of Reclamation, Denver, have listed requirements for 
an ideal type of "SR-4" gage protection, and then have given 
detailed description of two methods which they have successfully 
used . 

(b) Application of Gages to Reinforcing Bars 

After the bar deformations were removed and the 
surface areas at the gage locations were polished to a very 
smooth surface, these areas were covered with friction tape 
and the bars were stored awaiting the shipment of strain gages. 







183 


Before application of strain gages, the surfaces 
at gage locations were polished once more and thoroughly cleaned 
with acetone. The gages were checked for resistance and the 
under side of the gages were cleaned with acetone before appli¬ 
cation of cement . 

In applying the gages to bars of circular cross- 
section, some difficulty was experienced in holding the gage 
centreline truly parallel to the direction of stress after 
application of pressure by means of specially designed clamps . 
Waterproofing of Gages 

After application of heat curing process and subse¬ 
quent cooling off, the waterproofing process may begin. The 
following list of steps contains minimum procedure necessary 
to obtain reasonably good results . Omission of any one of 
them may be sufficient cause to spoil a gage location. 

(1) After the bars cool off, apply a coat of Gaco Primer which 
prevents any moisture from the atmosphere being absorbed 
by the gage . It prevents the clean surface of the bar 
from rusting and provides good bond between neoprene and 
the steel. A second coat of primer should be applied 
about one hour before application of neoprene . 

(2) Test the leakage resistance and true resistance of the 
applied gage. Use a maximum test voltage of 45 volts 
to measure leakage resistance, and a Wheatstone bridge 
to measure true resistance. A leakage resistance of 
less than 50 megohms and a true resistance varying by 
more than 1.0 ohms from the listed resistance indicates 
that the gage is of doubtful usefulness and should be 


replaced . 




















■ 








’ 












184 


( 3 ) Clean all excess Duco cement from the bar surrounding 
the gage. 

(4) Bend the lead out wires of the gage back over the gage. 

The lead out wires must be insulated from the steel surface. 

(5) Solder the insulated lead wires to the gage leads. The 
insulation of these wires should be cut back by no more 
than \ inch. Soldered connections should be smooth. 

Sharp projections must be avoided . The insulated lead 
wires may be either the single-strand or multi-strand 
type; single-stand wire is preferred. The insulation 
itself must be high quality rubber or plastic insulation. 
Lacquered fibre insulation is not acceptable. 

(6) To prevent damage to the gages by pulling on the leads 
tie the leads to the bar with fibreglass tape. 

(7) Apply four to six coats of neoprene. Each coat should 
be allowed to dry thoroughly before application of 
successive coats. After application of the last coat, 
apply the heat curing process for at least 12 hours at 
a temperature of 175 °^. 

(8) Apply a coat of petrolastic asphalt and apply heat until 
the surface is perfectly smooth and free from air pockets. 

(9) Apply a layer of electrician tape over the layer of petro¬ 
lastic asphalt. Petrolastic asphalt in room temperature 
becomes sticky; a coat of electrician’s tape provides 
clean handling of bars.

(d) Discussion of Method 

The method as described above is rather slow and 
time consuming, especially if only several gages can be water¬ 
proofed at one time. However, if many gages can be water¬ 
proofed at one time, the time is well spent. 

This method is especially suited for field instal¬ 
lations and should be excellent for laboratory investigations, 
especially if a large number of gage installations is contem¬ 
plated . 

After six months of service a large majority of gages 
have given good service. 

As mentioned before, other methods of waterproofing 
have been developed. The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, Denver, 
describe two methods. In the first method 3M - Adhesive, which 
is air-setting rubber cement, is used with Tygonite N-15-B 
cement. The second method described by the Bureau of Reclama¬ 
tion involves vulcanizing a neoprene rubber housing over the 
gage to the steel bar. 

Another method is described in a paper in the S.E.S.A. 
Proceedings^). The procedure is somewhat similar to the 
Tygonite Method, but Petrosene B Wax is used as the chief water¬ 
proofing agent. Long-term leakage resistance is claimed in a 
field test. 

The results of all long-term tests are at present 
rather doubtful because of the tendency of the Duco Cement 
holding the gage to the steel to creep. This, of course, causes 
an extra strain in the gage not undergone by the material, 
causing resistance change readings to be not truly representa¬ 
tive of strains in the test material.

APPENDIX C 


DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF TEMPERATURE MEASURING GAGE 
















201 


APPENDIX C 

DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF TEMPERATURE MEASURING GAGE 

The temperature sensitive element consisted of approxi¬ 
mately 33 inches of No. Forty, 99*8$ nickel wire with Formvar 
insulation. This wire was cut to a length having a resistance 
of 17 ohms at a temperature of 70° F « A loop was formed in the 
wire and the free ends were soldered to standard two-conductor 
gage leads. Only 1/8 of an inch of insulation was removed from 
the ends of the wires, and with a small soldering iron it was 
possible to make a sound solder joint without melting the 
adjacent insulation. 

The attached loop was then wrapped around the two gage 
leads approximately 1/4 of an inch back from their ends, and the 
end of the loop was held in place with a drop of plastic cement. 
The comparitive stiffness of the heavier gage lead wires prevented 
electrical shorting of the soldered ends until the water-proofing 
and protective coatings were applied to the gage . 

The completed gage was only 3/16 of an inch in dia¬ 
meter and provided a means of obtaining temperature measurements 
at a precise location within the pavement structure. 

In order to use these gages as an active arm of a 
120 ohms-per-arm bridge circuit, it was necessary to add a fixed 
resistance of 103 ohms in series with 17 ohms provided by the 
temperature sensitive nickel wire. 

The fixed resistors made with No. 34 cotton insulated 
Advance wire having a resistance of 7*52 ohms per foot. They 
were wound on fibre glass cores and given a protective coating

of insulating varnish. Several of these resistors were tested 
and found to have no significant sensitivity to temperature 
changes between 30°F. and 140°F. Since the nickel wire had a 
nominal temperature coefficient of resistance of 0 . 006 , while 
at the Advance wire was only 0.0002, it seemed reasonable to 
assume that any change in the resistance of the 120-ohm circuit 
would be due to the temperature sensitivity of the nickel wire 
in the transducer. 

Extreme care in the construction of these gages 
enabled the use of the same calibration factor with an entire 
lot of 70 gages and with less than Vf> differential error within 
a temperature range of 0°F. and 120°F. When used with standard 
120-ohm strain gage instruments, 175 micro inches/inch of indi¬ 
cated strain was equal to 1°F. change of temperature at the 
gage. 

V/hen an electric current flows in a circuit, heat is 
generated by the resistance of the conducting materials. With 
constant input voltage, the temperature of this material will 
rise until the dissipation of the heat by radiation or thermal 
conductivity is equal to the heat that is generated. It was 
found that this phenomenon caused a sudden rise in the indi¬ 
cated temperature from each of the gages as they were switched 
into the instrument circuit, but that after about 10 seconds, 
this "self-heating" stabilized and reliable measurements could 
be obtained . 

All gages were calibrated at a known temperature 
after they were attached to the terminal board at the construc¬ 
tion site. Before installation into the pavement, they were

submerged in an insulated water bath and checked with a 
laboratory mercury-column thermometer. The indicated resis¬ 
tance of the gage at this static temperature formed the basis 
for all subsequent measurements .

Since only very small movements take place between 
the concrete slab and the base in the central portions of the 
continuously reinforced concrete pavement, and since these 
movements are confined to portions of the slab in the immediate 
vicinity of the cracks, it may be assumed that sections midway 
between the cracks are stationary or fixed (Fig. a, Plate 13). 

It has been pointed out that the reinforcing steel 
in the continuously reinforced concrete pavement yielded in 
tension at the cracks for a given temperature drop. As will

be seen* had the steel not been embedded in concrete, the same 
temperature change would not have produced yielding. The 
reason for different behaviour for these two cases may be 
explained by considering them in detail. 

1. Reinforcing steel bar 10 feet in length fixed at both 
ends (Fig. b, Plate 13). 

Assume = 6.5 x 10”° in./in./°F. 

T = 100°F. 

£ 

E s = 30 x 10 psi. 

The unit strain in the steel due to 100°F. temperature drop 
e - 6.5 x 10 -6 x 100 
e = 6.5 x 10~ 4 
Therefore unit stress 

f s - 30 x 10 6 x 6.5 x 10 -4 

f s = 19*500 psi. which is much below the yield 
point stress of the reinforcing steel. 

2. Reinforced concrete slab 10 feet in length fixed at both 

ends (Fig. a, Plate 13).

Li = 28.5 inches. 

If the reinforced concrete slab were allowed to contract 
due to the temperature drop, the change in length due to 
100°F. temperature drop would be 

- 6.5 x 10 -6 x 100 x 120 

- 0.072 inches. 

If sufficient force were applied to bring the slab to its 

original length, the unit strain in the steel at the crack 

e = - 0.072 = 0.00252 inches/inch

and the stress in the steel at the crack 

f s = 30 x 10 6 x 2.52 x 10"3 

f s s 75*000 psi. which is above the yield 
point stress of the steel used. 

Stress in the reinforcing steel reduces rapidly as the 
distance from the crack increases. The stress in the reinforc¬ 
ing steel remains constant at points where strain in concrete 
remains equal to the strain in the steel (Pig. d and Fig. f, 

Plate 13) . 

The above calculations indicate that almost all of the longi¬ 
tudinal deformation of the slab caused by the temperature drop 
takes place in the reinforcing steel at the crack.

reduced by using higher tensile strength steel and lower tensile
