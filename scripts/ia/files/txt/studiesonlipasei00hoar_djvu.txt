Introduction 

In 1911, Rona and Michaelis (26) described a 
method for the estimation of ester and fat hydro¬ 
lysis by blood and serum which depended on the 
measurement of the amount of surface tension lower¬ 
ing. In 1924, further work was done by Rona (27) 
in collaboration with Lasnitzki in which they evolved 
a manometric method for the determination of lipase 
in body fluids and tissues. Cherry and Crandall(4) 
in 1932 had described a modification of Loevenhart's 
method (18) for the determination of serum lipase, 
using olive oil for substrate. In 1940, Scoz (29) 
developed a titrimetric determination for the lipase 
activity of guinea pig plasma using tributyrin for 
the substrate. 

The term "esterase” is also used to refer to 
enzyme hydrolysis of fatty acid esters as well as 
the splitting of a carboxylic ester linkage. Ref¬ 
erence in the literature is made to three classes, 
depending on the efficiency with which various sub¬ 
strates are hydrolyzed, their distribution in tissues, 
and the effect of inhibitors upon their activity.These 
classes are cholinesterase, non-specific esterase, and 
lipase. Cholinesterase is identified by its ability to 
hydrolyze esters of choline, but this specificity is

not absolute. Its distribution in tissues as deter¬ 
mined by both assay (28) and by histoohemical methods 
(12) is quite different from that of lipase and non¬ 
specific esterase. Finally, the inhibition of choline- 
esterase with the addition of minute amounts of eserine 
(10~5 m) further Identifies it (19,25). Three methods 
recommended for the determination of serum lipase use 
the substrates tributyrin (10), olive-oil (4) and 
sorbitan esters of long chain fatty acids (l). A histo- 
chemical method to show the existence of lipase by 
using tristearin (13) demonstrates an enzyme in tissues 
containing ’’esterases" by the fact that these tissues 
also hydrolyze p-nitrophenylpropionate (14), and naphthyl 
acetate (22). Data are found to show that there is over¬ 
lapping in the hydrolytic properties of these enzymes 
for nearly all carboxylic esters. 

Between 1940 and 1943 there was an endeavour to 
show the relationship between serum lipase levels and 
disease of the pancreas. In 1948, G-oldstein, Epstein, 
and Roe (10) described their simplified method for the 
determination of serum lipase, using aqueous tributyrin 
as substrate. 

Lipase is constantly present in small amounts 
in the blood stream, the lipolytic activity remain¬ 
ing relatively constant in normal states of health. 

The activity of the enzyme may vary considerably

between species and between different subjects of 
the same species, and seems to be unaffected by 
starvation or by some types of foods. According to 
Comfort (5) the pancreas is indicated as one poss¬ 
ible source of serum lipase. Several reasons for 
this are advanced (15)• Experimental pancreatect¬ 
omy done on animals has caused temporarily decreased 
enzyme levels. Ligation of pancreatic ducts has 
caused a rapid rise in lipase levels within a few 
hours. These high values have returned to normal 
within eight to fifteen days. In pancreatitis in¬ 
duced by the injection of bile into pancreatic ducts 
of animals, there has been a marked increase in the 
concentration of serum lipase, causing high values 
within a few hours, which returned to normal in seven 
to ten days, even with pathological changes in the 
pancreas. According to Singer (30 ), the serum enzyme 
is calcium-requiring and it may or may not contain the 
sulfhydryl group depending on the particular source 
of the enzyme. This fact is important in activation 
and inhibition studies on serum lipase. 

This investigation is concerned with the study 
of the ’’esterase” system found in blood serum,which 
hydrolyzes fatty acid esters, and particularly with

respect to the serum of the albino rat,Wistar strain. 
There are many papers in the literature referring to 
this enzyme system as serum lipase, serum esterase, 
and pseudo or non-specific cholinesterase (20). 

Because fatty acid esters are readily hydrolyzed by 
it, and because the term “esterase” can include 
phosphatases etc, the system will be referred to as 
serum lipase. 

Before beginning the study of the lipase activity 
of rat serum under various experimental conditions,it 
was necessary to develop a simple micro-technique.In 
addition, it was essential to obtain the normal range 
of activity of the enzyme for various substrates. 

The micro-technique was based on methods used by Scoz 
(29), Cherry and Crandall (4), Wynne (31)* and Goldstein 
et al (10), and used in the study of the enzyme activity 
under various physiological and pathological conditions 
in experimental animals.

II, EXPERIMENTAL 
A# Collection of rat serum 

Samples of blood were collected between the 
hours of 8:00 a.m. and 9 %00 a.m., as a routine prac¬ 
tice although subsequent experiments to find hourly- 
variations in lipase activity showed very little 
change during the day. Ten male rats on normal diet 
were segregated and six drops of blood collected from 
the tail of each animal at five periods during one day. 
Blood from five animals was pooled into one centrifuge 
tube. Table I shows normal variations of serum lipase 
activity of these rats during a twelve hour period. 
There were no variations found before or after the 
consumption of food.

Blood was obtained from the tail by "milking" 
into very fine specially designed centrifuge tubes: 
the total amount of blood removed from an individual 
animal not exceeding 0*4 ml* The tubes were allowed 
to stand 5 to 15 minutes, then they were centrifuged 
at 3000 rpm for 5 minutes* The serum, (average amount 
s 0*2 ml*), was removed by means of a micro-pipette 
and stored in a 5 nil* test tube* This was stoppered 
immediately and placed in storage at 5°&* For the 
kinetics studies, a group containing from ten to 
twenty animals were exsanguinated by decapitation, 
the blood was pooled and serum samples were obtained 
following centrifugation* An average amount of five 
milliliters of blood was obtained from each animal, 
thus providing approximately from one and one-half 
to two milliliters of serum. 

Determinations were usually done immediately 
or within three hours of the time of collection of 
the sample. However, a sample kept over one hundred, 
days showed no change in lipolytic activity even 
though some of the constituents of the serum had 
precipitated.

B. Reagent s 

(1) Sodium hydroxide . 0.Q25N 

One gram of reagent sodium hydroxide was 
dissolved in 20 ml. of distilled water and diluted 
to make one liter. This solution was standardized 
against 0.02N potassium acid phthalate using phenol- 
phthalein as an indicator. 

(2) Sodium diethylbarbiturate.(Veronal) 0.1M 

10.63 grams of sodium diethlybarbiturate 
were dissolved in distilled water and diluted to 
500 ml. 

(3) Hydrochloric acid Q.1H 

8.69 ml. concentrated reagent hydrochloric 
acid was diluted to one liter. This solution was 
standardized against the standard 0.025N sodium 
hydroxide using phenolphthalein as an indicator. 

(4) Sodium diethylbarbiturate buffers 

Sodium diethylbarbiturate 0.1M and hydro¬ 
chloric acid 0.1N were added together in quantities 
sufficient to produce a total of 100 ml. of buffer. 

Three solutions were adjusted by means of a 
Beckmann pH meter to 7*4; 7*8; and 8.2 pH units res¬ 
pectively. These buffers were prepared fresh weekly. 

(5) Ethyl alcohol Inactivator 

Commercial ethyl alcohol of 95^ strength was 

used.

An important factor in the choice of a buffer 
is its ability to prevent a pH drift from the opt¬ 
imum due to acid production during the digestion 
period. Several buffers were tried; the phthalate- 
phosphate-borate buffers of Clarke were originally 
used but were found highly unsatisfactory for the 
purpose because they gave very inconsistent res¬ 
ults with large pH variations. Most satisfactory 
were the sodium diethylbarbiturate-hydrochloric 
acid buffers and the range covered in determining 
pH optima varied from pH 6.8 to pH 8.6. The veronal 
buffers did not show any inhibitory effect on lipo¬ 
lytic activity, this being in agreement with the 
findings of dick (8). The changes in pH during 
hydrolysis of tributyrin,tripropionin, and ethyl 
butyrate, were found to be 0.15, 0.35, and 0.25 pH 
units respectively. The amount of the veronal buffer 
required in a digestion mixture varied with the sub¬ 
strate used: 1.0 ml. for tributyrin; 2.0 ml. for 
tripropionin; and 3*0 ml. for ethyl butyrate.(Refer 
section D. part two, for method).

(2) Time-activity relationship for trlbutvrin,tripropionin . 

and ethyl butyrate . 

The time interval chosen for enzymatic lipolysis 
was kept within the linear part of the time-activity 
curves, as shown in Figure 2, This minimized the pH 
drift away from the optimum and the effect of enzyme 
deterioration during hydrolysis# Accordingly, the 
most suitable period for hydrolysis was found to be 
30 minutes for tributyrin, 15 minutes for tripropionin 
and 30 minutes for ethyl butyrate. These intervals were 
long enough in each instance, to liberate sufficient 
acid to be estimated titrimetrically. The curves shown 
in Figure 2 also indicate the relative rate of lipo¬ 
lysis for each substrate, and the relative ease with 
which each substrate is split* Tripropionin is hyd¬ 
rolyzed; more readily by the enzyme in a given time 
period of fifteen minutes, than are ethyl butyrate or 


tributyrin,

chosen as representing a concentration very close 
to the saturation point of the enzyme. The curve 
for tributyrin shows very little change in units

0*001 ml. to 0.05 ml. Triproplonin shows a flattening 
out of the curve beyond the optimum and consistently 
high values near the optimum due to the possible 
saponification at an alkaline pH. The ethyl butyrate 
curve shows more significant changes in activity 
with variation in substrate concentration.The amount 
of substrate hydrolyzed by normal adult rat serum 
lipase is approximately 6 % for tributyrin, 7 % for 
tripropionin, and 12$ for ethyl butyrate under the 
experimental conditions. Using tributyrin as an 
example, these percentages were calculated as follows: 

Tributyrin Mol wt = 300 

Density = 1.052 

Substrate added s 0.02 ml. = 0.02 gm or 20 mgm. 

Average titration » 0.5 ml. of 0.025N NaOH. 

1 liter 0.025N NaOH contains 1 gm NaOH. 

Therefore 1 ml. (average titration) * 0.5 mgm. NaOH.

acid * 120 gm NaOH. 

20 mgm. require 8 mgm. NaOH.

Note:Due to the subsequent acceptance of a manuscript for 
publication in Canadian Journal of Research, it was 
necessary to show the enzyme concentration-activity 
relationship for the three substrates. This work has 
been included on page 55 under Addendum part IV.

D. Micro-method for the estimation of serum lipase 

using; three substrates . 

The micro-method as adapted for tributyrin 
will be described in detail and any necessary mod¬ 
ifications for tripropionin(P) and ethyl butyrate 
(EB) will be described and indicated in brackets. 

Micro-KjeIdahl tubes of approximately 5 nil. 
capacity are used for the enzyme determinations. 

Into one of these tubes are pipetted 0,10 ml, serum, 
0,20 ml. distilled water, and 1.0 ml. buffer of pH 
8.2 ( P - 2.0 ml. buffer pH 7.8; EB = 3*0 ml. buffer 
pH 7*4). The mixture is warmed to 37°C and then 0.020 
ml. tributyrin (P - 0 , 025 . ml.; SB = 0.015 ml.), 
previously warmed to 37°C, is added with rapid shaking. 
The contents of the tube are mechanically agitated for 
30 minutes ( P ■ 15 minutes; EB = 30 minutes), at 
37°& on a Warburg shaker at a rate of 120 swings a 
minute, which maintains the substrate in a finely 
dispersed state. The pH of the contents of the exper¬ 
imental tube at the end of 30 minutes is 7.9* but the 
average of the initial and terminal pH values is 8.05, 
which is considered a better representation of the 
situation. 

Lipase activity is terminated and the serum 
proteins are precipitated by the addition of 3*0 ml. 

95 % ethyl alcohol (£- 5 ml; EB - 8 ml.) The mixture

is centrifuged and the supernatant is poured into a 
50 ml* erlenmeyer flask, which is stoppered at once 
to minimize the absorption of carbon dioxide. The 
contents of the flask are titrated with 0 . 025 N 
sodium hydroxide, using phenolphthalein as an ind¬ 
icator, to a faint but persistent pink color. 

A control tube is used, which is identical with 
the experimental tube except that the serum is boiled 
for 30 seconds before the buffer and substrate are 
added. 

Enzyme activity is measured by the difference 
between the titration values of the experimental and 
control tubes* The lipase activity of the serum in 
units is equivalent to the number of ml* of 0 . 025 N 
sodium hydroxide required to neutralize the amount 
of fatty acid set free by the enzyme contained in 
100 ml* serum under the above conditions. One ml* of 
0 . 025 N base is equivalent to one lipase unit. 

Replicates on the same serum, using the simple 
and rapid micro-method, have repeatedly shown good 
agreement well within the limits of 5 % experimental 


error

E Activation and Inhibition. 

The accelerating or retarding effect of a limited 
number of substances on the activity of serum lipase,using 
tributyrin substrate, was investigated. Solutions of the 
substances used were pipetted into the experimental tubes 
in place of the 0.2 ml. water which was usually added,and 
the tubes were incubated with the serum-buffer mixture 
for 10 - 15 minutes before the addition of tributyrin.The 
results are summarized in Table II.

The activation of lipase indicated in Table II by 
calcium chloride is in conformity with the findings of 
Kraut,Welscher, and Htlgel(17) ? who noted an increase in 
hydrolysis of pancreatic lipase at pH 8.9 when calcium 
chloride was added. The same authors report an activation 
by sodium glycocholate. Sodium taurocholate (not shown in 
table) was tried but no activation was obtained and other

factors interfered, upsetting the determination. 
However, these findings are in agreement with 
Parfentjev, Devrient, and Sokoloff (23) for rabbit 
serum lipase. A more recent paper by Nachlas, and 
Seligman (22). uses this inhibition factor as a 
means of distinguishing between serum "esterase 11 and 
serum "lipase". The "esterase" is inhibited by sodium 
taurocholate, but the "lipase" is activated by this 
compound. An appreciable inhibition was produced 
with eserine, using a concentration somewhat greater 
than that of 10”^M which Mendel, Mundell, and Rudney 
(19) have shown to be sufficient to inhibit completely 
the cholinesterases of guinea-pig plasma. A very 
marked decrease in hydrolysis followed the addition 
of hexaethyl tetraphosphate. DuBois and Mangun (6) 
have obtained 60 % inhibition of rat serum cholin¬ 
esterase using this same inhibitor at a concentration 
Of 10" 7 M. 

Almost complete inhibition of the enzyme was 
produced by means of sodium fluoride. This is an indi¬ 
cation, according to Singer (30), that serum lipase 
is a calcium-requiring enzyme. Evidence in favor of

(from 620 to 150 units lipase/100 ml*)* In another 
tube the enzyme was incubated for 30 minutes with 
7.4 x 10~ 2 M sodium fluoride, and then 3*4 x 10“ 2 M

The numbers of animals for the latter two sub¬ 
strates are not large, but they are sufficient to show 
that the hydrolysis of tripropionin (in a 15 minute dig¬ 
estion period) is much greater than for tributyrin or for 
ethyl butyrate(both with 30 minute digestion periods).

Tributyrin was used as the only substrate, for the 
majority of the experimental investigations,for sev¬ 
eral reasons. In the first instance, the work involved 
in setting up multiple experiments for each substrate 
would far outweigh the value of the data obtained,and 
at the same time would narrow the field of investigation. 
In the second instance, neither sufficient animals nor 
cage space was available at the times required. 

As shown in the data of Table III there is no 
significant difference between the lipase values obtained 
for male and female rats. Variations in lipase levels 
were followed for two weeks for each substrate, and the 
data are presented in Table IV.

It was noticed that daily withdrawals of 
blood from the animals would cause the lowering 
of lipase values ( due to exsanguination),therefore 
samples for tests were taken only every second 
day, and the results were averaged for each week* 
Food was kept before the animals at all times* 

There was a certain fluctuation in values for indiv¬ 
idual animals, but the mean value generally remained 
within plus or minus one hundred units range*

Table V presents the serum tributyrinase 
levels in rats ranging in age from two days to 
thirty-three days. It was found that a low lipase 
level exists soon after birth, increasing to the 
normal adult level by the fourth week.

B, The effect of barbiturate Injections on rat serum 

lipase* 

Lipase values, following the use of sodium 
isoamylethyl barbiturate for anaesthesia during cas¬ 
tration and ovariectomy,were checked. The animals were 
given the usual anaesthetic dosage. The lipase levels 
were obtained before the injection and for Wo periods 
following complete recovery from anaesthesia. Eight 
adult animals were used. The normal lipase values were 
first obtained, and then each animal was subcutaneously 
injected with 10 mgm./lQO gm. body weight, of a 10 percent 
solution of Sodium amytal Lilly 

All eight animals were anaesthesitized within 
fifteen minutes after injection. They were awake a.nd 
normally active again within three hours. The mean 
lipase value before injection was found to be 556 lipase 
units/ 100 ml. serum ( range 400-750 ). Four hours after 
injection, the mean value was 576 lipase units. These 
results indicate that the use of Sodium amytal as an 
anaesthetic has no effect upon the lipase values. This 
provides proof of no effect of barbiturates on serum 
lipase in "vivo 11 , and early experiments (see page 10) 
show no effect on using barbiturates in “vitro 11 .

III. 

C. Alloxan Diabetes in Rats 

(l) Method of Induction of alloxan diabetes. 

Alloxan monohydrate(Eastman Kodak Company), 
is readily soluble in water. A 3$ solution was 
freshly prepared for each experiment. 

Capsey (3) found that fasting the animals 
for a period of forty-eight hours prior to inj¬ 
ection increased their susceptibility to alloxan, 
but also greatly increased the mortality rate. In 
these tests, it was found that overnight starvation 
provided a lower mortality rate with a higher incid¬ 
ence of diabetes. Capsey found that, of one hundred 
and fifty animals injected, ninety percent became 
diabetic. Of these, twenty-seven percent died in 
the first three or four days, nine percent developed 
a transitory diabetes, and fifty-two percent became 
permanently diabetic. Our results generally followed 
this same trend, and in the earlier tests, the incid¬ 
ence of permanently diabetic animals was much higher. 

the mortality rate among the animals was moderate. 

*■ 

In the first group of ten animals, the rate was 30$, 
in the second group 40$ and in the final group 2$ 
with 2$ refractory animals. The animals which became 
diabetic following the alloxan injections showed many

of the symptoms commonly associated with diabetes 
mellitus. Blood sugar values ranged from 300 to 500 
mgm. per hundred milliliters of blood, after the first 
twenty-four hours, with accompanying glycosuria, pro¬ 
portional to the extent of hyperglycemia. Marked poly¬ 
dipsia and polyuria were evident, urine volume incr¬ 
easing to ten times normal in some animals. The blood 
was thick and dark suggesting hemoconcentration. The 
serum was very lipemic during the first week but in 
many cases this disappeared when the diabetes became 
fully established. 

Approximately one-third of body weight was lost 
during the first month of diabetes. Some rats exhibited 
large gangrenous skin lesions, and most animals developed 
cataracts after six or eight weeks. 

(2)♦ Alterations in blood glucose in alloxan diabetes. 

Injections of alloxan have been shown to induce 
a three phase change of blood sugar level. 

(a) Initial hyperglycemia. 

(b) Secondary hypoglycemia. 

(c) Final hyperglycemia. 

A marked hypoglycemic phase is difficult to 
demonstrate but the findings of Capsey provide some

evidence of a reduction in blood glucose level, 
five to six hours following injection of alloxan* 

With a normal blood glucose level of 123 mgm. percent, 
it has been shown that following alloxan, in 24 hours 
the blood glucose has risen to 380 mgm. percent, an 
increase of 209 percent. In two weeks a permanent 
high range is reached with an average value of 444 mgm. 
percent, or an increase of 264 percent from normal. 

There is general agreement that the permanent 
hyperglycemia results from loss of insulin production 
by the pancreas, due to selective destruction of the 
ft -cells of the islets of Langerhans, by alloxan.Direct 
assay of the organ has shown a reduced insulin content. 
The hypoglycemia is attributed to the liberation of 
performed insulin by the degenerating islet cells. 

(3). Alterations in serum lipase concentration 

Alterations In serum lipase activity following 
the injection of alloxan have been observed in approx¬ 
imately fifty rats. The serum lipase level Increases 
by the fourth day and continues to rise until a steady 
high range is reached by the sixteenth day. This has 
also been shown in lipase determinations on the sera 
of four to seven month diabetic animals. The lipase 
units were found to be in the same range that is 
reached when the diabetic state has become fully estab¬ 
lished in the rat. There is a rapid progressive rise in 
blood sugar, which exceeds 400 mgm. percent at the end 
of two days and is maintained thereafter with only

slight fluctuations* 

For trlbutyrin, an increase of 49^ above the 
normal lipase activity was obtained on the sixteenth 
day; for tripropionin 32 ^; and for ethyl butyrate 39$>* 

The ranges, mean values, and percent increase over 
the normal, are shown in Table VI for the three sub¬ 
strates used* (see page 28). 

The elevated serum lipase values showed a sim¬ 
ilarity in trend with serum alkaline phosphatase values 
as described by Capsey. However,evidence indicates that 
the thrum lipase is not as sensitive to pathological 
and physiological variations over a short period of time, 
as is the cas^ with other serum esterases* 

Blood glucose was determined by the micro-method 
of Reinecke (24). 

(4) The effect of insulin on serum lipase levels. 

According to Capsey, the glycosuria and hyper¬ 
glycemia which develop in alloxan diabetes are readily 
controlled with insulin* A single subcutaneous injection 
of 0.4 units crystalline zinc insulin* restored blood 
sugar to within normal levels in 90 minutes* This was 
accompanied by a thirty percent decline in acid and alk¬ 
aline phosphatase levels, but this single injection had no 
observable effect on serum lipase levels. 

*Insulin dilution: 1 ml. containing 40 I.U* was diluted 
to 20 ml. with Q.9% saline acidified to pH 2.4 with one 
drop concentrated hydrochloric acid to 100 ml. saline.

Repeated administration of insulin depressed 
the blood sugar to hypoglycemic levels in animals 
without food for the duration of the test but only 
slightly lowered the sugar from diabetic levels in 
animals kept on a normal diet. Sugar values returned 
to original diabetic level within twenty four hours 
following withdrawal of the insulin treatment. 

The fall in serum lipase, following prolonged 
insulin injection can be explained on the basis of a 
return to normal glucose metabolism with consequent

reduction in the production of acetoacetic and 
^.-hydroxy butyric acids. A factor that disting¬ 
uishes the diabetic state in the human and in the 
rat is found in the ability of the rat to live? for 
extended periods on a normal diet. The metabolism 
of the rat may accommodate a state of hyperketosis, 
whereas the human is restricted to a special diet, 
even with the insulin treatment. 

The results of the first insulin test as 
shown in Table VII are not as conclusive as the 
final 43$ reduction obtained in lipase levels from 
the second insulin test shown in Table VIII. In the 
first case, the animals were starved for twenty-one 
hours and the blood sugars of some were depressed to 
hypoglycemic levels due to a starvation effect exist¬ 
ing with the insulin effect. Added to this was the 
effect caused by the withdrawal of blood of approx¬ 
imately one milliliter of blood, or about one-sixth of 
the animal 9 s total blood volume withdrawn. On the 
basis of these interpretations and also as a check 
on the depression of the lipase values, a second 
test was devised, that extended over a much longer 
period, with only two samples of blood withdrawn 
from each animal every 24 hours, giving a total of 
six bleedings for the three days. In addition, the

animals were kept on normal checker rations for 
the duration of the experiment. This would explain 
the relatively diabetic blood glucose values shown 
in Table VIII since the ingestion of food would 
tend to overshadow the effect of the insulin in 
depressing the blood glucose level. As has been 
indicated, this did not affect the lowering of 
the lipase values.

D. The effect of orchldectomy on serum lipase , 

(l) Castration levels In adult male rats. 

Twenty normal adult male rats were castrated. 
Four animals died and the remainder were divided 
into two groups of eight animals. Serum lipase det¬ 
erminations were done on each group before the cast¬ 
ration and for various intervals following, up to 
thirty-five days. In the first group a check on lipase 
level was made at the seventy-five day post-operative 
period (not shown in table). A record was kept of 
the weights and food consumption of each animal 
during the entire period. The mean weight gain in 30 
days was 44 grams, with an average daily increase of 
1.76 grams. The average consumption per day was 24.5 
gms. 

The effects of orchldectomy on the serum lipase 
levels are presented in Table IX for the first group 
of animals and in Table X for the second group.

A 24 percent decrease in serum lipase was ob¬ 
served in the first group of animals by the tenth 
day following operation. This level gradually ret¬ 
urned to within the normal range by the thirty-fifth 
day* In the second group this initial drop was more 
pronounced and was apparent on the fifth post-oper¬ 
ative day. 

At first these depressions in lipase levels 
from the normal were thought due in some measure, to 
the effect of the barbiturate used for anaesthesia. 
This idea was rejected following the results of the 
test for barbiturate effect ( see page 23)* Therefore 
there seems to be some indication of a hormonal effect 
caused by the loss of the testicular secretions.Since 
the depression disappears within a month following 













orchidectomy, it is possible that the gonadotrophic 
hormones of the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland 
influence the recovery of the lipase level. A further 
possibility was the effect of operative bleeding on 
the enzyme concentration in the serum. Loss of 
blood during the operations however, was kept at 
a minimum. A check on the hemoglobin levels of 
several of the animals, chosen at random during the 
period when lipolysis returned to normal, revealed 
no decrease in hemoglobin percentages. Therefore 
the depression is not accounted for by these factors. 

(2) Effects of hormone injection on serum lipase of 

normal and orchidectomized rats. 

Three hormones were used, one hormone to each 
of three groups of animals. Each group consisted of 
five control animals and five castrates. The substan¬ 
ces used were testosterone propionate, oestradiol di¬ 
propionate, and dietjpyl stilboestrol. The inject- 
ions and serum lipase determinations were continued 
for a period of fourteen days. Androgenic and oestro¬ 
genic substances were injected into the rats.

25 mgm. vials of testosterone propionate in 
oil were diluted to 10 ml. with peanut oil. I mgm. of 
this dilution was Injected subcutaneously into each

(Hi) Diethyl stilboestrol. 

The dilution of this hormone was in the 
same proportions as the previously discussed 
substance. Each rat received 0,1 mgm. daily,The 
results of this test were quite interesting and are 
presented in Table XII (see page 38). 

There was a depression in mean lipase values 
of the castrated animals of approximately 45$ shown 
by the seventh day after initial injection. This was 
at the same decreased level by the fourteenth day, 
showing a slight increase by the twenty-first day. 

The control animals showed a depression from normal 
values that roughly paralleled the orchidectomized 
group results. Therefore it seems likely that the 
depressing effect on serum lipase appearing from 
the use of diethyl stilboestrol may be of a metabolic 
nature. Physical examination of the animals showed a 
slight dermatitis, and the animals were sluggish. 

Post mortem examination disclosed the presence of 
white nodules in the liver tissue. It seems evident 
from the data presented in Table XII that the hor¬ 
mone had the same depressing effect on the serum 
lipase whether the animal was orchidectomized or 
normal. It was noted, that the increase of lipase values 
after the withdrawal of hormone injections, was more 
rapid in the normal animals, than in the orchidect¬ 


omized ones

E, The effect of ovariectomy. 

(1) Ovariectomy levels In adult females. 

Ten adult female rats of normal weight and on 
a normal Purina and Ralston checker diet, were ooph- 
orectomized. In this group of ten animals, all surv¬ 
ived the operation and were back to normal physical 
activities within twenty-four hours. Serum lipase 
determinations were done before oophorectomy and 
at various intervals thereafter, the maximum being 
20 days. A record was kept of the weight and the food 
consumption of each animal during the entire period. 

The effects of oophorectomy on the serum lipase 
levels are presented in Table XIII for the group of 
ten females.

The initial drop in lipase values from 
normal followed the trend as for the castration 
experiments with the male rats, but the recovery 
period was more rapid. The same effect therefore 
must be the causative factor in this decrease as 
with the males. This evidence would point more 
strongly to a hormonal effect since under cert¬ 
ain conditions the same hormones are found in the 
males and females, 

(2) Effects of injection of diethyl stilboestrol on 

serum lipase of normal and castrate female rats. 

The hormone diethyl stilboestrol was used. The 
group of ten animals consisted of five control anim¬ 
als and five ovariectomized females. The injections 
and serum lipase determinations were followed for a 
period of twenty-eight days, the oestrogen Injections 
being discontinued after the twenty-first day. 

5 mgm. vials of diethyl stilboestrol in oil 
were diluted to 10 ml. with peanut oil. Each rat 
received subcutaneously 0.20 ml. of this dilution, 
or 0.1 mgm. daily. The results of this test are 
presented in Table XIV (see page 41). 

There was a depression in mean lipase values 
of the ovariectomized animals of J)2% by the seventh 
day after initial injection. This was approximately 
at this same level by the fourteenth day. The control

F, The effect of hip;h fat diets. 

(l) 40$ fat diet (control) 

Two groups of adult male rats were used, ten 
animals in each group. Serum lipase determinations 
were done "before the diet started and for various 
intervals thereafter, up to six weeks. The results 
of the first diet did not show any significant changes 
in lipase activity over a twenty-one day period, there¬ 
fore only the results of the second diet, which was 
continued for a period of 6 weeks, are reported. 

The 40$ fat diet which was used as the control, 
contained10$ vitamin-free casein 
38$ crisco 
2$ cod liver oil. 

44$ sucrose. 

0.2$ riboflavin. 

Also the following vitamin mixture per kilogram of 
diet:- 1.0 gm calcium pantothenate. 

0*5 gm niacin 
0.5 gm pyridoxine 
0.5 gm thiamine 
0.4 gm choline. 

The animals received 150 grams of the mixture 
daily, with tap water supplied ad libitum. This amount 
of food was an approximate calculation based on the

Post mortem examination of two of the animals revealed 
no unusual signs except a slight mottling of the liver 
and unusually large accumulations of fat in the tissues. 
The sera obtained for lipase determinations showed a very 
slight lipemia.

IV. Summary # 

1. A tritrimetric micro-method has been developed 
for the determination of the lipolytic activity of 
rat sera. It consists essentially in the titrimetric 
estimation of the fatty acid set free on hydrolysis of 
a substrate, by the enzyme contained in a measured 
amount of serum. The amount of hydrolysis occurring 

in unit time is proportional to the concentration of 
the enzyme in the serum sample. 

2. A study has been made of the kinetics of 

the lipase system in rat sera, including pH optima, 
rate of hydrolysis, and substrate concentration, 
using three substrates; tripropionin,tributyrin, 
and ethyl butyrate. Inhibition and activation were 
also studied, using various substances. 

3* Serum lipase levels have been studied in 
normal rats of various ages. A low level of activity 
was found soon after birth, with an increase to adult 
values after thirty days. The lipase levels have 
also been studied in a number of experimental cond¬ 
itions. 

4. It was found that barbiturate injections did 
not affect the enzyme concentration. Other studies 
include alloxan diabetes, orchidectomy, oophorectomy, 
and high fat diets.

4* The lipolytic activity of rat sera is considerably 
increased during alloxan diabetes. The elevated values 
are associated with the diabetic state and can be 
lowered signifleantly by the repeated injection of 
0*4 units of zinc insulin. 

5. Hat serum lipase is decreased following orchid- 
ectomy and ovariectomy but a return to normal values 
occurs in twenty to forty days post-operatively. The 
effect of the injection of hormones was studied in cas¬ 
trate and intact male and female rats. Testosterone and 
oestradiol dipropionate had" no effect but diethyl stilbo- 
estrol caused a marked lowering of lipase levels in 
both male and female rats. The lowering was the same 

in both castrate and intact animals, but the return 
to normal values after withdrawal of hormone inject¬ 
ions, was slightly more rapid in the intact animals. 

6. The effect of high fat diets was studied. A 
control diet containing 40^ fat plus all essential 
minerals and vitamins was first studied. A lowering 
of lipase values was found. A second diet containing 
40^ fat but low choline, also lowered lipase values 
significantly in six weeks. The animals developed 
enlarged and fatty livers. A third set containing 

40 % fat plus 1.75$ methionine also decreased the 
lipase values from normal, the most rapid drop occur¬ 
ring in the second week of the diet.

Addendum 

I. Mouse serum lipase. 

The micro method developed for rat serum lipase 
determinations has been extended to the lipolytic 
activity in mouse sera. The same pH optimum was 
found and the same buffer was used. Slight modifications 
in the method include the reduction in serum amount to 
0.05 ml. and an increase in the incubtaion time to one 
hour. All other factors remain the same. 

This modified method has been applied to a study 
of the lipolysis of the sera of inbred cancer resistant 
and cancer susceptible strains of mice, with a view to 
establishing data connecting increased lipolysis and 
malignant mammary tumor growth in mice.

II. Cow serum lipase* 

The micro method adapted for lipolytic determinations 
in rat sera was applied without success to cow sera. An 
incubation period of four hours failed to produce any 
evidence of lipolysis. Several types of buffers were 
tried without results. It is possible that the problem of 
a species specificit3^ arises here and that the lipase 
concentration in the serum is inversely proportional to 
the size of the animal. There is also the possibility of 
the presence of an interfering substance that may 
inhibit the hydrolysis. On the other hand* the enzyme 
might be in the form of a prolipase that requires a 
specific activator. The study of cow serum lipase is still 
under consideration and will require further investigation.

III* Human serum lipase. 

Using the micro-method developed for rat sera, 
the lipolytic activity in human sera has been found to 
be much lower and necessitated the increasing of the 
incubation time to one hour as a tentative measure to 
obtain a titratable acidity. Studies on an improved 
method are in progress. The application of the serum 
lipase determinations to human physiological and 
pathological conditions presents an interesting field 
for future investigations.

IV« Enzyme concentration-activity relationship for 

three substrates. 

Using thefc optimum buffer pH, the optimum con¬ 
centration of substrate, and times chosen for each 
substrate to act, an experiment was set up to show 
the relationship between serum enzyme concentration 
and lipase activity, all other factors constant• The 
results of this experiment are shown in Figure 4 for 
the three substrates.

The total final volume in the digestion tubes 
in each case WAS. * 1.32 mi. using tributyrin; 3.325 
ml. using tripropionin; and 3*315 ml. when ethyl 
butyrate was the substrate. These final volymes were 
kept relatively constant, with variations in amounts 
of serum added, by keeping the volume of added serum 
plus distilled water the same. 

Since tripropionin was hydrolyzed for fifteen 
minutes, a much greater activity was shown by the 
enzyme towards this substrate, than for example,towards 
ethyl butyrate in a thirty minute digestion period. The 
increase in lipase activity with increasing amounts of 
serum added, indicates a saturation of the enzyme under 
the experimental conditions. The levelling off of the 
curves with the addition of 0.20 ml. serum showed that 
the substrate approached the condition of complete hyd¬ 
rolysis. At this stage, more substrate would have to be 
added to saturate the enzyme present in 0*20 ml. serum.
