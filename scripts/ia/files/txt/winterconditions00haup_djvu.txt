ABSTRACT 


Three lakes in the Edmonton area were studied during the winter 
from October 17, 1936 to May 5, 1957. The oxygen content of the water 
was determined by the xmmodified Vifinkler method. 

All three of the lakes underwent an oxygen depletion to a level 
at which fish would be expected to asphyxiate. Only in one of the lakes 
did a winter-kill occur. The fish present in the lakes became acclima¬ 
tized to the low oxygen level. Tliis level was shown to be about 1.25 
p.p.m.. 

The oxygen demand of the water was determined. The experiment 
showed that the aerobic decomposition of organic material within the 
water is the greatest factor in the depletion of the lake oxygen.

INTRODUCTION 


(1) The Local Importance of V/inter Conditions 

During the past few years the provincial government has undertaken 
an extensive fish planting program in and aroxmd the Edmonton area* 

This program was designed to give the local fisherman a good game fish 
within a relatively short travelling distance of home. At the same 
time it put to a useful purpose bodies of water that were either pro¬ 
ducing an inferior variety of game fish or in some cases no game fish 
at all. The fish planted in these lakes are rainbow trout ( Sa3jao 
gairdneri ) and the lakes are small ”pot-holes'’ that average 15 feet in 
depth. 

The program has been received with great enthusiasm by the local 
fishermen. Before trout were planted in Cottage Lake (one of the study 
lakes) the lake was visited only by people who had cottages in the 
vicinity. Now that trout have been planted, on one particular Sunday, 

600 cars, averaging three people per car, were counted visiting the lake. 
It was also estimated that at least one quarter of the people present 
fished the lake on that day. The second lake studied. Star Lake, is also 
enjoying an increase in popularity since it has been stocked with trout. 
This popularity lasted the year around, even when the temperature reg¬ 
istered 30 degrees below zero. On warmer winter days there were as 
many as 30 people on the lake fishing. Muir Lake, the third lake 
studied, also attracts fishermen. According to local residents, fishing 
is very popular especially during the summer months.

The program has not been an unqualified success. Knowledge of the 
management of these fisheries is extremely scanty and many problems have 
arisen. One of the most pressing of these is the determination of the 
limnological conditions that lead to winter-kill; i,e, death of trout 
under the ice or in early spring. The study, reported here, is an 
attempt to find some of the basic factors involved. It was believed 
that a study of dissolved oxygen depletion, biological oxygen demand 
of the water, the organic content of the bottom mud, and the movements 
of the fish, might reveal some of these basic factors. From this 
information a field worker might be able to predict whether or not a 
barren body of water could maintain a fish population for a number of 
years. An example was visualized as follows: A lake or ’^pot-hole” 

(from now on to be called lake) to be planted is sounded to determine 
its depth. Samples of water are taken after the fall overturn but before 
freeze-up, to determine the oxygen content. During the winter, periodic 
oxygen samples and biological oxygen demand determinations are made. 

These findings are plotted on a prediction chart and, by spring break¬ 
up, the lake can be tabled as suitable or unsuitable for planting. A 
chart of this type is not yet available; a purpose of this study was to 
try to provide the necessary data for constructing one. A second con¬ 
sideration which prompted tliis research was the fact that a lake in winter 
has a set of conditions entirely different from those existing in summer. 
The cover of ice (and often snow) isolates the water from most of the 
external environmental changes. Thus aeration by wind and wave is arr¬ 
ested and the diffusion of other gases out of the water is prevented.

This interference with the oxygen supply results in severe stag¬ 
nation and oxygen depletion in most shallow eutrophic lakes. The extreme 
stagnation that may develop at times has been characterized in the past by 
the mortality of game or food fish. This mortality is called winter-kill 
or winter suffocation. 

In order to learn how depletion of dissolved oxygen occurs, an 
attempt was made to find out (l) how fast the dissolved oxygen disappeared 
in the various lakes and (2) the reasons for the depletion, such as: (a) 
the biological oxygen demand of the water, and (b) the amount of organic 
material in the ooze. 

(2) A Review of Literature on V/inter Conditions 

An attempt to understand what actually happened after the ice cov¬ 
ered the lake was made by Hazzard (1941). He analyzed the effect of winter 
fishing and concluded that the isolation of many lakes by deep snow and 
impassable roads prevents winter fishing from depleting the crop in northern 
lakes. Clarke (1939) extended these investigations to southern Michigan 
lakes. Based upon population estisiates and creel census records, he con¬ 
cluded that even though the catch in winter on such lakes may be high, only 
a small percentage of the legal fish is removed by winter fishing and that 
there is no immediate danger of depleting the stock in these waters. These 
men also stated that winter was the best time to investigate and map lakes 
and stressed that more work should be done in winter surveys. 

W. G. Moore (1942) studied the oxygen requirements of certain fresh¬ 
water fishes. He reported that in winter the metabolic activity decreased 
due to the low temperature, with consequent lessened oxygen requirements 
of the poikilothermous fishes. Wot only was the absolute oxygen consump¬ 
tion markedly reduced, but the oxygen threshold below which fishes could

not extract sufficient oxygen from the water to sustain life was also 
depressed. Irving, Black, and Safford (1941) also showed that the 
affinity of the haemoglobin of fish blood for oxygen increased as the 
temperature declined. 

Cooper and Washburn (1946) reported on the relation of dissolved 
oxygen to winter mortality of fish in Michigan lakes. Although they 
found oxygen levels as low as 0.3 or 0.2 p.p.m., no complete kill of all 
the species of fish in a lake was encountered. They concluded that fish 
of different species differ in their minimum oxygen requirements. 

One of the most extensive reports published was that of Greenbank 
(1945) who studied the limnological conditions in ice-covered lakes, 
especially as related to winter-kill of fish. The studies were carried 
out during the winters of 1937-3^, 1939-40, 1940-41, and 1942-43* His 
report covered many limnological aspects, some of which were: dissolved 
oxygen, biochemical oxygen demand, light penetration, oxygen consumption 
and replenishment, winter suffocation of fish and finally preventive and 
remedial measures. (The work reported in this thesis was largely 
patterned after Greenbank*s methods, except that no studies of light 
penetration were made.) According to Greenbank it is probable that the 
respiration of fish and other animals and plants plays an insignificant 
part in the depletion of the oxygen. The main consumption comes from the 
bacterial decay of organic matter, either suspended or dissolved in the 
water or deposited on the bottom as ooze. The production of oxygen is 
mainly from the phytoplankton. The winter-kill of fish is mainly due to 
lack of sufficient dissolved oxygen together with high concentrations of 
carbon dioxide or other harmful gases. Different species show different

tolerances to low amounts of oxygen. Once a lake has developed severe 
winter stagnation, usually little relief can be secured from the appli¬ 
cation of artificial measures such as cutting holes in the ice or pumping 
air into the water. 

The effect of oxygen depletion on fish has been extensively 
studied, e.g., Jahoda (1947), Shaw (1947), Shepard (1954). Scidmore 
( 1956 ) has investigated the influences of other gases on winter-kill. 

II DESCRIPTIONS OF m STUDY LAKES 

Three lakes in the Edmonton area were examined over a period of 
eight months, October 1956 to May 1957, inclusive. In this portion of 
the report the location, areas, depths, contours and sampling stations 
will be described. 

(1) Cottage Lake 

This lake lies in section 30 , township 52, range 1, west of the 
fifth meridian. It has an area of approximately 23 O acres. The surr- 
oimding coxmtry is rolling prairie, partly wooded, with patches of sandy 
soil. Miller and Macdonald (1949) examined this lake to determine angling 
conditions within it. 

The lake shore is mostly of mud and the lake bottom is fairly 
soft. One beach of fine sand is present on the southeast side. 

Soundings were made in order to determine the best locations 
for the sampling stations. The depths found and the resulting stations 
are shoi-m on the accompanying maps (Fig. la and lb). The greatest depth 
on the southeast side was 25 feet. There is a considerable area of water

of twenty feet or more in depth. A shallow sandy bar runs across the 
southern end and divides the lake into two basines. The area of the 
northern basin is cut down considerably by an island. According to 
local people the lake level has been dropping for the last 30 years. 
There are no outlets or inlets at the present time but it is reported 
that at one time the lake was fed by creeks. 

The lake becomes uniformly warm from top to bottom in the 

summer. 


(2) Star Lake 

This lake lies in section 19, township 52, range 2, 
west of the fifth meridian. It has an area of approximately 60 acres. 
The surrounding country is rolling parkland. There are trees all 
around the lake except on the southwest shore. The shoreline is irr¬ 
egular with one small treed island on the west side. 

The lake shore is mostly mud and the lake bottom is 
very soft. There are no sandy beaches. 

Soundings were made in order to determine the best 
sampling stations. The depths found and the resulting stations are 
shown on the accompanying maps (Fig. 2a and 2b). The greatest depth 
recorded was 24 feet. The average depth of the lake is estimated to 
be about 10 to 12 feet. The banks are quite steep on all sides, 
especially on the north and east, with a gradual shallowing to the 
west and south. There are no inlets or outlets at present.

Ji3) Muir Lake 

Muir Lake lies six miles north and two miles east of Stony 
Plain on the north half of sections 31 and 32 and the south half of 
sections 5 and 6, townships 53 and 54, range 27, west of the fourth 
meridian and comprises approximately 72 acres. It is an elongate lake 
with the shores heavily wooded except on the northwest. There is one 
island. North of the island lies a shallow mud bar with weeds vjhich 
divides the lake into north and south basins. The northern basin is 
larger in area but somewhat shallower with an average depth of ten 
feet. The southern area is more circular in shape, smaller in area, 
and has an average depth of 15 feet. It was this latter area that 
was extensively surveyed. The map (Fig. 3a and 3b) shovfs the depths 
and contours. 

(4) The Planting History of the Lakes 

Prior to this investigation the tiiree lakes had been 
already stocked with rainbow trout. The history of these plantings 
is shown in Table I (Alberta Department of Lands and Forests Lake 
Planting Reports, Mimeos 1953, 1954, 1955 and 1956).

(5) Previous Fish Faunae 

Although no records are available on previous game fish populations 
that might have inhabited these lakes, the following facts are known: 

Cottage Lake: Perch ( Perea flavescens ) is now abundant in the 
lake. It is believed that these entered the lake when inflowing creeks 
existed. Recently there have been reports of pike (Esox lucius) having 
been caught by anglers. lyir. M. J. Paetz has told me that two pike were 
talcen in government gill nets in 1956. 

Star Lake: There are no other species of game fish in the lake at 
this time. However, from mud dredgings in which perch scales were found 
(Thomas 1954), it is evident that these fish at some time inhabited the 
lake. 

Muir Lake: No known previous game fish fauna. 

No records could be found concerning smaller fish but five-spined 
sticklebacks ( Eucalia inconstans ) were seen in Star Lake and found in the 
stomach contents of the larger fish caught in all three lakes.

III TJffi STUDY OF OXYGEN CONDITIONS DURING THE WINTER 
1 Methods 

The water was sampled by means of a Kemmerer bottle with care 
being taken to see that no mud was caught up in the deepest samples. 

Some difficulty was encountered with ice forming within the apparatus. 

This was overcome by submerging the apparatus briefly before use. In 
order to prevent the freezing of the samples, they were transported in 
a corrugated cardboard box in which was placed a gallon Jar full of hot 
water. The heat given off by the water within the Jar was sufficient 
to prevent the samples from freezing but was not enough to raise the 
temperature of the samples above their original temperature. 

Regular sampling stations were established on the three lakes 
early in December, when the ice was strong enough to support weight. 

The station depths were as follows: 

#1 - Five feet to lake bottom. Two samples were taken here, one at the 
surface and one at five feet. 

#2 - Ten feet to lake bottom. Two samples were taken one at the five 
foot depth and the other at ten feet. 

#3 - Fifteen feet to lake bottom. Three samples were taken one at each 
five foot level. 

#4 “ Maximum depth. Samples were taken at the surface and then at each 
five foot level until the bottom was reached where one sample was taken 
even though there was not a five foot difference from the previous level. 

It should be mentioned that the stations were not the same distances 
apart at the surface of the lake.

The maps (Figs, la, 2a and 3a) show the locations of the stations 
on lakes Cottage, Star and Muir respectively. Figures lb, 2b and 3b 
relates the stations to the bottom profile of the lakes. 

During the last week of October and through November, each lake 
was sampled weekly. During December, January, February and March, 
each lake was sampled two weeks out of every three, e.g. December 14 
Star and Muir, December 19 Star and Cottage, December 28 Cottage and 
Muir, and so on. 

A reversing thermometer was used to take the water temperatures. 
The temperature was recorded at the same depth and time at which the 
sample was taken. However if it was not possible to do this simul¬ 
taneously the water sample was always taken first to insure the least 
amount of mixing of the water. The samples were always taken from the 
surface first and then at each subsequent lower level. 

A plankton haul at station #4 was made after all the samples and 
temperatures had been taken. 

After the water samples had been transferred as quickly as 
possible to the univerisyt, the primary reagents (Alkaline-iodide 
reagent, manganous sulfate, and concentrated sulfuric acid) were imm¬ 
ediately added. The oxygen determinations made were based upon the 
unmodified Winkler method (Standard Methods for the Examination of 
Water, Sewage and Industrial ’Wastes, 1955 p.p. 252-255). 

It was found that upon addition of the primary reagents the 
solution could stand indefinitely in glass bottles before titration 
and no significant change would occur in the oxygen titrations. This 
is not true when polyethylene bottles are used; in these the oxygen

Records of the ice and snow cover were not kept in detail. 
However, they were recorded from time to time in order to get an idea 
of the overall conditions. Table II shows the conditions observed.

2 Results 

Samples were taken from the stations every two weeks out 
of three, as explained on the previous page. The results of oxygen 
determinations are shown in the Appendix, Figs. 4, 5 and 6 and in Table 
XIV. Each horizontal division represents one p.p.m. of dissolved oxygen. 
Each vertical division is equivalent to five feet of depth. The stations 
from which the samples were taken are marked at the top. 

From Fig. 4 it may be seen that the oxygen of Star Lake was

was first depleted at the lower levels. It may also be seen that the 
oxygen decreased steadily until March 8 when the minimum oxygen tension 
was reached. By March 27 there was a sudden increase in oxygen and on 
the following week a marked decrease. From this date on there was a 
steady increase in the oxygen content. 

Figure 5 (Appendix) shows the oxygen content of Cottage Lake 
for each sampling date for the entire period of investigation. It is to 
be read in the same manner as Fig. 4. In this chart it is seen that 
there was a steady decrease in dissolved oxygen, though not as rapid as 
in Star Lake. The minimum oxygen level was reached during the week of 
April 3^ but from that point on, there was a slow but steady increase 
in oxygen until final break-up of the ice. 

The oxygen content for Muir Lake for the year may be found 
by referring to Fig. 6 (Appendix). This chart is read in the same way 
as those of the two other lakes. The chart shows that the dissolved 
oxygen of this lake was depleted much more rapidly than that of the 
other lakes. The lowest oxygen tension was reached during the last 
weeks in February; it remained at this level until March 8 when a slight 
increase in the oxygen content occurred. From this time on there was 
rapid increase in oxygen. 

In order to compare the oxygen depletion in the three lakes, 
the average of the oxygen content of all of the samples taken on one day 
was computed. This average was considered as the average oxygen content 
of the lake for that date since sufficient data were not obtained to calculate 
the actual average oxygen content of each lake. The data are shown graph¬ 
ically in Fig. 7 (Appendix). The average oxygen content shown on this

IV BIOLOGICAL OXYGEN DEMAi^ OF LAKE WPS AND WATER 

1 Mud of Muir Lake 

A sample of bottom mud was obtained from the ten-foot depth 
of Muir Lake on February 7, 1957. The mud was used to set up the 
following experiment; 

Seven one-quart sealers were used; fifty g. of ooze were 
weighed out, mixed with 250 ml. of tap water and put into each of 
sealers 1, 2, 3 4* The sealers were then shsiken for one minute, 

one hundred and fifty mis. of water were added to each, the sealers 
sealed, and allowed to stand. 

In sealers five and six the same procedure was followed but 
the mud had been made sterile. This was done by treating it with 50 ml. 
of ten percent formalin for a period of 24 hours. 

Sealer Number Seven was used as a control. No mud was added 
but the water was treated in the same way as in sealers 1, 2, 3 and 4. 

After the sealers stood for a few minutes the first titrations 
were made. The results obtained are shown in Table III. 

The data in Table III indicate; 

1) Lake mud has a high biological oxygen demand (B.O.D.). 

2) Treating the mud with formalin reduces the B.O.D, but does not 
eliminate it entirely. Either some organisms are not killed (i.e. the 
mud was not sterile) or there is a chemical as well as a biological 
oxygen demand. 

3) Apparently tap water has a small, but measurable oxygen demand.

2 Quantity of Organic Material in Lake Muds 

On March 31 *^^ an Ekman dredge was used to obtain mud from the 
10-foot depths of all three lakes. Samples of the mud were air-dried 
by leaving them in open beakers at room temperature until they reached 
constant weight (May 6). 

The amount of organic material in each sample was obtained by 
incinerating the dried mud. The loss in weight was considered to be 
the organic matter burned away. The method used to obtain the weight 
loss was as follows: the first sample (Star Lake) was incincerated to 
constant weight and then the subsequent samples were incincerated for 
the same period of time. 

Table IV shows the results. 

It is clear that the three lake muds vary with respect to 
organic matter; Muir Lake mud contains the most and Cottage Lake the 
least. The differences between the nature of the lake bottoms fit in

well with these findings. Cottage Lake bottom is of sand and is rel¬ 
atively free of organic material. On the other hand Muir Lake mud is 
relatively free of sand but high in dead or rotting vegetation.

3 The Oxygen Demand of the Lake Waters 

To obtain the B.O.D. of the water under winter conditions, 
samples were taken, placed into 500 ml. reagent bottles, and lowered 
to the exact depth from which they came. The bottles were held at 
their respective levels with cords which were tied to the markers at 
each station. At the same time a sample of water was taken from each 
level at which a bottle was placed. This sample was titrated and the 
oxygen content determined. In this way the water in the bottles was 
subjected to exactly the same conditions as the water around it, except 
that there could be no oxygen loss by diffusion to the bottom mud. It 
was planned to leave the bottles for an equal period of time before the 
water within them was titrated for oxygen content. However, some of the 
bottles vfere cut loose by vandals so it was thought wise to remove the 
remaining bottles from Muir Lake after a week. The bottles in Star Lake

were removed after four weeks and those in Cottage after five weeks. 

The results of this experiment are presented in Table V. 

The data in Table V reveal that the lake water, independent of 
the mud, has a substantial oxygen demand; also that some oxygen reaches 
the lake water during winter, possibly from photosynthesis. 

V The Activity of Trout in Winter 

1 The Nets and the Catches 

In order to get an idea of the effect decreased oxygen content 
might have on the trout, nets were set in all three lakes at various 
times. 

A hole approximately two feet in diameter was drilled using a 
needle bar and a shovel. A jigger (Sprules, 1949) was used to string 
a running line under the ice. Ifhen the proper length of line had been 
run out, another hole was drilled and the jigger pulled out. The nets 
were weighted so that they floated about a foot under the ice. The 
starting depth was usually at the ten-foot level but the depth at the 
far end was unknown until the jigger was pulled out and the depth 
measured. The nets were of one-and-three-quarters-inch mesh nylon. 

Two 50-yard lengths were used. 

The first nets were set in Muir Lake on January 12, 1957 at 
4:30 p.m.. The first fifty yards ran almost parallel to the west shore. 
The next fifty ran north-east toward the island. The nets v/ere lifted 
the following morning at 11:00 a.m.. The first net yielded 14 trout, 
none in the first twenty-five yards; the number removed gradually 
increased until in the last two yards five trout were found. The 
second net caught 11 trout which were fairly evenly spaced along the 
length of the net.

one fish was caught. The nets were immediately moved to Star Lake. 

At the same time that the nets were being set a short line (24 feet) 
was stretched south of the nets in Star Lake. On it were seven hooks 
all baited with shrimp but hanging at different levels. On February 
4th the first 50 yards of net pulled out yielded 12 fish while the 
remaining 50 yards caught 14. No fish were taken on the hooks and the 
shrimp had not been touched. The oxygen content was about 3*5 p.p.m.. 

The next setting was on March 10th, in Star Lake. Three fish 
were caught (oxygen 1.5 p.p.m.). 

The only setting of nets in Cottage Lake took place on March 
24 th. On March 25th, the first 50 yards pulled yielded 180 perch and 
5 trout. Twenty trout were caught in the second 50 yards. The perch 
had an average length of 9.25 inches and an average weight of 150 gm.. 
The lengths and weights of the fish caught are shown in Table VII. 

The records of the trout caught and oxygen content of all the lakes 
are given in Table VIII. 

The final settings in M^ir Lake, May 3rd, and Star Lake, 

May 5th, were made from a boat. The nets were put in Muir Lake at 
12:00 noon. However, two local men removed the nets at about 5:00 p.m. 
on the same day. A provincial biologist caught the men removing the 
net and salvaged it along with 12 of the fish. A total of 25 fish had 
been caught during that five hour period. No dead fish were seen on 
or near the shore at the time. No fish kill was evident for the winter 


season in this lake

Star Lake was netted on Hay 5th, the nets were in the water 
from 8:00 a.m. until 7:00 p*m. of the same day. Thirty-four fish were 
caught in that period and 50 dead trout were counted along a hundred 
yard length of shore. It was estimated that a fifty percent winter-kill 
had occurred. 

2 Relationship of Net Returns to Dissolved Oxygen Content 

The data which show the oxygen content of the various lake 
waters and the trout caught per hundred yards of gill net at these oxygen 
contents are shown in Table VIII. 

(a) Cottage Lake 

The oxygen content of Cottage Lake was high enough to suggest 
that there would not be a winter-kill in the lake. For this reason test 
nets were set only once. The subsequent catch proved that all the fish

were moving about freely and were not suffering from the drop in oxygen. 

According to the local residents this lake is fed by springs. 
The springs,coupled with the fact that the B.O.D. of the water was very 
low (see Table V) could have provided enough oxygen for the season.

b) Star Lake 


Even though Star Lake did lose its oxygen quite rapidly it did 
not seem conceivable that a winter-kill could occur. The reasons for 
this belief were: 

1) the decrease of oxygen did not appear to reach lethal limits, 2) a 
low B.O.D. (see Table V), 3) the fact that Star Lake was populated with 
fish of several ages, and the larger fish would be more tolerant of low 
oxygen (Moore, 1942). 

However, the following circumstances proved the expectations 
wrong. During the period February 22nd to March 13th a lethal or near 
lethal (1.8 p.p.m.) level of oxygen was reached. This fact alone could

have accounted for a partial mortality. However, similar conditions 
existed in Muir Lake during the same period and no mortality took place. 
The following factor is believed responsible for the mortality in Star 
Lake: After March 13th and particularly on March 27th an unusually high 
oxygen content (up to 9 p.p.m, with an average of 5 p.p.m. at a depth 
of seven feet) was observed, A very warm spell melted the ice and per¬ 
mitted the oxygenated surface water to drain into the lake. This also 
occurred at the other lakes as shown by the records of Muir Lake (one 
reading of 9.6 p.p.m,). However, on the following week the oxygen 
content dropped to near lethal levels (highest recorded was 2.2. p.p.m, 
at five feet but below seven feet only 1,0 p.p.m.). This deosygenation 
also occurred at Muir Lake but not to as low a level so that the fish 
had a chance to survive. It is believed that the severe and extremely 
sudden change in oxygen was the main cause of the mortality. This 
conclusion is based upon the work of Shepard (1954) who studied the 
resistance and tolerance of yo\mg speckled trout ( Salvelinus fontinalis ) 
to oxygen lack, with special reference to low oxygen acclimation. He 
showed that smaller fish succumb more readily to low oxygen pressures 
than larger fish of the same species. He also showed that fish develop 
a resistance to oxygen lack if they are kept in poorly oxygenated water 
for any period of time. However, the increased resistance gained by 
this e:q)osure to low oxygen is lost when they are returned to water 
containing higher concentrations of oxygen. It is, therefore, feasible 
to assume that the Star Lake fish could not acclimatize themselves

quickly enough to the sudden change and so suffocated. It is also 
reasonable to assume that if any fish did succumb to this rapid 
deoxygenation they were of the smaller size. However, this fact 
was not borne out by the final net catches. It was noticed though, 
that all the dead fish on the shoreline were about eight inches in 
length. 


c) liuir Lake 

Upon observing the rapid oxygen depletion of the lake after 
the first few months it was believed that the oxygen content would 
soon reach lethal levels and a winter-kill would be inevitable. This 
p rediction seemed about to be realized when the number of trout caught 
became less as the oxygen content became less; also the local fisher¬ 
men reported that they were not catching any fish. Taking into con¬ 
sideration that previous workers had reported that the lethal level for 
trout was about 2 p.p.m. and that the lake was much lower than this 
(from February 13th to March 10th, the average oxygen content was 
1.5 p.p.m.; and from March 10th to March 20th it was 1.9 p.p.m.) it 
seemed certain that no trout could possibly survive. 

However, when the ice broke up the fish were as abundant and 
as active as ever. No dead fish were seen on the shore and apparently 
no winter-kill had taken place. No experimental evidence was obtained 
to offer an explanation for this occurrence. The following explanations, 
based upon work done by other researchers, are the only ones that might 
help solve this phenomenon. It was shown by Irving, Black, and Safford 










30 


(1941) that the affinity of fish haemoglobin for oxygen increased as 
the temperature declined. This could be one reason that the fish did 
not die. A second reason might be that it is believed that at the low 
temperatures the fish did not move about; this would lead to a lower 
oxygen requirement. The lack of activity was shown by the fact that 
the fish were not feeding. The stomach contents of the last four fish 
caught showed nothing except a small amount of material which might 
have been plankton. Secondly, the decrease in catch size was probably 
due to the decreased activity of the fish and not to a decrease of the 
population. The final possible reason for the survival is based upon 
the work of Moore (1942) who showed that the tolerance of fish, 
especially larger fish, to oxygen lack, is associated with their lower 
matabolic rate at lower temperature. 

These three facts, lower metabolism, less activity due to 
temperature, higher affinity for oxygen by the haemoglobin, plus the 
fact that no sudden fluctuations in the oxygen content occurred (as 
they did in Star Lake) are believed responsible for the survival of 
the Muir Lake fish. 

VI WINTER PLANKTONIC CRUSTACEAI^ POPULATIONS 

Plankton hauls were taken at or near the deepest part of 
the lake (stations numbered four) on every visit. The plankton net was 
nimiber 20 silk bolting cloth and was 12 inches in diameter at the top. 

The 30 ml. samples obtained v/ere preserved by adding 1 ml. of ten percent 
formalin and 1 ml. of 95 percent alcohol to each. 

To be sure that samples did not freeze before they reached

the laboratory the bottles were always carried in the inside pocket of 
the coat close to the body. Precautions also had to be taken when 
handling the plankton net. When taken from the water the net usually 
froze solid immediately. In order not to damage the net it had to be 
transported in this frozen condition to the next lake. Just prior to 
taking the next sample it was partially immersed in the water thus 
thawing it out and making it usable. 

After all the samples had been taken and the plankton had 
settled out, the total volume of each was measured. This was done in 
graduated volumetric tubes; the volume of plankton was read in cubic 
centimeters after it had settled in the volumetric flask for a twenty- 
four hour period. The volumes of the zooplankton are presented in Table IX.

Chaoborus was found in some of the samples but since it floated 
they were not included in the volumes above. It occurred as follows: 

None in Cottage Lake; in Star Lake sample 6 had two, sample 11 had one, 
sample 14 had one and sample 18 had two; in Muir Lake sample 8 had two, 
sample 9 had one, sample 10 approximately 15, sample 15 had one, sample 
16 had one, sample 1? approximately 30 , sample 18 had two, and sample 
19 had approximately 15. 

Table IX shows that the decrease in oxygen did not have a large 
effect upon the amount of zooplankton within the water. Phytoplankton, 
which is not included in the volumes of table IX, was markedly decreased 
during the first two months. This decrease, however, was probably due 
to a decrease in sunlight rather than an oxygen depletion. 

Muir Lake showed a trend to a decrease in zooplankton population 
with a drop in oxygen. As the oxygen fell from 11.7 p.p.m. to 1.23 p.p.m. 
the plankton decreased from 12 to 0.5 cc. From March 1st to May 5th, no 
appreciable fluctuations occurred. 

Star Lake had a curious history; when the oxygen content rose, 
early in the season, the zooplankton showed a marked decrease; however, 
as soon as the oxygen content started to fall the zooplankton increased 
in number and maintained a volume much the same as that of Muir Lake 
plankton. This increase was probably due to the increase in oxygen which 
had been caused by photosynthesis early in the season (see the discussion 
part one). On two occasions, January 10 and January 23, the plankton 
showed a slight increase. On these two dates the average oxygen content 
also rose slightly (Fig. 10). It is unesqjlainable why the plankton would

increase at these lower oxygen tensions while it had a lower population 
during the periods of higher oxygen tension earlier in the season. 

Cottage Lake, which had a relatively high oxygen content 
con^Dared to the other two lakes, had a very low plankton population. 

This level of plankton was maintained throughout the season with the 
exception of the period from November 21 to December 26. This period 
coincided with the period of supersaturation that took place in Muir 
Lake (see page 44)* 

These facts show that the oxygen content has some effect 
upon the zooplankton popxilation. It is also apparent that there is a 
relationship between the plankton volume and the organic content of the 
ooze. If the total vuliimes of plankton for the whole year are considered 
it is seen that Muir Lake had the largest volume and Cottage Lake the 
smalles. Correspondingly Muir Lake mud had the largest organic content 
and Cottage Lake the least organic material (see Table IV), It is not 
being suggested that all the organic material within the ooze is com¬ 
posed of plankton but the higher volume of plankton probably contributes 
to the organic richness of the mud. There is alwo a definite relation¬ 
ship between the volume of plankton and the B,O.D, of the water. It was 
shown (Table V) that Muir Lake had the highest B.O.D, and Cottage Lake 
the lowest. This fact is directly correlated with the amount of zoo¬ 
plankton present with Muir Lake having the most plankton and Cottage Lake 
the least. The greater the plankton the greater the organic richness of 
the water, Ivlien the organic material decomposes aerobically the oxygen 
is decreased. Thus when the volume of plankton is high the B.O.D. is

VII DISCUSSION 

1 Weather, Ice and Snow 

The following excerpt from the Annual Meteorological Summary 
for Edmonton describes the general climate of the region as follows: 

’’The climate is described as a cold temperate climate but is 
not so severe as might be expected in a continental climate at 53 
degrees N. The Chinooks which modify the long winter just east of the 
Rockies do not usually reach as far east as Edmonton. However, their 
modifying influence does extend to Edmonton for brief spells nearly 
every winter. The frequency of the Chinook is variable. Some winters 
will be quite mild with recurring Chinooks. Other winters may witness 
only one or none. Average winter temperature is 13.7 degrees F. Low 
temperatures of -30 degrees F occur on the average of three or four 
times each winter. Extremely low temperatures of-40 degrees F or less, 
occur about once every three winters. Depth of snow on the ground 
averages seven inches by midwinter and seldom exceeds 14 inches in the 
city area”. 

The weather for the months of the research period is shown on 


Table X

From the observed official records it can be seen that the 
winter of this experiment experienced climatic conditions which came 
very close to the long time averages. The sunlight for this period was 
143.2 hours, only 18.7 hours more than the long time mean. The average 
of the mean temperatures was 23.0 degrees F. only 1.3 degrees higher than 
the long time average mean for this particular part of the season. Thus 
it is reasonable to say that it was a normal season. 

The ice existed on the lakes from November 1st to May 1st, a 
period of 182 days. This period coincided almost exactly to the period 
in which frost persisted. The period betv/een the first and last light 
frosts lasted 240 days while the period between the first and last 
killing frosts lasted 211 days. The ice formed approximately three 
weeks after the first killing frost. From this it can be said that the 
lakes underwent a period of average ice cover in respect to depth of ice.

period of cover, and time between overturns, 

2) i/^ater Temperature 

It was observed that a very abrupt drop in temperature occurred 
in the upper few of water, with a more gradual decline from there to 
the bottom. This temperature distribution remained constant throughout 
the winter despite the external environmental fluctuations of snow cover, 
temperatures, and the amount of solar radiant energy. Toward the end of 
the season the upper levels warmed while the lower levels held their 
original temperatures. The warming trend was due to the normal spring 
conditions but in particular to the inflow of the warmer run-off water 
which entered the lake through cracks in the rotting ice and along the 
free edges of the shore ice. 

At no time throughout the season did the general mass of the 
water heat up. Greenbank (1945) mentioned such an occurrence and attri¬ 
buted it to an increase in the oxidation of organic matter and to the 
heat produced by the radiant energy of the sunlight. In our more north¬ 
erly latitudes such an occurrence is less likely. 

3) Dissolved Oxygen 

The best single indicator of the conditions for fish life during 
winter is the dissolved oxygen. 

During the course of the study a relatively large range of diss¬ 
olved oxygen values was obsei*ved. As the season progressed it soon 
became evident that each lake behaved differently with regard to oxygen 
loss. Even though the external conditions were the same for all three 
lakes, they soon began to differ markedly in dissolved oxygen content. 
Data in Table XI outline the general trends.

From these figures (Table XI) it can be seen that Muir Lake 
lost the most oxygen (from 13.0 to 1.5 p.p.m., a total of 11.5 p.p.m, 
in 19 weeks) and remained at supposedly lethal levels for the longest 
period. In Star Lake the drop was slightly lower, 9.1 p.p.m, in 19 
weeks; the drop began one week later than in Muir Lake, This could be 
accounted for by the fact that Star had an increase in oxygen probably 
due to the activity of plankton or to the oxygenated run-off v/ater which 
at that time was still entering the lake. This run-off was not present 
at Muir Lake which had, instead, half an inch of snow cover. 

Cottage Lake was much slower to lose its oxygen (10.8 p.p,m, 
drop in 21 weeks) although the total loss was greater. It is conceivable 
that fish may have been killed if the period of stagnation had been 
prolonged. 

4) Relation of Dissolved Oxygen to Winter-kill 

Some of these data have already been discussed. However, some 
material foimd in the work of other researchers has a bearing on the 
present study, although conclusions that have been reached are largely 
speculative. It is unquestionable that if the oxygen tension remains below

a minimum value for a considerable length of time, fish will die. How¬ 
ever, it is also true that various noxious gases, such as hydrogen 
sulfide, ammonia, methane, and carbon dioxide, can be lethal (Scidmore 
1955). Therefore, a conclusion that oxygen lack is the sole cause of 
death is not always justified. Carbon dioxide alone, if in high 
enough! concentrations, can kill fish, even in the presence of abundant 
oxygen. It has been shown by Fry (1939) and others that the presence 
of large amounts of carbon dioxide greatly reduces the ability of fish 
to utilize oxygen at low tensions. That is to say, the toxicity is 
increased as the oxygen tension is decreased. 

Unfortunately the literature on winter mortality has in¬ 
sufficient information on which to base any definite conclusions 
regarding the importance of these factors. At the same time no records 
were kept on the quantities of these gases present throughout the 
winter. Therefore, it will have to suffice to say that the very low 
oxygen concentrations were probably the primary cause of the death of 
the fish and that the effect of low oxygen may have been aided by the 
presence of the other gases. 

5) The Oxygen Demand of the Lake Muds 

Since the oxygen content is decreased by processes going 
on within the lake, under the ice seal, it is reasonable to suppose 
that the oxygen demand of the bottom mud contributes a great deal to 
this depletion. The fish and the live crustaceans do not deplete the 
oxygen to an important degree (Greenbank 1945). 

The B.O.D. is the oxygen consumed in a certain period of

time, from a sample incubated in the dark at a fixed temperature. 
Theoretically the oxygen is consumed only by bacterial action, but 
also possibly by algae, protozoa, and microscopic metazoa. Actually 
a part of the demand, usually a small part, may come from purely 
chemical oxidation. Conventionally, if the limiting conditions are 
not indicated, it is understood that the time period is five days (120 
hours) and the incubation temperature 20° C, In the present series of 
B.O.D. determinations, all the samples were incubated within the lake 
and thus experienced all the slight changes which the water around them 
underwent, except, of course, possible diffusion to the bottom mud. The 
period of so-called incubation varied from seven to thirty-nine days. 

The B.O.D, gives a rather accurate picture of the relative 
organic richness of the water sample, and the likelihood of the depletion 
of its dissolved oxygen supply in a given time. When measured at the 
actual lake conditions (temperatures), the B,0.D. of a sample of water 
from an ice-covered lake provides a reasonably accurate indication of 
the probable behavior of all the water with respect to oxygen depletion. 
Tests of the B,0,D, early in a season might give a good picture of the 
future course of oxygen depletion of that particular lake during ice 
cover. This may be the case since it is possible that dead algae are 
completely oxidized before they settle to the bottom, so that the samples 
in the fall would give an accurate picture of the rate of oxygen loss. 

On the other hand it is just as possible that the early depletion (after 
freeze-up) could be due to dead algae still in suspension. These would 
settle out, leaving a lesser B.O.D. behind them. This second statement 
is only theory and the facts do not seem to fit it.

In this study the following observations were made. The 
B.O.D. of Cottage Lake was lower than that of the other two lakes (see 
Table V)o The greatest single depletion in Cottage Lake was lov/er than 
that of the other two lakes (see Table V), The greatest single depletion 
in Cottage Lake was only 2,2.p,p,m. for a period of 39 days at an average 
temperature of approximately 1.3^ C. The average of all the bottles from 
Cottage Lake showed a depletion of 1*98 p.p.m. of oxygen. 

In Muir Lake the B.O.D. was higher than that of Cottage. 

The bottles were in the water for a period of only seven days. The 
oxygen decreased 1.0 p.p.m. in those seven days; using simple direct 
proportion, Muir Lake water would use an average of 3*57 p.p.m. in a 
period of 39 days. If correct, this indicates that the B.O.D. of Muir 
Lake is about two and one-half times as great as that of Cottage Lake. 
Star Lake, with an average B.O.D. of 2.36 p.p.m., was only 0.38 p.p.m. 
higher than Cottage Lake. 

It is unfortunate that all the bottles could not have 
been left in the lakes for the same period of time. But by reducing 
the data to an average one-day period we find that the B.O.D.*s of 
Cottage, Star and Muir Lakes were 0.030, 0.066 and 0.143 p.p.m. 
respectively. These figures show that Star had a B.O.D. 32 percent 
higher than Cottage and Muir 186 percent higher than Cottage. 

Even though the B.O.D. is a fairly reliable criterion 
from which to predict the future oxygen content of the lake, the bottom 
ooze, which composes the bulk of the mud, is just as important. This 
fact is revealed by the data in Table VII. As well as showing the B.O.D. 
of the lake water, the table also shows the total decrease of dissolved

oxygen in the water around the bottles during the same period of time. 

It is this decrease that indicates how seriously the mud depletes the 
oxygen. In Muir Lake, for instance, the bottled water depleted the 
oxygen by 1.0 p.p.m.. The total drop in the lake however, was 1.79 
p.p.m. in the same seven days. This means that 0.79 p.p.m. of oxygen 
were used by something other than the lake water. This ’something’ may 
very likely be the mud which would use the oxygen for the aerobic decom¬ 
position of the organic material in it. Since the organic content of 
the mud is fairly high, 0.5 g* of organic material per g. of dried mud, 
the reasoning above seems justified. 

The bottled water of Star Lake used an average of 2.13 
p.p.m. in 32 days. However, the water in the lake around the bottles 
depleted the oxygen by an average of only 1.41 p.p.m. for the same period. 
From these facts it would appear that the lake gained oxygen. This was 
not the case. It must be remembered that by this time of the winter the 
mud was almost isolated from the upper aerated water and thus little, if 
any, aerobic decomposition could be going on within the mud due to the 
very slow rate at which oxygen diffuses. However, the difference between 
the two figures above is only 0.72 p.p.m.. When average over the 32 days 
this means a difference of only 0.02 p.p.m. per day. This is a very small 
difference which could be an error in titration. Thus it may be said that 
the B.O.D. of the water was the only factor in depleting the oxygen and that 
the oxygen in the water in the sample bottles and the water in the lake were 
depleted to the same degree. 

It is difficult to explain the situation in Cottage Lake. 
Although there is certainly evidence that oxygen was used by the bottom 
mud, the mud contained only 0.2279 gms. of organic material per g. of dry 
mud which is less than ha3.f that of Muir. But the >Iuir Lake mud, though

much richer organically, was isolated from the oxygenated water by 
a layer of water containing little or no oxygen; therefore it could 
have less effect on the oxygen content of the supernatant water than 
the less rich mud of Cottage Lake. In Cottage Lake, there was no 
layer of deoxygenated water near or at the bottom and thus the aerobic 
decomposition of organic material in the ooze played an important 
part in depleting the oxygen. The depletion in the water averaged 
during the 39 day period, a drop of 1.9B p.p.m,, The data in Table 
V show that the greatest oxygen depletions were near or at the bottom 
in all cases; the oxygen near the surface was depleted to a lesser 
extent. Another ejjplanation of this increased oxygen depletion near 
the bottom in Cottage Lake may be that the organic material (dead 
summer plankton) present in the water settled to the bottom and in 
doing so increased the B.O.D. of the water near the bottom. But as 
this did not occur in the other two lakes it seems a less reasonable 
hypothesis. Star Lake showed a higher B.O.D. near the surface and 
Muir Lake showed a relatively even distribution of B.O.D. with only 
a slight tendency to increase at about the 15 to 20 foot depth. 

The facts presented so far have proven the importance of 
the role played by the mud in the depletion of the oxygen in lakes 


under winter conditions

6 Effect of Sunlight 

It was mentioned previously that the high oxygen content of Star 
and Cottage Lakes at the start of the season was due mainly to run-off 
water. However, this increase may also be associated with the amount 
of sunlight during that period. It must be remembered that at the 
beginning of the winter the ice remained fairly thin for a comparatively 
long period and very little snow cover was present. These conditions are 
conducive to the production of oxygen by phytoplankton and other aquatic 
plants since the light rays can easily penetrate the ice (Greenbank, 1945). 
The oxygen produced during this period could not escape into the air, 
therefore the water would become supersaturated vd.th oxygen or, at least, 
the oxygen depletion which was taking place would be less rapid. The 
following figures show daily records of hours of bright sunlight from 
October 28th to November 6th inclusive: 3*0. 7.6, 0.0, 8.7, 7.S, 7.1, 715, 
4.9, 0.0, 2,9. During this period both Star and Cottage lakes gained 
oxygen under the ice. From November l6th to November 30th the following 
were the reported sunlight records: 5.3, 6.0, 1.0, 5*7, 5.6, 0.1, 7.7, 

7.2, 7.0, 7.6, 7.5, 7.1, 6.3, 7.4, 6.8. In this period the oxygen in 
Cottage Lake rose markedly especially from November 21 to November 30th 
(the period of greatest sunlight). There was no rise in oxygen in Star 
Lake because of a cover of snow (which blew off Cottage Lake); in Muir 
Lake there was no increase in dissolved oxygen but there was a marked 
decrease in the rate of oxygen depletion. Cottage Lake suffered the 
same rate of oxygen depletion as the other two lakes and had it not been 
for this early winter period when the v/ater became supersaturated, it 
would have declined to the same very low oxygen levels, by spring, as

the others did. The excess is readily seen if the oxygen is computed 
as percent saturation. From saturation tables given by Mortimer (195^) 
the following figures were obtained for Cottage Lake.

In making these calculations the altitude of the lakes were 
taken as 2,000 feet above sea level and the appropriate corrections 
were made for water temperature* 

From these facts it is seen that the amoiint of sunlight has 
an important effect on the dissolved oxygen in a lake when ice cover 
has formed. However, sunlight is effective only when the ice is thin 
(up to three inches) and the snow cover is not extensive. If the ice 
becomes thicker or the snow deeper the amount of light penetration 
becomes negligible and the photosynthetic production of oxygen is 
el imin ated. But, as in Cottage Lake, if the ice remains thin for a 
realtively long period of time at the start of the winter season and 
the B.O.D* of the water is not very high, there is an increase in 
oxygen content that might mean the difference between life and death 


to the fishes

VIII SUMMARY 

1) Three lakes in the Jidxnonton area, Starr, Muir, and Cottage, were 
chosen for a study of winter conditions, particularly dissolved 
oxygen. 

2) The depths of the lakes were measured to establish sampling 
stations (see 4 below). 

3) The thickness of the ice and the amount of snow cover were noted 
from time to time. 

4) Sampling stations were established at the 5, 10, 13-foot and 
deepest depths. They were numbered 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively. 

5) Water samples were taken with a Kemmerer bottle as follov^s: 

Station No. 

1 surface and five feet (bottom). 

2 5 feet and 10 feet (bottom). 

3 5 feet, 10 feet and 13 feet (bottom). 

4 surface, 3 feet, 10 feet, 13 feet, 20 feet and bottom. 

Samples were taken twice in every three weeks from each lake during the 
period October 17, 1936 to May 3, 1937. 

6) The temperatur^e^of the water was taken at every level at the same 
time that a water sample was taken. 

7) The dissolved oxygen content of the water samples was determined by 
the unmodified 'Winkler method. 

8) The oxygen demand of samples of the water was determined in sealed 
bottles suspended in the lake belov/ the ice. 

9) Plankton hauls x^rere taken at Station 4 each time a lake was visited. 

10) Samples of the muds were dried and the amounts of organic material 
they contained estimated by measuring the loss in weight on incineration. 

11) Nets were set to see if there was a correlation between oxygen

depletion and any fish mortality that might occur. 

12) Oxygen was depleted from all three lakes to the point where fish 
would be e^qpected to asphyxiate. Only in Star Lake was a partial winter 
mortality observed. 

13 ) The three lakes lost their oxygen at about the same rate. 

14 ) The oxygen demand of the water was the greatest factor in the 
depletion of the oxygen; almost as large a factor was the aerobic 
decomposition of organic materials within the mud. 

15 ) The photosynthetic production of oxygen by phytoplankton while 
the ice cover was thin and snow-free at the start of winter probably 
greatly decreased the period of oxygen depletion, thus helping to 
keep the oxygen at or just above the lethal levels for trout. 

16 ) The water at or near the bottom, especially at the deepest 
stations, lost oxygen most rapidly. This depletion is believed to 
have been caused by the mud. The rate of oxygen depletion at this 
level decreased as the mud became separated from the upper oxygenated 
water by a layer of deoxygenated water. 

17 ) The lethal oxygen level for trout acclimatized to winter condi¬ 
tions is shown to be about 1.25 p.p.m.. Fish acclimatized to these 
conditions appear to cease moving as none were caught in nets or by 
angling. 

18) The winter of 1956-57 was an average one for this region; the 
ice-cover lasted for 182 days. The maximum depth of ice formed during

this period was four feet but for most of the season the average 
depth was about two-and-one-half feet. 

19) The water temperature did not fluctuate greatly. Immediately 
under the ice the temperature was close to 1.0° C.; from here down the 
temperature gradually increased to close to 4^ C. at the bottom. 

IX CONCLUSIONS 

1) Much too little research in this field has been done. 

2) A winter mortality of fish is an always present probability in 
eutrophic lakes like the ones studied. 

3) As yet no suitable method of predicting the probability of a winter 
mortality has been established. This fact was shown by the observations 
on Muir and Star Lakes. At the beginning of the season it was predicted 
that Muir Lake was the most likely to produce a winter-kill. However, 
an unforeseen occurrence, a sudden rise of oxygen followed by a very 
rapid decrease in Star Lake, showed that to base a prediction on few 
isolated facts at the beginning of the season is foolish. Not until 
all the facts are obtained can one draw any reasonable conclusions as 

to what actually occurred. However, a very thorough study of a lake 
during the start of the season can give some indication of the probable 
course of oxygen depletion within the lake if it is remembered that 
many things may change during the season. 

4) Rainbow trout ( Salmo gairdneri ) can withstand low oxygen tensions 
for a considerable period of time. An example of this is provided by 
Muir Lake where the trout survived oxygen tensions below 2 p.p.m. for 
six weeks. This is believed to have been due to a) an acclimatization

to the low oxygen levels, b) a greater affinity of the fish 
haemoglobin for oxygen at the low temperatures, c) less activity 
by the fish, and d) a lower oxygen requirement due to a lower 
metabolic rate brought on by inactivity and low temperatures. 

5) The organic richness of the water at the start of winter is very 
important. If the oxygen demand is high the rate of oxygen depletion 
is also rapid. The rapid decrease of the oxygen at the start of the 
season means that the lethal level is reached more rapidly and there¬ 
fore the possibility of a winter-kill is much greater. 

6) The organic ricimess of the mud plays an important role in the 
initial decrease in oxygen. As long as there is oxygen present at or 
near the mud, aerobic decomposition of organic material occurs. 

However, as the oxygen is eliminated from the water just above the mud, 
the decomposition ceases and the mud no longer contributes to oxygen 
depletion. This cessation of oxygen depletion may aid greatly in keeping 
the oxygen tension above the lethal level if the stagnation period is 
prolonged. This is what probably happened in Muir Lake. 

7) If a period of sunny weather is experienced at the beginning of the 
season, when the ice is thin, oxygen is produced by higher plants and 
phytoplankton. The oxygen so produced cannot escape due to the ice 
cover. This additional oxygen could enrich the water sufficiently to 
prevent any winter mortality. It does so by shortening the period during 
which the oxygen is depleted.

8) The oxygen lack in a lake may not be the only factor in the winter 
mortality of the fish but it is the primary one. Noxious gases may 
play an important role. However, the individual action of these gases 
on fishes, or their possible indirect action by interference with the 
oxygen-combining capacity of the haemoglobin have not yet been 
evaluated. 


X REC0Mi:4MDATI0NS 

1) More studies of this type should be done if small lake management 
is to become completely successful. 

2) If such work is done, particular emphasis should be placed on the 
oxygen consuming powers of the mud and of the water, individually; and 
on the amount of sunlight that penetrates the ice. 

3) A lake in which trout stocking is planned should be examined as 
to size and shape as well as the three points mentioned above. Such 
an examination should last at least one season and preferably two.
