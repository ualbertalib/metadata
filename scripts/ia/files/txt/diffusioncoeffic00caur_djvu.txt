ABSTRACT 


Mercaptans have a dual role in the emulsion copolymerization 
of butadiene and styrene during the formation of various types of 
synthetic rubber. They act as promoters and also as chain-transfer 
agents or modifiers in the polymerization reaction, which is carried 
out in a soap-water emulsion. Prior to entering the reaction, the 
mercaptan must move from the emulsified organic phase, across a water 
boundary, to the locus of reaction in a soap micelle. One of the 
factors expected to govern the rate of migration would be its dif¬ 
fusion coefficient. 

In this research, the diffusion coefficients of mercaptans 
have been measured from diffusion currents observed at the dropping 
mercury electrode and from concentrations determined by amperometric 
titration. The polarographic method was used in measuring the diffusion 
currents. The results obtained in cm.^ sec."3- x 10"5 are as follows: 
hydrogen sulfide, 0.94? n-ethyl, 0.82$ n-propyl, 0.42; n-butyl, 0.39; 
tert-butyl, 0.34? n-hexyl, 0.26; n-octyl, 0.23; sec-octyl, 0.20; 
n-decyl, 0.20; n-dodecyl, 0.17; sec-dodecyl, 0.14; n-tetradeeyl, 0.15 
n-hexadecyl, 0.13; n-octadecyl, 0.12, An investigation was also 
carried out to study the effects of pH variation on the diffusion 
coefficient of hydrogen sulfide. It has been observed that the 
diffusion coefficient values increased as the pH values were decreased.

INTRODUCTION 


Mercaptans, organic compounds containing the sulfhydryl 
group, are important for the making of synthetic rubber. 

G.R.S. (Government Rubber, Styrene) the most important of 
the synthetic rubbers, is made by emulsion copolymerization of buta¬ 
diene and styrene. In general, an emulsion copolymerization system 
consists of five main ingredients, 

(1) 60J5 - water 

(2) 35 % - monomers, which are organic substances containing 
conjugated double bonds known as dienes, e.g. butadiene, styrene, etc. 

(3) 2 % - emulsifying agent such as soap in G.R.S. 

(4) about activating agent such as potassium persulfate 

(5) about modifier or chain transfer agent which usually 

is a mercaptan. 

This mixture Is placed in a vessel strong enough to with¬ 
stand the pressure of butadiene and to maintain the butadiene in the 
liquid state. The mixture is agitated to keep it in the emulsified 
form. In ten to twelve hours most of the monomers have reacted to 
form polymers. 

It has been found (7) that the presence of small amounts 
of relatively high molecular weight mercaptans, greatly promotes the 
emulsion conolymerization reaction of butadiene and styrene, using 
soap as the emulsifier and potassium persulfate as the catalyst. In 
the absence of the mercaptan, the rate of copolymerization at 50°G is 
extremely small. In the presence of aliphatic mercaptans the rate 
of reaction Is practically independent of the persulfate concentration 
within a wide range of concentrations and within wide limits, it is 

also independent of the amount of mercaptan added to the recipe.

Mercaptans as promoters in this type of recipe are extensively used 
in industrial practice. 

In addition to being an activator, the main function of 
the mercaptan in the copolymerization reaction is the regulation of 
molecular weight of the polymer formed (8). Thus the mercaptan also 
acts as a modifier in the copolymerization reaction. The mechanism 
of the action of mercaptans is that of transfer of chain activity 
symbolized by the following equations: 

Bjq* + RSH -*■ B m H + RS* (a) 

RS* + M RSM* (b) 

where B m * represents the activated growing polymer molecule, RSH 
represents a mercaptan molecule, BjqH represents a completed polymer 
molecule, and RS* the free radical from the mercaptan which, with a 
monomer molecule M, initiates the growth of a new polymer molecule. 

Before the mercaptan is able to act as a chain transfer 
agent, it is essential that it be in the locus of reaction, W.D. 
Harkins (2) has shown that at the start of the polymerization, the 
soap micelles are the locus of reaction. Therefore, prior to the 
chain-transfer reaction, the mercaptan, which is initially in solution 
in the monomers, must migrate from an oil droplet, across a water 
phase, to the locus of reaction In a soap micelle or polymer particle. 

Factors expected to govern this rate of migration are (a) 
the diffusion coefficient of the mercaptan ; and (b) the solubility 
of the mercaptan in the water phase. Experimental work on (b) has 
been carried out (l). The present work deals with the measurement 
of diffusion coefficients of various primary aliphatic mercaptans, 
mainly those members containing an even number of carbon atoms.

METHODS OF DETERMINING DIFFUSION COSFFICIBNTS 


Several methods are used in determining or predicting the 
diffusion coefficients of various substances in dilute solutions. 


A. Stokes-Sinstein Method 

The Stokes-Einstein equation for the diffusion coefficient 
of large spheres diffusing through a medium of small particles gives 
good results for collodial particles (10). The equation is 


D = BT ~ 1 (c) 

N 6 sr/T^r 

where D is the diffusion coefficient or diffusivity, cm.2/sec. 

R is the gas constant 
T is the absolute temperature in °K 
N is Avogadro*s number 

^ is the viscosity of solution in centipoises 
r is the radius of colloidal particles in cm. 


B. Conductometric Methods 

(1) H.3. Harned and R.L. Nuttall (3) have determined the diffusion 

coefficients of various substances in dilute aqueous solutions by the 
conductometric method. In this report the diffusion coefficient was 
computed from the equation 


D 


= a2 1 


TZ~ 


(d) 


where a is the depth of the conductance cell in cm. 

is the slope of the graph obtained by plotting the ln(Kg-E?p) 

against t 

Kg and Kj> are the conductances measured at the bottom and top 
of the diffusion cell and corrected for cell constant ratios, 
t is the time interval in hours.

(2) L. Meites (12) has reported that diffusion coefficients have 
been calculated from the Nernst equation. This equation for uniunivalent 
electrolyte is 



where U is the equivalent ionic conductance of cation at infinite 
dilution in cm.^ per ohm equivalent 

V is the equivalent ionic conductance of anion at infinite dilution 
in cm. 2 per ohm equivalent. 

R. Haskell (6) has published the Nernst equation for the general case 

d = _nL.fi + il™ ( f ) 

U + V[u v) 

where u is the valence of the cation 
v is the valence of the anion. 

C. Surface Tension Lowering Method 

R.S. Olson and J.S. Watson (13) proposed a method using 
surface tension measurements for the estimation of diffusion coeffi¬ 
cients of organic liquids in water solutions. 

In very dilute solutions the surface tension varies linearly 
with concentration (11). The surface tension lowering of an organic 
liquid in water solutions at a low concentration is the product of 
the slope of surface tension lowering-concentration curve and the 
concentration. When the concentration is kept constant, the surface 
tension lowering will be a function of the slope of the surface tension 
lowering-concentration curve. When diffusion coefficients, as obtained 
from literature, are plotted against the slope of the surface tension 
lowering-concentration curves, at low concentrations, a family of 
curves is obtained for variations in the surface tension lowering of 
pure organic liquids.

Langmuirs equation (11) 


E = E c + 625n (g) 

has been used to calculate the difference in potential energy that 
exists between the surface layer and the main body of the solution 
in equilibrium. In this equation E is the potential energy for any 
compound, Eo is the constant for the initial compound in a series and 
is expressed in calories per gram per mole, and n is the number of 
carbon atoms in the molecular formula minus one. Langmuir*s final 
equation for calculating E is 

E = 1318 log(l + 0.0695 (h) 


where C& is the concentration of the solute in moles per liter, 

aY is the lowering of surface tension in dynes per cm., and is 

°A 

the slope of the surface tension lowering-concentration curve at low 
concentrations. The slope can now be calculated by means of equation 
(h) where the value of E is determined from equation (g) with the 
aid of available literature for values of Eo. With 4Ythus determined, 

. C A 

or obtained from actual data and X at 20°C for pure liquids readily 
available in the literature, the diffusion coefficient at lf>°G can be 
estimated from the family of curves obtained from plotting known 
diffusion coefficients against the slope of the surface tension lowering 
concentration curves at low concentrations. 


D. Polarographic Method 

The polarographic method for determining diffusion coefficients 
is based on the interpretation of the current-voltage curves that are 
obtained when solutions of electro-oxidizable or electro-reducible 
substances are electrolyzed in a cell in which one electrode is the 
dropping mercury electrode (10). The curve obtained by plotting the

potential applied to the electrolytic cell against the resulting 
current is known as a current-voltage curve. A typical current-voltage 
curve obtained with the dropping mercury electrode is shown in Figure 1. 
In this figure the applied potential is plotted on the abscissa, and 
the corresponding current on the ordinate. Only an exceedingly small 
current, "residual current", flows through the cell until the decom¬ 
position potential is reached. ?fhen the decomposition potential is 
exceeded continuous electrolysis begins. The current does not increase 
indefinitely with increasing applied potential after the decomposition 
potential is exceeded, but gradually approaches a limiting value and 
finally becomes essentially constant and independent of further Increase 
in the applied potential. Under optimum conditions and with all other 
factors constant, the limiting current minus the residual current is 
directly proportional to the concentration of the electro-oxidizable 
or electro-reducible substance. 

The oxidizable or reducible Ions reach the surface of the 
dropping electrode under the Influence of two more or less independent 
forces: a diffusive force, proportional to the concentration gradient 
at the electrode surface, and an electrical force, proportional to 
the potential gradient at the electrode. When an excess of supporting 
electrolyte is present In the solution, the effect of the electrical 
force Is no longer operative and the limiting current is practically 
entirely the diffusion current. 

The decomposition potential depends on the particular electro- 
oxidizable or electro-reducible substance present in solution. The 
half-wave potential is defined as the potential of the dropping mercury 
electrode against an external reference electrode at that point of 
a current-voltage curve where the current is equal to one-half of its

limiting value. In contrast to the decomposition potential which 
depends on the concentration of the oxidizable or reducible substance, 
the half wave potential is, in general, independent of the concentration 
of the oxidizable or reducible substance. The residual current is due 
to a capacity or charging current plus a small faradaic current resulting 
from traces of impurities in ordinary distilled water, e.g. traces of 
copper.

Choice of Method 

The properties of mercaptans restricted the choice of exper¬ 
imental methods of determining coefficients to the polarographic one. 
Since mercaptans are practically non-electrolytes, the methods based 
on conductance measurements cannot be used. The limited solubility of 
the mercaptans in water excluded the use of the surface-tension lowering- 
concentration method. The method involving the use of the Stokes- 
Sinstein equation is applicable principally to colloidal particles. 

The polarographic method can be applied to either electrolytes or 
non-electrolytes in very dilute solutions. 

Some work had been carried out (5) in which the diffusion 
coefficient of various mercaptans were measured by the polarographic 
method. The results that were obtained are shown in Table I.

C. Methods 


The value for D in equation (j) can be written in the following 

form 

° = ( Km2/3 t l/6 }] (k) 

where K is a constant which includes n, and the factor 605. 

From previous experiments (4) n was found to be 1. In 
equation (k) the diffusion coefficient can be calculated if the 
remaining factors, i.e. m 2 /^ G and i^ are known. The methods 

by which these factors were determined are outlined below. 

(a) Determination of Capillary Constant (m^/^tV^) 

The factor, known as the capillary constant is 

dependent upon the characteristics of the capillary used in the 
dropping mercury electrode. The capillary constant is determined by 
measuring the rate of flow of mercury in mg. per sec. and the drop 
time in seconds. The drop time was adjusted to between three and 
four seconds by regulating the height of the mercury reservoir. 

The capillary constant was determined a number of times and 
the average taken. If the individual determinations showed large 
deviations from the average, the capillary was cleaned by allowing 
the mercury to drop in dilute nitric acid and then allowing it to 
drop in distilled water. 

The capillary constant was frequently checked by measurement 
of the drop time at the conclusion of each polarographic current- 
voltage reading. If a variation greater than l/lOth of a second 
was observed, a new capillary constant was determined for the new 
drop time.

(b) Determination of Diffusion Current (id). 


Previous experimental work (4) on the polarographic behaviour 
of aliphatic mercaptans had shown that the diffusion current of the 
mercaptan is'proportional to its concentration for all mercaptans 
studied when in very dilute solutions. In concentrated solutions of 
high molecular weight mercaptans, the diffusion current was independent 
of the concentration and for low molecular weight mercaptans, the 
diffusion current was proportional to concentration when the diffusion 
current was measured at the more positive potentials. 

This work had shown that the half wave potential was dependent 
upon the pH of the solution and that the half wave potential shifted 
to increasingly more negative potentials with increasing pH. For 
this reason the solution was buffered with a mixture of acetic acid 
and sodium acetate. 

The three hole stopper, C, in figure 3 page 13, containing 
the bent capillary tube with the collecting cup and the sintered 
bridge electrode was fitted on top of the cell. The collecting cup 
prevented the mercaptide on the mercury drops from coming in contact 
with the bulk of solution and thus minimized the dissolution of 
mercaptide formed as shown by the following equation, 

2 Hg° + 2 RSH 2 Hg 2 (SR) 2 + 2 H + + 2 e (1) 

This reversibility was proposed and investigated by W.E. 

Harris and E.H. Mottus (5) to explain the increase in height of the 
current-voItage curve of mercaptans above the residual current curve 
at the more negative potentials. 

Since the reduction of oxygen interferes with the measurement 
of current-voltage curves of the mercaptan, it was necessary to remove 
the oxygen from the cell solution. This was done by bubbling oxygen-

free nitrogen through the solution for thirty minutes. At the end 
of the thirty minutes, the nitrogen gas was switched to a tube leading 
to the top of the cell. This maintained an atmosphere of nitrogen 
above the cell solution, thus preventing any oxygen in the air from 
being absorbed during the measurement of the current voltages. 

The observed currents were plotted against the applied 
potentials to show the oxidation wave from which a limiting current 
reading could be obtained. This limiting current reading, as has 
been shown, is not the diffusion current since it also includes the 
residual current. This residual current, in addition to usual charging 
current also included the small reduction current due to traces of 
oxygen which are especially difficult to remove from alcohol solutions. 

The residual current was determined in a separate experiment 
by obtaining the current-voltage curve of the solvent and buffer 
without the added mercaptan, and subtracted from the limiting current 
values to give diffusion currents. 

(c) Determination of the Concentration of Mercaptan (C) 

The concentration of mercaptan was determined by amperometric 
titration. This involves titrating the mercaptan solution against a 
standard silver nitrate using a rotating platinum electrode and a 
depolarized reference electrode. 

In amperometric titrations, the current which passes through 
the titration cell between the indicator electrode and an appropriate 
depolarized reference electrode of suitable potential is measured as 
a function of the volume of a suitable titrating solution. The end 
point is taken as the point of intersection of the current volume 
lines before and after the end point.

The depolarized reference electrode used was a saturated 
calomel electrode at whose potential the silver ions are reducible 
at a platinum electrode. 

The reaction occurring during titration is symbolized by 
the following equation 

Ag + + RSH -► AgSR + H + (m) 

In the calculation of the concentration (C) of the mercaptan, 
the amount oxidized by the reaction during electrolysis at the dropping 
mercury electrode is negligible. That this is true is shown by the 
following calculation using the equation 

n = ^ (n) 

M x 96,500 


where n is the number of Faradays per mole of mercaptan oxidized 
M is the number of moles 
I is the current in amperes 
t is the time in seconds. 

In a typical case the observed current would be about 0.5 
microamperes or 5 x 10"' amperes. The average electrolysis time 
would be about 30 minutes or 1,800 seconds. As n was found to be 
1 by previous experiments the value of M would be 


m = —EL 

96,500 


(o) 


which by substitution with the values of I and t would give M a value 
of 9.0 x 10”9 moles. This amount is small compared to the amount used.

The procedure for obtaining the diffusion currents of various 
concentrations of a number of mercaptans is described below. 

Tv^enty-five ml. of the solution of the particular mercaptan, 
dissolved in a 70:30 solution by volume of ethanol and water was 
pipetted into the polarographic cell. To this mercaptan solution, 

10 ml. of buffer solution consisting of 70:30 alcohol-water solvent 
containing 0.1 N acetic acid and 0.05 N sodium acetate was added. The 
dropping mercury electrode and the bridge electrode were immersed and 
oxygen-free nitrogen gas was allowed to bubble through the cell 
solution for thirty minutes. During the bubbling with nitrogen gas, 
the water bath was brought to a temperature of 25°C t 0.1°, and this 
temperature was kept constant during the current-voltage readings. 

At the end of thirty minutes the nitrogen gas was changed 
from the tube leading to the bottom of the polarographic cell to the 
tube leading to the top of the cell. The dropping mercury electrode 
was put into the cell and the copper wires from the dropping electrode 
and selector switch were connected to the microammeter. The current 
was read at the various potentials and the drop time was checked. 

The electrodes ?/ere removed from solution and the collected mercury 
in the bent capillary tube was poured into a small beaker along with 
the portion of the cell solution, retained in the bent capillary tube 
by the globule of mercury. The volume of this small amount of cell 
solution was later measured. 

The cell containing the solution was then taken out of the 
water thermostat and the contents poured into a large beaker containing 
1 ml. of 0.1 N sulfuric acid. The sulfuric acid acts as an indifferent 
electrolyte and reduces the resistance of the solution. About 25 ml. 





of ethanol was used to wash the cell and the wash portions were added 
to the solution in the beaker. The beaker was then placed in the 
proper position in the amperometric titration apparatus. The motor 
was switched on and the copper wires from the two electrodes were 
connected to the microammeter. Silver nitrate was run from a 10 ml. 
burette into the solution. When the silver ions were present in 
excess the current began to flow. Additional amounts of silver nitrate, 
in about ■§■ ml. portions were added and the current was measured after 
each addition. The volume of silver nitrate used was noted for each 
current reading. Enough silver nitrate was added to produce a final 
reading of about 7 to 10 microamperes. 

The current readings obtained during amperometric titration 
were plotted against the volume of silver nitrate used. The inter¬ 
section of the current volume lines was taken as the end point. 

The mercaptan concentration was calculated according to the 
following equation 

x M]_ = V 2 x M 2 (p) 

where is the volume of silver nitrate in ml. 

is the molarity of silver nitrate in moles per liter 
V 2 is the volume of mercaptan solution transferred from the 
polarographic cell. 

M 2 is the concentration of mercaptan solution in moles per 

liter. 

Substituting the values of i^ and G as explained above and 
the capillary constant m2/3tl/6, in equation (k) the diffusion coeffi¬ 
cient of the particular mercaptan was calculated. The diffusion 
coefficients were determined for each mercaptan over a range of 
coneentrations.

In the calculation of the concentration of the mercaptan, 
a correction was applied for the amount of cell solution that was 
retained in the bent capillary tube in the polarographic cell. As 
this amount was not present during the titration of the mercaptan, 
it had to be subtracted from the original volume used. 

Since a few of the lower weight mercaptans are extremely 
volatile, their concentrations were determined by back titration. 

In these cases, a measured amount, in excess, of 0,001 N silver nitrate 
was added to the polarographic cell solution immediately after the 
current voltage readings were obtained. This mixture was transferred 
to the beaker and titrated amperometrically with 0.001 N potassium 
iodide. The amount of silver nitrate reacted with mercaptan was 
obtained by subtracting the excess silver nitrate from the total 
amount added. The back titration procedure was used for hydrogen 
sulfide, n-ethyl and n-propyl, and tert-butjdL mercaptans. 



EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 


Figure 7 shows a typical current voltage curve obtained 
with a dropping mercury electrode for n-hexyl and n-dodecy.1 mercaptans 
along with the residual current curve. 

Table II shows the diffusion coefficient data obtained with 
the dropping mercury electrode for hydrogen sulfide over a range of 
concentrations and at various pH values. The mean deviation of the 
diffusion coefficient values along the average deviation from the 
mean is shown in column 4 in Table II. The pH values in the first 
column of Table II viere calculated for sulfuric acid and sodium hydroxide 
on the basis of complete dissociation. The pH values of the buffer 
solutions were calculated from the dissociation constants for the 
particular acids used in the buffer solution. It was assumed that the 
pH values of the alcohol-water mixtures would be nearly the same as 
those calculated for water as solvent. The plus or minus figures 
(e.g. ± 0.6) in column 4 in Table II and column 5 in Table III are 
the average deviation of the mean.

The hydrogen sulfide, n-ethyl, n-propyl, n-butyl(a) and 
n-hexyl(a), cell solutions in Table III, consisted of the mercaptan in 
70:30 ethanol-water mixture by weight and the buffer of 0.1N acetic 
acid and 0.05N sodium acetate in water. The n-butyl(b), n-hexyl(b), 
n-octyl, sec-octyl, n-decyl, n-dodeeyl, sec-dodecyl, n-tetradecyl, 
n-cctadecyl, tert-butyl cell solutions in Table III contained a 70:30 
ethanol-water mixture by weight. Since it was found that the diffusion 
coefficient values of n-butyl and n-hexyl mercaptan were similar for 
the two slightly different solvents, it was assumed that the diffusion 
coefficient values of hydrogen sulfide, n-ethyl and n-propyl mercaptan

would also be similar for both cell solutions. 

The large average deviations shown in Table III for ethyl 
mercaptan and in Table II for hydrogen sulfide were probably due to 
the difficulties encountered in determining the concentration due to 


the high vapor pressure of the mercaptan.

The diffusion coefficient values of Table IV are distinctly 
lower than those obtained by Mottus (5), Table I. A considerable 
amount of time was spent in checking the experimental technique and 
every precaution was taken to ensure that the same conditions of the 
previous worker (5) were used. As far as can be determined, at 
present, the diffusion coefficient values obtained by the author 
are not in error. 

Due to the limited solubility of the higher molecular weight 
mercaptans in water, the diffusion coefficients were determined in 
ethanol-water mixtures. The object of this research was to determine 
the diffusion coefficients of mercaptans with water as the solvent.

Therefore the ratio, , where D(HpO) is the diffusion 

D(ET0H:H 2 0) 

coefficient of the mercaptan in pure water and D(ET 0 H:H 20 ) is the 
diffusion coefficient of the mercaptan in ethanol-water mixtures, 
which was determined by Mottus (5), was applied to the diffusion 
coefficients of the mercaptans in ethanol-water mixtures. This gave 
values of the diffusion coefficients of mercaptans in pure water as 
solvent. Table V shows the calculated diffusion coefficient values 
of mercaptans on the basis of pure water as the solvent using this 
ratio. Column n a n shows the calculated diffusion coefficient values

A number of attempts were made to establish a relationship 
between the increasing molecular weight of the mercaptan and the 
decreasing diffusion coefficient values. The best straight line 
relationship between these quantities is that shown in Figure 8.

of the substance at infinite dilution in aqueous solution at 25°G 
would be

Using equation (t) the following diffusion coefficient 






values that obtained for butyl, decyl and tetradecyl mercaptan are 
0.70 x 10"^ 0.55 x,10“5, and 0.54 x 10“5 respectively. 

Comparing the calculated diffusion coefficient values of 
mercaptan using the Stokes 1 Einstein equation with the calculated 
diffusion coefficient values in Table IV indicates a closer agreement 
with Mottus' results than with the author’s results. 

Substituting the known diffusion coefficient values of 
iso-butyl alcohol (13) in Stokes-Einstein equation the results had 
indicated the calculated values (0.73 x 10“5) were lower than the 
experimentally measured values (0.77 x 10~5). This would mean that 
the actual values of the diffusion coefficient when calculated by 
the Stokes-Sinstein equation would be higher. 



SUMARY 


The diffusion coefficients of various mercaptans were measured 
in alcohol-water mixtures and calculated for diffusivity in water. 

The diffusion coefficient values of the secondary and tertiary mer¬ 
captans were found to be lower than those of the corresponding primary 
mercaptan. The results obtained in cm. 2 sec# -l x 10"5 are as follows: 
hydrogen sulfide 0.94; n-ethyl 0.82; n-propyl 0.42; n-butyl 0.39; 
tert-butyl 0.34; n-hexyl 0.26; n-octyl 0.23; sec-octyl 0.20; 
n-decyl 0.20; n-dodecyl 0.17; sec-dodecyl 0.14; n-tetradecyl 0.15; 
n-hexadecvl 0.13; n-octadecyl 0.12. 

The effect of pH variation on the diffusion values of hydrogen 
sulfide indicated that the diffusion coefficient increases with 
decreasing pH. 

Small errors in the measurement of the diffusion current 
and in' the measurement of the concentration of the mercaptan make 
relative large differences in the calculated values of the diffusion 
coefficient. 

No explanation has been presented for this lack of agreement 

between Mottus’ (5) diffusion coefficient values and the author’s 

diffusion coefficient values, although it has been suggested that the 

ratio, D(H20) , be determined by the author and the diffusion 

D(ET0H:H20) 

coefficient values of mercaptan with pure water as the solvent be 
calculated from this ratio.
