FACTORS INFLUENCING INFECTION OF CEREALS BY 


THE ERGOT FUNGUS 


S* G* Fushtey 


INTRODUCTION 


The fungus Claviceps purpurea (Fr*) Tul* which causes 
the Ergot disease of cereal crops and other grass plants is 
Lisually most important as a pathogen of rye* It has generally 
been of minor importance on barley, common wheat, and oats, 
but recently has been reported to occur rather abundantly on 
one of our new barley varieties, namely Montcalm* This has 
been one factor which has stimulated a new interest in the 
study of its pathogenic capabilities* 

The ergot fungus is important from two different stand¬ 
points: 

(1) it decreases the yield and quality of the products of 
affected crops 

(2) it is poisonous and renders grains and grasses unfit as feed 


for livestock

Considerable losses of crops, livestock, and even human life, 
have been experienced throughout the world over a long period 
of years# 

Crop losses are represented not only by the number of 
grains which are visibly transformed into ergot bodies but also 
by a large number of blasted florets# Ergot has been partic¬ 
ularly severe on rye and durum wheat in North Dakota* The 
disease is very common in Alberta and in certain seasons is 
highly destructive to rye and occasionally of some importance 
in barley and common wheat# 

Sickness, and even death resulting from the consumption 
of ergot bodies in grains occurred as far back as the time of 
Caesar# Ergotism, a disease of humans and animals caused by the 
use of ergotized grain for food, has been, and in some regions 
still is, responsible for considerable losses# In 1922 an epi¬ 
demic of ergotism in Spain and Prance cost, according to some 
estimates, approximately lj.0,000 lives (Ip.)# Reports of ergot 
poisoning in animals is not uncommon even today# 

That conditions of environment play no small part in 
the development of the ergot disease is indicated by the fluct¬ 
uation in severity of the disease from season to season and 
from place to place. Jones (22) emphasizes the importance of 
studying these conditions# He points out that the time has come 
when we should put relatively less stress upon the parasite as an

independent organism and relatively more on the disease* As 
the first step in this he urges that increased attention be 
given to the study of the relation of the environment to disease 
inception and development# This relationship is abundantly- 
illustrated by examples of studies of the ergot disease# 

Weniger (Ip.) has noted that very little ergot occurs in dry 
seasons, whereas there may be abundant infection in wet seas¬ 
ons# Also, Hynes (21) concluded that the limiting factor to 
success in producing ergot commercially is the uncertainty of 
weather conditons when the rye comes into flower© Only in 
cooler, moister localities should such a project be undertaken# 
In 1875, Wilson, as reported by Atanasoff (2), sug¬ 
gested that there may exist a relationship between the length 
of period during which the glumes are open and the amount of 
infection# Another interesting aspect was introduced by Stager 
who, as reported by Weniger (I 4 I) described the occurrence of 
biologic races within species of the ergot fungus# 

The development of epiphytotics of ergot would there¬ 
fore seem to be dependent on a combination of factors involv¬ 
ing the host, the parasite, and the environment*

LIFE CYCLE OF CLAVICEPS PURPUREA 


C * purpurea (Fr*) Tul. is an ascogenous fungus belong¬ 
ing to the family Hypocreaceae. It produces three distinct 
stages in its life cycle: 

(1) The vegetative mycelium, which permeates and destroys the 
young ovaries of susceptible host plants and produces an 
asexual or conidial stage (the sphacelial stage) on the 
surface of the young fungus growth* 

(2) The matured sclerotia or ergot bodies which are dormant 
or resting structures formed from the mycelium. These 
permit the pathogen to live through the winter or other 
unfavorable periods* 

(3) The ascigerous or sexual stage, which is formed when the 
sclerotia germinate* This produces ascospores* 

The first infections of each growing season usually 
originate from wind-blown or insect-borne ascospores* These 
reach the young ovary of an open flower, germinate, and the 
resulting hyphae invade the tissues of the ovary replacing it 
by a fungus growth which maintains the general shape of the 
ovary* The surface of this fungus body is channeled or con¬ 
voluted and is covered with short conidiophores which produce 
enormous numbers of hyaline, ovate or sphaeroid conidia (Fig* 

1, A)* During this stage of development, there is a copious

secretion of "honeydew” which collects in droplets at the 
edges of the glumes and is teeming with these newly formed 
conidia. This sphacelial stage is said to be visited by in¬ 
sects which carry the conidia to other flowers and thus 
spread the fungus during the flowering period* 

As growth progresses, the development of conidia 
gradually ceases, the mycelium becomes gradually compacted, 
the structure thickens and the superficial hyphae turn violet 
colored* This change progresses upwards until the entire 
sphacelial stage has disappeared and in its place is formed a 
horny, dark-colored sclerotium which projects out of the ear, 
(Pig* 1, B and 0)* These sclerotia either fall to the ground 
or are mingled with the harvested seed* 

After a resting period, normally from fall to the 
following spring, the sclerotia which are lying on or in the 
soil germinate by the production of stromata, each consisting 
of a slender, reddish, pale-violet or whitish stalk surmounted 
by a reddish, flesh or fawn-colored, globular head, (Pig* 1, D)• 
This stromata! head or sphaeridium is covered with minute ele¬ 
vations, the projecting ostioles of the perithecia, embedded in 
the periphery, (Pig* 1, E and P)* ^he perithecia are filled 
with curved, hyaline asci each containing a bundle of eight 
slender, hyaline, septate, needle-shaped spores, (Pig* 1, G and 
H)* The ripened ascospores are expelled from the asci, and if 
picked up by the wind or by insects and carried to open flowers 
of susceptible hosts may initiate the disease*

SCOPE AND PURPOSE OF THE PRESENT STUDY 


The present work was confined to a study of the con- 
idial stage, the repeating or multiplying stage, of the 
ergot fungus* Not only is it of major importance in rel¬ 
ation to the development of the disease but it can be produced 
at will in artificial culture and hence lends itself to in¬ 
vestigation in the laboratory* In nature, conidia are found 
in abundance in the honeydew which is secreted in the early 
stages of disease development in the host. Ihis may multiply 
rapidly under favorable conditions, and may bring about severe 
outbreaks from a comparatively small amount of initial inocu¬ 
lum* Hence it is important to study the influence of the en¬ 
vironment on the conidial stage and on infection produced by 
it. 

The present study was undertaken for the purpose of 
improving techniques of inoculating host plants so that these 
might be available for testing ergot resistance of the cereal 
varieties and hybrids. 

The work was divided into two related but separate 
fields of study and is reported under two main sections: 

Part I - Germination of Conidia. 

Part II - Infection of the Host.

PART I 


FACTORS INFLUENCING GERMINATION OF CONIDIA 


Introduction 


Since all fungus diseases must begin with infection 
and since germination of the spore often precedes infection, 
knowledge of the conditions which favor or inhibit spore germ¬ 
ination is important* 

The factors influencing germination of fungus spores 
are usually divided into two types; hereditary or internal, 
and environmental or external* Internal factors Include mat¬ 
urity, longevity, dormancy, and vitality of spores* External 
factors, which constitute the group of factors involved in the 
present study, include moisture, temperature, pH, light, and 
kind and concentration of nutrients*

Numerous observations have been made on the factors 
influencing spore germination in many different fungi but in¬ 
formation of this nature for the fungus Cj*. purpurea is prac¬ 
tically non-existent« McCrea (28) conducted careful experiments 
to determine the effects of variations of environment on the 
fungus in saprophytic culture but no spore germination studies 
were reported* Reference to the m rk of others on spore germ¬ 
ination is, therefore, necessarily confined to studies of fungi 
other than <% purpurea * 

Since the present study deals with external factors 
brief mention of internal factors is made here mainly to illus¬ 
trate some of the basic properties of spores in general, and to 
relate these properties to ergot conidia* 

,f Dormancy n is a characteristic exhibited by spores 
of many fungi* Zygospores and oospores of phycomycetes, chla- 
mydospores of smut fungi, and teliospores of rust-fungi require 
a period of dormancy before they are able to germinate* Davis 
(9) stored spores of Ustilago striaeformis in the laboratory 
for about 2l|_0 days before he could secure germination* Ergot 
conidia apparently require no such dormancy period* This could 
be expected from the nature of field infection which occurs 
very soon after honeydew has been produced*

"Longevity” of spores varies with different fungi* 

As far back as 1872:, Brefeld, as reported by Wolf (l}lj.) noted 
that chiamydospores of Tilletia tritici , when kept dry in the 
herbarium for 8-J- years were still germinable. Those of Uro- 
cystis cepulae are reported to remain viable in the soil for 
at least 5 years* Smith ( 37 ) secured germination of spores of 
Myxomycetes from herbarium specimens 5 to 32 years after col¬ 
lection* On the other hand, conidial forms usually lose their 
ability to germinate much more rapidly* According to Aderhold, 
as reported by Doran (12), the conidia of Venturia inaequalis 
retain their viability no longer than 8 weeks* Stager, as re¬ 
ported by Atanasoff (2), demonstrated that conidia of Claviceps 
purpurea on immature sclerotia, stored in a dry condition, re¬ 
tained their viability and pathogenicity even after 10 months* 

"Maturity" of spores is very important in some species, 
Doran (12) reported that when conidia of V* inaequalis were ob¬ 
tained by brushing apple scab lesions, only 2%% as many conidia 
germinated as when conidia were obtained by washing with a 
stream of water* He explained that a large number of immature 
spores were obtained by the brush method* No references are 
available regarding germinability of immature conidia of C* 
purpurea but results from studies reported here indicate that. 


other factors being favorable, good germination can be obtained

with spores from cultures just beginning to sporulate as well 
as from those which are several weeks old* Furthermore, no 
differences in germinability were observed between spores 
obtained by mechanical removal from the mycelial mat and those 
removed by water alone. Maturity does not seem to be a limit¬ 
ing factor for germination of conidia of the ergot fungus, but 
a more comprehensive study of this factor is required to con¬ 
firm this observation. 

Regarding external factors, a detailed discussion is 
presented in the sections which follow* Each of the factors 
is treated separately, the literature review, experimental data, 
and other pertinent material being dealt with under the resp¬ 
ective factors concerned* 


Experimental Methods for Spore Germination Studies 


The hanging-drop technique initiated by Hoffman in 
i 860 and described by Duggar ( 15 ) was employed for most of the 
germination studies* Van Tieghem cells, about 2 cm. in dia¬ 
meter and 1 cm. deep were used throughout. These were cemented 
to glass slides by a mixture of refined beeswax and vaseline.

To maintain a high humidity within the cell, a few drops of 
the same solution used in the hanging-drop was added to the 
bottom of the cell before the covers were fixed in place. 

Each slide held two such cells and was enclosed in an ordinary 
Petri dish for protection while handling* 

Extreme care was taken in cleaning glassware to be 
used in these experiments* The dishes, cells, slides, pippetes, 
etc* were all thoroughly cleaned in acid dichromate cleaning 
solution, washed thoroughly in distilled water and allowed to 
soak in fresh distilled water for at least 12 hours before use* 
The glass cells, and cover slips in particular, were boiled in 
the cleaning solution, washed repeatedly in distilled water to 
remove all visible traces of the cleaning agent, boiled for at 
least 15 minutes in a fresh change of water and finally stored 
in fresh distilled water for at least 12 hours before use* 

In spite of all these precautions very irregular 
results were obtained in replicates of some of the treatments* 
Duggar (15) experienced similar irregularities in his work 
when using conditions which ordinarily do not cause abundant 
germination* He explained that volatile or soluble substances 
used besides the medium employed may have undesirable effects. 
Even the purest vaseline may have an effect on sensitive forms. 
He therefore used a modified method for cultures where the full

nutrient media were not employed# r ^he cells were used in 
Petri dishes# Filter paper with holes made for the insert¬ 
ion of the cells, to secure them against movement, was placed 
in the bottom of the dishes# The cover slips were laid on the 
cells without vaseline# All cultures were kept in moist 
chambers# 

In the later experiments of the present study an 
adaptation of Duggar ! s modified method was employed# The fil¬ 
ter paper in each dish was soaked with sterile distilled water 
to provide a moist atmosphere within the dish* Cover slips 
were fixed to t he cells by touching the outside edge of the 
glass ring with a drop of water which spread rapidly around 
the ground surface of the glass cell and secured the covers 
against sliding when handled# This method, in addition to 
eliminating the possible interference by volatile materials 
in the cementing substances, also eliminated all the labour 
involved in applying the cement substances and in removing 
them before the cells could be used again* 

Spores were obtained from cultures grown on test- 
tube slants of Leonian*s agar medium as given by Rawlins 
Three per cent agar was used to provide a lasting, firm medium, 
which did not break up when spores were being removed# The 
cultures were grown in the laboratory at room temperatures and

spores were harvested as needed from cultures 10 to 20 days 
old* The spores were removed by washing with small amounts 
of sterile distilled water, sometimes using a very flexible 
wire loop to disturb the surface of the culture and thus 
release additional spores* Small amounts of this heavy spore 
suspension were then added to the test media, drops of which 
were transferred to the clean, dry cover slips made ready for 
the preparation of the Van Tieghem hanging-drop cultures. 

These cover slips were then inverted, placed on the glass 
rings and fixed in place as described in the preceding paragraph. 
Before the cultures were set aside for incubation they were 
examined microscopically to make sure that the concentration was 
sufficient to permit a count of at least 100 spores per cul¬ 
ture but not so high as to interfere with ready observation. 


Effect of Temperature on Germination of Conidia 


One of the most important external factors bearing 
upon the germination of fungus spores is the temperature rel¬ 
ation* A number of fungi have been studied with respect to 
the influence of temperature on germination of spores* For

example, Doran (12) assembled in tabular form, data on the 
influence of temperature on spore germination of a variety 
of plant pathogenic fungi* His reports indicate that the aver¬ 
age cardinal (minimum, optimum, and maximum) temperatures for 

Phycomycetes are 1*2°C., l8°C*, and 26.1°C. - a range of 25*0 

o ,o 

degrees; and for conidia of Vjl inaequalis ; 3 C*, 15 C*, and 
31°C* - a range of 28*0 degrees. Germination of conidia of 

V* inaequalis dropped rapidly belov/ 12°C* and above 18°C* 

Regarding C_* purpurea , McCrea (28) reported that the 
grov/th of this fungus in agar culture occurs over a wide range 
(18° - 30°C.) but is slow and scanty at 10°C*, and is completely 
inhibited at 37°C., although growth is resumed if the culture 
is returned to optimum levels* fhese reactions do not necess¬ 
arily hold for germination of spores, for according to Doran 
(12), there is no reason to believe that the optimum temperature 
for the growth of a fungus is the same as the optimum tempe r- 
ature for spore germination* He maintained that each should be 
studied separately. 

Further reference to temperature effects was made 
by Hershenson and Plaut (20) who reported on inoculation of 
rye with spores of £_* purpurea * They pointed out that the op¬ 
timum temperature for infection in the field is 20° - 30°C* 
and that very little infection occurs at temperatures outside

of this range* It is expected that the conditions for germ¬ 
ination of spores would more nearly approach those for in¬ 
fection since spore germination is prerequisite to infection* 
Nevertheless, since no specific data on the relation of tem¬ 
perature to germination of Claviceps conidia has been recorded 
to date, the study here reported was undertaken* 


Experimental 

Spores were added to hanging drops of sterile redis¬ 
tilled water, the cultures being prepared as described in the 
section on experimental procedure, using the adaptation of 
Duggar 1 s methods* An inadequate number of glass rings made it 
necessary to limit the range of temperatures tested in one ex¬ 
periment so that the first set of experiments covered the range 

o ,o o 

10 to 25 C* and was followed with another at the range 20 to 

4.o°c. 

Considerable difficulty was encountered in obtaining 
reproducible results when using spores from artificial culture* 
Spores in a large number of cells did not germinate at all when 
those in other cells, under the same conditions, germinated 
quite well. Repetition of these experiments yielded similar 
results*

It was suspected that probably minute residues of 

cleaning solution or other impurities on the glass may have 

been responsible for such behaviour and that the precautions 

taken in rinsing the glassware may have been inadequate. The 

glass rings and cover slips were therefore soaked for an extra 

2l\. hours in several changes of distilled water before use* 

Results still failed to improve* In order to secure comparable 

replicates, 8 cells were prepared for each treatment, only [{. 

showing best germination eventually being used for observations* 

Finally, a dilution of conidia from honeydew on 

immature sclerotia, which had been stored in the refrigerator 
o 

at about 20 C* for 2 months, was used as a source of spore 
material* 

The results are reported in Table 1 under the fol¬ 
lowing headings:

1* Spores from artificial culture at 10 to 25 C» 

o . o 

2* Spores from artificial culture at 20 to qO C* 

o ,o 

3* Spores from honeydew at 10 to 25 0* 

One hundred to 200 spores were counted in each of the cells 
selected to represent the particular temperature 3e vel* The 
average germination percentages in Table 1 are therefore based 
on counts of at least 500 spores*

Because little was known regarding the time required 
for germination of the conidia, it was decided that observa¬ 
tions be taken at intervals beginning at 18 hours and ending 
at 96 hours* The data indicate that I 4.8 hours would be the 
best period of incubation at which to make spore counts in sub¬ 
sequent experiments* 

An interesting observation was that spores from natur¬ 
ally produced honeydew germinated better than those from artific¬ 
ial culture* Furthermore, development of germ tubes from the 
former was much more rapid than from the latter* For instance, 
in I 4.8 hours at 25°C* the germ tubes of the natural conidia were 
too long to permit counting, whereas, those of spores from art¬ 
ificial culture were not more than 100 microns long, and could 
be counted without difficulty. It is possible that spores from 
natural sources are more vigorous or that spores from artificial 
culture are much more sensitive to some undetermined factors which 
tend to inhibit germination under the conditions provided. 

In order to avoid the necessity of having to draw 
conclusions from data as variable as those presented in Table 1, 
a complete experiment covering the range 10 to I 4 .O C* was set 
up once a sufficient number of glass rings was obtained® An 
attempt was made to eliminate erratic germination such as 
occurred in some of the previous experiments by using spores 
from honeydew, produced on rye in the greenhouse during some 
of the infection studies.

Notes on germination and germ tube length were 
taken after l\Q hours of incubation. The results are presented 
in the graph in Fig. II. The average germ tube length was 
determined by selecting that length which seemed to predominate 
in the particular treatment and measuring it by means of an 
ocular micrometer. 

It is interesting to note that germination and 
growth of germ tubes varied together and that both fell off much 
more rapidly at temperatures higher than the optimum than at 
temperatures below optimum. i hese observations indicate that 
the two processes are affected similarly by temperature. 

According to the graph, the optimum temperature for 

both germination and growth is 25°C* Actually, the series of 

experiments preceding that represented by the graph indicate 

o ,o 

that the optimum is somewhere between 20 and 2p C., probably 
nearer 25 ° than 20°, but the data thus far obtained do not 
permit a more accurate estimate. Similarly, the maximum tem¬ 
perature is between 30 ° and 35°C. and the minimum probably 
.o o 

between 5 and 10 C. 

To determine the influence of prolonged exposure 
to temperatures beyond the limits for germination, the cultures 
which had been incubated for ij_8 hours at 3$° and 40 °C., as 
well as spores in diluted honeydew which had been kept in ice 
for 4.8 hours, were incubated at 25°C* for a similar period.

The spores which had been frozen germinated quite readily 
while those which had been kept at the high temperatures did 
not germinate. 

Apparently, prolonged exposure to tempe ratures of 
o 

35 C. and higher tend to permanently inactivate conidia of the 
ergot fungus. 


Effect of Moisture on Germination of Conidia 


Water, either in liquid or vapour form, has long 
been recognized as essential to the germination of spores 
of fungi. An examination of the literature reveals that the 
moisture requirements for germination is not uniform for all 
spores. Doran (12) recorded that conidia of Sclerotlnia 
fructigena and Peronospora pygmea germinate only when in di¬ 
rect contact with water, but that conidia of Alternaria solani 
and V. inaequalis may germinate in moist air. However there 
is considerable variation in the moisture requirements of the 
different species of those fungi that do germinate in moist 
air. Brodie and Neufeld (6) found that conidia of Erisiphe 
polygoni germinated through a range of relative humidities from 
approximately zero to 100$. On the other hand, Clayton (7)

found that conidia and ascospores of inaequalis germinated 
on dry glass only if the relative humidity was 99 to 100$. 

A number of workers have noted the influence of 
moisture conditions in the field upon the process of infection 
by the ergot fungus but no data are available on the moisture 
requirements for germination of its spores. The work of 
Hershenson and Plaut (20), Hynes (21), and others, has ind¬ 
icated that a high ]e vel of humidity is required for infection 
to occur in the field. Ready germination of spores is un¬ 
doubtedly important in the initiation of infection and it 
seems likely that moisture is a controlling factor in this 
respect. To determine the extent to which moisture can be a 
controlling factor, the present study on the germination of 
conidia was undertaken. 


Experimental 

Saturated aqueous salt solutions, aqueous sugar 

solutions, and redistilled water were used to control the 

relative humidity within sealed 1-quart glass fruit jars, 

as described by Clayton (7)« The following materials at the 

o 

concentrations given and held at 20 C. provided theoretical 
relative humidities at the four levels indicated.

experiment indicated that, in this particular case, the 
effects of such variations would be unimportant. 

Observations were made at 2lp, I 4 . 8 , and 72 hours# 

Two preparations, one from each chamber, were removed at each 
interval, leaving four for the final reading# The preparations 
were removed from the glass rods, and inverted on slides covered 
with a film of water, for microscopic examination# Samples 
of the original spore suspension used in the above prepara¬ 
tions were also incubated in hanging-drop cultures for comp¬ 
arative purposes# 

No germination v/as observed in any of the dry glass 
preparations# Some germination occurred in l\B hours in the 
hanging-drop cultures, but germination v/as low even at 72 
hours# 

Following examination, the dry glass cultures from 
the different chambers were flooded with a drop of water and 
prepared in the form of hanging-drop cultures to determine the 
germinability of these spores which had been dry for 72 hours. 

No germination occurred in any of the cells after I 4.8 hours of 
incubation* The spores were apparently inactivated by the con¬ 
ditions of the previous experiment* 

The experiment was repeated using diluted honeydew for 
spore material# Results were the same as those of the pre¬ 
vious experiment except that spores in hanging-drop cultures

germinated very well (nearly 100$ in some cells) and there 
was some germination of spores at the 100$ relative humidity 
where small amounts of moisture had condensed on the surface 
of the glass carriers* No evidence of germination was found 
on any of the dry carriers after 72 hours incubation in the 
humidity chambers, or later, when these same carriers were 
incubated at 25>°C* as hanging-drop cultures* 

iTie results indicate that the conidia of C_* purpurea 
require contact with liquid water for germination* 


Effect of Nutrition on Germination of Conidia 


Some spores do not require external nutritive elements 
for germination* Other species are dependent upon the presence 
of sugars and minerals* Lin (27) reported that the conidia of 
Glomere11a cingulata require carbon, magnesium, nitrogen, and 
phosphorus for favorable germination* Cooper (8) found that 
various amino acids, vitamins, and other substances induced 
germination of Colie to tri chum glfeo sporioide s * Wolf (ij-4) men¬ 
tions that in general, where germination is difficult in water

alone, an attempt should be made to approximate natural con¬ 
ditions of germination# 

Preliminary observations in the present study in¬ 
dicated that spores from artificial agar cultures of C« 
purpurea do germinate, though poorly, in pure water, whereas, 
naturally produced spores in honeydew diluted in pure water 
germinate abundantly* This information, along with the report 
by Kirchoff ( 23 ) that undiluted honeydew corresponded to a 
2*33 molar sugar solution, suggested that sugars may be re¬ 
quired for abundant germination of conidia of purpurea * 
Experiments were therefore conducted to determine the effects 
of various sugars on spore germination# 


Materials and Methods 

The sugars tested were xylose, maltose, lactose, 
sucrose, glucose, fructose, and galactose* These were dis¬ 
solved in distilled water to make 1% solutions# The solutions 
were sterilized in an autoclave for 20 minutes at 1$ pounds 
pressure before being used# Van Tieghem cells were employed 

in the germination tests which were conducted at room temper- 
o o 

ature (20 - 2$ C#) A control, using pure redistilled water, 

was always included* The spores used were in all cases ob¬ 
tained from the surface of agar test-tube slant cultures by 
the flooding method*

Experimental 

Pour Van Tieghem hanging-drop cultures were pre¬ 
pared for each sugar# Notes were taken after 36 hours 
incubation at room temperature# The results from the first 
few experiments were so variable that a number of experiments 
using as many cultures as possible ?/ere considered necessary 
before any general conclusions could be drawn# The experiment 
was therefore repeated 5 times using 6 hanging-drop prepar¬ 
ations for each sugar tested# At least 100 spores were counted 
in each drop# The results are summarized in Table 2 and are 
expressed in terms of percentage germination, each value being 
based on a total of ipOO to 600 spores counted#

Not used in statistical analysis# 


With variations as great as that found in fructose, 
which varied over a range of 76 % between experiments, the 
average percentages of germination for the five experiments 
seemed highly unreliable# In order to provide some basis for 
discussion a statistical analysis of variance was carried out 
using the different experiments as replicates within one large 
experiment#

for in the conditions of the experiment. It is difficult 

to visualize what this factor may have been, ^he sugars 

used were always from the same lot, materials and methods 

were, as nearly as could be determined, the same for all 

experiments. r ^he only known condition that could have varied 

was room temperature but, as indicated by a previous section 

of this project, temperature variation between the levels of 
o o 

20 and 25 C. do not affect gemination to any great extent. 
It may be, that conidia are very sensitive to some factor 
such as the presence of some foreign material in minute 
quantities and that these materials contaminated the cul¬ 
tures at one time or another* It may also be that bacterial 
activity inhibited germination of spores in some cases* Con¬ 
siderable bacterial development was observed in some of the 
maltose solution cultures and germination of spores in these 
was obviously inhibited. On the other hand, spores in cul¬ 
tures in utiich no bacteria could be detected, geminated very 
poorly also* 

Nevertheless, it is demonstrated that sugars in¬ 
crease germination of conidia of C_. purpurea and that maltose 
is outstanding in this respect*

Germination with Respect to Concentration of Sugar Medium 

'^he undiluted honeydew, as reported by Kirchoff (23), 
corresponded to a 2.33 molar sugar solution.* ^he millions of 
conidia suspended in this honeydew remain dormant, or at least 
do not germinate, as long as the honeydew remains undiluted* 
Once the honeydew is diluted the conidia germinate readily 
if subjected to favorable temperature conditions. The follow¬ 
ing experiment was carried out to determine the maximum sugar 
concentration that will permit germination of conidia and at 
the same time to give some idea of the extent to which honey¬ 
dew must be diluted before germination will take place* 

Maltose solutions were used in place of the honeydew 
sugar and spores from artificial culture were suspended in 
these solutions for germination tests* The following con¬ 
centrations of maltose were prepared in distilled water: 2.0 
molar, 1.0 molar, 0.5 molar, 0.25 molar, 0.1 molar, and 0*05 
molar. A drop of a concentrated spore suspension was added 
to 10 ml. portions of each of the above solutions, mixed 
thoroughly, and single drop portions tested for germination 
in Van Tieghem hanging-drop cultures. Four cultures were 
prepared for each concentration. They were examined at the 
end of 36 hours incubation in humidity chambers at room 
temperature.

Good germination (70 - 80 %) took place in the 
0,05 and 0*1 molar solutions. About 20 % of the spores germ¬ 
inated in the 0.25 molar solution, and only a trace germinated 
in the 0.5 molar one. Hanging drops of both of the last two 
solutions increased in size during germination, indicating that 
further dilvLtion had taken place in the humid atmosphere of 
the chambers. No germination occurred in the 1.0 and 2.0 
molar solutions* 

These results indicate that, if natural honeydew 
is 2.33 molar, it is probable that at least tenfold dilution 
is necessary before any of the spores can germinate. For good 
germination this dilution should be doubled i.e. the 2.33 
molar sugar solution should be diluted 20 times to give an 
approximately 0.1 molar solution (approximately 3*6% sol¬ 
ution of maltose). Hater experiments showed that no measur¬ 
able difference in germination occurred in maltose solutions 
of 1 to concentrations. 

Since maltose gave by far the best germination of 
conidia, and since germination was not improved by increasing 
the concentration of maltose solution above l°/ 0$ the 1% maltose 
solution was adopted as the standard medium for spore sus¬ 
pensions for the inociilation work.

Effect of Light on Germination of Conidia 


Opinions on the effect of light on spore germination 
vary considerably* According to DeBary, as reported by 
Doran (12), light inhibits the germination of spores of 
Oomycetes* Melhus (30) found that light does not interfere 
with the germination of the conidia of Phytophthora infestans * 
Doran (12) tested the effect of sunlight on the germination 
of spores of A* solani and of conidia of S_* fructigena * He 
found that the spores of these fungi germinate quite as well in 
sunlight as they do in darkness, provided that the conditions 
of temperature and moisture remain near the optimum* ^he 
following investigation was carried out to determine the re¬ 
lationship of light and dark to the germination of conidia 
of C. purpurea » 


Experimental 

Van Tieghem hanging-drop cultures of the conidia 
were prepared in the usual manner* For the experiment 12 
Petri-dish humidity chambers, each containing two hanging- 
drop cultures were used* Four of these chambers were enclosed

in a hard, black paper box to exclude all light* The pre¬ 
parations were then all placed on a laboratory bench exposed 
to the light from windows along the west wall of the labor¬ 
atory* r £hey were all moved in the afternoon in order that 
the temperature would not be raised too high by the direct 
rays of the afternoon sun* In the evening, four of the 
chambers were moved to another room so that they might be 
exposed to continuous light for the entire incubation period* 
Light was provided by a double-tube flourescent fixture sus¬ 
pended at a distance of about I|_ feet from the top of the 
table on which the cultures were placed* They were returned 
to the daylight in the morning* 

Notes were taken after 2l\. and 36 hours of incubation* 
Since the cultures were prepared at 9?00 a*ra* the uncovered 
cultures had been 03 ? osed to two periods of daylight by the 
time of the final examination* ^he experiment was performed 
in mid-February with approximately 9 hours of daylight per 
day so that the total period of light and dark for the set of 
cultures which was not subjected to artificial lighting at 
night, was approximately the same, i*e* approximately 18 
hours of daylight and 18 hours of darkness* 

The results of germination counts at the end of the 
36 hour period are shown in Table 3 and are expressed in per¬ 
centage germination based on a total count of at least 200

Effect of pH on Germination of Conidia 


The reaction to pH has been determined for many 
species of fungi. Usually the pH range for germination is 
quite wide# Most fungi germinate and develop best in acid 
media* However, Webb, as reported by Wolf (4i^), found spores 
of Colletotrichum gossypii to germinate best within the alka¬ 
line range* The optimum pH for germination of most slime mold 
spores, as reported by Smart ( 36 ), was I 4..5 to 7*0* Conidia 
of Botritls cineria germinated over a range of pH from 1*6 to 
906 , depending on the nutrient in the medium, but the average 
range was 1|_.0 to 7*0 ( 36 ). 


Experimental 

I* In a preliminary experiment various levels of pH 

were obtained by the use of buffer solutions according to 
formulae of Gortner (l6)* The following solutions were 
prepared, all diluted to 20 cc* volumes to obtain the 
indicated pH:

The levels of pH were checked colorimetrically at the end 
of the experiment and all solutions remained unchanged ex¬ 
cept for pHg which changed to 7*6* It was suspected that 
sterilization may have been responsible for this change. 

If so, little information can be obtained from the above 
results except that no germination occurred at pH 3.0. 

The low germination at pH 7*0 could not have been caused 
by the difference in reaction since much higher germination 
occurred at both pH $ and 7*6* 

In a later experiment sterile distilled water was 
used as the medium and was adjusted to the desired pH with 
dilute solutions of HC1 and NaOH using an external electrode 
adaptation of the Beckman pH meter. One hundred cc. vol¬ 
umes in 200 cc. flasks were adjusted to the following re¬ 
actions: pH 3, 4, $, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11. Five ml. 

portions were transferred to Syracuse dishes (Ip per treat¬ 
ment) and a drop of spore suspension from natural honeydew 
was mixed into the contents of each dish. Van Tieghem 
hanging-drops were also prepared for these mixtures. Both 
types of preparations were incubated at room temperatures 
for 2Ip hours. Germination counts were then made by direct 
microscopic examination, about $00 spores being counted for 
each treatment. The results are shown in Table if.

The four replicates of each of the Syracuse dish solutions 
were bulked at the end of the experiment and the reactions 
again determined by the Beckman pH meter* The results are 
recorded in the last column of Table Ip* 

The change in pH here took place after the spores 
had been introduced to the medium since pH adjustment was 
not made until very shortly before the spores were added* 

Because the solutions were not buffered, it is likely that 
atmospheric CC >2 may have been responsible for lowering pH of 
the solutions on the basic side of neutrality but such 
could not be the case on the acid side* The acid solutions 
also tended to approach neutrality, but no satisfactory 
explanation for this can be provided on the basis of the 
work so far* 

In spite of these changes, it is probable that the con- 
idia had actually been exposed to the original pH during at 
least the initial period of germination* f ihe experiment, 
although not accurately controlled, did give results which 
may indicate the approximate effect of pH on the germination 
of the conidia of C_* purpurea * It would appear from the results 
that conidia of this fungus will germinate in distilled water 
over a range of pH from Ip to 10 but a range of Ip to 9 would 
be a safer estimate since germination was much inhibited at 
pH 10*

Lack of stability in the reaction of the prepar¬ 
ations used in this experiment suggests that the results 
should be checked by further work, using strongly buffered 
solutions# 


Discussion 


Prior to the studies reported here, no information 
was available on the effect of environmental factors on the 
germination of the conidia of C_# purpurea # The present 
studies have shov/n that temperature has a marked influence 
on the percentage germination of ergot conidia even if germ¬ 
ination does occur over a comparatively wide range of temp¬ 
erature conditions# Germination was best at 20° to 2p°C« with 
the upper and lower limits for germination being within the 

ranges of 30° to 35°G. and 5° to 10°C# respectively# Prolonged 

o 

exposure of the conidia at 35 C. and higher result ed in perm¬ 
anent loss of germinability# These relationships indicate 
that the disease is likely to be of most importance in temper¬ 
ate climates. 

The failure of the conidia of the ergot fungus to 
germinate in atmospheres of high relative humidities was rather

surprising in view of the fact that infection sometimes occurs 
in comparatively dry climates. Nevertheless, numerous workers 
have reported that moisture constitutes one of the major environ¬ 
mental influences on the inception of the ergot disease in crops# 
The occurrence of the disease in comparatively dry climates may 
be due to the effect of some other factor such as temperature 
which may influence conditions of humidity as well# 

The nutritive requirements for germination of the 
conidia did not seem to be very great since germination occurred 
in pure, redistilled water# Nevertheless, the observation 
that conidia in diluted honeydew germinated much better than 
those collected from agar cultures and suspended in pure water, 
indicated that the honeydew may provide some stimulatory sub¬ 
stances. Solutions of various sugars, and especially maltose, 
were shown to have similar stimulatory effects# Experiments 
to determine the concentration of sugar solutions that will 
induce germination of conidia indicated that concentrations 
up to 0.1 molar solutions are more favorable than higher con¬ 
centrations and that natural honeydew needs to be diluted at 
least tenfold before any of the conidia can germinate# This 
fact that, as has been demonstrated, honeydew must be highly 
diluted before conidia can germinate suggests an important role 
of liquid moisture in the successful development of the patho¬ 
gen at this stage.

In nature, spores of many fungi have been reported 
to germinate at night only# The present studies showed that, 
under controlled laboratory conditions, ergot conidia germ¬ 
inated equally well in light as in darkness# The ability 
of these conidia to germinate in darkness may probably ex¬ 
plain the occurrence of the ergot disease in comparatively 
warm, dry climates* During the night the conditions of temp¬ 
erature and moisture nearer to the optimum are likely to pre¬ 
vail for a longer time so that conidia may germinate at night 
when daytime conditions are unfavorable* 

Studies on the influence of pH on germination of 
ergot conidia did not yield conclusive results but indications 
were that the conidia will germinate within a range from pH 

ll _*0 to 9 . 0 .

FACTORS INFLUENCING INFECTION 


Introduction 


The production of disease by a pathogen involves 
three important processes in the following sequence: inoc¬ 
ulation, incubation, and infection# The study of spore germ¬ 
ination in vitro yields valuable information but the relation 
of the pathogen to the host itself is the critical relation¬ 
ship© 

C# purpurea has been the SLibject of extensive study 
in the past both because of its destructive properties as a 
pathogen and because of the commercial value of the ergot 
sclerotia® During the first world war the price of ergot in 
the United States reached a high of five dollars a pound* This 
Induced workers such as Bonns (I4.) to attempt the production 
of artificial sclerotia# Although the fungus, as a pathogen

of grasses and cereal crops, has been the cause of heavy losses 
in crops, animal and human life, most of the research on in¬ 
fection with Cj, purpurea has been done with the aim of finding 
methods of producing the valuable ergot sclerotia* Neverthe¬ 
less, much has been learned in these studies that can be used 
by plant pathologists and other workers in the search for 
methods of control* 


Literature 


In 1921 McFarland ( 29 ) inoculated rye and wheat 
with Clayiceps conidia from several native grasses and 
succeeded in producing infection and in inducing the devel¬ 
opment of sclerotia® Later Hecke (18) infected flov/ering rye 
with ascospores from ripe ascigerous fructifications, then, 
by removing the honeydew produced, sLispending it in water and 
spraying it on other rye plants during the flowering stage, he 
was able to develop extensive infections* No details of his 
methods were given but he reported an average of lf.o5 sclerotia 
per ear and suggested that cultivation of ergot appeared well 
worthwhile* Regarding host range of the pathogen. Stager (38) 
explained the rare occurrence of £_• purpurea on wheat as being

the result of the brief and irregular opening of the glumes, 
the susceptible parts of the flower being ordinarily protected 
by the closed glumes 0 

Kirchoff (23), in a very extensive discussion of 
investigations during the period of 1921 - 25 , discussed sev¬ 
eral new biological and physiological aspects of the ergot 
fungus and its pathogenic development# His observations 
showed that the principal seat of infection is the point of 
insertion of the ovary and that spores germinating on the 
stigma produce long germ-tubes which encircle the exterior 
of the ovary and then penetrate the tissue at the most sus¬ 
ceptible point, the base of the ovary# 

Krebs (2l{_) gave an exhaustive account of comparative 
studies on three species of Claviceps and also discussed fac¬ 
tors influencing field cultivation of ergot, further work 
on field cultivation was reported by Bekesy (3) who described 
the use of a machine fitted with hypodermic needles in inoc¬ 
ulating rye for ergot production# 

More recent contributors include Melville (31), 

Andrus (1), Hynes (21), Saha and Battacharjee (35)# Lewis (25) 
and (26), Thomas and Ramakrishnan (39)> Brentzel (5)> Eershen- 
son and Plaut (20), Most of these workers concerned themselves 
with improved methods of producing ergot sclerotia* Further 
reference to some of these contributions will be made in the 
reports which follow.

Materials and Methods for Infection Studies 


Most of the inoculation studies were carried out 
with spring rye but other crops such as wheat, oats, and 
barley were also used in some of the experiments. These 
crops were sown in 8-inch pots in the greenhouse and reached 
a stage suitable for inoculation in approximately three 
months. Pots of spring rye were sown at monthly intervals 
so that a constant supply of plant material for inoculation 
studies was available once the first three months had elapsed. 

A supply of conidia was obtained by grov/ing C. 
purpurea on test-tube slants of hard Leonian*s agar medium. 
Spores were produced abundantly in two to three weeks and were 
harvested as needed. 

Inoculum consisted of a spore suspension prepared 
in a manner similar to that used in the spore germination 
studies but the surface of the agar slant culture was scraped 
with a flexible wire loop in order to release as many of the 
spores as possible into the suspension. Such a procedure 
could not be used in the spore germination studies because 
the bits of mycelium and medium released interfered with the 
controlled conditions in the hanging-drop preparations.

Inoculation was performed by two methods: 

1* The spore suspension was sprayed onto the florets by means 
of a DeVilbiss atomizer* 

2* The spore suspension was injected into the florets by 
means of a hypodermic needle* The hypodermic needle 
method proved to be more efficient for producing infection 
but it is a very tedious and time-consuming one. It was 
therefore used mainly as a supplemental method to determine 
whether or not the inoculum was capable of producing the 
disease* 

Temperature and humidity experiments were conducted 
in closed glass chambers, the pots of rye or other plants 
being held at the experimental conditions throughout the 
incubation period of the pathogen, that is, from the time of 
inoculation till the first signs of honeydew formation were 
evident. Most of the other experiments were also conducted 
in the closed chambers so that a high relative humidity could 
be maintained for at least part of the incubation period.

Ergot Infection and Stage of Floral Development 


Brentzel (5) reported that a suspension of conidia 
sprayed onto rye heads in bloom produced droplets of honeydew 
in 7 to 10 days* No details of the exact stage of development 
or other conditions were given. 

In 1902 Engelke, as reported by Atanasoff (2), found 
that infection with conidia was successful only before the 
flower was pollinated. At this stage the conidium can germinate 
in the nectar of the flower and produce a germ tube which can 
then extend into the cavity of the ovary. Stager, in 1903* 
obtained infection by artificial inoculation with honeydew 
when the plants were in full bloom. He also showed that 
plants inoculated 3 to [j_ days before flowering became infected 
readily© In 1906 , Tschermak observed that in rye, infection 
takes place in pollinated as well as in unpollinated flowers. 

The failure of flowers to become pollinated offers a greater 
chance for ergot infection both in rye and barley, as the 
glumes remain open for a longer time. Kirchoff (23) reported 
infection occurring from inoculations of rye at 5 to 6 days 
before flowering, at flov/ering, and up to 1$ days after flov/er¬ 
ing. The abstract referred to did not describe his methods

Experimental 

The rye or other grains sown in pots in the green¬ 
house did not all head and bloom at the same time. When 
most of the florets were in full bloom there were also some 
that ranged from pre-bloom to post-bloom stages. 

The first experiment was begun On August 17, 19lj-8, 
with rye which had been sown in the greenhouse early in May. 
Five plants representative of each of the following stages of 
development were selected and labelled: 

(a) Pre-bloom - 3 to 5 days before any signs of flowering. 

(b) Early bloom - only the first few anthers showing* 

(c) Full bloom « florets wide open. 

(d) Post-bloom - one week to 10 days after full bloom. 

The florets were often still wide open but 
the stamens were dried out and the ovaries 
considerably enlarged. 

All the plants were sprayed at the same time with 
conidia suspended in a 1 % maltose solution. Beginning in the 
afternoon of August 17* three sprayings were applied on suc¬ 
cessive days. The experiment was conducted under ordinary 
greenhouse conditions but with an attempt to maintain a 
high humidity by flooding the soil under the benches.

Honeydew formation was first observed on August 
31 , ill- days after the first spraying, and notes of sclerot- 
ial formation were taken on September 1 £. 

Each labelled head was carefully examined and the 
number of sclerotia produced was recorded. The results are 
summarized in Table f?A# The experiment was repeated a month 
later. These results are shown in Table j?B.

Although infection was obviously not heavy in 
either of the experiments, the close agreement of results 
from both experiments indicates that stage of blooming at the 
time of inoculation did have some effect on whether or not 
infection took place. 

No infection was observed in any of the plants 
which were inoculated after the flowering period was over 
and the ovaries had already become enlarged. Only a small 
amount of infection occurred when plants were inoculated be¬ 
fore any external signs of flowering were evident. This might 
be accounted for by the closed condition of the glumes which 
prevented inoculum from coming in contact with the internal 
parts of the florets. It is possible that even with apparently 
closed glumes some of the tiny spores in a fine spray may 
have found their way into the floret and caused the small 
amount of infection which was reported. The most abundant 
infection occurred in the early and full bloom stages of 
development. If opening of glumes is the criterion for sus¬ 
ceptibility to infection then certainly ideal conditions for 
infection were provided by the blooming rye plants in this 
experiment. 

The result s of these experiments indicate that, up 
until fertilization takes place, the susceptibility to in¬ 
fection by spray inoculation with ergot conidia is governed

by the condition of the glumes with respect to the extent 
to which they prevent entrance of inoculum to the internal 
floral parts* Once fertilization has taken place the in¬ 
ception of fertilization of the ovaries is apparently res¬ 
ponsible for the lack of infection* The problem of finding 
out the true nature of this loss of susceptibility would be 
an interesting one for future study. 


Varietal Resistance to Infection by the Ergot Fungus 


Observations made on some of the University plots 
in the fall of 19 ^-S showed a very heavy infection of ergot 
in the barley hybrids* especially on tillers which remained 
green late into the fall* Close examination revealed that, 
unlike the normally developing barley, the plants bearing 
heavily ergotized florets were characterized by glumes which 
remained permanently open* Their behaviour was similar to 
that of rye which exhibits the open glume condition because 
it depends on cross-pollination for fertilization* This 
observation suggested that varietal resistance to infection 
by the ergot fungus may be associated with the morphology, or

behavior of the glumes during flowering# In a discussion 
on varietal susceptibility in wheat*Weniger (iplp) stated that 
the Amber durum wheats are the most susceptible, the Red durum 
wheats are less susceptible, and the hard red spring wheats 
are seldom attacked# This she attributed to the relative 
difference in opening of glumes in these different kinds of 
wheat# 


Experimental 

Hybrid barley from the above mentioned stocks, 
Montcalm barley, and Newal barley, were grown in the green¬ 
house for inoculation studies* As far as is known, Newal 
is rarely affected by ergot but Montcalm has been reported 
to have been heavily infected on several occasions# Careful 
notes were taken on glume behaviour in the three lots of 
barley# 

The glumes of some of the hybrid barley plants opened 
as the head emerged from the sheath and remained open for the 
entire period under observation, even after infection had 
taken place#

The Montcalm barley emerged from the sheath with 
closed glumes but the tips of the glumes began to separate 
once the head was fully emerged and opened sufficiently to 
expose the organs in the upper part of the florets# This 
condition persisted for several days during the early to full 
flowering period but the glumes seemed to close again before 
development of the seed was evident# 

No marked opening of the glumes was observed in the 
Newal barley* Florets had to be opened with forceps to 
determine the development of the stamens* Some heads only 
partly out of the sheath were in full bloom or even develop¬ 
ing seed* T 0 obtain heads in the pre-bloom stage they had 
to be withdrawn from unopened sheaths* 

Inoculation was performed by the spray and hypoder¬ 
mic methods using a 1 % maltose solution spore suspension® The 
plants were inoculated in the full bloom stage* At this time 
the hybrid florets were wide open, Montcalm florets were open 
just at the tip, and the Newal florets were closed* Four 
pots of each variety v/ere used for inoculation* Two heads 
in each pot were labelled and inoculated with the hypodermic® 
All the heads were then sprayed with the spore suspension and 
placed in the humidity chamber at 20 °C* Inoculation was re¬ 
peated in the same manner on three successive days® On the 
tenth day after the first inoculation the pots were removed

pots there were only 9 typical lax-type heads, and the 
remainder exhibited normal, tightly closed glumes at all 
times* ^he total population of Montcalm and Newal was at 
least 4.0 heads each* If the infections were compared on the 
percentage basis, the hybrids and Montcalm barleys would 
be rated as approximately \\$% and Q% heads infected res¬ 
pectively* 

The results of this experiment indicate that 
the nature of susceptibility to infection by the ergot fungus 
in the three types of barley studied is definitely associated 
with the opening of glumes during the flowering period* When 
the inoculum was introduced into the florets, in contact with 
the vulnerable parts, all three types of barley became infected. 
On the other hand, the spray method of inoculation which could 
not deposit the inoculum inside the floret when the glumes 
were tightly closed, as in the Newal barley, failed to produce 
infection* Montcalm, being intermediate in glume opening, 
was only slightly infected by this process.

Relative Susceptibility of Cereal Crops 


One need not go far into the literature to realize 
that of all the common cereal crops, rye is the most susceptible 
host of the ergot fungus. Examination by Dillon Weston, and 
Taylor (11), of the records of ergot in cereals in England 
during the 2li years preceding 194 - 2 * indicated that the fungus 
occurred more commonly on rye than on any other crop; that it 
occurred rather frequently on wheat, less so on barley, and 
was very rarely found on oats. Moore (32), in a report on 
cereal diseases in England and Wales also stated that ergot 
occurs on rye, wheat, barley, and oats, in descending order 
of prevalence* 

Due (13) reported a severe attack of ergot in a 
field of wheat in the province of Ain in Prance. DeMonicault 
(10) referred to this same outbreak and suggested that the 
abrupt alternations of early heat, rain, and cold, induced an 
unusually open condition of the glumes so that the enclosed 
florets were more accessible to the attacks of the fungus. 

Stager (38) successfully inoculated v/heat with a rye strain 
of Qjl purpur ea by means of a hypodermic syringe, and explained 
the rare occurrence of ergot in Tufa.eat as the result of the

brief and irregular opening of the glumes at maturity, the 
susceptible parts of the flower being ordinarily protected 
by the glumes* In contrast to this behaviour in wheat, it is 
known that the flowers of rye, because of their cross-pollin¬ 
ation habit, remain open and liable to infection for the en¬ 
tire flowering period# 

Ergot on barley has been reported quite frequently# 
White (lj_2) reported that in Tasmania, for the period 19i|3-ll-5* 
Goldthorpe barley showed $°/o infection with ergot# Neill ( 33 ) 
reported the common occurrence of ergot on six-rowed barley 
and its occasional occurrence on wheat and oats in New 
Zealand. Witte (i_j_3) in a report of the State Seed Testing 
Station in Stockholm, stated that ergot was detected in 53 
and 2l\f 0 respectively of rye and six-rowed barley samples 
submitted for inspection# 

In contrast to the above observations, Ducellier 
(l)^) stated that C#. purpurea is found in Algeria on many wild 
grasses but amongst cultivated cereals it has so far been 
observed only on oats# Kye appears to be free from the 
disease though the seed had been imported from localities in 
Europe and America where ergot of rye is common* No ergot 
has been found on wheat although infected oat plants were 
present within fields of wheat examined#

'■The first suggestion of biologic specificity in 
the ergot fungus was proposed by Stager in 1910 and still 
remains the main source of information regarding the host 
specialization of this pathogen. As reported by Weniger ( )|)| ), 
Stager proposed the division of the species purpurea into 
three distinct biologic races: 

1. The rye form, which infects most of the common cereal 
crops including oats. 

2. A form which occurs on Brachypodium sylvaticum and has a 
very limited host range. 

3. A form found on Lolium perenne and which also has a limited 
host range. 

Stager* s work has been severely criticised. by some 
recent workers as being inadequate to justify the division 
of this species into the three forms proposed. The above 
mentioned report of Ducellier suggests that either Stager*s 
lists of hosts attacked by the different forms are in error, 
or that he has failed to report a form vh ich attacks oats but 
does not attack wheat or rye 0 

The present study does not contribute much to the 
knowledge of physiologic specialization in the ergot fungus 
but infection experiments were carried out to learn something 
of the comparative effect of the pathogen on the commonly 
grown cereal crops.

Experimental 

Red Bobs wheat. Victory oats, Montcalm barley, and 
spring rye were used in this study. As the plants came into 
the flowering stage they were inoculated with a 1% maltose 
spore suspension of C_. purpurea and incubated in humidity 
chambers. 

Inoculations were performed by both the spray and 
hypodermic syringe method. Pour pots of each crop were sel¬ 
ected for inoculation. Two heads in each pot were inoculated 
with the hypodermic and labelled. All the plants were then 
sprayed with the spore suspension and left in the humidity 
chambers for two weeks, ^hey were then removed from the hum¬ 
idity chambers and left in the greenhouse for further devel¬ 
opment. 

Notes were taken on the condition of the glumes 
and stage of floral development at the time of inoculation 
for each of the crops under test. An attempt was made to 
inoculate each of the crops at approximately the same stage 
of floral development, ^his was achieved by inspecting the 
florets at frequent intervals until most of them showed some

with a pair of forceps to facilitate such observations. At 
the time of inoculation the oats and wheat florets were

completely closed; the barley florets were partly open at 
the tips; and most of those in rye were open wide enough to 
expose to view most of the floral parts* 

When the plants were removed from the humidity 
chambers only the rye showed honeydew formation* Some of 
the barley florets which had been inoculated with the hypo¬ 
dermic, showed honey dev/ two days later* No honey dev/ was ob¬ 
served in wheat or oats. Pinal inspections and notes on 
sclerotial formation were taken on January 21}., two weeks 
after removal of the plants from the humidity chambers* The 
number of heads bearing slcerotia were recorded for each 
crop* The results are summarized in Table 7*

The results shown in the table leave no doubt 
as to which crop was most easily infected by the fungus# 

Rye was by far the most susceptible# Barley, wheat and 
oats followed far behind in order of descending susceptibility# 
The suspected infection in the oats was by no means definite# 
'^he sclerotia-like bodies within the florets were very small, 
and only an abundant layer of conidia on this small, darkened 
body led to the belief that the fungus must have become 
established# 

The lack of infection in wheat and oats which had 
been sprayed with the conidial suspension, and the presence 
of slight infection occurring in florets which had been in¬ 
oculated with the hypodermic syringe, indicates that the re¬ 
sistant properties of these crops are associated with the 
exclusion of inoculum from susceptible parts rather than with 
genetic characters of resistance within the ovary# On the 
other hand, the lack of conclusive evidence for infection 
in oats suggests something in the nature of defensive re¬ 
action by the host or biologic specialization of the 
pathogen.

Moisture and Temperature Effects 


Although moisture and temperatures are distinctly 
different factors of the environment their effect on the 
development of certain diseases, such as ergot of cereal crops 
is related to such an extent that the one is seldom discussed 
without consideration of the other* For this reason they 
have been studied together here as the major environmental 
factors influencing inception of disease* 

The literature on the influence of these factors 
on infection by the ergot fungus is mostly of a general 
nature, most of the observations being made in the field 
with no attempts being made to control conditions* Vladim¬ 
irsky (i{-0), in a report on the geographical distribution and 
zones of injurious influence of ergot on rye in the U.S.S.R., 
stated that the greatest development of ergot infection was 
observed in regions where the following conditions prevailed: 

1* A relative humidity during flowering of not less than 70%• 
2* 'A temperature at the beginning of flowering not above l£°C 
3* A flowering period of 13 days*

He was able to divide regions into three groups according to 
meteorological conditions considered to be optimal, intermed¬ 
iate, and adverse for the development of ergot and found these 
to roughly coincide with the regions of maximum, medium, and 
minimum importance of the disease* Hynes (21), working on 
methods of producing ergot in New South Wales, confirmed the 
above mentioned observations by concluding that only in cooler, 
moister climates can field cultivation of ergot be considered* 
In 194.7, Hershenson and Plaut (20) reported on some experiments 
carried out in Palestine and they made several observations re¬ 
garding the inoculation of rye with C_* purpurea as related to 
environmental conditions* ^hey concluded that in Palestine the 
days are usually too dry for infection to take place so that 
it occurs mainly at night when the humidity rises to about 30% 

from the daytime level of around 3 0%* They also atated that a 

,0 

temperature of at least 15 C# is required so that in cooler 
climates the temperatures may be too low at night but that 
the humidity is usually high enough during the day* 

The studies reported here are of a more specific 
nature, the work having been done in the greenhouse under con¬ 
trolled conditions of temperature and humidity.

Materials and Methods 

Spring rye grown in 8-inch pots was used throughout* 
Inoculum consisted of 1$ maltose suspension of conidia harv¬ 
ested from test-tube cultures of C_* purpurea * 

Three glassed-in chambers, l\. feet by ij. feet, and 
feet high, were available for this work in the greenhouse* 

These were provided with thermostatically controlled heating 
units and one of them was also equipped with cooling facilit¬ 
ies* Depending on the temperature of the greenhouse, a fairly 
accurate control of temperature could be maintained in these 
chambers over the range from about to 35°C* or more* 

During hot summer days, when the temperature in the greenhouse 
rose to 25 °C. or higher, it was impossible to maintain inter¬ 
mediate temperature levels because only one of the chambers 
had cooling facilities* Most of the work was therefore done 
during the cooler seasons of the year. 

Experiments were conducted at three controlled 
levels, namely: approximately £0$, 80 - 90 %, and 100$. The 
relative humidity of the atmosphere in the greenhouse was 
usually around £0$ as measured by a sling psychrometer• It 
was estimated that the relative humidity of the controlled 
temperature chambers provided with a large pan of water was 
approximately 80 - 90$. One hundred per cent relative humidity

was obtained by means of a Westinghouse Vital-Air humidifyer 
which produced a blast of mist or fog when in operation. This 
apparatus, operated for about -g- hour every 10 or 12 hours, 
maintained a constant film of condensed moisture on all the 
inside surfaces of the chamber so that it was apparent that 
the atmosphere within the chamber was saturated. 

The usual spray method of inoculation was employed 
using the conventional type of atomizer manufactured by the 
DeVilbiss Co* 


Experimental 

Since an experimental setup to study the complete 
temperature-moisture relationship with respect to infection 
would need to be very extensive, and facilities were limited 
to three controllable conditions at one time, the study was 
divided into experiments on temperature separate from those 
on humidity* Experimental results will therefore be reported 
on separately also. 


Tempe nature 

In the first experiment infection was studied at 
10°, 20°, and 30°C*, and in a second at l£°, 25°, and 35°C.

susceptible stage at the time of inoculation, the same would 

be true for all the other treatments in the experiment# 

The records show that the best infection occurred 

at 15 °, 20°, and 25 °C#, but that a single optimum temperature 

cannot be determined from the results of these experiments# 

Little infection occurred at 10° and 30°C#, and none at 35>°C# 

The infection result s do not agree very closely 

with those on spore germination# While germination of conidia 
o 

was low at 15 C# when compared to that at higher temperatures, 

o o 

infection at 15 C# was as good or better than that at 20 and 

o 

25 C. It is possible that, with abundant inoculum, high 
germination percentage is not necessary for abundant infection. 
On the other hand, notes on spore germination were taken at 
the end of L(_8 hours but when cultures were left for 9& hours, 
germination percentage at l5°C# increased considerably# Such 
may have been the case in the infection experiments# The 
conidia were given sufficient time in a favorable habitat to 
permit good germination in spite of the comparatively low 
temperature# 


Moisture (Humidity) 

For the controlled humidity experiments approximate 
humidities of 50 $, 80 - 90 $, and 100$ were maintained in the

There seems to be no difference between the number 
of heads infected at 80 - 90 % relative humidity and that at 
100 $, but the infection at these two levels of humidity does 
appear to be significantly higher than that at £0$. One dif¬ 
ference that did seem to exist between infections at the two 
higher levels of humidity was the number of florets infected 
per head* At the 80 - 90$ relative humidity a total of 25 
sclerotia were formed in 13 heads infected while 29 sclerotia 
were formed in 11 heads infected at the 100$ level. This is 
an average of 1*92 sclerotia per head in the former as com¬ 
pared with 2*6[j_ in the latter* 

The higher infection ratio for the 100$ relative 
humidity might be associated with the frequent condensation 
of moisture on the surface of the florets* These droplets 
of condensed moisture may have aided in the deposition of in¬ 
itial inoculum at the base of the ovary thus increasing the 
chances of infection once the spores did germinate, or this 
condensed moisture may have merely provided a better medium 
for the germination of the spores* Another possibility is 
that, once infection has set in, conidia produced by this in¬ 
itial infection may be transported, by these droplets of vrater, 
to florets below the infected ones and thus aid in infecting 
a greater number of florets per head*

Discussion 


As in the case of spore germination, no previous 
reports on controlled studies of infection by the conidia of 
C» purpurea were found in the literature* Numerous references 
have been made to field observations but no attempts to study 
infection under controlled conditions have been reported* 

Experiments which were made to determine the relation¬ 
ship of the stage of floral development and ergot infection 
showed that the rye floret remains susceptible to infection 
for a relatively long period of time but not nearly as long 
as was reported by Kirchoff (23)* He stated that infection 
occurred from inoculations of rye at 5 to 6 days before flower¬ 
ing, at flowering, and up to 15 days after flowering* Depend¬ 
ing upon when he considered the flowering period to be termin¬ 
ated, the period of susceptibility suggested by him extends 
at least one week beyond that indicated by the results of 
the present study* Otherwise, the present study agrees with 
his observations* The fact that the present results were not 
obtained under natural conditions may account for the differ¬ 


ence*

The relative susceptibility of different cereal 
crops to infection by the ergot fungus was found to be as 
follows: rye, barley, wheat, and oats, in order of descend¬ 
ing susceptibility* It was found that all the crops tested, 
except probably oats, can be readily infected by the rye 
strain of the ergot fungus but that the difference in sus¬ 
ceptibility was associated with the difference in opening 
of glumes* Varietal resistance was accounted for on the same 
basis* J *he open glume types of barley found in hybrid stocks 
were readily infected by spraying with conidial suspension 
during flowering* Montcalm was only slightly infected, and. 
no infection occurred in Hewal which exhibited tightly closed 
glumes at the time of inoculation* 

Results on temperature and humidity effects on in¬ 
fection agree quite well with the field observations made by 
Hershenson and Plaut (20). T^ey claimed that the optimum 
temperature range for infection of rye in Palestine was 20° 
to 30°C. and that infection was best when the relative humidity 

was more than 70^* Present studies showed that the optimum 

o ,o 

temperature range was 15 to 25 C. and that infection at re¬ 
lative humidities above Q0% was much higher than that at

GENERAL DISCUSSION 


The present study has contributed to the understand¬ 
ing of several aspects of the development of the ergot fungus. 
First of all, it has provided further evidence of the import¬ 
ance of environment as a controlling factor in the establish¬ 
ment and development of the disease, '^'he observations with 
regards to the influence of moisture and temperature serve as 
good examples of this type of evidence. As has been mentioned 
before, these two factors are very closely associated in their 
function in nature and are often the most important factors 
that determine the activity of a pathogen. Judging from the 
results of the experiments here, one vo uld certainly expect 
the ergot fungus to function most efficiently in moist, 
temperate climates, r ftie conidial stage, which is considered 
to be most important in the production of epiphytotics, is 
subject to considerable limitation by the influence of these 

two factors, Conidia will not germinate at temperatures much 
o o 

below 10 C, nor much above 30 C, and are permanently inact¬ 
ivated at 35°C, Moisture requirements likewise are quite 
definite. It was fou.nd that conidia require a liquid medium- 
in which to germinate and will not germinate on dry surfaces

even in an atmosphere of 100$ relative humidity. Inoculation 
experiments showed that very little infection occurs in an 
atmosphere of $0 $ relative humidity even if all other factors 
are favorable. Bearing in mind the moisture requirement for 
germination of conidia it is understandable why the latter 
relationship exists# Only with a high relative humidity is 
there any possibility for condensation of moisture to occur 
and provide the liquid medium necessary for the conidia to 
germinate. Moisture in the form of rain may often be harmful 
to the pathogen because it would tend to wash the spore-laden 
honeydew away from the susceptible parts of the plant. 

An important observation in the present study was 
that dilution of honeydew is necessary before any conidia 
suspended in it can germinate# Honeydev/ may be transported 
by insects and other vectors to susceptible parts of numerous 
plants but unless sufficient moisture is available to dilute 
this suspension of spores, infection cannot occur. Further¬ 
more, the timing of these conditions is also important. The 
period in which plants are susceptible to ergot infection is 
rather limited as compared to that for several other cereal 
diseases. If environmental conditions are not favorable dur¬ 
ing the 2-3 week flowering period, there is little likelihood 
of much infection occurring.

The stimulatory action of sugars on germination is 
interesting from the standpoint of similar functions of the 
honeydew in nature. In addition to preventing germination 
of conidia until such a time as conditions are favorable for 
the development of the fungus the honeydew likely stimulates 
rapid germination so as to take advantage of favorable con¬ 
ditions as soon as they are provided* Furthermore, the ob¬ 
servation that some sugars are better than others in stim¬ 
ulating germination provides information for more detailed 
studies of nutritive relationships in the germination of such 
conidia. 

With respect to the application of the information 
obtained, for the purpose of developing effective methods of 
testing ergot resistance in crops, there are several factors 
which deserve consideration at this stage: 

1 * That, as far as could be determined from the literature 
and from the experimental work in the present study, the 
opening of glumes during flowering is the factor which is 
most likely to determine the extent to which a crop may 
become infected by the ergot fungus* Apart from the fact 
that physiologic specialization of the pathogen has pre¬ 
sumably been demonstrated, no deep-seated character of 
resistance has yet been demonstrated in the host*

2* If an effort to investigate the possibility of resistance 
due to deep-seated, genetic factors is to be made, it is 
necessary to develop a method of inoculation which will not 
be interfered with by the difference in opening of the 
glumes* One of the methods employed in the present study, 
that of injecting inoculum by means of a hypodermic syringe, 
largely overcame this glume factor but this method involves 
a very tedious and laborous procedure and would not likely 
be feasible on a large scale* It has been suggested that 
an apparatus used in testing selections of wheat and barley 
for reaction to loose smuts might be adapted for this pur¬ 
pose* ‘^his apparatus is described by Moore (32) and em¬ 
ploys the vacuum principle of introducing the inoculum 
into the florets* ^he present writer has not had an 
opportunity to use such an apparatus but the principle 
appears promising and it is hoped that a suitable adapt¬ 
ation of it may be developed before long* 

3 * r £hat discovery of genetic resistance to ergot would be an 
Important step In obtaining control of the disease even 
if some crops and varieties are presumably resistant 
because of the typically closed nature of their glumes 
during flowering* Opening and closing of glumes is greatly 
influenced by environmental conditions and, as illustrated

by DeMonicault (10), may be responsible for epiphytotics 
in crops which are ordinarily very seldom affected by the 
disease# ^he occurrence of ergot on wheat, usually re¬ 
garded as quite exceptional, was very frequent in Prance 
in 1922. DeMonicault considered this to have been caused 
by the abrupt alternations of early heat, rain, and cold 
which induced an unusually open condition of the glumes, 
so that the enclosed florets were more susceptible to 
attacks of the fungus# Such irregular outbreaks might be 
avoided by the development of genetically resistant 


varieties

SUMMARY 


1. The influence of external environmental factors on 

the ergot fungus, Claviceps purpurea , and on infection of 
plants by it was studied in this investigation with the 
main purpose in mind of improving techniques of testing the 
varietal resistance of cereal crops. 

2o The studies were confined to the conidial stage of 

C♦ purpurea ; to factors influencing germination of the con- 
idia and to infection of cereals by this stage. 

3. The minimum, optimum, and maximum temperatures for 

germination of the conidia were determined. These were: 

^o o o o o o 

5 to 10 C., 20 to 25 C., and 30 to 35 C. respectively. 

It was further found that conidia survived storage in ice 

o 

at approximately 0 C# but were killed by prolonged exposure 

,o 

to a temperature of 35 

Ip. Water in liquid form is required for germination. 

Conidia on dry glass cover slips exposed to humid atmosphere 
for 72 hours were rendered ungerminable* 

5* Sugars, and particularly maltose, were found to stirnul 

ate germination considerably.

6* Only the lower concentrations of maltose were stim¬ 

ulatory. Inhibitory effects were evident at concentrations 
greater than 0*1 molar and no germination occurred at con¬ 
centrations above 0.5 molar« 

It was observed that considerable dilution of the honey- 
dew, the sugary medium in which the conidia are produced in 
nature^is necessary before germination of these spores will 
take place. 

7o It was shown that germination occurred equally well in 

continuous light, in continuous dark, and in alternating light 
and dark. 

8. Germination was fair in redistilled Y/ater at pH levels 
from ip.O to 9*0 but no germination occurred at pH 3*0 and 
considerable inhibition was evident at pH 10.0 

9. Rye florets were readily infected shortly before flower¬ 
ing and at stages up to late flowering, a period of about 3 
weeks under greenhouse conditions. 

10. Inoculation studies showed that the commonly grown 
cereal crops became infected as follows: rye, barley, wheat, 
and oats, in decreasing order of susceptibility* 

11. ^'he susceptibility of different varieties of barley was 
shown to be associated with the opening of glumes during 
flowering. Hybrid barley, exhibiting widely opened glumes, 
became readily infected; Montcalm, with intermediate glume 
opening, was only slightly infected; and Hev/al, with closed 
glumes, did not develop the disease.

12. The most favorable temperatures for infection follow- 

o 

ing inoculation with conidia were found to be between 15 

o o o 

and 25 C* Little infection occurred at 10 and 30 C*, and 

none at 35°0* 

13* Relative humidities of 80$ and higher favored infection. 

No differences in degree of infection were observed under 
conditions of 80$ and 100$ relative humidity but infection was 
considerably reduced at the 50 $ level* 

ll|o A vacuum method of inoculation is suggested for 

testing ergot resistance in further studies*
