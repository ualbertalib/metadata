SYNOPSIS 


The present research is a pilot study in the field of 
psychopathy which is attempting to answer two problems: 

1. What criteria may be used to determine a psychopathic group? 
2* Is the MMPI a valid test in determining the presence of a 
psychopathic group? 

A list of psychopathic characteristics was compiled 
from the literature* This list was assumed to be repre¬ 
sentative of psychiatric opinion on the subject* Ten 
Saskatchewan psychiatrists rated these items as being either 
"very significant,” Significant,” or of ”little significance” 
in diagnosing a psychopath* The lists from three of the 
psychiatrists who showed the greatest number of items scored 
unanimously were selected* From the items which they scored 
identically, a final check list of twelve psychopathic 
characteristics was compiled and an arbitrary rating given 
to each item* Ratings were 2 for items rated ”very significant, 
and 1 for items rated ”significant.” No score was assigned 
to items rated as being of "little significance” as they were 
not included in the final list. A total of US male pris¬ 
oners were rated on this list* 

By establishing an arbitrary cutting score, three groups 
were obtained from the entire prison group* These were esta¬ 
blished on the basis of their total score out of a possible 
score of 22* The group representing the top one-third of the 
scores was considered as portraying "psychopathic” character¬ 
istics* The group representing the lowest one-third of the

scores was considered as portraying "non-psychopathic" charac¬ 
teristics* The central scoring group was considered as a 
’’general" prison group* 

The MMPI was administered to these subjects and a 
composite profile was drawn up for the members represented in 
each of the three groups and for the entire prison group* 

The entire group was compared with another prison group 
and results indicated that they present very similar MMPI 
profiles* From these results it was concluded that the 
entire Regina group was representative of a prison group* 

The MMPI appears to distinguish the ’’psychopathic" group 
from the "non-psychopathic" group in this study by means of 
the Hs, Pd plus *4K, Pt plus IK, and Ma plus *2K scales with 
a significance better than the 1% level of confidence* The 
"psychopathic" group is differentiated from the "general" group 
by the Pd plus *4K and the Ma plus *2K scales with a signifi¬ 
cance better than the 1% level of confidence. Only one scale, 
i*e. the Ma plus *2K, distinguishes the "non-psychopathic" 
group from the "general" prison group with a significance better 
than 1%. Without the K factor, these two last mentioned groups 
are differentiated on the Hs, Pd and Ma scales with a signifi¬ 
cance better than the 0*5^ level of confidence* 

In summary, it appears that the check list is a fairly good 
method of establishing a psychopathic group. Assuming that it 
was a valid establishment of both the "psychopathic" and "non- 
psychopathic" groups, the MMPI appears to be valid in detecting 
them from a general prison group.

ACKNOICEDGMENTS 

I should like to take this opportunity to thank the 
many individuals and government departments who aided me in 
this study. Dr. D. Smith of the Department of Philosophy and 
Ps^rchology of the University of Alberta, who directed this 
research and whose stimulating lectures on penal programs 
whetted my interest in penology and eventually psychopathy, 
is to have much of the credit for this study. Dr. D. Spearman 
of the same department offered knowledge on ps 3 ^chopathy, direc¬ 
tion of studies, and to him the credit must be given for the 
idea of approaching the diagnosing of the psychopath by 
means of a check list. Dr. L* Walker gave much assistance 
through an unpublished manuscript and also through interest 
and suggestions on psychopathy. 

Financial aid in this work was given generously in the 
form of a grant from the University of Alberta*s General 
Research Fund, to Dr. D. Smith. Through this aid, it was 
possible to obtain travelling expenses for the trip to Regina 
and the purchasing of the necessary test materials. 

Appreciation is also due to the Department of Social 
Welfare and Rehabilitation, Province of Saskatchewan, and 
particularly to Mr. J. S. White, Deputy Minister, by whose 
consent this study was made possible. 

The entire Corrections Branch of the Department of Social 


Welfare and Rehabilitation, Regina, Saskatchewan, were

very co-operative and sympathetic to this study. Mr. John 
Fomataro, Director of the Corrections Branch, and Dr. Gordon 
Russon, Psychiatrist for the Corrections Branch, -were both 
keenly interested and provided much encouragement as well as 
practical aid and information. Mr. M. Rubin, Superintendent 
of the Provincial Gaol for Men, Regina, and his entire staff 
gave full co-operation to this study which, without their aid 
would have been impossible. 

Thanks is also due to Dr. McKerracher and the following 
nine Saskatchewan psychiatrists who so generously gave of their 
time and effort to rate the items in the original check list 
and who offered many helpful comments regarding psychopathy: 

Dr. I. Clancy, Dr. M. Demay, Dr. S. K. Ehrlich, Dr. K. Kotlowski, 
Dr. J. Lucy, Dr. J. J. McLurg, Dr. H. Osmond, Dr. G. Russon 
and Dr. A. Stephen. 

Finally, the 118 men whose names must be withheld, but 
without whose co-operation this study would not have been 
possible, deserve many thanks for their effort put into 
the many tests.

CHAPTER 1 


INTRODUCTION 

This research arose primarily out of an interest and 
subsequent study in the field of psychopathy* Early in 
the course of this study it became apparent that, 
although the field was wide, it was ill-charted with 
poorly defined boundaries. The literature included 
many articles both theoretical and experimental, yet 
failed to answer the problem of how the psychopath could 
be diagnosed. 

The problem of diagnosing this "enigmatic” (5&) 
personality is frequently encountered in mental hos¬ 
pitals, prisons and penitentiaries. Every "authority” 
on the psychopath appears to have his or her own 
criteria for diagnosis. Criteria appear to be based to 
a large extent on the area in which the "authority” is 
primarily interested. For examples of this "bias" 
shown in diagnostic criteria one merely has to note 
that to some the psychopath shows a "poor conscience 
or defective character of conscience" ( 22 ), others claim 
he is "an instinct-ridden character” (X?), Lindner (39) 
believes the psychopath is a "rebel without cause," and 
others state that he is either not human^ or is a

did not quote the source of this statement other than

"fictitious entity” (IS). To many psychiatrists, 
clinical psychologists, penal and reform workers, legal 
men, and the man-on-the street, the term "psychopath” 
carries some particular meaning. Yet there appears to 
be little convergence of thought in respect to basic 
characteristics which delineate the psychopath from the 
”near-normal,” neurotic or psychotic person. However, 
it is imperative that the psychopath be segregated from 
the neurotic, psychotic and “near-normal” individual 
in many instances. 

The prison and penitentiary are excellent examples 
of institutes wherein it is advisable to segregate the 
psychopath from his fellow prisoners. This point cannot 
be over-emphasized in a penal institute which is attempt¬ 
ing to carry on a program of rehabilitation of the pris¬ 
oner. Although some clinicians maintain that there are 
psychopaths in existence who appear to obtain sudden 
insight while walking down the corridors of a prison (12), 
these cases seem to be the exception rather than the 
rule. It is generally thought by men like Karpman that 
the psychopath is seldom worth the time and effort 
required in working with him ^ . Bromberg mentions that 

”One wonders in relation to the complex problem, 

whether psychiatry has not been frightened by 


1 Dr. Russon has mentioned the possibilities that those 
who are most pessimistic about the treatability of the 
psychopath may be reflecting the limitations of their 
own therapeutic technique. 





3 


the sardonic, snarling mask of the psychopath 
behind -which lies the frightened, lonesome 
face of the neurotic character.” (4) 

Neustater states that the psychopath -within a 
prison ”can be a great trial,” as he has in many cases 
received every and all types of punishment and conse¬ 
quently has nothing more to fear (4$)* It requires 
little imagination to consider the effect of this type 
of person on a rehabilitation program being carried on 
within a penal institute. Time spent on him could 
probably be much more profitable if spent on a non¬ 
psychopat hie prisoner. Also, before he makes his 
psychopathic personality too evident to the treatment 
staff, he will have disrupted the program for others. 
Segregation of the psychopath from the non-psychopath 
appears imperative before adequate treatment programs can 
be executed. 

The necessary segregation of two such groups is 
difficult even in such places as mental hospitals where 
psychiatrists are available for diagnosing the patients. 
Within many penal institutes the problem is aggravated 
by lack of a psychiatrist to examine all the inmates as 
they are admitted. It follows then, that some method 
must be used where a psychiatric diagnosis is not 
required to differentiate the psychopath from the non¬ 
psychopath. Once such groups had been determined, one 
could use them to validate tests which were supposedly

constructed to indicate the presence of a psychopathic 
personality. A test such as the Minnesota Multiphasic 
Personality Inventory^* (27, 23, 29, 30, 43, 44, 45, 

46, 47A) which is easy to administer and score and which 
has a definite scale which supposedly will indicate a 
psychopathic personality, could be chosen to test its 
validity with such groups. Such a test might also be 
useful in perhaps indicating other characteristics of 
a psychopathic group; e.g. as shown by various MMPI 
scales, and the general MMPI profile (24, 45, 47, 55)® 

In view of these merits and because it was thought 

2 

that the Psychopathic deviate scale was established 
on a group with questionable psychopathic diagnostic 
methods, the MMPI was chosen as the test to be validated 
in this study. 

The test itself appeared to require validation studies, 
both because of the manner in which it was established 
and standardized, and because of the studies being 
undertaken which assume it to be a valid test (e.g. 38). 

There appears to be a great need not only to validate the 
MMPI but also to establish some better basis for selecting 
a psychopathic group on which to validate the test. 

The preseht study is an attempt to establish a 
psychopathic group by means of a check list of characteristics

which was developed from unanimous psychiatric rating of 
various characteristics of the psychopath* Such a list 
could be used by someone (e*g. the writer) without 
having to rely on the services of a psychiatrist, and 
yet present a method of diagnosis which would be similar 
to that used by the psychiatrist, were he available*

CHAPTER 2 

HISTORY OF THE CONCEPT OF THE PSYCHOPATHIC PERSONALITY 

Many articles have been written on the history of 
psychopathy* Henderson (3l) and Gurvitz (23) give 
admirable accounts of the historical trends of thought 
relating to this concept* 

Even a brief account of the history of psychopathy 
must mention the name of Prichard, who in 1635* coined 
the terms l! moral insanity” and "moral imbecility*” 

Most writers claim that following Pinel*s description of 
the " manie sans delire ,” Prichard may be considered 
one of the first men to draw attention to what we now 
term "psychopathy*” However, it is of interest to note 
that in 1561, Jerome Cardan of Pavia (who, it is claimed, 
was a brilliant intellect and pioneer in psychiatry) 
gave an admirable description of what may be a psycho¬ 
pathic personality* In his book, Utilitate ex Odversis 
Capenda * (1561), he describes immorality as corresponding 
to a moral mania* He claims that "immorality is nothing 
more than a disease of the spirit, and malignant stupidity 
which does not reach the point of total insanity because 
even the immoral are able to control their will power to 
a certain extent^ (37)• 

1 An interesting feature relating to Cardan*s writing 
is that it was done after he had beheaded his son and 
poisoned his wife* (One may wonder at the apparent 
insight that Cardan had of this syndrome*)

It -would be difficult to determine the origin of the 
psychopath* One could speculate that he existed from 
the first time there was a human community* Some 
writers might claim that psychopathic behaviour is the 
result of man’s fight for survival* Others might 
claim that Cain (33) himself portrays the psychopathic 
personality very well\ 

Koch, in 1&3&, coined the term "psychopathic 
inferiority*” In 1906, Naecke termed this as '’moral 
idiocy.” Six years later, Adolf Meyer excluded the 
neurosis from psychopaths, claiming the origin of the 
psychopath was in constitutional inferiorities* Stein, 
in 1913* set up a classification for ’’moral insanity.” 

He believed it had one of two forms; i.e. either con¬ 
genital or acquired* By 1914, the criminal qualities 
of psychopathy were receiving recognition. Bimbaum 
claimed that the psychopath could not be identified with 
the criminal, nor was criminal behaviour ’’the primary 
manifestation of the psychopath." In 1917, Tredgold 
and Mercier disagreed on the definition of "moral 

1 Gain appears to present a rather good example of the 
psychopath’s lack of affectivity, and also his narcis¬ 
sistic attitude* He appears to have felt badly when 
apprehended for his crime. let, no feelings of sor¬ 
row or remorse are evidenced for his actual committing 
of the crime« 

To some, the story of Cain might present grounds for 
arguing the heredity component of psychopathy. To 
others (e.g. Visher) it might appear that if Cain 
were the first psychopath—the "typical” characteristic 
feature of wanderlust was forced upon him*

imbecility, " Glueck, in 191&, began possibly the first 
scientific evaluation of the criminal psychopath at 
Sing Sing, Later studies were carried on by Visher who 
in studying veterans, came to the conclusion that military 
life provided a sublimation for the wanderlust of the 
psychopath, "Moral imbecility" in the British Mental 
Deficiency Act was changed to "moral defective" in 192?. 

In 1930, there appears to be a sudden uprise of 
thought with a somewhat original trend, Alexander put 
forth his idea of the "neurotic character" who lives 
out his impulse and who succeeds in "actualizing (his) 
world of fantasy, despite the fact that (he may) do 
so by bringing disaster upon (himself)," To Alexander, 
the psychopath appeared to live a life "full of demoniac 
compulsion,” His ego is so permeated by the id that 
conscious conflict and insight are absent. Partridge, 
however, describes the clinical manifestations of the 
psychopath as being either neurotic in nature, or 
strongly infantile. To him, the psychopath represented 
a person in whom "strong demands were accompanied by 
feelings of inadequacy, inferiority or insecurity," 

The psychopath reacted to this in one or more typical 
reaction patterns of "tantrums, sulks and running away," 

He believed that such a person was acting in this manner 
to protect himself against some forms of mental illness. 
Partridge at this time presented his term "sociopathy"—

which designated a deviation in social relations of 
individuals or groups, and believed that such a term 
was better than that of "psychopathy." 

Kahn, in 1931, postulated quantitative deviations 
in impulse life, temperament, ego and character. He 
believed that the psychopath met the same problems as 
did others, yet the psychopath adjusted differently to 
these problems. 

Noyes claims that Kahn offered little influence 
on current thinking, as his concept was a theoretical 
one. Noyes explained psychopathic behaviour as an 
expression of unconcious conflict. Here the conflict 
was expressed through "stereotyped, irrational and 
socially inept or hostile behaviour." The symptom in 
the psychopath was that of a "moral defect." 

In 1934, Schilder appears to have followed Noyes 
thinking. To Schilder, psychopaths are "those abnormal 
personalities -who suffer from their abnormality or 
produce suffering in their environment." 

Three years later, Wittels returned to the psycho¬ 
analytic concept of the psychopath. He believed that 
there was a fixation at the protophallic state, and 
thus there was no anxiety and little or undeveloped superego. 
Hay followed this trend of thought when in the following 
year he termed such cases as "partial moral mania," whose

symptoms were “the occurrence of irresistable impulses,” 
Henderson seems to have attempted to consolidate the 
heredity and environmental viewpoints regarding psycho¬ 
pathy, He gives a working definition of “psychopathic 
states,” which he claims are caused by the interaction 
of heredity and environmental factors, 

Cleckley, in the Mask of Sanity (1941), states that 
the psychopath suffers from “semantic dementia”; i,e, 
he goes through only the outer manifestations of function¬ 
ing. 

In 1944, p reu (5i) brings out the current conception 
that the diagnosis of the psychopath is done by “exclu¬ 
sion, “ He mentions that **when an attempt is made to 
pin down the diagnosis of the psychopath in terms of 
pathognomic symptoms, it vanishes as a clinical entity,” 

He believed that “the psychopathic personality is not a 
recognizable entity in the descriptive behavioural sense, 
Preu pointed out the vagueness of the diagnosis—but 

t: 

offered little to clarify it, 

Brieker, in 1945, offered a return to the conflict 
conception of the psychopath. The manner in which the 
psychopath solves his conflict, distinguishes him from 
the psychotic and the neurotic. The psychopath has only 
outer conflict to contend with. He is unable to conceive 
moral standards of the group and must (if he is to be 
helped) develop a “common sense."

The factor of learning socially acceptable behaviour 
is continued by Cason* ■who from 1946 to 194& contended 
that the psychopath cannot control his behaviour because 
he has not learned to do so# Thus, to Cason, the 
psychopath presents a case of ’’unlearned behaviour#” 

Bender* s work with psychopathic children in 1946 
appears to again return to the idea that the typical 
impulse behaviour is ’’pre-cedi pal, pre-superego, and 
pre-narcissistie.” The psychopath can imitate behaviour 
yet there is no relationship to real meaning of experience^. 

Maughs (5$) given a good description of the history 
of the psychopath# In his paper he mentions that the 
concept of psychopathy could be divided into three 
periods. The first period (1S0Q-1900) he called the 
period of ’’moral insanity.” The second period (1900- 
1924) he terms the ’’psychopathy” period. The third 
period (1925-1941) he called the ’’psycho-dynamic” 
period. 

Many of the current writers, with the exception of 
individuals like Freyhan, who has previously been men¬ 
tioned, and the odd medical man who claims that such a 
person as the psychopath may not even be human, are of the 
opinion that such a syndrome actually exists* The 
dynamic interplay of both social and psychological forces 
seems to be accepted in accounting for the psychopathic 

behaviour. Lourie (40) differentiates between psychopathic 
1 Taken primarily from Gurvits ( 23 ) and Henderson (3lT*

behaviour and psychopathic personality* He claims that 
the latter does not necessarily indulge in the former* 

The emphasis that the psychopathic personality has the 
ability to learn the socially acceptable forms of beha¬ 
viour is perhaps over-stressed by Lourie. Usually, one 
must judge underlying personality by overt behaviour* 
Behaviour thus is synonymous with personality which is 
deduced from the behaviour itself* In view of this, no 
difference will be made in describing either the person¬ 
ality per se or the behaviour per se, throughout the 
rest of this study* 

The psychoanalytic viewpoint on psychopathy appears 
to favor the idea of a weak, absent or partial superego 
(l7)o Because of this condition of the superego, the 
psychopath is able to "isolate" this portion of his ego 
by the "bribing 1 " of it (!?)• That is, to Fenichel, 
the superego can be bribed not to interfere with the 
impulse gratification—providing there is a good chance 
of forthcoming punishment for the individual* Bergler 
is in agreement in part with Fenichel *3 ideas but 
insists that there is a superego which is compara¬ 
tively strong (i*e* it is strong enough to cause the 
unconscious bribing of it)* Cleckley (ll) also agrees 
with the punishment desire of the psychopath* Alexander’s 
"neurotic character" appears to exhibit this allowance 
of impulse behaviour with the proviso that there will be

The foregoing statements depict a very brief 
account of the history of the psychopathic personality 
and give a hint only of the current ideas on the subject. 
One must be aware that the field of psychopathy is 
large and is composed of many areas of thought (e.g. 
psychoanalytical, social, medical, legal, etc.)which 
could not be covered adequately in a paper of this 
scope.

CHAPTER 3 

REVIEW OF PREVIOUS STUDIES 1 ON PSYCHOPATHY 


Throughout the Psychological Abstracts for at 
least the past twenty-five years, there are articles 
on either a study of psychopathy or on the concept 
itself in the literature each year* This indicates 
that there is, and has been, a great deal of interest 
in this area since about the time of Alexander 1 s 
publication on the f, neurotie characterKimberg 2 3 
has mentioned that ”in the good old times one exported 
such cases (i.e. psychopaths) to the United States 
where most of them -went to the dogs or were sent back 
by their consulate.” However, the times of such lack 
of interest in this type of individual are long past. 

Not only psychiatrists and psychologists are interested 
in him, but so are the law enforcing agencies and the 

3 

general public . The interest in the psychopath is 
not confined to the West but may be seen in the East 

(e.g. the work done by Dai in Peiping) (14)« 

1 Work done by such authorities in psychopathy as 
Karpman, B., and Lindner, R., are not cited as they 
are given in journals not available for this study 
at the University of Alberta. 

2 Taken from Psychological Abstracts: Kimberg, 0. On 
the Concept of "psychopathy” and the Treatment of the 

So-Called ?t Psychopaths”— 1 Theoria. 1946, 12 p 69. 

3 This was indicated in the coverage given by the local 
newspapers to the investigation on the ’’sexual psycho¬ 
path” by the Royal Commission in its attempt to revise 
the Criminal Code of Canada.

The present review does not presume to take in the 
broad area of psychopathic studies, but confines itself 
to studies which may be of interest to the problem 
under discussion. This will include studies relating 
to methods of determining diagnostic criteria for the 
psychopathic group and results obtained from a "psycho¬ 
pathic" group on the MMPI. 

Bemberg (2) presents a study which is similar in 
part to the first portion of the present investigation. 
He has developed a questionnaire which he claims 
measures social conformity in the individual. This 
differs from the check list of characteristics dis¬ 
cussed in the present study in that Bemberg*s list 
is checked by the subject, whereas the list used by 
the writer is checked by the examiner. 

Cason (?) presents an excellent study of deter¬ 
mining psychopathic characteristics. He used subjects 
who were released from a Federal penitentiary and were 
confined to a hospital which was exclusively for psycho¬ 
pathic individuals. By splitting his groups of willing 
subjects into three groups (i.e. 1. a maladjusted group; 
2. a psychopathic group; 3. a criminal psychopathic 
group) and comparing them with a control group (i.e. 
staff of the hospital) he arrived at a list of twenty 
characteristics. He used a list of 1000 sub items on 

which each group was checked. The items which dif¬ 
ferentiated the psychopathic group from the others

were then grouped into five super groupings* These 
were called: 

lo Historical—e*g* History of poor behaviour 
2. Morals—e*g* Poor conscience 
3® Cognition—e*g* Egocentric 
4® Affection—e*g« Hostile 
5® Conation—e«g. Impulsive 

Four items were included under each heading given above^. 

Clark et al (10) give an account of an excellent 
study on psychopathy. They have noted that the psycho¬ 
path and the prisoner may be very distinct. They also 
mention the fact that what they are presenting is merely 
a cross-sectional study at a particular point in the 
individual*s life in prison. This fact is too often 
overlooked by investigators and may result in sweeping 
conclusions which may not be valid in any other setting 
but that of a prison. The study by Clark et al is 
perhaps one of the most systematic presented in the 
literature in regard to studies on the psychopath. They 
state the general criteria on which their diagnosis of 
a psychopath is based (i.e. that presented by Henderson 
and Clecklejr). In this manner, they determined a psycho¬ 
pathic group of prisoners. Then, using a control group 
of randomly selected prisoners, thej?- compared the two

in the check list of the present study. The items in 
the list of the present study differ in their source 
from Cason*s.

tj^pes of groups to determine which characteristics 
differentiated the two groups. They used I.Q. tests, 
questionnaires, EEG*s and even capillary microscopy 
of fingernails to determine characteristics which 
differentiated these two types of groups from each 
other with a significance at, or better than, the 1% 
level# Their findings included,among other things, 
that criminal behaviour in the legal sense is almost 
irrelevant in distinguishing the psychopathic group 
from the control prison group. Another finding was 
that broken homes are not a significant factor in the 
psychopath^. 

In direct contrast to Clark*s excellent study is 
the one done by Rogers (52). Rogers appears to have 
attempted a study similar to Clark f s—but his method 
was erroneous. He established a psychopathic group 
by separating it from a control group on the basis of 
what he believed might be psychopathic characteristics. 
Then he proceeded to verify his criteria with these 
same two groups . Of course he achieved an excellent 
level of significance for his criteria. 

Halperin (25) has done a general personality study 

of the prison group in Hawaii. This study concerned 

1 Greenacre (22) mentions that the psychopath may use 
the fact of poor socio-economic background as a 
rationalization for his imprisonment.

not only white prisoners, but also the oriental groups. 
Using data collected from case histories, short psychi¬ 
atric interviews, the Rorschach, the Wechsler-Bellevue 
and Bender Gestalt, Halperin prepared an over-all psycho¬ 
logical profile. The results of this profile indicated 
psychopathy of a neurotic or psychotic nature which 
differences he believed ”significant” enough to eliminate 
the need to use the diagnostic label of psychopathic 
personality for his group# 

Hathaway ( 26 ), using the Bemreuier personality test, 
worked with individuals whom he considered to be psycho¬ 
pathic inferiors. He found this test useful in that 
it showed this group to have no neurotic symptoms and 
presented what he termed 1 11 super-normal” behaviour. From 
these studies he began work on the MMPI psychopathic 
deviate scale\ (45) The limitations of the Pd scale 
are obvious. He used groups that were certainly not well 
defined as being psychopathic. In fact, his first group 

consisted primarily of girls sent to him from the courts

for psychiatric investigation* Thus, the items of the 
preliminary scales were weighted with factors represent¬ 
ing a group of offenders rather than psychopaths* The 
group upon which he standardized his final test was a 

o 

prison group of men who were diagnosed as “psychopathic ." 
Thus, the final Pd scale is heavily loaded with a prison 
factor (which may or may not be indicative of the psycho¬ 
path). One might well question the validity of the Pd 
scale to indicate psychopathic personalities. It may 
be valid only for a prison group. 

Other studies such as Guthrie*s (24), Meehl (47) 
and Schmidt (55) are rather inadequate as they do not 
give any information as to the criteria used in diagnos¬ 
ing their psychopathic groups. Meehl, in fact, assumes 
the validity of the Pd scale, and using a high Pd scale 
as a basis for establishing a conduct disorder^group, 
he then draws conclusions as to what their profile should 
look like* To check the validity of his assumptions, he 
refers his group to the diagnosis made in the clinic. 

On the basis of good agreement with what he termed a 
conduct disordered individual from the MMPI profile 
and what the clinical diagnosis also called a conduct 

1 It appears from this article that he may have derived 
some of his Pd items from case histories of individuals 
whom he met in his clinical work. 

2 He does not say what criteria were used to diagnose 
these prisoners. 

3* This group contained chiefly psychopathic individuals.

disordered individual, he assumed that the profile 
peculiar to that group was also representative of all 
conduct disorder groups. 

Fry (19) has done a study on a group of male prison 
inmates using the MMPI. He has not attempted to select 
his group but merely states that it is a representation 
of perhaps a general prison group* His study is valuable 
to this investigation and will be discussed in a later 
chapter. 

Work has been done in the military field (3,9) 
using the MMPI to distinguish between the offender and 
non-offender. However, these groups were rather select 
in that they were composed of army men. No attempt was 
made to select a psychopathic or non-psychopathic group 
in these studies. 

Although many of the studies using the MMPI are 
related to determining a specific profile for certain 

diagnostically significant personality types, not all 

y 

the studies using the MMPI are restricted to this area* 
Some workers have assumed its validity to be great 
enough to warrant using it as a diagnostic tool on 
which to diagnose groups on whom other studies may 
be based. Levy and Kennard (3#) appear to have fallen 
into this latter group. They have used "Pd profiles 11 
and then compared the EEG records of such subjects.

Their results indicate that there is evidence of 
abnormal EEG records of subjects showing a Pd profile* 
However, they imply in their findings that further work 
may indicate that the EEG will be able to separate 
psychopaths from non-psychopaths. Perhaps they are 
putting the "cart before the horse" in their technique 
and might better perform first a study on the validity 
of the MMPI in distinguishing psychopaths from non¬ 
psychopaths, and secondly (providing the validity of 
the MMPI was established), perform their experiment* 

The present study involves the development of 
diagnostic criteria by which the psychopathic group is 
distinguished from the other prison groups. This study 
does not state what a psychopath is but rather shows what 
the psychopathic group used in this work represents * 

In this manner, one may evaluate the results of the 
MMPI found in this study accordingly.

CHAPTER 4 


THE PRISON GROUP 


Subject used in this study were inmates of the 
Provincial Gaol for Men, Regina, Saskatchewan. This 
is a provincial institute which accommodated about 
200 male prisoners at the time of this study. 

Essentially, three types of male prisoners are 
incarcerated in the Gaol; 

1. sentenced inmates from ages 16 to 26 years 
with sentences ranging up to two years less 
one day. 

2. prisoners of any age who have been convicted 
of such crimes as vagrancy and are sentenced 
to less than 31 days. 

3* remand cases\ 

From the first type of inmate mentioned above, a 
group was selected for this study. Selection was 
based on the followings 

1. only white inmates were selected (i.e. no 

Indian or Metis subjects were used). In this way, it 

1 Remand... ."is the return to custody of an accused 
person to prison or for their admission to jail on 
the adjournment of the hearing of a criminal charge 
in a police court. The remand in the case of a 
person charged with an indictable offence must not 
exceed eight days. A remand may be granted for 
securing attendance of witnesses, for making 
inquiries into the previous career of the accused or 
other responsible cause.”—Mozley & Whiteley^ Law 
Dictionary, 3rd Edition p»2Bl. Pub. West & Neave.

was assumed that some cultural and ethnic differences 
would be avoided. 

2. only inmates who were serving a sentence of 
60 days or more were selected. Again it was assumed 
that this would further aid in selecting a more homo¬ 
genous group. 

3. only literate inmates who expressed willingness 
to be tested were used. 

4* only subjects who were given the entire battery 

1 2 
of tests were used • 

5« only subjects whose Wechsler Bellevue Intelligence 

Test showed a full scale I.Q. of 70 or more were used. 

In this way, subjects who might be considered as 

"inadequate personalities” because of mental deficiency 

3 

were eliminated ♦ 

6. Only subjects who were not given (or recommended 
for)psychiatric examination on the grounds of a possible 
neurotic or psychotic disturbance were used^. 

Approximately 150 inmates were administered the MMPI 
but because of the above-mentioned selection, only 118 
were utilized in this study. 

1 Test battery included: the MMPI, the Rorschach Ink Blot 
Test, the Machover Draw-a-Person Test, The Thematic 
Apperception Test, and the Wechsler-Bellevue Intelligence 
Test—Form I. 

2 In this manner, one could possibly use the groups esta¬ 
blished with the check list for further study using 
the tests mentioned. 

3 One case was eliminated for this reason. 

4 Five subjects were eliminated for this reason.

CHAPTER 5 

ADMINISTRATION OF TESTS TO THE REGINA GAOL INMATES 

The MMPI (group form) was administered to 11$ white 
male prison inmates* Directions were as given on the 
test booklet* 

Actual administration of the test was both individual 
and in groups of less than six* In most of the cases, 
the test was completed in one session. Each test was 
scored and individual profiles drawn and coded according 
to the method outlined by Hathaway and McKinley (30). 

Other tests were also administered to the inmates 
at this time. However, as a study of this size will 
not include findings of all the tests administered, only 
the MMPI results are included in the main body. Wechsler- 
Bellevue results were used to establish a basis for accep¬ 
tance or rejection of the subject on grounds of adequate 
or inadequate intelligence. The minimum I.Q. of 70 
(represented by the Full Scale I.Q.) was considered to 
be the lowest level on which an individual could operate 
efficiently^, and any with an I.Q. below this level were 
rejected. The reason for such rejection was that the 

individual may have committed a crime through lack of 

1 Dr. Russon had expressed the opinion that an I.Q. 
of 70 might be considered the minimum for adequate 
operation in society.

CHAPTER 6 


CHECK LIST OF PSYCHOPATHIC CHARACTERISTICS 


Since there were no psychiatric services available 

at the Regina Gaol which could be used to diagnose a 

psychopathic group, it was necessary to construct a 

tool which would be representative of local psychiatric 

opinion of psychopathic characteristics, but which 

would not require a psychiatrist to use it, A method 

which appeared to be useful was that of a check list 

of psychopathic characteristics. 

Characteristics of the "psychopathic personality" 

were chosen from the literature. These characteristics 

(with their sources) are given in Appendix l\ 

The various characteristics were then grouped into 

several groups, with grouping being based on some 

2 

common attribute of the characteristics , Each group 

1 This list of characteristics was drawn up in about 
three days* The reasons for this haste were: 

a. The approval to work in Regina Gaol came only a 
short time previous to the writer's final exam¬ 
inations , 

b. At about this same time, it became apparent that 
there would be no psychiatric services available 
by which to establish an experimental group 
(i.e, psychopaths), 

c. It was not ascertained whether or not data for 
this research could be gathered during the working 
hours at the Gaol or would have to be done on the 
examinees own time. Consequently, the examiner 
deemed it wise to arrive at the Gaol as early as 
possible in order to gather the maximum amount of 
data for this work, 

2 Dr, D. Spearman kindly consented to group these for 
me. Dr, Spearman also was instrumental in giving a

was given a simple title phrase. From these title 

phrases, a list containing 56 phrases or items was 
3 

prepared . Directions for checking the list were 

as given in Appendix 1. The rater was asked to 

check each item with one of the following ratings: 

VS - very significant 

S - significant 

IS - little significance 

Several of these check lists were submitted to 

Dr. McKerracher, Director of Psychiatric Services, 

Province of Saskatchewan. He was asked to submit one 

list to each psychiatrist whom he considered qualified 

to rate it. He, in turn, submitted the list to nine 

psychiatrists and scored one himself. The results of 

these check list ratings are given in Table I. 

The results on this check list were somewhat 

devastating and disheartening^. Only seven lists could 

5 

be considered as valid • Three of these seven check 

title phrase for each group of characteristics which 
were then incorporated into the check list as items. 

3 There were 57 items appearing in the check list but 
one item was a repeater. Several of the psychiatrists 
scored this same item differently in their ratings. 

4 Of 56 different characteristics of psychopaths (as 
given in the literature), 10 psychiatrists could only 
agree unanimously on the rating of one, i.e. that the 
item “Dull, phlegmatic” was of "little significance” 
as a psychopathic characteristic. 

5 One rater double scored an item, i.e.he scored it as 
”S-LS.” Another rater scored one item as ”?.” Another 
rater left one item unscored«,

lists were chosen by inspection on the basis that they 

represented unanimous opinion on more of the items than 

did the other raters. From these three lists, items 

were drawn which each of the three raters had scored 

as either VS or S and such items were used to prepare 

a final check list of psychopathic characteristics. 

Items rated as LS were not included in the check list 

as they appeared to be too weak an indicator of the 

presence of psychopathic characteristics# Thus, from 

a total of IS items which three psychiatrists rated 

1 

the same, 12 were chosen for a final check list • 

Arbitrary scores of 2 (for VS items) and 1 (for S 

items) were given for each of the 12 items and a total 

possible score for the entire list was 22# 

The final check list is given in Appendix 2. 

This list is not proven to be a valid or reliable tool 

but is merely one which is indicative of unanimous 

psychiatric thought of three Saskatchewan psychiatrists 

on certain characteristics which they believe to be 

indicative of the psychopath. 

This portion of the study does not presume to 

indicate that the original check list is representative 

1 Item 23 on the original check list was not included 
as it was assumed that this would be a ”common” 
characteristic of the entire gaol group (i,e. all 
showed inadequate behavior to society) and as such 
the item would not aid in differentiating the psycho¬ 
path from the non-psychopath in the gaol setting#

of all the characteristics of the psychopathie person¬ 
ality; nor does it attempt to claim that it represents 
all or even the majority of psychiatric opinion on the 
matter. It is only a ’’spot check” on characteristics 
of the psychopath and is an attempt to show how the 
psychiatrist (who is usually the person responsible for 
the diagnosing of the ’’psychopathic personality”) uses 
these characteristics in his diagnosing. The results 

would indicate that the psychopathic concept is still 
1 

very vague . 

The final check list is one which was used in 
this study and is representative of psychiatrists 
who might have made the diagnoses of psychopathic person¬ 
ality on inmates of this Gaol. That is, these same 
psychiatrists or their colleagues may have given a 
diagnosis of ’’psychopathic personality” which the 
writer would have had to accept to set up his groups. 

It is presumed that these psychiatrists would have 
used the same criteria for arriving at their diagnoses. 


1 Comments from the raters varied from stating that 

the items represented a ’’chaotic” study of ’’attitudes” 
to pointing out that certain items (e.g. numbers 6 and 
11) were contradictory. Many of the comments were 
valuable, but their primary value lay in the fact 
that not only were the psychiatrists themselves aware 
(and pointed out in many cases) that the concept of 
psychopathy is vague, contradictory and chaotic, but 
that even within the psychiatric circle of Saskat¬ 
chewan itself, there was little convergence of opinion 
on the subject. One might wonder how an individual is 
diagnosed as a ’’psychopathic personality,” when such 
confusion of thought exists in diagnostic criteria. 
This may have some bearing on why results obtained

as that represented in the final check list. Thus, by 

careful useage of the check list, it was assumed that 

a non-psychiatrist could arrive at a similar diagnosis 

as any or all of the three psychiatrists represented, 

by using psychiatrically diagnosed ’’psychopaths” 
may not be too satisfactory and may not always 
agree from group to group.

CHAPTER 7 

THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A "PSYCHOPATHIC," "NON-PSYCHOPATHIC" 
AND "GENERAL" PRISON GROUP 

To determine a "psychopathic" group and a "non- 
psychopathic" group from a prison population, the check 
list previously described was used* It was assumed, 
of course, that not all prisoners were psychopaths 
( 7 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 48 , 52 ). 

The method followed was that of checking US 
subjects used in the study on the check list* Checking 
was done as follows: 

1. All ratings were done independently of other tests. 

2. The only factual material used in the checking was 
the social history, criminal record and file of 
each inmate. 

3» Those inmates who were working under a Trades 
Instructor or in a group were, in some cases, 
rated by either or both the Trades Instructor 
and/or the Group Worker. 

4* Final rating given to each subject was by the 

writer. Such rating was based on previous ratings, 

1 

social history, criminal record, personal contact 
and through interviews. 

1 The writer spent approximately six months gathering 
data for this research. During this time he lived at 
Regina Gaol and, consequent3_y, had an excellent oppor¬ 
tunity to observe the inmates during all periods of 
the day and evening.

By inspection, the 1X& subjects were split into 
three groups* One group consisted of approximately 
one-third of the subjects and represented the highest 
scorers on the check list. Another group consisted of 
approximately one-third of the total subjects and repre¬ 
sented the lowest scorers on the check list. The other 
group represented those subjects whose scores were 
neither considered as being high tot low. In this 
manner, arbitrary cutting points were established for 
the upper and lower groups. The upper group was com¬ 
posed of 35 subjects whose scoreson the check list 
were greater than 15; the lower group was composed of 
41 subjects who had scores of less than 9; the central 
group of 42 subjects had scores of 9 to 15 inclusive. 

Having established three groups, it was assumed 
that the top-scoring group might- be representative of 
a “psychopathic” group; the lowest scoring group might 
represent the “non-psychopathic” group and the central 
group might be representative of the “general prison” 
group. These groups will be termed Group I, Group II 
and Group III from this point on in this paper 

Possible criticism of this technique is that the 

1 These groups were indicated as I, II and III because 
Groups I and II are the groups which are most important 
in this study whereas Group III or the “general” group 
is that group of prisoners who do not exhibit either 
“psychopathic” or "non-psychopathic” characteristics 
as outlined in this study.

examiner might well be faulty in his ratings of the 
subjects, His opinion of the various subjects might be 
erroneous in view of his close and subjective contacts 
with them. He may consciously or otherwise be influenced 
by previous tests which he administered to the subjects, 

He lacks clinical experience in observation andthus 
may present erroneous and biased ratings. 

Defence against the above criticism is difficult, 
but perhaps possible along some points. It is true that 
the technique is very subjective; yet, is such subjectiv¬ 
ity unique in such work? In what manner Is the psychia¬ 
trist more objective in his diagnosis of the psychopathic 
personality? In this study, a frame of reference was 
established (and based on psychiatric opinion throughout). 
Do psychiatrists work from or within such a frame of 
reference? This study works from an objective standard 
(the items of the final check list). Do psychiatrists 
have such an objective standard from which they work? 

The objectivity of psychiatrists is very questionable 
in view of the fact that they differ so widely among 
themselves in rating psychopathic characteristics. 

It is true that the examiner did have ample 
opportunity to view the subject in many different situa¬ 
tions, Such opportunity may have clouded his judgments 
and made his rating faulty. However, one questions the 
negative aspect of this, especially in view of the

diagnosis of an individual given by a psychiatrist after 
a matter of 20 or 30 minutes in ’which he interviewed him* 
The psychiatrist has seen the subject for a short time 
in a very structured setting, yet feels competent in 
diagnosing him. 

The conscious or unconscious influence of previous 
testing of the subject is difficult and almost impos¬ 
sible to defend. All the subjects had previously been 
tested with the entire battery of tests prior to the 
final checking of the check list. However, not all the 
tests were scored. None of the tests was used in 
arriving at any of the checking on the check lists. In 
the examiner's opinion, it was practically impossible 
to remember the various tests for the various subjects 
and any influence of test information on his checking 
would be limited to the unconscious. 

The lack of clinical experience is a point which 
cannot be defended. 

A plausible criticism of the findings is: How 
does one know that Group I is representative of a 
"psychopathic" group and that Group II represents a 
"non-psychopathie” group? The writer does not claim 
that Group I is representative of a "psychopathic" 
group, nor that Group II represents a "non-psychopathic" 
group. The former group merely shows more so-called 
"psychopathic" characteristics than the other two

CHAPTER S 

MMPI RESULTS OF THE VARIOUS REGINA PRISON GROUPS 
AND COMPARISON WITH AN AMERICAN PRISON GROUP 


Means and standard deviations were computed for 
each of the thirteen MMPI scales for the entire prison 
group and for the three groups* These results are 
shown in raw scores in Table II. The K correctional 
factor ( 46 , 47A) has been added to five of the scales 1 , 
and the means and standard deviations are indicated 
for these scales when the K factor has been added and 
when it has not. Following this, composite profiles 
were drawn up for the entire prison group (Fig* l), 
Groups I and II (Fig. 2), Group III and the entire 
prison group (Fig. 3 ) and Groups I, II and III (Fig. 4)* 
Each profile has had the appropriate K factor added to 
the various scales. 

Composite profiles were also drawn up for the 
various groups and exhibited the five scales without 
the K factor being added. These profiles are shown 
in Figures 5 to 8 . 

1 This is a correctional factor which, when added to 
the Hs, Pd, Pt, Sc and Ma scales, is intended to 
accentuate the discrimination powers of these scales. 
The amount of K added to each scale is as follows: 

Hs plus .5K 
Pd plus .4K 
Pt plus IK 
Sc plus IK 
Ma plus . 2 K

Differences between the mean raw scores for all the 
scales for all the groups were computed and are pre¬ 
sented in Table III. These, again, show the scales with 
and without the K factor being added. 

Mean T-scores for the various Regina groups and the 
differences between them are shown in Table IV. 

Critical ratios were computed^ for all the scales 
except the question scale and the three check scales 
(i.e. the L, F and K scales), for the entire prison 
group and the other three groups. These findings are 
given in Table V. 

Frequencies of the various high-point codes for 
Groups I, II and III are given in Table VI. These 
frequencies include only the two highest scales repre¬ 
sented in the coding. 

In Figure it appears that there is a progres¬ 
sively increasing score-trend in the Hy, Pd plus .4K, 

Pt pltis IK, and the Ms, plus .2K scales for the three 
groups. The significance of this trend is shown in 
Table V. Here, it is of interest to note that the 
"psychopathic" and "non-psychopathic" groups are 
differentiated by the above-mentioned scales with a 
significance at better than the 0.7$ level of con¬ 
fidence. That is, there is a possibility of these 
two groups getting identical scores on these scales 

only seven times in one thousand. On this basis, it

work involved.

appears that one can safely say that two groups have 
be segregated from a prison population on the basis of 
the four MMPI scales# This generalization appears to 
be confirmed by the coding frequencies and percentages 
of frequencies of the three prison groups given in 
Tables VI and VI-A respectively# Here it is apparent 
that Group I has not only a smaller distribution of 
codes than have Groups U and III, but has the greater 
number of Pd plus #4K and Ma plus #2K profiles—both 
scales with a T-score of 70 or greater and with the 
Pd having a higher T-score than the Ma\ Conversely, 
Group II has the greatest range of codes and does not 
show a large frequency of 49 f type of profiles. The 
magnitude of code range and 49 1 type of profile for 
Group III appears to lie somexdiere between that shown 
by Groups I and II. 

A logical criticism which may be directed at 
this portion of the study is: Hox^r do we know that the 
Regina Gaol group is representative of a prison group? 
They may be a selected sample rather than a representa¬ 
tive sample and, as such, the study would not be valid 
for other prison groups per se. To strengthen the 

1 Hereinafter, this type of coding will be referred 
to as 49' indicating that the Pd scale is greater 
than the Ma scale and that both scales are the 
highest two on the entire profile and have a T- 
score of at least 70#

position of the Regina study, it was deemed advisable 
to compare the results of the entire group with some 
other prison group, using the MMPI as a basis of com¬ 
parison. 

A study carried out by Fry (19) appears to have a 
comparable group of white, male inmates who may be 
representative of those in an American State prison. 

Part of his study included using the MMPI on ?6 white, 
male, literate subjects, who were (at the time of his 
investigation) incarcerated in a state prison. Their 
mean age was 32, and they showed a mean I.Q. of slightly 
greater than 100, i.e. they were of average intelligence. 
Results obtained on the various MMPI scales are given 
in Table VII. The composite profile for his group is 
given in Figures 9 and 10. 

His group was compared to the entire Regina Group, 
and the mean T-scores on the various MMPI scales for 
these two groups are given (along with the differences 
between the means) on Table VII. 

Composite profiles for Fry’s group*and the entire 
Regina Group are shown in Figure 9- 

1 The S.D. for Fry’s group is also given for the scales. 
These are not available for the Regina Group as all 
computations for this study were done using raw scores. 
It is impossible to determine the significance of the 
differences between the various scales of Fry’s group 
and the Regina Groups as without a great amount of 
further work, standard deviations of Regina T-scores 
are not available to compute the critical ratios for 
both groups.

Differences between Fry’s Group and the entire 
Regina Group are relatively small. None of them is 
greater than (or as great as) one of Fry’s standard 
deviations for the various scales® Both groups exhibit 
similar MMPI profiles with Fry’s group showing a con¬ 
sistently higher profile on all scales, but the Ft 
plus IK and the Ka plus ,2K. 

Fry’s group was also compared with Groups I and 
III in regard to the MMPI profile exhibited by each 
group® These profiles are shown (superimposed) on 
Figure 10. It appears that Fry’s group lies between 
the Group I and Group III profiles on the Pd plus .4K> 

Pa, Sc plus IK and Ma plus .2K scales* Only on one 
scale (the Pt plus IK) does Fry’s group exhibit lower 
scores than the Group III of the Regina study. 

Table VIII indicates the results (in T-scores) for the 
various Regina groups and Fry’s group for the nine 
MMPI scales. It is interesting to note that although 
Fry’s group and Group III vary 3*3 T-scores on the 
Pd plus .4K scale, they have identical scores on the 
Ma plus o2K scale. 

These results appear to strengthen the conclusion 
that the entire Regina Gaol group is a representative 
(rather than a select) prison group. They also confirm 
the conclusion that Group III may be a ’’general" prison 
group rather than a representative prison group (i.s. the 






59 


'*general” group appears to have most of the psycho¬ 
paths and non-psychopaths segregated from it).

CHAPTER 9 

CONCLUSIONS 

The check list used in the present study should 
have some of its many weaknesses and limitations brought 
to the attention of the reader® Its items do not 
represent unanimous psychiatric opinion but merely 
represent the ratings of three out of ten Saskatchewan 
psychiatrists® It is impossible to estimate how many 
of these characteristics must be exhibited before a sub¬ 
ject may be diagnosed as psychopathic® The relative 
strength of the various items has also not been deter¬ 
mined. One might well ask if each item carries the 
same significance to the final rater as it did to the 
psychiatrists who originally rated it\ These are 
only a few of the very evident criticisms which one 
may direct at the check list. However, one must admit 
that such a list does make positive contributions to 
the diagnosing of psychopathic personalities in that it 
provides a framework of reference and is, perhaps, a 
relatively good tool in vieitf of many of the facts men¬ 
tioned in a previous chapter regarding present psychiatric 

1 Later discussion with one of the raters indicated that 
he did not have quite the same idea of the signifi¬ 
cance of some of the items as did the examiner. How 
true this was for other original raters is difficult 
to ascertain, but it may be one of the reasons there 
was such a divergence of psychiatric opinion on the 
original check list.

diagnostic techniques* 

The study is only a pilot project in a field which 
abounds with studies (not all of which are above reproof; 
e.g* Levy and Kennard’s (36) and Rogers (52) )* It 
appears to be a study using a technique never before 
described (to the writer’s knowledge) in the literature. 
It is built on psychiatric opinion throughout and is 
strengthened by the fact that it is representative of 
unanimous rating by three psychiatrists in the area in 
which it was used® It is also strengthened by the fact 
that only items which were considered as being either 
’’very significant” or ”significant” in diagnosing a 
psychopath (and which appeared useful in distinguishing 
him from others in the prison setting' 1 2 ') were used . 

Some of the ways in which later study might improve 
the check list as a diagnostic tool are: 

1. Go through the original list and note which 
items were given the most emphasis by the 
literature. In this manner, one might estab¬ 
lish an independent weighting for each item. 

2. Compare the various items on the list and 

1 e.g. item 23 on the original check list was not used 
for reasons previously given. 

2 i.e. items rated as having ’’little significance” in 
diagnosing a psychopath were not included in the final 
check list, which included 10 items rated as “very 
significant]’ and 2 items rated as ’’significant.”

attempt to bring together those items which 
appear to describe a similar characteristic and 
were rated similarly by the raters. This might 
produce a stronger item and perhaps more agree¬ 
ment on the rating of it by the psychiatrists. 

3* Send the lists back to each rater and ask him 
to force a rating on each item marked n s”; 
i.e. ask him to rate it as either ,r vs n or ”ls f J 

k* Send the check list to as many psychiatrists 
as possible. 

5. Make personal contact with each rater; i.e. 
interpret the meaning of each item to them 
all thus getting some degree of constancy in 
what each psychiatrist would be rating. 

6 . Revise the entire check list by an intense 
study of the literature and then proceed to 
distribute it to the psychiatrists for rating. 

The study appears, nevertheless, to indicate that 
the MMPI can distinguish between what has been assumed 
to represent the n psychopat hi c M and the !f non-psychopathic” 
groups in a prison setting, with a significance of better 
than the 0.7$ level of confidence on the Hy, Pd plus .4K, 
Pt plus IK and Ma plus »2K scales. However, when the 
K factor is not added, these two groups are only dis¬ 
tinguished on the Pd and Ka scales with a significance 
at better than the 0.07$ level. Group I is also

distinguished from the ’‘general” prison group (Group III) 
on the Pd and Ma scales when K is added, with a signifi¬ 
cance of better than the 0,4? level of confidence. When 
K is not added. Groups I and III are distinguished only 
by the Pd scale with a significance of better than 1%» 
Groups II and III may be segregated on the Ma scale 
when K is added, with a significance at better than the 
0.27$ level of confidence. When K is not added, the 
Hs, Pd and Ma scales differentiate the two groups with 
a level of confidence of greater than 0.5$. 

It appears that the K factor which was designed 
to aid in the discrimination of the Hs, Pd, Pt, Sc and 
Ma scales (46) does not appear to function in that manner 
at all times with all groups. In fact, it appears that 
some of the scales show improvement in their discrimana- 
tory power when K is not added (e.g. the Hs, Pd, Sc and 
Ma scales of Groups I and II; the Hs and Pd scores of 
Groups I and III; and the Hs, Pd, Pt, Sc and Ma scales 
of Groups II and III). In view of these findings, it is 
questionable whether the K scale is useful in increasing 
the differentiation power of these scales between a 
”psychopathic” and ”non-psychopathic” group, and either 
of these groups from a ”general” prison group. 

Other studies have indicated that the Pd plus K 
and Ma plus K scales were useful in determining a 
psychopathic group (24, 45)* However, these writers did

not find that the Hy and Pt plus K discriminated between 
their psychopathic and non-psychopathic groups * There 
are at least three possible hypotheses to account for 
the action of these scales as "discriminators’ 1 in this 
study and not in others: 

1* Perhaps the Regina group, which was concluded 
to be "psychopathic," is not a "pure" group 
(i.e* it may have had a strong element of 
hysteria and psychasthenic as well as psycho-* 
pathy). 

2* Perhaps the groups on which the Pd scale was 
established and standardised were not "pure" 
psychopathic groups and, as such, did not 
exhibit the hysterical and psychasthenic 
characteristics evidenced by the Regina group. 

3. The Regina group may portray characteristics 
of a psychopathic personality which were not 
previously recognized as such. That is, 
hysteria and psychasthenic may actually be 
components of a psychopathic personality 0

CHAPTER 10 

A SUMMARY OF THE ENTIRE STUDY 

1* It appears possible to establish a method whereby 
a group such as may be found within a prison, may 
be diagnosed with a check list of psychopathic 
characteristics as psychopathic or non-psychopathic» 

2. This method appears to be a relatively valuable 
too],, as it is based on unanimous psychiatric opinion 
where little convergence of psychiatric opinion 
exists• 

3. Assuming that the check list is able to separate 
a prison population into either ’’psychopathic,” 
”non-psychopathic” or ”general” prison groups, the 
MMPI appears to be a very valid test in distinguish¬ 
ing these groups from one another in at least two 
scales* 

4* The MMPI appears to distinguish the ’’psychopathic” 
from the "non-psychopathic” group on four scales, 
i.e. the Hy, Pd plus .4K, Pt plus IK, and Ma plus .2K, 
with a significance better than the 0*7$ level. 

5. The MMPI appears to distinguish the ’’psychopathic” 
group from a ’’general” prison group on two scales, 
i.e. the Pd plus .4K and the Ma plus .2K scales with 
a significance better than 0.4? level.

6. The MMPI appears to distinguish the "non-psychopathic" 
group from a "general” prison group on the Ma plus .2K 
scale with a significance at better than the 1 % level* 
When K is not added to the scales, these two groups 
are distinguished by the Hs, Ma and Pd scales at 
better than the 0.5$ level of significance* 

7* The "psychopathic" group appears to have an "abnormal" 

Pd scale much more often than the other two prison 
groups being discussed* 

The "psychopathic" group exhibits Pd-Ma type of 
"abnormal" profile much more often than does the 
"non-psycho pat hie" or "general" prison group* The 
"non-psychopathic" group exhibit no abnormal Pd-type 
of profile* 

9« The entire prison group appears to be a representa¬ 
tive prison group when compared to a similar American 
prison group. This similarity is, of course, restricted 
to the MMPI profile* 

From these results, it appears that one can segre¬ 
gate the psychopathic group from the non-psychopathie 
group in a prison setting. The definition of these 
groups will be based on the items in the final check 
lists, i.e. the psychopathic group will exhibit many 
more of these characteristics than will the non- 
psychopathic group. This segregation is possible with

the MMPI results, and further, perhaps gives an indica¬ 
tion of other characteristics which the psychopath may 
exhibit and which the non-psychopath will show an 
absence of; e.g., hysterical and psychasthenic symptoms* 

One should be very cautious about this aspect of these 
findings in that the MMPI may not measure these two 
syndromes accurately* As the MMPI is a group test and 
valuable as such, rather than an individual one, care 
must be taken in the individual interpretation, especially 
of any one scale* These results would indicate, however, 
that further work might be done along the lines of deter¬ 
mining the presence of hysterical and psychasthenic 
components in psychopaths* 

One might perhaps question the finding that the 
items in the Pd scale and those on the Ma, Pt and Hy 
are measuring a similar component in the psychopath in 
this grouping. However, in the original studies done to 
establish the Pd scales (45) no findings were exhibited 
which indicated that these other scales showed any signifi¬ 
cant correlation with the Pd scale* This might indicate 
that the Regina group differs from those used by McKinley 
and Hathaway* On the basis of this, the writer is 
inclined to believe that there is a very strong possibil¬ 
ity that McKinley and Hathaway were not working with as 
"pure" a psychopathic group as that represented in the 
present study, as a comparable group would likely show

CHAPTER 11 

USEFULNESS OF THIS STUDY 

The validation of the MMPI in detecting the 
psychopath from the non-psychopath will be very useful 
in a prison classification scheme. It has been men¬ 
tioned previously that many authorities consider the 
segregation of the psychopathic personality from the 
more amenable group in a prison is a must for any 
rehabilitation of the prisoners. The MMPI, being an 
easily administered and easily scored paper-and-pencil 
personality test, is a good instrument to use in such 
segregation. It may b© used as a screening method to 
distinguish those who may be termed psychopaths from 
those individuals who will benefit more from less 
therapeutic work with them. As time is of utmost 
importance in work of this type, the MMPI should prove 
valuable—but only for screening procedures. It is 
probably not so good a test as the Rorschach, Thematic 
Apperception Test or Wechsler-Bellevue, but seems to 
be much more economical in time than these latter 
would be for screening purposes. 

It is of interest to note that psychiatric diagno¬ 
sis of the psychopath is very confused and unco-ordinated. 
This is not a local problem, but apparently exists

throughout at least North America* The method of 
arriving at the check list used in this study might be 
valuable for continued study into this area* It might 
even prove useful in clarifying diagnostic criteria 
for the psychopathic personality.
