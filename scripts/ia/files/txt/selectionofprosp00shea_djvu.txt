CHAPTER I 


THE PROBLEM AND DEFINITIONS OF TERMS USED 
One of the best and surest means of improving the quality 
of teaching, is to admit to training only those of superior 
potential teaching capacity. 

A survey of the literature on the selection of teachers, 
indicates that several concepts have undergone marked changes 
during recent years: 

1. Instead of merely admitting students to a normal school, 
the period of selection should cover a much longer period, 
and extend from public school grades to the first few years 
as teachers-in-service• This can be done only if cumulat¬ 
ive records are kept for each student. 

2. Guidance and selection are almost inextricably related.. 
Those high-school students, gifted by nature, mrith the 
personal qualities necessary for a good teacher, should be 
guided toward the teaching profession, and those not so 
endowed should be discouraged from entering it. 

3. In a departure from a purely academic qualification, there 

now is required in Alberta an evaluation of such items as 

"attitude, personality, and special fitness for the profess- 
1 

ion of teaching". 

To be able to predict teaching success, one must know

what constitutes successful teaching. In the past, successful 
teaching has been judged on the basis of the results achieved by 
curriculum-directed teachers doing what they were told to do. 

The ability to follow instructions was the standard. We need a 
new measuring stick. The improvements that will be made in our 
measuring devices,will likely lead to a greater relationship 
between intelligence and teaching success than is found in 
correlations made by research workers to-day. There are many 
challenging problems in this field for the research student. 

I. THE PROBLEM 

Statement of the problem . It was the purpose of this 
study (l) to investigate the factors that constitute good teach¬ 
ing, as interpreted by a group of trained and experienced critic 
teachers in classrooms in Alberta; (2) to examine these factors 
critically, in the light of current literature in the field of 
supervision, and to select those factors that seemed pertinent 
from the evidence submitted; and (3) to discover, if possible, 
through research and by inspection of existing theories and 
practices, a workable technique for the selection of teachers- 
in-training for the normal schools of Alberta. 

This research v>ras pursued after the writer had accepted 
the hypothesis that the most desirable plan of selection is the 
one which will produce the greatest good for the greatest number 
of persons. Injustices must be reduced to a minimum by refine¬ 
ment of the instruments of selection. 

In our schools to-day, the teacher ! s role is ever increas¬ 
ing in importance. From being a mere imparter of knowledge, the 
teacher is now taking over, at least in part, many of the funct-

ions formerly ascribed to the home and to the church, namely, 
the development of character and of personality. The new slogan 
is, T, The whole child goes to school”. The teacher ! s task appears 
to be to develop in the pupils a sound philosophy of life based 

on life-like experiences. 

1 

In a recent book, Jesse H. Newlon states that the concept¬ 
ion of education as experience is the only conception suited to 
democracy. This writer places the responsibility on teachers 
for formulating the kind of society America should have in the 
near future. He agrees with George S. Counts, that once decided 
upon, teachers should establish such a society, on a small scale, 
in the classrooms, and the children, having lived in this school¬ 
room society, will go out into the bigger society of life and 
demand that adults remodel their living to correspond with the 
teacher-devised society. Teacher education must prepare the 
teachers to make such a choice. High entrance requirements, at 
least the M.A. degree , should be demanded as qualification for 
admission to the profession. Education must be redirected and 
refashioned, in order that it may effectively serve democracy in 
the new social order that is emerging, and that it may become a 

constructive force in determining the shape of this new society. 

2 

Ordway Tead expresses similar thoughts. A democracy 
works well only when it is well led. The whole possibility of a 
new type of democracy rests on adequate leadership.

There is some evidence that the intelligence of high 
school graduates aspiring to teacher-training, is inferior to 
that of students preparing to enter other professions. The 
following quotation is significant: 

"The Survey Committee experimented by using the Otis 
Self-Administering Test of Mental Ability, Higher Examination, 

Form B, this being given to the students of the School for 
Teachers at MacDonald College and to a number of first-year 
students at McGill, and also to a comparable group in two normal 
schools in another province. The results showed that the students 
of the first year at McGill had an average intelligence 7% above 
the intelligence of the MacDonald College group." 

The following conclusion is important when one considers 
the implications: "Out of 104 (admitted to the School for Teachers 
at MacDonald College) nearly 25% could not reasonably expect to 
succeed as teachers." 


Evidence from Alberta would indicate that our entrance 
standards are falling in a steady decline: 

1. Candidates who sought admission to normal schools in 
Alberta in September, 1938, were admitted in the order of 
rank of their average standing on the Grade XII examinat¬ 
ions from the highest down. Ho candidate was admitted 
whose average standing was lower than 57%. 

2. In order to secure the required number of teachers to 
staff the schools of Alberta in September, 1939, and again 
in September, 1940, the average was as low as 50%. 

3. Among the requirements for admission found on page 4 of 
the Alberta Normal Schools Announcement, 1940-41, is this 
statement: "It must further be understood that all students 

. must write on the two additional examinations, 

viz: (l) a General Test, and (2) a Survey Test in Mathemat-

ics and Science". These two tests were written in June, 

1940, The results were very unsatisfactory. The scores 
were so low that they were disregarded as admission stand¬ 
ards, The highest possible score w r as 210; the lowest score 
made was 70. The Upper Quartile score was 162, the Median 
score was 140, and the Lower Quartile score was 129, These 
examinations were intended to be a test of a sound high 
school education . 

4. By strict adherence to the entrance requirements, as stated 
in the Announcement, 1940-41, 250 candidates 'were obtained. 

In order to obtain the required replacements for our schools 
in Alberta, 520 in all, these entrance requirements were 
lowered and stopped just short of admitting students without 
full Grade XII standing, 

5. At the beginning of the school year, a battery of tests 
is given to all applicants to teacher-training in Alberta. 
These tests include vocabulary, spelling, good usage, sentence 
structure, reading, arithmetic reasoning and arithmetic 
accuracy, and a test in intelligence. Comparable results 

for the Thurstone Psychological Examination tend to point to 
a decline in general ability over a three-year period. This 
decline is shown in Table I, page 6. The results from these 
tests reveal that high-school standards in "good usage", 
"sentence structure", and "arithmetic reasoning" are actually 
declining.

^This number is obviously inaccurate. 


It is interesting to note a slight difference in favor of 
the Calgary group. Raw scores only are available for the Thurstone 
Psychological Examination for 1940. These scores are not compar¬ 
able. The median score for Edmonton and Calgary combined was 115.4 
the mean score was 114.09. The median score on the same test, the 
Thurstone Psychological Examination for 1940, for the first-year 
students at the University of Alberta, September, 1940, was 109. 
Comparing the Edmonton and Calgary scores for September, 1940: 
Edmonton Median 111.7 Mean 111.6 

Calgary Median 115.9 Mean 116.47 

This difference between the Edmonton and Calgary scores on 
the Psychological Examination,is accepted as a fact and is inter¬ 
preted on the basis of the larger proportion of students in the 
Edmonton Normal School from foreign homes, with a resulting diffic¬ 
ulty with the English language. It is difficult to interpret the 
fact that these students in Edmonton are also decidedly lower than

the Calgary students in arithmetic reasoning and in arithmetic 
computation. 

The lack of balance between demand and supply; the economic 
stress of our period; the introduction of a curriculum based on 
the pragmatic philosophy of progressive education; and the smaller 
number of teachers required in Alberta, due to the more economical 
placing of our schools in the larger unit, have created a demand 
for fewer, but better trained teachers. The problem is further 
complicated by the very superficial one-year system of preparation 
for teachers found in Alberta, and in the fact that practice in 
teaching is given chiefly in graded urban schools to student- 
teachers who will spend at least their first professional years in 
one-roomed ungraded rural schools. 

II. DEFINITION OF TERMS 

High school pupil . Throughout this thesis, the term shall 
be taken to include students in Grade X, Grade XI, and Grade XII, 
but will apply chiefly to students in Grade XII. 

Teacher. This term is to be interpreted as describing 
teachers in elementary schools and will include teachers in high 
schools and in private schools only when specifically stated. 

Student teacher . By this term is designated teachers-in- 
training in normal schools in Alberta and in teacher-training 
institutions elsewhere. 

Intelligence . This term is very loosely used in the 
literature found in educational books and magazines. Peter 
Sandiford says: 

T! Ask a dozen psychologists for a definition of the word 
and one gets a dozen different answrers. Thorndike defined it as

the power of good responses from the point of view of truth or 
fact; Terman as the ability to carry on abstract thinking; Colvin 
as the ability to adjust to environment; Pintner as the ability to 
adapt to relatively new situations in life; Henmon as intellect 
plus knowledge; Woodrow as an acquiring capacity; Dearborn as the 

capacity to learn or profit from experience; . the 

following seem to be the commonest features: (l) the ability to 
adapt oneself to novel situations; (2) the ability to carry on the 
higher processes of thought, especially abstract thinking; and (5) 
the ability to learn.” 1 

The Thurstone Psychological Examination given in the pre¬ 
liminary tests in Alberta, is based on the Two-Factor Theory 
propounded by Spearman. This theory, as applied to the results 
of intelligence tests, is that the scores obtained on any test, 
are made up of a general factor, ”g”, which is common to all 
intelectual activity, and a specific factor, "s", which appears in 
the particular activity tested. In studying teacher traits, the 
common factor, "g”, may represent general teaching ability, or it 

may simply be the result of the spread of general estimate, or 
2 

the halo effect.

CHAPTER II 


WHAT FACTORS CONSTITUTE GOOD TEACHING? 

In an attempt to discover what nine teachers in the 
Practice School of the Calgary Normal School considered to he 
good teaching, the writer asked each teacher to prepare a state¬ 
ment of the factors that entered into the grading of a lesson 
taught hy a student-teacher. The following is a compilation of 
these replies, arranged as they would appear on the criticism 
form supplied to these teachers: 

Factors which make for good lessons- 

1. Teacher 1 s voice - well modulated; stimulating tone; good 
carrying power; clear; pleasant; not too loud or strident; 
sympathetic yet convincing. 

2. Teacher T s manner - confident (in self and in material to be 
taught); business-like; forceful; alert; energetic; interested. 

5. Ability to control - co-operative spirit that removes most 
disciplinary problems; natural (without apparent effort); 
control depends on preparation of subject matter and on the 
ability to question. 

4. Teacher* s language - fluent; careful; grammatical vocabulary 
within class comprehension; to the point. 

5. Lesson Plan - well organized content; plenty of subject matter 
much material listed, for motivation with suggestions for 
displaying same; suitable variety; continuity in selection of 
material; planned for class-activity rather than for teacher- 
activity. 

6. Class - 

Tal Interest - natural; free; active; aroused and sustained. 

(b) Participation - active; thoughtful; interested; spontan¬ 
eous response; pupils try to express themselves well, 

(c) Discipline - natural; diplomatic; effective; obtained 
through co-operation (regulated by pupil participation); 
a feeling of informality yet without rudeness; discipline 
is seldom a problem if the work is interesting and well 
planned.

7. Method- 

(aV Introduction - adequate basis for the new lesson; 

interesting and arresting; formal introductions do not 
stimulate; lengthy or artificial introductions are a 
waste of time; establish a feeling of confidence between 
pupil and teacher. 

(b) Presentation - logical; interesting; clear-cut; con¬ 
ducted with dispatch; development in orderly sequence 
with the aid of the pupils; related the new to the old; 
suitable use of teacher aids, as blackboard, diagrams, 
and instruments. 

(c) Questioning - based on pupil f s answers; avoids leading 
questions; stimulates a logical line of thought or 
reasoning; definite; arouses general class participation; 
in good English; avoids "What about this?", "Who can 

tell me that?"; name of pupil last; distributed judiciously 
among the pupils. 

(d) Supervision - continuous supervision of speech, of 
posture, of attention, of effort; looks for growth and 
progress; knowledge of the desired attainment is necessary 
to good supervision; constructive criticism; recognition 
of individual difficulties; as an aid to further teaching. 

(e) Blackboard - used to good advantage; neat and clear work; 
careful planning; logical development; an aid in teaching 
and in maintaining pupil activity; for review. 

(f) Materials - authentic; suitable to the assignment; 
command of subject matter; material handled skilfully. 

(g) Drill and application - tests knowledge of content 
and application of principles; remedial and diagnostic 
in scope; drill in its natural setting; interesting and 
challenging; maintains pupil activity; exercises varied 
to avoid monotony; properly graded. 

(h) Conclusion - sustained interest; objectives of the 
lesson attained; check-up (oral or written to discover 
whether the vital facts of the presentation are under¬ 
stood and will be available to be of further use to the 
child); leaves the child w T ith a feeling of accomplishment 
and a desire and ability to go forward. 

Comments worth quoting: 

Mr. Russell- "Ability to recognize in everyday life, 
applications of both scientific and mathematical principles 
learned from texts." 

Mr. Russell- "Ability to recognize a problem solving 
situation and to present the situation to the class as a 
problem." 


Mr. Russell- "Many students have mentioned that they were 
frightened by the possibility of pupils asking questions that they 
(the student-teachers) would be unable to answer. Such lack of 
confidence and its resultant nervousness, paralyzes the ability 
of the student to take advantage of pupil contributions from the

fear that they may be led from the exactly fixed line of proced¬ 
ure that they have planned. This discourages pupil participation 
and precludes the possibility of enrichment of the lesson by 
interesting sidelights suggested by pupil experiences," 

Miss E. Avis- "I am always favorably impressed by a 
personality that convinces one of the student T s desire to be a 
teacher- a liking for his job, a genuine interest in the children, 
a willingness to be one of the group rather than a taskmaster.” 

Miss E. Avis- "Discipline is seldom a problem if the 
work is interesting and well planned, but one does expect a student 
to shoulder some of the responsibility of training children to co¬ 
operate, to control enthusiasm, to be mannerly.” 

Miss E. Avis- "Children do more independent thinking if 
called upon to make statements instead of answering questions 
constantly." 


Mrs. G. Christie- "Overquestioning often ruins a lesson." 

Mrs. G. Christie- "Discipline problems are sometimes 
created through inexperienced teachers trying to use too much 
material." 

In an attempt to see how student-teachers measured up to 
these standards, the writer prepared a psychograph of the pract¬ 
ice teaching results for the year 1938-39, in the Calgary Normal 
School. The results are listed in Table II on page 12. The 
findings are placed in tabular form rather than in profile. 

Average marks are given in each case. The possible mark for 
any student-teacher to make on a lesson was 95. 

From these marks an average mark of 63.01 for 12 lessons 
was obtained. These results were based on subjective judgment 
alone. All such judgments have doubtful reliability. No rating 
scales were used. The nature of the set-up in the practice school 
made it impossible to measure improvement in the pupils by means 
of standard tests. 

The writer reviewed available literature on the topic of 
teacher training and teacher rating, in an attempt to discover

The Commonwealth Teacher .Training Study adopted the job-

means were suggested for measuring the amount of a trait possessed 

1 

by a given teacher. 

L. J. Brueckner, of the University of Minnesota, advocates 
the stop-watch technique. Discover and list those things that 
good teachers do. Use a stop-watch and discover how long a good 
teacher does a certain thing. Classify class performance in order 
of importance, and you get a picture of a good teacher in action. 

Dr. F. B. Knights produces the following formula for succ¬ 
essful teaching: 

150 S.T. - 20 P.I. + 5 S.I.-f- 20 A.P.L.-*-10 E.T.-f-25 F.F. f- 20 P.R. 

-f 15 A.W.G.-f-15 E.G.C.f- SOX. 

S.T. - successful teaching. 

P.I. - pupil information. 

S.I. - subject-matter information. 

A.P.L. - adequate psychology of learning. 

E. T. - effective tools. 

F. F. - feeling formula shov^ing itself in waves of resistance and 

transfer between teacher and pupils. 

P.R. - psychiatric respectability, or a total of school practice 
which will help to integrate the child T s personality. 

A.W.G. - appreciation of worthy goals which appear worthy in the 
child ! s eyes. 

E.G.C. - enlightened general condition which gives efficiency 
and comfort.

5 units to knowledge of subjects, and 25 units to the feeling

elements of the feeling formula, yet these elements are consid¬ 
ered to be very important. The teacher must create the waves of 
transference. When the waves of resistance become numerous, then 
the most promising teacher fails of success. 

Dean Haggerty urges the necessity of evaluating the teacher- 
pupil relationship in order to get a true picture of successful 
teaching. 

Some attempts have been made to grade the teacher on the 
basis of measurable changes produced in the pupils. These changes 
are measured (?) by means of a number of tests chosen with reference 
to the objectives of the course. Conclusions vary as to the reliab¬ 
ility of these results. 

L. H. Mathews, working on the problem of the measurement of 

teaching ability under Dr. A. S. Barr of the University of 

Wisconsin, concludes that such measurements can be made but there 

2 

is a real need for existing measures to be studied and refined.

CHAPTER III 


WHAT CONSTITUTES A MODERN SCHOOL? 

"As is the teacher, so is the school; 

As is the school, so the teacher must he." 

A good starting point in the study of a modern school is 
to state the function of the school. In Alberta, the school is 
not regarded as an instrument for political propaganda, as it is 
in Soviet Russia, Fascist Italy, or in Nazi Germany. The school 
is a social institution, the servant of its supporters. The 
institution exists during its usefulness. The schools must sustain 
and support the society that supports them. 

Dr. B. F. Pettinger gives us a brief description of what 
constitutes a modern school:'*' 

1. "The modern school is child-centered. Teachers should be 
specialists in child nature. 

2. "The modern school is concerned with individuals. The child 
is regarded as an organism whose education is a matter of 
active acquirement and growth. 

3. "The modern school recognizes both cultural and vocational 
objectives. If education is for life, and life includes work, 
one objective of the school must be education for vocation; 
but also for making a life. Vocationalism has two aspects: 

(l) guidance, and (g) vocational training or preparation. 
Cultural objectives are sought through "general education". 

4. "The modern school is concerned with social training. The 
school must recognize the rights of citizens and the duty of 
government, but it must also recognize the duties of citizens 
and the rights of governments. 

In 1935 the Province of Alberta accepted the theories laid 
down by the Progressive Educational Association, and built a 
curriculum based on the activity concept of learning through

doing. In 1940, a revision of the Elementary School Programme 
of Studies accepts and outlines an "Integrated Programme 11 for 
grades 1 to 6, in all hut the skill subjects. 

Speaking in eastern Canada during the fall of 1940, Dr. 

G. F. McNally, Deputy Minister of Education for Alberta, was quoted 
as having told an audience that the schools are now shouldering 
much that was formerly looked upon as the responsibility of the 
home and of the church. In this respect the following quotation 
is interesting: 

"Schools have stepped forward to assume the educational 
burden of a failing institution. Thus the colonial home was 
ideal for teaching the boy to farm, or the girl to run a house, 
and both received their standards of manners from their parents. 

Now the home has declined; so farming, homemaking, and manners 
are taught in school. Character and religious education are 
taught by schools to supplement a weakened church; vocational 
education in school to replace apprenticeship. ? In fact*, said a 
wag in the Atlantic Monthly, f all the home now has to do is to 
teach reading, writing and arithmetic*. !1 1 

Shifts in educational thinking have been marked by a series 
of rapidly changing emphases and catchwords: project method, 
creative education, integration, creative activity. Each of these 
emphases has left a strong impress upon school practices. Plans 
for taking care of individual differences among children, have 
been elevated into systems by those who formulated them. These 
plans are based on acceleration or on enrichment of content. 

The Pueblo Plan was the idea of Preston W. Search, Superintend¬ 
ent of Schools, Colorado, from 1888-94. The Batavia Plan origin¬ 
ated in Batavia, New, York, in 1888 and continued with marked 
success until 1907. It had the endorsement of William Bagley, as 
the best compromise of the individual method and the class plan.

To allow the child to progress at his own rate, Dr. C. 
Washburn has established what is known as the ”Winnetka Plan or 
Technique” with its world-famous slogan, ”A child never fails in 
Winnetka”. For a similar purpose the Dalton Plan has been widely 
used. 

Henry C. Morrison of the University of Chicago, is respon¬ 
sible for the enrichment scheme known as the Unit Mastery Plan 
built from Herbert*s five formal steps of learning. 

Several multiple track plans have emerged, as: the St. 
Louis Plan, the North Denver Plan, the Baltimore Plan, the 
Cambridge Plan, the Elizabethan Plan, the Torgenson Plan. Paul 
R. Mort, Teachers College, Columbia University, says that thirty- 
six of forty American cities of 100,000 or more population used 
some form of ability grouping in 1926; sixty-six of the ninety 
cities between 30,000 and 100,000 people, and one hundred forty- 
five smaller places of 10,000 to 30,000 people also had some type 
of grouping. ^

CHAPTER IV 


WHAT KIND OF PERSON SHOULD A BEGINNING TEACHER BE? 

"The prevailing concept of the school and its functions 
indicate the types of personalities who should be selected to 
teach and the kind of equipment that should be given them,- a 
socially intelligent and enlightened person who has both a 
scientific and a human understanding of children and who is demoted 
emotionally and intellectually to the democratic way of life." 

In The School magazine there has appeared a series of artic¬ 
les under the caption, "What I Like to See in a Teacher" by 
"Your Inspector". These articles started in September, 1940, and 
concluded in February, 1941. A number of school inspectors, 
fifty-six in all, in Ontario, were asked what they liked to see 
most in a teacher. The following summarizes the answers: 

1. Understanding - insight into children ! s minds. 

2. Pleasing personality - inspires the trust and affection 
of the pupils. 

5. Energy - alert; interested; enthusiastic; industrious. 

4. Conscientious devotion to duty. 

5. Neat in person (not expensively dressed). 

6. Original - uses good ideas with the imprint of her own 
personality. 

7. A saving sense of humor. 

8. Supervision - absence of nagging; firm but kindly; a 
student of psychology; a guide and helper rather than a 
dictator. 

9. Pleasing, effective blackboard work. 

10. A good citizen - applies the Golden Rule; teaches children 
to use freedom wisely. 

11. A relaxed voice - soft; properly trained. 

12. Self-control - patient; does not show annoyance at small 
untoward events that occur through the day.

preferred); enthusiasm for beauty (music, art, literature, 
or nature).

31. A good housekeeper. 

32. Hear all classes four times per day. 

33. An aptitude for teaching. 

34. One who has many contacts with life. 

Concluding this series. Dr. Henry Bowers gives a descript- 
of a Composite Best Teacher and of a Composite Worst Teacher, 
derived from data obtained from fifty-one critic teachers, 
inspectors, and normal school masters, on a 16-point scale. He 
concludes: T, In general, the Composite Worst Teacher has qualities 
slightly below those of the ’man in the street 1 ; the Composite 
Best Teacher is very little lower than the angels". 

One can find all shades of opinions listed here, a 
study of these opinions will show how impossible it is to get 
much correlation between practice teaching results in our normal 
schools and results as found on inspector’s reports on teachers- 
in-service. The Department of Educational Research of the 
University of Toronto, in 1935, examined the records of stud.ents 
who graduated from the Ontario College of Education during the 
ten-year period, 1921-30. Three methods of rating with a high 
degree of reliability were used. The following conclusions were 
reached: 

"Teaching success has a low correlation with marks obtained 
in the Ontario College of Education. Every correlation with 
teaching success calculated was below .20 except that for practice 
teaching, which was .377."^

’’Practice-teaching marks have some value in predicting 
success or failure in the field.’ 1 

We are living in a period of transition. From the teacher- 
centered school to the child-centered school; from the ”well- 
disciplined” school to the school where ’’freedom” is practised; 
from subject-matter divisions to integrated programmes; from 
subject-matter specialists to enterprise procedures. These 
represent but a few of the changes in our school set-up to-day. 

J. 0. Carlyle, Ontario College of Education, has some 
pertinent things to say about our teacher-training system. Every 
practice lesson taught, he claims, is a ’’stunt” performed before 
an audience. ’’That many teachers-in-training did grow and gain 
considerable skill is an argument, not for the system,but for the 
fine old doctrine of predestination and election; they were born 

i 

teachers”. If we accept this viewr, then our task becomes one of 
selection from those possessing certain qualities, rather than 
from those attaining definite academic standards. 

Many new books, and numerous magazine articles, are being 

written to-day concerning education and democracy. To education 

must fall the task of making the democratic spirit prevail. It 
2 

is claimed that this spirit of democracy is just the Golden Rule 
in simple, straightforward action. The basic problem is, simply 
and completely, the problem of modifying human behavior by the 
method of education. The world is in the midst of rapid, social 
change. The teacher needs a rich and realistic insight into the

1936, pp. 830-33.

social forces influencing her community, if the school is going to 
assume the role of community and regional improvement. 

In "Teachers for Democracy" we are told that, "...now, if 
never before, our schools need teachers imbued with the spirit 
of democracy and capable of leading their classes in penetrating 
study of world events". 

This book ^ goes on to enumerate some of the qualities re¬ 
quired in a teacher for democracy: 

1. She must be capable to guide pupils in securing data which 
often are not available in conventional instructional material. 

2. She must possess a sense of human engineering that can avoid 
unnecessary conflict or deal effectively with such conflicts 

as might arise. Harmony must be an outstanding attribute of the 
vast majority of community-centered school activities. 

3. She must be capable of special strategy in relation to the 
role of teachers in respect to social change. The part that 
teachers and schools may play is almost certain to be the source 
of considerable controversy. No branch of teaching is exempt 
from the repercussions of political and economic change. 

The writer believes that before teachers, as a body, can 
greatly influence public opinion, there must be a general rise 
in the level of public esteem. First steps have already been taken 
in this matter in Alberta, when the Teaching Profession Act was 
passed in 1935. This act made membership in the A.T.A. a pre¬ 
requisite to a teaching position. The presence of several ex-

teachers among our M.P. and M.P.P. legislators in Canada, attest 
to a rise in social esteem. Economic recompense for the entire 
profession must be the next step. When such an objective has 
been reached, it will be possible to entice into the teaching 
profession, many excellent prospects who now enter other pro¬ 
fessions. 

Neal Billings ^ states that three principles should guide 
the democratic society in the selection of its teachers: 

1. Tl Insofar as is consistent with the total welfare of all, an 
individual should have freedom for intelligent choice of 

his own occupation. 

2. t? Society has not only the right, but also the duty, to set 
up qualifications which must be met by entrants into occupat¬ 
ions in order that the total welfare of all may be served. 

3. ,! If the number of qualified applicants is less than the 
number needed by society, then society must modify the 
incentives in order to increase entrants into the profession.

CHAPTER V 


ARE ACADEMIC STANDARDS SIGNIFICANT IN PREDICTING SUCCESS 
IN ACADEMIC RESULTS IN NORMAL SCHOOL? 

Eric J. Dunn, while doing research for an M.A. Thesis in 
in 1939, concluded that the mean or average intelligence of the 
freshman class at the University of British Columbia was above 122. 
This indicates that the university is drawing its students from 
the top 5$ of the population. He states that the British Columbia 
School Survey showed that the average intelligence quotient of the 
teacher-training class was 137.2. The name of the test used to 
measure intelligence, was not given in this article. 1 This 
difference was borne out by results of the Thurstone Psychological 
Examination in Alberta, September, 1940. The median in the 
University of Alberta for freshmen (really 2nd year) was 109. 
while on the same examination, for normal students the median was 
113.4, an increase of 4.4 test points. Yet Mr. Dunn concludes 
that the Junior Matriculation examinations, on the whole, were not 
as good an instrument for predicting freshman success as was the 
high-school principals estimate alone. 

In September, 1937, Alberta inaugerated what was hoped 
would be a higher selection of student-teachers. Only those stud¬ 
ents with full Grade XII standing were admitted to training. In 
September, 1939, only those students making 57$ and up on the 

Departmental Examinations, were admitted. Table III on page 25

Normal School on a battery of preliminary tests in September, 
1938, and in September, 1939. The mean score is given for

The "critical ratio" shows the relative significance of 


the differences of the means. Obviously the greater the spread 
of a distribution, the less a given difference in the mean will 
signify. The rise or fall of the score in Sentence Structure is 
of more significance than the same rise or fall of the score on 
the Thurstone test, with a spread five or six times as great. 

The results were disappointing. It was expected that a random 
sample of the total Grade XII graduating class, making 57^ and 
up on the Departmental Examinations, would show a higher average

26 


grade of "intelligence’’ than a similar sample in 1938 making 50$ 
and up. 

To lead to dependable conclusions, the critical ratio 
should be greater than 4; otherwise results may be due to chance 
fluctuations. Theoretically, if the standing of the whole grad¬ 
uating group in these subjects (functions) in 1939 w T as as good 
as in 1938, the new factor introduced in raising the pass mark 
for entrance, should have led to increases in the means to yield 
a ’’critical ratio’’ greater than 4 in all cases. A glance at 
Table III shows that the total graduating class in 1939 was not 
as good in these functions as that of 1958. 1 

Evidence that high school standards in these skills may 
be declining, is found in the results of the preliminary tests for 
1937 and 1938 in the Calgary Normal School. In all cases 1938 
showed a decline as compared with 1937. In no case was the 
’’critical ratio” greater than 4. The uniformity of the downward 
trend through 1937, 1938, 1939, and 1940 suggests that high 
school standards in these functions may be declining. The fact 
that we reverted in 1940 to the 1938 standard of a 50$ average, 
coupled with a broad or liberal interpretation of prerequisite 
courses, makes any comparison of the 1959 and 1940 marks difficult 
to make with any degree of accuracy. 

In 1939 a research in weighting the preliminary tests in 
the normal schools of Alberta, was made by Dr. C. Sansom assisted 
by Mr. A. L. Doucette. On the basis of these tests, the applicants

in both schools, Edmonton and Calgary, were ranked from highest 
to lowest. Table IV shows the mean scores for the preliminary 
tests, September, 1939, in which were used "raw” and assigned 
weightings. The weightings were assigned by Dr. H. C. Newland 
and the research was made to discover if the effort and time 
devoted to weighting these marks was worthwhile.

It must be noted that each test has a "weight” of its 
own to begin with. This weight depends upon several factors, 
such.as the total possible score, and the degree of difficulty 
of the test for the group taking it. When we assign a weight

to a test we really substitute one weight for another. From this 
study it was concluded that n weighting” made remarkably little 
difference in the percentile ranking of the students. As a carry¬ 
over from this research, the students writing the preliminary tests 

in September, 1940, were ranked on the basis of raw scores.

In the statistics listed here, it has been shown that if the 
basis of notifying students that they are not likely to succeed in 
normal school, were shifted from weighted scores to raw scores, the 
names of students A and N would have to be substituted for the 
names of students S and T. The other sixteen cases would remain 
the same. 

After such a study / one would hesitate to place greater stress 
on the results of the Grade XII Departmental Examinations as a 
selecting agency, even if the various subjects were "weighted" to 
place greater stress on "basic" requirements. 

That weighting made remarkedly little difference in the 
percentile ranking of the students, was indicated for the group 
as a whole in a correlation chart. The coefficient of correlation 
of total raw scores against total weighted scores worked out at 
.97. With such a high correlation it is possible to make 
individual prediction from "raw" scores to "weighted" scores with 
a high degree of reliability.

A study was made in the Calgary Normal School of the 
prognostic value of the total scores on the preliminary tests in 
1938. These scores were correlated with the academic standing of 
the student-teachers for the term 1938-39. A correlation coeffic¬ 
ient of .58^.05 was obtained. This correlation was not high 
enough to make it possible to make individual prediction from 
preliminary tests to academic standing at the close of one school- 
year with any degree of reliability. 

Similar results were obtained by the English Committee of 
the International Institute Examinations Inquiry. The records of 
a group of students entering a Scottish university in the autumn 
of 1928 were studied in relation to their subsequent university 
records. The following conclusions w r ere reached: 

"On the 'whole, the correlations arrived at were small, 
although students obtaining high marks in the entrance examinat¬ 
ions did tend to obtain high marks while at the university, the 
tendency was not marked enough to make the entrance examination an 
accurate basis for predicting subsequent academic success." -*■

CHAPTER VI 


ARE ACADEMIC STANDARDS SIGNIFICANT IN PREDICTING 
SUCCESS IN PRACTICE TEACHING? 

The experience in the Calgary Normal School has been that 
it is futile to try to predict final practice teaching scores from 
the results of the preliminary tests. In the 1938-39 session, the 
total scores on the preliminary tests were correlated with the mean 
practice teaching results. The correlation coefficient obtained of 
.25^.04 was far below the .90 correlation coefficient usually taken 
to be the minimum necessary for individual prediction. Further 
tabulations were made and a probable error (P.E.) of prediction of 
2.7 was obtained in predicting average practice teaching marks from 
preliminary scores. The P.E. of practice teaching marks themselves 
was only 2.8. To predict practice teaching success from preliminary 
marks, according to this study, is only the merest trifle better 
than pure guessing. 

Table VI and Table VII show comparisons between the per¬ 
centile rank of the student on the preliminary tests in the Calgary 
Normal School, 1938-39, and his standing in practice teaching. 

From the data in Table VI it is noted that in the preliminary tests 
students J and M were so low as to merit a "warning" being given to 
them that they might not succeed in obtaining a certificate to 
teach, yet, in practice teaching they received honorable mention. 
From the data in Table VII it is noted that if the six students 
lowest in the preliminary tests had been denied normal school 
entrance, the school would have excluded five who did better in

practice teaching than twenty-eight others who would have been 
retained. The student lowest in the preliminary tests made an 
average score of 66 in practice teaching. The average for the whole 
class was 63.4. The third highest in the preliminary tests made 
only 58 in practice teaching; only thirteen made lower.

Table IX on page 35 shows the distribution of 14 students 
who ranked lowest in practice teaching in the Calgary Normal School 
in 1939-40. The intervals indicate the standing of these same 
students on the preliminary tests in September, 1939. 

Preliminary tests were given to all applicants to normal 
schools in Alberta in .September, 1940. On February 27, 1941, Dr. 
Lord, Principal of the Edmonton Normal School wrote the following 
statement to Mr. Swift, Principal of the Calgary Normal School, 
regarding these tests: 

iti n a system that has an abundance of candidates, where 
only really good students are retained, these preliminary tests

would have strong prognostic value for the purpose of exclusion 
or failure, hut in a system, such as ours, where only 5 % are 
failed, the prognostic value is far too uncertain to serve as 
any basis of exclusion or ratio for regulation of the number 
of failures. In other words, while few if any of the low 20 will 
ever make more than fair standings on professional work, they 
will not, after discussion of their low standings , be the lowest 
on the Normal School lists except in a few cases. 

My view is that these tests are not discriminative as to 
individuals.”

doubtful 

On receipt of this letter from Dr. Lord, Mr, Swift made a 
parallel study of the low 20 students on the preliminary tests 
in the Calgary Normal School, His findings were very similar to 
those of Dr. Lord. 

The experience of the Calgary Normal School has been that 
many students who achieved the upper quartile in practice teaching, 
would have been lost to the teaching profession had we sent home the 
low- 10 % 9 or even the low b% of these applicants on the basis of 
the marks they made on the preliminary tests. 

The foregoing study shows that in trying to decide in 
advance who wall make good teachers, as determined by practice teach¬ 
ing results, the preliminary tests are practically, if not entir¬ 
ely useless.

CHAPTER VII 


DOES INTELLIGENCE CORRELATE HIGHLY 
WITH TEACHING SUCCESS? 

Psychological tests are designed to measure the rate and 
level at which one may work, provided he puts forth his best 
effort. They are not designed to measure one’s industry or one’s 
traits of character. 

A study was made in the Calgary Normal School of the marks 
made by the 1938-39 class on the Thurstone Psychological Examinat¬ 
ion and the mean practice teaching results. When the practice 
teaching results were correlated with the Thurstone scores, a 
correlation coefficient of .18‘t.04 was obtained. Here the 
coefficient of .18 is barely more than four times the probable 
error (P.E.) of .04 which is necessary to give the result any 
significance at all. 

In a study of this kind, the reliability of practice 
teaching marks must be considered. We must assume that these marks 
are based on the accepted criterion of teaching ability. In a 
memorandum on these preliminary tests Dr. C. Sansom says: T, But 
the inner consistency (reliability) of these marks is so notorious¬ 
ly low (very little above zero), that the assumption that they 
have any worth-while validity as a criterion of that complex of 
attributes and qualities 'which characterize a good teacher is 
almost wholly gratuitous. It is possible that the preliminary 
results give a better forecast of ultimate teaching success than the 
practice teaching results”.

This uncertainty is found in all phases of a study on 
gradings where individuals are called upon to make subjective

It may be that we use the wrong measuring stick when we 
grade performance. Many educators claim that teaching should be 
judged on the basis of the extent to which pupils learn what they 

are expected to learn. William Clark Trow says: ".the 

successful teacher is the one whose pupils learn most of what 
they are expected to learn. It therefore makes no difference 
whether he got B f s or C ! s in college, whether he scores one 
hundred thirty-one or one hundred thirty-two on the X Intellig¬ 
ence examination, or whether his appearance is excellent or 
average. When the teachers are found whose pupils show the 
greatest improvement in performance, then it is time to study these 
teachers for their common characteristics, if any, to determine 
the nature of the successful teacher". ^ 

Nearly all available evidence on the relationship of 

intelligence to teaching success indicates low coefficients of 

2 

correlation. In this article William Clark Trow quotes 
several correlations of teaching success with scholarship, 
intelligence, and practice teaching. In all cases coefficients 
are obtained w r hich mean nothing at all. 

The most searching research that has been carried out in 
Canada, was started in the University of Toronto in the autumn 
of 1934, by the Department of Educational Research. The first 
study dealt with teaching ability. Two of tie findings are 
significant here:

1. Ability of students in teaching is not closely related to 
intelligence above that necessary for college graduation. 

2• Improvement during the period of training is not closely 
related to intelligence as measured by group tests.^ 

In an attempt to discover the meaning of tie expression, 

11 ...intelligence above that necessary for college graduation”, 

the writer read an article by Arthur E. Traxler of the Educational 

2 

Records Bureau, New York City. The American Council Psychological 
Examination does not yield an I.Q. directly. In response to 
requests from its member schools, the Educational Records Bureau 
has developed a procedure for deriving an I.Q. from this test 
indirectly through equating the total scores on the Otis Self- 
Administering Test of Mental Ability, and then applying 0tis*s 
procedure for finding an I.Q. to the derived Otis scores. 

On the assumption that the chronological age of college 
freshmen is 17 years 6 months, or more, scores on the 1937 edition 
of the Psychological Examination were changed to Otis equivalent 
raw scores, and then translated into Otis I.Q. ! s . For the whole 
group of 68,899 students in 323 colleges, the median and first and 
third quartiles for the Otis equated I.Q. ! s are as follows: 

Q 3 , 117; Median, 109; Q-j_, 101. This would indicate that a student 
with an I.Q. of less than ICO T,vould have little chance for college 
graduation.

Herbert Sorenson reports a study of ninety-nine teachers."*' 
Intelligence was measured by the Detroit Advanced Intelligence 
Examination; teaching success was determined by the principal’s 
rating or estimation. Correlations of .034 -.066 and .023^.066 
were obtained between intelligence and teaching success. Sorenson 
lists two distinct reasons why low correlations were obtained: 

1. These teachers were well selected educationally and intellect¬ 
ually; not had I.Q.’s below 110. Intelligence ceased to 

be a limiting factor. A restricted range of, say, I.Q. 110 
to I.Q. 130, reduces the correlation of factors which exist 
in definite relationship when the complete ranges of these 
abilities are involved in the correlation. 

2. The unknown reliability and validity of estimated teacher- 
success. 

3. An added reason is the nature of the traits rated. 

p 

A recent research has been made to discover if exper¬ 
ience is a factor in deviation from expectancy. A comparison 
was made of the scores of those freshmen w T ho had no previous 
experience in taking objective tests, with the scores of those 
who had taken one or more such tests previously. The tests used 
were the Carnegie Mental Ability Test, Form A and the Schrammel- 
Bramer Revision of the Army Alpha Examination. The following 
conclusions were reached:

1. "The scores on Freshman Intelligence Tests definitely 
improve with the number of previous experiences with 
objective tests, n 

2. "After tiiree or more experiences, the difference is of 
little consequences (between experienced and non-experienced 
groups in taking objective mental tests). The differential 
may be one of confusion occasioned by a novel experience." 

3. "The experiential influence, although not the sole cause of 
differences in the scores of the two groups, nevertheless, is 
of sufficient importance that it may affect the classification 
of students for administrative purposes."

CHAPTER VIII 


HAS THE STUDENT TEACHER A NATURAL APTITUDE THAT IS 
IMPORTANT IN PREDICTING TEACHING SUCCESS? 


There are certain innate capacities that underlie and 
condition abilities and skills; when these capacities are present 
success is likely to result from training and vice versa. It 
is very difficult to distinguish between innate capacity and 
developed ability. All attempts to test for aptitudes are 
based on the assumption that a student, who in school work shows 
a certain span of attention, or manifests fluctuations of 
attention, or displays promptness of decision and action, will 
show the same quality or kind of attention, or of decision and 
action, as a schoolteacher. 

J. 0. Carlisle gives us the following picture of practice 
teaching in the Ontario College of Education: 

’’The whole scheme was exotic and artificial. Every lesson 
was a ’stunt* performed before an audience which, in the language 
of the theatre, was likely to *sit on its hands*. That many 
teachers-in-training did grow and gain considerable skill is an 
argument, not for the system, but for the fine old doctrine of 
predestination and election; they were *born teachers*.” 

This type of training is still quite common, despite the 
attempts being made at present to abandon the isolated lesson type 
of practice and to substitute a scheme of apprenticeship teaching. 

By this scheme some continuity of teaching is obtained and a teacher- 
in-training is permitted to begin, develop, and complete a topic.

While tabulating teaching practice marks in the Calgary 
Normal School, for the class of 1938-39, the writer was interested 
in the fact that, in a large number of cases, the first two 
practice lessons were marked higher than other lessons taught by the 
student later in the school-year. This is indicated by the 
tabulation shown in Table XI.

The average mark for 12 lessons was 63.01; for the first 
8 lessons the average mark was 63.76. 

Many factors may have entered into the higher marks for 
the first two lessons: 

1. The first two lessons were not counted in the average or 
median for the school year. They were looked upon as trials.

This fact was not known to the critic teachers in tue practice 
school who marked nearly all of these lessons, but it was 
known to the Normal School Staff. 

2. Great enthusiasm at the beginning of the school year. 

3. The first lessons usually follow directly after observation. 
The student-teachers do what they have seen done and this 
naturally pleases the critic teacher because she sees her own 
techniques in practice. 

4. Later in the year observation is often boring to the student- 
teachers because presentation lessons are kept for the student 
-teacher and she observes the teacher in the classroom doing 
routine work. The student-teachers are often observed using 
this time to prepare class assignments for instructors in 

the normal school. 

5. Luck in the choice of a lesson. Some types of lessons are 
more difficult to teach than others. 

6. As the term wears on, pupils in the practice school become 
weary of student teaching and it takes more skilful teaching 
to arouse the pupils. 

7. Accumulation of other work keeps the student-teacher from 
spending enough time on the preparation of lessons 

The writer examined the practice-teaching results in the 
Calgary Normal School for the class of 1958-39, to test the 
accuracy of, or conformity to the following conclusion based on 

the University of Toronto research: ^

T! If a student starts out well, he has a slightly better 
chance of improvement than if he starts out poorly. This would 
seem to indicate that if a student has a natural aptitude for 
teaching, it shows up early, 11 

Out of 238 student-teachers, 165 or 69^ taught better 
lessons in the first three lessons than tlieV did afterwards. This 
would seem to indicate that a natural aptitude for teaching shows 
up early. The writer 1 s research findings disagree with the 
conclusion that the student who starts out well has a slightly 
better chance of improvement than if he starts poorly. Many of our 
student-teachers reflect lack of opportunity during the first term. 
These students have in some cases been out of school from 1 to 3 
years. Some of them come from small high schools, while others 
have taken their high school courses by correspondence. When 
they arrive at the normal school where opportunities are more 
nearly equal, their industry overcomes to some degree their 
previous training. Many of them have to carry remedial work as 
well as the regular courses. 

Personality traits at the beginning of practice teaching 
are practically the same as they are at the completion of practice 
teaching. If these traits are present, they manifest themselves 
immediately. Such traits as loudness in voice, quickness in 
movement, and others of this nature, can be improved; but such- 
traits as mental energy, inventiveness, originality, dynamic 
and vigorous enthusiasm, versatility, humor, and sociability, 
under the best of coaching and advising, seem to remain constant 
throughout the training period. 1 The potentialities of goGd teaching 
are always present when the student is admitted to training.

CHAPTER IX 


ARE PERSONALITY TESTS CAPABLE OF MEASURING TRAITS 
NECESSARY FOR TEACHING SUCCESS? 

Personality has been said to be the "sum total of behavior 
tendencies”. It is always in a state of change. Every experience 
alters the nature of the reacting organism to some extent. Pre¬ 
diction must be based on the laws of human behavior: 

"If an act A has followed a mental state X, we can be fairly 
certain that if the mental state X occurs again the act A will 
follow; or, if a new mental state Y,that is like X,occurs that the 
act A will follow and the probability of its following Y will be 
determined largely by the similarity of Y to X.” 

From the foregoing reasoning it is assumed that prediction 
must be made on the basis of past behavior. 

There is much controversy to-day as to the predictable 
value of personality tests. Tests measure a single trait or a 
restricted number of traits. General personality is an average 
that tells us little. The functions tested are: judgment, 
attitude, conduct, knowledge, and interest. 

The following conclusions are from the University of 
Toronto research, 1954-1938: 

1. "Personality tests measure very little to date.” 

2. "Ability in practice teaching is not measured by personality 
tests. Measurement of personality traits is of no value if 
these traits are arbitrary and unrelated to other phases of 
human life.”

Under a grant from the Canadian National Committee for 
Mental Hygiene, Dr. Sam R. Laycock of the University of Sask¬ 
atchewan, used the Bernreuter Personality Inventory in an attempt 
to measure the traits which made for successful teaching.-*- The 
test was given to eighty students of the College of Education, 
University of Saskatchewan. These students were all college 
graduates when the test was applied at the beginning of their 
year of professional training. 

The test is scored in four scales: 

Bl. N- A Scale of Neurotic Tendency. Persons scoring high on 
this scale are emotionally unstable. Those scoring low are 
well balanced emotionally. 

B2. S- A Scale of Self-Sufficiency. Persons scoring high on 
this scale tend to prefer solitude and to ignore the advice - 
of others. Those scoring low tend to dislike solitude and 
often seek advice and encouragement. 

B3. I- A Scale of Introversion-Extroversion. Those scoring 
high tend to be imaginative and to live within themselves. 
Those scoring low tend to be extroverts. 

B4. D- A Scale of Dominance-Submission. Those scoring high 
tend to dominate others in face to face situations. Those 
scoring low tend to be submissive. 

The marks made by the eighty students in practice teaching 
were correlated by the Pearson Product Moments with the results 
of the four scales of the Bernreuter Personality Inventory. The 
following correlation coefficients were obtained: 

1. Neurotic tendency with practice teaching marks- -.211.05 

2. Self sufficiency with practice teaching marks- + .05 1.08 

3. Introversion-extroversion w r ith practice teaching 

marks- -.14 1.07 

4. Dominance-submission with practice teaching 

marks- -+.33 1.07

TeachersJJ Sam R. Laycock, Educational Administration and Supervision . 
January, 1934, pp. 59-63. 












49 


From his data Dr. Laycock concludes: 

"The results would seem to indicate that those students 
who possess a high rating in neurotic tendency and introversion 
would be less likely to be successful in teaching, and those who 
have a high rating on dominance and self-sufficiency are more 
likely to succeed in teaching. 11 

Reporting on the 'Wisconsin Study of Teaching Ability, Dr. 
A. S. Barr concludes: 1 


"Personality is an important factor in teaching success. 
Teaching is, or should be a very human undertaking. The emot¬ 
ional stability of the teacher; her social adjustments; her energy; 
vitality, and enthusiasm; her personal appearance and habits; the 
richness of her experience and background; skill in expression; 
and ability to work with others effectively, all bear directly upon 
the effectiveness of the teacher. This is probably just another 
way of saying that the teacher brings her w r hole self to teaching." 

Before we can predict teaching success with any degree of 
certainty, some measuring stick for personality traits must be 
devised. Considerable progress is being made in this direction. 

Dr. McSwain of Northwestern University, -when addressing 
a teachers convention in Calgary in April, 1940, said: "We can T t 
teach personality but we can provide the environment out of which 
personality emerges". He went on to say that environment reveals 
the inside of the child. It may be that the solution to the 
personality problem may be found in the training-school. If the 
student body can be kept small enough that the workshop technique, 
which provides a living experience, may be adopted, the training- 
school will become a place where people solve problems. The group 
should live together under one roof, take meals together, attack 
difficulties together. Experiences do something to individuals 
that is remarkable.. The institution must become an example of 


rich, cultural living.

CHAPTER X 


THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TEACHING SUCCESS 
AND CHRONOLOGICAL AGE 

"An application will not be accepted unless the applicant 

will attain the age of eighteen years on or before June 30, 1941."^ 

Chronological age is one of the items of information 

always required of prospective teachers. In recent years there 

has been a tendency in Alberta to raise the age requirements for 

entrance to our normal schools. The writer has no statistics to 

present from Alberta normal schools but presents a brief summary 

2 

of the findings of four researches:

Contribution No, 1P0 , Teachers College , Columbia University , 
1922, p. 67.

After reviewing these four studies, Stephen M. Corey says 
"If these contradictory results contribute to any generalization 
it is that a teacher f s age is at least an unknown factor in her 
success". 

There is very little evidence in favor of 18 years rather 
than 16 years. The fact that in testing intelligence (I.Q.) a 
maximum age of 16 years was used by Terman y may have significance 
here if we assume that there should be a real relationship 
between teaching success and intelligence as measured by an 
intelligence test. The following are looked upon as manifest¬ 
ations of intelligence: 

1. Problem solving - penetration. 

2. Setting relevant facts off against irrelevant facts. 

3. Discerning relationships. 

4. Perceiving similarities. 

5. Associating facts and events. 

6. Learning and remembering. 

7. Speed. 

8. Power to maintain a given attentive set. 

The assumption is that around 16 years of age it is 
difficult to distinguish a level of difficulty in the things

children are called upon to do in an intelligence test. The 
fact that an individual has lived a certain number of years, 
regardless of her activity during this time, gives us no ground for 
making inferences about instructional ability.

CHAPTER XI 


SOME TECHNIQUES FOR THE SELECTION OF PROSPECTIVE 
TEACHERS NOW USED EXTENSIVELY 


The trend to-day is away from a single admission criterion 
toward a battery of selective features. Where a single criterion 
is advocated it is ’’aptitude for teaching”. There is considerable 
evidence that the use of selective techniques has improved the 
quality of the students found in teacher-training institutions. 

Neal Billings, Milwaukee State Teachers College, made 
the following statement 

”From the data available at the present time, we are 
driven inevitably to the conclusion that pre-service prediction 
of teaching ability is largely a question of opinion. Even so, 
if the opinions are expressed by students of teachers and teaching, 
and if they are based upon a complete accumulation of data on the 
individuals concerned, they are likely to be much better than 
mere chance. This seems the only common-sense conclusion justif¬ 
iable under present circumstances.” 

In Alberta, our present (1841) selective process begins 
with high school guidance. The principal, or student counsellor, 
is asked to select for guidance towards the teaching profession 
those students who have the following abilities and personal 
qualities: 2 

1. ’’Mental ability and scholarship above the average. 

2. ’’Initiative and leadership.

5. "Good voice, speech and command of the English language. 

4. "Social grace and social intelligence considerably above the 
average. 

5. "Sincerity and strength of character. 

6. "Good mental health, and an attractive and well integrated 
personality. 

7. "Good physical health and physique and freedom from serious 
physical defect. 

All applicants must attain the age of eighteen years on 
or before June 30 of the school year in which they enter. 

A student for admission must have attained at least 100 
credits with an attainment of at least "B" in certain specified 
subjects. 

All students must write on two additional tests, viz: A 

General Test - a test of mental aptitude, and A Survey Test in 

Mathematics and Science. These examinations are said to be a 

test of a sound high school education.'*' Candidates are warned 

that they will not be permitted to take the General Test and 

Survey Test more than once . This means, according to Dr. Newland, 

that any student who fails to make a satisfactory mark on these 

two tests is forever excluded from obtaining normal school 

2 

admission in Alberta. 

All admissions to the normal schools is provisional only. 
At the beginning of the Normal School term, all candidates are 
required (l) to pass a medical examination for physical fitness,

and, (2) to take a qualifying examination which will comprise the 
following tests: 

(a) A test of general ability. 

(b) A test in silent reading. 

(c) A test of proficiency in oral and written English, includ¬ 
ing oral reading, vocabulary, language usage, spelling and 
writing. 

(d) Such further tests in the fundamentals of the elementary 
school and intermediate school subjects as may be found 
expedient. 

During the autumn term, each entrant is subject to a close 
survey with respect to ability, scholarship, command of the English 
language, attitude, personality and special fitness for the pro¬ 
fession of teaching. 

Only a British Subject is eligible to receive an Alberta 
teacher ! s certificate. 

Any student who shows little promise of success in the 
profession is asked to withdraw, and is not to be admitted for the 
spring term.'*' 

If it were possible to live up to the letter of these 
regulations, we might reasonably expect to secure a highly sel¬ 
ected group of student-teachers for our normal schools. Many 
situations have arisen since these regulations were laid dovm to 
alter the effective administration of them. The war that started 
in 1939 has taken many male teachers from the teaching profession. 

A return of better times has encouraged many female teachers to 
get married. The results of the Departmental Examinations in 1939

and again in 1940, made it necessary to lower the entrance re¬ 
quirements. The results on the two special tests were so poor 
in June, 1940, that these results had to be neglected as entrance 
requirements. To date this year (March, 1941) no student has 
been asked to withdraw from the Calgary Normal School, although 
one or two poorer students have withdrawn of their own accord. 

All poor students have been "warned” of low standing yet all of 
those "warned" have remained. 

In the Educational News of The School , November, 1940, 
pp. 264-65, is reported a shortage of teachers-in-training all 
across Canada. In Saskatchewan only is there an increaded enrol¬ 
ment in the normal schools. Alberta shares in this decreased 
attendance. From these news items, there appears to be a decrease 
in the number of students attending high school in various cities 
in Canada. The number of pupils enrolled in the Calgary schools in 
October, 1940, w^as 13,785. In October, 1959, 13,999 were enrolled. 


This enrolment was made up of: 

October, 1939 

October, 1940 

Senior High School 

3,014 

2,750 

Junior High School 

2,659 

2,495 

Elementary School 

8.326 

8.558 

13,999 

13,783 


The drop in the high school enrolment may be due in part 
to enlistments f and in part to the fact that many students obtained 
work.owing to employment conditions created by the war. 

It is almost certain that there will be a shortage of 
teachers in Alberta in September, 1941. There is every indication 
that it will be as difficult in September, 1941, as it was in

September, 1940, to secure sufficient replacements for the schools 
in Alberta, 

In the University of Utah the technique of o::hau;-t<ve 
consideration of each case in the light of all available data is 
used. The ultimate diagnosis is made by a group in conference. 

A prerequisite to all practice-teaching courses is a ’’personality 
clearance” by the Bureau of Student Counsel.'*' 

A technique in which tests are used extensively is found 
in the College of St. Catherine, St. Paul, Minnesota. An intensive 
study is made of each student. ’’This includes a summary of her 
health record; ratings on the Strong Vocational Interest Blank for 
women, and on the Bell Adjustment Inventory; and data on her 
scholastic aptitude and achievement- high school percentile ratings 
and honor point ratio for her freshman year, and percentile ratings 
on the American Council on Education Psychological Examination, 
and on the achievement tests in English Usage, General Culture, 
Literary Comprehension, and Contemporary Affairs prepared by the 
Co-operative Test Service. In the light of this material the 
members of the Committee on Teacher Selection agree on a recomm¬ 
endation for each student”. 2 

The Committee on Admission of New College has a list of 
criteria for admission as a freshman, much too extensive to be 
included in this thesis. An entire issue of Teachers College 
Record is devoted to the work of this institution. 0

In the admission requirements to teacher-training institutions 
in the State of New York are found three interesting items: 

1• Admission is refused because of marked over-weight or marked 
under-weight. 

2. A blank ’’for the purpose of discovering the degree of 
possession of moral qualities or qualities of attitude” must 
be filled out by the high school principal or superintendent. 

3. A certificate of physical examination by a reputable physican 
on a blank supplied by the State Department. •*- 

The Milwaukee State Teachers College makes use of a 
quantitative formula for prediction. Only those are admitted 
whose predicted grade point average is 1.3. A careful study of 
the predicted grade point averages of thousands of students,with 
their realized grade point averages, indicates that the correl¬ 
ation is low. A new technique is being developed that includes 
(l) the setting up of criteria that may be used by secondary 
school staffs.in judging the fitness of prospective candidates 
for the teaching profession, and (2) the listing of w r hat super¬ 
intendents and principals want in an application blank about 

2 

prospective teachers. 

There is some evidence of a technique that includes a 
period of practice-try-out experiences in high school before 

entering normal school.

A survey of 150 institutions devoted to teacher education 
was made recently to discover to what extent the intelligence 
test was being used in personal selection and evaluation. 1 The 
following findings are listed:

This survey reveals that eighteen institutions evaluated 

student intelligence on the basis of an intelligence test alone. 

More than half of the institutions used some form of the American 

Council tests or the Teachers College Psychological test. 

Mr. 8c he 1.1 hammer lists the following conclusions: 

1. "The intelligence test is used by more than two-thirds of 
the teacher-training institutions reporting.

2. ’’The high school record is considered as important as the 
intelligence test in the evaluation of intelligence. 

3. ’’Subjective techniques are used to corroborate the intell¬ 
igence test and high school record. 

4. ’’There is no combination of techniques which finds univer¬ 
sal favor. 

In the Fourth Yearbook of the John Dewey Society, Neal 
Billings gives many suggestions for a practical program of select¬ 
ion and guidance. 1 His first statement almost startles one: ” 
Guidance and/or education, including occupational guidance and 
education, really begins before a person is born”. Environmental 
factors to which the mother is subjected influence his entire 
future. He advocates guidance and opportunity for the individual 
throughout public and high school. 

Under ’’Admission Policies” Mr. Billings advocates that 
the program of selection and retention will have to be based upon 
a careful accumulation of information. The cumulative record is 
advocated elsewhere in this thesis. 

The Yearbook also advocates guidance w r ithin the institution 
after admission. The set-up is much too elaborate for Alberta in 
its present stage of development. Mr. Billings says in part, ”.... 
it will maintain health services, both physical and mental; clinics 
to help students with their reading, study, speech, and efforts to 
discover their vocational interests and aptitudes; and a faculty 
interested in, alert to, and having the time and facilities to 
respond efficiently to the ’counselling” needs of students”.

CHAPTER XII 


SUGGESTED TECHNIQUES FOR THE PREDICTION OF 
PROBABLE TEACHING SUCCESS 

The writer agrees with Dr. Kilpatrick that the method of 
selection should be "regarded as a process rather than an event".^ 
The following techniques are submitted by the writer after care¬ 
ful consideration has been given to each detail. Every technique 
listed has been tested at some time as a predictive agent. It 
must be kept in mind, however, that some factors which may appear 
to the reader to be conclusions based on research and actual every 
day practice, are merely recommendations and suggestions which 
have come to the writer after reviewing the literature on the 
preselection of teachers and analyzing a few of the studies on 
this topic. 

Pre-Normal School Selection . 

1. The Co-operative Effort of the Junior and Senior High Schools 
(a) Cumulative Records: 

Cumulative records should start as early as Grade IX and 
should be under the direct supervision of the "home room" 
teacher in the junior high school. These records should be 
designed to follow the pupil from school to school, and from 
grade to grade. The records should be maintained and amplif¬ 
ied as new evidence is forthcoming. In the senior high 
school the record should be kept by the "home room" teacher, 

or by some teacher designated for the task of counselling.

Dewey Society , 1937.

The writer advocates the keeping of a cumulative record 
folder for each pupil in Grade IX. Into this folder is 
put such information as the teacher’s first impressions 
of the child; his responses to other children and adults; 
his ways of meeting difficulties; his deficiencies in the 
tool subjects; and knowledge about his home and family 
relationships; information about the results of all tests; 
dated samples of the pupil’s work; correspondence and 
records of interviews.^ 

By the time the pupil has reached Grade XII, the card or 
folder should give a very good picture of the "whole child”. 
J. B. Stroud advocates the following factors for this "Case 
History”: success in school, social adjustments in school, 
offices held, problems presented in school, social behavior 
in general, recreational habits, religious behavior, relig¬ 
ious training, home influence, adjustment to home problems, 
occupational interests, occupational success, friendships, 
manner of spending leisure time, manner of meeting business 

p 

obligations. 

For teachers who favor a more complete record, the 
following are available: 

1. The Kardex Cumulative Personnel Record published by 
Remington-Rand. This system is very suitable^for either 
high school or teacher-training institutions. 0

2. The American Council Record prepared by the American 
Council on Education. For a number of years the College 
Presidents 1 Association, the Department of Public Instruct¬ 
ion of Pennsylvania, and the Carnegie Foundation for the 
Advancement of Teaching co-operating with a number of 
secondary schools in Pennsylvania, have experimented (1935) 
with the American Council Cumulative Personnel Record in 
connection with the Study of Relations of Secondary and 
Higher Education in Pennsylvania. This project has shown 
that the American Council Record is the most satisfactory 
instrument yet devised for presenting cumulative information 
concerning individual pupils. 

3. Baltimore Packet Record System. This system provides 
in a single unit a comprehensive cumulative history of 
each pupil’s school career. 

4. National Association of Secondary School Principals’ 

Blank. The form calls for census data, personal history, 
family history, placement data, interests, character 
appraisal, in addition to scholarship and attendance 
records. 

From the school nurse or school doctor should come consider¬ 
ation of physical and mental defects; also, state of health. 

This should include defects or diseases, curable and incurable, 
of the heart, lungs, kidneys, digestive system, and nervous 
system. Common sense must predominate at all times in the 
interpretation of findings. Defective vision, impaired 
hearing, speech defects, unsightly deformities, and over¬ 
weight and under-weight should be included. 

(b) Exploration Committee: 

An exploration committee should be set up in the feeder 
schools for the purpose of exploring the fitness of all 
individuals before admission to teacher-training courses. 

Some techniques to be employed by this committee are 
suggested: 

1. In October or November during the Grade XI year, super¬ 
ior students should be urged to enter the teaching pro-

fession, while weaker candidates should be directed else¬ 
where, 

2. Future teacher clubs should be established in high schools. 
This development shows considerable promise in schools in 
which it has been inaugurated. 1 2 The movement known as the 
Future Teachers of America grew out of the Horace Mann 
Centennial. The National Committee F.T.A., 1201 Sixteenth 
Street Northwest, Washington, D.C., has prepared a leaflet, 
"Future Teachers of America 11 which describes the plan for 
organizing in both high schools and colleges, and explains 
how a charter and library may be secured. 

The library is planned to meet three needs of the Future 
Teacher: (l) Personal Growth Leaflets as "Your Life in the 
Making 11 and "The Beginning Teacher". (2) Such books as 
"Horace Mann; His Ideas and Ideals", "Go Forth and Teach" 
and "Our Public Schools" give professional and historical 
background. (3) Through research bulletins, "Teaching 
as a Man f s Job", and similar publications, the student is 
enabled to make a survey of teaching as a career. 

So important is this movement that The Journal of the 

National Educational Association prints a separate 

2 

section each month called Future Teachers Service. 

Teachers and school boards must be educated to the realiz¬ 
ation that responsibility for the quality of students

entering the teaching profession rests jointly upon the 
high schools and training institutions. 

3. Speakers should be invited to address the Future Teacher T s 
Club. These speakers should be drawn from t^e teacher¬ 
training institutions, the school superintendents (inspectors) 
and the teaching profession as a whole. These talks should 
be developed around two main issues: 

(a) The opportunities which teaching offers for service, 
for goodness of life, for security, and for income. 

(b) The students* own purposes, talents, and aspirations. 
Joy Elmer Morgan suggests the following questions for 

development: ^ 

1. How many teachers are there? 

2. What about teacher T s salaries? 

3. How are the schools organized? 

4. Do teachers lead happy lives? 

(a) A sense of being useful and helpful to others 
adds to one T s happiness. 

(b) The school is filled with the joy of growth and 
learning. 

(c) One ! s associates have high standards of living 
and thinking. 

(d) The teacher is honored in the community. 

(e) Teaching offers mental and moral growth. 

(f) Vacation periods offer an opportunity for travel 
and study. 

(g) Sabbatical leave. 

(h) Teaching a great adventure. 

5. What are the rewards of teaching? 

Tt Ke most lives who serves best". 

6. What are the drawbacks to teaching? 

7. Have I the needed qualities? What makes a successful 
teacher? 

(a) Analyze the qualities of teachers you admire. 

(b) Study the biographies of a few great teachers.

(c) Make a list of the personal traits you believe 
necessary for successful teacl in ; i rri nge tl 

in order of importance: (genuine enjoyment of 
people; intellectual curiosity and initiative; 
a purpose to serve; sound health; self-control; 
high ideals; originality; interest in education, 
joy in observation, reading, thinking; a sense of 
humor; patience; enthusiasm; the power of personal 
growth). 

(d) Do not become a teacher if: 1 

1. In your high school studies you rank below 
the average of your class. 

2. You do not like children. 

3. You are not industrious. 

4. You have little strength of character. 

5. Your hobbies, recreative activities, and 
interests are not such as a teacher might 
well be expected to possess. 

8. How much education do I need? 

9. In what field shall I teach? 

10. Where shall I attend school? 

11. What is the future for teachers (in Canada)? 

The writer is much impressed by the possibilities that exist 
in such guidance work that he feels that the Department of 
Education would, be well advised to allot 5 credits for certif¬ 
ication in both Grade XI and Grade XII for the satisfactory 
completion of such a course as has been outlined. Textbooks 
are available for such a course- !t The Problems of Education: 

A First Course for the Orientation of Prospective Teachers", 
Southern California Book Depository, Los Angeles, $2.50. 

The need for selecting candidates for the teaching profession 
is great, and from the writer T s view point, merits greater- 
attention from the teaching profession and from its official 
organization, the A. T. A., than it is receiving at present. 

No amount of professional training can possibly substitute 
for fundamental equipment.

4. Exploratory work under tue supervision and guidance of 
the exploration committee. Students in the Future Teacher 
Club should be allowed to perform some of the duties of 
the teacher: 

(a) Mark the roll. 

(b) Tabulate results. 

(c) Teach assigned lessons under supervision. 

(d) Substitute for teachers. The writer is convinced, 
because of actual experience in this practice,that 
children in the elementary grades will not suffer 

any greater harm than they now suffer from the imposit¬ 
ion of the majority of substitute teachers available. 

(e) Observe teachers at work in the classrooms of the 
elementary school. The writer is fully aware of the 
many administrative difficulties that must be ironed 
out to make such a procedure feasible. 

Our experience in the Calgary Normal School, as well 
as experiences elsewhere,^" would indicate that teaching 
potentiality shows up early and can be detected as well 
in high school as during the first term in a training 
institution. The writer agrees with the Toronto con¬ 
clusion that, 11 A student can be both intelligent and 

2 

learned, yet fail egregiously as a teacher”. 

5. The high school period should be looked upon as the first 
screening process. Under the present set-up in Alberta,

Research, University of Toronto, Elementary School Journal ,

where guidance is in its initial stages of introduction, it 
would seem wise to exclude from the high school period of 
selection all testing of intelligence, personality, aptitudes, 
and attitudes of the standardized or objective types, and 
to rely on simple forms, leaving the more technical phases of 
selection to the preliminary testing period under the super¬ 
vision of the normal schools, where the tests can be given 
under the guidance of trained administrators, and correct 
conclusions can be drawn from the results obtained. All 
testing in the high school period should lead up to one 
question to be answered by the high school principal, acting 
on the advice of the members of his staff in conference: 

"Would you like to have your children in close contact 
with this individual daily in a classroom situation?" 

If this question is answered honestly and fearlessly by all 
high school principals, we will have made a real step for¬ 
ward in pre-training selection of teachers. Early in this 
thesis the writer accepted the hypothesis that the most 
desirable plan of selection is the one which will produce the 
greatest good for the greatest number of persons regardless 
of apparent injustices to applicants to teacher-training. 
Everyone cannot become a teacher. 

The value of such a statement from a high school principal 
is recognized by the Department of Education in Alberta.^

It is comparatively easy to set up quantity standards, based 
on the achievement of credits on selected high school units, for 
normal school entrance. Educational writers are stressing the import¬ 
ance of transferring attention of prospective teachers from units 
of work and time requirements, to the applicants themselves; to 
quality standards. 1 

The teacher T s personality, in the last analysis, is the 
chief instrument of instruction. Personality means the sum and 
organization of all human traits- physical, intellectual, emotional- 
into an integrated whole. 2 Rudolph M. Binder has expressed this 
in the following lines: 

”1 am personality, part of a divine plan of creation. 

I am growing personality, never static, always in process of 
change. 

I am a changing personality, an active bringer about of 
changes (for the better). 

I am a doing personality, not a being personality. 

I am a choosing personality, equipped to set purposeful goals. 

My growth will take place in the direction of the things I 
choose to do. 

My character is made up of my acts of choice.” 

Personality deficiencies are serious when t; e individual 
reaches the teacher-training institution. There is no doubt 
but that the high schools can relieve the training institutions of 
many of these difficulties by fearless counselling of prospect¬ 
ive teachers. 

The writer was impressed by what appears to be a very 
effective, yet very simple method of appraisal of personality 
used at Jarrett High School (Junior), Springfield, M. 0., based 
on anecdotal records. The Personnel Report includes the items

Work Habits, Self Direction, Social Adjustment, Progress in 
Knowledge and Skills, and Emotional Control. A five-point scale 
is constructed for each of the five items. This scale is an adapt¬ 
ation of the Behavior Description published by the Commission on 
Records and Reports of the Progressive Educational Association. 
Teachers are given a common language with which to describe students. 
A cart-wheel graph is utilized in making annual summaries of the 
anecdotes. This graph provides a profile of each student to be 
compared with a psychograph of an ideal rating (should it be possible 
to construct such a graph).^ Such a rating of personality would 
work very well in the high schools in Alberta, and could be looked 
upon as a ’’coarse screening” of the high school product. A 
’’personality clearance” from a high school principal should be a 
requisite for normal school entrance. 

The findings of various researches indicate very little 
correlation between scholarship and teaching potentiality. Yet 
’’common sense, experience, and tradition all tell us that high 
scholarship is a necessary qualification in the teaching prof- 

p 

ession”. The writer would retain much the same set-up of high 
school attainment found in the Alberta Normal Schools Announce¬ 
ment, 1940-41, page 4; also in the High School Programme. 

The writer would be inclined to retain the General Test 

and the Survey Test to be written by all normal school applicants

in June of the year in which they wish to enter training. While 
these tests did not provide satisfactory results in June, 1940, 
there is no reason to conclude that similar results will be obtain¬ 
ed in June, 1941. 

The three major single factors causing rejection of applic¬ 
ants should be scholarship, personality, and health (including 
various physical and mental defects). 

Selection in the Normal School . 

The final selection should be made in the normal school 
after admission. 

1. During June a travelling admission officer, a member of 
the normal school staff, should visit various centers in Alberta 
to personally interview all applicants for admission to training 
in September; to interview teachers and principals, and to give 
guidance where needed. This interview, along with the principals 
personality rating, and health score, should be pre-requisite to 
the granting of a card of admission to the applicant, even though 
his scholastic record is satisfactory. 

2. If accepted, the applicant should arrive at the normal school 
on the date designated. On the opening day the following procedure 
seems advisable: 

(a) Presentation of admission card. 

(b) Each applicant fills out a questionnaire reporting per¬ 
sonal data concerning academic interests; previous academic 
preparation; nationality; race; religion; education and 
occupation of parents; high school extra-curricular activities; 
recreational interests; summer and full-time work exper¬ 
iences; travel; camp attendance; camp counselling; teaching

experience (if any); scholarships and the bases on which they 
were granted; and information regarding self-support. 1 

(c) Each applicant, as early as possible during the first week, 
should be given a complete health examination to include 
basal metabolism, tuberculin, and Wasserman tests. 

3. A personal interview with each applicant by a member of 
the normal school staff specially trained for this work, is a 
desirable technique. The staff member should prepare himself 
for each interview by having in his possession all available 
information about the student. The interview, besides enabling 
the counsellor to make an appraisal of the applicant, should 
serve as the opening of a period of orientation to the institution 
for the applicant. Special problems that may face the applicant 
should be discussed, such as: finances, boarding house (comfortably 
located), social adjustments, occupational interests, special needs 
(as part-time employment). An appraisal on leadership qualities 
should be made. Pupil leaders have been found to have had better 
school attendance, better health records, better general appearance, 
more broadening experiences; to have participated and led in extra¬ 
mural activities to a greater extent than non-leaders, and were 
more often TT only Tt children.^ 

4. The high school principals appraisal as to personality, 
character, health and general fitness as an applicant for the 
teaching profession should be compared with ti e questionnaire

filled in by the applicant, and the additional information should 
be added to the questionnaire form. 

5. There should follow a period of orientation, during which 
information about boarding places, street car service, library 
facilities and regulations, practice teaching facilities, points 
of interest to see in the vicinity, and general school regulations 
should be imparted to all applicants. This information should be 
supplemented by tours of the building in groups, under a guide, 

to discover the location of each department of the school. Every 
attempt should be made to bridge the gap between the home and 
this new experience in social adjustment. 

6. During the first week the applicants should be divided into 
groups and each group should be assigned to a staff member who 
will act as a sponsor for each member of his group. 

7. The first three days of the second week should be devoted 
to the giving of a battery of tests designed to test several 
factors. Some educators claim that tests given during such an 
unsettled period are not true measures of the ability of the 
student. In a research described by D. M. Mackenzie of Dakota 
Wesleyan University, 1 a freshman class of 165 members, during 
the year 1938-39, wrote Form A of the Henmon-Nelson Test of 
Mental Ability. Five months later Form B of this same test was 
given to 90 members of the group of 165 students who had taken 
Form A. The selection was made on the basis of each third student 

arranged in rank order according to the initial score, being

eliminated from the original group for the second test. Conditions 
for both tests were kept as nearly identical as possible. The 
following conclusion was reached: 

TT The second administration of the examination yielded a 
mean score for this group of 90 students only .67 of a point 
higher than that obtained from the original test given during 
freshman week, a difference perhaps due to the practice effect. M 

n It appears justifiable to include the testing program 
as a part of freshman week activities, . ,T 

The opportunity should be given to all applicants to 
prepare for the tests on the skill subjects like spelling, writing, 
arithmetic accuracy and oral reading. Information as to the nature 
of these tests should be imparted to all applicants, along with 
a timetable giving the subject and the time for each test. Many 
low marks on these tests are due, not to poor scholarship, but to 
the fact that the content of some of these tests- arithmetic 
reasoning and computation- has not been reviewed by the applicant 
since Grade VIII. 

A selection of the following tests should be given to each 
applicant: 

1. Intelligence Tests. 

(a) The Ohio Group Intelligence Test. This test is a good 
instrument for the measurement of intelligence. It is used at 
the University of Utah as a predictive agent. 1 

(b) The American Council on Education Psychological Examin¬ 
ation prepared by L. L. Thurstone and Thelma Gwinn Thurstone.

teaching success at the University of Wisconsin, this test was found 
to possess somewhat higher validity than other tests employed.^ 

This test is used in the normal schools in Alberta and in the 
University of Alberta. 

(c) The Army Alpha Intelligence Test. In a research project at 
the State Normal School, Lewiston, Montana, the coefficient of 
correlation between intelligence as measured by the Army Alpha 
scores and student teaching was .028. When the Thurstone Psych¬ 
ological Examination was given, the coefficients of correlation 
for two groups was .353 and .23 respectively. The conclusion 

drawn was that the Thurstone test was a more reliable measure of 

2 

teaching intelligence than the Army Alpha. On the other hand, 
from a research on 266 Teacher College women at the University of 
California, Waddell concluded, T, There is a definite relation between 

g 

the Army Alpha score and probable success in practice teaching"/ 

(d) The Otis Self-Administering Intelligence Test. This test 

is too easy for a fairly bright adult. It is a good test and reason¬ 
ably reliable ; very convenient but not long enough. 

(e) The Thorndike Intelligence Test. This is one of the 
nationally recognized tests that has been used extensively. It 
has received many favorable reports as a predictive agent. 

(f) Willis-Smith Classification Test. This test is designed for 
Grades X to XIV. It is a test of 50 minutes. It has a coefficient

of correlation of .9 against the Binet Test. This test should 
be very satisfactory in Alberta since it was constructed by 
two Edmonton educationalists. It is sold by the Institute of 
Applied Arts in Edmonton, Alberta, and is thus readily available. 

The scale or test points obtained on one of these tests 
(selected) should be added in the total of the preliminary tests. 
These marks may be used '’raw 1 11 or ’’weighted”. *hen weighted, all 
marks should be transmuted to a mean of 50 and a sigma of 5 or 
10, using the formula: 

7~ - /VI + -§=~(x -■**',)= So (X- ^,) 

Suppose we wash to weight the Psychological Examination ”6”, 
we simply multiply the sigma by 6 as: 

T - 5-0 + 

This is the procedure we have followed in weighting a score in 
treating the results of the preliminary tests in the normal 
schools of Alberta. 

2. Personality Tests. 

Experimental evidence does not favor the placing of much 
importance on attempts to measure personality by means of the 
measuring instruments now available. There is, however, evidence 
that certain of these tests can be used as a ’’coarse screen”. 
Personality can be and is being measured. The pioneer investigations 
of individual differences by Galton and Pearson opened the way 
to this field.^

(a) To the basis of measuring personality on the interview 
with an applicant, may be added the rating by (l) the principal, 
(2) the teacher, and (3) a friend. This procedure holds much 
promise for a better rating.^ 

(b) The Bernreuter Personality Inventory. This test was 
used in New York City by the Adjustment Service and was found to 
have a diagnostic significance for vocational aptitude;^ also by 
the Committee on Admission to New College. This test will reveal 
the markedly emotionally unstable. There are 125 questions to 

be answered by students by encircling "Yes’ 1 or "No 11 . It is 
scored on four scales. Experimental evidence, linked and correl¬ 
ated with teaching practice results indicate: 

1. Those students who possess a high rating in neurotic 
tendency and introversion would be less likely to be 
successful in teaching. 

2. Those who have a high rating on dominance and self-suff 
iciency are more likely to succeed in teaching. 

(c) The Royer Inventory. This inventory consists of 188 
questions designed to "get at neurotic-submissive-introvert 
tendencies”. The test is scored by counting as correct those 
answers which v;ould be given by the dominant-extroverted and 
desirable person. The higher the score, the stronger is the 
indication of a dominant, extroverted, and non-neurotic person.' 

(d) The Thurstone Personality Schedule. A test that is 
widely used.

The choice here will rest largely on the availability of 
the tests. The Minnesota test and the Moris Trait Index L should 
receive favorable consideration. It is the opinion of the writer 
that most of these tests are too advanced for high school grad¬ 
uates and presume some knowledge of teaching situations, profess¬ 
ional interests, statistics, tests and measurements, and problems 
in education. 

The writer would recommend the use of the Strong Vocational 
Interest Blank. This blank can be scored for more than thirty 
different occupations to denote the vocational direction of interest. 
4. Attitudes Tests. 

The ability to classify a group, or an individual, accord¬ 
ing to the degree of acceptance or rejection of a given belief, 
is a genuine help to anyone w T ho wishes to know or modify the 
beliefs of that group or individual.

for its validity from Dr. A. S. Barr.

5, Achievement Tests* 

(a) Co-operative General Culture Test. 1 

(b) Co-operative English Usage Test. 2 This test is chosen 
because of its practicability for teachers. It calls for ability 
to identify and correct errors in capitalization, punctuation, 
grammar, and sentence structure. It calls for the ability to 
identify misspelled words. 

(c) Contemporary Affairs Test. 3 This test is concerned with 
issues that are given wide attention in newspapers, magazines, 
and periodicals. 

(d) Literary Comprehension Test. 4 

(e) Tests of vocabulary, spelling, good usage, sentence str¬ 
ucture, arithmetic reasoning and arithmetic accuracy should be 
retained but should be altered so as not to conflict with the 
Co-operative Test Service tests. 

1. Advanced Vocabulary, Form A, and Advanced Vocabulary, 
Form B, when correlated from year to year in the preliminary tests, 
have shorn a correlation coefficient of .9. This correlation 
indicates that these tests measure something with a high degree 
of reliability. These tests are mimeographed and have no disting¬ 
uishing name on them. The writer was informed that they were 
prepared by Dr. H. E. Smith of the College of Education, Edmonton. 

These tests should be retained.

2. The tests in arithmetic that have been used for the 
past three years, are not very satisfactory. They produce a badly 
skewed distribution, being too easy for Grade XII students. 

When compared with term tests in the normal school, the results 
have not been found to be reliable. 

The writer would suggest the use of the Roger Test for 
Diagnosing Mathematical Ability, Agnes L. Rogers, Laidlaw Brothers, 
Chicago. 

5. Among the good high school and college reading tests 
is the Nelson-Denny, Houghton Mifflin Co., 1929. Part I is a 
vocabulary test, and Part II is a test of ability to read and 
comprehend the paragraph. 1 

4. Sixteen Spelling Scales- standardized in sentences 
for secondary schools- Briggs and Kelley, Laidlaw Brothers, 

Chicago. 

These academic tests serve a purpose in prediction. For 
the 1938-59 class in the Calgary Normal School, the coefficient of 
correlation between the preliminary test scores and final practice 
teaching scores was .25, and between the preliminary test scores 
and academic success at the normal school, it was .58. While these 
correlations are low, they offer the promise of greater value v'hen 
more reliable instruments of measurement are prepared. At present 
the weight of evidence is against the examination as a means of 
selecting students who will do better in student teaching. Schol-

astic performance during the previous three yeais has a higher 
predictive value. 1 

The tests selected should be scored. Each test score 
should be transmuted from X (the raw score) to T (the transmuted 
score) thus obtaining comparable scores. Despite the fact that 
experimental evidence from the 1939-40 class in the normal schools 
of Alberta indicated that raw scores are almost as satisfactory 
as weighted scores, a scale of weights should be assigned and 
each test weighted. The mathematical calculation necessary is 
shown on page 76 of this thesis. 

The next procedure is to find the sum of the transmuted 
and weighted marks for each student. List all applicants from 
top to bottom in order and assign a percentile rank to each 
applicant. The low 10$ should be watched very carefully and 
individuals should be asked to withdraw as evidence of lack of 
fitness for teaching is obtained. All refusals should be on 
grounds sufficiently substantial that the reasons for refusals 
can be discussed frankly with the applicant. There should be 
continued guidance during the training period- guidance even out 
of the teaching profession and into another vocation. 

A probation period should last for the year at normal 
school and during the in-service period until a ’’permanent” 
certificate has been granted to the applicant. During this 
probation period there should be a definite attempt at up¬ 
grading the student-teachers and teachers-in-service:

There should be a dissemination of occupational infor¬ 
mation to all applicants: 

1. A canvass of the employment situation. 

2. The relation of the teacher to the A. T. A. and to otl er 
members of the profession. 

3. The relation of the teacher to the community. 

4. The formation of a Rural Community Group to study rural 
problems. 

5. Select leaders from rural schools to return to the normal 
school for a day, or a week, to make reports to the student-teach¬ 
ers and to the members of the staff. 

6. Instructors should visit and teach in rural schools for 
short periods to renew contacts with actual country school situat¬ 
ions and rural problems. 

7. All applicants should spend at least one week in observat¬ 
ion and practice teaching in a carefully selected rural school, 
preferably where the teacher-in-charge is a fairly recent normal 
school graduate. 

8. All students should be given an introduction to the phil¬ 
osophy of education. 

9. A practicium should furnish the student-teacher with a 
general overview of the whole educational process of the element¬ 
ary school. An attempt should be made to establish a close co-ord¬ 
ination between the philosophy and principles of education and 
the practices and the procedures of the practice or demonstration 
school in its work with children. Teacher-in-training ratings 
should be made by the critic teachers.

10. There should be sever< i in rvi 
are not measuring up to requirements, and counselling should be 
given. 

During this time selection is still going on. Errors in 
judgment must be avoided if possible. Often students are careless 
about studies in high school, but with a job and responsibilities, 
they rise to the occasion. On the other hand, we find the scholar¬ 
ship student who did nothing in high school but study, unable to 
understand children; unable to get down to their level. 

At this time the student-teacher ! s potential ability in 
a schoolroom situation must be judged by try-out experiences. 
Guidance and assistance should be provided by members of the staff. 

Immorality, incompetence, insubordination, and unprofess¬ 
ional conduct should be considered sound bases for dismissal. 

There should be a gathering together of all available infor¬ 
mation and a suitable system for recording it should be aevised. 
Final judgment should be made by the staff of the normal school, 
or by a committee of the staff, on a composite of all the ratings 
that have been made on each student-teacher. 

There should be a follow-up of academic results and pract¬ 
ice teaching results with special emphasis on the relationship 
betv/een effort and results. The ultimate diagnosis must be made 
by a group in conference. Good common sense must predominate among 
the members of this group and prejudices and preconceived opinions 
must be set aside so that an impartial decision may be made on 
each candidate. 

After the student has been granted an interm certificate, 
there should be a follow-up in service. Some of the techniques

to be used are: 

!• Inspectors reports or superintendent’s reports on each 
teacher-in-service. 

2. Visits by members of the normal school staff to teacher’s 
conventions where ex-students may be interviewed. 

3* Summer school se ors me< 

in class and in workshop and discuss their problems with them. 

4. Regular correspondence with ex-students. 

5. Class or school reunions. 

6. Vacation periods offer the opportunity for renewal of 
acquaintenships. 

A bulletin published in 1939 by the Pennsylvania Depart¬ 
ment of Public Instruction, lists the following types of in- 
service educational activity: constructive supervision, demon¬ 
stration and school visits, consultative services, follow-up 
by teacher-education institutions, summer study, extension and 
home study, professional and cultural reading, travel, sabbatical 
leave, institutes, professional organizations and meetings, 
panel discussions, salary increments, retirement plans, tenure 
legislation, research investigations, and school surveys.^ 

The writer is interested in the possibilities for up¬ 
grading teachers-in-service by means of the technique of having 
one or two rooms in the practice school open for inspection by 
rural and city teachers, each Saturday morning. Teachers from 
surrounding rural areas would then have the opportunity of

seeing first hard, many modern practices bein^ demonstrated 
under actual classroom conditions. 

There should be a final session on each apilicant-in- 
service. This session should b< par

Alberta, inspectors or superintendents concerned, and normal 
school staffs, before a final judgment is made and a "permanent" 
certificate is granted.
