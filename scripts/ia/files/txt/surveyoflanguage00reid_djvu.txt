SYNOPSIS 


The primary purpose of this investigation was 
to compare the language achievement of Alberta school 
children in relation to intelligence, sex, and bilin¬ 
gualism. Five randomly chosen samples were drawn from 
eight geographical areas of the province, differentiated 
in terms of socio-economic status, racial origin, and 
degree of concentration of population. The testing 
instruments used in this study were: the California 
Short-Form Test of Mental Maturity, and the appropriate 
California Language Tests for the grades being considered. 

The scores obtained on the above tests were 
tabulated on specially designed data assembly sheets. 

The mean Total I.Q,. and mean Total Language scores 
for the various samples were computed and treated 
statistically in order to determine whether or not 
any significant differences existed. Sex differences 
in language achievement were compared, as were the 
scores for bilingual children and those who stated 
English was the only language spoken in the home. 

Finally, for each of the five samples under study, 
the degree of relationship between intelligence

and achievement in language was determined and tested 
for reliability. 

The results of this study provided evidence 
to show that urban children obtained’verbal-type mental 
test scores which are significantly superior to those 
obtained by rural children. Moreover, a marked relation¬ 
ship was found to exist between tested intelligence and 
achievement in language. In the portion of the study 
dealing with sex differences, the girls demonstrated a 
highly significant superiority over the boys in language 
achievement. Similarly, children from homes in which 
English was the only language spoken obtained significantly 
higher scores in language than those obtained by bilingual 
pupils.

CHAPTER I 


INTRODUCING THE PROBLEM 

. Our growing understanding of the educational 
needs of children necessitates a continuous modifica¬ 
tion of curricular content and pedagogical procedures. 
Regardless of the degree to which the school curriculum 
may be modified, however, one thing is certain 
language will always remain its keystone. Because of 
the importance of language, scholars and research 
workers are constantly adding to the accumulation of 
knowledge relating to it. Insofar as the Alberta 
scene is concerned, it must be admitted that such 
is not the case. Though investigations in the fields 
of mental testing, reading and arithmetic have done 
much to bring about changes in the school curriculum 
and in teaching methods, research in language has 
lagged. 

Educators have long recognized that such 
factors as language spoken in the home, racial origin, 
socio-economic status, sex, and intelligence in¬ 
fluence achievement in the field of the language 
arts. The degree to which these factors are operative 
in the schools of Alberta has not, heretofore, been 
very thoroughly investigated* Whether rural children

compare favourably or unfavourably with town and urban 
children, whether there are significant sex differences 
in language achievement, whether the many racial groups 
represented in our schools affect the mastery of 
language, and whether there is any marked relationship 
between intelligence and linguistic achievement, 
become fundamental problems for considerations, 

The more recent emphasis on the functional 
use of language in Alberta schools calls for effective 
techniques of evaluation and increased interest in 
the measurement of the basic language skills* 

Evaluation in its broadest sense should involve every 
type of organizational unit in the province* Ap¬ 
praisal of progress in language achievement should 
subsequently result in the improvement of instruction* 

A greater understanding of the status of language in 
the schools, and the degree to which the present 
curriculum might provide for the language needs of 
the various pupil groups thus constituted a major 
purpose of the present study* 

Data provided by reliable testing instruments 
afford a means of comparing the mean scores of 
sample groups, not only with each other, but with the 
larger standardization group* Careful utilization 
of the results can do much to guide the efforts of

teachers and educational leaders in the interest of 
an improved language program. 

In May 1953, with the approval of the provin¬ 
cial Department of Education and the assistance of 
the Research Committee of the University of Alberta, 
Dr. G. M. Dunlop, Dr. R. E. Rees, and Miss Dorothy 
Lampard of the Faculty of Education, undertook the 
direction of a project designed to gather authentic 
information concerning achievement in reading and 
language in Alberta schools. 

The first major investigation arising out 

of this project was recently completed by Miss 

Anne Carmichael ^ in which she sought to determine 

the status of reading achievement in Alberta schools. 

A study designed to determine the language achievement 

levels of samples of children in Grade IV and VII 

represented a second major investigation, conducted 

o 

by Mr. G. R. Conquest „ Specifically, the writer 1 s 
task is that of comparing the English language 
achievement of urban, town, and rural children of 
Alberta in relation to intelligence, sex, and 
bilingualism.

CHAPTER II 


RELATED STUDIES 

Concern for language is not new. Urban, in a 
philosophic treatise on the subject, refers to 
reflection on language as "one of the oldest and most 
constant preoccupations of the human mind."3 Lan¬ 
guage has always been of interest to scholars and 
teachers. Earlier students of language were interested 
in it largely from the philosophic and historic point 
of view. Strickland points out that TT modern educators 
are more interested in its function, its development 
by children, and its effect upon their lives and 
personalities."^ 

1. Intelligence 

It is generally conceded that language power 
is closely related to intellectual power. Other 
things being equal, TT a person f s mastery of language 
for general purposes is a reliable index to his 
intellectual powers.”^ Studies of speech disorders 
indicate an unmistakable connection between linguistic 
ability and general intelligence. "Hawk, in a study 
of children who were being given help with the mastery 
of speech development, found that I.Q. tested as 
much as 40 points higher after six months to a year of 
speech training.

Watts gave vocabulary tests to several 
thousand children in Birmingham, England, dividing 
the group into two sections representing poor districts 
and comparatively well-to-do districts. He found that 
at ten years of age the children from well-to-do 
districts "were able to score an average of fifty per 
cent more marks" than those from poorer districts, 
but that this advantage was gradually lost, so that 
at the age of fourteen the influence of economic 
background was considerably levelled off. This would 
seem to indicate that intellectual ability enables 
children to develop power in the use of language 
when environmental factors favor such development. 

Speaking of environmental influences in 

p 

relation to intellectual development, Shepard 
comments as follows: "The environmental milieu in 
which a child is reared may influence the development 
of certain skills, abilities, and fields of knowledge 
which are considered most significant and valuable 
for those living in that specific geographical or 
social area. As those abilities are encouraged, 
certain patterns of behaviour and mental development 
may be evidenced," In a study of the verbal and non¬ 
verbal abilities of matched groups of urban and rural 
children, Shepard 9 f ounc i that urban children were 
superior verbally. Mechanically, however, rural

children scored higher than similar urban groups* 

The author assigns the reasons for such differences 
to environmental demands and practice. 

In a survey of education conducted in Utah 
in 1926 , the scores made by urban and rural children 
on intelligence and achievement tests were compared. 
The mean intelligence quotients of pupils in the 
fourth and seventh grades in ten county districts 
and in one city district are shown in Table I.

The same children were given the Stanford Achievement 
Test, and when the scores for the county school 
districts were compared with those of the Salt Lake 
City district, the mean difference in educational 
achievement was found to be 12.3 months in favor of 
the city children.

In order to learn the amount of agreement 
between the scores obtained by the pupils in the two 
tests, the correlation coefficient between them was 
computed and found to be *&7. This high positive 
correlation indicated that the two tests measured 
largely the same general abilities of the pupils. 

Since the disparity between intelligence 
scores was paralleled by a comparable difference in 
scores on the achievement tests, the author proceeded 
to compare the mean academic accomplishment ratios ^of 
urban and rural children. The results of this com¬ 
parison are shown in Table IA. In every case but one,

the accomplishment ratios of the rural pupils exceeded 
those of the urban pupils. Taking into account the 
scores on the intelligence tests, it was thus concluded

that the rural children were making more satisfactory- 

progress than were the urban children*

Hinds conducted an investigation in which he 
attempted to compare the brightness of country and 
city high-school children. For his testing instru¬ 
ment he used the Otis Group Test, Form A, administered 
under conditions which were made as nearly uniform as 
possible. From Table 11$. it is evident that the 
students in the various types of schools differed in 
intelligence level. It is Hind T s conclusion that

the mental traits measured by the Otis group tests, 
exist to a lesser degree in the average rural child 
than in the average child of the city. 

Numerous studies have shown the positive 
correlations of achievement of individuals in the 
basic skills with mental ability. These correlations 
are ordinarily found to be in the vicinity of .70,

when corrected for normal range, Terman and Merrill ^ 
consider the Stanford-Binet vocabulary test to be one 
of the most valuable single tests in the scale because 
of its high correlation with the mental age ratings 
on the scale as a whole. Correlations for single age 
groups range from ,65 to ,91 with an average of ,£l. 

Gates, Jersild, McConnell and Challman ^ 
state that fT children with high I,Q, T s are generally 
superior to those of lower I,Q, T s in composition, 
reading, and spelling, n With reference to the 
correlations between the Binet tests and scores on 
these subjects, coefficients were found to be ,63, 

•56, and ,52 respectively. Working with a group of 
tenth-grade children Bond arrived at a correlation 
coefficient of ,59 between English usage and the 
Stanford-Binet intelligence quotient -^°, 

In a study of the effective and recognized 
vocabularies of Alberta students in Grades VII to 
XII, Chalmers ^7 discovered a correlation coefficient 
of ,63 between intelligence and vocabulary. The 
most recent study conducted in Alberta was carried 
out by Gavinchuk ^ in which he found significant 
correlations between intelligence tests and the 
California Language Test ranging from ,31 to .4$*

obtained between scores on the Progressive Language

Test, Form A, and the mental ages obtained on the 
California Mental Maturity Test as .52. 

Though the degree of correlation between 
intelligence and language achievement varies from 
one investigation to another, nevertheless, a 
substantial positive correlation does exist in every 
case. Moreover, it is of importance in the present 
study to note that this relationship appears to 
maintain regardless of the geographic or ethnic 
areas from which the pupils being tested are chosen. 

2 . Sex Differences 

A fairly consistent finding of the research 
workers is that girls surpass boys in a number of 
aspects of language development, although the amount 
of difference has varied in different studies. Olson 
states that in the elementary grades girls are superior 
to boys on the average in reading comprehension, vocab¬ 
ulary, and basic language skills. At the secondary 
level, studies have indicated that girls continue to 
maintain their linguistic superiority. In laboratory 
studies where growth curves in language for girls and 
boys from the same family have been compared, girls 
have been found to exceed the boys in eight out of ten 
comparisons where five out of ten would be the result 
of chance.

McCarthy reports that "wherever groups of boys 
and girls are well matched in age, intelligence, and 
socio-economic status, and when the situation in which 
responses are recorded does not favor the interests 
of either sex, language differences in favor of girls 
appear in a wide variety of measures which reveal 
developmental trends." The evidence on articulation, 
comprehensibility of speech, and incidence of speech 

defects also tends to favor the girls. 

22 

Strickland , in discussing sex differences in 
language development refers to Day’s finding that 
girls use more words than boys, and that they show 
all forms of the complete sentence earlier and in 
larger proportion than boys. "Davis found the 
articulation of girls superior to that of boys and the 
length of remarks made by girls up to nine and one- 
half years to be slightly greater than the length of 
remarks made by boys %3 9 tt Interestingly, too, boys were 
found to be less shy than girls, to ask more questions, 
to make more spontaneous remarks, and also to make 
more errors and use more slang than did the girls. 

In a review of the literature, one finds that 
girls show a consistent superiority in spelling. On 
language usage tests and on composition scales, girls 
excel by an apparently wide margin. Cummins ^ obtained 
a significant difference in favor of girls for a'

group of Grade V pupils on the language test of the 
Stanford Achievement Battery. Jordan 2 5 found that 
on an English usage test only 29 per cent of the boys 
equalled or exceeded the mean score of the girls. 

One of the most comprehensive treatments of 
sex differences in school achievement was that carried 
out by Stroud and Lindquist 2 ^. For several years the 
college of Education and the Extension Division of the 
college of Education and the Extension Division of the 
State University of Iowa had been sponsoring a state¬ 
wide achievement testing program at the high school 
level. In 1935, the Iowa Every-Pupil Testing Program 
was extended downward to include Grades VI, VII, and 
VIII, and in 1940 to Grades III, IV, and V. The tests 
used in this program are known as the Iowa Every-Pupil 
Tests of Basic Skills. The following table summarizes 
the sex differences in performance on the basic 
language skills for Grades III to VIII inclusive.

The samples used in the results reported in 
Table III were drawn by selecting the papers of every 
tenth pupil from lists of names arranged alphabetically 
for each grade. Thus the approximate number of 
pupils tested per grade may be ascertained by multi¬ 
plying the N ! s in Table III by 10. The minus sign is 
used arbitrarily to signify the mean score differences 
in favor of the girls. Thus it is seen that in the 
elementary school grades, girls maintain a consistent 
and quite significant superiority over boys in language 
usage. The authors go on to state that this same 
situation prevails at the high school level. The two 
sexes are found to maintain the same relative positions 
in language achievement throughout the elementary and 
secondary schools. 

On the basis of a statistical survey conducted 
on behalf of the Alberta Teachers 1 Association by 
Sansom 2*5, definite sex differences in language achieve¬ 
ment were observed at the Grade X level. The dif¬ 
ference in mean scores revealed the girls to be 
significantly superior to the boys in English usage. 

Boys and girls showed no material differences, however, 
in vocabulary. 

Speaking of differences in general achievement, 
Lund ^9 states that girls between the ages of nine and 
fifteen tend on the average to surpass boys. He goes

on to suggest that this TT may be due to the fact that 
girls mature earlier than boys.” In this connection 
Olson ^0 points out that TT boys of a given age 
achieve and behave in a manner consistent with some¬ 
what younger girls”. The suggestion is that many 
of the differences noted in research studies become 
explicable in terms of rate of maturation. Never¬ 
theless, the fact remains that even when boys and 
girls have been matched for intelligence, the girls 
do relatively better in English and languages than 
do the boys. 

3* Bilingualism 

Bilingualism is the term applied to the use of 
two languages by the same person or persons. Ordinarily, 
one language is learned and spoken in the home while 
the second language is learned outside the home. In 
extreme cases, the second language is and must be 
learned almost entirely in the school. 

The recognition of bilingualism as an education¬ 
al and psychological problem has developed with the 
widespread use of standardized tests of achievement 
and intelligence. Such tests have provided educators 
with objective means of determining whether or not 
significant differences exist between bilingual and

monolingual children. 

Darcy 31 conducted a study to determine the 
effect of bilingualism upon the measurement of intel¬ 
ligence of children attending Brooklyn and Manhatten 
nursery schools. Two groups of one hundred six 
children each, ranging in ages from two years, six 
months to four years, five months were the subjects. 

If a child spoke and heard Italian at home, but 
heard and spoke English almost exclusively outside 
the home, he met the requirements of the bilingual 
group. If, on the other hand, the child heard and 
spoke English at home and outside of home, he met 
the requirements of the monolingual group. The 
1937 Revision of the Stanford-Binet Scale, Form L, 
was used as a verbal test; and the Atkins Object¬ 
fitting Test, Form D, was used as a non-verbal means 
of measurement. Results of this study revealed highly 
significant differences between I.Q. f s on the Stanford- 
Binet Scale in favor of the monolingual children. 
Conversely, the Atkins Test showed significant dif¬ 
ferences in favour of the bilinguists. Since both 
groups were closely matched as to number, sex, age, 
and socio-economic status, it was concluded that the 
bilingual subjects suffered from a distinct language

handicap in their performance on the Stanford-Binet 
Scale. 

An investigation of the comparative intel¬ 
ligence of children in certain bilingual and monolingual 
schools in South Wales was undertaken by Barke The 

pupils of three mixed bilingual schools in a mining 
district where Welsh is the dominant language were 
compared with the pupils of two mixed schools in a 
monolingual English district. The bilinguists were 
found to be slightly superior to the monoglot pupils 
on non-verbal tests but definitely inferior, both in 
urban and rural areas, on tests of verbal intelligence. 
The investigator f s conclusion is that the inferiority 
of the bilinguists was due to language difficulties and 
imperfect comprehension rather than mental conflicts. 

Saers in an effort to determine the effect 
of bilingualism on intelligence, tested school children 
and university students in Wales and concluded that the 
superiority of monolingual students prevails even at 
the college level. In conducting tests at the University 
College of Wales, he found that the standard obtained 
by 50 per cent of the bilingual students from Wales 
was attained by 75 per* cent of the monoglots from the 
same part of the country 0 This finding is in contrast

to the observations of other investigators who agree 
that early bilingualism causes confusion and delay 
in mental growth, but that this difference tends to 
disappear at the high school and college levels. 

In studying separately four groups of scholars 
over a period of two years, Smith 34 found that they 
developed at different rates in their power of free 
English composition accordingly as they were monoglot 
or bilingual. Monoglot scholars maintained a signif¬ 
icant superiority. 

Studies of bilingual children in the United 
States indicate that they tend to be retarded in 
vocabulary development, do less well on tests of 
achievement in school subjects, are markedly retarded 
on verbal tests of intellectual development, and drop 
out of school more frequently than do other children. 
Hobbs 35 claims, however, that these findings are 
TT confounded by many influences not directly related 
to bilingualism, such as socio-economic status, member¬ 
ship in a minority group, and resentment of an imposed 
language." "In America", says Hobbs, "it has been 
found that the longer the bilingual child remains in 
school, the less the difference between him and other 
children."

An investigation of the effect of instruction 
in French upon the mastery of the English language 
in English-French schools in Alberta was conducted 
by Gibault The study included 141 French and 

58 English children. The findings show an appreciable 
superiority of English over French children at the 
Grade IV level, but only a slight superiority by the 
time Grade VIII was reached. 

Robinson ^7 conducted a study in Alberta of the 
written language errors of pupils of Ukranian orgin. 

He discovered that bilingual pupils of Ukranian 
parentage experienced considerable difficulty in their 
mastery of the English language 0 TT More errors were 
found in the work of pupils attending rural schools 
than in the work of pupils attending town and village 
schools.” In agreement with the findings of other 
investigators, a gradually decreasing proportion of 
errors was in evidence as pupils progressed through 
the grades. 

While considering the effective vocabularies 
of Alberta students, Chalmers ^ discovered that 
bilingual pupils proved to be definitely inferior 
in both the recognition and use of English vocabulary. 
Sullivan in an investigation of the English 
disabilities of Ukranian and Polish students in the 
Alberta High Schools attributes their inferiority to

the persistent and almost exclusive use of foreign 
language in the home* 

Though the literature on bilingualism may be 
considered somewhat meagre there is, nevertheless, 
adequate evidence to suggest that children of foreign 
parents suffer a definite handicap in English language

CHAPTER III 


THE RESEARCH DESIGN 

1. The Selection of Samples 

The language survey described in this study 
constituted only part of a larger project, the 
purpose of -which was to accumulate a body of data 
which would permit comparison of the attainment of 
various groups of Alberta pupils in reading and 
language. In order to arrive at valid results, 
the samples used were chosen in as random a fashion 
as possible. Garrett ^ points out that the 
criterion of random selection is met when every 
person in the population has an equal chance of 
being drawn. 

The impossibility of conducting a completely 
random selection was overcome by the method of 
stratification. The province was divided into 
eight separate areas on the basis of racial origin 
of population, socio-economic status, and location. 
From each of these areas one town was randomly 
chosen in which the school population was in excess 
of 250 but not over 1000. 

In selecting the graded rural and ungraded 
rural samples from each of the eight areas, the number 
of pupils chosen was roughly proportional to the

total school population of the area concerned. Graded 
rural children were randomly chosen from classrooms 
in towns having a school population of less than 250. 

To assure greater validity of results, only children 
who actually resided in rural areas were included 
in the graded rural sample. For the large urban and 
small urban samples, the cities of Edmonton and 
Lethbridge, respectively, were randomly selected. 

The samples, number of pupils tested, and grades 
included in the complete survey of language achieve¬ 
ment is shown in Table IV. Though it was originally

Before being asked to proceed with the 
administration of the tests, teachers, principals, 
and superintendents were provided with detailed in¬ 
structions for conducting the tests. It was hoped 
that in this way the pupils of all five samples 
would receive the tests under comparable conditions. 

2. The Testing Instruments 

One of the fundamental considerations in 
the selection of suitable testing instruments is 
whether or not they are capable of fulfiling the 
particular purposes for which they are to be used* 
Moreover, such significant factors as the cost, 
ease of administration, user acceptability, and the 
usefulness of results must be taken Into account. 

With the specific purposes of the Alberta survey 
of language achievement in mind, as well as the 
practical considerations involved in the choice of 
tests, it was decided to use the California Short- 
Form Test of Mental Maturity, Elementary (1950 S- 
Form) as a measure of intelligence, and the Elementary 
and Intermediate Forms AA of the California Language 
Test as measures of achievement in language. 

The California Short Form Test of Mental 
Maturity provides sub-tests which yield three mental 
ages and three intelligence quotients: Language,

Non-Language, and Total. Four major factors involved 
in intelligence are said to be measured by this test, 
namely: special relations, logical reasoning, numer¬ 
ical reasoning, and verbal concepts useful in thinking 

The authors of the California Short Form Test 
of Mental Maturity are Elizabeth T. Sullivan, Ph.D., 
Willis W. Clark, Ed. D., and E. W. Tiegs, Ph.D.. It 
is their claim that "the major purpose of this test 
is to provide information on the nature and organi¬ 
zation of the abilities of a given pupil in order 
that that information may be used to guide his learn¬ 
ing activities 

Cattell, ^ in a review of the California 
Test of Mental Maturity, states that the test is 
"exceedingly well designed from the point of view 
of adaptation to school needs and the convenience 
of the teacher. All the data regarding consistencies, 
standardization, and correlation with school progress 
that one could reasonably demand are clearly presented 
Shaffer ^ points out further that the total score 
coefficients of reliability range from .92 to .95• 
Validity is defended in terms of high correlation 
with the Stanford-Binet scale though the exact 
coefficient is not given. Keeping in mind the fact 
that the California Short-Form Test of Mental Maturity 
requires only 47 minutes of testing time, there would

appear to be ample justification for its use in the 
Alberta language arts survey. 

Both the California Language Te<st, Elementary, 
Form AA and the California Language Test, Intermediate 
Form AA were developed by Ernest W. Tiegs, Ph.D., and 
Willis W. Clark, Ed.D.. They describe their tests as 
Tr instruments for accurately measuring student achieve¬ 
ment in fundamental language skills.” ^ It is also 
contended that these tests TT provide a basis for 
planning remedial instruction in the areas where 
individual students may be deficient ^. TT 

The Elementary form of the California Language 
Test for use in Grades IV, V, and VI contains 
exercises in the mechanics of writing and spelling, 
and a section on English usage and sentences. Cap¬ 
italization and punctuation are tested in sentences, 
fifteen correct responses being possible in each. 
Pooley ^ comments that the test appears to be a 
convenient, easily scored, and reasonably valid test 
of mechanical skills in written English. Since it 
is an easily administered test, requiring but 26 
minutes of testing time, it would seem to be an 
acceptable choice for survey purposes. 

The Intermediate form of the California 
Language Test for use in Grades VII, VIII, and IX,

is similar in structure to the Elementary form and 
requires just 2£ minutes of testing time* An 
additional section is included in the Intermediate 
form -which is designed to test knowledge of parts 
of speech. A sentence of 20 words is furnished, and 
in a five-choice multiple response exercise, the 
student is expected to indicate the part of speech 
for each word. 

Despite the claims of the authors that the 
main purpose of the California Language Test is 
to aid in the identification of specific strengths 

i *7 

and weaknesses of individual pupils, Lannholm ^ 
expresses the opinion that they TT will serve better 
as measures of general achievement than as diagnostic- 
analytic instruments.” 

In view of the fact that the Alberta survey 
was designed to measure achievement in language, 
there would appear to be no justifiable reason 
for criticizing the choice of either the Elementary 
or Intermediate forms of the California Language 
Test as suitable testing instruments. 

3. Experimental Design 

Following the administration of the tests, 
all papers were returned to the Faculty of Education, 
University of Alberta, where they were marked and

the results recorded on specially designed data 
assembly sheets. From these data sheets, frequency 
distributions were compiled for the Total I.Q., 
Language I.Q., and Non-Language I.Q. scores obtained 
by all Grade IV and Grade VII pupils participating 
in the study. In the case of each sample, the 
arithmetic means, standard deviations, and standard 
errors were computed. 

In order to test the significance of mean 
differences exhibited between samples the mean dif¬ 
ferences, standard errors of the differences, and the 
critical ratios were determined. The critical ratio 
values were tested against Garrett’s Table 29 • At 

the .01 level of confidence, the null hypothesis was 
retained for critical ratios less than 2.5$; and at 
the .05 level of confidence, the null hypothesis 
was retained for critical ratios less than 1.96. 

The variability exhibited by the different 
samples was determined by finding the differences 
in standard deviations, from which the critical 
ratio values were calculated. These, in turn, 
were tested against the null hypothesis for any 
evidence of significance of differences. 

Comparison of the Total I.Q. scores and 
Total Language scores for boys and girls was made

on the basis of the significance of mean differences* 
Similarly, the English, French, Ukranian and Other 
language groups were compared by the method described 
above* The reliability of the difference between 
standard deviations is a matter of prime importance 
in considering race and sex differences. In both 
cases the differences in variability were determined 
and found to exhibit a profound influence on the 
results of this study* 

The product-moment coefficents of correlation 

were calculated between Total I*Q* and Total Language 

scores for the Grade VII children tested in each sample 

to determine the degree of relationship existing 

between intelligence and language achievement. The 

reliability of the correlation coefficients was 

tested against the null hypothesis according to 

LQ 

Garrett’s Formula 53 , and reference to his Table 

29 50 . 

As a further test of the reliability of the 

coefficients of correlation, they were tested 

against the hypothesis that the sample values of r 

were drawn from the same population. The computed 

51 

t-values were referred to Garrett T s Table 29 for 
any evidence of significant differences. 

It should be mentioned, finally, that through-

out this study, intelligence and language achievement 
are represented by the raw scores obtained. All 
conclusions, therefore, have been arrived at on a 
basis of the significance of mean differences and 
correlations of raw rather than transmuted scores.

CHAPTER IV 


DATA ON INTELLIGENCE 

Since most intelligence tests are highly 
dependent on the use of language, it is difficult 

to know how accurate a measure they may be. 

52 

Strickland makes the statement that tT a child 
with a good command of language should score better 
than a child with a poor command of language, but 
how completely his intelligence is responsible for 
that command of language is difficult to ascertain.” 

1. Comparison of Mean Intelligence Scores 

It has already been recognized that environ¬ 
mental factors exert a profound influence upon the 
scores obtained on both intelligence tests and tests 
of language achievement. In relation to intelligence, 
Wellman ^3 points out that although within the general 
population the mean I.Q. does not vary with age, 
differences appear in the case of children from 
different types of backgrounds. There seems to be 
real evidence in the results of the present investi¬ 
gation to support this suggestion. 

A comparison of the mean scores attained by 
five randomly chosen samples of Alberta children in 
Grades IV and VII on the California Short-Form Test 
of Mental Maturity, Elementary, 1950, S-Form, is

noted from a study of this table is the disparity of 
scores obtained by urban and rural pupils. Total I.Q. 
scores place the five samples in this order: Large 
Urban, Small Urban, Town, Graded Rural, and Ungraded 
Rural. The same order maintains for Non-Language I.Q. 
scores. The only exception to this sequence in 
standing occurs in the case of Language I.Q. scores 
where the Large Urban and Small Urban samples appear 
interchanged in position. The mean differences in 
scores between the highest and lowest in each case 
is as follows';. Total I.Q., 9*96; Language I.Q., 

10.20; and Non-Language I.Q., 9*44. 

The relative differences in the mean intelligence 
scores obtained by all five samples is shown in Figure 
I by means of a comparative bar graph. Considering

each sample independently, it is of interest to note 
that in the case of the Large Urban, Small Urban and 
Town samples, the differences between Language I.Q. 
and Non-Language I.Q. are but slight as compared with 
the Graded Rural and Ungraded Rural samples. In 
apparent agreement with other research findings, it 
would seem that rural children obtain notably higher 
non-verbal I.Q. scores than they do verbal I.Q. 
scores. With urban and town children, these dif¬ 
ferences are less extreme. There appears to be 
adequate evidence from the results of this study to 
support the assertion made by Shepard 54 that city 
children usually surpass country children in verbal- 
type mental tests. 

To determine the significance of the mean 
differences already noted, the critical ratios were 
computed for the total I.Q. scores as shown in Table VI.

An examination of this table reveals a highly 
significant defference between the mean Total I.Q. 
scores of urban and rural children in Alberta, By 
making reference to Garrett T s Table 29 it will 
be seen that in samples of this size a t-value 
greater than 2,59 may be considered significant at 
the ,01 level. That is to say, only once in a hundred 
trials would critical ratios as large as 2,59 occur 
due to errors of sampling. We may conclude with con¬ 
fidence that there are real differences existent between 
the Total I.Q, scores obtained by the Large Urban, 

Small Urban and Town samples on one hand, and the 
Graded Rural and Ungraded Rural Samples on the other. 

From a study of Table VII, it will be noted 
that exactly the same results obtain for mean Language 
I.Q. scores as was found for mean Total I.Q. scores.

In considering the Non-Language I.Q. scores 
obtained by the five samples, somewhat less sig¬ 
nificant differences are to be observed as revealed 
in Table VIII. The large Urban sample is seen to

maintain a consistent superiority over the Graded Rural 
and Ungraded Rural samples, as evidenced by critical 
ratios of 3.79 and 7.32 respectively. In neither the 
case of Small Urban nor Town comparisons are the mean 
scores in Non-Language I.Q. significantly different 
from those obtained by the Graded Rural sample. It 
must be further noted that, though the mean score 
differences in Non-Language I.Q. between the Ungraded 
Rural sample and the other four samples are quite 
significantly in their favour, the degree of dif¬ 
ference in each case is considerably less substantial 
than that obtained for either Language I.Q. or Total 
I.Q.

As a result of this investigation, there 
appears to be sufficient evidence to support the 
claim that rural pupils in Alberta schools achieve 
higher scores on tests of mental ability when the 
test items do not involve a knowledge of words and 
how to use them* 

2. Reliability of Mean Intelligence Scores 
The reliability of a mean score can be shown 
to depend upon two characteristics of the distribution: 
(a) the size of the sample being considered, and (b) 
the variability of the separate scores around the 
mean. 56 With sample sizes ranging from 297 in the 
case of the Small Urban sample to 424 in the case of 
the Town sample, there would seem to be no reason for 
questioning the reliability of the means on the grounds 
that the samples used in this study were insufficiently 
large* For consideration of the variability of the 
obtained scores reference is made to Table IX below.

The authors of the California Short-Form Test 
of Mental Maturity state that the standard deviation 
of the standardization group was 16 points. In the 
present study, the standard deviations for Total I.Q. 
scores range between 13.$3 and 14*93. This decrease 
in standard deviations in the Alberta samples would 
seem to imply an increase in the reliability of the 
mean scores attained by the five samples of Alberta 
children. 

The significance of the difference between 
the largest and smallest standard deviations recorded 
for all three separate intelligence scores obtained 
by Alberta pupils are presented in Table X.

Computation of the significance of difference 
between the Total I.Q. standard deviations for Large 
Urban and Graded Rural samples renders a critical ratio 
of 1.60. By referring to Garrett’s Table 29 $ 7 , it

will be seen that a t-value of 1.96 is required to 
indicate a significant difference at the .05 level 
of confidence, and 2.5$ at the .01 level of con¬ 
fidence. Obviously, then, the variability factor 
does not significantly affect the reliability of the 
mean Total I.Q. scores reported in this study. 

There is, on the other hand, evidence of some 
unreliability in the reported mean Language I.Q. scores 
and mean Non-Language I.Q. scores. A critical ratio 
of 2.5$ would suggest ’a significant difference at the 
.01 level between Large Urban and Small Urban Language 
I.Q. scores. Similarly, a critical ratio of 1.99 
indicates a significant difference at the .05 level 
between Town and Ungraded Rural Non-Language I.Q. 
scores. 

Since the main consideration here lies in a 
comparison of urban and rural intelligence scores, 
neither of the above significant differences tend 
to influence the general conclusions herein stated. 

The more pertinent finding would appear to be that 
the reliability of the mean Total I.Q. scores is not 
affected by the variability of the scores. 

3. Correlation Between Intelligence and 
Language Achievement 

Numerous investigations have shown the sub¬ 
stantial positive correlation between tested intel-

ligence and academic achievement. As has been 
previously stated the coefficients of correlation 
vary from one study to another. In the present 
study the coefficients of correlation between Total 
I.Q. scores and Total Language scores for the five 
Alberta samples of Grade VII pupils tested range from 
.54 to .76, as shown in Table XI. 

The coefficients computed for Town, Graded Rural 
and Ungraded Rural samples appear to correspond quite 
favourably. However, the reliability of the Large 
Urban and Small Urban scores would seem questionable.

To obtain a more generalized picture of the relation¬ 
ship between the variables being measured, the writer 
averaged the coefficients for the two urban samples 
and arrived at a correlation coefficient of . 67 . This 
will be seen to bear correspondence with the coef¬ 
ficients obtained for the other three samples. Though 
averaging coefficients of correlation may be considered

a dubious procedure it is, nevertheless, interesting 
to note that the coefficient obtained by averaging 
all five samples was .66. 

The reliability of a coefficient of correlation 
may be tested against the null hypothesis that the 
computed coefficient does not depart significantly 
from zero. By means of the formula 



t 



- r^ 


(Where r represents the coefficient of correlation, 
and N is the size of the sample) the writer arrived 
at the t-values tabulated in Table XII. Referring

be noted that in every case the correlation coef¬

may conclude that the null hypothesis is disproved, 
and that the obtained coefficients of correlation 
are highly significant in their departure from zero. 

As a further test of the reliability of the 
difference between coefficients of correlation, the 
significance of the difference between coefficients 
was computed by means of the formula 



where and N 2 represent the respective sample sizes, 

and where Z - \ log e 1 -f r . By comparing the t-values 

1 - r 

thus obtained with those presented in Garrett T s 
Table 29 it is possible to test the hypothesis 
that the five sample values of r are drawn from the 
same population. Table XIII reveals a significant

knowing all five samples to have been drawn from the 
Grade VII population of Alberta school children, there 
are differences in the relationship between intelligence 
and language achievement for the above mentioned samples 
which are attributable to errors other than those of 
sampling, and significantly different to what might be 
expected as the result of the operations of chance. 

4. Summary of Findings 

1. In agreement with other similar studies, 
urban children demonstrate a definite superiority over 
rural children in verbal-type mental tests. On the 
California Short-Form Test of Mental Maturity the 
town and urban school children of Alberta scored sub¬ 
stantially higher than the children from rural schools* 

2. With the exception of the Small Urban sample, 
when the Non-Language I.Q* scores for the five Alberta 
samples are compared with the Language I.Q* and Total 
I.Q. scores, Alberta children are found to reach a 
higher level of attainment on the Non-Language section 
of the California Short-Form Test of Mental Maturity. 

It is shown graphic all}? - in Figure I that this 
superiority of non-verbal over verbal intelligence 
is more evident in the case of rural samples than in 
the case of town and urban samples*

samples, with the mean scores established for the 
standardization group, would seem to reveal exceed¬ 
ingly favourable results. With the sole exception 
of the Ungraded Rural sample, Alberta children 
appear to demonstrate a substantial superiority in 
measured intelligence. Even in the case of the Un¬ 
graded Rural sample, the departure from that of the 
standardization group is not sufficient to be con¬ 
sidered significant. 

4. When the Total I.Q. standard deviations 
for the five samples of Alberta children are compared 
with those of the standardization group, the reli¬ 
ability of the mean scores is found to be unaffected 
by the variability of the scores. In view of the fact 
that the variance is found to be homogeneous in com¬ 
paring samples of adequate size, this result would 
seem to be valid. 

5. Substantial positive correlations are 
found to exist between tested intelligence and 
language achievement for the five samples of Grade 
VII Alberta children. By averaging the correlation 
coefficients an r of .66 was obtained, which seems 
to indicate a marked relationship between the scores 
obtained on the California Short-Form Test of Mental 
Maturity and the California Language Test. The

obtained coefficients of correlation are found to be 
highly significant at the .01 level when tested against 
the null hypothesis. 

6 . In comparing the significance of the dif¬ 
ference between correlation coefficients, there appear 
to be significant differences existing between the 
Large Urban and Small Urban samples, as well as between 
the Large Urban and Graded Rural samples, which are 
not attributable to accidents of sampling.

CHAPTER V 


DATA ON SEX DIFFERENCES 

In a review of the literature dealing with sex 
differences, it has been recognized that girls show a 
consistently marked superiority over boys in language 
achievement, but that no measurable degree of dif¬ 
ference is to be found where mental growth and intel¬ 
ligence are concerned, 

1. Choice of Samples 

It is a fact of extreme importance that any 
application of sampling theory is valid only to the 
degree that the samples are randomly selected, to 
assure the choice of representative and unbiased 
samples of both boys and girls in this study, the 
writer adopted the use of a table of "random numbers TT . 
The particular table used is to be found on pages 
262 to 264 , inclusive, of "Statistical Analysis in 
Educational Research" by E. F, Lindquist 60. 

2 . Intelligence 

Longitudinal studies involving the repeated 
testing of the same children over the entire period 
of maturation indicate that the mental growth of boys 
and girls progresses uniformly and with a very com¬ 
parable degree of intellectual equality. Rusk 61

a study of the intelligence of Scottish children, 
found no appreciable sex differences in the mean 
scores attained by £74 subjects when the factor of 
sampling inequality was eliminated. It has been 
reported by several investigators that intelligence 
is now considered to display no well-defined advantage 
to either sex. 

Since in the present study a special effort was 
made to assure a reliably random selection of subjects, 
it is believed that the findings may be considered valid. 
The basis of comparison is the Total I.Q. scores 
obtained on the California Short-Form Test of Mental 
Maturity, Elementary, 1950, S-Form. 

A comparison of the mean scores of boys and 
girls is shown in Table XIV.

By making reference to Garrett’s Table 29 , 

it was found that the critical ratio, or t-value, would 
need to reach 1.97 to be significant at the .05 level. 
This is the equivalent of saying that only five times 
in a hundred trials would a critical ratio as large 
as 1.97 occur due to accidents of sampling* Since 
the computed t-value is only 0.64, it may be concluded 
with a high degree of confidence that there is no 
real difference between the mean Total I.Q. scores 
of Alberta boys and girls on the California Short- 
Form Test of Mental Maturity. 

A graphic representation of the insignificant 
difference in Total I.Q. scores is revealed by an 
examination of the cumulative percentage curves shown 
in Figure 2. One can, nevertheless, make certain 
observations with respect to the small variations 
which do exist. It is interesting to note that the 
girls demonstrate a slight superiority over the boys

in the I. Q. range from 72 to 97* From 97 to 112 the 
scores are practically identical; but beyond 112 the 
boys show slight superiority over the girls# The 
comparisons made in this study have to do with total 
intelligence scores# Results obtained on performance 
scales of intelligence give similar evidence to that 
provided above# When intelligence tests of a strictly 
verbal nature are used in comparing sex differences, 
girls tend to be consistently superior# The verbal 
features of the California Short-Form Test of Mental 
Maturity may be suggested as being responsible for 
the apparent slight, though non-significant, super¬ 
iority of the girls tested in this survey# 

3* Achievement in Language 

Girls early show greater facility with speech 
than do boys, and they regularly develop larger vocab¬ 
ularies# Scholastic achievement scores provide plenty 
of evidence to show that ”girls usually excel in oral 
and silent reading, language usage, spelling, and 
handwriting”. ^3 From the foregoing statement, it should 
not be too surprising to learn that nn the California 
Language Test the girls of Alberta demonstrated a highly 
significant superiority over the boys at the Grade VII 
level#

Distribution of Total Language Scores Obtained by Random 
Samples of Alberta Boys and Girls in Grade Seven. 

















Language Scores of 6.05. The ogive representation 
of the achievement of the two sexes is shown in 
Figure 3. The boys T lowest score on the California 
Language Test is a full 10 points below the girls 1 
lowest score. At no place in the distribution do 
the boys appear to gain discernibly on the girls 
until the end, when the eleven best girls T scores 
are matched by only two boys’ scores. 

To determine the significance of superiority 
of the girls in this study, the critical ratio was 
determined and found to be 5.66, as shown in Table 
XV. Referring to Garrett T s Table 29 ^4, a t-value 
of 5.66 is discovered to be very highly significant 
at the .01 level. Only once in a hundred cases 
would a critical ratio as large as 2.59 occur because 
of chance. The magnitude of the calculated critical 
ratio is such that it leaves little doubt as to the 
substantial sex difference in language achievement 
in favour of the girls. 

In attempting to rationalize the inferiority of 
boys in language mastery, reviewers variously offer 
such reasons as slower rate of maturation, lack of mot¬ 
ivation in verbal situations, and greater interest in 
extra-curricular pursuits. It is probably true that 
such factors may be operative in Alberta to the same

extent that they may be elsewhere, but in no way does 
the present investigation suggest that such is the 
case* Only one definite conclusion appears to be 
tenable. On the California Language Test the girls 
definitely excel. 

4* Variability 

Since it may be assumed that the size of both 
the boys* and girls 1 samples are sufficiently large not 
to influence the stability of the mean scores obtained 
on either of the tests administered, there remains but 
one factor to consider, namely, the variability of the 
separate measures around the mean. As the standard 
deviation decreases, the reliability is found to increase. 

It has been stated that the median I. Q. for 
Grade VII on the California Short-Form Test of Mental 
Maturity was set by the authors at 100. The standard 
deviation was 16 points. Table XVI shows the standard 
deviations of Alberta boys and girls as 14*53 and 12.$£ 
respectively. This decrease in standard deviations

would suggest an increase in the reliability of the 
means of both samples over the standardization group.

Computation of the significance of the difference 
between standard deviations in total intelligence scores 
for boys and girls results in a critical ratio of 1.70 
as indicated in Table XVII. Thus it may be stated

that the variability factor does not significantly in¬

Similarly, in considering the reliability of 
the highly significant difference in mean Total Lan¬ 
guage scores on the California Language Test, the 
critical ratio of 1.69, as shown in Table XVII is 
inconsequential. It may be concluded that the find¬ 
ings of this portion of the present investigation 
appear to meet the required tests of reliability and 
may thus be accepted as valid. 

5. Summary of Findings 
1. Statistical evidence supports the general 
claim of research workers that there are no measurable 
sex differences with respect to intelligence. The mean

Total I.Q. T s for Grade Vii boys and girls on the 
California Short-Form Test of Mental Maturity were 
102.90 and 103*73, respectively. The difference of 
these means was found to be not significant at the .05 
level. 

2. Examination of the graphic comparison of 
I.Q. f s suggests that throughout the average range, the 
scores of boys and girls are practically identical. 

In the TT below average” distribution of I.Q. f s, the 
girls T scores are slightly superior to those of the 
boys. For the ”above average” distribution, the girls T 
scores were slightly inferior to those of the boys. 
However, these differences are so slight as to be 
attributable to accidents of sampling. 

3. In language achievement, Grade VII girls 
demonstrate a highly significant superiority over the 
boys. The mean difference in Total Language scores 
was found to be 6.05* When subjected to the usual 
test of reliability this difference yields a critical 
ratio of 5.66. A critical ratio value of this mag¬ 
nitude enables one to say with confidence that the 
mean difference is real, and not attributable to 
accidents of sampling. 

4. Not only is there a substantial mean dif¬ 
ference, but girls are consistently superior to the

boys throughout the entire range and distribution 
of scores. Only two boys attained raw scores 
comparable to the eleven best girls ! scores. 

5. In both intelligence and language achieve¬ 
ment, the reliabilities of the mean differences are 
found to be unaffected by the variability of the 
scores obtained. The differences in standard deviations 
yield calculated critical ratios of 1.70 and 1.69 
respectively. These results, coupled with the fact that 
the sample sizes may be considered sufficiently large, 
would suggest that the above findings are valid.

CHAPTER VI 


DATA ON BILINGUALISM 

The effect of a non-English home life upon 
the language achievement of Alberta pupils consti¬ 
tuted a major problem in the present investigation* 
Strickland ^5 observes that "whether learning two 
languages in the child T s early years is more of an 
asset than a liability in ultimate language develop¬ 
ment is a question which has been long discussed." 
Though evidence of the effect of bilingualism on 
achievement in language is not entirely clear, it 
does appear true that a bilingual environment tends 
to handicap progress in school subjects -— partic¬ 
ularly retardation in language development. 

1. Choice of Samples 

Before considering the data relating to 
bilingualism which was derived from the Alberta 
survey of language achievement, the matter of sample 
selection had to be settled. 

The larger sampling of Alberta Children 
participating in the Faculty Reading-Language Survey 
has been described in detail elsewhere.^ For the 
smaller study of the intelligence and achievement in 
language of monoglot and bilingual groups, the writer

had recourse to Lindquist’s table of random numbers 
From the 940 boys and girls of the Grade VII sample, 
200 children who spoke English only were randomly 
chosen* Three other samples were considered for 
comparison: French, Ukranian, and Other. Because 
of the limited number of pupils who listed a language 
other than English as being the principal language 
spoken in the home, it was deemed advisable to use 
every case of this type in the selected sample. The 
result revealed a Grade VII sample of 36 children 
who gave French as the chief language spoken at home, 
36 children who claimed Ukranian as the principal 
language spoken in the home, and a sample of 59 
children in whose homes a language other than English, 
French, or Ukranian was the principal language spoken. 

2. Intelligence 

It has already been noted that the findings 
of research workers seem to indicate that bilingual 
children tend to be retarded on verbal tests of 
mental ability. On non-verbal tests involving per¬ 
ceptual skills or motor performance, differences have 
been found to be less apparent. The implication is 
that tests of verbal intelligence favor monoglot 
pupils, but that on performance tests, bilingual 
pupils appear to be at no disadvantage. This seemsi

to have been borne out by Arsenian -who, in a 
study of 277$ Italian and Jewish children in New 
York schools, concluded that Tt bilingualism does not 
influence the mental development of children. TT 

The present investigation makes no attempt to 
compare either the Language I.Q. or the Non-Language 
I.Q. scores obtained on the California Short Form 
Test of Mental Maturity, but it does attempt to 
test the significance of mean differences in Total 
I.Q. scores. A comparison of the mean Total I.Q. 
scores for the various samples tested is presented 
in Tables XVIII and XIX, In an effort to compare 
the various samples individually, the mean Total 
I.Q. scores were computed as shown in Table XVIII.

The writer felt that by combining the bilingual

between the English and Non-English groups. Table XIX

A graphic representation of the superiority • 
of English children over bilingual children is shown 
in Figure 4* The cumulative percentage curves 
depicted in Figure 5 present even more vividly the 
substantially higher mean intelligence scores attained 
by the English and Non-English samples. 

In order to determine whether or not the mean 
differences tabulated were significant, the critical 
ratios were calculated as shown in Tables XX and XXI 
By.reference to Garrett T s Table 29 It will be 
seen that for the number involved critical ratios of 
the magnitude of 2.95 f 5*56, and 4*9$ are highly 
significant at the .01 level. However, it must not

confidently conclude that very real differences in

differences between the three bilingual groups are 
roughly equal.

of the English and Non-English groups in favor of 
the English group. Such a difference is found to 
reveal a critical ratio of 6.66 which is very highly 
significant at the .01 level of confidence. 

From the results of this study there seems to 
be adequate evidence to support the conclusion that, 
taken individually and for the children selected, the 
French, Ukranian, and Other samples show no significant 
differences in intelligence as revealed by the 
California Short Test of Mental Maturity. On the 
other hand, the English sample appears to demonstrate 
a distinct superiority over each of the other samples 
in tested intelligence. The linguistic advantage 
enjoyed by English children is probably an impor¬ 
tant factor contributing to their superiority on 
the English language test used in this study. 

3® Achievement in Language 

It has been recognized by various investigators 
that children from non-English homes suffer a distinct 
handicap in school progress, and that this handicap 
is greater in language than in any other field. The 
reason is usually attributed to the fact that these 
children speak a language other than English at 
almost all times outside the school. It would seem 
reasonable to sugg est that a child who is obliged

to learn two languages at the same time will 
progress more slowly in the new language than he 
would if he were utilizing only one language* 

From a review of the results obtained on 
the California Language Test by the Grade VII 
children comprising the four samples being compared 
in the present investigation, there is little doubt 
as to the superiority of the English group. Table 
XVIII presents the mean Total Language scores for 
all samples. It will be noted that they rank in 
the following order: English, French, Other, and 
Ukranian. 

When the three bilingual groups are combined, 
and the English and Non-English samples are com¬ 
pared, a marked difference in Total Language scores 
is found to exist, favoring the English sample. A 
critical ratio value of 4*30 as shown in Table XXI 
may be considered highly significant at the .01 
level of confidence. 

An ogive comparison of the English and 
bilingual groups is presented in Figure 6. Perhaps 
a clearer picture of the superiority of the children 
from homes in which English is spoken may be obtained 
by an examination of Figure 7* Here it is shown that 
a raw score difference of 25 points separates the 
lowest scores of the English and Non-English groups.

To this may be added the fact that only one student 
out of 131 in the Non-English group obtained a score 
equal to the eight highest scores of the English 
group. 

The significance of the differences in mean 
Total Language scores for the English and bilingual 
samples can be found in Table XXII. Here it will be 
noted that significant differences appear in three

in Garrett T s Table 29 ^ to be significant at the .05 
level. Only five times in a hundred cases would a 
critical ratio of such size be obtained because of 
the operations of chance. Critical ratios of the 
magnitude of 4.40, 2.85, and 2.57 are not to be 
considered due to errors in sampling. It may be 
stated with confidence, that at the .05 level 
real differences exist between the English and

Ukranian, the French and Ukranian, and the English and 
Other samples* 

This study seems to suggest that with the 
exception of the French group, bilingual pupils in 
Alberta fail to achieve results in language comparable 
to the English group. 

4. Size and Variability of Samples 

Despite the fact that all possible cases were 
included in the bilingual samples, it must be admitted 
that the sizes of these samples are not to be consid¬ 
ered adequate. Garrett 71 explains that TT a mean based 
upon thirty-six cases is only twice as reliable as a 
mean based on nine cases." The bilingual samples in 
this survey would have been much more reliable if 
they had been four or five times as large. Such is 
not true of the English groups, however, where a 
sample size of 200 may be considered adequate. 

It is not possible to say to what extent the 
sample sizes affect the reliability of the mean dif¬ 
ferences obtained. It is possible, however, to 
consider the variability of the separate measures 
around the different sample means computed. 

A comparison of the standard deviations 
for the English and bilingual samples is shown in 
Table XXIII.

Since none of the critical ratio values derived

The degree to which the variability of the 
Total Language scores affects the reliability of 
the mean differences already discussed is a matter 
for final consideration in this study. From Table 
XXVII it is seen that critical ratio values of 3.39 
and 3.23 were found between the English and Other 
samples, and between the French and Other samples.

Since these critical ratio values are found to be 
significant at the .01 level of confidence, It may be 
suggested that the reliability of the mean differences 
between these samples is questionable. 

There is further evidence in Table XXVI to 
question the reliability of* the mean differences 
in Total Language scores for English and Non-English 
groups. At the .01 level, a critical ratio of 3.41 

is found to be significant.

It would seem correct to conclude that the 
mean score differences obtained by English and 
bilingual children on the California Short-Form Test 
of Mental Maturity are reliable. However, on the 
California Language Test, the mean score differences 
obtained by English and Bilingual children appear 
to be less valid. 

5. Summary of Findings 

1. When subjected to the appropriate 
statistical tests, the data produced in this study 
reveal that children from homes in which only 
English is spoken obtain substantially higher scores 
on the California Short-Form Test of Mental Maturity 
than do bilingual children. The mean Total I.Q. 
scores for the English and Non-English samples dif¬ 
fered by 9.66. This is found to be highly significant 
at the .01 level of confidence. 

2. Considered separately the bilingual 
samples evidence no significant differences in 
measured intelligence. When each is compared to 
the English sample the mean score differences are 
found to significantly favor the children from homes 
in which English is spoken. 

3. On the California Language Test, Inter¬ 
mediate, Form AA, the English sample would seem to

further demonstrate its superiority over samples of 
bilingual children used in this study* When the 
English and Non-English groups are compared, the 
mean score difference is 5*94# Such a difference 
is highly significant at the .01 level of confidence. 
This result must be qualified, however, on the 
grounds that the reliability of mean differences 
between these two groups is affected by the variability 
of the scores and by the smallness of the samples* 

4. In comparing the various samples individ¬ 
ually with each other, again the English sample is 
found to achieve a higher mean Total Language score 
than any of the other samples. In the case of the 
Ukranian and Other groups, the superiority demonstrat¬ 
ed is significant at the .01 level. The reliability 
of the mean score differences noted could be 
questioned here as well because of the significant 
difference between standard deviations. 

5* One of the most serious criticisms of 
the present study is that the sample sizes used 
in the bilingual comparisons are admittedly too 
small. Though it is impossible to determine the 
extent to which the results are affected, it is as¬ 
sumed that more valid findings might have been reached 
had larger samples been used.

review of the data provided by the present study 
is, that in both tested intelligence and language 
achievement mean raw score comparisons place the 
samples in this order: English, French, Other and 
Ukranian. Because of the smallness of the three 
bilingual samples, a safer generalization would be 
that the monoglot English sample proved significantly 
superior to the combined bilingual samples in both 
intelligence and language achievement*

CHAPTER VII 


CONCLUSIONS 

The purpose of this survey was to accumulate a 
body of data which would lend itself to the task of 
comparing the English language achievement of five 
stratified random samples of .Alberta children in re¬ 
lation to intelligence, sex, and bilingualism. The 
conclusions may be summarized as follows: 

lo On the California Short-Form Test of 
Rental Maturity, the urban and town school children 
of Alberta demonstrate a significant superiority in 
intelligence over children from graded rural and 
ungraded rural schools® 

2. With the exception of the Small Urban 
sample, Alberta children are found to reach a higher 
level of attainment on the Non-Language section of the 
California Short-Form Test of Mental Maturity than 

on the Language section. 

3. In comparison with the standardization 
group, the school children of Alberta appear to 
demonstrate a significant superiority in tested 
intelligence® 

4. Substantial positive correlations are 
found to exist between intelligence and language 
achievement, as measured by the California Short-Form.. 
Test of Mental Maturity and the California Language

Test, Intermediate, Form AA. The averaged coefficient 
of correlation for the five Alberta samples of Grade 
VII children is .66. 

5. On the California Short-Form Test of 
Mental Maturity, no significant sex differences in 
intelligence are found to exist for Alberta children. 

6. The Grade VTI girls of Alberta demonstrate 
a highly significant superiority over the boys on the 
California Language Test, Intermediate, Form AA. 

7. Children from homes in which English is 
the only spoken language obtain substantially higher 
scores on the California Short-Form Test of Mental 
Maturity than do children from bilingual homes. 

8. For the three bilingual samples studied, 
no significant differences in measured intelligence 
are found to exist. 

9. When the English and bilingual groups 

are compared for language achievement on the California 
Language Test, Intermediate, Form AA, the difference 
is significantly in favor of the English group. 

10. Bata derived from this investigation 
provide adequate evidence to suggest that children 
from. Alberta homes in which English is spoken attain 
higher scores than do bilingual children, on tests of 
intelligence and language achievement.

CHAPTER VIII 


IMPLICATIONS 

Designed to gather authoritative information 
concerning achievement in language, it is hoped that 
this study will constitute at least a small contribution 
to education in Alberta. From the conclusions derived, 
the following implications are presented for consideration 
1. Intelligence 

1. Due to the significantly high correlation 
between mental maturity and language achievement, real 
caution should be exercised in the degree of dependency 
placed upon verbal intelligence test scores. Particularly 
would this appear to be true in graded and ungraded rural 
situations where the language factor may well be operative 

2. In the determination of the total potential 
abilities of bilingual children, one is forced to con¬ 
clude that verbal tests of mental measurement appear 
to be inadequate. This implication does not encourage 
any suggestion of the discontinuance of the use of 
verbal tests, but does imply that for a more accurate 
evaluation of their intellectual abilities, non-verbal 
or performance tests should also be employed in testing 
bilingual students. 

2. Language Achievement 

1. Rural children appear to suffer by way of

comparison with urban and town children from a lack 
of verbal and linguistic background. To offset this 
difference, which would seem to be due basically to 
socio-economic and environmental factors, a language 
program designed to provide for the linguistic needs 
and deficiencies of rural pupils is suggested. 

2. This study confirms the already well- 
established fact that girls maintain a significant 
superiority over boys in language achievement. Perhaps 
this may be compensated for by the fact that evidence 
suggests the superiority of boys over girls in math¬ 
ematics and the sciences. In neither case does it 
appear to be a serious enough situation to warrant 
special concern. Nevertheless, with reference to 
language, the relative achievement of boys and girls 
should be recognized by teachers. It is suggested 
that every effort should be made in appealing to the 
special needs and interests of boys in the planning 
and preparation of the language program. 

3. Since children of foreign parentage appear 
to suffer a very definite handicap in English, a plan 
for remedial teaching might be evolved with particular 
emphasis on spoken and written language. Where the 
number of foreign speaking children in Alberta schools 
has increased so steadily in post-war years, such a 
policy would seem to be both desirable and defensible.

Certainly the findings of this study point in the 
direction of a need on the part of bilingual students 
for special assistance in the mastery of the basic 
English language skills. 

4* A major responsibility of our schools lies 
in a consideration of the experiential, cultural, and 
informational backgrounds of bilingual students. Ad¬ 
justing teaching methods and procedures to the needs of 
bilingual pupils ought to be a part of the school T s 
responsibility in providing for individual differences. 

5* Wherever the need for improvement in language 
is suggested by the results of this study, certain general 
implications appear to be noteworthy. Regardless of 
whether it is with reference to boys, bilinguists, or 
rural pupils, the schools of Alberta need to provide 
meaningful language experiences which emphasize correct 
usage and practice in the mastery of the basic language 
skills. Perhaps in this regard some of the most important 
factors to be kept in mind are the social, cultural, economic, 
and environmental influences contacted by these children. 

6. Finally, the important provision for the 
exemplification of acceptable oral and written language 
standards by parents, and more particularly by teachers, 
is fundamental to the improvement of English usage by 


all children
