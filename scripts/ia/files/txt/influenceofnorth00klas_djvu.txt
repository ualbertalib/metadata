ABSTRACT 


Observations vrere made on two appearances of adult mosquitoes in 
the river valley within the city of Edmonton® These appearances are 
unusual in that they occurred in the center of an area in which larvae 
were killed. 

During the week preceding May 17# 1958 large numbers of mosquitoes, 
mostl y Aedes cataphylla Dyar appeared;and during the week preceding 
June 3# 1958 large numbers of mosquitoes, mostly of Aedes fitchii Fo(fc Y,, 
Aedes excruoians Wlk, and Aedes stimulans Wlk® appeared in the above 
mentioned section of the river valley. The route of entry of mosquitoes 
into the city was determined from a consideration of wind data from those 
hours when extreme environmental conditions would not suppress spontaneous 
mosquito activity, from a consideration of optomotor theory, vertical 
distribution, energy requirements of flight, distribution of adult mosquitoes 
within the city and from a meteorological study of the study area. The 
river valley was found to be a favourable and the only possible route of 
mosquito movement into the city of Edmonton© 

Some extensions to optcmotor theory were made©

1. GENERAL SECTION- REVIEV/ OF LITERATURE 


1.1. DISPERSION; HISTORICAL. 

The dispereion of insects has been the subject of much work and 
speculation. Wolfenbdrger (I946) wrote an extensive review of this subject. 
This author also fitted the data which he reviewed with empirical 
mathematical relationships relating the density of insects to distance 
from their source. Kettle (1950) studied the dispersion of the midge 
Culicoides impunotatus Goetghebuer and also fitted the regression of numbers 
of midges with distance from source with an empirical mathematical expression. 
Further Kettle stated that the decrease in density was due to two separate 
processes: 1) Dilution - the spreading of a population over an area of 
increasing magnitude. 

2) Mortality - the death or going to earth of some adults. 

Wadley (1957) discussed in detail the assumptions underlying mathematical 
equations of dispersion - as Andrewartha and Birch^had done in lesser 
detail© 

Dispersion of leaf hoppers was treated as a random process by Frampton 
et (1942) -who also derived an equation based on this assumption. Dobzhansky 
and Wright (1943) from their study of Drosophila psuedoobscura"' concluded 
that dispersion is random with respect to direction and to other members 
of the population. Davidson and Andrewartha (1948) from their study on 
Thrips imaginis concluded that ’’the activity of the thrips in seeking new 
placea to live was independent of the density of the population and by 
inference equally independent of any external stimuli...” 

It has been shown however that movements of at least some insects :may 


not be considered random. Several books have been written on the

orientacion and direcced movements or animals; most recen-oiy Fraeniiel 
and Gunn (1940) and Oarthy (1958) iiave written treatises on this subject. 

Kennedy (1939) showed that Aedes aegypti females orient upwind when flying 
at certain windspeeds and heights aoove the background, and under a difierent 
set of conditions orient and fly downwind. Kennedy also described other 
flight responses of Aedes aegypti , and in his 1951 paper he extended this 
optomotor theory of flight regulation to all combinations of heights 
above the background and windspeeds. The work of Kalmus (1948) lends 
support to Kennedy*s theory. Orientation to wind has been described 
from field observations by Kennedy (1951) in locusts. The orientation 
of hovering insects to wind has been described by numerous authors. 

(Nielsen and Greve, 1950; Downes, 1958) 

Much information has been accumulated regarding the passive transport 
of insects by wind. That insects may be transported long distances by 
wind, and that meteorological processes cannot be ignored in the study of 
insect dispersion is established. (Coad, 1931; Elton, 1925; Felt, 1925> 

1926, 1928, 1938; Freeman, 1945; Glick, 1939> 1957; Greenbank, 1956; 

Hardy and Milne, 1937^ 1938a, 1938b; Henson, 1951; Smith et al, 1956; 
Wellington, 1945a, 1945b, 1945c.) 

Clearly the movement of insects which orient to a fairly constant 
stimulus and the movement of insects transported en masse by wind will 
transgress the theoretical or empirical mathematical relationships described. 

To understand dispersion in such cases one must know something about 
intrinsic flight ranges, and orienting mechanisms and meteorological 
processes. 

The flight range of mosquitoes and other insects has been studied

worker has devised and successfully employed an intrinsic method of measuring 
the distance an insect can fly between feedings. He demonstrated that 
many Aedes mosquitoes can fly between 30 to 40 air-miles between 
feedings. It is obvious, however, that the displacement of a flying 
insect in the field will not only depend on the energy supply, but also on 
the environmental factors which orient the insect, the insect*s behavior in 
relation to the direction of the wind and the insect*s air-speed. Moreover 
to predict the movement of an insect in -che field one must possess a knowledge 
of the insect*s reactions to various environmental variables, and especially 
to those which influence the displacement of the insect* 

Much of the literature before 1944 on dispersion patterns and flight 
ranges of mosquitoes has been reviewed by iiyles (1944). Table 1 is based 
on his review. The available literature not included in the review by 
Syles and that published after 1944 is summarized in Table 2. Only those 
papers containing meteorological information are included in these tables. 

In order to determine the ini'luence of wind on dispersion, fairly 
high recoveries are required. Msiny authors have pointed out that their data 
were too inadequate to draw binding conclusions. The tables indicate 
that mosquitoes flew in all directions with respect to the wind as 
measured at one point. However in most instances the greatest numbers of 
mosquitoes were recovered downwind. Usually those taken several miles 
from the source apparently went downwind. In instances where upwind 
flight was more marked than downwind flight, wixidspeeds if given were 
quite low.

1.2. OPTOMOTQR THEORY AND DISPERSION. 

1.2.1. The Optomotor Theory of Insect Behavior in Relation to Windspeed 
and Height. 

The relationship between wind and mosquito behavior is complex. 

However optomotor theory has been extended to deal with a mosquito*s behavior 
at all heights above the ground and at all wind speeds. Kalmus (1948) 
suggested that movement across an insect‘s retinal element is resolved into 
two vectors: a translational vector parallel to the insect*s longitudinal 
axis, and a rotational vector perpendicular to the insect's longitudinal 
axis. The insect's brain sums over the whole visual field all the 
translational vector components from all retinal elements to give the 
"apparent translation", and the insect's brain sums over the whole visual 
field the rotational vector components from all retinal elements to give 
the ^apparent rotation^" R. Further the insect usually behaves in such a 
manner that the sum of the rotational vectors ("apparent rotation") R 
is zero. Explicitly transverse mobion is not tolerated (Fig. l). 

Kennedy (1940, 1951) found that Aedes aegypti females, 10 cm. above a 
stationary background, orient into the wind when the wind velocity nears 
10 cm./sec. We can derive from Kalmus* theory that insects orient into the 
wind because this response makes the sum of the rotational vector components 
zero. Kennedy's experiment shows that females of Aedes aeg^^ti require 
minimal stimulatory rotational retinal angular velocity of less than 1 
radian per second. If a mosquito travels at a given ground velocity, the 
apparent velocity of the images is inversely proportional to the height of the 
mosquito above the ground. Thus if the mosquito is near the ground, the 
objects appear to move faster than if the mosquito is at a greater altitude. 

A mosquito flying under these conditions, but across wind, could climb to a 
height above which the apparent movement across the ommatidia (rotational 
vector) would be less than the minimum stimulatory rotational retinal

_P- Vector of movement 

Fig> I, Resolution of the vector of movement by an insect according 
to the theory of Kalraus. The circle represents a ventral view of 
an insect's head with a line between the eyes. The vector of move¬ 
ment and its concernents are shown on each eye* The arrow outside of 
the circle indicates the directiem in which the insect will rotate 
to make the rotational vectors zero. 
















velocity (Fig* 2), Kennedy (1951) calls this height the ’'maximum compensatory 
height,” because above this height the mosquito, regardless of its 
orientation, will never receive an adequately strong stimulus to make it 
orient to the wind* i*e* to respond in such a manner that the rotational 
vector will become zero. This maximum compensatory height, may be 
calculated from the expression where is the transverse 

component of the mosquito's ground velocity ( ^ wind velocity) andCu.^ is a 
constant, the minimum stimulatory rotational angular velocity* It must be 
clearly understood that this expression pertains to the rotational vector 
of relative motion and not to the translational vector of relative motion* 
Kennedy also found that Aedes aegypti females 10 cm* above the 
stationary oackground controlled their airspeed so that regardless of the 
windspeed, the translational ground velocity of the mosquitoes was 17 cm*/sec* 
This experiment suggests that mosquitoes have a preferred translational 
velocity* Emphasis must be laid on the fact that the rotational and 
translational velocities are distinct* In still air and over a stationary 
background, the magnitude of the translational groundspeed, Vpp, necessary 
to produce the preferred translational angular velocity, df a 

mosquito flying at any altitude may be calculated from the expression: 

Vpr = P7-where Rpj. is the preferred height of flight (Fig. 2)* 

Kennedy performed another experiment* This worker found that Aedes 
aegypti females at 10 cm* altitude and in still air over a stationary 
background flevr with a groundspeed of 1? cra./sec* If the striped background 
were then moved in a direction opposite ;to the mosquitoes* direction of 
flight, all mosquitoes would turn around and fly with the stripes before the 
stripe speed reached 13 cm*/sec* to 17 cra*/sec* In other words Aedes aeg;^^ti 


10 cm* above a background will not tolerate a translational velocity

p 7-5 cq. 3 radians/sec. j uJ radians/sec. I am assuming that 

is the same as for Aedes aeg^^^pti . 

Figures 2 and 3 show graphically the relationship between ground 
velocities and altitudes. Altitude of flight is plotted on the ordinate. 

On the abcissa windspeed and groundspeed are plotted. Two assumptions 
have been made; the preferred airspeed of Aedes aegypti is 1? cm./sec., 
and the preferred airspeed of Aedes punctor is 7^ cm./sec. 

To the right of the line MP and below the line KL only downwind flight 
and downwind displacement are possible. Kennedy found that a mosquito 
in forward flight will not allow herself to be carried backwards; since the 
mosquito will respond in such a meumer that the sum of the rotational vectors 
will be zero (strictly, 1 reflex threshhold), only downwind flight is 
possible. For this region, then, the preferred airspeed (cruising speed) 
plus windspeed equal the groundspeed. This value of the groundspeed 
may be used to calculate the

preferred height of flight and the minimum height of flight* In the region 
between the lines KL and lx, and to the left of MP, the mosquito may fly 
upwind. Upwind flight is possible because in this region of the diagram 
the airspeed of the mosquito can exceed the windspeed. Upvd.nd orientation 
would keep the sum of the rotational vectors equal to zero* Clearly the 
groundspeed of the mosquito is under the control of the mosquito* The 
mosquito will regulate her groundspeed so that she flies at her preferred 
retinal velocity* No allowance for vindspeed,therefore, need be made to 
calculate values of Rpj and respectively* 

Contra Kennedy (I 95 I), the maximum compensatory height is the same 
for upwind and downwind flight; because the rotational retinal velocity 
vector is prodijoed entirely by the wind ioe* the movement of a mosquito 
with constant orientation will in no instance contribute to this rotational 
vector* Above the line KL the mosquito, according to Kennedy’s theory, 
will be totally unresponsive to transverse movement and its direction of 
orientation will be randan; the mosquito’s displacement will have a downwind 
component equal in magnitude to the windspeed® 

Stable downwind flight will occur only near the line q’o* Stable upwind 
flight will occur only near the line nq. Just to the left of the line 
MP, the mosquito must fly near her maximum airspeed; and flight will be 
unstable* Below the lines lx and x’y only exceedingly unstable flight 
can occur, i*e* either climbing or settling* In summary a mosquito can 
have stable fli^t only in the region above KL or along the lines nq and q’o* 
Mosquitoes in any other region of the behavior diagram will either climb 
above KL, or fly to nq and q’o or they will settle*

Some parenthetic remarks regarding these behavior dia^^rams are in 

order. The values of CO r anddd/wi are maximum observed values. The 

corresponding altitudes are therefore minimum altitudes; and the 

corresponding retinal velocities are maximum retinal velocities. Hassenstein 

(l958b) studied the optokinetic reactions of the weevil Chlorophanus viridis . 

He found that when every other ommatidium was s-cimuiated the "strength” ol* 

the optokinetic response increased with the logarithm of the angular 

velocity from 2°/sec. to 40°/sec., reached a maximum at bU°/sec., and 

declined with the logarithm of angular velocity between luO^/sec. and 

20U0‘^/sec. However if all ommatidia were stimulated, the "strength” of 

the optokinetic reaction increased with the logarithm of the angular 

velocity from O.U4°/sec. and reached a maximum at lOO^/sec. The "strength" 

of the optokinetic reaction can be calculated from Reichardt's formula 

A'\ (Hassenstein, iy5^b) where <IP is the 
R re ^ CJni:o / 

angle between successive stimuli, is the angular velocity, andTi» 

are time constants. The constant k is calculated from the expression 

k - ki ^ where is a constant related to the distribution of 

TV Te To 

strengths of successive stimuli, and k^ is the ratio . 

The "strength" of the optokinetic response is dependent on the 

ommatidial angle A <p . The ommatidial angle of Chlorophanus weevils is 

6.8°. Judging from Sato’s diagrams (Sato, 19b0) the compoimd eyes of a 

female Gulex pipiens var. pallens occupy about one fourth of the surface area 

of a sphere. Since there are about five hundred facets per eye, 400U facets 

would constitute a sphere. Hence each ommatidium occupies about = 

4U00 

0.00314 steradians. Hence 6? = ca,^ 0.00314 radians = ca. 0.0^6 radians 
ca. 3«2 degrees. A rough estimate of angular velocities

required to produce optokinetic responses of equivalent "strengths” in 
Chlorophanus and mosquitoes can be made if we assume that the value of 
is the same for both. 

Values ofu?R for Chlorophanus below the value of about 40^ may be 
substituted into the equation 

where Is the ommatidial angle of Chlorophanus ^ is the 

ommatidial angle of the mosquito, and and are the corresponding 

angular velocities. It follows that for an optokinetic reaction of given 
"strength" at a given angular velocity in Chlorophanus , a reaction of 
equal strength would be evoked in the mosquito by an angular velocity 3#2 


times as great as that to vhich Chlorophanus responded. For example, 

an angular velocity of IQo/sec. perceived by Chlorophanus would produce an 

optokinetic reaction in Chlorophanus equal in strength to that produced in 

the mosquito by an angular velocity of 4t7^/3eo» The value of 

1 radian per second (57«3°/sec.) for Aedes aegypti seems therefore to 

ccrrespond to the angular velocity necessary to produce a maximum 

optokinetic response. If a behavior diagram for Chlo rophanus were made, 

the maximum stimulatory height migjht be calculated using CJr =2 ^ 

57.3 

Hence if the rotational vector had a magnitude of 100 cm./sec,, 
upwind orientation should be possible up to a height of 2870 cm.; the 
tendency-to orient upwind would be greatest a t a height of 115 cni. 

( ). To be explicit we might expect some individuals 

of a population of Chlorophanus to orient up to a height of 2870 cm,; 
greater deviations from the wind direction would occur with height. 
Doubtless a population of Aedes aegypti would behave in a similar mannsr.

The maximum stimulatory height is therefore an unfortunate designation of 
a statistical concept* i.e. the probability that an insect flying at this 
height will orient is 1; the probability that an insect flying at any other 
height will orient is less than 1. Similar modifications should doubtless 
be made in the concept of the minimum height of fli^t* 

Windspeed increases rapidly with height as Fig* 6 clearly shows, botli 
upwind and downwind flight should be possible at any given morrent* On the 
basis of optomotor theory one might predict both upwind and downwind 
flight to the left of the line MP in Fig*2 and Fig*3 even if windspeed did 
not vary with height* In order for an insect to ’’tell" if it is flying 
either upwind or downwind, the insect must not only obtain information 
about its airspeed and translational angular velocity, but also of its 
height above the background* Hocking (personal communication, unpublished) 
suggested that an insect may be able to "tell” its height above the background 
by resolving images of objects of "known” size in its environment. 

Hocking believes that his suggestion is substantiated by the ability of 
an insect to land successfully* However, an insect might be able to 
obtain the necessary information about its altitude to land successfully 
by virtue of the fact that the translational angula.r velocity becomes very 
large as the insect nears the ground, Hassenstein (195^) (if* i understand 
him correctly) has shown that an insect does not resolve images in the 
mani^r that the human eye does i*e* perceive a pattern* Apparently an 
insect derives all information about an object from flicker. Another 
possible way by i/diich an insect mi^t gain information about its height is 
by noting changes in angular movoment -vhen the insect "pitches” or "rolls," 
Wigglesworth (1939, p, 124) stated: "The simultaneous and equal illumination 
of corresponding points of the retina is probably the chief factor in the 
perception of distance,"

Cisciriy, Douh upwiiicl. cuid downwind I'light would, not occur Vi/i'tniii uny 
region of the diagram providing that an insect prefers upwind to downwind 
flight, and providing that the insect can estimate its height. And the 
field observations of Kennedy (l95l) on locusts and those of Steiner (lyt3) 
on the beetle Geotrupes stercorarius L., seem to indicate that an insect 
can ’*teli” whether it is flying upwind or downwind. 

It is interesting to note from Fig. 3 that dovrnwind movement of northern 
Aedes mosquitoes such as Aedes punctor flying higher than about cm. (ca, b ft.) 
and in winds greater than about 233 cm./sec. (ca. 3 m.p.h.) will occur. 

For windspeeds lower than about 233 cm./sec. some of the mosquitoes flying 
below 233 cm. will show steady upwind flight. The predicted behavior 
will be realized only if the baclcgroimd can be resolved. Doubtless the 
resultant displacement of a population of mosquitoes flying near the ground 
during total darkness would be more downwind than if the background were visible. 

The situation is difficult to analyse during twilight hours because 
of the decreasing intensity of light. Orientation to cloud patterns or 
even to polarized light is possible. It is interesting to note that the 
polarization of sJiylight reaches a maximum about half an hour after sundown. 

It would be of interest to know whether mosquitoes can detect their 
motion relative to the ground during hours of darkness. The only relevant 
field observations are those made with regard uo sv/arming. 

That the cessation of swarming is light-dependent has been suggested by 
several workers. Nielsen and Greve (1930) found that swarming of Aedes 
cantans Mg. ceased at 7 Inx. Belkin et aJ (i93i) observed swarming of 
Anopheles franciscans McCracken at light intensities of < 0.2 Weston 
units (ca. 2 lux). 











19o 


More recently Provost (1958) found that males of Psorophora confinls ceased 
swarming at 0.02 lux, Moreover Provost found that on a moonlit night the 
illumination from the zenith never dropped below O .025 lux; and swarming 
was prolonged an hour longer than on nights vyhen the moon did not rise 
soon after sunset. 

Since mosquitoes can perceive swarm markers on moonlit nigjits, one 
might expect that on such nights mosquitoes can also perceive their 
motion relative to the ground. One cannot draw any conclusions from 
observations on swarming about the ability of mosquitoes to navigate on 
dark nights since swarming presumably d oes not necessarily stop because 
the marker is no longer visible. The studies of Sato £t 1957b) on 
structural changes in the mosquito’s compound eye during the process of 
dark adaptation may help to clarify this issue. 

The structure of the mosquito eye has been studied by Sato (1950, 

1953 > 1957 a, I957h) in Anopheles hyroanus sinensis Wiedemann, 

Culex pipien s var. pallen s Coquillett and Aedes ( Finlaya ) japonicus Theobald. 
Sato and his coworkers found the respective facet numbers {35% reliability) 
for females of these species to be; 606-637, 503 - 56 O, 504 - 527 . 

The eye was classified as the acone "type and it forms only apposition 
images. Neither tracheal tapetum, tracheal sacs nor reflecting pignents 
ivere found in the eye. The internal arrangement of the ommatidium was 
found to vary with li^t intensity. In the dark ad^ted eye, the lens 
thickened proximally and the rhabdom migrated upward to touch the lens. 
Further the pupil of the ommatidium enlarged markedly because the iris 
pigment cells contracted and moved aside distally. Obviously in the 
dark adapted eye light from an unusually large solid angle can fall upon tdie 
rhabdom; if the insect is moving, light from a stationary point will fall

on the rhabdom for a longer period of time. Since intensity times duration 
is a constant (Dethier in Roeder, 1953) both luminosity discrimination and 
flicker perception will be enhanced in the dark adapted eye. At the same 
time visual acuity will decrease since the effective onmatidial angle is 
larger. 

It seems reasonable to suppose that at the li^t intensity below which 
visual acuity is asymptotic to the logarithm of light intensity, 
flicker perception is impossible. According to Dethier (in Roeder, 1953# 

P* 508), however, the sigmoid curve relating visual acuity and log light 
intensity for the bee has a heel where log millilamberts equals -0.5# 

Below a light intensity of 0.7 millilamberts (ca. 7 lux), then, the visual 
acuity of the bee is effectively nil. Wigglesworth (1939) has reproduced a 
graph relating flicker perception to the logarithm of light intensity for 
the honey bee. However in idiis instance the heel of the curve is formed at 
log millilamberts equals -1.5* Hence flicker perception (or detection of 
movement) is negligible below .07 millilambert (ca. 0.7 lux). Flicker is 
perceived hy the honey bee TNhen the visual acuity is effectively nill 

If the perception of flicker is possible in light intensity below 
that required for effective resolution, than an insect although it could 
not hover above an object because of too low ligjbt intensities could still 
obtain information about its displacement relative to the ground. Sato 
et al (1957h) found that in Culex pipiens var. paliens Coquillett dark 
adaptation of the eye is about complete when the ligjit intensii:y falls below 
0.02 lux. One might e3q)ect, then, that the mosquito can perceive motion at 
even lower light intensities.

Apparently the orientation of mosquitoes to wind during hours of 
darkness has not been studied* However Larsen (1949) studied tte migration 
of the nootuid Plusia gamma L,, and found that at nis^t the moths displacement 
was consistently with the wind* 

Rees ( 1945 ) believed that moonlight exerts a profound influence on 

the movements of mosquitoes* According to Horsfall (1955)» other workers 

also believe that the moon influences mosquito activity* Mosquitoes flying 

near the earth would certainly orient to wind during moonlight. The work 

of El-Ziady is doubtless relevant to Rees* hypothesis* El-Ziady (195?) studied 

the effect of moonlight on the vertical distribution of Diptera. From an 

analysis of traps catches taken at 5 ft* and 30 ft. levels above the ground 

she concluded that "there is a positive correlation between activity of 

(30 ft.^yif.K.) 

insects and the moon. Insect population at this level*increases at F* M* 

W.K. W.K. 

(full moon) and decreases at N* M. (new moon), the reverse of -what occurred 

A A 

at ground level****’ 

*The significance of these findings can be realized when considered 
in terms of problems of dispersal of insect pests if attracted to the 
moon. These fly to hi^ levels cf the a-bnosphere and are caight and 
transported by wind from one place to another* This point, however is being 
tested further on totally different climate and insects, to verify the 
validity of this phenomenon***” 

How accurately the nocturnal movements of insects can be predicted from 
optomotor considerations is debatable* Nevertheless it is reasonable to 
expect more wind drift at night than during the day*

1.2.2, The Optoinotor Theory ethd the Vertical’Distribution of Dispersing 
Mosquitoes. 

1.2.2,1. Implications on dispersion. 

Numerous studies have been made on the distribution of insects in the 
atmosphere. Recently Johnson (1957) and Taylor (1958) found that the 
decrease with altitude of the number of insects per unit volume of air 
could be described by a mathematical relationship. These workers regard 
the aerial fauna as forming a continuous diffusion system, 

A discussion of the vertical distribution of biting mosquitoes in 
forests can be found in Bates (1949)* Snow and Pickard (1957) showed 
that the upward movement of mosquitoes was dependent on light intensity. 

This worker found that the mosquitoes ronained high in the trees during 
the night and that the descent was initiated by the same light intensity 
(1 ft.-candle) as the ascent. More recently Lcve and Smith (1958) studied 
the vertical distribution of mosquitoes using mechanical sweeping devices 
at 8-, I5-, 25-, 40- and 50- foot levels. These workers found that: 

’*The maximum numbers of Anopheles end Uranotaenia were collected at 6 feet, 

51 percent of maximiun at 3 feet, with a marked decrease at I5 feet continuing 
through higjher elevations. The maximum numbers of Aedes and Psorophora 
were collected at 40 feet, with near maximum collections also taken at 25 
feet and 3 feet. Fewer but still appreciable numbers were collected at 
6 feet, 15 feet, and at the high 50”foot level. The greatest number of 
Culex was collected at 3 feet, the numbers decreasing at higher elevations, 
except for a secondary peak at 3 feet, with collections at other elevations 
varying only from 64 to 73 percent of this maximum.”

■Whether these observations can be extrapolated to a plain is highly 
questionable and for that reason the bearing of these observations on 
dispersion is also debatable* 

The vertical distribution of mosquitoes over grassland was studied by 
de Zulueta (1950)* His data indicate that the ratio of females caught in 
nets attached to a moving vehicle at 4*5 1.5 uti* "was ca. 1:6 for 

Culiciue mosquitoes and ca. 1:10 for Anopheline mosquitoes. Horsfall 
(1955# P« 398) noted that three times as many female Psorophora discolor 
were collected in a whirling net trap at 1.2 m. as at 2.4 m. MacCreary (1941) 
operated two sets of two light traps at different locations. At each site 
one trap was about one hundred feet above the one near the ground. The 
percentages of total mosquitoes caught at the upper elevation were 
3.3^ and 8.8^. Burgess (in litt. 1958, 1959) trapped Aedes mosquitoes 
above pasture land at 5“> 25 -, and 50“ foot levels. He found that the 
density diminishes rapidly with height. Moreover his curves relating 
density with hei^t are similar to those described by Johnson (1957)* 

An approximate estimate based on these curves indicates that the ratio of 
the numbers present above the 10-foot level to those below 10 feet is 8:7 

. for his 1955 data, and 5^4 Por his 1958 data. If the integral given by 

■par ol/I m^e-c.t.5 

Johnson (1957) for Freeman’s data/yis evaluated between the limits of 0 ft.-10 ft. 
and 10 ft .-277 ft. it is seen that only of the airborne insect population 
is below 10 feet. 

It was pointed out that mosquitoes such as Aedes punctor above about 
235 cm. will either exhibit random orientation and their track will have a 
do^vnwind component, or they will fly downwind.

According to the data obtained by Burgess, 'chen, over hail of the 
mosquito population will be wind-borne. Moreover Burgess found thav the 
density profile may be established or destroyed rather quickly certainly 
within one hour. It is of great importance to know the raue of vertical 
exchange between insects near the earth’s surface and those higher up. 
Atmospheric turbulence would affect the rate of turnover, however during 
the hours when mosquitoes are active, atmospheric turbulence is usually 
reduced by isothermal or inversion temperature lapse rate. The only 
physical factors which might cause an insect to cease flying are low 
temperature and the lack of energy. Hocking (l953) found that for mosquitoes: 
“Intermittent flight was obtained ax temperatures down to 36°F.” This worker 
found the flight endurance of Aedes punctor to be 12 hours. Further Hocxing 
(l^^bd) concluded:“For all species the dominant stimulus for flight was lack 
of tarsal contact. In mosquitoes air movement was next in importance....” 
Bassler (1^37) has shown that the antennae bear sensory organs (Raumlag- 
sinnesorgan) which would enable the mosquito to maintain its normal flight 
altitude even in total darkness. If the mosquito were carried to high 
altitudes it would be excited to greater activity by the decrease in 
atmospheric pressure (Haufe, 1954). Since mosquitoes are rarely trapped at 
heights greater than a few hundred feet above the earth, the pressure changes 
experienced by mosquitoes may be much less than the pressure changes to 
v/hich Haufe subjected mosquitoes. 

The conclusion can be dravm from optomotor considerations and evidence 
from vertical distribution 'studies that mosquitoes can be carried by the 
wind. Those mosquitoes flying into the wind certainly will not travel as 
far as those flying with the wind. 

Although the preferred airspeeds of mosquitoes are not well established 
the maximum airspeeds are known. According xo the work of Hocxing (l953) 
Aedes punctor- a fairly strong flier-could not make headway against a wind

greater than 235 cm./sec. This speed is no doubt much higher than that 
•vdiich a mosquito -would fly against for a long period of time. The cruising 
speed of an insect mil depend on its height above the background, 

Kennedy (1939) found this speed to be I 7 cm,/sec, for Aedes aegypti for a 
height less "than 10 cm. Hocking (1953) found the cruising speed of 
Aedes punctor, 25 cm, above the background, was 78 om,/sec. Very low 
windspeeds, say below I 50 cm,/sec,, -were rarely observed in Edmonton during 
the time when this study iwas carried out. Nevertheless one cannot simply 
conclude that against-vand displacement of mosquitoes is negligible, 
because -windspeed decreases very steeply as the earth's surface is approached 
(Fig#6). Hence by flying close to the earth a mosquito could make headway 
against the wind. Such headway would be very slov/ and doubtless changes 
in direction would occur because the -wind is variable. The net displacement 
would then be small compared to the flight range as measured by Hocking (1953.) 

From theoretical considerations, then, the displacement of active 
mosquitoes must show a very strong downwind component, 

1,2,2,2, Factors influencing vertical distribution of mosquitoes, 

(a) Environmental, 

According to Glick (1957) the relative nimber of insects caught at 100 
ft, at daybreak: declines from 40 to I 5 at sunrise. One reason for the 
increase in -the population of the 100-foot level may be that insects lose 
visual contact with the ground during hours of darkness and fly hi^er 
above the earth, El-Ziady (1957) has suggested that the moon may attract 
insects to higher altitudes. 

Freeman (1945) found that the number of insects in the air increases 
from 6-12 m,p,h, Glick (1957) reported the maximum niimber of insects in 
winds of 5”8 m,p,h.

According to Andrewartha and Birch (1954)# Pittendrigh (1950) showed 
that the vertical distribution of mosquitoes in a forest is dependent on 
the relative humidity profile. When temperature inversions occur, the 
marked decrease of absolute humidity with height vanishes. 'i/Vhen the 
atmosphere is dry, the humidity profile may effectively confine moisture 
sensitive insects to the earth's surface or perhaps to a certain height 
above the ground. However at night this barrier often vanishes, and 
insects can gain altitude. 

According to Freeman (1945) an increase in temperature results in an 
increase in the air borne insect population until an optimum temperature 
is reached. 

Nielsen and Nielsen (1958) found that Aedes caspius Pallas was 
confined to 100 cm. of the ground when the teii 5 )erature was lO^C.; 
however Nielsen and Nielsen believe some other factor may also have been 
operative in this reduction of flight activity. Wellington (1944) 
observed that when temperature inversions exist male Culicine mosquitoes 
tend to rise above the layer of inversion. Burgess (in litt., 1958) 
found no similar influence of the temperature gradient in his data. 

The influence of other environmental variables such as barometric pressure 
has not been demonstrated. 

(b) Behavioral. 

Clarke (1943) wrote with regard to Aedes vexans ; ’’Observation at 
marshes during the period of emergence reveals that vexans rises from the 
marsh singly and continuously at dusk for a period of approximately one 
hour. They are observed to rise to a height of forty feet and fly with 
the wind.” Nielsen (1958) observed that Aedes taeniorhynchus

takes off with wind during the initiation of its migratory flight* 

De Meillon (1S34> as cited by Horsfall 1955# P* 230), observed that 

Anopheles gambiae M^en released rise to a height of 6 m. and then fly 

with the wind* Horsfall (1955, p. 24) states: "Most accounts have indicated 

that hordes of mosquitoes travelled more than I5 above the ground," 

"ilfhether the optomotor response is weak in all newly emerged mosquitoes 

as it may be in Aedes taeniorhynchus (Nielsen, 1958) is not known* 

1*3. OTHniR PECULIAR RESPONSES AFFECTING DISPERSION* 

A form of behavior that would not only influence the vertical 

distribution of mosquitoes but also dispersion is the movement of mosquitoes 

along lines cr borders (Jenkins and Hasset, 1951; Snow and Pickard, I95I,) 

Horsfall (1955# P* 525) reported that amass flight of Aedes vexans Meigen 

took place toward "the glowing skyline caused by suburban lights*" 

the 

Horsfall does not statey^speed and direction of wind* Lindroth (1948) 
showed that some ground beetles Codes gracilis Villa, Acupalpus consputus Dft. 
and A* dorsalis Fbr, fly to the west between 17 h and I9 h* 

Horsfall (1955# P« 525) also reported that movements of mosquitoes 
may be restricted to the undergrowth: "Females were moving eastward in 
the undergrowth of a forest area during a sultry afternoon when no wind 
was blowing* The females flitted from one low plant to another,but always 
in the same general easterly direction* Such "creeping migration" seems 
to occur in Utah also (Rees, 1943)* He, too, noted that females followed 
paths of low canopy vegetation* Within 2-5 days a fligjit had moved 8 km* 
in this case*" 

Were the movements of the mosquitoes confined to the undergrowth 
because of adverse temperature, humidity or light conditions, or is such

behavior the expression of an innate preference to movement within 
vegetation? 

Hearle (1926) reported the movement of mosquitoes up the sides of 

mountains* Is this behavior skototaxis, or the attraction to prominent 

sections in the landscape, hypsotaxis? Schneider (1952) has shown that 

Chafers Melolontha sp. fly toward hills* Evans (1956) has data indicating 
the 

that^percentage of a population of Chafers, Amphimallon majalis Razoumowsky, 

^ich go to a given object projecting above the horizon varies inversely 

as the square of the distance separating the Chafers and the object* 

Moreover Evans (personal communication, unpublished) believes that 

shape influences "attractancy” of an object* 

MacCreary (1939) operated five ligiht traps in Newark, Delaware. 

MacCreary found some traps collected more mosquitoes than others* He states 

’'***The trap locations were examined with the thougiht of ascertaining 

any environmental differences that mi^t exist. It was certainly not a 

matter of elevation, since the difference between that of the highest 

trap and the lowest was but 43 feet. Other visible conditions sppeared 

(of man, W.K.) 

to be nearly equal. Population density^appears to be the only explanation* 
The traps capturing the largest number of female mosquitoes were located 
in old and established sections of Newark. The other traps, although on 
opposite sides of town, were placed in comparatively new real estate 
developments with a much lower population density* Headlee (1936) has 
indicated that both Aedes vexans (Meig*) and Culex pipiens L* tend to 
migrate in the direction of great populations regardless of wind direction*” 
An alternate explanation for MacCreary* s results is that initially 
the heavily populated part of the human community is not more attractive

than any other part of the coiranunity, however mosquitoes would tend to 
accumulate near this blood source. Unl'ortunately the evaluation of these 
hypotheses is not simple. 

1.4. PASSIVE TRANSPORT. 

Movements of mosquitoes other than those near the surface of the earth 
have also been reported. Smith £t (I956) demonstrated with the use 
of marked mosquitoes that when a cool air mass moved across a semi-tropic 
area in California, vast numbers of mosquitoes were picked up and deposited 
30-60 miles distant from the larval habitat. Smith (in litt., 1959) 
explained this transport as follows: "I do not have any air temperature 
data of the moving air but would assume it would not be much below 10® 
lower than the valley air.* 

*I do not believe this mass could be considered as passing over 
in the nature of a frontal movement. Meteorological information 
indicated that it was a local movement drawn in from the coast over about 
60 miles of low hot hills to fill a local barometric low and dissipated 
once it entered the valley. My belief is that the mosquitoes were not 
carried on this cool air or any local surface movement it set up but were 
stimulated by cool air and carried by thermal currents at higher altitudes...” 

Horsfall (1954) described a mass transport of Aedes vexans in a cold 
front. Perhaps storm cells of the advancing air mass picked up the 
mosquitoes and carried them high into the air as is apparently also the 
case with the spruce bud worm moth Choristoneura fumiferana (Greenbank, 1956; 
Henson, I95I). 

Wellington (1945* 195^) has pointed out that pressure changes 
associated with the passages of cold fronts "excite” some Diptera.

Haufe (1954) has shoAAn that Aedes ae^ypti mosi^uitoes exhibit increased 
activity with pressure ctianges. However the pressure fluctuations 
produced by Haufe were different from those associated with a frontal 
passage or with a thunderstorm. Nevertheless Kennedy (1940) has shown 
that mosquitoes take flight w-hen windspeeds are decreasing. It is therefore 
conceivable that mosquitoes, due partly/- to their own activity, could be 
carried by frontal systems. 

1.5. SUPPRESSION OF SPONTANEOUS ACTIVIIY BY EXTREME EMIRONMSNIAL CONTIITICNS. 

1,5,1*Introduction. 

The dependence of the movement of mosquitoes on wind was pointed out. 
Moreover the conclusion was drawn that the displacement of a mosquito 
will have a strong downwind component. If the student of dispersion has a 
record of the daily march of environmental variables which influence an 
organism’s movement, and further if he understands the exact manner in 
which these environmental variables and changes in them influence the 
displacement of the organism, he can predict the resultant displacement of 
a population, 

I have considered wind to be the most important environmental variable 
which influences mosquito displacement. However the wind data alone will 
not enable one to predict the displacement of an organism because the 
environment often restricts or prevents activity ( . .Larsen, 1943*) 

To predict the displacement of mosquitoes one must therefore consider 
the wind data frcm those hours when the mosquitoes were, or at least 
could have been,active. 

The following environmental conditions are known to reduce the 
activity of mosquitoes; high windspeeds, low temperatures, low humidities, 
high light intensities.

1,5«2. The Influence of Windspeeds. 

Reports in the literature on the influence of windspeed on mosquito 
activity are rather difficult to evaluate because windspeeds are rarely 
measured at the site of mosquito activity. The fact that the speed cf 
wind is greatly influenced by vegetation and other obstructions has 
prevented both the theoretical and experimental physicist from arriving 
at an expression which can adequately describe in all situations the 
variation of windspeed and microstructuro with height above the ground. 

That windspeed increases with height above the ground is a well 
known phenomenon, Sutton (1953) has reviewed this subject. He states: 

"In general terms it is clear that these results express the fact 
that the turbulent transfer of momentum from one level to another is 
either promoted or hindered by the prevailing density gradient. In 
conditions of superadiabatic lapse rate, the turbulence of the wind is 
at its highest level, and there is a free flow of momentum from the 
unretarded stream at the greater heights to replace that used up in 
overcoming the friction of the surface. In such conditions velocity tends 
to become nearly uniform with height, except in the immediate vicinity 
of the surface, "flhen turbulence is being suppressed by an inversion, the 
vertical exchange of momentium is reduced and the velocity near the ground 
sinks to a much lower level, resulting in a more sharply curved velocity 
profile," 

Clearly winds exhibit extremely complicated behavior even at exposed 
locations well away from any obstruction, Heedless to say at any given 
time, there will be a wide variation in wind characteristics in a given 


habitat.

Hocking et al.(1950) suggest an explanation for reduction of activity 
with increasing windspeeds: 

"The influence of windspeed both on flying and biting activity 
appears to be primeirily a mechanical one; because controlled flight in 
the wind is difficult, biting is also difficult. However by increasing 
evaporation, higher windspeeds may also influence mosquitoes in the same 
way as high saturation deficiencies." 

"Mechanical influence" doubtless refers not only to the influence 
of windspeed but also turbulence. It has been pointed out that temperature 
inversions which occur during the hours when mosquitoes are active tend to 
damp out turbulence. However the amount of turbulence is also related 
to the velocity of the wind. Hewson and Gill (1944) found that the 
amount of turbulence defined as the average amptitude of gusts varied 
almost linearly with windspeed. However the ratio of mean turbulence to 
velocity is not a constant; "It can be seen that the ratio increases with 
velocity up to about 5 m.p.h. After that the increase is more gradual, 
until at velocities above 12 m.p.h. the ratio is practically constant. " 

Judging from the study made by Hocking (1953) no mosquito could govern 
its track in a windspeed as high as 12 m.p.h. (ca. 550 cm./sec.) Insects 
flying near the earth surface could control their track since the windspeed 
WD'old be much lower there. However if the wind is sufficiently gusty the 
eddies will extend to the surface of the earth. Under these conditions a 
mosquito cannot control its track. Wilson (personal communication) has 
assured the writer that 12 m.p.h. (ca. 55O cm./sec.) is a critical windspeed 
from a meteorological standpoint. At this windspeed the eddies penetrate 
to the surface as is evidenced by drifting of snow and soil.

Shemanchuk (1958) states that mosquito activity is reduced in windspeeds 
above 10 m.p.h. (ca* 470 cm./sec.) In this study the anemometer was at 
the site of the trap but considerably higher. Airflow around cylindrical 
traps is conplicated and variable. Moreover in this study high winds 
were accompanied by adverse temperatures and humidity conditions. 

In the studies made by Hocking ©t ^ (1950) and Curtis (1953), biting 
and landing rates were criteria of activity. Is it valid to extrapolate 
these data to predict spontaneous activity under identical meteorological 
conditions? Female mosquitoes are often observed to approach an observer 
during fairly hi^ winds. In such instances the females fly Just several 
inches above the ground. These mosquitoes may be stimulated by the 
observer and hence are not spontaneously active. From the graph published 
by E.B. Larsen (1948) one sees very little activity in winds greater than 
3 Beaufort units (ca. 365“*oa. 550 cm./sec.) Her criterion of activity 
was the number of mosquitoes feeding on the crowns of Tanacetum . 

Again feeding activity and flight activity are entirely different; however 
the fact that mosquitoes do not even feed when the turbulence extends 
into the vegetation suggests a dependence of activity on windspeed. 

Horsfall (1955.,?* 104) states that a number of workers found that in 
gentle winds Anopheles maculipennis exhibits ’’erratic” flight, however in 
strong wind, this species is grounded. Rudolfs (1923) observed little 
mosquito activity in winds over 6 m.p.h. (ca. 270 cm./sec.) Uvarov ( 1931 ) 
as cited by Wellington ( ) stated that mosquitoes are not active in 

wind over 8 m.p.h. (ca. 365 cm./sec.) Gordon and Page (1943) found that 
in winds over 12 m.p.h. (ca. 55 O cm./sec.) mosquitoes were not taken in 
light traps. Afridi and Majid (1938) found that Culex fatigans would not 


take flight in wind above 10 m.p.h. (ca. 455 cm./sec.)

It is well known that aphids actively launch themselves into the air 
during winds of much larger speeds than ein aphid’s maximum airspeed. 

Whsther mosquitoes would exhibit such behavior is open to question. 

Perhaps such "migratory" species as Aedes taeniorhynchus and Aedes sollicitans 
exhibit this type of behavior. Nielsen (1958) has observed Aedes 
taeniorhynchus taking off with the wind, Pearce (in litt., 1959) found 
that during low winds salt-marsh mosquitoes "move in hops of 50“500 yards." 
However d'uring high windspeeds mosquitoes "tend to stay in flight and 
thus avoid our strip of insecticide." 

Obviously the question of inhibition of activity by wind could be 
more satisfactorily discussed if more were known of the variation of 
"locomotory drive" with age. Even a knowledge of the sequence of various 
kinds of behavior would be helpful. 

For the purpose of this study, the assumption was made tb^it little 
spontaneous activity occurs in winds over 550 cm./sec. (ca. 12 m.p.h.) 

1.5*3» The Influence of Ten^erature on Mosquito Fli^t Activity. 

Mosquitoes do not exhibit spontaneous activity until the air 
temperature is much higher than that at Tidiich flight is possible. 

Hocking (1953) observed that mosquitoes on his f ligjit mill exhibited 
flight activity at temperatures down to 36°F, Rudolfs (1923) found that 
the activity of Aedes sollicitans and Aedes cantator decreased below 60°F, 
and ceased almost entirely below 50°F. Mellanby (1940) concluded that the 
flight threshold of Aedes punctor is 10®C. (50°F,) in Lapland. Hocking 
et ^ ( 1950 ) reccrded high biting rates at temperatures below 7°C. (45°F.) 
and also state: "Between teDsperatures of 50°F, and 80°F, there is no regular 
variation in attack; data beyond these limits are too meager for definite

conclusions but suggest that the intensity of attack falls off rapidly at 
both higjier and lower temperatures,” Curtis (1953) made a study similar 
to that of Hocking et al (I 95 O). He states that ’’Activity ceased entirely 
at 36 °F, and was negligible below 40 *^," 

The criterion of activity in the studies of Hocking et al and Curtis 
were rates of landing and biting. Of course one cannot assess the 
proportion of observed activity induced by the presence of the observer, 
and the proportion that was spontaneous, Shemanchuk (1950) has a relevant 
observation:” Female mosquitoes v/ould land and bite in small numbers 
(1 to 1 , 6 /min,) only immediately after the observer entered the sampling 
site. If the observer remained still for approximately 3*5 minutes, no 
bites would be recorded.” 

Nielsen and Greve (1950) in their study of swarming found a linear 
correlation between the time of evening a scent and temperature. According 
to their graph, the evening ascent would be at 1600 hr, with a tenperature 
of ca, 70°F, and at 2100 hr, with a tenperature of ca, 4l°F, The 
temperatures in this instance were measured in the heather, and were as 
much as 9°C, (16,4°F,) lower than those recorded in the Stevenson screen. 
These workers also state that the duration of swarming is dependent on 
tauperature: "It appears evident that swarming continues for a shorter time 
when it is cold and a longer time vhen it is warm. If the tenperature is 
below 10°C, ( 50 ^,) there will be no swarming at all," Moreover -these 
authors state; ” A few labora-bory observations have been made on the 
tempera-ture relationships of Culicids but all that appears to have been 
established is that -they tend to avoid tanperatures above 24^0, (75,2°F,) 
or below about 4-6°C, (39*2-42,8°F,) at which temperature they are to some 
extent immobilised,” Wellington (1945) states that the minimum temperatures

at which male and female Culex mosquitoes cease to fly are 8*9°C. (480F*) 
and 6*1°C, (43°I'^*) respectively, hielsen and Nielsen (1958) however 
observed the topswarms of Culex at 8.6°C,-o^ Y°C. (47.5°F.-49»4^*) 

Lewis ( 1933 ) made observations on Aedes aegypti ,a species that does not 
occur in northern latitudes. He found that this species did not fly md 
walked about very slowly at 10°C. 

It seems then that one can safely assume that mosquitoes exhibit 
little spontaneous flight activity below 50 °F. 

1*5«4* The Influence of Humidity on the Spontaneous Flight Activity of 
Mosquitoes. 

The literature on the influence of humidity on activity is rather 
confusing, because some obervers express the amount of moisture in the 
air in terms of relative humidity and others as saturation deficit. 
Andrewartha and Birch (1954) state well the assuii^)tions underlying both 
modes of e^^ression, however their statements do not clarify the question 
insofar as mosquitoes are concerned. Cl cuds ley-Thompson (1956) states: 

”In insects which have a discrete epicuticular layer of wax and do not lose 
much water by evaporation except at temperatures above the critical 
transitional temperature of this wax layer, it is believed that the 
humidity receptors function hygroscopically rather than as evaporimeters..." 

Since mosquitoes may have a discrete wax layer, relative humidity may 
be the mode of e^qpression. However the manner in which humidity receptors 
work is probably not resolved so siii 5 )ly as Cloudsley-Thompson suggests. 

Platt £t aJ. ( 1957 ) have produced arguments supported by experimental 
data to the effect "that Anopheles quadrimaculatus Say responds to changes in 
relative humidity and not to changes in saturation deficiency. 















37 


Platt et al. (1958)froin a field study concluded that the spatial distribution 
of Aedes vexans is governed by relative humidity, 

Larsen (1S48) observed very little feeding activity ^Nhen the relative 
humidity was below eOfi, She expressed the opinion that activity follows 
the relative humidity curve. Hocking e^_^. (1950) found a marked reduction 
in biting activity at saturation deficiencies of 12 mm, Hg or more, 

Curtis (1953) did not find a consistent variation of biting activity with 
saturation deficiency, Shemanchuk (1958) foimd that the size of trap 
catches kept pace with the relative humidity. High humidities apparently 
never suppress activity, although Thompson (1938) found that Culex fatigans 
avoids high humidities, Rudolfs (19^3) also believed that extremely hi^ 
relative humidities are detrimental to mosquito activity. However Nielsen 
and Greve (1950) and Bertram and McGregor (195^) found that mosquitoes 
remain active during rain. However Roberts and O'Sullivan (1948) found 
that during heavy rain, activity ceased, Platt et al,(1951« 1958) 
maintain that Anopheles quadrimaculatus Say and Aedes vexans prefer a 
relative humidity between ’JOfo and 80^, This range is in close agreement 
to that given by Rudolfs (1923). 

For purposes of this study it is assumed that spontaneous activity is 
very light for relative humidities below 30^* 

1*5*5* THe Influence of Li^t Intensity on Mosquito Activity, 

A positive correlation between cloudiness and mosquito attack was 
reported by Hunter (1910.) Hocking ft (1950) report a well marked 
positive correlation on the tundra but less so in the forest, Curtis (1953) 
stated that; "On several occasions an increase inactivity occurred con¬ 
currently with a reduction in li^t intensity, when all other factors were

relatively stable...However no clear cut example of the converse vrets 
obtained." 

E. B. Larsen (1948) suggested that "activity shows evidence for light 
control, there is a dawn dusk activity peak all seasons." Hielsen and 
Greve (1950) found no correlation between light intensity and the 
beginning of the ascent of swarms; but with regard to swarming: "The 
evening swarms appeared to be formed in response to decreasing light 
intensity and to disperse at a light intensity of 7 lux..." These workers 
also report that "we have on occasions noticed the daytime swarms well 
outside the normal swarming times and apparently resulting from a fall in 
light intensity associated with approaching rain." 

In this analysis the amount of cloudiness is employed to support 
conclusions drawn on the basis of the other environmental variables. 

The amount of cloudiness influences the temperature within the foliage, 
the development of inversions, of valley winds, and the windspeed within 
the river valley. Obviously, then ordinary weather data needs refinement 
when extrapolated to predict readings in a particular habitat.

2. SPECIAL SECTION- THE EDMONTON PROBLEM 
2,1. THh; PROBLEM: HISTORICAL. 

Although no quantitative data were obtained regarding the density 
of adult mosquitoes, the Community Affairs ComiTiittee of the Edmonton 
Chamber of Commerce considered the mosquitoes in the Edmonton area to be 
a great threat to human comfort. This committee addressed itself to the 
problem of mosquito reduction. At a meeting March 2, 1953# 
advice on the efficacy of control measures and on organizational machinery 
necessary for tiiis task, was given by J, H, Brown of the Provincial Dept, 
of Health and by B, Hocking of University of Alberta, The task cf 
mosquito reduction was assigned to the City Parks Dept, then supervised by 
Mr, A, C, Patterson, In 1955 mosquito control was placed under the 
supervision of Mr, J. Wright who later succeeded Mr, A, C, Patterson as 
superintendent of the Parks Dept, 

Collections and determinations cf mosquitoes in the Edmonton area had 
been made by Professor E, H, Strickland and other entomologists who 
followed this pioneer to Edmonton, At the time that the Parks Dept, under¬ 
took mosquito reduction, thsinks to the work of these entomologists, 
about 30 species of mosquitoes were thought to be present in the Ediaonton 
area. Since that time Dr, B, Hocking of the University of Alberta 
extended the knowledge of species present, their teit 5 >oral distribution, and 
their relative abundance, 

Larviciding by aircraft and by crews of men on foot has been the main 
control measure used. This larviciding campaign has been carried out each year 
over an area of radius 8 miles with the corner of 101 St, and Jasper

Avenue as the center. Neighboring municipal districts co-operated in this 
program by distributing "Tossits " in pools. The Towi of Jasper Place and 
the Town of Beverly also supported the control program. 

Adult control measures have been used only to a very limited extent. 
According to the 1953 report on mosquito control by A. C. Patterson, adults 
were controlled on limited areas such as the golf courses, playgrounds, 
Renfrew Park and Clarke Stadium. The surfaces of these areas was sprayed 
with a D D T eind chlordane mixture. According to the report by Patterson 
the results of this measure were not encouraging; ”We get a very 
good kill of mosquitoes..but more mosquitoes move in fairly quickly and 
do not seem to be adversely affected by the spray. Sometimes the control 
does not last any longer tlian about 12 hours.” 

Since the beginning of mosquito control in 1953# most of the pools 
within the City have been drained. Despite this reduction in breeding 
areas and annual application of insecticides to those which remain, 
large populations of mosquitoes appeared within the river valley lAhich 
lies athwart the City. The Parks Department in 1956 decided that the 
origin of these mosquitoes should be investigated. A research grant was 
made available to a University student to study this problem. 

2.2. THE TERRAIN. 

The City of Edmonton lies 2200 feet above sea level on a flat plain 
gently sloping to the northeast. According to Moss (1955) Edmonton 
(530331 lat., II 3 Q 30 * long.) is established on the black soil of the 
Boreal-Parkland Transition zone. 

Edmonton straddles the North Sask. River which meanders across the 
plain from the southwest to the northeast. Several creeks flow into the 
North Saskatchewan River. On the south side of the river. White Mud,

Mil and Fulton Creeks are the most prominent. On the north side of the 
river several very short ravines join the river. The region from the 
northwest to the southwest from the city is covered more or less by swamps 
and lakes. The remainder of the region surrounding the oity is covered 
with much less water. Most of the trees have been cleared frcm the land. 
Wooded areas exist only where the water table is too high to permit 
cultivation. In the immediate vicinity of the city, no large wooded 
areas remain. Howsver large wooded areas still remain several miles west 
and northwest of the city. 

Vfithin the city, the -wooded areas are almost con^letely confined to 
the river valley and adjoining ravines. Generally aspen poplar are the 
dominant trees, however in the deeper ravines and shaded areas of the 
river valley spruce predominate. The undergrowth is typical of poplar 
associations. Willow ( Salix bebbiana ) and dogwood (Cornus stolonifera ) 
constitute a tall substratum. Roses ( Rosa sp.), raspberries (Rubus sp.) 
and honeysuckle (Lonicera sp.)are predominant in the shrub stratum. 

Vicia americana , reed-bent grass ( Calama grotis sp.), Aster sp ., bedstraw 
(Galium sp .), lungwort (Mertensia sp .), willow-herb ( Epilobium sp .) and 
grasses ( Agropyron sp .) are some of the herbs found. Along the river 
valley saskatoon and chokecherry abound. On the bogs, peat forming moss 
( Sphagnum sp.) and Labrador tea ( Ledum ) are found. 

2.3. PROCEDURE. 

Since the movements of mosquitoes in an area of about 100 sq. mi. were 
of interest, and since only one person was available for the work, it 
seemed apparent that the best procedure -would consist simply of field 


observation,

An attempt was made to define the areas in which larvae were being 
produced. The area was surveyed from the air and from the ground. Larval 
sanples were drawn both within and outside of the city limits. Screen 
rearing cages of the type described by Twinn (1950) were set up in some 
pools several miles east and west of the city. Samples of adult mosquitoes 
were drawn throughout the summer in as many places as possible. Enquiries 
about biting activities of mosquitoes were also made. Two visual attractant 
mosquito traps were operated, one on the Mayfair Golf Course and one on 
Summit Drive.

2.4. METEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS. 

(a) Description of sites. 

The hygrothermograph on the Mayfair Golf Course was placed to the 
southeast of a small clump of poplars. On a knoll about one hundred 
yards to the east of the hygrothermograph, the anemometer was mounted 
twenty feet above the ground. 

In a small clearing on the floor of MacKinnon Ravine, a hygrothermograph 
was placed. 














43 * 


On the plain Just 50 paces south of MacKinnon Ravine, a third 
hygrograph was located with small trees to the west and large spruce to 
the north. About twenty paces to the south lay the pavement of the street, 
(b) Results, 

The thermohygrograph traces for two weeks have been traced onto a 
single chart. It should be noted that all of the thermohygro graphs were 
run together in the laboratory before being set out# Readings of the 
instruments were checked with a psychrometer throughout the season. 

On clear days the temperature record on the plain above MacKinnon 
Ravine had a hi^er minimum temperature than either recorded on the floor 
of MacKinnon Ravine or on the Mayfair Golf Course# (See PI# XXI; PI, XXII) 
Further the rate of cooling in the late afternoon was much slower than in 
the valley. The MacKinnon Ravine temperature trace shows the hipest 
maximum in the afternoon. On the other hand MacKinnon Ravine remains 
cold for the longer periods each day than the other two sites. 

The curves of relative humidity indicate that the relative humidity of 
MacKinnon Ravine is higher for longer periods of time and less subject to 
fluctuations than either the relative humidity at the Mayfair Golf Course 
or on the plain above MacKinnon Ravine, 

The relative humidity on the Mayfair Golf Course is also generally 
hi^er and less variable than on the plain near MacKinnon Ravine. 

The differences in relative humidity are due not only to differences 
in temperature, but in vapour pressure (PI. IV). On more or less clear days, 
the maximum temperature was recorded in MacKinnon Ravine, In the early 
afternoons, the relative humidities fell to about the same value at all 


sites 








44 


During the day a fairly strong breeze was observed to blow up iJi^acKinnon 
Ravine. Ths maximum ten 5 )erature was observed in the ravine probably 
because the hot air from the stony river margin flowed up the ravine. 

Observations made an hour or two after sunrise indicated that on the 
sides of the river valley exposed to the sun, the air rose vertically. 

I^ov.ever air flowed down tlie shaded sides. It is doubtful however that a 
pattern of circulation is ever completely e stablished in the manner 
depicted in the diagrams of Wagner (1938) or those of Hewson and Gill 
(1944)* This suspected deviation from the classical concept of air 
circulation in valleys is doubtless due to the fact that the over all wind 
breaks through into such a shallow valley. 

No up-valley winds such as those so well described by Defant (1949> 1S51) 
were observed in this valley presumably because of the valley is flat and 
shallcvf. 

Large "drops” of fog were observed to proceed down a number of the 
ravines. On May 22 rain fell around 18:30. At 21:00 MacKinnon Ravine 
was visited and fog was observed to flow down the ravine at an estimated 
speed of about 3 P* h. Using bits of cotton-wool the movement of air 
over the edge and down the sides of the ravine was studied. Observations 
of this nature were made on many calm nights when fog was not formed. 

Drainage of cold air down these ravines was observed to be a constant 
feature during the evenings and nights. 

On July 9, 1958, hail fell and on melting, fog formed near the ground. 
Every depression was filled with fog. Fog drained down every ravine and 
hollow leading to the river valley. The fog also proceeded down the river 
valley. Even though the layer of fog within the river v al ley was rather 
shallow, observations on smoke rising f roan s tacks m thin the valley 
indicated that all of the air up to the rim of the valley was flowing along 
the valley. Smoke rising below the rim of the valley was deflected in the

down valley direction whereas smoke rising above the rim of the valley 
mared northward. At this time, the wind at the airport was south at 
6 m«p .h. 

The fog flowing along the river valley did not everywhere follov; the 
river but cut across the Mayfair Golf Course. Just south of this golf 
course, the fog rose high along the eastern side of the valley. It was 
suspected that air flow from ravines across the valley deflected the main 
stream of air flowing down the valley. However this hypothesis has not 
been evaluated. A down valley wind has been observed on a number of 
occasions -vdien the wind was blowing across the valley. This phenomenon 
is not well borne out by the scatter diagrams of wind in the valley and 
at the airport for a given direction recorded at the airport. 

Originally it was suspected that the valley might exert a steering 
effect on the over all wind* If a marked steering effect existed the winds 
blowing in a direction nearly coinciding with the direction of the valley 
would be expected to show a close one-to-one correlation. To be explicit, 
the windspeed measured at the airport should be very nearly the same as 
that measured in the valley* If the wind direction is across the valley, 
on the other hand, one should expect a lower windspeed in the valley than 
at the airport. It was thought that the ’^steering effect” should be 
especially evident during periods when the valley received no insolation. 
This phenomenon is not well borne out by the scatter diagrams either. 

It can however be seen that during the night (for low windspeeds'as 
measured at the airport) the windspeeds in the valley are generally lower 
than those at the airport. During high windspeeds, the speeds measured at 
both sites approach one another. For windspeeds above 20 m.p.h, the

windspeed measured in the valley is often higher than at the airport, 
presumably due to turbulence created by the valley. 

During daylight hours, the speeds of wind measured at the two sites 
are more nearly the seane. This is doubtless so because the air is more 
buoyant when lapse rates are superadiabatic. During cloudy periods 
however windspeeds in the valley are much lower than on the plain. As is 
the case at night, with hig]b windspeeds these differences vanish. These 
facts are well illustrated in the scatter diagrams (PI. IV to XX), and 
also in the charts showing the march of windspeeds throughout the day 
(PI. I, PI. II, PI. III). 

2.5. THE LARVAL SOimCE REGIONS. 

Most of the pools were to the north, northwest, west and southwest of 
the city. Few pools were found in other regions. Very few pools were 
found within the city. Many shallow pools dried up rapidly because of 
lack of precipitation, high winds and exceptionally low humidities. 

The area in which larvae were killed is shown on the map of larval 
distribution (PI. XXIII). 

All of the species were found together in most of the pools as the 
map of. larval distribution indicates. However Aedes flax-Qscens was found 
in largest numbers in grassy pools. 

Most of the pools were shallow and of a teii 5 )orary nature formed from 
the spring run-off. Since the reflectivity of pools was low, the water 
teii 5 )eratures exhibited a fairly wide daily fluctuation. Unfortunately 
reliable temperature readings were not obtained from the thermograph. 

D\«*ing April ice was often formed on the pools. Although larvae were foxmd 
as early as April 8th very little development occurred before the third 
week in April.

2,6. OBSERVATIONS ON DATES OF ADULT ENiERGENCE. 

In order to get an approximate estimation of the time when adults 
emerged rearing cages of the type described by Twinn (1S50) were set up 
in two pools. One pool, two miles east of the city limits, was overgrown 
by willow and poplar. The other pool was a grassy slough two miles west 
of the city limits. Adults were removed as often as possible. 

It is seen from Table 3 that the peak emergence of Aedes cataphylla 
must have occurred prior to May 19 but not sooner than May 14. Further, 
the peak emergence of Aedes f itchii occurred prior to May 30 but not earlier 
than May 28.( Table 3)* 

2.7. OBSERVATIONS ON ADULTS. 

Observations were made at as many sites as possible within one night. 

The duration of spontaneous activity on any given evening was rather 
brief. On warm calm nights, mosquitoes left their resting places around 
18:30 hrs. The sun set at about 20:30 hrs., and activity usually ceased 
within an hour thereafter. Subjective estimates of the relative densities 
of mosquito populations at two different places and at two different times 
were difficult to make. In order to offset the influence of varying 
amounts of spontaneous activity on these subjective estimates, the vegetation 
was disturbed. By this procedure, a subjective estimate of the density 
of mosquitoes could be made. 

Aedes cataphylla was often observed to swarm over small bushes, 
curbs of sidewalks, fence rails and dark patches of earth. On several 
occasions swarming was observed over mowed grass on the golf courses. 

In these instances, no swarm marker was apparent to the observer other

than perhaps the marks left by the mower. 

Many of the swarms extended from l|- ft, to about 10 ft, above the 
ground. In small clearings, the swarms were observed to be fonned higher 
above the ground than in the open. Mating was often observed in the swarms. 
At 14:30 hrs, on May 18, a very small swarm of Aede s ca taphylla was observed. 
The wind was light, large cumulus clouds obscured the sun, the ten 5 )erature 
was 65 °F, but the relative humidity was only Large swarms of 

Aedes cataphylla were often observed near the visual attractant mosquito 
traps# However the catches at such times were extremely low. 

The first adult mosquito was taken on April 12 by Sheila Stewart, 
a student at the University of Alberta. This was a specimen of 
Anopheles earlei Vargas. The presence of overwintering mosquitoes was 
occasionally observed thereafter# 

A brief summary of observations made until the end of June is 
presented below, El and E5 are visual attractant mosquito traps on the 
Mayfair Golf Course and Summit Drive respectively#

Mosquitoes were present some pluces until the middle of July. Towards 
the end of June and tiiereafter mosquitoes were found in dense vegetation 
near the bottom of ravines. Elsewhere mosquitoes were found only in 
dense vegetation. Very few were caught in the traps after the third week 
in June. 

A number of specimens of Culex restuans Theobald were taken. This 
constitutes a new record for this region. 

2,7,1. Discussion of Observations of Adults with Special Reference to 
the Spatial Distribution of Adults, 

The appearance of adults in the valley was not sudden. On May 17> 1958 
huge swarms of Aedes cataphylla Dyar mosquitoes were observed on the 
Mayfair Golf Course. On every day in the week preceding May I7>e3ccept on 
May 13, adult mosquitoes were either trapped or observed. The full 
significance of these observations cannot be assessed since the manner 
in which the behavior of Aedes cataphylla mosquitoes varies with time is 
not known. The observations made suggest that Aedes cataphylla mosquitoes 
emerge, perhaps rest for a time, actively disperse, and then swarm and 
mats. On May 15 and May 16 biting mosquitoes were observed in moderate 
numbers; but no swarming was observed. After May 17, much swarming 
occurred on favourable evenings. Apparently, then, the mosquitoes 
observed on May 17, 1958 had just passed through the phase of dispersion. 

It follows that the mosquitoes observed were only a few days old. 

It is reasonable to assume that nimiber and size of swarms indicate 
adult density. 

In the week following May 17 very many swarms were observed in the 
section of the river valley west of the University. In the residential

section along MacKinnon Ravine, there was, during this week, a very marked 
reversal in the attitude toward the mosquito trap ifldiich previously was 
thought to "mess up the boulevard." In the eastern part of the river 
valley, great difficulty was experienced in collecting a sample; few and 
only small diffuse swarms were seen. Golfers did not report mosquitoes. 

Very few mosquitoes were seen in any part of the city other than in 
the river valley and adjoining ravines. Away from the valley and ravines 
only one small swarm was seen - and within a mile of the river valley. 

It should be pointed out that observations were not confined to the river 
valley. 

During this week the species present in largest numbers was 
Aedes cataphylla . 

On May 25 , 1958, several specimens of A. fit chi i and A. stimulans 
were taken. In the following two weeks mosquitoes with banded legs were 
taken every day except on May 29 . By June 3$ there was no longer any 
doubt that this complex of species was present in very large numbers. 

More difficulty was encountered in establishing the spatial distribution 
of this group of species than that of Aedes cataphylla because these 
species have different swarming habits. An estimate of the population 
density of A. fitchii was dependent on biting activity. Under unfavourable 
environmental conditions, it was necessary to disturb the mosquitoes 
resting in the vegetation in order to assess their density. In the 
northwest, north and northeast sectors of the study area, only few 
mosquitoes were present. However in the southern half of the city 
mosquitoes were present in all of the ravines and in the river valley. 

In fact the mosquitoes could not be found in sigpiificant numbers in any other

areas than the river valley and the ravines. Con^laints were received 
from residents in the White Mud Creek, MacKinnon Ravine, MacKenzie 
Ravine and Wadhurst Road regions. The City Parks Dept, contemplated an 
adultioide program for these areas. The eastern part of the river 
valley was comparatively free from mosquitoes. Fewer mosquitoes appeared 
to be harboured on the Highlands Golf Course than on any other golf course. 
To be sure there were distinctly more mosqiitoes in the western portion 
of the river valley than in the eastern portion. 

2.7.1.1. The possible influence of surface winds on the dispersion 
pattern. 

The most obvious ways by which mosquitoes could arrive from a source 
region to another region are: 

1) wind directed flight. 

2) passive transport by surface winds. 

3) transport by storm cells. 

By an examination of the wind data it was established that the wind 
directions were exceedingly variable during the periods when mosquitoes 
were apparently infiltrating the control area. To be sure, from the raw 
wind data one could not establish the direction from which the mosquitoes 
had come. However it was known that mosquitoes could not possibly have 
been active during all hours because of limiting environmental conditions. 
The meteorological data was grouped into Table 4 on an hourly basis, and 
estimates of possible activity were made. In order to estimate the activity 
of the mosquitoes, it was assumed that activity would be non-existent 
or light in temperature < 50°F.j R. H. 30 ^; wind > 12 m.p.h. 

In Table 4 opposite 'kctivity”, L means little or no flight, M means

i).. 


u!>'

moderate amount of flight, H means flight activity is high.In Table 4, 

the row designated as "activity" is the activity predicted from a consideration 

of meteorological data. 

The number of hours during Tfldiich the mosquitoes could have been 
active were grouped according to the mean direction of the wind during 
each hour and the corresponding wind mileage was calculated ( Tables 5 and 6 ). 
Each sum is represented by the length of the vector in the vector diagrams. 
(FiS.5) 

In order to determine the possible wind influence, the periods of 
May 10-May 17 in the case of Aedes cataphylla and May 25 -June 3 in the 
case of Aedes fitchii , A. stimulans and A. excrucians were treated in the 
above described manner. 

According to the hourly wind direction records, both refined and 
unrefined, one should have expected to have found the mosquitoes distributed 
all over the city. Moreover since most of the larval habitats were to 
the northwest of the city, one should have at least expected a high 
population in the northwestern part of the city. The wind direction 
records cannot indicate whether the mosquitoes came from a given locality; 
nor do they explain the pattern of distribution observed within the city. 

2, 7 .1.2. Influence of the passage of cold fronts. 

A very active cold front passed over the city at O 4 OO hrs. on May 
12. There was however no obvious increase in the mosquito populations 
accompanying this event. According to the data obtained from the rearing 
cages, very few mosquitoes emerged prior to May 13* In the remaining 
period from May 13 to May I 7 , no cold fronts passed over the region. 

There is no possibility, therefore, that population of Aedes cataphylla

was transported into the city in this instance* Moreover, if such transport 
had occurred, the population should have had a city-vd.de distribution* 

In the period from May 25 to June 3* when Aedes fitchii species 
complex appeared in the city, only one cold front passed over the region* 
This front passed the airport at 0353 hrs* on May 25 , 

The first specimens of this species complex were taken the day that 
the front passed. It is hardly surprising that only a few of these 
mosquitoes were taken since few had oaierged before May 27 . 

There is no doubt that the large numbers of mosquitoes iMiich appeared 
in the river valley appeared independently of the passages of cold fronts* 
2*7*1, 3 , The possible influence of the city»s lights* 

According to Horsfall (1955) city lights may attract mosquitoes* 

One should have expected a city-mde distribution if the glow of the city 
lights were responsible for the presence of mosquitoes in the city. 

2.7*1®4* IHe influence of the moon on dispersion* 

The hours during which the moon was visible and diiring .which mosquitoes 
could have been active are given in Table 7, However there is no way of 
evaluating the importance of the moon in the observed pattern of dispersion 
since no data was obtained that would allow a comparison of activity on 
dark and moonlit nights*

3. CONCLUSIONS 

3.1. THE ORIGIN OF MOSQUITOES IN THE RIVER VALLEY. 

Since meet of the larval habitats were located to the northwest of 

the city, one might postulate that the mosquitoes either flew in or were 

blown in from the northwest. If this were the case, mosquitoes should 

have been found in largest numbers in the northwestern sector of the city. 

However, despite the fact that suitable resting places were available, few 

mosquitoes were to be found in the northwestern part of the city. Moreover, 

if the mosquitoes had blown or flown over from the northwest, the distribution 

of adults in the river valley should have been more or less uniform. 

The same would be true if the mosquitoes had been biown;..in-or^had flown in 

from-any other-direction.r J:.:-■ : 5 

There are reasons to Relieve that the movements of mosquitoes over 

the plain must have been very limited. Long range movements of mosquitoes 

are likely to occur if the mosquito will fly several feet above the ground. 

So long as a mosquito can resolve the background, upwind flight will 

occur providing the mosquito is near the ground and windspeeds are lower 

than the mosquito’s preferred maximum airspeed. Upwind flight will not 

result in a very great displacement. To illustrate, assume a mosquito has 

energy reserves to fly 30 miles. Further assume a uniform headwind of 

3 miles per hour and that the mosquito is flying at 3.5 miles per hour. 

The maximum distance that the insect is able to fly is 0*5 x 30 * 4.3 miles. 

3.5 

Certainly one would expect the actual displacement to be less than 4.3 
miles. Smith (in litt. 1959) has evidence that mosquitoes disperse from 
a pool at a rate of about one mile in twenty-four hours.

To fly against the wind from the edge of the control area to the city 
center, a mosquito would have to ’’refuel.” The flowering plants necessary 
for "refueling" are unlikely to be found in great abundance on the 
intervening cultivated farm land. 

The question may be raised: what will prevent a mosquito from gaining 
altitude and hence from teiking advantage of the wind? Sutton (1S53) 
has summarized information regarding the water-vapour profile. It has 
been found that the water-vapour profile has the same shape as the wind 
profile. Rider (1954) published some very accurate measurements on the 
profiles of wind,temperature and water-vapour and his results are in good 
agreement with Sutton’s concept. During large inversions however the 
relationship between the wind profile and water-vapour profile is destroyed. 
Under conditions of large inversions, the vapour pressure may increase 
with hei^t. As the writer understands, this situation is depicted 
in the results published by Pasquill (as cited by Sutton, 1953* 317*) 

The data summarized 1:^ Geiger (1950) also support this notion. 

It may be readily seen, then, that if the relative humidity is say 
30^ or 40^0 as it was during the month of May, dispersing mosquitoes will 
find the air most favourable near the earth’s surface. That mosquitoes 
are sensitive to vertical humidity gradients has been borne out by the 
work of Pittendrigh already cited* Moreover if mosquitoes find a suitable 
resting place, they caimot be expected to venture forth into far less 
favourable conditions of humidity* 

There is one possible route that mosquitoes m&y have taken into the 
city without exposing themselves to unfavourable environmental conditions*

This route is along the river valley. Meteorological data has already 
been presented which indicated that during hours of darkness and during 
cloudy periods, windspeeds were generally lower within the valley than on 
the plain. Furtlier, the saturation deficiencies were lower in the valley 
than on the plain. It was obviously possible for mosquitoes to be active 
within the valley for many hours when the severity of meteorological 
conditions on the plain ruled out activi-ty. Activities such as swarming 
which are controlled by light intensity can be carried on as late in the 
evening within the valley as on the plain (Nielsen and Nielsen, 1958)» 
Migration along the river valley would result in a more gradual decline in 
numbers with distance from the source than if dispersion from the source 
took place in all directions* Certainly along several miles of the river 
valley southwest of the Mayfair Golf Course, the mosquito population 
density was quite high* 

3*1*1* The Valley as a Rectifier* 

How does the valley "canalize” the movements of mosquitoes? The 
responses of mosquitoes to environmental variables during the period 

•when they disperse have not been studied* Nielsen and Nielsen (1953) 
found that certain "migratory mosquitoes", Aedes taeniorhynchus, 
exhibit a marked tendency to disperse shortly after emergence* After this 
initial tendency to disperse, the whole behavior pattern of these mosquitoes 
changes* 

However, in the case of Northern Aedes we do not know "whether the 
tendency to disperse is confined to a sharply delimited period of the 
adult*s life* In attempting to explain the rectifying action of the river 
valley, then, must "we understand the responses of mosquitoes during a

sharply delimited period or throughout the adult*s entire life span? 

Nothing is known of mosquito behavior in turbulent air; but might 
not eddies formed at a valley's rims constitute a barrier to dispersion? 
Eddy formation is dependent on the prevailing lapse rate, curvature of the 
bank and wind velocity. Morgan (I 93 I) indicated that eddies at the rim 
of a valley are not formed in windspeeds less than 10 m/sec. Since 
winds are very light d^oring twilight hours viien mosquitoes are active, 
eddies cannot be the only rectifiers. Swarms of Aedes cataphylla were 
often observed just above the valley rim. 

Perhaps differences in relative humidity on the plain end in the 

valley might be operative in orthokinetic or klinokinetic behavioral 

mechanisms which could confine mosquitoes to the valley. However, all 

behavior exhibited by mosquitoes cannot be explained simply in terms of 

taxes and kineses. Nielsen and Nielsen (1953) established that males of 

Aedes taeniorhynchus repeatedly swarm at a given site. Since past 

experience can influence mosquito behavior, it seems reasonable to 

would be 

postulate that mosquitoes ^ prone to remain in the valley if the 
environment were less favorable on the plain. 

The high population densities in the ravines are probably related to 
the nocturnal air drainage down the ravines. It is suggested that 
mosquitoes in the valley respond in an anenomo-positive fashion to this air 
drainage which must extend into the valley. Of course, skototaxis may 
also be involved in this process since the mouths of the ravines appear 
as dark areas at ni^t. 

The mechanisms which caused the continued presence of the mosquitoes 
in the ravines are doubtless identical to those which canalized their

flight dcwn the valley* 

3, 2. DISCUSSION. 

In the literature on mosquitoes one frequently finds a statement to 
the effect that topography influences the pattern of dispersion (see Horsfall, 
1955 ). Very little evidence is presented to support this hypothesis. 

De Meillon (1933) as cited by Horsfall (1955) found that dispersion of 
mosquitoes was restricted to wooded river valleys of Transvaal during 
dry seasons. According to the map of adult distribution in the 
work of Stage et al. (193?) Aedes vexans and Aedes aldrichi disperse 
along tributaries. Causey et al. (1948) collected most of the tagged 
mosquitoes along the river valley; however, recoveries were low. 

Shemanchuk ^ (1955) collected those tagged mosquitoes which flew 
furthest from the point of release within the river valley. 

Unfortunately the hypothesis that the topography may exert an influence 
on diversion is not readily evaluated from tagging experiments. Certainly 
part of the topographical influence must be that due to local winds. 

MacLeod and Donnelly (1958) released blow-flies in hilly country. 

These workers concluded that the flight of individual flies is random. 
Moreover they state that ’*Orier[bed reactions, however, or even 
klino-kineses, to microgradients of tenperature pressure air movement 
or reflecteuDce from the ground belovf them, might reasonably have been 
expected to influence the direction of the dispersal paths of the 
individuals of each species, in relation to ground masses and plains, 
or their cover so that they would tend to be shepherded towards the 
arenas favourable for the species. There is no evidence of such 
orientation of f li^t.”

Even if these authors had obtained much higher recoveries of marked 
specimens and if the traps sangled a volume of air of constant dimensions 
one wonders whether tliey had the necessary micrometeorological data 
necessary to draw such conclusions. In hilly country windspeeds and 
directions constitute a very complicated pattern. This pattern,as well as 
the other environmental variables,undergoes very great changes throu^out 
the day. To be sure katabatic winds and the characteristics of air within 
the first few meters of the earth*s surface are very poorly understood. 

That one cannot extrapolate readings from one meteorological station 
over an irregular topographic region is stressed in the writings of 
micrometeorologists. It seems reasonable to expect that if the environment 
were really understood, and if the reactions of the insect to the 
environmental variables were understood, then one should be able to 
predict the displacement of tlie insect. One cannot repeatedly 
demonstrate various responses of an insect under controlled conditions 
and then assume that these responses are not operative in the natural 
environment. 

Kennedy (I 95 I) has reviewed evidence that the movements of the 
migratory locust may be canalized along valleys. This author has suggested 
that such movement is "consistent with the principle of movement in the 
direction of maximum constancy of the visual field." One need not, 
however, expect canalization in all cases. The migratory locust is indeed 
a special case since it has much better control over its track, and 
because of its excessive "locomotory drive." An organism, such as a 
mosquito which flies at a very low speed mil be much more subject 
to localized changes in the wind. Moreover, an insect which is prone to 
exhibit telotactic responses to minor irregularities in its visual field

or respond to non-visual stimuli such as odour, temperature and hiimidity 
gradients may not show "canalized" movements* 

During the course of this investigation. Hocking suggested that 
insects above large bodies of water steadily fly with wind because 
the moving waves prevent the insect from getting the impression that 
it is being displaced. Similarly insects above the river might be 
led into the city by the moving pattern on the water surface* To test this 
suggestion, observations on the evening of May 26 were made from a row-boat* 
A very gentle breeze blew from the east* Moths were seen to fly in all 
directions over the water. Mosquitoes on the other hand were observed 
only following the boat* The water was exceedingly muddy but the reflection 
of the banks could be seen as the dominant pattern upon Tidiioh the wavelets 
were superimposed. Had the waves been large, the visual situation 
might well have been reversed* However, under such conditions, mosquitoes 
would not have any control over their track. 

The source of the mosquitoes has not been established. There are 
two possibilities; either the mosquitoes originated in pools within the 
river valley, or they originated in pools on the plain above the valley* 

The second possibility demands a mechanism whereby the valley 
accumulates mosquitoes* The behavior of wind passing across a small 
valley has not been investigated. However, cross winds have been studied 
in the Columbia River Valley for the period April 11 to August 31* 1939 
(Eewson and Gill, 1944)• Ihe valley is about 16,400 ft, wide by about 
3,300 ft* deep. In the period from 0100 hr. to 0300^Sir* no eddies are 
formed! the wind penetrates to the valley floor but the velocity decreases 
rapidly with increasing depth® At O 5 OO hr. complete air circulation of the 



72 


air in the valley begins near the valley floor. During the forenoon this 
circulation beocmes quite well developed over the vdiole cross-section of 
the valley. By 1300 hr. this circulation has completely disappeared and 
the wind again penetrates to the floor of the valley but with a greater 
force than at 0100 hr. By 2100 hr. the overhead wind has subsided emd a 
circulation begins in the valley. This circulation has completely 
subsided by 0100 hr. and the wind again penetrates to the valley floor. 

An insect carried by the wind in 'the 0100-0300 hr. period would 
rapidly lose altitude as it passed over the rim of the valley. If the 
insect were in an airstream penetrating to the valley f loor,where the 
^vindspeed becomes greatly reduced, the insect aould then govern its own 
track. 

During the O 5 OO hr. till noon period the wind-borne insect might 
readily be deposited in the valley by circulation. This would also be the 
case in the 2100 hr. to midni^t period. 

Diiring the afternoon when the wind penetrates to the valley floor 
with undiminished force, deposition of an insect would depend on the 
insect’s behavior rather than on the wind characteristics. 

Morgans( 1931 ) reviewed the literature on the relation of ground 
contours and the characteristics of wind. According to this review 
unstable eddies may form in the lee of an obstacle in winds less than 
10 m./sec. (ca. 22 m.p.h.) Such an eddy could effectively deposit wind- 
borne insects. 

The displacement of an insect approaching the valley rim from an 
upmnd direction is problematical. Only if the insect were flying so low

that its air speed were greater than the windspeed would entry into the 
valley be easily effected. The entry into the valley of an insect flying 
several meters above the ground would be hindered by the wind because the 
vertical component of the wind increases markedly at the downwind rim of 
the valley. 

Meteorological events in the valley of the North Sask. River have 
been described,and the agreement between these observations and those made 
in the Columbia River valley is encouraging. 

It seems, therefore, that the probability of a wind borne mosquito 
being deposited in the North Sask. River valley is high especially during 
the normal activity period of mosquitoes. 

3.3* RECOMMENDATIONS. 

It is recommended that a "barrier strip" of 3% Lindane be laid down 
across the valley outside of the city limits. Moreover the efficacy 
of this measure should be evaluated. If this measure is highly 
successful, the efficacy of a DDT barrier strip should be 
evaluated in the hope of long term protection. 

3.4. SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH. 

To be able to predict TnSiere an insect or group of insects will be 
found after a given time interval has elapsed since the position of the 
insect or of the group of insects was last established, one must understand 
both insect and environment. 

The laboratory studies on the responses of mosquitoes have proven 
most helpful but are inadequate in that they provide no information (except 
in extreme instances) about what the animal is doing in the field. That 
the behavior of mosquitoes varies with time is vaguely comprehended. 

The only detailed accounts in the literature relating to the changes in

behavior that occur with time are those dealing with Aedes taeniorhynchus ♦ 
To make a practical illustration of our ignorance of mosquito ethology, 
one need only point out that it is not known whether northern Aedes 
mosquitoes disperse only during a well defined period of their adult life. 
However, even if one had a foreknowledge of what kind of activity a 
mosquito would exhibit, one could not in some instances predict the 
displacement of the mosquito under known environmental conditions. This 
is so because a quantitative understanding of sensory physiology - 
especially of the compound eye - is lacking. 

The science of micrometeorology is still in its infancy. The 
meteorology of valleys has been investigated only in a few large valleys. 
T/hat environmental conditions will confront an organism at any point of 
its environment at a given time cannot be predicted in most instances and 
certainly not in hilly country. 

To obtain a deeper understanding of dispersion, then, the behavior of 
the insect and its environment must be quantitatively cheiracterized. 

The investigator in carrying out field studies is confronted with the 
formidable task of drawing san^les representative of the numbers of 
mosquitoes above a given area. Sanpling methods and experimental designs 
must be devised which allow for the fact that what an animal does may 
change with time. The lack of correlation between the numbers of adults 
trapped and the number of larvae from which the adults emerged as observed 
by Shemanchuk (1958), strikingly demonstrates the fact that sanpling 
procedures do not allow for changes in behavior. 

The height-density profile needs further characterization in non- 
wooded regions. The rate of vertical exchange within such a profile must

be determined in order that the efficacy of variously situated barrier 
strips can be evaluated* 

The preferred angular velocity and preferred air speed of various 
species should be measured in the laboratory. Optomotor theory is basic to 
an understanding of dispersion. Such measurements should be made over a 
meaningful range of temperatures, humidities and stabilities of the air. 

The optomotor theory as presented in this thesis requires extension 
and to all dimensions. 

to all heightsyv The number of insects varies with altitude according to 
the relationship f(R) * C (R + Ro)~^ . The proportion of a population of 
insects that ytLII orient to a given angular velocity is given by the 
relationship f(u;^ = k ). Hence at a given hei^it 

R, the actual number of insects T/^ich will orient, is equal to 
C(R + Ro) k ( 0 ~ ~ 0 ) . If wind did not vary with 

height this expression could be used to calculate the total number of 
insects in the atmosphere which would orient, by making use of the 
relationship v =^(?R. However,windspeed increases with height according 

J. 

to the relationship v = aR^ • By making use of the appropriate substitutions 
and integrating the total number of responsive insects ¥/ould be known. 

One further modification is necessary. The integral should be divided 
in two in order to calculate the number of insects flying upwind and the 
number flying downwind. To achieve this last end the integration must be 
done for wind velocities (or the equivalent values of R or ) - ranging 
from to the insect’s maximum air speed. This integral would give the 
number flying upwind. The symbols "X , C,a , Ro are constants. 

Experimental st’udies on dispersion involving the use of marked 
specimens have been of limited value in the past. Much can be learned 
about what a species does simply by observing it in the field and by

studying it in the laboratory. Certainly the release of tagged specimens 
yields little information other than of local value unless, the habitat 
is well understood, i.e. especially the characteristics of the layer of 
air near the ground above the site of the experiment. 

The vertical distribution cf mosquitoes in a vertical humidity g^radient 
should be studied in the laboratory. Moreover the daily march of the 
humidity profile should be determined over surfaces of land with various 
coverings of vegetation, and of various soil types under a range of moisture 
conditions. 

The variation of the locomotory drive with age of mosquitoes should 
be investigated. If the tendency to disperse is restricted to a well 
defined period, observed patterns of dispersion could be better evaluated 
in terms of environmental variables. 

Since significant advances have been made in the theory of diffusion 
of gases within the lovrer layers of the atmosphere, the stimulation 
threshold of human odour in mosquitoes should be determined so that the 
attractiveness of a city due to human odour could be calculated. 

The influence of the city lights on movements of mosquitoes should be 
evaluated. 

Quantitative data regarding the densities of mosquito populations in 
various sections of the river valley should be obtained. 

An aerological investigation should be carried out in the river 
valley. The nocturnal drainage of air down the ravines should also be 
investigated. 

Since the movement of mosquitoes is dependent on a nectar supply, the 
sources of nectar should be established and mapped. Intensive control of
