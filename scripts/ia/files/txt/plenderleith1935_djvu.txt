The accompanying thesis is an introductory study to a 
series of projects in Composition suggested by Dr. H. E. Smith 
of the University of Alberta. 

It is hoped that this study will clear the way for those 
graduate-students who will be working on the later projects of 
the series. 


In the complete series of investigations it was suggested 
that the following studies be conducted; 


Project I. 

An Analysis of Composition Ability into 
Specific Units. 

Project II. 

The Construction of a Diagnostic Test 
to Locate Weaknesses in Composition. 

Project III. 

A Classification of the ^ecific Units 
by Ages. 

Project IV. 

A Classification of the Specific Units 
by Grades, 

Project V. 

The Building of a Scale to Grade 

C ompoaition Ability. 

Project VI. 

The Devising of Remedial Work to Supply 
Each Specific Unit. 


The chief object of the present investigation was to answer 
the following questions connected with Projects I. and II, 

(1) Is it possible to analyze general com¬ 
position ability into specific units? 

( 2 ) If so 5 what specific abilities in 
composition are required by the makers 
of Canadian curricula? 

(3) Is it possible to assemble these specific 
units into such a form that they can be 
used as a diagnostic objective test of 
general composition ability? 

(4) Is the score made on such an objective 
test more reliable than a score obtained 
from the ordinary subjective method of 
grading? 

(5) Is such an objective test easier to administer 
than the usual subjective test?

(a) The Object of the Jtudy* 

Mot many years have asset! since the teacher's unqualified 
estiiiii te of a ; u. il*s proficiency was universally acknowledged 
to be tlie only necessary measure in the progress of any one of 
her charges. The ten who dared to challenge the Justice or 
accuracy of this method then applied to any particular student 
were silenced with the question: “Who can better Judge the 
work of John than his own teacher?” hen persistent, they were 

told that the t acher did not rely cm her own Judgment entirely, 
but also u -cm for;.ul written examinations* Surely the Judgment 
of the teacher plus tiie grades given written examinations scored 
by her would give John a fair and accurate measure of his pro¬ 
ficiency beyond all doubt. But the classic investigation made 
by Jtorch and Elliott ( 1 ) in 1913 revealed the fact that no 
such com -lucent generalization could be made* It was found, in 
fact, that the range of grades assigned one certain paper by 
one hundred and sixteen teachers using the customary scale of 
100 -mints varied from iS to 90 5 forty-seven teachers thought 
the paper worthy of a passing grade, while sixty-nine declared 
it a failure. The evidence presented by this and other studies 
revealed a.- alar-dug lack of uniformity in assigning grades to 
,>u ils for work performed, and has resulted in an earnest attempt 
to secure measuring instruments which are accurate, fair, and 
Just, but at the same time, objective and scientific* The last 
decade has witnessed the appearance of many scores of objective 
tests prepared to aid in the scientific measurement of pupil 
erf or aiice in practically every field of instruction as well 
,5 in general intelligence* The purpose of this study is to 
hypothecate and subsequently Justify an objective scale in the 
specific field of English composition, which shall be a measure 
>f tie student’s quality, accuracy, and maturity in the actual

writing of English theses at the tine the scale is administered. 

(b) The Necessity for the Study. 

There is no department of instruction in the usual cur¬ 
riculum of the public school in which the pupil is more at 
the mercy of the teacher’s judgment than in English composition. 

The difficulty rests in the fact that under the name "English 
composition" is a heterogeneous assemblage of skills, habits, 
judgments, mid attitudes, some of which are very apparent and 
easily regulated, while others are most elusive. In addition 
to the mechanical operations indispensible to theme writing, 
the pupil must exercise a high degree of judgment in the 
selection of words to clothe his thoughts, in the logical order 
of his sentences, and in the coherence of his completed theme, 
moreover, he must display taste and feeling in the recognition 
of euphony and the avoidance of cacophony and still be original 
and fresh in figure end diction. To measure scientifically 
each of these many and varied abilities for one single theme 
would be a task of excessive labor even were it possible. Con¬ 
sider then the task of the average teacher of English com osition 
who will frequently have 150 such themes to correct and evaluate 
in a single week. It is no wonder that the grades assigned to 
* themes are highly subjective, and are gravely influenced by 

the unconscious prejudice of an earnest and most conscientious 
teacher. To one teacher the excellence of form will be the sine 
' tua non of evaluation; to another, content; and the third may 
feel that neither content nor form can outweigh the damning 
evidence of grammatical inaccuracy. Each in her own way is 
striving to be fair and just; yet a pupil passing from one to 
another may be most unfairly judged. There is evident need for 
a standard measuring instrument in English corn osition which 
shall yield the same score for pupil John no matter who his teacher 
may be. And further, if this instrument will show that under 
teacher A, John made an appreciable and measurable improvement, 









while under teacher B. he made little or none, so much the 
better for John and his teachers. Still further, if Tom 
in Edmonton can match his score with that of his cousin John 
in Victoria, or with the boys and girls of his age throughout 
Canada, there is for him and his teacher an incentive for 
improvement of incalculable value. The test which forms the 
basis of this study is humbly offered as such a measuring 
instrument. 


(c) Former Work on Composition Scales. 

The field of English composition has not been neglected 
by educational metricians. There are at least twenty excellent 
composition tests, many of them the work, of nationally known 
stui ents, which have been published in cheap and usable forms. 

But these twenty or more may, with one exception, be divided 
into groups based upon the principle involved in their form¬ 
ation, The first group includes those tests which attempt to 
isolate and measure quantitatively some of the abilities included 
in English composition, more particularly the formal elements of 
lechanical and grammatical accuracy. To this class belong the 
illing Scale and the Van Wagenen English Composition Scales. 

The billing Scale calls for two separate measuresof ‘"story value" 
and "form value". The latter is measured from the actual mistakes 
occurring in a given paper at so many per hundred words compared 
with a type theme in the scale. The Van Wagenen Scale has three 
forms for narration, description, and exposition. In each of 
these three forms the type compositions have been evaluated with 
respect to three qualities, "thought content", "structure", and 
"mechanics". In using the scale each of these three qualities 
must be isolated and measured separately. While these tests have 
many valuable uses in diagnosis and corrective teaching, and are 
so used extensively, the average classroom teacher finds them dif¬ 
ficult to administer and still more difficult to score. They are 
tools for the expert rather than the novice. The second group 






















f 




f 

























( 4 ) 


of tests includes those which are pure quality scales of 
type themes arranged in order of excellence and assigned 
values based upon the opinions of a large number of qualified 
judges. The Hillegas Scale, constructed in 1912, was the 
first one of this type; and the several quality scales now 
in use are essentially modifications of the Hillegas Scale. 

The Nassau County Supplement to the Hillegas Scale, and the 
Hudelson Scale are noteworthy examples. Dr. S. A. Leonard 
of the University of Wisconsin at a later date completed a 
scale to measure purely composition ability exclusive of 
form. These quality scales are of great value and yield sig¬ 
nificant measures of pupil ability, yet they are not very widely 
used as an aid tc classroom teaching. One objection to them 
* is that they yield a very harrow range of scores, the differ¬ 

ence between the norm of one school year and the next being in 
some cases less than a unit on the scale. The other and more 
practical objection is that using them requires a considerable 
amount of painstaking labor; more than the average teacher 
seeus willing to give. The third type of composition test was 
developed by Courtis, and is unique. Each scale composition is 
printed in fae-simile on theme paper, and isemployed by being 
^ shuffled into a pile of themes written on similar paper. The 

themes are read and sorted into five piles representing five 
degrees of merit. If the scale themes are correctly distributed 
into the five piles, the reader may feel that his judgment is 
correct. It is obvious that this type of test is limited in its 
uses. 

(d) A Definition of this Experiment. 

There were three steps in the experiment from which the 
data for this study were obtained. The first step was the 
formation of the com osition test itself, which will receive 
detailed attention in Chapter III. of this study. The second 
ste was to secure scores made upon this test and upon actual 







( 5 ) 


themes written by the s me children in the grades of the 
elementary and high schools. To accomplish this, children 
in the elementary and high schools of British Columbia 
were selected to be the subjects of the experiment. The 
pupils in each section were notified several days in advance 
that upon a certain date they would be expected to write 
in class a short theme on the subject n My Blost Exciting 
Adventure." On the date set, the examiner distributed uniform 
paper and gave instructions for the writ!rig of the theme. Wo 
names were put oh the paper, but each student placed a code 
number on his paper, which corresponded with his name on the 
examiner's list* When ail the themes had been collected, they 
were distributed into two groups, one containing all the senior 
high school themes and one all the elementary school themes• 

The themes in each group were shuffled, a slip was attached to 
each paper covering the number, and they were then given in 
turn to three judges for evaluation* The judges were experienced 
teachers, who were at the time teaching English composition* A 
typewritten sheet containing the following directions was given 
to each judge. 

Instructions to Judges* 

1* that is desired in this experiment is an impartial, critical 
evaluation of the merit of the themes submitted. 

2. As you read each theme, base your judgment upon these points % 

a) Is the pupil able to express his thoughts in readable 
English without numerous or serious errors? 

b) Is he clear, logical, and concise;- or rambling and vague? 

c) Does he show maturity in thought, in structure, and in 
wording; or does he write primer sentences in a childish 
vocabulary? 

3. As soon as you have finished reading a theme, place it in 
one of five piles arranged on .a descending order of merit. Do 
not grade a theme or attempt to classify the pile at the first 
reading. 

4. I hen all have been road and placed in one of the five piles,

go through each pile and arrange the themes in order of merit, 
the best one on top. 

5. N w make sure that the last papers in pile number one are 
superior to the first paper in pile number two, and so on. 

6 . .hen all the pagers are arranged in a descending order of 
merit, as accurately as you can place them, assign a grade 

tc each paper on the basis of 100 points, assuming that a 

superior high school paper is worth not more than '5 points, 

and the most inferior elementary school paper-not less than 10 points* 

7 . Write nothing on the theme paper itself 5 record your 
grade on the loose slip attached at the top. 

ih.A.KS NO CORRECTIONS ON ANY J'APISH. 

£• Except when it influences spelling, or clearly indicates 
immaturity, do non let handwriting be a factor in your judgment. 

THIS EXPERIMENT IB A TEST OF COMPOSITIOI ;T. 


When one judge had completed grading the themes according 
to the foregoing instructions, they were returned to the examiner, 
the graded slip was removed, numbered, nd filed? a fresh slip 
was attached, and the papers were ready for the next judge. 

3y this means the value given by any one judge was in no way 
influenced by the score of the previous judge, and at the same 
0 time error was obviated by having the actual score attached 

to the paper when the judgment was made. When the report from 
the three judges was complete, the three scores assigned to 
each theme were averaged, and the resulting average score was 
recorded opposite the pupil’s name on the examiner’s list. 

Within a few days after the theme had been written, in 
all cases less than a week, each section was given the composition 
test as it appears on the following pages of this study. These 
test papers were scored by the examiner, and the pupil’s grade 
was entered upon the records opposite the average grade made 
by him on the theme. In this way the data for the relationship 
study were obtained and compiled.

The children of the elementary and senior high schools 
of Ocean Falls are fairly representative of the student 
population of any small city school population. They may he 

classed roughly into three social groups, although there is 

; 1 / 

no actual division./ There were* first, the sons and daughters 
of the resident administrative members, few in number and not 
distinguishable from any other students whose homes are in 
Ocean Falls. The second group is that of town children who 
for convenience of location or at the wish of their parents

//'i 

attend the Ocean Falls schools. About half of the school 


populations falls into this second group. The third group 
is that of children who have completed the eighth grade in 
adjoining rural schools, and who take up a temporary residence 
in the town for school purposes. Mot a few of this group are 
employed on part time to help earn their expenses * The 
absorption of these groups into the student body results in 
a typical school population, representing all degrees of native 
endowment, previous preparation, and social-economic background 


The work of approximately one hundred students in the 
tenth, eleventh, and twelfth grades was utilized; and the 
^ work of about .ninety more in the seventh,eighth and ninth grades

and of about IQo in the Elementary School.

(f) Deductions from the Experiment. 

The outcomp of the experiment reveals that English compos- 
i ition can be measured as a unit ability at least partially by 
means of an objective scale. The relatively small number of 
cases, together with the subjectivity of the judgments made of 
the theme papers limited the experiment as a scientific demon¬ 
stration. There is no doubt, however, that the scores upon an 
objective test are more reliable and accurate than the grades 
assigned to themes; and the results clearly urge a repetition of 
the experiment upon a larger scale and with a more refined tech 
nique. 





































































( 8 ) 


It was considered that the numbers used in 
the various grades of the elementary school were (with 
the exception of those in grade eight) too small to 
yield any valuable data. 

for this reason the scores made by pupils 
in grades 3 - 7 inclusive were not used in the statistical 
treatment of results. 










































THE THEORY GOVERNING THE 

tr'I H : ' 1 • . 


(a) The Formation of a Specialized Scale. 


Freeman saps, "Hov^ then, must w© 
proceed to the selection of subject 
matter for a 3 ecialized test? Obvious¬ 
ly the first ste is to locate the 
ability and to attempt to define and 
analyze it. Sometimes, although the 
ability may rightly be described as 
specialized, it is by no means simple, 
or unanalysable.' usleal ability, for 

example, has been analyzed by Seashore 
into some thirty components•" CD 

He then uiscueee's the component parts of the 
ability roughly classed as 11 musical ability,''" point¬ 
ing out particularly that ev n the finer divisions, as 
for example that ,f iten discrimination, are of them¬ 
selves' complex and unanalysable, then we Attempt to test 

, i 

one of these functions, w© cannot be sure that we have 
isolated any particular ability and tested it alone, but we 
do kno that what we have tested is a component of the more 
inclusive ability to be measured,•and the score yielded by 
the measurement of a . art is of significance in the measure* 
ent of the whole. 


- hat is true of musical ability is in this respect true 
of com osition ability. They are both highly com lex abilities 
made up of many parts, some easily accessible to measurement, 
and others not so readily tested. English composition is the 
employment of language by means of symbols to convey thought 
from the individual who has conceived it to one who @ay under¬ 
stand it. It is, therefore, a projection of the subjective into 
objective form. (2) 


"The content of language is subtle 
and is not objective except an it is given 
a form. It depends upon the vividness and 
the organization of ideas, and upon the 
wealth of associations which give the 
central ideas theii setting. These features

Te. ts • : ».i iy■■ : ensures . Houghton ilfflin Com any, ~:ew 'York, 

1 . 14 . . 2417 “ 











( 10 ) 


of content are expressed through the 
choice of words and the structure of 
sentences and paragraphs. In this 
way content and fora are so intimately 
connected that aside from the features 
of form which are specified by the rules 
of grammar, any attempt to measure one 
is made difficult by the presence of 
the other. Ability in composition is 
an unanalyzable composite of these two 
elements.” 




Composition ability, then, involves both content and 

form inextricably united. Any attempt to measure the 
ability must take cognizance of this fact, and avoid an 
artificial line of demarcation between content and form. 

The attempt is made, therefore, to measure composition as 
a complex and partially analyzable ability, selecting from 
the analysis those components which lend themselves readily 
to measurement. Quoting again from Freemanj 

"The second step, after we have 
defined the ability which is to be measured, 
is obviously to invent some means of measur¬ 
ing the ability in question. The method 
which has sometimes been used is that of 
analysis. The psychologist attempts to 
define to himself in psychological terms 
the nature of the ability, and then to 
assemble, or invent, tests which may be 
assumed to measure the capacity which is 
this analyzed. The problem is approached, 
in other words, from the a-priori point of 
view. On the other hand, the attempt may 
be made from a purely empirical point of view. 

The experimenter may try out one test after 
another without having particular reason to 
expect that one test will be more successful 
than another. He then selects the test or 
tests which prove by experience, or empirically 
to work, or io be successful. If several tests 
have been found by this procedure to be moderately 
successful, they may be combined into a team of 
tests. The method which is most likely to be 
successful, and to reach the solution most 
quickly, is a combination of the two." 

(b) The Theory Applied to This Scale. 

The method employed in the construction of the -scale upon 


which this study'is based was, as Freeman recommends, a com¬ 
bination of the a-priori and the empirical methods. The 
selection of subject-matter to be tested and the formation 
of specific tests is described in detail in Chapter III. of 





































































this study, but the general assumptions may be expressed 
here. It was assumed, for example, that ability to employ 
correct forms in punctuation, capitalization, and spelling, 
was positively correlated with general composition ability. 

The experience of generations of English teachers has made 
this assumption safe, even were there no objective studies. 

It was further assumed that the recognition of a sentence, 
and the ability to unite correctly sentence elements, were 
significant factors in indicating the quality of synthesis 
in composition. These were a-priori assumptions and tests 
were constructed to measure these abilities. 

On the other hand, the attempt to measure the quality 
of maturity gave rise to a number of experimental tests, and 
the empirical selection of one because of its greater success, 
t, ith tests adapted or invented which appear to measure specific 
abilities, and united to form a battery, or team of tests 
to measure the larger and more inclusive ability, the task 
remains to prove empirically that the battery of tests is an 
adequate measure of the general ability. If a test of this 
nature is constructed, and if the scores made upon it by students 
bear a direct, positive, and close relationship to the actual 
performance of the ability, the test may be said to be a 
measure of the general ability. The basic hypothesis of this 
study is that such a test may be formed in English composition 
which shall be a measure of the student’s quality, accuracy, 
and maturity in the actual writing of English themes at the 
time the test is given.

TEE METHOD OF CONSTRUCTING THE SCALE. 

(a) (B) Analysis of Composition Abilit ies into Specific Units. 

In the construction of this scale, a list of the regulations 
of English Usage found in all the English Grammar and Composition 
Text Books used in the nine Canadian Provinces was made under 
the following eight headings: 

(A) Capitalization. (E) Diction. 

(B) Punctuation. (Fj Paragraphing. 

(C) Spelling. (G) Maturity of Style. 

(D) Syntax. (H) Comprehension of Subject. 

(c) Arrangement according to Importance. 

After this list of regulations had been compiled and typed, 
it wap tested out in several of the schools in British Columbia, 
and arranged in units. Some of the regulations were found to be 
of little practical value and were, therefore, eliminated from 
the list. 


The regulations were then re-written carefully and the revised 
list submitted to twelve of the foremost teachers of English Comp¬ 
osition known to the author. These teachers were instructed to 
check the regulations under each heading, and to eliminate the 
regulations which, in their judgment, were of least practical 
importance. After obtaining and compiling these judgments, the 
set of regulations was again rewritten, eliminating the rules which 
the majority of these teachers decided were of impractical value. 

A list of sentences based upon the regulations was then com¬ 
piled in the form of an objective test. This test was to be used 
as a tentative scale for obtaining age and grade norms. 

The following pages contain a copy of the list submitted to 
the twelve English teachers.

CHAPTER IV 


(25) 


THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE SCALE. 

The task which faces every maker of tests at the outset is 
to compromise between the quality of reality in his test and the 
ea e of administration. In other words, he seeks to make his 
testing situation as nearly natural and spontaneous as possible, 
and at the same time to render the scoring purely mechanical and 
objective. This conflict may be seen in almost every objective 
test, resulting on ohe one hand in a sacrifice of reality to 
objectivity, and on the other hand a retaining of reality at 
the cost of scoring facility. The purpose and use of the test 
will to some extent decide this question. In this particular 
test, since its purpose is to provide a universal objective 
measure, the emphasis has been placed upon objectivity and ease 
in scoring. In some exercises it has been possible to secure a 
highly natural situation without loss in ease of scoring. 

Parts , A* and *3* of the Scale, the testing of mechanical 
errors in Capitalization and Punctuation, are illustrations of 
the sacrifice necessary to secure objectivity. The natural situat¬ 
ion would be to have the pupil write an original essay, following 
which the scorer would go through and correct each error made. 

The essay-writing method is used to some extent in the Van Wagenen 
Scale referred to in Chapter I, in which one of three measures is 
called "mechanics." But a measure secured this way is made at 
the cost of time and is susceptible to the vagaries of the examiner 
Therefore, a less real, but more accurate and objective device is 
desirable. The device of proof-reading is most frequently used, 
in which the pupil reads through a passage containing errors in 
form, and corrects them by writing in the proper form. Of such a 
nature is the Briggs English Form Test, in which t e directions are 
as folio ss "Read over each group of words (sentences) so as to 
get their meaning. Then put in the proper places capital letters, 
apostrophes, necessary commas, periods, and question marks.” The 
objection to ^his method is again one of difficulty in scoring. 






















t 






as the examiner must exercise a high degree of concentration to 
read the corrected papers accurately. A combination of the two 
plans, however, retains the value of the proof-reading device, and 
at the same time facilitates scoring. In this combination, the 
pupil is required to read a composition and to indicate his correct¬ 
ions at the side of the exercise m a vertical column as well as 
at the actual point of error. Obviously this is a more artificial 
situation than either of the former, yet it is justified on the 
grounds of objectivity, accuracy, and speed. This device has been 
employed in Parts 1 A* and *B' of this test, making it easy for the 
scorer to pass down the vertical column with the key and make a 
rapid correction. 

Part »C», Section (a), called Word Becall, is actually a 
spelling test. The aim has been here to create a test which should 
call forth spontaneously the pupil 9 s mental image of a given word 
uninfluenced by suggested spellings. Several devices were tried 
and abandoned. One wax the use of the desired word in a sentence, 
leaving blank spaces for recall from the context. Experiments 
proved that the recall from this device was too varied and uncertain 
to be practical. Another method was the recall of the word by 
association. Three synonyms or associated words were given, and a 
blank was left for the desired response. This was more satisfactory, 
but still too uncertain. The same device was modified by the addition 
of the first letter of the desired word, and the exercise like the 
sample below was given to one hundred high school freshmen as an 
experimental group. 

1. detach sever sunder s .______._ 

2. portion slice part p _______ _____ 

From the results of this experiment it was decided to offer the 
first two letters of the desired word, and the words themselves 
were arranged in order of difficulty as determined from the one 
hundred papers. This last revision made the recall practically 
automatic for the average student. In its final form, therefore, 

Part J C*, Section (a), appears as followss

In the practical use of the test it has been found that 
the number of omissions is so much less than the number of mis¬ 
spelled words as to render the element of omission negligible, 
ttith but two or three exceptions all the words of this test are 
taken from one or more of the "demon" lists, and are, therefore, 
justifiable on a spelling test. 

In Part *C’, section (b), two methods were tried* 1. Recog¬ 
nition; 2. Recall. The first method, which consisted of the 
choosing of the correct form from among four varied spellings, 
proved unsatisfactory. The second method, and the one finally 
adopted for the test, was of the recall type. It consisted of 
inserting the correct letters in a blank left in the word. Some 
of the words were chosen from "Demon" lists; others were chosen 
to test knowledge of common rules of spelling. 

Part 1 D*, which dealt with syntax was of the cross-out 
type. Examples embodying all the common rules of government and 
order were used. Since only two choices were given, the score 
was found by subtracting the number of wrong responses from the 
number of right responses. Omissions were not counted as wrongs. 

Part *E S , which dealt with diction, was divided into two 
parts: 1. Recall; 2. Recognition. 

In Section (a), the students were required to recall the 
forms of the verb necessary to complete a set of given sentences, 
in which blanks had been left • 

In Dection (b), the students were required to recognize 
and to indicate the correct forms in a list of miscellaneous 
expressions. 

In Part ’F 5 , (Paragraphing), the test was divided into 


two sections

( 28 ) 


In Section (a), the students were required to indicate 
the truth or falsity of a list of statements dealing with 
para, raph structure* 

In Section (b), the students were required to rearrange 
in proper order a paragraph containing jumbled sentences* 

Part *G* of the composition test was an attempt to measure 
the maturity of the pupils as this quality influences general 
writing knowledge. This portion of the test is largely empirical 
in construction. The writer has attempted to select from the 
papers of pupils some actual illustrations of those elements 
which seem to indicate maturity of thought} and to arrange them 
into objective exercises. The highly significant characteristic 
which differentiates the mature writer from the inexperienced 
and immature is his accurate use of words and his correct use of 
idioms and idiomatic grammatical forms. It is obvious that the 
term ’’mature" is here used with no reference to age, except as 
age may be incidental to maturity in expression. The young son 
of the minister or teacher who has heard nothing but the finest 
Engli h during his few years of age may evidence greater maturity 
in his expression than the average middle-aged plumber. 

Acting upon the assumption that this differentation in 
the employment of forms and idioms bears a direct relationship 
to maturity in expression, three exercises were constructed. 

Section (a) tested appreciation of harmony, ihythm, rhyme 
and fitness of meaning, of groups of words. 

Section (b) tested the ability of the student to recognize 
sentences, clauses, and phrases. 

In this connection it might be mentioned that the ability 
to construct a grammatical sentence, or to recognize one properly 
constructed, is by no means simple or unanalyzable. It Is, in fact. 







































(29) 


a highly specialized skill, involving mature mental powers of 

analysis, discrimination, co iparison, and synthesis. A recognition 
of the unitary character of the single sentence and its inalienable 
right to independence constitute what teachers call **sentence- 
sense.” This "sentence-sense” is a quality difficult to define, 
and difficult to teach; yet it is the very foundation upon which 
all written language is based. 


Section (b) is designed to test this sentence-sense 
as an indispensible part, and a significant measure of general 
composition ability. 


♦ 



Section (c) tested the ability of the student to grasp 
the exact shade of meaning of certain commonly misused words. 

It is perfectly true that there is no inviolable stand¬ 
ard of usage in the English language, and that some of the local¬ 
isms, idioms or provincialisms here counted incorrect, form a 
regular part of the oral usage of some teachersoof English; yet 
the only standard justifiable, that set by the best speakers and 
writers of the present time, would condemn all the expressions 
here counted wrong• 

In this exercise the student must indicate which expres¬ 
sion he judges to be correct by crossing out the incorrect word or 
words. 


In Part f H*, an attempt was made to test the amount 
cf understanding of the devices used by skilled writers. 

In Section (a) the student gives an indication of his 
analytical and synthetic power in composition by sorting out and 
reorganizing the given composition plan. This question was given 
with much success in the 1933 B. C. Matriculation Examinations. 

In Sections (b) and (c) the student indicates his 
familiarity with and understanding of the current business and 





















































( 30 ) 


social usage in letter writing. 

In Section (d) is tested the student's knowledge of 
the formal devices underlying the construction of clear, fore- 
ful and euphonious sentences. 

A reproduction of the complete test in the form 
in which it was mimeographed and distributed to the teachers is 
found on the following pages.

1663 east First Street, 

Vancouver, B. C., 
november 12, 1934. 

my dear Uncle John, 

we know that you are always interested in us. 

i am, therefore, writing to tell you about a ski-ing 
party which we had last Saturday. 

We were all to meet at the lord kitchener school 
at 8 o'clock in the morning. However, some of the boys 
were late, so our teacher, hr. anderson, read us some 
chapters from "treasure island"; arid one of the girls 
recited a piece of poetry from "The lady of the lake", 
beginning with the line: 

"the stag at eve had drunk its fill". 

When everybody had arrived, we piled into ford 
trucks that were waiting to take us to grouse mountain. 

On the wa we sang songs and told stories and 
stamped our feet on the floor of the truck to keep our¬ 
selves warm. Everyone was having a good time except a french ( )

boy who kept repeating, "my skis are lost I" 

After an hour of winding up the mountain side we 
saw the union jack flying from the hotel at the summit. 

When we reached the hotel yard we found out that the 
liberals and elks were giving a party for the crippled 
children. 

While we were putting on our skis at the do r of the 
hotel, we could hear thecehildren offering thanks to god 
for the food which he was about to provide. 

The odour of the food made us hungry, and some of us 
thought of buying our dinner at the hotel; but we saw a 
notice on which was written; 

meals 

1. Breakfast —» $ .50 

2. other meals - 1.00 


These meals were too expensive, so we ate the sandwiches, 
cakes, doughnuts, and other dainties which our mothers 
had prepared for us. 

After spending the whole afternoon ski-ing on the 
snowy slopes of the hills, we returned to town, tired but ( ) 
happy. ( ) 

How I will have to close. Give my love to aunt Jane.( )

these topics in their proper order. It is not necessary to rewrite 
the topics. T erely indicate the position of each by using the 
number that precedes it, and piecing this number on the proper line 
of the plan that follows the list. The five main headings should 
be placed on the lines indicated by the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5; the 
sub-headings should be placed on the lines indicated by the letters 
a, b, c, d, etc.

V e then revise what we have written. 

Then we make a formal plan. 

Thinking is also a good way to gather material. 

And last we proceed to the actual writing of the essay. 
Discussing the subject sometimes aids in getting material. 
Next we organize our material. 

Reading is perhaps the best way to gether material. 

We must then select what we need from the material that we 
have gathered. 

we must gather our material. 

Items that are irrelevant must be struck out. 

We first make a rough copy.

GENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR ADMINISTERING THE TEST 


On the following pages will be found the 
key to the several parts of the test. 

All tests are scored on a point basis. The 
answer is either all right or all wrong. If the answer 
is all right, one point is given for it. If any part 
of the answer is wrong, no credit is given. 

The weighting of the scores is carried out by 
following the directions given on the score key. 

This test is not a speed test but a power 
test. For the above reason the pupils may have as long 
as they need to complete each exercise. 

It usually has been found most convenient to 
give the first four parts of the test during a forty-five 
minute period, and the last four parts of the test during 
some other forty-five minute period.

THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE SCALE 

and cop :>srrioF kiting. 

(a) T he Pur'pose of the Scal e. 

As was stated in Chapter I., and further developed in 
Chapter II., the purpose of this study was to create an 
objective test in general English composition ability, and 
to com are the scores made on the test by a group of students 
with scores made by the same pupils on a sample theme. The 
degree of relationship exhibited by the parallel scores thus 
obtained would serve to indicate the validity of the test as a 
measuring instrument of composition ability. In this chapter 
the data secured from the experiment and recorded in Tables I. 
to X. of the appendix are subjected to statistical analysis to 
ascertain three important factst 

1) The coefficient of correlation between the scores on 
the test and the scores assigned the themes. 

2 ) The reliability of the coefficient thus obtained. 

3) The concomitant factors of the experiment which might 
influence the results. 

tc) Determining the Coefficient of Correlation 

between Scores on the Test and Scores Assigned 
the Themes. 

Tables I. to X. in the appendix are all constructed alike 
so that an explanation of Table I. will suffice to make clear 
the arrangement of all the data. Column i of Table I. has the 
heading, "Pupil’s Number 11 . This is the code number assigned each 
pupil from the class roll, and indicates the grade, the section, 
and the individual’s number. The themes written for this study 
had no names on them, but the pupil was identified by his code 
number written at the top of the paper. Column ii is headed "Judge 
A". The figures in this column are those assigned by the first 
judge to the themes submitted to her for evaluation. The third 
column is headed "Judge B", and contains the values assigned the 










V«JA; 






same set of themes by the second Judge. Column iv contains the 
values assigned the same themes by the third Judge. Column v 
contains the averages of the three values recorded in colu.ins 
ii, iii, and iv, determined by the arithmetical procedure of 
addition and division by three. These figures in column v are, 
therefore, simple unweighted averages. Column vi contains the 
scores made by pupils on the composition test as it appears in 
this study. From this arrangement of the data it may be seen 
that the two significant figures for comparison, namely, the 
average of values assigned each theme, and the corresponding 
test score for the same pupil, are in parallel adjacent columns, 
convenient for inspection. 


The figures found in columns v and vi of Tables I. to X. 
inclusive were arranged to calculate the coefficient of correlation 
by the product-moment method. (1) The formula given below was 
employed in the Calculation# 


sigiua x * y 1

r - the coefficient of correlation. 

sigma x’y* - the sums of the products of x and y 

deviations. 

x - the frequencies of the vertical columns, 
y - the frequencies of the horizontal columns. 

U - the number of cases. 

C - the calculated corrections, 
sigma - the standard deviation. 


Substituting in the values for these symbols obtained from 
the data yielded?

test and the average.values assigned to themes for 197 pupils 
was o 54. 


(d) T he Reliability of the Coefficient of Correlation • 

The reliability of the coefficient of correlation was found

by this formula. Cl) 

P.E.r = .6745 x ( 1 - r 2 ) _ 

v ___ 

P.E.r - the probable error of the coefficient, 
r - the obtained coefficient. 

N - the number of cases. 

hen the values are substituted: 

P.E.r — .6745 x .7084 

14.036 

P.E.r -- .034 

The probable error of the coefficient is thus found to be 
.034. This may be interpreted to mean what the chances are 
even that the true , r* does not vary from the obtained ’ r T by 
more than plus or minus .034, or that the true *r* lies within 
^ the limits .506 and .574. In 99 chances out of 100 the true 
*r* might vary from the obtained , r* by 4 x .034, or .136, so 
that the possible limits of the true *r* are .404 and .676. 




Another method of determining the reliability of a test is 


to determine how closely a score obtained on the given test 
approximates its corresponding true score. This may be found 
from the Standard Error of Measurement which is obtained by 
substituting the values into this formula: (2)

Since sigma is 11.0 when r z *54 and sigma is 16.2

when r ■ ,00, it is evident that a coefficient of .54 serves 


to reduce sigma to about 70% of what it would be in the event

of a guess. This means that a random guess at a score lies 
within an area which is 70% of the total range. 

(e) An Interpretation of the Results. 

From the foregoing calculations there have been obtained 
these figures; 

r » .54 

P.E.r = .034 

sigma s 11.0 

oa 

What do they mean? How do they apply to the composition test 
from which they were derived? A coefficient of correlation of 
.54 indicates a fair degree of positive relationship between 
the scores of two tests (in this case between a test and eval¬ 
uated thenes), but it leaves much to be desired, . hen r «* 1.00, 
the score on the test and theme for each pupil would be identical; 
when r * 0.00 they would bear no relationship to each other at 
•all. So an r of .54 means that the scores are only a little more 
than half-way toward being identical. The purpose of the 
com osition test, however, was to yield a score approximately 
identical with that given to a sample theme by the same pupil. 

If the theme score were a true value for the student*s composition 
ability, and if there were no other influencing factors, it 
would have to be granted that the test had come little way more 
than half toward fulfilling its purpose. 

The P.E.r of .034 has been interpreted in the section above; 
its significance lies in showing to what extent the true of the 
test may diverge from the obtained r. Since it is directly 
influenced by the value of F, the number of cases, it is greatly 
reduced by increasing N; and it is possibly by increasing N to 
1000 to reduce the P.E.r of this test to .014, a negligible 
quantity. 

The standard error measurement, or sigma is useful in 

(M) 

sho\ ing to what extent a score yielded by the test and compared 






































































f 

































( 54 ) 


with a theme score for the same pupil is better than a guess. 

When r - 0.00, the sigma is the same as the sigma of the 

(M) 

distribution, and an obtained score is no better than., a guess. 

When r - 1.00, the sigma is zero and the obtained score is 

(M) 

100% better than a guess. The figures for this test revealed 

a value for sigma of 11.0, and as the sigma of the distribution 

(M) 

was 16.2, and the sigma is seen to be 70% of the sigma of the 

(M) 

distribution. This means that on obtained score on the test is 
only 30% better than a guess, provided the theme score with which 
it was compared were an absolute true measure. 

C f) Conco it a.-it Factors Influencing the Results. 

> Any attempt to prove the vali / of a test statistically 

from a small number of cases is necessarily hazardous. Statistical 
results are approximations, approaching the truth more nearly as 
they are derived from larger samples. Therefore, a coefficient of 
correlation between the scores on an objective test, and an average 
of subjective evaluations, resulting in ,54 does not necessarily 
condemn the test as invalid, for the cases were few and several 
significant factors are still not accounted for, 

^ The chief variable not accounted for is that of subjective 

differences among the judges in evaluating the themes. A glance 
at Table I. of the appendix will reveal that three judges of 
equal ability and of equal thoroughness, graded the same theme 25 - 
82 - 68. The average of 58 does not represent a true evaluation 
for this the .es had there been fifty judges instead of three it is 
quite conceivable that the average might be even less than 26 or 
greater than 82. This is an extreme case, and the general results 
were on the whole far less subject to wide variation, but it illus¬ 
trates the factor of subjectivity which has greatly influenced the 
results. The data of the tables amply justify the statement in 
Chapter I. that the subjective grading of themes is unreliable and 
inaccurate. 


























f 








(55) 


values for the themes, there is still the evident fact that one 
sample theme may not represser t the general composition ability of 
a given student. The subject chosen, "My Most Exciting Adventure”, 
was selected because the experience of Iludelson and others has 
shown that a sample narrative affords the best medium for spontaneous 
composition for school children, but it is conceivable that such 
a topic might give undue advantage to one student and present a 
serious handicap to another. 

A third factor i fluencing the results is that of pupil 
indifference. A few students, when taking the test, apparently 
omitted sections of it through laziness or indifference, consequently 
lowering their test score to a point below their general ability 
in composition. Had there been a thousand pupils tested, these 
cases might have been omitted from the study, or even had they been 
included, the would have influenced the results but slightly. How¬ 
ever, five such cases out of two hundred materially influence the 
correlation by causing wide deviations from the central tendency. 

(g) Evaluation of the Results . 

The significant question to be answered in this chapter iss 
To what extent is the composition classification test as used in 
this study a legitimate measure of general com osition ability? 

It has been shown in the section above that the experiment was 
hampered by subjective influences difficult to control; that the 
number of cases used was too few to furnish positively accurate 
statistical proof; and that the test itself has not yet been per¬ 
fected to the point of highest reliability. Yet with all these dif¬ 
ficulties and weaknesses in the experiment, the results show that 
the test, used as a measure of general composition ability, and 
the theme, evaluated to furnish a criterion of measurement, have 
yielded a coefficient of positive correlation of .54. Therefore, 
























* 




















(56) 


it may be concluded that the test does measure general composition 
ability to a limited extent, and the results strongly suggest that 
v. ith a large number of cases, with a larger number of qualified 
judges, with a series of themes on different topics from each student, 
and with a revised edition of the test, that it may be conclusively 
demonstrated that general composition ability may be accurately 
and objectively determined by means of the composition classification 
test. 

It is the hope of the writer that he will be able to continue 
work on this test so chat it may be further revised and administered 
with a view to obtaining Canadian age and grade norms in Composition 
abilities. 

The writer has learned, from experience in teaching English 
during the past ten years, the need for some means of placing emphasis 
on the elements of English Composition. He has found that the 
text-book drill on these fundamentals did not carry over into the 
writing of Composition. The problem then became, "How to get this 
English material to Function in the Pupils* Daily Routine ork? u 
After consulting with Drs, H. E. Smith and J, Macdonald, it was 
decided to construct the preceding Language Scale whereby the pupil 
could judge his own written work. 

By using the Scale in connection with daily study of .English, 
the pupils would soon become familiar with the best English usage. 

The pupils could see objectively where they had failed in their 
Composition; how they had failed; and what principles of English 
usage they had violated. In this way, the three Psychological Laws, 
Readiness, Exercise, and Effect, were to be utilized to their ful¬ 
lest extent. 

This te. t will be invaluable if used with any good text book 
in the teaching of the principles of English Composition. After a 



















t 












t 







( 57 ) 


pupil has thus become familiar with these rules and their appli¬ 
cation, it will be easy for him to take his own written theme and 
find each error, together with the exact number of rule violated. 
The pupil desirous of improvement would take his theme and give 
considerable study to those points that he had missed. This con¬ 
stant drill in the Senior grades of the Elementary School and 
throughout all his High School course will certainly make him 
familiar ith the best forms of English usage and enable him to 
carry them with him throughout his life.

CRA TER VI. 

POSSIBLE UP PC OF THE SCALE IN TEACHING COMPOSITION* 

( a ) The Purpose of the Chapter* 

The value of any standardized test is determined pragmat¬ 
ically from its actual use as a tool in the classroom. Ro matter 
•ow clever or ingenious the test may be, or how sound its 
statistical reliability, if it is not convenient and practical 
to employ under normal classroom conditions its value is low* 

It is not the function of children to be the subjects of promis¬ 
cuous testing, but it is rather the function of the test to aid 
in the teaching of children. The purpose of this chapter is to 
establish the statistical reliability of the test, and to point 
out several ways in which the test may be used to guide and 
measure the teaching and knowledge of English Composition. 

The principal objective of this study is to create a 
useful and convenient test as an aid to the teacher of English 
Composition. The suggestions which follow do not have the author¬ 
ity of statistical evidence throughout, for the comparatively few 
cases and limited finances did not, permit of exhaustive research 
along the lines of greatest utility. On the contrary, the possible 
uses of the test open up interesting fields for further study and 
investigation, beyond the scope of this study, but essential to a 
complete knowledge of the test and its uses. The nature of these 
further researches is discussed more fully in Cha])ter VII. 

(b) The Reliability of the Scale. 

Since only one form of the test was used in obtaining the 
data for this study, the coefficient of reliability was determined 
by the technique of self-correlation. One hundred papers were 
chosen at random and the corrected responses to the odd numbered 
exercises and lines (1, 3, 5, etc.) were compared with the correct¬ 
ed responses to the even numbered exercises and lines (2, 4, 6, etc.).

x 


The sums of these odcl and even performance scores yielded two 
composite scores for each test paper, which were then correlated 
by moans of the product-moment formula as employed in Chapter V. 

The coefficient of self-correlation thus found is called r^, and 
represents the reliability coefficient for the half test. By 
means of the Spearman formula, given below, the coefficient is 
stepped up to the mathematical equivalent of a coefficient obtained 
by giving two forms of the test to the same group and correlating 
the whole scores. The formula and its use with the actual figures 
from this test follow: (1)

r x - the coefficient to be found. 

r^ - the coefficient obtained by self-correlation. 
By means of the technique described above. 

The one hundred test papers yielded a value 
for r^ of ,71. Substituting this value 
into the formula:

Longman*s Green and Company. New York, 1926. P. 271. 























































( 60 ) 


The figures obtained from the use of these formulas may be 
interpreted in this way: the chancds are even that the true *r T 
lies within the limits .83 plus or minus .021, or .819 and .851; 
or the chances are 99 in 100 that the true *r* lies within the 
limits .83 plus or minus 4 times .021, or between .746 and .914. 

Since in 99 cases out of 100 the true ' r* may differ from the 
obtained ' r* by .084, the test may be said to have only a fair 
degree of reliability, sufficient perhaps to furnish a rough 
measure of ability, but not accurate enough for a standardized 
test of wide applicability. The reliability may be increased in 
two ways; by increasing the length of the test, or by discarding 
faulty and misinterpreted exercises. A combination of these two 
methods if probably the best procedure. If the obtained 1 r' is 
raised in this manner to .90, the P.E.r is only .012, so that in 
99 cases out of 100 the true ’ r 1 would lie within the limits .858 
and .942, or would differ from the obtained 'r* by not more than 
.042, a difference of about half that found in the present test. 

It is obvious that the test as it appears in this study must be 
carefully revised to increase the reliability coefficient to at 
least .90. 

Another measure of the reliability of a test is called the 
index of reliability, and is found by using the following formula: (1 

r obt. true - \T r^2 

r obt. true is the coefficient of correlation between a series of 
obtained scores and their corresponding true scores, and r^g is the 
coefficient of self-corr lation. 

Substituting r 12 - .83 into the formulas 

r obt. true - V~~".83 

- .91 

The maximum value which the reliability coefficient can take is, 
therefore, »91 for this form of the test. Should the highest 


(1) op. cit. p. 273 











































( 61 ) 


r obt. true be only .80 or less, it would indicate that the test 
was not sufficiently reliable to justify its use even with 
revision. However, the reliability coefficient of .91 as obtained 
above is high enough to encourage revision and wider application 
of the test. 

{c) The Use of the Scale for the Classification 

of Pupils. 

The public and high school courses of study in English 
customarily have two aims. First, to develop skills and abilities 
in the use of written and oral English; and second, to create 
attitudes and ideals arising out of the appreciation of good 
literature. The second of these aims is at the present time 
beyond objective measurement, and while it is of great import¬ 
ance in the development of the child, it scarcely furnishes 
a basis for determining his position on the educational ladder. 

On the other hand, the development of skills and abilities in the 
use of English is more readily measured, and furnishes a practical 
basis for the classification of pupils in the English classes. 

The test incorporated in this study provides a more accurate 
measure of the pupil’s proficiency in general composition ability 
than is provided by a sample theme, even when the themes are careful^r 
graded by two or more impartial judges. The grades assigned 100 
themes selected at random from among those used in this study showed 
that the correlation coefficient between the grades given by two 
impartial judges was only .49 with a probable error of ,06, while 
the test in its present form yielded a coefficient of .83 with a 
probable error of .021. In other words, the score assigned to the 
themes varied from the true score by plus or minus .7071 of the 
sigma, or 12 points on a scale of 100; while a score earned by a 
pupil on the test varies only by plus or minus .4261 of the sigma of 
the test, or 6 points on a scale of 100. It is, therefore, evident 



















( 62 ) 


that the test furnishes a far more accurate basis for classify¬ 
ing pupils in composition ab-lities than does the reading of themes* 

In many schools it is found expedient to divide the pupils 
of a given grade into two or more sections in each major subject, 
forming the groups so as to be as homogeneous as possible. The 
test used in this study provides an objective and efficient instru¬ 
ment for the division of pupils into homogeneous sections in the 
high school English classes. 

(d) The Use of the Test for Classification of pupils. 

It is often difficult to assign new pupils to the grades 
> for which they are fitted when.they come from a different school 
system or another Province. Even with the increasing standard¬ 
ization of the present time, the quantity and quality of work 
expected from the same grade varies widely throughout the Dominion. 

To misplace a pupil is inefficient and wasteful and may work geat 
harm to the pupil. It is far more efficient to employ a standardized 
test for which norms have been found for each school grade, and to 
use the pupil’s achievement on the test as the principal factor in 
grade placement. 

Even from the small number of cases used in this study, 
there is revealed by the test scores a fairly even rise in achieve¬ 
ment spread over the grades tested. The averages were as follows?

These averages are represented graphically on the next 
page to show the rise in pupil achievement over the grades tested. 
It will be noted that the average for the eleventh grade is 
slightly below that of the tenth grade. There are two reasons 
for this fact; the eleventh grade had the smallest number of 
v u ils, thus subjecting the average more to the caprice of individ¬ 

ual scores, and the low score of 29 made by one pupil is entirely 
out of proportion with the rest of the class. The average for 
the eleventh grade without this one score is 69.5, and there is 
reason to expect that a much larger group would yield an average 
about midway between that of the twelfth and tenth grades. It is, 
therefore, indicated that wider application of this test would 
yield norms for the high school grades with a constant increase 
from the lower to the higher grades, and that such norms would 
furnish at least one important factor in the•determination of 
grade placement.

The increasing emphasis upon certain standards of 
attainment in specific skills necessitates the use of object¬ 
ive standardized tests. For example, proficiency in the 
fundamentals of number operations is required for admission 
to many junior high schools; spelling, reading, and penmanship 
are also standardized and used as a basis for promotion. The 
revised forms of the test used in this study may be employed 
to establish proficiency norms in English composition as a 
basis for a<mnission to the junior and senior high schools, 
and in the selection of pupils for the elective English courses. 
It is proposed to establish a proficiency norm in this test 
^ for promotion from the tenth to the eleventh grade English 

classes in High Schools in my inspectorate, with the expectation 
that such a standard will go far to raise the level of pro¬ 
ficiency in English Composition in the senior High School grades. 

(e) The Use of the Test for Diagnosis . 

Although the principal aim of the test has been to 
create a measure of general composition ability, there is 
nevertheless revealed a partial diagnosis of weakness and 
strength in certain fundamental skills. The following specific 
skills are called for in the test, end the failure of a pupil 


to respond correctly to

(17) The specific use of rules governing paragraphing. 

(18) The specific rules governing the use of adverbs 
and adjectives. 

(19) The ability to recognize compound and complex 
sentences• 

(20) The ability to distinguish between restrictive 
and non-restrictive clauses. 

(21) The ability to detect a clause or phrase wrongly 
used as a sentence. 

(22) The ability to recognize parts of speech. 

(23) The ability to use, or avoid, certain idioms and 
colloquialisms. 


While all of the skills listed above are used to some 
extent in responding to the exercises of the test, the chief 
diagnostic value will be found to lie in three fundamentals? 
spelling, punctuation, and sentence structure. Any real weakness 
in one or more of these is readily determined from the test. 

When the test has been i sed for classification or grade placement, 
it is worth while to review the papers to discover individual 
weaknesses in these fundamentals. But for purposes of diagnosis 
in a program of corrective drill, one of the many excellent 
diagnostic tests should be used.

CHAPTER VII, { 

corci;-.:ior: w.j hoc- ; r = tiopg, 

(a) Concl siono derived from the experiment. 

The concl e_ons from an experiment such as this, limited 
in scope, by time, and by subjective factors difficult to control, 
are necessarily partial .and indicative rather than authoritative, 
i'he ex eri ient undertook to measure com osilion ability, to secure 
significant scor for this abilityby means of an objective test, 
and to secure a comparison of the scorue thus obtained with the 
scores uon ev luated theme papers written by the ex eriment group, 
\rswers to the following questions were desiredi 

1, Is it possible to measure composition ability as a 
general ability? 

2m Can a test be constructed to yield significant scores 
of com osition ability measured objectively? 

3# Is a measure derived from such a test easier to obtain 
•unci more reliable than that obtained from the grading of theme papers? 

The fol owing conclusions are offered as the answers to 
the foregoing questions? they are. St in brief form. With a 
reference to the fuller discussion in previous chapters. 

1, The scores yielded by an objective test in composition 
abilities are more reliable than the scores awarded themes written 
>y the same pupil, end carefully graded by competent Judges, The 

ratio is tests themes 83 t 49. 

2, The test constructed for this study has in the original 
form a fairly high degree of reliability. The coefficient of self* 
correlation is ,83 with a probable error of ,021. The index of 
correlation is ,91. 

3, In s ite of the influence of uncontrolled subjective 

factors, oae scores upon the test when co ared with the theme grades 
reveal a definiu ve relationship. The coefficient of cor¬ 
relation was ,54, with a probable error of ,034. ot

least partially valid as a measure of general composition ability, 

4. The test may be used for the classification of pupils 
and for grade placement. The average scores for grades eight to 
twelve inclusive reveal a large positive improvement fairly evenly 
distributed, 

(b) Recommendations for further Study. 

It is the belief of the writer that the results of this 
study justify a repetition of the experiment on a much larger 
scale and with a more refined technique. If composition ability 
can be measured as a general ability, and the results of this 
study appear to indicate that it can be so measured, the fact 
^ has important educational implications. To the best of the 

writer’s knowledge, no other Canadian study to determine this 
fact has been projected up to the present time, so that this effort 
is a modest ste into the unknown. The experiment should be re¬ 
peated in a province-wide system with thousands of pupils avail¬ 
able as subjects. The aid of the classroom teachers should be 
invoked to construct a theme grading scale to be employed uniformly 
throughout the grades in which the experiment is to be conducted, 

% so that the element of subjective judgment may be reduced to a 

minimum. When such a scale has been perfected and used by class¬ 
room teachers, an average value for at least three themes from each 
pupil should be obtained from it. This procedure would furnish a 
criterion upon which to measure the scores made an the composition 
test; a criterion far more accurate . nd objective than that furnished 
by the procedure of this study. The use of the composition test, if 
it can be demonstrated to be a valid test, will be to eliminate the 
long and tedious process necessary to reach an objective measure for 
composition by grading themes. 

Several additional studies shouldbe made of the use of the test. 
I'orms should be determined for each of the elementary and high school 
grades from large numbers of cases widely distributed over the Domin- 



























(» 





& 









( 68 ) 


ion. A table of such norms would furnish an excellent basis 

for the classification of entering students in English composition 

and for the promotion of students to higher grades. 

Another interesting study would be the determination 
quantitatively of the factors of form and content as revealed 
by the test. It would be necessary to form two criteria from 
sample theme papers; one for form only, and one for content only. 
The values thus obtained when correlated with test scores by the 
same pupils would reveal the extent to wh ch the factors of form 
and content combine in yielding the composite score on the test. 

(c) Proposed Revisions of the Test . 

The test as it appears in this study was an experiment in 
test making. The fact that the separate exercises were based 
upon previous experiments no doubt contributed to the high self¬ 
correlation of the whole test, but the actual reliability of a 
battery test cannot be determined until it has been used in 
actual practice. The revisions proposed for the test are of 
three kinds. 

a) Lengthening. The reliability of atest is always 
increased by lengthening it, and many of the exercises of this 
test can be readily augmented. The test should be lengthened to 
include a few easier responses and several more difficult ones, 
thus providing a greater rarge in degree of difficulty. 

h) Alterations. From a large number of cases, those 
exercises which are faulty or which are misunderstood can be 
determined and remedied. Ambiguities and misunderstandings can 
be eliminated by effecting simple changes. 

c) Rewording. It is extremely difficult to word the 
directions to exercises in such a way as to make them brief, clear, 
and subject to but one i terpretation. The use of the test in 
this study has revealed the source of a few misunderstandings which 
can be eliminated by the rewording of the directions.

(d) General Summary. 

The results of this study may be finally stated in a 
few v/ords: 

Cl) English Composition may be measured as a general 
ability at least partially by an objective test, 

C2) The scores yielded by such a test are more accurate 
and less subject to personal judgment than the values obtained 
from graded themes. 

C3) The Composition test is of practical value to 
measure the progress of pupils in English Composition. 

C4) The determination of grade norms from such a 
test provides a sound basis for the classification of pupils in 
English Composition.
