INTRODUCTION 




- 1 - 

n.n essential antecedent of an investigation of drugs acting at the 
neuromuscular junction is an examination of the known anatomical, physiological, 
and pharmacological characteristics of this structure. 

1. IMERVATION OF SKELETAL MUSCLE 

The nerve supply of skeletal muscle is derived from anterior horn cells 
of the spinal cord and extends via the ventral nerve root to peripheral nerves, 
thence to the motor end-plates and to the muscle fibres. Each motor neuron may 
supply over a hundred muscle fibres. In the cat’s tenuissimus muscle as many 
as 140 to 160 muscle fibres were found to be innervated by a single motor nerve 
fibre (1). For the soleus muscle an innervation ratio of 1 - 120 has been 
established and for extensor longus digitorum a ratio of 1 - 155 (2). 

Such a ratio requires that there be extensive peripheral branching of 
individual nerve fibres. Eccles and Sherrington (3) counted the number of motor 
nerve fibres to the gastrocnemius medialis muscle and observed a considerable 
increase in number as they approached the periphery. The principal dichotomy 
takes place deep in the fleshy parts of the muscle and hence cannot be 
determined by their method. This branching has been shown histologically by 
Cooper (4). 

The complex of effects at the cell body of a somatic motor neuron in 
the anterior horn of the spinal cord causes a continuous normal discharge at 
a rate of 5 - 10 per second. This continues intermittently with other motor 
units of the same muscle. Recently a small nerve motor system has been studied 
in the frog which is tonically active reflexly for posture and evokes only 
local potentials and local shortening around the neuromuscular junction (5,6). 

It has been suggested by McCullough and Lettvin (7) that further investigation 
of the same unit in mammalian muscle and cord may discover a peripheral 
separation of two sorts of motor functions.

Increased stimuli cause more frequent discharges and tetanus is 
caused when the rate is about 60 - 100 per second. In addition to increased 
frequency of discharge, muscle contraction can also be increased by the 
recruitment of other units. When all, or nearly all, of the motor units 
controlling a muscle are firing at tetanic rate a maximal contraction is 
obtained (8,9). It is, therefore, apparent that gradation of motor activity may 
be achieved by variation of the rate of discharge and the number of units 
operating; and that long sustained responses such as those underlying postural 
mechanism are maintained by rates of discharge which are relatively low and 
which cause no fatigue. 


2. MORPHOLOGY OF THE MOTOR END-PLATE 


Efferent somatic nerve fibres may bifurcate several times on their way 
to the muscle. In the perimysium the nerve fibres undergo further branching, 
after which they lose their myelin sheaths and pass to the individual muscle 
fibres. The neurilemma of the nerve fibre appears to become continuaus with 
the sarcolemma. 

At the neuromuscular junction the motor nerve fibre forms an ending of 
variable complexity in a specialized region of the muscle fibre called the motor 
end-plate. Couteaux (10) has shown a structure which is separable from and 
outside of the terminal arborization of the nerve. Rod-like masses appear to be 
lined up in palisade formation perpendicular to the surface of the nerve terminals. 
From the ends of these which face the muscle, fine thread-like projections extend 
into the surrounding sarcoplasm. Cross sections show that the nerve endings lie 
in gutters or grooves. 

The electric organ of certain fish ( e.g. Torpedo ) is an accumulation 
of hypertrophied motor end-plates derived from skeletal muscle but without the 
contractile element, which are called electroplaxes. The electroplax contains

palisade cells, lining the region where the terminal arborization of the nerve 
makes contact with the eleetroplax, which are very similar to those mentioned 
by Couteaux and would appear to be of some physiological importance in 
neuromuscular transmission. 

The underlying significance of the normal plemnorphism of the motor 
nerve plates in striped muscle is unknown. Carey (11) has presented evidence 
that variations in the size, shape, and internal structure of mature motor 
nerve plates is determined by functional ameboidism. Relaxed muscle fibres 
with coarse, widely spaced striations are associated with retracted nerve plates 
consisting of coarse fronds; whereas contracted muscle fibres with more 
obliterated dark bands are associated with expanded nerve plates consisting of 
thinner branches. Increased functional activity causes substantial extension 
of the processes of the nerve plate which appears to favor the conduction of 
impulses from nerve to muscle by increasing the surface area of the plate. 

3. IMPULSE TRANSMISSION ACROSS SYNAPTIC AND 
HEURQMUS CULAR JUNCTIONS 


(a). Chemical Theory 

In 1904, T.RAElliott (12), impressed with the close similarity of action 
between sympathetic stimulation and small intravenous injections of adrenalin, 
suggested that the latter might be formed by sympathetic nerve stimulation. 

Then Langley (13) suggested that effector cells have both excitatory and 
inhibitory " receptive substances Tf and that the response to epinephrine 
depended on which type of substance was present. 

Dixon (14) advanced the important idea that the vagus nerve liberated a 
muscarine-like substance which acted like a chemical transmitter of its impulses. 
Dale (15) was so impressed with the fidelity with which acetylcholine reproduced 
the responses to stimulation of parasympathetic nerves that he introduced the 


term " parasympathomimetic " to characterize its effects. He also noted the brief

duration of this chemical and believed that an esterase in the tissues rapidly 
splits acetylcholine to acetic acid and choline, the latter being a much less 
potent compound. 

Loewi (16), in 1921, demonstrated the production of a chemical agent at 
postganglionic parasympathetic endings. In his experiments he showed that Ringer's 
solution perfusing a frog's heart acquires a substance during vagal stimulation 
which causes slowing of a second perfused heart. This ft vagus substance " as he 
called it has since been identified as acetylcholine by a number of tests (17,18). 

Considerable evidence furnished by numerous workers has since shown that 
in every muscle and gland innervated by parasympathetic fibres acetylcholine is 
liberated at the endings of these fibres: e.g. stomach (19), small intestine 
(20, 21), and salivary glands (22). 

A very important extension of this concept of the transmissions of the 
excitatory state by acetylcholine was its application to transmission from 
pre- to post-ganglionic neurons at the autonomic ganglia (23,24,25,26,27).This 
was demonstrated by perfusing an isolated sympathetic ganglion (usually the 
superior cervical ganglion) and testing the perfusate for acetylcholine after 
stimulation of the preganglionic fibres. The mediator appears in the perfusion 
fluid only after preganglionic and not after antidromic stimulation, and is not 
liberated spontaneously in the absence of preganglionic stimulation. 

The conception that acetylcholine acts as the chemical transmitter in 
the central nervous system is a logical extension of the theory of chemical 
transmission by acetylcholine across ganglionic synapses and from motor nerve 
endings to the motor end-plates of skeletal muscle (28). On autonomic ganglia 
and motor end-plates acetylcholine probably acts by virtue of its aepolorizing 
property which has been demonstrated by Beutner and Barnes (29). In fact 
acetylcholine injected into the electric organ of some fishes has been shown to 
have an electrogenic effect (30), It is somewhat doubtful as to whether acetylcholine 
can act in this manner on the central nervous system, however, as atropine

antagonizes the central depressant actions of acetylcholine and there is ho evidence 
that atropine is able to counteract, by a polarizing action, the depolarizing one 
of the acetylcholine (28). 

It has been shown that nervous tissue is capable of synthesizing 
acetylcholine (31,32). The only non-nervous tissue in which synthesis of 
acetylcholine has been observed with certainty is the human placenta (33,34). 

The effect of acetylcholine on parts of the central nervous system has 

been demonstrated by a number of workers. Miller and co-workers (35) applied 

acetylcholine to the motor cortex of cats and rabbits and obtained a result 

similar to a weak eserine action. Dikshit (36) observed that intraventricular 

injections ofacetylcholine in very small doses produced irregularities of the 

heart similar to those obtained with central vagus stimulation. The area 

affected is probably the hypothalamus. Discharge of motor impulses to skeletal 

muscle was noted by Bulbring and Burn (37) and Calma and ..right (38) when 

acetylcholine was applied to the spinal cord. A depressant effect on the spinal 

cord is reported by Schweitzer and Wright (39) as a result of work on the knee 

jerk. The flexor reflex was depressed by acetylcholine in cats (40), but 

slightly augmented in dogs (37). Inactivation of the cholinesterase in the 

frog’s cord has been shown to have no effect on the synaptic potential set up 

by single or repetitive stimulation (41,42). Futhermore, the addition of 

-3 

acetylcholine in concentrations as high as 10 has only moderate depressant 
action. This contrasts with the neuromuscular junction where a greater depressant 
action is exerted on the end-plate potential by 1/500 of that concentration of 
acetylcholine (43). Eccles (44) concludes that, in view of the extremely low 
acetylcholine content (28) and choline aeetylase activity of dorsal roots (45), 
acetylcholine plays no significant part as a transmitter in the monosynaptic 
pathway through the spinal cord. 

Feldberg (28) states that the presence of acetylcholine and cholinesterase 
in central nervous tissue, the ability of such tissue to synthesize acetylcholine 
and to release it under certain conditions, the central effects of acetylcholine

and of eserine, all provide strong evidence in favor of the theory that the 
transmission across a number of synapses in the central pathway of autonomic 
and motor neurons occurs through the mediation of acetylcholine. On the other 
hand there is little evidence in favor of such a mechanism of transmission 
across certain other central synapses. 

In a manner similar to that employed in the examination of parasympathetic 
nerves, a substance has been detected which is released by sympathetic nerves 
(46). This substance has been called " sympathin ”, which is either closely 
related to but not identical with epinephrine (47), or epinephrine itself (48), 

In order to meet the need of describing and identifying nerve-fibres 
by their chemical function, apart from their anatomical connections the words 
"cholinergic” and "adrenergic” were introduced by Dale to indicate whether the 
effects are transmitted to the effector cell by the release of acetylcholine or 
of sympathin, respectively. 

The motor nerves activating skeletal muscle have been shown to be 
cholinergic (49) • 

According to the earlier neuro-humoral theory of excitation, the molecules 
of cholinergic substance constitute the sole excitatory agents. With the arrival 
of impulses, the concentration of acetylcholine increases rapidly and chemically 
excites the receptor to start a response. This accomplished, it is destroyed by 
cholinesterase. 

Cholinesterase is a heat-labile enzyme which is capable of hydrolyzing 
acetylcholine (50). It is found widely distributed in the organs and fluids of 
the body. This enzyme differs in certain respects from tissue to tissue. The 
concentration is high everywhere in nerves, although it rises at the region of 
the synapses (51). It is distinctly different from all other tissue esterases in 
the body. The removal of acetylcholine at the necessary rate to account for the 
very short (2 msec.) delay at synapses is quite possible according to Naehmansohn 
(51). An increase in cholinesterase content of venous blood from stimulated

muscle has been observed (52). When cholinesterase is inhibited by physostigmine, 
or prostigmin, or D.F.P., the action of acetylcholine is prolonged and 
intensified as would be expected. 

(b). electrical Theory 

There are many facts which are inconsistent with the theory of chemical 
mediators to skeletal muscle (53)» These have led other workers to concentrate 
on a physical or electrical hypothesis of synaptic and neuromuscular transmission® 
There is considerable evidence that the transmission of impulses is 
mediated by cateletrotonic potentials set up at the synaptic membrane of the 
post-synaptic cell - the end-plate potentials of skeletal muscle (54,55,56) , the 
synaptic potentials of ganglion cells (57,58), and the motoneurones (41,59). 

ii theory of electrical transmission has been postulated by Secies (60). 

A short summary of its main points are as follows; 

(1) . An impulse in a pre-synaptic nerve fibre generates a current which 
gives a diphasic effect at the synaptic region of the post-synaptic cell, with 
a total duration of probably not more than 1 msec, in mammalian muscle and the 
spinal cord; initial anodal focus, with cathodal surround; more intense cathodal 
focus; with anodal surround. 

(2) . This cathodal focus sets up a brief and intense local response at the 
synaptic region. 

(3) . From this local response, a catelectrotonus spreads deerementaily over 
the post-synaptic membrane. 

(4) . A propagated nerve impulse is set up in the post-synaptic cell, if this 
catelectrotonus is above a critical value. If it is below, them, as the local 
response subsides, the catelectrotonus surround decays passively. 

This hypothesis is shown by heeles to offer a satisfactory explanation 
of many fundamental:observations on synaptic transmission, some of which were 
inexplicable in detail previously; irreversibility; synaptic delay; time course 
of junctional potential; brief impedance loss at end-plates; and dorsal root 
potentials of the spinal cord.

However, the hy othesis encounters difficulties in explaining the 
action of curare and of anti-cholinesterases on synaptic transmission in ganglia 
and skeletal muscle, cetylcholine is here relegated hy .^ccles to a subsidiary 
role, hence the action of anti-cholinesterases cannot be satisfactorily 
explained. In 1948 Bccles (61) stated that the electrical theory provides a 
satisfactory explanation for spinal cord transmission, but that neuromuscular 
junction transmission appears to be exclusively cholinergic. 

(c). Dual Theory 

The most recent developments of the acetylcholine hypothesis postulates 
that electrical transmission across the synapse excites the post-synaptic 
release of acetylcholine which then sets up the electrical potential (60). 
n.s a general scheme the folio ing sequence can be presented : nerve impulse - 
transmitter - end-plate potential - muscle impulse. ..cetylcholine is responsible 
for the end-plate potential (51, 62). This theory satisfactorily explains the 
action of curarine. acetylcholine release is not affected by curarine but it 
opposes its depolarizing action on the muscle membrane. So also the action of 
the anti-cholinesterases can be explained. 

The conclusion drawn by Monnier (53) is that neither of the two theories 
chemical or physical, of neuromuscular transmission alone can provide satisfactory 
interpretation of all the experimental data. Both theories have to be referred 
to, and sometimes simultaneously* Ee suggests that until further experimental 
data upset such a dual theoretical interpretation the task is to reconstruct 
the expression of each theory; so that, complementing each other, they give 


a satisfactory picture

4. GENERAL PHARMACOLOGY OP DRUGS USED IN THIS 
INVESTIGATION 


A knowledge of the general pharmacological properties of the drugs used 
is necessary for an evaluation of the effects elicited on the particular organ 
experimentally examined. 

(l). Barbiturates 

(a) . Central action 

The brain is the chief site of action in that hypnosis and amnesia, 
and in high dosage, anesthesia and coma, are the commonly expected dominant 
effects. Massermann (63), on the basis of electrical stimulation of the anterior 
hypothalamus, found that a barbiturate (amytal) caused a depression or diminution 
of ffeaetivity of this region; while small doses produced little effect on the 
motor cortex. On the other hand, Fulton and Keller (64) reported depression of 
the cortex after pentobarbital prior to depression of the hypothalamic centres. 
Indirect evidence points to the basal ganglia and hypothalamus as being the 
regions of the greatest susceptibility (65). Some workers (66) have found a 
higher concentration of barbiturates in the hypothalamus than in other parts 
of the brain. Others (67) did not observe this. 

Direct effects on the spinal cord have been ’shown by Dawson and Porter 
(68) and by Porter and Allamon (69). In the spinal cat they showed a markedly 
raised threshold of flexion reflexes. Yan Harreveld (70) was able to depress the 
knee jerk completely with pentobarbital. 

(b) . Effect on Circulation 

Ordinary hypnotic doses of barbiturates have little effect on the cardio¬ 
vascular system. The blood pressure and heart rate may fall somewhat due largely 
to the quieting action or sleep, produced by the medication. 

It has been demonstrated that some barbiturates - most notably amytal - 
depress the cardiac vagus mechanism (71), and the peripheral vagal ganglia 
(72,73). Acetylcholine continues to be active during amytal action, hence Garry

concluded that the post-gang]#xnmc fibres are still responsive. Koppanyi et al 

(74) concurred in that the effect is largely limited to the ganglia. 
Thiobarbiturates are said to sensitize the vagus. No significant alteration in 
heart action, in clinical dosage, can be ascribed to the specific activity of 
either barbiturates or the thiobarbiturates (75). 

In heterothermic animals, barbiturates when applied directly to the 
heart, cause paralysis of both ganglia and nerve endings (76). 

A drop in blood pressure has been reported by Gruber and Roberts (77) 
but according to Bleckwenn (78) this occurs only on acute administration. Tatum 

(75) states that after a lapse of an hour or more the blood pressure becomes 
stabilized at a level essentially normal. The drop in blood pressure is due to 
vaso-dilatation. 

Stavraky (79) has shown that arnytal depresses or paralyses the chorda 
tympani nerve in the dog, as there is no secretion observed on stimulation. 

(c). Effect on smooth muscle 

Gruber et al (80) demonstrated that barbiturates in any effective 
concentration produce depression of smooth muscle and attributed any 
manifestation of stimulation to alkalinity. Quigley and Phelps (81) observed 
inhibition of gastric muscle tone in normal dogs as well as in denervated dogs; 
h.ence the depression is either on the muscle itself or on the peripheral 
neuromuscular mechanism (75). Burstein (82) showed a primary depressant action 
of short-acting barbiturates in vivo followed by a prolonged increase in 
contractions and tonus. Gruber (83) observed a decrease of tonus and amplitude 
of contractions of duodenal ,jejunal, and ileal loops in unanesthetized dogs; 
and a decrease in tonus of the stomach muscle (84). 

The bladder (85), ureters(86,87), and uterus (80) have been shown to 
be depressed by barbiturates. 

Gross and Cullen (88) have shown that sodium pentothal depresses the 
response of striated muscle to intra-arterial injections of acetylcholine.

This they interpret as a curariform action. Huston et al (89) obtained a depression 
of the somatic neuromuscular junction in perfused dog's legs with high dosages 
of sodium pentobarbital and seconal. The response of the muscle fibres was 
found to increase in partially denervated legs. 

(d). Effect on Metabolism 

Effects of barbiturates on metabolism have been shown to vary depending 
on the dosage used. Light hypnotic doses cause no change in basal metabolic 
rate, whereas large doses cause a decrease in basal metabolic rate. A reduction 
in oxygen consumption has.been reported by Dameshek (90) and other workers 
(91,92, 93). Dameshek ascribed this fall to an action on the hypothalamus but 
Tatum believes it is yet too early to extend these results to ventral effects 
so far as mechanism of action is concerned. 

(2). Sodium Diphenyl-hydantoinate (Dilantin, Diphenate) 

This drug was introduced by Merritt and Putnam (94) for the treatment 
of epilepsy, on the basis of its anticonvulsant action in animals. Intravenous 
injection produces a marked fall in blood pressure; depression of the vagus nerve; 
and depression of respiration (95). Death with excessive doses occurs due to 
respiratory paralysis. Intraperitonneal injection in rats of a dose just under 
the LD 50 causes excitement, foilo?>/ed by exophthalmus, unsteady gait with the 
posterior extremities spastic and spread far apart in walking, and finally the 
animal either goes into convulsions or becomes depressed (96). 

In rabbits, which had been administered diphenyl-hydantoinate 
intravenously a determination of tissue concentration showed the highest 
concentration to be in the liver, followed by brain, kidney, blood and muscle 
in that order (97), It is not excreted as such (98). ,h.s an anticonvulsant, single 
large doses administered parenterally are not protective (99) but even appeared 
to act synergistieally with metrazol to produce long lasting severe convulsions. 

A small daily dose is protective. 

Certain other substituted hydantoins have been investigated by Merritt 


and Putnam(lOO).

(3) . Tridione (5,5,5 - Trimethyloxazolidire-2,4-Dione, Trimedone, Triinethadione) 

This drug is quite specific in the treatment of petit mal seizures (101, 
102,103). Photophobia is the most frequent side effect (103). Frequent skin rashes 
and occasional blood dyscrasias are observed; reversible renal damage has also 
been reported. 

Qne of the outstanding properties of tridione is its low toxicity. 

Richards and Everett (104) present the toxicology in table form. Sleep occurs 
only with very high doses, approaching lethal levels. With lower doses animals 
may show various degrees of ataxia. Extremely high doses result in death firom 
acute respiratory depression after a lengthy coma. 

The lethal dose is 1.5 to 2.0 gm. per Kg. body weight by intravenous, 
intraperitoneal, or subcutaneous injection. 

(4) . Curare 

Curare was used in some of our investigations as a physiological tool 
to cause paralysis of the neuromuscular junction. Bonnardel (105) has shown that 
excitability curves of the sciatic-gastroenemius preparation, after curare, are 
identical with those obtained from muscle after nerve degeneration. There are 
many South American arrow poisons which have been called "curares”. Comparatively 
little work has been done with the pure alkaloids, and of these, only two are 
widely used. These are curarine and d-tubocurarine. 

Each of-thettwo theories of neuromuscular transmission postulates an 
explanation for the action of curare. According to the electrical theory curare 
acts by suppressing nerve impulses at their terminals, or by a change in the 
muscle which results in a raised electrical threshold. McIntyre (106) indicates 
that any theory of curarization based on changes in electrical threshold of 
muscle is apt to be subject to criticism. According to the chemical theory of 
transmission curare causes either failure of production of the transmitter or 
failure of the transmitter to accomplish its usual effect. The latter view is 
generally accepted (107). 

Curarine applied to autonomic ganglia blocks synaptic transmission (108). 
d-Tubocurarine causes block also but more slowly. 















- 13 


The effects of a sufficient concentration of a curare on the central 
nervous system are a transient increase in activity, followed by a decrease (106), 
Paralysis of muscles occurs in the following sequence; short muscles of 
the toes, ears, and eyes; then the limbs, head, and neck; finally the re^airatory 
muscles, first the thoracic, then the diaphragmatic, and lastly the abdominal. 
Death is due to respiratory paralysis. If artificial respiration is maintained 
a fall in blood pressure is noted due to action on the ganglion cells, causing 
peripheral vasomotor depression. The beat rate is very greatly accelerated due 
to depression of the vagus ganglia. 


5. MECHANISM OF ANTICQNVDLSANT ACTION 


Since this investigation deals largely with the action of anticonvulsant 
drugs a knowledge of their mechanism is of significance. 

The mechanism by which anticonvulsant drugs prevent or mollify or reduce 
frequency of clinical seizures may be : 

(a) . An action upon a non-neural lesion; 

(b) . An action upon the abnormally altered neurons to prevent their excessive 

discharge; 

(c) . An action upon normal neurons to prevent their being stimulated by 

excessive discharge (109). 

The third category appears to be the most important. Clinical experience 
presents many illustrations of drug action in which the chain of convulsive 
activity is severed somewhere betv^een seizure focus and widespread involvement 
of the normal brain. The reported actions of anticonvulsant drugs upon normal 
brain can be broadly divided into two major groups: (a) increased threshold for 
an exeiting agent; (b) decreased responsiveness of the excited system. Merritt 
and Putnam (110) have done much to develop.the: idea that increased threshold 
is the modusoperandi of anticonvulsant action. The most commonly accepted drugs

have been shown almost without exception to raise the threshold, for either 
electrical or chemical stimulation or both (111,112). Peripheral nerves when 
subjected to excessive stimulation may produce double or multiple action 
potential spikes (109), which results in an extreme degree of supernormal 
excitability. These effects are prevented by the common anticonvulsants. 

Barbiturates appear to increase the threshold and to prolong recovery 
time of neurons after impulse propagation. This probably accounts for most of 
the central depressant actions which have been studied (113,114). Diphenyl- 
hydantoin may reduce seizure activity at all levels of the brain (109). On 
peripheral nerves it has little effect on the threshold and the recovery 
process^ 

Everett and Richards in 1944 (115) reported that tridione raised 
thresholds both for chemically and electrically induced seizures.

STATEMENT OF- THE PROBLEM 










- 15 - 


STATEMENT OF TH3 PROBLEM 


The action of barbiturates on the peripheral endings of autonomic 
nerves is well known, and since the chemical mechanism of transmission in the 
somatic junction is analagous to that in the autonomic system, and possibly to 
that in the central nervous system, it follows that the barbiturates might also 
affect peripheral somatic endings. Huston, Martin,and Dille (89) demonstrated 
that pentobarbital and seeonal depressed the somatic neuromuscular junction at 
concentrations 10-20 times the estimated effective concentrations at other synapses. 
At this concentration, however, an initial stimulant effect on the muscle was 
noted. One purpose of this investigation is to examine further the action of 
barbiturates on the somatic system. 

An examination of the peripheral action of certain anticonvulsant drugs, 
which are not effective primarily as hypnotics, is the further aim of this 


research

1. METHOD 


Apparatus (Fig. 1) 

(a)• Method of simulation 

Various forms of stimuli, such as mechanical, thermal, chemical and 
electrical, applied to the muscle directly or to the innervating nerves, are 
used in experimental work. 

Electricity was used by us throughout as it is available and convenient, 
easily controlled as to strength and speed of application and least destructive 
of the tissues stimulated. 

Induced current regulated by an inductorium was used as the electrical 
stimulus. When a muscle or nerve is stimulated by the current from an inductorium 
two responses occur : first, when the primary circuit is closed, and second, when 
it is broken. The resulting electrical shocks are termed the make and break shock 
respectively, and ordinarilj?- one or the other is rendered ineffective by means 
of a shut switch which shorts the secondary coil of the inductorium at the 
time when the undesired shock is produced. When it becomes necessary to 
administer single shocks repeatedly at regular intervals over a period of time, 
some automatic device is desireable. 

The apparatus used was as follows : two fibre disks were mounted on the 

shaft of a motor turning at a speed of one revolution per minute. Slots were 

cut in the periphery of the disks in such a manner that as the vanes revolve 

they depress two long steel springs from a Harvard Vibrating Interrupter which 

close mercury contacts. The two disks are not in exact alignment, which results 

in the outer mercury contact being closed before the inner set. Since this 

contact is connected across the secondary of the inductorium, the secondary is 

shorted, and as the disks continue to turn, the primary circuit is closed; 
after which the secondary circuit is opened by the outer disk to be followed 

by the production of a break shock as the primary circuit is opened by the 


inner disk

Six vanes on the disk produce stimuli at intervals of ten seconds. A 
current of two volts from a storage cell supplies the primary current. 

It is necessary to have the motor of the automatic device some distance 
from the inductorium to prevent it setting up induced currents in the inductorium. 

This method did not prove entirely satisfactory in our work and was 
replaced by an electronic stimulator (Fig. 1). 

A 110 volt i*.C. current charges, through a resistance, a condenser which, 
when fully charged discharges a direct current through a second resistance to 
give a single shock. It is possible to adjust the apparatus so that shocks are 
delivered at definite intervals. The first resistance in the circuit requires 
a different time interval for the condenser to b ecome fully charged. The second 
resistance can be adjusted to deliver any degree of shock over a limited range* 

In all our work shocks which produced maximal response were used at 
ten second intervals. This method of stimulation proved highly satisfactory. 

(b) . Method of Securing Animals and Recording 

Albino strain rats were used throughout. The rat is immobilized on its 
back by passing cords attached to three legs through holes in a small table. 

The other hind leg was rigidly clamped at the knee joint and the ankle bone 
in clamps which are fixed to the table. A cord attached to the.calcareous 
tendon was led over a pulley and attached to an isometric spring muscle lever 
which recorded on a slowly moving kymograph* 

(c) . Artificial Respiration Apparatus 

When it was desirable to use high doses of depressant drugs it became 
necessary to keep the animals alive by artificial respiration. 

A simple means of giving artificial respiration designed for these 
experiments is shown in Fig. 2 and in operation in Fig. 1. 

The butt-end of an ordinary three way glass stop-cock was attached by 
a means of a short piece of rubber tubing to the axle of a slow-epeed motor. The 


single outlet of the stop-cock was connected bo a tracheal cannula made from a glass

T-tube. A rubber tube connected the compressed air to one of the inlet tubes 
of the stop-cock. A three way stop-cock was used so that connection with the 
outlet tube was made only once per revolution of the motor. 

The amount of air entering the lungs is controlled by an adjustable 
screw-clamp on a piece of rubber tubing attached to the side-arm of the cannula. 
Air is forced into the lungs only when the oblique passage in the stop-cock 
connects the compressed air tube to the cannula tube. During the balance of the 
complete revolution,expiration takes place through the side-arm of the cannula, 
which must always be partially open. 

Very efficient ventilation of the lungs was accomplished in this way 
and deeply curarized animals, and animals which have had twice the minimal 
lethal dose of a barbiturate have been kept alive over long periods of time. 

2. PROCEDURE 


The spinal cord of the rat was sectioned at the upper lumbar region 
under ether anesthesia and the rat left twenty-four hours to recover from 
the effects of the anesthetic. The animal was then tied down on the small 
table (Fig. 1}. The caleaneous tendon was freed from the skin and fascia and 
severed at its attachment to the caleaneous bone. A cord attached to the 
tendon was secured to the isometric spring. 

The sciatic nerve was exposed above the point where it enters the muscle 
and was clamped in a shielded electrode. It was then cut centrally. ..hen 
denervated preparations were used, stimulation was by means of fine wire leads 
stitched into the be.ily of the muscle and attached to the tendon. 

A normal level of response to electrical stimulation was obtained for 
approximately 90 minutes before a drug was administered. 

The measurement of response was made prom the resting level of the 
muscle and was calculated as force of contraction in grams. Experimental 










21 


changes were reported as a percentage of the contraction tension before 
injection with the experimental drug. 

In denervation experiments one leg was partially denervated by aseptic 
section of the sciatic nerve in one thigh. 1* period of five days was allowed 
for nerve degeneration. According to Cook and Gerard (116) degeneration would 
be complete in this time.

The response of the normal muscle was found to decrease slowly over 
the experimental interval due possibly to fatigue, or temperature changes in 
the muscle. It was therefore necessary to run a series of control animals to 
establish a criterion for the experimental results. Table I presents the results 
obtained with thirty normal rats. It will be noted that the mean shows a slow 
decline. The last ten experiments were carried for a much longer period of 
time than the first twenty. 

1. Barbiturates 

(a). Sodium Amytal (Sodium iso-amyl ethyl barbiturate) 190 mg. per Kg. 

The MLD in the white rat for sodium amytal has been reported as being 
230 mg. per Kg. (117). A dosage of 190 mg. per Kg. was found after a 
preliminary investigation, to be the highest dose that could be used with 
only a few fatalities. A number died within the 72 minute period. No readings 
were taken after respiration ceased. The results obtained in 20 experiments 
are recorded in Table II. 

In every case there was an increased response followed by a progressive 
decrease. In 14 of 20 cases a maximal had been reached within 12 minutes 
after the injection. The maximal increase was 13.7 fb. The highest single 
increase was 69.2 °/o which was not reached until 30 minutes after the 
administration of the drug. ( No. 5 Table II ). 

In Fig. 3 a comparison of the normal mean (Table I) and the experimental 
mean (Table II) is presented graphically. It is apparent that there is a 
significant initial increase in response in the experimental legs but that the 
subsequent depression is not significantly different from the control. 

Gruber et al (80) attributed a stimulant action of barbiturates which 
they observed in smooth muscle to alkalinity of the drug. These experiments were 
done on excised muscle. It was, therefore, necessary to determine if the increased 
response observed by us was due to pH changes. Comparisons were made at the time 
of maximal stimulant action on response by means of a glass electrode

It will be noted that differences are not significant. The buffers of 
the blood can apparently compensate for the amount of sodium used- To further 
establish that pH and ionic factors are not involved in the increased response, 
a series of experiments was run in which sodium hydroxide solution was 
injected intraperitonneally. The dose of sodium hydroxide used contained 
a weight of sodium equivalent to the weight present in an experimental dose 
of sodium amytal. The pH of the sodium hydroxide solution was 10.8. This is 
higher than the pH of sodium amytal solution, which was 9.9. Table III presents 
the results obtained with seven such experiments. 

It is apparent from Fig. 4, where the mean of the normal legs is compared 
graphically to the mean of the legs treated with sodium hydroxide, that there 
is no significant difference. 

It is therefore believed that pH and ionic effects are not responsible 
for the stimulation. 

Denervation Experiments 

In an attempt to localize the stimulating action of the drug, a series 
of experiments with amytal on denervated muscles was carried out. Any alteration 
in response of the directly stimulated muscle upon the injection of the drug 
would be due to a direct action on the muscle. Since degeneration should be 
complete in 5 days (116) no response would be obtained from stimulation 
through the nerve (indirect stimulation). It was found that in some cases 
where nerve transmission appeared to be retained this was due to leakage from 
the shielded electrode to the muscle. 

Since a slow decrease in response was noted in the normal control leg

over the experimental time; and since denervated muscle is known to differ 
from normal muscle, it was thought that a decrease might occur over a period 
of time which would be somewhat greater than that of normal legs. A series of 
controls for denervated legs was therefore run. The results are tabulated in 
Table IV. It will be noted that by comparison with Table I that a somewhat 
greater decrease occurred than in normal muscle. 

Table V presents the results obtained when 190 mg. per Kg. of sodium 
amytal was injected into rats ith denervated legs. There is an increase of 
response that reaches a mean peak of 4.6 c jo in six minutes, followed by a decrease. 

■ Fig. 5 compares the contraction tension of the denervated experimental legs 
with those of the denervated control group. 

Although the increase with the denervated legs is less than with the 
normal legs this may be due to the more rapid fatigue of the denervated 
muscle • 

If calculation is based in each case, i.e. in normal and denervated 
legs, on the corresponding control curve it is found that they approximate 
more closely. There is a peak increase of 15.7 $ at 12 minutes with normal 
muscle as compared with 7.8 % at six minutes with denervated muscle (Table VI,Fig.6) 
(b). Sodium Amytal 350 mg. per Kg. 

By means of artificial respiration it was found possible to.increase 
the dosage level of amytal well beyond the lethal dose and still keep the 
animal alive. 

lifter preliminary experimentation a dose of 350 mg. per Kg. was 
accepted as being compatible with life. 

Table VII shows the results obtained with 10 experiments on normal 
legs at this dosage level. In all cases a marked decrease was obtained with 
recovery in all but one instance. Fig. 7 is a typical example of obese 
experiments. Fig. 8 is a graphical presentation of this data.

muscle. Fig. 9 compares the mean of Table VIII with that of the denervated 
control curve. 

It will be noted that there is a significant depression on normal 
and denervated muscle. 

hen calculation is based on the corresponding control curve and 
the results compared graphically, (Table IX and Fig. 10), it is apparent 
that there is little difference between the two curves. 

(c). hmytal with Curare 

Since the recovery obtained in the denervated experiments after a 
high dose of amytal was slight. It was thought that this might be due to 
the condition of the muscle. Curare can be used as a tool to produce 
essentially the same effect as denervation and should leave the muscle in 
better condition. 

Table X compiles the results obtained with a dose of 3 units per Kg 
of Intocostrin injected intraperitonneally. 

Table XI presents the results obtained in a series of experiments with 
-odium -Jiiytal 350 mg. per Kg.on curarized muscle ( 5 units per Kg. Intocostrin) 

Fig. 11 is a comparison of these figures with the curare control curve 

Here again recovery was insignificant and since some barbiturates are 
potentiated by curare (118,119) it was thought that a smaller dose of amytal 
might show interesting results. 

Table XII consists of ten experiments with amytal 190 mg* per Kg. with 
he same dose of curare as previously used. The curve is shown on Fig.11 and 
it is apparent that much greater recovery is obtained. It might be considered 
to be approximately 100 % recovery as the S.d.m f s overlap considerably.

Discussion 

The denervation experiments indicate that with a dose of 190 mg. per 
Kg. the transient stimulation of response is due to a direct action on the 
muscle. This concentration produced no increased response on curarized 
muscle which might seem to indicate some other site of action. . e have 
noticed and it has been reported by others (120), that curare, as well as 
preventing nerve transmission of the neuromuscular junction, has a 
depressant action on the muscle itself. It would seem therefore that a 
muscle depressed by curare is not capable of responding to the stimulating 
effect of amytal. It is further to be notea that curare and amytal have 
synergistic effects in depression of muscle. Whereas amytal alone,ISOmg. per Kg*, 
did not produce a significant depression of the muscle (see Fig. 3), this 
dose of amytal did produce a marked decrease of response of curarized muscle 
as compared to the curarized controls (Fig. 11). 

Amytal at a dose level of 350 m^ per Kg. did not produce an increased 
effect but, on the contrary, caused a rapid and marked decrease on both 
normal and denervated muscle. This depressant action would appear to be 
almost entirely on the muscle since the rate and extent of decrease of 
normal and denervated muscle approximate each other rather closely when 
comparison is made relative to their respective controls (Fig.10). There 
is, hoifever, a brief increase of resioonse of denervated muscle which is 
not seen in normal muscle. The maximum difference, relative to controls 
is 11.2 % at 3 minutes (Fig. 10). An explanation of this difference in the 
behavior of normal and denervated muscle may be that in normal muscle the 
neuromuscular junction is depressed almost immediately before any stimulant 
effect on the muscle can be demonstrated and that thereafter the depressant 
action on the muscle is so pronounced as to mask any neuromuscular junction 
depression. In the case of denervated muscle there is a brief period of 
stimulant action before the depressant action is developed. This is the

only indication that the neuromuscular junction may he involved in any stage 
in the depressant effect. 

Huston, kartin, and Hiile (89) reported a stimulant effect of 
pentobarbital and seconal on striated dog muscle, which preceded a depressant 
effect shown to be on the neuromuscular junction. They attributed the 
stimulant effect to a direct action on the muscle. The stimulant effect noted 
by us with amytal, 190 per Kg.,would therefore agree with the increased response 
they obtained with pentobarbital and seconal. The degree of increase noted 
by us is much less than that reported by Huston et al. This may be due to ' 
differences in concentration, animals and method of examination; but might 
also be due to a quantitative difference between amytal, pentobarbital and 
seconal. It is known that barbiturates differ quantitatively in their effects 
on the same part of the nervous system. Such differences of effect on the 
central nervous system are well known but also have been reported at peripheral 
points (73). Similar differences might exist in effect on muscle. 

j± stimulant action of barbiturates on smooth and cardiac muscle has 
not been reported. This may be due to a difference in response of different 
types of muscle or it may be that slight or transient effects have been 
overlooked. Gruber et al in experiments on excised smooth muscle noted a 
stimulating action with barbiturates but attributed this to the alkalinity 
of the solution since the effect was not apparent after control of the pH. 

That our results are not due to alkalinity has been demonstrated by the 
HaOH control experiments. 

Huston et al attributed the depressant action of pentobarbital 100 mg. % 
and seconal 100 mg. fo, in perfused blood, to an action on the neuromuscular 
junction. They reported a depressant action on the muscle itself at 
concentrations of 400 mg. % for pentobarbital and 200 mg’ p for seconal. 

Cartland and Koch (121) reported an average of 6.7 ec. blood volume 
per 100 Gm. body weight in the white rat. In order to compare the doses used 











- 49 


in our experiments with those used hy Huston et al we must consider all of 
the drug as being in the blood and at the same time. This would give a much 
higher blood concentration than would actually be the case, which may account 
for certain differences in results obtained by our methods as compared to 
those of Huston et al. A dose of 190 mg. per Kg, would give a blood concentration 
of 280 mg. fo; a dose of 350 mg,, per Kg. a concentration of over 500 mg. %. A 
concentration of 280 mg. % is higher than that used by Huston et al to show 
a depressant action on the neuromuscular junction; and a concentration of 
350 mg. % approaches the dose which showed a depressant action on muscle 
itself. 

Although Huston et al demonstrated a depression of the neuromuscular 
junction with pentobarbital and seconal, we were unable to show that the 
neuromuscular junction was significantly involved in the depression with 
amytal at the dose levels used. At 190 mg. per Kg. no significant decrease in 
response was noted; at 350 mg. per Kg. the decrease appeared to be due almost 
entirely to a direct effect on the muscle. ‘The difference in our results 
and those of Huston et al may be due to differences in : the concentrations 
of drugs, technique, animal species involved, or the actions of the barbiturates 
involved. 

The depressant effect that sodium pentothal has on the response of 
striated muscle to intra-arterial injection of acetylcholine (88) and the 
depressant effect that pentobarbital and seconal have on the neuromuscular 
junction (89), may be related to the decrease in response of the heart to 
vagus stimulation under the influence of high dosages of pentobarbital, amytal, 
and evipal (73) and to the depression of the motility of the gastrointestinal 
tract by barbiturates (82,83,84,122). There is however, considerable difference 
in the sensitivity of different parts of the nervous system to barbiturates (89). 

A slight decrease in muscle tone was noted after injection of amytal. 

As calculations are made from the resting or tone level this contributes to the

figures recorded. The decrease in tone was slightly more marked in the case 
of denervated muscle. A similar depression of the tone of smooth muscle by 
barbiturates has been noted. Gruber and his co-workers have reported a 
marked decrease in tonus of longitudinal muscle of the intestine (123) ; 
a decrease in tonus of stomach muscle (84); and a decrease in general 
tonus of intact intestine in the unanesthetized dog (82*83). 

It is interesting to note in the case of striated muscle that a 
decreased tone occurs at the same time as an increased degree of contraction 
to stimulus. That the two phenomena are not intimately linked is seen from the 
fact that the tonus level remains essentially the same after the brief period 
of stimulation is over. 

It would appear that at least part of the stimulant effect of amytal 
is attributable to a direct action on muscle. However, the increased response 
with denervated muscle was only about half that with normal muscle. This does 
not necessarily mean that only half the effect on normal muscle is due to a 
direct action. Denervation is known to cause profound changes in muscle 
(124,125) so that the lower response of denervated muscle may be due to the 
fact that the denervated muscle is less robust and therefore less able to 
respond to a stimulant. 

Denervation of muscle results in a sensitization to acetylcholine 
(125,126,127), which is believed by Cannon and Eosenblueth (128) to be one 
example of the general condition of the muscle. Sensitization to barbiturates 
has not been demonstrated. We believe our experiments to be free from the 
effect of sensitization for the reasons previously stated (89). In addition 
a dose of 190 mg.per Kg.shows less stimulant effect on denervated muscle than 
on normal muscle which would seem to indicate no sensitizati n; at a dose of 
350 mgf. per Kg.the stimulant action on denervated muscle might be conceivably 
due to sensitization. Our experiments with amytal (190mg.per Kg) would 
therefore lend support to the contention that sensitization was not of

significance in the experiments with pentobarbital and seconal (89). 

(d). Sodium Kemithal (Sodium salt of 5-A-cyclohexenyl-5-allyl-2-thiobarbiturie 

acid) 

Since amytal is a moderately long acting barbiturate it was thought 
to be of interest to investigate a short acting barbiturate. Kemithal having 
recently been shown to be of value as an ultra-short anesthetic was selected 
for comparison with amytal. 

A series of experiments was undertaken first on normal legs with a 
dosage of 325 mg,per Kg.of Kemithal (Table XIII). Only four of the experiments 
show any increase of response so that Kemithal at this concentration does 
not show the stimulant effect which is noted with amytal at 190 mg*per Kg. 

When the experimental results are compared to the control figures (Fig.12) it 
is seen that there is a steady but slow depression of response but with 
rather wide experimental variation . Experiments with denervated legs 
(Table XIV and Fig. 13) show a similar pattern of events as that of the normal 
legs. There is however, slightly more evidence of a preliminary stimulant 
action which was also the case with amytal 350 mg.per Kg. When comparison is 
made of the effects on normal and denervated legs, relative to their respective 
controls (Table XV,Fig. 14) it is seen that the two lines approximate each 
other fairly closely. 

There is considerable variation from rat to rat in this series as 
evidenced by the rather large S.d.m's, It would appear, however, that at 72 
minutes there has been a significant depression of response which is due 
mainly to a direct action on the muscle. 

2. Tridione (3,5,5 - Trimethyloxaz6M&ine.?2y44Dis©he) 

ns tridione is a potent anticonvulsant drug it was thought to be of 
interest to compare its peripheral action with that of the barbiturates. 

Since the acute toxicity of tridione is remarkably low it was possible 
to give relatively -enormous doses without early fatality. The animals were 
deeply depressed and died after a period of several hours. Tridione is only

sufficiently soluble to prepare a 5 °/o solution in water. As the dose of 
3500 mgu per Kg. would require a very large amount of solution to be injected 

the solid drug was warmed until melted and injected as a liquid. The melting 

o 

point is about 45 C. 

The results obtained with normal legs are recorded in Table XVI and 
Fig. 15 and with aenervated legs in'Table XVII and Fig. 16. It is apparent 
that there is a rapid and marked depression of response in both cases. .hen 
comparison is made relative to the respective controls (Table XVIII, Fig. 17) 
the two lines are very close. It would appear therefore that tridione 
3500 mg. per Kg. produces a depression of response due to a direct action on 
the muscle. 

3. Sodium Diphenyl-hydantoinate 

Another anticonvulsant drug of value in the treatment of seizure 
diseases is Dilantin. It is not a hypnotic drug and therefore differs in this 
respect from the barbiturates. 

It was found that at a dose of 250 mgi per Eg. the effect on normal 
legs was variable. In Table XIX the results of ten experiments show in some 
cases an initial increase and in some others a slow decrease. At this dosage 
which was as high as could be used without death of the.animal, there is no 
significant effect on the gastrocnemius muscle.

SUMMARY AND -CONCLUSIONS 






66 


1. Sodium amytal, 190 mg, per Kg., injected intraperitonneally into rats 
caused a transient increase in response of normal and denervated striated 
muscle to electrical stimulus. This increased response is believed due, 
at least in part, to a direct action on muscle. 

2. That this increased response is not due to changes in pH nor to changes 
in ionic balance has been shown by pH tests on rat blood and by 
intraperitonneal administration of sodium hydroxide, 

3. Sodium amytal, 350 mg, per Kg., caused a rapid and marked decrease on 
both normal and denervated muscle, which would appear to be almost 
entirely due to a direct action on the muscle. 

4. A brief preliminary stimulant action was noted at this dosage on den¬ 
ervated muscle which .as not apparent on normal muscle. This might be 
an indication that the neuromuscular junction is depressed in normal 
muscle and no stimulant effect on the muscle itself is therefore 
noted. 

5. Sodium amytal, ISO mg. per Kg., did not cause any increased response 
of curarized muscle, but, on the contrary produced a depression. 

6. a comparison of the effects of amytal, 190 mg. per Kg., on normal and 
denervated muscle to the effects of amytal, 190 mg. per Kg., on curarized 
muscle indicates a synergistic depressant effect on muscle by amytal and 
curare. 

7. Sodium kemithal, 325 mg. per Kg., on normal and denervated striated 
muscle caused a depression of response which is due mainly to a 
direct action on muscle. 

8. Tridione, 3500 mg. per Kg., caused a rapid and marked depression of 
response in both normal and denervated legs, which would appear to be 
due to a direct action on the muscle. 

9. Sodium diphenyl-hydantoinate, 250 mg. per Kg., produced no significant 


effect on the gastrocnemius muscle.
