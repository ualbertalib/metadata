THE SULPHUR-CONTAINING AMINO ACIDS 


OF WHEAT PROTEINS 


Robert Hasting 


INTRODUCTION 


Wheat flours with similar protein content often produce 
bread loaves of different sizes because of differences in their 
protein quality# Rigby (3I4.) has attributed differences in 
quality in a single wheat variety to the total sulphur or 
sulphur-containing amino acids present in the protein# He 
showed that, whereas the quantity of crude protein would not 
account for loaf volume differences, the total sulphur content 
of wheat, flour and gluten was significantly correlated with 
loaf size* Further, he showed that the cystine content of the 
gluten is highly correlated with the sulphur content of the wheat 
and therefore the cystine in the gluten was believed to contrib¬ 
ute to baking strength* 

In a further study of the sulphur and wheat quality 
relationship, Gerbrandt (19), using five varieties of wheat 
grown on different soil types, showed that the percentage of 
sulphur in the whole wheat was a better measure of baking

strength than was percentage crude protein# In addition his 
work showed that cystine and especially methionine content of 
the crude gluten accounted for more of the variability in loaf 
volume than did sulphur in wheat# 

In these two studies, analysis for sulphur-containing 
amino acids was carried out only on the crude gluten washed 
from flour# It was thought that accurate methods for the deter¬ 
mination of cystine and methionine in whole wheat and flour 
would provide a new means of attack, which would be of value in 
studies of the role of sulphur in flour quality# A direct method 
for cystine and an indirect method for methionine were found to 
be applicable to the determination of these amino acids in flour 
and wheat# 

Wheat was grown on the Breton gray soils and was fer¬ 
tilized similarly to that used by Rigby (jij.)# This material 
was available for further studies on the relationship between 
sulphur and loaf volume# Because of an early frost, the I9I4.6 
wheat graded poorly and produced very poor bread which did not 
show the expected variations in loaf size. It was therefore 
thought that investigations relating primarily to baking strength 
would be of little value# Nevertheless, as this material had a 
wide range in sulphur content it was admirably suited for 
investigations of nitrogen, sulphur, cystine and methionine 
relationships# A study of these relationships is the primary 
concern of this thesis#

The data for loaf size of the samples investigated 
were available* The loaf volumes for the I9I4.7 material varied 
considerably. This provided an opportunity to compare loaf 
volume relationships with the results of other work from this 
laboratory. 

As Rigby and Gerbrandt have shown that the sulphur-con¬ 
taining amino acids appear to affect wheat flour quality, a 
study of factors affecting the cystine and methionine content 
of wheat and flour might provide further information on the 
whole problem. 

There is very little information in the literature as 
to the effects of various fertilizer treatments on the ultimate 
amino acid content of cereal grains. This knowledge would be 
of importance in protein nutrition, where quality ae well as 
quantity of proteins is recognized as being important. Some of 
the material used in this study provides such information with 
respect to the sulphur^containing amino acids in wheat. 


LITERATURE REVIEW 


Harrow (25) lists four sulphur-containing amino acids, 
namely methionine, cystine, lanthionine and dienkolic acid. He 
mentions the compounds cysteine and ergothioneine; the former 
is classified as a reduced form of cystine of importance in

biological reactions, the latter as a derivative of histidine* 

Glutathione, a polypeptide of glutamic acid, glycine 
and cysteine, is of importance in a consideration of sulphur- 
containing amino acids because of the sulphur present in the 
sulphydryl group• 

In the literature reviewed, no reference reported the 
presence of lanthionine, djenkolie acid or ergothioneine in 
wheat or wheat products* The sulphur-containing compounds which 
have been reported in wheat are the amino acids cystine and 
methionine, the vitamins thiamine and biotin and the compounds 
cysteine and glutathione. The sulphur'.In the latter two is 
usually determined and reported as cystine-sulphur. 

Greaves and Bracken (2j) found that the thirty-six 
wheats investigated by them did not contain sulphur in the 
sulphate form. Woodman and Evans (I4.0), however, report samples 
of bran and middlings with sulphate sulphur contents of 0.00[{_$ 
and 0.01$ respectively. 

Numerous studies have been made on the thiamine content 
of wheat (5). The paper of Johannson and Rich (27) gives a 
general indication of the thiamine content of wheat. These 
authors found that the amount of thiamine in wheat from the 
three prairie provinces in 19^0 ranged from 2.2 to 8o0yU g per 
gram with a mean of 3*93 /*g* 

Bailey (5) reports the biotin content of two samples of 
wheat as 22 millimicrograms and II3 millimicrograms per gram*

It is obvious that this organic sulphur-containing compound is 
present in wheat in very small amounts* 

There are numerous papers which report values for the 
sulphur-containing amino acids in wheat and wheat products but 
most of the values reported are on isolated samples of wheat, 
flour or gluten* 

A systematic study of the cystine content of different 
varieties of wheat and a single variety grown under various 
cultural conditions is reported by Gubler and Greaves ( 21 ).*. 

Using a colorimetric method for the cystine determination they 
found that the cystine-sulphur constituted about one-half the 
total sulphur of wheat. They observed that in general, variations 
in sulphur content are accompanied by corresponding variations 
in cystine content. In addition nitrogen content was highly 
correlated with percentage cystine. The correlation coefficients 
reported for sulphur and cystine and nitrogen and cystine are 
0*83 and O.75 respectively. 

Gubler and Greaves also observed that, in general, as 
the total sulphur and cystine content increased there was a 
decrease in the percentage of total sulphur represented by 
cystine. This was also observed by Wood (38) in a study of leaf 
proteins. These observations may be attributed to incomplete 
estimation of cystine at the higher levels of cystine content. 

Csonka (13) determined the cystine contents of various 
salt extractions of Marquis, Tenmarq and Pulhio wheats. He found

the total cystine contents to be 0*27$, 0*17$ and 0 *l 6 $ 
respectively# Although he does not report the percentage sulphur, 
the nitrogen values are 3#31$, 2#58$ and 2#31$ in the order of 
the varieties* Csonka concluded that the amino acid content is 
different in the different varieties of wheat studied* 

Rigby (3J4.) in a study of the effect of sulphur on the 
quality of wheat grown on sulphur deficient soils found that 
cystine is the principal form of sulphur in gluten* In the 
samples examined he found the percentage of cystine varied from 
56% to 89$ of the total sulphur* The mean value was 76$ • The 
protein content of this material was not an adequate indicator 
of the baking strength* The sulphur content of the wheat, 
however, was positively and significantly correlated with loaf 
volume# The gluten contained most of the sulphur in the wheat 
and larger amounts of sulphur were present in glutens from 
strong flours# The cystine content of the gluten was related 
to loaf volume, sulphur in gluten and sulphur in wheat. From 
Rigby’s data there does not appear to be a decrease in the amount 
of sulphur represented as cystine when the cystine content 
increases* 

Rigby found that the sulphur content of the flour follows 
closely that of the whole wheat but the level is slightly higher# 
This was taken as evidence that sulphur is more concentrated in 
the endosperm of the kernel than in the whole wheat*

Gerbrandt (19)* in a study of the distribution of sul¬ 
phur in wheat, reported that although samples of Marquis wheat 
were significantly higher in sulphur than were samples of Thatcher, 
there was very little difference in the gluten cystine values* 

The methionine contents of the glutens were, however, constantly 
and significantly lower in Thatcher than in Marquis* 

In this study the simple correlation coefficients reported 
for cystine or methionine in gluten with loaf volume, protein 
in wheat and sulphur In wheat are highly significant* 

Using direct methods for both the cystine and methionine 
determinations C-erbrandt found the sulphur of these amino acids 
accounted for 101 * 1 $ of the total sulphur of gluten from Marquis 
wheat grown at six stations* The distribution of sulphur in 
gluten was also determined for Marquis and Thatcher grown at 
two stations* The total cystine and methionine sulphur represented 
a mean recovery of 97 $ of the total gluten sulphur* The gluten 
sulphur represented a mean of 70*5$ of that found in the flour 
and 62*2$ of that in the whole wheat® 

In the second of his papers on amino acids in staple 
foods, Csonka (llf) states that although the protein content 
of patent flour is lower than that of the whole wheat flour, 
there is a larger percentage of cystine in the flour. A direct 
determination on a sample of whole wheat flour gave a value of 
0 * 17 $ cystine* The values for the flour, bran and shorts of 
this wheat are respectively 0*17$, 0*01$ and 0*02$®

D* Breese-Jones (10) reports little difference in the 
cystine content of whole wheat and a patent flour milled from 
the wheat* This worker reports a methionine content of 0*1^8$ 
for a sample of flour milled from wheat containing 0*10$ methio¬ 
nine* Obviously the results as reported are incorrect or the 
method used for the methionine determination is not consistent* 

The total methionine according to these results has actually 
increased in the flour* This is hardly possible* 

Harrison, Thomas and Hill (2ijJ traced the movement of 
sulphur in the wheat kernel by the use of radioactive sulphur* 
Radiographs of the grain showed the greatest concentration of 
sulphur was in the embryo* There appeared to be a fairly uniform 
concentration of sulphur in the starchy endosperm; but at the 
periphery of the endosperm there was a much higher concentra¬ 
tion* This is especially so in the aleurone layer and the cells 
immediately underneath* The aleurone cells contain a large 
part of the protein of the bran* They are mostly removed as 
part of the bran in the milling process* 

Barton-Wright (6) made a study of the distribution of 
amino acids in the wheat grain* Using a microbiological technique 
he found that, apart from the germ, the highest concentrations 
of 11 amino acids including cystine and methionine occur in the 
outer part of the grain* 

Block and Bolling (8) report cystine contents for five 
whole wheats* The values range from 0 o l6$ to 0*29^* Three

flour samples are reported with cystine contents of 0 . 31 %, 

0 . 26 % and 0.27%. Block and Bolling also report on cystine 
values obtained by other workers for germ, bran and shorts* 

Padva ( 32 ) in a study of the amino acid content of gluten 
reports a value of l.\\7/% cystine* 

Workers reporting methionine results on isolated samples 
of wheat are Reisen, Schweigert and Elvehjem ( 35 ) and Chitre 
and Keni (12)* The first group of workers used a microbiological 
method, the second group used a colorimetric technique. 

Grau and Almquist (22) compared a colorimetric and a 
biological method for the determination of methionine in wheat, 
wheat protein and wheat bran. They found a close correlation 
between the two methods* 

Wood ( 38 ) states that the only sulphur-containing com¬ 
ponents of the protein molecule are the amino acids cystine and 
methionine. Further, Wood says these acids may occur in a free 
state in plant tissues with cysteine and glutathione. The latter 
two compounds are derived from free cystine and methionine or 
from the protein molecule. 

Cysteine and glutathione are important because of their 
active sulphydryl groups* 

Sullivan, Howe and Schmalz (37) have shown that glutathione 
is concentrated in the wheat germ and that patent flour contains 
only traces if any of this compound* 

Myers and Working (31) state that sulphydryl groups are 
present in proteins in a free or reactive form and/or a bound

or non-reactive form* The reactive groups cause the protein 
when in the native form to give a positive nitroprusside test* 

The non-reactive form will only give a positive reaction with 
the nitroprusside reagent if the protein is first denatured to 
liberate the sulphydryl group* Meyers and Working tested gluten 
for the foregoing groups and concluded that neither free nor 
bound sulphydryl groups were present* The water-soluble proteins 
from wheat flour were found to contain non-reactive sulphydryl 
groups which are made reactive on denaturation* 

An interesting paper by Blumenthal and Clarke ( 9 ) 
reports that in some proteins sulphur may exist in forms other 
than cystine, cysteine and methionine* These authors suggest 
that at least two other sulphur-bearing constituents are present, 
one of which could be the compound ergothioneine* 

Baernstein (2) working with thirty-two different proteins 
estimated total sulphur and the sulphydryl, disulphide and 
methionine fractions* He reports that the three fractions 
accounted for roughly 101 * 5 $ of the total sulphur but values 
varied from 85 * 9 $ to 117 * 8 $* 

Bailey (i|.) states that of the known sulphur-containing 
araino acids, only cystine and methionine have been isolated from 
protein hydrolysates* Bailey compared specific methods for 
cystine and cysteine with methods for cystine which included 
any additional -S-S-groups which may be present in the protein 
molecule* He found a disparity between the two estimations* 
Although the author suggests that there may be losses of cystine

due to decarboxylation or deamination of a portion of the 
cystine during hydrolysis, or inhibition of color used in the 
colorimetric determination of substances present in the protein 
hydrolysate, he does not preclude the possibility of the presence 
of sulphur-containing amino acids other than cystine and methio¬ 
nine* 

In a later paper Baernstein (j)> using newer methods, 
determined the cystine and methionine in eleven proteins* He 
obtained an average recovery of 9^*9$ of the total sulphur as 
the aforementioned amino acids and H2S* The latter compound 
was attributed to the presence of inorganic sulphate* 

Biumenthai and Clarke (9) found that cystine can be 
completely oxidized to sulphate by boiling with fuming nitric 
acid, but synthetic methionine yields only small amounts of 
sulphate. Using solutions of cystine or methionine separately 
and together with gelatin, these authors report a very high 
recovery of cystine-sulphur as sulphate. 

Mazur (30) applied this method for cystine to a highly 
purified Limulus hemocyanin. He found that the nitric-acid- 
oxidizable sulphur gave values which compared with those obtained 
using two classical colorimetric methods* 

Lugg (29) in 1938 used the oxidizing method for the 
determination of cystine in a study of the sulphur distribution 
of protein preparations from leaves of different grass species* 
Lugg, assuming that the only sulphur-containing amino acids in

protein are cystine and/or cysteine and methionine, used the 
following relationship: 

cystine S* + cysteine S* + methionine S* + other S* = total S* 

As "other S*" was believed to be present entirely as 
sulphate it should appear as inorganic SOj^ on acid hydrolysis* 

Lugg compared a specific colorimetric procedure and 
Baernstein^ HI digestion method for cystine with his so-called 
"differential-oxidation procedure*" He concluded that the 
latter method, although less specific than the other quantitative 
methods, appears to yield more appropriate results* He warns, 
however, that to accept these results is to accept the assump¬ 
tion that the sum of the fractions thus estimated necessarily 
equal3 the total sulphur* 

Using a principle similar to that of Lugg, Callan and 
Toermies ( 11 ) found that alkaline-permanganate solution oxidized 
cystine-sulphur but not methionine-sulphur to sulphate* These 
authors applied this method to the estimation of cystine in 
egg albumin* 

Block and Bolling ( 8 ) reviewed the methods for cystine 
determinations up to 19^5• They suggest that the "differential- 
oxidation procedure" appears to have special value when estimations 
of cystine are to be made on protein preparations heavily con¬ 
taminated with carbohydrate* 

Evans ( 17 ) in 19 J +5 made a further study of the "differ¬ 
ential-oxidation procedure*" He oxidized mixtures of pure cystine

and/or methionine, with dextrose, soybean oil meal and fish 
meal* Almost all of the cystine-sulphur but very little of the 
methionine-sulphur was recovered as sulphate* Evans 1 data 
suggest that considerable organic matter must be present to 
completely oxidize cystine to sulphate* 

The values determined for methionine by the "differential 
oxidation procedure” and a colorimetric method on samples of 
soybean oil meal and fish meal compare favorably* A comparison 
of the "differential-oxidation procedure” with other methods 
showed the cystine and methionine values reported for the former 
method are respectively higher and lower* The differences could 
be accounted for by losses of cystine upon acid hydrolysis where 
this step is taken or a difference in the composition of the 
materials studied. 

Evans ( 18 ) and coworkers in a later study applied the 
”differential-oxidation procedure* 1 to the determination of 
cystine and methionine in dry peas* This paper is of interest 
because of the application of this method and because a study 
was made of the influence of fertilizers and cultural practices 
on the cystine, methionine and protein contents of dry peas. 

Evans at al. report that the addition of sulphur-contain¬ 
ing fertilizers to the soil increased the percentage of total 
sulphur but decreased the protein content of the peas* The 
protein of peas fertilized with ammonium sulphate or gypsum 
contained significantly more sulphur than did the protein of

peas fertilized with sodium nitrate* The authors conclude 
that cystine values are influenced in the same direction as the 
sulphur but the methionine values were not significantly different* 
Evans and coworkers found very small differences in 

the effect of maturity, climatic conditions and variety on the 
cystine and methionine contents of peas* 

Greaves and Bracken (23) studied the relationship of 
sulphur to nitrogen in a group of spring and winter wheats* 

They found that the nitrogen and sulphur contents of twenty-one 
wheat varieties were closely associated* A correlation coefficient 
of 0*81 was reported* 

Greaves and Bracken also studied the sulphur-content 
of Kanred wheat under varying cultural conditions* The data 
presented show that ploughing under of legumes will result in 
slight increases in the nitrogen content of wheat grown on 
such land* The sulphur content did not vary consistently* 

Gubler and Greaves ( 21 ), investigating the same material 
as Greaves and Bracken, report that variations in cultural treat¬ 
ments cause at least small variations in cystine content* 

Smith and Wang (56) made a study of the effects of 
environmental factors on the cystine and methionine contents 
of the vegetative parts of four species of grasses* They con¬ 
clude that the effects of manuring are irregular and are 
relatively unimportant* Lime did not alter the cystine or 
methionine to a significant extent* Ammonium sulphate added to

rye-grass late in the growing stag© effected small reductions 
in the cystine and methionine content* 

Wood and Barrien (59) state in a study of the sulphur 
metabolism of plants, that the sulphate ion constitutes the 
sole source of sulphur to plants and the sulphur-containing 
proteins are the synthetic end-products in the sulphur metabolism* 
These workers obtained the following results with Sudan grass* 

The application of increased amounts of potassium sulphate in 
solution to plants did not affect the quantity of cystine-sulphur 
isolated* Inorganic sulphate - sulphur in the leaves was 
increased with increasing amounts of sulphate fertilizer* The 
ratio of protein-nitrogen to protein-sulphur remained approx¬ 
imately the same* Increases in ammonia-nitrogen increased the 
contents of cystine and protein sulphur as well as amino-nitrogen 
and protein-nitrogen, but decreased the sulphate-sulphur content* 
These workers suggest that ammonia acts as a limiting factor in 
the formation of protein sulphur from sulphate* 

Barrien and Wood (7) working with leaves at different 
stages during the life cycle of the plant show that the ratio 
of protein-nitrogen to protein-sulphur is higher, the greater 
the nitrogen treatment* If the initial amount of sulphate 
supplied to the plants remained unchanged, increased nitrogen 
treatments were found to increase protein-sulphur* 

Peters (55) worked with a number of crop plants includ¬ 
ing wheat grown on the fertilized plots of the Breton gray soils 
and Edmonton black soils. He found that at the Breton station, where

the natural soil sulphur is low, the percentage sulphur of 
grains and legumes from plots treated with sulphur-containing 
fertilizers was greater than that of crops from the non-sulphur 
fertilized plots# Wheat from the Edmonton station did not 
show an increase in sulphur on the application of a sulphur- 
containing fertilizer# This was taken as evidence that sulphur 
is not limiting at Edmonton#

Fallis, Warburg, Sundre and at Edmonton on fallow and stubble# 

A composite sample of Marquis from the Rust Research Laboratory, 
Winnipeg, was also used# These samples were from the same lots 
of flour as was the material used by Gerbrandt (19)#

sufficient wheat was made available for milling, baking and 
other analysis* A complete detailed history of the Breton 
experiment can be obtained from papers by Wyatt, Newton and 
Ignatieff (l+l), Peters (33), and Kenwood ( 28 ). 

The wheat for the analysis reported in this paper was 
harvested from the following fields. 

Series E, I9I4.6 - Part of this field, plots 1 to 11 , has been 
continuously cropped with wheat since 1929, except 
for two years when the field was fallowed and one 
year when barley was grown. The rest of the field, 
plots 13 to 26, has been cropped continuously with 
wheat since 1939* 

Series B, I9I4.6 - The wheat was grown after clovers which had 

occupied the land for two years in a five year rotation. 
Series C, I9I4.7 “ This field was the wheat after clover crop 
for I9I1.7. 

Each of the foregoing series consists of twenty-six 
plots which are variously fertilized. The total amounts of 
fertilizers applied to all plots for each series are listed in 
Table I, page 19 # of Kenwood's paper ( 28 )o During the summer 
of 19^7* no fertilizers were added to the plots. 

Wheat from twenty-one of the twenty-six plots in each 
of the above three series was used for the determinations re¬ 
ported in this thesis. In addition the wheat was milled into 
flour and further determinations were carried out. All of the

samples from plots one to eleven were used, the checks 1, 5 and 
11 being bulked to give a representative check sample* Ten 
samples from plots 13 to 26 were selected because of the relative 
amounts of nitrogen and sulphur fertilizers used* The samples 
were 13, and 18 to 26 inclusive* The check plots 13 and 18 were 
bulked to give a single check sample representative of a part 
of the field. Samples 22 and 26 were bulked for the same reason.

numbers used throughout this paper, the fertilizers used on 
each plot and the grades of the harvested samples*

Series III - Water Culture Solutions 

The general procedure used for growing plants in culture 
solutions is given by Hoagland ( 26 )* The method for growing 
wheat was modified somewhat* Following is a brief description 
of the procedure, equipment and solutions used in the experiments 
with wheat* 

Four tanks were used in each experiment* The larger 
tanks, each with a capacity of 225 liters of solution and with 
openings for 125 corks, were used in experiments I and XI* In 
experiments III and IV, each tank held 61j. corks and had a 
capacity of 110 liters of solution* Each cork contained two 
or three holes in which the wheat plants were placed* 

The wheat used throughout all the experiments was the 
variety Ked Bobs* The seed was germinated and grown on a germin¬ 
ating screen* When the plants reached a height of 1 1/2 to 5 
inches they were placed in the corks so that the roots were 
immersed In nutrient solution* 

The nutrient solutions used in the experiments were based 
on Hoagland f s solution (26) but modifications were made to suit 
each experiment* All the chemicals excepting the iron tartrate, 
calcium di-hydrogen phosphate and the A-Z solution were made up 
as one-molar stock solutions* The concentrations of the stock 
solutions of iron tartrate and calcium di-hydrogen phosphate were 
0*5$ and 0*05 M respectively* The A-Z solution was made up as 
suggested by Hoagland*

As the plants in this experiment were transplanted in 
September, they did not mature until the latter part of December. 
Prom approximately October 22 to the time of harvest, it was 
necessary to supplement daylight with artificial illumination. 

Experiment II - Experiment I was carried out in the greenhouse. 
Considerable trouble was experienced from mildew, fungus-gnats, 
and other pathogenic conditions. Because of the greenhouse 
hazards it was decided to repeat the experiment with the tanks 
out-of-doors. The plants were grown during the summer months 
from May 5 to September 15. 

Experiment III - Solutions were made up in four tanks to supply 
the following four conditions; 

Tank 1 - low sulphur, low nitrogen. 

Tank 2 - high sulphur, low nitrogen. 

Tank 3 - low sulphur, high nitrogen. 

Tank lj. - high sulphur, high nitrogen. 

The volumes of stock solutions for each tank are given

-25- 


Experiment IV - Experiment III was repeated in the greenhouse 
from August 5 to December 5, 19 ^- 7 * Tanks 3 and Ij. were dis¬ 
carded because of very poor growth* 

Two months after transplanting, when about one-quarter 
of the wheat was in head, sulphur was completely eliminated 
from Tank 2 * 

Artificial light was used to supplement daylight from 
the last week in October until harvest* 

The plants became badly infested with mildew and were 
therefore treated with sulphur fumes on September 2 lj.* Twice 
during the growing season nicotine sulphate was sprayed In the 
greenhouse to destroy aphids* 


METHODS 


Statistical Analysis 

The statistical methods described by Goulden ( 20 ) are 
used throughout this study* 

Gluten Washing- 

Pour percent mono-phosphate adjusted to pH 6*8 by the 
addition of sodium di-phosphate, as suggested by Dill and 
Alsburg (15)* was used as a stock solution* The actual washing 
solution consisted of the stock solution diluted with unboiled 
distilled water to a 0 * 1 $ concentration* Thirty-gram samples

of flour were washed for 12 minutes with a stream of solution 
delivered at approximately 100 ml* per minute* 

As much water as possible was squeezed from the samples 
by hand, before wet weights of gluten were recorded* Weights 
of the dry gluten were obtained after drying in vacuo at 98°C* 
for approximately 2I4. hours* 

Baking 

Flour samples of 100 grams were baked using the 
malt-phosphate-brornate formula, with 0*3^ diastatic malt, 

0*1$ ammonium phosphate, and 0*001^ potassium bromate. Single 
bakes were carried out on each Breton sample because of the small 
quantity of flour* 

Nitrogen 

Nitrogen was determined by the Kjeldahl-Gunning-ArnoId 
method, with mercuric oxide as a catalyst* The results are 
reported as percentage of the dry matter* 

Sulphur 

The A*0 *A*C* method (1), using nickel crucibles, open 
fusion with sodium-carbonate and sodium-peroxide as modified by 
Rigby (3I4-) was used for sulphur determinations* 

Cystine and Methionine 

It was desirable to find a method for cystine and methionine 
that could be applied to materials containing large amounts of 
carbohydrate and other non-protein materials* The differential-

oxidation procedure, as used by Evans ( 17 ) on soybean meal, was 
found to be satisfactory for wheat and wheat products# 

Preparation of the sample 

The whole wheat was ground to a fine meal in a Wiley 
mill# The dried gluten samples were ground in a burr mill© 

The samples of wheat, flour and gluten were oven dried 
for 1 hour at 13Q°C* Duplicate samples of about I4. grams of wheat 
and flour or Q#5 grams of gluten were accurately weighedo 

Determination and Calculation of Cystine 

The samples were boiled with concentrated nitric acid in 
a hydrolyzing flask under a reflux condenser for 12 to 16 hours# 
Fifteen millilitres of concentrated nitric acid (specific gravity 
lo6l) were added for ©very one gram of material# After oxidation 
the clear, yellow hydrolyzate was transferred to a 600 ml# beaker, 
and one-half a gram of KNO^ was added# The solution was evapor¬ 
ated to dryness on a steam-bath# To eliminate any nitrates, which 
would interfere with the subsequent sulphate determination, two 
10 cc* portions of concentrated HOI were added and evaporated# 

The dry residue was dissolved in approximately 5OO ml# 
of distilled water and 1 ml# of concentrated HC 1 * The solution 
was boiled and filtered into a 600 ml# wide-mouthed erlenmeyer 
flask# The remaining procedure is identical with the determina¬ 
tion of sulphates in any solution# 

The calculation of cystine percent is as follows:

Galculation of Methionine 

Assuming that eystine-sulphur and methienine-sulphur 
make up the total sulphur of the wheat, flour or gluten, we can 
calculate the methionine content as* 

Methionine-sulphur = Total sulphur minus cystine-suj.ph.ur. 

The foregoing procedure for the determination of cystine 
and methionine in wheat, flour or gluten is based on two assumptions 

( 1 ) Cystine end methionine are the only sulphur compounds present 
in significant quantities in wheat and wheat products# 

(Cysteine and glutathione sulphur are considered as part of 
the cystine-sulphur fraction#) 

( 2 ) Cystine-sulphur is oxidized to the sulphate form# The 
methionine-sulphur is not oxidized to sulphate-sulphur# 

With reference to the first assumption, a review of the 
literature showed that, besides the sulphur-containing amino 
acids, thiamine and biotin are the only organic sulphur compounds 
whose presence has been reported in wheat# These substances are 
present in such small amounts that the sulphur contributed by 
them would not affect the significance of the results reported 
in this thesis# 

Allowances must be made for sulphate-sulphur if it is 
present in the wheat# It is generally known that if sulphate- 
sulphur is present in the wheat kernel it is in very small amounts# 
In all the literature reviewed there were no reports of sulphate- 
sulphur in wheat# Woodman and Evans (I4.O), however, reported

small amounts of this sulphur form in bran and middlings* Th© 
method of Woodman and Evans for sulphate-sulphur was applied to 
some samples of the wheat and flour used in this study* As no 
sulphate-sulphur was detected in the samples surveyed, no further 
attempts were made to determine this sulphur-frac11 on# 

Gerbrandt (19) used methods completely different from 
those reported in this paper® He accounted for all of the sulphur 
as cystine and methionine in a number of samples of crude gluten® 
The assumption that cystine-sulphur is oxidized to 
sulphate-sulphur and methionine is not, was validated by Evans 
(17) and Blumenthal and Clarke (9K Evans carried out recovery 
experiments of pure cystine and methionine from soybean and fish 
meals# Blumenthal and Clark© did similar experiments with gelatin# 
To test the ”differential-oxidation procedure” further, 
determinations were made on samples of flour and samples of flour 
to which cystine or methionine had been added# 

In the recovery experiments reported in Table V, different 
amounts of cystine were added to a commercial flour with a known 
cystine content# The flour and cystine mixture was oxidized for 
approximately 15 hours with 7 ml* of nitric acid per gram of 
flour# As shown by results presented later better oxidation and 
purer precipitates of barium sulphate can be obtained with larger 
amounts of nitric acid# The regular cystine determination was 
carried out and the results are reported in Table V#

The results presented in Table V show that cystine- 
sulphur is quantitatively oxidized to sulphate-sulphur* Except 
for the one-gram sample, the actual recoveries of cystine added 
to flour are within 6% of complete recovery* The results for the 
one-gram sample are low* Evans showed that in recovery experi¬ 
ments of this type considerable organic matter must be present 
to get a complete oxidation of cystine-sulphur to sulphate-sulphur* 
The one gram sample confirms this observation*

To test whether methionine-sulphur is oxidized to 
sulphates, different amounts of methionine and flour were treated 
with nitric acid* The procedure for this experiment was the 
same as for the experiment with cystine* The results are reported

In most of the experiments the cystine recovered is within 6 % 
of the actual amount present* Where the actual recovery is not 
within 6 % of the theoretical, the values are generally lower* 

If the methionine-sulphur was oxidized the recovery would be 
much more than indicated in the table* 

The results reported in Table VI suggest that the 
cystine of the flour is not completely oxidized* The nitric 
acid t flour ratio is very much smaller than that used by other 
workers and might account for the incomplete oxidation of cystine* 

Because the oxidation of cystine apparently was not 
completed In some of the foregoing cases, experiments were 
carried out to find the best conditions for complete oxidation* 

The results of different oxidation times and different nitric 
acid : flour ratios on the oxidation of flour cystine were 
studied* 

Table VII shows the effect of different amounts of 
nitric acid on the oxidation of flour cystine* Five-gram flour 
samples were oxidized for approximately 15 hours with different 
volumes of nitric acid*

At ratios higher than 1:7 results are reported as 
averages of duplicate determinations that check within 5$, 

With flour2acid ratios below 1:8 there was considerable varia¬ 
tion between duplicates and as a result more than two determina¬ 
tions had to be mad© at these ratios. 

Generally, the results show that increases in nitric 
acid volume to 8 ml, per gram of flour bring about increases in 
the sulphate-sulphur recovered. At the lower acid concentrations

the barium sulphate precipitate varies in color from black to 
a dirty white. This indicates that at these concentrations the 
oxidation is not complete and there may be considerable occlu¬ 
sion of impurities. Above the 1:8 ratio the precipitate is 
white• 

It was desirable to observe the effect of still higher 
concentrations of acid on the amount of sulphate-sulphur re¬ 
covered. 

Oxidations were carried out on a new standard flour 
with flour : acid ratios ranging from 1:7 to !*!?• The results 
are reported in Table VIII as averages of duplicates which 
check within 5 $. The oxidation time was approximately 15 hours.

In view of the foregoing, determinations of cystine for 
this paper were carried out with flour t acid ratios of 1:15* 
Exceptions to this ratio are noted* 

The effect on the quantity of sulphate-sulphur measured, 
as a result of different oxidation times, is presented in 
Tables IX and X. 

Tables IX and X give the results of different hydrolysis 
times at flour : acid ratios of 1:6 and Is7 respectively* The 
results are presented as averages of duplicates which check

The data presented in the tables suggest that time of 
oxidation over 2 hours has little effect on the sulphate-sulphur 
determined* The precipitates, however, are darkly colored which 
indicates there is considerable occlusion of impurities in the 
precipitates and that oxidation is probably not complete* At 
the shorter hydrolysis times perhaps one effect will offset 
another and thus there is no difference in the weight of the 
precipitates* As the oxidation times were increased the precip¬ 
itate lost much of its darker color and took on the appearance 
of a sulphate precipitate. From a previous experiment (Table VI) 
we would not expect a completely white precipitate at the lower 
flour : acid ratios used in these studies. 

If two or more completely different methods yield the 
same value for a sample, it is highly probable that the value as 
reported is correct* It is unlikely that more than one method 
would respond to different interfering substances in exactly the

same manner and to exactly the same extent. Comparisons of 
different methods for the determination of a single substance 
in the same sample are important to decide whether a single 
method gives reliable results. 

Determinations of cystine were carried out on the same 
gluten by the cuprous mercaptide method (19) and the differential- 
oxidation procedure. In addition gluten sample one was analysed 
for methionine by the method of Lavine, which is based on the 
reaction of methionine with iodine, and the differential-oxida¬ 
tion procedure. The results are reported in Table A. 

Samples one and two are glutens from Thatcher wheat 
grown at respectively Fallis and Edmonton.

significant difference between the results of the two methods* 

The slightly higher result for the cuprous mercaptide method 
may be due to the presence of purines* 

The results of the methionine determinations check 
within approximately 10 % for this sample of gluten* 

There is no reliable specific method for the determina¬ 
tion of cystine in materials containing large amounts of carbo¬ 
hydrates* Thus it is very difficult to compare accurately results 
from specific and the differential-oxidation procedures* 

A microbiological method for methionine determinations 
has been used successfully on organic materials which contain 
large amounts of carbohydrates* This method (35) was used for 
comparison* 

Methionine determinations were carried out on a one-gram 
flour sample which was hydrolysed at 15 pounds pressure in 25 ml* 
of 2 N HC 1 * The hydrolysate was filtered and neutralized* 
Triplicate determinations were carried out at two dilutions* 

Methionine was also determined on the same flour using 
the differential-oxidation procedure* The results of the two 
methods are compared in ^able B*

RESULTS 


Series I - Marquis flour, I9U4. 

Gerbrandt (19) has carried out analyses for the sulphur- 
containing amino acids in the gluten washed from these flourso 
He correlated the cystine and methionine contents of the gluten 
from 100 grams of flour with loaf volume• His conclusion was 
that both cystine and methionine so determined were better 
measures of baking quality than was crude protein in the whole 
wheat# Gerbrandt suggested that the correlations of the sulphur- 
containing amino acids with loaf volume were higher than those 
of crude protein and loaf volume because the former were measured 
on gluten while the latter is a measure of all nitrogen-containing

compounds in the whole wheat* The quantity of gluten in a 
flour is usually directly related to loaf volume* For this 
reason the quantity of cystine or methionine in gluten from 
100 grams of flour could be a better measure of loaf volume 
than the percentage nitrogen in the wheat. In other words 
the sulphur-containing amino acids of the gluten in 100 grams 
of flour are highly correlated with loaf volume because they are 
direct measures of gluten quantity* 

As a method was available for the determinaii on of 
cystine and methionine in flour it was of interest to compare 
with the previous work the correlations of loaf volume and the 
sulphur-containing amino acids in the complete flour. 

The sulphur, cystine, methionine and nitrogen contents 
were determined on the flours and are presented in Table XI* 

The loaf volumes, which are the same as those used by G-erbrandt, 
are also included* 

For the cystine determinations in this series, the 
samples were oxidized with 7 ml* of nitric acid per gram flour. 
Checks between duplicate samples were accepted when the values 
agreed within 5$. 

The calculated correlation coefficients are given in

nitrogen and sulphur contents of flour on loaf volume are 
apparently related* A relationship is expected because the 
simple correlation of sulphur and nitrogen is highly significant* 
The simple correlations of sulphur and nitrogen con¬ 
tent of wheat with loaf volume as described by Gerbrandt are 
highly significant* These correlations in conjunction with 
those determined in this study indicate that the sulphur and 
nitrogen contents of the flour are closely related to the 
sulphur and nitrogen contents of the wheat* 

Nitrogen is a measure of the quantity of crude protein 
in flour* As the nitrogen and sulphur of the flour are highly 
significantly correlated there must be a relationship between 
the sulphur content and the quantity of protein in the flour* 

The measurement of the sulphur content of flour is therefore 
another measure of protein quantity and thus there is a high 
correlation between loaf-volume and sulphur content* However 
with the effect of nitrogen removed the correlation is not 
significant, indicating that the effect of sulphur on loaf 
volume is directly associated with the nitrogen effect* 

The cystine, methionine and loaf volume statistics 
indicate that the quantity of sulphur-containing amino acids 
in flour is another measure of the quantity of protein in the 
flour* When the quantity of protein is kept constant there 
is no significant correlation of cystine or methionine with

study probably because his determinations of the amino acids 
were on crude gluten while the nitrogen was determined on 
the whole wheat* 

That the cystine and methionine contents of the flour 
do not affect loaf volume is shown by the values for the partial 
coefficients ^jijv G an< ^ r DJV M # ^ ie n dtrogen does affect 
the loaf volume* 

Gerbrandt found that the quantity of cystine and methio¬ 
nine in the gluten in 100 grams of flour were factors which 
affected loaf volume* The conclusion from the present analysis 
is that loaf volume is more closely associated with protein 
content than with the content of the sulphur-containing amino 
acids in the flour* 

•^s there are only eight samples in this experiment, 
the values of the simple and partial correlation coefficients 
indicate that the cystine content of flour is related to the 
total sulphur but not to the nitrogen content of the flour* 

The calculated regression line of cystine and sulphur is shown 
in Figure I,A* The regression coefficient is given in Table 
XII* 

Gerbrandt found a highly significant correlation between 
the cystine content of gluten and the sulphur content of wheat•

gluten, flour and wheat would be expected* 

The methionine, sulphur and nitrogen correlations 
show that the effects of the nitrogen and sulphur contents of 
flour on the methionine content are apparently related* These 
data suggest that nitrogen and sulphur affect the methionine 
content of flour in much the same way as when taken together* 
Figure 1,3 gives the regression line of methionine and sulphuro 
The regression coefficient is given in Table XII* 

The correlation coefficient of cystine and methionine

Series II - Thatcher wheat and flour, Breton. 1914-6 and 1914 - 7 » 

The material in this series is valuable for a study 
of factors affecting the sulphur and sulphur-containing amino 
acids because of the wide range in sulphur content* 

Loaf volume relationships were determined only for the 
1947 crop because, as was previously stated, there are very 
small volume differences in the I9I4.6 crop* With a baking error 
of 60 cc* few plots in either Series E or B of the I9I4.6 crop 
produced loaf volumes significantly different from the mean* 
Table XIII and Figure II, A, B, C and D show the 
sulphur, cystine, methionine and nitrogen contents of wheat 
harvested from the continuous wheat plots of the Breton field. 
Included in the table are the loaf volumes and cystine-sulphur 
as a percentage of the total sulphur* 

The analyses of variance for sulphur, cystine, methio¬ 
nine and nitrogen sire given in Table XIV* 

The variations in the nitrogen content of the wheat 
in the continuous rotation are very small. This is shown 
graphically in Figure II, C # The application of fertilizers 
had little affect on the nitrogen content of the wheat.

Minimum significant differences for treatment are; 

0*008$ sulphur* 

0.05$ nitrogen* 

0.015$ cystine* 

0*05$ methionine* 

In most cases the application of sulphur fertilizers 
increases the sulphur content of the wheat* Usually the sulphur 
fertilized plots produce wheat significantly higher in cystine 
content than the non-fertilized plots* As would be expected 
the cystine content of the wheat is closely related to the 
sulphur content* As a rule the high sulphur wheats are highest 
In cystine content while the low sulphur wheats are lowest* The 
correlation coefficients show the close relationship between the 
cystine and sulphur contents of this wheat* 

The calculated correlation and regression coefficients 
are presented in Table XV. The cystine, sulphur scatter is

plotted in Figure III, A, 

The correlations and bar diagrams show that the cystine 
content of wheat is influenced more by the sulphur than the 
nitrogen content# 

An average of 78 percent of the total sulphur in the 
wheat of this series Is present as cystine-sulphur# There does 
not appear to be any relationship between the quality or quantity 
of fertilizers applied and the percentage of total sulphur 
represented as cystine-sulphur# 

There are very small if any variations in the methionine 
contents of the various wheats from Series E# Check plot one 
is reported as containing 0#l8 per cent methionine. This value 
appears relatively high* An error in either the cystine or sul¬ 
phur determination would give such a result. Assuming either the 
cystine or the sulphur percentage as correct it is possible to 
obtain the alternate constituent from the regression line in 
Figure III, A or from the regression coefficient in Table XV* 

A corrected methionine content can be calculated as a difference 
between the cystine-sulphur and the total sulphur values so 
obtained# The corrected value for the check plot one is 0#15$. 
Using this value as a check, the wheat from the lime plot is 
significantly higher and the wheat from the manure plot signific¬ 
antly lower in methionine. The sulphur and cystine contents of 
these wheats suggest that the values are misrepresented due to 
errors in the determinations. When the values for methionine 
in these wheats are corrected as in the case of the check plot.

there are no significant differences in the methionine of the 
wheat from Series E. 

The results suggest that the methionine content of the 
continuous wheat is not affected by the applications of 
fertilizers# 

The correlation coefficients r* MS and r Mg ^ suggest 
that the methionine in wheat is not Influenced by the sulphur 
content# This is not what we would expect# . In this particular 
series the methionine range is very small and a few values con¬ 
siderably out of line would upset the methionine-sulphur correla¬ 
tion# 

The scatter diagram of methionine and sulphur in Figure 
III, B shows how few values will destroy the correlation# 

When the values obviously out of line are corrected by the use 
of the cystine , total sulphur regression, the methionine content 
is directly related to the sulphur content of the wheat. There 
is no relationship between the methionine and nitrogen contents 
of wheat# 

The percentages of the total sulphur present in wheat as 
methionine-sulphur can be obtained from Table XIII# Obviously 
the values are the differences between the cystine percentages 
and 100 percent#

The sulphur, cystine, methionine and nitrogen contents 
of the wheat grown on Series B, Breton plots are presented 
in Table XVI and Figure II* The loaf volumes and the values 
for cystine-sulphur as a percentage of the total sulphur in 
the wheat are also presented in the table* 

The analyses of variance for sulphur, cystine, methionine 
and nitrogen are given in Table XVII* 

The calculated correlation and regression coefficients 
are presented in Table XVIII* 

The loaf volumes of Series B exhibit a slightly greater 
range than those of Series E. No attempts were made to correlate 
loaf volume with the other results because the range of volumes 
is within the 60 cc* baking error of the mean. 

The diagrams in figure II show that generally speaking 
wheat after clover has a greater range for each constituent 
determined than the continuous wheat. 

The sulphur-containing fertilizers have decreased the 
nitrogen content of the wheat more significantly than the 
others. The lower nitrogen content of the grain can be attri¬ 
buted to increased yields resulting from the application of 
sulphur fertilizers (I|.l). Table XVI and figure II, A show 
that the application of fertilizers containing significant 
amounts of sulphur have resulted in increases in the sulphur 
content of wheat* The increases in sulphur and decreases 
in nitrogen caused by the application of sulphur fertilizers 
explain the negative and significant simple correlation 
coefficient for sulphur and nitrogen.

The effect of the fertilizers on the cystine content 
of the wheat is similar to the effect on the sulphur content* 
This situation is similar to that observed in the wheat after 
wheat series. The regression line for cystine and sulphur 
is plotted in figure IV,A. As in the wheat after wheat series, 
the cystine content of Series B wheat is not related to the 
nitrogen content but is closely associated with the sulphur 
content* The application to wheat of fertilizers containing 
large amounts of sulphur results in large and significant in¬ 
creases in cystine and sulphur contents* The fertilizer treat¬ 
ments decreg.se the nitrogen content of wheat but this apparently 
has no effect on the cystine content* 

Approximately "JO to 80 percent of the sulphur in 
Series B wheat is present as cystine-sulphur• This is a similar 
proportion to that in the Series E wheat. There is no apparent 
relationship between fertilizer treatment and the amount of 
sulphur present in cystine. 

Generally the application of sulphur-containing fer¬ 
tilizers has resulted in increases in the methionine content 
of the wheat. The regression line figure IV, B shows that the 
methionine and sulphur contents of wheat are closely related* 
Nitrogen variations in the wheat have no influence on the 
methionine content. 

The simple correlation coefficient is positive and 

highly significant. This suggests that in the wheat proteins 
of Series B the methionine and cystine contents are related*

Figure IV, A - Cystine?sulphur relationship, 
Breton wheat. Series B. 



Figure IV, B - Methionine;sulphur relationship, 
Breton wheat. Series B. 











The analyses of flours from Series E and B were carried 
out to determine whether the sulphur, cystine, methionine and 
nitrogen relationships in flour are the same as in wheat# 

The sulphur, cystine, methionine and nitrogen contents 
of the flours from Series E wheat are presented in Table XIX* 

The percentages as reported are slightly lower in the flour 
than in the wheat* There is a close relationship between these 
constituents in wheat and flour* This can be readily seen from 
the correlation coefficients in Table XXI. The wheat samples 
with the higher sulphur, cystine, methionine and nitrogen values 
produce flour higher In these constituents. The lower values 
for the wheat and flour are also related. 

The analyses of variance for the data are given in 
Table XX. Fertilizer treatments have resulted in significant 
differences for the constituents determined. 

The correlation and regression coefficients for Series E 
are presented in Table XXI. The regression lines for cystine 
and sulphur and methionine and sulphur are plotted in figure 
V, A and B* These data show that the cystine and methionine 
contents of flour, as of wheat, are determined by sulphur rather 
than nitrogen content of the flour. 

The cystine-sulphur as a percentage of the total sulphur 
in the flour is included in Table XIX* 

The significant simple correlation coefficient, r~ mc 
suggests that the methionine and cystine in the flour are related* 
This was not observed in Series E wheat.

SULPHUR % 


Figure V, B - Methionine:sulphur relationship. 








-66- 


The sulphur, cystine, methionine and nitrogen contents 
of the flour milled from Series B wheat are presented in 
Table XXII* The cystine-sulphur as a percentage of the total 
sulphur is included in the table* 

Generally there is a close relationship between the 
quantities of determined constituents in the flour and wheat* 
This is shown by the correlation coefficients in Table XXIV. 

The sulphur and cystine contents are generally smaller in the 
flour than in the wheat. The methionine values for flour, on 
the other hand, are not consistent* They are aometimes higher 
and sometimes lower than the values for wheat* Nitrogen deter¬ 
minations were not carried out on all of the Series B flour 
because of insufficient material* There is, however, a trend 
tov/ards a lower nitrogen content in the flour than in the wheat. 

The results of the simple analyses of variance on the 
data are presented in Table XXIII* The fertilizer treatments 
have a significant effect on the quantities of sulphur, cystine, 
methionine and nitrogen in the flour. 

The correlation and regression coefficients for Series B 
are presented in Table XXIV. The regression lines for cystine 
and sulphur and methionine and sulphur are plotted in Figure VI, 
A and B. The relationships between sulphur, cystine, methionine 
and nitrogen are similar to those observed in Series E flour* 

The sulphur-containing amino acid content of flour is deter¬ 
mined by sulphur rather than nitrogen content of flour.

Cystine : sulphur relationship

When wheat is milled there are considerable quantities 
of bran, feed flour and red dog flour removed* From the 
available data an estimate can be made of the percentage of 
the total cystine and methionine in wheat which remains in the 
flour© 

Table XXV gives the amounts of cystine and methionine 
in the flour as the percentage of the sulphur-containing amino 
acids present in the wheat© The percentage extraction of 
flour from wheat varies for each individual sample© The 
exact extraction data were not available. For the calcula¬ 
tions reported it was assumed that the Allis-Chalmers experi¬ 
mental mill extracted 65 $ of the wheat as flour© 

The percentage extraction of cystine in the flour is 
approximately the same in both series© These data show that 
approximately 60 $ of the cystine in wheat is extracted with 
the flour© 

The values for the methionine contents of wheat or 
flour of sample 16, Series B and samples 2, 9 $ 1? and 15# 

Series E are not accurate. This is obvious because more than 
100$ extraction is obtained. Table XXV shows that approximately 
60 $ of the methionine in the wheat of both series is extracted 
in the flour© The mean and standard deviation for Series E 
are considerably greater than the values for Series B. If 
the values in Series E above 100$ are discarded, the mean 
and standard deviation are 65 t 13 $*

The 191+7 crop of Thatcher wheat grown in a clover 
rotation at the Breton station produced bread with large 
differences in loaf volume. This material was therefore 
satisfactory for use in a study of loaf volume as affected 
by the sulphur-containing amino acids. 

The sulphpr, cystine, methionine and nitrogen were 
determined in the wheat. The results are presented in Table 
XXVI and figure VII, A, B, C and D. Included in the table 
are the loaf volumes and the cystine-sulphur as a percentage 


of the total sulphur.

Simple analyses of variance of the sulphur, cystine, 
methionine and nitrogen data are given in Table XXVII* The 
analyses show that the fertilizer treatments result in sig¬ 
nificant increases in the sulphur, amino acid and nitrogen 
contents of Series C wheat* 

The calculated correlation and regression coefficients 
are tabulated in Table XXVIII* 

As in the material previously investigated the sulphur 
content of the wheat increases with the application of sulphur 
fertilizerso Generally, the cystine contents of the seventeen 
samples of wheat follow the sulphur contents* The highest 
sulphur samples have the most cystine, the lowest sulphur 
samples the least* The relationship between cystine and 
sulphur is shown graphically in figure VII, A and B and 
figure VIII, A* The highly significant simple and partial 
correlation coefficients rj-,g and y*q 3 ^ confirm the close 
relationship between cystine and sulphur*

Figure VIII, D. and B, indicates that there is no 
relationship between the cystine and nitrogen contents of this 
wheat. The simple and partial correlation coefficients Vqjj 
and g confirm the lack of relationship between cystine 

and nitrogen* 

The methionine contents of the wheat after clover in 

the 19 ^ 4-7 crop are distributed over a considerable range* 

Figure VII, A and D, and the correlation coefficients in 

Table XXVIII show that the methionine content of the wheat is 

related to the sulphur content* The scatter of methionine and 

sulphur values and the regression line are plotted in figure 

VIII, B* The correlation coefficients Y\ ffKr and V™ ~ and 
7 MN MN.G 

figure VII show that the nitrogen content of wheat has no 
effect on the methionine content* 

The simple correlation coefficient suggests that 

the amounts of methionine and cystine in the wheat proteins 
are related. 

The correlation coefficients between loaf volume and 
the various wheat constituents determined are tabulated in 
Table XXVIII* There are no significant relationships between 
loaf volume and sulphur, cystine, methionine or nitrogen in 
wheat* 

The cystine and nitrogen contents of Series C flour 
are given in Table XXIX* Sulphur determinations were not 
carried out on this series. It would be expected, however.

that the correlation between the sulphur and cystine in the 
flour is highly significant# 

Table XXEX also gives the cystine in the flour as a 
percentage of that present in the wheat# The values are 
calculated assuming a 65$ flour extraction# The range and 
mean of the cystine in the flour as reported are very similar 
to the values reported for the 19)4.6 wheat# 

The cystine content of Series G flour, as in Series 
E and B, is generally lower than that of the wheat. The 
highly significant correlation coefficient between the cystine 
contents of wheat and flour presented in Table XXX shows that 
changes in wheat cystine are accompanied by similar changes 
in flour cystine# 

The correlation coefficients calculated for Series C 
flour are presented in Table XXX* 

The simple correlation between cystine and nitrogen 
indicates a relationship between this amino acid and nitrogen# 
The partial correlation coefficient between cystine and nitro¬ 
gen with the effects of sulphur removed is not calculated# It 
is likely that this statistic would be non-signifleant# 

The loaf volumes of the samples are highly correlated 
with the nitrogen content of the flour# The correlation of 
nitrogen in the wheat and loaf volume, as previously pointed 
out, is not significant# This shows that there are quantities 
of nitrogen in the mill by-products which are not related to 
loaf volume. These quantities of nitrogen are sufficiently

significantly correlated with Iosif volume* In the material 
reported on in this paper there is no significant correlation 
between the sulphur in wheat and loaf volume. It was of in¬ 
terest to see if the constituents of gluten were correlated 
with loaf volume* 

The sulphur, cystine, methionine and nitrogen were 
determined on the gluten washed from Series C flour* The

results are reported in Table XXXI* The cystine-sulphur, as 
a percentage of the total sulphur values i*s also included 
in the table# 

A simple analysis of variance was carried out on each 
of the constituents determined# The results are reported in 
Table XXXII# 

The calculated correlation and regression coefficients 
are presented in Table XXXIII# The loaf volume data used for 
the calculations are, of course, the same as those used for 
the wheat correlations# 

The application of sulphur-containing fertilizers to 
the wheat resulted in an increase in the sulphur in the crude 
gluten protein# The highly significant simple correlation 
Ygyy in Table XXXIII shows that there is a close relationship 
between the sulphur contents of wheat and gluten# 

Sulphur and cystine and sulphur and methionine in 
gluten are highly correlated# The regression coefficients and 
regression lines are presented in Table XXXIII and figure IX 
A and B respectively* The sulphur-containing amino acids are 
not related to the nitrogen content of the gluten# The high 
values for the sulphur correlation coefficients indicate that 
the sulphur-containing amino acids in the gluten proteins 
vary with variations in the total sulphur* The nitrogen correla¬ 
tion coefficients show that the nitrogen content of the gluten 
has no effect on the quantities of cystine and methionine in 
the gluten#

SULPHUR %

The small range In the nitrogen content of the seventeen 
glutens indicates that they are similar in purity* There are 
small differences in the nitrogen contents of the glutens but 
they could be caused by differences in gluten strength* Using 
loaf volume as a measure of gluten strength, small volumes 
indicate weak glutens and large volumes strong glutens. The 
weak glutens readily give up starch In the washing process* 

The strong glutens, on the other hand, retain some starch* 

This results in a diluted gluten protein and less nitrogen on 
a percentage basis* 

The relationship between cystine and methionine observed 
in the whole wheat proteins also exists in the gluten proteins. 
The sulphur-containing amino acids, cystine and methibnine, are 
probably related in the non-gluten and mill by-product fractions 
of wheat* 

The cystine-sulphur accounts for approximately the same 
percentage of the total sulphur in the gluten as in the whole 
wheat# This would indicate that the total sulphur in the 
non-gluten or mill by-product proteins has a similar distribution 
of cystine and methionine to that in the gluten proteins. 

The correlation coefficients given in Table XXXIV show 
that the quantities of gluten in flour expressed as wet or dry 
weight are closely related to baking strength* The regression 
lines and scatters are shown in figure X, A and B. The actual 
percentages of wet and dry gluten in flour are given in Table 
XXXV*

The sulphur-containing amino acid content of gluten 
is not related to baking strength. This is shown by some of 
the correlation coefficients presented in Table XXXIII# The 
simple correlation between the quantity of cystine in the gluten 
of 100 grams of flour and loaf volume is significant# This 
value is given in Table XXXIV. The combination of the quantity 
of gluten and its cystine content gives a value which is 
significantly and positively related to loaf volume# The cystine 
in the gluten of 100 grams of flour is actually another measure 
of the quantity of gluten in the flour# 

The difference between the cystine content of the 
flour and the cystine content of the gluten of 100 grams of flour 
gives a value for the non-gluten cystine in the flour# Table 
XXXVI gives the cystine contents of the non-gluten proteins in 
17 samples of Series G flour# The correlation coefficient 
between non-gluten cystine and loaf volume is given in Table 
XXXIV# 

A considerable proportion of the cystine In flour is 
present in the non-gluten protein# The actual values for Series 
C flour can be calculated from the values of Table XXXVI# The 
table gives the cystine in gluten as a percentage of the total 
cystine in the flour# The percentage cystine In the non-gluten 
proteins is 100 percent minus the percentage gluten cystine# 

The extent of hydration of glutens of different quality 
will give a measure of the physical properties of the gluten# 

The differences in hydration of glutens of different quality as

measured by percentage moisture possibly are related to the amino 
acid composition of the gluten proteins* Attempts were made to 
relate the sulphur-containing amino acid content of gluten 
with the percentage moisture of the gluten* 

The moisture percentages of the seventeen gluten samples 
from Series C flour are presented in Table XXXV* The moisture 
contents of these glutens were similar* The quality of the 
gluten as indicated by hydration is similar in the seventeen 
samples* There are large and significant differences in the 
quantity of sulphur-containing amino acids in the gluten* 
Therefore, in the gluten there does not appear to be a relation¬ 
ship between the physical properties measured by the hydration 
capacity and the sulphur-containing amino acid content*

Series III - Water culture experiments 

Experiments I and II, as reported under "Materials,” 
were carried out primarily to determine if and when there is 
a critical period for sulphur nutrient supply in the formation 
of the sulphur-containing amino acids in wheat. 

The results of the analysis of the wheat from Experiment 
I are presented in Table XXXVII. 

The results cannot be analysed statistically but by 
observation it Is evident that the cystine contents of the 
wheat grown on the sulphur deficient nutrient solutions are 
as high as those of the check. The nitrogen contents of the 
wheat are similar. 

This preliminary experiment suggests that either the 
wheat plant obtains all the sulphur needed for cystine synthesis 
in the first two weeks of the growing period or that there is 
a source of sulphur that has not been controlled. The cystine 
content of the wheat is abnormally high. It would be expected 
that the sulphur content of the wheat would also be high. A 
rough calculation shows that there is sufficient sulphur 
supplied in the first two weeks to account for the sulphur 
content of the wheat. 

The results of experiment II are presented in Table 
XXXVII, B. The cystine-sulphur : total sulphur ratio is also 
included in the table.

The cystine content of the wheat is less in experiment 
II than experiment I. The trend, however, is the same in both 
cases• 

There is very little if any difference in the percentages 
of nitrogen, sulphur and cystine* The wheat from tank two 
appears to contain slightly more sulphur and considerably more 
methionine than the wheat from the other tanks* The methionine 
value, however, seems so far out of line that there is probably 
an error in the cystine or sulphur determination* The low 
cystine-sulphur : total sulphur ratio for tank two wheat 
strengthens this suggestion* The cystine-sulphur : total sulphur 
ratios of the other tanks are approximately the same and they 
resemble very closely the ratios reported in earlier experiments* 

Yield data were not taken for experiment II because of 
heavy damage by sparrows 9 General observations showed that 
there were no marked differences in yield* At harvest the 
plants were approximately the same height* Yields of the 
tanks might aid in an explanation of the observed results* 

It would be expected that the sulphur deficient tanks would 
have a lower yield. The available sulphur would then be dis¬ 
tributed over a smaller number of kernels. This would result 
in a higher sulphur content for the wheat*

Experiments III and IV were carried out to compare the 
effects of variations in the sulphur and nitrogen contents of 
the nutrient solutions on the ultimate sulphur, nitrogen, and 
sulphur-containing amino acid contents of wheat* 

The results of the experiments are presented in Table 
XXXVIII, A and B. 

The high nitrogen, high sulphur nutrient solution of 
Experiment III produced wheat highest in sulphur, cystine and 
methionine* The low nitrogen, low sulphur solution produced 
wheat with the smallest amounts of sulphur, nitrogen and sulphur- 
containing amino acids* The high sulphur, low nitrogen tank 
and the high nitrogen, low sulphur tank produced wheat that was 
intermediate in sulphur, cystine and methionine* The nitrogen 
in the wheat of the high nitrogen, low sulphur treatment is 
higher than the high nitrogen, high sulphur treatment* 

In view of results of previous experiments the high 
sulphur tank, number two, was expected to produce wheat higher 
in sulphur cystine and methionine than tahk three. This was 
not the case* 

Yield data could possibly explain the deviations from 
the expected. Yields were not taken on this material because 
of extensive damage and loss of plants caused by sparrows* 
Nevertheless plate I, under "Materials”, and plate II give some 
indication of the yield and relative size of the wheat plants 
at the date of harvest#

Relative heights of wheat 
from Experiment III 


Tank No® 1

High sulphur and low nitrogen treatment produced a 
greater yield than the low sulphur, high nitrogen treatment® 

The sulphur in tank three is distributed over a smaller yield. 
The sulphur, sulphur-containing amino acids and nitrogen per¬ 
centages are expected to be higher where the yield is reduced* 
This is the situation observed. 

The low sulphur, low nitrogen wheat from tank one is 
much lower in the percentages of the determined constituents 
than the wheat from the other low sulphur tank (tank three). 

The yield of tank one is considerably greater than that of 
tank three and the same amounts of sulphur are distributed over 
a greater yield of material. 

Variations in the sulphur contents of the wheat are 
closely related to the variations in cystine and methionine 
content. Figure XI, A, B, shows a close relationship between 
cystine and sulphur and methionine and sulphur® Figure XI, 

G, D, shows that the nitrogen is not closely related to the 
cystine or methionine contents of the wheat.

Relationships of cystine and methionine to sulphur and nitrogen 

in wheat from experiment III* 


















- 101 - 


The cystine-sulphur : total sulphur ratios are 
generally similar to those in experiment I# With an increase 
in total sulphur in the wheat there is a decrease in the 
sulphur represented as cystine* 

In experiment IY, the high nitrogen, high sulphur tank 
was expected to produce wheat higher in sulphur, cystine and 
methionine* The complete stoppage of sulphur after about two 
months has not resulted in any significant decreases in sulphur 
or methionine* The cystine value is slightly lower in the low 
sulphur tank* The cystine-sulphur : total sulphur ratios are 
similar to those in experiment III* 

The results of this experiment suggest that there is 
a source of sulphur available to the plant which has not been 
recognized* Possible sources are described under "Discussion”•

DISCUSSION AND SUMMARY 


The development of methods for the determination of 
sulphur-containing amino acids in whole wheat and flour has 
made possible a more complete study of these constituents in 
wheat proteins* Rigby ( 3 I 4 .) and Gerbrandt (19) found significant 
correlations of the sulphur-containing amino acids in gluten 
with loaf volume* As this work was on gluten which contains 
only a part of the cystine it was desirable to carry out 
analysis on the non-gluten fractions of wheat* 

Heserves of the material used by Gerbrandt were avail¬ 
able for a further study of the effect of the sulphur-containing 
amino acids on loaf volume* Determinations of the sulphur-con¬ 
taining amino acids were carried out on the complete flour* 

The correlations with loaf volume indicate that the quantity 
of the crude protein of flour is a better measure of loaf volume 
than the percentage of cystine or methionine. The present 
study suggests that the method used by Gerbrandt to obtain 
positive correlations with the sulphur-containing amino acids 
is actually a correlation of gluten quantity with loaf volumeo 

The cystine content of Marquis flour is highly correlated 
with the sulphur content. There is no relationship between the 
total nitrogen and cystine contents of the flour* Cultural 
methods that will change the sulphur content of the flour will 
affect the cystine content to a greater degree than will changes

in nitrogen content* 

The methionine content of the Marquis flour is highly 
correlated with both the sulphur and nitrogen contents* The 
partial correlation between methionine and sulphur independent 
of the effects of nitrogen is non-significant* Similarly the 
partial correlation of methionine and nitrogen with the effects 
of sulphur removed is non-significant* These correlations 
suggest that both the nitrogen and sulphur contents of Marquis 
flour influence the methionine content* The sulphur and nitrogen 
effects on methionine are related* 

The analysis of the Marquis flour suggests that the 
quantity of cystine and perhaps methionine could be varied with 
variations in the sulphur content of flour* The sulphur in 
flour would be expected to vary with the sulphur in wheat* 

The sulphur was determined on samples of wheat grown 
at Breton in the continuous wheat crop series in I9J4.6 and the 
wheat after clover crops for 19M> and 1947* There were significant 
differences in the sulphur contents of wheat as a result of 
fertilizer treatments* This is in agreement with the work of 
Peters (33)• Generally the application of sulphur-containing 
fertilizers resulted in significantly greater increases of sul¬ 
phur than the check or non-sulphur-fertilized plots* 

The cystine content of the wheat followed the sulphur 
content very closely* The simple and partial correlation 
coefficients are highly significant* Changes in the nitrogen 
content of the wheat had no effect on the quantities of cystine 
presento

In I 9 I 4.6 the wheat after clover crop had a much greater 
range in the determined constituents than the wheat from the 
continuous series® The legumes in the clover rotation are deep 
feeders. They probably bring leached sulphates closer to the 
surface where they are available to the wheat plant. In 
addition, the nitrogen content of the soil is increased because 
of nitrogen fixing bacteria. The greater availability of 
sulphur and nitrogen results in increases in the amount of 
cystine. The nitrogen intake of a wheat plant is of course 
utilized for the manufacture of numerous amino acids, proteins 
and other nitrcgen-containing compounds. The sulphur, on the 
other hand, goes into the synthesis of only cystine, methionine 
and a few minor sulphur-containing compounds. The correlations 
of sulphur and cystine are therefore much more significant than 
the relationships between nitrogen and cystine. 

The methionine content of the wheat is closely related 
to the sulphur uptake. The various fertilizer treatments have 
had little if any significant effect on the methionine contents 
of the wheat from the continuous series. The treatments, however, 
do result in large methionine differences in the wheat of the 
clover series in both years. Both the sulphur and nitrogen 
contents of the fertilized plots are higher in the wheat from 
the clover series. With more available nitrogen, the methionine 
increases with increases in sulphur. In the continuous series 
there is less available nitrogen, and the increases in methio¬ 
nine, although they are related to the increases in sulphur.

the continuous series is 0.06 percent methionine/ 0.1 percent 
sulphuro The corresponding regression for the clover series 
is 0.15 percent methionine/0.1 percent sulphur. The available 
data indicate that if sufficient nitrogen is present in the 
soil, increases in sulphur will result in relatively large 
increases in methionine in wheat. If, however, the intake of 
nitrogen is low, increases in sulphur have little or no effect 
on the methionine content of the wheat. 

The analyses of cystine and sulphur in wheat show that 
in the majority of samples the cystine-sulphur accounts for 
70 to 80 percent of the total sulphur. This does not agree 
with the work of Gubler and Greavear (21) who estimated that 
approximately 50 per cent of the total sulphur in wheat is 
cystine-sulphur. In addition, these workers report that in¬ 
creases in the sulphur and cystine contents of wheat result in 
decreases in the sulphur represented as cystine. No such relation¬ 
ship was apparent in the work reported here. 

The sulphur, cystine, methionine and nitrogen contents 
of flour are slightly lower than in the wheat. Generally there 
is a high correlation between the constituents in wheat and 
flour. The higher sulphur, cystine, methionine and nitrogen 
wheat samples produce flour higher in these constituents. The 
lower sulphur, nitrogen and amino acid wheat samples produce 
flour lower in these constituents.

Of the total cystine In wheat approximately 55 to 65 
percent is found in the flour as milled on an experimental 
mill* The variations in the methionine content of flours as 
a percentage of the total methionine in wheat are slightly 
greater than variations in the cystine* Approximately 52 to 78 
percent of the methionine in wheat is present in the flour* 

Very few flour samples contain less than 50 percent of the 
cystine or methionine of the wheat* The percentage of the wheat 
cystine and perhaps methionine is a relatively constant value* 

The greatest variations in cystine are in Series B. The mean 
and standard deviations are 62 1 10 per cent* The greatest 
variation, for methionine in flour as a percentage of that in 
wheat is in Series E* The mean and standard deviation are 
80 i 27 per cent* 

The wheat after clover crop, I9I+7* shows large variations 
in loaf volume* Rigby (3I4.) found a high correlation between 
sulphur in wheat and loaf volume* His loaf volumes had variations 
of 5I4.7 cc* and 207 cc* for I9I4.I and I9I4.2 respectively* The 
range in the loaf volumes of the 19IJ.7 crop is 355 cc* The 
analysis of Series G wheat, 19 ^ 7 > did- not confirm the work of 
Rigby* Further, the sulphur-containing amino acids of the 
flour and wheat were not significantly correlated with loaf vol¬ 
ume* The significant correlations of the sulphur-containing 
amino acids in gluten with loaf volume as reported by Rigby (3I4.) 
and Gerbrandt (19) were not obtained with the 19^7 material.

gluten washed from Series C flour were not significantly 
positively correlated with loaf volume. However a significant 
positive correlation was obtained with the cystine in the gluten 
of 100 grams of flour. It is obvious that this is not a specific 
relationship but is a measure of the total gluten in the flour. 
The gluten in the flour is highly correlated with loaf volume. 

The correlation between methionine in gluten of 100 
grams of flour and loaf volume was not calculated. Because of 
the highly significant correlation of the gluten content of the 
flour and loaf volume, and the smaller range in methionine con¬ 
tents of the gluten the correlation would be highly significant. 
Oerbrandt (19) suggested that the methionine in the gluten of 
100 grams of flour was a better measure of loaf volume than the 
cystine content of the gluten. This would also be the situation 
in the 19)17 flours. As the cystine contents of the glutens 
have a larger range than the methionine values, the combination 
of the cystine and gluten results gives a smaller correlation 
with loaf volume. 

No differences were noted in the physical properties 
of the glutens investigated as measured by the amount of 
hydration. The sulphur-containing amino acids in these samples 
do not affect the hydration properties of the glutens. 

The quantities of sulphur-containing amino acids in 
the gluten proteins are highly correlated with the amounts of 
these acids in the wheat. Fertilizer treatments that bring 
about changes in the cystine and methionine contents of wheat

have similar effects on the gluten. Changes in the nitrogen 
content of wheat have no apparent affect on the sulphur-contain¬ 
ing amino acids in the gluten proteins. 

Cystine-sulphur accounts for 67©9 - 6*8 percent of the 
total sulphur in the glutens of Series C. This value is similar 
to the sulphur accounted for as cystine in the whole wheat and 
the flour. The non-gluten proteins and mill by-product proteins 
must therefore have approximately the same percentage of their 
total sulphur represented as cystine-sulphur. 

The cystine in the gluten of Series C is 65.6 « 7.0 
per cent of the cystine in the flour<> If 65 percent of the 
wheat cystine is extracted in the flour a rough calculation 
shows that about ij .0 percent of the total cystine in the wheat 
is distributed in the crude gluten. The other 60 percent is 
distributed between the non-gluten proteins of the flour and 
the proteins of the mill by-products. 

The first two water culture experiments suggest that 
either the critical period for sulphur uptake is very early in 
the life cycle of the wheat plant or that there was a large 
amount of sulphur present as an impurity which was utilized by 
the plants. 

Eaton (l 6 ) has pointed out that a plant grown on a 
sulphur-deficient nutrient solution could obtain sulphur from 
a number of sources. 

Following are listed sources of sulphur, some or all 
of which may have had some effect on the experimental results:

(1) sulphur in the air. 

(2) sulphur as an impurity in the nutrient salts• 

(3) sulphur in the seed* 

(ij.) sulphur from the fumigants used to destroy mildew 
and aphids in the greenhouse* 

(5) sulphates present in the distilled water* 

It is unlikely that a single source or even all of the 
sources could supply enough nutrient sulphur to raise the sulphur 
and sulphur-containing amino acid contents of the wheat to the 
high levels observed* 

Eaton ( 16 ) found that soybean and sunflower seed, if 
grown on complete and sulphur-deficient sand cultures, did not 
differ in total sulphur content* The yield of the sulphur 
deficient cultures was much lower than the yield from the com¬ 
plete culture. Eaton attributes the lack of difference to the 
large sources of sulphur found in the air* He concludes that 
sulphur from the seed is not of great importance* 

The cystine contents of experiment I were almost twice 
those of experiment II * The nutrient solutions were made up 
alike* The nitrogen contents of the wheat from experiment I 
are much higher than those of experiment \I$3. The difference 
in cystine content of the wheat from the two experiments is 
probably a result of a quantitative effect of the protein in 
the wheat* 

Variations in the relative sulphur and nitrogen contents 
of the nutrient solutions in experiments III and IV do not give

the expected differences© The yields from the different treat¬ 
ments apparently have some effect on the cystine, sulphur, 
nitrogen and methionine contents of the wheat© 

Experiments III and IV show that similar relationships 
exist between sulphur, cystine, methionine and nitrogen at much 
higher levels than those observed for the Breton material© 

The "differential-oxidation procedure" for the deter¬ 
mination of cystine and methionine in wheat and flour has 
provided some new information© The I9I+7 continuous wheat series 
should be investigated to see if the methionine-nitrogen and 
methionine-sulphur relationships observed in I9I4.6 are valid© 

As there are large amounts of sulphur-containing amino acids in 
the non-gluten flour proteins further investigations should be 
carried out on these proteins©
