THE USE OF PHYTOHORMONES IN FACILITATING 
THE CLONAL PROPAGATION OF ALFALFA, WHEAT AND OATS

INTRODUCTION 

Growth is a fundamental phenomenon and is there¬ 
fore very important in the whole field of biological in¬ 
vestigations. In recent years, investigations have been 
directed toward discovering the rules and mechanisms of 
growth processes in plants. Lately it has been demonst¬ 
rated that there are some active chemical substances 
variously designated as "chemical messengers", plant hor¬ 
mones, growth-hormones, growth stimulators, correlation 
carriers, etc., which are concerned with every phase of 
plant growth and development. Thus progress in the 
development of our knowledge of plant growth is rapidly 
increasing and a voluminous literature has grown around 
these "growth substances". 

Careful investigations have been made by Went (64), 
Thimann (40), Zimmerman (58), Bonner (40) and Cooper (9) 
on the action of growth stimulating chemicals on stems, 
shoots, leaves and roots of various plants. Many res¬ 
ponses manifested by plants have been reported, such as 
local acceleration of growth, inelastic extensibility of

the cell wall, curvatures of stems and leaves, systematic 
versus local responses, swelling and proliferation of 
treated tissues; cell division and induction of adventi¬ 
tious roots; retardation of root elongation followed by 
increase in diameter and production of adventitious roots* 
From these various responses, two very important, 
useful and interesting conclusions can be extracted:- 

The first is that even minute quantities of the 
active, synthetic compounds, with a definite constitution, 
have rhizogenous power such as roots on roots and roots on 
stems. The extent of growth, of root formation, etc. is 
directly dependent on the amount or concentration of auxin 
present. The activity of the auxins seems to be much more 
quantitative than qualitative. Thimann (45) has brought 
out the fact, substantiated by Grace (14), that quanti¬ 
tative differences in auxin sensitivity exist not only 
between responses of stems and roots, but between almost 
all different types of tissues. 

The second point, equally important, is that un¬ 
doubtedly the whole complex of the growth hormones is 
necessary for eliciting response from plants, yet the 
physiological as well as the anatomical conditions within 
the plant and the specific reactivity of the tissues 
acted upon, are also responsible for their ready response 
in initiating roots for propagation. Thus it is obvious 
that the success of the treated cuttings, etc. depends 
largely upon creating a suitable environment; for varying

environmental conditions change the capacity of plants 
to respond when treated with any of the several synthetic 
auxins. Plants in different stages of maturity or similar 
plants at different seasons of the year vary in their capa¬ 
city to respond to treatment. The influencing factors such 
as humidity, temperature, aeration and light must he suit¬ 
ably controlled for the expression of the responses in¬ 
volving the organization of cells for the production of 
adventitious organs. 

Thus the discoveries, in rapid succession, of 
"growth hormone” and of identity with one of the plant 
hormones of root formation so called "rhizocaline” have 
stimulated the interests of the plant physiologists, the 
plant breeders, the home gardener and the commercial 
grower, in the use of these synthetic auxins. These then 
led to a number of practical applications, particularly 
in the rooting of cuttings which were very much harder to 
grow, took longer previously and, also, which were unres¬ 
ponsive to other treatments. This made it desirable to 
investigate the problem of asexual propagation rather 
thoroughly on a wide variety of plants. 

During the past few years, 32 growth-promoting 
substances have been reported. Among them are 14 organic 
acids, 11 esters, 4 unsaturated carbon containing gases 
and salts of the various acids. All of these have been 
found effective in eliciting responses from various plant 
species. Among these, approximately 85 genera, involving

several hundred species and varieties have been found to 
make satisfactory response when given the proper chemical 
treatment* It seems to be established that the right con¬ 
centration and environmental conditions can bring about, 
to a great extent, the desired response from a plant* 

The main objective of this investigation is to 
present results obtained from using three synthetic auxins, 
namely B-indolylacetic, B-indolylbutyric and L-naphtha- 
leneacetic acid. These three organic synthetic auxins 
were prepared by Dr. Manske at Ottawa, Canada. They were 
used in all of these experiments and were applied to the 
cuttings of only three crop plants; alfalfa, wheat and 
oats by the solution method with the purpose of deter¬ 
mining their practical values in propagation by cuttings 
or clones. These three plants are almost new in the list 
of hormonal experiments. Their possibility for clonal 
propagation by the applications of these three synthetic 
auxins had not been reeonnoitered nor statistically 
determined. Present investigations on these plants are 
therefore new and are replete with many practical utilities 
in the future of plant breeding work and in the science 
of genetics. However, one must remember that although 
the goal of the agriculturist is to get tangible results, 
the best to be had for a given cost, yet to the scientist, 
all truths have ultimate worth, and all search for truth 
has an inherent validity transcending any economic con¬ 
siderations.

The following seem to be some obvious material 
advantages which can be derived from the results of these 
investigations * 

(1) In order to investigate and make use of 
the effect of environmental factors on the hereditary con¬ 
stitution of a very few available alfalfa or cereal plants, 
one must keep the hereditary constitution constant. It 
is, therefore, highly desirable to make a few cuttings 
from each available plant and from these to produce new 
adequately rooted plants. This may be facilitated by the 
use of the synthetic auxin treatment, thus making possible 
an extensive crop of similarly constituted plants. It is, 
therefore, abundantly clear that this investigation is 
very useful to plant breeders and research workers. 

(2) Rooting cuttings or clones seems to be 
necessary and highly desirable for increasing any lot of 
alfalfa or cereal plants where only a limited number of 
seeds are available. For instance, in plant breeding work, 
it is very often impossible to get a sufficient number of 
F 2 seeds for the production of adequate populations be¬ 
cause of sterility and incompatibility. Thus it is 
possible to multiply F-j_ plants by growing rooted cuttings 
and to increase the number of Fg seeds. 

(3) These investigations also indicate a method 
of maintaining unaltered stocks of specially valuable 

plants, for example, rare selections, a few hybrid plants

possessing desired characteristics, imported material 
whether homozygous or heterozygous, etc. Individual plants 
selected as parents in a given cross may he maintained 
asexually after the cross has been completed and the seeds 
matured. Moreover, by this method, the identical parent 
stock may be used for any number of subsequent crosses. 

If for any reason, more seeds are desired, the jr 
plants may be further propagated asexually. How can a 
superior strain of alfalfa be raised for a certain region 
and enough seeds be obtained for that locality to grow 
an alfalfa crop? The hardiness and well branched type 
of root system characteristic of certain alfalfa varieties 
can be combined with the higher yielding capacity of some 
other group through variety, hybridization, and the few 
selected plants may be increased by this method in order 
to obtain more seeds. 

(4) One can also produce desirable material for 
cytological studies within a short time. 

On the whole, the rooting of cuttings are very 
desirable to increase the lots without any genetic alter¬ 
ations in any plant material. It is likely that many 
more possible uses will suggest themselves as workers come 

to realize the importance of alfalfa and cereal cuttings. 

It is worth while to mention here that cyto¬ 
logical and histological studies were not attempted in 
this work. The important researches of Kraus, Hamner

HISTORICAL BACKGROUND AND LITERATURE REVIEW . 

While there are numerous references in the 
literature to the "Avena coleoptile", a "botanical guinea- 
pig% as it were, practically nothing has been published 
regarding the rooting of cereal and alfalfa clones. 

References to the development of the rooting 
of cuttings are widely scattered through various journals 
and in many cases are merely short paragraphs in a publi¬ 
cation dealing primarily with other problems such as the 
"avena test", the mechanism of the production and of the 
action of auxins and stimulation of cambial activity. 

This being the case, the author does not claim to have 
exhaustively searched such literature but feels sure that 
the more important papers dealing with the given problem 
have been consulted. 

Let us begin from the beginning of the field of 
organogeny and connect what has already been done and 
studied and what are the problems at issue. Any investi¬ 
gator looks to the future as much as to the past. From 
time immemorial, thinking men always tried to explain why 
isolated pieces, twigs and leaves of many plants had re¬ 
generated and become independent individuals. 1'his was 
an everyday phenomenon. What were the factors which set 
up regeneration and determined the kinds or organs and 
the manner of their formation? The physiologists of the 
day working with Bryophyllum crenatum whose detached 



















-

leaves develop roots and shoots, postulated the existence 
of "anlagen" (13). Later on, the investigators discarded 
the old view and hypothecated the correlation phenomenon. 
Duhamel (54) explained this by assuming two saps, one 
moving upward, the other downward from the leaves to the 
roots. Now if this downward stream were intercepted by 
any operation or any means, it caused callus formation and 
then from it root formation. 

Sachs (32) laid great emphasis on the "special 
substances" theory. He postulated the existence of two 
different "stuffs," one heavier root-forming going down¬ 
ward, the other lighter stem-forming going upward. He 
called these two different actuating agencies as "Wuchsstoffe", 
the nutritive stimuli. 

Goebel (13) rejected the view of energizing 
specific substances but placed emphasis on the nutritional 
factors and enunciated his theory of "attraction centres." 

He maintains that correlation, acceleration or inhibition 
phenomena of organs have a nutritional basis and are not 
a result of "internal secretion." 

However, it was Loeb (26) who, working with the 
leaves of Bryophyllum calycinum , again stressed the theory 
of hormones. He suggested that a hormone plays a great 
part in the rooting of cuttings. The apical upper leaves 
on the horizontally laid stem sections, manufacture hor¬ 
mones which move downward through the cortex and accumu-

late at the lower side which then grows longer than the 
upper ana which develops roots, ne thus interconnected 
the phenomena of root formation and tropistic curvature 
of the stem-pieces. 

This theory of tropisms played an important 
part in the development of the newest views on growth. 

It has stimulated the investigations of phytohormones 
which under certain conditions, not only affect growth, 
but cell division and determines some morphogenetic 
processes. 

It was left for Went (54) to give the final con¬ 
vincing evidence for the existence of Sachs’ postulated 
"Wuchsstoff w . Went and van der Weij (54) then developed 
an exact technique of quantitative assay of the concent¬ 
rated purified substance. They measured its activity in 
terms of the curvature of Avena coleoptile developed. 

When Went applied the extract from the Papaya leaves mixed 
with agar, to the base of the Acalypha cuttings, more 
numerous roots developed than otherwise. When he removed 
the buds from Pisum seedling stems and then applied auxin 
solution, a very small number of roots developed. He 
established then that the plant hormone which is produced 
by leaves and also by buds, has the power, somehow or 
other, to stimulate stem cuttings to initiate roots. 
Molisch (54) also substantiated that idea. 

The promotion of root formation on cuttings as 
well as on intact plants by auxins, has been studied in

about 85 genera of plants (60) by investigators belonging 
to eleven or more nationalities, (54). Their researches 
which are going to be reviewed, demonstrated that growth 
substances not only hasten rootings of the cuttings of 
ordinary plants, but stimulate those plants which would 
otherwise never strike root and those which would have 
had only a meagre supply of roots. 

Zimmerman and Hitchcock (58) prepared many 
chemical growth substances and compared their effectiveness 
in the initiation of roots on the cuttings of vitis spp.. 
Ilex, Hibiscus, Acer and many others. They used these 
compounds in aqueous solutions on cuttings as well as in 
lanoline paste on the intact plants. Their studies 
pointed out that B-indolylacetic, B-indolylbutyric and 
L-naphthaleneacetic acids are most effective over a wide 
range of concentrations, viz., ten to twenty times when the 
period of treatment varied from 6 to 90 hours. They 
suggested that the different species of plants vary in 
their sensitivity to the different amounts of auxin. 

Cooper (9) working with the Eureka lemon tree, 
Acalypha, Lant&na and Tradescantia, has obtained good 
results. His cuttings, being 5" long with leaves attached, 

developed better and more numerous roots when treated with 
.5 mg./l gm. indolylacetic paste. His results indicated 
that the hormones not only increased rooting with cuttings 
that will not root when untreated but also caused the forma-

tion of roots on leafless lemon and Tradescantia cuttings 
which do not ordinarily form roots. 

In the other paper (10) he pointed out that the 
solution method is more effective than Laibach’s lanoline 
paste method in initiating roots on the cuttings. 

Gocolasvili and Maximov (12) worked with 
Poncirus trifoliate and Citrus Unshiu , the latter does not 
root at all with ordinary methods. The lower parts of the 
cuttings were immersed in an aqueous solution of the 
B-indolylacetic acid (1:1500-—-1:5000) for from one to 
five days. The cuttings were then planted in a mixture 
of equal volumes of sand and peat moss. Much better 
results were obtained in the spring season when the condi¬ 
tions were more favorable than in winter. Their experi¬ 
ments with the trifoliate orange proved to be the most 
successful, about 100$ having rooted within the short time 
of 30-45 days. Moreover, they state that 1:5000 concen¬ 
tration used on cuttings for 24 hours is equal to 1:2500 
for 12 hours and resulted in 100$ rooting. A longer 
period of treatment of both these solutions produced a 
toxic effeet—-cuttings were slower to root and mani¬ 
fested signs of rooting. The cuttings which had not shed 
their leaves, showed a more rapid rooting. 

Trureckaja (46) used Citrus Limonium in addition 
to gooseberry, apple and olive trees, etc. He states that 
the best concentration of heteroauxin for plants appears

to be 10-25 mg. per 100 c.c. of water when the immersion 

period is 48-56 hours. The heteroauxin is very effective 

o 

when the temperature is 28-30 C. 

Cooper and Manton (11) in 1937, got remarkable 
results with Chrysanthemum cuttings. They tested almost 
50 varieties of this plant. The terminal cuttings were 
made about three to three and one-half inches long and 
treated from 3-12 hours in B-indolylbutyric acid with 
a concentration of 1:10000 (100 rag. in one quart of hot 
water). After the treatment, the cuttings were planted 
in sand in the greenhouse. After 25 days, the cuttings 
were examined. Their data showed that the treated cuttings 
produced far more roots per cutting than the untreated 
controls. 

Grace (14) gave us the most important results on 
root stimulation by the application of the three synthetic 
growth substances: L-naphthaleneacetic, B-indolylbutyric 
and B-indolylacetic acids and obtained physiologic curves 
of response to different concentrations. He treated the 
seeds of different varieties with hormone dust (a mixture 
of synthetic growth substance plus a carrier). The advant¬ 
ages of this seed treatment are first, that as the seed 

swells in germination, the adsorbed hormone is made avail¬ 
able gradually, and second, that the danger of overdosage 
is greatly reduced. "When one bushel of wheat seed was 
treated with only one-half ounce of dust mixture (2 p.p.m. 
of indolylacetic and naphthaleneacetic acids), the root length

increased 102%. Similar results were obtained with barley 
and bean roots. 

He also applied the hormone solution, together 
with Hoagland r s nutrient solutions, to growing plants such 
as Tomatoes, Nasturtiums, Salvia and Petunias. As little 
as 1/100 p.p.m. of L-naphtholeneacetic acid and 1/20 p.p.m. 
of B-indolylbutyric acid solutions stimulated the plants 
greatly. 

Some 4000 cuttings, representing seven species, 
have been treated with hormone dust. The lower ends of 
the cuttings were dipped in the dust, the excess shaken 
off and the cuttings planted directly. His results indicated 
a very high degree of stimulation. Even the lower plant 
forms, expecially baker's yeast, were stimulated to a re¬ 
markable extent and gas production was greatly increased. 

The main conclusion which we can draw from Grace's 
experiments is that if the proper concentration of the 
auxin solutions is used according to the sensitivity or 
tolerance of the tissues reacted, there will be no inhibi¬ 
tory effects, as some people claim, but always a stimula¬ 
tory influence on the organs of the plant. 

Grace's experiments suggest many useful ap¬ 
plications of the hormone solution: Wilted lettuce or 
other plants and cut flowers can be made to regain their 
turgor and maintain their freshness over a longer period. 

The response of lower plant forms to the synthetic auxin

solutions, suggest their possible utility in industrial 
processes and fermentation. 

It is appropriate at this place to explain a 
little how root production at the base of a cutting is 
stimulated by the synthetic auxins. 

Snow (quoted in 54) and Went (54) postulated 
the theory of interlocking factors. A long time ago 
Blackman pointed out that growth was controlled by limit¬ 
ing factors. This has been again substantiated by the 
recent discovery of auxin, aneurin, biotin and sugar made 
by Went, Bonner and Warner (55). It is assumed that the 
main deeondary function of auxin is to control or activate 
the movement of (54) or w suck M in (27) the other food 
factors. Bhizocaline (root-forming auxin), or one of 
Went*s calines (52), seems to be synthesized mainly in the 
terminal buds, also to a lesser extent, in the apical 
very young leaves during the process of assimilation by 
some photosynthetic mechanism. On the other hand the shoot 
or apex-forming substances are formed at the base. Those 
root-forming materials normally move downward in the stem 
to cause root formation at the basal node, when we make 
a cutting, we may deplete the rhizocaline supply along with 
the discarded portion of the plant. But when the synthetic 
auxin is again supplied, as it were, though artificial in 
nature, is created. 

It appears from the numerous localized responses 
of the experimental plants that these local growth reactions

involve a co-operative chain of a number of effective and 
essential chemical compounds. Thus auxin seems to act by 
affecting the transport of the other factors so that they 
become accumulated at the point of highest auxin concentra¬ 
tion (54). If one is missing, there can be no growth. 

But now these synthetic active substances are used as sub¬ 
stitutes for the missing links at the base. Then these 
synthetic auxins draw in rhizocaline auxin from the top 
downward to the base where it acts and induces roots. 
Pfeiffer (34) clarifies the situation through her micro¬ 
scopic studies of Cissus-sicyoides roots. Auxin, somehow 
or other stimulates the periclinal divisions in the peri- 
cycle which increase the number of layers lying over the 
xylenv Subsequent divisions, both periclinal and anti¬ 
clinal produce small masses of tissue over the protoxylem 
points. These are the root primordia which come out later¬ 
ally over the surface and appear as roots. 

This explanation may not be true in all cases. 
However, the detailed histological studies of the dicotyle¬ 
donous plants by Hamner (15) as well as monocotyledonous 
plants by Beal (15) will throw more light with reference 
to the root initiation by synthetic auxins. 

This review reveals a very important struggle of 
how the minds of the investigators from the 17th century to 
the present continued to learn more and more about individual 
plants or parts of plants and integrated all the bits of

PRELIMINARY STUDIES 


INTRODUCTION , 

J, Loeb (25, 26, 27,) was the first to suggest 
that leaves on the apical part of a cutting exercise a 
great influence on the development of roots, van der Lek 
(49) pointed out that nodes of a cutting differ in regard 
to the number of "root germs'' and that there is a decrease 
of these rooting germs from the base to the top of a 
branch. That is the reason perhaps why a higher per¬ 
centage of roots developed on the lower parts than on the 
higher, Thus differences arise in rooting capacity of 
the cuttings of the same branch. Went (50) demonstrated 
the existence of the growth-promoting substances, 

Zimmerman and Hitchcock (58) , Cooper (9) and Grace (14) 
have recently discovered that many auxins have the capa¬ 
city of inducing root generation when they are applied 
to the cuttings, 

A good deal of investigational research has been 
done during the last three years on the rooting of hard¬ 
wood as well as softwood cuttings of various herbaceous 
plants and trees and shrubs. But little attention has 
been given to the propagation by cuttings of field crops, 
such as alfalfa, wheat and oats. 

It has been demonstrated that synthetic auxins 
vary to a great extent in their power of eliciting 
responses from the various species of plants. One cannot

apply the same information obtained from experiments on 
one species of plants to others. Moreover, as different 
species of plants differ in their hereditary constitutions, 
it is obvious that they are likely to differ in their 
sensitivities to growth substances. A proper concentration 
for one plant may be an overdosage for another. 

During the present investigation, there were not 
many sources of information as to optimum conditions of 
inducing rooting of leguminous and cereal cuttings. Burk¬ 
holder (4) suggested to the writer that since not much work 
had been done on this line of investigation, one must try 
to feel his own way in the research. Besides, Konings- 
berger (19) pointed out that not very much was known along 
this line of work in his laboratory. 

Accordingly, the following preliminary studies 
were directed toward the discovery of the best method to 
be applied and the most suitable environmental conditions 
to be provided the cuttings. 

The main factors to be considered in the pre¬ 
liminary studies were:- 

1. The stage of growth of the parent plant from 
which the cuttings should be taken. 

2. The proper place for the basal cut; whether 
5 m.m. below the node, just at the node or 
above the node. 

. Suitable synthetic auxins, their proper

concentrations and exact duration of treatment* 

4. Proper rooting medium, whether sand or sand 
plus peat. 

5* Optimum temperature and humidity. 

6. One-node versus two-node cuttings. 

7. Effect of light or absence of light on the 
cuttings when under auxin treatment and when 
in a propagating medium. 

With these points in view, the various trials 
were made and some of their results are presented in this 
section. 

Alfalfa 

Material 

Four Grimm alfalfa plants about two to three 
feet in height were brought in from the field on September 30, 
1937. They were cut back and placed under good greenhouse 
growing conditions. As these plants reached the stage when 
desirable cuttings could be made* about 300 cuttings were 
taken for the preliminary set of experiments. 

±'he synthetic auxins used were: first, L-naph- 
thaleneacetic acid, second, B-indolylbutyric acid and 
third, -b-indolylacetic acid. These auxin compounds will 
afterwards be referred to as acid 1, acid 2 and acid 3, 
respectively. The rooting media were: (1) sand (2) a 
mixture of equal quantities of sand and peat.

Methods 

There were about twenty to thirty stalks on a 
single alfalfa plant. These were cut and placed in a 
wide pan full of water. From them, two-node sections 
called two-node cuttings, were prepared under water to 
avoid any chance of air-bubbles obstructing the passage 
of the transpiration stream. In all these cases, the 
cut was made about 5 mm. below the basal node* All 
cuts were angular in order to expose more surface to the 
contact of hormone solution. One or more leaves, the 
rhizocaline-producing centres, were retained on a second 
upper node of a cutting in one lot, while on another, the 
leaves were removed. The length of the cutting was ap¬ 
proximately 5 * depending upon the length of internode. 

All the cuttings were inspected carefully to see that all 
the basal nodes were uninjured and without leaves. 

Only acids 2 and 3 were used in this case. 

As these indolyl acids were not freely soluble in water, 
it was therefore necessary that stock solutions should 
be prepared by dissolving the given amount of crystals 
(s*y 30 mg.) in a few drops (five 6r six) of 95 % of 
ethylalcohol. First, only 100 c.c. of distilled water 
was added, heated and finally the volume was brought up 
to the desired point (say 500 c.c.) in a measuring flask. 
From this stock solution which Y/as 60 p.p.m., other

lower concentrations were obtained by diluting with dis¬ 
tilled water* Thus any desired concentration could be 
made* A series of dilutions was prepared, ranging from 
300, 200, 150, 100, 50 p.p.m., in separate small beakers 
to ascertain which concentrations were favorable and 
which might have toxic effects. The column of the solu¬ 
tion in the beakers was about 3/4 inch to 1 inch in 
depth. This was considered enough to make contact with 
the basal part of the cutting. 

The cuttings were next transferred from the 
water into beakers containing the test solutions. These 
cuttings were allowed to remain there from five to thirty 
hours with a cloth placed over them to lessen the deterior¬ 
ating effect of the solar rays on the hormone solutions 
in the beakers. 

All the cuttings were planted in moist, sterilized 
sand. About two-thirds of each cutting was submerged in 
the rooting medium under the glass frame. Care was taken 
to spray the cuttings periodically with a fine syringe to 
avoid wilting which is the most detrimental condition for 
the rooting of cuttings. The temperature was maintained 
at approximately 65° by a thermostatic control. Humidity 
(about 70%) was kept under and around the frame. 

Results . 

These cuttings were left in place for at least 
three weeks before they were taken out for examination.

Their general condition was observed from time to time* 
The first important thing observed was that the very 
succulent cuttings were shrivelled and dried up in the 
propagating medium while the more woody and rigid ones 
survived. It was some time before the cuttings struck 
roots and got nutrients from the soil. During that 
helpless period, the cuttings, if very soft, died. The 
5 mm. of stem left on below the basal node of every 
cutting decayed and then became the attractive centre 
for microorganisms, especially the cotton-like larvae 
of Sciara spp. commonly called fungous gnats. 

After about three weeks, all the cuttings 
were picked out one by one from the rooting medium and 
examined as to the percentage of the cuttings success¬ 
fully rooted. 

The cuttings developed only fibrous roots, 
which emerged from the base of the node. Some inter- 
nodes developed roots also. Swellings (papillae) were 
observed on some of them. The roots seemed vigorous but 
were very brittle and very short. 

The results which are recorded in Appendices 
I to V suggest that a concentration of 300 and 200 p.p.m. 

of these two acids appears to have been toxic while the 
lower concentrations were rather stimulating. 

i*he cuttings were best rooted, which were taken, 
not from the very young, tender stems, but from fairly

mature, strong and rigid stems which were better able to 
resist isolation from the parent plant, band appears 
to have been more favorable than the sand plus peat 
mixture, (Appendices I and II) the latter harbouring 
more pathogens than the former. Moreover, acid 2 
appears to have been more effective for the stimulation 
of root primorida than acid 3. Finally, it seemed that 
the lower concentrations, especially of acid 2, with 
longer treatment were most effective. (Appendices 
III and IV). 

To substantiate this and other points, some 
other experiments were conducted. The results are 
tabulated in Appendix V. They indicate that the 50 p.p.m. 
and 30 p.p.m. of the acids 2 and 1 respectively were 
very effective when the treatment time was about 24 
hours. Although the untreated cuttings (controls) also 
developed roots, still it was observed that the treated 
ones showed more numerous and more vigorous roots than 
those of the untreated. The treated cuttings developed 
roots even on internodes. Moreover, it was observed 
that the checks, which happened to have been planted 
in the comparatively darker places under the frame, 
showed a much smaller number of roots than those in 
the light, while the treated cuttings placed in the 
darker positions, developed more roots than those in 
the light. This indicates that the auxin in the treated 
cuttings became inactivated by light whereas natural

auxin in the untreated ones become more stimulating for 
the development of roots. 

One-node cuttings were then made and were 
treated with the most favorable and effective concentra¬ 
tions and were planted in the same sand medium. After 
three weeks, they were examined. Most of them were 
"dampened off* 4 , others died because of no root develop¬ 
ment. 

It is hard to draw any definite conclusion 
from one experiment. However, it appears that the ten¬ 
dency to develop roots is there. The cuttings wilted 
faster than two-node cuttings, because of much less 
supply of food and auxin in their very small lengths. 

borne of the rooted cuttings from the different 
concentrations were photographed as shown in Figure 1. 
This illustrates the fact that different concentrations 
have different stimulating effects.

Observing the abundance of disease spreading 
organisms, it was considered advisable to sterilize the 
frames with a formalin solution (1:100). This was pre¬ 
pared and one gallon of solution for each cubic foot 
of soil was sprayed on and in the frames. The frames 
were tightly closed for 10 days. They were then flushed 
out thoroughly with tap water and kept partly open to 
let the air out. After four more days the new cuttings 
were planted in their statistically randomized positions 
in the frames. Three days after planting, they began 
to wilt and died off, but no more fungous gnats were 
found in the frames. After 24 days, they were examined 
and not a single cutting had developed roots. 

Even after thorough flushing and aeratign, some 
chemical (perhaps paraformaldehyde) left from the 
formaldehyde might have inhibited the root development. 

The conditions of the plants or cuttings 
themselves might be responsible for the failure. Nursery¬ 
men suggest that it is very difficult to induce plant 
growth during this period, December 15 to January 15, 
which is the resting period for all plants, no matter 
how optimum the conditions one may provide around plants.

before in the case of alfalfa. Moreover, some plants 
of the wheat strain "Canus” were also used in these ex¬ 
periments. 

The synthetic auxins used were of the same kind 
as had been used for alfalfa. 

Methods 

The stock solutions of each of the three acids 
were prepared by dissolving 25 mg. of crystals in lc.c. 
of 95% ethylalcohol, adding first only 200 c.c. of dis¬ 
tilled water, heating the mixture and finally bringing 
the volume up to 500 c.c. in a measuring flask. From 
this stock solution of 50 p.p.m., a series of dilutions 
was made. 

The wheat cuttings were prepared in the same 
way as the alfalfa cuttings, They were treated in the 
different concentrations for 16 and 24 hours, and then 
planted in sand. 

Results 

Twenty-five days after planting, the two-node 
cuttings were examined. The results are tabulated and 
shown in Appendix VI, A and B. Due to the small number 
of cuttings used, the results are inconclusive. They 
suggest, however, that the lower concentrations (10 
p.p.m. of acid 3 and 40 p.p.m. of acid 2) stimulated 
root development. 

The one-node cuttings were made only from the 
basal portions of wheat plants. They were treated with

50, 25, 15 and 10 p.p.m. concentrations of L-naphthalene- 
acetic acid for 20 hours to four days. They were then 
planted in sand. The results were negative as shown in 
Appendix VI-B. 

Discussion . 

The one-node cuttings died very rapidly and 
showed no sign of response. The following is suggested 
as a possible explanation for the lack of response by 
this material. 

In these cuttings, there was neither bud nor 
leaf left on the above-ground parts. An axillary bud on 
a cutting, as pointed out before, strongly promotes root 
formation. As there was no bud present on these cuttings 
to form a necessary morphogenetic substance to induce 
roots on the basal node in the soil, they failed to 
develop roots and died. 

It is interesting to note in this connection 
that an apical bud which is a nucleus, as it were, is 
not only the most active rhizocaline-producing centre, 
but also the prolongator of the life of the internode (54). 
Accordingly, it is advisable to use the longer cuttings 
with bud or leaves intact. Moreover, Hammerling^ 
experiments on Acetabularia support the conclusion that 
the regeneration of isolated sections is proportional 
to the size of the isolated piece and therefore, to the 
amount of root forming substance present in the above 
ground buds and young leaves (quoted in 54).

Oata 


Material 

Common Victory oat plants, about one foot in 
height and about three months old, were used for the one- 
node, and two-node cuttings, and their basal node was the 
third node from the base of the oat plant. 

The synthetic auxins used in this case were 
acid 1 and acid 2, the rooting media used were fine 
sterilized sand and water* 

Methods 

The cuttings were made just at the node with 
a sharp knife. Only one cutting could be made from 
these plants. Accordingly, the basal cuttings were used 
in this case. 

The required dilutions were made from the stock 
solutions already prepared. The cuttings were placed in 
the particular concentrations. About 3/4 inch of the 
cutting was submerged in the solution. Treatment time 
varied, ranging from 20 to 72 hours. 

Some of the cuttings were planted on December 
25, 1937 in the sterilized sand in pots and others were 
transferred to beakers containing water. 

Common nutrient solution (Appendix VII) was 
prepared and applied to the water cultures. 

Results 

All cuttings were examined about two weeks after 
planting. The results are summarized in Table I.

In the case of the culture solution tests the 
same acids with similar treatments were used as with 
sand cultures 5 but in this case, all the cuttings developed 
roots except the controls. In the beakers, roots became 
visible after a week. 

In the nutrient solutions, roots developed much 
faster than in sand. Those cuttings which had not developed

roots in sand were transferred to the solution where they 
soon developed roots. Two of the rooted cuttings were 
transplanted into six inch pots containing sterilized 
field soil, while the others were discarded. These two 
plants along with those of alfalfa and wheat are shown 
in Figure 2.

No. 1: Alfalfa shoot 1.5 feet high from a rooted terminal 
cutting, treated with 40 p.p.m. d No. 2 treated with 
acid 2;and No. 3, treated with acid 1, on Victory oat 
plants. The former is .much taller and more vigorous. 

No. 4, treated with acid 2 is a double-headed mature wheat 
plant, two leaves from the parent plant being still present. 
The indications are that synthetic auxins had a stimulating 
effect and that acid 2 is the more effective.

General Conclusions From the Preliminary Studies . 

These preliminary experiments revealed several 
suggestive points. A great deal of useful information was 
obtained which was helpful in laying out further experi¬ 
ments. The main points disclosed are as follows:- 

1. The basal surface of a cutting must be at 
the node. It is apparent that the basipetal polar flow 
of the rhizogenous substance may be interfered with at 
the nodal points, and it seems to accumulate there to 
some extent. If a Rut is made just at the node, there is 
strong likelihood of the rhizocaline reacting at this 
point. 

2. It is fairly clear from the results that 
B-indolylacetic acid is not effective in initiating roots 
while the other two are more stimulatory in this respect. 

3* The wilting of the cuttings is a difficulty. 
It was found necessary to spray the cuttings at least 
three times a day. 

4. Wheat seems to be a very unresponsive 
plant. But Graham and Stewart (54) state that if all the 
interacting factors are controlled, practically any plant 
can be induced to give 90% rooting from stem or leaf 
cuttings. 

5. The two-node cuttings with buds or leaves 
intact give better results than those without them. One- 
node cuttings gave negative results.

Experiment I. 

Methods . 

Grimm alfalfa was the only available material 
at the t ime when the present research was ^to be undertaken. 
It was therefore selected for the investigation. On 
January 3, 1938, five alfalfa plants were dug from a frozen 
field and brought to the greenhouse. They were cut back 
to about one and one-half inches from the crown and trans¬ 
planted into boxes. Soil was firmly packed around the 
roots and from then on watered daily. As the greenhouse 
conditions were very favorable, numerous shoots soon arose 
and started growing very actively. In about three weeks, 
the stems had grown two to two and one-half feet in height.

Up to this time, preliminary studies had indicated 
the proper experimental conditions to provide the tolerance 
of the alfalfa plants to the different concentrations of 
the synthetic auxins and the magnitude of the response to 
be expected. Thus, the writer was fairly well equipped 
for conducting an experiment on alfalfa cuttings* 

The majority of the stems were vigorous and 
in an active state of forced growth. On examination, it 
was discovered that only a small percentage had a large 
pith and were too soft* Most of them had reached a fairly 
mature stage and had small piths and were therefore hard* 
These stems y with buds and leaves, appeared to be in a 
suitable physiological condition as to cellular sensitivity 
and as to the presence of a suitable amount of the mor¬ 
phogenetic substance called rhizocaline. All this indi¬ 
cated that the stems were strong enough to withstand 
"cutting” shocks. 

Of five plants, one was kept apart for a lano- 
line paste experiment while the remaining four were used 
for this cutting experiment* Numbers were given to them. 
Plant number three was not as vigorous nor as tall as 
the others. However, all were ready for cuttings* 

Before describing further the technique of making 
the cuttings, it is now worth while to emphasize the fact 
that there are some implicit differences in every biologi¬ 
cal experimental material. These should be made explicit 
if possible. It is first necessary, therefore, to take

every -variation due to both genetical and environmental 
differences into consideration and to include those 
detectable differences which one can estimate. But there 
are always some variations beyond human control which 
express themselves in the error of an experiment. It 
appears that there might be genetical differences among 
plants aw well as physiological peculiarities among lower 
and upper parts of the same plant, van der Lek (49) 
often emphasized the fact that a number of "root initials'* 
or the rooting capacity of the cuttings varies tremendously 
from the basal parts to the more apical parts of the same 
plant. It was necessary therefore to take two cuttings, 
one from the basal and one from the terminal part of each 
stem. 

Twenty strong, fairly mature stems were selected 
from each plant and were cut above the ground and kept 
separate in four beakers containing tap water. 

To make cuttings from alfalfa stems seems a 
rather simple matter, yet there are a few factors which 
must be considdred. Previous studies have indicated that 
growing buds and young leaves on cuttings are essential 
for the initiation of the adventitious roots. Experiments 
of Zimmerman (59) have also shown that the roots can arise 
from any place on the cutting provided the cortical paren¬ 
chymatous cells are present, whereas shoots arise only 
from the pre-existing buds which must therefore be retained

at the nodes of the cuttings. The preliminary tests have 

suggested that two-node cuttings are preferable to one- 

node cuttings in order to get satisfactory results. 

Coming back to the alfalfa cut stems, there were 

four to five nodes left on each stem after the uppermost 

soft terminal tip was trimmed off. ihe basal cutting 

was made by cutting off the basal attached internodal part 

ojfi the base of the stem. The stems were individually 

taken out from the large beakers and placed in an open 

water 

water pan. The cuttings were made under/to avoid air 
entering the bottom cut ends. A short clean cut was 
made by inserting a sharp knife just at the node and then 
q.uickly slicing off the basal portion on a decided angle 
so as to offer the maximum surface for the rapid absorp¬ 
tion of the solution. A clear sharp cut is necessary 
for rapid healing after the solution is absorbed. As soon 
as the cutting was made, it was quickly placed in the 
beakers containing water. Leaves from the bottom node 
were removed, while the axillary buds were carefully 
retained. But, one or two leaves on the upper second 
node of a cutting were retained. From one half to one 
inch of the internodal portion was retained above the 
tipper node of a cutting, similar operations were performed 
on the terminal cuttings. The length of the cutting was 
between four and six inches, depending largely on the 
length of the internode. By a similar method, forty

two-node cuttin s (twenty basal plus twenty terminal) 
were made from each of the four plants. The cuttings 
from e ach plant were kept separate and treated according 
to the desired concentration of a given synthetic auxin 
for a certain number of hours. All cuttings were care¬ 
fully inspected to see that all the bottom nodes bore 
uninjured buds and the basal cut surface was clean before 
they were placed. The preparation of solutions will be 
considered later. 

The rooting medium was a sterilized medium fine, 
moist sand which provided a complex of conditions. Pos¬ 
sibly a moist hard oontact of the sand particles with the 
cuttings has an added stimulating thigmotropistic influ¬ 
ence upon the initiation of the roots and upon the plant 
growth in general. The sand was about five inches in 
depth in the sterilized wooden flat which was about 
20" by 24% large enough for 160 cuttings. Free 
circulation of air was provided for under the flats. 

The treated cuttings were taken out from the specified 
beakers and the definite labels with the randomized 
numbers^ were attached to them. The numbers had 
previously been randomized on paper. The positions of the 
160 cuttings were accordingly fixed in the flat which was 
divided into four equal portions six inches wide and 
twenty inches long. Then holes about one and one-half 
inches deep were made with a sharp drivel and cuttings 
were inserted into them. When the whole operation was

over, the holes were filled and the sand packed, taking 
c are that the upright cuttings extended to the bottoms of 
the holes and could not easily be pulled out. Then the' 
surface was levelled by watering. The faiirly constant 
temperature of the greenhouse was about 69° F., while 
the relative timidity was about 65%. A. diffused light was 
maintained for 24 hours so that the auxin might not be 
inactivated. After that, the usual greenhouse conditions 
prevailed. They were watered daily with a fine spray 
and sometimes with a fine syringe to avoid any injurious 
pressure on the cuttings. Eare was exercised in not let¬ 
ting the cuttings wilt by frequent syringing to maintain 
the water content of the cuttings. They were left in the 
propagating medium for at least three weeks before removal 
for examination. Their general condition was observed 
from time to time. It seemed to be very satisfactory. 

The results will appear in the following section. 

From the preliminary studies, it appeared that 
acid 1 and acid 2 were the two most effective auxins for 
the initiation of roots on cuttings. Their aqueous solu¬ 
tions were prepared as follows:- 

Twenty-five mg. of acid 1 crystals were put 
in 100 c.c. of water and heated on a gentle flame to dis¬ 
solve them. Raising to the boiling point would not affect 
the chemical. 400 c.c. of hot water were added to the 
solution to make up the required volume of 500 c.c. This 
was 50 p.p.m. stock solution. This was kept in dark brown 
glazed bottles which were placed in the refrigerator to

avoid deterioration. It was found that this solution could 

be kept in this way indefinitely. 

The stock solution of acid 2 was prepared by 

dissolving 25 mg. first in a few drops of 95% ethylal- 

cohol and adding only 100 c.c. distilled water, heating 

1 

to drive off the alcohol and finally bringing the volume 
up to 500 c.c. From this 50 p.p.m. solution, 30 p.p.m. 
dilution was also prepared. This solution deteriorates 
after about two weeks if it is not kept in a fefrigerator. 
The deterioration is indicated by the brown coloration 
of the solution. 

Ten different treatment solutions were prepared 
in ten separate small beakers which were marked with a 
red pencil. This experiment was designed to study the 
effects of the following variable conditions:- 

1. Different plants. 

2. Basal and apical cuttings of the same plant. 

3. Two synthetic auxins? acid 1 and acid 2. 

4. Two concentrations of each acid: 50 p.p.m. 
and 30 p.p.m. 

5. Four replications. 

6. Various interactions among the above factors. 
One hundred and sixty cuttings were tied in 

bundles of four, each of which constituted a unit of 
treatment, and four bundles of each of the four plants 
were placed with their bottom ends in the ten solutions 
to a depth of 3/4 inch to 1 inch. The time of the 
treatment was 30 hours which was considered best from 
1* See H.S. Tayler. A Treatise on Physical Chemistry.

results . 

There are various ways in which plants react 
to treatment. But in this case, only the actual number 
of roots developed on the cuttings was taken as the mea¬ 
sure of response. The actual number of roots was there¬ 
fore counted on each of the 160 cuttings. The data are 
shown in Appendix VIII, while Table II gives a picture of 
the si nificance of the factors involved. Table III shows 
the importance of the interaction of the various responses 
expressed. Figure 3 illustrates the fact that terminal 
cuttings are more stimulated than the oasal ones, especially 
by the acid 2.

The following general conclusions may be drawn: 

1. The two acids show no significant difference when 
bottom cuttings are compared with controls* 

2. L-naphthaleneacetic acid shows no significant difference 
even when the tops are compared with the check, 

3* But, 30 p.p,m. of b-indolylbutyric acid does show a 
significant effect in stimulating the development of 
roots on top cuttings. 

4. The checks themselves show a significant increase in 
roots when top cuttings are used instead of bottmm ones. 

5. Thirty p.p.m. of the L-naphthaleneacetic acid is signi¬ 
ficantly higher in the stimulation of roots than 50 
p.p.m. of the same acid. It appears that this acid 
produces a toxic effect at the higher concentrations 
but ife stimulatory at the lower limits such as 20 p.p.m. 
or 25 p.p.m. This appears to confirm, to a great ex¬ 
tent , Grace*s (14) "Physiological curves” for -the 
three synthetic auxins. The optimum concentration of 
the b-indolylbutyric acid, seems to be about 50 p.p.m. 
This also agrees with Grace*s results, although these 
results do not show good agreement, still there is no 
significant difference between the effect of 30 p.p.m. 
and that of 50 p.p.m. of the acid. Thus it appears 

that the optimum point of second acid for the stimulation 
of roots is about 40 p.p.m.

Experiment II . 

Methods. 

The lanoline paste experiment, the material 
for which was provided by the fifth plaht, as indicated 
above, was carried out in the following manner* Forty mg. 
of each of the three acids were placed in small pyrex 
beakers. A few drops of 95 % of ethylalcohol were poured 
into each of them tb dissolve the crystals. Ten c.c. of 
water were boiled very carefully to drive away the alcohol. 

Twenty grams of lanoline (the same weight as that 
of water) were weighed and placed in three mortars, The 
10 c.c. solution was poured in them. x he beakers were 
rinsed with 10 c.c. more of hot water to make up 20 c.c. 
altogether. Now the mixture was triturated with pestles. 

The preparation turns from a yellowish tinge to a whitish 
coloration. Its concentration now is equal to 20 c.c. water 
plus 40 mg. acid, That is, the solution plus 20 gm. of 
lanoline results in the concentration of 1 mg. of auxin 
per gram of lanoline. Similarly another paste was pre¬ 
pared to obtain 2 mg. per 1 gm. of lanoline. 

The third preparation was prepared rather dif- 
fenently. Three lots of three gm. of lanoline were put 
in three separate small mortars which were placed in a hot 
water pan to melt the lanoline. Then 90 mg. of each of the 
three auxins were put in three different mortars. Pestles 
were used to triturate them. These preparations were 
highly concentrated, being 30 mg. per 1 gm. of lanoline.

On February 27, 1938, the above three lanoline 
pastes were smeared with a tooth pick on different positions 
of the growing sterns of the fifth alfalfa plant, A few 
punctures or longitudinal slits were made with a knife f or 
the easy penetration of the paste* Smearing was repeated 
three times as the paste deteriorated on the plant which was 
exposed to light. 

Results 

^fter 12 days, marked swellings appeared in all 
cases except in controls* These proliferations formed at 
the points of application but 3% of L-naphthaleneacetic 
acid caused proliferation above the point of application. 
This acid 1 seems to be very effective in the lanoline 
paste method. The swelling on plant 3 gave rise to about 
70 roots at one point while others were less marked. Acid 
3 seemed to be very weak in proliferating roots on alfalfa 
plants. These points are well illustrated by Figure 4.

Conclusion : 

About 3% of concentration of L-naphthaleneacetic 
acid seemed to be very stimulating for the development of 
roots on alfalfa nodes and also on internodes, '^wo-node 
or even one-node cuttings can be taken from these rooted 
intact plants and can be easily propagated.

experiment III 


Methods. 

A third experiment with alfalfa was undertaken 
to determine the effect of aneurin on the responses of 
alfalfa cuttings to auxin. The alfalfa cuttings were 
made in the usual way. i’he cut was m&de just at the node 
in each c ase and the cuttings were made only from the apical 
parts of the alfalfa plants which were growing very actively. 
Besides a control, concentrations of 30 p.p.m. and 50 p.p.m. 
from each of two acid stock solutions were prepared. 

Cuttings were tied in bundles of five and transferred to 
the solutions with the basal ends submerged to a depth 
of three quarters of an inch. The treatment period given 
was 24 hours. 

The treated cuttings were -transferred to nutrient 
solutions immediately after the treatment. At the end of 
a week, about half of them from each bundle were transferred 
to the nutrient plus aneurin solution containing 1 mg. per 
litre. In this second transfer, only solution was used 
for the controls. 

Results. 

Figure 5, A definitely shows that B-indolylbutyric 
acid stimulates better root development than L-naphthalene- 
acetic acid. But when a very small quantity of aneurin was 
provided to the auxin treated cuttings, root length greatly 
increased as illustrated by Figure 5, B.

Prom the reaults of these experiments, it appears 
that there is a difference between the stimulating effect 
of L-naphthaleneacetic acid and that of the B-indolylbuty- 
ric acid, but that difference is not statistically signifi¬ 
cant. 

It is fairly clear from Appendix VIII, that, in 
some cases, a larger number of roots was formed by the un¬ 
treated controls. It indicates that auxin was already there 
in excess. Moreover, some cuttings failed to strike roots 
even if the concentration was favorable. 

It was surmised that when some additional factors 
are missing or of limiting quantity, plants would not 
develop roots, as Went et alahave pointed out in a recent 
article (55). It was thought better, therefore, to apply 
the lanoline paste directly to the nodes of the growing 
point so that roots might appear at those particular points 
and to make the cuttings when these latter had sufficiently 
developed. 

Humber 3 in Figure 4 shows a large group of vigor¬ 
ous stout roots far above the point of application. This 
fact throws some light on the movement of the applied auxin. 
Perhaps the transport is, to some extent, acropetal . It is 
hard to explain this result. However, it seems that auxin 
from the paste moved somehow to the transpiration path and 
flowed upward. However, this point is not clear. 

The development of organs is not due to one 
specific factor, but it is the resultant of the whole com¬ 
plex interlocking system of limiting factors. "The activity

of any one factor* says Went (54), "is zero". Auxin, of 
course, causes root initiation but then other factors 
contribute their share of stimuli in the development of 
roots. Figure 5 shows the extent to which root length is 
increased by the presence of aneurin in the auxin solutions. 

Finally, plants which were grown from the rooted 
cuttings transplanted in the field soil were darker green 
and more vigorous than those transplanted in sand and pro¬ 
vided with sufficient nutrient solution.

WHEAT 


EXPERIMENT I: 

Method: 

The Red Bobs variety of wheat used in this invest¬ 
igation is one of the standard varieties of wheat grown in 
Alberta. 

Ten plump seeds were planted in each of three six 
inch pots, at five successive ten-day intervals, from October 
2 to November 11, 1937. It was pointed out before that the 
reactivity of the tissues is a very essential factor to be 
taken into consideration in any auxin investigation. Keep¬ 
ing that point in mind, five batches of plants were grown on 
five different days in order to get experimental material 
having five different stages of growth, that is, five differ¬ 
ent physiological ages and their quantitative degrees of 
sensitivity. After emergence the seedlings were thinned to 
six per pot. 

On January 20, when the cuttings were made, the 
first planting had reached the milk stage, the last two had 
not headed and the other three were at intermediate stages. 
Obviously, the plants differed in the lengths of the inter¬ 
nodes. The first three plantings had four nodes above ground 
sufficiently widely spaced on each of the culms to make 
suitable cuttings. Whereas in the case of the plants which 
had not headed the internodes where so closely spaced that 
it was found necessary to include the tillering crown in the 
basal cuttings.

After first detaching the culms from the plants, 
the cuttings were made under water with a sharp knife so 
as to insure a clean and oblique severance at the node. 
Unfortunately, there was no leaf left on the upper node of 
the basal cuttings but one trimmed leaf was left on the 
apical ones. As soon as the cuttings were prepared they 
were placed in the water beaker; they ranged from four to 
eight inches in length. 

As there were a few tillers developed on the 
crown nodes, these were cut off and kept separate from the 
cuttings. New tillers were used in another experiment in 
ofder to compare their root development with that of the 
cuttings. 

Solutions of 30 p.p,m, and 50 p,p.m, of each of 
the acids were prepared from the stock solutions left over 
from the alfalfa experiments. Ten different concentrations 
were used in this experiment. Cuttings were tied in bundles 
of three, which was the unit of treatment, and were placed 
with their basal ends in the solutions to a depth of three- 
quarters of an inch to one inch. 1‘he time of treatment was 

24 hours. 

Steam sterilized sand, five inches deep in a flat, 

25 inches by 30 inches, was thoroughly moistened and firmly 
packed, ihe appropriate labels marked with randomised numbers 
were attached to the 150 cuttings which were immediately 
planted in their proper places in three separate, longi¬ 
tudinal portions of the flat to a depth of about two inches. 

Provision was made for the free circulation of air beneath

the flat. After planting, the cuttings were sprayed with 
water. While light was obstructed to some extent, by a 
board in order to inhibit the inactivating effect of cer¬ 
tain solar rays on the auxin solution (54), this precau¬ 
tion was observed only for 24 hours. The cuttings were 
sprayed three times daily. Temperature was kept at 65 - 
70° F. on the surface of the sand, but at the bottom of 
the cutting in the sand, the temperature was about 60° F., 
which was rather low for the stimulation of the root 
development on the basal cuts (60). 

Results 

The previous studies indicated that the synthetic 
auxins have a stimulating effect on the rooting of wheat 
cuttings. Accordingly, the wheat cuttings experiment was 
laid out with a view to statistical treatment of the data. 
Both parts, bottom and top, were included in this experi¬ 
ment. Only three cuttings were used as a treatment unit. 
Twenty-nine days after planting in the rooting medium, 
the cuttings were examined. The following data were 
obtained:-

Conclusion 

Although this table shows that no cutting developed 
more than two roots; still it suggests that the synthetic 
auxin solution has a stimulating effect on the root develop¬ 
ment especially on the basal cuttings. In the pre-heading 
stages of plant growth, the immature, soft plants showed no 
roots whatever. Fifty p.p.m. of the indolylbutyric acid 
seemed to be more effective in inducing roots than 50 p.p.m. 
of the other acid. 

This experiment did not show as definite results 
as the alfalfa experiments did. The reason perhaps was that 
many of the cuttings dried out in the propagating medium as 
they were slow in developing roots. It may be that the 
stored-up food in the cuttings was insufficient. Possibly 
low humidity had something to do with it. Moreover, perhaps 
the auxin solution became inactivated at the cut surface 
of the wheat cuttings by some catalytic factors set free in 
the cutting operation and it might have played a part in 
causing the poor root growth (54). Lower temperature at 
the base of the cutting than at the upper, might have had 
something to do with the inactivity of the auxin. There 
might have been someoother supplementary factors which 
played their part in initiating or inhibiting root develop¬ 
ments in the cuttings.

of the pastes were 1 mg*, 2 mg. and 30 mg. per 1 gm. of 
lanoline. These three pastes were smeared with tooth picks 
on different parts of wheat plants which were obtained from 
fellow investigators who were, at the time, working on other 
wheat projects. The temperature in the greenhouse was 
69°F., while the humidity was rather low, about 40%• Old 
lanoline paste was removed from the culms and new dabs 
applied on three different pocasions.. 

Result : 

The results were negative in this case. There was 
only one case where a definite swelling occurred, whereas 
others showed only brownish spots at the point of application. 
Conclusion: 

It is very likely that these concentrations were 
not favorable for root development on the wheat plants, or 
it may be that those plants at that stage were not responsive 
to these pastes. 

Experiment III : 

Method: 

Tillers were cut off from the wheat plants. The 
long leaves were trimmed off and the whole tiller was used 
as a cutting. 

Three dilutions, 10, 15, 20 p.p.m. were made from 
the stock solutions of the same synthetic auxins already 
prepared. Treatment periods were 24 and 48 hours. Tillers 
were tied in bundles of four, which formed a unit of treatment. 
Thus seven bundles of fours were used in each acid, making 
56 tillers in all. 

All the tillers were taken out of the solutions at

the same time and labels with randomized numbers were attached. 
The tillers were then planted on January 21, 1938, in four 
inches of sterilized sand, in a flat 14 inches by 20 inches. 
Free air circulation was provided below the flat. The sand 
was levelled by thorough watering. Later the tillers were 
sprayed as in previous experiments. Figure $ , A and B 
illustrate the stimulating effect of both of the acids. 

It also suggests that B-indolylbutyric acid is more effective 
than the other. Figure 7 also suggests that wheat tillers

Conclusion: 


Although Table VI does not show very striking 
results, it suggests that tillers are more easily stimulated 
to the development of roots than cuttings* It appears that 
possibly the tillers contain more food as well as more 
morphogenetic substance which induces roots than do the 
cuttings, and that they can withstand more adverse conditions. 

Comparatively speaking, roots developed on B, 

Figure 6, shoots are sturdier and longer than on A, Figure 6,

and B-indolylacetic acid (B) on the root develop¬

A root developed from the third node, stimulation

but it does not show in the photograph. 

No. 4: treated with 30 p.p.ra. and only two cuttings rooted. 

No. 5: control, one cutting rooted. Only three roots developed 
and less secondary rootlets. The rest - 3 - died off. 
Conclusion : 

This comparison illustrates that the auxins do 
stimulate the root system of wheat plants. Although controls 
showed only 3 roots and fewer secondary rootlets, yet treated 
tillers showed more roots with more numerous rootlets, and 
developed more vigorous root systems. 

Experiment IV . 

Method : 

According to the suggestion made by Went (54) as 
to the relative importance of aneurin application, a new 
experiment was conducted on March 16, 1938. Basal cuttings, 
from the second node above ground, were made from mature 
culms of wheat plants. Eive cuttings in a bundle constituted 
the unit of treatment. 

Dilutions of 15 p.p.ra. and 30 p.p.ra. were made from 
the stock solutions of the L-naphthaleneacetic and B-indolyl- 
butyric acids respectively. About 10 c.c. of these solutions

were used in glass tubes. The cuttings were placed with 
their basal ends in the solutions and treatment was continued 
for 30 hours. 

The cuttings were then taken from the tubes and 
transferred to new tubes containing 10 c.c. of 1 mg. per litre 
aneurin solution. They were left here for five days and then 
nutrient solution was added to these as well as to the con¬ 
trols. 

Results : 

Twenty-five days after planting, the cuttings were 
examined. Observations suggested that when 30 p.p.m. of 
B-indolylbutyric acid was supplemented with aneurin, root 
initiation was greatly stimulated as shown in Table VII. 

It was also observed that aneurin induced lengthening of the 
roots to a great extent.

When some factors are missing from the chain of essential factors, 
roots may not develop. Another very important observation was 
made: B-indolylbutyric acid is far more effective in inducing 
root growth than the other acid, when it is supplemented with 
aneurin.

Oats 


Experiment I, 

Method * 

Victory is a standard variety of oats, extensively, 
grown in Alberta. It was therefore considered advisable to 
use this type for a test. 

Strong, healthy looking seeds were planted in each 
of three six-inch pots, st five successive ten-day inter¬ 
vals from October 2nd to November 11th, 1937. A 'hese plantings 
were expected to yield sufficient material at each of five 
differential physiological growth stages. Nearly all the 
seeds germinated within eight days. These were thinned to 
six plants per pot. 

As the last two stages were fhr behind the three 
earlier stages, attempts to make cuttings were delayed. However, 
when all were sufficiently mature, cuttings were taken from 
them on January 20th, 1938. 

The cuttings were made in the same way as had been 
done in the previous cases of wheat and tied up in bundles 
of three to make a unit of treatment. Two dilutions, 20 
p.p.m. and 50 p.p*m. were prepared from the -stock solutions 
of each of the two acids mentioned in the previous experiments. 
Basal and apical cuttings were placed, at a depth of one inch 
in each of these :four concentrations making eight treatments; 

one terminal and one basal cutting were also used as controls 
for each stage totalling ten treatments for 50 cuttings for 
each of the three replicates—-------a total of 150 cuttings

in all. The treatment continued for 24 hours, temperature 
being 66° F. 

After this treatment, randomized positions were 
fixed for each cutting in a flat, 25 inches by 30 inches, 
containing 5 inches of sterilized sand. The holes were 
drivelled and the treated cuttings were planted in them 
to a depth of about two inches, taking care that their 
basal ends touched the sand which had been firmly packed 
around them. The surface was levelled by watering and a 
canvas was placed over them to obstruct light for two 
days. 

Results : 

The planted cuttings were pulled up and examined 
after about a month. It was observed that the cuttings of 
the fairly mature oat plants seemed to respond to the auxin 
treatment more readily than those of wheat plants. The data 
derived are shown in Table VIII and stimulation is illustrated 
on Figure 8, Page 69.

Conclusions 

These results indicate that the effect of the auxins 
is to increase the number of roots when 20 p.p.m. of either of 
the two acids sare used. The controls also produce a high per¬ 
centage of roots. 

On the whole this experiment suggests one possibility, 
viz. that the second node above ground is capable of giving 

















: ■ ■ ■ ' - ' 













• * 


. 

















rise to roots which may be increased by the application of 
auxins. It is not advisable to draw any definite conclusion 
from one experiment with the limited number of cuttings used. 
However, there appears to have been a tendency toward a higher 
percentage of cuttings producing roots when the lower concen¬ 
trations of L-naphthaleneacetic acid were used. Twenty-four 
hour treatment seemed to be more favorable than other longer 
treatments. 

Experiment II 

Method 

The same method was used as Expt. II with wheat plants, 

Results 

The results were negative. 

Conclusion 

Auxin failed to elicit any response from these 
plants probably because they were too advanced before beginning 
treatment. 

Experiment III 

Method 

Tillers were collected from the oat plants and were 
used for Experiment III. There were 56 tillers, with long 
leaves trimmed off to decrease transpiration and thus to lessen 
the possibility of wilting. The same treatment was administered 
to these tillers as was given to the wheat in Experiment III. 

When the tillers were taken out of the solutions, the labels 
with randomized numbers were attached to them. They were 
placed in their respective positions and firmly planted in

the sand. Diffused light was allowed for two days. 

Results : 

Tillers were examined after about a month. They 
showed a definite response to the treatments as shown by 
Figure 9. "A" shoots showed a more vigorous root-system than 

those of "B". It appears that B-indolylbutyric acid is rather 
more conducive to increase of root lengths than is the other 
acid. The results obtained are shown in Table IX.

Conclusion : 

From the results, it appears that oat tillers respond 
better than cuttings to the auxin treatment. L-naphthalene- 
acetic acid is more stimulating than B-indolylbutyric acid in 
root development. Moreover, L-naphthaleneacetic acid appears 
to have a quicker action than the latter. The oat

Discussion 


If the evidence presented in the foregoing experi¬ 
ments is collected, there appear^ to be a few important 
points which should be stressed and considered in their 
relations to other known facts. 

Table III definitely indicates that alfalfa is 
very sensitive to auxins, especially the terminal cuttings 
which seem either to have more root-primordia, already 
formed, or to be more strongly stimulated to produce new 
primordia than the basal cuttings. But van der Lek (49) 
suggests that there are more "root germs" in the lower nodes 
than in the upper ones. However, this seems not to be true 
in the case of alfalfa stems. Even the apical controls 
produce more roots than the basal one s. It is perhaps due 
to the fact that the apical cuttings, being younger and 
nearer to the auxin forming centres, get more rhizogenous 
substance than the basal ones. Moreover, it may be possible 
that in some way, auxin becomes more readily inactivated 
in the older basal cuttings than in the younger upper 
cuttings. 

Two-node cuttings with leaves intact developed 
good roots, whereas one-node cuttings having no leaves 
showed no signs of roots whatever. This indicates that 
leaves do make root-forming substances which flow downward.

and 50 p.p.m. is capable of obstructing the normal basipetal 
movement of the rhizocaline which seems to be controlled 
above the point of auxin application. There it perhaps 
accumulates and stimulates root formation. Moreover, a bud 
at the upper node of a cutting, is very necessary for the 
production of roots. Perhaps this was the reason that bud¬ 
less one-node cuttings and internodes of these plants 
failed to root. This was also well substantiated by 
Molisch (qubted in 54). 

All these results indicate the possibility of 
asexually reproducing selected alfalfa plants, and, to 
some extent, wheat and oats. The method suggested also 
makes possible the multiplication of populations without 
genetic alteration. 

As to cereals, Table I and VII definitely show 
that oats and wheat cuttings do respond to the auxin 
treatments. These results suggest two very significant 
points. In dicotyledonous plants, the histogens of ad¬ 
ventitious roots generally arise from the pericycle. 
but in wheat and oats neither a cambium is present to 
initiate callus formation (21) nor are clearly observable 
pericycle cells which the auxins usually stimulate to 
form, first root initials, then root primordia, and fin¬ 
ally, roots (54). Probably the parenchymatous cells 
which are lying just outside the region of vascular 
bundles, may be stimulated to form roots (15). It may 
be that these auxins actually induce some cells of the

bundle sheath to produce root primordia (5). However, 
this whole mechanism is not clear as yet. The second 
suggestion is that as the axillary buds and embryonic 
leaves are not present on these cuttings, it is very diff¬ 
icult for them to produce enough aneurin and rhizocaline, 
which seem to be necessary complements for root growth. 
When a minute quantity (l mg. per litre) of aneurin had 
been applied to the auxin treated wheat cuttings, roots 
did develop as shown in Table VII. In the future it will 
not be difficult to produce roots when rhizocaline (one 
of calines) will have been isolated and supplied to the 
cuttings at the same time as the auxin treatment is given 
(52, 53). 

These experiments on cereals were preliminary in 
nature. On the whole those on wheat and oats were not 
satisfactory to the same extent as those on alfalfa, still 
a possible way has been pointed out by which to overcome 
the difficulty in these crop plants. 

One observation of great practical importance 
and probable significance was made during the examination 
of the rooted cuttings of alfalfa, viz., that the treated 
cuttings developed larger nodules than the untreated ones. 
Tliat was perhaps due to the fact that the added auxin 
accelerated the developing nodules which had been already 
initiated, perhaps by indolylacetic acid secreted by 
Khizobium leguminosarum (44). There seems to be some

possibility of increasing nitrogen-fixation by a suitable 
application of this auxin treatment and thus to obtain 
larger yields of alfalfa crop. 

It seems proper to draw attention to the differences 
between natural roots and roots induced by the synthetic 
auxins. Auxin-stimulated cuttings have only a fibrous root 
system; roots are often developed on internodes; they are 
more numerous and more vigorous, though shorter. They have 
a more rapid development Out tend to be very brittle in com¬ 
parison to the flexible root system of naturally grown 
plants. 

In all these experiments, one fact stands out very 
strikingly, viz., that about 30 p.p.m. of L-naphthaleneacetic 
acid and 50 p.p.m. of h-indolylbutyric acid seem to be the 
optimum concentrations for root developments on the clones 
of these plants. This agrees with Grace’s physiologic 
curves very closely to his results. 

ihis investigation undoubtedly solves some prob¬ 
lems but raises many more. First of all, it is not un¬ 
proved now that auxin plays its main function in cell elong¬ 
ation. But it is still vague whether these synthetic 
auxins themselves are instrumental in bringing about root 
induction in cuttings or whether they simply indirectly 
activate or energize some other factors and substances 
which then stimulate roots. Another extremely difficult 
point which needs clarification is how and why the same 
synthetic auxins induce the production of adventitious

roots, yet inhibit their size. Why these auxin-produced 
roots are stout and sturdy while natural normal controls 
are thin and frail. It is hard to say whether the gene 
complex equipment is under the influence of these growth- 
hormones or vice versa. Is there any mechanism by which 
auxin can connect the sensitivity of the plant with the 
environmental conditions? These and many more fundamental 
questions strongly suggest how little we know of actual 
processes of plant growth and this mere fact throws a 
challenge to investigators to search for more facts. 
Accordingly, it necessitates opening up wider fields for 


research

General Summary and Conclusions 


The experiments showed the following facts:- 

1. The following environmental conditions were found to be 
satisfactory r- 

(a) Atmosphere humidity - 70%. 

(b) Temperature - in the soil - 75° F. 

in the air - 70° F. 

(c) Diffuse light for first 24 hours. 

(d) Sand rather than mixture of peat and sand. 

(e) Frequent spraying - at least three times a day. 

2. The following points are to be considered when making cuttings; 

(a) ft cut should be clear, sharp and angular at 
the basal node of a cutting. 

(b) Cutting should be made at the node to include 
the whole basal node where the root-forming 
substances seem to accumulate to some extent. 

(c) Cuttings should have two nodes and should be 
four to eight inches in length. One-node 
cuttings generally die off fairly early because 
of their fast wilting before the roots pro¬ 
liferate and are able to absorb nutrients to 
maintain themselves. 

(d) Leaves should be retained on the second upper 
node of a cutting. 

( e ) Apical rather than basal cutting of alfalfa 
is preferable, whereas the reverse for wheat

and oats is true. 

(f) Parent plant should be mature and woody rather 
than pithy and soft. 

Cereal tillers, small or large, are preferable 
to cuttings, since they have leaves and are com¬ 
paratively longer. 

3. The synthetic auxins used produced response in the 
following order of their effectiveness:- 
(a) b-indolylbutyric acid:- 

dilution 45 - 50 p.p.m. 

" 50 p.p.m. 

" 15 p.p.m. 

(b| L-Naphthaleneacetic acid:- 
dilution 20 - 30 p.p.m. 
n 10 p.p.m. 

M 10 - 15 p.p.m. 

(c) B-Indolylacetic acid:- 

Not very effective for 
hence not used much. 

Note: It should be remembered that within limits the lower 
the concentrations used and the longer duration of treatment, 
the more effective the response will result. Generally 
speaking, the treatment time for time above concentrations 
should be 24 hours.

4* The following points are to be considered when (i) the 
lanoline-paste and iii) auxin-aneurin methods are used:- 

(i) (a) L-Naphthaleneacetic acid 30 mg. per 1 

gram of melted lanoline for developing 
roots directly on alfalfa plant. 

(b) B-Indolylbutyric acid - 30 mg. per 1 
gram of melted lanoline for root initia¬ 
tion on alfalfa plants. 

(c) B-Indolylacetic acid being least effective. 

(ii) One mg. of aneurin per one litre of water to 
be used directly after the application of 

30 p.p.m. of B-indolylbutyric acid on wheat 
cuttings. 

Note: When these plants fail to produce roots by the 

aqueous solution method, attempts should be made to stimulate 
cuttings to initiate roots by means of the two following 
methods: 

(i) Lanoline-paste method - to obtain roots on 
the plant stems before cuttings are made. 

(ii) Auxin-aneurin method - to supply the cuttings 
with some substitute for a missing factor. 

5. All the experiments suggest that growth is a combined 
expression of all the various integrated factors, 
processes and functions. A complex interlocking system 
of limiting factors appears to be at a basis of root 
production. Aneurin seems to be more limiting in 
root elongation than others.
