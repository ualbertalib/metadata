A LOWER MICROFAUNA OF TEE LOON RIVER FORMATION, 
NORTHERN ALBERTA. 


CHAPTER I 


INTRODUCTION 


PREFACE 


For many years the entire Loon River formation has 
been correlated to the west with the Moosebar shale and 
to the east with the Clearwater shale. This correlation 
was basea on megafossils, lithologic similarity and 
stratigraphic position. Recently a microfauna from the 
basal Moosebar shale was collected by C.R. Stelck. The 
discovery of a similar fauna in 'the Loon River formation 
demands a revision of this correlation, and indicates 
that the Loon River and Moosebar formations are not 
stratigraphically co-extensive. 

The purpose of this thesis is to establish a 
succession of the microfaunas of the Loon River shale and 
to add to the knowledge of the Lower Cretaceous foraminifera 
of Western Canada. This microfaunal study of the Loon 
River formation, which outcrops in north-central Alberta 
along the Peace River, deals principally with foraminifera, 
picked from shale samples of surface outcrops. Part of 
the succession of microfaunal assemblages in the Loon 
River is here established, and morphologic types are 
described and illustrated. Correlation of one of the 
upper faunal zones of the Loon River formation with a 
basal zone of the Moosebar formation suggests that the 
lower part of the Loon River formation correlates with

the upper part of the G-ething formation. Therefore, 
most of the microfaunas presented here are lower in 
the Cretaceous section than any previously dated marine 
microfauna of Western Canada. 

fflUL-J WORK 

Shale samples of the Loon River formation used in 
this microfaunal study were collected by a Pacific 
Petroleums surface party, in the field season of 1950. 
This party consisted of P.E. Cote, chief, W. Elder, 

G-. Dann, and J. Binnie, assistants. Samples used here 
were collected from thirty-one different localities, 
from 15 miles below the mouth of’ the Notikewin River to 
Fort Vermilion, on the Peace River. 

Samples were collected by means of a discontinuous 
sampling procedure. The outcrop was trenched, a shallow 
pit was dug at each sampling point and a six-inch section 
was sampled. Samples were hand-picked to remove iron¬ 
stone and hard, sandy material. Samples were taken 
customarily with a stratigraphic interval of 5 feet 
between collected beds. Maximum stratigraphic interval 
between samples, on individual outcrops, seldom exceeded 
10 feet. Samples were placed in postal-type cotton bags 
and shipped to the Pacific Petroleums warehouse in 
Edmonton. From there a portion of each sample was sent 
to the G-eological Department, University of Alberta.

samples, picking microfossils and mounting microfossils 
is similar to that outlined by Nielsen (ref. 21)• 

Study of the microfauna indicated certain morphologic 
types suitable for illustrating and description. One 
specimen of each morphologic type is chosen as a 
hypotype and mounted in a single cell slide. Three other 
specimens of similar morphologic type as the hypotype 
are chosen as paratypes and mounted with the hypotype. 

These types are filed in the University of Alberta 
Museum. 

Photo-micrographs of all hypotypes were taken using 
Superpan Press film, a Leitz Wetzlar M4B camera and a 
Leitz Wetzlar No. 394635 microscope. Magnifications of 
60x, 65x, BOx.and 85x were used. The writer developed 
the negatives utilizing developing equipment and dark¬ 
room facilities in the Department of Geology, University 
of Alberta. Prints of the negatives were made by a commer¬ 
cial firm, Silvertone. Certain features which were not 
well defined in the original print are accentuated by 
retouching of the photographs. The retouched photographs 
of the fossils are cut out and mounted on a black mat 
background. The photographs are again retouched and the 
plate was then photographed,producing the illustrated 
plate in this thesis. The photographing of the plate 
was done by Bell, a commercial firm.

CHAPTER 11 

THE LOON RIVER FORMATION 


INTRODUCTION 

The Loon River formation is a marine shale formation 
within the Cretaceous Fort St. John group of Vie stern 
Canada. The type section of the Loon River formation 
outcrops along the Wabiskaw (Loon) River, Alberta, where 
it was first recognized by McConnell in 1889. Micro- 
faunal suites described in this thesis are from the 
outcrops of the Loon River formation on the Peace River, 
west of the type locality. 

For the purpose of this thesis the Loon River form¬ 
ation is defined by geographical position rather than 
by correlation. The term "Loon River formation" refers 
to strata underlying the lowermost member of the Peace 
river formation, and overlying the Devonian limestones, 
outcropping along the Peace River from 15 miles below 
the mouth of the Notikewin River downstream to Vermilion 
Chutes, and along the lower Wabiskaw (Loon) River. 

Strata of this formation, outcropping in the area 
under consideration, are recognized as marine shales, 
locally silty, containing discontinuous limestone and 
ironstone concretions. The Loon River formation carries 
a megafauna culminated by the ammonite genera Lemurocera s 
and Beudanticeras , with Lemuroceras occurring higher 
stratigraphieally into the basal (Monias) member of the 
Peace River formation. 

The Loon River formation is considered the lowest 
formation of the Fort St. John group by McLearn. For

this thesis the Loon River shales are assigned a thickness 
of 1,100 feet. The microfauna discussed in this thesis 
comes from the middle portion of the Loon River formation 
only, from about 200 feet below the top to about 400 feet 
above the base (i.e. 500 feet of shale). 

The information on the Loon River formation concern¬ 
ing the description, lithology, thickness, extent and 
megafauna was obtained from published and unpublished 
reports by other workers. 

YARLY LORIf 

A geological exploration was carried out by R.G. 
McConnell covering the Peace River area in 1888. From 
this work some new formation names were introduced, 
including the Loon River shales. In his report {ref. 13 ) 
on this area he illustrated the succession of the various 
divisions by the following table of formations: 

Laramie Wapiti River sandstones 

Montana Foxhill sandstone 

Smoky River shales 
Dunvegan sandstone 

Colorado Fort St. John shales 

Peace River sandstones 
Loon River shales 

Thus, McConnell first introduced the term Loon River 
formation for the shales outcropping along the lower 
part of the Wabiskaw 7 (Loon) River, and the Peace River. 

He delimited the upper boundary of the Loon River shales 
as the "alternating" contact with the series of sandstone 
and shales which he named the Peace River sandstone.

Although the contact was not seen, he stated that the 
Loon River formation appears to rest directly on the 
Devonian limestones. 

McConnell described the Loon River formation as follows 
Tt The Loon River shales, the lowest division of the Colorado 
or Peace River, consist of about 400 feet of dark grayish 
to nearly black, soft shales, holding calcareous and iron- 
stone nodules, interstratified with occasional bed of 

sandstone, impure limestone, and ironstone. The 

Loon River shales appear in descending Peace River, about 
twenty miles above Battle River, and are exposed on the 
banks of the valley nearly all the way down to the 
Vermilion Palls. The j also ocmr on the lower part of 
the Loon River, and on the Red River. They alternate above 
with the Peace River sandstone, and below appear to rest 
directly on the Devonian limestones, although the contact 
was nowhere seen”. 

Later geological work of importance in the Peace River 
area was carried out by F.E. McLearn. Geological invest¬ 
igation by means of a series of field trips to the area 
in 1917, 1918, 1920 and 1922 (ref.16) resulted in pub- 
lication of the table of formations in Figure 1 on 
the following page.

McLearn describes the Loon River formation as follows: 
(ref. 15 ): f *The Loon River shales consist of dark blue 
to dark grey, friable weathering shales with a few rounded 
or flattened ironstone concretions. To the south where 
they are penetrated by the wells of the Peace River Oil 
Company they are more arenaceous, particularly near the 
base. Both well No. 1 and No. 2 show a number of smaller 
beds of sandstone in the upper part of the formation, 
which are not present in the exposures donstream. Along 
the upper contact with the Peace River sandstones there 
is much replacement laterally of sandstone by shale, so 
that the contact rises stratigraphically northward. As 
exposed on the river in the north the even bedding and 
marine fossils point to a marine origin. It is possible, 
however that the thick sandstones near the base of the

formation in the south may be of non-marine origin. At 
the great horseshoe bend the thickness is 400 feet (est¬ 
imated) and to the south in the oil wells 1,100 feet I 

In 1929 R. L• Rutherford made a survey of the under¬ 
ground water resources of the Peace River area. In con¬ 
junction with this survey, strata outcropping in the area 
were geologically investigated. Terminology of the 
Cretaceous section in the Peace River area used by 
Rutherford is illustrated by the following table of form¬ 
ations: 

Upper Smoky River shale 

Bad Heart sandstone 

Lower Smoky River shale 

Dunvegan formation 

St. John formation 

Peace River formation 

Loon River formation (at depth) 

In 1931 L. S. Russell (ref. 23) made a survey of a 
portion of the eastern Peace River area. A preliminary 
map of the area (Bison Lake - Sexsmith) was published, 
although it was not accompanied by a report. The Lower 
Cretaceous terminology used on the map was: 

Fort St. John formation 
Peace River formation 
Loon River formation 

In 1944 McLearn (ref. 13) defined the Fort St. John 


group of the eastern part of the Peace River area as 
including the "marine shale of the Loon River, the mostly

marine shales and sandstones of the Peace River formation, 
and the marine shales of the Shaftesbury formation". 

Thus McConnell's "Colorado" now becomes the Fort St. 

John group. 

LITHOLOGY 

In outcrops along the Peace River the Loon River form¬ 
ation consists of dark grey to black, friable, non- 
calcareous, locally silty shales that contain numerous 
discontinuous limestone and ironstone nodules or con¬ 
cretions. These shales become closely banded with the 
thin ironstone layers near the base. 

The lithology of the Loon River formation is fairly 
uniform. Minute particles of carbonaceous material 
frequently are disseminated through the formation. Micro¬ 
flakes of white and black mica are also common. A platy 
cleavage is often present in the shales due to fine lam¬ 
ination of the shale with silt. The silt is rarely more 
than one-quarter of an inch thick, although locally it 
may come in coarser laminae. The presence of glauconite 
was observed, but locally and sparsely distributed. 

Although non-calcareous these dark shales do contain 
limestone and ironstone concretionary layers and bands 
scattered throughout. These layers do not lend them¬ 
selves readily to correlation from exposure to exposure. 

The Loon River shales are considered by some workers 
to be near shore deposits. The writer considers that 
the Loon River formation is a basin deposit in the 
shallow to deep neritic environment.

To the north of Peace River town where the Loon River 
shale is penetrated by the wells of the Peace River Oil 
Company the formation becomes more arenaceous, especially 
near the base. The upper part of the formation also 
contains small beds of sandstone which are absent in ex¬ 
posures downstream. 

There is some doubt whether the sandstone found at 
the base of the Cretaceous section in deep wells near 
peace River town is a western extension of the McMurray 
formation of the lower Athabaska River section, or merely 
a sandy phase of the basal Loon River formation. 

The contact of the Loon River shale with the over- 
lying Peace River formation is gradational and alternating 
with much lateral replacement of sandstone by shale so 
that the contact ascends stratigraphically northward. 

The Appendix to this thesis includes a detailed des¬ 
cription of the lithology of the outcrops of the Loon 
River formation from which the shale : samples, on which 
this microfaunal study is based, were collected, 

: :Ti!i and thickhbss 

McLearn (ref. 15 ) estimates the thickness of the Loon 
River formation on the Peace River at the ?t great bend” 
as 400 feet and in the wells to the south and west as 
1100 feet. This indicates a great thickening to the 
south and west. 

Based on megafaunal evidence the Clearwater and 
Moosebar formations, both marine sequences, have been 
correlated, in part, or in whole, with the Loon River

formation. The Clearwater formation outcrops along the 
lower Athabaska River, to the east of the Loon River 
outcropping area, and a thickness of 275 feet is quoted 
with the underlying McMurray formation assigned 180 feet. 

The Moosebar formation outcrops to the west of the area of 
Loon River outcrops, and is 800-1000 feet thick, with 
the underlying G-ething formation 1400 feet thick. This 
indicates that marine shale beds deposited by the Clear¬ 
water sea increase gradually in thickness from east to west. 
Thus, the thickening of the Loon River formation between 
the "great bend” on the Peace River and the wells to the 
south and west seems to be overestimated due to under¬ 
estimation of the thickness on the lower Peace River. 

PAL AS 0 NT 0L 0 0? 

Major correlations of the Loon River formation are 
based mainly on the presence of a megafauna in the Loon 
River shales of the eastern Peace River area, Alberta, 
containing the ammonite genera Lemuroceras and Beudantlceras . 
A lower fauna of the Loon River formation contains the 
pelecypod species Inoceramus dowlingi . 

The Lemuroceras fauna was previously known as the 
Beudantlceras affine fauna. Due to the fact that 
Beudantlceras has a much wider stratigraphic range than 
Lemuroceras the latter is preferred as the zone fossil. 

The Beudantlceras affine fauna was first described by 
Whiteaves (ref. 28) from collections made by McConnell 
in 1889-90 during his early, geological investigation 
of the Peace River area. Whiteaves (ref. 28) originally

been collected on the Wabiskaw (Loon) River, on the 
Mikkwa (Red) River, and on the Peace River. 

Stelck (ref. 26 ) reports that Lemuroceras has been 
collected from the top of the Moosebar shale on Pine 
River; from the top of the Moosebar shale and base of the 
Gates formation in the western Peace River area; and from 
the basal (Monies) member of the Peace River formation 
in the eastern Peace River area. Lemuroceras ranges 
from the upper part of the Moosebar formation up into 
the lower part of the Gates formation (type section), 
and from the Monias member of the Peace River formation 
down into the upper part of the Loon River shale. The 
Lemuroceras fauna is also present in the Clearwater 
formation of the lower Athabaska River section. 

F. H. McLearn (ref. IS) has discussed the European 
correlation of the Lemuroceras fauna establishing 
correlation with the Middle Albian sub-stage of England.

The faunas of the Fort St. John group correlate more 
readily with the European faunal assemblages for diagnostic 
zonal calibration than with the Cretaceous of the Gulf 
Coast region of North America. Stelck (ref.26) states 
that the base of the Middle Albian, from faunal correlation 
with the European Cretaceous mammillatum zone, should 
be drawn within the Loon River and Moosebar formations 
at least 200 feet below their upper contacts. Cleonlceras 
sp., which is closely akin to Cleoniceras suobaylei Spath 
reported by Spath (ref.25) from the Folkstone of England, 
is present below the horizon of Inoceramus dowling1 in 
the Loon River shale. The former genus belongs to the 
tardefurcata zone (uppermost Lower Albian) of Europe and 
thus Cleoniceras sp, found in the Loon River formation 
is considered to be uppermost Lower Albian or lowermost 
Middle Albian. 

The Lemuroceras fauna lived in the "Clearwater" Sea, 
a boreal sea extending down from the north and covering 
Northeastern British Columbia and Northern Alberta as 
far south as the town of Athabaska. As such the micro¬ 
fauna dealt with in this thesis should not be a near¬ 
shore or shoreline fauna. The marine sediments of the 
Clearwater and basal Grand Rapids formations on lower 
Athabaska River, the Loon River formation and the Monias 
(basal) member of the Peace River formation on the lower 
Peace River, the Moosebar and probably lower part of the 
Commotion formations on Pine River, probably some lower 
part of the Buckinghorse formation on Buckinghorse and 
Sikanni Chief Rivers, B.C., all show “Clearwater Sea" 
floodings.

CHAPTER III 

PALAEONTOLOGY AND CORRELATION 


PALAEONTOLOGY 

Seven microfaunal assemblages are recognizable in 
the portion of the Loon River formation studied in this 
thesis. Four megafaunal zones, two coincident with two 
of the microfaunal assemblages, and two stratigraphically 
higher than the scope of this thesis, are recognizable 
in the uppermost Loon River strata. There is an additional 
marine microfaunal assemblage, stratigraphically lower 
than the faunas studied in this thesis, known to occur 
in Loon River shale outcrops below. Fort Vermilion on the 
Peace River. 

The microfaunal zones are arbitrarily set up based 
on the microfaunal assemblage present and designated by 
the name of the most common or diagnostic species present. 

The succession of faunal assemblages of the Loon 
River formation is as follows: 

Lemuroceras 
Beudanticeras 

*• 

Haplophragmoides 318-B 
Gyroidina 355-A 

Haplophragmoides 3 80-A - Inoceramus dowlingi

Marine Fauna Below Fort Vermilion 

The microfaunal assemblage occurring in the Loon 
River formation below Fort Vermilion carries Robulus 
and Miliammina . This fauna occurs between 150 feet 
and 270 feet above the top of the Devonian limestones. 

This has not been examined by the writer. 

Artocapsa 704-0 Fauna 

This distinct microfaunal assemblage occurs approx¬ 
imately 400 feet above the top of the Devonian limestones, 
and is very limited in vertical extent. This fauna 
includes the following species: 

Artocapsa 704-C 

Cyrtocapsoma ? 704-A 
Cyrtocapsoma 704-B 

Bathysiprion ? sp. 

G-audryina sp. 

Eaplophragmoides 366-A 
Haplophragmoides 424-A 
Hyperammina sp. 

The above fauna is partially illustrated on Plate 
I of this thesis. 

This fauna is characterized by the presence of 
radiolarians - Artocapsa , Conostrobus , and Cyrtocapsoma , 
which dominate the assemblage. The radiolarians are 
pyritized which makes comparison with other species 
of radiolarians difficult. Radiolarians do not appear 
to be very common in the Cretaceous of Western Canada 
for very few genera have been reported. The three 
radiolarian genera reported here, to date (1951), have

not been previously reported from the Cretaceous of 
Western Canada* 

Poorly preserved specimens of two long ranging, 
small Haplophragmoides appear for the first time in 
this fauna; only a few poorly preserved specimens 
of Bathysiphon ? and G-audryina are present; one specimen 
of a small Kyperammina , well preserved is also present* 

Fauna of the "Spore" Zone 

This zone is characterized by an abundance of 
"spores’ 7 * These spores are being investigated in a 
companion study of the Loon River formation by 
A. W. Norris* 

The microfauna of the "spore" zone contains many 
foraminiferal genera but preservation is poor, the fauna 
is a dwarf one, and the individual genera are represented 
by few specimens. The faunal assemblage includes: 

Ammobaculites sp. 

Bathysiphon sp. 

Ciblcidella ? 483 -A 

Piscorbis ? sp* 

Haplophragmoides 366-A 
Haplophragmoides 424-A

A few species of this fauna are illustrated on 
Plate I of this thesis. 

These forms occur sporadically throughout the 
zone and are nowhere abundant. The specimens are so 
poorly preserved, and so small that identification 
in many cases is very difficult. 

Presence of small, poorly preserved specimens of 
the two long ranging haplophragmoides is again noted; 
also specimens of well preserved Spirillina and 
Cibicidella ?. The latter two genera: are restricted 
to the upper part of this zone. 

It is quite noticeable that when spores are abundant 
there is a paucity of foraminifera and vice versa. 

Several species of foraminifera do appear to live 
fairly well in an environment favouring spores, e.g. a 
hap 1 ophragmoides and several Krliamixtina. 

Haplophragmoides 424-A Fauna 

This zone is divided into two sub-zones, the upper 
or Amoiodiscus 411-A sub-zone, and the lower or "spore"- 
bearing sub-zone. The zone species, Eaplophragmoides 
424-A occurs in some abundance in both sub-zones but 
reaches its maximum development in the lower sub-zone. 
Elements of this fauna are found sporadically distrib¬ 
uted in the zones above and below. Species included in 
this fauna are: 

Ammodiscus 411-A sub-zone 
Ammobaculoides sp. 

Ammodiscu s 411 -A

Haolophragmoides 424 -A is long ranging, first 
appearing in the Artocapsa 704-C faunizone reaching a 
maximum in the lower part of its own zone, and 
continuing up to and into the Hap1ophragrnoides 360-A 
zone. Hap1ophragmoides 424-A seems to favour an 
environment in which spores are found for it appears 
when the "spores” appear, and continues upward until 
the "spores" decrease to an insignificant number in the 
lower sub-zone of Ha pio phragmoides 360-A zone. 

The mierofaunal assemblage of the upper sub-zone 
is dominated by the presence of the species Ammodiscus

zone with maximum development in the upper sub-zone. 

The .long ranging form Ha pio phr agmoides 366-A is 
also present; few specimens of well preserved Glomospira 
Miliammina , Spiroplectammina ?, Saccamina and Gaudryina 
are present; also poorly preserved specimens, or frag¬ 
ments of specimens of Idarginulina , Reophax , Ammobaculo1des , 
and Bathysiphon . 

A radiolarian, Dictyomitra , very similar to 
Dictyomitra multicostata Zittel is found in the upper 
sub-zone of this fauna. 

Fish teeth and bone material are present in the 
upper sub-zone of this fauna. 

Conostrobus 384-A Fauna 

This fauna consists essentially of two radiolarian 
species, restricted to this zone, which is very limited 
in vertical extent. Cleoniceras sp. occurs within 
this fauna. Species included in this fauna: 

Conostrobus 364-A 
Conostrobus 368-A 
Gaudryina 3 6 3 -A 
Glomospira sp. 

Elements of this fauna are illustrated on Plate I 
of this thesis. 

The two fairly thin walled species of Conostrobus 
are well developed; the other species are represented 
by few specimens. 

The absence of the underlying long ranging zone 
fossil, Hapiophragmoides 424 -A, is the most marked

change from previous faunas of the Loon River and 
distinguishes this fauna from the overlying 
Haplophragmoides 360-A zone which also carries 
Ha pio phr a gmoides 424-A. 

The presence of radiolarians and Cleoniceras sp. 
indicates that more open sea conditions existed at this 
time, favoring pelagic faunas and European connections. 

Haplophragmoides 360-A Fauna 

Elements of this fauna grade upwards into the over- 
lying Gyroidina 355-A faunal assemblage. This faunizone 
is divided up into an upper non- w spore" bearing sub¬ 
zone and a lower "spore" bearing sub-zone. Inoceramus 
dowlingi occurs in the upper sub-zone. This fauna 
includes:

This fauna is characterized by several species of 
Ha pio p hragmoides that have many chambers in the ultimate 
whorl. These forms carry on sporadically up into the 
overlying Q-yroidina 355-A zone and disappear. 

The lower, "spore" bearing sub-zone, contains few 
of the species of this fauna. The abundance of spores 
and paucity of microfauna, and vice versa, seems to 
hold true throughout the faunas studied in this thesis. 

The presence of Hapiophragmoides 424-A is noted for 
the last time, in the lower sub-zone of this fauna. The 
"spores" become sporadic in distribution in the zones 
above and insignificant in numbers. 

Gaudryina and Verneuilina are also common; a 
Reophax with deeply impressed sutures, and a well 
developed Glomospira are represented by few specimens; 

i* 

also a few specimens of intermittently occurring 
calcareous forms.

continues upward into the overlying Gyroidina 355-A

A well developed small Miliammina which was more 
abundant in the lower sub-zone of the Haplophragmoides 
424-A fauna is also present in the ”spore” bearing 
sub-zone of this fauna, where spores are in moderate to 
good abundance.

to this fauna. Echinoid spines occur in fairly large 
numbers in the suite containing the maximum development 
of the calcareous microfauna. Few specimens of 
Saracenaria and Marginulina are also present. The 
arenaceous microfauna of this zone, except for the 
Ba thy sinhon , is that of the Ha pi o phragruo i d e s 360-A 
fauna. This fauna might be considered a sub-zone of the 
H. 360-A zone but due to the presence of this very 
distinct calcareous fauna and the large Bathysiphon the 
writer considers that this is a separate zone. 
Haplophragmoides 316-B Fauna

Verneuilina 316-A 

Verneuilina sp• 

The above/fauna is partially illustrated on Plate I 
of this thesis. 

This fauna is characterized by the presence of a 
very distinct form, Ha pio p hra gmoides 318-B. This species 
is very different from any previously described from 
the Cretaceous of Western Canada. Verneuilina and 
Gaudryina are common throughout this fauna. Glomosoira 
311-B, which occurs sporadically in several of the 
lower zones, reaches its maximum development in this micro- 
faunal assemblage. Calcareous foraminifera are present 
but not in significant numbers. Only a few specimens 
of a large Hyperammina , a small Reophax , a Dentalina , 
and a Mlliammina are also present. The radiolarian, 
Dictyomitra , is represented by a few pyritized specimens. 

CORRELATION OF TEE LOON RIVER IVUCROFAUHAL A83LMBLAGSS

The Gyroidina 355-A faunal assemblage of the Loon

suites from the lower Moosebar shales in the Pine 
River area, British Columbia, from above the Gething 
member of the Bullhead group and below the Lemuroceras 
zone of the St. John group. 

The following paired species are identical or

The above list includes described and undescribed 
forms. The Moosebar shale contains other calcareous 
foraminifera not found in the Loon River formation 
probably replaced by arenaceous forms in the facies 
of the latter formation. 

On the microfaunal evidence presented above, the 
Gyroldina 355-A zone of the Loon River formation is 
correlated with the basal Moosebar shale. Thus, the 
major portion of the faunas described in this thesis 
is found in strata stratigraphically lower than the 
Moosebar shale. By normal sequence, the lower beds of 
the Loon River formation should be correlated with the 
upper Gething. Beach and Spivak (ref. 2) found a 
conglomerate filling, small channels and depressions in 
the top of the Gething sandstone, which indicates an 
interval of erosion before deposition of the Moosebar 
shale. Since the age of the lower beds of the Loon 
River formation is not definitely established the 
possibility arises that the lower beds of the Loon River 
formation are represented farther west by this period of 
erosion or possibly non-deposition, between the Gething 
sandstone and the Moosebar shale.

Correlation with Lesser Slave Lake Area, Alberta 

Because there is no published information on 
microfaunas from the horizon of the Loon River shale 
the writer personally examined suites from a Northern 
Alberta well at correlative horizons. The Bear Villa 
No, 1 well was chosen because of the availability of 
microfaunal suites. 

A dominantly calcareous microfaunal assemblage with 
several elements common to the Gyroiaina 355-A zone of 
the Loon River shale, occurs in the Loon River (?) shale 
in Bear Villa No. 1, about 40 feet above an ostracode 
zone. 

The following paired species from the Bear Villa 
well and the G- yroidina 355-A zone are identical or show 
marked similarity: 

Bear Villa No. 1 (2539*-2345 T ) Loon River formation 


Discorbis sp 0 
G-yroidina sp, 
Marginulina sp. 
Saracenaria sp. 


Discorbis 355-B 
G-yroidina 355-A 
Marginulina sp, 
Saracenaria sp. 


Similar echinoid spines are common to both of these 
dominantly calcareous suites. The arenaceous forms of 
these two suites are not identical. A.lso the Bear- 
Villa well suites contain calcareous forms not present in 
the G-yroidina 355-A zone of the Loon River formation. 

On the basis of the microfaunal evidence presented 
here the section in the Bear Villa well, beginning about 
40 feet above an ostracode zone and carrying this 
calcareous fauna, is correlated with the Gyroiaina 355-A 
zone of the Loon River formation.

Stelck (ref,26) reports a calcareous fauna is present 
in the basal part of the Clearwater formation, but points 
out that the fauna from the base of the Clearwater formation 
is not equivalent to basal Moosebar suite and suggests 
that the basal Clearwater fauna is a slightly earlier 
fauna than the Lower Moosebar fauna. 

The basal Clearwater fauna has not been found in the 
Loon River. Since the G-vroldina 355-B zone is here 
correlated with the basal Moosebar fauna the suggestion 
is also present that the basal Clearwater fauna, if it 
has a correlatable equivalent in the Loon River, occurs 
in the portion of Loon River stratigraphically lower than 
the Ha pio phragmoides 360-A zone. 

Evidence from ostracodes indicates that the basal 
Clearwater shale correlates with the Cummings member of 
the Mannville formation. Since only one form similar to 
the Cummings member fauna was found in the Loon River 
formation, and the Cummings member is correlated with 
the basal Clearwater shale, it appears that the Cummings 
member fauna must be stratigraphically lower than the 
Haplophragmoides 360-A zone.

CHAPTER IV 

TOPI ’Al HTSORTPTICh’ OF kIO":OTAITNA 

The Loon River formation microfaunal suites are 
composed of foraminifera and radiolarians. The foram- 
iniferal suites are composed of arenaceous and calcareous 
specimens, with a dominance of arenaceous forms. The 
microfaunal assemblages of the Loon River formation 
reported in this thesis are almost entirely different 
from any previously described fauna from North America. 
Specimens described in this thesis are given species 
rank and are designated by a number rather than a name 
to avoid creating manuscript names. In the event of 
publication these new species will be named. 

The species of microfauna illustrated and described 
in this thesis are representative specimens of the 
fauna present in the portion of the Loon River formation 
studied. 

The fauna is divided into two groups, foraminifera 
and radiolarians, and described in that order. The forms 
are described in alphabetical sequence in each group. 

The three numbers of the species designation refer to 
the suite in w T hich the hypotype was found. The strati¬ 
graphic position of the suites, within individual outcrops, 
may be obtained from the appendix.

it as Ammobaculites cf. humei. The suture lines in the 


straight portion appear curved which differs from those 
of A. humei but this curving may be due to crushing of 
the specimen. This species differs from Ammobaculites 
tyrrelli Nauss, from the Lloydminster shale in that the 
sutures are indistinct and walls are not smoothly fin¬ 
ished as they are in the latter form, except in the coiled 
portion where they are smoothly finished.

This species resembles Ammodiscus glabratus Cushman and 
Jarvis in wail makeup and appearance but differs in having 
fewer convolutions and in being much smaller. This form 
has a somewhat G-lomospira - like appearance but seems to 
be coiled quite regularly entirely in one plane.

Test large, elongate, a straight cylindrical tube, 
open at both ends; with thick arenaceous walls composed 
of finely arenaceous wTiite cement material with a smooth 
finish on the exterior; exterior carries subordinated, 
oblique, inflected wrinkles that form an irregular chevron 
design on one side. 

Length of hypotype - 1.23 mm., diameter of hypotype -

Hypotype - University of Alberta Palaeontological 
Type Collection 

Remarks: The hypotype specimen is crushed at one end. 

The pattern of inflected wrinkles and a certain modif¬ 
ication on the crushed end of the tube suggest possible 
generic affinities with Hyperammina but until a para- 
type specimen might be obtained possessing a proloculum 
it is retained in the genus Ba thysiphon . 

Bathysiphon 356-A resembles Bathysighon vitta .Nauss 
from the Lea Park shale, in wall makeup, indistinct con¬ 
strictions at regular intervals, and in diameter. The 
hypotye differs from Bathysighon vitta in having much 
thicker walls, lacking compression, and lacking external 
black coating. This form is similar to Bathysiphon ?

Remarks: This form is with hesitation referred to 

the genus Gibicidelia as the genus is considered to be 
confined to the Tertiary. Nature of the w r all and the 
tendency toward irregular behaviour of the later chambers 
suggest affiliation with the Family Anomalinidae. There 
is some suggestion that this form may have been attached 
originally in the region of the primary chambers.

simple trochoid pattern is difficult to ascertain for 
the above reason. 

The form of the species is quite variable, at times 
suggesting a globigerinoid shape, slightly distorted, 
and at other times a mere unorganized cluster of chambers, 
with chambers both of regular size and smaller auxiliary 
chambers present in some specimens. Except for the 
nature of the test wall the shape of individual specimens 
is sometimes suggestive of bleached glauconite pellets of 
microcoprolitic origin* Until an ontogenic series of 
specimens is built up for this species, the writer does 
not feel justified in setting up a new genus, and there¬ 
fore refers it to Gibicidella ? without implying direct 
phyletic relationship to the Tertiary genus Gibicidella .

but differs from the Moosebar species in being finely 
perforate and chambers visible in the spire. Gyroidina

be varietal difference or is possibly from difference in

Remarks: This form is very similar to

These species probably stand in varietal relation to 
each other. This species is similar to Ha p1ophr a gmoides

chambers and umbilicus less well defined. Haplophragmoiaes 
311-A bears a close resemblance to Haplophragmoides kirki 
Wickenden but differs from the latter form in that the 
sutures are slightly curved, and is smaller. These 
species possibly stand in sub-specific relationship to 
one another.

Remarks: The thin external wall and stout inter- 

cameral walls give a depressed expression to the chambers. 
Por this reason this form might be included under the 
form-species Haplopiiragmoia.es excavate . This species 
resembles Haplophragmoid.es 31-290-E, illustrated by 
Nielsen from lower part of Shaftesbury formation. Both 
forms are involute, showing! evolute development on one 
side in later chambers but differ in H. 360-A being 
smaller and having more chambers in ultimate whorl than 
the Shaftesbury species. This form also bears a 
resemblance to Haplophrsgmoides rota. Nauss, from Grizzly 
Bear shale, but the former is larger, has more chambers 
in ultimate whorl, and thicker intereameral walls. 

Ha piophr a gmoides 360-A is similar to Haplophragmoides 
excavata Cushman and Waters but differs from the hoiotype 
in being smaller, having more chambers in ultimate whorl, 
and becoming evolute in later chambers of the ultimate

384-A in having more joints, longitudinal ribs, and 
pores arranged in vertical series in furrows between 
ribs. This species closely resembles the genus 
Pictyomitra but the presence of an apical horn places 
it in the genus Lithostrobus .

Remarks: The wall structure could not be 

determined because of pyritization. This form resembles 
Cyrtocapsoma 704-B but this is a complete specimen. 

Cyrtocapsom a 704-B is considered conspecific with this 
form, with the sixth joint broken off.

Remarks: The hypotype specimen is pyritized so 
that wall structure is in some question. The hypotype 
resembles the genus Li tnost.robus but it is considered 
to be Cyrtocapsoma 704-A with last joint broken off. 

This form is considered conspecific with Cyrtocapsoma 
704-A from the same suite. Cyrtocapsoma 704-B 
resembles Honestrobus 584-A but honeycomb accentuation 
of pores, number of pores in each transverse row, and 
larger size differentiates it from the latter form.

APPENDIX 

LOCALITY INDKk OF MICROFAUNAL SUITES 
The Cretaceous section in the eastern Peace River 


area is as follows:

Smoky shale 

850 -900' 

Dunvegan sandstone

The microfaunal collections used in this thesis 
were made from shales of the Loon River formation. 

Shale samples from which the microfaunal suites 
were picked for study indicate the general lithology 
of the formation. However, a complete picture of the 
lithology is not presented, since in sampling, coarser 
sand elements, calcareous and ironstone nodules are 
discarded, so that the samples contain a potential 
recovery of microfauna as high as possible. 

The lithology of the strata from which the micro- 


faunal suites were picked is as follows:
