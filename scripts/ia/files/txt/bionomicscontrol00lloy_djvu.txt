PREFACE 

The members of the family Tabanidae (horseflies and 
deerflies) combine with the Culicidae (mosquitoes) and Simulidae 
(blackflies) to form a formidable trio of blood-sucking flies 
in northern latitudes. YJhilst of lesser importance than either 
the mosquitoes and blackflies, the tabanids, by virtue of their 
actual biting and annoying persistence, are of sufficient importance 
to warrant serious attention. 

Studies reported on in this paper were carried out 
during the spring and slimmer months of 19U8 and 1 9h9 by the author 
while employed as a Technical Officer on the staff of the Household 
and Medical Entomology Unit, Division of Entomology, Science Service, 
Department of Agriculture, Canada. The project was part of a 
program of biological and control studies carried out by the 
Division of Entomology on behalf of the Canadian Defense Research 
Board and with the co-operation of that organisation and other 
agencies. 

The author wishes to express his appreciation to Professor 
B. Hocking of the University of Alberta who gave advice and 
guidance in the preparation of this thesis; to Dr. 0* R. Twinn, Chief, 
Household and Medical Entomology Unit, of the Division of Entomology, 
at whose direction the project was carried out and who permitted 
the use of the data gathered while in the employ of his Unit; to 
the officers and personnel of the Defense Research Board Northern 







Laboratory at Churchill, Manitoba, for numerous privileges and 
much assistance, without which the project could not have been 
completed; to Mr* H* James of the Dominion Parasite Laboratory, 
Belleville, for many helpful suggestions; to Professor E. H. 
Strickland, University of Alberta, who never has been hesitant in 
offering assistance; to Mr, G. E* Shewell and Dr, 0* Peck, 

Division of Entomology, Dr, J, S, Rogers, University of Michigan, 
Dr, C, P* Alexander, Massachusetts Agricultural College, .Amherst, 
Dr, E, Hughes, University of Oklahoma, Dr. R. B. Miller, Dr, E* 
Moss and Miss L, Kennedy, University of Alberta, for identifying 
material and / or offering information in their respective fields* 
Finally the author wishes to record his appreciation 
of the services of three very able assistants, namely Messrs. 

C.B, Wall and B. C, Smith of the Defense Research Board, and Mr* 

J* Shemanchuck. Division of Entomology, The successful completion 
of the project is due, in large part, to the uncomplaining efforts 
of these three gentlemen*

ABSTRACT 


10 species of Hybomitra, 5 of Chrysops , and 1 of 
Atylotus are listed. Of these, Hybomitra itasca Philip, 

Hybomitra sp. (new?), and Atylotus ohioensis Hine are new 
records for the Churchill area. It has been established 
that the northern Tabanidae overwinter in the larval stage and 
most species have at least a 2-year life cycle. Problems in 
taxonomy are discussed briefly. Methods of rearing immature 
stages, collecting adults emerging in the field, estimating 
larval and adult populations, and correlating adult activity and 
weather conditions, are described. The presence of Prionocera 
dimidiata Lw., the larva of which is an important predator of 
Chrysops spp. larvae, is established. The chalcid, Diglochis 
occidentalis Ashm., was reared from the pupae of Hybomitra and 
Chrysops spp.. Dosages of 2,500, 10,000, and 160,000 ppm/mins. 

DDT and 2,500 ppm/mins. parathion are ineffective against larvae. 
2,500 ppm/mins. DDT against pupae shows promise. 6k line drawings 
and photographs and 1 map illustrate the text, and data are 
presented in 10 tables and 8 graphs. The paper concludes with 
38 references.

Literature Review 

The Tabanidae, being of considerable economic importance, 
have no dearth of literature relating to them. The following 
review, however, is aimed primarily at recording the methods of 
other authors in control measures since it is hoped that these pests 
can eventually be controlled either by biological, chemical, or 
mechanical means. 

Population and abundance studies, rearing techniques, 
habits and behavior, and problems in taxonomy have also been reviewed, 

1. CONTROL 
1.1. BIOLOGICAL 

Eggs - Cameron (5) in Saskatchewan reported the presence 
of the proctotrypid Phanurus emersoni Gerault, in the egg masses of 
Chrysops moerens Walk, and C. mitis O.S.. This parasite has also 
been reported by Webb and Wells (314.) in Nevada and Hatton (10) in 
British Columbia. Also present amongst the eggs of P. emersoni 
observed by Cameron were eggs of the small chalcid Trichogramma 
minutum Riley, Bailey (3) in Massachusetts reared the proctotrypid 
Telenomus gonlopis Ash, from eggs of Tabanus atratus subsp, 
nantuckensis Rine. 

Larvae - Jones and Bradley (llj.) in Louisiana have found 


the parasitic larvae of Phasiops flava Coq. (Dexiidae) in the larvae 
of Tabanus trimaculatus Pal. Beauv,

Pupae - Cameron ( 5 ) found the parasitic species 
Diglochis occidentals Ash. (Pteromalidae: Chalcidoidea) in the 
pupae of C. moerens, C. mitis, and C. excitans Walk, and Trichopria 
tabanivora n.sp. (Diapriidae) from the pupae of G. mitis and 
T. reinwardtii Wied# 

Jones and Bradley (lU) reported that the pupa of the 
bombyliid, Anthrax lateralis Say freed itself from the pupa of 
T. annulatus Say and an adult later emerged. 

Adults - The wasp, Bembex primaaestate Johnson and Bower, 
was reported by Webb and Wells (3U) to be predatory on the adults 
of T. insuetus O.S. and T. phaenops O.S.. The dead adults of 
these two species were found in the tunnels of the predator* 

1*2. CHEMICAL 

Larvae - Gjullin (8), tested one part of DDT in 10 
million parts of water against first and second instar larvae of 
C. discalis Williston in water and obtained a 72 per cent mortality 
in U8 hours. One part of DDT in 5 million parts of water caused 
a mortality of 98 per cent in U8 hours. 

A *035 per cent pyrethrum - kerosene emulsion used by 
Bailey (2) and mixed in the proportion of 1 quart of the emulsion 
to 7 - 8 quarts of water and lightly soaked into the soil gave 
excellent results. Within 5 minutes of application larvae of 
T. nigrovittatus Macquart began to appear on the surface where

they died a few minutes later* However Bailey does not 
consider this a practical control larvicide for the plots 
treated* 

Adults - Methoxychlor, DDT, Toxaphene, and chlordane 
were tested independently in a mixture of cyclohexanone and 
No* 1 fuel oil by Howell et a! (13)* Applications were from 
the air and consisted of spraying 10-acre plots at the rate of 
2 pounds of the chemical per acre* The effectiveness of the 
materials was determined by counting flies attacking draft horses 
led through the test plots 1 day before spraying and again 1, 2, 

3, 5 and 7 days after treatment* The results appeared to be 
somewhat erratic and no appreciable effect on fly populations 
could be demonstrated for any of the insecticides* 

Gjullin (8) sprayed cattle with 2- and U- per cent 
emulsions made from a stock emulsion containing 25 per cent DDT, 

68 per cent xylene and 7 per cent Triton X-100* Application 
of § gallon per animal did not noticeably reduce the numbers of 
flies attacking the cows* In laboratory tests flies that were 
confined for 2 minutes in glass jars coated with a 2 per cent DDT 
emulsion and then transferred to clean jars were killed in 8 hours, 
while those confined in coated jars for 10 minutes and then 
transferred, were killed in U hours* There is no mention made 
however, of the amount of DDT per unit area of glass, which, of 
course, is of prime importance*

Portchinsky (2U) reported two effective methods of 
reducing adult numbers. 

i. By spreading kerosene over the surfaces of selected 
pools* As the male adults skimmed the surface and dipped their 
proboscides in for water, the abdomens also came in contact with 
the kerosene. Death apparently was caused in this manner by 
poisoning or suffocation* 

ii* By coating a black shield with a sticky material 
and carrying it along paths in loiown adult localities* The 
adults were attracted in large numbers to the shield. 

The practice of coating stakes with various non-drying 
adhesives to obtain data on populations has been reported by 
Roth and Lindquist (26) and presumably could be used also as a 
control measure* 

1.3. MECHAHICAL 

Segal (27), in discussing Bourgault * s trap (6) for 
cattle flies suggests that the trap could be effectively used 
against horseflies. Primarily designed to rid cattle of the 
nuisance of Stomoxys in Mauritius, the trap consists of 

i* A darkened, partitioned building with entrance and 
exit doors. 

ii* A brush of leaves and branches. 

iii. A lighted chamber into which the flies are 
attracted after they are brushed off the animal, and where they

are afterwards destroyed. Ten minutes are said to be 

sufficient for a herd of 100 oxen to enter the building, 

of 

pass through the brushes, and come out A the trap at the other 
end freed of flies. The trap, rather than being constructed 
near a barn would be set in a convenient location in a pasture* 

2. POPULATION AND ABUNDANCE STUDIES 

Larvae - Using the pyrethrum - kerosene mixture 
referred to under chemical control Bailey (2) estimated the 
larval population of T. nigrovittatus from a salt marsh area 
in Massachusetts to be 22.6 per square yard. The population 
of the young larvae was greater than that of the mature larvae* 

Roth and Lindquist (26), by sieving soil and mud from selected 
areas, obtained various results ranging from 0 to 133 per 
square foot. Larval populations from the edge of a small stream 
in New York state were estimated by Tashiro and Schwardt (30) 
by the use of a sod-drying apparatus were as high as 120 per square 
yard. An area of sod 2 yards square and 3 inches thick, taken from 
under a canopy of trees in perpetually saturated s> H, but without 
standing water, yielded a total of 187 larvae of species of both 
Ghrysops and Tab anus . Logothetis and Schwardt (If?) dried sods on 
wire racks suspended over pans of water. As the sods dried, the 
larvae fell into the pans* Using this method they found 1 larva 
of T. quinquevittatus to 2 square feet* 







! \ 





7 


Adult - Abundance was estimated by Roth and 
Lindquist (26) by counting the numbers obtained by 
swinging a standard size insect net over the head U times 
after which 3 forward steps were taken. This procedure 
was repeated for 2 minutes during which time 32 swings of 
the net were made. Further observations were made by counting 
the flies captured on stakes coated with the non-diying 
adhesives Tanglefoot, Deadline and Hercolyn. The population 
of T. vicarius Walk, in New York state as estimated by 

«M nrmmt t» ,.n t m rrm 

Logothetis and Schwardt ( 15 ) was 20,000 per acre of pasture. 

They arrive at this figure through insectary rearings in 
which they obtained a Isl sex ratio. 

3* REARING TECHNIQUE 

In order to observe the larval moults, Marchand (16) 
reared larvae of T. lineola Fab. in test tubes containing a 
rolled sheet of filter paper somewhat less than the length of 
the tube and filled with water to about \ - 1 inch. Cheesecloth 
fastened to the top of the test tube served as a stopper. 
Pupations occurred in the upper portion of the test tube® Jones 
and Bradley (li|) successfully reared the larvae in moist sand in 
small glass jars. Philip (19) used damp soil, damp sand, and a 
modification of Marchand*s method i.e. used damp paper towelling 
instead of filter paper in the test tube* Fruit jars with 
galvanized wire gauze soldered into the ring have also proved

satisfactory (3U)} the larvae being kept in the moist 
environment in "which they were found* 

C* vittata Wied* was reared from egg to adult by 
keeping the larvae in mud in a tilted pan so that a moisture 
gradient ranging from moist mud from which water could not be 
expressed to complete submergence, was obtained (15). 

Larvae can live on a large variety of food* Marchand (16) 
fed larvae of T* lineola Fab. on earthworms and small pieces of 
meat. Hatton (10) fed fly maggots to larvae every 2-3 days but 
does not indicate the ration each tabanid larva received. Other 
observers have used mosquito larvae and small crustaceans as 
larval food. Cameron (5) found that species of Chrysops could be 
reared successfully simply by keeping the larvae in soil rich 
in decaying organic material while Logothetis and Schwardt (15) 
observed Chrysops vittata feeding on cranefly larvae and blow 
fly maggots. 

U. HABITS AND BEHAVIOR 

The egg laying habits are extremely variable. Roth 
and Lindquist (26) located egg masses of C. discalls on sedges, 
wire gauze, glass, card board, and other objects placed in the 
water near the shore. Unpainted wooden stakes and stakes painted 
red also proved to be excellent oviposition sites. Hatton (LO) 
found egg masses on water parsnip leaves, 7 inches above the 
water. These hatched when kept on moist moss. Webb and Wells (3U) 










were not successful in obtaining egg masses from T. phaenops O.S* 
in a large cage in yhich a calf was also enclosed* The adults, 
previously placed inside, occupied all their time attempting to 
escape* However eggs were obtained using a smaller cage 
consisting of a pan lh by 11 by 1* inches with a cheesecloth 
tent covering 18 inches high* Mud, water and vegetation were 
placed in the pan; the flies ovipositing on the vegetation* 

Eggs were also found on bulrush stems, coarse grasses, trunks 
of small trees, overhanging timbers and even on a barbed wire 
fence* Chrysops eggs were found on the large leaves of an 
aquatic plant* The leaves were flat on the water surface. 

Stone (29) has found tabanid eggs on rocks projecting from a 
flowing stream. 

Immature stages of T* vicarious can grow to maturity 
and emerge in pastures and meadows and in New York these places 
form the normal habitat (l5)» This, of course, is quite unusual 
as a larval habitat* 

Mating is not frequently observed* It almost always 
occurs in the morning, from before sunrise to about 9 o* clock. 
When the mating pair is at rest, the male hangs inert, and when 
in the air, the male does the flying (29)* Webb and Wells (3k) 
also observed mating in the early morning. The flies flying very 
rapidly in copula about 8 feet above the ground and then settling 
on a stem of grass for a few seconds before separating and flying

away* Hagman et al (9) observed mating to occur generally 
from 2-5 feet above ground and occasionally as high as 20 feet* 
The male struck the female and connection was made in flight* 
after which the pair attached to a leaf* one holding firm 
while the other hung motionless below* These observations 
by Hagman et al were made during the evening which appears to 
be an unusual time of day for mating to occur* 

Stone (29) states that the adults are lovers of 
sunlight, wamth* and moisture and are possessed of a * strong 
positive phototropism ! * They are attracted to moving objects 
such as automobiles and trains* and will also collect around, 
and in* a standing automobile* This behaviour was also noted 
by Twinn et al (32)® Stone (29) mentions further that the 
adults are attracted to water as evidenced by the large numbers 
which are frequently seen at the water *s edge* 

Males of T* giganteus De Geer were seen by Hagman 
et al (9) hovering along the edge of a country road around sun¬ 
down and remaining active well into twilight* This habit 
appeared to be restricted to the period just before darkness when 
the temperature was falling, and the author suggests that its 
purpose may have been to maintain the body temperature of the 
males sufficiently to enable them to make the rapid flights 
necessary to overtake the females at this time# 


Adult activity was found by Tashiro and Scfawarcfc (30) 
to be practically negligible below 72° F* They observed the

greatest activity between 72°F and the »high 80°s* regardless 
of humidity conditions# In the 90°s activity was somewhat 
reduced and* during gusts of wind, ceased entirely# Adults 
were very active during a storm front with an overcast sky and 
high humidity. Uvarov (33) endeavored to correlate adult 
activity in many groups of insects with weather phenomena# He 
discusses at length the various factors effecting activity and 
concludes that most activities are influenced by a combination 
of several meteorological factors and it is impossible to 
explain the activities by a single one# 

The volume of blood which various species can 
engorge has been estimated by many authors# Thus Cameron (5) 
estimates that T# septentrionalis Loew becomes completely 
engorged with o#2 cc# of blood in 10 minutes* He further 
estimates that on a day when the adxlts are active throughout, 
cattle would lose about 100 ccs. if bitten to engorgement $0 
times per hour# Tashiro and Schwardt (30) weighed specimens 
of T# quinquevittatus Wiedemann immediately after blood meals 
had been taken and calculated each specimen to take cc# of 
blood. At 90 bites per hour, in an 8 or 9-hour day, each head 
of cattle would lose approximately 53 cc. The same authors found 
that T# sulcifrons Macquart could engorge #359 cc# and indicate 
that the loss per head of cattle during a period of 8 or 9 hours 
would be about 1X5 cc# if the cattle were receiving I4.0 bites per

hour* Incorrect readings will be obtained unless the 
specimens are weighed immediately following engorgement 
since the assimilation leading to excretion of the blood is so 
rapid* The authors suggest that the loss of blood is 
probably greater than the volume indicated since they do not 
include blood that drips or oozes from the wound after the 
fly leaves* 

Philip (19) estimates the blood loss per day per animal 
could be as high as 300 cc* • Webb and Wells (3U) observed the 
feeding of T* phaenops and estimated conservatively that if an 
animal was subjected to the constant biting of 25 - 30 flies 
for 6 hours (each fly becoming engorged in 8-10 minutes), 

100 cc* of blood would be taken* 

5o TAXONOMY 

In a recent publication Philip (21) has done away 
with the genus Tab anus sens* lat* which, to his mind, formed a 
convenient M catch-all 1 ’ • Tabanus Linn* sens* stric* now refers 
to that group of the tribe Tabanini having a ncnnal flagellum 
with b distinct annuli (in doubtful cases, abdomen without 
sublateral rows of spots )5 vertex without distinct, denuded

than one purple band (See Chapter 2) and the abdomen may have 
a uniform, pale, mid dorsal stripej front of female with a broad

basal callosity 5 annular hair, if present, very inconspicuous; 
body and wings varicolored (when entirely black, over 1$ mm 0 in 
length)* 

The author, in presenting this paper, has adopted 
Philip * s nomenclature and all northern species dealt with, and 
previously placed in Tab anus sens* lat*, have been removed and 
placed in the genus Ifybomitra End. This genus, also in the tribe 
Tabanini, refers to the group having a nomal flagellum with U 
distinct annuli (in doubtful cases, abdomen without sublateral 
rows of spots); vertex of the female with a distinct, denuded 
ocelligerous tubercle, or, in the male, with an elevated, 
anteriorly shining tubercle (in doubtful cases eyes are densely 
pilose)* Front of female variable, but the basal calosity 
correspondingly broad; eyes usually distinct^ pilose; eye facets 
of male relatively undifferentiated; scutellum usually dark* 

Pechuman (18) indicates that further work is required 
on the immature stages of C® carbonaria Walk* and G. mitis 0®S® 
because many workers suspect that, these two species are not 
distinct although the larval characters are said to show that they 
are different* He also points out the similarity between the 
adults of G® carbonaria, G* celer 0*S* and G* excitans Walk® 

Stone (28) pointed out the similarity between the 
females of H* gracHipalpis Hine and H* cristatus Curran and also 
the similarity between the female of H* gracilipalpis and

H* affinis Kby* Hine (11) noticed this similarity between 


the last two but pointed out that gracilipalpis , although 
suggestive of affinis, had more slender palpi, the front was 
narrower, the frontal callosity quite different, the average 
size somewhat smaller, and the general form less elongate. 

The male of H* septentrionalis Loew was unknown to 
Stone (28) and not sufficiently well described to permit 
distinction between it and related species* 

Philip (20) noted the similarity between C* furcatus 
Walk*, C. lupus Whit*, £• coloradensis Big*, G# proclivis 0*S* , 
311(1 £• sra?dus O.S.. The group is a heterogeneous one having 
superficial resemblance in the pattern seen on the abdomen,

of the face in all but coloradensis * A darker apoeios of

Taxonomy 

1. LARVAE 

For purposes of description, Marchand (17) considers 
that the following points should be noted:- 
i* Abdominal markings 
ii* Striae 

iii. Characteristics of *prolegs* (Obviously referring to the 
ventral proleg-like tubercles) 
iv. Length of siphon tube 
Vo Structure of antoinae 

In the hope that differentiating characters in the 
larvae would be reta ined in the last larval exuvium, as in the 
case of mosquitoes, all last instar exuviae from insect ary 
reared material were retained* The above characters are not 
retained, however, and occur only in the fully mature larvae* 
Taxonomic work with larvae could be done either by rearing 
described larvae to identifiable adults or by rearing larvae 
from the eggs of identified females* The latter would 
appear to be the more suitable* This would be possible if a 
method could be devised whereby females would lay eggs in 
captivity* 

2. PUPAE 

Marchand (1?) has also listed characters which 
he considers of taxonomic importance in the pupae* These are:-

i. Length of antennal sheath, 

ii. Character of the thoracic spiracle, especially the 
inner margin. 

iii. Length of the hairs on the abdomen, 

iv. Size and shape of the spines on the 8th segment. 

It is possible to distinguish between the male and 
female pupae of both Chrysops and Hybomitra spp.. In the 
female, the large, ribbed anal tubercle which is present in 
the male, is very much reduced, (Fig. l). The fringe of 
spines ventral to the anal tubercle which is continuous in 
the male, is divided in the female* 

Cameron (5) has illustrated pupal asters of a 
number of Chrysops and Hybomitra spp*. A careful examination 
of the pupal skins obtained from insect ary rearing reveals 
that the size and shape of pupal asters are not in themselves 
of taxonomic value. To support this statement a series of line 
drawings were made illustrating pupal asters of various species* 
The results are shown in Figs. 1 to 9 inclusive* Variation 
exists not only within a species but also similarities between 
species so that it is unwise to base Identification on pupal 
asters alone. As an example, there is a wide variation In 
relative size, di ape and position in the pupal rays of 
H. septentrionalis males and females and C. nigripes males, as 
shown in Figs. 2, 3 and 9 respectively. 









17 


Pupal asters of other species are illustrated in 
Figs. U to 8 inclusive. The gnarled appearance of the rays 
in the male of A. ohioensis may be of taxonomic significance 
but since only one male and one female was reared, further 
evidence is needed. The rays of the female are not gnarled. 
However, the immature stages of both the male and female of this 
species are white in color and easily distinguishable from the 
immature stages of Chrysops and Hybomitra spp. . The 
abdominal segments do not show such conspicuous bands as 
species in the other genera. In point of fact, these larvae can 
be easily mistaken for any one of numerous, pale dipterous 
larvae since they do not conform in color or general appearance 
with the tabanid larvae usually encountered in the north. 

3. ADULTS 

To the student of the Tabanidae, the works of Stone (28) 
and Brennan (U) are indispensable. The identification of 
Hybomitra spp, (Tabaninae) and Chrysops spp. (Pangoniinae) 
respectively have been made with the keys and descriptions of 
these authors. Invaluable contributions to the taxonomy of this 
group have also been made by Philip (19, 20, 21, 23). 

Little difficulty was encountered in separating the 
species of Chrysops although 2 specimens of C. frigida O.S. 
from field cages were considerably darker than usual. 

Separating the males of hybomitra spp. proved to be 


difficult. This is not surprising in view of the fact that the

males of the Tabanidae are seldom seen and still more 
rarely captured* Reference material is scanty* 

The separation of the females of H. affinis and H* 
gracilipalpis is also difficult* In an effort to obtain a 
linear measurement ratio which might be used in separating the 
females of these two species, measurements were made of the 
length of the hind tibia, width of the head, length of third 
antennal segment and length of discal cell* Various ratios 
were computed from these measurements but none were 
significantly different between the species* During the season, 
however, specimens which were considered to be H* gracilipalpis 
owing to their small size, were dissected and egg counts 
recorded* The mean of these differed from the mean egg count 
of typical H. affinis by some UO percent, (Table 2, P.73 ). 

All Efebomitra spp* have beautifully colored eyes in life but the 
coloration quickly fades with death and is seen only occassionally 
as dull, purplish, horizontal bars in pinned specimens. This 
coloration may be of taxonomic importance in differentiating 
between the two‘species* Throughout this paper the affinis - 
gracilipalpis complex has been considered under the general 
heading of H* affinis * 

All specimens which were obtained from insectary 
rearings and field emergences were identified by the author and 
were confirmed or corrected by Mr. G. E* Shewell. The

following is extracted from a memorandum by Mr. Shewell, 
dated December lit, 19h9'» 

*It is not a bit surprising that Mr. Miller had 
trouble with the males of Ifybomitra . No one has yet accumulated 
enough material of this sex to construct a good key, and it is 
to be noted that neither Stone nor Philip (Can. Ent. 3-937) had 
enough material to feel justified in including septentrlonalis Lw. 
in their keys. I am reasonably sure that most of Mr.. Miller*s 
males are this species* I have provisionally recognized 5 
species among the males, as follows;-

marked with a query due to differences in size and color pattern 
of the abdomen*

that these are septentrionalis, although they are O.K. for size*

I have considered what these unnamed species might be 
having regal'd to our knowledge of the females occurring in the 
area, but can reach no conclusion at present. I am quite certain 
that gracilipalpis Hire is not among the males in the collection, 
We have proof that the male of this species is the same as that 
described by Curran as cristatus (crested). It is characterized

by a very distinct crest of long black hairs on the mid-line 
of abdominal segments 2-U« Other males in this group have 
only a few erect long black hairs on the second segment* I 
am also sure that metabolus Mc.D* is not represented. 

There is no doubt that, at present, the males 
in this group constitute a very difficult taxonomic problem, 1 








Biology 


1. LARVAE 

The larvae of the tabanid species wider observation 
at Churchill were similar in appearance to those described by 
March and (16). That is, they were elongate, cylindrical, 
slender, tapering at both ends, and capable of contraction and 
extension. The body consists of a head and 3 thoracic and 9 
abdominal segments, the last segment being very short. The 
larvae are eueephalous, with head well developed bub small and 
withdrawn, bearing the 3-jointed antennae just above the palpi, 
the basal joint being short, the others of varying length. They 
are metapneustic, usually aquatic or semi-aquatic, and 
occasionally terrestial# 

1.1. COLLECTING METHODS 

The search for tabanid larvae in the field began 
June 1st., but owing to very cold weather had to be abandoned 
in favor of a procedure which produced excellent results with 
less discomfort. Vegetative ground cover collected from 
suspected larval habitats was sorted over carefully in the 
laboratory. This vegetative ground cover, composed mainly of 
mosses, was dumped on a long table covered with galvanized iron, 
where it was possible to pick it over in comparative comfo rt. 

All specimens taken in this maimer were retained and the bulk

of the picked-over moss recorded in order to obtain a figure 
for the number of larvae present per acre of habitat* 

In the northern latitudes frost leaves the ground 
surface very slowly and persists almost throughout the month 
of June* Permafrost, of course, is present the year round. 

The northern species of Tabanidae overwinter in 
the larval stage; the vast majority not more than 2 to 3 inches 
below the surface of the vegetation. Our search during this 
period was confined, therefore, to this top 3 inches* Below 
this depth everything was frozen but it was possible to chop 
out fairly large pieces of vegetation and allow them to thaw out 
in the laboratory* Tabanid larvae were found under such conditions 
but in very small numbers and much time was required chopping 
and thawing so this procedure was discontinued. Stone (28), in 
an endeavor to simulate natural conditions, attempted to rear 
larvae that he had frozen in their environment. As a result of 
his experiment he states that the larvae cannot survive in 
frozen soil, at least if it is moist. This statement does not hold 
true for the larvae of northern species* 

1.2. SELECTED SEARCH AREAS 

Experiences in 19U8 indicated that obtaining a large 
collection for rearing purposes would take much time and effort* 

It was planned to have at least 300 larvae in rearing at the 
insectary by the middle of June* 





30 


All suspected larval habitats were searched and 
whilst many of these proved to be almost without life, it was 
generally possible to find one or two tabanid larvae* 

The first larva found was on June 1st. A small 
hummock approximately 8 Inches in height was sticking up 
through the icy water in the trail of a tracked vehicle. 

The trail skirted the edge of a group of spruce and larch, 
and during the previous summer and fall was dampened only 
occasionally by light rainfall* The nearest permanent body 
of water was a small pool 100 yards away from the trail* A 
green larva, approximately one inch long, was found within the 
hammock when the latter was accidently kicked over, and the 
larva was seen lying on top of the ice* 

Searching was continued in a random maimer until 
heavily populated areas were located* Ihere larvae were 
found at the rate of 10 to 1$ per man per day, the population 
was considered to be unusually large* During the summer U 
such areas were located and practically all the larvae taken 
for rearing purposes came from these areas, which are 
described below* 

i* A rather large pool approximately 100 yards 

/£<=*-' 

long and 15 yards wide at point 92602? (Jigs. 11). Depth did 
not exceed 3 feet* During the early part of June the bottom 
of the pool was covered with dead leaves, twigs, moss, and

decaying organic matter to a mean depth of about 1* inches* 

Below this, the ground was frozen. Quantities of this bottom 
material were taken from the pool to the laboratory where it 
was carefully worked over* This location proved to be the 
least productive of the four search areas and was soon 
abandoned* 

ii. An area of approximately one acre of rather 
open tundra meadow surrounded by a border of spruce and 
larch trees 16 - 20 feet high. Point 901*065 (Fig* 12)* Sparse 
arctic willow and small patches of young spruce and larch, not 
exceeding 1* feet in height grew here* Previously the whole area 
had been flooded with the spring thaw with only the elevated 
knolls and hummocks left visible, but on June 6, when the 
first search was conducted in this area, only small pools 
remained, although the ground everywhere was saturated* 

In this area there were 2 types of moss, one of a 
compact, hard-packed growth, and a second, loosely woven moss* 

Ho larvae were found in the former, possibly because of its 
physical nature* 

The second type of moss proved to be the most 
productive habitat encountered* Each searcher averaged one 
larva every 5 minutes on a good day* Seldom, however, could 
this average be maintained for longer than 2 hours, and on only 
one occasion did one of the party exceed 1*0 larvae in a day*s

searching. It is difficult to explain how two men standing 
not 10 feet apart, each with equally good eyesight, searching 
in identical habitats, can produce such different results. In 
one instance one of the party picked up 22 larvae in a morning 
while his co-worker, working in the same area found none. 

By June 10th the weather had warmed considerably 
and it was possible to work outside without discomfort. On 
this date 3 searchers found 105 larvae in 5 hours in this area, 
a performance which was unequalled subsequently throughout the 
season. 

iii. Point 901*068 (Fig. 13) was the next area 
searched. It comprised an area of approximately one acre of 
low-lying grassy tundra interspersed with the occasional 
willow clump and single larch or spruce tree. Small pools were 
still present from the spring thaw and the edges and bottoms of 
these pools were covered with moss and sedges to a height of 
12 - 15 inches. 

Larvae were found in all sorts of situations. Some 
were about one half inch from the surface and others 3-1* inches 
below the surface. The layer of moss was approximately 3 inches 
deep, but varied, and occasionally was as much as 5 inches. This 
moss covered a rotting, mucky bottom which, on June 10th, was 
still icy. By peeling off this top layer of moss and turning a 
handful^ upside down, numerous larvae were found sticking half 
way out.

Most larvae were found where the moss was just 
projecting 2-3 inches out of the pools. The larvae were then 
found dose to the water level# Small areas covered with a 
foul smelling scum were also subjected to a thorough 
searching and although many rat-tailed maggots (Syrphidae) were 
found, these areas were devoid of immature stages of the 
tabanids# Very seldom, throughout the season, were larvae found 
in anything other than a fresh, living medium# However, one 
larva of a ffibomitra sp. was found which had passed the winter 
in the root of an aquatic plant# The plant had decomposed to 
such an extent as to make identification impossible# 

Many of the pools in the north sustain almost no 
visible fauna. These are the pools, the bottoms of which 
consist of a coal-black, decaying organic muck with a most 
disagreeable odor# Absence of fauna is probably attributable 
to physico-chemical factors# One such pool gave a p H as 
low as h. 5*. 

iv# This last area was the largest one searched# 

It consisted of about 5 acres of stagnant muskeg area and 
interconnected pools surrounding point 9214.025 (Fig# lij.) 
and bordered by a heavy stand of spruce and larch. To the 
south a bank rose steeply at an angle of 60 degrees to 
approximately 3 feet above the water level. There was a 
transition from loosely packed moss, to tightly packed moss

and decaying roots and leaves covered -with an inch of 
reindeer moss* Larvae were found in all these situations* 

Many larvae were found on the bank along the south 
margin* Those at the water *3 edge were small and generally the 
size increased with increasing distance from the water. 

Very large larvae were found some distance from the water 
under the reindeer moss which was dry and peeled off in a layer* 
The decaying vegetation immediately below this was only slightly 
damp* 

1*3* POPULATIONS 

Larval populations of areas i. and ill * were 
estimated using the following method:- 

All the material worked over in the laboratory was 
retained in a large garbage pail with a capacity of 0.16 
cubic yards and it was thus possible to arrive at a figure for 
the number of larvae per cubic yard. The material was packed 
as much as possible since the bulk was obviously increased 
considerably when pulling the moss apart* 

From area i* 20 larvae were obtained by picking over 
0.16 cubic yards of moss* etc*. This would indicate a larval 
population of 20 for an area of 1*1 Ji square yards to a depth 
of U inches* This is equivalent to approximately 67*200 larvae 
per acre of pool bottom* 

From the same bulk of bottom material worked over* 
i.e.* 0*16 cubic yards* 60 tipulid larvae were found which

would give an approximate population of 201,600 per acre 
of pool bottom. It is significant to note that almost 
invariably larvae of this tipulid species were found in the 
same habitat as the tabanid larvae, particularly those of the 
Hybomitra spp.. 

£ 

Using the same method the larva® population in 
area iii* was estimated at 200,900 per acre. (For comparative 

data 2 months later see page U3 )

l.U. OBSERVATIONS AND DISCUSSIONS 

1. Practically every larva found appeared to be 
three quarters to fully grown. If our previous suspicion, 
that some of the species at least, had a two year term life 
cycle, was correct, smaller larva© should be found 
representing the brood of 19U8, whilst the larger larvae 
which we were finding would represent the brood of 19U7® At 
first glance then, it appeared that the northern species of 
Tabanidae enjoyed a one-year life cycle with the larvae 
reaching near maturity probably around the middle to the end 
of September and passing the winter in this stage. Subsequent 
records from insect ary rearings and field observations 
throughout July and August proved that this supposition was 
erroneous and that certain species at least have a two-year life 
cycle. It would probably be more correct to say that the life 
cycle of these species is more than one year since the

possibility exists that 3 or U years may be required to 
complete development. 

2. Larval colors ranged from creamy-yellow to 
leaf green, or to shades of brown. These various colors could 
arise from three possible causes, differences of: 

i. Nutrition 

ii. Age 

iii. Species 

The first possibility was considered unlikely since 
several larvae, all different in color, could be found in 
a single environment. It was found in the insectary rearings 
that the color variations qd uld be attributed to moulting in 
some instances, and in others, to a gradual color change 
with age. 

Subsequent vrork with the reared material Indicates 
that color is not specific: different species often having the 
same color and one species having varying colors# 

The most abundant leaf-green larvae blend so beautifully 
with the green moss where they are usually found that is is 
possible for even a keen observer to miss them. This coloration 
may have protective significance* With the possible exception 
of stratiomyid and tipulid larvae, which are dark in color, all 
other aquatic or semi-aquatic larvae encountered were pale 
yellow and easily seen#

3. All larvae had been found within 2-1* inches of 
the surface in the thawed vegetation. They certainly could not 
have worked through the frozen moss even if they were active 
at that time of year and therefore they must have passed the 
winter in the top I* inches. Larvae should be easier to find in 
the spring than in the fall since they are then concentrated 
near the surface. Observations showed that, as the lower layer 
of vegetation begins to thaw and dry out, the larvae go deeper in 
search of food and moisture. Towards the end of the summer 
larvae were becoming increasingly difficult to find and many were 
taken 6-8 inches below the surface in more moist conditions 
than the top k inches afforded. 

1*. As already mentioned, the larvae population 
in iii. was estimated at 200,900 during the first week in June. 

On the 19th of August, over two months later the same area had 
an estimated population of only 35*500 and many of these were 
found 6-8 inches below the surface. The main reason for this 
diarp decline, of course, was the fact that by August 19th the 
19k9 brood of larvae had not hatched, and also by that date, 
all the flies for the season had emerged. The only larvae left 
in the ground then, were those which had hatched in the fall of 
19U8 and would emerge as adults during the summer of 1950 
(assuming a two-year life cycle only). Other contributary 
factors which might account for such a notable decline ares- 
i. Predators (See Chapter on insectary rearings).

ii. Cannibalism. The strong cannibalistic tendency 
would account for the absence of any concentrations of 
Hybomitra larvae in the field# 

iii. Other natural mortality. 

5 # Ety June 10th warmer weather had excited the 
cannibalistic nature of the larvae of Efybomitra spp. in the 
insectary. Owing to a shortage of containers, about 35 
Hybomitra spp. and Chrysops spp. larvae were placed in a single 
U-oz. specimen jar and within a matter of 2 hours, no less than 
10 larvae had been completely devoured by the other larvae. 
Thereafter all larvae were placed in corked, individual, shell 
vials 16 x 50 mms. with a small amount of moss. This technique 
proved completely satisfactory and eliminated losses due to 
cannibalism. 

6# During the early part of June tabanid larvae 
showed little inclination towards food# Hybomitra spp. larvae, 
usually voracious eaters, refused snails, slugs, tipulid, and 
other dipterous larvae and exhibited none of their well known 
cannibalistic tendencies. Five or six larvae could be left in 
a small jar at this time of the year without any danger of 
cannibalism# 

7# On two separate occasions while searching for 
larvae the observer received bites from them, and on each 
occasion the skin was pierced on the inside of the figsJeig# A 
sharp stinging sensation was felt ifcich persisted for 20 minutes#

No blood was drawn and no swelling occurred* 

8* Slides were made periodically of larva# gut 
contents and submitted to Dr* E. 0. Hughes, botanist from 
Oklahoma University, in an effort to determine whether or not 
algae formed any part of the larva^s diet* Usually all the 
food was found in the hind gut and consisted of a rather hard, 
compact, brown pellet* When this pellet was macerated and 
viewed under a microscope, only numerous small oil globules 
were discemable* No micro flora could be recognized* 

Numerous dissections were made of both living and preserved 
material and examined but no structurally recognizable 
material was found* 

9* On June 10th a large Hybondtra sp. larva was 
found which appeared to have a growth on its anterior segments* 

On closer examination however, this 1 growth 1 was seen to be a 
small dam (Sphaeriidae) 1*5 nun* in length, which had attached 
itself firmly to the larva*s integument* No amount of twisting 
and rolling could dislodge the clam* Even when placed in 70 
per cent alcohol it held on tenaciously and only when it had 
died was its grip released*

Ephydridae, Chironomidae and many 
cyclorrhaphous larvae and puparia# 
Coleoptera - Mainly Dytiscidae 
Odonata - Libellulidae and Aeschnidae. 

2# PUPAE 

The following description is taken partially from 
Marchand (17) and is supplemented by an examination of the 
pupal cases of H# septentrionalis » 

The pupae of tabanids strongly resemble the obtect 
lepidopterous pupae having wing and leg cases firmly attached 
to the body# The pupa is sub cyl indr i cal * abruptly pointed or 
rounded anteriorly, and tapering somewhat posteriorly; it is 
generally yellow to ferrugineous brown# The antennal sheaths 
are firmly appressed, pointing outward# The segments of the 
thorax are indistinct; the me so thorax bears the large, raised, 
ear-shaped spiracular openings# Two pairs of small tubercles, 
each with a central hair, are situated antero-ventrally on the 
thorax, and a single similar pair, aniero-dorsally# The 
abdominal segments are distinct and finely wrinkled, and on each 
segment there is a pair of small tubercles situated on the median 
lines of the lateral areas, near the anterior margin of each 
segment# The segments are about equal in length and have one or 
more fringes of hairs which encircle the segment near the hind 
margin# These hairs are progressively longer from before backwards. 









47 


and are best developed on the 7th segment* The 8th segment is 
short, and is provided with 6 projecting rays or teeth and 
with a large anal tubercle* In the male the tubercle is 
ribbed, and bounded ventrally by a continuous fringe of 
strong spines; in the female the tubercle is very much reduced 
and the spines of the fringe are widely sqo arated. The pupae of 
many of the larger species have, in addition, a pair of lateral, 
hand-shaped tufts of spines on the 8th segment, and also a 
similar, but smaller pair, situated dorso-ventrally• 

2. 1. AREAS OF OCCURRENCE 

Pupae, like larvae, were found in almost every 
conceivable situation but the following general remarks can 
be made* 

Normally Hybomitra spp. pupae are found in drier 
habits than are the larvae, although in one instance a pupa 
was found in completely saturated conditions lying horizontally 
at the water level of a small area of moss in the middle of 
a pool* Such instances are extremely rare, however* Prior 
to pupation Bybomitra spp* larvae migrate considerable distances 
away from the pool 9 s edge to a drier situation* Ghrysops spp* 
larvae, on the other hand, pupate in the larval environment 
which normally is right on a pool 1 s edge where saturated 
conditions exist. The majority of Chrysops spp. pupae were 


found in these locales, but here again, exceptions did occur

where the pupae were found in bone-dry areas* 

On only one occasion was more than one ffybomitra 
sp. pupa found in the same handful of moss, Chrysops spp* 
pupae were invariably found in small groups ranging from 
3 to 12 pr square foot* 

The first pupa was found in the field on June 21st 
and was a dybomitra sp* • It was found J of an inch below 
the surface of the moss in a vertical position* 

Chrysops spp* pupae were found for the first 
time on June 27th* 

Pupae were found in the field completely exposed 
on the surface of the vegetation* Others were found with 
only the thorax protruding, while others remained 
approximately J of an inch below the surface* The last was 
the most general* It was observed in the insectary that just 
prior to emergence the pupa becomes fairly active, and by twisting 
and turning its body, slowly worms its way upward through the 
vegetation* The upward movement is aided materially by the 
presence of backward projecting bristles situated in the 
posterior border of the abdominal segments* 

During the formation of the imagines, the pupae 
can be found in any position* Some are vertical, either 
end uppermost, some horizontal, and others inclined* 

Snergence apparently always takes place, however, from pupae 











VO'

in a nearly vertical position, with the head uppermost, 
since practically all empty skins found were in this 
position* 

2* 2. PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS 

Newly formed pupae generally exhibit the same 
colors as the last instar larvae, which in Chrysops spp. 
range from light yellow to dark brown, and in Hybomitra spp*, 
from leaf-green to dark steel grey* As the age of the pupa 
progresses, the thoracic region becomes darker first and this 
darker coloration slowly extends to the tip of the abdomen* 

At times the region of the wings become almost black* 

Just prior to the emergence of adults of Chrysops 
spp* it is sometimes possible to see the eyes and eye 
coloration of the imago through the pupal case and thus 
determine the sex* This phenomenon could not be observed in 
Ifobomitra spp* pupae* 

3* ADULTS 

Adult studies were considerably hampered during 
the entire season by inclement weather throughout July and 
August. Unlike the mosquitoes and blackflies, tabanids 
remain inactive during periods of sustained cloudiness and 
cold weather*

In the immediate Churchill area, was found to be quite abundant 
late in the season of 19U8 in the forest 25 > miles south of 
Churchill (32). In 19h9 however, 3 new records were 
established, i#e# H. itasca, Itybomitra sp. (new?), and 
Atylotus ohioensis. 

Dr. H. H. Schwardt identified H# illota O.S. and 
H. rhombica O.S. among the material collected at Churchill 
by McClure in 1936-37 (12). Neither species has since been 
recorded from this area# 

H. nudus McDunnough, H. epistates O.S. 

Haematopota americana O.S. (1 specimen), and C. lupus Whitney 
(1 specimen) have been identified by Mine (11) among the material 
collected in Alaska in 1921 by Dr. Aldrich. H. epistates is 
one of the smaller species of the affinis group but somewhat 
variable in size# The sub arctic distribution of these species 
may be more extensive and it seems possible one or more of them 
might occur at Churchill# 

Travis (31) collected 5 species of Chrysops and 9 
species of Tabanus ( ffibomitra ) in Alaska but none of them 
commonly bit man. 

Observation made during the X9U8 and 1 9h9 biting- 
fly season suggest that the species of Hybomitra attack man 
far more readily than those of Chrysops . This is contrary to 
the impression received by Twinn et al (32) during the season 
of 19U7.

3. 1* NOTES ON THE SPECIES 
H. metabola 

Characteristically, H. metabola was the first tabanid 
adult to put in its appearance. In 19U7 it was collected on 
July 5th, in 19U8 on June 29th, and in 19U9 on July 5th* Two 
specimens were taken on this date, one covered in pollen which 
was identified by a botanist as coming from either a species of 
Salix or of Dryas (Rosaceae). 

The flight of H. metabola is relatively soundless and 
it is possible for this species to alight on an observer 
without first broadcasting its presence by the loud humming 
so characteristic of H* affinis , zonalis, and to a lesser degree, 
septentrionalis ♦ 

H* metabola was recorded as a dominant species only 
on one day, July 17th, when it was captured in large numbers 
around a dark green shed (Fig* 16)* Thereafter the numbers 
began a gradual decline and the species was intermittently 
recorded until August 2nd* 

H. metabola is not a serious pest in the north 
nor does it attack man persistently. Not once during the 
season did the observer receive a bite although every effort 
was made to * induce 1 the species to take a blood meal* During 
the time the species was present in reasonably large numbers. 


moist limbs were left exposed and although a specimen would

alight and wander around considerably, the skin was never 
pierced* 

H* zonalis 

This was the only species that appeared In 
greater numbers than in previous years* In size, H* zonalis 
is somewhat larger than H* affinis and these two species are the 
largest present in the Churchill area* The characteristic 
banding on the posterior margins of the abdominal segments 
of H* zonalis ranges from a creamy white to a bright golden 
yellow, and it is these markings that enable one to 
distinguish this species in the field from others present in 
the north* 

In 19k7 H* zonalis was captured on July 10th but 
was not taken thereafter, and in 19H8 it appeared on July Uth 
and throughout the season a small number of specimens were 
observed* In 19U9 the species put in its appearance on July 6th 
and rapidly became dominant* However, H* zonalis does not 
remain active long, and by July 17th it had become very scarce* 
The last observation of the species was recorded on July 20* 

Like H* metabola, H* zonalis is not a serious pest 
of man in the north* No members of the group received any 
bites from either of these species* 

Generally, all species of the Tabanidae are very 
furtive when they first appear, but as the season progresses 
they become more and more interested in the presence of man*

H. zonalls is the exception to this generality. The flight is 
erratic and noisey, even more so than that of H* affinis , and 
zonal is never remains alighted on man for more than a fraction 
of a second* 

Many captures were effected simply by standing in 
front of a tar-papered frame and waving the net back and forth* 

As the flies circled the frame at great speeds it was sometimes 
possible to predict their next route and have the large insect 
net in readiness so that they flew into it. It was noted on 
several occasions that two flies were apparently playing a game 
of follow-the-leader. Often both (females) were captured at the 
same time* This behaviour is exhibited by affinis also, only 
larger numbers are involved. On one occasion five females flew 
into an awaiting net in this manner* 

H* affinis and H* gracilipalpis 

As mentioned elsewhere (See Chs.pt. II), the affinis / 
gracilipalpis complex is considered under the general heading of 
H. affinis since the author was unable to distinguish between 
the females of the two species* However, it is believed that of 
the two, E* affinis is by far the more abundant* 

This species first appeared on July 6th in 191*7, 

June 29th in 191*8, and not until July ll*th in 19l*9. The numbers 
increased rapidly until July 20th when it was by far the most 
abundant species present and continued to be so until H* septentrionalis 
became dominant*

57 


From August 2nd to 20th when affinis and septentrionalis 
were the only species of Itybomitra present as adults, affinis 
was always the first on the wing, usually appearing between 0800 
and 0900 hours and remaining dominant until mid-day, when the 
activity of septentrionalis had so Increased that it became 
dominant* 

By August 20th, H* affinls had all but disappeared, 
the tabanid fauna being represented by only one species, 

H* septentrionalis* 

H* affinis is a persi stoat attacker of man in the 
north, the bite often being extremely painful and irritating, 
and, in some individuals, a marked degree of swelling is 
evident. (Fig. 18). 

H. sept entrionalis 

This species was very late in appearing in 19k9» the 
first specimens being taken July 23rd* In previous years it was 
recorded on July l?th in 19U7, and on July Uth in 19U8. It had 
become plentiful by July 29th and was the dominant species by 
August 2nd. It retained its dominance until August 20th, when 
observations ceased, and was still veiy much in evidence on 
that date. 

Although only about one third the weight of affinis , 

(see Table 1, Page 69 ) septentrionalis is every bit as 

troublesome and its bite can be just as painful and irritating.

By virtue of its relatively silent approach, the species is able 
to land unnoticed on an exposed limb or neck. With affinis, 
septentrionalis forms a pair of blood-sucking flies -which can 
inflict heavy losses on mid animals and can seriously 
incapacitate human beings. Tales of cattle being stampeded and, 
in northern latitudes of husky dogs actually being killed by 
the voraciousness of tabanid attacks, are not without foundation. 

During the height of tabanid activity in 19h9 s the 
observer was able to watch affinis and septentrionalis attack 
huskies which were tethered to trees. Up to six flies would be 
biting at the same time despite frantic pawing and grovelling, 
and within a very short time the areas above and between the 
eyes and around the ears were matted with blood. Only when the 
dogs* master alleviated their sufferings with a copious dose of 
pine tar and lard could they settle down, although they were 
still harassed by the persistent buzzing of H. affinis . The 
most troublesome of the two species as far as biting was 
concerned was septentrionalis . Throughout the season this 
species also proved to be the most persistent attacker of man. 

Portchinsky (21;) has reported for Tabanus montanus, 

T. maculicomis, and Chrysops spp., the habit of skimming and 
dipping proboscides in the water. About five times as many males 
as females were observed in this activity. In 19U8 H. septentrionalis 
was observed in a similar activity, but, in this species, the

females were observed and the activity consisted of a 
continuous flight about 3-U inches above the water, with 
occasional stops, when the flies drop momentarily, or sometimes 
for an interval of a number of seconds, on to the surface of 
the water* 

The males of this species are probably often overlooked 
for their flight habits are very similar to those of the 
Syrphidae and they can easily be mistaken for the latter* They 
have a curious habit of hovering from a few inches above the 
ground to a height of approximately 18 feet, making sudden 
darting motions forward so rapidly that one can scarcely follow 
their flight* The male of H* septentrionalis is about the 
same size as the female* Only the lower half of the eye is 
barred horizontally* 

H. itasca - Reared only in the insectary. 

Hybomitra sp. (new?) - Reared only in the insect ary* 

Atylotus ohioensis - Reared only in the insectary* 

C* furcata 

On July 20th, two specimens of G* furcata were taken* 
This species was captured on the same date in 19k7$ and in 
19U8 on July Hth, considerably earlier. 

Although never very plentiful, C. furcata was by far 
the most abundant species represented in the genus* It 
remained dominant until August lj?th, although it was the only one 
present on August 20th, when again it was the dominant species*

C. frigida 

This northern transcontinental species has always 
been accepted as unusually variable in size and color ( 23 )* 

It was first taken on July 29th and the last specimen observed 
was August 5th. Taken on July 13th in 19U7 and on July 7th in 
19U8. 

C. nigripes 

First taken on July 29th and remained In approximately 
equal numbers with G. frigida until August 5th. It had established 
itself as the dominant Ghrysops species in the field by August l5th. 
No specimens were captured or seen after this date. This species 
was taken on July 13th in 19U7 and on the same date in 19h$. 

C. carbonaria 

In 19H7 this species was first taken on July 12th and 
remained present in the fauna until August 12th when observations 
ceased that year. It was the most abundant species up until near 
the end of July. In 19U8 it was taken on July 7th and had been 
recorded intermittently throughout the season*s observations. 

However, in 19k9 only one specimen was captured and this one on 
July 29th. (not recorded in Fig. 17). 

Species of Ghrysops were so few in number during the 1 9h9 
season that their presence could scarcely be considered as 
annoying. No members of the group were bitten although investigators 
in 19U8 received bites»

3. 2. PLANTS FED UPON 

Relatively little is known of this subject owing to 
the difficulties encountered while endeavoring to make 
observations# The Tabanidae, as a group, are very restless 
and furtive so that if an investigator is fortunate enough to 
observe a specimen on a plant it is extremely unlikely that he 
will be able to ascertain whether the insect is feeding or merely 
resting, before his presence has resulted in a hasty flight* 

A number of specimens of H. affinis and H# septentrionalis 
was captured early in the season, all literally covered with 
pollen. These could easily have been mistaken for different 
species for their bodies were yellow-white in color. The pollen 
grains, mounted in euparal, were identified by Miss L* Kennedy, 
Department of Botany, University of Alberta, as Salix sp. and 
Ledum sp. respectively. 

There is no doubt that the tabanids db feed on nectar 
and probably in this area the vast majority taste nothing else 
in their lifetime. Many specimens of both H# affinis and H. 
septentrionalis were captured and found to be completely 
engorged. On dissection it was found that the entire abdomens were 
filled to capacity with a clear viscous fluid# Mien rubbed 
between the fingers this fluid was sticky and it was also sweet 
to the taste, suggesting nectar. A positive test for reducing 
sugars was obtained with Benedicts solution. Mien a recently 
fed insect is dissected, the nectar is found to be confined into 











a small clear blob by the delicate peritrophic membrane. 

Many of these blobs were taken from the abdomens of engorged 
females and placed on a piece of paper. Other females were 
immediately attracted to them and, piercing the membrane with 
their mouthparts, soon had the nectar sucked up, 

3* 3. MATING 

Mating was not observed in any of the tabanid 
species in 19k9 but three occurrences were recorded in 19U8, 

The pairs were in copula during flight and lucky sweeps of 
the net resulted in the capture of two of the pairs, both 
being H, gracilipalpis . The other pair, believed to be 
H. affinis, was observed on July 11th, Mating took place on 
the wing over water in open woods. The individuals remained 
connected for some £ seconds while flying from low over the 
water to a considerable height. They then separated and 
flew off individually, 

3. lu BLOOD MEALS 

Some time elapses after emergence before the 
female exhibits any tendency to take a blood meal from man, 

H. af finis, which was first observed in the field on July lUth, 
did not bite until July 2i;th, although 8 days of adult activity 
were recorded between these dates. Similarly H, septentrionalis , 
which was first observed in the field on July 23rd, did not bite 
until July 3^th, Five days of adult activity were recorded

between these dates# Possibly the period would be somewhat 
lessened if weather conditions were consistently favorable# 

Food during this interval appears to be obtained from flowers 
or wild animals# 

When in captivity, little inclination to feed is 
shown. A. moist forearm inserted into a cage containing 
captured females, goes completely unnoticed# However they 
would consume a droplet of water placed on the floor of the 
cage# 

The effects of a tabanid bite vary with individuals. 
Some members of the group were not bitten at all, while other 
members were continually ‘tapped* for blood meals# Biting 
would cause noticeable swelling and irritation in one person 
while little or no effect would be experienced by another# 
Generally speaking, it was found by this observer that during 
the time the mouthparts were inserted, quite an acute pain was 
felt but no after-effects were e^p erienced until 1*8 hours later 
when intense irritation started which lasted for 2 or 3 days# 

In most instances a droplet of blood was left over the 
punctured area# The common observation that considerably la ss 
irritation is experienced if a tabanid is allowed to finish a 
blood meal is not supported by personal experience# In every 
case, the irritation has been far more excessive when the fly 
was allowed to complete its blood meal than when it was

swatted away as soon as the sting was felt* The effects of 
bites of H* affinis on three different individuals are 
cited below: 

1* A bite was received on the palm-side of the 
third finger of the right hand between the first and second 
joints. A slight pain was experienced as the mouthparts were 
inserted and 30 seconds later a much more intense pain. Mouth- 
parts were inserted for 3 minutes and £0 seconds, and when 
withdrawn, a large drop of blood was left over the area. Within 
5 minutes of receiving the bite the finger was noticeably 
swollen. One half hour later, the swelling had spread and was 
obvious around the second and third joints on the back of the 
finger. An hour later, the entire hand up to the wrist had 
swollen to one half again its normal size. At this time the 
hand became very itchy* 

The following morning the swelling had spread up to 
the elbow and the whole arm had become abnormally large (Fig* 18). 
Soreness was reported around the knuckle joints and irritation 
along the entire length of the forearm. The individual sought 
medical attention the same morning and within two days* time the 
arm and hand were back to normal. 

No other individuals who were bitten throughout the 
season suffered such discomfort and swelling as this* It may be 
significant to note that the blood of the man in question belongs 
in the “A” group.

2. This investigator was pierced twice by the 
same female (this is often the case, occasionally three or 
four insertions are made before the blood meal is completed). 
Sharp pain was felt as soon as the mouthparts were inserted but 
thereafter no discomfort in the form of swelling or itching was 
experienced# There was no noticeable marking on the skin until 
an hour after the bite was received and then a small red wheal 
appeared surrounded by an area of blueness# The se effects 
persisted for 3 days and disappeared# This bite was received 
on the inside of the forearm of an individual whose blood 
grouping is "O' 1 # 

3# A female H# affini s was captured inside a small 
shed (Fig. 16) and placed on the leg approximately 6 inches 
below the knee of the third observer* Within a minute the fly 
had made its first of two insertions* Prior to puncturing the 
skin, the female fed gone through a ritual of feeling the skin 
with the fore-tarsi and tip of the proboscis# The tarsi were 
rubbed together, beginning at the fifth segment, then along the 
inside, to the bases of the tibiae# This procedure was repeated 
five or six times and gave the observer the odd impression of 
a hungry man rubbing his hands together In anticipation of 
indulging in a well-prepared meal# During the procedure the 
forelegs were often raised over the fe ad and the inside of the 
tibiae brought forward and down over the eyes and continuing down, 
rubbing the antennae*

The mouth parts were inserted for only 20 seconds 
In the first area, then removed and inserted Into the second 
area for 3 minutes and 1*8 seconds, where the entire meal was 
taken. A sharp pain was felt as soon as the mouth parts were 
inserted, followed by a very acute pain, sufficient to cause 
wincing, between 25 and 1*0 seconds later. This acute pain 
lasted for 15 to 20 seconds after which time there was no further 
discomfort felt as the adult completed her meal. No visible mark 
was left on the skin from this bite but a drop of blood 
remained over the area. 

Twenty-four hours later, a red wheal approximately 
one inch in diameter had appeared and the whole area had become 
extremely itchy. The wheal increased in diameter to approximately 
2 inches and itchiness continued off and on for a period of a 
week. No swelling occurred. 

The observer, whose blood grouping is "O", received 
many bites throughout the season, and in all cases the results 
were almost the same as described above, with slight variations 
in time. There was little difference experienced between the 
bites of H. affinis and H* s eptentrionalis . 

When viewed with the aid of a hand lens, a biting 
tabanid presents a forbidding sight. The labella is spread to 
such an extent that the bottom of the head is almost touching 
the skin. On either side of the labella the palpi keep tapping, 
and on either side of the palpi the forelegs are braced, all.

the tarsal segments resting on the skin. With each contraction 
of the powerful pharyngeal muscles the entire abdomen heaves 
and distends. 

The connective membrane between the abdominal tergites 
and sternites is not visible in a non-engorged female, but once 
the fly has become completely engorged, this membrane is clearly 
visible and stretched almost to the apparent point of bursting. 
"When fully engorged, the abdomen is so heavy that is touches the 
surface over which the fly is walking, and if the female is thrown 
into the air, forward flight is impossible, so awkward and weighty 
has she become. This statement applies to both H. affinis and 
H. s eptentrionalis 

Once the mouthparts have been inserted and partaking 
of the blood meal begun, one may walk around, gently wave the 
arms, place an empty bottle over the female, but unless 
something of more violent nature is done, the fly will not 
release her hold. More time appeaxs to be required if the blood 
meal is sought, for example, over the shin, than if the meal is 
sought from a more fleshy part of the boc^r, e.g. the neck. 

It will be seen from an examination of Table 1 
at 

the affinis is able to more than double its original weight 
by engorging completely, vhile H. septentrionalis is able to 
consume only slightly less than one half her own body weight.

10 hours would lose approximately 75 milliliters of blood if 
bites were received at the rate of 50 per hcur* (Specific 
gravity of cow 1 s blood is approximately 1*055)* Similarly 
cattle stand to lose approximately 13 milliliters of blood from 
the attacks of H. septentrionalis under the same circumstances* 

These last data do not agree with those obtained by 
Cameron (5) for H* septentrionalis, who found that each specimen 
could engorge approximately 0*2 cc* of blood, nearly ten times 
the amount recorded in our observations* In point of fact, our 
observations show that H. affinis, which is a considerably larger 
species than H* septentrionalis, engorges only Q*l5 millilitres, 
some 0.05 millilitres less than Cameron 8 s observations for 
septentrionalis 

3* 5* EGGS 

Search for the egg masses of Tabanidae was 
conducted throughout the adult season and during the latter 
part of August, to the exclusion of other activities, no egg 
masses were found although vegetation surrounding known larval 
habitats was searched thoroughly. The following possible 
explanations are reservedly put forward: 

1* That only the ovaries of those females which have 
partaken of a blood meal become fully developed and produce a 
full complement of viable eggs* If this statement were true, 
egg masses would be extremely rare owing to the fact that in all 








iyi&j '< 




rv:.)S 











71 


probability only a very small fraction of the female 
population ever receive a blood meal. The chances of 
locating the masses would be correspondingly remote* 

2* That only a small fraction of the eggs present 
in females that feed exclusively on nectar are laid. On days 
when adults were on the wing, females were dissected to note 
the condition of the developing eggs. One would expect to 
find a gradual change to fully developed eggs as the season 
progressed but this was not so. Dissections of one specimen of 
H. septentrionalis revealed two large cigar-shaped eggs with 
developed chorion whilst the remaining eggs were still very 
undeveloped in the ovaries. It is possible that under such 
conditions, the eggs would be laid singly, or in pairs* 

Specimens of H. affinis which had received a blood 
meal and caged for possible oviposition, were later dissected* 
There was a remarkable difference in the development of the 
eggs of these specimens and those of the specimens captured 
in the field on the same dsgr* The eggs of the blood-fed females 
were cigar-shaped and all about equal in size to one another, 
while those of the field-captured females were still very 
undeveloped with the exception, in one instance, of one large 
completely developed egg. 

3* Since investigators in 19U7, 19U8, and 19k9 have 
failed to locate the egg masses, one might assume that the masses 
of these northern species are not laid on pond vegetation, etc..

where those of other species are normally found# The eggs 
could be deposited in, or on the moss, where the hatched 
larvae would be in a damp environment# Eggs laid singly in 
moss, of course, would be next to impossible to find# 

Egg counts from dissected females are recorded in 

Table 2. 

3. 6# CORRELATION OF ADULT ACTIVITY WITH WEATHER 

Adverse weather conditions prevailed throughout 
these observations# Adult activity was recorded on only 23 
out of I4.6 days, and on many of these days, ceased after 1 or 

2 hours# 

The graphs in Figs# 19 and 20 were drawn from data 
recorded on U days — July 31st, August 2nd, August 15th, and 
August 20th# To obtain comparative numbers of adults on the 
wing throughout the day, the door of a dark-green shed (Fig# 16) 
was left open for 1$ minutes out of every hour# The flies 
swarmed around the shed and many of them entered the open door 
and congregated on the windows inside# During the 1$ minutes 
that the door was open, temperature, light, and wet and dry - bulb 
thermometer readings were taken# The next U5 minutes were spent 
inside the shed catching the flies with a killing bottle and 
recording the species# 

It will be seen from a study of the graphs that 
maximum activity was recorded when the temperature was between

68°F and 73°F, the saturation deficiency was between 9 and 12 mms. 
of Hg., and light was between 6000 and 7500 lumens/sq* ft*. 
However, this last figure represents only one observation* More 
adults were active between 0900 hours and 1200 hours, the 
largest numbers being recorded between lOOQhours and 1200 hours. 
From midday on, there is a gradual decline in numbers until 
1800 hours when the numbers begin to decline* After 1800 
hours temperature and light readings fall off rapidly. 

Graphs (Fig. 20) comparing the adult activity of 
H. affinis with H. septentrionalis show that the former is an 
early morning-late afternoon species, while the latter is a 
late morning-early afternoon species. The total numbers remain 
fairly constant from 0900 hours to 1800 hours but the composition 
of the species varies from hour to hour. Similar graphs were 
obtained when the numbers of H. af finis and H* septentrionalis 
were plotted against temperature, saturation deficiency, and 
light intensity. 

While H* affinis and H. septentrionalis dominated 
the tabanid fauna throughout the day, other species were 
present in varying numbers. The percentage of these species 
present is given in Table 3«

the turning reactions of plants. The modem term 1 taxis* is

used for directed orientation reactions. Thus positive and 
negative photo-taxis mean respectively movement straight 
towards or straight away from the light. Similarly, the terms 
photopositive and photonegative would mean assembly in light 
or dark areas respectively, regardless of the mechanism by 
which this was brought about. This more recent terminology is 
adopted here. 

It is common knowledge that tabanids are lovers of 
sunlight and they are attracted* to moving or stationary 
vehicles. Any one who has gone swimming in a pool or stream 
in the vicinity of horseflies or deerflies knows that their 
attacks are far more persistent when the body is wet. We run 
into difficulties however, when we attempt to explain these 
phenomena. 

No satisfactory answer can yet be given why tabanids 
collect around darkened objects to such an extent that hundreds 
of specimens can be captured in a few minutes. Since the response 
is toward an area of reduced Illuminati on, it is therefore 
photonegative. On the other hand, once inside an area of low 
intensity, a shed for instance, the tabanids congregate on the 
windows in an apparent attempt to escape. This response is 
toward an area of high intensity and is therefore photopositive. 

So here we have evidence of an insect being photonegative in 
high illumination and photopositive in low illumination. 





{ 











79 


Due to heat radiated from a darkened object, it 
seems probable that the temperature surrounding the object 
would be slightly higher than it would be some distance away* 

If the former temperature was nearer the temperature for 
optimum activity for the particular species* the numbers of 
the species in the immediate vicinity would congregate in 
the higher temperature surrounding the object. But this 
does not explain tabanids coming considerable distances toward 
the stimulus* Heat would be radiated for a matter of only a 
few feet away from the object* 

However it would appear that the combination of 
temperature and light are important factors for the flies are 
seldom seen in any numbers on the shady-side of a building 
where the temperature and light is reduced. Nevertheless, 
a few flies do collect on the shady side* 

A possible explanation for the flight toward a darkened 
object may lie in the fact that the object does not conform in 
shape with the tabanids normal environment and this difference 
in shape may excite the 1 curiosity* of the insect to such an 
extent as to stimulate locomotary activity towards the object* 

3* 7* FIELD EMERGENCES 

In order to obtain information on adult populations* 
sex ratios* and to obtain the males of tabanid species* ten 
frames* each measuring 6 feet in length* 3 feet in width, and 







e. 


j 










. • : 











80 


3 feet in height "were constructed of 2 in* by 2 in* lumber* 

Each frame was then covered with cheesecloth along the sides, 
ends and on the top* The bottom 6 inches of each comer peg 
vras sharpened to a point to facilitate anchoring the cage into 
the ground* 

In one comer of each cage a small opening vras left 
about 18 H by 12 n which was covered with a lid* 119hen collecting 
the flies, the lid was removed and replaced by a smaller cage, 
which just fitted into the comer opening* Selected sites 

l 

were chosen representing various known larva# habitats and 
the cages then driven into these areas* Small furrows, slightly 
more than 2 inches wide and 6 inches deep were dug along the 
length and width of the bottom to enable the cage to be well 
sunk so that adults could not escape through the bottom* 

Once in place, the possibility of adults escaping was further 
minimized by banking the sides and ends with moss* 

Advantage was taken of the photopositive reactions 
of the adult flies to effect their capture once they had 
emerged into the large cages. At first, five large, dark 
army blankets were draped over the entire cage so an to 
completely darken the interior* A hole was cut in one of the 
blankets to allow the smaller cage to fit into position* 

Once the large cage was darkened and the smaller cage, 
constructed of transparent plastic, was in position, it was 




















81 


only a matter of 5 to 10 minutes before all flies had 
become concentrated -within the smaller, light cage* Capture 
was completed by sliding a piece of plastic into grooves 
along the bottom of the smaller cage* The emergence of the 
flies into the smaller cage was hastened by gently tapping the 
sides, ends, and top of the larger cage with an insect net, 
(Fig* 23). Once inside, the insects were chloroformed, 
returned to the laboratory, pinned and labelled* 

The use of army blankets to drape over the cages 
was found to be impractical because they were very bulky, 
and allowed a certain amount of light through. To obviate 
these difficulties a one-piece canopy of black, water-proof 
canvas was later made* 

Five areas where larvae were found during the early 
days of June were chosen in which to place the cages* The 
vegetative ground cover for each area, as described by Mr* 
Peter Kyde, Defense Research Board, on August 2nd is given 
below* 

Area 1. Point 90U065, Fig* 21* 

A flat, somewhat marshy area with numerous small 
mossy hummocks and saturated depressions* Larix laricina 
(Du Roi) Koch (tamarack) and Betula glandulosa Michx* 
(Betulaceae) (glandular birch), were the common trees in the 
immediate vicinity*

emergence of U8l|0 tabanids per acre, or approximately 3 
millions per square mile, of apparently suitable larval habitat. 
There were 2 cages in which no adults emerged. This figure is 
rather on the conservative side for the following reasons: 

1. It is believed that adults did escape through 
the bottoms of the cages. As the season progressed, the moss 
which was used to bank the sides and ends became very dry, and 
on particularly windy days, much of this moss was blown away 
leaving possible exits for the flies. To obviate this 
difficulty, cages constructed for future work of this nature 
should have the bottom 6 inches along the sides and ends 
enclosed with a metal or wood strip. This portion of the 
cage would be submerged and banking would not be necessary. 

2. The escape of adults could also have been 
possible through holes in the cheesecloth caused by snagging 
and rotting. An added disadvantage of the use of cheesecloth 
is that tipulids get tangled easily which makes their 
collection difficult. 

3. The no rt hi and muskeg abounds with predatory 
spiders of all descriptions and sizes. On numerous occasions 
they were present inside the cages and had woven webs in the 
comers. The actual feeding of a spider on a tabanid adult inside 
a cage was not witnessed, but on two separate occasions the 
observer watched spiders attack, and devour large anthomyids.

It is quite possible too, that the very common lemming, 
Dicrostonyx groenlandicus (Merriam), could, destroy numbers 
of adults as the latter shelter in the moss* In captivity, 
lemmings will devour up to 20 prof erred tabanids* 

The numbers of the various species emerging into 
the cages were too small to arrive at a sex ratio* 

For further work along these lines it is suggested 
that fewer but larger cages be used. The number of enclosed 
areas would largely depend on the number of men available 
but the area enclosed by each cage should not be less than 
10 square yards. A different method of collecting the 
emergences would have to be devised but this should present no 
insurmountable difficulty* A light trap might be utilized or 
perhaps catwalks inside the cage would provide the answer. Of 
course, not only emergences of tabanids but all emergences 
should be kept to obtain associations* To ensure that small 
insects did not escape, it is suggested that a 26-mesh wire 
or plastic screening be used instead of cheesecloth. 

Other dipterous and hymenopterous emergences are 


recorded in Tables 5, 6 and 7

Insectary Rearing 


One of the main objects during the 19U9 season 
was to rear larvae in the insectary and to associate the 
emerged adults with their last larval exuviae and pupal skins. 
Insectary rearings would also determine the length of 
life cycle. 

1. METHOD EMPLOYED 

The technique evolved was the result of trial and 
error coupled with the knowledge of successes recorded by 
other students of tabanids. Larvae collected in the field 
were brought to the insectary and placed in individual 
containers. 

One of the main difficulties experienced was that 
of the larvae escaping through the cheesecloth covers. 

Although the cheesecloth was folded several times, it was 
still possible for the smaller larvae to worm their way through 
the mesh and escape. The larvae are active during the night, 
remaining embedded in the moss during the day. On numerous 
occasions larvae were found dead in the morning, having 
become entangled in the mesh during the night. In order to 
obviate this difficulty, small squares of ply wood were cut 
and placed over the mouths of the containers, but larvae still 
escaped. Frequently winds during the night would shake the walls 
and shelves of the metal insectary (Fig. 26) sufficiently to

dislodge these wooden tops. Finally, U oz. and 8 oz. 
specimen jars with metal screw tops solved this problem; 
having no neck constriction it was relatively easy to remove 
the moss for examination. Sealers were too large and 
occupied too much space* Larvae did not have sufficient room 
for activity when reared in 60 cc. test tubes. Three hundred 
larvae were reared and each larva was given a number* Date 
collected, size, color, etc., were recorded for each larva, 
and as the season progressed, changes in appearance, the date 
of pupation, and any other relevant information was noted. 

These data are recorded in Table 8. Vi/hen pupation occurred, 
the moss was searched for the last larval excuvium, which was 
preserved in an alcohol-glycerin mixture in a small shell-vial* 
"When the adult emerged, the pupal skin was transferred to the 
same shell-vial and was identified by labelling with the 
number of the original larva. 

2. MORTALITY 

When a larva died, it was preserved and replaced by 
a healthy specimen so that throughout the rearing experiment 
300 larvae were constantly under observation. Larval 
mortality was attributed to four causes: 

i. Natural mortality 

ii. Mortality resulting from rough handling. Usually 
the larva was easily seen in the specimen jar but occasionally 
it became embedded in a small clod of moss and was extremely

difficult to find* On such an occasion the larva 
was easily injured. 

iii. Predation - High mortality occurred when 
rearings were first begun owing to the practice of feeding 
a species of cranefly larvae to all tabanid larvae. Whilst 
these proved to be an ideal food for the voracious larvae of 
ifybomitra spp.* they themselves preyed on the larvae of 
Chrysops spp.. Ten of the latter were segregated in individual 
rearing jars and 10 tipulid larvae were added* one to each jar. 
Within a matter of minutes the tipulid larvae attacked their 
prey and soon had them incapacitated. Twenty-four hours later* 

7 of the tabanid larvae had been entirely devoured and the 
remaining 3 were so badly mutilated as to be unrecognizable. 

All the tipulid larvae had noticeably Increased in size. 

Adult specimens of this tipulid species were sent to 
Dr. C. P. Alexander (l)* Massachusetts Agricultural College* 
Amherst* who identified them as Prionocera dimidiata Lw* (Fig. 2?). 
Hitherto the larvae of the Tipulini* In which tribe these species 
belongs* have not been considered carnivorous. 

Larvae of P. dimidiata were sent to Dr. J. S. Rogers (25) 
University of Michigan* for descriptive purposes since no 
description exists of the immature stages of any species of 
Prionocera . 

It is significant to note that in the field, Chrysops 
larvae were seldom found In any numbers where tipulid larvae

were plentiful* The predatory habit of the larvae of 
P. dimidi at a j along with its abundance could account for 
the relative paucity of Chiysops as compared to Hybomitra 
at Church i ll. 

iv. Fungal Growth- On a few occasions it was noted 
in the insectaiy rearings that larvae and pupae supported an 
apparent fungal growth. In every instance the specimen 
subsequently died. This cause of mortality was obviated by 
soaking the moss in a 1 percent solution of iMoldex*, a 
proprietary fungicide. This treatment had no noticeable effects 
on larvae or pupae. 

Throughout the season, 37 out of 123 Ghrysops spp., 
and 11 out of 127 Hybomitra spp. larvae, died whilst in 
rearing. This represents a mortality of 30 and 6 percent 
respectively. The high mortality of Ghrysops spp. was due 
primarily to the losses suffered by predation at the 
beginning of the season. 

3. LARVAL FOOD 

As previously indicated, tipulid larvae served 
ideally as food for Dybomitra spp.. Tipulid larvae were 
encountered in the field in the ratio of approximately 3 
tipulids to 1 tabanid larva. These were all retained and fed 
to the Hybomitra spp. at the rate of one per day. Later in 
the season, when tipulid larvae were becoming increasingly 
















>

■f 






difficult to obtain, a substitute had to be found. Sluggish 
streams and stagnant pools abounded in snails, Limnaca and 


Physa spp., and these proved to be most acceptable. It was 
possible to collect 200-300 snails in 2 hours using an 
ordinary kitchen sieve and sweeping through the water. The 
snails were kept in an improvised aquarium and fed to the 
tabanid larvae as required. By twisting and turning their 
bodies, Hybomitra spp. larvae are able to get well inside even 
a small shell, and completely empty it. 

Hybomibra spp. were observed feeding on annelids 
and slugs but these were so difficult to find that no serious 
attempt was made to obtain them for routine feeding purposes. 

On rare occasions, Hybomitra larvae were observed 
taking a meal of raw beef and liver yrhich was proffered, but 
generally speaking, the larvae require living material. The 
few larvae which would partake of a raw meat meal could be 
easily distinguished from those which did not by the deep 
red coloration of the gut contents showing through the 
integument. A further disadvantage in feeding larvae raw 
meat is that decomposition gives a foul odor to the container. 

Chrysops larvae required very little attention. 


Cameron (5) found that these larvae require a soil medium rich 
in decaying organic material for successful growth* The same 
statement can be made for the northern species, substituting 























^oss' for ’soil*. Very few deaths occurred if the moss 
was periodic^. ly changed, and at the end of observations 
for the season, all larvae appeared to be healthy. 

The amount of food given each larva varied 
considerably. During the month of June, one tipulid larva 
or one snail was given to each Hybomitra larva per day but 
as the season progressed into July and August, when these 
sources of food became relatively scarce, this ration was 
reduced. It later appeared that this ration was far in excess 
of their normal requirements; larvae thus fed, became fat and 
sluggish and moulting apparent3.y was retarded. The ration was 
reduced to 2 snails per week per larva beginning the first 
week in July and this proved to be ample. By the beginning 
of August, 1 snail per larva per week met the food 
requirements and this was continued without any visible 
ill-effects until the season ended. 

Tabanid larvae generally are very hardy and not 
difficult to rear. An incident which bears out this remark 
is worth mentioning. A field-collected hybomitra sp. larva, 
probably H. septentrionalis, which had been placed in a small 
shell-vial with a moist quantity of moss, was inadvertently 
left in the living quarters at Fort Churchill. The larva did 
not receive any food or water. Seven weeks later this larva 
was still alive and apparently suffering no ill-effects from 
its long fast. This larva was also subjected to temperature 
ranging between k3 and 8£°F.

U. PARASITES 

Parasitism of tabanid pupae was suspected early in 
the season when empty pupal skins of both Hybomitra spp. and 
Chrysops spp. were found with numerous small holes throughout 
their lengths* Dissections of pupae suspected of being 
parasitized (parasitized pupae become darker much faster than 
non-parasitized pupae) produced numerous larvae of the 
Chalcidoidea* These larvae were too small for further 
identification* The entire thoracic and body cavities of 
the pupae were filled to capacity* Later in the season, 90 
small chalcids emerged from a single Hybomitra sp* pupa which 
was in rearing at the insectary* These were identified by 
Dr # 0* Peck, Systematic Unit, Division of Entomology, as 
Diglochis Occidentalis Ashm* (Pteromalidae)• Hitherto, this 
species has not been recorded as a parasite of Hybomitra spp* 
pupae, although Cameron (5) reared it from C* moerens, mitis, 
and excitans * 

Up until the time that the parasites began 
emerging from insectary-reared material it had been assumed 
that the parasitism occurred only in the pupa* However this 
assumption had to be discarded since the chalcids emerged from 
pupae, the larvae of which had been collected in early June, when 
the adult insect fauna in northern latitudes is practically nil. 
Furthermore, the larvae and pupae were kept in sealed jars, 
making entrance of a female chalcid impossible* 














103 


The assumption is made that the parasite lays her 
eggs in a larva during the latter part of the summer. The 
■winter is passed in the host larva either in the egg or very 
young larval stage. Apparently this parasitism does not 
Effect the growing tabanid larva, or if it does, no evidence 
was found in the field to support this, A few dead larvae 
were found in the field but upon dissection it was shown 
that death resulted from causes other than parasitism. Once 
the larva had pupated it was just a matter of a few days 
before the parasites had devoured the contents of the pupa. 

In the insectary, pupae were left in the same moss 
in which the larvae were reared. Many of the adults emerging 
were in poor condition owing to the fact that the moss was too 
moist, and the adult was not afforded an opportunity to 
become dry. This condition was suitably altered by transferring 
newly fomed pupae to dry, or slightly moist moss. Thereafter, 
all adults emerged in good condition, 

5. EFFECT OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS ON DEVELOPMENT 

Although it is desirable to simulate as nearly as 
possible the natural environment of the immature stages, it is 
obviously impossible to duplicate this exactly. Constant handling, 
confinement, different food supply, and temperatures are some of 
the more important factors which must apply in the insectary.

Daily maximum and minimum temperatures were 
recorded inside the insectary and U inches below the surface 
of moss in the field* Five-day averages were computed and the 
results are shown in Fig* 28* The average mean daily temperature 
In the insectary was 9*5°F higher than the average mean daily 
temperature U inches below the moss* 

Of the h important factors considered, larvae are 
affected by all* Larval development of Chrysops spp* in the 
insectary apparently is not retarded by the difference in 
conditions for pupae were first found in the field on June 27th 
and pupation in the Insectary occurred on the same day* A 
Hybomitra spp* pupa, on the other hand, was first found in the 
field on June 21st and in the insectary pupation did not occur 
until June 30th* 

However, of the factors considered, pupae are 
Effected by only temperature, and handling to a lesser degree* 

G. nigripes was obtained in the insectary in more than double 
the combined numbers of the other species of Chrysops, so that 
it is probable that the pupa found on June 27th was of this 
species* If this were so, it would indicate a pupal stage lasting 
33 days, in the field, for the first adult of this species was 
not seen until July 29 th. The mean duration of the pupal stage 
for C. nigripes in the insectary was 17 days. Similarly, the 
Hybomitra sp* pupa found in the field on June 21st was 


probably H* septentrionalis and the adult of this species was 









. 




■) v x . r:.r/, 9.110 




















first observed on July 23rd. This indicates a pupal 
stage lasting 33 days in the field as compared to 23 days 
in insectary rearings. 

6. CVER1/VINTERING 

Of the 30° larvae originally in the insectary, 
by August 18th, 199 were still in the larval stage. Since 
the last pupation was recorded on August 2nd, these 
remaining larvae were caged and buried in a suitable area. 

The cage measured 6 ! by 3* by 1* and was constructed of 

2” by 2 n lumber and covered with a #28 mesh plastic screening* 

Tlhen completed, the cage was placed in a hole in 
the tundra (Fig. 29), and then filled ?d.th vegetation which 
had previously been picked over for larvae, ffibomitra spp. 
larvae were segregated from those of Chrysops sp. by a 
partition to avoid predation. In 19^0 these larvae, if they 
survive the winter under such conditions, will provide 
sufficient numbers to carry on the study of life cycles and 


larval habitats

Chemical Control 

The nature of the breeding places renders it 
extremely difficult to control the immature stages by chemical 
means. The larvae, being mainly subterranean, are insulated 
from the immediate effects of aerial spraying — the only 
practical means of large scale insecticide application in 
the north. An insecticide, falling on saturated moss would 
tend to remain on the surface; penetration being prevented to 
a large extent by the lack of water circulation in the moss* 

The success of any material used as a tabanid larvicide will 
depend on its ability to reach the larvae below the ground 
surface or to bring the larvae to the surface where they will 
come in contact with the toxic principles* Three materials 
reputed to have the latter property were tested. The results 
are recorded below* 

1. MATERIAL TESTED TO BRING LARVAE TO THE SURFACE 
1.1* Bailey 1 s Formula (2) consisting of 65 percent deodorized 
kerosene, 0*035 percent pyrethrins, 0*1 percent thiodiphenylamine, 
0.5 percent Triton X-100 and 3U percent water. One square metre 
of apparent larval habitat was treated with 1 part of the mixture 
in 20 parts of pool water at k litres to the square metre. 

After 30 minutes no obvious emergence of larvae had taken place. 

A detailed examination however revealed one tipulid pupa, one small 
dipterous larva (not tabanid), and several blackfly adults — all 
apparently affected by the solution. Blackflies apparently seek 


shelter in the moss

A second square metre near the first was treated 
with twice the quantity at half the strength. Examination 
30 minutes later revealed no surfaced organisms. 

A third square, somewhat wetter than the previous 
two, was treated with 8 litres at 1 part in 80 parts of water. 
Examination after 30 minutes revealed no surfaced organisms. 

A pupa was found about 1 Inch below the surface from which 
an H. affinis female emerged one week later. 

1.2. One square yard of waterlogged larval habitat situated 
at the edge of a small pool was treated with a 0.3 percent solution 
of orthodichlorobenzene applied at 2 gallons per square yard. 
Examinations were carried out 5 minutes, 30 minutes, and 1 
hour after application but no organisms had surfaced. Five 
tabanid larvae were found approximately 3 Inches below the 
surface — all apparently unaffected by the treatment. 

A second square yard was treated using the same 
strength but applied at h gallons per square yard. Observations 
carried out as In the first application revealed 2 tipulid 
larvae only. Although very inactive when found, they soon 
seemed to lose all effects of the treatment. No tabanid 
larvae could be found in this area.

2. CHEMICALS TESTED AGAINST LARVAE 
2.1* 25 PERCENT DDT EMULSION CONCENTRATE 

Larvae used in this test were collected May 16th in 
a swamp area 3 miles west of the Edmonton city limits* Many 
larvae were found on the edge of a small pool bordered by 
spruce and large trees, (Fig. 30, upper). Fifteen larvae were 
taken from a small hummock not more than 1 foot square, which 
projected 5 inches above the water level. The edge of a much 
larger pool (Fig. 30, lower) yielded 35 larvae in 2 hours. The 
larvae were found just above the water line in decaying organic 
debris^ there was no moss here. Larvae were also found in 
decaying, prostrate bulrush stems, and under fallen wood, in 
one instance in an old buprestid tunnel. Some of these larvae 
were reared and all adults, except one, were identified as 
C. furcata. The exception was Atylotus bicolor Wied., a 
new record for this area. 

Sixty larvae were used in the insecticide tests and 
the results are diown in Table 9. A *dip method*, less 
elaborate than that of McIntosh (38), was used in this test. 
Larvae were placed in I4 oz, specimen jars with cheesecloth 
coverings and then immersed in the solution. Water used to 
dilute the emulsion concentrate was obtained from the pools in 
the areas where larvae were found. This water had a pH of 6.5 
and at the time of testing, the temperature was 61*°F. During the 
time of immersion the solution was agitated continually. The

check batch was immersed in plain slough water. All 
batches remained equally active for the first 5 minutes 
but from then on activity gradually decreased, particularly 
in the higher concentrations, until at the end of the 
experiment only 2 larvae were moving in the solution containing 
16000 ppm. On examination it was found that in some the 
oral hooks were in constant, but slow motion, while in others 
the gut could be seen contracting and expanding# 

All larvae were rinsed in slough water at the 
completion of the experiment and individually segregated in 
test-tubes containing moist moss# 

2# 2# On August 7th, a 25 percent parathion wettable powder, 
(Thiophos 3U22), was tested against 19 larvae at 250 ppm 
parathion* These larvae were brought to Edmonton from 
Churchill# During immersion larvae in the check and treated 
batch were equally active. Results are given in Table 9# 

3. DDT AGAINST PUPAE 

Throughout the season at Churchill, larvae which 
were not used in the actual rearing experiment were reared 
through to the pupal stage for insecticide tests# The same 
dip method was employed. Before being immersed all pupae 
were apparently lifeless but as soon as their bodies came in 
contact with the liquid they suddenly became active and 
remained so throughout the experiment# Results of this test

are shown in Table 10, and although the number of pupae 
involved in the test is very small, it would appear that DDT 
might hold some promise as a pupicide. 

Discussion 

It is the opinion of the author that chemical control 
of the immature stages of tabanids is not economically 
feasible with existing insecticides and methods of application* 
Also, there is such an overlapping of larval instars and pupae 
in the field that a chemical which was only effective against 
a particular stage would fail entirely. Even if a suitable 
insecticide were found, the problem would still be far from 
solution. 

Whilst no actual experiments against adults were 
carried out, the observer was able to watch the knock-down 
of females of H. affinis and H. septentrionalis within 5 minutes 
of coming in contact with a window sprayed with a 5 percent 
DDT-pyrethrin proprietary spray.

DISCUSSION 

The females of H. affinis , metabola, zonalis and 

C. furcata were not reared in the insectary despite the fact 

that their combined numbers exceed the combined numbers of 

of 

the remaining tabanid species. No explanation to this 
anomaly is apparent, but the following possibilities are 
suggested: 

(1) The larvae of these species were not found. 

However one feels justified in discarding this since, on a basis 
of mathematical chance, a few of the 80 emergences would be 
expected to be of the U species. Also 1 male of H. affinis and 
1 of C* furcatus were reared which would indicate that searching 
was conducted in an area where these immature stages did occur, 
although perhaps in sparse numbers. 

(2) Selective mortality of the U species in the 
insectary (See Chapter IV). 

(3) Only early instars of these species were found. 

This would of course suggest that the late instars occupy a very 
restricted habitat which was missed in our searching. If the 
emergences in 1951 from the overwintering larvae are predominantly 
these species, this explanation will be the most satisfactory 

and will suggest a search for late instars in situations hitherto 


deemed unsuitable,

The problem of controlling tabanids in treeless terrain 
is non-existent, for these pests are always found associated 
with woodland. However, the northland south of the tree line 
offers vast ideal breeding areas, for the entire countryside is 
dotted with small lakes and pools, the margins of which, in 
particular, abound in immature stages (See pp^9,Ul)* In this 
connection it should be possible, from aerial photographs, to 
make a reasonable forecast as to the nuisance to be expected 
from tabanids in any particular area. For a given proportion 
of water to land, the total length of shore line per unit area, 
and consequently the potential tabanid breeding area, is 
inversely proportional to the area mean diameter of the pools* 
Gerry ( 36 ) has reported the control of adults of 
Tabanus nigrovittatus throughout the season over a 15-mile 
section of shoreline by 2 applications of DDT-oil spray, 
containing 1 percent by weight of aluminum stearate, at 1 pound 
of DDT per acre. The problem here was simplified in that all 
stages were concentrated along a single shoreline and 
consequently the spraying required only two swaths from an 
aircraft to give effective coverage. To control tabanid adults 
in the north, aerial spraying would have to cover many square miles 
on account of rapid infiltration, and at the dosage which Gerry 
found necessary, this would be quite uneconomic. Furthermore, 
such an application should immediately precede emergence of the

important biting species# The spread of these emergences 
however is so great, namely from the first week in July to the 
first week in August, that even if application were possible, 
an effective deposit would not persist for this period* Data 
on control of adults could well be obtained as a secondary 
result from large scale aerial spraying against forest insects 
if such spraying was coincidental with peak adult population. 

The evidence available (Table 10) suggests that the pupal 
stage is the most susceptible to DDT# Furthermore, at this 
stage they are either at the ground surface or slightly below, 
and have a far greater chance of coming in contact with the 
insecticide, than do the subterranean larvae. However, until 
a material is found that is more specific and cheaper than 
present day insecticides, the chemical control of tabanids from 
large scale spraying is extremely unlikely to prove economic* 

.Although chemical control by aerial application is not 
practical, two other methods of using chemicals warrant 
consideration# 

(1) Enclosures could be built in various adult habitats 
at small cost from any waste material and the Inside sprayed with 
a DDT-pyrethrin formulation. Such an enclosure would be partially 
open at one end and contain at least one light-admitting opening 
around which the flies would congregate (37) • 


(2) Large frames covered with tar-paper and spread

with a non-drying adhesive should also prove effective® 

Insect populations have been studied by Brues (35) using 
this adhesive method. It is believed that these 2 methods 
would prove effective in affording a measure of relief in 
localized areas while at the same time, they could provide 
extremely valuable data on relative abundance, succession of 
species, adult populations and habits. 

Were it not for the presence of the very abundant 
predatory tipulid larva, P. dimidiata, the biting fly picture 
in the north might well be one in which the deerfly problem 
would be of primary importance. These larvae devour untold 
numbers of Chrysops larvae. Similarly, the small chalcid, 

D. occidentalis , perhaps plays an important part in keeping 
species of both important genera in check. These parasites, 
judging from the numbers which can emerge from one pupa, must 
be present in tremendous numbers, although they are seldom 
seen. The eggs of the Tabanidae when found, will probably 
have their complement of parasites. That the tabanid problem 
is not as serious as one might envisage is largely due to these 
two biological factors. 

Suggestions for Further Investigations 
1. An intensive rearing program with the emphasis placed on the 
species not obtained during 19U9* This would include finding

and rearing the larvae of H. raetabola, H. zonalis, 

, C. mitis and C. carbon aria . No females and only 1 male 
of H. affinis , 1 of C. furcata were reared. 

2. Cage field collections should be continued using larger 
cages constructed of more durable material (See p. 89 )• 

3* Weather conditions were very adverse during the period of 
observation. Further investigations should be carried out 
correlating adult activity with weather conditions. 

U# Further efforts to locate eggs In the field will have to be 
made. When these are found, more definite information can 
be obtained on the species by rearing adults. If successful, 
ovicidal investigations could be carried out. Also attempts 
should be made to 1 induce* oviposition in captivity and it 
may also be possible to rear larvae from dissected eggs. 

5. Further tests of insecticides against the immature stages 
and adults are required. 

6 . If possible, aerial photographs should be studied prior to any 
season*s investigations in a new area to ascertain the 
feasibility of establishing population estimates by this method.
