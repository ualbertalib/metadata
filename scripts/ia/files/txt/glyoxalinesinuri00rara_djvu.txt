GLYOXALINES IN URIUE 


I Introduction and Scope 


Ever since it was found that nearly all urines 
gave an orange or red color in an alkaline solution of 
diazotized sulphanilic acid, there have been periodic 
attempts to isolate the substance or substances respon¬ 
sible for the reaction. Ehrlich^ 1 ) who first used the 
test, was interested in an intense color given by the 
urine of typhoid patients, but this substance has not 
yet been isolated. Several color-giving substances, 
however, have been isolated from urine and definitely 
identified. The first was urocanic acid, isolated 
from dog T s urine and identified, first by Jaffe( 2 ) in 
1874, and later by Siegfried^ 3 ) (1898).

The second diazo chromogen to be isolated and 
identified was Histidine, obtained in small amount from 
large volumes of human urine by Engeland in 1908 
Hunter, in 1922( 3 ), was also able to isolate 0.1 gram 
of histidine monohydrochloride from a litre of measles

urine in which, it was estimated 0,31 gram of the 
material were present. Armstrong and Walkerwere 
also able to isolate a small amount of Histidine from 
10 litres of pregnancy urine. Ackermann and Fuchs^ 7 ^ 
in 1939, obtained from 10 litres of mixed urine, 4.6 
grams of Histidine dipicrolonate and 11.7 mgm. 

Histamine . 

The above are the iminazole whose presence in 
urine has been definitely established and it is signi¬ 
ficant to note that in the majority of the cases the 
urines from which the glyoxalines were isolated were 
of a pathological nature. 

There have been, further, several suggestions 
as to the presence of other as yet unidentified 
iminazoles in urines. Ftfrth and Majer^ 8 ^ mention that 
Autseher isolated from human urine iminazole acetic 
acid. Engeland, in his noteworthy paper of 1908, 
stated that he isolated small amounts of crystalline 
diazo-chromogens, which, on the basis of a partial 
analysis, he believed to be the higher and the lower 
homologues of Histidine, respectively. He further 
isolated a substance as the gold salt (OigH^NgO^* 

HC1. AuOlgi which gave a strong positive diazo reaction. 
Hunter^, in his work on Garnosin in cat muscle and 
iminazole excretion in urine, has remarked on the 
presence, in a purified fraction of cat’s urine, of a 
diazo-chromogen in some respects similar to urocanic 
acid but whose nature is as yet unknown.

From the foregoing discussion it can be seen 
that there is a variety of iminazoles that may be 
present in both normal and pathological urines* 

Paralleling the interest in the isolation of 
glyoxaline compounds, there have been numerous studies 
on methods of estimation of those compounds in urine* 
Diazo-benzene-p-sulphonic acid dissolved in sodium 
carbonate, as recommended by Pauly (1904)has 
been the most widely used reagent in biochemical work 
for the detection of iminazoles* 

In 1914, Weiss and Ssobolew^-^ published a 
method for the estimation of Histidine which was based 
upon the well-known reaction of Pauly. This method 
was subsequently applied by Masslow^ 2 ) in a series of 
metabolism experiments on dogs and by Fttrth^to a some¬ 
what similar series in man. These were possibly the 
earliest attempts to estimate iminazole compounds in 
urines* 

Koessler and Hanke in 1919^ 14: ^, by the use of 
their modification of the diazo reagent, devised a 
method which they showed to be accurate for the 
estimation of histidine, histamine and other iminazoles* 
In a later paper( 1924) they applied this method 
to the colorimetric determination of iminazole compounds 
in urine. The urine to be examined was first treated 
by the lead fractionation technique of Weiss and the 
diazo test was applied to the 3rd or iminazole fraction 
of urine. Subsequently, this method was applied, in

whole or in slightly modified form, by several authors# 

Hunter^ 9 )observed that the above method was 
suitable for the routine estimation of iminazoles in 
urine and commented on the indispensability of the 
preliminary fractionation of the urine and the subsequent 
evaporation of the filtrate in obtaining maximal color 
development in the diazo colorimetry. Lelu (1936) ^^ 
applied the Koessler-Hanke method in her study on metabo¬ 
lism of iminazoles. In a critical analysis of the Koessler- 
Hanke method, Lelu came to the conclusion that the method 
was not an absolute measure of the iminazole content but 
merely a good approximation. Other authors, of whom a 
good bibliography is given by Tschopp and Tschopp( 18 ) 
have used the Koessler-Hanke method either in its 
original form or after slight modification. 

Scope of the Work 

The present study has resolved itself into two 
main topics: firstly, the development of a satisfactory 
method for the estimation of urinary iminazole, and 
secondly, the study of the nature of the iminazoles 
present in human urine. With these we shall now proceed 
to deal. 

II The Estimation of Urinary Iminazole 

Preliminary Fractionation of the IJrine 

The prime consideration was to develop a simple, 
rapid procedure that could be readily applied to the 
routine analysis of urine for clinical laboratory purposes.

Secondly, we attempted to standardize the method of 
fractionation so that it might be applicable to all cases 
without the necessity for determining for each individual 
urine the optimal quantities of reagents to be used* 

It has been pointed out by several authors (Weiss, 
Hunter, Koessler and Hanke, etc*) that, in order to 
estimate the urinary iminazole with any degree of accuracy 
the diazo test must be applied to a suitably purified 
fraction of urine. The urine must be treated to remove, 
as completely as possible, not only those substances 
whose presence has an inhibitory effect on color 
development, but also those substances, other than 
iminazoles, that give a positive reaction with the 
diazo reagent. Such a fraction, suitable for the 
application of the diazo reagents may be prepared from 
urine by the lead fractionation technique first developed 
by Weissand later used by Koessler and Hanke( 15 ) 
in their study of urinary iminazoles. The method used 
by these latter authors forms the basis of our own 
technique which is outlined below. 

Experimental 

(a) Collection of the Urine - The urine samples 
were collected in 24-hour volumes, the results there 
being expressed in mgm. iminazole excreted in 24 hours. 
Where such procedure was possible the 24 hour-sample 
was preferably collected in 2-12-hour portions: a day 
portion (8 a.m. - 8 p.m.), and a night portion (8 p.m. -

8 a.m.). Determinations were carried out on both 
portions, the results on these 12-hour portions giving 
us some insight into the nature of the metabolism and 
excretion of the iminazole compounds. 

The urines, so collected, were placed in well 
stoppered bottles, covered with a layer of toluene 
and placed in the refrigerator. By such means of 
preservation, it was found that the urinary iminazole 
content remained unchanged for long periods of time. 

Reagents used - The reagents and the method 
used were essentially similar to those employed by 
Koessler and Hanke (1924) but certain modifications 
have been made to make this method more applicable as 
a standard procedure. Instead of using a saturated 
solution of normal lead acetate, we used a 40% 
solution since the saturated solution is of necessity 
a variable concentration and hence unsuited to a 
standard procedure of the type under consideration. 

The NaOH used was a 2.0 N. solution, the normality 
being accurate to the first decimal place. 

It might be mentioned at this point that we 
attempted the use of Goulard’s extract (U.S.P.)^ 20 ^ 
in the fractionation procedure. This was later 
abandoned when it was found, on experiment, that the 
results were not as good as those obtainable by the 
use of normal lead acetate and sodium hydroxide. It 
was observed that the iminazole fractions remained

(7 


somewhat colored despite the use of relatively large 
amounts of the extract. Also in the subsequent diazo¬ 
colorimetry the colors obtained were yellower and of 
weaker intensity than in the case of iminazole fractions 
prepared by the use of normal lead acetate and NaOH. 

We therefore strayed with the latter procedure. 

Method Employed - From the IS- or 24-hour 
specimen of urine, exactly 5 c.c. were pipetted into 
a tapered 15 ml. centrifuge tube. To this was added 
4.0 ml. 40% normal lead acetate solution and the 
contents well mixed. We then added 4.0 ml. 2 N. 

NaOH solution and the contents again thoroughly mixed. 
The tube was then placed in the centrifuge for 2-5 
minutes to bring about clear separation. The volumin¬ 
ous lead precipitate carried down with it urine pigments, 
organic and inorganic acids, purines, other urinary 
chromogens and certain substances that inhibit coupling 
with the diazo reagents,but it removed none of the 
glyoxalines (Koessler and Hanket^), Lelu^ 7 )). 

The supernatant solution was decanted off into 
a larger centrifuge tube (50 ml.) and the lead precipi¬ 
tate was washed twice, using each time 2-3 c.c. of 
distilled water. The washings were added to the 
filtrate. To this latter was added sufficient disodium 
hydrogen phosphate solution to completely remove all 
excess lead. It was found that an excess of NagHPO^. 
may be added, the salt not interfering with the diazo 
test, while it is imperative to remove all traces of

lead, its presence in solution causes clouding with 
Na 2 C0 3 subsequently used in the colorimetry. The 
resultant lead phosphate precipitate was centrifuged 
off, the filtrate decanted into a small erlenmeyer 
flask (125 ml.) and the precipitate was washed with 
distilled water to which a few drops of NagHPC^ 
solution were added. By this procedure, lead fractions 
were obtained that were in almost every case quite 
clear and colorless. These latter were the criteria 
of successful fractionation. 

The filtrate and washings were now evaporated 
nearly to dryness, made up to 10 ml. and aliquot 
portions of this solution were used for the estimation 
of iminazole. The mode of evaporation was found to 
have a marked influence over both the intensity and 
the quality of the color produced. In all, 4 methods 
of heat treatment were investigated: 

(1) Evaporation at reduced pressure (Temperature 40°C.) 

(2) Evaporation on a boiling water bath (Temperature 92°d) 

(3) Boiling the filtrate to near-dryness on the hot 
plate (Temperature approximately 110°C.) 

(4) Refluxing the filtrate for various periods of time 
(-J--2 hours) and subsequently evaporation to low 
volume on the hot plate. 

It was found that the samples treated by the first 
two methods yielded definitely poorer results than 
those treated by the latter two methods. The method

(9 


finally adapted consisted in boiling the lead filtrate 
to near-dryness on the hot plate (till crystals began 
to appear in the boiling solution). The flask was then 
removed from the plate, about 10 c.c. distilled water 
added and this solution once more evaporated as before 
to near-dryness* The residue was transferred to a 10 
c.c. volumetric flask and made up to the mark with 
careful washings of the erlenmeyer flask* This result¬ 
ant solution was then subjected to diazo colorimetry for 
the estimation of iminazoles. 

In the present method, three conditions were 
taken as criteria of the efficiency of fractionation of 
the urine, quality of color development, intensity of 
color developed and proportionality of the color readings. 
The latter seemed to be of the greatest value in assess¬ 
ing the fractionation method. Two factors were found to 
influence these criteria. 

The first factor was the amount of lead acetate 
used in the fractionation. In a sample of normal urine 
increasing amounts of lead acetate were used. The results 
are given below (5 ml. samples of normal urine were used 
in each case):

It can be seen that there was an increase in

the quality of the color obtained and the proportionality 
of the readings. With the use of larger amounts of lead 
acetate, the colors obtained in the subsequent diazo test 
tended to be less yellow and more pink. 

The second factor affecting these criteria was 
the degree of heat applied in the evaporation of the crude 
filtrate. Higher degrees of heat and concentration were 
found to bring about the more complete removal of the 
volatile constituents of the urine. Histidine in presence 
of ammonia and in contact with the diazo reagent will 
give a yellow color. Phenol, Indol, Scotol and other 
related volatile phenolic substances that can by their 
presence alter the quality or inhibit color development 
were more or less completely removed by the heat treatment. 
The degree of success was guaged by the results obtained, 
i.e. in regard to the criteria mentioned.

Intensity of color, quality of color and proportion¬ 
ality of readings are adversely affected by the presence 
of inhibition substances in the lead fraction. The greater 
amount of lead acetate used acts to cause more complete 
precipitation of these substances. The greater degree 
of heat similarly removes the volatile inhibiting 
substances. The increase, to optimal values, of our 
three criteria indicated most satisfactory lead fraction¬ 
ation treatment. 

(b) Diazo Colorimetry - Aliquot portions of the 
lead filtrate were subjected to the Diazo test. The 
Koessler-Hanke Diazo reagent was used and the procedure 
carried out in essentially the same manner as described 
by these authors. The colors developed were measured 
against an artificial color standard whose preparation 
has been previously described by HunterThe color 
standard was first standardized or calibrated against 
a solution of pure Histidine monohydrochloride of known 
strength. The colors developed from the iminazole in 
the lead filtrates matched very closely the color of the 
standard solution. 

Procedure - The standard solution was placed in 
the right-hand cup of the colorimeter. Into the left- 
hand cup were placed:- 

(0.5-x) c.c. of pure distilled water, 

2.5 c.c. of a freshly prepared 1.1% sol. of NagCC^ 
1.0 c.c. of fresh diazo reagent.

Using the plunger of the colorimeter as a 
mixing rod, the contents of the cup were thoroughly 
mixed. Exactly 1 minute after the addition of the 
diazo reagent, x ml. (0.05-0.5 ml.) of the lead filtrate 
was added. The contents were again mixed in the same 
manner, the cup inserted in position and set at a depth 
of 10 mm. 

Color development in the left hand cup proceeded 
rapidly, the stages of development being identical with 
those of Histidine in similar strength of solution. 

There was first a greenish coloration grading through 
to yellow, orange, red-orange and finally a clear pink# 
It was found that maximal color development occurred 
3.5-4 minutes after the addition of the test solution. 
Fading of the color began after a variable interval, 
depending both on the intensity of the color developed 
and on the amount of the test solution added. The 
significant point is that readings are not reliable if 
taken at intervals other than those specified. 

Calculation Results - The urinary glyoxaline 
was found to resemble very closely, in both properties 
and behavior, the characteristics of Histidine. Thus 
it was decided to express urinary glyoxalin in terms 
of Histidine rather than in terms of a vague iminazole 
complex as suggested by Koessler and Hanke. 

The color standard used was standardized against 
a known solution of histidine momohydrochloride. It 
was found that 1 mm. depth read in the colorimeter was

particular urine. 


The volume of the urine being known, the calcula¬ 
tion of the total excretion for the 12 or 24 hour period 
was a simple matter. 

Knoop Tests of Lead Filtrates - Kapeller-Adler 
has reported the details and modifications of a method 
for the estimation of Histidine in urine. The test is 
a modification of the Knoop reaction and its specificity 
for histidine has been adequately demonstrated. The 
sensitivity of the reaction has been claimed by the 
author to be as high as 1:50,000 in pure solution and 
about 1:10,000 in urine. 

The method was applied by us, both to lead 
filtrates and to pure solutions of histidine monohydro¬ 
chloride. With solution of pure histidine, it was 
found that we were unable to duplicate the findings 
of Kapeller-Adler with respect to the sensitivity of 
the test. We found the test to be much less sensitive 
than claimed. The method was also applied to lead 
filtrates of urines. In all cases, even with urines 










(14 


with high iminazole content, the Kapeller-Adler test 
was negative. On the assumption that all or a great 
part of the glyoxalin contained was histidine, we would 
have expected positive reactions in all cases as the 
amounts of lead filtrates added were such as to he 
within the limits of sensitivity of the test. 

The consistency of the negative results indicated 
several possibilities - that the Kapeller-Adler test 
is not applicable to lead filtrates. That in the latter 
some interfering substance or substances are present 
that prevent the occurrence of the reaction and the 
appearance of the characteristic color - that the main 
glyoxalin present in the urines is not histidine but 
some closely related glyoxaline. Since, subsequently, 
rather large amounts of histidine were isolated from 
these same urines tested, it may be conceivable that 
in the native urine the original glyoxalin is not 
histidine but some labile glyoxalin readily converted 
to histidine in the course of the isolation procedure. 

Studies on Urines - A great deal of time was 
spent in this research in the routine application of 
the new method to the estimation of glyoxalins in 
human urines. An attempt was made to determine or 
approximate, if possible, the normal range of iminazole 
excretion in the normal male adult. In all cases, 
except in the class studies, the determinations were 
carried out on 2 12-hour samples (day and night samples 
respectively) collected as described previously, In

(15 


this manner, it was thought that some light might he 
shed on the metabolism of iminazoles. 

Three series of studies were carried out: - 

(1) Normal male subjects - unrestricted diet. 

(2) Class studies (Medical studerjts) 

a. Urines collected for Mosenthal Kidney function 
test. Diet more or less restricted. 

b. Urines collected from the same individuals 
on an unrestricted diet (for Vitamin C 
determinations). 

(3) A number of pathological urines. Majority of 
these suffering from some genital dysfunction. 

(1) In the normal male urines studied, the 
results of which are tabulated below, it was found that 
there existed in the individual case a relatively wide 
day-to-day variation in the iminazole excretion. There 
appeared, however, to be a tendency for the 24-hour 
excretion to remain at a certain level or within a 
certain range. It was thus possible to speak of high, 
medium or low iminazole-excreters and to foretell with 
some degree of accuracy the amount of glyoxalin that 
could be found in the urine of any one individual for 
the 24-hcur period. The degree of iminazoluria seemed 
to be a characteristic inherent in the individual, dependent 
perhaps on some variation in amino-acid metabolism, the 
nature of which is at the present time unexplained.

In one subject, in whom 17 24-hour samples were 
studied there was found to be a range of iminazole 
excretion from 240-458 milligrams (calculated as Histidine), 
in the 24-hour period. There were occassional high and 
low values but the great majority were closely clustered 
about the average value - 300 milligrams/24 hours. In 
another case only 3 24-hour samples were studied. All 
showed a high degree of iminazoluria, the values being 
656, 670 and 816 mg./24 hours, respectively. 

Below are tabulated the results obtained in individ¬ 
uals in whom more than one sample was studied.

In 

the above 

cases the diet 

was normal 

and 


unrestricted so that the values may be said to represent 
the normal iminazole excretion of that particular 
individual. 

On comparing the values for the "day" and the 
"night" samples, it was seen that though there was no 
wide difference, yet there was in every case a larger 
iminazole excretion in the day specimen than in the 
night specimen - in some cases the difference being 
more marked than in others. This fact indicates that 












(17 


iminazole excretion is influenced by degree of bodily 
activity and therefore is not entirely endogenous in 
nature* The influence of diet in the above individuals 
was not investigated* 

(2) Medical Class Studies 
Three series of determinations of urinary 
iminazole were carried out on two classes of Medical 
students. In one class, two sets of urines were 
collected and studied, one set collected for the 
purposes of the Mosenthal Kidney function test and 
hence under certain dietary restrictions, and the 
second set collected under no specific dietary restriction 
(customary diet of the individual). This latter set 
of urines was preserved with HC1 and H 3 PO 4 since they 
had been collected principally for the estimation of 
the Vitamin C. Previous to the application of the 
fractionation procedure, these acids were neutralized 
with 2 N* NaOH. Results obtained were quite satis¬ 
factory. In the second class of students, only one 
set of urines was collected and studied. These also 
were collected under the dietary restrictions as de¬ 
manded by the Mosenthal test. Acknowledgement is 
here made to Mr. A. Nelson who carried out the investi¬ 
gation on this latter set of urines. 

The results of these class studies are tabulated 
in Table I. Since the first two sets of determinations 
had been carried out on the same individuals, it was 
thus possible to compare the results and to appreciate 











(18 


the influence of restricted and unrestricted diet on 
the excretion of iminazoles. 

Class I - (a) 42 urines collected for Mosenthal test. 

The glyoxaline contents of the urines collected 
varied from 80.0-340 mg./ 24 hours. The average 
value was 181 mg./24 hours. Expressed as milli¬ 
grams per 100 ml., the glyoxalin content varied 
from 4.7-26.3 mg.%, the average being 12.8 mg.%. 

(b) 46 urines collected under unrestricted 
diet. The glyoxalin contents of these urines 
varied from 113-426 mg./24 hours, the average 
being 227.3 mg./24 hours. Expressed in milli¬ 
grams per 100 ml., the content varied from 7.1- 
53.3 mg.%, the average being 21.8 mg.%.

Comparison of these two sets of results showed 
that in the great majority of instances there was a 
marked increase in the glyoxalin excretion when the 
diet was unrestricted. It was possible that many 
factors could operate to this effect but the most 
logical conclusion seemed that the dietary change was 
the main factor responsible for the heightened 
iminazole excretion. 


































(21 


Comparison of individual cases also showed 
the tendency, referred to above, of the iminazole 
excretion of the individual to be at a certain level, 
be it high or low. In most cases this is fairly well 
illustrated* 

Class II - 35 urines collected for Mosenthal Test. 

Results in this third series were essentially 
similar to the corresponding set in the first 
class. Variation in iminazole excretion was 
found to be from 78-447 mg. in the 24-hour 
volume. The average excretion was 226 mg./24 
hours. Expressed as milligrams per 100 ml. 
the excretion varied from 4.8-31.9 mg.%, the 
average value being 16.3 mg.%.

In the course of the Mosenthal test, the urines 
were tested for the usual clinically significant 
constituents. These figures are all on hand so that 


















(23 


drawing up of correlations between urinary iminazole 
and any of the urinary constituents may be attempted 
though this had not been done to date. From the 
results shown in a recent paper by Langley( 23 ) such a 
correlation between iminazole and creatinine contents 
may be a worthwhile undertaking. 

Sex difference - There was observed in the limited 
number of cases available an appreciable difference in 
the rates of excretion of iminazole in male and female 
subjects. Under restricted diet the female subjects 
excreted an average of 106.7 mg. iminazole in 24 hours 
as compared to 185 mg./24 hours for the males. Under 
unrestricted diet female subjects excreted an average 
of 162.2 mg./24 hours as compared to an average of 230 
mg./24 hours in the male subjects. The reason for this 
sex difference is not known, but the explanation 
probably lies in the greater bodily activity of men as 
compared to women and to a large extent also in the 
differences in body mass. This has not yet been fully 
studied. 

(3) Pathological Urines 

In the course of the research several pathological 
urines were examined incidentally rather than as an 
organized study of such urines. In several instances 
the results obtained were interesting from a clinical 
standpoint. Below are outlined some of the cases that 
were studied and the findings observed. 

Miss B. - Complaint - Metrorrhagia and thyroid 







(24 


hypofunction. The urinary iminazole before treatment 
(21/2/40) was 78.3 mg./24 hours (10.6 mg. %). After 
several days’ treatment with thyroid extract, the 
urinary iminazole rose to 381.9 mg./24 hours (65.3 mg. %). 
The findings in this case tended to show that the Basal 
metabolic rate is closely associated with the iminazole 
excretion. However, since this was an isolate^ case, 
no reliable conclusions could be drawn though a clue is 
given for further study. 

Mrs. F. R. - Pregnant - 5 months. Threatened 
abortion was being treated with Leutocylin injections 
(Progesterone). In all, 14 samples of urine were analysed 
for iminazole content. The results of these analyses 
together with notes on the treatment and the progress of 
the symptoms are tabulated in Table II. 

From the observations made it seemed permissible 
to draw certain conclusions. With threatened abortion, 
the iminazole excretion, high in normal pregnancy, dropped 
markedly and approached the normal female level. On 
treatment with Leutocylin that tended to stabilize the 
pregnancy, the iminazole excretion rose again to high 
levels. Withdrawal of Leutocylin caused a fall in the 
rate of excretions of iminazole. The findings in this 
case were in accord with the findings of other authors 
who have investigated histidinuria in pregnancy. 
{Kapeller-Adler, Tschopp and Tschopp, Armstrong,and 
Walker, Fttrth and Majer). They have reported that there 
exists in pregnancy a marked Histidinuria.

Several other urines of a pathological nature

these cases than merely the clinical diagnosis, so that

Clinical Significance of Iminazoluria 
As can be seen from the above, the extent of the 
work done on the clinical significance of the test has 
been very limited. Various authors have reported at 
length on this aspect of the subject. For a good review 
of the recent work done on this aspect of the problem, 
one is referred to the papers by Tschopp and Tschopp( 18 ) 
or Fttrth and Ma j er( 8 ) ♦ 

III Isolation of the Urinary Iminazole 

After the development of a satisfactory method of 
estimation of the iminazoles in urine, we undertook to 
study the nature of these substances. The assumption 
that the iminazole was wholly or at least in part, 
histidine, served as a guide in the isolation procedure.

(27 


The process was designed as if the total glyoxalin 
content were histidine since earlier observation 
tended to support such a conclusion. The procedure 
is described below, one of the several isolations 
done serving as an example. 

The urine used was Sample G.A.L. - volume a 
3250 ml. By the method of estimation, the glyoxalin 
content was found to be 1386 mg. (expressed as Histidine 
base). This urine was placed in a 12 litre round- 
bottom pyrex flask and to it was added \ its volume 
(1625 ml.) of 40% Normal Lead Acetate solution and 
then an equal volume of 2 N. Sodium Hydroxide. Both 
these solutions were added slowly with constant stirring 
to insure thorough mixture of solutions and optimal 
precipitation. The flask was then stoppered lightly 
and placed in the refrigerator overnight to allow the 
precipitate to settle. 

In the morning the supernatant, a clear solution 
of a very faint yellow tinge was carefully siphoned 
off. The remainder of the mixture was centrifuged in 
large 250 ml. cups and the supernatant added to the 
filtrate. The flask was well washed with distilled 
water and these washings were in turn used to wash the 
precipitates in the cups. The washing was carried out 
by thoroughly dispersing the precipitate in the wash 
water. The mixture was then centrifuged and the super¬ 
natant added to the filtrate. Two such washings were 
done after which the precipitate was discarded. 











(28 


The combined filtrate and washings were now 
freed of excess lead ion by the addition of a solution 
of disodium hydrogen phosphate (5%) till precipitation 
of the lead was complete. In this instance 230 c.c. 
of the 5% solution were required to completely remove 
all lead. The lead phosphate precipitate settled out 
readily in 2 or 3 hours and then as in the previous 
precipitation, the separation was brought about by 
siphoning and centrifuging. The lead phosphate was 
washed with distilled water to which a small amount of 
UagHPO^ solution had been added. 

The filtrate and washings with a combined 
volume of about 6-7 litres, was evaporated to a low 
volume in a large vacuum-distillation apparatus. 
Periodically the distillation was interrupted and the 
distillate drained off and tested for ammonia by the 
use of the Nessler reagent. In the early part of the 
distillation a strongly positive reaction was obtained 
but became progressively weaker and then negative. 

The distillation was then discontinued. The volume 
now was 2000 ml. 

An aliquot portion was taken, suitably diluted 
and the glyoxalin content was determined by the diazo 
colorimetric method. The glyoxalin content was found 
to be 1066 mg. 

Mercury Fractionation - Several 5 ml. aliquot 
portions of the lead filtrate were taken and put through 
mercury fractionation. Varying amounts of Mercuric 







(29 


Acetate (25%) were added to each of the 5 ml. aliquot 
portions. The solution was now made just alkaline to 
litmus with Na^CO^ ( 10 %), and the tubes were centrifuged. 
The filtrates were discarded. The precipitates in the 
tubes were washed with distilled water and a drop of 
10% NagC0 3 . The tubes were once more centrifuged and 
the filtrates discarded. The precipitates were then 
suspended in distilled water, made acid by addition of 
H 2 SO 4 and then Hydrogen Sulphide was bubbled through 
to "free” the precipitated glyoxalin of the mercury. 

The Mercuric Sulphide was centrifuged off, washed and 
discarded, while the filtrate and washings were evaporated 
in vacuo (to remove HgS) to a volume of about 1 ml. 

When HgS was completely removed this concentrated solution 
was made up to 10 ml. and the glyoxalin content was 
determined. The fraction was also tested for urea and 
creatinine. All of the aliquot portions were treated 
in precisely the same manner. The volume of Mercuric 
Acetate that had brought about the most favorable 
fractionation of the 5 ml. aliquot, that is, optimal 
recovery of the glyoxalin and most complete exclusion 
of urea and creatinine, was added in proportional amount 
to the main volume of the evaporated lead filtrate. 

This solution was treated in precisely the same manner 
as the 5 ml. aliquot. 

In this urine, it was found that 240 ml. 25% 
Mercuric Acetate was the amount required for optimal 
fractionation of the glyoxaline from the urea and 










(30 


creatinine. The HgOAc was added and then the solution 
made just alkaline to litmus with Na^CO^. The precipitate 
was centrifuged off, washed, suspended in water, acidified 
and freed with HgS. The mercuric sulphide was centrifuged 
off, washed and the combined filtrate and washings 
evaporated in vacuo to a volume of 130 ml. An aliquot 
portion was removed, diluted and the glyoxalin content 
estimated by the diazo method. The content was found to 
be 630 mg. Thus we had sustained a loss of over 400 
milligrams of glyoxalin in the mercury fractionation. 

(This happened only in this specific instance, in the 
other isolations very slight loss occurred in the 
mercury step.) 

By the use of the mercury fractionation, all of the 
glyoxalin can be precipitated and yet leave the great 
bulk of the urea and creatinine in the filtrate. This 
is its main value. 

Silver Fractionation - For further purification, 
the glyoxalin solution was passed through a silver 
fractionation. 10% Silver Nitrate was added to the 
filtrate resulting from the mercury fractionation. An 
immediate brownish precipitate of Ag-purines was formed. 
The silver nitrate was added to the solution till an 
excess was present as demonstrable by the development 
of an immediate brown spot-test with Barium hydroxide 
solution. The purine precipitate was not filtered off 
at this stage but left in the solution.

From a burette was added saturated Ba(0H) 2 
solution till the solution had reached a pH of 5*0* 

The solution was now centrifuged and the precipitate 
discarded. At a pH of 5.0 almost none of the glyoxalin 
was in the precipitate yet the great part of the 
purines were precipitated. To the filtrate, saturated 
Ba(0H)g was added to a pH of 8.0. The mixture was 
centrifuged and the filtrate discarded. In the 
precipitate was present the bulk of the glyoxalin. 

The glyoxalin contents of the three fractions were 
found to be: 

1. pH 1 - 5.0 s 37.4 mg. 

2. pH 5.0 - 8.0 = 645.4 " 

3. pH 8.0 -10.0 = 2.2 ” 

From the results it appeared that the glyoxalin 
recovered exceeded the amount originally present. This 
was explained as the effect of the removal of interfer¬ 
ing substances and a fuller development of color with 
the diazo reagent. 

Fractions 1 and 3 were discarded. Fraction 2 
was suspended in distilled water and HgS passed in to 
free the glyoxalin. The AggS precipitate was centrifuged 
off, washed 2 times with its own volume of distilled 
water, saturated with HgS, and discarded. The resultant 
filtrate and washings were evaporated in vacuo, to a 
volume of about 150 ml. to remove the HgS and excess 
water. An aliquot portion was suitably diluted and 
the glyoxalin content estimated by diazo-cclorimetry. 






(32 


In this instance the content was 645 mg. 

Phosphotungstic Acid Precipitation - The method 
of Hunter and iSagles( was followed . The solution 
was made 0.5 Normal with respect to sulphuric acid 
by the addition of the requisite amount of 10 Normal 
acid. Then, to the solution, was added a 20% solution 
of Phosphotungstic Acid (in 0.5 N* HgS0 4 ). The reagent 
was added, with thorough mixing, to the point where 
further addition caused no precipitation in a test 
portion of the supernatant. The flask was then lightly 
stoppered and allowed to stand overnight in the 
refrigerator for complete precipitation of the glyoxalin 
to take place. The glyoxalin phosphotungstic precipate 
was centrifuged off in the morning,care being taken to 
keep the temperature of the solution as low as possible 
throughout the entire procedure. To this end the 
centrifuge bottles and cups were kept either in the 
refrigerator or in ice-water until required. The 
precipitate was washed two times with its own volume 
of ice-cold 0.5 N. HgSO^ to which had been added some 
of the phosphotungstic acid solution (5 ml./lOO ml. of 
0.5 N. H 2 S0 4 ). 

The precipitate of glyoxalin phosphotungstate 
was transferred to a glass mortar and there thoroughly 
mixed with solid Barium hydroxide, the latter being 
added till the supernatant solution tested definitely 
alkaline to litmus. This mixture was then centrifuged 
and the filtrates decanted through a filter. Thorough

washing of the precipitate was carried out three times, 
the precipitate being thoroughly shaken up and dispersed 
in 0.1 N. Ba(0H^ solution. The washings were treated 
in the same manner as the original filtrate - centrifuged 
and decanted through filter. 

The strongly alkaline filtrate and washings were 
transferred to an erlenmeyer flask and heated to near 
boiling. 5 N. HgSO^ was added till no further precipitation 
occurred. This Barium sulphate precipitate was likewise 
centrifuged off, washed two times with hot distilled water 
and discarded. 

The filtrate and washings were evaporated in 
vacuo to a volume of about 100 ml. Quantitative 
removal of both Ba ++ and SO* ions was effected by the 
addition of the required volumes of 0.1 N. solution of 
Ba(0H)g and H 2 SO 4 . This was merely a refinement of the 
rather crude removal of the ions in the previous step. 

The resultant solution, free of these ions, was found 
in every case (in every isolation procedure) to be of 
a definitely alkaline reaction when tested with litmus. 

This indicated that the glyoxalin or glyoxalines present 
were predominantly of a basic character, resembling, in 
this respect, Histidine. Estimation of the glyoxalin 
content gave a result of 408 mg. The loss in the 
phosphotungstate precipitation was therefore quite 
large - 237 mg. 

The solution was now evaporated in vacuo to a 
small volume. When a volume of about 1 ml. had been 






(34 


reached, a mass of crystals appeared in the tube. 

These were crystals of the glyoxalin as the free base. 

For the sake of greater purity of the final product, it 
was decided to isolate the material as a mono-hydroohloride 
salt. Thus, on the assumption that the material was 
histidine, the requisite amount of 1.0 N. HC1 was added 
to the aqueous solution. Actually the amount of HOI used 
was slightly in excess of the theoretical value. 

Decolorization - Since the solution contained some 
color (a light brown), it was decided to decolorize it 
by the use of Animal Charcoal. We were aware, at the 
time, of the work done by Niendorff^^ and the claim 
made, that histidine was completely removed from solution 
by shaking with Blood Charcoal. However, with the 
technique used, we found that very little adsorption 
of the glyoxalin occurred with the use of the activated 
blood charcoal. Repeated decolorization of a final 
concentrated solution of the glyoxalin (immediately 
prior to final isolation) involving the use of 1.5-2.5 
grams of activated blood charcoal caused losses in the 
order of 2 or 3 milligrams out of a total of 400 or 500 
milligrams. Therefore, losses due to decolorization of 
the final concentrated solution of glyoxalin with blood 
charcoal were quite negligible. 

The procedure used in decolorizing the concentrated 
glyoxalin solution was as follows: The solution, in a 
test-tube, was brought to boiling and then about 0.5 gm. 
of blood charcoal was added. This mixture was boiled for 
a few seconds and then filtered through a small gravity 







(35 


filter funnel. The greater part of the charcoal was 
retained in the tube for better washing. 2 or 3 c.c. 
of distilled water were added to the charcoal in the 
tube and the mixture boiled briskly for a few seconds 
and then decanted through the filter. The charcoal 
was washed 2 or 3 times in this manner. The resultant 
filtrate was quite clear and almost perfectly colorless. 

Final Isolation - The decolorized solution was 
evaporated in vacuo to a small volume (about 1.5 ml.). 
Absolute Ethyl alcohol was added in small quantities 
with shaking till marked crystallization occurred. In 
some cases warming the solution to near-boiling, before 
addition of the ethanol, was found to facilitate 
crystallization. On the appearance of crystals the tube 
was stoppered and placed in the refrigerator for the 
completion of crystallization. After standing in the 
refrigerator for 1 or 2 days, the crystals were filtered 
off by suction through a small, sintered-glass funnel, 
washed first with 2-3 c.c. of 95% Ethanol and finally 
with 3-4 c.c. of absolute ethanol. The crystals were 
allowed to suck dry on the pump, then placed in the oven 
at 110°C. for i-1 hour for completion of drying. The 
contents of the funnel were then transferred to a tared 
watch glass and weighed. 

In this particular case, crystallization was very 
satisfactory, much more so than in many of the other 
isolations that were carried out. The yield of the 
monohydrochloride salt of the glyoxalin in the first 






(36 


"crop" was 502.7 mg. out of a calculated possible yield 
of 552 mg. A Knoop test on this crude product gave 
a strong positive reaction. The melting point was 
248-249°C. and the molecular color value was found to 
be 109.4 million mm. Therefore this material was, from 
all indications, relatively pure histidine. 

Second and third "crops” were similarly obtained 
from the filtrate from the first "crop". The yields 
of these, in this case, were 22 and 36 milligrams 
respectively. They were, however, found to be quite 
impure and highly contaminated with creatinine. Diazo 
tests on these latter crops gave yellow colors of a 
weak intensity indicating low iminazole content. As 
a consequence they were discarded. 


The above was the general procedure employed 
for the isolation of glyoxalin compounds from urine. 

The products obtained were crude and impure and for 
final identification further purification was necessary. 
As each "crop" was obtained several tests were carried 
out on it to determine both its nature and the degree 
of purity of the product. The tests used were: 

(a) The diazo test - A diazo reagent was made up and 
into it was dropped a crystal or two of the 
material obtained. The development of red color 
indicated relatively pure glyoxalin, whereas a 
yellow color indicated a high degree of contamina¬ 
tion in which case the crop was usually discarded.

(b) The Knoop test - This test was used to test for 
histidine. The Kapeller-Adler modification was 
used with but one exception - instead of removal 
of the excess bromine by Arsenious Acid, the 
Chloroform method of Hunter( 26 ) was found 
preferable. 

(c) Melting point - The melting point of each crop 
was taken and compared to that of Histidine 
monohydrochloride (255-256°C.). 

(d) Molecular color value estimation - 5 mg. of each 
of the crops in question and of pure Histidine 
monohydrochloride were weighed out, dissolved and 
made up to 50 ml. and the molecular color value 
determined as outlined by Hunter^ 21 ). The molecular 
color value of Histidine monohydrochloride is 
113.1 million mm. 

The latter two tests, (c) and (d), served as 
our criteria of purity of the product and on the basis 
of the results of these tests the decision was made 
whether or not to further purify the material. It was 
found necessary to recrystallize each crop at least once. 
This was carried out in the usual manner. The crop was 
dissolved in a minimal volume of distilled water, heated 
to boiling, decolorized with charcoal and filtered. 

The solution was evaporated, in vacuo, to a low volume 
and one or two drops of 1.0 N. HC1 added. It was then

(38 


heated to near-boiling and then Absolute Ethanol was 
added till crystallization occurred. Subsequent steps 
were then the same as used for the isolation of a 
first crop. Recovery in the recrystallization was, as 
a rule, very satisfactory. In the example cited above, 
the first crop of 502 milligrams was recrystallized 
from water. The yield was 460 milligrams of a very 
pure product whose melting point was 255-256°0., the 
molecular color value was 109.4 million mm. and the 
Knoop test was strongly positive. 


Further Notes on Procedure 

It may at this point be advisable to discuss 
in greater detail some of the stages of the isolation 
procedure, especially in regard to some of the difficulties 
encountered. 

The Silver fractionation procedure used was 
essentially the same as that described by Vickery and 
Leavenworth^ 27 ) except in the matter of a few obvious 
details. The authors employed Silver Oxide and 
Sulphuric Acid instead of Silver Nitrate, and they 
removed their ’Histidine fraction’ within a pH range of 
5.0-7.0. This range was later extended by the authors 
to pH 5.0-7.4. The results of these authors, with 
respect to the Silver fractionation curve of Histidine, 
were confirmed in the present study. 








(39 


The Silver fractionation was applied to test 
portions of pure histidine solution and to a mercury 
fraction (T.M.R. (2) )• Both solutions were made up 
to contain 1.5 mg. glyoxalin per ml. 7-5 ml. portions 
of each solution were taken and excess Silver Nitrate 
added in each case. The tubes were acidified by addition 
of two drops 5N Nitric Acid to each, and then Sodium 
Hydroxide (0.5 N.) was added to bring the contents of 
the tube to pH values of 5.0, 5.5, 6.0, 6.5, 7.0, 7.5 
and 8.0, respectively. The precipitates formed were 
removed, freed with hydrogen sulphide, the filtrates 
from the Silver Sulphide brought to definite volume 
and the glyoxalin content measured in each. The results 
for Histidine are shown in the table below:

compared with the results of (a) and (b), the values 
of the latter being doubled in this case, to allow for 
easier comparison. 

Study of the (c) Curve brought some interesting 
observations. The curve lies between that of (a) and 
that of (b). It ascends steeply to a pH value of 6.5, 
indicating that the bulk of precipitation occurred 
between pH values of 5.0-6.5. This point coincides 
with the point of maximal precipitation of Histidine, 
this fact suggests that the glyoxalin being precipitated 
up to this point is histidine. The curve there dips

(41 


rather markedly and finally ascends more steeply and 
reaches its maximal level. This dip and the succeeding 
rise are strongly suggestive of the presence of a 
second glyoxalin, one whose precipitation by the Silver 
fractionation method appears to start at a pH of 6,5 
and proceed to a maximal precipitation of a pH of 8.0, 

In some instances, difficulty was encountered 
in bringing about crystallization of the glyoxalin 
from the final concentrated solution. In one case 
the glyoxalin was removed as the free base. This was 
not found to be advantageous since the base was subject 
to much greater contamination than the hydrochloride 
salt. In one instance an attempt was made to isolate 
the glyoxalin as the dihydrochloride by the method 
described by Gilson^ 28 ). The procedure is rather more 
involved than the subsequent results obtained warranted. 
Aside from this one attempt, the method was not used. 

Another source of great annoyance was the carry¬ 
ing through to the final glyoxalin concentrate of large 
amounts of Creatinine and in some cases Creatine. 

When this was the case it was found,firstly that 
crystallization from the concentrate was inhibited and 
secondly, if crystallization did occur, the crops 
invariably contained large amounts of the impurities. 

In one case a first crop obtained was found to consist 
purely of Creatine.

It was found to be advisable to remove these 
impurities before the isolation of the glyoxalin was 
attempted* Creatine was not dealt with specifically 
since Creatine is not precipitated by Phosphotungstic 
Acid* Creatinine, however, is precipitated by this 
reagent and so we expected it to be present in the 
final glyoxalin concentrate. Due, however, to the 
convertilibity of Creatinine to Creatine or vice versa, 
a small amount of the latter could be expected to be 
present. 

Creatinine was removed from the concentrate 
by precipitation as the monopicrate. The creatinine 
content of the concentrate was first colorimetrically 
determined by the method used for the estimation of 
that substance in blood. The requisite amount plus 
a 10 % excess of purified picric acid was weighed out, 
dissolved in a small volume (1-2 c.c.) of water and 
added to the glyoxalin solution. The mixture was 
evaporated in vacuo to volume of 5-10 ml. and allowed 
to stand in the refrigerator overnight. The creatinine 
monopicrate was filtered off by suction, washed with 
a total of about 5 ml. of ice-cold distilled water and 
discarded. This creatinine monopicrate precipitate, 
on investigation, was found to contain insignificant 
amounts of glyoxalin, so that the danger of precipitation 
of the glyoxalin by the picric acid was not a factor.

(43 


The filtrate from the Creatinine picrate was freed of 
excess picric acid by addition of hydrochloric acid and 
extraction of the picric acid from the solution by 
Benzene. The amount of hydrochloric acid added varied 
somewhat - from 2 to 5 times the calculated amount 
necessary to convert the glyoxalin to the monohydro¬ 
chloride. This was done in order to expedite the 
extraction of the picric acid by Benzene. 

By the above method 92-95% of the Creatinine in 
the glyoxalin solution was safely removed, the loss of 
glyoxalin throughout the procedure amounting to approxi¬ 
mately 5%. The success of the method depended upon 
maintenance of a low volume and maintenance of low 
temperature to limit the solubility of Creatinine mono- 
picrate. 

In one case, after the removal of Creatinine, 
the glyoxalin was precipitated as the flavianate, was 
dissolved in hot water, Barium hydroxide added and the 
Barium flavionate filtered off. Sulphuric acid was added 
to the filtrate to completely remove Barium. The solution 
after filtration was then made acid with Hydrochloric 
acid and the remainder of the flavianic acid removed by 
extraction with Butyl alcohol. The glyoxalin was then 
isolated in the usual manner, as the monohydrochloride. 

The product was found to be quite pure. The melting 
point was 254-255°C. A mixture of this substance and of 
pure histidine monohydrochloride melted at 256°C. The 
molecular color value was found to be 114 million mm.

Therefore, though the flavienic precipitation 
is involved, it is a useful procedure in purification 
of the glyoxalin. 

Results of Isolation procedures 

In all, five urine samples were put through the 
procedure for the isolation of glyoxalines. The 
crystalline products when first obtained were in a 
variable state of purity, the degree being estimated 
by the performance of several tests in which the results 
constituted our criteria of purity. These tests have 
been mentioned previously (page 36). Those of immediate 
interest were (a) Melting points - both on the material 
alone and then on mixture with pure Histidine monohydro¬ 
chloride, (b) Molecular color value and (c) the Knoop 
test. 

The results of the various isolation performed 
are tabulated below under the heading of the sample of

The occurrence of these two instances of negative 
Knoop tests in products whose other properties so closely 
resembled Histidine was, to us, highly significant and was 
considered worthy of special attention. The further study 
of these Knoop-negative glyoxalin samples is discussed 
later under the heading of New Glyoxalin. 

Identification of the Crystalline Products 

Several tests were applied and several criteria 
satisfied before the substances isolated were identified. 
These tests, their application and significance may 
now be discussed in a more expanded form. 
















(a) Diazo Test - A strong positive diazo reaction 


was the first requisite. If the test, on application 
was negative, the material was discarded. The degree, 
character of development and quality of the final color 
were identical with the results obtained with Histidine. 

(b) Molecular Color Value - This is a direct out-

The degree of color development is a characteristic 
of the individual glyoxalin and is, therefore, useful in 
estimation of the purity of the glyoxalin and as an aid 
in identification of the product. 

(c) Melting Points - Reported melting points of 

histidine and of some of its salts are listed below: 

d-Histidine - 287-288° C. (33) 

1-Histidine - 265° C. (33) 

dl-Histidine - 285-286° C. (33) 

1-Histidine Monohydrochloride - 255-256° G. (30)

The melting points of the products of the isolation 
procedures compared very favorably with the reported 
melting of Histidine Monohydrochloride and with the melt¬ 
ing point of a known sample of the pure salt. 

(d) Knoop Test - This has been previously explained 
and its specificity for Histidine in either the 1- or 

d- form has been noted. 

(e) Specific Rotation Studies - As a final check, 
to determine whether the histidine being excreted was 

of the d- or 1- variety, specific rotation determinations 
were done. The procedure used was that described by 
Lutz and Jirgensons^. 

1-Histidine has a specific rotation of -39.3° 
whereas 1-Histidine monohydrochloride in an aqueous 
Solution of equal concentration (M/20) has a specific 
rotation of 4-2.3°. The low reading that would be 
obtained on the polarimeter with the material isolated 
led us to prepare the free base. 

The free base was prepared as described by 
Abderhalden and Weil( 32 ). The histidine (or glyoxalin) 
hydrochloride was dissolved in a small volume of 
distilled water and to it was added the calculated 
amount of Normal Lithium hydroxide solution. This 
mixture was evaporated to dryness in the vacuum 
dessicator and finally heated in the electric oven 
(110°G. for i-1 hour). The Lithium chloride (and the 










(50 


slight excess of Lithium hydroxide) was extracted with 
absolute ethyl alcohol. The residue, free of chlorides, 
was recrystallized from a water-alcohol mixture as used 
in the crystallization of the monohydrochloride. Care 
was taken to ronove all chloride completely, by a 
second recrystallization if necessary, since the 
presence of small amounts of chloride could cause 
rather large error in the specific rotation figure. 

M/20 solutions of the free base were used in 
each case. The polarimeter tube used was 1 decimeter 
in length. Readings were taken at room temperature 
(25°C.) and the source of light was the Sodium Vapor 
Lamp. 

The procedure was carried out on three samples: 

(1) Histidine Monohydrochloride (pure salt - known) 

(2) Glyoxalin Hydrochloride (G. A. L.) 

(3) Glyoxalin Hydrochloride (F. R.) - Crop I, Part (1). 

(1) Histidine Monohydrochloride - The pure 
base was prepared as described above. Melting point 
(uncorrected) = 276 C. Readings taken of an aqueous 
M/20 solution of the free base gave these results: 


ck = -0.28° 



-0.28° x 100 

0.77649 x 1

(2) Glyoxalin Hydrochloride (G. A. L.) - 
Precisely the same procedure followed. Melting point 
of free base - 277-278°C. 

- 0.309° 

= - 0*309° x 100 - -39.85°

0.77560 x 1 

The above results proved to our satisfaction 
that the substances that had been isolated, were 
beyond a doubt pure 1-histidine. 

"New" Glyoxalin 

The specific rotation of the two samples that 
had given a negative xoioop test were also determined. 
Both these samples were from the same urine (F. R.). 
These were, respectively, the second portion of the 
recrystallization product of the original first crop, 
henceforth referred to as A, and the recrystallized 
product of the combined second and third crops, referred 
to as B. 

Lithium hydroxide (IN.) was added to aqueous 
solution of both A and B, as in previous cases, for 
the removal of Chlorides. It was found, however, that 
on attempting to bring the solution to dryness,

crystallization did not occur but, in each case, a 
very viscous material resulted, comparable to a very 
thick syrup. This syrup was found to be completely 
soluble on addition of absolute ethyl alcohol so that 
obviously the extraction of the Lithium chloride could 
not be carried out in the usual manner* 

To obviate this difficulty, it was finally 
decided to carry out, on each sample, a phosphotungstic 
acid precipitation to separate the glyoxalin from the 
added Lithium. The free base was then recovered from 
the phosphotungstate precipitate in the usual manner. 
Considerable difficulty was encountered in bringing 
about crystallization of the glyoxalin (as the free 
base) and it was finally found necessary to evaporate 
the glyoxalin solution to dryness and heat to constant 
weight (at 110°C.) in weighed tubes. The yield of pure 
glyoxalin base after this procedure was: 

A s 118.6 mg. 

B s 141.4 mg. 

Each was dissolved in boiled, distilled water 
and made up to 10 ml. These solutions were then used 
for the polarimeter. The results of the specific 
rotation readings taken of these two samples are given 
below: 

A - That part of the first crop which on recrystallization 

passed on to the filtrate and was recovered as a 

second crop.

These results might have been explained by the 
possible presence of a considerable admixture of 
d-histidine with the normal 1-histidine. However, 
the Knoop test was negative and since both d- and 1- 
histidine give a positive Knoop test, this possibility 
was eliminated from consideration. The behavior of 
the substances during the Lithium hydroxide treatment 
was definitely atypical. Also, as stated above, the 
melting points of the hydrochloride salts were decidedly 
above the expected value. Further study of the material 
was fully indicated. 

These two crops were mixed, the calculated amount 
of 1 N. Hydrochloric acid added and the glyoxalin 
isolated as the monohydrochloride salt. After twice 
recrystallizing from water, the final yield was 150 mg. 
This purified product was found to give no trace of 
color with the Knoop test. The melting point was found 
to be 267°C. The substances began to brown at 220°G., 
became quite dark at 240°C. and contracted to a small 
black mass before melting when great expansion and 









( 54 . 


evolution of gas occurred. 

An elementary analysis of this substance was done 
by Dr. Stanley Cook of Ayerst, McKenna and Harrison 
(Montreal). The following results were found: 


Carbon 

35.53% 

Hydrogen - 

4.50% 

Oxygen 

22.72% 

Nitrogen - 

20.46% 

Chloride - 

16.79% 


A fusion test with Sodium metal proved the absence of 
Sulphur and rhosphorus. 

From the above results a tentative formula 
(CgH^g Qr gj0 3 N 3 *HC1) was drawn up for the monohydro¬ 
chloride salt of the glyoxalin. It appeared that this 
might be a hydroxy derivative of Histidine, examination 
proved that the substance contained no free Amino-N, 
nor did it respond to the Ninhydrin test. Thus, definitely, 
the substance was not an amino-acid. 

This substance, which has not yet been identified 
and has probably not been previously described, appears 
to be a large constituent of the glyoxalin content of 
normal human urine. The presence of this new substance 
in urine accounts for a number of discrepancies in the 
literature between the diazo and Knoop tests in urine, 
for while this substance gives a strong diazo reaction, 
the Kjnoop reaction is quite negative*

IV Conclusions and Summary 

1. A new method has been described for the quantitative 
estimation of iminazoles in human urine. 

2. The nature of these iminazoles has been studied. 
1-Histidine has been isolated from several normal 
male urines and from one pregnancy urine. 

3. A new glyoxaline is described whose properties 
are very similar to those of Histidine except that 
it gives a negative iCnoop test. Its presence in 
urine probably explains much of the disagreement 
between various authors with respect to the diazo 
and linoop tests in their application to urine.
