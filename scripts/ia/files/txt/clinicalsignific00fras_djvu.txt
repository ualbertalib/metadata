INTRODUCTION 

Since the establishment of the formula for ergo- 
thioneine, and the identification of it as an erythror 
cyte constituent (12, 20, 4, 13, 5, 6, 7) little work 
has been reported on values in normal and abnormal human 
blood. Interest was renewed with the reports of Lawson 
and Rimington (24, 25) in 1947 which attributed an anti¬ 
thyroid property to ergothioneine. Stanley and Astwood 
(28) and Wilson and McG-inty (31) made attempts to con¬ 
firm the antithyroid effect, both groups using radio¬ 
active iodine techniques, but they were unable to con¬ 
firm the earlier reports of the London workers. 

There then appeared to be good reason to invest¬ 
igate blood ergothioneine content in various disease 
states, and following the development by Hunter of a 
modification of his earlier diazo test (19, 21) this 
project was begun. 

Salt (27) in 1931, using a modified uric acid 
method of estimation, reported slightly elevated blood 
ergothioneine levels in 17 cases of diabetes mellitus, 
and single cases of rheumatism, pulmonary tuberculosis, 
and hemiplegia. He found no variation of ergothioneine 
level with age or sex, and no correlation of the ergo¬ 
thioneine value in diabetes with the blood sugar levels, 
state of disease, or type of treatment. There was no 
relationship of ergothioneine level to blood uric acid

values, nor to the degree of urea retention. Benedict, 
Newton and Behre (4) had previously reported higher 
than normal levels in diabetes, but had given no values. 

Latner and Mowbray (22), who used a colorimetric 
method developed by the former, (23) reported lower 
than normal blood ergothioneine levels in 4 cases of 
thyrotoxicosis, and low normal values in two others. 

They made the observation that ergothioneine, on add¬ 
ition to blood, was not combined with the blood plasma 
proteins, and could be easily and rapidly excreted by 
the kidneys. This they felt, might explain the failure 
of injected ergothioneine to act as an antithyroid 
substance. 

Only two reports on the pharmacology of ergothioneine 
have been found. Tainter (29) in 1927, demonstrated no 
change in blood glucose levels or other signs of pharm¬ 
acological activity ih cats following the subcutaneous 
injection of ergothioneine. Trabucchi (30) an Italian 
worker, also considered ergothioneine inactive, but 
thought that it exhibited a mild anti beriberi action. 


METHODS AND MATERIALS 

Blood for estimation in diabetes was obtained from 
patients admitted to the Royal Alexandra and University 
Hospitals, either for periodic checks or because of a

diabetic complication. The samples were portions of 
oxalated blood taken by the hospital laboratory staff 
for blood glucose estimations. 

Blood for estimation in tuberculosis was obtained 
from the Charles Camsell Hospital, in which case it 
came from either Indian or Eskimo patients, and from 
the Royal Alexandra Hospital, where all blood was 
taken from white patients. 

Other diseases were investigated in a chance 
manner. The laboratory at the Royal Alexandra Hospital 
supplied us with blood remaining after requested tests 
had been performed. 

Blood from normal persons was obtained from the 
University student population and from donors at the 
Red Cross Blood Donor Clinic, blood from the latter be¬ 
ing taken at the conclusion of the donation. 

The method for estimation was that described by 
Hunter (21) in 1949, with one modification. It was 
found that the plasma, which Hunter stated gave a 
yellow colour with the diazo test, contributed to the 
colorimetric value measured as ergothioneine in whole 
blood. The plasma value was independent of the amount 
of ergothioneine present and proportional to the 
haematocrit reading for the plasma in any specimen. It 
was found that the colour developed by pure plasma 
gave an "ergothioneine-equivalent” value of 1.0 mg.%

+ 0,2. A fraction of an average value of 1,0 mg.$, 
proportional to the percentage of plasma found in each 
specimen, was subtracted from the ergothioneine value 
obtained for the whole blood in the same specimen. This 
then gave the true ergothioneine reading. 

Different dilutions of cells with plasma were made 
from one blood, and the above method of calculation for 
true ergothioneine content was found to be valid for all 
haematocrit values encountered. (Table I). This plasma 
correction is especially significant when the haemato- 
crit is low, since the difference is increased to a 
greater extent on conversion of the ergothioneine read¬ 
ing from whole blood to per cent corpuscles. No ergo¬ 
thioneine was found in plasma, and the "ergothioneine- 
equivalent" readings in plasma remained constant in 
bloods which gave ergothioneine values ranging from 4 
to 60 m g.% corpuscles. To confirm the belief that all 
the ergothioneine measured by this method was con¬ 
tained in the corpuscles, estimations were made on 
whole blood and the values converted by haematocrit to 
per cent corpuscles; estimations were then made on the 
corpuscles alone from the same sample. Two examples 
of this calculation are given in Table 2 in which it 
can be seen that the calculated value of ergothioneine 
per cent corpuscles using whole blood agrees with the 
value found on using corpuscles alone?

If the plasma effect was not taken into consider¬ 
ation, the respective values per cent corpuscles would 
he 7.8 mg.#, and 4.8 mg.#, readings 1.4 mg.# and 1.1 
mg.# higher than the actual value for corpuscles of 
6.4 mg.# and 3.7 mg.#. 


*To minimize the difficulty experienced in obtaining 
the corpuscles free from plasma dilution, the sample 
was first centrifuged at 3000 r.p.m. and then frozen. 
The erythrocyte layer was then cut from the frozen 
core, melted, and carried through the test. Freezing 
did not affect the test.

PROBLEMS CONNECTED WITH THE DIAZO TEST 


To better explain the steps referred to in the 

following section a brief summary of the procedure of 

the diazo test is now given (21). 

1. 0.5 ml. whole blood +4.5 ml. of 0.0045 N acetic 

acid 

2. Heat in a slowly boiling water-bath for 3-4 min. 

3. Centrifuge and decant the supernatant liquid. 

4. Supernatant + 1 drop of G-oulard’s solution (lead 

monoxide and lead acetate) 

5. Centrifuge and decant the supernatant. 

6. Supernatant + 1 drop of NaH g P0 4 .H 2 0. 

7. Centrifuge and decant the supernatant. 

8. Add 2 ml. of buffer (sodium carbonate and sodium 
acetate) to 1 ml. of diazo (Koessler and Hanke) 
reagent in each of two colorimeter tubes. 

9. To No.8 in 15 seconds add, in one colorimeter tube, 
1 ml. of No.7 + 1 ml. of water, and in the second 
colorimeter tube 2 ml. of No.7. 

10. To the coupled compound from No.9 in each color¬ 
imeter tube, add, in 45 seconds 5 ml. of 10 N NaOH. 

This then gives the final violet-pink colour 

typical of ergothioneine. 


a. Interference - definition and description . 

In the estimation of blood ergothioneine a bronze 
and less commonly and orange-pink colour appears upon the 
addition of 10 N NaOH to the coupled compound, instead 
of the expected violet-pink colour. This interferes with 
the estimation of ergothioneine. Throughout this clinical 
investigation this problem has been particularly trouble¬ 
some. Investigation into the mechanism of its production

has been sporadic both because of the limiting amount 
of blood which remains after the initial estimation, 
and because of our desire to accumulate sufficient 
data from disease cases for a statistical analysis, 
rather than any wish to examine the test itself. 

In the routine of the test 1 and 2 ml. aliquots 
from the final protein-free filtrate (stage 7) are 
added to the diazo solution. In cases in which inter¬ 
ference develops we have noticed nothing unusual in the 
colour of the coupled compound. However, upon addition 
of the 10 N NaOH which normally produces a violet-pink 
colour, the specimens with interference have developed 
one of two colours, an orange-pink or bronze. These 
foreign colours have inevitably been more marked in the 
2 ml. aliquot; and in fact the 1 ml. sample has fre¬ 
quently given a good "ergothioneine" colour with pro¬ 
portionality between it and the 0.5 ml. aliquot in 
spite of an interfering colour in the 2 ml. aliquot. 

This freedom from interference in the smaller aliquots 
has been more common when the interference has been of 
the "orange" variety. 

As the time of storage is increased the interfer¬ 
ing colour which develops changes from orange to bronze; 
this latter colour appears to be the end point of the 
change. When such a colour is produced on testing each 
of the three aliquots (0.5, 1 and 2 ml.) it is impossible 
to make any estimation of the ergothioneine content.

In general, the "orange" interference has been 
found to give an apparent increase in the value read as 
ergothioneine and the bronze to produce a reduction in 
the true value. A blood specimen which has once devel¬ 
oped an interfering colour consistently does so in that 
particular specimen. 

b. Factors in the Production of Interference . 

Several factors have been found to influence the 
development of interference. 

1. Hemolysis 

The appearance of interference is much more frequent 
in hemolysed specimens, and often develops in specimens 
stored at room temperature which initially gave good 
tests but which have become hemolysed. 

2. Temperature 

Duplicate quantities from the same specimen have 
been refrigerated and stored at room temperature. Those 
at room temperature developed interference in 0-2 days, 
whereas those which were refrigerated could frequently 
be kept for as long as 10 days. 

3. Time 

It has been found that the less the time that 
elapses from venepuncture to test, the less the incidence 
of interference. 

4. Disease

elop interference, but we have observed a high incidence 
of it in our series in blood from patients who were 
suffering from two disease states - kidney failure 
(nephritis) and leukemia (but not two cases of aleukemic 
leukemia)• 

o. Mechanism of Interference . 

Much of the investigation into the development of 
interference has produced equivocal results, but various 
possibilities which have been examined are presented here 
to illustrate the state of the problem to date. 

(i) pH of the Blood 

Readings of the Beckman pH meter gave a mean reading 
of 6.88 for 3 blood specimens which had given good 
ergothioneine colours and an identical mean of 6.88 for 
four which had shown interference. 

(ii) Coagulation Heating Time 

By varying the time that the blood-acetic acid 
solution was in the water-bath from 1 to 15 min., we 
attempted to assess the effect on the production of 
interference. In one specimen interference was present 
in the filtrate from the portion heated 8 min., but not in 
that heated Z min. This isolated finding has not been 
repeated. 

(iii) Source and Mode of Production of Interference 
In an attempt to determine whether the inter¬ 
fering substance was present in a) the plasma, or b) the 
erythrocytes, or c) was dependent upon some interaction

between these two phases, the following experiment was 
planned. 

i. To test plasma from cases showing interference . 
"Ergothioneine-equivalent"* values for these did not 
differ significantly from plasma values for specimens 
without interference. 

ii. To add plasma from a case showing interference to 

erythrocytes from blood showing no interference . The 

< 

value for a 50% mixture of plasma,from a specimen show¬ 
ing interference,and cells,from blood developing a normal 
ergothioneine colour, when corrected to mg.% corpuscles, 
was equal to the original value for the cells used. This 
was repeated on two more different plasma-cell mixtures 
with the same results. In contrast to these results, in 
another specimen,washed cells** from a case of inter¬ 
ference gave a good ergothioneine colour but upon re- 
addition of the original plasma, interference again ap¬ 
peared, although to a lesser degree than in the whole 
blood. 

To see if a higher concentration of plasma would 
produce different results,a 75% - 25% mixture of plasma 
from a specimen with interference and cells from blood 
giving a good ergothioneine colour was made. A typical 
interference developed in the 2 ml. aliquot, but the 
0.5 and 1 ml. aliquots gave readings close to the orig¬ 
inal value for the cells used. This would indicate that 
by decreasing the concentration of the cells the effect

of the interfering substance is increased, and that the 
interfering material is present in the plasma. 

Cells from another sample showing interference 
were separated and washed four times in ifo saline. These 
then gave a good ergothioneine colour with no sign of 
interference. In order to see if the production of the 
interfering material took place during the hemolysis and 
heating (step 2) - that is, through some plasma-erythro¬ 
cyte reaction - the separate filtrates from the plasma 
and the washed cell fractions of the same sample were 
carried through to stage 7, then mixed, in equal quanti¬ 
ties. The test on this filtrate mixture showed the pre¬ 
vious interference colour found in the whole blood of 
the same specimen. 

The following conclusions could then be drawn: 

1. The interfering substance or an essential constituent 
of it is contained in the plasma. 

2. The formation of it does not depend on any reaction 
of a plasma factor with the red cell fraction during 
hemolysis and heating (stage 2). 

In an effort to identify the substance a paper chrom¬ 
atogram was very kindly done for us by Mr. K.A. Siluch of 
this Department on the filtrate from a specimen which 

*The value read in mgm.,% ergothioneine, but not due to 
the colour found normally with ergothioneine.

showed typical bronze interference. He reported the 
presence of ergothioneine (not detected by colorimetry 
because of the interference), and a large stationary 
area which he suggested might have been due to the 
interfering material, but which he was unable to ident¬ 
ify. 

d. Possible Causes of Interference , 

i. Contaminants . 

Because interference has been shown to develop in 
all blood samples if allowed to stand long enough, 
contaminants are unlikely causes of interference. Some 
of these were investigated. 

"Hemosol" 

This is a solvent of unknown composition, used, in 
both hospitals from which the blood was obtained, for 
cleaning test tubes (R.A.H. and U.H.). When added to 
4 samples it caused no interference. 

Acid-chromate Cleaning Solution . 

This was used in cleaining our own equipment. Small 
amounts were added to the diazo reagent and gave rise 
to a greenishvyellow colour. However, when added to 
blood which was then carried through the test it pro¬ 
duced no interfering colour. 

ii. Physiological Substances . 

Phenols . 

Because of the high frequency of interference in

cases of uraemia it occurred to us that the phenols and 
phenol-like materials, the blood levels of which are 
said to parallel the uraemic manifestations (8), might 
be a cause. Within the limitations of the test with 
Millon's reagent (14) we were unable to demonstrate the 
presence of any phenols in the specimens showing inter¬ 
ference. 

Andrewes, as quoted by Gantarow and Trumper (16), 
found that on performing the indirect van den Bergh 
test on serum from patients with nephritis an orange- 
buff colour developed, which changed to cherry-red on 
addition of strong sodium hydroxide. Again because of 
the frequency of interference in cases of renal failure, 
we felt that it was possible that a similar substance 
might be responsible for the interference in the diazo 
test for ergothioneine. We would then have to assume 
the appearance of this same substance in the non-uraeraic 
blood on storage. To try this possibility we applied 
the Andrewes test as modified by Hewitt (16), to the 
serum of blood samples showing interference. We were un¬ 
able to demonstrate any positive tests except in blood 
from cases of uraemia. 

Lactic Acid . 

In many cases the time taken for the development of 
interference coincided with the time necessary for the 
completion of glycolysis and the exhaustion of the 
supply of co-enzyme 1 and diphosphopyridine nucleotide

(11). For this reason the effect of lactic acid, which 
accumulates with the cessation of glycolysis (11), was 
investigated. Lactic acid added to the diazo reagent 
gave no colour.

to draw any conclusions from these findings. 

Enzymes 

Interference, in most specimens, is not initially 
present, hut appears as the age of the blood increases. 
This fact suggested to us the possibility of being able 
to inhibit some enzymatic process and so prevent the 
development of a hypothetical product of an enzyme re¬ 
action, which could conceivably be the cause of inter¬ 
ference. 

Two enzyme inhibitors were used: heat and sodium 
fluoride. Five aliquots of blood were taken, from each 
of two specimens. One aliquot of each was kept re¬ 
frigerated and one was kept at 37°0; the third and fourth 
were first heated at 100°C. for 0.5 mins, and 2 mins, 
respectively then kept at 37°C.; 1% sodium fluoride was 
added to the fifth which was then also kept at 37°C. 
(Table 5) 

In both A and B samples refrigeration apparently 
delayed the appearance of interference. In neither sample 
did fluoride prevent the development of interference by 
the seventh day. Heating prior to incubation had no de¬ 
laying effect in B blood; in fact the samples heated for 
2 min. developed interference at an earlier date than 
the control. Heating both for 0.5 and 2 mins, was assoc¬ 
iated in sample A with a somewhat later development of 
interference than found in the control.

Because we have no idea what enzyme, if any, is 
involved,we have no way of choosing a suitable enzyme 
inhibitor, and it must be remembered that fluoride may 
have no effect on the system in question. Two further 
specimens were treated with fluoride and at the end 
of six days at 37°G. the fluoride treated samples showed 
the same amount of interference as the controls. 

In this type of experiment it might be argued that 
bacterial growth must be considered. Because there is 
no apparent difference in the interference which is seen 
early, as for example in most blood from cases of neph¬ 
ritis and leukemia, or at various later times in other 
blood from normal persons, we have made no attempt to 
consider this aspect. 

Because of the previously mentioned coincidence in 
the time it takes for failure of the glycolytic activity 
in stored blood and the lapse of time found in normal 
blood before the development of interference, we attempted 
to delay the termination of glycolysis. This activity 
can be prolonged by the addition of glucose to the 
specimen (11). This was done in tw T o samples, and the time 
taken for the development of interference compared to two 
controls. The control in both samples showed interference 
in two days* One test sample with 400 mg.% glucose added,

gave a reasonably good colour, though slightly orange, 
in that time. The second sample displayed a fairly good 
ergothioneine colour in the 1 ml. aliquot but interference 
in the 2 ml., in comparison with its control which showed 
complete interference. (1 ml. and 2 ml.). 

To see if the action of glucose in delaying inter¬ 
ference could be attributed to its effect on either the 
plasma or the corpuscles, corpuscles and plasma were 
first separated, and each fraction divided into three 
aliquots. Glucose was added (400 mg.%) to one aliquot of 
cells and to one aliquot of plasma. The separate aliquots, 
including one pair as a control, were then kept at 37°C. 
for two days, then reconstituted, giving the following 
mixtures: 

1. Corpuscles and plasma. 

2. Corpuscles and plasma with added glucose. 

3. Corpuscles with added glucose and plasma. 

All three showed an orange-yellow colour with the 
diazo test, but the colour was somewhat more intense in 
the third sample. Glucose in this concentration increased, 
rather than decreased, the intensity of interference in 
the third combination. This avenue of attack on the 
problem seemed to offer nothing. 

Amino Acids .

responsible for interference in the two diseases, neph-

ritis and leukemia, it was noted that in both conditions 
blood amino acids are said to be increased, (1). In 
leukemia the increase is said to parallel the increase 
in leukocytes, a fact which would explain the absence 
of interference in two cases of aleukemic leukemia. 

Histidine, histamine, tyrosine and a commercial 
preparation of amino acids ("Parenamine”, Winthrop Stearns) 
were all added to blood samples to assess their effect.

Tyrosine produced a pinkish colour, but not the violet- 
pink of ergothioneine. It also increased in proportion 
to concentration. 

Glutamic acid was also added at this time but 
appeared to have no effect on the development of the 
normal ergothioneine colour in blood. 

The task of adding individual amino acids appeared 
formidable, and the conditions obtained from introducing 
single amino acids were probably not comparable to those 
found when combinations of acids were present, as is 
the case in blood. For these reasons various amounts 
of a commercial amino acid preparation ("Parenamine", 
Winthrop-Btearns) were added in the belief that this 
might give a picture somewhat more like a physiological 
increase.

In blood sample F there was a slightly earlier 
appearance of an interfering colour in the test sample 
with the added amino acids. There appeared to be no 
significant decrease in the time needed for the dev¬ 
elopment of interference when amino acids were added 
to human blood.

tested as a possible cause of interference because of 
this reputed ability to destroy the thiolimidazole ring. 

Sufficient ferric chloride was added to a blood 
sample which gave a good ergothioneine test to give a 
resulting concentration of 52 mg.% ferric iron. The 
result was the production of a bronze colour. Amounts 
were then added as shown in the following table.

this work on the problem of interference. 

Ascorbic acid . 

In the search for a physiological component of 
blood, which might be responsible for interference, 
ascorbic acid was investigated because of its high value 
in leucocytes, which is approximately 40 times that of 
erythrocytes (18), and the coincident frequency of 
interference in leukemia. 

G-reenblatt (15) has shown that the imidazole ring 
of ergothioneine is split by ascorbic acid in vitro. 

He also showed that ascorbic acid given intravenously 
to guinea pigs, rabbits and human subjects, caused no 
change in blood ergothioneine levels. Barron and Kemperer 
(3) stated that the presence of red blood cells had no 
effect on the rate of oxidation of ascorbic acid in 
blood or in serum. They suggested that the main protection 
was provided by proteins, amino acids and glutathione. 
Contradictory results are presented by Heinemann (18) 
who showed that ascorbic acid oxidation proceeded more 
rapidly in serum than in blood, and more rapidly yet 
in a mixture of serum and leukocytes. The presence of 
intact red cells in any one of these mixtures markedly 
inhibited oxidation. Oxidation was dependent upon access 
to atmospheric oxygen and did not take place when any 
one of the solutions was placed in an atmosphere of

nitrogen. 

At the pH and temperature of tissues the dehydro- 
ascorbic acid formed on oxidation of ascorbic acid 
undergoes, in a few minutes, an irreversible change to 
another acid, ketogulonic, which has more reducing 
power than reduced ascorbic, and which then gives rise 
to undetermined products, perhaps oxalic and 1-threonic 
acids, (9, 26). 

Bed blood cells are virtually impermeable to 
ascorbic acid (18, 9). This suggested to us that some 
interaction might be postulated to occur between 
ascorbic acid and products formed during erythrocyte 
hemolysis, during the heating stage of the test. Such 
a reaction is unlikely since we later found that the 
reconstituted plasma and washed-erythrocyte filtrates 
from a sample of blood which previously showed inter¬ 
ference still produced a bronze colour. 

Ascorbic acid, both in the reduced and in the 
oxidized form, when added in aqueous solution to the 
diazo reagent, gave a very pale yellow-green colour. 
Oxidized and reduced ascorbic acid in amounts sufficient 
to give final concentrations of 5 and 25 mg.% in both 
cases, were added to aliquots of blood which gave a 
normal ergothioneine colour. Neither the oxidized nor 
the reduced form produced any change in the usual colour 
of ergothioneine. When added, however, to the filtrate

of any sample at either stage 3 or stage 7, both re¬ 
duced and oxidized ascorbic acid prevented the devel¬ 
opment of the ergothioneine colour and gave rise to a 
bronze,indistinguishable from the natural interference 
colour. 

Reduced and oxidized ascorbic acid were added to 
aqueous solutions of ergothioneine,and the resultant 
mixtures carried through the complete test. When 
either reduced or oxidized ascorbic acid was added to 
give a concentration of 5 mg.$,a normal ergothioneine 
colour developed. However in the test solution con¬ 
taining a concentration of 25 mg.$ reduced ascorbic 
acid,the colour developed was orange-pink, and in the 
solution containing 25 mg.fo oxidized ascorbic acid the 
colour was bronze. No reduced ascorbic acid was found 
in the final filtrates of any of these four tests. 

Both oxidized and reduced ascorbic acid were 
added at two other stages in the procedure; before the 
addition of Goulard’s solution (stage 3) and after the 
addition of sodium acid phosphate (stage 7). Both in 
concentrations of 5 and 25 mg.%, and when added at 
either stage 3 or stage 7, both of these substances 
interfered with the production of a normal ergothioneine 
colour. In every case the final colour was bronze.

test) in these cases of induced interference was normal. 
It therefore appeared likely that the ascorbic acid or 
its product did not affect the coupling of the ergo- 
thioneine with the diazo reagent, but rather modified 
the ergothioneine molecule. For this reason ascorbic 
acid was added, both in the reduced and oxidized state, 
to the reaction mixture during the 45 second interval 
between coupling and the addition of sodium hydroxide. 
This also produced the same bronze interference-like 
colour. 

Final filtrates of blood samples to which reduced 
ascorbic acid had been added were tested by the sodium 
2-6 dichlor-phenol-indo-phenol method and no reduced 
ascorbic acid was ever found. Similarly filtrates from 
specimens with both interference and normal colour 
gave no positive tests. The passage of reduced ascorbic 
acid through the heating stage had been shown, however 
to be unnecessary for the production of an ascorbic 
acid induced interference (cf. aqueous solution of ergo¬ 
thioneine with added reduced ascorbic acid, above). It 
is questionable whether either form of ascorbic acid 
reaches the final filtrate in the ordinary test pro¬ 
cedure because ascorbic acid is precipitated at pH 7.6 
by lead (16). This is somewhat more alkaline than the 
corresponding pH in the procedure, and we are unable

to say whether oxidized ascorbic acid reaches the final 
filtrate. The fact that the oxidized form of ascorbic 
acid causes interference when added to an aqueous sol¬ 
ution of ergothioneine prior to the heating stage yet 
neither the reduced nor the oxidized form causes inter- 
ference when added to normal blood,indicates that blood 
exerts some modifying influence on the ascorbic acid- 
ergothioneine relationship. 

Experiments were then designed to see if an ex¬ 
cess of ascorbic acid added to normal blood would 
hasten the appearance of interference at 37°C.

*Parenamine and ascorbic acid added to give final con¬

at 37°C. 

In Blood C (Table 11) interfering colour appeared 
one day earlier in the test aliquot. In Blood D an”early" 
interfering colour (orange-pink) appeared two days 
earlier than in the control, but never developed into 
the final bronze colour seen in the control on the third 
day. There does not seem to be any significant difference 
between these results and those found on addition of amino 
acids alone. 

It was now reasonably established that ascorbic 
acid could, in reduced or oxidized state, interfere with 
the ergothioneine diazo reaction; that it could probably 
do so through virtue of its ability to modify the ergo¬ 
thioneine imidazole ring rather than to interfere with

the coupling reaction; and that there is some property 
of whole blood which normally prevents ascorbic acid 
causing this interference, 

e. Methods of Preventing and Reversing Interference . 

Prevention . 

This may be accomplished by: 

i. Using the blood as soon as possible after 
venepuncture. 

ii. Refrigerating the blood. 

* iii. Avoiding hemolysis. 

iv. Not allowing the oxalate concentration to 
exceed 2 mg. per ml. blood. 

In taking duplicate specimens in test tubes used 
by the hospital laboratory staff and in our own, we 
found interference in two of the former, but in 
neither of the latter. Reduction of the oxalate content 
of the hospital tubes from 4 to 2 mg. per ml. resulted 
in a marked decrease in the number of samples showing 
interference. Specimens with the higher oxalate concen¬ 
tration also showed slight hemolysis, a factor already 
discussed in relation to interference. 

Blood was taken from two normal students, A and B, 
and oxalated with 2, 4 and 8 mg.% per ml. These samples 
were then incubated for a 5 day period.

TABLE 12 

The effect of different oxalate concentrations 
on the rate of development of interference 
in normal blood* 



It will be seen that with 8 mg. of oxalate per ml. 

t 

blood,interference appeared in both A and B blood on 
the second day. The puzzling finding was the lack of 
interference in B when repeated on the third day. The 
fact remains that much better results have been ob¬ 
tained since the reduction of oxalate content. 

Reversal of Interference . 

In this section we will also mention for the sake 
of record, the following method which was used unsuc¬ 
cessfully in an attempt to get rid of the interfering 
colour. 

Uricase . 

Hunter (21) suggested that combined uric acid 
might be the cause of interference in ox blood, and 
possibly human blood. An isolated sample of ox blood

gave an ergothioneine colour following incubation with 
the enzyme uricase (21). This suggested to us the 
possibility of treating our human blood showing inter¬ 
ference in the same manner. In two samples this treat¬ 
ment had no apparent effect on the bronze colour. 

1. Freezing . 

This was the first method by which we were able 
to obtain a good colour on a specimen which otherwise 
showed interference. It appears to work only by virtue 
of the separation of the plasma from the erythrocyte 
fraction. Because of what may have been an adsorption 
of the interfering material on the outside of the red 
cells, the separation was not always complete, and 
interfering colour still remained in a considerable 
number of the red cell fractions. 

2. Washing Bed Cell Fraction . 

We then attempted to rid the red blood cells more 
completely of plasma by washing them four times in 1 %> 
saline, discarding each washing. The cells, suspended 
in a 1 % saline solution to give about a 50 % concentra¬ 
tion of cells, were then carried through the test. It 
was found that precipitation was not satisfactory unr 
less a weaker acetic acid was used. We substituted 
0.0020 N acetic acid for the usual 0.0030 N strength

and obtained good results. 

With the adoption of this method we found that it 
was possible to get rid of interference in the majority 
of cases. To see if these was any loss of ergothioneine 
in the course of this procedure, the following test was 
run. One sample which gave a value of 6.9 mg.$ corp¬ 
uscles was allowed to develop interference. When the 
red blood cells were washed,a good ergothioneine colour 
was again observed with a reading of 7.0 mg.% corpuscles, 
checking closely with the original known value of 6.9 
m g.$. 

Some of the values found in the blood samples with 
interference, both before and after the saline-washing 
procedure, are shown in Table 13. It will be seen that 
there was no consistent relationship between the values 
for the washed cells and the whole blood. The final 
colour in all washed cell samples was the violet-pink 
of ergothioneine, and we felt confident that the reading 
obtained was reliable in each case. Haematocrit values 
were found for the suspensions of red blood cells in 
saline and the values per cent corpuscles were calculated. 

Samples showing interference may or may not exhibit 
proportionality between the 1 and 2 ml. aliquots. The 
interfering colour may cause an apparent increase or 
decrease in the true ergothioneine reading. No

estimate can be made of the degree of direction of 
correction from the resulting bronze colour in a sample 
with interference. It should also be stated that we 
have found the washing method (for getting rid of inter¬ 
ference) is not always successful when used on a blood 
with initial interference, which has been allowed to 
stand for some time. This procedure is also obviously 
inapplicable to any specimen which is hemolysed on 
receipt. 

In summary, the following observations have been 

made: 

1. Although we have not yet established the identity 
of the interfering material, we have discovered several 
factors associated with its production. 

2. Ascorbic acid is a possible cause. Ascorbic acid 
or one of its degradation products may act on the 
imidazole ring of ergothioneine, or in some undetermined 
way modify the ergothioneine structure. 

3. Several suggestions are offered for reducing the 
incidence of interference in blood samples. 

4. In most cases which have developed even complete 
interference a reliable value can be established by the 
saline-washing technique.

DISEASES INVESTIGATED 


DIABETES ..iELLITUS 


The diabetic group of 107 hospital patients was 
compared with the normal group of 94 persons. 50.9% of 
the diabetics were males and 49.1% females; 80.8% of 
the normal group were males and 19.2% females. A 
comparison of the two groups is shown in Table 14.

It will be seen from Figure 2 that this difference 
was caused by diabetics who had ergothioneine values 
greater than 14.5 mg.%. No normal person had a value 
greater than 17.7 mg.%. The range for normals extended 
from 3.9 to 17.7 mg.% and the range for diabetics 
from 2.0 to 60.2 mg.%. Seventeen diabetic patients 
(15.9% of the total number of diabetics) exceeded the 
highest normal value. 

Because the mean of the age of the normal group 
was much lower than that of the diabetic series it was 
felt that a comparison of ergothioneine levels in dif¬ 
ferent age groups in the normal should be made.

It will be seen in Table 15 that the ergothioneine 
value in the 45 - 63 year interval was greater than the 
mean for the group as a whole. The increase was not pro¬ 
gressive throughout the group, however, and on comparison 
of two approximately equal number of patients from the 
25 - 29 year interval (38 patients) and the 30 - 63 year 
interval (27 patients) we found no significant difference 
between the means. 

The diabetic series was then divided into age 
groups, and in contrast to the normal group, showed a 
somewhat lower value in the older age intervals.

On comparing the age group 2-59 (43 patients) with 
the age group 60-89, (33 patients) the difference of the 
means was not found to be significant. 

The state of diabetic control and the duration of 
diabetes, two factors which might have borne some rela¬ 
tion to ergothioneine level in diabetics, were then 
examined.

Table 17 shows a comparison of the poorly controlled 
and the well controlled diabetics in the series. A his¬ 
tory of the state of control was obtained in 82 of the 
107 patients. A comparison showed that no significant 
difference existed in ergothioneine levels of well and 
poorly controlled diabetics. In 17 diabetics previously 
referred to who had levels higher than the highest normal 
value of 17.7 mg.%, 11 or 64.7% were severe diabetics or 
were poorly controlled. There were,however, 6 (35.3%)

often mild diabetics. 

A comparison was made between diabetics who had a 
history of the disease for less than 10 years and those 
who had been diabetics for 10 years or longer. The his¬ 
tory of duration of diabetes was obtained in 64 of the 
107 patients.

There was no significant difference between the 
means of the diabetics with recent disease or those 
with long-standing diabetes, as shown in Table 18. 

Two patients, admitted in diabetic coma, with 
blood glucose levels of over 400 mg.% and C0 2 combining 
power of 40 vol•$, were found to have normal ergo- 
thioneine values which did not change on control of their

diabetic state. 

One patient in insulin shock with a blood glucose 
of 47 mg.$ showed an increase of ergothioneine to 17.1 
mg.% from a previous reading of 6.9 mg.% the same day, 
with a return to the lower level when next tested five days 
days later. Because of this observation samples of 
blood were taken from four patients being treated with 
sub-shock doses of insulin on a pyychiatric service. 

These were obtained at six-thirty in the morning and 
again about nine-thirty a.m., by which time the symptoms 
of hypoglycemia from the early morning insulin were 
maximal. There was no difference in the ergothioneine 
levels in any pair of specimens. 

In eleven patients from whom samples had been 
obtained at various times during the same day, usually^ 
at 8 a.m., 11 a.m. and 2 p.m., there was no apparent 
relation to meals or to the time of day at which the 
specimens were taken. 

A diabetic patient examined pre-operatively and 
post-operatively (hip-nailing) showed a post-operative 
rise to 16.1 mg.$ of ergothioneine from a previous 
level of 9.4 mg.%, and still showed the higher level 
four days later. No other operative patients were ex¬ 
amined. 

The lowest value in diabetes - 2.0 mg.% - was 
found in a sixty-eight year female who was controlled

low value of 4.2 mg.% was observed in a patient who 
had a fasting glucose of 250 mg.$ and who was also 
being treated for cystitis and mild congestive heart 
failure. 

Ergothioneine estimations were made on a well 
controlled diabetic student at monthly intervals. The 
small fluctuations seen in Figure 3 cannot be explained 
by any change in his diet, which is necessarily more 
restricted than that of a normal person, nor by any 
change in diabetic control which has been excellent - 
over this period. Similar small fluctuations can be 
seen in ergothioneine levels of 4 normal subjects 
taken over comparable periods of time. 

Non-protein nitrogen, uric acid, and blood 
cholesterol values in 25, 34 and 54 patients respect¬ 
ively, showed no correlation with the ergothioneine 
content of the same blood.

TUBERCULOSI S 

Blood ergothioneine levels were determined in 65 
Indian and 4 Eskimo patients, all with some type of 
tuberculosis. The mean ergothioneine value for these 
69 patients was 18.0 mg.%, a level well above the 
normal mean of 9.6 mg.fc (Table 19). This series was 
divided into smaller groups according to type of 
tuberculosis and the clinical degree of infection. 
Although it may not be a significant finding, it is 
interesting to note the gradual decrease in mean 
ergothioneine value which corresponds to the increase 
in severity of the tuberculosis. Eor example, two 
patients who subsequently died had levels of 7.6 and 
19.0 m g.% 9 and three others with far advanced tuber¬ 
culosis showed levels of 6.7, 6.9 and 11.5 mg.fo. As 
shown in Table 19 the mean ergothioneine value for 
far advanced tuberculosis was approximately 5 m.g.fo 
lower than that for controlled or minimal tuberculosi 

Single cases each of renal tuberculosis and 
tuberculoma exhibited extraordinarily high values. 

In the course of the studies on tuberculosis in 
Indians,we made estimations on three patients* who 
were admitted as tuberculosis suspects, and who sub-

sequently proved to be negative. We also determined 
the ergothioneine level of one patient admitted for 
treatment of a congenital dislocation of the hip. The 
surprising findings were ergothioneine values of 14.5, 
23.6, 22.1 and 42.6 mg.$ respectively. The first three 
cases all suffered from some other lung disease, but 
the three year old boy with the congenital hip dis¬ 
location was apparently otherwise well. 

We felt that peculiarities in diet might account 
for differences in ergothioneine levels in these races, 
but on inquiry we found that many cases showing high 
ergothioneine values had been on routine hospital 
diets for as long as three years. We also noted that 
new admissions frequently showed values close to normal 
limits. 

We then attempted to make a series of estimations 
on blood from white patients with tuberculosis. Al¬ 
though approximately 50 samples were obtained,few 
ergothioneine values were determined because of the 
high incidence of interference. These estimations were 
made in part prior to the development of the washing- 
technique for overcoming interference; many other 
samples had too little blood to permit washing. As a 
result only 9 estimations were completed. The results 
are given in Table 20. The range of ergothioneine

(normal white and tuberculous white patients) was 
found to be statistically significant.

. VARIOUS OTHER DISEASES 

Small numbers of patients with various other 
diseases were investigated when the opportunity arose. 

To facilitate analysis, some of these were grouped 
under broader classifications. An attempt was made to 
do this only with closely related conditions. These 
are presented in ascending order of the mean ergo- 
thioneine values, together with their ranges, in Table 
21. The significant clinical and laboratory findings 
are presented for each individual patient in tables 
to be found in the addendum. In some cases complete 
histories were not available from the hospital re¬ 
cords, but all available abnormal or significant 
findings are given. 

In reviewing the 23 conditions presented in Table 
21 we felt that the means of the ergothioneine values 
in the diseases numbered from 16 to 23 were sufficiently 
high to justify a statistical comparison with the 
normal mean. The standard deviation, standard error 
of the mean, t value calculated and t value at the 1% 
and 5$ level of significance are shown in Table 22. 

There is a highly significant increase in mean ergo¬ 
thioneine values found in diseases numbered 18 - 23. 

It was interesting to find that the mean of the group

"Diabetes mellitus with associated diseases" was ident¬ 
ical with the value found for the mean in the larger 
number of diabetics reported earlier in this paper who 
were suffering from no other major disease. 

All cases were then listed in which the ergo- 
thioneine value exceeded the highest normal value of 
17.7 mg.%. In Table.23 the history and laboratory 
findings of each patient are given in the hope of find¬ 
ing some common factor. Such as factor is not apparent. 

The table includes five other categories as well as the 
eight (16-23) listed in Table 22. Two of the five 
patients had been given transfusions prior to the 
ergothioneine determination; one of the other three 
was suffering from some kidney failure 9 The only high 
value from a miscellaneous group of diseases (Addendum, 

A.) was found in blood from a young woman with chronic 
pelvic inflammatory disease. 

Blood ergothioneine levels were determined on two 
patients receiving cortisone. The first was a case of 
leukemia who was moribund when the blood sample was 
obtained, four days after starting the drug. There was 
no change from the initial blood ergothioneine level 
of 9.4 mg.fc. The second was a case of lupus erythematosis 
in whom the initial ergothioneine level was 11.3 mg.$ 

(the test being performed on washed cells because of 
interference.). On March 14 cortisone therapy was started.

Blood ergothioneine levels on March 18, March 22 and , 
March 31 were 7.6, 8.2 and 8.8 mg.°/o respectively. 
Cortisone therapy had no apparent effect on blood 
ergothioneine levels in these two patients. 

17 e took the opportunity of making simultaneous 
ergothioneine estimations on peripheral blood and bone 
marrow in a patient suffering from aleukemic leukemia. 
An ergothioneine value of 10.4 mg.® was found in the 
peripheral blood, and a higher level of 14.9 mg.$ in 
the bone marrow. This difference in values was suggest¬ 
ive of increased concentration of ergothioneine in 
young cells. This possibility was further supported 
by the finding that ergothioneine values increased, 
after 3 to 4 days, in rats which were subjected to 
repeated bleeding during that period of time (33).

EXPERIMENTAL 

The purpose of this investigation was to determine 
whether there was any variation in blood ergothioneine 
in human disease states, and whether there was any 
significant difference between these values and those 
found in normal human blood. The work so far presented 
shows that ergothioneine values fall within a moderately 
narrow range in normal subjects. It also demonstrates 
that a wide range of values can be expected in nine 
disease categories. From our examination of these 
findings there does not appear to be any factor common 
to these diseases. Certain minor experimental problems 
did occur to us, however, and these are described below. 

Ergothioneine in Alloxan Diabetes 

A number of reports have been published on the 
protection of experimental animals from alloxan diabetes 
by the prior injection of glutathione, cysteine and 
related compounds (34, 35, 36, 37). In conjunction with 
another member of this department (Mr. D.W. Gee), who 
is reporting this work in full, we conducted a similar 
experiment on 4 rats, using ergothioneine as a "pro™ 
tecting" substance. All four control rats developed 
diabetes following the intravenous injection of alloxan 
(40 mg. per Kg. body weight). Three of the four rats

which were given ergothioneine intravenously (0.09 

* 

millimols) 1-3 minutes prior to the injection of 
alloxan, failed to develop diabetes. This result ap¬ 
peared to be significant because the reports in the 
literature suggested that 0.75 - 7.00 millimols*of 
glutathione, and equivalent amounts of other effective 
compounds, are needed to protect the rat from alloxan 
diabetes. Other workers (34) who used the same amount 
of intravenous alloxan as we did, found that the smaller 
amount protected 60 - 100% of the rats from developing 
diabetes. It can be seen that the amount of ergothioneine 
that we injected when calculated in millimols, was 
equivalent to only l/8 to l/lO of the amounts of other 
sulfhydryl containing substances which have been found 
necessary to give comparable protection. 

The Effect of Blood Loss on Ergothioneine Values 

Work done by another member of this department 
(Miss M.S. Fraser) on ergothioneine levels in rats 
suggested that an increase in ergothioneine values 
occurred when rats were bled. For this reason estimations 
were made on students who donated blood to the Red Gross 
Blood Donor Glinic. These estimations carried out be¬ 
fore the donation, and at 1 and 2 weeks after the don¬ 
ation. The results are tabulated in Table 24.

At the end of one week ergothioneine values showed 
both increases and decreases from the initial levels. 

By the end of the second week the ergothioneine levels 
of all subjects were higher than their respective 
initial values, even though in some cases the difference 
was small. 

Perhaps we may be permitted to speculate upon 
these findings. Rats used in this experiment were kept 
on a diet of constant quality, and for that reason the 
available amount of ergothioneine, or any precursor of 
that substance, was presumably constant. Why, then,

should an increase in haematopoietic activity have 
caused an increase in concentration of corpuscular 
ergothioneine? There is no reason to expect that 
bleeding per se should cause an increase in the amount 
of ergothioneine incorporated into each cell. Imagine 
then, that every red blood cell begins its life with a 
proportionately higher and completes it with a rela¬ 
tively lower concentration of ergothioneine. The ergo¬ 
thioneine value per cent corpuscles would then depend 
on three factors: 

1. the availability to the organism of ergothioneine 
or its precursor. 

2. the size of the erythrocyte. 

3. the proportion of young to mature erythrocytes in 
the blood. 

The following findings suggest that this aspect of 
the problem should be investigated. 

1. Blood ergothioneine levels of rats are affected by 
changes in the diet (33). 

2. Repeated bleeding of rats, and to a lesser extent 
blood loss in normal human subjects appear to be 
associated with a rise in ergothioneine values. 

3. In the one case investigated, a higher ergothioneine 
level was found in human bone marrow than in the cor¬ 
responding peripheral blood.

Fate of Ergothioneine Injected Intravenously Into Rats 

Ten mg. of ergothioneine was injected into the 
tail vein of a normal rat. One hour later the blood 
ergothioneine level was exactly equal to the pre-injection 
level. We had noted high ergothioneine levels in some 
patients suffering from kidney failure, and for this 
reason we wished to learn whether ergothioneine might be 
excreted by the kidneys. No satisfactory test was 
available for the quantitative measurement of ergo¬ 
thioneine in the urine. Working in conjunction with 
another member of this department (Miss M.S. Fraser) 
who is reporting this work in full, we performed 
bilateral nephrectomies on two rats. Ten mg. of ergo¬ 
thioneine was then injected into the tail veins of 
these nephrectomized rats. One hour later the whole 
blood of each showed an increase in ergothioneine value, 
but in both cases the increase was shown to be due to 
the presence of ergothioneine in the plasma, from which 
it is normally absent. The ergothioneine value of the 
corpuscles remained constant. We concluded that when 
ergothioneine is injected into a normal rat the kidneys 
play a part in excreting the excess. We did not attempt 
a quantitative explanation for the disposition of the 
injected ergothioneine, but it was also apparent from 
the degree of increase in blood ergothioneine after

injection that much of the ergothioneine had "been re-, 
moved from the circulation. In these two rats it could 
not have been removed by the kidneys. One of the rats 
was given a second injection of 10 mg. of ergothioneine 
intramuscularly. After the second injection we found a 
further increase in blood ergothioneine, and all of 
this increase appeared in the plasma. Once more we were 
unable to account for all the material injected. From 
these experiments three conclusions were reached: 

1. In the normal rat injected ergothioneine is quickly 
removed from the circulating plasma, and the kidneys 
appear essential for at least part of this function. 

2. Ergothioneine is removed to a considerable degree 
from the plasma of rats in which urinary excretion is 
prevented; or it exists in some other form than ergo¬ 
thioneine. 

3. There is no appreciable transfer of ergothioneine 
from plasma to cells in vivo. 

Plasma-erythrocyte Transference of Ergothioneine 1ft fritro 

Two aliquots of a blood sample were taken and an 
unweighed amount of ergothioneine (prepared by Miss M.S. 
Fraser) was added to one. Wach aliquot was well mixed 
and allowed to stand for one hour at room temperature. 

The plasma and cells were then separated, and the cells 
of each aliquot washed 4 times with saline to remove any 
plasma? The cells of the aliquot to which the ergo¬ 
thioneine had been added gave an ergothioneine value of

9.8 mg.% and the cells of the aliquot to which no 
ergothioneine had been added gave a value of 10.1 mg.%. 
The plasma ergothioneine value of the aliquot with 
added ergothioneine was 5.7 mg.$. The plasma of the 
control aliquot gave the usual "ergothioneine-equiv- 
alent" value of 1.2 mg.$ (no ergothioneine colour). 

A second sample of normal fresh blood was also 
divided into two lots and ergothioneine added to the 
second aliquot. Both aliquots were mixed thoroughly 
and allowed to stand for one hour. The increase found 
in the second aliquot was equal to 2.3 mg.% ergo¬ 
thioneine. The plasma of the second aliquot gave a 
value of 5.2 mg.%. When the plasma percentage (100 - 
haematocrit) of the second aliquot was taken into 
consideration, the ergothioneine value contributed to 
the whole blood ergothioneine reading of the second 
aliquot was 2.1 mg.$. This is close to the total in¬ 
crease determined for this aliquot (2.3 mg.$). The 
plasma, therefore appeared to contain all the added 
ergothioneine. 

This evidence suggests that the red cell membrane 
is impermeable to ergothioneine, or at least that there 
is no free plasma-erythrocyte diffusion. The incorpor¬ 
ation of ergothioneine into the red cell during its 

*No appreciable amount of ergothioneine was found in the 
saline washings.

initial stages of development would explain the rather 
slow appearance of changes in ergothioneine values in 
experimental animals. 


CONCLUSION 

There are many aspects of this problem which should 
be explored. Comparatively few biochemical or physio¬ 
logical studies have been made. Our work shows that these 
are indicated. In all normal subjects who were investi¬ 
gated there was a range of only 14 mgand a standard 
deviation of 3.1 mg .%. The abnormal findings in various 
diseases emphasize the yet unanswered question of 
function. It seems unlikely that there would be no role 
assigned to a constituent of such a vital structure as 
the red blood cell, especially since ergothioneine has 
been shown to possess a definite oxidation-reduction 
potential, (38).

SUMMARY 

1. The Hunter diazo test was used for the determination 
of blood ergothioneine values in 401 reported 
patients and 94 normal subjects. 

2. The calculation of the amount of ergothioneine per 
cent corpuscles was modified by taking into con¬ 
sideration the additional value contributed by 
plasma. 

3. The problem of the development of an interfering 
colour in the test was investigated and methods 
suggested for avoiding and removing this effect. 

4. A range and mean ergothioneine value were est¬ 
ablished for normal subjects. 

5. Blood from 107 diabetic patients was compared for 
mean ergothioneine content with blood from 94 
normal subjects. A highly significant increase was 
demonstrated in the mean value for diabetics. No 
relationship was established between the blood 
ergothioneine level and any one of the following 
factors: diabetic state of control, duration of 
diabetes, age, sex, blood cholesterol, uric acid, 
or non-protein nitrogen. 

6. Blood ergothioneine levels*of both white and native 
(Indian and Eskimo) patients were found to be 
significantly higher than the mean ergothioneine

of normal white subjects. No ergothioneine estim¬ 
ations were made on a normal native population. 

Four native patients with diseases other than tuber¬ 
culosis had high ergothioneine levels. 

7. Blood ergothioneine estimations were made on 294 
other patients with various diseases. Increases in 
the ergothioneine mean which were statistically 
significant were found in gall bladder disease, 
coronary disease and hypertensive cardiovascular 
disease, diabetes with associated disease, fractures, 
upper respiratory infections, gynecological oper¬ 
ative conditions, nephritis, nephrosis and urinary 
obstruction, and dermatitis. 

8. No absorption of ergothioneine by the corpuscles 
from plasma could be shown either in vivo or in 
vitro. 

9. Ergothioneine,injected into rats which had been 
subjected to bilateral nephrectomies, was found only 
in the plasma fraction of the blood. 

10. The desirability of further studies on the physiology 
and pharmacology of this blood constituent is stressed.
