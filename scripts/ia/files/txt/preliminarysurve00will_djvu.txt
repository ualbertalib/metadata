ABSTRACT 


In the summers of 1950 and 1951? a survey was 
made of the Rodentia^and Lagomorpha in central and southern 
Alberta, 

Mechanical traps were set every night, when 
weather permitted, and these were checked every morning. 

All animals were identified and recorded by the author. The 
dead animals were then chloroformed and the ectoparasites 
were scraped from the skin and hair. These parasites were 
sorted, preserved and levelled for expert identification. 

The animals in the best condition were measured, skinned 
and labelled. The animal skins are now in the Department 
of Public Health museum. 

The tentative range of most rodent and lagomorph 
species in Alberta was mapped from all available data and 
correlated with vegetation and settlement areas. 

Most animals either shot, trapped or found dead 
were autopsied. If enlarged buboes were noted, sections of 
lung, liver and spleen were sent to the Dominion Virological 
Laboratory at Kamloops, B. C., for bacteriological testing. 

During the summer of 1951* two new records of 
rodents were procured by the author. The pocket mouse 
(Perognathus fasciat us) and the harvest mouse ( Reithrodon - 
tocuys megalotis) , trapped in southeastern Alberta, can 


now be added to the growing list of this province’s mammals.

A PRELIMINARY SURVEY OF RODENTS AND LAGOMORPHS 


IN CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN ALBERTA 


INTRODUCTION 

11 The rodents present a vast array of mammals. 

About 345 genera, containing 6,400 forms, are listed in 
a recent monograph prepared in the British Museum.” (A. L. 
Rand, 1948). 

The older taxonomists include the Simpliciden- 
tata 1 and the Duplicidentata 2 as suborders of the order 
Rodentia. More modern American authors have split the 
order Rodentia in two. The Simplicidentata now constitute 
the order Rodentia and the Duplicidentata the order 
'Lagomorpha. 

In Alberta, there are 26 genera and 40 species 
of Rodents with a number of recognized and doubtless some 
unrecognized subspecies. The lagomorphs are a small group 
which include 3 genera: • of these the varying hare is cyclic 
periodically attaining vast numbers. 

■^-Simplicidentata means that the mammal has 2 upper incisors. 
^Duplicidentata means that the mammal has 2 pairs of upper in¬ 
cisors. The smaller pair is situated behind the larger pair.

The variations in size, form and habitat are strik- 
ing. This partly perhaps due to the fact that Alberta 
occupies about 255*285 square miles and thus affords great 
differences in environment within the province. A pocket 
mouse, which weighs approximately one-third of an ounce, 
is dwarfed completely by a beaver, which may weigh over 
3,360 times as much. Included are the arboreal squirrels, 
the semivolant "flying” squirrels, the fossorial ground 
squirrels and pocket gophers, the semi-aquatic muskrats 
and beavers and the kangaroo-like jumping mice. These 
mammals are all Sirred but the American porcupine also 
has quills. The only general common feature is the 
type of dentition. 

Rodents include some species which are of great 
economic value but others are unmitigated pests. The 
trapping of fur-bearing animals and fur farming are 
profitable Alberta industries. In the fiscal year 1947-48, 
there were 463*193 wild muskrats alone taken in Alberta 
which yielded $1,097*767*41 to the trappers; wild squirrels 
were second at $819*059.01 and beavers next at $251*665.20. 
Apart from wild fur, there were 14 licensed beaver farms and 
9 muskrat farms. Fur-bearing carnivores may depend on rod¬ 
ents and lagomorphs for sustenance and many of these pred- 
ors feed almost entirely on mice, ground squirrels and 
rabbits. Thus, these mammals are contributing in dollars 
and cents to the revenue of Alberta.

In the debit column, however, hay fields, 
orchards, gardens, irrigation ditches and golf courses are 
damaged by burrowing spermophiles, pocket gophers and field 
mice. The method of controlling each species depends on 
its habitat and habits. 

The Norway rat^ which has now emigrated, to 
Alberta from Saskatchewan, constitutes another menace, 
first as a destroyer of grains, cereals and other food¬ 
stuffs, and secondly, as a threat to public health. The 
rat, as well as the Richardson ground squirrel, acts as 
a reservoir for sylvatic plague. 

Since the original records made of some of the 
animals in the Prairie Provinces by Sir John Richardson 
in the 1820’s there have been numerous biological sur¬ 
veys conducted in Western Canada. Capt. Palliser (1863) 
records Arctomys richardscnii ( Citellus richardsoni i) 
and Arctomys hoodii ( Citellus tridecemlineatus ) on his 
westward journey from Fort Ellice (near Carlton Sask.). 

In the early part of the 20th Century biological surveys 
were conducted (in Alberta) by the U. S. Division of 
Biological Investigations. 

The following men, Americans and Canadians, have 
conducted comprehensive surveys of the mammals in Alberta: 

E. A. Preble, N. Hollister, J. D. Soper, P. E. Crowe, 

F. W. A. Banfield, J. E. Moore and J. H. Brown. 





















.

. 









The present survey was made while the author was 
employed by J. H. Brown to assist with the disease studies 
on small mammals. From April 24th to September 12th, 1950 
and from April 26th to September 8th, 1951 as junior man 
on Mr. Brown*s public health survey crew, I recorded, 
observed, collected and skinned rodents and lagomorphs 
from various sections of central and southern Alberta. 

Part of the time was spent on a provincial rat survey 
but most of the time was devoted to the sylvatic plague, 
tularaemia and Rocky Mountain spotted fever surveys. 

The methods used in collecting material were 

adapted from R. M. Anderson* s publication, ’’Collecting 

And Preserving Vertebrate Animals” (1948), with further 

improvements later suggested by Mr. J. H. Brown, Mr. J. 

e. 

Dewey Soper of the Federal Wildlife Division, Dr. J. B-. 
Moore and Mr. Robert Lister of the University of Alberta. 

The animals were caught in a variety of traps; 
the numbers 00 and 1 steel spring traps, the large rat 
and weasel snap traps, the standard mouse traps and 
museum special mouse traps were used. The traps were all 
baited with a mixture of rolled oats, peanut butter and 
oil of aniseed with a few drops of oil of valerian added. 

The date, location, trap nights and species were 
recorded and are to be found in Appendix B. A catalogue 
of the animal skins may be found in Appendix A.

In all collections made in southern and central 
Alberta during the summers of 1950 and 1951? it was 
impossible to make subspecific determinations. These 
can be made only if the collector has opportunity to com¬ 
pare his skins with a vast series of type specimens.

PART I. ORDER RODENTIA 

SECTION I. DESCRIPTION AND DISTRIBUTIONAL NOTES. 

In Alberta eight families of the Order Rodentia 
are recognized. The forty species which are included in 
these families are identified by a number of key character¬ 
istics. Most species mentioned are described according 
to these characteristics. Whenever enough data are avail¬ 
able, detailed maps, as well as notes on rodent distribution 
are included. 

Vegetation types give fair indications of animal 
distribution. Moss* map (1932) gives a rough picture of 
the chief types of vegetation (the Cypress Hills area is, 
however, omitted) (refer to Map 1). The soil zones of 
Alberta are classified as follows* the northern forest 
with gray soil; the poplar area with black soil; the park¬ 
land area with black soil; the northern prairie with dark 
brown soil; the southern prairie with brown soil* The 
tentative distribution boundaries for most rodent species, 
herein after used, will be in accordance with the various 
vegetation areas set out by Moss:. 

Family 1 » Sciuridae (The squirrels, g, flying ,s squirrels, 
ground squirrels, marmots and chipmunks) 

The total length of these rodents varies from 
























j.

200 mm. in the least chipmunk to about 750 mm. in the 
hoary marmot. The tails of the Sciuridae are hairy and 
often bushy. Postorbital spines are always present on 
the frontal bones. The skull is not strongly flattened. 
There are no external cheek pouches. 

Genus Marmota 

Marmota monax (Canadian woodchuck or ground hog) 

Color* The dorsum is rust-colored and the gaurd 
hairs are tipped with white. Melanistic forms occur in 
Alberta in which the pile hair is black but the gaurd 
hairs are silver-tipped (Plate 1). 

Measurements* Total length 468 mm.; tail length 
119 mm.; hind foot length 62 mm. (one Alberta specimen). 

Special markings * Dark brown head, tail,, fore 
and hind legs. 

According to Rand (1948), the subspecies occur¬ 
ring in Alberta is Marinota monax canadensis (Erxleben). 

Distribution ? This animal is found in wooded 
areas. Rand (1948) states the animal in Alberta to be in 
"the northern part of the province, south at least to 
Entrance (Crowe), Red Deer River (Howell) and the vicinity 
of Islay and Edmonton 1 *. Soper (1948) reports it to be 
"distributed in varying degrees of abundance" in the 
Grande Prairie-Peace River region.

— C) - 

Marmota caligata (Hoary marmot, whistler or siffleur) 
Color : The stout body is covered with black 
and white hair which is shaded with buff, thus giving the 
animal a grizzled appearance. 

The three subspecies occurring in Alberta are;, 
according to R. M. Anderson (19^6): 

1. Marmota caligata vivaria Howell 

2. Marmota caligata okanagana (King) 

3. Marmota caligata o%ytona Hollister 

Ho specimens of this rodent were taken in Alberta 
because suitable traps were not set in the higher mountain 
regions* 

Distribution s This is a mountain animal. Soper 
(1935) has taken specimens from Banff, Mount Forget-me-not 
and Torrens River, and noted this animal at Louise, 

Morraine and Consolation Lakes in the Rocky Mountains;. 
Banfield (1950) reports this species H in the Rowe Lakes, 
Carthew Lakes and Tivin Lakes areas” in Waterton National 
Park* 

Marmota flaviventris (Buff-bellied marmot) 

J. E. Moore has one official record of this 
species from Aden* 


Genus Cltellus 


Ground Squirrels

curious distribution problem, i.e., they are not found 
in the Peace River country (refer to Map 2). This, I 
believe, can be explained by the fact that the vast, 
heavily wooded muskeg areas, which extend from Smith to 
High Prairie, form an effective geographical barrier to 
the dispersal of the spermophiles. 

Citellus richardsonii (Flickertail or Richardson ground 

squirrel) 

Color s This species; shows; a great variation in 
hair color in different localities throughout the province, 
but this is possibly due to the fact that the pelage may 
become worn or bleached throughout the summer. The animal 
is sandy-brown on top and light brown underneath, but true 
albino skins have been seen (Plate 3). 

Measurements^ Total length 275 mm.; tail length 
69 mm.; hind foot length 44 mm. (average from three 
specimens). 

Special markings ! The belly and underparts; are 
whitish. The tail is a grizzled brown and black. 

Sexs On examination of Mr. J. H. Brown's data 
from the sylvatic plague survey/, the following sex ratio 
can be recorded.

Thus, the average sex ratio for three years for 
Richardson 9 s ground squirrel was? 1 male to 1*5^- females or 
approximately 2 males; to every 3 females;. 

The only subspecies present in Alberta is 
Citellus rlchardsonil richardsonii (Sabine) according to 
Anderson (19^6). 

Distribution s; The Richardson ground squirrel 
ranges widely over Alberta. The distribution is affected 
by land settlement areas (Map 2).As land is cleared, the 
ground squirrels advance to the newly cultivated land. 
Lawson in 1922 stated that this animal 9 is found charac¬ 
teristically over all the open prairie country of the 
southern part of the province as far north as the Battle 
River 1 . In 1950 and 1951? numerous animals were seen, 
trapped and shot as far north as Westlock, Smoky Lake and 
St. Paul de Metis, Alberta. Thus, this species, in a 
period of twenty-nine years has moved north more than 
seventy miles and ne\tf colonies have become established 
in an area exceeding ten thousand square miles in the 
cleared farm areas.

The flickertail has never been recorded north 
or west of the Athabasca River. Therefore, the tentative 
range follows the public land settlement area except from 
Whitecourt to Smith, Alberta, where it is found on the 
south bank of the Athabasca River. This animal is not 
found in the Empress area between the Red Deer and South 
Saskatchewan River. Whether of not the disappearance 
here and also in certain other areas is due to its chief 
predator, the rattlesnake, is not known. 

This animal can be seen living in the same 
territory as the Columbian ground squirrel in the eastern 
Waterton area. 

Map b shows the Alberta distribution of Citellus 
richardsonii . The range was worked out from the unpub¬ 
lished records from some sylvatic plague investigations 
from 19*+*+ to 1950, carried on by J. H. Brown for the 
Alberta government. 

Citellus franklinii (Franklin 1 s ground squirrel or 

bush gopher) 

Color : The top of the head, neck, feet and 
underparts are light gray in contrast with the dorsum, 
which is dark gray, speckled with yellow (Plate 3). 

Measurements ; Total length 390 mm.; tail length 
131 mm.; hind foot length 53 nim. (average of 2 specimens).

records of Citellus Columbianus 


and C. richardsonii 






















- 16 - 


Special markings ; The tail is long and bushy 
with a white marginal and a black submarginal band. 

Anderson (1946) states the animal occurring in 
Alberta is Citellus franklinii (Sabine). 

D istribution : (Refer to Map 3). The Franklin 

ground squirrel is found in the northern part of Southern 
Alberta. It occurs in the cordilleran forest and in the 
poplar area. As more and more land is cleared in Alberta 
and land settlement increases, this animal will, I believe, 
become a great deal rarer. Like the thirteen-striped 
ground squirrel, this animal has never been seen north 
or west of the Athabasca River. 

Citellus c olumbianus (Mountain gopher, picket pin or 

Columbian ground squirrel) 

Color : This mountain ground squirrel has a 
dun-colored back vermiculated with black. The underparts 
are cinnamon-colored and are quite diagnostic. 

Measurements : Total length 304 mm .5 tail length 
93 mm .5 hind foot length 46 mm. (average from 2 specimens). 

Special markings : The upper parts of the feet 
and face are brick red. 

The subspecies found in Alberta is Citellus 
columbianus Columbian us (Ord) according to Rand (1948). 

Disbribution s (Refer to Map 4) This species 
is a mountain animal but it is also found in the foothills 


in Western Alberta

Citellus lateralis 


(Mantled ground squirrel, mantled 
gopher or big chipmunk) 

Color s The ventrum is light red and each side 
has two black stripes which enclose a light-colored stripe. 
The tail is dark brown with a yellow margin (Plate 3). 

Measurements : Total length 267 mm.; tail length 
96 mm.; hind foot length 46 mm. (1 specimen). 

Special marking : The black-bordered white line 
on each side is quite diagnostic. 

The subspecies occurring in Alberta is Citellus 
lateralis tescorum Holloster according to Anderson (1946). 

Distribution s (Refer to Map 3). The range of 
this animal is limited to the higher mountain regions. 

Citellus tridecemlineatus (Thirteen-striped gopher) 

Color s The upper parts have a series of six 
light stripes and five dark stripes. Each light stripe 
alternates with a dark stripe. Each dark stripe has a 
series of dots which usually number thirteen and they 
extend from the nape to the base of the tail (Plate 3). 

Measurements : Total length 26 7*5 mm.; tail length 
89.5 mm.; hind foot length 34.5 mm* (from 2 specimens). 

The two subspecies recorded by R. M. Anderson 
(1946) ares 

1. Citellus tridecemlineatus tridecemlineatus 
(Mitehi11) 

2. Citellus tridecemlineatu s pallidus (Allen)

Distribution : (Refer to Map 3). This animal is 
found in isolated colonies in Central and Southern Alberta. 
It always seems to occur in semi-wooded areas. I have never 
seen this animal north or west of the Athabasca River. 

Genus Eutamias 

Eutamias minimus (Least chipmunk) 

Color s The sides and back are grayish-brown 
with five black stripes interspaced by two lateral white 
stripes and two median gray stripes. The head is brown 
with a blackish line running through the eye. This black 
line is flanked by two white lines which border on black 
(Plate 4). 

Measurements : Total length 210 mm.; tail length 
101 mm.; hind foot length 29 mm. (average of 3 specimens). 

Special markings : The key characteristics are 
the brown rump, shoulders and hind legs and the white belly. 

The two subspecies listed by A. L. Rand (1948) are: 

1. Eutamias minimus borealis Allen 

2. Eutamias minimus oreocetes Merriam 
Distribution: (Refer to Map 5). This species 

is widespread in Alberta and is to be expected everywhere 
in the northern and southern prairie regions. J. E. Moore, 
however, has taken a specimen in the wooded Cypress Hills 


area

Eutainias amoenus (Allen chipmunk) 

Color : The color is similar to the least chipmunk 
except that the hind legs and the rump are gray. This 
mammal usually has a grayish belly (Plate V). 

Measurements : Total length 214.5 mm.; tail length 
97 mm.; hind foot length 30 mm. (average from 4 specimens). 

There are two subspecies listed for Alberta by 
Rand (1948). They are the buff-bellied form, Eutamias 
amoenus luteiventris Allen and the light-bellied form, 
Eutamias amoenus ludibundus Hollister. 

Distribution : (Refer to Map 5). The Allen 
chipmunk is found in the mountain regions of Alberta. 
Banfield (1950) states that in Waterton it is the common 
chipmunk of the lower elevations of the Park. 

Eutamias ruficaudus (Rufous-tailed chipmunk) 

Color : The markings are similar to the least 
chipmunk but the underparts are white except for the tail 
which is rufous-colored (Plate 4). 

Measurements : Total length 231.2 mm.; tail length 
106.2 mm.; hind foot length 35 mm. (averages from Howell, 
1929). 

The subspecies recorded in Alberta by Anderson 
(1946) is Eutamias rufIcaudus ruficaudus Howell. 

Distribution : (Refer to Map 5). The range of 


this animal is limited to the Waterton area in the mountains

at higher altitudes. Banfield (1950) says this animal 
occurs in an altitude range of 5,800 to 7,000 feet and 
is well distributed in the Park. 

Tamiasciurus hudsonicus (Red squirrel) 

Color : The dorsum and tail are reddish-brown 
but the tail has a marginal black band. There is a lateral 
black band and the underparts are white (Plate 2). 

Special characteristics: The red squirrel has 
stubby, curved climbing claws on both fore and hind legs. 

The three subspecies thought by Rand (1948) to 
be present in Alberta are: 

1. Tamiasciurus hudsonicus preblei Howell 

2. Tamiasciurus h udsonicus cplumblensis Howell 
3* Tamiasciurus hudsonicus richardsoni Packman 
Distribution : The red squirrel is found commonly 

in the northern cordilleran forest and the poplar areas 
wherever there are large stands of conifers. 

Glaucomys sabrinus (Flying squirrel) 

Color : The color above is slaty-gray and the 
fur is long and fine. The belly is white in color. 

Special c ha racteristics : The fold of skin 
between the front and hind legs and the flat, wide tail 
are diagnostic of this species. 

No specimens of this mammal were taken but 
A. L. Rand (1948) has listed three subspecies: 
























. 

’

- 22 - 


1. Glaucomys sabrinus sabrinus Shaw 

2. Glaucomys sa brinus alpinus Richardson 

3. Glaucomys sabrinus bangsi Rhoads 
Distribution : Rand (1948) states that this 

animal is found in the coniferous forests of the northern 
and central parts of the province, and the mountains of 
the west. 

Family 2. Geomyidae (Pocket gophers) 

The presence of external, fur-lihed cheeck pouches, 
the medium size (250 mm.) and chunky appearance are distinc¬ 
tive. The legs are short and stout, the forelegs being 
heavily clawed. The tail is short and sparsely haired. 

Thomomys talpoides (Pocket gopher or mole) 

Color s The pile hair on the back is usually 
gray-tipped with brown, with a black ear patch on mature 
animals. The underparts are grayish, as is the tail 
(Plate 5). 

Measurements : Total length 203 mm.; tail length 
65 mm.; hind foot length 25 mm. (average from 7 specimens). 

Special characteristic s: The short, sparsely 
haired tail, the external, fur-lined cheek pouches and 
the large claws on the fore legs set this animal apart 
from other species. 

Anderson (1946) lists the following races: 

1. Thomomys talpoides talpoides Richardson 

2. Thomomys talpoides andersoni Goldman 

3. Thomomys talpoides loringi Bailey

Distribution : (Refer to Map 6). The pocket 

gopher is present in parts of central and southern Alberta 
in a vast number of isolated communities. I have never 
seen pocket gopher mounds in the Peace River country. 

Soper (1948) makes no mention of this species in the 
Grande Prairie - Peace River region. 

Family 3. Heteromyidae (Kangaroo rats and pocket mice) 

This family is rare in Alberta but is easily 
distinguished by the relatively long tails and external, 
fur-lined cheek pouches. Only 5 specimens of the pocket 
mouse have been taken in Alberta and only one specimen of 
the kangaroo rat. 

Perognathus fasciatus (Maximillian 1 s pocket mouse) 

Color : Color above is gray and on each side 
bears a thin, yellowish stripe. The underparts are white 
(Plate 6). 

Measurements : Total length 116.5 mm.; tail length 
60 mm.; hind foot length 15 mm. (average of 2 Alberta specimens). 

Special characteristics : The auditory bullae are 
large and rounded; there are external fur-lined cheek pouches. 

Rand (1948) states that the subspecies to be 
expected in Alberta is Perognathus fasciatus fasciatus Wied. 

Distribution : (Refer to Map 7)* This animal had 

not been taken in Alberta until I trapped it in the spring 
of 1951 at Manyberries, Alberta. Since that first animal 
was taken, there have been 4 other specimens collected. The 
tentative range is the southern prairie region in Alberta.

Dipodomys ordii (Kangaroo rat) 

No specimens of Dipodomys ordii terrosus Hoff- 
meister were collected but R. M. Anderson (I9V6) reports 
one preserved specimen from Medicine Hat, Alberta. 

Family 4 . Castoridae (Canadian beaver) 

These semi-aquatic animals are large in size, 
the total length is about 1,000 mm. and they have a 
typical dorso-ventrally flattened, hairless tail. 

Castor canadensis . 

The two subspecies known from Alberta (Rand, 
1948), Castor canadensis canadensis Kuhl or Castor 
canadensis missouriensis Bailey, were not taken by myself 
as my collecting permit did not allow the trapping of 
these animals, but the species has a general distribution 
through much of the province. 

Family 5 . Cricetidae (Native rats and mice) 

Except for the muskrats and pack rats which are 
approximately 500 mm. in length, the majority of the 
Cricetidae are small, varying from 120 to 200 mm. in total 
length. The tail is usually scaly or sparsely haired 
except for the pack rat. The teeth are 16 in number, and 
the cheek teeth may have two or less longitudinal series 
of tubercles, or with no tubercles but with complicated 
folds of enamel. 

Cricetine rodents have conspicuous ears and 




















- 27 - 


relatively large eyes. These characteristics make it 
easy to distinguish them from the microtine rodents, which 
have inconspicuous ears and relatively small eyes. 

Reithrodontomys megalotis (Harvest mouse) 

One female specimen has been taken in Alberta 
at Medicine Hat by Dr. Moore of the University of Alberta. 
The measurements are: total length 1^7 mm .5 tail length 
62 mm.; hind foot length 17 mm .5 ear length from notch 
12 mm. 

A male specimen was taken by the author at Milk 
River on fey 28th, 1951- The measurements are: total 
length 105 mm .5 tail length *+9 mm.; hind foot length l*f 
mm. This specimen, I believe, was the first to be taken 
in Alberta. 

Special characteristics : The presence of 
grooved upper incisors, the brown inner ear patches and 
the small size distinguish it from Peromyscus maniculatus . 
which it closely resembles (Plate 7)* 

Distribution : (Map 8 ) As far as I know, there 
are only two authentic records for this mouse in Alberta, 
already mentioned. The tentative range is the southern 
prairie zone. 

Onychomys leucogaster (Grasshopper mouse) 

Color : The color of some adults is dark gray 
but some specimens are light brown on the back. The 
underparts are white (Plate 9)*

The subspecies listed by Rand (1948) for Alberta 
is Onychomys leucogaster missouriensis (Audubon and 
Backman). 

Distribution (Map 8): The grasshopper mouse is 
found in the northern and southern prairie regions. 

Peromyscus maniculatus (Deer mouse) 

Color s The back may vary from dark yellow to 
brownish-gray but the underparts are white. The tail is 
bicolored, the upper part is brown to blacky the underpart 
is white (Plate 6). 

Measurements : Total length 1?0 mm.; tail length 
65.6 mm.; hind foot length 17*8 mm. (average from twenty- 
one specimens). 

Mr. S. Downing of the Royal Ontario Museum, 
Toronto, Ontario, uses the following key characters in 
distinguishing Peromyscus maniculatus from Peromyscus 
leucopus s

Distribution: I have never taken this animal in 
southern Alberta but J. Dewey Soper (1935) has taken this 
species from Eagle Butte, Milk River and Lodge Creek, 
Alberta. (Refer to Map 9)* 

The white-footed mouse is to be expected in the 
southern prairie zone but one specimen was taken southeast 
of Cardston, placing it in the northern prairie zone. 

Neotoma cinerea (Pack rat or bushy-tailed wood rat) 

Color : The dorsum is grayish-buff and the 
underparts are white. (Plate 9 ). 

Measurements : Total length 366.5 mm*5 tail 
length 170*5 mm.; hind foot length 79*5 mm. (average from 
two specimens). 

Special markings : The extremely long, black 
whiskers are noticeable* 

According to Rand (19^8) the subspecies in Alberta 
are: 1* Neotoma cinerea cinerea Ord 

2. Neotoma cinerea drummondi Richardson 
Distribution (Map 10): This animal is common 
among old buildings and in rock piles in the mountain 
areas in Alberta. Brown (Unpublished sylvatic plague 
survey) took this species at Milk River. It is also 
reported by farmers along the Milk River ridge.

Microtine Rodents 

Synaptomys borealis (Northern bog lemming) 

n The general vole-like appearance and colour, 
the short tail (less than twice the length of the hind 
foot), in old males the white flank spots, and the tooth 
characters are diagnostic." (Rand, 19^8). 

Distribution ? Soper ( 19 W) reports one specimen 
from Ray Lake in the Peace River country. Anderson (19*+6) 
mentions it is found in the Edmonton district and in the 
Banff and Jasper National Parks. 

Anderson (19*+6) gives the following Alberta sub- 
spec lea? 1. Synaptomys borealis borealis: (Richardson) 

2. Synaptomys borealis chapman! Allen 

Lemmus trinmcronatus (Brown lemming) 

This species is found in the "Rocky Mountain 
regions of northwestern Alberta 15 (Anderson, 19^6). 

The subspecies listed for Alberta by Anderson 
(19*+6) is Lemmus trimucronatus helvolus: (Richardson). 

Fhenacomys intermedins (Phenacomys vole) 

This animal has been taken in Jasper National 
Park and along eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains to 
Teton County, Montana (Anderson, 19^6). 

The subspecies listed by Anderson (19^6) for 
Alberta is Phenacomys intermedins levis; A. B. Howell. 
























- 35 - 


Phenacomys ungava 

Anderson (1946) says this species extends ’’west 
to south-central Alberta 1 ". He lists the 3ubspeciess as 
Phenacomys ungava soperi Anderson. 

Microtus longicaudus (Long-tailed meadow vole) 

This animal, which usually occurs in the moun¬ 
tains, is similar in color to Microtus Pennsylvaniaus but 
is easily distinguished by the relatively long tail. Soper 
(1946), however, trapped two specimens, one at Milk River 
and the other at Eagle Butte 0 

The subspecies listed by Anderson (1946) ares 
1« Microtus longicaudus mordax (Merriam) 

2. Microtus longicaudus vellerosus J. A. Allen 

Microtus xanthognathus (Leach) (Chestnut-cheeked vole) 

This species occurs in the northern part of the 
province (Rand, 1948) Q 

Microtus richardsoni (Water vole) 

This large vole "ranges at high altitudes in 
Alberta from Waterton Lakes National Park north at least 
to Jasper Park" (.Anderson, 1946). 

The subspecies in Alberta listed by Anderson 
(1946) is Microtus richardsoni richardsoni (De Kay). 

Pedomys minor Merriam (Upland vole) 

The range of this animal according to Rand (1948) 
is "the southeast part of the province, north to Edmonton". 
Soper (1921) took five specimens from Islay.

A1though extensive trapping was done for the 
microtine rodents mentioned above, no specimens were taken. 

Clethrionomys gapperi (Red-backed mouse) 

Color ? The back is reddish-brown fading into a 
light brown on the sides and the underparts are white 
(Plate 10). 

Measurements : Total length 131*5 mm*; tail 
length 39 mni.; hind foot length 17*5 mm. (average from 
four specimens). 

The subspecies listed by A. L. Rand (I 9 V 8 ) are: 

1.. Clethrionomys gapperi athabascae Preble 
2. Clethrionomys gapperi loringi Bailey 
3* Clethrionomys gapperi galei Merriam 
* 4*0 Clethrionomys gapperi saturatus Rhoads 
Distribution (Map 11): This species is wide¬ 
spread in southern and central Alberta but there are no 
records from the southern prairie zone. Soper (19^6) 
has records for this animal from the Cypress Hills. 

Microtus pennsylvanicus (Short-tailed meadow vole or 

meadow mouse) 

Color : The back may vary from light brown to 
black-brown. The pile and gaurd hairs are dark gray at 
the base and tipped with brown. This gives the animal 
an overall grizzled appearance (Plate 10). 


Measurements : Total length 1^9.5 nun.; tail

length 40 mm.; hind foot length 17 mm. (average from 
twelve specimens). 

The subspecies found in Alberta are, according 
to Rand (1948): 

1. Microtus pennsylvanicus drummondi Audubon 
and Backman 

2. Microtus pennsvlvanicus insperatus Allen 

Distribution (Map 12 )* This species is found 

throughout Alberta in long grass along roads or in grassy 
meadows. It is possible that it is more numerous during 
summers in which there is a great deal of rainfall. For 
instance, the increased precipitation greatly increased 
the amount of rank grass during the summer of 1951* I saw 
some road ditches teeming with these voles. 

Lemmiscus curtatus (Pallid vole) 

This animal is now thought to be fairly common 
in Alberta. I have never taken it in southern Alberta in 
over 3*000 trap nights, but Dr. J. E. Moore and Mr. R. 
Lister took twelve specimens in the summer of 1951* 

Color : The back is brownish-gray and whitish 
underneath (Plate 10). 

The race listed for Alberta by Anderson (1946) 
is Lemmiscus curtatus pallidus Merriam. 

Distribution (Map li): I have never taken this 
animal in Alberta but Dr. J. E. Moore, University of 
Alberta, tells me that it is fairly abundant in certain 
localities.

It appears to be confined to the northern and 
southern prairie region. 

Ondatra zibethica (Muskrat or mushrat) 

Color : It is brownish-black or cinnamon, depen¬ 
ding on the race in Alberta. The belly is light brown 
(Plate 8 ). 

Measurements : Total length 424 mm.; tail length 
230 mm*; hind foot length 75 mm. (from one specimen). 

Special characteristics ? It has large hind 
feet with a fringe between and surrounding the toes. The 
tail is quite diagnostic, being practically hairless and 
oval in cross section. 

The races of Alberta, according to Rand (1948) 
are: 1* Ondatra zibethica spatulata Osgood 

2 . Ondatra zibethica cinnamomina Hollister 
Distribution : This species is common in Alberta 
in most waterways and marshes which are lined with pala¬ 
table herbaceous vegetation. 

Family 6 0 Muridae (Introduced rats and mice) 

These Introduced forms are characterized by the 
presence of three longitudinal series of tubercles on the 
molars. 

Mus muscuius (House mouse) 

Color: The dorsum is dark brown and the under¬ 


part is dark gray (Plate 12)

specimens). 

Special characteristics * The long, sparsely- 
haired tail is diagnostic. 

The race present in Alberta is Mus musculus- 
domes ticus Rutty according to Rand (1948). 

Distribution : The house mouse ranges throughout 
the greater part of settled Alberta. It is the most 
common animal in areas surrounding towns or city garbage 
disposal areas* Occasionally it is trapped in barley or 
wheat fields. (Refer to Map 13). 

Rattus norvegicus* (Norway rat or brown rat) 

Color : The coarse fur is brownish-gray on top 
and gray underneath. The long, scaly tail is diagnostic 
(Plate 13). 

Measurements : Total length 243 mm.; tail length 
117 mm,; hind foot length 30.5 mm, (average from three 
specimens). 

The animal listed by Anderson (1946) is Rattus : 
norvegicus (Erxleben)• 

Distribution (Maps 13 and 14): The invasion of 
Alberta by the Norway rat constitutes a serious agricul¬ 
ture and public health problem. Until 1950, Alberta was 
the only rat-free area in North America. On July 13th, 
1950, at the Van Sickle farm at 26-1 W4M, rat burrows and

black scats were observed around the barn and chicken 
house, and the establishment of a rat colony seemed likely. 
On July 15th, 1950, the first Norway rat was caught beside 
the chicken house. Previous to finding this colony on 
the Van Sickle farm, the only rats taken in Alberta were 
either found dead or killed around railroad yards and the 
assumption was that they were brought in on railroad box¬ 
cars but had not become established. In the winter of 
1951) the grain elevator agent at Sibbald, Alberta, 
reported to Mr. J. H. Brown the presence of rats and rat 
burrows in and around his grain bins. This positive 
evidence shows that Alberta is no longer rat-free. 

The movement of rats in the three Prairie 
Provinces is an interesting problem. Between the years 
1900 and 1909) the Norway rat was found to be established 
in Morden and Emerson, Manitoba. Since the turn of the 
century, the rat has been moving westward, until now 
large colonies are established in southern Manitoba, 
southern and central Saskatchewan and a few isolated 
colonies in eastern Alberta. Thus, in a period of approxi¬ 
mately fifty years, this animal has moved westward over 
five hundred miles and established itself in colonies; 
over thousands of square miles in the Prairie Provinces. 

Perhaps the movement of rats can be explained 
in this manner. The rats first colonize the new locale. 
When a certain reproduction rate is reached and the 
carrying capacity of the area is exceeded, the rats are

forced to move in order to survive. With thousands of 
rats established in Saskatchewan, it seems likely that 
the rat could, by this method, colonize Alberta completely. 

Rattus rattus ; (Black rat) 

Color s This species is slenderer and smaller 
than the Norway rat. The hair is black on the back and 
slatey to black underneath. 

The subspecies listed by Anderson (19^6) is 
Rattus rattus rattus (Linnaeus). 

Distribution s This species was introduced 
accidentally into Alberta. Wm. Lawrence in July, 19^+7, 
trapped four specimens in a boxcar in Calgary. It is 
apparently not established in the province. 

Family 7 # Zapodidae (Jumping mice) 

These mice are approximately 250 mm. in total 
length, with long hind legs adapted for jumping. The 
forelegs are reduced and the tail is much longer than the 
head and body. The rupper incisors are grooved. 

Zapus hudsonius (Meadow jumping mouse) 

Color s The back has a dark brown stripe approxi¬ 
mately 2 cm. wide and the sides are yellowish-brown. The 
pile hair and gaurd hairs are gray at the base, the pile 
hair is yellow-brown at the tip but the gaurd hairs are 
tipped black. The white belly is separated from the 
yellowish-brown sides by an orange-yellow line (Plate 11)o

Distribution (Map 15)s I have taken three speci¬ 
mens in Alberta in the northern forest and poplar area. 

The jumping mice are rare and it is only occasionally 
that one is collected. 

Zapus princeps (Rocky Mountain jumping mous^) 

Color : The color is similar to Ithat of the 
meadow jumping mouse. This species has heavier molar teeth 
and a longer incisive foramen than Zapus hudsonius. . 

Measurements : Total length 221 mm.; tail length 
132 mm.; hind foot length 29 mm. (from one specimen). 

The two races listed by R. M.-Anderson (1946) 
are: 1. Zapus princeps Idahoensis Davis 

2. Zapus princeps minor Preble 
Pistribution (Map 15) • This species is to be 
expected in the Rocky Mountains and in northern and 
southern prairie zones, but only one specimen from Blair- 
more, Alberta, was personally collected. 

Family 8 . Erethlzontidae (American porcupines) 

This animal is furred but the upper parts of 
the back and tail are covered with enormous numbers of 
quills. The infraorbital foramen is large.

PART I. 

SECTION III. ALBERTA RODENT-BORNE DISEASES 
Sylvatic Plague 

Plague is primarily a disease of rodents. The 
causative organism of this disease is Pasteurella pestis . 
This bacillus is usually transmitted from species to 
species by fleas. Alberta plague in Citellus richardsonii . 
which is the animal reservoir, often appears as a pathogenic 
epizootic. 

There are two main methods whereby the disease 
can be transmitted to man. While the flea is feeding on 
a human host, it may regurgitate blood or deposit feces 
on the skin, and the infected blood or feces may be rubbed 
into a lesion in the skin. The second method, by which 
plague is transmitted to man, is by direct inhalation of 
infected droplets into the lungs. This causes pneumonic 
plague. 

Plague has been found in the Richardson ground 
squirrel in the following areas in Alberta (refer t) Map l4)t 

1. The Youngs torn area 

2. The Brooks area 

3. The Gleichen area 

4. The Suffield area 

5 . 


The Lomond area

The invasion of the Norway rat ( Rattus n orvegicus ) 
into Alberta c onstitutes a.serious public health problem. 

The Norway rat can carry Pasteurella pestis and as the 
rats move westward into the Youngstown ground squirrel 
plague area, it seems likely that the bacillus and infected 
fleas could be passed to the rat. As the rat lives in 
close association with man, the threat of plague in humans 
will be increased. 

The following list shows the rodent hosts from 
which plague vectors have been recovered. (Brown, I 9 M+). 

1. Citellus columbianus 

Vectors: Oropsylla (Or opsyll a) i dahoensis 

Oropsylla ( Opisacrostis ) tuberculata

Tularaemia 

“Rabbit fever or tularaemia is a disease of man, 

transmitted to man by the bite of an infected blood-sucking 

v 

fly or tick, (in Alberta by Chrisops discalis and Derma- 
cento r andersoni) or by the contamination of the hands or 
conjunctival sac with the internal body fluids of infected 
rodents, flies or ticks. tJ (Zinsser Bayne-Jones, 1939). 

Tularaemia, which is caused by Pasteurella 
tularensis , has been found in the following animals: 
ground squirrels, woodchucks, pocket gophers, porcupines 
and chipmunks. 

From 19^0 to 19*+2, Bow and Brown (19*+3) have 
reported nine human cases of tularaemia from the Seven 
Persons Coulee in southeastern Alberta. The vector was; 
thought to be Dermacentor andersoni and the reservoir 
could be Citellus richardsonii or Lepus townsendii . 

Equine Encephalomyeliti s 

This virus disease is thought to be transmitted 
by mosquitoes and the virus is thought to be present in 
very small amounts in the brains of diseased Citellus 
richardsonii in Alberta. (Gwatkin and Moynihan, 19^2).

Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever 

This rickettsial disease is caused by the bite 
of an infected tick ( Derm ac entor andersoni ). This is 
primarily a tick disease but certain rodents may act as 
hosts and disease reservoirs in the tick*s complicated 
life cycle. Brown (19^+6) lists the following rodents as 
hosts: Tick adult stage: Porcupines 

Tick nymph stage: Squirrels, ground squirrels, 
mice, chipmunks, wood rats, marmots 

Tick larval stage: Squirrels, ground squirrels, 
mice, chipmunks, wood rats, marmots 

Haplosporangium parvum 

A fungus disease caused by Haplosp a rangium 
parvum has been isolated in Alberta rodents by Dr. S. 
Keeping. This disease of the lungs has been isolated 
from the lungs of Peromyscus sp. in southeastern Alberta. 
Over 100 smears and lung collections were made by the 
author in 1950 and 1951. One positive was obtained from 
Foremost in a Peromyscus sp. in 1950. The number of 
diseased lungs in 1951 has not been determined. This 
disease is thought to be feebly pathogenic.

PART II. ORDER LAGOMORPHA 
SECTION I. DESCRIPTIONS AND DISTRIBUTIONAL NOTES 

Family Ochotonidae (Pikas) 

The roundish ears, the small size, the rela¬ 
tively short hind legs and the absence of a tail distin¬ 
guish this family from the following family. 

Qchotona princeps (Coney or pika) 

Color : The upperparts are "grayish or buffy, 
the hairs slate colored at base, color variable with the 
individual and ranging from the pinkish buff, clay color 
or ochraceous tawny to fuscous or grayish mixture," 
(Anthony, 1928). The underparts are "whitish varying 
to cinnamon-buff; soles of feet buffy white, brownish 
or fuscous." (Anthony, 1928). The subspecies according 
to Rand (19^) are: 

1 . Qchotona princeus princeps Richardson 

2 . Qchotona p rinceps luteseens Howell 
3* Qchotona princeps levis Hollister

Distribution : (Refer to Map 16). This animal 

is limited to the higher reaches in the Rocky Mountains. 

Family Leporidae (Hares and rabbits) 

The long tapering ears, the presence of a 
stubby tail and long hind legs are characteristic. 

Lepus americanus (Snowshoe rabbit or varying hare) 

Color ; The summer pelage is a grizzled brown 
above and whitish underneath. The dark upperside of the 
tail is a salient characteristic. In the winter season, 
the animal is white with black-tipped ears. 

Measurements : Total length 460 mm.; tail length 
43 mm.; hind foot length 143 mm.; (average of 3 specimens). 

Anderson (1946) lists the following subspecies 
in Alberta; 

1. Lepus americanus americanus Erxliben 

2. Lepus americanus bairdii Hayden 

3. Lepus americanus columbiensis Rhoads 

4. Lepus americanus macfarlani Merriam 
Distribution ; (Refer to Map 16). The distribution 

of this species varies in Alberta. As the species reaches 
its numerical peak, in its ten year population cycle, the 
range will increase also. 

The snowshoe rabbit has been seen and recorded 
in Central Alberta but never has been seen by the author 
in the northern and southern prairie zones. This hare

has been reported by farmers in the valleys of the Milk, 
South Saskatchewan and Red Deer Rivers in southeastern 
Alberta. 

Lepus townsendii (White-tailed jack rabbit) 

Color : In summer, this animal is sandy above 
but pile hair is whitish throughout. The underparts, the 
tail, the nape and the underside of the ears are whitish. 
The tips of the ears are black throughout the whole year. 

Measurements : Total length 552 mm.; tail length 
88 mm.; hind foot length 130 mm. (average of 5 specimens). 

The subspecies listed by Rand (19^8) for Alberta 
is Lepus townsendii campanius Hollister. 

Distribution ; (Refer to Map 16). The jack 
rabbit is primarily an animal of the plains but has been 
recorded north at least to Fawcett and west to Coleman. 

As land settlement increases, I believe this animal will 
move even further north. At the present time, it is 
fairly common in the southernaad northern prairie regions, 
the parkland and in the poplar region. It seems to be 
abundant in the Eastern Irrigation District. 

Sylvilagus nuttallii (Cottontail rabbit) 

Color : The dorsum is light brown, the neck and 
the upper parts of the legs are a rich brown. The throat 
is brown but the underparts are white.

The subspecies listed by Anderson (1946) is 
Sylvilagus nuttallii grangeri . 

Distribution ; (Refer to Map 16). This animal 
is found in the southern prairie region. It can be found 
along the banks of creeks and rivers in southeastern 
Alberta where there are willow and rose bush thickets.

PART II. 

SECTION III. ALBERTA LAGOMORPH-BORNE DISEASES. 

Tularaemia is the chief disease of rabbits 
that can be transmitted to man but the fact that the 
nymph and larval stages of the spotted fever tick 
( Dermacentor andersoni ) have been found attached to 
the skin of snowshoe and jack rabbits shows that 
these 2 species may be important in the spread of 
Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever as well as Tularaemia. 

Tularaemia 

The snowshoe, the jack and the cottontail 
rabbit are known carriers of Pasteurella pestis. 

The disease can be transmitted by the bite of an 
infected deer fly ( Chrysops discalis ) or tick 
( Dermacentor andersoni ) or by handling diseased 


animals (Brown 19^3)

CONCLUSION 


In this preliminary survey, I have attempted 
to give a general picture of the species of rodents and 
lagomorphs in Alberta, their distribution, their ecto¬ 
parasites, and finally, the effect of these mammals on 
the health and welfare of man. It has been difficult 
to do enough field work in Alberta to give a fair picture 
of the animal communities studied. The vast number of 
species, the huge territory to cover, the complexity 
of rodent and lagomorph communities and the actual labour 
involved in catching, autopsying and skinning the animals 
collected poses a serious problem to the surveyor. 

This paper, I believe, will be a fairly useful 
field guide to future field men who will be doing further 
survey work on sylvatic plague, tularaemia and Rocky 
Mountain spotted fever in Alberta. It is of prime 
importance for the surveyor to know the names of the 
common species in the area he is working in, the environ¬ 
ment where these animals are to be expected, and finally, 
the ectoparasites which are scraped from the mammals. 

"Animal ecology is building up from basic 
surveys a science whose aim is the complete analysis

of animal behaviour, numbers and distribution. It has 
only recently progressed far enough to make close contact 
with the economic problems. It still has a long way 
to go. H (Elton, 19*+6).
