ABSTRACT 


The anomalous flow properties of a dense particle aqueous 
suspension have been investigated. 

Pressure drop - flow rate data have been obtained for barytes- 
water suspensions (over a range of solids concentrations from 21.3$ 
to 71.6$) flowing through two 20.0 ft. lengths of smooth copper 
tubing O.786 and 1.277 inches in diameter respectively. High flow 
rates, mainly in 'the turbulent flow zone, were employed to minimise 
settling of the suspension. The experimental results are presented 
as a series of plots of friction factor vs. modified Reynolds 
number. 

The rheological properties of the suspension were independently 
determined by a calibrated Fann concentric cylinder viscometer; the 
properties were found to be complex but closely approximated Bingham 
plastic behaviour over a wide range of shear rates. The experimental 
resiilts are presented in the form of the conventional flow diagram of 
shear stress vs. shear rate. 

For suspensions of solids content less than 50 $ the average 
equivalent coefficients of rigidity, determined by two different 
methods of extrapolation of the rheological data, were found to agree 
closely with those coefficients of rigidity effective in the pipeline. 
Agreement of effective yield values, obtained via a theoretical 
correlation, with the equivalent yield values was poor. 

Complicating rheological factors present in suspensions of solids 
content greater than 50$ are thought to account for the abnormally

high equivalent coefficients of rigidity compared with the values of : 
this characterizing constant effective in the pipeline. 

All data were correlated in terms of three dimensionless groups., 
the friction factor, the equivalent Bingham Reynolds number and the 
equivalent Bingham Yield number. At high flow rates the friction 
factor was found to be independent of the equivalent Bingham Yield 
number and could be estimated by employing the conventional friction 
factor - Reynolds number plot. At lower flowrates the friction 
factor was correlated with the equivalent Bingham Reynolds number 
using an equivalent Bingham Yield number as a parameter.

CHAPTER 1 

INTRODUCTION 

The pipeline flow of solid-liquid suspensions is an important 
aspect of chemical engineering fluid flow. 

Many industries transport materials in the form of water 
suspensions e.g. the transportation of paper pulp., coating clays, 
sewage sludge and drilling muds. 

Recently, in the field of nuclear engineering, the advantages 
of a circulating fuel system in a homogeneous thermal reactor 
having been recognised, use has been made of water suspensions of 
an insoluble form of fissile material*as a fuel* 

The petroleum industry has found that the production of 
synthetic liquid fuels, via the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, can be 
carried out efficiently by suspending a finely pulverised catalyst 
in a coolant oil. Many advantages are claimed for this slurry 
phase synthesis. 

A large fraction of such suspensions exhibit anomalous flow 
properties. One of the most important problems encountered in 
the transport of suspensions is the prediction of pressure drop 
due to friction. The usual methods of calculation available do 
not apply to these anomalous fluids. In the past few years several 
methods have been proposed for the estimation of this pressure drop 
for specific types of fluids. Nevertheless no entirely satisfactory 
proven method (which is completely general, rigorous and yet simple) 











Vo . ' o j.

is available for predicting the pressure losses accompanying the 
flow of any anomalous fluid. 

The object of this investigation was not to seek out a new 
general correlation, but rather to provide additional experimental 
data which could be used to confirm (and possibly extend the 
application of) correlations already proposed. With this object 
in view,, bearing in mind a previous investigation in the 
Department of a series of clay-water suspensions (29), it was 
decided to investigate the flow properties of a suspension containing 
denser particles. 

In this thesis the results of the investigation of the 
rheological properties and pressure drop-flow rate relationships, 
for a series of barytes-water suspensions, are presented and 


discussed.

CHAPTER 2 


LITERATURE SURVEY AMD THEORY 


I Fluid Classifications : 

The classification of fluids into the two categories of 
Newtonian and non-Newtonian is according to their behaviour at 
constant temperature under imposed shearing forces which result 
in laminar motion. 

The classical model of a fluid under shear between two planes 
was first employed by Maxwell to illustrate the concept of viscosi¬ 
ty. Suppose a fluid is confined between two planes, one fixed and 
the other movable, of area A, and separated by a differential dis¬ 
tance dr. A constant force F is then applied to the movable plane 
giving it a differential velocity dV in the direction of the force. 

A uniform velocity gradient of magnitude dV is set up in the fluid 

dr 

since the shearing force F is uniform across the distance dr. 

The velocity gradient, dV , is known as the ’shear rate* or 

dr 

’rate of shear’; similarly the unit shearing force, F_ , is called 

A 

the ’unit shear stress’ and is designated by the symbol T. 

(a) Newtonian Fluids: 

Many, but not all, fluids follow the Newtonian definition of 
viscosity. 


jj. dV 
dr 


( 1 ) 


Thus a Newtonian fluid is one which, under laminar flow conditions, 
exhibits a direct proportionality between shear stress and shear 
rate; it is therefore characterised by a single, physical property, 










:\ 
V J 













viscosity; designated in the above equation by the symbol [±. This 
relationship can be shown graphically in two ways; either arithmet¬ 
ically or logarithmically; as illustrated in Figure 1 and 2. On 
arithmetic co-ordinates the Newtonian fluid is represented by a 
single straight line through the origin; the slope of the line be¬ 
ing the viscosity of the fluid. Alternatively; on logarithmic co¬ 
ordinates; the Newtonian fluid is represented by a line of unity 
slope and the intercept on the ordinate at unity shear rate gives 
the viscosity of the fluid. 

Examples of Newtonian fluids include all gases; water; and many 
solutions of low molecular weight compounds. 

(b) Non-Newtonian Fluids: 

Non-Newtonian fluids do not obey equation (l) and so do not 
possess the property of viscosity. The term viscosity has been 
used widely; and often incorrectly; as a measure of consistency. 
Since the viscosity of a Newtonian fluid is equal to the ratio 
between the unit shearing stress and the rate of shear; the term 
viscosity has been applied to this same ratio in the case of non- 
Newtonians. It is evident from the flow curve; illustrated in 
Figure 1, that the ratio between the unit shearing stress and the 
rate of shear for the non-Newtonian fluid varies depending ^lpon the 
rate of shear. Depending upon the rate of shear, the slopes of the 
curves are different - denoting different consistencies. To refer 
to these different consistencies as viscosities is incorrect; how¬ 
ever, they can be referred to as ’'apparent viscosities” (10) 

Non-Newtonian fluids may be subdivided into five general types:

i) Bingham plastic 

ii) Pseudoplastic 

iii) Dilatant 

iv) Thixotropic 

v) Rheopectic 

The first three general types of non-Newtonian fluids listed are 
fluids with properties which are independent of duration of shear, 
i) Bingham Plastic 

The flow diagram, illustrated in Figures 1 and 2, indicates 

that there is a linear relationship between shear force and shear 

rate for a Bingham plastic, the only difference from the Newtonian 

fluid being that the linear relationship does not pass through the 

origin. A finite shearing stress, T , known as the yield stress, 

y 

is necessary to initiate shear; the equation of the flow curve is 
therefore: 

T -T = I? dV_ .(2) 

J ' dr 

where Tj is the "coefficient of rigidity" and is represented by the 
slope of the flow curve. On logarithmic co-ordinates the flow 
curve becomes asympotic to T at low shear rates and approaches a 

y 

slope of unity at very high shear rates. 

Examples of true Bingham plastics are rare; fluids approxi¬ 
mating Bingham behaviour include sewage sludge, various clay-water 
suspensions and suspensions of chalk in water. Bingham plastic 
behaviour has been explained by assuming that the fluid has a three 








.u 



:u :. 3 r .< 








( 


dimensional structure while at reat. A stress equal to or greater 
than the ijield stress, Ty, is necessary to initiate flow in the 
fluid; once this stress has been exceeded the structure breaks down 
completely and the fluid flows. 

ii) Pseudoplastics 

A pseudoplastic fluid is represented as a curve passing through 
the origin and concave downwards on the arithmetic co-ordinates of 
a flow curve. Logarithmically represented, the pseudoplastic ex¬ 
hibits a flow curve with a slope varying between zero and unity and 
is generally straight over wide ranges of shear rate. 

Examples of pseudoplastic fluids include the barytes-water sus¬ 
pensions under investigation and polymeric solutions (e.g. GR -S 
latices). The following mechanisms have been proposed to account 
for the decrease in apparent viscosity with increase in rate of 
shear, assuming that the fluid consists of finite particles suspend¬ 
ed in a liquid 

(a) Elongation of spherical particles under shear 

(b) Deformation and/or disintegration of aggregates. 

(c) Alignment of rod like particles. 

(d) Shearing off of layers of solvation. 

iii) Dilatant fluids 

Dilatant fluids exhibit a rheological behaviour which is 
opposite to that of pseudoplastics in that the apparent viscosi¬ 
ty increases with increasing rate of shear.

Sand-water suspensions, containing a high percentage of sand 
may be cited as an example of a dilatant fluid. Other highly con¬ 
centrated suspensions of finely divided solids, for example starch- 
water suspensions, exhibit dilatancy. Dilatant behaviour has been 
explained by assuming that these fluids, when at rest, consist of 
densely packed particles, in which the voids are a minimum. These 
voids are filled with liquid. The shearing of such fluids at low 
rates of shear requires only small shearing stresses since the li¬ 
quid present acts as a lubricant. However, at increasing rates of 
shear, the dense packing is broken up and insufficient liquid is 
available as a lubricant. Hence the disproportionate increase of 
shear force with respect to shear rate. 

The two time-dependent non-Newtoniaiis will be dealt with' brief¬ 
ly. These are materials for which the shear stress, at a given 
rate of shear, is not a constant, but changes with time. ' 

A rheopectic fluid is one in which the shear stress increases with 
the time of shear at a constant shearing rate. Conversely, the 
shear forces acting on a thixotropic fluid (being sheared at a 
constant rate over a neriod oftime) decrease. 

A. 

It is possible that the causes for thixotropic and rheopectic 
behaviour are similar to those for pseudoplasticity and dilatancy, 
respectively. The mechanisms proposed for pseudoplasticity are 
not necessarily instantaneous with respect to time. It is possible 
that pseudoplastic behaviour is a form of thixotropy which has too 
small a time element to be measurable under ordinary conditions.

Some examples of thixotropic fluids and suspensions are mayon¬ 
naise, drilling muds, paints and inks. Thixotropy was observed to 
be present on examination of the rheological properties of the 
highest percentage solids (78$) barytes-water suspension used in 
this investigation (s£e Appendix E, Figure E^). 

Mechanics of flow in round pipes 

The basic relations for the flow of fluids are the material 
balance, the force balance, and the energy balance (l 4 ) 

Applying the force balance to steady uni-dimensional flow of 
any fluid in a pipe we get:

A dimensionless friction factor is defined by the relationship:

This friction factor may be shown to be a function of the 

dimensionless Reynolds number., DV p , and the relative roughness

Laminar Flow 

Consider the steady flow of a Newtonian fluid in a horizontal 
pipe of uniform diameter. We have seen that a Newtonian fluid is 
defined by the following equation.

to be dependent upon two dimensionless groups; the Reynolds number 

DW and the relative roughness of the pipe wal l 5 .

Von Karman derived an equation of the following form

from Universal Velocity profile theory. Nikuradse verified 
theeeauation experimentally, determining the constants A and B, 
giving

( 10 ) 


which fits the experimental data for friction in smooth pipes.

The relationship between friction factor and Reynolds number 
in the laminar and turbulent zones is represented graphically in 
Figure i£ together with experimental results obtained during the 
water calibration of the pipeline which was used in this investi¬ 
gation. 

The flow of non-Newtonian fluids in pipes: 

Winning ( 29 ); in 19^8, reviewed the literature relating to the 
flow of non-Newtonian slurries in circular pipes. The literature 
reviewed by Winning is summarised in tabular form (see Table l). 
Literature published ..since 19^8 is reviewed in more detail in this 
chapter. Recently,, an excellent survey of the whole field of non- 
Newtonian technology has been undertaken by Metzner (l8), thus pro¬ 
viding a review of all the literature pertaining to the flow of non- 
Newtonian fluids in pipes. 

I Bingham plastics: 

It has been shown that for Newtonian fluids the friction factor, 
f, is a function of the Reynolds number and the relative roughness. 

i-e. SPf. e(D,I»,6,p,n,g c ) .(11) 

In the laminar flow zone or for a smooth pipe the effect of 
roughness disappears. 

Govier and Winning (9) applied the technique of dimensional 
analysis to the flow of Bingham plastics in a horizontal circular 
pipeline in order to develop a relationship, between pressure drop 
(due to friction losses) and flow rate, which was valid for both the 
laminar and turbulent flow regions. They assumed that the following 
factors influenced the flow of a Bingham plastic through a circular

is in effect the product of the Yield number and the Reynolds 
number: 

thus He - Re x Y -V7£*) 

It has been shown that it is possible to calculate the relation¬ 
ship between the friction factor, the Reynolds number and the Yield 
number in the laminar flow region. The work of Govier and Winning 
confirmed this theoretical prediction experimentally. 

In the turbulent flow zone the importance of the Yield number 
parameter is diminished and it is found that the experimental data 
fall close to the conventional Newtonian curve -- the Karman - Nik- 
uradse line, with DVg replacing DV^ as the Reynolds number. 

n m- 

On the basis'of data reported in the literature, Hedstrom 
found that for turbulent flow, the usual Fanning friction factor 
curve for Newtonian was, at least approximately, applicable to Bing¬ 
ham plastics, if the Reynolds number was defined as DVft , where n 

0 1 

is the coefficient of rigidity. 

Winning summarised his findings as follows: 

4 

"At high flow rates, DV^ >2 x 10 , the friction factor is 
independent of the Yield number. Further at high flow rates the 
data indicated that the friction factor may be predicted by means 
of the conventional Reynolds number diagram, using the modified 
Reynolds number, DVfi 0

At low flow rates, DV0„ 2 x 10^’, the friction factor

number as a parameter. This correlation was found to be satisfactory

for the estimation of friction factors except at extremely low 
rates of flow of the less dense suspensions." 

It can he seen that there is a substantial measure of agree¬ 
ment between the work of Hedstrom and that of Govier and Winning. 

II Pseudoplastics and other non-Newtonian fluids: 

Alves, Boucher and Pigford (l) have presented methods where¬ 
by the flow diagram, obtained by the use of either a rotational 
viscometer or pipeline viscometer, can be converted to a form 
directly useful in the design of pilot scale pipelines. 

For the case of laminar flow of Newtonian- fluids through 
pipelines, the pressure drop due to friction is given by Poiseuille’s 
equation. In the case of non-Newtonian fluids, the same equation 
may be used by replacing the viscosity term by an apparent viscosity. 
The problem of determining the proper value of the apparent viscos¬ 
ity to be used is frequently a difficult one since it is not a con¬ 
stant . 

Alves et al suggested that a comparison of pipeline and 
rotational viscometer data can be made on the basis of comparing 
the rate of shear and shear stress at the pipe wall with the ra/te 
of shear and. shear stress at the inner cylinder wall of the rotation¬ 
al viscometer. A flow diagram can be obtained from viscometric 
data by plotting torque against angular velocity. In the case of 
the pipeline, however, Sq is plotted against D AP . The term

shear at the pipe wall is more difficult to evaluate. Rabinowitsch(22) 
has derived an expression for the shear rate at the wall of the pipe 
which is independent of the flow diagram. 

The expression is: 

-H- = + da: 

\ dr Jw p53~j TI 

Hence the shear rate at the wall of the pipe £an be obtained from 

the above equation and a plot of 8q vs> D AP 

*D 3 == 5l 

Design procedure is more complex if the only data available 
are in the form of a flow diagram obtained by means of a rotational, 
viscometer. Two methods are available. 

i) Fit an equation to the viscometer flow diagram. This 
equation is then substituted into equation (l8) which 
can be integrated to give the equation for the pipe flow 
diagram, which can in turn be used for design purposes, 
ii) Using the technique of graphical integration the method 
outlined in ^i) can be followed. 

Several analytical relationships representing the flow curves 
have been used:- 

1. An empirical power function 



2. The Powell-Eyring equation may be used to accurately re¬ 
present shear stress - shear rate data. Christiansen, 
Ryan and Stevens ( 5 ) have used this technique. 



















:j- d 





















19 


The above correlations, suggested by Alves et al and Christian¬ 
sen et al, are severely limited in that they apply only to the laminar 
flow region. 

However, Alves et al make a recommendation for a design pro¬ 
cedure for the turbulent flow zone which is based upon experimentally 
determined turbulent viscosities -- "The turbulent viscosity is com¬ 
puted as follows from'the turbulent flow portion of the pipeline 
shear diagram. A value of is selected and the linear velo¬ 
city V calculated from the corresponding value of u( ^ . The 

ni)3 

friction factor is then obtained from the Fanning equation, the 
corresponding Reynolds number from the conventional pipeline friction 
factor chart and the turbulent viscosity calculated from this Reynolds 
number". 

More recently Metzner and Reed ( 19 ) have attempted to develop 
a universal correlation for application to Newtonian and non- 
Newtonian fluids; their purpose was to provide design procedure 
which, although completely general and rigorous, was in a form which 
was relatively simple to apply. 

Metzner and Reed based their correlation upon the equation de¬ 
rived by Rabinowitsch(and later modified by Mooney (20) ) for cal¬ 
culation of the shear rate at the wall of a pipe--equation (l8); a 
modified version of equation (l8) was employed, the substitution

Examination of this equation indicates that the pressure drop 
is not very sensitive to either velocity or pipe diameter for 
highly non-Newtonian fluids with a flow behaviour index which 
approaches zero. 

Variation of n* and jjwith imposed shearing stress is 

possible; in this event they must be evaluated at the proper 

value of the shear stress at the wall of the pipeline. Outside 

the laminar flow region the relationship between 8v and D AP

is no longer independent of the pipe diameter; however., the 
variation of n* with D AP is found to be small.

For the estimation of pressure drop for flow in the trans¬ 
ition and turbulent regions Metzner and Reed recommend that a 

friction factor he calculated by trial and error. Assuming ’

values of K and n*, the generalized Reynolds number is cal¬ 
culated and the corresponding friction factor determined. From 
the friction factor, the pressure drop AP, and hence I) AP.

may be calculated. K and n* are then re-evaluated at this value 
of D AP . a difference in values of these indices compared with 

53T ' 

those assumed originally to calculate a Reynolds number, indicates 
that the Reynolds number and friction factor must be recalculated. 

Other design procedures for the turbulent zone have been 
recommended:- 

1. The use of an apparent viscosity at infinite shear to 

calculate a modified Reynolds number and hence a friction 
factor from the conventional friction factor vs. Reynolds 
number plot. (Winding, Baumann and Kranich (28)). 

2 The use of an experimentally determined turbulent vis¬ 
cosity (previously described). (Alves, Boucher and 
Pigford. op. cit.) 

Another design method has been proposed by Weltrnarm ( 25 ). 

Her method of correlation is fundamentally identical with that 
proposed by Metzner and Reed (op. cit.). Both methods are 
based on the same flow equation and yield identical results in 
the laminar flow region. However, the methods of presentation 


are quite different.

Oudgeon and Michie ( 7 ) having investigated the pressure drop 
flow rate relationships for the flow of uranium trioxide aqueous 
suspensions in two pipelines and having obtained the shear stress- 
shear rate data by viscometric determinations, utilized the correl¬ 
ations of Metzner and Reed and that of Weltmann to correlate their 
data. They found Weltmann's method somewhat easier to use. 

Weltmann defined two parameters to describe the shear stress- 
shear rate relationships:-

The pipeline pressure losses are then calculated from equation 
(15) or from the friction factor Reynolds number plot using apparent 
viscosity as defined by equation ( 28 ). 

Weltmann correlated the experimental data of a number of investi¬ 
gators using the techniques outlined above. Metzner and Reed illust¬ 
rated the use of their technique in a similar manner. Both groups of 
investigators found that agreement was good in the laminar zone, but 
that lack of experimental results prohibited a firm prediction of the 
proper relationship in the transition and turbulent regions. 

II Viscometry and the Determination of Rheological Properties:- 

The correlations dealing with the flow of fluids in pipelines, 
outlined in Section II, all require that the rheological properties 
of the fluid under examination be known. In general this means that 
the flow curve (i.e. the shear stress-shear rate relationship) must 
be determined. 

Two basic methods are available for the determination of the 
flow curve. 

i) Capillary tube or Pipeline viscometry. 
ii) Concentric cylinder viscometry 
These methods are outlined below. A concentric cylinder vis¬ 
cometer was used to determine the rheological properties of the 
barytes-water suspension under investigation. 

i) Capillary tube or pipeline viscometer 

The apparatus known as the pipeline viscometer consists 
of a known length of pipe with either a blow-case or pump

to force the fluid through the pipe. The pressure drop is 

measured for various rates of flow The shear stress at the 

■wall of the pipe D AP and the term 8v can he calculated 
kL D 

from these data. A logarithmic plot of these two terms en¬ 
ables the slope of the plot to be determined. Application 
of the Rabinowitsch-Mooney equation 



enables the calculation for the wall shear rate to be made 
at several values of the wall shear stress; the results can 
be illustrated graphically on a shear stress-shear rate dia¬ 
gram. 

ii) Rotational Viscometer 

The two measured variables in this case are the torque 
and rotor speed. 

The deflection of the bob, 9, (which is proportional 

to the torque exerted by the fluid on the bob) is directly 

proportional to the shear stress at the surface of the bob, 

T , thus 
i 

t. = k x e .(37) 

The constant is determined by calibration of the instru¬ 
ment with a Newtonian fluid of known viscosity at a given 
temperature. 

Conversion of the rotor speed, N, to the shear rate at 
the surface of the bob is dependent upon the nature of the 


fluid.

The only assumptions made in deriving this equation are:

obtained is incapable of complete interpretation. 

According to Couette (6) if a fluid occupies the space 
between two cylinders, the outer rotating the inner at rest, 
and if the distance d = R^ - R-^ then there is a critical peri¬ 
pheral velocity, v, such that the Reynolds number

for the onset of turbulent flow of a Newtonian fluid in the 
annular shearing space is given by

It should be noted that equations (4l) and (42) are identical 
in form, the only difference being the numerical value of the 
constant used as the criterion for turbulence» Thus there a- 
ppears to be some measure of disagreement regarding the cri¬ 
terion for the onset of turbulence.

CHAPTER 3 

EXPERIMENTAL EQUIPMENT 


In the investigation of the pipeline flow characteristics of 
barytes-water suspensions the following variables were measured:- 

1. Density 

2. Rheological properties 

3* Pressure drop 

k . Flow rate 

Accordingly the experimental equipment may be considered under two 
general headings: 

(A) Determination of the properties of the dry solid and 
the suspension. 

(B) The pipeline unit. 

A Apparatus Used to Determine the Properties of th e Suspension . 

I Density determination: 

A specially constructed lucite cylinder of approximately 
five litres capacity was used to measure the volume of the 
given sample of suspension. The weight of the sample was 
determined by weighing the lucite cylinder plus suspension on 
a Toledo balance (to the nearest gram). 

II Rheological properties: 

A concentric cylinder rotational viscometer was used to 
determine the rheological properties of the barytes-water

suspensions. The particular model used, illustrated in 
Figures 8 and was the Fann V-G Meter (Model 35) manufactured 
by the Fann Instrument Corporation, Houston, Texas. 

Fluid is contained in the annular space between two 
coaxial cylinders. The annular space is filled to a 
predetermined height with the fluid to be tested. The outer 
cylinder, or rotor, suspended in a precision bearing, is 
driven at a constant rotational speed and the torque arising 
from the fluid's viscous drag is exerted on the inner cylinder, 
or bob. The torque is rapidly balanced by a helically wound 
spring and the deflection is read on a calibrated dial through 
an optical reticule. 

In this viscometric method the flow data are analysed in 
terms of the fundamental relationship between shear rate, 
proportional to rotor speed, and shearing stress, proportional 
to the dial reading. The cylindrical rotor and bob design 
permits calculation of the shear rate corresponding to each 
rotational speed. The shear stress is only obtainable by 
calibration of the instrument with a Newtonian fluid of known 
viscosity. Full details of the calibration of the viscometer 
are presented in Appendix A, together with the theory of the 
concentric cylinder rotational viscometer. 

The Fann viscometer is a commercial instrument. Neverthe¬ 
less it is suitable for research or high quality process control 
work. It is simple to operate, accurate, and rotor speed 
changes for 3j 8, 100, 200, 300., and 600 R.P.M. are effected

smoothly and rapidly without ever stopping rotation. This 
is achieved by the used of a three position gear shift in 
conjunction with a two position switch controlling the motor 
speed. The rotor is driven by a 115v.—50 cycle dual speed 
synchronous motor. Thus sustained testing is possible at 
each of several rates of shear. In the standard model the 
sample being tested is placed in a stainless steel cup, the 
base of which is equipped with pins to locate and lock to the 
movable platform. The rotor and bob may be detached from the 
main body of the instrument for the purposes of cleaning. 

Two modifications were made to the standard model in order 
that closer control could be kept over the determination of 
the rheological properties and to allow further data to be 
obtained. These modifications were: 

(a) Control of the temperature of the fluid being tested. 
The Stainless steel cup was replaced by a copper cup 
with a cooling jacket surrounding it. Water , at a 
controlled temperature of 70 ~ 0.5°F, from a Thomas 
constant temperature bath was circulated through the 
cup jacket., through a subsiduary vessel where the 
original sample of suspension (in a conical flask) 
was allowed to attain the equilibrium temperature, 
and returned to the constant temperature bath. 




35 


(b) Additional shear rates were made available by inter¬ 
posing a 9*1 reduction gear in between the synchronous 
motor and the main body of the instrument; the 
instrument was then capable of producing twelve 
different shear rates ranging from approximately 1000 
reciprocal seconds to l/2 reciprocal second. 

Ill Subsiduary equipment 

(a) The Roller Particle sizer, model 5-450, manufactured 
by the American Instrument Company, Silver Spring, Maryland, 
was used to carry out a particle size analysis. 

(b) Photomicrographs, to determine particle shape, were 
obtained using a Reichert Metallograph. 

(c) Equipment used for the semi-quantitative test to 
determine the settling rates of barytes-water suspensions 
consisted of a 2 litre graduate, stirring rod, thermometer 
(30--110°F) and a stopwatch reading to l/5 sec. 

B The Pipeline Unit 

The pilot pipeline used was designed and built by Winning;this 
has been described in detail previously (op. cit.) and therefore 
only a brief description follows. Several minor modifications were 
made to this flow circuit and these are noted in more detail. 

A diagram of the flow circuit is shown in Figure 4. The flow 
circuit consists of a supply tank, a pump and motor, the two test 


pipelines and a weigh tank on scales.

Supply tank s The suspension is stored in the supply tank which 


is connected directly to the pump. 

II Pump and Motor . The pump used was a Moyno positive displacement 
unit operating at 770 R.P.M. to give 35 g.p.m. against a maximum 
pressure of 75 p.s.i. The drive unit was a 5 H.P., three phase 
220 v. motor. 

The two basic pumping elements of the Moyno pump consist 
of a helical rotor turning within a double thread rubber lined 
helical stator. The meshing helical surfaces push the liquid 
ahead with uniform movement. Dry friction is harmful to the 
pump and consequently the pump should not be run under power 
until it is filled with the liquid to be pumped. 

III Pipeline test sections . The pipeline test sections are connected 
to the delivery of the pump in series. 

The test sections consist of two 40 feet lenghts of smooth 
hand-drawn copper tubing O.786 inches and 1.277 inches actual 
inside diameter (3/4 in. and 1 1/4 in. nominal diameter). 

The two test lines run parallel to one another and are 
connected, in series by a return bend. A side outlet was welded 
to the return bend and the stem of a Marshall dial-type bimetallic 
thermometer inserted in the pipeline to enable the temperature 
of the flowing fluid to be measured. 

Two pressure tappings on each pipeline } spaced exactly 
20 ft. 0 ins. apart , enable pressure drop readings to be taken 
over a known length of pipeline. Sight glasses are attached to 












each of the pressure tappings; Figure 7 shows detail of one 
of the sight glasses which are constructed of lucite. Figure 5 
illustrates, schematically, the pressure connections to the 
manometers. 

The manometer panel . The manometer panel, illustrated 
schematically in Figure 6, consists of two vertical 5 ft. 
double cleanout Meriam manometers. Traps were inserted in the 
transmission lines leading to each limb of each manometer. 

One manometer fluid used is mercury, the other carbon 
tetrachloride. Transmission of pressure from the pipeline to 
the manometer is hydraulic. Therefore the effective specific 
gravities of the manometer fluids are 12.6 and 0.595> 
respectively. Pressure drops ranging from approximately 0.1 ft. 
water to 25 ft. water could be measured with accuracy. For the 
purposes of the water calibration tests in the pipeline, a 
third manometer was used -- this was a 3 ft. inclined Meriam 
manometer with carbon tetrachloride as the manometer fluid. 

The carbon tetrachloride used in the manometers was coloured 
with a water-insoluble purple dye to enable visual readings to 
be obtained more easily. 

Slight modifications were made to the manometer panel as 
used by Winning; he used a vertical upright mercury manometer 
and in addition an inverted vertical manometer which used a 
carbon tetrachloride-turpentine mixture as a manometer fluid. 

By varying the proportion of each constituent in the mixture,

manometer fluids of various specific gravities could be 
obtained; thus enabling a wide range of pressure drops to be 
measured. 

This system had the following disadvantages: 

(a) The manometer fluid tended to stick to the walls of the 
manometer tubes, even after precautions had been taken to 
clean the tubes thoroughly. 

(b) The manometer fluid tended to disperse into small globules 
at the water-oil interface in the manometer tube. This 
tendency was aggravated by fluctuations of pressure in the 
pipeline which caused the columns of oil to oscillate in 
the manometer tube. 

(c) The effective specific gravities of the manometer fluid 
varied considerably with temperature. It was necessary to 
employ a correction factor for the effect of temperature 
on the specific gravity. 

Using water over carbon tetrachloride as a manometer fluid 
it was found that the specific gravity change^by 1/4 of 1$ for 
a temperature change of 5°F; no calibration was therefore 
necessary. 

With reasonable precautions to ensure clean tubes no 
difficulty was experienced with the use of carbon-tetrachloride 


as a manometer fluid.

The weighing tank . The weighing tank is mounted on a set of 
Fairbanks scales, capacity 500 lbs. and graduated in half 
pounds. The base of the weighing tank is conical in shape, 
thus preventing accumulation of solid matter which settles out 
from the suspension. 

The tank is emptied by gravity into the supply tank. The 
line from the weighing tank to the supply tank descends almost 
to the bottom of the supply tank and is fitted with two elbows 
in the form of a return bend at its lower end. This was to 
ensure that the discharge from the weighing tank was below the 
surface of the suspension in the supply tank and yet in an 
upward direction -- thus preventing any entrained air being 
carried down from the weighing tank into the supply tank and 
directly out into the pipeline system again. At high flow rates, 
without the above-mentioned precautions being taken, it was 
found that considerable air entrainment took place. The result 
of this was an accumulation of air in the sight glasses above 
the pressure tappings, necessitating frequent flushing. 

VI Sample cocks . It was found necessary to modify the equipment 
so that samples of the suspension could be taken at the inlet 
and outlet of the 3 /^ in. pipeline (S^, S 2 ) and at the outlet 
of the 1 l/k in. pipeline (S^). This was achieved by inserting 
two-way brass cocks in the pipeline. The necessity of sampling 
at both the inlet and outlet of each pipeline was due to the 
fact that at the lower flow rates encountered, settling of the 













barytes particles in the suspension occurred within the pipeline, 
thus invalidating any pressure drop data obtained. Two way brass 
cocks were used so that the whole cross-section of the flow 
through the pipe could be diverted into the sampling vessel, 
ensuring that a representative sample of the suspension was 


obtained.

CHAPTER 4 

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE 

A Proper ti es of the Dry So l id and the Suspens ion 

The experimental procedures employed to determine the following 
properties 

I Properties of the dry solid. 

(a) Specific gravity 

(b) Particle size 

(c) Farticle shape 

(d) Average settling rate 

II Properties of the suspension. 

(a) Density 

(b) Rheology 
are described below. 

The gross sample of barytes used for both the pipeline tests 
and the determination of the properties of the suspension was 
supplied by the Baroid Division, National Lead Company, Houston, 
Texas. Details of the commercial specifications are included in 
Appendix D. Six 100 lb. bags made up the gross sample. 

A representative sample of barytes for property determinations 
was obtained by sampling each 100 lb. bag and then reducing the size 
of this sample, by coning and quartering, to about 2 lb. This was 
thoroughly mixed. The rejected sample was bottled and sealed for 
further tests, (Sample l). 






V"/ 


\ J 











The final sample was soaked with 500 c.c. distilled water for 
a week and then diluted to form six individual samples of approximately 
250 c.c, each with percentage solids contents ranging from 27 to 7 
These samples were used for the determination of the rheological 
properties of the suspensions. 

The bulk of the 600 lb. gross sample was soaked in water for a 
week prior to being placed in the flow circuit. 

I Properties of the dry solid. 

(a) Specific gravity: 

The specific gravity of the dry barytes was determined 
by the standard gravity bottle procedure. The determination 
was carried out in triplicate, the results being averaged 
for computational use. 

(b) Particle size analysis: 

The standard procedure was followed in using the Roller 
Particle Sizer, the determination being carried out on 
samples of barytes taken from Sample 1 of the representative 
sample. 

(c) Particle shape: 

A photomicrograph, at approximately 700 magnifications, 
was obtained by standard procedures using a small portion 
of Sample 1. 

(d) Average settling rate: 

A simple semi-quantitative settling test was carried 
out on samples of suspension of six different specific 






' .a..;’ 


V ■ : ) 






gravities using a 2 litre graduate cylinder and 
determining the rate of fall of the clear water- 
suspension interface with a stopwatch. Care was taken 
that all determinations were at approximately JO°F . 

Properties of the suspension 

(a) Density -- Percentage solids: 

Two separate techniques were used, the more accurate 
technique being employed for the suspension samples that 
were tested in the viscometer. 

(i) Viscometer sample: The percentage solids in the 
sample was determined by a gravimetric method; a 
small sample being weighed, then dried and weighed 
again. Duplicate tests were performed. 

(ii) Pipeline sample: A large sample (approximately 
5 litres) was collected and its specific gravity 
determined by determining the volume of the sample 
and its weight. 

The method of sampling from the pipeline for 
density determination was quick, convenient to use 
and sufficiently accurate for the required purpose. 
The used sample of suspension was returned to the 
supply tank. 

(b) Rheological properties: 

A sample of the suspension, having been allowed to come 
to the test temperature of 70°F by immersion in the 






■J 


:. v , , u. 


s\; o 








4o 


subsidiary constant temperature vessel, was placed in the 
viscometer cup, the sample filling the cup to a predetermined 
mark. Vigorous stirring of the sample with a thermometer 
served to ensure that no settling occurred previous to the 
start of the test. The temperature of the sample was recorded. 
The cup, containing the suspension, was placed upon the movable 
platform of the viscometer and the platform raised until the 
rotor and enclosed stator were submerged to the depth indicated 
by a mark etched on the rotor. The motor was started, the 
rotor revolved at a constant speed and a torque, arising from 
the fluid's viscous drag acting on the bob, was balanced by 
the helically wound suspension spring. After the instrument 
was started the dial reading was observed to rise to a maximum. 
This maximum value was observed as indicative of the shear stress 
at the bob wall. Falling off of this maximum deflection was 
attributed to settling of the solid particles of barytes in the 
viscometer cup. The maximum deflection was read off the dial 
scale at the top of the instrument. The deflection and rotor 
speed were noted. This procedure was repeated three times for 
each rotor speed, an average value of the three deflections 
being recorded and used to calculate the shear stress. 

A given test on a given percentage solid suspension was 
carried out at a series of rotor speeds. Starting at a low 
rotor speed and -- iaeyoacing the speed by increments until the

maximum was attained. The speed was then reduced by increments 
until the lowest speed, consistent with obtaining a measurable 
dial deflection, was reached. A normal test resulted in the 
determination of the shear stress at ten different shear rates 
within the range from 5 to 1000 reciprocal seconds. A series 
of tests at increasing and then decreasing rates of shear were 
necessary to ensure that thixotropic characteristics were 
absent from the suspension’s rheological behaviour. 

The rheological properties of all six samples of suspension 
were determined as described above. 

Operation of the Pipeline 

Two separate series of tests were carried out on the pilot 

pipeline. 

1. The first series of tests was designed to determine the 
adequacy of the equipment and to provide experience in the 
operating techniques. Water was used as the flowing fluid 
during this series of tests, the results obtained being compared 
with those predicted by the theory. These tests were in the 
nature of calibrating tests. 

2. The second series of tests, using the techniques developed 
during the first series, were to determine the pipeline flow 
characteristics of a series of barytes-water suspensions. 

The procedures used in securing data on the suspensions 
and on water differ slightly. The methods for handling the 
suspensions will be described first and the simplifications

possible when water is the flowing fluid will be mentioned 
later. 

I Pipeline flow of suspensions : The following procedure was followed., 
start up of the pilot pipeline, to obtain a series of pressure drop- 
rate of flow data for a given percentage solids suspension. 

(a) The pump was started and the suspension circulated for 10 
minutes. This served to ensure that all the solids were in 
suspension — any adjustment of the percentage solids was made 
immediately after this preliminary period of circulation. 

(b) All pressure transmission lines were checked for the absence of 
air bubbles and the line system flushed out with water if 
necessary. 

(c) The valves isolating the sight glasses were opened to ensure 
that no air bubbles remained in the pressure tappings. Any 
trapped air was vented; during this venting process suspension 
was allowed to rise into the sight glasses up to the scribed 
level. 

Flow conditions having reached equilibrium, the pilot pipeline 
was then ready for a series of pressure drop—rate of flow 
determinations. The procedure was carried out in the following 
order:- 

1. The average rate of flow through the pilot pipeline was 

determined by collecting a known weight of the discharging 


suspension.

■■ \.j 







51 


2. A measure of the pressure drop along each of the pipelines 
was obtained by using either one of the manometers depending 
upon the magnitude of the pressure drop in the given 
pipeline. 

3. The temperature at the return bend in the pipeline was 
recorded. 

4. Samples of the suspension were taken at the three sample 
points S^, & 2 ’ an( ^ ^3 - The percentage solids in each 
sample was determined as described previously. 

5* The flow through the pipeline was cut back. Flow 
conditions were allowed to stabilize. 

The above procedure was repeated until it became obvious, 
either from the pressure drop behaviour or from the samples of 
suspension, that settling out was occurring within the pipeline. 

Using the above techniques pressure drop--rate of flow 
data was obtained for seven different barytes-water suspensions 
with percentage solids ranging from 20 to 
II Pipeline flow of water : Water was used directly from the mains, 
excepting at the very high flow rates, thus eliminating the use 
of the pump to a considerable extent. Low flow rates required 
the use of an inclined carbon tetrachloride manometer to measure 
the pressure drop. 

The techniques employed with the pipeline flow of water were 


indentical with those employed with the suspensions. The 













52 


procedure outlined above was followed, with the exception of 
Step 4. Measurement of the rate of flow at very low flow 
rates was performed on a volume basis rather than a weight 


basis.

CHAPTER 5 

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 


In this chapter the experimental results are presented; 
derived results, the methods used to calculate these results and 
their interpretation are presented and discussed in the following 
chapter. 

Most of the basic data are presented in tabular form in the 
appendices. The graphical representations of the basic experimental 
data will be presented and discussed in this chapter. 

The experimental results are presented in the following order, 
under the general headings: 

I Properties of the dry solid 

II Properties of the suspension 

III Pipeline flow properties 

I Properties of the dry solid 

(a) Specific gravity: 

As the result of three determinations the average 
specific gravity of the barytes was found to be 4.22 

(b) Particle size: 

The detailed results of the particle size distribution 
determination are presented in Appendix D, Table 1-D. 

Column (l) tabulates the size fraction in microns and 
column (10) gives the cumulative weight percentage passing

the given size fraction. These results are presented 
graphically in Figure 12 where average particle size is 
plotted vs. cumulative weight percentage passing. It can 
be seen that approximately 90 $ of the particles are less 
than 30 microns in diameter, also that there is a fairly 
wide distribution of particle sizes within the range 
0-30 microns. 

(c) Particle shape: 

The wide distribution of particle size within the 
0 - 30micron range noted in the particle size analysis is 
also observed in the photomicrographs of the barytes, 
illustrated in Figure 10. 

The particles appear to be crystalline, angular and 
irregular in shape. The small black specks observed are 
probably rock impurities in the barytes sample. The size 
of the largest particle on this particular photomicrograph 
is approximately 25 microns. 

(d) Settling rate: 

The settling data are presented in Appendix D, 

Table 2-D. Figure 11, which is a graph of initial settling 
rate vs» weight percentage solids illustrates these data. 

At low weight percentages of solids the initial settling 
rate is high. As the percentage of solids increases, 
hindered settling occurs and the initial settling rate 


decreases rapidly.

II Properties of the suspension 

The viscometer experimental data are presented in 
Appendix B, Table 1-B. Columns (l) and (2) present the test 
number and the weight percentage solids of the suspension 
being tested. The basic viscometer data are tabulated in 
columns (3) and (4) under the headings deflection and rotor 
speed. These two columns represent smoothed values of scale 
deflection taken at even increments of rotor speed. Plots of 
the original experimental data,, in the form of deflection vs. 
rotor speed are illustrated in Figures E 1 -- E 6 in Appendix 
E. These plots were used to compute the shear rate in the 
viscometer; the shear rate is presented in column (5) of 
Table 1-B. The computational methods used are described in 
Appendix E. The shear stress, listed in column ( 6 ) of Table 
1-B is computed from the deflection, column (3), via the 
proportionality constant determined during the calibration 
of the viscometer with Newtonian fluids of known viscosity 
(see Appendix A). Column ( 7 ) lists the apparent viscosity 
of the suspension and is obtained by dividing the values in 
column (6) by those in column (5)*, The units of apparent 
turbulence criterion, proposed by Merrill (op. cit.), are 
computed and presented in column ( 8 ). It can be seen that the 
condition of turbulence is never reached, according to the 
criterion used; however, at high shear rates with the lower 































































































































































































































SHEAR STRESS , T -+- 0.\ , dynes pe 












































































































61 


percentage solids suspensions conditions are approaching those 
of turbulence. 

These experimental data are also presented graphically in 
Figures 23 and 24. The calculated data i.e. shear stress and 
shear rate are first plotted on semilogarithmic coordinates 
with shear stress as ordinate, weight percentage solids as 
abscissa and shear rate as parameter. This is illustrated in 
Figure 23. The purpose of this plot is two-fold; in the first 
case it serves as a plot for smoothing and checking the basic 
data for consistency. An additional aid in smoothing and 
extending the data is the fact that the ordinate value is 
known accurately at 0$ solids i.e. the shear stress can be 
calculated from the shear rate and the known viscosity of water 
at 70°F. Secondly, the graph can be used to prepare a plot in 
the form of the conventional flow diagram i.e. shear stress vs. 
shear rate. This plot is illustrated in Figure 24, the para¬ 
meter being percentage solids taken at even increments. 

Several interesting features are observed on examining 
this flow diagram. 

1 . It should be noted that the plot is prepared with the 

addition of a small constant to the ordinate and abscissa 
values, thus enabling extropolations to be made to zero 
shear stress and shear rate on logarithmic coordinates.

2. Within the range of shear rates from 10 to 500 
reciprocal seconds (approximately), the suspensions 
conform rather closely to Bingham plastic behaviour. The 
only exception to this statement is the 80 $ solids 
suspension; the anomalous characteristics present here 
can probably be attributed in part to its time dependent 
properties. Examination of the basic data for the 78 . 9 $ 
solids suspension (Appendix E, Figure E-4) indicates that 
thixotropic characteristics are present. The dotted line 
represents the data obtained at increasing rates of shear 
while the solid line represents the data obtained at 
decreasing rates of shear after the suspension had been 
sheared at the maximum rate of shear. 

3 . Above a rate of shear of 500 reciprocal seconds the 

flow curve begins to acquire a slope greater than 1. Two 

■ 

possibilities present themselves: 
i) At high rates of shear the barytes-water suspensions 
exhibit dilatancy. 

ii) Conditions in the viscometer annulus are such that 
turbulence is imminent. 

At present insufficient information is available to decide 
which, if either, of the two alternatives is correct. 

4. At shear rates below 10 reciprocal seconds the flow 


curves begin to acquire concavity towards the abscissa

thus indicating a pseudoplastic characteristic in the 
suspension behaviour. The viscometer data obtained did 
not extend below approximately 5 reciprocal seconds. 

However, the data are interpolated to zero on the 
assumption of pseudoplastic behaviour at low shear rates. 

The interpolations are shown on Figure 24 as a series of 
dashed lines. 

The line for zero percentage solids has also been constructed 
and plotted on the flow curve for the barytes-water suspensions. 

Ill Pipeline flow properties 

The pipeline experimental data are presented in Appendix C, 
Table 1-C. Columns ( 3 ); (4) and ( 5 ) present respectively, the 
percentage solids content of the suspension entering a given 
pipeline, leaving and a calculated average. This calculated 
average value requires further explanation. In the course of 
operating the pipeline flow circuit it was found that settling 
out of the solids in the suspension occurred within the pipeline 
at low flow rates. This could be detected either by noting a 
considerable difference in the inlet and outlet percentage solids 
of the: fluid flawing in the pipeline or by a sudden change in 
the presstire drop along the pipeline. Accordingly, until the 
onset of settling became apparent, the percentage solids content 
of the suspension remained approximately constant and for 
computational purposes an average value was calculated on the 
















64 


basis of all the percentage solids determinations for a given 
test previous to the onset of settling. After settling had 
commenced an average value was calculated for each individual 
test on the basis of inlet and outlet percentage solids. 

The friction factor and a Reynolds number (based upon the 
density of the flowing fluid and the viscosity of water at 
pipeline conditions, called hereafter the modified Reynolds 
number) are presented in columns ( 9 ) and (10), being the result 
of computing the basic data, flow rate and pressure drop, 
tabulated in columns ( 7 ) and (8) respectively. 

Tests number 52, 53 > and 58 were carried out as a form of 
calibrating test, the flowing fluid being water. The results 
of these three tests appear in Figure 15* which is a plot of 
friction factor vs. Reynolds number. It can be seen that the 
data lie on the theoretical line in both the laminar and 
turbulent flow zones indicating that the techniques employed 
to measure pressure drop and flow rate were quite satisfactory, 
and that the pipeline is smooth. 

The results of the pipeline flow tests using barytes-water 
suspensions are presented in Figures l6 to 22, which are plots 
of friction factor vs. modified Reynolds number. Several 
features are common to each of these plots for different 
weight percentage solids suspensions.

Each graph exhibits two distinct portions. 

1. At high Reynolds numbers the curve is approximately 
parallel to and above the theoretical curve. With 
increasing percentage solids the separation between the 
experimental and theoretical curves becomes greater. 

The data obtained from both diameter pipelines appear 
to fall on the same curve. 

2. At lower Reynolds numbers the data fall on two lines 
which are parallel to each other and lie at an angle of 
approximately 60° to the abscissa. The data from the 
larger diameter pipeline all fall on the line branching 
off at the higher Reynolds number. 

Two exceptions to the above generalizations must be noted, 
i) The data for Tests 69 (21.3$ solids) and 63 ( 31 . 9 1<> 
solids) coincide in the portion of the curve parallel 
to the Karman-Nikuradse line. 

ii) The relative positions of the 3A inch and 1 l/k inch 
pipeline data are reversed in the results of test 63 
( 31 . 9 io solids). 

These two apparent discrepancies are thought to be due to 

lack of data and experimental error.

CHAPTER 6 

INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS 


Derived results, the method used to calculate these results 
and their interpretation are presented and discussed in this chapter. 

Careful examination of the rheological data indicates that the 
flow behaviour is complex, but that over a wide range of shear rates 
the barytes-water suspensions closely approximate Bingham plastic 
behaviour. 

The general methods of correlation, described in the literature 
survey, for pipeline flow of non-Newtonians are, in the main, applic¬ 
able only to the laminar flow zone. Most of the data obtained in 
this investigation was at relatively high flow rates. The settling 
characteristies of the barytes-water suspensions prohibited exten¬ 
sive testing in the laminar flow zone. 

Furthermore, the general methods of correlation proposed for 
the turbulent zone may only be applied when the rheological propert¬ 
ies of the flowing fluid are known at the rates of shear existent in 
the pipeline under flowing conditions. Approximate calculations 
show that over a considerable range of flow rates, the shear stress 
at the wall of the pipeline is considerably in excess of the shear 
stresses present during the determination of the rheological prop¬ 
erties of the barytes-water suspensions. For example, using the 
equation

(15) 


and the basic, pipeline flow data; for the flow of a 70 $ solids con¬ 


tent suspension through the 3/4 inch pipeline, at the maximum flow 


























75 


rate noted; then the shear stress at the wall of the pipeline is 

2 

approximately 1000 dynes per cm . Using the same flowing fluid 
and pipeline, at the minimum rate of flow noted, the maximum shear 
stress at the wall of the pipeline is approximately 85 dynes per cm . 
The average shear stress in the pipeline will, of course, be consid¬ 
erably less than the maximum. The maximum shear stress existing 

during the rheological testing of the suspension was of the order of 
2 

200 dynes per cm . Notwithstanding the fact that an extreme example 
has been quoted, it is plain that experimental rheological data are 
lacking for the range of shear stress of interest. 

An approximate approach to the interpretation of the rheological 
data has, therefore, been employed. The concept of an equivalent 
Bingham plastic fluid has been used. This approach has the advantage 
of simplicity; extrapolation of the data, extending to ranges of shear 
rate above those existent in the viscometer, is easy and relatively 
certain. Furthermore, methods of correlation of pipeline and vis¬ 
cometer data have been proposed previously for Bingham plastic 
fluids, even in the turbulent zone. Thus the data obtained experi¬ 
mentally, interpreted in terms of an equivalent Bingham plastic 
afford an opportunity to check the applicability of Bingham plastic 
methods to a more complex system. 

For these reasons the rheological data are re-interpreted on 
the basis of the nearest equivalent Bingham plastic. 

The two characterizing features of a Bingham plastic are the 
coefficient of rigidity, W, and the yield value, T y . Using the approx- 



















76 


imate approach, the rheological data are used to calculate equiv¬ 
alent coefficients of rigidity, jj eq , and an equivalent yield value, 
T^e , from the rheological data. These characterizing constants are 
then compared with the same two constants (called the effective co¬ 
efficient of rigidity, rj^, and an effective yield value, T v ^, res¬ 
pectively) obtained by calculation from the pipeline data using 
previously developed correlations. 

Consequently, the interpretation of the results may be consid¬ 
ered under two general headings: 

I The coefficient of rigidity 

II The yield value 

In addition to the comparison of the rheological properties 
obtained by the two methods, a final comparison is made of the 
applicability of a Bingham plastic fluid correlation to the barytes- 
water suspensions, through a plot of friction factor vs. equivalent 
Bingham Reynolds number with equivalent Bingham yield number as 
parameter. In this comparison the equivalent coefficients of rig¬ 
idity and equivalent yield values, determined from the rheological 
data, are used. This method of correlation has been used previously 
by Govier and Winning (9)» 

I. The coeffieient of rigidity 

In order to obtain values of the equivalent coefficient of rigid- 
ity, rj e q, from the rheological data, which can be compared with those 
obtained from the pipeline data (effective coefficients of rigidity, 
ijg), it is necessary to extrapolate the rheological data to higher

rates of shear. 

Two methods are available for the extrapolation of the rheolog¬ 
ical data. 

(i) Tangent extrapolation method. 

Having decided that the suspension under investigation closely 
approximates a Bingham plastic in its rheological behaviour, it is 
apparent that as the rate of shear increases the flow curve will 
approach and ultimately become tangential to a line of slope unity 
on the flow curve. Hence using the flow curves illustrated in 
Figure 24, tangents are drawn, at 45° to the abscissa, to each of 
the flow curves for the different percentage solids suspensions. 
These tangents are then produced back to the ordinate at the shear 
rate of 100 reciprocal seconds, values of the shear stress read off 
and the equivalent coefficient of rigidity calculated directly in 
poise (i.e. by dividing the shear stress reading by the shear rate, 
100 sec”'*'). The equivalent coefficient of rigidity is then plotted 
vs. weight percentage solids on semi-logarithmic oo-ordinates as 
shown in Figure 26. 

(ii) Reciprocal extrapolation method: 

This method of extrapolation of the rheological data is due to 
Weltmann (25). The apparent viscosity at a given rate of shear, 
taken from the flow curve, is plotted against the reciprocal of 
the rate of shear on logarithmic co-ordinates. This is illustrat¬ 
ed in Figure 25. By extrapolation the coefficient of rigidity at 
infinite rate of shear can be obtained. The values of the equiva-

lent coefficient of rigidity obtained using this method are then 
plotted on the same graph of equivalent coefficient of rigidity vs. 
weight percentage solids as those obtained by the tangent extrapol¬ 
ation method,, (see Figure 26). 

Comparison of the results shows that the equivalent coefficient 
of rigidity estimated by the tangent extrapolation method is higher 
than that obtained by the reciprocal extrapolation method. Of the 
two techniques, the reciprocal extrapolation method is much easier 
to use. Also on Figure 26 two other lines are marked, the dashed 
line representing the average equivalent coefficient of rigidity, 
Ijeqgj obtained by averaging the values determined by the two extra¬ 
polation methods. 

The other line shows what is called an "effective coefficient 
of rigidity", n-^, determined solely from the pressure drop data 


by assuming that the turbulent pipeline data should correlate in a 
manner identical with that for Newtonian fluids in turbulent flow. 


i. e. that the f - DV 


7 


( 


relationship coincides with the f -DVp 


M* 


relationship for Newtonians. This expectation is supported by 
data of Wilhelm, Wroughton and Hoeffel (27) and that of Alves, 
Boucher and Pigford (l). Therefore, by locating the best fit 
uurve through the experimental data on the fvs Re plot parallel to 
the Karman-Nikuradse line it is possible to calculate the value of 
this effective coefficient of rigidity. This has been done for the 
seven tests on the barytes-water suspensions and the results are 







plotted on semi-logarithmic co-ordinates as the effective coeffic¬ 
ient of rigidity vs. weight percentage solids in Figure 27 and also 
in combination with the equivalent coefficient of rigidity values 
estimated from the rheological data, in Figure 26. 

A comparison of the four sets of data is interesting. It is 
particularly interesting to note that up to 50$ solids the average 
equivalent curve and the effective curve agree quite closely, the 
maximum discrepancy being 11$. Recalling that the equation of the 
friction factor-Reynolds number curve in the turbulent zone is 
approximately 

. . - 0.2 

f = 0.046 Re 

it can be seen that an error of 11$ in the coefficient of rigidity 
used to calculate a Reynolds number would result in an error of 
only 2-1/2$ in the friction factor from which the pressure drop 
would be calculated. 

Thus good agreement is obtained between the average values of 
the equivalent coefficient of rigidity and the values of the effec¬ 
tive coefficients of rigidity. 

Above 50$ solids, however, the value of the equivalent coeffic¬ 
ient of rigidity estimated from the rheological data is much higher 
than the value effective in the pipeline. Evidence of thixotropy 
in the highest percentage solids suspension tested in the viscometer 
would suggest that this time dependent rheological property may be 
present as low as 50$ solids and that this may not have been detected 
in the rheological determination where tasting was'carried out over

a relatively short period of time. Consequently in the pipeline, 
where testing is extended over periods as long as two hours, the 
value of the effective coefficient of rigidity would be lower. 

The effect of using a value of the coefficient of rigidity 
which is too high, to estimate pressure drop, will result in the 
calculation of a Reynolds number which is too low, thus giving 
rise to an abnormally high friction factor and, therefore, high 
pressure drop. Hence in this percentage solids range the use of 
the equivalent coefficients of rigidity would result in over de¬ 
sign. 

The average equivalent coefficient of rigidity, *J e q^ , checks 
reasonably well with the effective coefficient of rigidity, 
determined from the pipeline correlation. Where the two disa¬ 
gree the latter, ij^, is probably the better of the two values. 

II The yield value 

The flow curve for a Bingham plastic fluid, when plotted on 
logarithmic coordinates, becomes asymptotic to the yield value 
at low rates of shear. Hence by extrapolating the rheological 
data to very low rates of shear it is possible to obtain an 
extimate of the equivalent yield value of the barytes-water 
suspension. 

The rheological data obtained are illustrated in Figure 2k. 
It can be seen that, in spite of the fact that data were obtained 
at the relatively low shear rate of 5 reciprocal seconds. 

















d4 


extrapolation to zero shear rate involves extrapolation over 1 l/2 
cycles on this particular graph with the given constants added to 
the axes. Nevertheless extrapolation is much simpler and more 
accurate than if the flow curves had been plotted on arithmetic 
coordinates. On arithmetic coordinates, extrapolation of the 
rheological data is highly uncertain. The flow curves have become 
flat enough at 5 reciprocal seconds to enable this extrapolation 
to be carried out using visual judgement alone without introducing 
too great an element of uncertainty. As an additional aid to 
extrapolation, some guidance can be obtained by the application of 
the Bingham equation 

* - T y = y dF . ( 2 ) 

to the data in the low shear rate region. Using values of the 
coefficient of rigidity determined by the tangent extrapolation 
method, values of shear stress and shear rate are substituted in 
equation (2) and an estimate of the yield value obtained. 

Using the combined techniques of visual extrapolation and 
calculation the equivalent yield values were determined. The 
actual extrapolations made are marked as dotted lines on Figure 24. 
The results of the extrapolations are indicated in Figure 28 
which is a semi logarithmic plot of equivalent yield value vs. 
weight percentage solids. It is observed that the logarithm of 
the yield value is nearly linear with weight percentage solids. 
Again at the higher percentage solids it is noted that the yield 
value increases more rapidly. 














85 


An estimate of the yield value can also he obtained from the 
pipeline data. Using values of the effective coefficient of 
rigidity calculated from the pipeline data, the friction factor - 
Reynolds number product has been calculated. The relationship 
between the friction factor - Reynolds number product and the yield 
number, applicable to the laminar flow of Bingham plastics in 
circular pipes -- graphically represented in Figure 3 was then used 
to obtain a value of the Yield number, thus enabling an estimate 
of the effective Yield value to be obtained. The results of the 
estimation of the effective yield values from the pipeline data 
are illustrated, together with equivalent yield values calculated 
from the rheological data, in Figure 28. Comparison of the two 
sets of data indicate very poor agreement between the effective 
and equivalent yield values. Whereas the equivalent yield stress 
data lie consistently upon a smooth curve, the effective yield 
stress data is not consistent. This inconsistency is probably due 
to the fact that the pipeline data used to estimate T v was not, 

in fact, within the laminar flow zone. The relationship between 
the friction factor - effective Bingham Reynolds number product 
and the effective Bingham Yield number holds only for the laminar 
flow of Bingham plastics in a pipeline. 

As a. further comparison of the rheological properties and a 
test of the applicability of the Bingham plastic equivalence, all 
the pipeline data have been plotted in terms of the friction

an equivalent Yield number, ■ — as a parameter. Each of the 

dimensionless groups is based on the rheological data. The 
calculated results used to obtain this plot are tabulated in 
Appendix F, Table 1-F, the same results being illustrated 
graphically in Figure 29. 

Several interesting features may be noted: 

1. At the high flow rates, the data fall slightly below, yet 
parallel to, the Karman-Nikuradse line; no differentiation 
is noted between data obtained from different diameter 
pipelines or suspensions of different percentage solids 
contents. 

2. At intermediate flow rates, over a range of Reynolds 
numbers corresponding roughly to the transition zone for 
Newtonian fluids (yet extending to higher Reynolds 

■ 

numbers), the data lie below the theoretical line and 
become separated with respect to pipeline diameter and 
weight percentage solids i.e. separated with respect to 
Yield numbers. 

3. At the low flow rates, presumably around the upper limit 
of the laminar flow zone, the data break away from the 
general trend of the turbulent zone theoretical line and 
extend upwards at a slope of approximately minus 1, being 
separated with respect to Yield number.

The considerable discrepancies, particularly in respect of 
Yield number, noted in the data obtained at low flow rates are 
thought to be due to experimental error, lack of sufficient data 
and possibly due to the onset of settling within the pipeline. 

It will be noted that theoretical Bingham Yield number 
parameter lines have been drawn parallel to the Poiseuille line 
(i.e. the laminar flow line for Newtonian fluids). Furthermore 
inspection of the small amount of data in this laminar zone 
suggests that agreement between experimental data and theory is 
closer at the higher percentage solids. It is tentatively suggested 
that, at low rates of flow, with barytes suspensions of low 
percentage solids, the effect of settling masks the true flow 
behaviour of the fluid. In addition, coincidence of the experimental 
data with the theoretically predicted lines assumes laminar flow.

CHAPTER 7 
CONCLUSIONS 


1. The rheological behaviour of barytes-water suspensions, 
although complex, can be expressed in terms of the nearest 
equivalent Bingham plastic fluid. 

2. The rheological data, although obtained over a limited range 
of shear rates, can be extrapolated to values of shear rate 
existing in pipeline flow of the suspensions. Estimates 
can be made of the two characterizing properties of the 
equivalent Bingham plastic, i. e. the equivalent coefficient 
of rigidity, n , and the equivalent yield stress, T v .

3. A correlation of the rheological data with the pipeline flow 
data indicates that 

(i) The Friction factor is independent of the Equiva¬ 
lent Bingham Yield number at high Equivalent 

I). 

Bingham Reynolds numbers (greater than 2 x 10 ) 

(ii) The Friction factor is a function of both the

(iii) The correlation of the data is not good below 

the Equivalent Bingham Reynolds number of 5 x 10^.

COMMERCIAL SPECIFICATIONS 

OF THE BARYTES 


The sample of barytes used vas supplied by the Baroid Division of 
the National Lead Company., Houston, Texas, through the subsiduary 
company Baroid of Canada Limited. 

The commercial specifications of the baroid were: 

i) Particle size — an average of 89 $ (with a high of 95*0$ and 
a low of 86 . 5 $) through 325 mesh (40 microns), 

ii) Specific gravity — an average of 4.25 with a range from 
4.35 to 4.22. 

iii) Chemical composition — 95$ barium sulphate. 

The exact chemical composition varies with mine location. 
Processing of the mined barytes involves size reduction. 
Angular shaped particles are obtained with wide variation 
in particle shape due to the wide varieties in the composition 
of the original deposits.
