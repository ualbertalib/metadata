THE BASIC AMINO ACID CONTENT OF 


SOME PLANT PROTEINS 


William E. Brown 


INTRODUCTION 


It is now generally recognized that the biological 
values of different proteins are not equal. The majority of 
agriculturists still evaluate rations simply on the basis of 
their protein content, although it is known that feeding some 
animal protein supplement is advantageous with at least some 
farm animals. The amino acid content of plant proteins dif¬ 
fers from species to species. Block and Bolling (4) even 
suggest that "just as the vitamin and mineral content of a 
plant can be varied by breeding and cultivation it is probable 
that the amino acid composition of its proteins can likewise 
vary”. 

To insure optimum health the amino acid requirements 
of the animal body must be met. Certain of these amino acids 
are essential and cannot be dispensed with in the diet (25). 
The three basic amino acids—arginine, histidine, and lysine— 
have been classified as being either indispensable or semi- 
indispensable. The main animal feeds in this country are the

cereal grains which have been shown by both biological and 
ohemical assays to be deficient in lysine (18). On the other 
hand, animal proteins have a relatively high lysine content*

Bolling (4) are tabulated below.

The need for protein supplements to make up the 
deficiencies in grain is obvious since grain feeding is a 
very common practice with all types of livestock. Tankage, 
fish meal, buttermilk, and other animal supplements are 
generally considered to be best. The demand, however, has 
at times far exceeded the supply. It is here that vegetable 
proteins enter the picture. The question of their nutritional 
value becomes of importance if they are to be used in quan¬ 
tity.

The main purpose of this investigation was to deter- 

A 

mine the amount of each of the three basic amino acids in 
pea meal, linseed oil meal, and alfalfa meal, three feeds of 
relatively high protein content which can be produced on our

The problem of determining the amino acids present 
in natural feeds is even more difficult than when purified 
proteins are analyzed. It is generally recognized that amino 
acid determinations which may give reasonably accurate results 
on purified proteins fail miserably when applied to natural 
feeds. The acid hydrolysis of protein produces a nitrogen- 
containing substance called humin, an insoluble fraction 
important because of its bearing on the quantitative deter¬ 
mination of certain of the amino acids. The presence of 
carbohydrates greatly increases this fraction. Rozas (£6) 
found that small amounts of humin were formed when the bases, 
arginine, histidine, and lysine, were heated with carbohy¬ 
drate solution. Tristram (33) in 1939 hydrolyzed the three 
bases individually in the presence of various furfuraldehyde- 
yielding carbohydrates. He reported that arginine suffers a 
loss roughly proportional to the amount of carbohydrate pre¬ 
sent, that histidine recoveries may be very irregular and that 
lysine recoveries are normal unless a large excess of car¬ 
bohydrate is present. A preliminary study of the dispersion 
of the proteins of pea meal, linseed oil meal, and alfalfa 
meal was made. The aim was to extract a high percentage of 
the total protein in a relatively pure form and, at the same 
time, maintain its original chemical characteristics. 

The need for a comparatively simple method of 
analysis was apparent. In 1940 Albanese (1) reported an

electrolytic method for the determination of the basic amino 
acids in protein. The author claims for this micro-method 
two desirable features, namely, simplicity of operation, and 
precision. An investigation of the possibility of using the 
method was undertaken. 

The work involved in this research is consequently 
reported in three sections: 

I. Dispersion studies with the proteins of pea 
meal, linseed oil meal, and alfalfa meal; 

II. An investigation of the electrical transport 
method of basic amino acid analysis. 

III. A presentation of the results obtained with 
some plant proteins using the electrical transport method of 
analysis.

DISPERSION STUDIES TOTH THE PROTEINS OF 


PEA MEAL, LINSEED OIL MEAL, AND 
ALFALFA MEAL 


Literature Review 


The investigations of Denis, Seyler, Ritthausen, 
and others (30) in the 19th century made it clear that plant 
proteins exist in many diverse forms. Owing to the differ¬ 
ences in the properties of the protein constituents in the 
different meals to he investigated, each is discussed in turn. 

Pea Meal 

Legumin was referred to in the early literature as 
a substance extracted from seeds by caustic alkalis and more 
or less altered by the action of the solvent. Osborne and 
Campbell (30) reported that pea seeds contain two globulins— 
legumin and vicilin—and an albumin—legumelin. Legumin was 
thought to be the chief protein constituent. A water extrac¬ 
tion of peas yielded 4% legumin and 2% legumel in, in terms of 
the weight of the seed. 

In a later experiment Osborne and Campbell (30) 
extracted pea meal with 10% NaCl solution and obtained a ratio 
of one part albumin to 3.42 parts globulin. Unfortunately

Osborne, interested primarily in the nature of the proteins, 
does not report yields in many of his papers, 

Staker and Gortner (30) dispersed the protein of 
Andes pea meal in water and in M/3 neutral salt solutions. 
They reported water peptized 78,87$ of the total nitrogen, 
potassium fluoride 85,33$, potassium sulphate 83,93$, potas¬ 
sium chloride 84.05$, potassium bromide 88.33$, and finally 
potassium iodide 95.18$. The anions formed the following 
lyotropic series on the basis of dispersing power, 

S0 4 < CL < F < Br < I . 

By extracting the meal with ether the subsequent 
dispersion of protein in these solvents was increased by from 
0.05$ to 7.38$. The theory is advanced that the protein is 
imbedded in a layer of fat-like substance which prevents the 
salt solutions from exerting their maximum peptizing effect. 
The ratio of albumin to globulin was reported as 1:6.36. 

Dermanskii, Antonovich, and Silaev (7) found two 
peptization maxima for pea protein, one in 3$ NaCl correspond¬ 
ing to vicilin, the other in 10 - 30$ NaCl corresponding to 
legumin. Using KC1 as the dispersing agent one maximum was 
obtained in a 0.03 - 0.05$ N solution.at pH 1.4 - 1.8. 

Ba Clg had a stronger peptizing action than KOI. 

Smith and Circle (38) determined the dispersion of 
the protein of Alaska peas over a pH range of 3.0 - 10.5, 
using distilled water adjusted to these acidities. A maximum 
dispersion of 83.8$ was obtained at pH 3.0, with a second

maximum of 97. 7% at pH 9 - 10.5. The minimum dispersion of 
14.8% was at pH 3.9. 

Linseed Oil Meal 

The literature contains no references to studies on 
the dispersion of the proteins in commercial linseed oil meal. 
Considerable data have, however, been reported on oil-free 
flax seed. 

In 1892 Osborne (30) found that the proteins of 
ether-extracted ground flax seed were largely soluble both in 
water and in sodium chloride solutions. He extracted with 
water and with saturated sodium chloride protein equal to 
10.5% and 9.25% respectively of the original weight of the oil- 
free meal. 

Staker and Gortner (30) attempted to disperse the 
nitrogen-containing substances of oil-free Redwing flax in 
water and M/2 neutral salt solutions. Water peptized 64.07% 
of the total nitrogen, potassium fluoride 53.53%, potassium 
sulphate 65.26%, potassium chloride 57.64%, potassium bromide 
63.51% , and potassium iodide 60.94%. The lyotropic series 
differed from that reported for pea protein. The series for 
dispersion of flax seed protein was 

F ^ Cl < I < Br <- SO 4 
but water was as effective as the best salt. 

O’Hara and Saunders (19) investigated the solubility 
of the nitrogenous constituents of defatted flax seed meal in

sodium chloride solutions. Water dispersed 24$ of these con¬ 
stituents. In concentrations of sodium chloride ranging from 
0.125 N to saturation, the dispersion varied from approximately 
42$ to 65$. Maximum dispersion was obtained in 0.575 N to 2.0 
N solutions. 

Smith, Circle, and Brother (29) obtained a 58$ extrac¬ 
tion of Bison flaxseed protein with water. After the seed 
was defatted with petroleum ether the water extract contained 
66 % of the total protein. A 2N solution of NaGl dispersed 
82$ of the protein of the defatted meal. More concentrated 
solutions gave no higher extraction. 

Alfalfa Leaf Meal 

No figures were available in the literature on the 
peptization of alfalfa leaf meal protein. In fact, very little 
work has been done on dry leaves of any species. Plant physio¬ 
logists have been quite interested in the extraction of the 
protein from the fresh leaves of plants. Miller (17) sum¬ 
marizes briefly the methods that have been used for extraction. 
The methods consist of macerating the leaves and plasmolizing 
the cells with "ether-water"; grinding and pressing the leaves; 
grinding the leaves, followed by high speed centrifuging. It 
is quite apparent that the methods for the extraction of the 
proteins and nitrogenous products from leaves vary greatly and 
the indications are that for best results special methods of

extraction must be applied to different types of leaves. 

Osborne, Wakeman, and Le&venworth (21) ground and 
pressed fresh young alfalfa plants. They extracted from the 
expressed juice in succession: 43*8$ of the total nitrogen 
with water; 2.0$ with 93$ alcohol; 7.0$ with 0.3$ aqueous 
NaOH; and 39.3$ with 0.3$ alcoholic NaOH. Total extraction 
was 92.1$ of the nitrogen present. 

The effect of drying fresh leaves on the subsequent 
extraction has been investigated. Chibnall (5) reported that 
the total water-soluble nitrogen of the fresh leaves of the 
runner bean was increased from 21.57$ to 33.68$ by drying the 
leaves in a current of warm air at 40°0. Conversely, Totting- 
ham, Schulz, and Lepkovski (32) found that drying sugar beet 
leaves without aeration at 40°C. lowered the total amount of 
soluble nitrogen. 


Materials 


The peas used in this study were of three common 
field varieties—Idabel, Chancellor, and Early Blue—grown at 
Edmonton. The linseed oil meal was a commercial sample. The 
alfalfa meal consisted of the air-dried leaves and blossoms of 
Ferax alfalfa plants grown in 1944 on the University plots at 
Edmonton. The alfalfa was 60$ in bloom at the time of picking. 

All samples were coarsely ground in a Wiley mill, 
ground for six hours in a ball mill, and then stored in bottles.

and the methods of extraction varied, details are given for 
each individual experiment. The flasks containing the meal- 
solvent mixtures were centrifuged for 10 minutes at £000 r,p,m, 
and the supernatant liquid decanted. The nitrogen content of 
the extract was determined on an aliquot. All extractions 
were made at room temperature and in duplicate. 

Oil Extraction 

A 10-gram sample of meal was extracted with 50 ml, 
of ether, and shaken intermittently for a period of two hours. 
Two subsequent extractions, each with 50 ml, of ether and of 
one-half hour duration, gave complete extraction.

Nitrogen 

The Kjeldahl method with mercuric oxide as cata¬ 
lyst was used. The protein was calculated as N x 6.25. 

Experimental Results 


Pea Meal 

The protein was extracted from 6-gram samples of 
pea meal with three successive treatments of one-half hour 
duration, using 50 ml. portions of the dispersing agent. 

Experiment I 

The effect of shaking during extraction on the 
dispersion of pea meal protein: 

The protein of Idabel pea meal was extracted 
with distilled water using two methods of shaking: 

(a) Continuous shaking for one-half hour; 

(b) Intermittent shaking - 2 minutes shaking, 5 minutes 
at rest, for one-half hour. 

The results as shown in Table II would appear to indicate 
that excessive agitation lowers the dispersion of pea 
meal protein. The difference was so slight, however, 
that not much significance may be attached to it. 

All subsequent extractions of pea meal

Experiment II 

The dispersion of the protein of Idabel pea 
meal in different concentrations of neutral salt solu¬ 
tions: 

The protein was dispersed in concentrations of 
1$, 2$, 3%, and 4%, of the three salts—sodium chloride, 
sodium salicylate, and sodium sulphate. The figures for 
dispersion in distilled water are included for comparison. 
The results are presented in Table III and Figure 1. The 
protein dispersed in 1$ solutions was in every case less 
than that dispersed in distilled water. This decreased 
dispersion is similar to the effect of weak neutral salt 
solutions on the dispersion of soybean protein as reported 
by Smith and Circle (28).

As one would expect, the decrease in dispersion 
varied with the salt used. Maximum dispersions were 
obtained in 3 a /> and 4^ concentrations. The results for the 
chloride and sulphate ions agree with the results of 
Staker and Gortner (30).

Experiment III 


A comparison of the dispersion of the protein 
of Idabel, Chancellor, and Early Blue pea meals in 3$ 
sodium chloride: 

The results are reported in Table IV, The dis¬ 
persion of the protein in each variety was well over 
90$. The results of this experiment indicate that the 
solubility of the nitrogen-containing constituents may 
vary from sample to sample.

Experiment I 

The meal-solvent ratio giving maximum disper¬ 
sion of linseed oil meal protein: 

Samples of "natural" and "oil-free" linseed 
oil meal weighing 2 grams were extracted with 50 ml. and 
100 ml. portions of 3$ NaCl. The results are summarized 
in Table V.

The greater solubility of the protein of the "oil- 
free" samples should be noted. The slight increase in dis¬ 
persion obtained using 100 ml, of solvent can scarcely be con¬ 
sidered significant. Despite this, in the following experiments 
100 ml. of solvent were used in each extraction for every 2 
grams of meal.

between the dispersion of the protein of the natural and 
oil-free meals, although the slight difference in favor 
of the oil-free meal is probably real. 

B. The dispersion of the protein of linseed oil 
meal was determined in 4$ sodium sulphate, 8$ sodium 
salicylate, 6$ sodium carbonate, 7$ ammonium sulphate, 
and 0.5$ NaOH* The pH of the ammonium sulphate solution 
was adjusted to 7.0. Dispersion values for distilled

Although the dispersion of the protein of the 
"oil-free" meals tends to he higher, the differences are 
so slight that they are of no practical importance. 

The dispersions in the neutral salt solutions 
all fell within the range of from 71$ to 77$. It is open 
to question whether the dispersion in 8$ sodium salicylate 
is significantly higher than that in 6$ sodium chloride. 

The 0.5$ NaOH gave the highest extraction. 

This was expected as many compounds are soluble in alka¬ 
line solutions. This extract cannot, however, be used 
in amino acid analysis for two reasons: firstly, much 
interfering material is present in the extract; and 
secondly, alkaline solutions alter the chemical proper¬ 
ties of proteins (18). 

Experiment III 

The dispersion of the protein of linseed oil 
meal in 6$ NaCl solutions adjusted to various acidities: 

The pH’s of the solutions were adjusted with 
dilute HC1. Table VIII summarizes the results.

No appreciable differences in dispersion were 
noted in the pH range 4 to 7. In solutions of increased 
acidity there was an indication that protein dispersion 
decreased markedly. Rich (23) reports similar results 
with wheat gluten. The dispersion of gluten in dilute 
magnesium sulphate solutions was very little influenced 
by the pH unless the solution was strongly acid or 
alkaline. Smith, Circle, and Brother (29), however, 
obtained maxima and minima dispersions of soybean pro¬ 
teins by altering the pH of salt solutions. 

The decreased dispersion of the protein of 
linseed oil meal in 6$ NaCl in this experiment, as com¬ 
pared with that reported in Experiment II, is attributed 
to the effects of three months* storage of the meal.

Smith and Circle (28) reported that the aging 
of soybean meal decreased the water-soluble nitrogen* 

This decrease was even greater with salt-soluble nitrogen. 

Alfalfa Leaf Meal 

The protein was extracted from 2-gram samples with 
three successive treatments of one-half hour duration on the 
mechanical shaker, using 100 ml. portions of the dispersing 
agent. 

Experiment I 

The dispersion of alfalfa leaf meal protein in 
various solvents: 

The concentrations of the neutral salt solutions 
were selected because they had given the maximum disper¬ 
sion obtainable with other proteins. Comparative results 
for distilled water, 6$ NaCl, 8$ sodium salicylate, 8$ 
potassium iodide, 0.5$ HC1, and 0.5$ NaOH are given in 
Table IX.

buted to the effects of three months 1 storage. 


Extraction with the Waring Blendor 

The Waring Blendor effects a very fine division of 
meals. Protein dispersion obtained using the Y/aring Blendor 
was compared with that obtained using the ball mill.

Material and Method 

Idabel peas and ether-extracted linseed oil 
meal were used. The protein was dispersed by two methods 

1. The meals were ball milled for six hours 
and the protein extracted in the usual manner by three 
successive half-hour treatments on the mechanical 
shaker. 

2. The peas were burr milled. The linseed 
meal was not ground further. The meal and the solvent 
were introduced into the Waring Blendor, and whipped for 
a period not exceeding six minutes until the meal was 
very finely divided. The mixture was transferred to cen¬ 
trifuge bottles and shaken for 25 minutes on the mechani¬ 
cal shaker. The mixtures were centrifuged for 10 
minutes at 2000 r.p.m. The supernatant liquid was 
poured off and the nitrogen content determined on an 
aliquot. Second and third extractions were made in the 
usual manner on the mechanical shaker. 

The quantities of materials used may be tabu-

The Waring Blendor showed two advantages: 

1. It eliminated the time-consuming operation 
of ball milling. 

2. It gave extraction values equal to, if not 
greater than, grinding with the ball mill. 

It had, however, several disadvantages: 

1. The solutions heated while the blendor was 
in operation. The longer the period of operation the 
higher the temperature rose. Headings up to 49°C. were 


recorded

2. The blades travelling at very high speeds 
caused extreme foaming in the solution. Foaming and 
denaturation of protein are directly related. 

3. Centrifuging the blended material was very 
difficult. Two possible explanations for this have been 
advanced. The particle size may be so reduced by blend¬ 
ing that the mixture approached a colloidal solution, or 
it may be that films of solvent were adsorbed to the 
surface of the particles, thereby lowering their speci¬ 
fic gravity.

THE ELECTRICAL TRANSPORT METHOD OF 
BASIC AMINO ACID ANALYSIS 


Literature Review and Discussion 


Proteins are a group of very complex chemical sub¬ 
stances* On hydrolysis they are characterized by the fact 
that they yield more than twenty alpha-amino acids. 

These alpha-amino acids can be divided into three 
groups: acidic, basic, or neutral, according to their reac¬ 
tion. The reaction is dependent upon the relative strength 
and number of the basic and acidic radicles present in the 
individual amino acid. The basic alpha-amino acids are 
arginine, lysine and histidine. Harrow (11) reports two 

others—ornithine and citrulline—which are related to argi- 

too st 

nine but are not considered as occurring naturally in plant 

A 

material. 

To date there have been developed five methods of 
separating the basic group from the remainder of the protein 
hydrolysate (3). Of these five, two have been adapted to the 
quantitative estimation of arginine, histidine, and lysine. 

The other three, as yet, are not satisfactory for the quanti¬ 
tative isolation of the group. 

Most of the early work on the basic amino acid con¬ 
tent of proteins was based on the use of phosphotungstic acid

as a precipitant for this group. It is not completely satis¬ 
factory, although it forms an integral part of the Van Slyke 
distribution method of analyzing proteins. As much as 50$ 
of the cystine present is also precipitated and this necessi¬ 
tates an additional analysis for sulphur. Mitchell and 
Hamilton (18) discussed the errors involved in the phospho- 
tungstic precipitation. These may be summarized as follows: 

1. Tryptophane, phenylalanine, and proline may 
form a comparatively insoluble phosphotungstate. 

2. Completeness of precipitation depends to a 
large extent upon the conditions of precipitation. 

3. Standard correction factors are not entirely 
satisfactory. The solubility of the bases may vary with their 
concentration. A correction comparatively small in magnitude 
may be quite large in proportion when the bases are present 

in small amounts. 

4. Nitrogen may be lost on decomposition of the 
precipitate. 

The second method is that of electrical transport. 
The first record of the use of an electric current to separate 
the amino acids into fractions is a U.S. patent taken out in 
1912 by Ikeda and Suzuki (8) for the electrical separation of 
glutamic acid. Foster and Schmidt (8, 9) found that, at pH 
5.5, a protein hydrolysate can be separated into three frac¬ 
tions by an electric current. The three baseswere carried to 
the cathode while the more acidic amino acids, aspartic,

glutamic, and hydroxy-glutamic acids were carried to the anode♦ 
The amino acids which are neutral in reaction were not affected. 
The method of electrical transport was found applicable to the 
preparation of pure arginine and lysine in relatively large 
quantities. 

Gox, King, and Berg (6) found the method, with modi¬ 
fications, to be almost entirely satisfactory for the indivi¬ 
dual isolation of arginine, histidine, and lysine, 

Albanese (1) improved upon the methods and the 
equipment used previously. He reported a method of determin¬ 
ing the basic amino acid content of protein hydrolysates, 
involving the quantitative transport by an electric current, 
of arginine, histidine, and lysine to the cathode. 

The work reported in the following section is an 
investigation of the efficiency of the electrolytic cell and 
of subsequent methods of analysis of the catholyte. 

Apparatus 


Description of the Electrolytic Cell 

The apparatus used was built in the laboratory and 
is similar to that used by Albanese (1). (Plates 1 and 2). 

The cell, made of birchwood, consists of three 
sections. All surfaces are water proofed with successive 
coats of spar varnish. In addition, the inner and adjoining

surfaces are coated with wax* The sections are separated by 
dissimilar membranes, and each resulting chamber has an 
approximate volume of 125 ml. Surfaces between sections are 
kept water-tight with rubber gaskets coated with a thin film 
of paraffin wax. Four long bolts hold the cell tightly 
together. Taps of rubber hose are used to drain the contents 
of the anode and cathode chambers. 

The use of dissimilar membranes is necessary to pre¬ 
vent endosmotic action. The anodic membrane is similar to that 
used by Albanese. Linen is coated with gelatin. The gelatin 
is subsequently hardened by soaking in 4 °/o formaldehyde solu¬ 
tion. The wet membrane is stretched tightly over a frame and 
allowed to dry. The cathodic membrane is cellophane dialysis 
paper. 

The cathode is 45-mesh platinum gauze, two inches by 
two inches, with wire edges. A two-inch post extends down 
the middle of the electrode. The anode is cut from one- 
quarter- inch sheet carbon, two inches by two and one-quarter 
inches. This arrangement has been found to be quite satisfac¬ 
tory, except that the carbon anode gradually disintegrates, 
necessitating frequent replacements. The particles of carbon 
become dispersed throughout the anode chamber and cover the 
membrane surface. In an attempt to overcome this, glazed 
brush carbon was tried. This electrode stood up for 15 to 20 
hours of operation. Once the outer glazed surface disintegrated 
the electrode wore away more rapidly than the carbon in regular

use. 

The solutions present in the cell heat when sub¬ 
jected to electrolysis. U-tubes containing running water 
(20°C.) are passed through the anode and cathode chambers to 
offset this. 

Stirring of the solutions in all three compartments 
is necessary to effect complete separation. This agitation is 
obtained in the anode compartment by the release of chlorine 
and in the cathode compartment by the release of hydrogen. 

The central compartment is stirred with a Cenco variable speed 
stirrer. 

The electrical circuit consists of a 100-watt lamp, 
a milliamp ammeter, and the cell electrodes connected in 
series to a 110-volt D.C. line (see Plate 2). 

Operation of the Electrolytic Cell 

The following procedure, based on that outlined by 
Albanese, was adopted: 

Hydrolysis 


A 1- to 2-gram sample of protein is hydrolyzed 
for 24 hours with 5 ml. per gram of 20% HOI (using all 
glass apparatus). The hydrolysate is diluted to 100 ml. 
in a volumetric flask and total N. is determined by the 
Kjeldahl procedure. An aliquot representing 0.5 to 1.0 
grams of protein is used for electrolysis.

Electrolytic Technique 

The anode and cathode compartments are filled 
with distilled water, the middle chamber being only half 
filled. The current is turned on and the sample is 
pipetted into the middle compartment, which is then 
filled with distilled water to the same level as the 
others. The completion of electrolysis is indicated by 
current drop as registered on the ammeter. 

The contents of the cathode compartment are 
then run into a 150-ml. beaker. The chamber is washed 
several times with distilled water and the washings 
added to the original catholyte. The current is now 
turned off. The contents of the anode and middle cham¬ 
ber are discarded. 

For complete separation of histidine, lysine, 
and arginine, the foregoing procedure must be carried 
out twice. The first separation eliminates HC1 by elec¬ 
trolysis, the hydrogen being released at the cathode, 
and the chlorine escaping at the anode. All but the 
more acidic of the amino acids are carried by electrical 
transport to the cathode. The transport of the basic 
amino acids alone is effected by the second separation 
at pH 5.5. This latter separation is essentially 
electrodialysis, since it is accompanied by no decompo¬ 
sition.

Electrolysis 

The current rises rapidly to 750 to 800 milli¬ 
amps shortly after the sample is introduced and it 
remains at this point for about six hours. At hourly 
intervals approximately half the contents of the anode 
chamber are removed and replaced by distilled water. 
Electrolysis is complete when the current drops to 100 
to 200 mi Hi amps. 

Dialysis 

The primary catholyte is adjusted to pH 5.6 to 
5.8 with dilute HgS04 using a potentiometer equipped with 
outside electrodes. This solution is introduced into 
the middle compartment as before. The current rises 
rapidly to about 450 to 500 milliamps and then drops 
slowly to 50 to 75 milliamps in about 45 minutes, when 
the dialysis is complete. 

Methods 

Nitrogen 

Nitrogen was determined by the modified Kjeldahi- 
Gunning-Arnold method, except where the micro-Kjeldahl method 
is specified. In the latter method, ammonia was caught in a 
2 % boric acid solution. The ammonia was titrated with N/100

HC1, using a mixed indicator of methyl red and methylene blue* 
(27, 31) 

Qualitative Tests 

The precipitation reaction of the basic amino acids 
with phosphotungstic acid was used as a general qualitative 
test. 

The diazo reaction, which is sensitive to one part 
of histidine in 300,000 and the Sakaguchi reaction, positive 
to one part of arginine in 2,500,000, were used as specific 
colorimetric tests (14, 35), 

The presence of ammonia was detected with Nessler f s 

reagent. 


Experimental Results 


The Efficiency of Electrical Transport 

Two experiments were made to determine the complete¬ 
ness of the transport and of the separation of the basic amino 
acids in the electrolytic cell. 

Experiment I 

The dialysis of arginine HCl: 

Samples of relatively high and low arginine 
content were dialyzed. The arginine was precipitated

with flavianic acid. A solubility correction for argi¬ 
nine monoflavianate of one gram arginine N per 100 ml. 
solution was applied. Three solutions containing 12.43 
mg., 20.70 mg., and 20.70 mg. arginine nitrogen were 
dialyzed. The percentage recoveries were 99.4$, 98.6$, 
and 100.5$, respectively. 

Experiment II 

The electrical transport of the basic (amino 
acid) nitrogen of an amino acid mixture: 

The mixture simulated a protein hydrolysate 
containing amino acids of all reaction types. A solu¬ 
tion containing 12.48 mg. N as glycine (neutral), 5.42 
mg. N as aspartic acid (acidic), 12.64 mg. N as argi¬ 
nine H01, 5.05 mg. N as lysine HG1, and 4.00 mg. N as 
histidine HC1 (all basic) was introduced into the cell. 
The electrolysis was complete in one hour; the dialysis 
in 25 minutes. The resulting catholyte contained 21.79 
and 21.87 (duplicate) mg. N as compared with the ori¬ 
ginal 21.74 mg. basic N. The percentage recoveries were 
therefore 100.2$ and 100.6$, respectively 

Qualitative tests were made during the trans¬ 
port of Sample I. Negative Sakaguchi, diazo, and phos- 
photungstic acid tests were obtained on the contents of 
the central and anode compartments at the completion of 
electrolysis and dialysis. The final catholyte tested

positive for each of the three reactions. 

This experiment indicates that the basic amino 
acids are transported quantitatively to the cathode 
chamber and that they may be effectively separated from 
a protein hydrolysate by electrical transport. 

Analysis of the Qatholyte Using Various Methods 

The current transports ammonia as well as the three 
basic amino acids to the cathode. Before any subsequent 
analysis may be made this ammonia must be removed by aerat¬ 
ing the catholyte. Ammonia-free air is drawn through the 
sample at 45°G. for one hour. Analyses have shown no loss of 
the basic amino acids by this procedure. Samples testing 
positive for ammonia with Nessler’s reagent were aerated. At 
the end of one hour no ammonia could be detected. 

Three methods of analysis were investigated. 

Method I 


The precipitation method as outlined by Alba- 

nese: 

Procedure - separation and determination of arginine 
To the second catholyte,nade acid to methyl red with 
dilute sulphuric acid and heated on the steam bath, 
is added flavianic acid solution (1:2 moles per mole 
of arginine expected). After 10 minutes the mixture

is allowed to cool to room temperature and stored 
in the ice box for several days. Arginine flavia- 
nate is filtered off, dried, and weighed, A 
solubility correction of 1.0 mg. of arginine nitro¬ 
gen per 100 ml. of solution is applied to all 
reported values. The arginine nitrogen value cal¬ 
culated from the monoflavianate (11.48$) is reported 
as percent of the total nitrogen of the protein. 

Electrical removal of flavianic acid: The filtrate 
after removal of arginine flavianate is introduced 
into the middle compartment of the cell. A drop of 
dilute sulphuric acid is added to each of the anode 
and cathode compartments to increase the initial 
conductivity. The flavianic acid then passes to 
the anode, histidine and lysine to the cathode. The 
time required is approximately one hour. The cur¬ 
rent rises rapidly to 400 milliamps and then slowly 
drops to 75 milliamps or lower. 

Histidine determination: The alkaline catholyte is 
made just acid to methyl red with dilute HC1. Satu¬ 
rated mercuric chloride is added (4 moles per mole 
of histidine expected). Dilute NaOH is added drop 
by drop until the red color of methyl red is dis¬ 
charged and a pinkish tinge (pH 6.8 to 7.0) appears 
with phenol red when a white flocculent precipitate

forms. The resulting mixture (about 100 ml.) is 
allowed to stand at room temperature for several 
hours, and is then centrifuged. 

The precipitate is washed twice with about 
10 ml. of water, dissolved in dilute HC1, made to 
volume and aliquots removed for micro-Kjeldahl 
determinations. The nitrogen content of the whole 
solution is estimated as histidine N, a percentage 
of the total N. 

Lysine determination: The supernatant fluid and wash¬ 
ings from the histidine determination are made to 
volume and nitrogen determined by the micro-Kjeldahl 
method. Total nitrogen of this fraction, less nitro¬ 
gen due to the solubility of the arginine flavianate, 
is estimated as lysine nitrogen. 

Experiment I - The analysis of a basic amino acid 
mixture: 

A solution containing 7.70 mg. N as lysine 
HC1, 19.98 mg. N as histidine HOI, and 20.54 mg. N 
as arginine HC1 was introduced into the cell. 

The dialysis time was sixty minutes. The 
catholyte was aerated and flavianic acid added. No 
arginine flavianate was precipitated in a period of 
five days. 

This test was repeated twice with similar 


results

Experiment II - The electrolysis of a gluten hydro¬ 
lysate: 

The gluten was washed from wheat flour 
using distilled water, and hydrolyzed with 20 % HC1 
for 24 hours. An aliquot of the hydrolysate, repre¬ 
senting 102.8 mgm. N was used. The electrolysis 
required 6f hours; the dialysis, 1 hour. 

The catholyte was aerated and flavianic 
acid added. No precipitate formed in a period of 
3 days. At the end of 5 days a few crystals were 
observed. These were of two types: (a) orange 
platelets; (b) yellow needles. The former fitted 
the description of arginine monoflavianate; the 
latter were obviously arginine diflavianate. 

Precipitation again was unsatisfactory. 

The poor results obtained may be due either to one 
or both of two factors: 

1. the pH adjustment using indicators 
was unsatisfactory; 

2. the precipitation was attempted from 
too dilute a solution with respect to arginine. 

A potentiometer equipped with outside 
electrodes later became available for use. The pH 
adjustments in the two following experiments were 
made using this apparatus.

Experiment III - The effect of pH on the precipita¬ 
tion of arginine flavianate: 

A solution of arginine HC1, containing 
7.98 mg. arginine nitrogen, was made basic with 
NaOH, so that the pH on addition of excess flavia- 
nic acid was 9.0. Final volume was 40 ml. The 
solution was gradually made acidic by the addition 
of dilute sulphuric acid. Arginine flavianate crys¬ 
tals formed immediately at a pH of 3.0. 

This procedure was repeated with a weaker 
concentration of arginine. The solution contained 
7.98 mg., arginine nitrogen in a final volume of 80 
ml. Arginine flavianate crystals appeared at a pH 
of 3.9. 

With a similar solution of arginine, contain¬ 
ing excess flavianic acid and adjusted with dilute 
sulphuric acid to pH 1.5, no precipitation of argin¬ 
ine flavianate occurred until the pH was raised to 
2.0 with dilute NaOH. 

These tests would indicate that arginine 
may be precipitated most readily as the monoflavia- 
nate in the pH range 2.0 to 3.0. 

Experiment IY - The analysis of an artificial protein 
hydrolysate: 

The artificial hydrolysate contained 1/5 


ml. HOI, 12.48 mg. of N as glycine and 5.42 mg. of N

and lysine were added as their HC1 salts in the 
quantities indicated in Table XII. 

The electrolysis was complete in 1^ hours 
the dialysis in 45 minutes. 

The catholyte was made acid to litmus and 
concentrated in vacuo to 20 ml. Arginine flavianate 
was precipitated at a pH of 2.8. Recoveries of all 
fractions, as given in Table XII, are excellent.

pH is adjusted to 6.8 to 7.0, using dilute NaOH. 
After standing several hours, the mixture is cen¬ 
trifuged. The supernatant liquid is poured off, 
and the precipitate is washed with two successive 
10-ml. portions of water. 

The histidine precipitate is dissolved 
with dilute HOI and made up to volume. The nitrogen 
is determined by the micro-Kjeldahl method. The 
filtrate and washings are combined and made up to 
volume. Two determinations are made: (1) Total N 
is determined by the micro-Kjeldahl method; 

(2) Arginine N is determined by the direct method 
of Plimmer and Bosedale (22). The preliminary step 
of alkaline aeration is not necessary, since no 
amide N is present. 

Total N - Arginine N = Lysine N. 

Experiment I - The analysis of a basic amino acid 
mixture: 

The original solution contained 19.94 mg. 
of N as arginine HOI, 15.46 mg. of N as histidine 
HC1, and 7.65 mg. of N as lysine HC1. Electrical 
transport was completed in 35 minutes. Subsequent 
analysis showed the catholyte contained 19.58 mg, of 
arginine N, 13.34 mg. of histidine N, and 7.53 mg. 
of lysine N. The recoveries were therefore 98.2$,

sample was shown, by Method III, to contain 18.96$ 
arginine N and 3.72$ histidine N. 

Discussion 

The excellent results obtained in Experi¬ 
ment I can be explained only by chance precipitation. 
The other results indicate that arginine is also 
precipitated by mercuric chloride in the histidine 
fraction. To obtain specific precipitation of his¬ 
tidine the pH of the solution must be exact. It can 
be demonstrated that mercuric chloride will preci¬ 
pitate arginine in an acid solution. Application of 
this method as a standard procedure is too unsatis¬ 
factory when indicators are the only available means 
of pH adjustment. Further work with this method is 
contemplated; the intention is to use the pH meter 
to regulate acidity. 

Method III 

This is an application of the Van Slyke nitrogen 
distribution method of protein analysis (18). 

Procedure - The aerated catholyte is made up to a volume 
of 200 mlo The following determinations are then made: 

1. Total nitrogen is determined on 10-ml. aliquots by 
the micro-Kjeldahl method.

2. Arginine nitrogen is determined by the method of 
Plimmer and Rosedale on a 100-ml. aliquot (22). 

3. Amino nitrogen is determined on 4-ml. aliquots by 
the Van Slyke method (34). 

The values of histidine nitrogen and lysine 
nitrogen may be calculated by the following equations: 
Total N = arginine N + histidine N + lysine N 
Amino N = 1/4 arginine N + 1/3 histidine N + 

lysine N 

Non-amino N - 3/4 arginine N v 2/3 histidine N. 

Experiment I - The analysis of an artificial pro¬ 
tein hydrolysate: 

The solution contained 1/5 ml. of HCl t 
4 f 00 mg. of histidine N, 12.69 mg. of arginine N, 
5.05 mg. of lysine N, 5.42 mg. of aspartic acid N, 
and 12.48 mg. of glycine N, The electrolysis was 
complete in lj hours; the dialysis in 25 minutes. 

Two such solutions were electrolyzed. The catholyt© 
from the first was concentrated under reduced pres¬ 
sure at 45°C. to a volume of 50 ml. The second 
catholyte was aerated for one hour at 45°0. 

The analytical results obtained are sum¬ 


marized in Table XIII

Excellent recovery of total basic nitrogen 
and of arginine nitrogen was obtained with both 
samples. The distribution of nitrogen between 
lysine and histidine depends upon the accuracy of 
the amino nitrogen determination. This was very 
unsatisfactory with Sample 1. Better results were 
obtained with Sample 2. 

The results showed that the accuracy of 
this method of analysis is limited by the accuracy 
of the amino nitrogen analyses. If the latter are 
inaccurate the percentages of both histidine and 
lysine are unreliable. 

This experiment also demonstrated that 
basic nitrogen was not lost from the alkaline 
catholyte either by aerating or by concentrating 
under reduced pressure at 45°G.

Experiment II - The analysis of gelatin hydroly¬ 
sates: 

Duplicate samples of gelatin were hydro¬ 
lyzed 24 hours with 20$ HC1. The humin was filtered 
off, and the hydrolysates were made to volume. 

Humin and hydrolysate fractions were analyzed for 
nitrogen. 

Two aliquots of hydrolysate A, each repre¬ 
senting 152.2 mg. nitrogen, and one of hydrolysate 
B, representing 155.5 mg. nitrogen, were analyzed. 
The duration of the electrolysis was hours and 
of the dialysis 35 minutes for each of the three 
samples. Table XIV summarizes the results. All 
calculations were made on the basis: total N * 
humin N + hydrolysate N.

The error between internal duplicates 
was smaller than the error between external dupli¬ 
cates. The latter difference was approximately 
proportional to the difference between hydrolysates 
in percentage humin nitrogen. The histidine N + 
lysine N fractions were in close agreement. The 
error in the distribution of nitrogen between his¬ 
tidine and lysine was due to the inaccuracies of 
the amino nitrogen analyses. 

The amounts of the three basic amino acids 
present were similar to the results obtained with 
gelatin by other investigators. 

Experiment III - The estimation of the arginine 
content of protein hydrolysates by alkaline hydro¬ 
lysis: 

Comparative estimations were made of the 
arginine content of protein hydrolysates by the 
alkaline hydrolysis method of Plimmer and Rosedale 

(1) Directly on the hydrolysate (22). 

(2) On the aerated catholyte obtained by electrical 
separation of the hydrolysate. No preliminary 
aeration was necessary to eliminate amide nitrogen. 

Table XV illustrates the uniformity of the 
results obtained. Analyses by the second procedure 
tended to be slightly higher. These results pro¬ 
vided an excellent check on the quantitative trans-

THE BASIC AMINO ACID CONTENT OP 
SOME PLANT PROTEINS 


Literature Review and Discussion 


Our knowledge of amino acids and of their role in 
animal nutrition is of recent origin. The vital importance 
of feed proteins to the animal has, however, been recognized 
for at least 150 years. The conclusions reached by early 
investigators were reviewed by Block and Bolling (4). 

Francois Magendie (1783-1855), on the basis of 
livestock feeding exp eriments, deduced that the nitrogen of 
the tissues is derived from food nitrogen. The nutritive 
importance of proteins and the dependence of animals on 
plants for these substances were pointed out by G. J. Mulder, 
a Dutch chemist, around 1840. The concept that the protein 
or nutritive value of a feed could be estimated from the 
nitrogen content alone appears to have originated with the 
studies of Boussingault. Leibig supported this hypothesis. 

He stated in 1851 that vegetable and animal products contained 
more or less identical protein substances. This view remained 
dominant until 1897, when Rubner recognized that proteins of 
varying origin had different biological values. Variations 
in the amino acid composition of different proteins supported 
this theory.

By 1915, Osborne and Mendel (4) had shown that 
tryptophane and lysine were indispensable amino acids. Rose 
(25) specified all the amino acids required for normal growth 
in the albino rat. Lysine and histidine are both essential; 
arginine is semi-indispensable. Recent experiments by Holt 
and Albanese (13) have shown this same group, with the excep¬ 
tion of histidine, to be necessary for human nutrition. His¬ 
tidine deficiency has no effect on the nitrogen balance in 
man, but a urinary chromogen appears where this amino acid is 
lacking. Arginine is synthesized by humans and certain rodents 
but at a rate which does not allow normal sperm production or 
normal growth (13, 4). In the case of the chick it is an 
essential amino acid since it cannot be synthesized at all, 
or only in insufficient amounts (12, 16). 

Concurrent with these biological investigations, 
analytical procedures were developed to determine the amino 
acid content of proteins. These procedures have proven 
reasonably accurate on purified proteins, but often failed 
badly when applied to natural foods. Mitchell and Hamilton 
(18) summarized the results obtained on the mixed proteins of 
feeds, using the Van Slyke method of protein analysis. 

Despite the obvious inaccuracies of the procedure, particularly 
on this type of material, the results are valuable. Linseed 
meal protein was reported to contain 7.9$ arginine, 3.6$ 
histidine, and 3.1$ lysine; soybean protein was reported to 
contain 7.8$ arginine, 3.3$ histidine, and 5.2$ lysine; and

alfalfa hay protein was reported to contain 4.4# arginine, 

2.3# histidine, and 3.7# lysine. 

Procedures based on the isolation of the individual 
amino acids by precipitation have gradually displaced the 
Van Slyke method of analysis. These have proven unsatisfactory 
when applied to whole feeds. The problem of the purification 
of these materials has been solved in part by treatment with 
acids, alkalis, or enzymes. Block and Bolling (4) analyzed 
purified materials and reported that linseed protein contained 
6.2# arginine, 1.2# histidine, and 2.5# lysine; and that soy¬ 
bean protein contained 5.8# arginine, 2.3# histidine, and 5.4# 
lysine. 

Tristram (33) analyzed "ether water" protein ex¬ 
tracts of the fresh leaves of plants and found that the basic 
amino acid analysis of leaf proteins exhibit very little 
variation from species to species or within a species in one 
season. Lucerne leaf protein contained 7.5# arginine, 1.4# 
histidine, and 5.8# lysine. 

It is quite evident that the amino acid content of 
plant seeds varies among species. The proteins of the seeds 
and of the leaves of legumes have a higher lysine content 
than the proteins of flaxseed and of the cereals. The arginine 
content of the legume and flaxseed proteins is moderately 
high, while the histidine content is low. 

Rigby (24) reported varying amounts of the sulphur- 


containing amino acids in wheat gluten owing to different

fertilizer treatments. Alten and Haupt (2) found that the 
tryptophane content of oat straw and English rye grass decreased 
with increased application of K g Q; tyrosine in oat straw was 
little affected by the fertilization; arginine in grass was 
depressed and in oat straw increased as the K g 0 supply was 
increased. The possibility exists that just as the protein 
content of seeds may vary with environmental conditions so 
may the amino acid composition of these mixed proteins. 

The work reported in the following section was 
undertaken with two objects in view: 

1. To report the basic amino acid content of the 
proteins of pea meal, alfalfa leaf meal, linseed oil meal, and 
soybean meal. 

2. To determine to what extent varietal and environ¬ 
mental factors affeet the basic amino acid content of the pro¬ 
teins of pea meal. 

These two phases of the work are referred to in the 
following report as Series 1 and Series 2, respectively. 

Materials 

Series 1 

Idabel field peas, Agate soybeans, commercial 
linseed oil meal, and Ferax alfalfa were analyzed. The 
alfalfa was 60$ in bloom at the time of picking. All 
samples were coarsely ground in a Wiley mill and then

finely ground in a ball mill. The linseed oil meal was 
extracted with ether to remove the oil. The meals were 
stored in bottles. 

Series 2 


Chancellor and Early Blue field peas were 
obtained from Department of Plant Science experimental 
plots at Sundre, Edmonton, and Athabaska. These stations 
represent a diversity of climatic and soil conditions. 
Sundre and Athabaska are in grey wooded soil areas and 
Edmonton is in the black soil area. The samples were 
ground in a burr mill and stored. 

Methods 

Extraction 

The alfalfa meal protein was extracted with 
100 ml. of &fo KI per 2 grams of sample; the pea meal 
protein with 50 ml. of 3 9 /o Nad per 6 grams of sample; 
the linseed oil meal protein with 100 ml. of 6$ NaCl per 
Z grams of sample; and the soybean meal protein with 100 
ml. of distilled water per 2.5 grams of sample. The 
dispersion of Series 1 meals was aided by one-half hour 
shaking on the mechanical shaker; that of Series 2 meals 
by five minutes in the Waring Blendor and 25 minutes 
intermittent standing and shaking. The mixtures in both

cases were centrifuged for 10 minutes at 2000 r.p.m. 
and the supernatant liquid decanted. The volume of 
liquid was measured and the nitrogen content determined. 
Total soluble nitrogen was calculated on the assumption 
that the solvent not recovered contained proportionally 
the same amount of nitrogen as the recovered fraction. 
This has been shown to give results quite comparable to 
those obtained by exhaustive extraction. Table XVI com¬ 
pares the calculated total extraction of protein with the 
actual total extraction of protein obtained with various 
meals.

with running water. Removal of the salt is necessary for 
satisfactory operation of the electrolytic cell. 

Hydrolysis 


The protein suspensions were now dried in 
evaporating dishes on the steam bath. The dry material 
was finely ground with a mortar and pestle. Duplicate 
samples were hydrolyzed for 24 hours with 5 ml. of 20$ 
HC1 per gram of material. An all-glass apparatus was 
used. 

Analysis 

The hydrolyzed sample was diluted with water, 
filtered, and the humin precipitate washed with hot 
water. The filtrate was made up to 100 ml. in a volu¬ 
metric flask. Nitrogen in the hydrolysate and in the 
precipitate was determined. 

The basic amino acids of an aliquot of the 
hydrolysate equivalent to J to 1 gram of protein were 
separated by electrolytic transport. The catholyte was 
analyzed by the nitrogen distribution method as out¬ 
lined previously (Method III). 

All other nitrogen determinations were made 
using the modified Kjeldahl method with mercuric oxide 
as catalyst.

Calculations 

Total N = humin N + hydrolysate N. 

The percentages of the individual amino acids 
were determined on the basis, Total N = humin N + hydro¬ 
lysate N. The following factors used for conversion were 
calculated on the basis of N x 6.25 = protein: 

$ arginine N x 0.497 = $ arginine 
$ histidine N x 0.590 = $ histidine 
$ lysine N x 0.834 * $ lysine. 

Experimental Results 

The humin nitrogen ranged from 1.1$ to 4.0$ indicat¬ 
ing that the protein extracts contained varying amounts of 
carbohydrate material. A consistently low humin nitrogen con¬ 
tent is necessary for accurate analytical work with the amino 
acids. Large errors between duplicates were encountered in 
the histidine and lysine estimations. These inaccuracies can 
be traced partially to the differences between duplicates in 
the total basic nitrogen. In some instances the lysine values 
showed an inverse relationship to the histidine estimations. 
This indicated inaccurate amino nitrogen determinations.

Series 1 - Results are presented in Table XVII. 

High extractions of the proteins of the pea 
and the soybean meals were obtained. The protein extracted 
from linseed oil meal and alfalfa meal cannot be con¬ 
sidered representative of the total protein in the two 
meals, but since higher extractions could not be obtained 
this protein was used in analysis. 

The total basic nitrogen content of the pea 
protein was definitely higher than that of the other 
plant proteins. The legume seed proteins contained more 
lysine than the other plant proteins. All the proteins 
contained small amounts of histidine and relatively large 
amounts of arginine. 

Analyses were made on the whole meals of alfalfa 
and linseed. The electrical separation of the hydrolysates 
proved very unsatisfactory, particularly for the alfalfa 
meal. The results obtained on the oil-free linseed oil 
meal are included in Table XVII. A higher content of 
each of the three basic amino acids was obtained in the 
mixed proteins of the whole meal than in the proteins 
extracted by 6% sodium chloride. 

The general relationship of these results is 
comparable to that indicated by other investigators, 
although both the arginine and the lysine results appear 
to be somewhat higher.

Series 2 - Results are presented in Table XVTII 

Higher protein extractions were obtained from all 
the meals. The extraction of the Chancellor, Sundre, 
sample was definitely lower than the others, but was quite 
acceptable. At any one station, higher extractions were 
obtained from the Early Blue samples than from the Chan¬ 
cellor samples. 

The protein content varied as expected, over a 
wide range. The extremely low protein content of the 
Athabaska samples may be due to the lack of nodulation 
on the roots of the plants. 

Disregarding the Athabaska Early Blue sample, 
the results form one general pattern. No varietal dif¬ 
ferences were found. The histidine content of the pro¬ 
teins of the Edmonton meals was significantly higher 
than the histidine content of the proteins of the other 
meals. This difference in the histidine content almost 
entirely accounted for the higher total basic nitrogen 
reported for the proteins of the Edmonton meals. The 
arginine content of the proteins of all meals was remark¬ 
ably uniform. The lysine content of the protein of the 
Edmonton meals was approximately 10$ lower than that 
reported for the proteins of the Sundre and Athabaska 
meals. 

The Athabaska Early Blue sample gave unusual 
results. The total basic nitrogen was the lowest of any

sample. Both the arginine and lysine values were abnor¬ 
mally low. Conversely, relatively high amounts of 
histidine were present. These results indicate the pos¬ 
sibility of unusual environmental factors during growth. 
It is possible, however, that some unaccounted for error 
operated with this sample. 

Gortner i/0) states that in the event that non¬ 
protein nitrogenous compounds are present, any method of 
analysis based upon a nitrogen determination will not 
necessarily yield accurate values for any particular 
amino acid. Various nitrogenous bases, such as the 
betaines choline and guanidine are found in plants. The 
garden pea contains the betaine trigonelline. The 
legumes as a family are noteworthy for their alkaloida! 
content. It may be that these high histidine values were 
due to the presence of some one or more nitrogenous 
bases. Despite this, the fact remains that the Edmonton 
samples are significantly higher in some one or more 
nitrogenous compounds. It is interesting to note in 
this connection that the alkaloidal content of plants 
may be varied by the use of nitrogen and phosphorus fer¬ 
tilizers (/4>). 

Further work is necessary to determine whether 
the variability in histidine is real or whether some 
other factor is responsible for the apparent difference. 
More direct methods of analysis would be preferable and 
are under investigation.

SUMMARY 


The work involved in this research is reported in 
three sections: 

I. The dispersion in various solvents of the proteins of pea 
meal, commercial linseed-'oil meal, and alfalfa leaf meal was 
studied. 

1. Maximum dispersion of over 90$ of the protein 
of pea meal was obtained in distilled water and in 3$ 
and 4$ concentrations of solutions of sodium chloride, 
sodium salicylate, and sodium sulphate. Dispersion of 
the protein of pea meal was depressed in 1$ concentra¬ 
tions of these salts. 

2. Dispersion of 62.4$ of the protein of alfalfa 
leaf meal was obtained in 8$ potassium iodide; disper¬ 
sion of 76.8$ of the protein of "oil-free" linseed oil 
meal was obtained in 8$ sodium salicylate. 

3. Dispersion of the proteins of alfalfa leaf 
meal and linseed oil meal in 6$ sodium chloride was 
little affected by the acidity of the solvent. 

4. The Waring Blendor proved only partially satis¬ 
factory as an aid to protein dispersion. 

II. An investigation of the electrical transport method of 
basic amino acid analysis was made. 

1. An electrolytic cell, built in the laboratory,

quantitatively separated the basic amino acids from the 
other constituents of an artificial protein hydrolysate. 

2. The catholyte obtained by electrical separation 
was analyzed for arginine, histidine, and lysine by three 
methods of analysis. Further work on these methods is 
contemplated. 

III. The basic amino acid content of some plant proteins was 
determined. 

1. Protein extracts of pea meal, linseed oil meal, 
alfalfa leaf meal, and soybean meal were analyzed. The 
legume seed proteins were relatively higher in lysine. 

All proteins were low in histidine and relatively high 
in arginine. 

2. Protein extracts of the pea meals of two 
varieties, Early Blue and Chancellor, from three stations, 
Edmonton, Sundre, and Athabaska, were analyzed. No 
varietal differences were found. The arginine and lysine 
contents were fairly uniform throughout, but Edmonton- 
grown samples contained a much larger histidine fraction. 
The question as to whether this difference in histidine 
content is real or can be attributed to the presence of 
nitrogenous bases presents an interesting problem.
