ABSTRACT 


The purpose of this study was to determine, by the case- 
study method, the structure of the adolescent peer group and 
the factors that influence the behavior of its members. The 
specific group studied was made up of the nine boys of the 
grade eleven class of Brooks High School. 

To secure information on the structure of the group, 
the following tests were used: The Sociometric Test, the 
Guess Who Test, The Classroom Social Distance Scale, The 
Sims SCI Occupational Rating Scale and the Sims Score Card 
for Socio-Economic Status. 

For data concerning the members of the group, the 
following tests were administered: The Gordon Personal 
Profile; The Thurstone Temperament Schedule; The Guilford- 
Zimmennan Temperament Survey; The Rotter Incomplete Sentences 
Blank; The SRA Youth Inventory; The Kuder Preference Record, 
Vocational; and the Otis Quick-Scoring Test of Mental 
Ability, Gamma Test. 

In addition, autobiographies, cumulative records and. 
interviews with students, parents, teachers and key members 
of the community were utilized*

These data were analyzed to determine the structure of 
the group. Friends, popular persons, leaders, followers and 
isolates were studied to establish the behavior traits 
associated with these roles. Major factors influencing the 
behavior of the members of the group were determined. One 
of the most important of these appeared to be the desire to 
gain acceptance in the group. To do this it appeared that a 
boy must gain recognition from the key members, share similar 
interests, be available and eager for participation in group 
activities, conform to group standards and be near the average 
age of the group. The roles assumed by the individual in the 
group also had an effect on his status, since the members 
associated certain traits with the positions of leader, 
follower, popular person and friend. 

The increasing importance of heterosexual social activi¬ 
ties seemed to exert pressure on the members of the group, 
for they found it necessary to get along, not only with the 
boys, but with the girls who entered increasingly into their 
activities. The students who came to school by van were not 
readily taken into the social groups of the school and so 
tended to form close associations among themselves. 

CXitside the group, the home and the school appeared to 
exert considerable influence on the behavior of the members. 
Most of the bo5^s indicated satisfaction with their home 
life. VJhere these conditions did not exist, attitudes of 
extreme independence and hostility were apparent. Undue 
emphasis on academic success by their parents was reflected 
in feelings of insecurity of two of the boys in the group.

Their fail;ire to realize in school the expectations of the home 
seemed a fundamental cause of adjustment difficulties in other 
areas. The boys felt that the teachers influenced their behavior 
through the examples that they gave and through the guidance they 
provided, particularly in the vocational field*

THE NATURE OF ADOLESCENCE 


Adolescence is a period of develojaaent in which the 
individual matures pl^sically and learns of the modes of 
conduct characteristic of an adult in our society* Is/hile 
these changes take place over several years, it is difficult 
to state a specific age at which one enters adolescence or 
attains full maturity, because of individual differences in 
the rate of development* For this reason the period may be 
thought of as being «***bounded on the one side by childhood 
and on the other by adulthood or maturity* It is therefore 
a period of transition *” ^ 

A more comprehensive description is given by Hiarlock: 

• *»¥e may consider adolescence as the period in the 
individual’s life when sexual maturing takes place* However 
maturing involves not only physical but also mental growth*. 
Because mental growth does not reach its con^letion until 
later than physical, it is customary at the present time 
to extend the period of adolescence to allow for the attain¬ 
ment of mental maturity* 


^A.A. Schneiders, The Psychology of Adolescence * Milwaukee, 
The Bruce Publishing Company, 1951,"*p*

Accompanying mental maturity, it is justifiable to expect 
that social and emotional maturity will be attained*..♦Thus, 
the transition period between childhood and maturity must be 
even further lengthened*^ 

As a guide, the following may be accepted as the average 
developmental schedule for this period: preadolescence, 
ten to twelve years; early adolescence, thirteen to fifteen 
years; middle adolescence, sixteen to eighteen years; late 
adolescence, nineteen to twenty-one years*3 

As individuals grow from childhood to maturity, they face 
five major tasks: 

••• (a) adjusting to their changing physical growth and 
development, (b) gaining emancipation from adult control, 

(c) adjusting to the opposite sex, (d) choosing and pre¬ 
paring for a life job, (e) finding a philosophy which gives 
meaning and purpose to life*^ 

Adolescents must have certain fundamental needs satis¬ 
fied by some means if adequate adjustments are to be made* 
Laycock suggests that these needs are of two types, physio¬ 
logical needs, such as food, drinlc, rest, sleep and activity, 
and psychological needs, such as affection, belonging, 
independence, achievement, approval, self-esteem, and under¬ 
standing and e^qjlaining the world about one*5 

It would seem then, that in completing the tasks outlined 
above, adolescents will satisfy their fundamental human needs*

In the transition from childhood to adulthood, socially accepted 
methods of meeting these demands must be developed by the 
individual if maturity is to be attained* 

Caught, as it were, between childhood and adulthood, the 
adolescent is frequently at a loss to determine the type of 
behavior expected of him in various situations* Nor do adults 
offer much in the way of assistance* The adolescent is ex¬ 
cluded from many activities on the grounds that he is "too 
young" to do such things and on other occasions he is admonished 
for "acting like a child"* It is not surprising that this 
significant period of development is often one of turmoil* 

Confused about their role and function in society and 
lacking a definite place in the scheme of things, yoimg people 
turn to their own peers, or equals, for guidance, protection 
and support*.** In close personal relations with their 
contemporaries they can satisfy their needs for security, for 
belonging and for status, while gradually trying to free 
themselves from dependence upon their families*^ 

Peer groups are "*..aggregations composed of yoimgsters 
of approximately the same age level* Some characteristics 
of the adolescent peer group are presented by Garrison: 

Studies of Social Psychology and Sociology show that in 
our society a sort of subculture operates among boys and girls. 
...The culture operating in these adolescent groups is similar

to that foimd in adult societies, but with the emotions and mental 
iinniaturity of younger children commonly manifested* These groups 
have their own standards, values, purposes, and methods of 
protecting themselves from too much adult interference. They 
use the methods found in adult society for securing conformity... 
The group remains somewhat constant for a number of years during 
the growing life of the adolescent. New members are continuously 
being admitted from the younger group, while older ones drop 
out for one reason or another.^ 

For complete understanding, adolescents should be viewed 
as members of this sub-culture. The standards of behavior of 
the peer group differ markedly from adult standards and 
warrant careful study. 

...The key to understanding of adolescence is to be found, 
then, in an understanding of the processes by which adjustments 
are made....There must be understanding of the motives and 
desires characterizing those of adolescent age, an understanding 
of the circumstances which prevent full satisfaction of their 
needs, and an understanding of the kinds of reactions which 
typify adolescents (and people in general) when they are imable 
to achieve their goals and satisfy their desires.9 

Since adolescence is a more or less difficult period of 
adjustment, it is important that adults attempt to understand 
adolescent behavior more fully and be prepared to assist those 
who find the transition too trying. 

It is rather amazing that so many boys and girls in our 
society do achieve identification with our cultural values 
and purposes in late adolescence, since we have so little use 
for children or youth in our economy and so few effective, 
widely recognized ways of inducting them into our society. 10 

The period of adolescence, is an important stage in the 
development of the individual. For a complete understanding

of the matxiration of the adolescent and his means of satisfying 
fundamental needs during this period, it is necessary to examine 
him in his own society. Through activities with his peers 
he becomes acquainted with socially accepted modes of conduct 
and generally is fitted for his life in adult society. Since 
the sub-culture is so significant to the adolescent, insight 
into this * period of development may be gained by viewing the 
individual as his fellows see him, that is, in his daily 
activities in the peer group.

CHAPTER II 


THE NATURE OF ADOLESCENT GROUPS 
Adolescent Groups 

During the adolescent years the individual often feels 
confused about his ^ole in society. Adults are not always 
consistent in their behavior toward him. He himself is aware 
of conflicting childish and adult desires, but finds himself 
out of place in both child and adult groups. The only 
situation in which the adolescent is on a level with his 
associates is in his peer group. 

... Next to the family in childhood, and probably equally with 
the family during adolescence, the peer group provides satis¬ 
factions to the basic urges for security in the warmth of 
friendship and the sense of adequacy that comes with belong¬ 
ing.^ 

In the adolescent period physical and intellectual 
growth takes place normally, provided that the fundamental 
needs are satisfied and the individual experiences normal

family life. The more pressing problems at this stage lie in 
the areas of social and emotional development. These problems 
may be studied in the peer group as the adolescent experiments 
with social situations. 

Social consciousness is very marked during the adolescent 
years. The adolescent wants not only group approval, but also 
approval from the other sex...Preoccupation with social 
activities and desire to win social approval are so great in 
the middle and latter part of adolescence that they color the 
adolescent's outlook on life and influence every aspect of 

his behavior.12 

In his social affairs, the adolescent may belong to several 
distinct groups. Wattenberg^^ suggests that there are five 
types: friendships, informal play groups, organized youth 
groups, gangs and secret clubs. Cole^ indicates that the 
crowd is of greater significance in the social development 
of adolescents than is the pre-adolescent gang. A group 
smaller than the crowd and called a clique, may be added to 
this list. 

Friendships, cliques and croifds seem to be the most 
significant groups in the development of social and emotional 
maturity during adolescence. The characteristics of these 
peer groups are wortl^ of note.

Friendships 


The smallest of all peer groups is the pairing off of two 
youngsters who become fast friends. The evidence would indicate 
that friends usually are likely to be similar to each other in 
personality and terr^^erament...Once in a while, one encounters a 
master-and-slave, or a hero-and-worshipper arrangement.^5 

Further findings on the nature of adolescent friendships 
are given by Cole: 

...Close friendships us\ially develop between adolescents who 
have similar social and economic backgrounds and similar 
intellectual and non-intellectual interests. Friends are 
sometimes of similar ability and sometimes not. Often one is 
more dominant than the other...There is no correlation in the 
personal traits of adolescents and only a low correlation in 

attitudes. 

In confirmation of these ideas, a stuc^ by Gesell, Ilg 
and Ames reveals that ”...boys cultivate their boy friends on 
the basis of mutual interest in activities, sports or special 
undertakings.” 17 

Although the significance of common interests seems to be 
generally accepted, psychologists do not agree on the importance 
of personal traits in the formation of friendships. It seems 
that further study is needed in this area, to clarify the 
matter.

Rimner suggests the following classification for adolescent 
friendships based on the degree of social distance that exists 
in the relationships between friends 

1. The Confidante - an almost inseparable friend in whom the 
individual confides his hopes, fears, successes, and 
failures*.. 

The Intimate - a close friend. Conscious selection is not 
as important as frequency of contact.♦. 

3. The Familiar - a friend who is seen often, but for whom one 
feels little emotional warmth. 

It. The Acquaintance - a person barely knovm. 

5. The Active Group-acquaintance - a person with whom one works 

in a ^oup, but does not know otherwise. 

6. The Passive Group-acquaintance - a person who attends the same 

^oup meetings but takes ho part. 

7. The Spectator - a person knoivn by name, with whom one has 

never spoken. 

Cliques . The term clique refers to “...small exclusive 
social groups. They are generally made up of three or more 
individuals of similar interests and among whom there is a 
strong bond of mutual admiration and affection. They are 
composed of... * intimates* or close friends.** 19 

Crowd . The adolescent crowd is **...typically composed 
of both boys and girls, preferably an equal number of each, and 
its unconscious objective is the establishment of normal social 
relationships between the two sexes.** 20 
According to Hurlocks 

The crowd is the largest of the social units formed by 
adolescents. It is composed of a group of individuals selected

because of mutual interests, likes, dislikes and social ideals* 
It is not a spontaneously formed group*••The members of a 
crowd are selected because they fit. Within a crowd, in spite 
of the homogeneity of interests, there is social distance. 

Not all members of the crowd are on equally intimate terms of 
friendship*••The crowd is like the clique in that it is an 
* exclusive* social unit.21 

Crowds vary according to the functions they are to perform. 
Dimock suggests the foUoidng varieties of adolescent crowds: 

1. Special-interest groups are those that pursue a single 

activity such as dramatics, basketball,... 

2. Clubs usually have some form of organization and frequently 

a program that is inclusive of many types of activity* 

3* Purpose groups are clubs that exist primarily to carry out 
some purpose of an idealistic or altruistic nature* 
i^* Natural or neighborhood group ...exists in the community 
apart from the influence of any agency or institution* 

5. Fabricated groups are those formed by some agency such as 
the church, the Y.M.C.A., ** .school or the Boy Scouts... 22 

Some of the values of participation in the activities of 

the crowd are summarized by Cole: 

...experience in getting on with other people, experience in 
social skills, development of loyalty to a group, practice in 
judging people, and experience in love-making under circum¬ 
stances in which the participants are protected from serious 
consequences...Negative training was the development of 
antagonism toward other crowds than that to ^diich the indi¬ 
vidual belongs. For the most part then, the crowd is a socially 
valuable unit of adolescent society and probably does more to 
bring about normal social growth than teachers and parents 
combined.23 


Adolescent Roles 

Within any adolescent group the individual has one or more 
roles to play which indicate his position in the social structure.

Prom his observations, Wattenberg presents the following roles 
coirmionlj»- found in adolescent society: leaders, followers, 
idea-men, wits, clowns, * slaves', and stooges* As one goes 
down the list the prestige value lessens* Those near the 
bottom are hangers-on, satisfying their fundamental needs 
through identification with the group* They are willing to 
do menial chores and be the butt of jokes in the hope of 
eventually becoming members in their own right* 

Leadership * Of the roles mentioned, much has been written 
on leaders and leadership* Since these people are most 
influential in adolescent society, it is in^jortant to under¬ 
stand their behavior* Some general characteristics of leaders 
are stated by Cole: 

***The leaders appear to excel their fellow students more or 
less in many mental, social and physical traits* They are 
usually more intelligent than the average, they get better 
marks, they are taller and heavier, they are in better health, 
they are a bit older than the average, they come from a 
slightly higher socioeconomic background and their social 
adjustment is better* These characteristics apply**.to 
leaders as a groupj not all of them are true of any individual 

leader*25 

Although leadership traits are more or less constant 
within the individxial, the position of leaders within the 
groups may change from time to time* A person may be a 
leader in one activity but have another role when activities 
change*

Followers « Follows may be divided into four types: 

!• The Constructive Follower « He has potential ability in 
leadership and is jnot afraid of responsibility..* 

2. The Routine Follower . He is a willing worker...but lacking 

in initiative. 

3. The Impulsive Follower . This form of followership is 

essentially emotional and the relation to the leader is 
a personal one... 

ii. The Subversive Follower . He is governed chiefly by self- 
interest and simxilates successfully the genuine interest 
which characterizes the constructive follower. 

Isolates . In the analysis of any large group of adolescents 
it is usually found that some individuals are left out of peer 
group activities. They have no role. They have no friends 
within the group, appear generally unpopular and may be actively 
rejected by its members. Such persons are sometimes termed 
isolates. It is possible that these persons are satisfying 
their f\mdamental needs in groups other than the one examined, 
in which case the isolation may be considered limited and not 
too important. On the other hand, there is general agreement 
that an isolated individual is faced with tremendous problems 
in social and emotional adjustment if he cannot fit into the 
adolescent sub-culture in some way. 

Hurlock suggests the following reasons for socieQ. isola¬ 
tion: unattractive appearance, physical handicaps, too marked 
differences from the group, geographic isolation, feelings of 
insecurity, too much absorption in self, domineering or resent¬ 
ful attitude toward his peers, bad reputation, constant shifts 
from one community to another, parents who do not want the

having little in common* 

Lindgren^® also mentions that isolates usually are socially 
and amotionally immature* They may be shy, withdrawn individuals 
or belong to an ‘*out” group* 

Whatever the causes may be, the effect on social and 
emotional development is most significant* Teachers, parents 
and group leaders faced with this problem will not find an 
easy solution* They should strive toward some answer to the 
problem however and assist the adolescent to gain acceptance* 

More information is required before this matter can be fully 
understood* 


Social Behavior in Adolescence 
Adolescent social behavior may be thought of as having six 
main aspects: 

1* Conformity to the group - due to feelings of insecurity 

2. Self-assertiveness - to win approval of the groups to 
achieve status* 

3. Social Consciousness - awareness of roles expected of an 
individual. 

it* Social Discrimination - generally called ’snobbishness*, 
reaches its peak in adolescence

5* Resistance to Adult Authority - through a desire for inde¬ 
pendence 

6. Quarreling - centered on social affairs*^ 

A knowledge of the factors influencing adolescent behavior 
is necessary for the \mderstanding of the individual during this 
period of development# To some extent the motivating forces 
are produced by the standards and values of the culture in 
which he lives# To a much greater degree, however, the adoles¬ 
cent is motivated by the values and ideals of his owi peer group. 

One of the most powerful forces in any peer group is the 
unwritten code by \^ich it governs its young members. This 
code can be so strong as to resist grown-up guidance# How the 
code develops and the form it takes are the result of many 
informal decisions#30 

The influence of the peer group is strengthened by the 
fact that it is “##.essentially intolerant of deviation# It 
demands almost complete conformity to the dominant concerns 
and standards of the group#” 

It would appear that generalizations concerning the 
factors influencing adolescent behavior should be made with 
care since”##at different ages through adolescence different 
values are held as to the desirability of various personal

characteristics.” 32 These factors are not static but change 
through adolescence and differ from one person to another. 

Summary- 

Adolescent peer groups are complex in structure. They 
vary from the simple paired relationship of friends to the 
larger social group, -the crowd. In each the individual has 
a role to play. Activity within such groups is essential for 
the satisfactory adjustment of the individual, for here the 
adolescent gradually becomes acquainted with the practices 
of adult society. With its demands for conformity, the peer 
group exerts considerable influence on young people. Knowledge 
of the structure and the operation of these groups should lead 
to greater understanding of many phases of adolescent life.

Acceptance 

Scandrette33 reports that representative sociometric 
studies have shown that a positive relation exists between 
the number of choices an individual receives and the following 
factors: propinquity, frequency of association, age, size, 
intelligence, maturity, scholarship, parental occupation, 
similarity of interests and personality traits. 

In a study of seven hundred children selected from grades 
six, nine and twelve in two central New York schools, Kuhlen 
and Lee^^ state that at the twelfth grade level the highly

accepted adolescent boys Initiated games, were active, socially 
aggressive, extroverted, friendly, enthusiastic, cheerful and 
popular. The least accepted boys sought attention, were restless 
and domineering, enjoyed fights and acted older than they were. 

As the age of the group increased, the investigators found 
that boys were more frequently mentioned as liking the opposite 
sex, enjoying jokes on themselves, being willing to take a 
chance and as being enthusiastic. They suggested that increas¬ 
ing sensitivity to social situations and increasing social 
activity were implied in these trends. With increase in age 
boys assume a more dominant role in the adolescent social scene. 

In reporting on the two hundred most accepted and two 
hundred least accepted students selected by sociometric test 
from the sixteen hundred sophomore, junior and senior classes 
in Anderson, Indiana, Brown35 states that there was no evidence 
that a child from a broken home suffered a handicap in winning 
acceptance among his peers. Although having one or more 
brothers and no sisters had a very high positive association 
for girls, no other phase of sibling status, including that of 
being the only child, appeared to be related to social accept¬ 
ance. Children of below average intelligence appeared more 
frequently in the low acceptance group. The study indicated 
that for boys there was a moderate positive association 
between hours worked for pay and high social acceptance.

There was also a low but significant positive association be¬ 
tween acceptance and socio-economic status indicated by the 
greater acceptance of children whose fathers were professional 
men, proprietors, managers or senior officials. 

The students listed their reasons for accepting individuals 
as 2 common interests or ideals, understanding of children, 
good manners, sincerity and helpfulness. Their reasons for 
rejection were: engaging in conduct considered wrong, insincerity, 
low ideals, using profane or obscene language, and snobbishness. 

The position of rural students vanned to a town school was 

investigated by Bonney.^^ His study contained two groups of 

vanned and resident pupils* The first sample was 152 students 

from grades ten, eleven and twelve in a town of five thousand 

people and the second contained ninety-four students from 

grades seven to twelve in a university demonstration high 

school. He found that in these two instances «...bus students 

are not being accepted by their peers on an equal basis with the 

town students,** 37 Commenting on this situation he said: 

•. .One of the important factors making for difficulty in social 
integration of diverse populations is the degree of difference 
in socio-economic-cultural backgrounds. Also when country 
children are brought into a town school they are not available, 
except on rare occasions, to mix with the town children after 
school hours. This obviously puts the country children at a 
serious disadvantage in winning peer status with the town 
students,38

Leaders 

In a study of leadership in a group of 1|85 graduates of 
a large military school over a five year period, Gowan^^ found 
that leaders tended to be slightly younger than the mean of 
their age group. They were significantly higher in ability 
and achievement, significantly less self-sufficient, more 
confident, more sociable and more inclined to tall thin body 
types. 

Bratton and associates^® state that the intelligence 
level of leaders is only slightly more than average and that 
academic success does not coi»relate with leadership ability 
in out-of-school situations. 

Meyers^^ names eleven characteristics correlating with 
leadership as determined from his study of 230 students from 
four high school grades in the P. K* Yonge Laboratory School 
of the University of Florida. These are: originality, 
ambition, persistence, emotional stability, judgment, popu¬ 
larity, commimication skills, insight, initiative, coopera¬ 
tion and knowledge.

From the cumulative records of 1189 seniors graduated 
from Central High School in Tulsa, Oklahoma, ReynoldsU2 
selected k37 leaders and 1^1 non-leaders for study. He reports 
that high school leaders excel non-leaders in scholarship and 
intelligence and rate higher on personality traits. 

From these studies it would appear that leaders generally 
are higher in ability and achievement than non-leaders. There 
is also some indication that leaders received higher ratings 
on positive personality traits than non-leaders. 


Friends 

In a study of 280 boys and girls representing a cross- 
section of the junior high schools of Riverside, California, 
Jenkins^-5 states that the socio-economic status of the parents 
in the community is an important criterion in the choice of 
frienls which the child makes, also notes that children 
tend to choose friends of approximately the same age and 
intelligence. 

Furfey investigated mutual pairs of chums of mean age 
156.8 months. He concluded that: 

1. Association, either at school or in the home neighborhood 
seems to be an essential condition for the formation of 
boys* friendships. 

2. Within the same school or neighborhood group, boys tend to 
choose, chums of the same age, size, intelligence and 
maturity.

Pintner and associates'^ using a group of 8l9 children from 
nine to sixteen years of age in New York, found that physical 
maturity and to some extent mental maturity were far more potent 
in influencing friendships than were personality traits. 

From a review of the studies related to the motivation 
and structure of the adolescent peer group, it would appear 
that there is need for new research. Authorities agree fairly 
well on the behavior that adolescents seek in their group 
members. There is, however, less agreement on the traits 
that they value in their leaders and in their choice of 
friends.

CHAPTER IV 


METHODS OF STUDY 


The peer group has definite functions in the development 
of adolescents. Many of the existing studies employ the 
normative cross-sectional method of research. Commenting on 
these Ktihlen says: 

While studies of the type just mentioned have contributed 
immeasurably to the understanding of people in general and 
have provided methods for stacking individuals, they have by 
their very natiare neglected to consider what is true with 
respect to particular individuals. Facts which are originally 
personal lose theaj:’ individuality when averaged in with similar 
facts from many other individuals. Much, therefore, is to be 
learned tiirough individual case studies in which the indivi¬ 
duality of the data is maintained and the relatively unique 
interaction of various factors in the single person observed. 

An understanding of the behavior of a particular individual win 
result only from an understanding of his background, present 
circumstances, capacities, motivations, attitudes, experiences, 
frustrations and successes...Relevant information can be 
obtained only through a careful and insightful study of that 
person. 

Bios suggests two significant results of the close study 
of the members of a group: 

The two values of the case-study approach—its contribution 
to an intensive and detailed understanding of the individtxal 
personality and its contribution as an inductive method to the 
general understanding of adolescent development—are values 
w^ch enrich and supplement each other. u7

Since the case study approach includes a limited number of 
individuals, the results are never regarded as the proof of any 
hypothesis. It does, on the other hand, provide insight into 
behavior that furthers the understanding of the individual and is 
a most economical source of hypotheses which can be investigated 
with large sample techniques. 

The present investigation used a modified case study 
approach to the problem of peer group influences on adolescent 
development. Since age and sex are important factors in 
grouping, the boys of the grade eleven high school class in 
the town of Brooks were the specific group studied. To permit 
intensive investigation the area for study was limited to two 
phases of adolescence, the structwe of the peer group and 
its influence upon the behavior of the individual. 

To secTU’e the information necessary for this study 
several procedxu'es were employed: measures of sociometric 
status, interests, personality, intelligence, achievement and 
adjustment; in addition autobiographies and interviews with 
students, parents and teachers, and the school’s cumulative 
record system were utilized. The instruments and procedures 
employed in the study are reviewed below. 

Sociometric Measurement 

The Sociometric Test . The Sociometric Test is a device 
\ised to indicate the general structure of the group, patterns 
of acceptance and rejection, and the interrelationships of 
individuals within the group. Individuals were asked to state 
with whom they preferred to associate in specific situations.

The number of choices yielded a sociometric score which was 
recorded in a sociogram to reveal graphically the structiire 
of the group* The criteria for association**•••should cover 
wide areas and different aspects of life within the group, 
and,••the number of choices should be that which the indivi¬ 
dual makes without \mdue urging,** It is further suggested 
that three criteria and three choices usually prove to be 
the best arrangement. 

Negative choices, that is, the indication of those with 
whom you prefer not to associate, have in recent years been 
omitted by many investigators. This is due to the fact that 
the question is artificial and also to its possible ill 
effects upon pupils. 

Although they have significant value in furthering the 
understanding of group structures, sociometric tests are not 
without limitations, Cunningham notes that sociograms are 
useful in indicating the general structure of a group, but 
are limited in indicating the status of the individual in 
the group, 

Another study suggests that sociometric tests show the 
socially accepted members of a group but do not, as it was 
supposed, give a measure of the indi^d-dual* s social adjust-

ment,^^ For complete understanding of the group further 


instruments must be used* 

The Classroom Social Distance Scale * This test is a 

refinement of the Bogardus Social Distance Scale developed 

by Ruth Cunningham at Teacher*s College, Columbia University* 

On this test each student rates others on a five point scale: 

1* Would like to have him as one of ray best friends 
2* Would like to have him in my group but not as a close 
friend 

3* Would like to be with him once in a while, but not often 
or long at a time 

ii. Don*t mind his being in our room but I don*t want to have 
anything to do with him 
5* Wish he weren*t in our room* 

From the results two scores are available: 

***one, a self-social-distance score, indicating the degree 
of acceptance or rejection of the group by an individual ; 
and two, a group-social-distyce score, indicating the degree 
of acceptance or re jection of an individual by the group * 52 

The purpose of the test is described in the general 

directions: 

.**to discover the social tone of a group as a whole, and 
the degree to which individuals and subgroups are accepted by 
the group and accept others in the group* It is devised to 
extend the usual sociometric approach, which allows a limited 
number of responses,•**to include an opportunity for every 
child to give a reaction to every other in the group *53

as a means of discovering the subjects* general reputation

among their classmates.” The test consists of a series of 
descriptions of behavior opposite each of -which a pupil records 
the name or names of the classmates most clearly fitting the 
descrip-bion. A particular trait is credited to a member if 
indicated by five or more in the group* 

Sims Score Card for Socio-Economic Status * The Score 
Card was developed to provide ”***a simple, convenient and 
objective device for ascertaining and recording the general 
cultiiral, social and economic backgroimds furnished by the 
homes of school children.” The test allows a rating for 
each home from zero, indeterminately low, to ten, indeter¬ 
minately hig^i* 

Sims SCI Occupational Rating Scale * This scale was 
designed ”***to reveal the level in our social structure*.. 
with which a person unconsciously identifies himself*” 

The social class levels of the test are: lower working, work¬ 
ing, middle-working, middle, upper-middle, upper, and upper- 
upper* 

The measures discussed above should give a fairly clear 
picture of the structure of the group, the relationships of

The Sims measiirements will allow an investigation of the role 
of class and status in the formation of the group. 

Adjustment, Personality, Interest and Psychological Measurement 

The S.R.A. Youth Inventory . The Youth Inventory is a 
check list of 298 questions designed to help teachers, counselors 
and school administrators identify quickly the problems young 
people say worry them most. The current needs and problems 
of young people are divided into eight major areas: 

School, Looking Ahead, About Myself, Getting Along with Others, 

My Horae and Family, Boy Meets Girl, Health, and Things in 
General. The students may score the test and plot their own 
profiles. The profile sheet contains information to help 
the individual interpret his scores. In addition a Basic 
Difficulty Score can be found which may indicate those 
students with real personality problems. This scale is still 
in the experimental stage. 

The Rotter Incomplete Sentences Blank . The incomplete 
sentences method incorporates the advantage of the economical 
so-called objective personality tests and the projective 
techniques^® Since no formal standardization has been carried

on with high school students, the test results were used to 
help assess the attitudes and values of the individual* 

The Guilford-Zimmerman Temperament Survey * This survey 
yields scores on ten traits: General Activity, Restraint, 
Ascendance, Sociability, Emotional Stability, Objectivity, 
friendliness. Thoughtfulness, ^^ersonal Relations and Mascu¬ 
linity* From the scores an individual’s profile may be drawn* 

The Thurstone Tenperament Schedule * This schedule was 
developed to show types of ten?3erament* It is a list of questions 
about likes and dislikes, preferences and habits, in everyday 
life* The areas covered are: Active, Vigorous, Impulsive, 
Dominant, Stable, Sociable and Reflective* The self-scoring 
answer pad contains a profile and a brief description of the

The Gordon Personal Profile * The Gordon Personal Profile 
measures five aspects of personality^ Ascendancy, Responsi¬

profile may be plotted from the test scores and reference 
made to the manual for an interpretation of the results* 

The Kuder Preference Record, Vocational, Form CH * This 
test is designed to help the individual make a more systematic

promising in the light of his preferences* These areas are: 
Outdoor, Mechanical, Computational, Scientific, Persuasive, 
Artistic, Literary, Musical, Social Service, and Clerical. 

From the test results the individual may plot his profile 
and, using the manual, determine the occupations related to 
his interests. 

The Otis Quick-Scoring Mental Ability Tests . In this 
study the Gamma Test was used. The results were converted 
to the Gamma I.Q. scores. 

The scores of the various tests mentioned above yielded 
considerable information on the individual members of the group 
studied. These data, coupled with the results of the other 
measurements, provided some insight into the behavior accepted 
by adolescents and traits associated with various roles in 
the group. 

Procedure 

Early in the spring of 1956 the group was approached 
to determine its reaction to serving as an experimental group 
for ”a study of personality development” in young people* The 
students were, as a whole, enthusiastic. The true purpose 
of the study was not revealed at any time. Although the stucfy 
was limi ted to male students, the girls of the class were 
included in all testing and interview programs.

In an investigation of this type, the problem of rapport 
required careful consideration, since a number of the tests 
used could readily be made to yield false information. The 
fact that the program was conducted by an adult who was their 
teacher and so a person of authority in the school might have 
tended to prevent free response from the students. On the 
other hand, contact with the boys over several years in athletic 
and social activities in the school and the community had 
developed feelings of acceptance and trust which led to a 
reasonable state of confidence in the results of the testing 
progTam. 

At the spring Parent-Teacher Conferences, the study was 
introduced to the parents concerned, and they too approved 
the project. 

The collection of data began with the fall school term, 
September, 1956. The first test presented was a sociometric 
test asking the question »Near whom would you like to sit this 
term?” The students were asked to make three choices. In 
this month also, the first autobiographical study was attempted. 
The topic given was ”A Freshie View”, a review of the first 
year in high school. Interviews were started to secure per¬ 
sonal information concerning the students. This material was 
recorded on a personal data sheet. Each student was asked to 
name his best friend and then to complete a check list on 
which he rated both himself and his best friend. 

In the months of October and November several tests 
were administered. These included a measure of intelligence, 
the Otis Quick Scoring Test of Mental Ability, Gamma formj

The S«R*4. Youth Inventory; the Thurstone Temperament Schedule; 
the Rotter Incomplete Sentence Blank, High School form; the 
Kuder Preference Record Vocational Form C and the Sims Score 
Card for Socio-economic Status. 

During November, the parents of the students were inter¬ 
viewed at the regular fall Parent-Teacher conferences. The 
second autobiographical study was also introduced in November. 
The topic this time was ”\\/hat a Difference a Year Makes”. 

Here the student was asked to compare his present situation 
with that of the past year. 

In December the first »Guess Who” test, consisting of 
twenty-five behavior traits, was given to the group. 

The second sociometric test, using the same criterion 
and the same number of choices as before, was given. The 
understanding was that the seating plan would be changed for 
the new term according to their wishes. At the same time, a 
new socioraetric test was given, with the criterion “x^hich of 
the students here would you like to have as a guest at home 
for the holidays.” The class members were asked to make 
three choices. 

During January the Classroom Social Distance Scale^^ 
was administered to the group. The Sims' S.C.I. Occupational 
Rating Scale and the Gordon Personal Profile were also used 
during the month. 

^^he Classroom Social Distance Scale by Ruth Cunningham was 
made available for this study through the kindness of the 
Bureau of Publications, Teachers College, Columbia Univer¬ 
sity, New York.

In February a second series of planned interviews was 
undertalcen with the twofold purpose of evaluating the informa¬ 
tion assembled and of securing more definite information on 
group structure and roles. The character sketch previously 
used was repeated for the student’s best friend. Written 
reports were requested from the group members on the topics 
"These Things Influence Me Most" and ”1^ Best Friend”. A 
third utilisation of the first sociometric test was made toward 
the end of the month. The Giiilford-Ziramerman Temperament Survey 
was also administered at this time. 

Throughout the period of the study the teachers of the 
high school were encouraged to comment on the behavior of the 
members of the group. The staff was most co-operative in 
this, thus widening the scope of observation to the entire 
school day. 

To expand the study to include information on the groups* 
behavior outside the school situation, visits were paid to 
the magistrate of the town, the R.C.M.P. offices and to the 
various clergymen associated with group members. These 
people added considerably to the observations made by the 
experimenter. 

The areas under discussion will be considered under three 
broad headings: group structures, individual studies and 
influences affecting adolescent behavior. The sub-topics in 
each area are as follows: 





33 


A. GROUP STRUCTURE 

1. What is the overall group structure? 

2« How stable does this structure appear over a seven 
month period? 

What sub-groups exist id.thin the main groups? 

U* On what basis are these structures formed? 

B. INDIVIDUAL STUDIES 

1. Baclcground of the individuals in the group. 

2. Role and status within the sub-culture. 

3. Characteristics and behavior associated with roles* 

C. Il'JFLUENCES EFFECTIVE UPON ADOLESCENT BEHAVIOR 

1. Within the group. 

2. Outside the group. 

The case study method was employed in this study because, 
with the small group and restricted area of investigation, 
it would permit a more intensive investigation. It was hoped 
that this would yield some insight into the structure of the 
adolescent peer group and the influence on the behavior of 


its members

CHAPTER V 


LOCATION OF STUDY 

The history of the town of Brooks and its area dates back 
to 1882, with the townsite proper surveyed in 1907.^^ At 
present the town covers 1,120 acres and has a population of 
approximately 2,500* It is the center for an area which 
extends about thirty-five miles in each direction* 

The population of the town and district is made up of 
about sixty per cent British and American stock, fotirteen 
per cent North-Wsst European, fourteen per cent Central 
European, ten per cent Scandinavian and two per cent Japanese 
origin* 

Brooks is in an agricultixral area, chiefly ranching* Two 
hundred acres of irrigated land in the district produce a 
variety of cereal grain and vegetable crops* Brooks has 
several manufacturing plants associated with agriculture* 

The newest industry, a potato chip factory, opened this year* 
Further industrial development is anticipated in the next 
few years* 

^^Material for this chapter is taken frcm the »Economic Survey 
of the Town of Brooks ,” published by the Government of the 
I^ovince of Alberta, at present under revision by the Brooks 
Board of Trade*

The town has three permanent school buildings that 
provide twenty-five classrooms, home economics and industrial 
arts facilities and a combination auditorium-gymnasium. There 
are twenty-six teachers and approximately seven hundred pupils© 

There are numerous organized athletic activities in the 
town© Recently artificial ice was installed in the curling 
rink and both adults and young people are active in the curling 
club© With the completion of the new high school, basketball 
and badminton competitions have become quite popular activities 
in the school gymnasium during the winter© Golf has increased 
in popularity during the last year particularly with the 
adolescent group© Baseball is organized from little Leaguers 
to Seniors, with the R©C©H©p, handling most of the younger 
leagues. Some hockey is played, but there is no covered arena 
and the sport has little following aside from the participants. 
Skating is popular with the younger children, but the adoles¬ 
cents are not too enthusiastic about it. 

At the present time there is scane controversy over the 
construction of a swimming pool and covered arena. The town 
is split as to which should be built first, since there are 
not sufficient funds for both projects. Recently a money 
by-law for the construction of a pool was defeated. The 
results of this vote were a disappointment to the young people, 
the majority of whom favor a swimming pool. 

In addition to sports there are many other recreational 
groups in town. There is an active amateur dramatic club 
and a community band, both of i^ich draw extensively on the

talents of the adolescents. The Air Cadets, Cubs and Brownies 
have good memberships. Scouts and Guides are in the process 
of reorganization. There are also several church groups for 
young people which hold mid-week meetings. 

Most of the organized activities for young people cease 
to operate during the summer months. In this period adoles¬ 
cents have little to do in their spare time. There is a 
definite need for some kind of planned summer program. 

For the adiilts of the town there are many fraternal, 
service and agricultural organizations. Indeed, it is felt 
by many that from an ad\:G.t point of view, the town is over¬ 
organized. 

Within a few miles of Brooks is Lake Newell, an artificial 
lake, the site of Kinbrook provincial Park. It is being rapidly 
developed into an attractive summer resort. The Brooks area 
is widely known for its migratory and upland game birds, 
particularly the rink-neck pheasant, and annually accommodates 
an influx of several thousand hunters. A modern town in every 
respect, with many well kept homes. Brooks affords pleasant 
living conditions.

CHAPTER VI 


THE STRUCTURE OF THE GROUP 

Sociometric Tests 

This chapter is concerned with the results of the 
sociometric measureiaent made during the seven months of the 
study. These are analyzed to show the group structure and 
the status of the individuals in it. 


The choice pattern of the whole grade eleven class is 
illustrated in Figure One. This soeiogram is the result of 
a test given in March, 1957> asking the students to name 



Figure 1.— «Near VJhom Would lou like to Sit?” Grade Eleven, 
Brooks High School, March, 1957• 




























38 


tiiree classmates whom they wuld like to have sit near them# 
This sociogram was selected to introduce the entire class and 
represents a fairly stable arrangement of this group. Arrows 
with two heads represent reciprocated choices; single arrows 
represent one-way choices. The remaining sociograms will be 
limited to the boys to illustrate more clearly the structure 
of their group. 

There are three main sub-groups within the class. A and 
B are composed of girls and C is the boys' group which was 
the subject of the entire study. Typical of this group, the 
boys chose males, for the most part, throughout the period 
of study. 

A sociometric test asking for seatmates given in September, 
1956 yielded the sociogram of ELgure Two.

Boys, September, 1956.

From this it can be seen that Ian was the most popular boy- 
in the class at that time. There is a triangle of reciprocated 
choices between Bob, Frank and Ian, while ano-ther -triangle is 
almost complete wi-th Dennis, Hugh and Clifford as members. 
Frank, Ian and Hugh had each of their choices reciprocated. 

All the boys had at least one selection returned except Eric, 
a new boy in the class who had come to Brooks in the late 
summer of 1956. 

The ssime test was administered in December and the 



Figure 3«“””Near I'ihom Would You Like to Sit?” Grade 
Eleven Boys, December, 1956. 

This structure is more complex than the earlier diagram. 
Ian, Bob and Frank maintained their reciprocated choice pattern 
and are the dominant segment of the group. Bob was chosen this 
time by all the boys except Hugh. The departure of Dennis ft*om 
the class at the end of November broke up the second triangle.

with Clifford shifting his choices to Alan, a new member, and 
to Bob. Hugh was in the hospital at this time and was not chosen 
by any of the group although he was expected back at school 
for the next term. George and Eric were practically isolates, 
receiving choices only from Hugh. George selected the three 
most popular boys as seat mates and Eric followed a similar 
pattern but chose Clifford instead of Ian. 

The third time the sociometric test was used, the pattern 
shown in Figure Four resulted. 



Figure —“Near Whom Would You Like to Sit?” Grade 
Eleven Boys, March, 1957* 

On this occasion the triangle of Frank, Bob and Ian is 
not complete as Ian did not choose Frank. These three, however, 
remained the most popular boys in the class. Ian was mentioned 
by all the members of the class. Eric and George each received 
reciprocated choices with the popular boys. Hugh received 
one choice this time but he did not respond. Alan was the 
only member of the group to receive no choices.

A noticeable featxare of these three sociograms is the 
complexity of Figures Three and Four idien coitpared with Figiire 
Two* A possible explanation may be that some time is reqxaired 
in the fall to renew acquaintances and establish the roles of 
the group members* New members would be assimilated during 
the early months also* The most stable section of the grov?) 
is the relationship between Frank, Bob and Ian* The selections 
of the others in the class revolve about this triangle as 
the boys try to become part of the basic group* 

Having girls seated nearby is unavoidable in a small 
classroom but it is not the preferred situation from the beys* 
point of view, since only two of them made choices that crossed 
sex lines* Frank*s selection of Doreen on the first test and 
Kay on the second may be the result of his having them sit 
near him in an earlier arrangement and finding it satisfactory* 
At any rate he can afford to be somewhat different from the 
other boys in the group because of his high status* Eric, 
the other boy to choose a girl on a test, may already feel 
some measure of acceptance with the boys through a mutual choice 
with Ian, and be attempting to establish friendships with the 
girls* group through Doreen, their most popular member*

An indication of the stability of the individual's position 
in the group is given in Table One* Here it can be seen, from 
the totals received, that Frank, Ian and Bob were the most 
popular members* Although their rank did not remain the same, 
these three held the top positions in all of the socioraetric 
tests. In December and March their choice status is parti¬ 
cularly noticeable* Eric, although chosen once on each of 
the tests, was selected by a different person in each instance* 
This may be due to the fact that he was new in tom and tended 
to be very critical of the group's activities* Alan, another 
new member, received two choices on the second test and none 
on the third* This could be caused by his program which 
placed him more frequently with the grade ten class, where he 
found greater acceptance as the term progressed* George, 
another mosiber receiving few choices, had most of his friends

in grade ten too* Hugh*s position was likely due to his illness* 
He was absent for the second test and on his return the pressure 
of school work left him little time for social activities* This 
might suggest that active and continued participation in the 
affairs of the group has considerable bearing on popularity* 

The distribution of choices made by the boys in the three 
tests is given in Table Two. On the tests every boy chose Ian 
at least once and Frank was selected by all but Dennis. Hugh 
and Dennis were the only boys -sdio apparently did not want Bob 
for a seatmate* The most popular boys therefore received 
not only the largest total choices but also had the greatest 
number of individuals choosing them. The key group had the 
greatest number of their choices reciprocated as shown in 
Table Three* This may be indicative of their greater accept¬ 
ance in the group, and suggests an awareness on their part of 
their relations with its members* 

Alan was the most consistent member of the group, choosing 
Bob, Frank and Ian on the two tests written. It should be 
noted that although he did not fit well into the grade eleven 
class, his selections were for its most popular members, a 
rather unrealistic view of the situation. Bob chose Ian and 
Frank three times and Clifford twice* His was the most stable 
choice pattern of those taking three tests*

Frsunk and Hugh were constant on two choices but varied on 
the third* The other raembers of the group showed a greater 
variation in choice, with Eric the extreme case in that his 
pattern of selection was different in each test* 

In viewing the results of the three sociometric tests 
it would appear that there is a closer relationship between 
the choices in December and March than between either of these 
and the September test* Possibly in the eariy months the 
structural patterns are being formed and this causes the

realignment and stability of choice noted in later tests. 

In order to determine whether the selections of the group 
on the criterion of seating arrangement would hold for other 
activities, a different test was given in December, 1956. The 
question asked was, “Whom would you like to invite home with 
you to spend the Christmas holidays.” The sociogram constructed 
from this data is shown in Figure Five. 



Figure 5* — ”Whom Would lou like to Have Home With You 

to Spend the Christmas Holidays?” December, 1956. 

This is not as complex as the previous diagrams. Asked 
for three choices, two of the boys, Hugh and Eric, could only 
give two and George selected only one of his associates. 

Figure Six resulted from a third type of sociometric test 
having the criterion, ”l\rith whom would you like to attend the 
movies?” 

The popularity of Bob, Franlc and Ian is immediately in 
evidence. For this social activity, Clifford and Alan show 
an interest in the company of girls. George again names only 
one of his classmates. Hugh did not receive any choices.

It would appear that the boys who are desirable as 
seatmates are also popular as companions in the out-of-school 
activity of attending the movies. As far as the home visits 
are concerned, the situation is somewhat different. Ian

received the greatest niunber of choices again, but otherwise 
there appears to be little relationship in the choice pattern 
when the various tests are compared. It seems that the boys 
evaluate their associates differently in selecting visitors 
to their homes. Perhaps in the latter case the individual 
feels that he can be more selective whereas in the school 
situation, since he must sit near someone a choice may be more 
easily made. In addition, this may be due to the individual 
attempting to anticipate the acceptance of the visitor by the 
family. If the home were poor, it would adversely affect 
the individual in the eyes of his associates and lower his 
status.

On this test the members of the class are rated on a five 


point scale. The categories are weighted from one (would like 
to have him as one of injr best friends) to five (wish he weren’t 
in our room). An individual’s group-social"distance score 
is determined by finding the number of times he is checked in 
each division, multiplying by the weight assigned to the 
division and summing the resulting five numbers. His self- 
social-distance score is determined by considering the number 
of individuals he checks in each division, mxiltiplying ty 
the weight for the division and finding the total of these. 

In interpreting the results it should be noted that the 
lower the group-social-distance score, the greater the degree 
of acceptance of the individual by the group. Similarly, 
the lower the self-social-distance score, the greater the 
acceptance of the group by the individual. 

As an example, Ian was mentioned in the first category 
(would like to have him as one of ny best fi*iends) by six 
boys and in the second category (would like to have him in 
my group but not as a close friend) by one boy. His group- 
social-distance score is therefore (6x1) ♦(Lx 2), which 
is eight, suggesting better than average acceptance by the 
group. Ian rated three boys in the first category, two in 
the second and two in the tiiird. His self-social-distance 
score is (3x1) +(2x2) + (2x3), a total of thirteen. 

This score is above the group average and suggests that Ian 
does not regard the group as highly as its members value him.

From the results of this test Clifford is the most accepted 
member with the lowest possible score of seven. Frank, who 
appeared to be highly popular from the sociometric tests, ranked 
toward the top of this scale, suggesting a lack of acceptance 
in the group. This position was due chiefly to the fact that 
he received an unfavorable rating from Ian 'which increased his 
total. 

In cougaring the results of -the two scales it can be seen 
that Clifford and Ian, who were the most accepted boys, had 
the highest seLf-social-distance scores. This would suggest 
that they tended to rate their associates higher on the scale 
and exercised more care in the choice of friends. On the 
other hand, Eric showed greater acceptance of the group than 
was given to him and Alan wanted everyone in the group for a 
fl'iend. This might indicate that boys -jiio are not highly 
accepted by the peers tend to offer their friendship to all 
in an effort to gain some measure of security* 

It seemed that with the small number in the group, one 
rating could influence the total result unduly, and because 
of this the scale does not discriminate between accepted and 
imaccepted members of the group as well as it might. 

Summary 

From this discussion it would sppear that the structure 
of the group has undergone some changes during the early months 
of the school terra with increased stability as time passed. The 
major shifts in the later months were due to atteii5)ts by the 
peripheral group to gain greater acceptance. The beys seemed

to choose companions for movies on the same basis as they did 
seatmates, but used other methods of evaluation in selecting 
visitors to their homes. Those boys most accepted by their 
peers seemed to be more critical of the group, while the least 
accepted members tended to rate it more highly. 

A suiTimary of the data concerning the choice pattern and 
social distance scores for each boy is presented to assist 
in the understanding of the individuals in the study. 

On the two sociometric tests asking for seatmates that 
were written by Alan, he chose Bob, Frank and Ian, the three 
most popular members of the class. On the December test he 
received choices from Clifford and Bob while on the March 
test he received no choices. This would suggest that he 
was not well accepted by the group. This is likely due to 
the fact that he had few interests in common with his class¬ 
mates. As home visitors Alan selected Ian, the most popular 
boy in the class, George and Clifford. For companions at the 
movies he chose Ian again. Bob and Kay. As he was the young¬ 
est in the group, the latter choice may be an attempt on his 
part to show a more mature outlook in the effort to increase 
his sense of status. On the Classroom Social Distance Scale 
Alan rated the group more favorably than its members rated 
him, indicating in his response that he wanted all the boys 
in the group as his close friends. This reaction seemed to be 
typical of the boys not well accepted by their peers.

The socioraetric tests revealed that Bob was one of the 
most popular boys in the class. Most of the choices he made 
were reciprocated. Along with Frank and Ian he formed the 
nucleus of the group. Bob was less popular as a home visitor, 
being chosen by only his close friends Frank and Ian, but as 
a movie companion, in addition to Frank and Ian he wais selected 
by Alan and Eric. On the Classroom Social Distance Scale Bob 
tended to show slightly greater acceptance of the group than 
was shown to him. 

Clifford*s indifferent attitude toward school apparently 
caused him to be regarded as an unsuitable seatmate by the 
members of the class. As the terra progressed, however, he 
gained in favor and the second and third tests reveal a 
reciprocated choice with Ian, a member of the central group 
of boys, and he was also selected on the third test by Bob, 
another popular boy. Clifford received only two choices as a 
companion at the movies, perhaps because he was older than the 
other boys. This may also account for his being more hi^3y 
regarded as a home visitor, receiving four choices. On the 
Classroom Social Distance Scale Clifford appeared to be the 
most accepted member of the group. His age and the fact that 
he planned to leave school may have caused an increase in 
his prestige in the group, resulting in this score. His Self- 
Social-Distance score of eleven suggested that he tended to 
rate his associates somewhat less favorably on the scale than 
they rated him. This tendency seemed typical of the well accept¬ 
ed boys in the responses on the Classroom Social Distance Scale.

Dennis was present for only one of the sociometric tests* 
On this, he selected Hugh, Clifford and Ian. His choice of 
Clifford was reciprocated. Dennis, Clifford and Hugh had 
been a small clique during the past year, but Hugh apparently 
did not want to continue the relationship. On the Classroom 
Social Distance Scale, Dennis had a Qroi:|9-Social-Distance 
score of fourteen. Thj.s is well above average and suggests 
that he was not well accepted by his classmates. Although 
Dennis had left school to join the R.C.A.F., the score 
seemed to be a fairly accurate description of his position 
when he was in a group. 

The sociometric tests gave some indication of Eric*s 
problems in finding a place in the groi^j. He came to Brooks 
from Vegreville in the fall of 1956, and was in the process 
of establishing himself with his peers during the period of 
investigation. On the first test Eiric could make only two 
choices for seatmates, selecting Bob and Ian, two of the most 
popular boys. He was chosen on this test 1:y George, a young, 
rather immature boy. On the second test Eric named Bob, 
Clifford and Frank, and on the third, Frank, Ian and Doreen, 
the most popular member of the girls* group. The changing 
pattern of choice would suggest experimentation with the 
various class members in his search for friendship and 
acceptance. On the second test Eric was chosen by Hugh and 
on the third, his choice of Ian was reciprocated. The 
latter instance might indicate a measure of acceptance, but 
the scarcity of choices seemed to suggest more strongly that

Eric was not well received by the group. Eric chose Clifford 
and Alan as home visitors but received no choices himself. He 
selected the three most popular boys, Frank, Ian and Bob, 
as his companions for the movies. In this instance he was 
again chosen Ian. The results of the Classroom Social 
Distance Scale suggested that Eric was not well accepted by 
the boys and also that he did not rate the group favorably. 

His critical attitude toward the group as well as his short 
period of residence in Brooks appeared to be the chief causes 
of his lack of acceptance. 

Frank gained in popularity as the term progressed. He 
made reciprocated choices with Bob in all sociometric tests 
and, except for one instance, with Ian also. He received 
three choices as a home visitor and five as a companion at the 
movies. AH the choices he made, excepting in the case of 
Ian, were reciprocated, suggested that Frank judged his 
position fairly accurately. In two instances he chose girls 
as seatmates, a practice not common with the boys of this 
class. Frank apparently felt secure enough in the group to 
mal^e this selection. On the Classroom Social Distance Scale 
Franl< had a high Group-Social-Distance score due to an 
unfavorable rating by Ian. He showed better than average 
acceptance of the group with a Self-Social-Distance score 
of nine. 

On the first sociometric test George selected Bob, 

Eric and Hugh, three relatively quiet and retiring boys, as 
his seatmates. In the remaining two tests he chose Bob, 

Prank and Ian, the three most popular members of the class.

George was chosen by Hugh on all tests and by Frank on the 
last one. The only classmate George selected as a home visitor 
or a movie companion was Frank. These choices were recipro¬ 
cated and in addition he received a choice from Alan as a home 
visitor. These results suggest that George is not well 
accepted by the group. The Classroom Social Distance Scale, 
on the other hand, suggested that George was given better 
tlian average acceptance by his classmates. He, in turn, was 
average in his reaction to the group. It would seem that the 
sociometric tests gave a better indication of George’s 
position in the group since the Classroom Social Distance 
Scale apparently does not function well with a small class. 

Hugh, a vanned student, seemed fairly popular with his 
classmates early in the term, as indicated by four choices 
on the first sociometric test. Hugh was in hospital for the 
months of November and December and although expected back 
after the Christmas holidays, he did not receive any choices 
on the December Sociometric test. On the March test asking 
for seatmates, Hugh received one choice from Clifford, another 
vanned student. Clifford also was the only one tdio selected 
Hugh as a home visitor and this choice was reciprocated. 

Since he was busy with school work and was not able to take 
part in the social activities of the groi:^), Hugh did not 
receive any choices as a companion for the movies. The 
Classroom Social Distance Scale revealed that Hugh was not 
too well accepted by his classmates, having a Group-Social- 
Distance score of eleven. His Self-Social-Distance score 
was equal to this too, suggesting less than average acceptance 
of the group.

Ian appeared to be the most popular member of the group. 
He was chosen at least twice by every member of the class 
except Dennis who chose him on the only sociometric test he 
wrote. He received five choices each as a home visitor and 
as a companion for the movies, indicating popularity in 
situations outside the school. Every choice Ian made was 
reciprocated which suggested that he understood his position 
in Ithe group. The Classroom Social Distance Scale also 
indicated acceptance of Ian by his peers and, like Clifford, 
he seemed to be more critical of the group members, having a 
Self-Social-Distance score of thirteen. 

The analysis of the remaining measurements should yield 
information on the role of the individual and his behavior 
in the group which will increase our understanding of its 


structure

THE GROUP MEMBERS 

Before consideration may be given to the roles exercised 
in a group it is necessary to have some knowledge of its 
merabers. A summary of the personality, intelligence, adjust¬ 
ment and interest test scores will be presented in this 
chapter as well as the results of the Sims’ scales and personal 
data derived from interviews and observation. On the basis 
of these data further insights into the grotp structure and 
the roles of the merabers will become possible*

From the data in Table Six, the mean age of the group 
was found to be sjjcteen years, five months. Alan was accelerated 
in grade two, consequently he is one year younger than average. 
Clifford repeated grade ten and therefore is older than his 
classmates. These were the only deviations from the normal 
rate of progress through the grades. The families of the 
group vary in size from one child, in the case of Clifford, 
to seven in Eric's family. 

In order to make comments on the social level of the 
boys' families more intelligible, the divisions of the Sims 
S.C.I. Occupational Rating Scale follow. From the lowest 
to the highest these are: lower-working, working, middle¬ 
working, middle, upper-middle, upper and upper-upper. 

Most of the boys consider their families to be in the 
"middle-working social class", according to this scale. A 
summary for the group is found in Table Seven. Alan and 
George identify themselves with the "working class" which is 
lower than the average for the group and Eric places his 
family higher than the mean, in the middle class. 

On the Sims Score Card for Socio-Economic Status the 
homes are graded on a scale from zero, no home at all, to 
ten, a theoretically perfect home. The divisions in the 
scale are: Indeterminately High, Highest, Very High, High, 

Medium High, Medium, Medium Low, Low, Very Low, Lowest, 
Indeterminately Low.

Dennis, Frank and Bob, have jobs. All the families are of the 
white race and of varied national origin. 

Personality Measurement 

Three measures of personality were utilized in this study, 
the Guilford-Zimmerman Temperament Survey, the Gordon Personal 
Profile and the Thurstone Temperament Schedule. Because it 
yielded scores on the greatest number of traits and appeared 
to be more penetrating in its measurement, the Guilford- 
Zimmermah Temperament Survey was used to give a detailed 
description of the group members. Their percentiles in this 
test are given in Table Eight. In interpreting the results 
of these tests a score above the seventy-fifth percentile was 
considered high and one below the twenty-fifth percentile 
was regarded as a low score. Others were considered to be 
average. 

The analysis of the Guilford-Zimmerman Temperament 
Survey revealed that Alan made average scores on the follow¬ 
ing traits: General Activity, Restraint and Emotional 
Stability. He was above average in Objectivity suggesting 
that he is not overly self-centered. From his scores on 
the traits of Friendliness and personal Relations it would 
seem that Alan has a desire to please others and gets on 
well with his associates. He tends toward shyness and sub¬ 
missiveness. His interests are masculine in character and 
he does not appear to like reflection and planning.

Bob scored mainly in the average range on this test. He has 
a low score on the Emotional Stability scale suggesting a 
tendency toward depression. His above average scores on the 
traits of Thoughtfulness and Personal Relations may indicate 
that he gets on well with others and is tactful and considerate 
in his contact with them. 

From this test Clifford appears to be a very active, carefree, 
imp\ilsive individual, since he has a very high General Activity 
and very low Restraint score. His other scores fall in the middle 


range.

From the test results it may be infeired that Eric is a 
thoughtful individual who enjoys the company of others. He 
may be hampered in dealings with people due to his sensitive 
nature, rather hostile attitude and his tendency to be critical. 
In other respects Eric appears to be average* 

Frank is like Clifford in that he is impulsive, happy-go- 
lucky and full of energy. He is cheerful and optimistic in his 
outlook. Frank likes to dominate the group and may not be 
too tactful in his dealings with people. He made average 
scores on the traits of Sociability, Ascendancy, Objectivity, 
Personal Relations and Masculinity. 

George had no high scores on any of the traits. His 
extremely low score on the Objectivity scale would suggest 
that he is hypersensitive* He does not appear to be at ease 
with others nor get along too well with them* He may be 
impulsive in his actions and rather pessimistic in his outlook* 
Hugh made a very low score on the General Activity scale, 
no doubt due to the fact that he is under doctor’s care for a 
weak heart. He prefers reflection and planning to participation 
as indicated by a high score in Thoughtfulness* Hugh tends 
to be critical of others and may not get on well with them* 

His other scores are average* 

Ian, with high Activity and Thoughtfulness scores would 
apparently be able to plan and carrj^- out activities but his 
low Ascendance score may reduce the effectiveness of this 
ability. He is very low on the Personal Relations scale sug¬ 
gesting that he feels he does not get on well with others. His 
other scares are low average*

The Guilford-Ziitimerinan Terrperament Siirvey reveals that 
Clifford and Frank appear energetic and carefree. Frank seems 
to be the one who likes to be with people most* The test 
shows that Eric, George, Hugh and Ian feel that they do not 
get on well with others, which will likely have an effect on 
their behavior in the group. Bob*s Emotional Stability score 
and George’s low rating in Objectivity may produce problems 
for them also. The results of the Gordon Personal Profile 
are shown in Table Nine*

In the trait Ascendancy, Hugh is at the fifteenth per¬ 
centile on this test while he was at the fifty-fifth percentile 
on the Guilford-Zimmerman. The change may be due to the fact 
that the Gordon personal profile was administered immediately 
after his return from a two month period in hospital and he 
was very conscious of the time he had missed. When the later 
test was given he may have re-established his position in the 
group. George was also lower on the Gordon Personal profile 
in this area. The other members of the group maintained the 
same relative position in this trait on both tests. The 
ratings on both the Gordon and the Gid.lford-Zimmeman were 
comparable in the trait Emotional Stability. Although the 
two tests are designed to measure the same thing, the latter 
test yielded consistently lower percentile scores in Socia¬ 
bility. In the trait Responsibility found on the Gordon 
Personal Profile, Hugh, Eric and Alan have high scores suggest¬ 
ing that they are persevering and determined individuals. 

The rest of the group are average, with Prank and Bob being 
lowr average. 

The Total Scores reveal that Eric tends to rate himself 
favorably on this test and that Alan, Ian and George are very 
critical of themselves. The others are average on this scale. 

In general the Gordon Personal profile seems to bear out 
the findings of the Guilford-Zimmerman Temperament Survey. 

The additional scale of Responsibility on the Gordon Personal 
Profile added to the understancd.ng of the group members. The 
Total Score of the Gordon Personal profile gives an indication

The Active and Vigorous scores on the Thurstone compare 
generally with the Activity scale of the Guilford-Ziramerman. 
George is low on the former and average on the latter but 
that is the only instance of marked difference. The scores 
of the Impulsive scale of the Thurstone and the Restraint scale 
of the Guilford-Zimmerman have the inverse relationship 




























66 


that would be expected. In the Ascendance scale Clifford is 
lower on the Thurstone than the other two. George has a low 
score here, agreeing with the results of the Gordon Personal 
Profile -vdiile Hugh*s score is of the same magnitude as on the 
Guilford-Zimmerman. Ian's score is high average on this test 
and low on the other measures. These differences may be due 
to the interpretation of the test questions or may be within 
the individual at the time the test was administrered. In the 
area of Emotional Stability Alan was considerably higher on the 
Gordon than on the Th\irstone and hi^er still on the Guilford- 
Zimmerroan. This may be through his becoming acquainted with 
the group and finding acceptance in it as time passed. The 
other scores were in the same range on all three tests. 

The Thurstone gave lower scores on Sociability than the 
Gordon Personal profile, but not as low, in most instances, as 
the Guilford-Zimmerman. Alan, Eric, Hugh and Ian have very 
high scores here suggesting that they are quiet, like to work 
alone, and enjoy planning rather than carrying out activities. 
Prank and Clifford are low average in this area while the 
other beys are average. On the Gxjilford-Zimmerman, Alan was 
very low in this trait. This might suggest that he has tended 
to join in the activities of the group as the term progressed. 

From the three tests used to measure personality, certain 
characteristics of the group members have been suggested. 

Alan appears to be a quiet, persevering individual who has a 
desire to please others and gets on well with his associates. 

He tends to be shy and submissive. Bob seems to be tolerant 
and understanding in his relations with others. His very low

score on the Emotional Stability scale of all three tests would 
suggest depression, tenseness and nervousness. Eric appears to 
be a quiet, thoughtful determined person. His sensitive nature 
and hostile, critical attitude toward the group may present 
difficulties for him in finding acceptance with his peers, 
although he appears to en;joy the company of others. George 
may have some problems in finding a place in the group struc¬ 
ture too, since he seems very sensitive and is not at ease with 
others. His pessimistic outlook would also hinder group 
relationships. Hugh is quiet, determined and prefers planning 
activities to participation in them. He tends to be critical 
of his associates and consequently may have difficulty in 
becoming part of the group. Ian is a quiet, thoughtful 
individual who likes to work alone. He feels that he does 
not get along well with others and so tends to submit to their 
will. Clifford and Frank are care-free, extroverted individuals. 
Frank, in particular, has a cheerful, optimistic outlook on 
life. He likes to dominate the group and be the center of 
attention. 

In aspects of personality other than those menticned here, 
the boys appeared to be in the average range. The three tests 
yielded comparable results in most areas. 

Adjustment Measurement 

The measures of personality just discussed yielded some 
insight into the various traits within the individual that 
influence his actions. The S.R.A. Youth Inventory attempts

individual marked a greater number of problems in a given area 
than did the norm group* Alan was in the average range in all 
areas except About ^^yself, in idiich he had a very low score*

new in the group, did not wish to reveal his proble/ns at that 
time. Bob, on the other hand, had very high scares in all 
problem areas. He is \mder considerable pressure from his 
parents to succeed in school in an academic pattern in which 
he has limited ability and little interest. This difficulty 
may be fundamental to his problems in other areas. These 
results appear consistent with the measures of personality 
which suggest that Bob tends to be depressed, tense and 
anxious* Clifford had an average or low score in all areas. 
Since he planned to leave school in the spring, and had 
secured a job, he made an extremely low score in the area 
After High School. This may also accoimt for his low score 
on the scale My School. Although Clifford had difficulties 
in this area the fact that he planned to leave soon seemed to 
ease the problem for him. Dennis was in the average range for 
most of the problem areas. He did not check any statements 
in the section Boy Meets Girl. This might indicate a lack of 
interest on his part, but considering that he is not pbpular 
with the girls of the high school, it seems likely that he is 
refusing to reveal his problems. This may be another illus¬ 
tration of his independent attitude. Dennis checked only one 
item in the About Myself and it seems likely again that he was 
not interested in indicating his difficulties. E!ric had 
average scores on all parts of the test except the Horae and 
Family in -^jhich he had a low score and Health which was high. 
The low score is in keeping with his attitude concerning his 
home as expressed on the Sims Score Card for Socio-Economic 
Status. Frank had a high score in the area About Myself which

suggests that he is possibly not satisfied with himself at 
present and feels a need for guidance. He did not check any 
problems in the section Boy Meets Girl and while he is better 
adjusted socially than most in the class, this score still 
appears rather low* George had average scores in all areas 
except After High School which is low* Since he has at least 
two more years of high school due to failure in several grade 
ten courses, the problem may appear somewhat remote* Hugh is 
particiilarly high on the scale After High School* His poor 
health may be the cause of this score and since his activities 
are restricted, he may entertain serious concern over his 
ability to fit into adult society* Hugh also had a high 
score in the section Health* Ian had a pattern of high 
average or high scores on all parts of this test* It may be 
that his home life is the basic cause of his difficulties* 

His mother has poor mental health and his brother was recently 
placed in a Provincial Boys’ Home* The pressure of these 
situations may be the cause of his insecurity. In addition, 
Ian’s tendency toward submissiveness and his lack of self- 
assurance, as suggested by the personality tests, could 
also contribute to his adjustment problems* 

A noticeable feature of the test is the pattern of 
high scores on the Health scale. This may be due to the scale 
itself which allows freer response without revealing data of a 
personal nature* On the other hand, it may be due to an 
increased interest in health and personal appearance brought 
about by a mounting interest in social activities*

The Basic Difficulty Score, an experimental scale designed 
to indicate those who might have serious personality difficulties, 
suggests that Bob and Ian may be in this category. This con¬ 
clusion appears to be borne out by the other measures of 
personality made during this study. 

In general it may be said that Alan, Clifford and Frank, 
who had the highest scores on the Emotional Stability scales 
of the personality tests, tended to check fewer problems on 
the Youth Inventory. The boys of a reflective nature, Hugh, 

Ian, Bob and George, seemed to have more problems in the area 
Getting Along with Others. Eric is the exception to this 
statement, but as was indicated in the Gordon Personal Pro¬ 
file, he tends to rate himself more favorably than seems 
warranted. There seems to be a good agreement between the 
results of the personality tests and the reaction of the 
individuals to their environment as expressed on the S.R.A. 

Youth Inventory. 


The Rotter Incomplete Sentences Blank 

The sentence con^letion method of studying personality is a 
semistructxjred projective technique in which the subject is 
asked to finish a sentence for ^ich the first word or words 
are supplied. As in other projective devices, it is assumed 
that the subject reflects his own wishes, desires, fears and 
attitudes in the sentences he makes.^3 

The test is designed to yield a total score that is an 
index of maladjustment. In this study, however, no numerical

score was deteiTnined. The results were used to investigate 
the feelings of the individual toward various situations in 
his life# Using the test in this manner it was felt that it 
should be of some assistance in understanding the roles taken 
by the boys in their group activities. 

From his responses, Alan apparently found satisfaction 
in his home life. He appeared to be closely attached to his 
mother but mde no mention of his father, who is deceased. This 
might be indicative of a lack of adjustment to this situation. 
His favorable responses were in agreement with the results in 
this section of the Youth Inventory. Socially Alan enjoyed 
the company of boys and, with reservations, girls. He 
appreciated the social values of dancing but did not indicate 
whether he participated in this activity. Reading was named 
as his favorite pastime as might be expected of a shy, quiet 
boy and he expressed an interest in sports although he 
participated in curling. There was some indication that he 
felt socially inferior to his classmates, for one incomplete 
response was, “Other kids have more...” He made several 
responses that suggested concern about success in school 
and, in fact, any undertaking. Examples of this are^. “I 
wish that i could have better marks in school”, and “My 
greatest fear is to try something and fail.” This may be a 
further indication of feelings of inadequacy. Generally his 
responses to the test showed that he did not accept himself 
completely and had definite feelings of insecurity in social 
situations, perhaps due to the fact that he was not well 
received by the group as indicated in the sociometric tests.

These findings were not in agreement with the personality and 
adjustment measurements* According to the Gordon Personal 
Profile Alan tended to be over-critical of himself and this 
may account for the results on the Rotter. In addition, the 
Rotter Incomplete Sentences Blank was given early in the year 
and Alan may not have become acquainted with the new school 
at the time of its administration. This could be the cause 
of his feelings of insecurity. 

On the test Bob did not reveal much concerning his 
home life. He did not mention hd-S mother which may indicate 
a conflict although he stated that he was happy at home. He 
showed a preference for many solitary activities such as 
hunting, fishing and readi.ng, which is not in agreement mth 
the high sociability scores he made on the Gordon -Personal Pro¬ 
file and the Thurstone Temperament Schedule or with the indi¬ 
cations of his popularity with the boys on the sociometric 
tests. Bob expressed an interest in dancing but pointed out 
in several instances that he was not an accomplished dancer. 

He was concerned with the problem of vocational choice and 
also with success at school. The main attitudes revealed 
from the test appear to be dissatisfaction with school for he 
said on one occasion, wish that I was finished school and 
had a good job«, and feelings of inadequacy in social situa¬ 
tions. His rather inconsistent pattern of responses may also 
indicate insecurity. 

Clifford*s responses suggested that he has a satisfactory 
home life, which agreed with his score on the Youth Inventory. 
His interests centered around rural activities in which he

preferred the company of boys* Clifford liked to read 
and also enjoyed team sports wiiich he finds of value. This 
may suggest a balance between solitary and group leisure time 
interests. He expressed concern over his failure in his 
subjects and appears to be dissatisfied wd-th school as a whole, 
stating ”At school I am not content*”, and ”The only trouble 
I have is in school work”* The fact that he did not check 
many problems in this area on the Youth Inventory may mean 
that they have risen since its admind.stration* Clifford made 
references to feelings of tiredness and restlessness which 
was definitely opposed to the traits indicated on the per¬ 
sonality tests* This may be due to boredom at school* Other 
than this his average pattern of responses was consistent with 
data from other personality tests and the S.R.A. Youth 
Inventory. 

Dennis showed some dissatisfaction with his home. He 
apparently preferred his father to his mother and since she 
was the dominant parent, this worild suggest a conflict in 
this area. Throughout his responses there was frequent men¬ 
tion of his interest in solitary activities. This may be a 
rationalization on his part since his statement, “People i^o 
think they are above one another should be let live in eqxial 
conditions,” suggested that he felt socially inferior to some 
of his classmates and also he said, like to make friends 
everywhere I go.” Dennis did a considerable amount of reading 
which he said, “helps me to relax and forget any problems I 
have.” He had a high estimation of his ability to cope with 
any situation, stating, ”I am best when it comes to an

emergency and something has to be done fast." Dennis also 
expressed a somewhat imrealistic desire for a lif'e full of 
enjoyment for himself in the future. Although Dennis did not 
write the other personality tests, some traits were revealed 
tlirough the Rotter that contribute to an understanding of this 
boy. He had an attitude of independence that seemed to mask 
feelings of insecurity. He tended to be fairly active and to 
have a confident, optimistic view of the future. Dennis also 
appeared to have a tendency to over-rate himself. He found 
escape from unsatisfactory situations through reading. 

Eric showed definite preference for his father in his 
responses, stating, "I secretly think he is the best person I 
know", and made no comment on his mother. His other state¬ 
ments suggested that he was very much satisfied with his home 
life and felt contented there. He stated that he enjoyed the 
company of others and felt that he got on well with them, yet 
he preferred solitary leisure-time activities. He expressed 
an interest in sports although he did not seem to participate 
in them. His statement, "...the happiest time is at home", 
may suggest a feeling that he is not accepted by the grovp, a 
situation that appeared to be verified by the results of the so- 
cicmetric tests. Eric also expressed the desire to "...learn 
more about understanding people." This may be due to his wish 
to become part of the group. His greatest interest appeared 
to be flying and he was quite concerned about his chances for 
success in this area* Eric*s responses seemed to suggest traits 
similar to those revealed by personality and adjustment tests.

Frank gave little indication of his attitude tovjard his 
home. Since his parents had separaled and he lived vath his 
mother, his preference for this parent seemed understandable# 
Frank*s mother was very demanding, so his statement, **My 
greatest fear is a woman”, may have reference to her. Frank 
was active in sports and preferred male companions. He 
expressed greater concern over social adjustment than any of 
the other boys, stating, ”I need to conquer my self-conscious¬ 
ness”, and also, ”I wish I was another Rock Hudson!” He 
enjoyed dancing and was accepted by girls in social activities, 
although he mentioned, ”I suffer from being nervous when I am 
with members of the opposite sex#” This would seem to be a 
typical adolescent adjustment situation. Frank*s main problem 
seemed to be making satisfactory school marks, although he 
knew that his lack of application was the cause of his trouble. 
Except for some vagueness concerning his home life, Frank *s 
responses appeared to be typical of a reasonably secure 
adolescent. 

George indicated satisfaction with his fajnily and home 
life. He had limited interest in social activities involving 
boys and girls and said that he did not like to mix with 
people generally# This may have had some influence on his 
position in the group, as revealed by the sociometrin tests. 
George mentioned sports in several instances and seemed to find 
some measure of recognition and security through participation 
in these. Other than in the athletic program George appeared 
to find little satisfaction in school. He was concerned with 
his failure but did not attempt to account for this. He

expressed fear of getting caught in one instance, although no 
specific situation was mentioned, which may be indicative of an 
insecure position in the group* George experienced some 
difficulty in completing the test and his responses generally 
suggested discouragement. For the most part the results of 
the Rotter seemed to be in agreement with the other measures 
of personality used in this study. 

Hugh wrote this test while in the hospital and conse¬ 
quently many responses are influenced by this situation. The 
main purpose of his hospitalization was to restrict his physical 
activity. He did not reveal arching definite concerning his 
home life on the test. He stated that he preferred solitary 
leisure-time activities, although he was not specific in this. 

A negative attitude toward people was revealed since his 
responses were of a critical nature. He noted that ’’At school 
most kids don*t know what a good education means”, and,“People 
aren>t aware of what is going on around them.” This trait 
was consistent with the scores on the Guilford-Ziramerman, but 
not with the fact that he appeared well accepted on the first 
sociometric test. Hugh was concerned with the problem of 
choosing a vocation and he seemed to have difficulty in 
accepting himself. His \mdue concern with his health and 
related problems reduced the effectiveness of the test in 
measuring his attitudes. Many of the responses appeared 
designed to reveal nothing of a personal nature. This might 
suggest a tendency toward withdrawal on his part. 

That Ian was iinder pressure from his mother was indicated 
by his statement, ”A mother likes her children to become

something big.” Most of his responses centered around the 
school situation. Ian was having difficulty here and suggested 
several reasons for his trouble, such as, ”I need to become 
more familiar with study habits”, and ”The only trouble with 
me is that I don’t study enough.” In spite of an expressed 
knowledge of the value of an education, Ian appeared qviite 
discouraged with his present position, stating, ”I wish some¬ 
times that I was out of school working.” He was caught be¬ 
tween his desire to please his mother by achieving well at 
school and his own inability to cope with the subject matter. 
This could be fundamental to his difficulties, and may be 
responsible for the scores on the personality tests and Youth 
Inventory suggesting possible maladjustment. His interest in 
university would suggest that he was not judging himself 
realistically. Socially, he was becoming interested in the 
opposite sex, but mentioned that he was not well accepted 
by the girls of the class. Ian expressed an interest in 
sports and such solitary pastimes as fossil hunting, sketching 
and reading. The latter activities seemed to occupy most of 
his spare time. This appears to be inconsistent with the 
restilts of the sociometric tests which showed Ian to be 
popular both as a seatmate and in out-of-school activities. 

In general, the responses to the Rotter would suggest that 
the school situation and possibly the influence of the mother 
were causes of conflict. 

The Rotter Incomplete Sentences Blank appeared to be an 
effective device with which to determine the attitudes and 
behavior of this group. The responses to this test show that.

for the most part, the individual’s actions are consistent 
with the personality patterns found by the tests discussed 
earlier* The Rotter, however, allox-fs a different view of the 
individual and affords an opportunity to verify the other 
measures* 


Vocational Interests 

As another measure of adjustment an attempt will be made 
to compare the ability and vocational preferences of the 
individual id.th his interests as expressed on the Kuder 
Preference Record* It would seem that the well-adjusted 
individual should show some agreement in these areas* The 
percentiles achieved by the group on the Kuder Preference 
Record are found in Table Twelve* 

The preferred vocation and the ability of the indivi¬ 
dual as indicated by the Otis Quick Scoring Mental Ability 
Test are summarj^d in Table Thirteen* 

In view of Alan’s high scores in the Mechanical and 
Clerical areas of the Kuder, his choice of teaching as a 
career does not seem to agree with his interests. His shy, 
sutanissive tendencies revealed by the personality tests 
might present some obstacles to a teaching career* He has 
high ability however, and is young, so there may be a further 
change in interests before a decision is made* 

Bob named the R.C.M.P* as his vocational choice* Although 
this selection is not inconsistent with his pattern of 
interests on the Kuder scales and appears suited to his ability, 
Bob’s personality traits of depression, anxiety and irresponsi¬ 
bility might present difficulties for him in the achievement

Clifford*s low rating on the Outdoor and Mechanical areas 
makes one question the wisdom of his choice of farming* His 
ability is average and he should be successful in his under¬ 
takings, but the Kuder wuld suggest that he would be happier 
in another field, such as accountant, salesman or bank clerk* 
To do a good job in any position Clifford would likely have 
to develop a more serious attitude rather than his present 
care-free outlook*

Eric, -with above average ability and high score in the 
Mechanical scale, should find some area of the airforce 
that is satisfying to him. He should be qiiite successful 
working by himself, but his self-centered, critical attitude, 
which contributed to his lack of acceptance in this group, 
would likely hinder him in assuming positions of responsibility 
in the airforce. 

A high score in the Mechanical, Computation and Scienti¬ 
fic areas of the Kuder, coupled with his high ability, should 
enable Frank to succeed in some field of engineering, his 
chosen vocation. He will have to develop a more serious 
attitude toward his schoolvjork and become somewhat more 
responsible in his activities to be successful in attaining 
his goal.

George has an interest pattern somewhat like Frank* s, 
but he has less ability. He is unlikely to attain Iiis ambi¬ 
tion as an engineer, but may be able to enter a technical 
occupation related to his interests which does not require 
university training. Being rather pessimistic in his outlook, 
George may not have the drive necessary to complete the 
training for such a position. 

Hugh has high interests in the Mechanical, Computational 
and Musical areas on the Kuder and has above average ability. 
He has not expressed any preference for his life work, but 
does plan to attend university. Hugh is concerned with the 
problem of vocational choice, according to the S.R.A. Youth 
Inventory, but is not willing, apparently, to take the 
initiative to find a solution. 

Ian would like to be a geologist but his ability rating 
would suggest that this is unlikely. His only high score 
on the Kuder was in the i^tistic area. Some adjustment will 
have to be made on his part to reconcile ambition and ability. 
It seems likely that if the pressure from home for high 
achievement were removed, Ian would be more realistic in his 
approach to vocational choice. 

Alan and Clifford were the only boys whose vocational 
choices differed somewhat from the results of the Kuder 
Preference Record. George and Ian seem to neglect to consider 
their ability in their choice of occupations. In both 
instances some adjustment will have to be made between these 
factors. Likely some vocation can be found in the area of 
their interests that will not require iiniversity training.

Bob*s personality traits may cause him some difficulty in 
attaining his goal as a policeroan. Although he seemed quite 
definite in his choice during the interview, his high score 
on the S.R.A# Youth Inventory suggests that perhaps he is 
still not certain in his vocational choice. Ian and Hugh 
were also high on the Youth Inventory scale After High School. 
Ian’s difficulty seems to center about his low ability, while 
Hugh has not as yet selected a vocation. On the whole, it 
would appear that the vocational choices of the group and the 
occupations suggested by their interest pattern on the Kuder 
Preference Record are fairly closely related. 

The results of the measurements discussed in this chapter 
yield some insight into the personality and adjustment of 
the boys. Before considering their position in the structure 
of the group, reference will be made to the results of more 
subjective measurement. Together, these data should assist 
in the interpretation of the roles assumed by the individual. 








CHAPTER VIII 


FURTHER INSIGHT INTO THE GROUP MEMBERS 

In this chapter further attempts mil be made to determine 
the attitudes and behavior of the group members. The material 
for this chapter comes flrom more subjective measures than the 
objective tests discussed in Chip ter Seven. These sources 
include: achievement, teachers* observations, the Guess Mho 
test, leisure time activities and autobiographies written 
by the students. This information together with the earlier 
results should prove helpful in understanding the roles of 
the individuals in the group. 

Achievement 

To indicate the achievement of the members of this group 
in their academic work, a comparison will be made of their 
ability as measured by the Otis Mental Ability Test and their 
marks on five academic subjects studied in grade ten. The 
summary of these data is given in Table Fourteen. 

With an I.Q. of 121, Alan*s average of sixty-three seemed 
to suggest he was not appliring himself to his studies. His 
fear of failure in school as expressed on the Rotter Incom¬ 
plete Sentences Blank was evidently not strong enough to make 
him produce results in keeping with his ability.

''‘‘llark when course repeated* 


Bob was handicapped in the acadeirdc courses by his limited 
ability and the pressure applied from his parents* His low 
Responsibility score on the Gordon Personal profile, suggesting 
a lack of persistence may also contribute to his under¬ 
achievement* His tendencies toward anxiety and nervousness 
would likely prove detrimental during examinations. V/ith an 
I.Q. of 100, Bob had an average of thirty-one.

own assessment of his disinterest in school seemed to be borne 

out in his marks* He repeated all grade ten courses except 
social studies and, although he had an I.Q. of one hundred, 
his average was only forty-fo\ir* These results were also in 
keeping with Clifford*s low score on the Thoughtfulness scale 
of the Giiilford-Zimmerman Temperament Survey* 

Dennis was another class member who did not work up to 
his ability having an I*Q* of 120 and a grade ten average of 
thirty-six* Because he enjoyed reading he made his best mark 
in literature, idiich was fifty, otherwise a lack of interest 
and applicant produced a pattern of low marks* Continued 
pressure from home, where he had an adjustment problem, coupled 
with his independent attitude could have contributed to this 
situation too* 

Eric*s results in grade ten were not all available. It 
was known, however, that he failed language and mathematics 
and had a low mark in science* He showed some improvement on 
repeating these courses but with an I*Q* of 111, cou±d have 
made better grades* Eric appeared to over-estimate his 
ability to handle his courses, a tendency supported by his 
high total score on the Gordon Personal Profile* 

Prank, who was capable of the best work, was a rather 
indifferent student. He did little stuc^ out-of-school and 
would not do the required reading for literature, with the 
result that he failed that course* This year he registered 
to take Literature Ten by correspondence but disqualified 
himself by not keeping up with the assignments* His attitude 
toward school is consistent with the teachers’ observations

and the students’ evaluation of him as indicated on the Guess 
Who test. It also would tend to confirm his tendencies toward 
irresponsibility as suggested by the Gordon Personal Profile. 

George repeated all his academic courses from grade ten 
except mathematics. The results suggested that he did not 
apply himself since, with an I.Q. of 102, his average was 
forty-seven. His rather pessimistic outlook seemed to produce 
in George the attitude that since he had not passed the first 
time, it x-zas unlikely that he would succeed after repeating 
the courses. It seemed improbable that George would achieve 
a matriculation standing. 

Hugh was the only boy in the class besides Alan to pass 
all his grade ten courses. His results were more closely 
related to his ability than any of the other cases since, 
with an I.Q. of HO, he made an average of fifty-six in 
grade ten. His success might be due in part to his persevering, 
determined attitude suggested by his high score on the Responsi¬ 
bility scale of the Gordon Personal profile. 

Ian was limited in his school work by his low ability and 
his personal problems, particularly the pressure from his 
mother. With an I.Q. of 96, his achievement in literature, 
language and social studies, where he averaged forty-three, 
appeared reasonable. He will have to make an adjustment in 
his vocational choice, since it does not appear possible for 
him to attain matricxilation standing. 

With the exception of Hugh and possibly Ian and Alan, the 
members of this class might be classified as under-achievers 
in their academic work. In the cases of Bob and Ian, personal

problems centering at home might contribute to their low grades. 
As far as the others were concerned, however, a lack of interest 
and application seemed to be the reason for this situation. 

Teachers* Observations 

During the period of investigation the teaching staff 
submitted their comments on the boys of the grade eleven class. 
T/Jhile they were not always consistent with the other measure¬ 
ments they yield some insight into the behavior of the group. 

Alan, the youngest boy in the group, came to the high school 
this year from a smaller country school. Because of the 
cycling of subjects in the previous year, he was taking chiefly 
grade ten courses. The personality tests suggested that he 
was quiet and exhibited a tendency toward shyness and submis¬ 
siveness. The teachers reported that he was bright and pleas¬ 
ing in class and appeared to be well adjusted to the new school. 
Although he was passing all his tests, there was some doubt 
that he was achieving as well as he might since his I.Q. was 
121 and his average in five grade ten academic courses was 
only sixty-three. 

Bob was felt to be at his limit academically in grade 
eleven. He was described as a sociable person with a pleasant 
personality but not thoroughly reliable. The objective measures 
yielded results that suggested that he was tense, anxious and 
depressed. They also indicated that he was considerate and got 
on well with others, traits already noted by the teachers.

Clifford was not academically inclined nor interested in 
school according to the staff, an observation verified by the 
Otis Mental Ability Test and his responses on the Rotter 
Incomplete Sentences Blank. He had an I.Q. of one hundred, 
and, after repeating four courses, an average in grade ten of 
forty-four. An active, impulsive individual according to the 
personality tests, he no doubt found the discipline of the 
school difficult to bear. Clifford’s plan to get a job and 
leave school was considered by the teachers as evidence of 
acceptance of his limitations. He was the oldest boy in the 
class and appeared to get on well w:j-th adults. He was felt 
to be somewhat limited in his social development but appeared 
on the sociometric tests to be fairly well received by his 
classmates. His Group-Social-Distance score indicated that he 
was the most accepted boy in the group. 

The staff felt that the chief difficulty in Dennis* 
life was his unsatisfactory home. This conclusion seemed to 
be borne out in his responses to the Rotter Incomplete 
Sentences Blank. He was recognized as above average in 
ability and had an I.Q. of 120. He neglected his studies 
to such an extent that he failed most of his courses and this 
consequently destroyed any interest tiiat he might have had in 
school, ^flaile Dennis appeared to mature somewhat during the 
past year, the teachers felt that he still had problems in the 
area of social adjustment. This seemed to be reflected in 
his high Group-Social-Distance score idiich indicated that he 
was not well accepted by his classmates.

Eric was described by the teachers as a friendly, pleasant, 
socially raatui’e person* The sociometric tests, however, suggest¬ 
ed that he was not well accepted by the group. From the per¬ 
sonality profiles Eric appeared to be a quiet, thoughtful 
individual with a critical, somewhat hostile outlook. He was 
repeating two grade ten courses and although he had an I.Q. of 
111, he was not achieving satisfactory results because of a 
lack of application. His chief interest was flying and since 
a knovjledge of mathematics is required for this he put forth 
greater effort in this area than in his other courses. 

I 

The staff felt that Frank roight suffer from a poor home 
background. Since his parents had separated he lived with his 
mother, a Yerj domineering woman. Some indication of this was 
found in Frank's responses on the Rotter. There had been some 
improvement in his attitude toward school in the past year 
but still Frank did not assume the responsibilities in student 
activities that one of his ability should. This trait was 
suggested on the Gordon Personal Profile where he had a low 
score on the Responsibility scale. Frank had high ability, 
with I.Q. of 123 , but was underachieving through 3a.ck of 
effort. His average in the grade ten academic courses was 
only fifty-two* It was suggested that his sensitiveness to 
the pressixres of the group might be a cause of this, although 
there was no verification for it in the results of the 
personality tests. 

George v;as considered by the teachers to be both social¬ 
ly and intellectually immature. From the results of the 
sociometric tests it appeared that his classmates shared this 




91 


observation since George did not receive inany choices. He is 
younger than the class average and the results of the Guilford- 
Zimmerman Temperament Survey seemed to suggest that he was 
hypersensitive and felt that he did not get on vjell with others. 
These traits might produce withdrawal tendencies that would lead 
to the teachers^ observations. George was pleasant and co¬ 
operative in class but was not likely to succeed in an academic 
program. His I.Q. was 102 and his average in the grade ten 
courses was forty-seven, even after repeating four of them. 

From the personality measures used, Hugh appeared to be a 
quiet, persevering individual. He seemed rather critical of 
others and might not get on well with them. The teachers 
described Hugh as a pleasant, socialQy adjusted, able student. 
His I.Q. was 110, verifying the latter observation. Although 
he missed two months of school this year, it was felt that his 
determination would enable him to pass his courses. The time 
spent on his studies, however, caused him to lose status in the 
group. He was an isolate on two of the sociometric tests. 

Ian appeared to be a quiet, submissive boy, who was 
under considerable pressure from home for academic success. 

This observation was given confirmation through Ian*s responses 
on the Rotter Incomplete Sentences Blank. The teachers felt 
that Ian had matured this year and to some extent had overcome 
the adverse influences of his home. He was pleasant and 
cooperative in school. Although limited in ability with an 
I.Q. of ninety-six, it was felt that Ian wouid profit from 
continued attendance at school, at least in the area of social 
growth.

Those students considered to be socially adjusted by the 
teachers were not so rated by the members of the group. Iii*om 
their descriptions of the boys it woiold appear that the teachers 
used somewhat different methods in evaluating adjustment. In 
written reports on the boys all the teachers tended to regard 
as well adjusted those who had high scores on the Reflective 
scale of the Thurstone Teirperajiient Schedule* Such individuals 
are quiet, retiring and conforming in nature. This would 
suggest that, rather than naming the well adjusted boys, the 
teachers mentioned those who were not discipline problems in 
the classroom. 


The Guess Who Test 

In the Guess Who test the class was given brief des¬ 
criptions of beha^dor and the members were asked to name those 
of their classmates whom they felt were most closely described 
in each instance. A trait was considered to be typical of an 
individual if he was identified by his school mates five or 
more times. 

Two versions of the Guess Who test were given to the 
grade eleven class during the year. From these certain 
behavioral traits of the boys were revealed. Frank was 
mentioned most frequently and was identified with these 
characteristics: always wants Id.s own way, always has some¬ 
thing to say, Hkes to taHJk a lot, likes jokes even on himself, 
often influences the group in their activities, really seems 
to enjoy life, wants to be the center of attention all the 
time, puts studies last. These resuilts appeared quite con-

sistent with the results of the personality tests which 
described Frank as being active, extroverted, optimistic, 
cheerful and one who tended to dominate his fellovrs. The 
comments of the teachers would tend to verify the last charac¬ 
teristic. 

Ian was described as being considerate of others, co¬ 
operative and even-tempered. The first trait was not in 
keeping with the data from the personality tests which sug¬ 
gested that Ian was critical of others. The co-operativeness 
mentioned might be a reflection of lan^s tendency to be sub¬ 
missive. 

Eric was felt to be unco-operative and a complainer. The 
personality test results tended to bear out these observations 
since Eric was found to be critical and self-centered. 

Of the boys identified with only one trait on the Guess 
"Who, George was named as one who acted younger than he really 
was. This is in accord i-dth the report of the teachers and 
might account for George* s lack of acceptance by the group. 
Clifford is rated as one who puts his studies last, a trait 
reflected in his achievement and confirmed by his responses 
on the Rotter. Bob was found to be one who liked jokes, even 
on himself, a characteristic which may be due to his desire 
to get on well with others, but is difficult to reconcile with 
his low scores in Emotional Stability as measured by the per¬ 
sonality tests. 

The other boys were mentioned on various parts of the 
test but not with sufficient frequency to indicate significant 
behavior traits. The agreement of these findings with the

results of the personality tests suggested that the boys 
evaluated their peers fairly accurately, at least as far as 
the outstanding aspects of behavior were concerned. 

Extra-Curricular and Leisure Time Activities 
The effective use of leisure time might be considered an 
indication of the adjustment of the individual. During inter¬ 
views the matter of these activities was discussed. The 
most preferred activities are shown in Table Fifteen,

Alan did not name a hobby and the only leisure activity 
he mentioned was curling. The Rotter revealed also that he 
enjoyed reading. The lack of many group activities was in 
keeping with his personality traits of shyness and quietness. 

Bob collected coins in hisIYee time, belonged to the reserve 
army, curled and enjoyed the more individual sports of hunting, 
fishing and golf. The emphasis on solitary activities was not 
in accord with his high popularity with the group as revealed

by the sociometric tests. It might indicate his lack of 
acceptance of this situation, a further suggestion of feelings 
of insecurity* 

Clifford cared for livestock on the farm and read and 
participated in several sports* This balance between group and 
individual activities might be indicative of good adjustment* 

He was a member of the high school student council this year 
but did little while in office, suggesting that Clifford is 
somewhat irresponsible, although he made an average score in 
this trait on the Gordon Personal Profile* 

The chief leisure time activities mentioned by Dennis 
were reading and playing pool* As was noted in the Rotter, 
Dennis read excessively, finding an escape from his actual 
difficulties through this* He played football and basketball 
vjith the high school as well and through these activities he 
received some recognition, although according to the Classroom 
Social Distance Scale, he was not well accepted by the group. 

Eric listed aircraft modelling, photography and stamp 
collecting as his hobbies. He stated that he enjoyed reading, 
playing football and basketball and curling, but of the sports, 
he was active only in curling* His choice of individual ac¬ 
tivities might be indicative of his lack of acceptance in the 
group, where the members did not care for his critical, self- 
centered attitude. 

Frank built model aircraft in his free time. He also 
liked to play basketball, curl, dance and play pool* The 
emphasis on activities with others is consistent with his

personality trait of extroversion and his preference for the 
company of others as indicated on the Rotter Incomplete 
Sentences Blank. 

George stated that his hobby was the construction of 
model aircraft. He was active in most of the athletic teams 
in the school. Through this activity he gained some measure 
of recognition, but his lack of the social interests common 
in the group seemed to prevent his selection on the socio¬ 
metric tests. 

Hugh named woodwork, leatherwork and music as his main 
leisure time activities, choices consistent with his inactive, 
quiet nature and no doubt influenced by his health problem. 

The fact that he did not share interests with the group 
members, together with his absence from school, might account 
for his isolation on two of the sociometric tests. 

Ian collected rocks and fossils in the Badlands in his 
free time. He was a member of the junior band, reserve army 
and the curling club. In view of his popularity with the 
boys it seemed strange that Ian did not express greater 
interest in group activities. This difference might be an 
indication of the insecurity he felt as noted by his high 
scores on the S.R.A. Youth Inventory. 

All the boys named at least one hobby except Alan and 
Dennis. Athletics were by far the most preferred leisure time 
activity, being mentioned by all the boys except Hugh. Alan, 
Bob, Eric, Hugh and Ian, who tended to be high on the 
Thoughtfulness scale of the Guilford-Zimmerman Temperament 
Survey and the Reflective scale of the Thurstone Temperament

Schedule, appeared to choose activities of a solitary nature® 
The more active boys, Clifford and Franlc, had strenuous 
activities in their choices as an outlet for their energy* In 
general the less accepted boys had more interests that could 
be satisfied on their own and appeared to be more active in 
them. Frank, the most gregarious of the boys, expressed an 
interest in group activities. Most of the behavior of the 
members of the group appeared to be in keeping with existing 
information. 


Analysis of Autobiographies 

During the period of study the members of the class 
were asked to write autobiographies in the hope that some of 
their attitudes about themselves and their associates might 
be revealed. The titles given were: »A Freshie View— 

First Impressions of High School” and ”What a Difference a 
Year Makes”, in ^lich the student was asked to express how 
he felt he had changed diiring the past year. 

In his first autobiography Bob expressed an early dislike 
for high school because of the different approach made by the 
teachers. This would appear consistent with his personality 
ratings. One who is insecure and nervous would likely be 
resistant to change. He did not like the initiation program 
since the outlandish costumes for the freshmen brought him 
into the centre of attention. As he is rather serious in 
temperament his comments on the rowdy behavior of some of 
his associates and the lack of discipline in the school are 
not unexpected. During his writing he described the kindness

of the students in welcoming a new member to the class* Since 
he himself was not a new student, the mention of this situation 
may be interpreted as an expression of his need for acceptance. 
A comment revealing an awakening social interest and some 
desire to overcome his shortcomings was "There could possibly 
be more school parties to help the students get out and dance 
so they won*t be shy." 

In his second autobiography, Bob showed a more matiire 
approach to his school career with a re-assessment of his 
future aims and the expressed intent of doing better schoolwork. 
He also stated that he enjoys the company of adults very much. 
This may suggest a feeling of insecurity when in his peer 
group. He commented finally on the value of friendships. It 
seems to be a reasonable state of mind for Bob since he must 
appreciate the sense of belonging that his friends give him. 
Generally the attitudes expressed in his autobiographies appear 
to be consistent with the infonriation obtained about him in 
the measures discussed ear-lier. 

Clifford was not enthusiastic about the autobiographies. 

His contribution in the first instance was very brief and 
revealed little information of value except that he was 
extremely dissatisfied mth school. This is in agreement with 
the teachers’ observations and his responses on -the Rotter 
Incomplete Sentences Blank. Clifford would not submit a second 
autobiography'-. 

In his writing, Dennis showed disinterest in school by 
commenting, "As a whole, things went along just as they had 
every other year.” He revealed an intense dislike for 



99 


authority which, it is thought, had its origin in his home 
life. He enjoyed the school parties, athletic activities and 
dramatics, but these were the only aspects of school that were 
satisfying. Dennis was critical of a certain group of his 
classmates whom he classified as "•..those who like to be 
big wheels, but aren’t," suggesting that he is aware of his 
lack of acceptance socially. This problem was not revealed 
on the louth Inventory, possibly because he did not want to 
admit its existence. Dennis also did not sxibmit a second 
autobiography. 

In his writing, Eric maintained an impersonal tone for 
the most part. He was rather critical of the group in some 
instances, ^^diich is in agreement with the results of the 
Guilford-Zimmerman Temperapient Survey. An indication of some 
feelings of insecurity was revealed in his statement that at 
school "...there were always some older ones pushing the 
yoiinger ones around." He concludes his first autobiography 
by stating that he "...was able to get along with everyone 
and everjiihing went just swell." This would seem to be 
typical of his method of evaluation and rather inconsistent 
■vjith his earlier remarks. In his second autobiography he 
expressed the realization that he had not done a satisfactory 
job in his first year in high school and his intention of 
doing better this year. His absorption with the cadet 
movement as an out-of-school activity is stressed to the 
exclusion of almost all other information. He did not reveal 
anjrthing significant concerning his personal life.

The spirit in which France wrote his autobiography revealed 
much about his nature. It was in a breezy, confident, enter¬ 
taining style, traits that fit Frank as noted in the personality 
tests. He painted a very bright picture of his first year in 
high school. He particularly enjoyed the initiation ceremonies 
where he could be the center of the attention of ttie whole 
school. During the year he found his associates pleasant and 
easy to get along with. His second autobiography revealed 
a more matiure approach to the school, an attitude noted by 
the entire staff. He was aware of his acceptance by his 
peers and seemed to appreciate it. He felt that his interests 
had broadened and that he was beginning to fit into adult 
society. On the whole Frankoutlook and attitudes seemed 
to reflect those determined by the personality and adjustment 
measurements. 

George felt that he did not fit into the high school 
group at all. His close friends were all in lower grades 
and the social activities of his classmates were of no 
interest to him. This would seem to be in agreement with the 
teachers* feelings that George was socially immature and 
likely was the reason for his lack of acceptance as indicated 
on the sociometric tests. The initiation affected him much 
as it did Bob. It made him stand out, and that was particu¬ 
larly distasteful to him. He assessed the teachers chiefly 
from the point of view of their giving him feelings of con¬ 
fidence. This seemed to be further suggestion that George 
was insecure in his school life. His autobiography had a 
tone of despair throughout.

Ian wrote of general school conditions in his first 
autobiography, but did reveal that he felt that he was not 
accepted by the students in his former school. D\iring the 
year he moved to Brooks where he found conditions to be more 
pleasant. Previously he had been a vanned student and now, 
as a resident of the to\m he might feel a greater sense of 
belonging. The second autobiography also failed to produce 
much personal data. He mentioned mainly his interest in art 
and outdoor activities in which he spent much of his leisure 
time. These interests were in agreement with his scores on 
the Kuder Preference Record. Perhaps the fact that his 
activities in the group were not mentioned was indicative of 
his concern with problems in this area. He might be aware of 
these but be repressing them. 

There were no autobiographies for Hugh and Alan. Generally 
this manner of investigation did not meet with favorable 
response from, the boys. The exact cause of this is difficult 
to determine, li^ere co-operation was secured the results 
tended to substantiate the findings of the other measuring 
devices used in the stuc^. 

The material in this chapter seemed to bear out the 
findings of the more objective measures of personality and 
adjustment. The conclusions made by the teaching staff 
contribute a noteworthy exception. In written descriptions 
of the boys all the teachers tended to judge the quiet, con¬ 
forming student as well adjusted, which is not in agreement 
with either the test results, the individual's concept of 
himself or the judgements of the other students. Although

the boys did not respond on the autobiographies as well as they 
did on most of the other tests, it still proved a valuable 
source of infomation on the attitudes of the individual and 


his reaction to the group 







CHAPTER IX 


THE ROLE OF THE INDIVIDUAL IN THE PEER (HOUP 

From the discussion of the previous chapters it would 
seem that the members of the group are not all equal in status. 
Each has one or more roles to play in his interaction with 
his associates* In this chapter the following roles will be 
investigated: best friends^ popular persons, leaders, fol¬ 
lowers and isolates* Using the data available on the group 
members, an effort will be made to determine the traits of 
beha-'/ior and personality associated with these roles* 

Best Friends 

In paragraphs written by the group members on the topic, 
‘f&Jhy I like ray best friend,« certain traits desired in friends 
were revealed. A comparison between these and the actual 
traits found in the best friends of the members should indi¬ 
cate to some ext-ent the ability of the individual to assess 
his associates* A summary of these findings is given in

During the months of October, 1956 and March, 1957> 
interviews were held with the students at which they were asked 
to name their best friend. The choices made by the boys in 
October are shown in Figure Seven,

Mutual choice was considered the criterion in determining 
that a pair of boys were good friends. In this instance there 
were three pairs, Ian and Bob, PVank and Bob and Hugh and

Clifford, All the boys had one person in the group whom they 


considered to be their best friend. Bob was the only one to 
name two friends. 

Figure Eight has the results of the March interview. 



Figure 8,—Boys* Best Friends, Grade Eleven, 

Books High School, Itoch, 1957. 

The three original pairs of friends remained and no new ones 
have been established. There is some realignment of choice 
on the part of the other boys, Eric would not name anyone 
in the group as his best friend. Since the pairs of mutual 
choices remained constant, it was felt that this indicated 
a stable friendship in each instance. Some insight into the 
factors that influence these relationships may be revealed 
from a study of each pair of friends* 

Bob and Ian . Ian is six months older than Bob, Accord¬ 
ing to the Sims scales they come from the same social class 
level, but the socio-economic status of Ian’s home is lower 
than Bob’s, The boys have similar percentiles on the Guilford- 
Zimmerman Temperament Survey, except in the case of General 
Activity, where Ian is higher, indicating greater energy and

drive, and in the area Personal Relations, idiere Ian is very- 
much lower than Bob. The latter score suggests that Ian feels 
that he does not get along well with others while Bob is more 
at ease with people. Bob's interests tended to be more masculine 
in character than Ian's. The results of the Gordon Personal 
Profile showed a similar pattern for each boy. The Thurstone 
Temperament Schedule suggests that Ian is more thoughtful and 
more dominant than Bob. On all three tests both boys had 
low scores on the Emotional Stability scale, idth Bob being 
the lower of the two. On the S.R.A, Youth Inventory the 
pair checked a large number of problems in each area and both 
had high Basic Difficulty scores suggesting possible serious 
personality problems. In their leisure time Bob and Ian are 
inclined to favor solitary activities, but both also belong 
to the reserve army unit. At school they are having diffi- 
cul-ty in the academic program and feel dissatisfied with their 
progress. Both Bob and Ian have feelings of inadequacy in 
social situations. 

These boys appear to have fairly similar personality 
traits and adjus-bment problems. They share common interests 
and come from the same social class level. They are of like 
ability and achievement. On the whole the basis for friend- 
shjip in this instance appears to be the similarity of the two 
individuals. 

Bob and Frank . Bob and Frank come from the same social 
class level and their homes have the same socio-economic status 
as far as the Sims scales could determine. Bob is four months 
younger than Frank. The Guilford-Zirnmerman Temperament Survey

suggests that these boys exliibit opposite traits. In areas 
where Bob made a high score Frank was low and conversely when 
Frank was high. Bob had a lovj score. The test revealed also a 
common interest in masculine activities and a resistance to 
domination. The Gordon personal Profile suggested that the 
boys tended to be somewhat irresponsible. The Thin*stone 
Temperament Schedule seemed to bear out the Guilford-Zimmerman 
pattern of opposite traits. Frank indicated problems in the 
areas About Myself and Health on the S.R.A. Youth Inventory 
while Bob had problems in all areas. This would suggest that 
Frank is better adjusted than Bob. Frank is superior to Bob 
in mental ability and is making better progress in school. 
Through the Rotter Incomplete Sentences Blank, Frank revealed 
that he feels that he is well accepted by the group while 
Bob indicated feelings of insecurity. Bob tends to favor the 
solitarj^ type of out-of-school activity and Frank likes those 
involving the group. Frank is active in a variety of sports 
but except for curling, Bob is a spectator. 

The comparison of these two friends. Bob and Frank, 
suggests that there are few similarities in temperament and 
interest between them. Although the sociometric tests re¬ 
vealed that Bob is popular with his classmates, he does not 
seem to accept this situation and may compensate for his 
feelings of insecurity through Fra.nk's activities and- achieve¬ 
ments, Frank, an extrovert, is assured of the audience he 
needs and may also bask in the admiration of his friend, Tliis 
friendship may be termed a hero-and-worshipper relationship.

Hugh and Clifford . Clifford is nearly two years older 
than Hugh, They come from the same social class level accord¬ 
ing to the Sims S,C,I. Occupational Rating Scale and they both 
live on farms near Brooks, Clifford and Hugh come to school 
in the same van. Intelligence tests show that Hugh is 
superior in ability and at school he is doing adequate work 
while Clifford is not meeting with success, Hugh plans on a 
university education but Clifford intends to leave school 
this spring, Clifford seems much more active and impulsive 
than Hugh, he gets on better with his associates and tends to 
resist domination to a greater extent, Hugh appears quieter 
and more persistent tiian Clifford. Hugh’s leisure activities 
seem to be of a more solitarjr natiire than Clifford’s. 

The basis of this friendship may be their membership 
in the minority group of vanned students. The rural students 
tend to have difficulty in establishing social relations with 
the rest of the group and Hugh and Clifford may choose one 
another as a defense against possible rejection by the group. 

From this discussion it seem.s that the basis for friend¬ 
ship in the first instance is a similarity of personality traits 
and interests. Compensation and admiration may be the cause 
in the second case, and in the third, membership in a minority 
group appears to be important. In the latter two instances 
there seem to be few common personality traits between the 
friends. This suggests that wiiile personality may be important 
in some ca-ses, other factors, such as those mentioned above, 
may assume greater significance in the forma.tion of adolescent 
friendships.

Popular Persons 

The sociometric tests given during the study revealed 
that based on the total choices received, the most popular 
boys were Ian, Bob and Frank. The results of the personality 
and adjustment tests might lead one to expect that Frank would 
rank high in the eyes of his fellows. He is extroverted, full 
of energy, optimistic, cheerful, enjoys being with people and 
feels accepted by them. The high ranking of Bob and Ian is 
more difficult to explain. Although Bob felt that he gets on 
well with others, he did not feel secure in the group. The 
(juilford-Zimmeman Temperament Survey suggested that Ian felt 
that he did not get on well with others. Bob had low scores 
on the Emotional Stability scale of the three personality 
tests used, suggesting tendencies toward depression, nervous¬ 
ness and anxiety. Ian had low average scores in this area 
suggesting similar traits but to a lesser degree. Both boys 
were high or high average on the Activity scales on these 
tests. They had a pattern of high percentiles on the S.R.A. 
Youth Inventory suggesting difficulties in adjustment. Ian 
and Bob both tend to follow solitary interests rather than 
group activities in their leisure time. 

It would seem that the group used a different method for 
evaluating Bob and Ian to that used for Frank. It may be 
that Frank, who feels secure, is more particular in his choice 
of companions. The other boys in the group may feel that Bob 
and Ian, who are both close to Frank, are more likely to 
reciprocate their choices and that once they are accepted 
by one of these boys they will be in a better position to 








110 


establish relations with Frank, the dominant personality in 
the group. 

On the Classroom Social Distance Scale, Clifford appears 
to be the most accepted member of the group. His high status 
ma}^ be due to the fact that he had recently decided to leave 
school and get a job. This decision would likely enhance him 
in the eyes of those group members dissatisfied with school, 
but unable to stop. Because he is the oldest of the grou.p, 
he may appear to them to be more mature in his outlook and 
hence a more desirable person. He did not indicate many 
interests shared with the group except athletics and there 
his achievements were not sufficiently high to merit his 
selection on that basis alone. Clifford did have high scores 
on the Activity scales of the personality tests suggesting that 
he is an active, energetic individual. 

From the personality tests the only trait common to the 
popiilar people was their high score on the Activity scale 
suggesting that they are active, enthusiastic and energetic. 
Frank appeared to have been chosen on the strength of his 
positive personality traits. Bob and Ian might be poptilar 
through their close association with Frank. Clifford seemed 
to be highly rated his fellows through their identification 
with him in his decision to leave school. Intelligence does 
not seem to be significant in determining popularity since 
Frank is above average with an I.Q. of 123, Bob and Clifford 
have I.Q.’s of one hundred and Ian is below average with an 
I.Q. of ninety-six. All the popular boys were repeating grade 
ten courses, and, with the possible exception of Ian, were 
generally underachieving, which might suggest that to be popular

Leaders 

Although the group members felt that leadership varied 
somewhat according to the activity undertaken, they indicated 
that Frank was the leader most of the time. According to the 
personality and adjustment measurements, Frank is active, care¬ 
free, optimistic and cheerful. He likes to be with people, 
tends to dominate his associates and may lack tact in dealing 
with them. Frank has the highest mental ability of the boys, 
with an I.Q. of 123* The S.R.A. Youth Inventory suggested 
that Frank is concerned with problems about himself but other¬ 
wise showed satisfactory adjustment. According to the socio¬ 
metric tests, Frank is popular with his classmates. He feels 
at ease with others and accepted by the group. These character¬ 
istics generall 3 ^ agreed with earlier studies on leaders by 
Meyers^^ and Reynolds. 

Clifford is felt to show some leadership in athletics, 
a field in which he is interested and competent. He was 
elected Sports Convenor for the school’s Students Union. Bob 
and Ian were mentioned as leaders at times but in unspecified 
areas. Both boys have access to automobiles occasionally and 
it might be that at those times thej'" have greater influence 
on the group’s activities. 

Meyers, ’’The Development and Implications of a Conception 
of Leadership for Leadership Training,” quoted in J, Bratton 
and Associates, ”Status and Student Leadership, ’ ’Educational 
Leadership , 13, ^January, 1956, pp. 209-21ii. 

^^F. J. Reynolds, ’’Factors of Leadership Among Seniors of 

Central High School, Tulsa, Oklahoma,” Journal of Educational 
Research, 37, January, IRtii, pp. 356-61.

In order to determine the behavior that the group members 
associated with leadership, the boj^s were asked to complete a 
check-list of leadership traits.The results of these are 
shown in Table Seventeen.

It would appear that Frank*s traits as revealed by the 
tests used in this study, and those valued by the group members 
in their leaders, are in fairly close agreement. This would 
suggest that the individuals in the group make a reasonably 
accurate assessment of their leaders. The fact that the 
traits of Bob, Ian and Clifford tended to differ somewhat from 
those preferred by the group might be the reason that their 
leadership was only temporarj^. 

Followers 

The followers in the group tend to be less active, less 
stable emotionally, more restrained, submissive and thoughtful

than the leaders, as far as the personality tests could deter¬ 
mine, Some of the members of the class had difficulty in 
finding a position in the group. Eric had fevj choices on the 
sociometric tests and a high Group-Social-Distance score 
indicating a lack of acceptance. The cause of his difficulty 
appeared to be his highly critical attitude toward the group 
and its activities. Eric was aware of his position and made 
some effort to overcome his difficulties in an attempt to 
achieve a more satisfactory relationship with his classmates. 

George also had trouble in establishing himself with the 
group. He was younger and seemed somewhat immature socially 
when compared with his classmates. The only common ground 
between George and the group was in the field of athletics 
and through this activity, he gained some recognition from 
his peers. As was noted. Bob, Clifford and Ian were active 
followers who could assume leadership in some instances. 

It would seem that to be accepted as a group member an 
individual must be able to enjoy participation in its activi¬ 
ties and Join in these without undue criticism. The Class¬ 
room Social Distance Scale revealed also that those boys who 
felt insecure in the group tended to value it more, having lower 
than average Self-Social-Distance scores. 

Isolates 

On the sociometric tests there were four instances where 
individuals received no choices. Such persons are termed 
isolates. Eric received no choices on the sociom.etric test 
asking , ”l\liora would you like to have hom.e with you to spend the 
Christmas holidays?” Since Eric was highly critical of the 






Ilk 


group’s activities it may have been felt that he would be 
critical of their homes also and so the members did not choose 
him. In addition, Eric felt that his home life was sui_erior 
to that of the others and, perhaps rather than risk his un¬ 
favorable comparisons, he was not selected. 

On the test asking for seatmates, Hugh and Alan were 
not chosen on the second and third tests respectively. At 
the time of the second test, Hugh was in the hospital and had 
been away from school for almost two months. He was expected 
back for the next term and so was included in the test. Since 
he had ranked fairly high on the first test, his isolation on 
the second seems to be due to the fact that he was not able to 
take part in the activities of the group. Alan’s case illus¬ 
trates the same situation. By the time the third test was 
given he had established friendships and closer associations 
>n.th the grade ten boys. Since he was not taking an active 
part in the affairs of his classmates, he was not chosen as a 
seatmate bj^ any of them. Significantly perhaps, these boys 
were also the youngest members of the group. 

On ‘the March socioraetric test asking the question, ’’With 
whom would you like to attend the movies?” Hugh again received 
no choices. He was still utilizing his free time for study 
since he had missed so much school earlier and consequently 
he was not interested in attending the movies with the group. 

In addition, he found it difficult to get into town from the 
farm in the evenings. Tox^ard the end of the study, though, Hugh 
had his courses in hand and was re-establishing contact vjith

the group. Boys evidently desire their companions to be 
readily available for social activities. 

These results would seem to indicate that the meiT±)ers of 
the group are aware of differences in social status in the 
community and are somewhat sensitive about their own position. 
In addition, and more important from the point of view of group 
structure, it appears that for acceptance there must be active 
and continued participation in the affairs of the group by the 
individual. 

The investigation of the roles of the individuals in the 
group reveals that aJJ. members are not equal in status. This 
group has one leader, Frank, with Clifford, Ian and Bob assum¬ 
ing the lead on occasion. These four were the most popular 
members of the group. Among the rest of the group, who may 
be classified generally as followers, there is some ranking 
also. To be totally accepted it was necessary to be interested 
in the group’s activities and to participate in them. Those 
who were not willing to do this were isolated by their fellows. 
Age seemed to be a factor in establishing a role in the group 
since its youngest members, Hugh and Alan, were isolates in 
two sociometric measures and George had some difficulty in 
gaining acceptance. 

This chapter points out that members of the group assume 
various roles in its activities. The nature of these roles and 
their place in the group structure should be helpful in the 
understanding of the behavior of the individual.

CHAPTER X 


A SU>jMARY OF PERSONAL DATA ON GROUP MEMBERS 

In this chapter an attempt will be made to synthesize 
the material of the earlier chapters into a more complete 
description of each member of the group. This should prove 
helpful in the understanding of the roles played by an 
individual in his activities with hj.s classmates and yield 
some insight into the factors that influence his behavior. 

The personal data obtained for each boy is given in Table 
Eighteen, 

Alan , Alan was the youngest member of the group, with 
an age of fifteen years six months. He lived in town with his 
mother and a younger brother and sister, Alan's father is 
dead. Their home was slightly below the group average in 
socio-economic status and in social class level according to 
the Sims Score Card for Socio-Economic Status and the Sims 
S,C,I, Occupational Rating Scale. Alan was above average in 
mental ability with an I.Q. of 121 and made adequate, but not 
outstanding, grades in all school subjects, having a grade 
ten average of sixty-tliree. On the March sociometric test 
asking for seatmates, Alan was an isolate. On the other tests 
he received few choices, suggesting that he was not accepted 
by the group. The Classroom Social Distance Scale administered 
in January indicated that he was reasonably well received

at that time, but he rated the group more favorably than its 
members rated him, possibly due to feelings of insecurity. At 
best, his role in the group would be that of a follower. From 
his scores on the Guilford-Zimmer man Tenperament Survey, Alan 
appeared to have a desire to please others and seemed to get on 
well with them. He was quiet and exhibited a tendency toward 
shyness and submissiveness. The Gordon personal Profile 
suggested that Alan was very critical of himself. He seeraed 
to be determined and persevering in his undertakings according 
to the Thurstone Teirperament Schedule. On the S.R.A. Youth 
Inventory Alan did not indicate difficulties in any areas. 

Since this test was given early in the term when he was new 
to the school, the results of the Inventory may not be meaning¬ 
ful. The Rotter Incomplete Sentences Blank revealed that Alan 
did not appear secure in social situations vjith his classmates 
and that he felt somewhat inferior to them. He indicated some 
difficulty in accepting himself at that time. Alan was con¬ 
sidered by the teachers, however, to be fairly well adjusted 
to his new school. His favorite recreation was reading, in 
keeping with his retiring nature. Much of his insecurity might 
be due to his short time in Brooks High School. Also, since 
he is younger than his classmates, he might find greater accept¬ 
ance and security with the grade ten group. 

Bob . Bob was sDJcteen years four months old which was 
nearly average for the group. He was the youngest of two boys 
in his family. From the Sims’ scales it was determined that 
his family was in the average social class level for the group 
and that his home was above average in socio-economic status.

Bob had average ability -with an I,Q. of one hundred. Due to a 
late start in grade ten through fall work. Bob had difficulty 
with his courses and failed several, his average being thirty- 
one. This year he was repeating them and had shown some 
improvement. The sociometric tests revealed that Bob was ohe 
of the most popular boys in the class. He, with Frank and Ian, 
formed the nucleus of the boys* group. On the Classroom Social 
Distance Scale he showed slightly greater acceptance of the 
group than was shown to him, suggesting feelings of insecurity. 
Since he assumed leadership on some occasions, Bob’s roles 
would be that of an active follower and popular person. From 
his responses on the Guilford-Zimraerman, Bob appeared to get on 
well with others and seems tactful and considerate in his 
dealings with people, traits noted by the teaching staff. All 
measures of personality suggested that he was tense, anxious, 
and depressed and in adoh.tion, the Gordon Personal Profile 
indicated that he seemed somewhat irresponsible. The latter 
ideas received some confirmation from the S,R,A, Youth Inven¬ 
tory in which he indicated problems in all areas measured. Bob's 
interests on the Kuder Preference Record appeared in line with 
his abiHty and vocational choice of the R.C.M.P., but his 
personality traits might hinder him. His autobiography and 
his responses on the Rotter Incomplete Sentences Blanlc suggest¬ 
ed that he might not be as definite in his choice of an occupa¬ 
tion as he indicated earlier. These sources also revealed that 
Bob had feelings of inadequacy in social situations and his 
preference for solitary leisure time activities would seem to 
verify this.

Clifford , Clifford repeated grade ten and with an age of 
seventeen years, ten months, was the oldest boy in the group. 

He was an only child and lived with his ;^arents on a farm near 
Brooks. He came to school in tirie school van. Clifford.*s home 
was of average social class and socio-economic status for this 
group, according to the Sims' scales. Although Clifford had an 
I.Q. of one hundred, suggesting average ability, he was not 
malcing passing grades at school, chiefly due to lack of effort. 
On repeating his failed courses his average was only forty-four. 
According to the sociometric tests, Clifford gained in popu¬ 
larity as the term progressed. He did not approach the popu¬ 
larity of Bob, pf'ank and Ian, although the Classroom Social 
Distance Scale indicated that he was the most accepted member 
of the group. He tended to rate his associates somewhat higher 
on the scale than the rating he received. As he was the leader 
in some of the athletic activities of the group, he had the 
role of an active follower. He appeared to be an active, 
care-free, impulsive individual who did not like reflective 
thinking, as far as the personality tests could determine. 
Clifford had no high scores on the S.R.A. fouth Inventory 
indicating either good adjustment or a reluctance on his part 
to reveal problems. His leisiire time was divided between 
individual and group activities. Clifford's Kuder scores sug¬ 
gested interests other than those common to his vocational 
choice of farrrn.ng* Through both his autobiography and his 
responses on the Rotter he indicated that he was extremely 
dissatisfied i-jith the school situation, a fact recognized by 
the teachers in their observations and the class on the Guess 







122 


VJho test. Clii'ford planned to leave school this spring and 
secure a job until he is needed on the fai'm. 

Dennis , Dennis at seventeen years, two months, was older 
than the average of the group. He lived in tov/n with his parents 
and a younger sister. Measured on the Sims Score Card for 
Socio-Economic Status, their home was of lower status than the 
group mean. Dennis was above average in mental ability having 
an I.Q. of 120. He did not caxe for school and consequently 
failed most of his grade ten courses, his average being thirty- 
six. He began this term determined to do better and met with 
some success. After the first two months his interest waned 
and he left school to join the air force. He did not appear 
interested in revealing his problems on the S.R.A, Youth In¬ 
ventory. From his autobiography it seemed that Dennis felt a 
lack of acceptance from his classmates, a situation verified 
to som.e extent by his high Group-Social-Distance score on the 
Classroom Social Distance Scale. On the Rotter Incom.plete 
Sentences Blank, his responses suggested that the home and 
school were areas of conflict in his life. The observations of 
the teaching staff were in agreem.ent with this. He appeared 
to have a confident, optimistic view of the future, however, 
and tended to over-rate his ability to cope with any situation. 
Dennis affected an attitude of independence which seemed to 
ma,sk feelings of insecurity. 

Eric . Eric was sixteen years, eight months old which vjas 
average for this group. He lived in Brooks with his parents 
and three younger sisters and a younger brother. He had, in 
addition, an older brother and sister not living at home. His

family was of higher socio-economic status and social class 
level than the average for the group as determined by the Sims' 
scales, Eric had an I.Q, of 111, but did not work up to this 
ability at school where he was repeating two grade ten courses. 
On the sociometric tests, Eric had varying choice patterns as 
he tried to gain acceptance in the group. He received few 
choices, being isolated on one test, and his high Group-Social- 
Distance score would indicate that he was not well received by 
the boys. Eric also had a high Self-Social-Distance score 
suggesting that he was critical of the group members, a fact 
that might account for the group's reaction to him. Eric's 
role in the group appeared to be mainly that of a follovjer. 
Personality tests revealed that Eric was a quiet thoughtful 
individual who liked the company of others. His critical, 
somewhat hostile attitude had caused him difficulty in gaining 
group acceptance, Eric might compensate for this through his 
activity in several hobbies of a solitary nature. The Gordon 
Personal Profile suggested that Eric tended to rate himself 
more highly on tests than conditions warrant. On the Youth 
Inventory, Eric did not reveal any particular problem areas. 

His expressed vocational choice of the R.C,A,F. appeared to be 
in line with his ability and interests as indicated on the Kuder 
Preference Record, On the Rotter, Eric's responses suggested 
that he was finding some difficulty in establishing a place in 
the group, as the personality tests had forecast. He was 
aware apparently of the causes of his trouble and was attempt¬ 
ing to overcome this. The teachers felt that he was socially 
mature, a view that was evidently not shared by his classmates.

With more experience in group living it seemed likely that he 
would gain some measure of acceptance. 

Frank . Frank was sixteen years, eight months of age, 
nearly average for this group* He was the youngest of four 
children, having an older brother and two older sisters. His 
parents have separated and Frank lived alone with his mother 
in Brooks. The home was of the average social class level 
for this group and above average in socio-economic status as 
measured on the Sims tests. Frank had an I.Q. of 123, indi¬ 
cating ability well above average. He had not applied himself 
to his schoolwork adequately and failed one course last year. 

His grade ten average was only fifty-two. This year he had 
shown considerable improvement, but did not achieve honors 
standing. Frank increased in popularity as the term progressed. 
With Bob and Ian, Frank formed the central core of the group 
and was widely accepted as its leader. He received a high 
Group-Social-Distance score due to an unfavorable rating from 
Ian, but in spite of this he appeared to be well accepted by 
the boys. Frank*s roles were that of a popular person and a 
leader. Frank was active, impulsive, extroverted and full of 
energy. He had a cheerful, optimistic outlook on life, accord¬ 
ing to the Guilford-Ziramerman Teriperament Survey. Frank’s 
personality tests also suggested that he had a tendency to 
dominate people and might be lacking in tact. The results of 
the Gordon Personal Profile suggested that Frank tended to be 
somewhat irresponsible, a trait recognized by the staff and 
one that likely contributed to his low achievement. His main 
leisure time interests center about group activities which

accords with his tendency toward extroversion, Frank checked 
many problems on the S.R.A. Youth Inventory suggesting possible 
dissatisfaction with his present state and a desire for 
guidance, Frank’s vocational interests and his ability agreed 
with hj.s choice of eigineering as a vocation. His autobio¬ 
graphy and responses on the Rotter Incomplete Sentences Blank 
were in general agreement with the results of the other measure¬ 
ments, 

George , With an age of sixteen years, three months, 

George was one of the youngest members of the group. He was 
the oldest of three children, all of whom lived with their 
parents in Brooks. On the Sims scales the family was helovj the 
group average in social class level but was above the mean in 
socio-economic status, VJhile George was of average ability, 
with an I,Q, of 102, he was having difficulty in school and 
was repeating three grade ten courses. The sociometric test 
results appeared to indicate that George was not well accepted 
by the group. The Classroom Social Distance Scale, on the 
other hand, suggested that George was given better than 
average acceptance by his classmates. The other data con¬ 
cerning George seemed to substantiate the former measurement. 

His role in the group was that of a follower. The Giiilford- 
Zimmerman Teuperament Siirvey suggested that George was hyper¬ 
sensitive, impulsive and that he did not get on well with others 
nor feel at ease with them, G-eorge appeared rather critical 
of himself according to the Gordon Personal Profile, On the 
Youth Inventory, George did not indicate any particular problem 
areas. He had not yet adjusted his vocational choice to his

ability level since he chose engineering and it appeared un¬ 
likely that he would meet the requirements for university 
training. In his autobiography, George indicated that he felt 
that he did not fit into the social groups of his classmates. 

He was rated by both the teachers and the group as being immature, 
which may account for his lack of acceptance. He seemed to 
gain greater acceptance with the grade ten boys. Both the 
autobiography and his responses on the Rotter suggested that 
George experienced feelings of insecurity. He attenpted to 
gain recognition and a sense of belonging through membership 
on athletic teams, his chief leisure activity. 

Hugh . Hugh was younger than the average for this group, 
being sixteen years, one month old. He had one younger sister 
and they lived with their parents on a farm near Brooks. The 
home was at the average social class level as measured by 
the Sims S.C.I. Occig^ational Rating Scale. Hugh caiae to 
school by van daily. He had high average mental ability with 
an I.Q. of 110. Hugh had done satisfactory work through 
school, his grade ten average being fifty-six, and of late 
had shown an increasing interest in his studies. V^ile Hugh 
was apparently well accepted in the early part of the term, 
his absence from school for the months of November and December 
due to hospitalization seemed to lower his status, according 
to the sociometric tests. Hugh was an isolate on two of these 
tests and was chosen only once on each of two others. He 
had an above average Group-Social-Distance score which is in 
accord with the findings of the sociometric tests. In the 
group, Hugh was a follower in some activities and was an

isolate in others. He was considered the teachers, however, 
to be well adjusted socially. According to the Guilford-Zimmer- 
man Temperament Survey Hugh appeared to be a quLet individual 
who seemed to prefer planning and reflection to participatioi 
in activities. The results of the Gordon Personal Profile 
suggested that Hugh had a determined, persevering attitude. 

He tended to be rather critical of others and may not get on 
well with them. His lack of participation was likely due to 
his being under a doctor*s care for a weak heart. Hugh 
tended to over-emphasize this condition rather than accept 
its limiting effects. He had not been able to select a voca¬ 
tion and this problem is reflected in his score on the Youth 
Inventory. Hugh’s responses on the Rotter revealed little of 
a personal nature. His choice of solitary leisure time activi¬ 
ties might suggest that he did not feel accepted ty the group, 
or might indicate neurotic tendency due to his heart condition. 

Ian. Ian was older than the average for this group, 
having an age of sixteen years, ten months. He and his mother 
lived in Brooks. Ian’s father was dead and his yomger 
brother vms in a provincial boys* home. The home was rated 
at the group average social class level but is of lower socio¬ 
economic status according to the Sims tests. Ian’s I.Q. of 
ninety-six would suggest low average ability. At school he 
worked hard but had trouble achieving passing grades in the 
academic courses. He was repeating grade ten mathematics 
this year. His average in his grade ten courses was thirty- 
eight. The sociometric test results indicated that Ian was 
the most popular boy in the class. His Group-Social-Distance 
score on the Classroom Social Distance Scale tended to confirm 







128 


his acceptance by the group* His role appeared to be that of an 
active follower since he assumed the lead on some occasions. 

From the personality tests Ian seemed to be a quiet boy who 
liked to plan activities rather than carry them out* His low 
Ascendance scores might indicate a submissive nature* The 
Gordon Personal Profile scores suggested that Ian tended to be 
rather critical of himself* From his responses on the Rotter 
it would seam that Ian was under considerable pressure from 
his mother for success in school and that he could not live 
up to her expectations. This situation was also mentioned 
in the teachers’ reports on Ian. The problem appeared to be 
a basic one in Ian’s life* On the S.R.A, Youth Inventory, 

Ian had a pattern of hr.gh average and high scores in all 
areas, suggesting feelings of insecurity. Plis leisure time 
activities were of a solitary nature, in keeping with his 
personality traits. Ian’s occipational choice was not in 
accord with either his ability or his interests as revealed 
by the Kuder Preference Record* Ian would likely need some 
assistance in making a satisfactory adjustment in this area. 

This sumraaiy of the sociometric and personal data of the 
boys consolidates the findings of the previous chapters* 

From this it may be possible to gain some insight into the 
factors that influence the behavior of the group members.

CHm-ER XI 


TIffi FACTORS INFLUENCBIG THE BEHAVIOR OF ADOLESCENTS 

From a review of the data on the structure of the peer 
group and the personal traits and roles of its members, some 
inferences may be made concerning the factors that influence 
the behavior of adolescents. These pressures may be divided 
into two categories, factors within the peer group and those 
outside. 


Factors Within the Group 

An examination of the sociometric test results suggests 
that the individuals are motivated by the desire to gain 
acceptance in the group. This appears to be indicated through 
the pattern of choices of the members, -t^o focus their atten¬ 
tion on the tliree most mdely accepted individuals, Bob, 

Frank and Ian, in the selection of their seatmates. To be 
accepted it was also necessary to conform to the group’s 
standards without being unduly critical. Eric, who was open 
in his criticism of the group, was isolated on one of the 
sociometric tests and chosen only once on each of the others. 
For acceptance in the group it is also necessary to be avail¬ 
able for participation in its activities. Hugh, through hos¬ 
pitalization and the pressure of school wa-'k, was not able to 
join his fellows in their social activities and was an isolate 
on two twsts and chosen only once on two others. The signifi¬ 
cance of this is increased since Hugh appeared to be fairly

well accepted by the group on the first sociometric test, 
given in September, 1956, before his illness. 

Sharing the interests of tiie group is also a factor 
influencing acceptance. George, who appears socially immature, 
gained some status with the members through participation in 
athletic activities. Alan, the youngest in the group, does 
not share any of the interests of his classmates and was not 
chosen on the last sociometric t est given in March, 1957* 

Alan, George and Hugh, who were not well received by the 
group, were its youngest members. Since Clifford, the oldest 
boy, was well accepted, it would seem that being younger than 
average is detrimental in gaining a position in the group. 

The significance of the automobile as a device for gaining 
the approval of the other boys was mentioned Ian and Bob. 

In their autobiographies and on the Rotter both boys indicated 
that they felt insecure in the group and implied that their 
use of the family car improved their status with their peers. 

In gaining acceptance in the group it appears that the 
individual must be recognized by the key members, share similar 
interests, be available and eager for participation in group 
activities and conform to group standards. The use of an 
automobile may be an asset in achieving status in the eyes of 
the peer group. 

The role of the individual appears to have some influence 
on his behavior. According to paragraphs written by the 
members, they expect their leader to be cheerful, a good sport, 
easy-going, sociable and active. These exp)ectations were 
realized in the behavior of the onlj^ widely accepted, leader.

Frank, as far as the tests used could determine. From the 
results of the personality tests, the followers are likely to 
be less active and more restrained and submissive than the 
leaders. The more active followers will be expected to assume 
the leadership in some activities as Clifford did in athletics. 
There is certain behavior expected from friends, according to 
paragraphs written by the members of the grade eleven class* 

An individual must be able to get on well with others and 
share interests, be generous, trustworthy and understanding 
in his activities with his friends in order to maintain this 
position. From these observations it would seem that the 
expectations of the group for the role assumed by the indivi¬ 
dual appear to have some influence on his behavior* 

On the Rotter Incomplete Sentences Blank several of the 
ooys indicated that they felt insecure in social situations* 
They were just beginning to enjoy activities as a crowd, and 
consequently did not have the experience in this type of 
behavior that would give them a feeling of ease. The boys 
expressed a desire to learn how to dance and how to conduct 
themselves properly in the crojd. This suggests that the 
increasing importance of social activities exerts a pressure 
on members of the group* They must be able to get along, not 
only with the boys, but xd.th the gdrls that increasingly 
enter into membership with their crowd* 

The fact that certain students came to school by van 
seemed to influence their behavior* The vans arrive shortly 
before school begins in the morning and leave immediately 
after four in the afternoon. This means that the boys are not

usually available for activities with the town students outside 
school hours. In addition, on the farm they have added responsi¬ 
bilities, decreasing their opportunity to participate in 
social affairs in town. Due to this the vanned boys are not 
readily taken into the social groups of the school and tend 
to form close associations among themselves. This was noted 
in the case of Clifford and Hugh in this study. 

Within the group the pressures influencing behavior seem 
to come from the individual's desire to gain acceptance, which 
is affected by his acquaintance with the key members, interests 
common to the group, availability and desire to participate 
in the activities of the groups, his conformity to group 
standards, his age, and to a more limited degree his use of an 
automobile. Other factors affecting behavior are the roles 
assumed by the individual, an increased desire for crowd 
activities and membership in the minority group of vanned 
students. 


Factors Outside the Group 

In their autobiographies and on the Rotter Incomplete 
Sentences Blank, most of the boys indicated satisfaction 
with their home life. One exception was Dennis, who implied 
that he had some difficulty getting along with his family. 

His independent attitude and hostility, particularly noticeable 
at school, may be a reflection of this situation. 

On the S.R.A. Youth Inventory, Bob, Ian and George 
indicated that they had problems at home through high or high 
average scores in the area My Home and My Family, In their 
autobiographies. Bob and Ian suggested that undue emphasis

had been x^laced on academic achievement by their mothers. Their 
ability was such tliat the expectations of their parents could 
not be met. This could cause the feelings of insecurity 
suggested by the personality measures used in this study. 

It vjould appear that the home exerts a great influence 
on the behavior of the adolescent. Influences producing 
adjustment difficulties in the individual appear to be more 
easily recognized than those of a positive nature. 

Another pressure effective upon the attitudes and behavior 
of the individual seems to be the school. Since attendance 
in school is the major occupation of this group, the frequency 
of comment on this situation is understandable, Alan did not 
achieve as high a standing in his courses as he desired and 
this has led to a fear of failure in school according to 
his responses on the Rotter Incomplete Sentences Blank, This 
fear appears to be transferred to other situations for Alan 
comments, greatest worry is to try something and fail,” 

Such an attitude would seem lilcely to influence his behavior 
and may be responsible for Iris low score on the Ascendance 
scales of the personality tests. Alan appears to be a quiet, 
retiring, submissive youth. 

The outstanding example of the effect of both the school 
and home on the behavior of the individual is in the case of 
Bob, His inability to cope with the academic subjects made 
it impossible for him to live up to the expectations of his 
mother. This problem seems fundamental to his difficulties 
in other areas and may be the cause of the withdrawal tenden¬ 
cies suggested by his low score on the Ascendance scale of the

Guilford-ZimiTierman Temperament Survey* It might also produce 
the anxiety and tensions revealed on the Emotional Stability 
scales of the personality tests. 

Ian, too, was forced into an academic pattern for which he 
was not suited* This produced in him traits similar to Bob, 
but because he seems less attached to his home, they were less 
pronounced. 

The analysis of the data on this group of boys reveals 
that within the group the desire for acceptance, the roles 
assumed by the individual, meivibership in minority groups and 
the awakening interest in social affairs affect the behavior 
of the individuals. Outside the group, the home and the school 
appear to exert the greatest pressure on its members. 

In order to determine if the pressures inferred from the 
tests and observations made on the group were actually recog¬ 
nized by the members, they were asked to write paragraphs dis¬ 
cussing the things that influenced them most. The results of 
this are shown in Table Nineteen*

In their paragraphs the boys suggested that they were 
influenced by people in different ways. The teachers provide 
guidance, particularly in the area of vocations. During their 
contacts with adults the beys felt that they learned by observa¬ 
tion how to conduct themselves as mature indi^/iduals. At 
school they suggested that techniques in getting along with 
others were developed as they associated with their classmates. 
In sports again they implied that the important aspects were 
the relationships formed between the pliers. There is also, 
in this area, the important factor of learning to play accord¬ 
ing to the rules. Ilie home and parents serve as a base of 
security to the beys. In most instances the parents were 
looked to for guidance in personal problems. Social activities 
were suggested as devices that help to rid the individual of 
shyness and nervousness. The church x-jas named here as an 
influence on behavior but was not mentioned at any other time. 

Throughout the paragraphs the boys commented frequently 
on the importance of getting on well with others. This seems 
to be indicative of increased social consciousness on their 
part. On the xdiole the influences on behavior determined from 
the data obtained by tests and observations appear to agree 
fairly well with those expressed by the boys in their writing. 
This might be considered to be some verification of these 


inferences 






CHAPTER XII 


SITl^RY AHD CONCLUSIONS 

To permit an intensive investigation extending over seven 
months, the scope of this study was limited to two phases of 
adolescence, the structure of the peer group and the influences 
on the behavior of its members* Since age and sex are import¬ 
ant in grouping, the specific group selected for the study was 
made up of the boys of the grade eleven class in Brooks High 
School. In securing data on these boys several procedures were 
employed. These included measures of sociometric status, 
interests, intelligence, achievement, adjustment and personality. 
Autobiographies and interviews with parents, teachers and 
students were also used. The data collected were analyzed to 
determine the structure of the group, the nature of its members, 
the roles they assumed and the factors that influence their 
behavior. As was mentioned, the case study method was employed 
in this study, not because of the truths it was expected to 
verify, but for the insights expected to be revealed. 

Group Structure 

1. The structure of the group appeared to \xndergo some 
changes during the early months of school with an increase in 
stability as time passed. Because of the vacation period which 
produces little interaction between members, the value of the

sociometric test as an indicator of the structure of the group 
at the beginning of the school year is rather dubious. 

2. Tlie results of the sociometric tests indicate that 
Kranl^, Ian and Bob remained the most popular members of the 
group throughout the investigation. 

3. The major changes in the sociograms appeared to be 
due to an attempt on the part of the peripheral members to gain 
acceptance from the popular boys. 

ii. Ihe members seemed to choose companions for movies 
on the same basis as they chose seatmates^ since the socio¬ 
metric tests using these criteria yielded similar results. 

5. The beys appeared to be more particular, however, 
in the selection of home visitors, since the sociogram formed 
using the criterion, “I'jhom would you like to have home with 
you for the Christmas holidays?” showed a choice pattern that 
differed from the others. This might be due to the individual 
attempting to anticipate the acceptance of the visitor by the 
family. Also if the activities of the parents or the home 
itself differed greatly from the average such as in the case 
of the rural boys and those of lower class level, it might 
adversely affect the individual in the eyes of his associates 
and lov7er his status. Since the results of this question do 
not agree with the other two, it is probably unsatisfactory 
for the purpose of establishing the structure of the group. 

The lack of agreement might be due to factors other than 
inter-pupil relationships, such as those mentioned above, 
entering the responses. 






138 


6. Tlie Classroom Social Distance Scale developed by- 
Cunningham yielded self-social-distance scores that suggested 
that the boys most accepted by their peers tended to be more 
careful in the selection of their friends. Those who were 
insecure tended to value the group more highly. The group- 
social-distance scores, viiich measure the acceptance of the 
individual by the group, were not in agreement with the results 
of the sociometric tests. The Classroom Social Distance Scale 
seemed to be a less effective device for measuring the accept¬ 
ance of the individual in a small group, since one rating coifLd 
affect the -total score unduly. 

Roles 

1. The results of this study indicated that all the 
members of the group were not of equal status. The rank of 
the individual appeared to be determined by his role in the 
group structure. 

2. Friends , Best friends may be formed on several bases. 
The friendship between Bob and Ian appeared to have been 
founded on a similarity of personality traits and interests. 
Compensation and admiration seemed to be the basis for the 
friendship between Bob and Frank. Hugh and Clifford, the third 
pair of friends discussed, were manbers of a minority group 

at school, the vanned students, and this appeared to be the 
cause of their friendship. In addition, factors relating to 
the home environment seemed to play some part in the forma¬ 
tion of friendships.

3* Popular Persons , The reason for the popularity of 
some of the group members -was rather obscure. Prank, the 
leader, might have been chosen on the strength of his positive 
personality traits. Bob and Ian might be popular due to their 
close association with Frank. Clifford seaned to be rated 
highly by his associates through their identification with him 
in his decision to leave school. Intelligence did not appear 
to be related to popularity, bxit all the boys tended to be 
underachievers in their school work. 

ii. Leaders , in this group Frank was the only widely 
accepted leader. According to the personality tests, he was 
active, carefree, optimistic and cheerful. He liked to be 
with people and tended to dominate his associates. He had 
the highest mental ability rating of the boys with an I.Q. 
of 123* With an age of sixteen years, eight months, Frank 
was slightly older tlian the average for the group. In 
general these findings agreed with earlier reports on leaders 
by Meyers^and Reynolds. 

5* Followers . According to the tests used, followers 
tended to be less active, less stable emotionally, more 
restrained, submissive and thoughtful than the leaders. 

Active followers, such as Clifford, Ian and Bob could assume 
leadership in seme activities.

6. Isolates, The reasons for non-acceptance in the group 


appeared to be a lack of conformity to group standards and undue 
criticism of its activities, non-participation in its activities 
and a lack of common interests with the members* Two of the 
isolates, Hugh and Alan, were the yoimgest members of the group 
and so must have seemed immature to their classmates* 

Factors Influencing Behavior 

V^thin the group * 

1* One of the important factors influencing the behavicr 
of the individual seemed to be the desire to gain acceptance 
in the group* To do this it appeared that a hoy must gain 
recognition from one of the key members, share similsr inter¬ 
ests, be available and eager for participation in group 
activities, conform to group standards and be near the average 
age of the group* 

2. The expectations associated vdth the role of the 
indl'^/idual in the group were also influential in determining 
behavior. According to paragraphs written by the boys, the 
leader should be cheerful, a good sport, easy-going, sociable 
and active. Frank, the leader of this group, possessed these 
traits as far as personality tests could determine* These 
measures also suggested that the followers were less active 
and less extroverted than the leader. The more active fol¬ 
lowers could assume leadership in som.e instances, as Clifford 
did in athletics. The m.Qnbers of the group expected that 
their friends would be able to get along xlth others and share 
interest^ be generous, trustworthy and understanding in their

activities vdth them. 

3. The increasing importance of social acti\aties seemed 
to exert pressure on the members of the group. They were just 
beginning to enjoy participation in the crowds and, through 
lack of experience, felt ill at ease in social situations. 

Many appeared to be motivated by a desire to learn how to 
dance and hov7 to conduct themselves properly in the crov/d. 

They found it necessary/- to get along, not only with the beys, 
but with the girls that entered increasingly into their crowd, 

Ii. The students that came to school by van were not 
readily taken into the social groups of the school, a situation 
noted earlier by Bonnej^,^^ and tended to fom close associations 
among themselves. In this study Clifford and Hugh illustrate 
this tendency. Membership in this minority group appeared to 
influence their beha^/ior. 

Outside the Group . 

1, Outside the group, the home appeared to exert consider¬ 
able pressua*e on the individual. The independent, hostile 
attitude of Dennis seemed to be caused bj'- his difficulty in 
getting along with his family. Bob and Ian could not meet the 
expectations of their parents in their school vjork and this 
appeared to produce feelings of insecurity in them. It seemed 
that the home influences that produced adjustment problems for 
the boys were those most readily identified.

2* The school also seemed to affect the behavior of the 


individual, A fear of failure in school subjects appeared to 
be transferred by Alan to othei' situations and ircLght be the 
basis for his retiring nature and tendencies toxrard submissive¬ 
ness as suggested by the personality tests. In the cases of 
Bob and Ian mentioned above, the failure at school seemed to 
be a significant determining factor in their other adjustment 
problems. The boys suggested that the teachers influenced 
their behavior by example and by giving them guidance, parti¬ 
cularly in the vocational, field. 

Effectiveness of Teachers’ Judgments 

The study also revealed that the members of the group 
considered to be socially adjusted by the teachers were not 
so rated by their fellows. The teachers used somewhat dif¬ 
ferent criteria in evaluating adjustment, tending to rate 
highly Alan, Eric and Hugh, who were the quiet, retiring 
and conforming students. This was not in agreement with 
either the test results, the individual's concept of himself 
or the judgments of the other students, since all three were 
found to be isolates on the sociometric tests. The teachers 
likely named these boys as well adjusted because they present¬ 
ed fewer discipline problems in class. It appeared that the 
teachers did not judge social adjustment accurately. 

Implications for the School 

1, Tbe above suggests that there is a need for wider 
use of measurement in the classroom.. The utilj.zation of 
sociometric and adjustmoit tests to establish the position of

the individual in the group would aid the teacher in under¬ 
standing his pupils, provided that proper rapport was maintained 
to insure, as far as possible, the validity of the test results. 
By identifying the insecure members of the class, the teacher 
might be able to assist those pupils in gaining the acceptance 
of their peers. It would seem likely that an individual who 
feels that he belongs in the group would be able to achieve 
greater results at school. Since ccnfonnity is important to 
the adolescent, the establishment of satisfactory relations 
with the leaders would likely carry over to the entire group; 
thus the identification of the leaders would assist the teacher 
in the maintenance of discipline. 

2* The concern of these young people with their social 
development might be eased by the school. Instruction in 
social practices could be given and opportunities are available 
in the activities of the school for these to be put to use. 

3. The fact that in several instances the boys had 
difficulty 5-n relating their interests and ability with their 
vocational choice suggested that there is a need for more 
guidance in this area. In smaller centers the school seems to 
be in the best position to assist these people. Greater effort, 
perhaps, should be made in small schools in the field of 
vocational guidance. 


Future Studies 

With, the limited number of individuals involved, the 
results of the case stuc^ method are never regarded as the 
proof of any hypotheses. On the other hand it does provide 





insight into behavior that furthers the understanding of the 
individual and also is a valuable source of hypotheses that 
can be verified with large sample techniques* 

There are many areas related to this study that would 
increase the knowledge of the structui'e of the adolescent 
peer group and its influences. An investigation in rural and 
urban schools would broaden the scope of the study. To 
discover the developmental nature of the group structiure, the 
boys in grades nine, ten and twelve would have to be involved. 
The problem of the vanned student in his interaction mth the 
group may be worthy of investigation. 

As a'technique for securing personal data on the boys of 
this group, the autobiography did not meet with a satisfactory 
response. The difficulty may lie within this particular 
group. Since the majority were underachievers at school, 
they may not have found the composition of the autobiography 
an enjoyable task and hence did not respond. 

Recognizing the limitations of this study, with its small 
group and restricted area of investigation, it is hoped that 
it will be of some assistance in the understanding of adoles¬ 
cents and serve as an incentive for further studies in differ¬ 
ent areas and on broader planes.
