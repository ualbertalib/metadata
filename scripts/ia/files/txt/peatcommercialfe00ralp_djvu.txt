PEAT AND COMMERCIAL FERTILIZERS AS AMENDMENTS 


FOR GRAY WOODED SOILS 


R® E® Carlyle 


INTR ODU CATION 


In the Province of Alberta are found three main 
zones of soil; the bro¥/n in the south, the black in the 
central portion, and the gray wooded in the central- 
western and northern portions of the province® Of these 
three the gray wooded forms the largest group, covering 
about two-thirds of the entire province (23)® It has been 
estimated that this belt covers about one hundred million 
acres® For the most part the soil in this belt consists 
of what is known as gray wooded soil and belongs to the 
forest area® These gray wooded soils are badly leached, 
light in color, poor in fertility, slightly acl.d in reaction 
and bake badly when dried* Analysis of the wooded soils 
show that they especially lack organic matter, nitrogen, 
and sulphur* They are generally also low in total phosphor¬ 
us, Consequently this soil does not produce good crops, 
and as these districts become settled the problem of apply¬ 
ing fertilizers to increase their yields has arisen* 

Interspersed among these gray wooded soils are 
many large and small areas of peat or "muskeg” swamps*

These peat areas are commonly classified as "high moor" or 
"moss" peats (9) and it has been estimated that they cover 
at least 5 million acres in Alberta. The members of the 
Botany Department of the University of Alberta have studied 
the vegetation of Alberta peats (7). The surface layer of 
these "muskegs" is usually light colored and but slightly 
decomposed* The underlying layers are darker in color, 
decomposed to a greater degree, and would probably be more 
productive (9). In only a few cases has there been any 
attempt to drain and grow crops on "muskegs", these with a 
few exceptions not being entirely successful* Analyses of 
Alberta peats have shown that they usually contain high 
percentages of cellulose in the surface layers (9,10), Also 
it has been found that potassium is lacking In some of the 
Alberta peats that have been studied (10,18). 

Experiments on peat as an amendment for gray 
wooded soils were suggested by the fact that these soils 
are often very deficient in organic matter, and It was 
considered that the application of peat might Improve their 
physical and chemical condition. The experiments are par¬ 
ticularly apt because in many parts of the gray wooded soils 
zone the peat si vamps are so Interspersed that nearly every 
farmer is within a few miles of such a swamp, if he does 
not actually have one on his own farm. Consequently this 
Investigation was started with the purpose in mind of

finding out whether the application of such peats would in 
any way benefit the unproductive gray soils* It was felt 
that the benefits could be two-fold; first, the application 
of peat could help the physical condition of the gray soil 
by adding organic matter, the gray soil being very poor in 
this respect; secondly, the application of peat could benefit 
the gray soils chemically and it is mainly with the chemical 
benefits that this investigation is concerned* 

Experiments on the use of commercial fertilizers 
in conjunction with peat as amendments for gray wooded soil 
were suggested by the fact that such fertilizers had proved 
highly beneficial to wheat when applied after clover had 
been plowed down in experiments at Breton (23). 


REVIEW OF LITERATURE 


A great deal of research has been done on the 
composition and the reclamation of peat in the United States 
of America and in Europe, but there have been very few 
investigations carried out on the direct application of peat 
to mineral soils to improve the productiveness of such soils. 
At the present time research workers in Russia are reported 
to be carrying out investigations similar to the one cited 
here but in only a few cases are the results of their work 
obtainable *

The first consideration was to scrutinize any 
work on the composition of the type of peat used and try 
to ascertain its possibilities as a fertilizer. The 
members of the Soils Department (9*10) at the University 
of Alberta have analysed many of the Alberta peats and 
Newton reports that the nitrogen content of Alberta peat 
varies from 0,5 per cent, to 2,5 per cent, nitrogen in 
surface samples; also as a general rule the subsurface 
layers contain about twice as much nitrogen as the surface 
layer. The cellulose (9*10) content varies from zero to 
around 47 per cent, and in peat decomposition experiments 
the cellulose was found to decompose fairly rapidly in 
several cases. Cellulose decomposition, however, is 
accompanied by an increase in lignin content, lignin vary¬ 
ing in amount from 20 to 49 per cent, Newton (9,10) and 
Walker (18) report that a characteristic of some Alberta 
peats is their comparatively high calcium content, varying 
from 0,66 per cent, to 6,67 per cent. The same workers 
(9,10,18) found the phosphorus content to be very variable 
and the potassium content to be low. 

Peat has for a number of years been considered 
valuable when composted for use as a fertilizer. In 1954 
Baur (2) published some work in this regard. He reported 
that in composting a very acid, undecomposed peat nitrate 
accumulation took place if lime were added; also, the

accumulation took place more quickly where a nitrogen- 
phosphorus-potassium fertilizer was added together with 
lime. He also conducted some microbiological experiments 
and found that in composted acid peat, after one month the 
bacterial numbers increased from 16.0 millions per gram to 
19.8 millions per gram and to 28.4 millions per gram in 
three months. In completely fertilized and limed samples 
the numbers increased from 16.0 to 49.7 millions per gram. 
Newton (10) also found that large increases in bacterial 
numbers were produced by the addition of certain mineral 
fertilizers to peat soil. 

Waksman and Stevens (19) report that microorganisms 
play a most important part in the formatson of peat and that 
the rate of decomposition of peat as shown by the evolution 
of carbon dioxide is much slower than that of fresh plant 
residues. P^rianishinskov (13) found that in the composting 
of acid peat with phosphates and then adding composted 
alkaline peat plus liquid manure within tv/o months 10.0 per 
cent, of the nitrogen from the peat became available and 
18.0 per cent, became available in SiK months. 

McCool (8) reports that a combination of peat and 
fertilizer salts proved beneficial to unproductive surface 
sandy loam soil* He also found that nitrate formation took 
place in peat and that peat was not inert in this respect* 
Furthermore he states that a satisfactory soil may be made

•up by using a good grad© of peat, commercial fertilisers 
and either a poor surface soil, sand or subsoil* 

Dacknowski-Stokes (3) states that the application 
of poorly decomposed peat to soils where there is a danger 
of drought and where rainfall is light during the summer 
months, will do much to improve their structure and moisture 
holding capacity* 

Peustal and Byers (4) found that raw peats decom¬ 
posed very slowly when mixed with soil but peats previously 
subjected to solvent extraction treatments at ordinary and 
at high temperatures and under pi'-essure decomposed quite 
rapidly* 

In an investigation of Alberta peats Newton (10) 
reported that nitrification of the peats own nitrogenous 
organic matter occurred in spite of the peats low nitrogen 
content or high carbon to nitrogen ratio,, Russell (14) 
however states that nitrogen can appear as nitrate only if 
the carbon to nitrogen ratio is 12 or less, and many other 
workers have found this to be generally true for such 
materials as wheat and rye straw* Peat, however, according 
to the reference cited above does accumulate nitrates during 
its decomposition when the ratjo is much higher than 12.0* 
Norman (12), in this regard, points out that such effects 
may be due to differences in availability of carbon and 
nitrogen for if a portion of the carbon is relatively

unavailable the true ratio may be considerably narrower* 

Scott (15) and other workers state that the 
application of wheat straw to soil caused a marked decrease 
in nitrates for a certain period of time. Anderson (1) 
states that cellulose is decomposed at a rate which increases 
with the increase in available nitrogen until the latter is 
present in amounts necessary for the maximum growth of 
microorganisms. Also nitrification can proceed in the 
presence of cellulose but unless nitrogen is present in 
quantities above that required by the bacteria the nitrates 
are utilized as rapidly as they are formed. Consequently 
it has been proved that the carbon to nitrogen ratio is 
a very important factor in the accumulation of nitrates, 
but it would appear that in the case of Alberta peats, 
nitrates accumulate when the carbon to nitrogen ratio is 
much wider than in the case of many other plant materials 
studied* 

The literature available on the soil used in this 
investigation is the result of investigations carried out 
by the members of the Soils Department of the University 
of Alberta (11,20,21,22,23,24). This soil has been found 
to be relatively unproductive, because it lacks particularly 
nitrogen, sulphur and phosphorus, and other essential elements 
as well as organic matter*

OUTLINE OF INVESTIGATION 


The investigation was carried out for the most 
part in pot and tumbler experiments and the results are 
based on three main features* First^the nitrates were 
determined at regular intervals, this being used as an 
indication of the rate at which the peat and nitrogenous 
fertilizer incorporated with the soil was becoming available 
to plants* Secondly, wheat crops were actually grown and 
their yields taken as an indication of whether or not the 
different treatments of the gray wooded soil were beneficial 
or otherwise. Thirdly, bacterial counts were made and micro¬ 
biological activity used tc determine the effect of adding 
peat and commercial fertilizers to gray wooded soils. Also^ 
a comparison of peat and some other cellulose materials, 
mainly straw and cotton, was made. The accumulation of 
nitrates was again taken as an indication of the effect of 
the different treatments. 

The experiment for the determination of nitrates 
was done In conjunction with the experiment for the deter¬ 
mination of crop yields and was laid out as follows; 

Thirty-two one gallon glazed pots were cleaned and filled 
with gray wooded Fallis soil. The soil was previously sifted 
through a coarse sieve and uniformly mixed. Then the correct 
amount of sifted soil and coarsely ground and dried Stony

Plain peat were added to each pot and the soil and peat were 
then thoroughly mixed so that the peat was uniformly dis¬ 
tributed throughout the soil 0 Pour pots were used for each 
of eight treatments, the treatments being as follows; 


1. 

Control soil. 

2. 

Soil #■ surface peat. 

3. 

Soil * subsurface peat. 

4.

Soil f ammonium phosphate * surface peat® 

6* 

Soil * ammonium phosphate * subsurface peat. 

V 9 

Soil * triple superphosphate «• subsurface peat. 

8, 

Soil * ammonium sulfate * subsurface peat. 

The amounts used in each case are as follows; 

1. 

Soil - 5082 grams per pot. 

2. 

Peat (oven dry) - 14,4 grams per pot which is 
equivalent to 3 tons per acre. 

3, 

Ammonium phosphate (16-20) - 1,92 grams per 
pot which is equivalent to 800 pounds per 
acre. 

4, 

Triple superphosphate - 0,96 grams per pot 
which is equivalent to 400 pounds per acre. 

5. 

Ammonium sulfate - 1,44 grams per pot which 
is equivalent to 600 pounds per acre. 

It must be noted here that the experiment is not 


as complete in its set up as might be desired. 


For example the effects of treating gray wooded 
soil with subsurface peat and triple superphosphate were

studied but the effect of using triple superphosphate alone 
was omitted. This was necessary owing to lack of time. 
However the experiment was sufficiently detailed in so far 
as the ammonium phosphate and its combinations with surface 
and subsurface peat were concerned. 

The experiment was set up so that, as mentioned 
before, there were four replicate pots of each treatment. 
Three of these pots were to be used to grow wheat crops on 
and the fourth in each case was kept for the determination 
of nitrate nitrogen. It must be noted here that in no case 
was nitrate nitrogen determined on any of the pots where 
wheat was grown, but only on the pot of each treatment that 
had been reserved for that purpose. The fertilizer was 
applied and, at the same time. Reward wheat was sown to the 
pots designated for that purpose. 

The above description refers to the experiment 
which will henceforth be designated as the First Experiment. 
It was begun In November, 1934, and from that time until 
March, 1936, nitrate nitrogen was determined monthly in 
this experiment. At the same time five crops of Reward 
wheat were grov/n, two crops being grown each year, one in 
the greenhouse during the winter months and one outside 
during the summer months. Peat was applied at the beginning 
of the experiment and fertilizers were applied at the time 
of seeding of the first and fourth crops.

The next experiment designated Second Experiment 
was an exact duplication of the First Experiment except that 
it was started later# It was begun in May, 1935, and nitrate 
nitrogen was determined monthly until September, 1935, and 
was again resumed in May, 1936, and carried on until September, 
1936* During the interval when nitrate nitrogen was not 
determined the experiment was tended and treated in the 
normal manner* At the same time four crops of Reward wheat 
were harvested from this experiment. 

The next part of the Investigation designated the 
Third Experiment was again a duplication of the First 
Experiment and the Second Experiment but with one important 
difference, the peat used was an acid peat from Chip Lake 
and had a reaction of approximately pH 4* This experiment 
was begun in June, 1935, and nitrate nitrogen was determined 
until September, 1936. A second application of fertilizer 
was applied at the same rate at the time that the third 
crop was sown. Four crops of Reward wheat were harvested 
from this experiment. 

The next part of the research dealt with the mic¬ 
robiological aspect. During the summer of 1935 the Fourth 
Experiment was set up in tumblers to determine the bacterial 
numbers of gray soil treated as described on page 9. The 
treatments were in the same proportion as before but the 
amounts used were as follows:

Soil - 100 grams of air dry soil* 

Peat - 0.31 grams per tumbler. 

Ammonium phosphate - 0.037 grams per tumbler. 

Triple superphosphate - 0.018 grams per 
tumbler. 

Ammonium sulfate - 0.028 grams per tumbler* 

Eighty tumblers were used, there being ten of 
each treatment, and the bacterial numbers were counted by 
the plate method every two weeks for a period of approximate¬ 
ly twenty weeks. Each time one tumbler from each treatment 
was used for the determination. The tumblers were maintained 
throughout the period at optimum temperature and moisture 
conditions. 

Then during the summer of 1936 the same experiment 
was repeated but this time the ratio method of counting 
bacteria was used. 

Finally the Fifth Experiment was set up to compare 
the nitrification of peat, wheat straw and cotton in gray 
and in black soils. In this experiment nitrates only were 
determined, and these were usually determined at monthly 
intervals, although at certain periods nitrate nitrogen was 
determined twice a month (see Table 35). In this experiment 
sixteen one-gallon pots were filled with sifted gray soil 
and sixteen more with Edmonton black soil. The Edmonton 
black soil is a rich black loam and very fertile (21). Two 
pots were used for each treatment and the treatments were as 


follows;

peat and ammonium phosphate were mixed in the same proportions. 
In the case of the black soil nitrate nitrogen was determined 
from December, 1935, until June, 1936* In the case of the 
gray soil nitrate nitrogen was determined from December, 1935, 
until September, 1936* The determinations were continued 
longer in the case of the gray soil because the wide differ¬ 
ences in nitrate nitrogen content continued to exist for a 
much longer period than in the case of the black soil* 

In conjunction with the determination of nitrate 
nitrogen, moisture determinations were made on each sample 
collected for nitrate determinations. This was done to put 
a check on the moisture content of the soil in the pots and 
also for the reason that moisture determinations might help 
to explain some of the fluctuations in nitrate nitrogen, 
especially during the summer months when the pots were exposed 
to outside weather conditions. 

METHODS OF ANALYSIS 


To obtain representative samples a small auger 
was used. The method employed was to screw the auger into 
the soil in the pot in five different places and withdraw 
it so that the soil clung to the auger. The auger was of 
such length that It reached down the whole depth of the pot. 
In this way It was considered a representative sample was

obtained from each pot at the time of sampling. 

For moisture determinations approxS_mately 100 
grams of soil were dried in an oven where the temperature 
was kept just below 60° centigrade; this was necessary as 
the same soil was used for the nitrate determinations. The 
soil was weighed immediately after sampling while still 
moist, then it was dried and weighed again and the percentage 
of moisture calculated on an oven-dry basis. The soil thus 
treated was then ground with a rubber pestle and 50 grams of 
it used for the nitrate determination. 

The nitrate determination was carried out according 
to the phenol-disulphonic method as modified by H. J. Harper 
( 6 ). 

To obtain the yields of the wheat crops, the crop 
from each pot was cut close to the soil and then thoroughly 
dried. After drying the total crop, straw and grain, was 
weighed. Then the grain was carefully threshed out and 
weighed by itself. Lastly the triplicate yields of grain 
were averaged for the sake of easy comparison of each treat¬ 
ment. 

In determining bacterial numbers two methods were 
used. First, the cultural plate method was employed to 
ascertain the numbers of bacteria. As stated previously 
the moisture content of the soil in the tumblers for this 
experiment was closely controlled and enough replicates of

each treatment were made up so that when a sample was taken 
from a tumbler, the tumbler could be discarded* This was 
done so that no disturbance of the soil took place until a 
sample was actually taken from it. The medium used was 
Thornton’s medium (16) of the following composition: 


Agar 

15.0 

gms. 

Dipotassium phosphate (K 2 HPO 4 )

The pH of the above medium was adjusted to 7.4 
using Brora thymol blue as an indicator. 

For the second microbiological experiment the 
ratio method of counting as developed by Thornton and Gray 
(17) was used. Here, however, a few modifications had to 
be made. It was found that the drop of liquid containing 
the soil and indigotin suspension dried too quickly on the 
slide when left exposed to the atmosphere. This resulted 
in a very uneven distribution of bacteria and indigotin 
particles on the slide and made counting under the micro¬ 
scope very difficult. Consequently to overcome this 
difficulty the slides were placed in a receptacle where the 
atmosphere was very humid and the films then dried slowly 
and uniformly. Also, difficulty was experienced in staining 
the bacteria with the two stains used by Thornton and Gray.

The bacteria were found to be stained in many cases a very 
faint pink instead of bright red, so after considerable 
experimentation it was found that immersing the slides in 
40 per cent* acetic acid for 3 minutes remedied the difficulty 
to a considerable extent* This procedure is suggested by 
Fred and Waksraan (5)* Finally 32 fields were counted for 
each sample instead of the greater number suggested by 
Thornton and Gray (17). 

A short comparison of the two methods of counting 
bacteria would perhaps not be out of place here. The ratio 
method proved to be much faster up to the point where the 
actual counts under the microscope are made. This is a 
decided advantage in that the slides can be prepared in a 
very short time and then set away to be counted later as 
they keep indefinitely once the film is fixed on the slide, 
stained and dried* Also, the apparatus needed for this 
method is very much smaller by comparison to that needed 
to carry out the plate method of counting* Finally the 
numbers determined by the ratio method more closely approx¬ 
imate the total numbers of bacteria found in soil, as the 
counts are tremendously increased* The ratio method, however, 
was found to have the following disadvantages: 

(1) Counting was found to be very tedious when 
compared to counting the colonies on the medium in the 
plate count method.

(2) The Indigotin particles were found to vary 
considerably in size and they also often clumped and it 
was difficult to estimate the number in a clump* 

(3) It was often difficult to distinguish between 
bacteria and soil particles. As a result only the stained 
particles that could definitely be assumed to be bacteria 
were Included in the counts. 

In conclusion It can be said that the ratio method, 
although only recently originated and needing to be improved 
in a few places, is probably to be preferred over the plate 
count method for the following reasons? 

(1) It gives a more accurate Idea of the total 

numbers. 

(2) It is quicker and less apparatus is needed. 

(3) The stained slides are permanent and can be 
kept for future study or reference.

The First Experiment 


The results of this experiment are recorded in 
Tables 1 to 8, and it should be noted in studying these 
tables that the peat was applied at the beginning of the 
experiment and the commercial fertilizer was applied just 
before sowing the first and fourth crops. As shown in the 
tables the amounts of nitrate nitrogen are expressed as 
parts per million and the yields of grain and straw are 
expressed in grams per pot® 

The first thing to notice in Table 2 is that in 
the second month after the incorporation of the peat with 
the soil, the treatments that had commercial fertilizer 
included in them were decidedly higher in nitrate nitrogen

than those where the treatment consisted of peat alone® 

There was, however, one exception to this and that was in 
the case of the triple superphosphate treatment where the 
nitrate nitrogen content remained as low as the control up 
until the fifth month. In the cases where both nitrogenous 
commercial fertilizers and peat were added together there 
were large increases when compared with the control® Then as 
is shown in Table 2 the nitrate nitrogen begins to increase 
during the third month where surface and subsurface peat was 
added alone® The subsurface peat treatment appears to make 
a more rapid increase in nitrate nitrogen than the surface 
peat treatment. Another significant feature of Table 2 is 
the fact that the surface and subsurface peat treatments are 
in no cases much lower in nitrate nitrogen content than the 
control soil, thus indicating that the peat treatments are 
at least not harmful as Indicated by nitrate nitrogen content. 
Actually the soil treated with subsurface peat alone was 
distinctly higher in nitrates than the control soil® In 
this experiment it would appear from the average figures 
that the soil plus ammonium phosphate treatment is the 
highest in nitrate nitrogen content, but by scrutinizing 
Table 2 it is clearly seen that this is not consistently 
true during the whole experiment, because during the first 
half of the experiment the nitrates are higher in the surface 
peat plus ammonium phosphate. In the final averaged figures

(Table 2) the soil plus surface peat plus ammonium phosphate 
rank second in nitrate nitrogen content and subsurface peat 
plus ammonium phosphate is the third highest® The subsurface 
peat plus triple superphosphate treatment is but very little 
higher in nitrate nitrogen than the control soil* The 
ammonium phosphate treatments show in two cases a nitrate 
nitrogen content of 100 pants per million which is the high¬ 
est figure obtained in this experiment* The average moisture 
content of all treatments averaged finally from 15 per cent® 
to 19*1 per cent®, this being about as close to the optimum 
as the moisture content could be controlled under the con¬ 
ditions of this investigation® The outstanding features of 
the nitrate nitrogen data in Table 2 are as follows: 

(a) The absence of any outstanding depressing 
effect of mixing peat with soil as indicated by nitrate 
nitrogen content® 

(b) The total absence of any beneficial effect 
of the use of triple superphosphate together with peat in 
such treatments® 

(c) The fact that the surface peat and ammonium 
phosphate treatment showed a higher nitrate nitrogen average 
than the subsurface peat and ammonium phosphate fertilizer 
treatment* 

(d) The wide difference in nitrate nitrogen content 
between the surface peat treatment and the subsurface peat

treatment indicating that the subsurface peat is more 
beneficial when applied alone than the surface peat treatment. 

In studying the tables (3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8) con¬ 
taining the yields of the crops grown in this experiment, it 
must first be noted that the second crop was poor and showed 
very few significant differences because a great many of the 
plants were sterile and produced no seed, but if the grain 
plus straw yields are studied some differences are seen* 

The third crop was grown completely in the greenhouse and 
here considerable damage was caused by insect pests, hence 
the grain yields are not very indicative of what the crop 
looked like* 

Again in the crop yield tables there are no very 
great differences to be noted between the control yields and 
the yields from the surface and subsurface peat treatments, 
but the subsurface peat treatment in every case shows a 
higher yield than the surface peat treatment (Tables 3, 4, 5, 
6, 7 and 8). The application of ammonium phosphate gave 
better yields than the application of peat alone* 

The treatments where ammonium phosphate or sulfate 
was combined with surface or subsurface peat gave the best 
yields* The triple superphosphate with subsurface peat was 
little better than the control yields* The ammonium phosphate 
plus subsurface peat gave the highest yields, this being 
particularly true in the cases of the first and fourth crops.

In Table 8 showing the average of all grain yields the 
subsurface peat plus ammonium phosphate treatment showed 
a grain yield approximately three times as great as the 
control yields and more than one and one half times as great 
as the yield where ammonium phosphate was applied alone. 

The ammonium sulfate and subsurface peat appeared beneficial 
but not to the same extent as subsurface peat plus ammonium 
phosphate. 

The features to be noted in connection with the 
yields (Tables 3, 4* 5, 6, 7 and 8) are as follows; 

(a) The slight increases due to applying only 
peat to soil, 

(b) The consistently higher yields of subsurface 
peat treatments over surface peat treatments, 

(c) The distinctly higher yields where peat was 
combined with a nitrogen phosphate fertilizer as compared 
with the nitrogen phosphate fertilizer alone, 

(d) The consistently higher yields of the subsur¬ 
face peat and ammonium phosphate treatments as compared to 
the surface peat and ammonium phosphate treatments,

growth and also just before it was harvested will

Fertilizers applied to 1st and 4th crops 




















The Second Experiment 


As stated before this experiment is an exact 
duplication of the first experiment except that it was started 
in May, 1936, instead of in November, 1935 (see plan Table 1>* 
In this experiment the nitrate nitrogen content 
(Table 9) would indicate that the surface peat had a slightly 
depressing effect* This stands out fairly distinctly In the 
treatment where surface peat was applied in combination with 
ammonium phosphate* The nitrate nitrogen content of the soil 
treated with subsurface peat, on the other hand, is very high 
and Is even greater than where the subsurface peat is combined 
with ammonium phosphate* The triple superphosphate and sub¬ 
surface peat treatment show the lowest nitrate nitrogen 
content of the whole series and Is even considerably lower 
than the control* The ammonium sulfate and subsurface peat 
treatment Is noticeably low in nitrate nitrogen in comparison 
with the other nitrogen treatments* 

In the nitrate nitrogen data of the Second Experiment 
(Table 9) the following features are worthy of note; 

(a) The slightly depressing effect of the surface 

peat. 


(b) The distinctly beneficial effect of the sub¬ 
surface peat both alone and In combination with the nitrogen 


fertilizers

(c) The depressing effect of the triple super¬ 
phosphate on nitrate nitrogen content towards the end of 
the experiment for which we have no satisfactory explanation. 

In this experiment the grain yields with th© 
exception of subsurface peat plus ammonium phosphate do not 
show any very striking differences when they are averaged 
(Tables 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14). The combination treatment 
of subsurface peat and ammonium phosphate gave distinctly 
the best yields with the ammonium phosphate treatment ranking 
second. The yields from the subsurface peat plus triple 
superphosphate treatment were little better than those of 


the control

The Third Experiment 


This experiment is a duplication of the two 
preceding except that peat with a distinctly acid reaction 
was used instead of peat with a neutral reaction. 

Here again the nitrate nitrogen content (see Table 
15) of the surface and subsurface treatments appears to be 
slightly higher than in the case of the control* at least 
there is no evidence of a depressing effect. The ammonium 
phosphate treatment alone sho¥/s a high content of nitrate 
nitrogen in comparison with the treatments of surface and 
subsurface peat. The surface peat plus ammonium phosphate 
and subsurface peat plus ammonium phosphate show no difference 
in average nitrate nitrogen content. This similarity is 
also borne out by the surface peat treatment when compared 
with the subsurface peat treatment* the average difference 
here being only 2.2 parts per million. The nitrate nitro¬ 
gen content of the soil treated with triple superphosphate 
in addition to subsurface peat is again very low, being 
even less than the control. In this experiment the effect 
of the subsurface peat plus ammonium sulfate is particularly 
noteworthy. It is distinctly and consistently the highest 
in nitrate nitrogen content; the average being 23.0 parts 
per million higher in nitrate nitrogen than in the soil 
treated with ammonium phosphate, which ranked second*

In studying the crop yields (Tablss 16, 17, 18, 

19 and 20) it must first be noted that the second crop is 
of no significance as no significant differences are shown 
and the yields were very poor in all cases* In this exper¬ 
iment the average nitrate nitrogen content of the ammonium 
sulfate plus subsurface peat treatment is very high, hut a 
corresponding increase is not shown in the average crop 
yields from this treatment. If anything the crop yields 
when averaged show instead the same general trends as those 
found in experiment one and two* 

The yields of the surface and subsurface treatments 
(especially the latter) are somewhat higher on the average 
than the yields in the case of the control. Then a decided 
increase in yield is found in the ammonium phosphate treat¬ 
ment, but it is not quite as high as where surface and 
subsurface peat was combined with ammonium phosphate. The 
subsurface peat plus ammonium phosphate treatment gave the 
highest yields, and the treatments containing subsurface peat 
were found to give higher yields than surface peat treatments« 
The triple superphosphate and subsurface peat treatment was 
again very low^ranking just above the control. The yield 
from the subsurface peat plus the ammonium sulfate treatment 
was not as high as the nitrate nitrogen tables indicated it 
might have been. Here again as in the first and second 
experiments the ammonium phosphate combined with peat

FOURTH EXPERIMENT OR BACTERIAL NUMBERS 


This experiment was carried out with the object 
of finding out how treatments of peat and commercial 
fertilizers would affect the numbers of bacteria in gray 
wooded soil* As stated in the outline of the investigation 
the bacterial numbers were determined by the plate method 
first and then the experiment was repeated and the numbers 
determined by the ratio method* 

The results of the counts made by the plat© method 
are contained in Table 22 . The results show that the 
numbers of bacteria Increased very materially In all treat¬ 
ments except the control during the first month. In the 
case of the control the bacterial numbers do not vary very 
materially throughout the whole experiment. At the end of 
the first month the bacterial numbers reached their highest 
point In half of the treatments and in all treatments before 
the end of the third month. 

Over the whole period of the experiment th© highest 
counts of bacteria were found in the cases of surface peat 
plus ammonium phosphate, the subsurface peat plus ammonium 
phosphate, and the subsurface peat plus ammonium sulfate 
treatments. In all three cases these treatments attained 
numbers of 7 millions per gram or over. After approximately

a period of three months the bacterial numbers in each 
treatment level out, until, at the end of the experiment 
or after five months, there is very little difference 
between any of th© eight treatments. The subsurface peat 
plus triple superphosphate treatment shows somewhat more 
bacteria than the control but is lower in bacterial numbers 
than any of the other peat plus fertilizer treatments. 

In studying the averages over the whole period th© 
subsurface peat plus ammonium phosphate treatment shows the 
highest number of bacteria, with the surface peat plus 
ammonium phosphate ranking second and the subsurface peat 
plus ammonium sulfate third* Regarding any difference in 
bacterial numbers between surface and subsurfa.ee peat treat¬ 
ments the table shows no significant differences. 

It can be concluded then from these results that 
the addition of peat alone and of peat and commercial fertil¬ 
izers cause increases in the numbers of bacteria in gray 
wooded soil as shown by the plat© and ratio methods of 
counting* 

In studying Tables 23 to 33 showing th© results of 
the ratio method of counting, the first and most striking 
feature is the great number of bacteria shown by the ratio 
method. Instead of the bacteria numbers ranging from about 
one-half million to about eight million per gram of soil as 
in the plate count method, the numbers range from about two 
hundred million to two billion in the ratio method* Thus

it is evident that only a very small fraction of the bacteria 
actually present in the soil will grow on ordinary nutrient 
media. Table 33 shows that the bacterial numbers were con¬ 
siderably higher in the soil treated with peat and commercial 
fertilisers than in the control soil* The soil treated with 
subsurface peat and ammonium phosphate was the first to show 
a high number of bacteria* the numbers in this treatment 
reaching over a billion per gram almost one month before any 
of the other treatments reach such a. figure* The bacterial 
counts were found to reach a maximum about three months after 
the application of the peat and fertilizers* Prom then on, 
the bacterial numbers began to level out until by the end of 
the experiment, there were no very large differences between 
the different treatments* The table shows that the soil 
treated with subsurface peat and ammonium phosphate usually 
contained the highest number of bacteria throughout the 
experiment* The averages show that the surface peat plus 
ammonium phosphate ranks second and the subsurface peat and 
ammonium sulfate third in bacterial numbers* 

The results of the ratio method of counting differ 
from the results of the plate count experiment in that th© 
numbers of bacteria are relatively higher in the soil treated 
with subsurface peat plus triple superphosphate in the ratio 
method than in the soil treated with surface peat alone. 

With this one exception the averages show that the treatments

rank in the same order of bacterial n-umbers as in the plat© 
count method* The same general conclusions will therefor© 
hold for there is not much difference between the average 
numbers of bacteria in the soil treated with surface peat 
alone and soil treated with both subsurface peat and triple 
superphosphate in either experiment* 

The following conclusions can b© drawn from these 
two experimentss 

1* The ratio method of counting shows that there 
is a tremendously greater number of bacteria present in the 
soil than the plate count method indicates® 

2. Soil treated with peat and peat plus fertilizers 
has greater bacterial activity than the control soil® 

5® Soil treated with subsurface and surface peat 
plus ammonium phosphate treatments shows greater bacterial 
activity than soil treated with subsurface peat plus ammonium 
sulfate, and the subsurface peat plus ammonium sulfat© treat¬ 
ment stimulates greater bacterial activity than the triple 
superphosphate plus subsurface peat treatment*

FIFTH EXPERIMENT OR COMPARISON OF THE EFFECT OF PEAT, 
STRAW AND COTTON ON NITRATE NITROGEN CONTENT 


Because a great deal of experimental work has 
shown that certain kinds of organic matter when added to 
mineral soil depress the nitrate nitrogen content, and 
because in this Investigation peat was found to have rather 
the opposite effect, it was felt necessary to set up an 
experiment where peat could be compared with straw and 
cotton. Two different types of soil were used, a black 
fertile soil in one case, and a gray wooded relatively 
Infertile soil in another case. The results of the exper¬ 
iment are found in Tables 35 and 36. 

Dealing with the gray soil first the results show 
that in the treatments where peat, cotton and straw were 
added alone the peat did not depress nitrate nitrogen, 
while the straw and cotton did cause a lowering of nitrates. 
The cotton especially caused nitrate nitrogen to disappear 
for a period of about three months. The effect of the 
stray/ was less drastic, a recovery being made after the 
first month. The treatment where peat was applied alone 
continued to be the highest in nitrate nitrogen content 
(except In February) until near the end of the experiment 
when the straw treatment over-took It. Comparing the peat, 
stray/ and cotton treatments it is seen (Tables 35 and 36) 
that the application of cotton lowers the nitrate nitrogen

content to a much greater extent than does the straw* In 
the final averaged results the gray wooded soil treated with peat 
is about two parts per million lower In nitrate nitrogen 
than the control soil, but this difference Is not considered 
significant* The results then would Indicate that at no 
time did the application of peat depress nitrate nitrogen 
content while the straw application caused a depression when 
first applied and the cotton caused a lowering of the nitrate 
nitrogen content throughout the experiment* 

As borne out In other results discussed previously 
where peat and ammonium phosphate are combined this appli¬ 
cation seems to be very beneficial as indicated by nitrate 
nitrogen accumulation* Where ammonium phosphate is combined 
with stray/, no depression of nitrate nitrogen appears® 

Ammonium phosphate in combination with peat perhaps shows 
the most beneficial results, this treatment giving the 
highest average nitrate nitrogen content in this experiment* 

The following conclusions can be drawn from the 

results: 

1* Peat, when mixed with gray wooded soil did 
not cause any significant decrease in nitrification and 
caused an Increase later, whereas the straw caused a 
decided decrease at first, and the cotton reduced the 
nitrate to practically nothing for a period of about three 


months

2. When ammonium phosphate was added to gray 
soil nitrification was greatly increased® 

3. When ammonium phosphate was added together 
with the organic matter, nitrification was greatly retarded 
by cotton but not by the straw or peat® 

In the case of the black soil the trends are some¬ 
what the same although the application of the straw and 
cotton do not appear to be quite so harmful as in the case 
of the gray soil* Nitrification was again greatly stimulated 
by the addition of ammonium phosphate to the black soil® 

When mixed with the black soil the peat did not 
cause any significant decrease in nitrification, whereas the 
straw caused some decrease at first and the cotton ©specially 
caused considerable decrease (see Table 36)« 

When ammonium phosphate was added together with 
the organic matter nitrification was apparently not retarded 
by the peat, straw or cotton* 

It would appear then from this experiment that 
adding peat to gray or black soil is not harmful but that 
adding carbonaceous materials like straw and cotton lower 
nitrate nitrogen, especially during the period immediately 
after they are added* Also, the results indicate that the 
application of such carbonaceous materials as straw and 
cotton tend to lower nitrate nitrogen in the case of the 
gray wooded soil to a greater extent than in the case of 


the black soil

DISCUSSION OF RESULTS 


This investigation is made up of several different 
experiments, and the results vary in Individual cases, but 
show throughout the whole experiment several general trends 
which are worthy of note. In the first place this Inquiry 
indicates that from a chemical standpoint the application 
of peat such as was used In these experiments is not harmful* 
This in Itself is noteworthy because other experimenters 
have found that where the carbon to nitrogen ratio is as 
high as it Is in the peat used, the application of such 
material was definitely harmful* As suggested by Norman 
(12) the avilability of the carbon is probably a factor to 
be considered because If much of the carbon is unavailable 
then the true carbon to nitrogen ratio would be much lower* 

No other explanation of why peat should be beneficial when 
wheat straw Is harmful under identical conditions is offered* 
As stated before, the fertilizer treatment plan 
of the experiment was not made more complete because of the 
labor involved in carrying out a more complete plan* The 
one fertilizer which was applied alone, as well as in com¬ 
bination with peat, was ammonium phosphate 16-20* This 
fertilizer contains sulphur as well as nitrogen and phosphorus, 
and is one of the best general purpose fertilizers for gray 
wooded soils. No attempt was made to cover the physical

side of the investigation, although this might be 
especially important here, as the investigation indicates 
that, while applications of surface and subsurface peat 
alone are not harmful, on the other hand the benefits are 
not pronounced* This is particularly true in the case of 
the surface peat, which is naturally less available because 
it is less decomposed, that is to say the carbon to nitrogen 
ratio is much wider in the surface peat than it is in the 
subsurface peat. However, it is felt that if the physical 
side could be studied the application of peat alone would 
be found to be decidedly beneficial to the gray wooded 
soils. The reason for this belief is more than theoretical 
because it was noticed in handling the soil of the different 
treatments that where peat was applied, there appeared to 
be more structure, less tendency to bake and a greater water 
holding capacity. Hence it is believed that peat applied 
alone would be much more beneficial than is indicated by 
this investigation. 

Another significant feature of this discussion is 
that on the whole, application of ammonium phosphate alone 
appeared to give better results than the application of, 
at least, the surface peat alone# This result also involves 
the physical side of the problem, in that where ammonium 
phosphate is applied alone any physical benefits of applying 
peat would be missed.

The investigation clearly indicates that ammonium 
phosphate in combination with surface or subsurface peat is 
beneficial when mixed with gray wooded soil* Although this 
is shown by the wheat yields it is, perhaps, most clearly 
and consistently indicated in that part of the experiment 
which deals with bacterial numbers* The increases in 
bacterial numbers are large and definite, especially where 
the ratio count method was used* 

Another interesting aspect of the investigation 
is the poor showing of the treatments where the combination 
of triple superphosphate and subsurface peat was applied to 
gray wooded soil. In many cases throughout the investigation 
this particular treatment showed lower results than the 
treatment with subsurface peat alone, thus indicating that 
the phosphate alone might even have been somewhat harmful® 

Ho satisfactory explanation of this can as yet be offered® 

In comparing the surface peat treatments with 
subsurface peat treatments, results were obtained about as 
would be expected® The subsurface peat alone seemed to be 
more beneficial than the surface peat treatment* This Is 
logical because the subsurface peat used was much darker 
in color, indicating that decomposition had gone much 
farther than in the case of the surface peat* 

No very significant differences were found between 
the use of the neutral Stony Plain peat and acid Chip Lake

peat, except that the nitrate nitrogen content appeared to 
be higher where the acid peat was combined with ammonium 
sulfate than where the neutral peat was used in combination 
with ammonium sulphate« 

In conclusion it can be emphasized that the us© 
of peat as a soil amendment at least, is not harmful, and 
that when it is combined with a commercial fertilizer like 
ammonium phosphate it is distinctly beneficial*

SUMMARY 


(1) Peat applied alone to Fallis gray wooded soil 
In pot culture experiments was definitely not harmful even 
during the period immediately after application, as indicated 
by the soil’s nitrate nitrogen content, bacterial numbers 
and crop producing power* 

(2) The application of surface peat alone to gray 
wooded soil increased the bacterial numbers but did not 
increase the nitrate nitrogen and crop yields significantly* 

(3) Subsurface peat was found to be more benefic¬ 
ial than surface peat as indicated by increased bacterial 
numbers and nitrate nitrogen* Crop yields where subsurface 
peat alone was applied were likewise somewhat higher on the 
average than the control yields* 

(4) The combination of surface peat with ammonium 
phosphate was more beneficial than ammonium phosphate alone 
as indicated by larger numbers of bacteria and slightly 
larger crop yields, but on the whole nitrate nitrogen is 
greater where the ammonium phosphate alone was applied* 

(5) Throughout the whole experiment, with but few 
exceptions, the combination of subsurface peat and ammonium 
phosphate gave better results than ammonium phosphate alone 
as shown by larger crop yields and bacterial numbers, but 
nitrate nitrogen was generally rather higher where ammonium 
phosphate alone was applied*

(6) High bacterial numbers were especially 
evident in the case of the combined subsurface peat and 
ammonium phosphate treatment. 

(7) Measurements of crop yields, nitrate nitrogen 
and bacterial numbers indicated that the application of a 
combination of subsurface peat and triple superphosphate 
was of no significant benefit to the wooded soils. 

(8) The ratio method of counting bacteria was 
found to give very much higher numbers than the plate count 
method, and because of the greater numbers of bacteria 
counted is considered to give a much closer approximation 
of the actual number of bacteria in the soil than the plate 
count method. 

(9) Straw and cotton, when mixed with gray wooded 
soil, were found to be definitely harmful during the earlier 
stages of the experiment as sho¥/n by the reduction in nitrate 
nitrogen. During the latter stages of the experiment the 
cotton continued to depress nitrate nitrogen but the straw 
did not. The peat on the other hand showed no depressing 
effect in the early or later stages of the experiment. 

(10) The harmful effect of mixing straw or cotton 
with gray wooded soil, as measured by reduction in nitrate 
nitrogen content, was lessened in the case of cotton, and 
eliminated in the case of straw, by adding ammonium phosphate 
with the straw or cotton.
