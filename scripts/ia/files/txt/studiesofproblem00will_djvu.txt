STUDIES OF PROBLEMS RELATED TO THE PRODUCTION OF 
2,3-BUTYLENE GLYCOL BY AEROBACTER FERMENTATION 


W. C. HINMAN 


INTRODUCTION 


The critical rubber shortage which developed among 
the Allied Nations during the early years of the present world 
conflict when Japan seized the major areas of natural rubber 
production has resulted in the extensive development of the 
synthetic rubber industry. Several methods have been developed 
for the production of synthetic rubber, most of them using by- 
products from the petroleum industry. In view of the possible 
exhaustion of this source and the increasing demand for rubber 
products together with the necessity of developing new uses 
for surplus agricultural products, interest was directed to¬ 
ward methods involving the use of grain and other agricultural 
products as sources of raw material. 

Synthetic rubber is made by polmerizing a mixture 
of 75 parts of butadiene with 25 parts of styrene. Butadiene 
the basic material is derived from three main sources: 

1. Petroleum. 

2. Ethyl alcohol. 

3. 2,3-butylene glycol.

Alcohol and 2,3-butylene glycol (referred to henceforth as 
glycol) can be produced from grain by fermentation. 

Efforts were directed toward the development of a 
process for the production of glycol from grain commercially 
by bacterial fermentation. Although the method was not developed 
in time to become a factor in sythetic rubber production it 
still has commercial possibilities. Butadiene of very high 
purity, far exceeding that derived from alcohol, can be pro¬ 
duced by this method in a simple and direct manner. Also after 
the war this bacterial fermentation process may develop into a 
commercial source of glycol since glycol has many potential 
industrial uses which, though not yet intensively explored, ap¬ 
pear very promising and 2,3-butylene glycol may replace ethy¬ 
lene and other glycols in many applications. 

This investigation was conducted in both Canada and 
the United States in close cooperation with one another and 
was centralized at the Northern Regional Research Laboratory 
at Peoria. Under the direction of the National Research Coun¬ 
cil at Ottawa the Soils and the Plant Science departments of 
the University of Alberta undertook a joint laboratory study 
of the fermentation process for producing glycol. 

Two types of fermentation were studied under this 
investigation — one involving Aerobacillus oolvmvxa which 
ferments starch directly and produces the levo form of glycol, 
and the other Aerobacter aerogenes which ferments sugar, the

starch being converted to sugar by a saccharifying agent* 

The latter produces the meso form of glycol* Formerly Aero - 
bac i llu s fermentation was studied by the division of Plant 
Pathology, Department of Plant Science and the Aerohacter fer¬ 
mentation by the division of Soil Microbiology of the Soils 
Department, the analytical work being done by the Biochemical 
division of the Department of Plant Science. Later when the 
main laboratory phase of the investigation neared completion 
anaylsis of the fermentation liquors was done by the respec¬ 
tive groups who carried out the fermentations. 

Different phases of the project have been reported 
on by A.L. Shewfelt, A.W. Jackson, W.G. Corns and A.C. Black¬ 
wood in their respective theses so that all three sections of 
the project were completely covered. This thesis represents 
a continuation of the section reported on by Blackwood — 
namely Aerobacter fermentation.

REVIEW OP' LITERATURE 


The production of 2,3-butylene glycol by fermentation 
was first discovered in England in 1904* Since then it has been 
found that at least three different species of bacteria produce 
this compound during fermentation, among them the Aerobacter 
grttu^. According to Bergey f s Manual of Determinative Bacter¬ 
iology (2) Aerobacter aerogenes the type species is listed as 
a short rod, 0.5 to 0.8 by 1.0 to 2.0 microns, occurring singly, 
non-motile, non-spore forming, frequently capsulated, gram ne¬ 
gative and facultative aerobic. 

Most sugars including glucose, maltose, sucrose, lac¬ 
tose, galactose, levuiose and the pentoses are readily fermented 
by this organism. Starch and dextrins are fermented very sloYrly 
if at all. The products of fermentation according to Hardin and 
Walpole (9) and also Reynolds and Workmann (17) are 2,3-butylene 
glycol and small amounts of alcohol, acetylmethyl carbinol, formic, 
lactic, acetic and succinic acids. Also carbon dioxide and hydro¬ 
gen gases are produced in small amounts in the ratio of 2:1. The 
metabolic breakdown of glucose in the fermentation has been in¬ 
vestigated and discussed by several investigators (1, 13)• 

Among the es^rly investigators who attempted to perfect 
the fermentation were Verhave ( 23 ) who developed a process using 
C lostridium polymyxa or Aerobacter aerogenes , and Fulmer et al 
(8) using Aerobacter pictinovium . Kendall tested four organisms 
that gave similar results and he lists several factors

affecting the fermentation. He estimated that 50$ of the sugar 
consumed is converted to glycol by this fermentation. Kluyver 
(13) at Delft University in Holland, patented in 1924 a method 
of producing 2,3-butylene glycol commercially by fermentation 
using a simple carbohydrate media. 

The Northern Regional Research Laboratory of the 
United States Department of Agriculture, in cooperation with 
several industrial laboratories, was the first to begin a large 
scale intensive investigation to develop the commercial aspects of 
this fermentation. Using their strain which they isolated 
early in the project and designated as A. aerogenes #199 they 
were able to obtain glycol yields which approached the maximum 
amount obtainable. They developed an agar medium for storing 
the organism and standard methods of handling the culture (16). 
Other laboratories (3* 18, 22) isolated and tested many other 
strains of A. aerogenes but no isolate was found which was 
superior in fermenting ability to #199. Seagrams (4) in 1944 
found that strain #766 isolated at the University of Y/isconsin 
was more valuable than #199. This strain was used in their 
pilot plant tests and found very satisfactory. 

It has been quite generally accepted that 5% ino¬ 
culum be used in the fermentation although some laboratories 
(16) have suggested using up to 10$. Transferring directly 
from the slant to the inoculum media gave better yields than 
frequent transferring from liquid media (18), although the fre-

quently transferred gave a more vigorous growth. The Univer¬ 
sity of Wisconsin (22) found that age and size of the inoculum 
made very little difference and they preferred using 5% of a 
12 hour inoculum. Seagrams (ll) obtained best results with a 
20 hour inoculum. Heyden Chemical Corporation (10) suggest 
using an inoculum shaken 18 hours at 90 cycles per minute, at 32° 
C. The Schenely Research Institute (19) got consistently higher 
yields of glycol by carrying the cultures from an agar slant 
through four generations on synthetic medium and then one gen¬ 
eration on cooker mash, the final culture being aerated to ac¬ 
climatize the organism to this treatment. Seagrams (ll) sug¬ 
gest that their rich synthetic inoculum is superior to N.R.R.L. 
corn steep liquor medium. University of Wisconsin also found 
Seagrams® inoculum to give higher yields of glycol. 

A great deal of work has been done to develop an 
optimum fermentation medium. It was found (16) that small 
amounts of magnesium sulphate, about 0.025%, and of potassium 
acid phosphate, about 0.180%, were essential in glucose media. 
Seagrams used ammonia as a nitrogen source in their pilot plant 
investigations (y+). When urea is used as the nitrogen source 
successful fermentations can be obtained without the use of cal¬ 
cium carbonate as a buffer, but when ammonium sulphate is used 
calcium carbonate is necessary since the medium becomes too acid 
for normal growth of the organism and both glucose consumption 
and glycol production are inhibited (16). It is quite generally

agreed that the calcium carbonate must be sterilized separately 
either dry or in a slurry since at the temperature of sterili¬ 
zation the calcium carbonate causes a partial transformation of 
the glucose, and the products formed are not fermentable by A. 
aero g enes . The N.R.R.L. found that salt additions were not 
necessary in malt hydrolyzed corn mash (16). This was confirmed 
by the Schenely Research Institute (IS) if salts were used in 
the inoculum* Blackwood (3) reported a small increase in yield 
when salts were added to malt hydrol;/zed wheat mash at the time 
of inoculation. The mash may be saccharified in either of two 
ways — by the use of malt or by acid hydrolysis. Schenely 
Research Institute (ig) found that malt hydrolyzed medium gave 
a faster fermentation with increased yields of glycol. This was 
also confirmed by Blackwood who found that calcium oxide or 
sodium carbonate were necessary in acid hydrolyzed media to 
maintain a proper pH. Malt hydrolyzed medium must be resteri¬ 
lized after hydrolysis because A. aerogenes cannot compete with 
the contamination introduced with the malt. The University of 
Wisconsin (22) reported that unsterilized malt sprouts added to 
synthetic medium resulted in a faster fermentation, but that 
heating destroyed this stimulating factor. Seagrams (ll) found 
that malt sprouts added to grain mashes gave neither an in¬ 
creased yield nor a speed up in rate of fermentation; instead 
2% unsterilized malt sprouts had a c iebriinentAl effect on the 
fermentation due to contamination introduced into the medium.

A fermentation temperature of 30°C has been sug¬ 
gested by most investigators as the optimum. The N.R.R.L. (16) 
found that a temperature of 37°C gives a more vigorous fer¬ 
mentation but results in reduced glycol yields. This is con¬ 
firmed by Schenely Research Institute (19). Heyden Chemical 
Corporation (10) reports that within a range of 31 to 35°C, 
the temperature of incubation has no significant effect on 
the yield of glycol and carbinol, but that the rate of fermen¬ 
tation is fastest at the highest temperature. 

Aeration is one of the most important single variable 
factors affecting the fermentation. Its exact role is not 
clearly understood although it is quite generally accepted 
that it exerts a physical rather than a chemical action* Al¬ 
though the organism is classified by some as an obligate aerobe 
no oxygen is needed to balance any equations representing the 
breakdown of sugar to glycol (13* 17). The National Research 
Council at Ottawa (15) reported that nitrogen may replace air 
and give a normal fermentation, but this has not been verified 
by other laboratories. In small batches mechanical agitation 
gave yields comparable to those obtained ?fhen the mash was 
aerated but this could not be reproduced in large batches (19). 
Stirring with a mixer has been reported to give good results 
in small batches (8, 17, 22). In larger samples agitation and 
aeration together gave a normal fermentation (16).

The rate of aeration is an important factor and has 
received much attention by numerous investigators* The con¬ 
ditions affecting the rate of aeration are: volume of medium, 
distance through which the air must travel, type of fermentor, 
stage of fermentation and desired time of fermentation. The 
Schenely Research Institute suggests a rate of QX)1 to 0.05 
cu.ft. per minute per litre of mash. Heavy rates of aeration 
speed up the fermentation but cause oxidation of part of the 
glycol to acetylmethyl carbinol especially towards the end 
of the fermentation. They also suggest that the fermenta¬ 
tion takes place in two stages — the first one aerobic and 
the latter one anaerobic. This anaerobic stage reduces the 
yield of acetylmethyl carbinol and increases the glycol yield, 
and sugar continues to be consumed. Aer ation should be dis¬ 
continued when the residual sugar reaches 3*0%. The N.R.R.L. 
(16) suggests a rate of 20 cc per litre per minute in a rotary 
drum fermentor and 200 cc in a vat fermentor. The Schenely 
Research Institute (19) reports optimum yields using 510 ce 
per litre per minute and they got higher yields when the 
aeration was reduced to half after 36 hours. Seagrams (ll) 
suggest an aeration rate of.02 cu.ft. (567 cc) per minute per 
litre to be the optimum. Aeration for the whole fermentation 
gave better results than when discontinued during the latter 
part of the fermentation. Aeration is more effective when 
the air is broken down into small bubbles (10,23) and various 
aerators have been suggested. Less air is required in large

scale operation than in laboratory size tests. Seagrams (4) 
got higher yields in their pilot plant when aeration ?/ith 
agitation was used than with aeration alone. Proper agita¬ 
tion reduced the air requirements from 6.6 cu.ft. to 3.0 
cu.ft. per minute per 1000 gallons of mash. 

Several investigators have studied the effect of 
metalic ions on the growth of the organism. Seagrams (ll) 
found that copper was most toxic and was fatal in concentra¬ 
tions of 0.1 to 0.5 mg. per litre. Nickle, iron, zinc and 
chromium ions are inhibitory to a certain extent. Manganese, 
silver and mercury ions are stimulating in low concentration 
but inhibitory in high concentrations. The University of 
Wisconsin (22) reported that copper in concentrations up to 
2.0 mg. per litre and iron up to 15.0 mg. per litre had little 
effect on the fermentation, except that low concentrations 
had a stimulating effect on the rate of fermentation. 

Bactereophage was encountered during pilot plant 
studies both by Schenely Research Institute (13) and Sea¬ 
grams (11). Investigation has shown the phage or toxin to 
be weak in nature since ferments set with large inocula have 
undergone successful fermentation. 

There has not been much literature made available 
concerning pilot plant investigations of this project. How¬

glucose medium in a pilot plant. The glycol yield was 82 % 
of theoretical. The Schenely Research Institute (l8) ob¬ 
tained in their semi pilot plant a glycol yield of 14 to 15 
lbs. glycol per bushel of corn. Seagrams conducted pilot 
plant investigations, first using makeshift equipment which 
proved unsatisfactory, and later using a specially constructed 
pilot plant. They developed and described a process which 
can be adapted to commercial operation for the production of 
2,3-butylene glycol from wheat, and its conversion to buta¬ 
diene (4)* They obtained yields approaching the theoretical 
value of 50 % of the sugar consumed. The following products 
were recovered — 14*5 lbs. glycol, 0.83 lbs. ethyl alcohol 
and 105 lbs. acetymethyl carbinol per 56 lbs. bushel of 
wheat. Yields of 15*5 lbs. of glycol have been obtained per 
bushel of wheat in the pilot plant. These yields compare 
with 10 lbs. glycol and 6 lbs. alcohol per bushel of wheat 
using Aerobacillus fermentation.

OBJECTS OF THE INVESTIGATION 


The objects of the investigation were as fol¬ 
lows : 

1* To maintain the original aim of the pro¬ 
ject, i.e., to develop a fermentation 
which would give a maximum yield of 2,3- 
butylene glycol in the shortest practical 
time. 

2. To study some of the problems which had 

arisen out of this investigation such as -- 
aeration, prevention of foaming during 
aeration, storing and handling the organism 
Aerobacter aerogenes % and to make a com¬ 
parison of different starchy or sugar 
materials as sources of raw material for 


the fermentation

METHODS MP-.MA TERI .ALS 

Unless otherwise indicated 10$ dextrose media were 
used for all fermentations, with added salts and urea as 
described by the N.R.R.L. (16,) or else 15$ malt hydrolyzed 
wheat mash. Fermentations were made in large test tubes 
containing 100 cc of medium. These were inoculated with 5$ 
of 18 to 24 hour inoculum. The inoculum used was that de¬ 
veloped by the Schenely Research Institute (18) and two trans¬ 
fers were made before seeding the fermentation medium. The 
tubes were aerated in series at the rate of 500 cc per minute 
per litre of medium, the same air leaving one tube and enter¬ 
ing the next, thus insuring the same rate of aeration in 
each tube. This technique aided in minimizing differences 
in yield between replicates due to differences in rate of 
aeration. In nearly every instance the fermentations were 
allowed to run until the residual sugar had reached a level 
approaching 0.5$ or less. This was to obviate the necessity 
of determining residual sugars on the fermented liquors, since 
time did not always permit sugar analysis on each sample. 

Since lerobacter aerogenes fermentations are primarily con¬ 
cerned with the sole end product 2,3-butylene glycol, car- 
binol and alcohol determinations were omitted in the major¬ 
ity of tests.

All wheat mashes were malt hydrolyzed, as this 
eliminated the necessity of neutralizing the medium, in con¬ 
trast to acid hydrolyzed mashes, and the fermenting cultures 
were much more easily buffered. Also more uniform results 
could be obtained using malt hydrolyzed mash than with acid 
hydrolyzed mashes. 

The methods of analyses were those developed by the 
Plant Science department (5), with the exception of glycol 
determinations on fermented beet molasses. There was some 
substance or factor present in the beet molasses which in¬ 
ter f erred with the glycol determination, and it was found 
necessary to alter the procedure. Only one ml. of super- 
natent liquor was used for analysis instead of three as had 
been suggested, and the quantities of copper sulphate and 
calcium hydroxide were doubled. The amounts of acid and 
phosphate buffer were adjusted to produce a clear end point* 
The final result is multiplied by three. Also it was neces¬ 
sary to rim a blank using unfermented beet molasses. Follow¬ 
ing this procedure good recovery of glycol was obtained from 
beet molasses solutions of known glycol concentration.

RESULTS 


1. Aeration Studies 

Aeration has proven to he one of the most impor¬ 
tant single variable factors affecting the fermentation; 
perhaps the most important. Its exact role is not entirely 
understood but its effect is very apparent and readily de¬ 
monstrated. In previous work done at this laboratory the 
major portion of the variation between replicates in the 
same test was attributed to the ineffective control of the 
rate of aeration. Later during the investigation it was 
found that this variation between replicates could be very 
effectively but not wholly eliminated by aerating in series, 
the same air leaving one sample tube and entering the next. 
Consequently by using tightly fitting connections the rate 
of aeration in each tube was exactly the same and could be 
easily measured and controlled. This more reliable tech¬ 
nique opened the way for further study on the effect of 
aeration. It was quite generally believed that aeration 
produced a physical rather than a chemical effect upon the 
fermentation. Therefore a series of experiments was 
planned using different gases as the aerating medium in 
order to investigate and substantiate these conclusions. 

In these experiments N.R.R.L. dextrose medium (16) 
containing 10$ dextrose was used and it was fermented in

large test tubes containing 100 cc of medium,and aerated 
at the rate of 500 cc of air per minute per litre of me¬ 
dium* The fermentation was allowed to run until the sugar 
had all been consumed (i.e. less than 1% remained in the 
fermentation liquor.) The liquors were then analysed for 
glycol and alcohol and the results are reported in Table 
1. The gases used in these tests were air, nitrogen, 
hydrogen and carbon dioxide. 

The results of this experiment show that the 
effect of aeration is primarily a physical one since in 
every instance the fermentation did go to completion 
(i*e. all the sugar was consumed) in a much shorter in¬ 
cubation period than when no aeration was employed. At the 
same time there is an indication that aeration has a chemi¬ 
cal effect which although less marked seems to be impor¬ 
tant and should not be overlooked. Aeration with gases 
other than air retarded the rate of fermentation very 
noticeably, carbon dioxide retarding it more than hydrogen 
or nitrogen. Also it will be noted that the products of 
the fermentation were materially changed. The yield of 
glycol was much reduced while the titratable acidity 
(expressed as grams lactic acid) and alcohol were increased 
by the carbon dioxide, nitrogen and hydrogen. Carbinol 
was never found in the fermentation liquors when aerated 
with the pure gases whereas in the case of air there were

always traces of carbinol. It was noted that the car- 
binol increased if aeration was prolonged after the 
sugar was all consumed. This would seem to indicate that 
the glycol was oxidized to acetylmethyl carbinol. Stanier 
et al (20) have shown that Aerobacter aerogenes does 
oxidize glycol to carbinol, which they measured by the 
oxygen uptake. The fact that with aeration the fermen¬ 
tation will proceed to completion at an increased rate 
while at the same time the products of the fermentation 
are materially changed by the different pure gases in¬ 
dicates that the role of aeration is chemical as well 
as physical. 

The process of supplying sufficient sterilized 
air to maintain the fermentation on a large scale would 
undoubtedly present a difficult problem to the commer¬ 
cial producer. Blackw T ood (3) in his investigation found 
that the same air could be recycled through ten tubes of 
fermenting medium without hampering the fermentation. 

The air entered the first tube and escaped from the last 
one. With the results of this experiment in mind a 
study was made to determine to what extent the same air 
could be recycled through the fermentation medium with¬ 
out impairing the glycol yields. The practical value of 
this experiment lies in the possibility of eliminating 
the necessity of sterilizing fresh air throughout the

fermentation period. 

Since it was not possible in this laboratory- 
practice to collect the exhaust gases and recycle them 
through the cultures, the fermentations were carried out 
using varying mixtures of carbon dioxide and air as the 
aerating medium. It was assumed that it was probably the 
accumulation of carbon dioxide in a non-aerated fermenta¬ 
tion that accounted for at least part of the lack of ef¬ 
ficiency in this type of fermentation. Although hydrogen 
is also produced during the fermentation it was not consi¬ 
dered in this experiment since hydrogen gas is relatively 
inert. The following carbon dioxide and air mixtures were 
used: 

100$ carbon dioxide 
75$ carbon dioxide and 25 % air 
50 % carbon dioxide and 50 % air 
25% carbon dioxide and 15% air 
10$ carbon dioxide and 90$ air 
0$ carbon dioxide and 100$ air. 

Aeration with pure air was used to serve as a check. The 
aim was to determine the amount of carbon dioxide in the 
aerating medium which can be tolerated by the organism 
without affecting the fermentation detrimentally. The 
results of this experiment are recorded in Table 2 (A to F).

The results indicate that there was an in¬ 
creased glycol production as the ratio of air to carbon 
dioxide in the aerating medium increased, although the in¬ 
crease was not consistent particularly with the lower rate 
of aeration (250 cc per litre per minute). However air 
mixtures containing as much as 25 $ carbon dioxide had com¬ 
paratively little deleterious effect on the ability of 
the organism to ferment sugar to glycol, and at least 
part of this lowered glycol production may be due to nor¬ 
mal deterioration of the organism in its ability to fer¬ 
ment sugar to glycol (page 28) since the organism did 
undergo appreciable deterioration during the course of the 
experiments* The experiments were started 7/ith 100$ car¬ 
bon dioxide and carried on with progressively less carbon 
dioxide and more air* Pure air was also used at the be¬ 
ginning of the experiment* It is believed therefore that 
the organism Aerobaeter aerogenes may tolerate an air 
mixture containing as high as 25$ carbon dioxide without 
seriously affecting its fermenting efficiency. Providing 
a sufficient volume of air were used it seems quite pos¬ 
sible that the same air could be used throughout the fer¬ 
mentation by recycling, and this would make it unnecessary 
to sterilize a very large volume of air. 


This experiment brought out some other interest-

ing facts. There is an indication that more glycol is 
produced by the higher rate of aeration (500 cc per litre 
per minute), although the differences may not be statis¬ 
tically significant. Also the lower rate of aeration 
(250 cc per litre per minute) had a tendency to increase 
the amount of alcohol produced; again the results are not 
entirely consistent and may not be significant.

Foaming of the medium during aeration created 
quite a problem, especially when using high rates of 
aeration averaging around 500 cc per minute per litre of 
medium. This tendency was greatest in malt hydrolysed 
products, both filtered and unfiltered (3)• It was more 
noticeable when sodium carbonate was used as a buffer to 
neutralize the excess acidity. Several anti-foam agents, 
including amyl alcohol, commercial lard oil and oleic 
acid, had been used to conteract this tendency and al¬ 
though they were quite effective it was felt that they 
inhibited the fermentation to a greater or less extent. 

It was believed that the foaming was caused by 
the proteins present in the hydrolyzed wheat mash and 
since acid hydrolyzed medium showed less tendency toward 
foaming than did the malt hydrolyzed medium it was sur¬ 
mised that the foaming was due to the unhydrolyzed pro¬ 
teins. The proteins would undergo a greater degree of 
hydrolysis in the acid medium than in the malted medium. 
With this in mind a small amount of proteolytic enzyme 
(trypsin) was added with the malt to a two litre batch 
of wheat mash during the malt saccharifying process. The 
resulting medium showed no tendency toward foaming even 
when subjected to extremely high rates of aeration. The

medium to which no enzyme had been added foamed even at 
moderate aeration rates. This experiment substantiated 
the theory that it was the unhydrolyzed proteins that 
caused the foaming. 

Another object was to find an anti-foaming 
agent which did not have an inhibitory effect on the 
fermentation. Therefore, an experiment was carried out 
to compare the effect of hydrolysing the protein with 
that of adding anti-foaming agents. The anti-foaming 
agents used in this experiment were oleic acid and lub¬ 
ricating oil. For a check tubes were fermented without 
the addition of an anti-foaming agent. Five drops of 
the respective anti-foaming agent were added to the 
reaction tubes at the time of inoculation. The results 
of this experiment are reported in Table 3* 

This experiment was repeated on different days 
and reasonably consistent results were obtained each 
time. The use of oleic acid gave glycol yields which 
although slightly lower were probably not significantly 
lower than those of the check, and sugar utilization was 
just as rapid. Lubricating oil and trypsin gave yields 
which were higher, though not consistently higher, than 
those of the check. The alcohol yield was slightly lower 
with both of these agents. At the rate of aeration used 
in this experiment (750 cc per litre per minute) the use

of oleie acid had no marked inhibitory effect on the fermen¬ 
tation* Lubricating oil, however, can be used to replace 
oleic acid as an anti-foaming agent and may prove of super¬ 
ior value in this respect because it not only gives more 
favorable yields but is also much cheaper to employ. En¬ 
zyme hydrolysis is quite effective and may have advantages 
in laboratory practice, yet its use commercially is ques¬ 
tionable because of its high cost, and the large amounts 
which would be required in large scale commercial practices.

It was found by experiment that at least 0.01 grams of 
trypsin (not standardized) was required per litre of maeh 
to effectively stop foaming in four hours when applied 
to an 18% wheat mash. 

An experiment was conducted in an attempt to 
produce a malt ?/hich would sufficiently break down the 
protein during the malt hydrolyzing process to prevent 
foaming. The heat treatment in drying distiller’s malt 
inactivates most of the proteolytic enzymes present in 
the malted barley (24). Therefore a malt was produced in 
the laboratory and dried at a comparatively lov/ temperature 
(40°C). Tests were made using this malt and also distil¬ 
ler’s malt as a check. The malt ?/hich had been dried at 
40°C did not materially check the foaming even after mixing 
with the starchy material and standing as long as 36 hours 
in an oven at 55°C.

3 ♦ "Lvophilizationrc as a Method of Storing and Hand ling the 

£u1£jie&. 

It became apparent that the Aerobacter aerogenes 
organism when stored on agar medium frequently undergoes 
a degenerative variation losing part of its ability to 
utilize and ferment glucose to glycol. This variation 
was suspected early in the investigation and was reported 
both by this laboratory and the National Research Council 
at Ottawa. The Schenely Research Institute (13) also re- 
ported a degenerative tendency of the organism which they 
believe was due to mutation. Variation of this type is 
characteristic of organisms which undergo rapid prolific- 
cation. This degeneration occurred even v*rhen the organism 
was stored on slants in the refrigerator at 2°c without 
transferring. There is not only a decline in the activity 
of the organism but also a marked lowering of the glycol; 
alcohol production ratio , the ratio becoming lower as time 
elapses. Blackwood (3) has recorded a drop in the glycol: 
alcohol ratio of from 6.1.0 to 2.3:1.0. 

To obviate this degenerative tendency and main¬ 
tain the culture in good condition* i.e. produce glycol 
in yields approaching theoretical* a modified "lyophile™ 
method of drying the culture was tried. This method was 
suggested by the National Research Council at Ottawa and 
described by Dr. G. A. Ledingham (14) and is a modifica-

tion of the process developed by Flosdorf and Mudd (7). 

It consists primarily of rapidly freezing the culture in 
small tubes and drying under vacuum from the frozen state. 
The tubes are sealed under vacuum and stored at room tem¬ 
perature until required. That the organism could be 
stored and maintained in this condition seemed quite 
likely. Elser et al (6) have shown that bacteria can be 
maintained in a viable condition in this state for an 
almost indefinite period. Moreover, they have preserved 
such sensitive forms as meningococci in a viable state 
for a period of 18 years, and in no instance did they 
find that strains deviated after storage even in minor 
particulars from their behavior before they were subjected 
to the drying process. 

Several strains of the organism having different 
fermentative ability were !! lyophilized ?T at this laboratory — 
some by A.C. Blackwood in January,1944*and some by the 
author in May^l944* These cultures retained their viability 
when tested three to four weeks after drying. When tested 
again after eight months they would not grow when trans¬ 
ferred to nutrient broth. Legume nodule bacteria dried at 
the same time produced active cultures when transferred to 
a liquid medium. This was in agreement with results ob¬ 
tained at the National Research Council, Ottawa, where all 
dried cultures ^except Aerobacter aerogenes kept very well

4. Hrea^s^ £ he_ - 

There was some doubt as to how much urea was 
required for optimum fermentation. The N.R.R.L. (16) re¬ 
ported that 0.1 to 0.2% urea is sufficient in S3aithetic 
media. The Schenely Research Institute (18) suggested 
using 0.3% in dextrose medium and 0.2% in hydrolyzed mash 
medium. An experiment was conducted in which varying 
amounts of urea were added to the fermentation media. Tests 
were made on both dextrose medium and malt hydrolyzed 
wheat mash. The results appear in Tables 4 and 5* 

On dextrose medium the greater the addition of 
urea the faster and more efficient was the fermentation 
(see Table 4)• This may be due to two factors: 

1. There was a larger supply of available 

nitrogen. 

2. The greater the addition of urea the more 
nearly was the reaction of the medium maintained at a pH 
optimum for the growth of the organism. 

In this experiment the maximum urea level was 
not reached. A similar experiment conducted by Blackwood 
showed that 0.5% of urea reduces the fermentation time to 
a minimum. 

Table 5 shows that the optimum amount of urea in 
hydrolyzed wheat medium is 0.3%* Above this amount there 
was no increase in the rate of fermentation nor the glycol 
yield. Below 0.3% there was a definite drop in the rate of

fermentation and yield of glycol. The effect of 
adding varying amounts of urea is apparent early in the 
fermentation and shows up throughout the whole fermen- 
taion period. 

It was noticed that the higher the initial 
urea level the higher was the final pH of the culture, 
so an experiment was carried out to determine the ef¬ 
fect of omitting the calcium carbonate as a buffer agent 
when urea is added to the medium. The N.R.R.L. (16) ob¬ 
tained successful fermentations without the use of cal- 
cium carbonate as a buffer when urea was used as the 
nitrogen source, Blackwood found it necessary to use 
both calcium carbonate and sodium carbonate to maintain 
a proper pH when fermenting hydrolyzed wheat mash with 
urea as the nitrogen source. In this experiment a 15 % 
malt hydrolyzed wheat mash was fermented and two levels 
of urea were used. The results are shown in Table 6. 

When 0. 3% urea Is used there Is no apparent de¬ 
trimental effect from omitting the calcium carbonate buf¬ 
fer, Below this level, 0.2% urea, the glycol yield was 
reduced and sugar utilization was decreased when the cal¬ 
cium carbonate was omitted. There was no difference in 
the final pH when the calcium carbonate was added or 
omitted. This was true for both 0.2 and 0.3% of urea.

5• A Study of Weath e red Wheat, Barley. Potatoes and Beet 

Molasses as Sources of Raw Material for the Fer m entation . 
(a) Weathered Wheat , 

A study was made by the Plant Science de¬ 
partment, using Aerobacillus oolvmvxa . to deter¬ 
mine the relative value of weathered and unweathered 
wheat in the fermentation. Although they could at¬ 
tribute no diferences in glycol yield to degree of 
weathering it was noted that strain #500 gave better 
results with the fall threshed samples. It was 
thought advisable to test the effect of weathered 
wheat on the Aerobaeter aerogenes fermentation. 

Due to the late harvest and early winter 
of 1942 it was necessary to leave much of the wheat 
unthreshed in the field until spring. It was thus 
subjected to severe weathering, including frost 
damage, and in some instances to germination. Fall 
and spring threshed samples from the same field were 
chosen, representing different localities in the 
province and different degrees of weathering. The 
results are reported in Table 7. Although the yields 
were not consistent the fall threshed samples gave 
better results for the majority of samples tested. 

The over all average was only slightly higher for 
the unweathered samples and indicates the suitability

(b) Barley 

An experiment was carried out to deter¬ 
mine the comparative value of barley and wheat as 
a carbohydrate source in Aerobacter aerogenes fer¬ 
mentation. For this test two varieties of barley, 
Trebi and Newal grown at Edmonton, and one variety 
of wheat. Garnet, were mashed, malt hydrolyzed, and 
fermented. Garnet wheat was chose n because it was

found to give slightly better results than the other 
wheat varieties. Tests were made on 10$ and 15$ 
mashes of both barley and wheat. The results ap¬ 
pear in Table 8. 

The average yield was 2.58 grams glycol 
from 10 grams wheat mash, 2.41 grams glycol from 10 
grams barley mash. Thus the average yield of gly¬ 
col from barley was 6.6$ lov^rer than from wheat. 

This may be explained by the fact that barley con¬ 
tains 6 to 8$ less starch than wheat. However,

since barley generally yields more starch per acre 
than does wheat, it would appear that barley could 
be used more economically in the fermentation than 
wheat* 

Similar results were obtained using the 
organism Aerobacillus polvmvxa (22). There was no 
real difference in yield between the two varieties 
of barley. 

(c) Potatoes 

A brief study was made concerning the 
utilization of potatoes as a carbohydrate source 
for Aerobacter fermentation. Although the investi¬ 
gation was very incomplete the results would indi¬ 
cate that this starchy material is not wholly satis¬ 
factory for this fermentation. Complete sacchari¬ 
fication of the cooked potato mash was very diffi¬ 
cult to obtain. This is an important factor since 
the organism Aerobacter aerogenes will not ferment 
starch or dextrin . Several saccharifying agents 
including sulphuric acid, barley malt, and diastase 
were used. Complete conversion of the starch to 
sugar was not given by any one of these alone. 

The potatoes were sliced and cooked in 
the autoclave at 15 lbs. pressure for 30 minutes.

following which they were thoroughly mashed and the 
saccharifying agent added. Distilled water was 
added to make a 50 % mash by weight. Acid hydrolysis 
gave only partial conversion •— not exceeding 30% 
of theoretical. Malt hydrolysis (itself incomplete) 
followed by acid hydrolysis gave complete conver¬ 
sion of the starch to sugar, which was indicated 
both by the iodine test and sugar analysis. Hydro¬ 
lysis of the potato mash with diastase produced a 
mash which gave a negative starch test with iodine 
but positive for dextrins. Acid hydrolysis of this 
mash increased the reducing sugar content from 5*5 
to 7.3%« Glycol yields varying from 2.42 to 2.66 
grams per 50 grams of potatoes (approximately 11 
grams dry matter) were recovered by analysis after 
fertmentation. 

(d) Beet Molasses . 

Some fermentation tests were carried out 
using beet molasses as the sugar source. The beet 
molasses tested was secured from the Canadian Sugar 
Factories at Raymond, Alberta. The fermentation 
medium was prepared by diluting one part of molasses 
w r ith four parts of distilled water. Salts and urea 
were added at the time of inoculation. These fer-

mentations required an incubation period of about 
72 hours. An anti foam agent was required to pre¬ 
vent foaming during aeration. 

These tests indicate that beet molasses 
can be utilized quite efficiently in Aerobacter 
fermentations. Yields ranging from 19.4 to 20.4 
grams of glycol together with 5*3 to 5.6 grams 
of alcohol were recovered from 100 grams of molasses 
containing approximately 55 grams of sugar. Acid 
hydrolysis of the beet molasses medium prior to 
fermentation did not improve the glycol yields. 
Several fermentations were made on unsterilized 
beet molasses medium and yields comparable with 
those from sterilized medium were obtained. 

Beet molasses should prove to be a good 
source of raw material for glycol production by 
means of Aerobacter fermentation, and may provide 
the basis for a small glycol production plant in 
Alberta. The approximate total yearly supply of 
beet molasses in Alberta is about 10,000 tons. 

At present price levels (Table 9) it is a cheaper 
source of raw material than wheat or barley (at 
least to Canadian consumers). At the price 
charged for export to the United States it is 
more costly than barley.

Molasses also has several other factors 
in its favor. It can be fermented directly with¬ 
out first being hydrolyzed,which in the case of 
wheat and barley involves several steps, includ¬ 
ing grinding, cooking, saccharification, etc. 

Acid hydrolyzed mashes must be adjusted to a proper 
pH before they can be fermented. If malt hydro¬ 
lysis of starch is used resterilization is essen¬ 
tial since the organism Aerobacter aerogenes can 
not compete with the contamination introduced with 
the malt. These steps all add to the cost of fer¬ 
mentation when grain or other starchy materials 
are used. It is probable that beet molasses need 
not be sterilized prior to fermentation since 
several fermentations were made successfully with¬ 
out sterilization. These facts indicate that beet 
molasses is a good potential source of raw material 
for glycol production by means of Aerobacter fer¬ 


mentation

summary 


Aeration is necessary for a fast and efficient fer¬ 
mentation. 

The role of aeration is probably not only a physical 
one as there are indications that it has some chemical effect 
on the fermentation. 

The organism Aerobac ter aerogenes can tolerate an 
air mixture containing as high as 25% carbon dioxide without 
seriously inhibiting the fermentation. This indicated that the 
volume of sterile air required for aeration may be reduced by 
recycling the air through the fermentation medium. 

Foaming during aeration is caused by the proteins 
present in the hydrolyzed mash. It can be controlled either 
by enzyme hydrolysis of the proteins or by the addition of a 
suitable anti-foam agent (lubricating oil) without impairing 
glycol yields. 

The use of oleic acid to prevent foaming gives a 
slightly lower yield of glycol, but probably not significantly 
lower than when no anti-foam agent is used. Oleic acid is more 
costly than lubricating oil. 

Barley malt prepared in thelaboratory and dried at 
a low temperature to prevent destruction of the proteolytic en¬ 
zymes does not effect sufficient breakdown of the proteins to

effectively control foaming when used to saccharify wheat mashes. 

The organism Aerob a cter aerogenes does not survive 
for an appreciable time when stored in !, lyophile n form. 

In dextrose medium the rate of fermentation increased 
as the amount of urea added to the medium increased, up to the 
limit added. 

In malt hydrolyzed wheat mash 0.3% urea gave an op¬ 
timum rate of fermentation. 

Calcium carbonate increased the rate of fermentation 
when 0.2% urea was added to malt hydrolyzed wheat mashes but 
had no beneficial effect w T hen 0.3% urea was added. 

Weathered and poor quality wheat gave approximately 
as high yields of glycol as good quality wheat in Aerobacter 
fermentations. 

Barley may be used more economically than wheat in 
the fermentation because of its higher average yield of starch. 

Potatoes are not considered a good source of raw ma¬ 
terial for Aerobacter- fermentations since it is difficult to 
obtain complete saccharification of the potato starch. 

Beet molasses can probably be used advantageously in 
this fermentation. Results indicate that: 

1. Sterilization of molasses medium before fermentation 
is not necessary. 

2. It is readily fermented without pre-hydrolysis. 

3. Acid hydrolysis of the molasses does not increase yields. 

4* It is a relatively cheap source of raw material.
