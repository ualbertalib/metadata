ABSTRACT 


Statistical analyses of microfauna from 
the Lower Cretaceous, lower Lloydminster shales from 
the Eldorena #1 well of the Edmonton area, Alberta, 
indicates continuous deposition without important 
stratigraphic interruptions throughout, superjacent 
to, and subjacent to the Viking sand member* 

An itomobaculoides microfauna, older than 
any previously described from the Lloydminster shale, 
is reported from the base of the formation. 

Parts of the lower Lloydminster shale are 
correlated with the upper 200 feet of the Bucking- 
horse formation of north-eastern B.C.; the lower 80 
feet of the Shaftesbury formation of Peace River 
area, Alberta; the Joli Pou - Pelican sandstone 
basal Labiche shale of the Athabaska River area, 
Alberta; and with the lower Lloydminster shale of 
the Vermilion area, Alberta. 

Statistical data is presented in con¬ 
venient histogram charts*

CHAPTER I 


INTRODUCTION 


Introductory Statement 

This thesis is an analytical microfaunal 
inventory of the basal Lloydminster shale. The 
analysis was selected to embrace the Viking sand member 
of the Lloydminster shale. 

The results of this study indicated that no 
distinct or abrupt faunal change occurred during the 
deposition of the Viking sand, immediately preceding 
it or immediately following, within the Eldorena 
area and therefore the Viking sand represents sandy 
facies of the early Lloydminster flooding and in this 
area does not indicate a stratigraphic hiatus. 


Collection & 


The samples, from which the microfauna 


were obtained, were collected by Mr. C.R. Steick 
from drilled cores of Eldorena #1 Well, taken by 
Imperial Oil Ltd. in 1949. 












>2 


The samples were collected continuously and 
irregularly, along the cores, the footage being deter¬ 
mined by convenient length interval where no litholog¬ 
ical change was involved, and by selective picking of 
shale intervals where sandy breaks provided lithological 
markers. This method permits an unmixed evaluation of 
fauna from individual shale tongues. The samples range 
from 1934 feet to 2128 feet (drilling depth), i.e. 
from the top of the Mannville formation to about 50 
feet above the Viking sandstone. 

The samples were placed in postal cotton bags 
and forwarded to the University of Alberta. 

The writer divided the samples into two 
parts, breaking the fragments by hand to minimize the 
amount of crushing and consequent damage to any micro¬ 
fossils contained. One half of each sample is placed 
in a pint sealer for immediate use, and the remaining 
half retained in the sample bag and is filed in the 
Department of Geology of the University of Alberta. 

Each pint sealer is filled approximately three fourths 
full with ordinary tap water and sealed. 







* 3 ' 


When the samples have softened sufficiently 
they are shaken vigorously to allow as much of the 
shale as possible, to become suspended in the water* 

The contents of the sealer are emptied into a prepared 
set of Tyler screens. These screens consist of the 
following suite: 28 mesh, 48 mesh, 80 mesh, 100 mesh, 
150 mesh and a pan* A small stream of water from a 
rubber tube connected to the water tap reduces the 
residue on the 28 mesh screen* The residue is worked 
with the fingers and the remaining residue is collected 

i 

to one side of the screen by means of a fine jet of 
water from the underside of the 28 mesh screen, and 
washed into a white porcelain saucer. The excess 
water is then poured out of the saucer and the 
residue allowed to dry. 

This procedure is carried out with each 
screen size. A small stream of water is allowed to 
run into the pan and float off all shaly particles, 
leaving the microfossils and sand grains, etc* behind* 
This sample is also transferred to a porcelain saucer.

When the sample is dried, each mesh size is 
placed in a small screw-topped vial and appropriately 
labelled* 

Method of Mounting Microfossils 

The residues in the screw-topped vials con¬ 
tain the microfossils. The residue is scattered 
thinly over the surface of a "picking” plate - a 
small buff-colored plastic plate. The picking is 
done under a Bausch and Lomb binocular microscope at 
SOX magnification, using a blue light. The picking 
plate has a sectioned field, and the percentage of the 
sample picked is readily determined. 

The microfossils are picked up on the tip of 
a moistened paint brush (00). The fossils are placed, 
and roughly grouped as to genus, on a clean, white 
card. Where sufficient numbers of fossils have been 
collected and the percentage of the sample is 
determined, the residue is returned to the vial. The 
fossils are then transferred to a mounting slide. 

Some of these slides contain one large rectangular 
cell in which case the different mesh sizes of each 




r 


): •: J r i o ) 




5 - 


sample are marked off along the sides of the cell; other 
slides contain 10 small, circular cells arranged in two 
rows of 5 cells, along the length of the slide, in which 
case each mesh size is confined to one cell and each 
sample to a row of 5 cells (i.e* - two samples of 5 
cells each, per slide)* 

The cells of the mounting slides, have a 
black background which is covered with gum tragacanth, 
which, when touched by the moistened brush holding the 
fossil, becomes gummy and holds the fossil securely. 

The fossils are arranged in horizontal rows within the 
cells* 

The slides of the collection, are filed in 
the Department of Geology, University of Alberta. 

Scope of Thesis and Method of Treatment 

This dissertation is a statistical evaluation 
of the microfauna of the Basal Lloydminster shale as 
represented in cores from the Imperial Eldorena well 
(LSD 4, Section 27, Township 57, Range 20, West of 
4th Meridian). Specifically, it is an attempt by the 














'V. . . ■ 






■ 6 < 


writer to analyze the fauna above, below and within 
the Viking sand with respect to continuity of fauna 
across the sand* 

The method employed was to make statistical 
counts, both generic and specific, of the faunas* 

These counts were then studied by the use of check 
lists and histogram representation, to arrive at the 
conclusion stated* 

Note — The "species'* as set up by the writer were 
selected as morphologic types and followed through as 
such, each new morphologic type receiving the specific 
notation of successive letters of the alphabet*

CHAPTER II 


STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OP MICROFAUNA 


MICROFAUNAL OBSERVATIONS 


The following observations on the micro¬ 
fauna of the Lower Lloydminster formation, apply only 
to the shaiy lithofacies and take no cognizance of 
the faunas that might be present in sandy zones* 

The development of the microfauna is best 
shown by a consideration of each major genus# The 
discussion of the genera is based on the Generic 
Occurrence graphs (Figures I - IV), the Percentage 
Population graph (Figure V), the Specific Occurrence 
graphs (Figures VI - XII) and the writer 1 s specific 
evaluation of the fauna. 

Hapiophragmoides (see Figures I, V and VI) is strongly 
represented in the lowest shale above the Mannville 
and is continuously present throughout the section

covered by this thesis* The maximum development both 
generically and specifically occurs in the shale 
between the Eldorena sand member (1) and the base of 
the Viking sand. At this horizon the genus Hapl oph- 
ragmoides represents from 50 to 70 percent of the total 
population (see Figure V)* The minimum development 
occurs immediately above the shale zone within the 
Viking sand where only 2 percent of the total fossil 
population is made up of this genus. The decrease in 
the percentage representation of Haplophragmoides at 
this horizon, is taken up mainly by spores. 

In species, the same generalizations are 
true. (see Figure VI) There are 3 species strongly 
developed in the lowest shale above the Mannville 
formation and 6 more developed below the Sldorena sand 
member. Of all 9 species that are present below the 
Sldorena sand member, only 1 species does not continue 


(1) The writer proposes the name Sldorena sand member 
for the sandy horizon between the Joli Fou (basal 
Lloydminster) shale and the Basal Member of the 
Lloydminster shale, (see Figure XIII), at a depth 
of 2086 feet to 2105 feet in the Eldorena well.

above. There are 13 species present in the shales below 
the base of the Viking sand — only 2 of these are 
represented within the Viking sand and none of them 
recur above the Viking sand l Of the 3 new species 
that first develop within the Viking sand only 1 is 
represented above the Viking and this one only poorly 
so. (It should be noted at this point that the 
writer found it impossible to differentiate with 
certainty, any species contained in the finer screen 
sizes, viz: 100 and 150 mesh and pan sample). The well 
known index fossil Haplophragmoides gigas Cushman , 
occurs in the Basal Lloydminster shale just above the 
Eldorena sand member and is restricted to that zone. 

It may be concluded that with respect to the 
genus Haplophragmoides , the Viking sand does represent 
a definite break in specific continuity. 

Ammobaculites (see Figures I, V and VII) is represented 
in the first sample above the Mannville formation. The 
over all generic development is at no horizon very 
strong but is consistent throughout the section with 
the exception of one sample, just above the shale zone

within the Viking sand, where it is absent* There 
are two maxima of development: one just below the 
Eldorena sand member of the Basal Lloydminster shale 
and the other embracing the base of the Viking sand. 

Sandy phases do not seem to eliminate 
Ammobaculites from the section generically or specif¬ 
ically. There are 10 species developed below the 
Eldorena sand member and 4 of these continue 
(3 strongly) above the Eldorena sand member (see 
Figure VII). Of these 4 species, 3 continue for a 
short way into the base of the Viking and reappear 
above the Viking sand. One species, not continuous 
across the Eldorena sand member, reappears above the 
Viking sand. There are 4 species which have their 
initial development within the base of the Viking 
but only 1 of these is represented at all above the 
Viking. There are 4 species which first develop 
above the Viking but are only poorly represented 
within the section considered. 

Continuity of Ammobaculites species is 


interrupted by the sand and sandy phases of the section 
but some species return with the advent of shale.

Shallow water environment, muddy but marginal to the 
sandy phases is favored by the genus Ammobaculites . 

The evidence from the A mmobaculites faunas, shows no 
hiatus or break present in the section from below the 
Viking to above the Viking. 

Ammobaculoides (see Figures I and V) is a very short 
ranging genus, strongly represented in the shales up 
to the base of the Eldorena sand member and thereafter 
not present. As this genus disappears, the percentage 
of Haplophragmoides expands to make up the deficit. 

The disappearance of the Ammobaculoides 
implies some important ecological change at the time 
of the laying down of the Eldorena sand member. 

Proteonina (see Figures III, V and VIII) is represented 
throughout the section except immediately below the 
base of the Viking. Except for the shale below the 
Eldorena sand member, there is no great development 
of this genus. In the percentage population it makes 
up for decreases in the numbers of Haplophragmoides , 
Ammobaculites and A mmobaculoides . 


The species, generally, are short ranging.

There are 6 strongly developed species represented in 
the shale below the Eldorena sand member, only one of 
these survives this sand* However 3 of these species 
recur very briefly above the Viking* Five species 
develop within the basal part of the Viking and 4 of 
these recur above the Viking* The basal suite of 
species is quite distinctive from the rest of the 
section* 

The evidence from a study of the Froteonina 
shows no break in section over the Viking interval 
but some disruption over the Eldorena sand interval* 

Reophax (see Figures III, V and IX) is only represented 
in the Basal Lloydminster by a very few, poor specimens. 
The first strong development is within the Second 
Viking sand and all of these are again represented 
above the Viking sand. Three additional species 
develop above the Viking sand* 

The environment of the Basal Lloydminster 
shale was not favorable to Reophax suggesting fairly 
deep water at this time* The evidence of the

Reophax indicates no dissruption in continuous 
deposition from the Viking to the overlying shales* 

Gaudryina (see Figures III, V and X) is strongly devel¬ 
oped in the shales of the pre-Eldorena sand member, 
is fairly strongly represented within the Second Viking 
sand and again above the Viking sand* Generically it 
is continuously represented throughout the section* 

There are 12 species developed in the shale 
immediately above the Mannville formation. Gaudryina 
canadensis and G. cf canadensis are among the 8 of 
the above species which are confined to this basal 
horizon. Only 4 of the original and 2 new species 
appear briefly above the Viking sand. It should be 
noted here, as in the case of Haplophragmoides , 
that the writer did not attempt to differentiate 
specifically those forms found in the finer screen 
sizes* 

Gaudryina are continuous across the Viking 
sand but evidently the continuity of major species 
was very badly disrupted by the more sandy environ-

ments. The long range of the Gaudryina species 
seems to indicate that a fairly short time interval 
was involved in the deposition of the basal 
Lloydminster section in this area. 

Verneuilina (see Figures III, V and XI), as is to be 
expected, has a development similar to that of 
Gaudryina, but is more erratic. The genus Verneuilina 
is absent at 6 irregularly spaced horizons throughout 
the section. 

There are 2 species present below the 
Elaorena sand member of the Basal Lloydminster shale, 
that do not reappear until some 15 feet above the 
Viking where they occur quite strongly. T?<ro species, 
one of which is Verneuilina canadensis , develop above 
the Viking sand. 

Generally speaking, the sandy environments 
have the same affect on the species of Verneuilina 
as on the species of Ga udryin a. The evidence from 
this corroborates the evidence supporting a short time 
interval of deposition suggested by the genus 
Gaudryina . 














- 16 - 


Miliammina (see Figures I, V and XII) is not present 
below the Eldorena sand member but first develops in 
the shale just below the base of the Viking sand. It 
is quite strongly represented within the Second 
Viking sand and the shale zone above but is nearly 
absent throughout the Viking sand proper. It is 
again strongly represented above the Viking. 

The 3 species that develop immediately below 
the base of the Viking, continue strongly through the 
Second Viking and return again in the shales above 
the Viking. The 3 additional species that initially 
develop within the Second Viking and the shale zone 
above it are represented above the Viking. There are 
2 species which are very poor in numbers, that are 
initiated above the Viking. 

The genus Milia mmina is a shallow water 
form and the generic and specific evidence of the 
genus in this suite corroborate the previous 
evidence that the shale above the Viking represents 
a relatively shallow water environment. There is no 
disruption of the specific continuity across the 
Viking interval. 








V 






:.)(r 



- 17 - 


Kyperammina (see Figures I, V and XII) has a distri¬ 
bution very similar to that of Miliammina . It is 
present, generically, throughout the entire section. 

One species develops immediately below the 
Second Viking and continues through the shale zone 
above the Second Viking. It reappears above the 
Viking where there are 7 new species strongly 
developed, 2 of which had their initial development 
within the Second Viking and the others in the post- 
Viking shale. 

The evidence of Hyperammin a further 
corroborates that afforded by Miliamm ina and others. 
The Viking sand facies was ecologically unfavorable 
to this genus. There is apparently no disruption of 
specific continuity through the sand, reaffirming 
the absence of any important stratigraphic hiatus 
within the Viking sand section.

Sumtnary 

Evidence from the above analyses of the micro¬ 
fauna indicates that there is no major stratigraphic 
hiatus involved in the Viking sand interval, also that 
there is no pronounced stratigraphic break immediately 
above or immediately below the Viking sand. Further, 
it shows that the time interval involved in the deposi¬ 
tion of the Viking sand was not long. The shales below 
the Eldorena sand represent the initial phase of a 
transgressive sea which had local embayments of 
shallow water with deposition during Eldorena sand 
time. There is nearly continuous deposition through 
the deep water Haplophragmoides gig as zone. 

All genera except the genus Haplophragmoides 
that are present in the initial shales of the section 
are represented in the post Viking Shales. Specifically 
there are faunal ties between pr e-Eldorena shales and 
post-Eldorena shales and between H. gigas zone shales 
and post-Viking shales indicating that the different 
faunas represent biofacies changes in the Easal 
Lloydminster sea and that there is no break in deposi¬ 
tion although there are different environments of 
deposition and varied sediments laid down.

Explanation of Generic Occurrence Graphs 

A statistical count is made for genera and 
graphs compiled (see Figures I - IV)# These graphs 
show the relative development of each genus against 
the lithology and stratigraphic sequence of the 
enclosing sediments. 

The horizontal component of each graph is a 
logarithmic progression (i.e. - it is divided into 4 
logarithmic divisions, viz: 0-10; 10 - 100; 100 - 
1000; 1000 - 10,000), the units representing the 
number of fossils present. The vertical component 
corresponds to the drilling depth from which the 
samples were collected. 

The writer has chosen to distinguish 
between count-values under 10 and those over 10 by 
shading that portion of the graph over 10. This was 
done to emphasize horizons favorable to the develop¬ 
ment or preservation of each genus.

Explanation of Percentage Population Graphs 

The statistical generic count is used to 
compute the Percentage Population Table (see Table I)* 

This is done by analyzing each sample with respect to 
the percent of the total population that each individ¬ 
ual genus represents* Both Foraminifera and non- 
Foraminiferal elements are used to give a more complete 
picture of the Thantvtocoenosis of each horizon* The 
following entities are used: Haplophragmo ides, 
A mmobaculites , Ammobaculoides , Reophax , Hyperammina, 
Proteonina, L eptod ermella, Spo res , Gaudryina, Ve rne u ilina , 
Tr ochammin a, Miliammina and others* The term f *Others” 
includes the following: Collophane S pher es, B athysiphon , 
Glomospi ra, Fucoidal Elements, Trit axia, Nodosinella, 
Spir oplectammina , Eo guttul ina, Globigerina and 
Ammodiscus. 

The figures are transferred from the table 
to a graph* The vertical axis of the graph represents 
the section of the Basal Lloydminster shale dealt with 
in this thesis and the units represent the drilling

depth at which each sample was collected. The 
horizontal axis represents the percentage and the 

units are 10$ (viz: 10$, 20$ . 100$). The 

percentage of the total population that each genus 
represents is plotted on the graph. The points are 
joined by curved lines.

Explanation of Specific Occurrence Graphs 

A statistical count is made for each sample, 
of species populations of each major genus. Graphs 
are compiled for each genus (see Figures VI - XII), 
These graphs show the relative development of each 
species against the lithology and stratigraphic 
sequence of the enclosing sediments. 

The horizontal axis represents the relative 
numbers of each species present. It is divided into 
4 units: a single line representing from 0 to 5 fossils 
present; a unit bar representing from 6 to 20 fossils 
present; a 2 unit bar representing from 21 to 100 
fossils present; a 3 unit cusp representing from 101 
to 1,000 fossils present. The vertical axis corres¬ 
ponds to the drilling depth from which the samples 
were collected. 

In cases where successive samples contain 
the same species, the continuity is shown by dotted 
lines. In such cases above the Viking sand where 
sampling was continuous, the graphic expression is

not broken but is also shown continuously. In 
samples which are only separated by moderate distances 
and which contain the same species, the continuity of 
the species is assumed and indicated by the use of 
dotted lines. 

The following genera are included in the 
Specific Occurrence Graphs: Haplo phragmoid es, 
Ammobaculites , R eophax , Pro teonina , Milia mmin a, 
Gaudryina, Verneuilina, Hyperammi na and Gl omospira .

CHAPTER III 

Palaeo-ecological Significance of the Microfauna of the 

Basal Lloydminster Formation 

The environments of deposition within the 
section can best be determined from a study of the 
ecology of the suites of fossils found at various 
horizons. These interpretations are based on an 
analysis of the specific fauna and the lithology of the 
stratigraphic horizon containing that fauna. 

The presence of old soils and residual zones 
at the top of the Mannville formation, indicates the 
existence of a land area at the end of Mannville time. 
Within the time of deposition of the section being con¬ 
sidered, this land mass was flooded by a sea that laid 
down the Basal Lloydminster shale. The earliest 
flooding is represented by shale which contains well- 
developed species of Gaudryina and Haplophragmoide s. 
a few species of Aramobaulites and Glomospira, and a 
great number of Ammobaculoides . This assemblage 
indicates probable shallow water conditions, which 
is to be expected in the early stages of the advance¬ 
ment of the sea.

The fauna rapidly alters within a short 
vertical range, with the addition of several new, 
strongly developed species of Gaudryina , a few new 
species of Haplophragmoides and Ammobacu111es, the 
complete disappearance of Ammobaculoide s and the 
strong development of Proteonina. These changes are 
facies change due to a moderate deepening of the sea 
as it continued to flood over the land, although the 
appearance of Proteonina suggests brackish intervals* 

Immediately below the Eldorena sand member 
the fauna changes considerably* All the species of 
Gaudryina dwindle to insignificance and subsequently 
disappear; all the species of Proteonin a abruptly 
disappear; all species of Haplophra gmoid es show a 
marked decrease in numbers; and Ammobaculoides 
return very strongly* The subsequent deposition of 
the Eldorena sand indicates that at least locally the 
sea shallowed and is near shore at this horizon. 

The Eldorena sand is glauconitic and there¬ 
fore represents shallow marine deposition. The 
presence of a few poorly preserved S pore s in the sam¬

stiggest near-shore phase of a deltaic environment. 

The restricted vertical range of the 
genus Ammobaculoides to pre-Eldorena shales, 
indicates an early, local, shallow embayment into 
the late Mannville land area. It is known that the 
Eldorena sand facies is restricted in areal dis¬ 
tribution. 

Ylhen the source of the sand was cut off, 
probably by a deepening of the sea over the land area 
to the south, Joli Pou shales were laid down. These 
initial shales above the Eldorena sand member con¬ 
tain a different fauna to those shales immediately 
below the Eldorena sand member. The species of 
Haplophragmoides that were present below the sand 
are still present with the exception of 1 species, 
and 2 new species, including Haplo ph ragmoides gigas 
appear. No species of Gaudryina or Ammobac u loi des 
are present; only 1 species of Ammobaculites is 
present in these initial shales; and only 1 species 
of Proteonina is present. This indicates that the 
sea of post-Eldorena member time was fairly deep in 
this locality and too deep for the genus Ammobacu- 
loides • 












-28- 


The index fossil Haplophragmoides gigas 
Cushman, has been reported from widespread localities 
throughout Alberta and Saskatchewan* It has been found 
in the Joli Fou shales of the Athabaska River (1), in 
Cretaceous sections of Southern Saskatchewan and Manitoba 

(2) , in the Lloydminster shale at Lloydrainster, Alberta 

(3) , in Cretaceous shales of the section recovered from 
the Imperial Paddle River well (4) and in the Cretaceous 
shales of Southern Alberta near Taber (5). This indica¬ 
tes that the shore line of the H. gigas sea was at least 
200 miles removed from the Sldorena location*

The fauna of the shales imediately helow the 
base of the Viking sand indicates a shallowing of the 
sea and in view of the subsequent deposition of the 
Viking sand, this is not unreasonable. This pre- 
Viking fauna contains 5 of the shallow water species 
of H aplo phragmoides that appeared in the shales 
immediately above the Eldorena sand but not as strongly 
represented. The deeper water species Haplophragmoides 
gigas is gone. Pour of the shallow water species of 
Ammobaculites that were present below the Eldorena sand 
member, reappear. Two new species of Proteonina are 
strongly developed here that, along with the genus 
Miliammina, first developed at this horizon with 3 very 
strong species, indicates brackish tendencies. The 
genus Hyperammin a, initially develops here. This 
fauna represents a shallow, brackish water fauna and 
it is obvious that the deep sea aspect of the 
Haploph ragmoides gigas Cushman is gone. 

The shaly portions of the Second Viking 
sand contain the remnants of the pre-Viking fauna and 
a new fauna as well. One species of Haplophragmoide s

is present that had pre-Viking affiliations and only 
one new species developed. Of the previous species of 
Ammobaculites there are three represented in the Second 
Viking sand and three new species developed. All pre- 
Viking sand species of Miliammina are present along 
with one new species. The one species of Hyperammi na 
is still present. One new species of Verneuili na 
develops in the Second Viking sand (the 2 earlier 
species were restricted to the shales immediately 
below the Eldorena sand member). The two species of 
Proteon ina that developed immediately below the base 
of the Viking, continue within the Second Viking and 
in addition, two new species are developed. There are 
four species of ft eophax developed in this horizon only 
one of which is a continuation of an initial develop¬ 
ment in the shales immediately below the base of the 
Viking. n Spores” make their initial major appearance 
in this horizon. The evidence presented by an analysis 
of this fauna serves to indicate that the Second 
Viking sand represents a shallow near-shore facies of 


the earlier sea

Th© shale zone immediately above the Second 

Viking sand carries a fauna which is very similar to 

< 

the fauna of the Second Viking sand. The differences 
lie in the development of a few new species of Heophax, 
Proteonina, Miliammina, Hypera mmina and Hapl ophrag - 
moide s replacing some of the species of the Viking 
sand* Little environmental change is indicated 
except the change from sand to shale bottom* The 
environment remained near-shore shown by the abundance 
of "Spores’* present in this shale. 

"Spores” dominate the organic life represented 
in the upper Viking sand. There are a few species of 
i^nmobaculites represented near the top of the Viking 
sand, which had earlier affiliations within the section 
at the base of the Eldorena sand. Haplophragmoides is 
represented at the top of the Viking by two species, 
one of which was initiated in the shale zone above the 
Second Viking. Miliammina is represented by two species 
at the top of the Viking, which initiated within the 
Second Viking. There are five species of Hyper ammina 
present at the top of the Viking, three of which were 
present earlier. Verneuilina is represented by the

Summary : 

The ecology of the faunas of the different 
horizons shows that the section essentially represents 
local fluctuations of a shallow, and at times, slightly 
brackish, transgressive sea in pre-Viking time and a 
static, shallow-water sea in post-Viking time* The 
continuity of the faunas through the Eldorena sand 
interval indicates that the latter represents local 
deposition in a local embayment* The widespread 
occurrence of the H* gigas fauna indicates that the 
deposition in this area during this time was deep 
water facies and over 200 miles from the shore in 
all directions* 

The interval of the Viking sand probably 
represents a shallowing of the sea in the western part 
due to minor uplifts of the old source areas of the 
Elairmore-Kootenay series to the west. This uplift 
area also contributed detritus to the sands of the 
Viking. The presence of chert pebbles and chert 
grains in the Viking sand and the fact that there is no 
Viking sand developed in the Lloydminster area or in

CORRELATIONS 


Microfaunal Correlations 


The fauna of the Basal Lloydminster forma¬ 
tion has been dated by C.R* Stelck (1) and J.H. Wall, 
Upper Albian age* 

The writer finds that certain faunal assem¬ 
blages contained within this section have been noted 
from other localities. Where possible, comparisons 
are made with these fossils and correlations indicated. 
That refinement of correlation may not be lost, the 
writer treats the correlations on the following 
stratigraphic breakdown.

This basal suite was not found by Nauss in 
the Lloydminster area. It is only partially represen¬ 
ted in Bahan*s collection from the Athabaska River. 

The suite is well represented in Stelck*s collection 
from, north eastern B.C. This indicates that the 
initial Basal Lloydminster sea was only present in the 
western portion of the basin and the stratigraphic 
position of this fauna seems to indicate uppermost 
Middle Albian or earliest Upper Albian age.

M Spores n the same forms were found in Bahan»s 

collection 100 feet above the top of the

In addition to those diagnostic species listed above 
numerous other minor forms not treated statistically 
by the writer* are found to be present in both the 
section below the Viking in the Eldorena well and below 
the Pelican sandstone in outcrop* 

The presence of these nearly identical faunas 
in both sections allows a direct correlation of the 
two sections with the exception of the fauna of the 
initial shales of the Eldorena well section which is 
only partly represented in the initial Joli Pou shales. 

The post-Viking shales within the section.

Stratigraphic Conclusions 

The faunas of the Eldorena section and those 
collected by Bahan from the Athabaska River are almost 
identical in all respects* This permits direct cor¬ 
relation between the Basal Lloydminster shales below 
the Viking sand and the Joli Pou shale; between the 
Viking sand and the Pelican sand; and between the 
Lloydminster shale immediately above the Viking sand 
and the lower Labiche shale immediately above the 
Pelican sand* The basal fauna below the Eldorena 
member was incompletely present in the Joli Pou shale 
on the Athabaska River suggesting that the earliest

3asal Lloydminster sea was only beginning to spread 
over the Athabaska River area at that time* Only a 
portion of this basal fauna of the Eldorena well- 
section is developed in the former area as the 
proper shaly environmental conditions were repre¬ 
sented on the Lower Athabaska River by either sand 
facies of the uppermost Grand Rapids formation or 
actual sub-aerial conditions. 

The Lloydminster shale at Lloydminster, 
Alberta and the Basal Lloydminster shales of the 
Eldorena well section are correlative except for 
the basal member and this correlation is substan¬ 
tiated by the microfauna developed therein* The 
faunas developed through the Viking interval in the 
Eldorena well-section are found to be laterally con¬ 
tinuous into the Lloydminster area. The additional 
thickness of shale found in the Lloydminster area 
between the post-Viking - pre-Viking fauna indicates 
that the Lloydminster shale in the Lloydminster area 
has a shale facies representing the Viking sand 
interval of the Eldorena area without loss of 


stratigraphic section

The pre-Eldorena member faima is directly 
correlative with a fauna collected by Steick from 
the upper Euckinghorse formation but the post- 
Eldorena member H, gigas fauna is missing from the 
upper Buckinghorse formation at that horizon. The 
post-Viking fauna of the Eldorena well-section how¬ 
ever, is present in the upper Euckinghorse formation 
immediately superjacent to the pre-Eldorena faunal 
correlatives. This strongly suggests that there is 
a stratigraphic hiatus present in the upper part of 
the Buckinghorse formation in the Sikanni Chief 
River area of B.C. 

The essential correlations developed or 
supported by this study are shown in the following 
table. 

The faunal similarities outlined above 
indicate that the upper 200 feet of the Buckinghorse 
formation of north eastern B.C., the lower 
Shaftesbury formation (from 211 feet below the Pish- 
Scale sand to 290 feet below the Fish-Scale sand)

of the Peace River town area, and the lower Labiche 
shale immediately above the Pelican sand of the 
Athabaska River area, are correlative stratigra- 
phically and ecologically similar to the 
Lloydminster shale immediately above the Viking 
sand in the Eldorena well-section*
