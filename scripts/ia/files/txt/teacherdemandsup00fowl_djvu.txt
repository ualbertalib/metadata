ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 


I wish to acknowledge the help tendered the Sub-Committee 
of the C. E. A. by Dr. L&Zerte and his office staff. 

Without their unstinted help the Committee would not 
have been able to function. 

Dean LaZert© was an everpresent help during the preparation 
of the questionnaires and through the travail of checking 
and recording the results. Dr. Smith’s help in the 
orientation of my material was most helpful. In parti¬ 
cular I wish to acknowledge the generous assistance given 
me by Mr. Dunlop. I am most grateful for his unfailing 
kindness in directing my wandering steps.

PREFACE 


The Canadian Education Association at its meeting in Quebec 
in September, 1947, appointed a committee of five members 
to study and report to the 1948 conference on problems re¬ 
lated to CANADA*S TEACHING PERSONNEL* The Directors of the 
Association appointed the following as the Survey Committee. 

H. P. Moffat, Ass f t. Supt* of Education, Halifax* 

Msgr* A. M. Parent, Secretary General, Laval University, 

Quebec• 

F. S. Rutherford, Deputy Minister of Education, Toronto* 

G. S. Corskery, General Secretary (Elect), C.T*F., Ottawa. 

M. E. LaZerte, Dean, Faculty of Education, Edmonton, 

(Chairman) 


In October, 1947, five graduate students in the Faculty of 
Education, University of Alberta, undertook to act as the 
working Sub-Committee of the C. E. A. This group under the 
guidance of Dean LaZerte prepared and summarized the 


questionnaires. From this material the following theses are 
in preparation: 

Baker, T. D. THE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC STATUS OF 

TEACHERS. 

Dixon, J. L. THE PRFESSIONAL GROWTH OF CANADIAN 

TEACHERS. 


Fowler, W. T. Mel. TEACHER DEMAND AND SUPPLY IN CANADA. 

Pettifor, R. E. THE SELECTION AND TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 

Souch, E. L. A SURVEY OF OPINIONS REGARDING CERTAIN 

SUGGESTED MODIFICATIONS OF EDUCATION 
IN CANADA. 


Dean LaZerte is drawing on the questionnaires and theses for 
his report "CANADA f S TEACHING PERSONNEL," which will be 
presented to the C. E. A. Conference at Winnipeg in September, 


1948

is plain the Committee has no idea as to the selection nor 
how representative that selection was. The Committee had 
its own mailing list obtained through the Departments of 
Education, Boards of Trad©, Chambers of Commerce, Service 
Clubs, University D. V. A. f s, ©t cetera. 

We have no way of knowing what the distribution was within 
each province. Was a cross section of the teaching personnel 
questioned? Were all the questions directed to experienced 
teachers? Did they go only to rural teachers? The 
assumption seems reasonable, however, that Department of 
Education officials would make every effort to insure a 
sampling of informed and representative opinion.

INTRODUCTION 


The Problem and Experimental Design 

The purpose of the investigation Is to conduct a pilot study 
of some of the factors affecting the demand for and the 
supply of teachers in Canada* No pretence is made at an 
all inclusive picture as the questionnaire used was sent 
only to cities of 10,000 population and over* 

Prom various factors studied I will try to predict the 

demand to 1954 as well as to consider the supply* , Canada 

has been singularly lacking such investigations* Brown’s 

report considered British Columbia* 1 The only light thrown 

on the Canadian situation has been that produced by the 

o 

Dominion Bureau of Statistics* 

Questionnaire M is built upon the ideas as listed on pages 
35 * 38* The original intent was to send out a questionnaire 
to all urban centers of population of 1,000 and over* For 
various reasons those areas of less than 10,000 population 
were omitted* This cut the number from 476 to 153* They 
received Series M (see appendix) but only 56 filled in the 
lengthy questionnaire and returned it* The Departments of 
Education supplied the Committee with the names of the 
school board chairmen and city superintendents for these 
153 cities*

No Series M questionnaire was completed fully by any city* 

No one question on Series M was completed by all the cities# 
Some questions were answered very well and other quite poorly# 
There was strong evidence of extremely poor records in many 
cities• 

The six members of the Sub-Committee worked as a unit in 
making up the questionnaires. All ideas were pooled and 
each question was on a sheet by itself# These were drawn 
from file as needed for the questionnaires to various groups. 
Some questions were used two or three times because we wanted 
to get the opinions from various sources on the same point# 

As the returns came in we worked as a group in tabulating 
and analyzing the results# We were at perfect liberty to 
go to the files and extract questions from the different 
questionnaires if we felt they would be useful to our 
particular thesis# 

This thesis was developed throughout by dual research. The 
bibliography indicates extensive reading covering the demand 
for and the supply of teachers as discussed in research 
bulletins* educational magazines, and popular magazines. 

The other side is original research from our questionnaires 
which are given in the appendix of this thesis only. The 
other theses make cross reference to it# 

Since the development has been dual, I propose to set up the 
findings and recommendations in two parts: Library Research, 
and Original Research#

PART 1 


TRENDS TOWARDS A MORE ADEQUATE 

EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM 



Educational Opportunity For Every Child 


Education experienced by the child is a process of growth. 

It is a creative unfolding process which should lead ulti¬ 
mately to responsible adulthood. Each child embodies a 
natural pattern of growth. His development follows a def¬ 
inite sequence, although his rate of progress may vary 
widely from that of other children. Each stage merges 
imperceptibly into the next. New experiences bring con¬ 
tinual reorganization of physical, mental, and emotional 
patterns. 

To the educator the process of education involves guiding 
the experiences of the child toward desired ends. For our 
children the ends sought are part of the framework of 
democracy - a society dedicated to equality among men with 
respect to their liberties, obligations, and opportunities. 
The Institution that provides a large share of these ex¬ 
periences, as well as the guidance necessary to their proper 
direction, is the school. Each year the schools serve 
nearly, 2,300,000 children of elementary- and secondary- 
school age. 

A democracy needs for its people definite patterns of con¬ 
duct and knowledge that are gained through education. 

Schools have been established to fulfill these needs. 
Attendance of children at school has been made compulsory 
by legislation. Yet many children are not attending any 
school. Many others have only the most meager school 
opportunities. This situation can and must be remedied 



by direct action of the Canadian people 


!• Larger Units of Local School Administration 
Local control of public education is a distinctive 
characteristic of the Canadian school system. Historically 
each sehoolhouse served a small isolated district. Today 
rapid communication and transportation have- obliterated 
distance and natural barriers to such a degree that the 
district school can and should be replaced. New community 
values tend to replace those centering in the one-room 
rural school. Many thousands of small districts remain, 
each draining its financial resources to provide even a 
meager opportunity for its children. 

There is no longer any justification for the district 
organization that still exists in the Dominion today. In 
Alberta and British Columbia it is mandatory that larger 
units be set up. In three or four other provinces aid is 
given in setting up the larger districts. The remaining 
ones are still in the horse-and-buggy age. The units here 
are so small that they cannot possibly support an adequate 
school program. Even with an exhorbitant tax rate the 
school funds of most of these little units are not suffi¬ 
cient to pay a teacher*s salary, to say nothing of the cost 
of buildings and equipment, books, supplies, and trans¬ 
portation. 

Larger units of attendance and administration, obtainable 
through consolidation or centralization, make possible

more effective use of school funds. In many important 
respects the enlargement of administrative areas tends to 
increase rather than diminish local responsibility and 
democratic control. The combined efforts of taxpayers, 
school authorities, and all other citizens are needed to 
promote further reorganization. By the spreading of the 
school costs over a wider taxation area the burden of 
taxes is more evenly distributed. By the pooling of these 
resources better teachers, supervisors, and administrators, 
as well as better buildings, equipment, and services can 
be provided. Transportation of pupils usually involves a 
new cost. But the needed school services and breadth of 
opportunity afforded through reorganization furnish ad¬ 
equate justification for the cost that is over and above 
the expense of maintaining separate schools. 

The Provinces must add their efforts to those of the com¬ 
munities if the children of the state are to receive 
better educational services. Such plans should assure 
administrative and attendance units large enough to 
furnish needed services economically, while guarding against 
the possibility of too great transportation distances for 
the young children. They should provide for the Inclusion 
of a high school in each unit, so that each child can go 
from pre-primary or first grade through the twelfth, thir¬ 
teenth or even fourteenth grade within reasonable distance 
of his home. The Provinces should grant such funds as- are 
necessary to the communities for new buildings, furnishings.

transportation, etc., thus encouraging elimination of un¬ 
satisfactory units of attendance and administration* 

2 • Reduction of Educational Inequalities within the Provinces 

Great variation exists in the type of educational opportunity 
available to the children within the several provinces, even 
within a single province. As the larger administrative units 
ironed out the disparity of the small districts giving the 
pupils in that area equal educational advantages so must the 
province by a system of grants give to the children under its 
control the right to a complete education under well trained 
and competent teachers in proper modern buildings. The 
cities have not only greater wealth than the rural areas 
but have proportionately fewer children. Rural places have 
relatively fewer productive workers to create taxable wealth 
for education and other purposes* 

Variation within provinces is evidenced by differences in 
ratios of children to be educated to adults and differences 
in taxable wealth back of each child. Rural farm populations 
in some provinces have proportionately twice as many children 
as the larger cities nearby* Taxable wealth per child, on 
the other hand, is thirty or more times as great in some areas 
as in others. Also there are areas with a greater ratio of 
children to adults and a much lower plane of living; so also 
are there areas with lower ratio of children to adults with 
a much higher plane of living. The children in these two 
extremes are still Canadians! Their educational opportunities 
should be equal.

These inequalities within the province itself can partly 
be smoothed out by using the province as major basis of 
tax support for schools. The funds available today are 
neither sufficient to provide a reasonably adequate 
educational program in all the poorer districts, nor so 
distributed as to eliminate inequalities among local dis¬ 
tricts • 

The provinces can reduce educational inequalities within 
their own borders more effectively than they do at'present. 
It will first be necessary to increase by substantial 
amounts the provincial contribution to local school support, 
thus recognizing the principle that the wealth of the state 
should educate the children of the state. By.this step the 
burden of taxation is removed from the inequitable general- 
property tax and distributed among the other tax resources 
that the province can command. A further necessity is to 
distribute funds in such a way as to reduce inequalities in 
educational opportunities among the children. Measures of 
educational need and of taxpayers’ ability to pay which are 
prerequisite to such a program have been worked out; It 
remains for the province to utilize current knowledge to 
insure to the farm child, as well as the city child, his 
chance for a good education. 

3. Reduction of Inequalities Among the Provinces with 
Federal Aid. 

The matter of making public education available to every 
child has become a national problem. Even with larger

administrative units and programs to reduce educational 
inequalities within the province, the disparities in 
educational offerings are still very great. Regional 
differences In economic capacity, resulting largely from 
the concentration of resources and industry in a few areas, 
makes it literally Impossible for a large proportion of the 
Nation’s children to obtain a reasonably good education 
under the existing methods of school support. This fact, 
coupled with increasing mobility of youth, inevitably 
creates a situation which democracy cannot tolerate for long* 

Our population is replenished chiefly from areas that offer 
the least educational opportunity. The cation’s farmers 
are supporting a large per cent of the children on a small 
per cent of the national income* In spite of the fact that 
the poorer provinces exert financial effort schools that 
is fare more of a strain than the effort exerted by 
wealthier ones, their economic shortcomings are reflected 
in meager facilities, limited school terms, less adequate 
instructional service, and a smaller proportion of children 
in school. This country Is spending more educational effort 
on groups having fewer children and less on groups that are 
replenishing its population. 

There is one and only one way out; the principle of federal 
aid to provinces for Services affecting children. This 
situation and its implications have been brought before the 
people more than once. The educational opportunity of 
children in economically less fortunate areas can be brought

up to the desired level of opportunity only by Federal 
financial assistance to the provinces, so rendered as to 
reduce educational inequalities. Greatest improvements 
will be effected if funds are expended to broaden the tra¬ 
ditional school offering both in type and in extent, to 
support a research and planning program, to improve the pre¬ 
paration of teachers, to provide more adequate buildings 
and equipment, to furnish suitable opportunities for 
handicapped children, and to strengthen the leadership of 
departments of education. The sums needed to achieve these 
ends are small compared to expenditures of our people for 
purposes far less vital to their well being. 

According to the British North America Act, education is a 
function of the Provincial Governments and, therefore, the 
schools, teacher training, and other matters involved in the 
formal educational field are planned, financed, and controlled 
by the provinces. If the Provinces ask the Federal Govern¬ 
ment for grants for education their reply is in terms of the 
3. N. A. Act - "Provincial autonomy characterizes Canadian 
education, with the exception of that for the Indian popu¬ 
lation." Yet, if the Dominion Government deems it expedient, 
they can with great alacrity pass an Order in Council and 
give out monies for education which encroach on and/or 
supplements educational areas of the Province.

'i ADDITIONAL SCHOOL SERVICES REQUIRED 

New social conditions have brought new demands upon the 
schools. Not only must the schools serve every child but 
such service must be extended over a longer period than ever 
before. The child’s well-being likewise requires that the 
school’s services be co-ordinated with those rendered by 
other community agencies. 

1. Opportunity for Children of Preschool Age. 

Learning experienced by the child before entering school Is 
of fundadmental significance in the shaping of his adult 
life. Children profit from a richness and variety of 
experiences that few homes are able to provide. School and 
home must work together to provide appropriate experiences 
for children. Teacher and parent Influences on the pre¬ 
school child can be closely related through the medium of 
nursery schools and kindergartens, which provide a suitable 
transition from home life to the more formal atmosphere of 
the elementary school.

In the best nursery schools and kindergartens the child's 
health and nutritional needs are carefully fulfilled; good 
language habits are more easily established; self-management 
is encouraged; problems of adjustment are dealt with 
through guidance and corrective procedures. The child's 
range of experience is broadened and he becomes accustomed 
to playing and working among contemporaries. His growing 
individuality is recognized and controlled through regu¬ 
lation of his activities rather than by repression; this 
tends to give him a sense of security and self-reliance. 

The whole experience is adjusted to the developmental needs 
of each child. 

Because these advantages permit the child to make an earlier 
adjustment to school life, the kindergarten or equivalent 
experience is becoming an established part of the public- 
school system. Progress can be quickened by more widespread 
understanding on the part of parents, teachers, and school 
administrators regarding what preschool opportunity can mean 
to the child. Experimentation has progressed far enough to 
indicate that children might well be permitted to enter the 
public school at four or five years of age, provided appro¬ 
priate experiences at the preschool level can be offered. 
Wider provision of this opportunity is contingent upon 
better school support, particularly in rural areas. 

2. Continuing Service for Youth .

high school; less than a fifth of those go on to c allege * 

Youth has but two choices: to continue schooling or to find 
work. After leaving school they are compelled to adjust 
themselves to a world which neither utilizes the services 
they can render nor provides them with adequate educational 
assistance in making necessary adjustments. 

To an increasing degree this situation has become a challenge 
to the public schools. Energies of school officials have 
been directed toward meeting the needs of a secondary-school 
population that has grown tenfold or more since 1900. Until 
the present decade there was relatively little urgent need 
for assisting youth after they left school. In consequence 
there are few well-defined procedures to follow and relatively 
few persons who are adequately prepared to deal with occu¬ 
pational and educational needs of these youth. Financial 
resources have been so greatly needed for carrying on the 
established school program that little has been available 
for services to young “people after they leave school. 

In provision for the further education of youth the extension 
of public school .opportunities up to eighteen or twenty years 
of age is an urgent need. This will involve the continuation 
of college-preparatory courses for those who are to carry on 
their formal education. It will require provision of broad 
general education coupled with personal and vocational 
guidance for the majority of youths who terminate their formal 
education upon completing the secondary school. It will 
also require the provision of prevocational and vocational 




12 


experiences adapted both to the capabilities of the youth 
being served and to the employment possibilities in the 
surrounding area. This will be discussed more fully in a 
later section. 

It becomes increasingly necessary to make available to youths 
who have left school continuous guidance in- matters of 
further education, vocation, and health. This service should 
continue until such time, as satisfactory occupational adjust¬ 
ment is made. Skilled guidance, based on adequate cumulative 
records, should culminate with placement in an occupation. 

This is a relatively new and uncharted field of service. 

Yet the challenge of today f s need cannot long be ignored. 

The schools should co-operate with the public employment 
agencies where junior employment offices have been established, 
by extending full use of their resources. In other places the 
school should make some direct provision for meeting the great 
need. 

3. Co-ordination of School and Other Social Services . 

Public services for children and youths have become highly 
specialized. Each service has grown in response to particular 
needs. The child who needs assistance in solving a problem 
may be referred to several agencies in the course of finding 
the needed solution. There is little evidence of progress 
in the planning of community social services to the end 
that the child may be given single, unified consideration 
by co-operating agencies. It becomes the business of the 


school to supjjly a unifying influence.

Schools, libraries, and museums seek by joint effort to make 
educational opportunity continuous from early childhood; the 
schools and recreational agencies are beginning to co¬ 
ordinate their efforts to provide leisure-time opportunities 
for children and adults, using school buildings and facilities 
as the centres of activities* In the area of child health 
there is a tendency toward better definition and co-ordination 
of educational and medical functions and increasingly 
satisfactory relations among the school, the family physician, 
and the public-health department. Closer working relations 
are being established between school and labour authorities 
in the control of child labour. School policy with regard 
to relationships with other community services has not thus 
far crystallized In such form as to be widely accepted and 
actively promoted. 

Comprehensive and community-wide planning is the primary 
means by which the school and other community agencies can 
relate their efforts. Community use of school facilities 
is one of the means of relating services that effect the 
child. By placing the branch library and possibly the 
neighborhood health clinic in the school building and by 
utilizing both indoor and outdoor facilities for recreation 
purposes the school itself can serve as a facilitating agency. 
Reciprocal use of records and personnel by schools and other 
agencies offers another means of co-operating.

teaching methods and the new curricula require the use of 
many books; excellence in teaching depends partly on a well 
administered school library which provides satisfactory 
working materials for both the staff and the pupils. The 
student today, with the help of the school library, can 
establish reading habits which will affect their individual 
happiness as future citizens, and, hence, the life of the 
community. 

The school library has a positive teaching function. It 
should encourage the development of social techniques and 
attitudes in harmony with and essential to the democratic 
way of living. It supplies materials for developing and 
expanding new curricular and recreational interests through 
its reference facilities and its books for home use. It 
shares with the classroom the responsibility of teaching 
pupils to use books and libraries to find information and 
to learn how to study. By introducing students to the use 
of the public library, it promotes the life-time habit of 
reading to further any interest or experience. 

The school library is a reading centre - a place for 
enjoying books, for investigating problems, for study, and 
for using printed materials, clippings, pamphlets, pictures, 
maps and magazines. Appropriate physical features of the 
room make the pupil comfortable and facilitate reading and 
study. The school librarian should be so effective a guide 
and leader that the reader is almost unaware of the services 


rendered

Because of the necessary and valuable services which the 
library renders in the modern sc.hool program, school 
authorities should provide for a school library or equivalent 
services and staffed by qualified and competent personnel 
in every school. 


REDIRECTION OP SCHOOL EXPERIENCES 

The educated person needs more than a knowledge of the 
tools of learning. Education must be as broad as life it¬ 
self. Our society requires of the growing child and youth 
a knowledge of social processes, a command of useful skills, 
and attitudes that ensure the use of knowledge for good 
purposes* These directives must become a part of the growing, 
living personality of the child. 

1, Education in Human Relationships 

The child must learn at an early age how to get along with 
other people effectively. This involves not only family 
and friends but fellow human beings of diverse racial and 
ethnic origins. His understanding of family life arises 
out of daily experience in seeing how people live together; 
he acquires a practical knowledge of emotions, motives, 
attitudes, and other behavior controls; he begins to develop 
an understanding of such things as the marriage partner¬ 
ship and family economics. His relationship with friends, 
as well as his contacts with fellow citizens, also provide 
experience in co-operation and in giving consideration to

the right of others. 

Schools must recognize that human relationships comprise an 
area that requires increased emphasis in the education 
program. A first step is to replace the competitive spirit 
that characterizes the traditional school room, with an 
atmosphere of co-operation in which each child gives something 
of his own personality and experience. Situations should be 
arranged which give children the opportunity of contributing 
to the welfare of their family and social group. Beyond 
that the school should encourage observation and frank dis¬ 
cussion* in suitable groups* of problems and conflicts that 
arise in the student’s experience. Sex education is an 
excellent case in point. This manifestly requires highly 
qualified group leaders. A further need is to draw out of 
related instruction those values that have a bearing on 
family and other relationships; of particular importance in 
this regard is instruction in biology* psychology* sociology* 
and home-making® 

2. Education in Healthful Living . 

Health education is potentially the most important single 
factor affecting the physical well being of the growing 
generation. Many institutions and agencies contribute to 
health education for better or worse, including the family 
physician, the public health department, the school, the 
family itself* and numerous commerical enterprises. Among 
these the school has the opportunity to be one of the most 
positive* continuing influences for good health.

However effective their efforts may have been in the past, 

most schools need to make additions to and improvements in 

their programs of health education. Every school should 

provide regular health instruction involving not only the 

efforts of a qualified teacher but related instruction by 

all teachers whose subject fields have a bearing on health. 

Health instruction should include safety education. The 

school not only should teach the facts of personal and 

community health but should motivate the child to use his 

knowledge. Every health experience in school should be made 

educational; dietitians, school physicians, dentists, and 

nurses should understand their obligation to teach facts 

and foster good habits along with every service rendered, 
should 

Every child/receive health guidance of such a nature as ^ 
will permit him to make most effective use of all medical 
and related services available. Ways and means should be 
found by which education in child health can be given to 
parents; through this effort the gains in health education 
can be consolidated and made effective in the home. 

3, Education for Use of Leisure . 

Eree time is a new experience for many persons. They 
frequently do not know how to use leisure wisely; their 
diversions tend to be exhaustive rather than re-creative. 
Recreation need not be activity alone, nor should it con¬ 
sist solely of inactivity. The school*s task is to create 
in child and adult an understanding of leisure resources 
that exist within each individual, as well, as those that 
are provided for him.

Education for leisure, through the school, must involve the 
entire school personnel, for its scope is as broad as 
education itself. It is necessary that the child acquire a 
desirable attitude toward recreation based on knowledge of 
the part leisure plays in his life. This come with Increasing 
breadth of experience and interest, and through the satis¬ 
factions that arise from carrying each job to a successful 
conclusion. It is attainable likewise through the example 
of teachers and leaders who themselves have caught its 
elusive quality. 

The child should be helped to develop habits and skills, 
knowledge,’ and appreciation so that he may be able to 
enjoy his everyday experiences', both through participation 
and through observation. He can then understand the 
physical, intellectual, and esthetic possibilities for 
leisure enjoyment and can appreciate not only his own efforts 
but the efforts of others as well. Every child should be 
given opportunity for creative expression. This capacity 
exists in all children in some degree; its full release 
requires opportunity, motivation, and guidance* 

4. Education for Occupational Efficiency . 

Most people must work for a living. They look to the school 
to give them the foundation, first, for securing economic 
independence and, second, for making adjustment to occu¬ 
pational conditions. Because youth must assume the 
responsibilities that accompany maturity they need to make 


a reasonably good vocational adjustment soon after leaving

school. Through vocational education and guidance involving 
the co-operative efforts of organized labour, industry, 
public employment services, and the schools this end can be 
more nearly achieved for the majority of youth than it is 
today. 

To prepare youth for participation in vocational life, it is 
of basic importance that prevocational preparation become an 
integral part of the program offered all youth in the 
secondary school. This experience should develop familiarity 
with tools and the requirements of occupational life, respect 
for work as a necessary part of living, and some understanding 
of labour relations, social security provisions, and similar 
important factors in employment. It is necessary to provide 
for those who will enter vocational training for particular 
skilled trades preliminary preparation of a technical or 
vocational character in order to facilitate the transition 
from general education to vocational training. This pre¬ 
paration should not be unduly specialized. There should 
also be provision of vocational education in industrial, 
homemaking, agricultural, and distributive occupations that 
do not require long preparation. For the group undertaking 
this program the possibilities of combining work experience 
with related education in school should be further explored. 
Finally, the public schools should provide continued 
opportunities in both general and vocational education for 
youth who have already started their occupational careers.

and for school provision of personal and vocational guidance 
appear in the section on "Continuing. Services for Youth." 

5. Education for Responsible Living * 

Ihe schools impart knowledge; it is imperative that the 
school experience give direction to the use-of that knowledge. 
The ethical concept is supreme in all education, whether it 
comes through the influence of home, church, or school, or 
by other means. Public schools can be concerned neither 
with sectarianism nor with theology. They do seek for 
every child sound dhical judgment and a wholesome philosophy 
of life. These are as fully within the scope of public 
education as instruction in any academic discipline. 

The child will develop his own ethical standards under any 
circumstances; it is urgently necessary in our society that 
this development be guided aright. The school must con¬ 
tribute through helping the child to learn from his many 
experiences what society accepts as good or bad, as right 
or wrong. This does not come from instruction alone; more 
largely it is a product of example; the pattern becomes 
fixed in proportion as it has an emotional flavour. The 
school can contribute further through giving the child 
experiences that require ethical judgment at the different 
levels of maturity. It should aid the child in understanding 
the power that is beyond man, the power that gives meaning 
and direction to life. Studies such as biology and physiology 
can aid in this understanding; it comes also through the 





21 


Influence of persons who themselves comprehend the deeper 
values of religion. Each of these influences aids the 
child to establish values which, taken together, comprise 
a philosophy that gives guidance to life and learning. 

6. Education for Civic Responsibility. 

Our democracy is threatened today by ignorance of what is 
required to keep it alive. 'Citizenship involves not only 
use of the franchise but such other privileges and respon¬ 
sibilities as proper exercise of freedom, observance of law, 
knowledge of political organization and political processes, 
and respect for differences of opinion. Selfishness, 
intolerance, and unduly restricted freedom are found on 
every hand. The school’s influence on the behavior of 
children in matters of citizenship leaves much to be desired; 
this is attributable largely to restraints upon teaching and 
to lack of experience in treating, issues that are highly 
technical and often controversial. 

Students must be given experience and actual responsibility 
if they are to know the significance of political citizenship. 
To this' end the focus of experience should be shifted more 
largely from classroom to community; taking even a small 
part in solving community problems vitalizes democracy for 
the learner. It is usually possible to give the studdnt 
actual responsibility in the government of the school; 
however small the part that each may play, participation 
will yield returns far greater than can be obtained through 
recitation alone. It is desirable also to unify the

teaching of school subjects that have a bearing on citizen¬ 
ship). through emphasis on the inter-relationships of 
history, geography, economics, and sociology as they affect 
our civilization the student can relate his knowledge and 
experience most usefully. The proper use of this knowledge 
of citizenship according to the principles of democracy 
should be the all-pervading purpose of education. 

GROWING CHILDREN REQUIRE A SUITABLE SCHOOL ENVIRONMENT 

The success of the child in school depends in large part 
upon environmental influences. Many times these influences 
are such as to prevent the child from attaining his fullest 
intellectual, social, and moral stature. This need not be 
so. The environment of the school child is subject to the 
control of the people through their constituted authorities. 

1. School Personnel . 

Successful school programs are generally attributed to the 
quality of professional personnel. A school can be no better 
than its teachers, supervisors, and administrators. They 
are intermediary between society and the child, guiding his 
formal education by means of carefully selected experiences. 
For discharging this important function teachers and other 
school officials must have de&rable personal qualities, 
good emotional balance, a broad background of experience, 
and a high degree of professional skill. 


Many communities are not receiving the kind of professional

leadership required by the social importance of education* 

One investigation - * - showed that "of college seniors tested for 
available knoweldge, the group intending to teach constitutes 
a large division centered below the average and scattered 
over a wide range*" Such a situation is understandable in 
view of the financial inducments of teaching* 

Good teaching and administrative services are purchasable 
commodities* Further advances require co-operation within 
provinces by department of education, officials of public 
and separate schools, teacher-education institutuions, and 
professional organizations. The planners might well discuss 
such matters as the recruitment and selection of prospective 
teachers, teacher-preparation functions to be undertaken by 
each institution, the strengthening of institutional faculties, 
improvements in teacher-education curricula, and relations 
of teacher preparation institutions with in-service teachers. 
Because of the importance of teacher-child relationships 
to the mental health of children, much greater consideration 
should be given to the physical and emotional adjustment 
of prospective teachers as well as of teachers in service, 

A further step should be the statutory raising of standards 
that affect teaching. The establishment by law of higher 
minimum salaries, actuarily sound retirement systems, and 
tenure surrounded by reasonable safeguards will tend to

attract a higher caliber of person into the profession. 
Requirement of a college degree for certification will help 
to Improve standards of preparation. 

There is urgent need for the progressive improvement of 
teacher-education curricula. Higher standards for the general 
and professional education of prospective teachers need to be 
established and widely adopted. Prospective teachers should 
have direct contact with growing children during much of 
their pre-service education. The provision of continuing 
in-service education for all teachers is likewise greatly 
needed. Tactful and stimulating supervision is the first 
requisite. A further highly important element of in-service 
education is the opportunity to work under a democratic 
administration in which every teacher has both the privilege 
and the responsibility of contributing to school policy. 

If the taxpayers and parent of Canada want professional 
teaching, they will have to pay a professional salary. And 
when they do pay a professional salary, they must demand 
and get professional teaching. With a professional salary 
we can actively compete with law, medicine, and industry 
in inducing the ablest young people to enter our profession. 

If we are to have professional teaching, we must have pro¬ 
fessional equipment. Not one school in ten in Canada is 
adequately equipped with library books, maps, globes, models, 
mock-ups, simple scientific apparatus, films, film-strip 
projectors, photographs, exhibits, radios, recordings.

If we are to have professional teaching, we must have pro¬ 
fessional preparation for that teaching* Much earnest and 
intellectual effort has been put forth by teachers 1 colleges 
to improve their work. But much remains to be done* The 
material we teach doesn’t function adequately for the teacher 
on the job either because we teach too much too soon, or 
because we unwisely depend upon the possibility of a later 
transfer from books to actual practice - something which we 
condemn in our courses in psychology. ’’Book learning” is 
not life learning. 

One of our most fundamental changes in teaching education 
will come with a sharp increase in ’in-service’ education* 

The young teacher on her first job and the older teacher 
both need the specialized help that can be given by a 
teacher education Institution* The whole movement of pro¬ 
fessional clinics re workshops In reading, arithmetic, 
child development is an excellent step in the right direction. 

What can we promise the taxpayer and parent for the in¬ 
creased sums of money we will pay? We can say to him that 
children will be happier in school, that they will learn 
to read better, learn the art of working together with their 
fellow students, develop a real sense of obligation not only 
to their school, but also to their city, their province, 
and their nation, and learn specific ways to serve their 
country. We can promise a more intelligent, happier home 
life, not merely through the education of children, but

through the wise program of community education. We can 
promise a sharp improvement in the mental and physical health 
of our nation. 

After every great war in the last hundred years, the defeated 
nation has turned to its educational system to strengthen 
itself. Perhaps the time has come for the victors to be wise# 
Can’t we turn to our schools, not to avenge defeat, but to 
make victory certain? If as the charter of UNESCO avers, 

"wars being in the minds of men,” why don’t we start when 
they are immature, flexible? Why don’t we start now using 
the schools to help build excellent future homes, to build 
civic responsibility, to develop a nation and a world that 
is willing to do what is necessary to achieve world-wide 
peace and security? 

2. School Facilities. 

School facilities are a tangible expression of the school 
program. Efficiency is materially increased where educational 
buildings and equipment are adequate to the needs being served 
conversely inferior and unsuitable facilities tend to limit 
the effectiveness of otherwise superior schools. The 
depression left a huge accumulation of need for land, 
buildings, and materials of instruction. Even apart from 
losses due to normal deterioration and other natural causes, 
the changes in the school program have rendered obsolete 
many of the facilities now in use. The drain of the war 


years has greatly intensified the situation. There is a

great back-log which must be taken up so as to make the 
facilities meet the present day needs. High school popu¬ 
lations are increasing and the elementary schools will be 
more than over-flowing when the tidal wave of six-year olds 
engulf our educational system from 1948 through 1954. 
Communities are demanding more adequately equipped school 
facilities for recreational and other uses; broader school 
programs require specialized facilities, such as clinic and 
consultation rooms, preschool rooms, home-making laboratories, 
rooms for handicapped children, libraries, shops, and visual- 
auditory education equipment* 

Large additional resources must be devoted to school faci¬ 
lities during the coming decade. The first step for com¬ 
munities to take is to determine their needs for land, 
buildings, and capital equipment in terms of local population 
trends, new program demands, and community use of facilities. 
From these data comprehensive plans for school construction 
can be developed. To finance an adequate school planned 
with the aid of the teachers, the Provincial and Dominion 
governments should give assistance in order to permit 
organization of larger schools and better services. 

3. Adjustments to the Individual Needs of the Child. 
Mass-production methods are not applicable to education* Each 
child is physically, mentally, and emotionally different from 
every other child. Handicapped children face physical or 
mental and often emotional barriers to learning. Each must

b© motivated and guided along lines which his individuality 
will determine* Experience must be adjusted to the growth 
pattern of the child, however far that may vary from others« 
While democracy gains its indentity by group action, each 
group depends for social effectiveness upon the personal 
effectiveness of the individuals which comprise it* 

The best teachers and allied professional workers have pro¬ 
gressed far in learning how to fulfill child needs. Tech¬ 
niques are now available for appraising the individual in 
terms of health and development, particular talents, and 
ability to learn; children with a physical or mental handi¬ 
cap can be readily identified* Experience has been gained 
in planning well-rounded programs for the normal child and 
in varying the opportunities offered to children of unusual 
intellectual ability, to those who are mentally retarded* 
Guidance services are being developed to help each child 
establish attainable goals and to work out ways and means of 
reaching these goals. Application of these techniques and 
services should more nearly enable every child to find 
suitable opportunities for expressing his own individuality 
within the social.group. 

Progress in adjusting school programs to individual needs 
has been slow largely because of inadequate school budgets* 
In the States it is estimated that only about eleven to 
twelve per cent of the children five to twenty years of age 
have the advantage of a medical examination within a given 
year. Mental tests are probably more widely used, but the

number of teachers that can administer and interpret these 
tests is still discourgagingly small. The typical elementary 
school teacher instructs a class of thirty pupils for approxi¬ 
mately six hours a day. Most often children with various 
degrees of physical and/or mental handicap do not get the 
special consideration they require * except in the larger 
cities. Under these conditions, all of which can be remedied 
with Increased funds, individualization of Instruction is 
nearly impossible. 

Meeting individual needs within the classroom Is largely a 
responsibility which can and should be carried by the class¬ 
room teacher. It is of primary importance that the teacher 
load be adjusted to this need by increasing the number of 
teachers where necessary. Next in importance is the 
appraisal of each child from as many standpoints as possible. 
The minimum program should Include at least a careful 
medical examination at suitable Intervals during the period 
of school attendance so that handicaps to learning may be 
discovered and corrected or adjusted; other types of 
appraisals should be made wherever possible by special 
trained workers. 

Of future importance is the provision of continuing personal 
guidance, by qualified counsellors, based on appraisals and 
other Information concerning interests, abilities, and needs 
of the child. Cumulative records should be kept on all 
standard tests, achievements, and recommendations as an aid 
to further guidance. Of final importance are adjustments

in the school program to permit the widest possible variety 
of experience to be offered every child, both within and 
outside school walls* 

RESEARCH AND PLANNING FOR CHILD NEED 

Planning is a requisite to progress in any endeavor* Aside 
from experience, research provides the only sound basis for 
planning* This function is slowly becoming recognized as an 
essential aspect of administration. Only during the last 
two decades has research assumed a significant role, and the 
planning movement Is of even more recent origin. In 
education, as in other enterprises, policy-making involves 
choices that can be wisely determined only on the basis of 
fact. There Is abundant need for applied research on pro¬ 
blems of child development, school administration, finance, 
materials and methods of instruction, and preparation of 
personnel. 

Education research is still in an early period of growth* 
Knowledge of child development is advancing rapidly through 
research* Only a relatively small proportion of present- 
day knowledge, however, is actually being applied to class¬ 
room procedures. Local planning in the form of budgeting 
is engaged in by most school systems. Yet relatively few 
of them employ research personnel, even on part time, to 
furnish necessary facts. The provinces have broad policy¬ 
making functions, but how many of them has a division of 


research?

School surveys meet a type of research need in providing 
evaluation of policies and procedures- Sound educational 
progress is contingent upon the application of research to 
specific school problems. The provision of research, ser¬ 
vices by local school systems, either individually or co¬ 
operatively, is an immediate necessity- Further research 
in child development and evaluation of pupil 'progress is 
especially needed® It is highly desirable that research 
divisions be established In each Department of Education, 
not to compile statistics but to enable these departments 
to study and provide solutions for educational problems of 
provincial-wide scope® Research is valuable only when it 
is used. Through this ultimate step the results of research 
can be used as the basis for wise planning of teaching and 
administrative procedures that effect the educational 
development of every child® 


CONCLUSIONS 

Democracy is dependent upon the educational opportunities 
made available to all citizens. This nation cannot afford 
to deny any of its children the privilege of attending a 
good school. Within the community the school is but one 
institution among many that serve the child; it is the only 
one primarily concerned with his education® The strengthen¬ 
ing of democratic government requires education for every 
child adapted to his needs and capacities.

The following conclusions are submitted: 

1. A well-equipped school, staffed by competent teachers, 

should be available to every child within reasonable 

distance of his home* This can be achieved through 

Larger units of local school administration planned 
on a Province-wide basis. 

Increased Provincial support of local schools such 
as will reduce inequalities in educational oppor¬ 
tunities • 

Federal aid for education distributed among the 
provinces in such a way as to reduce educational 
inequalities• 

Financial aid for needy children to make possible 
their attendance at school. 

Improve general professional education of teachers, 
with particular emphasis on child growth and 
development* 

Appointment of teachers and retention in service on 
the basis of professional qualifications alone. 

More adequate and suitable school facilities to meet 
new requirements of the educational program. 

2. Every child should have learning experiences that are 
adjusted to his individual needs and that encourage the 
development of attitudes and skills necessary for demo¬ 
cratic living. This requires -- 

Provision of kindergarten, nursery school, or similar 
preschool experience for every child. 

Revision of teaching procedures and school organization 
to make possible richer learning experiences in school 
and community and to assure continuous progress of the 
child. 

Arrangement of individual programs adjusted to the 
growth pattern and individual needs of each child. 
Including those who are physically handicapped, 
mentally retarded, or socially maladjusted.

More effective education and guidance of the child 
in human relationships, health living, use of 
leisure time, preparation for an occupation, 
ethical standards, and civic responsibility. 

Co-operation of the school with other institutions 
and agencies, including the home, that serve the 
child* 

Education of parents and prospective parents through 
the school to make possible the maintenance of more 
desirable homes and better educational opportunities 
for the child in the home* 

3. Every school system should provide school opportunity 

and vocational preparation, based on adequate vocational 

guidance, for all youth# This makes necessary -- 

Provision of free secondary school opportunities 
for youth up to eighteen or twenty years of age* 

Effective guidance leading to the development of 
occupational plans during the secondary school 
period* 

Prevocational preparation for all youth about to 
complete their formal schooling# 

Broad vocational education within the secondary 
school for youth who will later receive intensive 
training for skilled trades® 

Co-operation of the school in the guidance and 
placement of out-of-school youth. 

Continued educational opportunity in school for 
youth who already started their occupational 
careers # 

4# Continued progress necessitates research and planning for 

the better education of the child# There is need for -- 

Establishment of research divisions by local school 
systmes or divisions, wherever possible, and by all 
provincial departments of education# 

Planning of educational policies and programs at all 
levels based on the finds of research.

5. The traditional concern of Canadian education with ethical 
values as well as mental and physical development should 
continue to be the fundamental obligation of the schools. 
It is desirable that the teaching and administrative 
staffs should maintain among themselves and in their 
attitudes toward children the processes and viewpoints 
characteristic of a democratic society* 'Such attitudes 
will thrive only in an atmosphere of freedom to teach 
and freedom to learn*

PREVIOUS STUDIES 

I wish to examine briefly the results of similar Investi¬ 
gations, particularly those in th® United States* Since 
1924 an ever Increasing number of these have been conducted 
on both a state wide and on a national scale* The task of 
sorting out from this ever increasing volume of material 
all that might be classed as important is quite beyond the 
scope of this study* R. H. Eliassen and E. W. Anderson^ 

In th© "Educational Research Bulletin" reviewed in their 
first report the significant studies relating to supply and 
demand for teachers appearing since 1924* Their review is 
now a yearly feature of the Bulletin. 

2 

Th© National Survey of the Education of Teachers mad® a 

comprehensive study of supply and demand and the following 

is a brief survey of the more important ideas contained 

in this study. Upon the points listed below Questionnaire 

3 

M for the C* E. A. Committee was based. 

THE EDUCATIONAL FACTORS AFFECTING THE DEMAND FOR 

TEACHERS: 

1. Th© number of teachers, supervisors, administrators 
actually employed during any year In the school 
systems of a state. These records should show the 
number fey:- 

(a) School division or level: e.g., kindergarten, 

senior high.

14. Security of tenure. 

In 1930-31 a nation-wide survey was made in the United States. 
Certain terms were set up and definitions given. A 'new* 
teacher was defined as a teacher who was not employed in the 
present school system the previous year* ’Mobility ratio’ 
was defined as the ratio of new teachers to the total number 
of teachers in the same type of position. Thus, if there 
were 2,000 teachers and 500 reported as new to that position, 
the mobility ratio was said to be 1:4. This definition did 
not distinguish between teachers transferred from one school 
system to another, that is from community to community, and 
those who were beginners in the sense that they were teaching

for the first time* 

The mobility ratio for the United States in 1930-31 was as 
follows: 

(1) Elementary school teachers 1:4.8 

(2) Junior high school teachers 1:6.7 

(5) Senior high school teachers 1:4.9 1 2 

Certain marked variations were noted. In the one and two 

teacher elementary country school the mobility ratio was 

1:2.5. In cities of 100,000 or more population the mobility 

ratio for elementary school teachers was 1:20.2. Almost as 

wide variations were found between states. North Dakota 

was high with a ratio of 1:2.15 while Washington, D. C., 

had a ratio of 1:16. 


In the elementary schools end of term vacancies were dis¬ 
tributed as follows: 

% 

(a) Vacancy due to transfer to another position 42.2 

(b) Because of marriage of predecessor 16.4 

(c) Death of predecessor .7 

(d) Retirement of predecessor 6.0 

(e) Predecessor entered another profession or 

occupation 6.5 

(f) Predecessor left on leave of absence 

illness or study , 3.6^ 

(g) Not stated 24.6^ 

This shows that nearly half the vacancies, 42.2$, did not 
result In the demand for a beginning teacher. Prom a con¬ 
sideration of the average mobility ratio for the whole 
nation it appeared that about one-fifth of the teachers were 
new. As one of these indicated they had not taught before

then about one-tenth were beginners or really new teachers* 


The following outline of their suggested plan for determining 
the demand is illustrative of the refinement to which they 
carried their analysis and of the number of factors which 
enter into such a prediction. They felt the plan should fe® 


revised every two years in the light of as many data as are 
available* The following formula is suggested as a basis 
for estimating the demand for teachers.^

1 - the number of teachers recruited through examinations, 
cadet training and other sources* 
m = the number of teachers eliminated because of with¬ 
drawal or curtailment of services* 
n - the number of teachers who returned to teaching 

having some other occupation other than teaching 
in the meantime* 

o s the number of unemployed elementary teachers whose 
preparation is acceptable in qualify, quantity, 
professional nature and recency, who can be 
absorbed each year without disrupting the con¬ 
tinuity of programs for the education of teachers, 
p s the margin of safety consisting of enough elementary 
teachers in excess of the number actually needed, 
to care for the emergencies and unforseen 
developments and also to replace incompetents 
when necessary* 

Each of these elements is a variable, and each can be esti¬ 
mated for one year or period with a relatively high degree 
of accuracy. As a conclusion the authors maintained that 
the shortage of teachers lowers the standards by allowing 
poorly prepared teachers to enter the profession and an 
oversupply is equally bad as it destroys the moral© of 
teachers both employed and unemployed* 


New Jersey was the first state to deliberately try to balance 
the supply and demand* In 1927 New Jersey began to curtail 
the enrolment in the Normal Schools* Coupled with this the 
state began a continuing study of teacher turnover* Year 
by year since 1927 the following data have been collected: 

(a) an accurate record of all graduates from state 
controlled teacher training institutions in New 
Jersey by year, majors, and type of certificates* 

(b) an accurate record of all graduates of privately 
controlled colleges in New Jersey, legally quali¬ 
fied to teach in New Jersey* 

(c) an accurate record of in-state and out-of-state 
placements for these two classes of institutions*

(d) an accurate record of teaching certificates of all 
kinds granted to graduates in institutions outside 
of New Jersey.^- 

Thus by knowing the number and type of new teachers placed 
each year, and the number prepared, it is possible for the 
Department of Education, under whose authority this work is 
carried out, to determine whether the supply is being main¬ 
tained or is in excess* 

There are many variables which cannot be controlled nor pre¬ 
dicted by such a procedure as the above. Some of these 
variables are: 

(a) Economic conditions: The depression resulted in 
decreased funds which meant a curtailment of program. 

Instead of new appointments the classes were made larger* 
Retirements were delayed. Certificated teachers who had 
left for better things returned to swell the supply. In 
general, if economic conditions are good the converse is 
true and the supply'of teachers is short* 

(b) The number of teachers for a given population 
depends on the value the state attaches to education. New 
Jersey with a population of 4,042,000 ’needs’ twenty-eight 
thousand teachers while a nearby state with 1,652,000 
population ’needs 1 only thirty-three hundred teachers* 

(c) The time between prediction and need is a variable 
depending on the time of teacher preparation. If it 
requires one or two years of preparation, then the estimate

need can be fairly well estimated. The longer the period of 
preparation the less significant does the prediction become# 
(d) The extending field - the introduction or the ex» 
tension of the kindergarten, adult education, or the expand- 
ing high school program makes it imperative that one should 
know the number of teachers prepared for the new work and 
the number that will be required. 


In closing Tousend made the following recommendations:^ 

(a) Teaching should be considered a privilege and 
not a right and therefore the state should 
enforce selective admission. 

(b) In a four-year program the college should admit 
ten per cent more freshmen in each major subject 
than were placed the previous year# 

(c) Discontinue the policy of permanent certification 
because teachers become obsolete in methods and 
ideas unless compelled to keep up to date# 

(d) One must constantly canvass educational trends 
and possible new developments and anticipate 
new areas of demand by a gradual expansion of 
new service training facilities.

Grant and Cowley^ have devised a technique for analyzing the 
supply and demand for educational workers. They show how 
to get the relationship between supply and demand for each 
type of teacher. The following table illustrates its 
operation. With an extended table one could see at a glance 
which positions were in short supply and which in excess#

The following ten points are some of the findings from th® 
nine studies listed above. 

(1) An oversupply of teachers tends to lower salaries, 
make tenure Insecure, and force many teachers to seek more 
lucrative occupations.

(2) There tends to be an oversupply of persons with 
license to teach* but a limited supply of persons with a 
high level of professional training. 

(5) In a period oversupply of teachers the certi¬ 
fication and professional training requirements should be 
raised. This keeps out those who refuse to meet high 
standards and to force those holding temporary certi¬ 
ficates to obtain higher license* and to diminish th© 
number of new graduates until the profession can absorb 
the oversupply. 

(4) The certification requirements need to be raised* 
and the certification power should be centralized in the 
state department of education. 

(5) Th© high school normal training classes and 
similar inferior teacher-training agencies should be 
abolished as rapidly as possible. The turnover among those 
with inferior training is so rapid as to be harmful to 
rural schools. 

(6) Particular attention should be given to the need 
for better salaries and better trained teachers in rural 
areas. Will rural salaries ever be attractive without 
state aid for education? 

(7) There is need for guidance of the number of 
teachers preparing to teach specific subjects. The academic 
subjects are more quiekly oversupplied than the vocational 
and commerical subjects.

(8) Teacher training activities need to be centered 
under state control* 

(9) The migration of teachers between states seriously 
influence teacher supply and the state teacher-training pro¬ 
gram. The out-of-state teachers constitute from ten to 
fifty per cent of the annual supply. 

(10) There is need for a continuous and extensive 
study of teacher demand and supply by state school officials. 
Pact finding and publicity should be continuous. 

THE CRISIS IN AMERICAN EDUCATION 1 

Dr. Fine’s twelve articles dealing with the Crisis in the 
American School appeared in The New York Times from February 
10 to February 21, 1947. He says in part: "I found 
appalling war damage to the public school system - plants 
have deteriorated, the classes are overcrowded, supplies 
are lacking, unrest and lowered morale are general. In many 
communities teachers have gone out on strike; picket lines 
have closed a number of schools. Plainly, the teachers are 
not happy, and that, basically, is a question of money.” 

The Times survey shows that the classroom teacher in America 
receives an average weekly salary of $37.00. Compare this

with the earnings of the garbage collector, or the street 
cleaner, and you find that these get more* The comparison 
helps explain why since 1940, more than 350,000 teachers 
have left the public schools* A total of 125,000, or more 
than one out of seven teachers, hold only a substandard or 
emergency license. Seventy thousand teaching positions 
are vacant solely because the systems cannot get teachers 
to fill them. And to make matters worse few young people 
seem to want to go into teaching any more. In 1920, twenty- 
two per cent of all the college students were in teachers® 
colleges; today, it is less than seven per cent. Before 
1950, this country will need 500,000 newly trained teachers. 
Using the most optimistic estimates, less than half the 
number will be available. 

In many instances school superintendents, desperate and at 
their wit f s end, had hired as teachers men and women with 
little or no professional competence. Even though all sorts 
of inducements are being offered, all sorts of expedients 
tried, the shortage is growing more acute. 

Cities of more than 100,000 reach down to the 50,000 
communities. By paying them more money, they can secure 
teachers for their systems. Then these cities, in turn, 
look toward the smaller ones for their own staff. This 
pirating continues until many communities, especially the 
rural or the more impoverished districts, have no one 
from whom to steal. They must, therefore, be content with

what is left* 

In addition to the major difficulty of low salaries, other 
factors contribute to the teacher shortage* Teachers object 
to the community restrictions that they face in many sections 
of the country, particularly in rural areas. They dislike to 
be at the beck and call of the town father, and subjected 
to humiliating intrusion upon their personal affairs. They 
are strongly opposed to the political interference that 
frequently keeps them at the mercy of the community leaders. 

During the depression there were plenty of teachers avail¬ 
able, and long waiting lists became the rule in every major 
city. The teaching profession seemed a safe harbor in 
which to weather the storm. It proved to be anything but 
that. Teachers* salaries dropped and so did their security* 

Then came the war. Immediately there was a demand for 
help of all kinds, skilled and unskilled. The teachers who 
were still waiting for appointment found it unnecessary 
to wait any longer. They took jobs with the government, in 
business or in industry, at much higher salaries than they 
could hope to earn In the classroom. 

The schools now had a double problem - to find replacements 
for their regular teachers and to secure a sufficient number 
of substitutes. The schools put out frantic calls for help 
as the teachers in mounting numbers left the classrooms and 
put on overalls. Additional thousands of experienced

teachers found good office positions with the government* 
or got on the state civil service lists* The departure 
became infectious: the public school teachers of the 
nation gave up their teaching posts* 

The growth of the shortage did not end with the war* In 
the postwar months it has continued to grow. Rural towns 
and large cities report quite frankly that they do not 
have enough teachers to run their schools efficiently* 
Moreover* they have no idea as to where they can get the 
much needed instructors. Although someone usually is found 
to take the classes* the teacher is often an incompetent 
makeshift who cannot meet even the minimum requirements of 
her state. 

The shortage exists on both the elementary and secondary 
levels but the greatest need is in the elementary grades. 
For the little children in the important years when 
educational foundations are laid, superintendents simply 
cannot find enough experienced or even partially trained 
teachers. Superintendents are forced to appoint teachers 
who, under ordinary conditions, would not have been 
acceptable. They do not come up to the standards of 
quality, personality, ability to render service, or the 
general educational background of our former teachers. 

In the high schools a number of subjects are particularly 
hard hit, among them physics, chemistry, mathematics, 
biology, and the leading technical courses. High schools

have been forced to discontinue to offer any work in these 
important areas* In Colorado, twenty-five per cent of the 
high school teachers are instrue ting in subjects for which 
they do not hold regular licenses* Most of them are in 
science, mathematics, and commercial courses* 

Sometimes the schools cannot get teachers and simply close 
down* The TIMES survey shows that during the 1946-47 year 
nearly 6,000 schools have been closed because of lack of 
teachers, which means that 75,000 children are getting no 
schooling at all. For them (and their parents) the demo¬ 
cratic concept of free education for all has little meaning. 

Some state systems find it necessary to transport children 
many miles to get them to school. In other Instances, the 
children simply do not go to school at all* In all, there 
are nearly 70,000 unfilled positions in the schools of the 
nation* 

The hoped-for postwar improvement has not taken place. 
Sometimes the damage done the schools is intangible; at 
other times it is visible*,, The TIMES study shows that the 
ham Is real and lasting: tens of thousands of classes 
are overcrowded: educational facilities are lacking: 
textbooks and school supplies are needed: the enriched 
curriculum offerings of many systems have been eliminated.

"Although the children are not walking the street, it 
would be far better if many schools closed their 
doors. Then at least the community would know the 
serious nature of its problem. 

The teacher shortage, acute as it is today, will grow 
worse during the next five years. At present the big 
cities are living off the flesh and blood of the small 
rural schools. We will need a ten years® supply of 
teachers in the next four years. It looks as though 
we will never catch up with the demand.*’ 


In normal times, the public schools need about 90,000 new 
teachers each year representing a ten per cent replacement, 
to fill gaps in the ranks caused by death, resignation, 
and retirement. Before the war, the teachers® colleges 
graduated about 50,000 teachers annually, and the additional 
40,000 came from liberal arts colleges and other educational 
institutions. Today, the teachers® colleges are not 
attracting a sufficient number of students to meet their 
prewar share of the replacement needs. All told, the country 
can be expected to prepare not more than 35,000 to 40,000 
qualified teachers a year for the next four or five years. 

Meanwhile the increased birth rate of the war and postwar 
years means an imminent jump in the school rolls, and hence 
a demand for additional teachers. The best estimates 
indicate that we shall need at least 100,000 new teachers 
annually* With less than half this number being trained, the 
teacher shortage, far from lessening in the years just ahead, 
seems likely to become more severe. 

Alarmed by this outlook, the Office of Education has set up 
a Citizens Federal Committee on Education to study the pro* 
blem and recommend remedies. Thomas C. Boushall, Chairman

of the Committee, warms: "The present crisis affecting the 
teaching profession throughout the country is of such gravity 
as to threaten the future of the American way of life." 

His warning is echoed by distinguished educators and laymen 
throughout the United States. The public, although still 
unaware of the gravity of the problem, is gradually becoming 
concerned with the plight of the schools. President Trumai 
has established a commission of educational experts, directed 
by Francis J. Brown of the American Council on Education, to 
make an extensive study of the nation’s educational problems. 

A generation ago a teaching appointment was highly respectable 
conferring real prestige. Today the teacher’s post is scorned, 
and until that public attitude is corrected, many experts 
feel the shortage of new recruits to the profession will 
continue. The Advertising Council of New York, in co¬ 
operation with leading school groups, is planning a campaign 
to raise the standing of the teaching profession to past 
levels. 

It Is the concensus of informed educators everywhere that the 
United States cannot neglect its teacher shortage any longer. 
Poor teachers and undermanned schools of today inevitably 
mean poor citizens tomorrow. 

The Recommendations as Set Forth by Dr. Fine. 

1. Greater financial support of our public schools - 
a minimum expenditure of five per cent of the United States 
national income for education.

2. An increase in salaries of nation’s teachers, 
establishing a minimum salary of $2,400 for all public 
school instructors* 

3* Increased requirements and standards for the 
teaching profession - a minimum of five years of college 
to be required of all elementary and secondary teachers* 

4* Federal aid to education - needly States should 
receive sufficient money from Federal Government to raise 
school standards to national level of $1,600 a classroom 
unit* 


5* Single salary schedule for teachers with equal 
professional training - elementary and secondary school 
teachers should receive equal salaries* 

6. Better working conditions for nation’s teachers 
less extra-curricular or clerical duties, smaller classes 
qnd adequate equipment and supplies. 

7* Adequate tenure and retirement laws - improve 
tenure protection for more than fifty per cent of the 
teachers who are now without tenure* 

8* No community restrictions on personal lives of 
teachers; less meddling by community in way teacher lives 
her own life* 

9. Improvement of teacher training institutions - 
drastic revision of teachers colleges to eliminate poor 
conditions that now exist in many institutions* 

10. Better school buildings essential - right of 
pupils and teachers to attend schools that are decent and 
cheerful* Five billion dollar program needed* 

11* Improve rural schools - inequalities between 
rural and urban schools are a national disgrace. Better 
schools In rural areas immediately essential. 

12* Introduce modern teaching devices and methods - 
too many schools are still teaching along horse and buggy 
methods, seemingly unaware of atomic age. 

13. More teacher participation In school program - 
teachers should be allowed to share in development and 
planning of academic activities of school. 

14. A better recruitment program is necessary - 
schools and colleges must induce their superior students 
to enter the teaching profession.

PART III 


POPULATION TRENDS IN RELATION 
TO 


TEACHER DEMAND 







56 


GROWTH FACTORS 


The need for teachers in Canada as a whole and the Provinces 
individually depends, at any given time, on the number and 
type of children to be taught and the policies under which 
this instruction takes place. The first factor in deter¬ 
mining the relationship between supply and demand is to 
study the elements underlying population growth for the area 
under consideration and to ascertain, within reasonable 
limits, the probable future growth trends• 


It is the purpose of this section to present and analyze 

some of the major sociological and economic factors that 

bear a fundamental relationship to future growth and develop 

ment. The sociological factors that could be considered are 

1* General population tendencies 

2. Female age groups 
5. Marital status of females 

4. Ratio of children to women 

5. Mortality by sex 

6* The school population 

7. The teaching population 

8. The legal educational agencies. 

The economic factors that could be considered include: 

1. Agriculture 

2. Manufacturing 

3. Recreation 

4. Analysis of occupations. 


These will not be discussed neither in that order nor will 
the twelve of them be considered, but I feel that a complete 
study would require their careful consideration*

PROBABLE FUTURE GROWTH 1 
1. The Text 

Numerous cautions are incorporated in the text to prevent a 
misunderstanding of the figures. It should be clearly under¬ 
stood that these projections of population size for Canada 
to 1971 are based on definite assumptions which are clearly 
stated. No allowance is made for offsetting factors such 
as migration or war® , It is assumed in them that both 
mortality and fertility rates in Canada will continue to 
fall and that they will follow a pattern indicated by 
recent trends. If, for example, Canada were to have a large 
immigrant movement, or, if, due to some unforeseen develop¬ 
ment, fertility rates should change, such factors would 
exert influences not Included in the assumptions on which 
the estimates are based, and would produce different 
results « 

The value of population projections lies, not in their 
prophetic qualities, but In their examination of what con¬ 
sequences must ensue If no unforeseen agencies Intervene 
to affect drastically past trends. The projections of 
past trends are valuable in that they suggest possible 
population changes which will affect legislation in the 
fields on housing, educational policy and pensions. 

Population projections are made by taking the nearest

accurately known population and apply to each age group a 
given set of fertility and mortality rates. These can be 
selected in two ways: the use of fertility and mortality 
rates of the time at which the projection is made, or we 
can assume that these rates change in the future in a way 
logically related to their past trends. The firs.t method 
gives a dramatic picture of our future population which 
surely is out of focus because modern history affords us 
no example of such stability over a lengthy period. All 
countries show a decline in both fertility and mortality 
over the past hundred years• In this study all estimates 
are made assuming that both fertility and mortality rates 
will continue to decline. The trend before vital 
statistics in Canada is discussed in Census Bulletin P-1; 
that between 1921 and 1939 is shown in Figure 6, page 
Changes in mortality between 1931 and 1941^ indicate that 
the improvement in mortality has followed much the same 
course as elsewhere. Hence all the estimates are made on 
the assumption that both fertility and mortality rates 
will continue to decline in some way* 

The projections In the study show the population, not as 
it will be from 1940 to 1971, but as it would be under two 
sets of assumptions. There are two sets of estimates: A 
and B on one set of assumptions; C and D on another set*

Eoth sets assume that no migration takes place over the 
Canadian border or between provinces during the period. 

This is necessary because the past gives no basis for 
assuming any consistent trend. 

For estimates A and B, the method devised by Notestein and 
colleagues for projection of European populations was used.^ 
Estimate A is Notestein’s curve for Europe applied to the 
Canadian fertility and mortality rates. The assumption is 
that there will be a fall in Canadian rates similar to 
those of Europe when they were at the levels at which we 
now stand. The last twenty years for Canada shows a moderately 
close correspondence with the rates of fall derived from 
European data. The mortality rates between 1921 and 1941 
fell faster than Notestein ? s curve would indicate, while 
the fertility rate was somewhat slower. The projection of 
Estimate A is to be considered a minimum limit. In Estimate 
B the same process is applied to each province individually 
and gives a higher total for the Dominion that in A, where 
Canada was considered as a unit. 

In Estimates C and D the same assumptions were made but the 
computations were based solely on Canadian experience from 
1931 to 1939. Since this was a period of rapid decline in 
fertility* the projection for Canada as a whole is the same 
as Estimate A, but there are considerable differences in 
provincial rates of fall. There is a larger future popu~

lation in Estimates G and D because Notestein projections 
ignored the effect of World War II on demographic trends* 

The course of Canadian vital trends in wartime makes for 
an under estimate of the numbers of future births^ Hence 
there is an assumption that fertility rates will decline 
from their wartime peak until they reach the 1939- level in 
about 1946® Thereafter they will decline as usual. 

(Figure 6) According to Estimates C and D, therefore, the 
effect of World War II in Canada would be a net gain In 
births® 

Estimates C and D are based on the estimated population of 

o 

June 1, 1944. Because of this the effects of internal 
migration trends during the war year shows in the projections* 
If not too much internal migration takes place, then these 
figures should give relative provincial size fairly well in 
the near future, but thereafter internal population move¬ 
ments may change the picture materially. Provided a con¬ 
tinuance of secular trends in fertility and mortality the 
Estimates C and D will show the upper limits of the popu¬ 
lation in 197J*

European migration after 1900 gave a great impetus to the 
population of Canada. (Fig* 1)* After 1931, with the

continued to grow, but at a rate which is becoming pro¬ 
gressively smaller. Thus the decennial rate of increase 
which was thirty-four per cent and twenty-two per cent in 
the expanding period 1901-1921 was less than eleven per 
cent in the last census period 1931-1941. 1 Estimate B 
assumes the same rate of increase in 1941-41 and Estimate 
D a slightly higher rate, but with both the assumed trends 
in fertility and mortality the rate of increase will con¬ 
tinue to decline and the population will reach a maximum 
by the end of the century. Thereafter it will decline 
slowly. The maximum will be about fiften millions around 
1990. 

The total populations according to Estimates B and D are 
shown in Figure 1. When war-time trends are taken into 
account* Estimate D shows a continued upward trend which 
should reach an upper limit in the last decade of the 
century. Estimate B, on the other hand, shows an upward 
trend that begins to flatten out perceptibly after 1961. 
The increases of population will continue to become pro¬ 
gressively smaller in the near future even without any 
further decline in fertility, for the population is aging 
as a result of declining fertility in the past and this 
means more deaths and fewer births. 

In Figure 2 the change in age structure between the 1941 
and 1971 is shown for Estimate B. Estimate D would show

an age structure similar in the older ages but with larger 
numbers in the ages 0-29* Both show a decrease in the number 
of births and children to age fourteen© 

In spite of a favorable age structure, a continuation of past 
trends would lead to a net reproduction rate falling below 
unity about 1950 to 1955, and hence to an ultimately de¬ 
clining population. This suggests that social action 
directed to stabilizing family size at an adequate level 
for a stationary or moderately increasing population would 
have more chance of success in the next ten to fifteen years 
than at a later period when fertility rates may have fallen 
below the desired level© 

The rate of increase in numbers for Canada as a whole does 
not represent the trend in the provinces separately© 

Cultural and economic differences influence birth and death 
rates and the resultant populations vary in size and age 
structure© The proximity of the frontier period in Canadian 
history has affected the trends in population for the various 
provinces© Nevertheless, by 1941 the decennial increase was 
fairly similar for all. ^ In the older regions, growth since 
1901 has been reasonably consistent although the Maritime 
region has varied considerably. Before 1931, Prince Edward 
Island shows an undulatory trend with a decrease in popu¬ 
lation which reached its largest amount between 1901 and 
1911. Nova Scotia shows a growth which became progressively

smaller until 1901, and then rose in the subsequent two 
decades. In the 1921-31 period it shows a loss. The New 
Brunswick trend has been similar to that in Nova Scotia, 
although in no decade does it show population loss. The 
region as a whole shows a population increase in the 1931-41 
period which, it has been suggested, was due to lack of 
inducement to migrate during the depression years.^ The 
population of Quebec, 1901-31, increased at a fairly 
constant rate, and the same was true for Ontario. The 
greater increase occurred in Quebec. In the 1931-41 
period, both show a small increase, that in Ontario falling 
faster than that in Quebec. 

The Western provinces, which were affected most by the 

immigrant surge after 1901, show trends similar to the 

older regions in the 1931-41 period. Manitoba received 

its greatest increment of growth in the late nineteenth 

century, and since then the population increase has fallen

until in 1931-41 its numbers increased only 4.2 per cent. 
Saskatchewan and Alberta shown an even greater decline, the 
total population in Saskatchewan having decreased In the 
1931-41 period by nearly three per cent. Both Manitoba and 
Alberta show increases In population which are lower than 
their natural increase. In all three the declining growth 
appears to be the result of the depression, the prolonged

drought, and immigration to Ontario and British Columbia* 
Though British Columbia, like the rest of the west, shows 
both a numerical and percentage increase in 1931-41 lower 
than that of the preceding decade, its percentage increase 
is larger than any other region in Canada, being 17.8 per 
cent - nearly two per cent greater than the next, highest, 
Quebec* This is mostly due to migration from the Prairies* 

As has been said, and from the graph, the Canadian population 
appears to have been growing less rapidly in every decade 
after 1911. With the exception of the Maritimes, the sepa¬ 
rate regions have shown a similar trend* It must be 
remembered that projections for individual provinces are of 
a highly tentative nature, for it is impossible to make any 
probably estimate of internal migration in the post-war 
period. The effects of internal migration upon provincial 
populations for the period 1941-44 may be seen If the 
population size for each province (according to Estimates 
B and D) are compared by decade for all age groups* 

According to the projections for Estimate D, the first 
province to reach its maximum population is British Columbia. 
Accounting for about seven per cent of the population of 
the Dominion It should reach Its maximum about 1960. With 
the lowest fertility rate, it is in an unfavorable position 
for future growth. The increase in population over the 
whole period 1941-1971 is twenty-one per cent, which is 
higher than that for Ontario, Manitoba and Saskatchewan* 
According to Estimate B, British Columbia reaches its

maximum population after 1951 and declines in the 1961-71 
period by nearly three per cent. In the whole period* 
1941-1971, the increase in population is only 1.5 per cent. 

It must be remembered that Estimate B assumes no internal 
migration after 1941 and hence does not take into account 
the industrial expansion on the west coast which.the war 
engendered* 

Ontario, with the next lowest fertility rates. Is the first 
province after British Columbia to reach its maximum popu¬ 
lation. Estimate B suggests that this will occur by 1961. 

In the whole period 1941-1971 the percentage increase is 
9.3. Estimate D shows a population which continues to 
increase after 1971, although the trend suggests that the 
turning point will be reached soon after that. In the period 
1941-71 the per centage increase of population is 15.7, the 
lowest increase for all the provinces, and less than half 
the increase for Quebec. The population positions for 
Quebec and Ontario are reversed by 1971. Fertility rates 
fall more rapidly in Quebec than any other province for 
the period. The early decline in the birth rate in Ontario 
places it in an unfavorable position for future growth, 
while the fall of the Quebec rate does not reach the Ontario 
level of 1920 until 1940. Because of the difference in 
demographic position, Quebec by 1960 will have a population 
nearly equal to that of Ontario and after that time will 
increase In size somewhat above that of Ontario. Neverthe¬ 
less in both Estimates B and D, Quebec is approaching a

turning point in population, the percentage increase in the 
1941-51 period of fifteen per cent falling in the 1961-71 
to six per cent for Estimate B, and from seventeen per cent 
to eight per cent for Estimate D. If fertility were to 
continue to decline in the future as in the past then the 
population of both provinces would ultimately decline at 
approximately the same rate* 

A similar trend to that of Quebec is shown for the Maritimes. 
Growth continues in the three Maritimes to 1971 but it does 
so at a slower rate for each subsequent decade. For the 
region as a whole the percentage increase drops from thirteen 
per cent in the 1941-1951 period to seven per cent in the 
1961-1971 period by Estimate B. Extimate D shows a drop 
from 13*5 per cent to 9*5 per cent for the same period* 

The population trends in the prairie region suggests that 
a declining population will be reached sooner than in Quebec 
or the Maritimes. Estimate B shows an increase of twenty- 
four per cent over the total population in 1941, When the 
exodus of workers in the 1941-44 period is taken into 
account. Estimate D shows that the percentage increase falls 
to twenty-two per cent* 

According to the rates of fall assumed up to 1971 In Esti¬ 
mate B, no province, could, at that time, expect an increasing 
population far into the future* According to Estimate D, 
Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick would still have 
increasing populations In 1971 If no further fall in 
fertility occurs* Regional differences in population growth

are illustrated for Estimate D in Figure 3. In 1941 the 
largest population was concentrated in Ontario. By 1961 
Ontario and Quebec should have equal populations although 
both increase throughout the period. By 1971 Quebec shows 
a greater population than Ontario. In terms of percentages 
of the Canadian population, Quebec increases from twenty- 
nine per cent in 1941 to thirty-two per cent in 1971, 
while Ontario decreases from thirty-three per cent in 1941 
to thirty per cent in 1971. Despite growth, the proportions 
in the Prairies and the Mari times remain almost constant; 
the proportion for the Prairies is one per cent less and 
the Maritimes one per cent more by 1971. British Columbia 
with almost constant population would show a decline of 
well over one per cent by 1971. 

Figure 7 on the next page shows graphically the discussion 
on the last few pages as well as Table II on page 

3. The School Population 

One of the chief functions of population projections lies 
in their attempt to suggest, on the basis of past trends, 
the changes in the proportion of the population which will 
be affected by specific economic and social conditions and 
by particular forms of government activity. For instance, 
if on the basis of the projections, the proportion of 
children in the total population falls over a period of 
a generation, then, providing the assumption upon which 
the projections are based have validity, social organizations

can plan to divert expenditure on 

buildings, staff 


etc,, necessary for Increasing numbers, into improvements 
of existing standards. Similarly the prediction of an 
Increasing proportion of old people implies a growing need

for medical services, for hospitalization, and for an 
expansion of governmental aid in the forms of social security 
and pensions. Population projections suggest future 
situations for which adjustments and new provisions may be 
necessary. (Table IV and Figures 5, 6, 7). 

The definition of the school population as that group 
between the ages of five and nineteen years, can in the 
general sense, set the limits of grade school education. 

That such a definition gives an upper limit which includes 
the early years of university education is realized, but the 
five year age groups in which the projections were computed 
prevent a more detailed break-down. At the same time, the 
proportion of youth in school between the ages of six and 
nineteen is over ten per cent of the population for each 
age within its group; the proportion of youth in school 
after nineteen falls quickly.^- The age group 5-19 has been 
further divided into two groups? 5-14 and 15-19. The former 
may be considered as defining the limits of elementary 
school education and the latter is composed chiefly of the 
secondary school group. Here again no accurate dis¬ 
tinction can be made to separate the two groups. Never¬ 
theless such a division will show in a general way the 
demographic problems which should be considered if changes 
in education policy be planned in the next thirty years* 

The youth projections for Estimates B and D are given in

Table IV for Canada as a whole and by regions, together 
with the amount and percentage change for the period. 

The trends for Canada as a whole are shown graphically in 
Figure 5. The projection for Estimate B suggests a rise in 
the numbers 5-14 years in 1951 and a slow decline after 
that time. By 1971, if fertility continues to decline, the 
number of children in elementary schools should be about 
eighty-five per cent of the 1941 group. On the basis of 
Estimate D, the 5-14 year group increases to 1951, remains 
almost constant in the subsequent ten-year period and by 
1971 falls just below its 1941 level. The decrease over 
the whole period would be about five per cent. The pro¬ 
portion of people in the 15-19 year group fluctuates 
through the 1941-71 period, but on the whole the total 
number remains fairly constant. By Estimate B the 1971 
level is about twelve per cent lower than the 1941; by 
Estimate D, it decreases less than one per cent. 

The differences in regional trends are also shown in Table 
IV. By Estimate B, British Columbia and Ontario show the 
greatest decline in the school age population for the 
period 1941-71. Except for the age group 15-19 years in 
the Maritimes, which shows an increase of 2.6 per cent by 
1971 over the 1941 total, the other regions also show some 
decline. On the basis of Estimate D, both the Maritimes 
and Quebec show an increase over the period. In the case 
of Quebec the increase for the age group 5-14 years is

less than two per cent. In both, the trend shows a fall 
from the 1961 total. The other regions all show some 
decline for the period. 

We may conclude that on the basis of either estimate there 
is no reason to assume much change in the proportions of 
the school population for the next thirty years. If the 
continued decline in fertility assumed in these estimates 
(see Figure 5) does in fact take place, then the period 
would appear to be the turning point in the use of 
elementary and secondary educational facilities. After 
1970 the effects of fertility decline would lead to a 
smaller school population. This is particularly true of 
the elementary group which shows evidence of decline as 
early as 1961 (Figure 5). For this age group, the oppor¬ 
tunity will arise to divert resources no longer needed to 
take care of an increasing population to present-day 
standards of efficiency. This suggestion refers only to 
the over-all picture. Internal population movements may 
lead to empty schools in one district, while in another 
they are crammed beyond capacity. If opportunities for 
higher education continue to be extended to an increasing 
proportion of the population, in line with the trend of 
recent years, the demand for greater facilities on this 
account will outweight any possible effect of demographic 
change•

FAMILY SIZE IN CANADA 

On© way of looking at time changes is to consider marriages 
taking place at successive dates. In the figure on the 
next page^” the size of family of women marrying at different 
ages is plotted on a time scale showing the dates at which 
the marriages took place. The scale is semi-logarithmic 
so that the slope of the lines indicates proportionate 
decreases. The relative rates of decline of different 
marriage-age groups is quite apparent* 

Another point or two worth noting is that from a long-term 
standpoint* increased prosperity and rising standards of 
living are almost invariably associated with smaller 
families. "The rich get richer and the poor get children" 
is an old familiar saw which explains the situation nicely. 
Over a short period, alternations of prosperity and de¬ 
pression operating chiefly through the changes in marriage 
rate, produce superimposed short cyles in vhich the birth 
rate rises in prosperous times and falls during depressions. 
The accentuated decline in fertility in the Prairies in 
the thirties, though in part a short-term effect of the 
depression, was In part a result of the preceding period of 
prosperity. 

Rural and Urban Families 

Urban families are generally smaller than neighboring 
rural families, and families in the large cities usually

Figure 9 shows the rural family larger than the urban, which 
in turn is larger than the metropolitan one. This is true 
for all age groups regardless of whether they have com¬ 
pleted their family or not. The family decreases regularly 
as size of community increases. 

With one or two variations, the graduation shown in size of 
family from rural through different urban groups to metro¬ 
politan cities is seen in the provinces taken separately. 
(Figure 10). The differences are least in British Columbia 
and Nova Scotia as these are highly urbanized provinces.

each in its own way* Fertility in the large cities does not 
show any clear graduation with size* except that in each 
province the metropolitan family is smaller than than in 
the city group. Size of the city and density of population 
are not the only factors determining the size of the urban 
f ami ly • 

By 1941* thirty-two per cent of Canada T s population dwelt 
in the twelve largest cities. Another indication of growth 
in the cities is found in an increase in the number of 
cities with populations of 50,000 or more from 11 to 15

A very direct implication of this trend of more people living 
in cities as time goes on is that the newcomers typically 
assume the city rates of fertility. 


Age at marriage clearly plays a major role In determining 
the ultimate size of the family. Only the earlier marrying 
groups are of much significance. Even in the most fertile 
regions, women marrying after thirty-five do not have 
enough children to replace themselves*

When the three components, age at marriage, province, rural 
and urban size groups, are compared for women 45-54 years, 
age at marriage, as one might expect, stands out as the 
most important source of variation. 

A comparison of the provinces reveals one or two points of 
interest. When women marrying at the same age and married 
for the same length of time are compared, the largest size 
of family among marriages of less than twenty years 1 
duration is most often found in Prince Edward Island. The 
smallest size of family is usually found in Toronto, but 
for similar age at marriage and duration of marriage, family 
size in the three Metropolitan Areas of Toronto, Winnipeg, 
and Vancouver, is practically identical. In the Montreal 
Metropolitan Area it is somewhat higher but still smaller 
than most of the provincial figures. 

One of the many affects of the World War II is the change 
in the marriage rates. The actual number of marriages is 
indicated in Table VII and graphed in Figure 13. This 
figure shows the average of the 1921-1940 period with the 
terrific upsurge in marriages during the war. It does 
not include the 43,454 marriages of service personnel 
overseas® 

The five yearsl940-1944 with the very high marriage rate 
of chiefly young people simply means a deluge of Grade I 
starting in 1946 and tapering off towards normal in the 
mid-fifties» This bulge will move through the grades

with decreasing intensity until the late sixties. By that 
time things will be back to normal again, but at a higher 
level. This great increase through the grades must be 
planned for, both in terms of buildings and teacher per¬ 
sonnel of varying kinds to meet the needs of this group 
from year to year as it progresses from grade to grade. 
This point will be discussed later® 

Table IX and Figure 14 dealing with the Ratio of Children 
Under Five to the Female Population shows two or three 
interesting points. The heavy immigration in the early 
years of the century set back for twenty-five years the 
downward trend. The second but lesser peak, caused by 
the increased marriage rate of the war years, will hold 
off the downward swing for ten to fifteen years. The 
third peak is not shown as immigration in the projection 
is not considered, but I have shown the trend in Figure 


Another way of showing the decline of the birth rate is 
to consider the proportion of youth to the total popu¬ 
lation. One must be always on guard and realize that 
though the proportion is decreasing, the total population 
is increasing and the actual number of children we have 
to deal with is on the increase.

Prom the above table Robbins calculates that for each seven 
older persons (over twenty-five) there are only about six 
younger today, whereas thirty years ago, in 1911, there 
were eight, and sixty years ago there were more than ten. 

The decline in the proportion of young persons has important 
implications. It has become easier to extend the length 
of their schooling and to give them other advantages. There 
is also an element of disadvantage to the children, akin to 
that of the child of the over-solicitous parents, in that 
they are not allowed to n grow up#” As they have come to 
the working age In the more recent decades (the war years 
excepted) they have found fewer and fewer ready-made jobs 
waiting to be filled, and many have remained in school not 
by choice of either themselves or their elders, but simply

for want of employment opportunities. 

The numerical relationship of young people to older differs 
considerably between different parts of the Dominion, They 
are relatively more numerous in country than in city, 
especially children. During youth many move from country to 
city.

Table XII above shows that approximately fifty-one per cent 
of children of ages 10- 14 years live in rural comuni ties. 

In the 15-19 group fewer than forty-eight per cent are there 
and this in the 20-24 the per cent drops to forty-three, 
and at ages 25-29 only forty-one per cent. This means, 
roughly, that one of every five country young people has 
migrated to the towns and cities (one girl in four - one

IMMIGRATION 

In 1851 the population of Upper and Lower Canada, Nova 
Scotia, and New Brunswick totalled 2,312,919 and in 1941 
the population of the Dominion was 11,506,655. During 
that period no fewer than 6,703,891 persons were admitted 
as immigrants, not all of whom stayed in the Dominion, for 
numbers eventually found their way to the United States 
while others returned to the land of their birth. 

The War of 1959-45 did not affect Immigration to the same 
relative extent as did the War of 1914-18. The year 1913 
witnessed the greatest immigration in Canada*s history, as 
400,870 persons were admitted; the greatest number during 
a war year was 72,910 in 1917* At the outbreak of war in 
1939 Canada had been going though a period of restricted 
immigration and the figures showed a decrease each year 
from 1939 to 1942. However, the trend changed during 1943 
and the number of Immigrants admitted in 1945 showed an 
increase of thirty-two per cent over 1938. The reason for 
this Increase lies In the movement to Canada of dependents 
of the armed forces and not to any fundamental change in 
immigration policy* 

The wide fluctuations in the immigration movements since 
1891 are shown in the following table. The heavy movement 
between 1902 and 1914 was severely cut down between 1915

In January, 1942, provision was made to furnish the de¬ 
pendents of members of the Armed Forces serving overseas 
with free transportation from their home in the country of 
residence to destination in Canada* The term dependent means 
”the wife or widow of a member of the Forces who was married 
to such member while the latter was serving outside of Canada 
during the War of 1939-45, and also the children of such 
member of the Forces*” By Order in Council dated September 
21, 1944, dependents, immediately on their admission to 
Canada, acquire the same immigration status as the head of 
the family* 


From 1942 to 1944, 5,321 dependents comprising 3,319 adults 
and 2,002 children were admitted to Canada, During 1945, 
10,677 dependents were admitted; of this number, 6,972 were 
adults and 3,705 children. 


On March 2, 1948, the curtain fell on "Operation War Bride”

with the docking of the Aquitania at Halifax. The arrival 
of this last group brings to 64,451 the number of dependents 
of servicemen immigrating to the Dominion since the beginning 
of the Second Great War* Of this total, 20,997 were children 
and 43,454 were wives® 

In the light of previous discussions of this group, con¬ 
sidering the age at marriage, the change in standards of 
living, the fertility rate, the divorce rate, etc., should 
produce at least another 30,000 to 35,000 children. This

The table dealing with "Operations War Bride" is a closed book* We can 
expect no more immigration from that quarter* The number coming to ©ur 
country as tabulated in Tables 16 and 17 is quit© problematic, 

Holland has senr the first of 10,000 scheduled to emigrate in 194® and 
are planning an estimated 20,000 for 1949, The first group of 750 
has 200 children less than twelve years old. Some of the families have 
up to twelve children I This type ©f immigrant will swell ©ur school 
population® The Netherlands Foundation for Emigration plan some thir¬ 
teen shipments of ©migrants this year —« 194®. 

Ontario has just finished its contract with T.C.A, bringing the last of 
7000 imigrants, The Hon, How© states the Dominion Government will take 
over the future air«borne immigration, Alberta is anxious to bring in 
industrial imigsants — some ar# already on the way (April 10 1 1948,) 

It is stated in the House of Commons on April 7, 194® that the 3 ,472 
displaced persons brought to Canada for the lumber industry in the last 
nine months have been absorbed. Another article states that by May 
1948 there will b© 22,000 persons from European displaced persons camps 
admitted to Canady, most of them of Slavic stock originating in countries 
now ruled by Communist governments subservient to Moscow,

The first arrivals of displaced persons from Europe for work 
in southern Alberta sugar beet fields will b© about May 15, 
1948. This groups is expected to comprise 150 single workers, 
and 60 family groups making up approximately 180 persons. 

The federal government said 60 D. P. families and 550 single 
men will be brought out later for sugar beet farms in 
Manitoba and Alberta. The federal government has very 
lately raised the number of D. P.’s from 20,000 to 30,000 
to be admitted by March, 1949. One wishing the services 
of a D. P. makes application on forms which may be secured 
from National Employment offices and from district agri¬ 
culturists. The conditions in the applicant’s home will be 
investigated by home economists. Female help will get 
$35.00 a month. 

Ottawa has just announced that 10,000 Britons will be flown 
by Trans-Canada Airlines to Canada in 1948. 

Every week finds articles in our daily papers concerning the 
admission of immigrants. A likely guess would be 100,000 
coming to Canada. Figure 15, page 99, shows 400,000 just 
before World War I. With the political situation in Europe 
as it is today little wonder they are trying to get out by 
the thousands. What will this 20,000 to 30,000 children of 
these immigrants do to our already creaking educational 
system? Where are the extra 600 to 700 teachers per year 
coming from to look after this influx to say nothing of 
the natural increase of our own people?

There will be redistribution of population in Canada and 
throughout the world for the next several years. The numbers 
involved will depend on conditions at the time and policies 
with respect to migration. Many people who would like to 
move will lack the necessary means. Others will be restricted 
by quotas. Nor can immigration policies be formulated with¬ 
out consideration of the population which can be supported# 


THE ECONOMIC SIDE 

Elliott in "The Supply of and Demand for Teachers in 
Michigan" suggests that a study of the economic picture 
would give a reasonable basis from which to attack the 
teacher shortage problem. The more widely I read the more 
strongly am I convinced that if we had money for education 
in proportion to its fundamental importance* our problem 
of supply would not exist. We then could make a selection 
of the better trainees and allow them to graduate# 

"In the eighty years since the original provinces in Canada 
became a confederation* the foreign trade of Canada has 
shown an amazing growth. Between July 1st* 1867* and June 
30th, 1868* Canada f s imports and exports totalled 
$120*000,000 or $34. for every man* woman* and child in 
the country.Canadian trade in 1946 was valued at 
$4*240*000*000* which is eleven times as great on a per 
capita basis* and thirty-seven times as great in actual

dollar value# 

Canada as a world trade Is exceeded only by the United States 
and the United Kingdom# She is now the third ranking 
country of the world in the volume of goods that crosses her 
borders annually# Canada with only one-half of one per cent 
of the world's population does seven per cent of the world's 
trade # 

The dominant position of the United States in Canadian trade 
is what one might expect from close and friendly relations 
with a great industrial neighbor. The high volume of trade 
with the United Kingdom is due to the complementary nature 
of the two economies, the traditional ties of Empire, and 
the long history of trade between the two. These two share 
about seventy-five per cent of total Canadian trade with an 
ever increasing proportion with the United States. The two 
following graphs show the external commodity trade of Canada, 
exclusive of gold, for 1939-1947 with average for base 
period from 1935-1939, and Canadian trade with the United 
States for 1939-1947# Shipments financed by credits and 
HURRA are expanding temporarily the volume of exports to 
other countries# 

Perhaps the best single index of our expansion is obtained 
from total income produced# Figure IS plots the national 
income for Canada from 1911 to 1944. The dotted line shows 
the income adjusted to make allowances for changes in pur¬ 
chasing value of the dollar.

This group of four 
charts shows the strong 
and increasing position 
of Canada as a world 
trader, the ever in¬ 
creasing trade with 
the United States, and 
the strong upswing in 
the national income 
of Canada. These are 
tied nicely together 
in the fourth chart 
showing increase in 
per capita income. If 
Canada Is such a rapid¬ 
ly developing country 
with such world trad® 
and personal income, 
then it is high time 
she began to look after 
her most important

Figures 17, 18, and 19 are brought into sharp focus by the 

Dominion Bureau of Statistics* news release from Ottawa on 

the 

April 15, 1948. During 1947/Canadian farmer*s cash income 
from the sale of farm products reached a record high of 
#1,991,000,000.00, about fourteen per cent higher than in 
1946. Fanners in Alberta received the sharpest increase, 
over twenty per cent, but they were closely followed by 
farmers in Quebec and Onferio with increases of seventeen 
and sixteen per cent respectively. All other provinces 
showed gains from about seven to ten per cent, except Nova 
Scotia where farm income was slightly lower than in 1946. 

Cash income from the sale of farm products in the western 
provinces were as follows: Alberta #285,000,000 in 1946 
as against #345,000,000 in 1947; Manitoba #171,000,000 
in 1946 as compared with #186,000,000 in 1947; Saskatchewan, 
#399,000,000 in 1946 as compared with #434,000,000 in 1947. 
British Columbia farm income rose from #86,000,000 to 
#93,000,000 in the same period. Ontario’s cash income 
jumped from #473,000,000 in 1946 to #546,000,000 in 1947. 
"The gain in cash farm income can be attributed to higher 
prices, an increase in payments on wheat participation 
certificates and a small reduction in farm inventories. 1 *

PART IV 


THE DEMAND FOR TEACHERS 





109 


THE DEMAND FOR TEACHERS 

The need for teachers depends on the number of children to 
be taught, which of course depends on the total population* 
Figure 1 on page 61 shows the population trend in Canada* 

Table II on page 67 gives the figures for it* Table III 
on page 73 shows a decided increase in 1946 over the 1936-40 
average* If we are short of teachers now, then by 1951 
with an increase of 171,000 children in the 5-14 year old 
group, the shortage will be much more acute unless a decided 
increase in the numbers trained takes place. (See TableXXXVI) 
These changes ar© shown in Figure 5, page 77* This means, 
roughly 5,700 more teachers will be needed by 1951 for this 
age group. By 1961 there is a slight downward change of 
0.7^ leaving a need of 5,200 more teachers than required 
in 1941. By 1961 the high school potential population has 
risen 191,000* Granted all will not go on (Table XVIII) 
but definite provisions must be made for at least 5,000 
more high school rooms and the qualified staff as well# 

Considering Tables VII and VIII on page 89 with Figure 13 
on page 90 and Figure 8 on page 82 there is small wonder 
we will need 5,700 more teachers* To add to the figure 
we must consider immigration which was not taken into 
account. Tables XV, XVI, and XVII add to this figure 
another 50,000 children for 1948-49 or 100,000 by September 
1951 which means another 3,300 teachers making the total 
of 9,000 teachers above the 1941 figure.

Demand is governed also by the holding power of the grades. 
Table XVIII developed from questionnaire M-15 shows the 
gradual loss through the grades. The point of interest 
here is the great increase in the number who are now going 
through high school as compared to the number in 1950. 

Table XIX is worked out as a per cent of the Grad© V popu¬ 
lation® This increase accounts for a strong demand for 
well qualified teachers. If the trend continues there will 
be about seventy-five per cent of the students attempting 
to reach Grade XII.

The trends shown in Figure 20 are quite clear and unmistakable* 
The tapering off of the areas in the lower portion of the 
chart reflects the decrease in the proportion of persons who 
receive only elementary school education. The one at the 
bottom for those of the 0 to 3 years schooling gives a rough 
picture of the liquidation of illiteracy. The widening bands 
in the upper portion reflect the growth of educational 
achievement at the high school and college levels. 

A few interrelations of the trend are of interest. The small 
humps near the left (in the areas representing 0 to 6 years 
of education among the older population) probably reflect 
the period of heavy immigration in the early part of this 
century when large numbers of foreign born with relatively 
small amounts of education entered the country. The fairly 
marked flattening in the college class among the younger 
population undoubtedly reflects the effects of the depression 
when fewer people could afford college. The flaring in the 
areas representing the high school level indicates that 
during the depression many young people went to high school 
who would not have done so if they could have obtained jobs. 

The pattern shown for the United States represents quite 
well, the situation as we would find it, if at the time of 
the census, each individual was asked the highest grade of 
school completed. This was done but the results were re¬ 
corded as median years of schooling. 1

The holding power of the grades is shown in Table XXI 
developed from M-15. Here are fifteen selected cities with 
their school population 1930 and 1947. The lower grades 
show a loss over 1930 (see Figure 5 page 77) but the high 
school grades show a gain. The point here is, even though 
there is a loss for the whole group of two per cent in total 
they require an Increase of 9.77 per cent teaching staff. 
Table XXII with another selection of cities show similar 
results. This will account In part for some of the teacher 
shortage. The larger cities with smaller school popu¬ 
lations are requiring more teachers, due to the trend to 
more schooling for all. Table XXXII shows the holding 
power. Read across the Grade 10, 11, 12 and 13 row and 
notice the increase since 1930.

The demand for teachers increases as the size of the class 
decreases* There is a marked trend in teacher load as shown 
in Table XXIV, and if it continues to the much-talked-of 
twenty-five pupils per teacher it simply means a greater 
demand for teachers for the same number of pupils. Part 
of our present shortage is due to the larger cities, with 
more money, decreasing the teacher load. 

Table XXV shows also the teacher-pupil ratio for the 
Dominion as a whole* Part of this picture is caused by the 
fact that the school population has been gradually dropping 
with the same number of rooms kept open, and part, too, is 
due to th© change in educational philosophy* 

There is a public demand for an expanding program. The 
school boards are aware of the situation as indicated by 
their answer in Table XXVII. They indicate 46 to 4 to 
decrease the size of the class to 25-30 pupils per room. 

The boards realize the teaching load at the high school 
level is too great, and vote 39 to 8 to decrease it. Both 
of these require more rooms and more teachers, thus Increas¬ 
ing the demand. The boards are willing to give sabbatical 
leave for study and travel. This means more teachers needed. 
Twenty-five cities reporting state that 141 teachers are 
on leave to study. For the Dominion this means about 500 
teachers are needed yearly to take the place of those who 
are studying. The boards are willing to expand their 
educational offerings already established by a vote of 43 


to 2

The boards are prepared to expand their programs into new 
fields as indicated by M-6(e). These are new to some systems 
but not to others who are expanding very rapidly in the 
last year or two, as a study of Table XXVIII shows. This 
table gives an increase of 231 teachers in special classes 
in 1947 over 1946, for the few cities reporting* This ex¬ 
pansion of the larger cities means fewer teachers for the 
regular class room. This is reflected in a greater short¬ 
age, To make the point In question more forceful one of 
these expanding areas Is treated separately. Table XXIX 
shows kindergarten development for twenty-five cities in 
1947, There are 18,898 children or 630 teachers if we 
allow thirty pupils per teacher. This is an Increase of 
79 teachers for this field only, and that from so few 
cities. Others areas of expansion are shown in Table XXX, 

In all, it would appear that the cities are willing and 
ready to expand their educational systems to give to the 
boys and girls greater educational opportunities, both to 
the average and to the retarded, and to those with physical 
handicaps, such as seeing, hearing, and speaking diffi¬ 


culties

The demand for more teachers comes also from withdrawals* 
An analysis of this problem showing some of the factors 
bearing on the question is given in Table XXXI* an answer 
to M-4* Marriage seems to be the largest single reason 
for withdrawal* Retirement takes quite a number each 
year. A third of those leaving the profession offer 


no reason

PART V 


THE SUPPLY OF TEACHERS 





127 - 


THE SUPPLY OF TEACHERS 

Generally, when one is considering the possibilities of a 
certain occupation, one weights the advantages and dis¬ 
advantages, such as the hours of work, the rate of pay, 
the holidays, the pension, the possibility of advancement 
and so forth* 

Table XXXII sets out some of the main reasons for and 
against teaching. Throughout the questionnaires the question 
of financial returns looms up time and again and proves to 
be the main factor in all our troubles* 

The High School students were asked, "If you had the oppor¬ 
tunity would you train for the teaching profession?" Only 
one-third indicated they would and stated their reasons. 

These are set out in Table XXXIII. The two-thirds showing 
non-preference gave their reasons In the main as lack of 
aptitude and lack of pay. 

Table XXXIV shows that the great majority who are in training 
are there because they like young people and feel they have 
the abilities, aptitudes and interests that are demanded In 
this vocation. This natural selection factor should be 
strengthened by tests picking out those who would have a 
good chance to succeed and so remain in the profession® 

The question was also asked in F-17 of the teachers In 
training "How long do you intend to stay in the teaching 
profession?” The answers are tabulated in Table XXXV. It

Even though 95 per cent indicate they like children and 57 per 
cent feel they have the interests and abilities required in 
the teaching profession (Table XXXIV) there are still great 
numbers who are not successful. The teachers in service 
Indicate in Table XXXVI that the two main causes of failure 
are personality defects and lack of purpose or drive. With 
a proper selection this loss to the profession could be 
avoided. 

School Boards when making appointments rank personality at 
the top of the factors considered. Other factors are shown 
in Table XXXVII. It is interesting to note the marked 
agreement on points considered important and not important 
by the city superintendents and school boards across Canada. 

Table XXXVIII is a very important summary of pertinent 
information received from the provincial Departments of 
Education. It has been indicated before (Table XXI and 
Table XXII) that though the school population had decreased 
there was a greater need for teachers. The first part of 
this table shows the number of classrooms that should be in 
operation. This has increased a little over ten per cent 
in fifteen years with protestant Quebec the only one to 
show a decrease. 

A second important section of the table indicates the total 
number of teachers trained in tthe ten year period ending 
August, 1947. The figures reveal the fact that we train 
enough teachers every eleven years to replace the total

teaching population of Canada. Compare this with the state¬ 
ment of findings as given on page 40. This would appear to 
be the natural and accepted state of affairs in the teaching 
profession. 

This also means that one out of ten teachers is a "new” 
teacher in the class room each year and since most of them 
get their first two or three years* experience in the country, 
moving from school to school, the rural child is always getting 
an inferior education. 

Table XXXVIII shows also the estimated teacher shortage.by 
departmental officials. It Indicates that five-sixths of 
the shortage Is In rural areas. 

The next section of the table Indicates the number of 
certificates granted to students with various amounts of 
academic training. These figures are used for Table XXXIX. 

It f s a sad commentary on education when we allow a child 
with a Grade X standing and probably six to eight weeks of 
professional training 11 to try to mold the character of 
our nation. The 200 per cent increase in certificates granted 
is one of the factors lowering the prestige of the teaching 
profession. The gain of 1418.29 per cent in the number of 
permits granted is phenomenal. No wonder the business man 
says education should raise its standards. The 76.59 per 
cent gain In the group with Grade XII education is encouraging 
and a step in the right direction.

the professional and academic training of the teachers now 

on staff* Rows 6-7-8 under column (a) and (b) indicate 

the teachers with inadequate academic and professional training. 

Of the 57,338 teachers reported on in this table there are 
28,085 in this red block. This represents 48.98 per cent of 
the teachers in seven provinces, Ontario and Alberta not 
reporting* 

Row 5, column (a) and (b) shows the number with Grade XII 
standing and less than a year professional training to be 
16,712 teachers or 29.14 per cent of the total reporting. 

Rows 1-2-3-4 under columns (a) and (b) have a total of 7,602 
or 15.26 per cent. This means that only 13.26 per cent of 
our present teachers have some university work and less than 
twelve months of professional training. 

Rows 1-2-3-4 under columns (c) and (d) Indicate the number 
of teachers with one to 4 years university and twelve to

Table XLI shows what qualifications the teachers of Canada 
have. Table XLII and XLIII set out the desirable minimum 
requirements for academic and professional training. The 
gap between what we have and are getting and what the 
teachers in service set as a minimum is indeed very wide* 

Table XLIV sets out in per cent minimum requirements, both 
academic and professional suggested by the teachers in 
service* They apparently realize their training is not 
enough for the type of service they are expected to render. 
These four tables indicate that 60*26 of the teachers state 
that Grade XII is a minimum education* In Canada 48.98 per 
cent of the teachers have a Grade XI standing or less*

training.

PART VI 


TURNOVER IN THE TEACHING PROFESSION 




146 


TURNOVER IN THE TEACHING PROFESSION 

The teaching profession suffers from a very rapid turnover* 

No other profession has the preponderance of females that 
this profession has. Until teaching can attract and hold 
more males the profession will always b© plagued with a 
high rate of turnover. Table XLV gives the number of males 
and females in eight provinces. To this could be added the 
total for Quebec as shown Table XL, page 2, giving the 
number of teachers in Canada over 80,000. Tables XXXIX 
and XL give the number of certificates issued in 1947 to 
all types of academic standing as 8,213. This is approxi¬ 
mately ten per cent of the total teaching population. This 
is a ten per cent turnover. In the Dominion as a whole the 
ratio of men to women for 1945 was 1:3.9 and for 1946 it 
was 1:3.31. This slight improvement was due to veterans 
re-entering the profession. Of the some 5,000 who joined 
the armed forces there are now 2,000 back in the profession. 

The answers on Jk-2 (see appendix) clearly indicate they 
will not return to the low social and economic level that 
Is the lot of the teacher. 

Table XLVIII shows the position of the city, with its higher 
schedule and less community Interference in one 1 s life, to 
be more favorably placed regarding the ratio of men to women. 

As the ratio comes closer to one the turnover decreases. 

Only two Canadian cities, Vancouver and London, are approaching 
the ratio which gives a more stable teaching personnel.

Far too many enter the teaching profession with no intention 
to remain* Others enter to have something to do while waiting 
for a better opening. Table XXV indicates that 36*4 per cent 
had no intention of making it a Xife ! s work* 

Many who would like to stay are forced to withdraw probably 
because of the low rate of pay. Table XLIX, Row 6, column 
(f) and (g) shows a loss of twenty-five per cent in one year. 
These are married male city teachers who presumably have been 
rural teachers and have gone to Summer School or University 
and are well qualified but now find they cannot make ends 
meet. Many have been withdrawn by death, retirement, illness, 
or leave of absence for study, but that would not total 428 
in 43 cities. (see Table XXXI) 

The tradional Canadian attitude to married female teachers is 
fast changing as indicated by Table L. Teachers in service 
85.1 per cent of them, say let the married woman teach if 
her household is eared for and if she devotes her whole time 
and energy to teaching® Table LI shows the increase of 
married women in the cities. Table XLIX, Row 8, Columns (e), 
(f), and (g) shows an increase of 93*58 per cent since 1944 
in the number of married women teaching in cities® In the 
small towns and rural areas where the shortage is much more 
acute this number may well be a two or three hundred per 
cent increase* 

The city school boards were asked their attitude to married 
teachers* This is set out In Table LII and requires no 


comment

The man who wishes to increase his income by advancing to 
positions of responsibility finds very few executive posts 
in the teaching profession. Table LIII gives only five 
areas in which one could advance. These represent in 
total about one per cent of the teaching staff. Industry 
and business offer executive positions to ten to fifteen 
per cent of their number. There are no $10,000 to $100,000 
positions in education. The really energetic, ambitious, 
money-grasping type spend but a few years in teaching. In 
all of Canada there are about forty cities with superin¬ 
tendents. Table LIV is developed from Rows 6, 8, 10 of 
Table LIII. This shows a very discouraging picture, and 
a man leaves the profession because he cannot face the pros¬ 
pects of being a grade teacher all his life. Cities could 
appoint a vice-principal for each principal. The rather 
small Increase in salary might b© just enough to hold that 
man in the teaching profession. Cities should appoint many 
more supervisors. The school boards with large teaching 
staffs might well consider the appointment of a superin¬ 
tendent. If more openings are not made the school boards 
will find an ever increasing exodus of their better men. 

Table LV points out that few schools obtain the whole-hearted 
support of the community. More than one community has lost 
a valuable asset in the teacher just quitting because the 
rank indifference of the public dove them to better paying 
jobs that held the respect of the community. Table LVI 
shows the teacher as an active agent in the community. It

is noted that some teachers are active in eight or more 
community organizations and that teachers hold many executive 
offices as well. When the community wants something done 
it is the teacher who is called upon. Favors are bestowed 
upon their neighbor# Little wonder some leave the pro¬ 
fession. They do so simply because they cannot e^ist as 
a grade B citizen# 

Table LVII gives some of the reasons Business and Industry 
have offered regarding this question of prestige. Prestige 
and money go hand in hand. Many will not enter the 
teaching profession because they feel the teacher is looked 
down upon, and it is a strong factor causing many to leave 
the profession* 

Another contributory factor of teacher turnover is the 
teacher himself* He simply lacks the personality, interest, 
and teaching ability required# Table LVIII lists some of 
the weak points that eventually drive the teacher out of the 
classroom. 

Possibly the greatest factor causing teacher turnover is 
salary# Table LIX sets out the salaries, minimum, maximum, 
and median, for the cities answering Series M question¬ 
naire. (List of cities in appendix) Table LX is the same 
information arranged in a form which is easier to work with. 
It shows that only one individual in city systems gets over 
#5,000. The key to the table is given on the fold. The 
pattern shows very clearly here: the Elementary teachers

STRONG AND WEAK POINTS OF TEACHERS 


8* *Vhat have been the "strong points" and the 
"weak points” in the teachers you have had 
since beginning Grade 1 ? 


Series D 
Question 8 

High School 
Students* 


470 students from British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, 
Manitoba, Quebec, end Prince Edward Island answered as follows: 


Strong Points 


1* The teacher was interested, and friendly 284 

2* The teacher had a good personality* (i*e. t had 

patience, humor, consideration, tolerance, character) 210 
3* The teacher showed ability to teach 168 

4* The teacher helped outside the school in ep©rt and 

community lif® 137 

5* The teacher had a good knowledge of the subject 

matter* 94 

6* The teacher kept effective discipline 72 

7* The teacher showed a sense of fair play and justice 4® 

8® No opinion 14 

Weak Points 

1® Lack of teaching ability 232 

2® Teacher had a poor personality (see above) 217 

3* The teacher was not interested in the pupil 13® 

4* The teacher was unfair US 

5® The teacher kept ineffective discipline 115 

6* The teacher shewed lack of knowledge of subject 

matter 29

get the least and it grades up to the High School with 
larger salaries* When these salaries are compared with 
ordinary day labor, industry, or business, it is small 
wonder twenty-five per cent of the married males in cities 
left the profession in 1947* Table LXII indicates the 
increase in teacher salary since 1939. The 1946 figure 
represents but 53.16 per cent rise in the median salary. 

On May 3, 1948, Ottawa released the information that wages 
were up 74 per cent above 1939, and that the general wage 
level in 1947 was up 12.2 per cent over the previous year. 
The 74 per cent indicates the increase over the 1939 figure. 
Logging was up in 1947 16.8 per cent to be 95 per cent 
above 1939. Other increases were 15.7 per cent in services 
to become 70 per cent above 1939: mining increased 15.3 to 
Mse to 62 per cent; and manufacturing is up 14.7 to reach 
the figure of 85 per cent. The teacher looks at his pay 
cheque, compares it with others, his increment with their 
pay increase, and decides he cannot afford to remain a 
teacher. 

Business and Industry were asked their opinion: What IS 
wrong with the teaching profession? Salaries and pensions 
are inadequate. They must be improved. Other points are 
given in Table LXIV. 

A number of factors have been indicated as contributing to 
the teacher shortage. Possibly the very nature of the 
profession is the most important factor. If times are good.

Provincial minima do not prevent the individual municipalities from 
adopting their own salary schedules, provided they exceed the minimum. 
This accounts for the fact that in the 50*000 to 100,000 class, for 
instance, the minimum ranges from BOO to l600 dollars in various cities, 

IfVhile average yearly earnings were going up from #975 in 1939 to #1,5^4 
in 1944 , an increase of 60,4 per cent, teachers* salaries increased from 
$B54 t© $1,098, or 2 B ,6 per cent , 1 This parallels closely the situation 
in the United States during the same period, where employed persons out¬ 
side the field of education received 79 per cent more on the average, 
while teachers received only 31 per cent more. The factory worker with 
little or no education making things for our current use receives greater 
compensation on the average than teachers who are training our children 
to be the citizens of the future.

the marriage rate is up. There is also more money, and many 
forsake teaching for higher salaries elsewhere. If there 
was a proper system of selection the misfits would be 
screened out and the number of withdrawals greatly lessened. 
Both the prestige of the profession and the conditions under 
which we work must be improved. If education had enough 
money it would attract so many that a program of selection 
could be put into practice. Education would then have the 
type of trainee it required«

PART VII 


TEACHER 


SHORTAGE 








170 


TEACHER SHORTAGE 

The ever growing shortage of teachers has at last awakened 
the people of Canada to the fact that its educational system 
must have financial support to a much greater extent than 
the property tax can carry. Every area of the dominion is 
aware of the shortage, but not aware of the fact that is 
growing worse and the situation will continue to deteriorate 
until 1955 unless immediate steps be taken# 

Table LXV gives the C. E. A. estimate of shortage as of 
January, 1947# The number in training is 2,600 less than 
the yearly need if the Canadian shortage is to be eliminated 
in three years# They did not get the trainees needed at 
the price Canada was willing to pay# Table LXVI is of 
interest when compared with Table XXXVIII. This illustrates 
the trouble experienced throughout this study# For example, 
Quebec reports through its Department of Education on 
Table XXXVIII 19,001 rooms that should be in operation. For 
the same year Table LXVI shows Quebec with 23,782 positions 
filled. Ontario similarly reports 22,184 and 23,566. So It 
is with the others. The table shows the shortage much below 
the C. E. A. report of January of the same year. The table 
also shows Alberta and Saskatchewan as the only places with 
shortages# This does not fit in with the reports from the 
Departments of Education in the same year. Table LXVII is 
the part of Table XXXVIII dealing with shortages. Here too, 
the shortage figures do not agree very well with the C. E. A.

report developed from questionnaires to the Departments of 
Education. Table LXVII gives the Departments’ estimated 
shortages as in November, 1947. This shows 6,183 as shortage# 
Table LXVIIX gives the C. E. A# report as of January 22, 1948, 
and shows the shortage as 7,276 teachers* This is an increase 
of 829 or 12*85 per cent in the teacher shortage in Canada# 

The questionnaire for the C# E. A. report is in the Appendix* 

From Tables LXV and LXOX there is reported the approximate 
enrolment necessary to make good existing shortages in three 
years# The figures are 9,508 in 1947 and 10,507 one year 
later® This represents an increase of 10.51 per cent. 

These tables indicate there is a shortage of qualified 
teachers in Caiada; it is serous, and is rajMXy growing worse# 

The question was asked city boards and superintendents which 
positions were difficult to fill because of the shortage# 

Their replies are tabulated and shown in Table LXX. Even 
with the nicer living conditions, better working conditions, 
and larger salaries, the cities have their troubles with 
new appointments. The condition is not improving# Not 
only do they find it difficult to fill certain positions, 
there are positions they have left unfilled because they 
could find no one to fill them# The number of unfilled 
positions is increasing# Table LXXI shows the trend#

Business men and teachers in service were asked what steps 
might be taken to staff the schools. Table LXXII contains 
their suggestions. Business and teachers indicate salaries 
as of first importance. Business places selection and training 
as second. The teachers want a respectable place in which to 
work. Other points are listed* 

Superintendents were asked to do a little diving. Table 
LXXIII shows their results. They feel that their school 
population is declining to rise sharply again, but they 
indicate they will need more teachers in 1954 to teach 
fewer children than were present in 1948. The increase in 
the number of teachers they will require in 1954 is but 
8*57 per cent® 

Table III on page 75 gives an 8 per cent increase in the 
school population of ages 5 to 14. This means 171,000 
more children in 1951 than in 1941, or on the average, a 
gain of 17,100 per year. This 17,100 children entering 
each year means 570 more teachers per year are needed than 
for the year before. Using the number of teachers in our 
schools in 1948 as a basis I wish to present my estimates 
of the shortage for the next few years. Prom Table XL 
and Table LXVI a fairly accurate statement of the number 
of teachers In Canada can be set at 87,231. Since the 
turnover is approximately 10 per cent, then there will be 
lost to the profession 8,723 teachers. This loss is off¬ 
set in part by the 7,833 in training. This number in 
training is deceptive. Michigan estimates that from 20

To this picture must be added the natural increase in 
population. Table III gives a yearly average of enough 

































192 


children to account for 570 more teachers. This to be added 
to our shortage* 

Now add the children of the returned men. They are not con¬ 
sidered in Table III. Table XV gives 20,997 children. The 
43,454 adults reported were in the main war brides. Let us 
assume there are 40,000 families. In light of the section 
on family size dealing with age at marriage, number of 
children, etc., we can, with impunity, add another 6,000 
children to this total. This will give us, at least say, 
1,000 entering school this fall, or the equivalent of 
another thirty-five teachers* 

Then, too, there are the D. P.’s who are coming to Canada in 
ever increasing numbers. Page 102 suggests another 600 
to 700 teachers needed. 

The shortage for next September is now approximately 11,000. 
The situation is deteriorating so rapidly the provincial 
governments and eventually the federal government must do 
something for education. 

These figures worked through to 1952 become ridiculous and 
the situation is untenable. The whole problem of supply and 
demand must be attacked by a commission. The financing of 
education must be placed on a broader base.

FINDINGS AND 


RECOMMENDATIONS 



FINDINGS 


POPULATION: 

1* The Canadian population in the age group 5-14 years 

will increase during the decade 1941-1951 by 8 per cent 
or by 171,000. There will then be 2,316,000 children. 

By 1961 there will be a decrease of 0.7 per cent or a 

loss of 16,000 children. 

15-19 year old 

2. The population in the^age group will decrease during 
the decade 1941-1951 by 6.7 per cent for a loss of 
75,000. By 1961 there will be a gain of 18.3 per cent. 

This adds on 191,000 to make an all time high of 1,234,000. 

3. The rfiftio of the number of children per 1,000 women will 
rise from 396 in 1941 to 403 in 1951. It will then drop 
off to 330 by 1961. 

4. There was a sharp rise in the number of marriages from 4 
the 1921-40 average of 75,845 per year to the 1941-44 
yearly average of 120,867. 

5. Immigration has risen from 11,324 in 1940 to approxim¬ 
ately 100,000 for the year ending May, 1948. There will 
be an estimated 24,000 children 

DEMAND FOR TEACHERS: 

6. In 1930 the holding power of the grades indicated 14.3 
per cent of the Grade V f s reached Grade Xll. In 1947 
45.72 per cent reached Grade Xll. The same cities report¬ 
ing in both cases.

twenty two selected cities for the years 1930 and 1947 
shows the the school population down 2 per cent and the 
number of teachers on staff up 10*9 per canto 

8* In 35 larger Canadian cities the teaching load (ratio of 
the number of pupils per teacher) is dropping* Reports 
indicate a teaching load of 36*05 in 1930; 34o53 in 1940; 
and 30*92 in 1947. 

9* The number of children in kindergarten had doubled since 
1930o 

SUPPLY OF TEACHERS: 

10o 36 0 4 per cent of the student teachers state they do not 
intend to stay in teaching longer than five years* 

11* The school boards and superintendents vote 92 per cent 

for personality as their first consideration when select¬ 
ing a teacher* 

12* The number of certificates issued to trainees with a 
Grade X education has increased 201*47 per cent during 
the last ten years* 

13* 49*98 per cent of the teachers in Canada have a Grad© XI 
education or less * Their professional training is less 
than 12 months* 

14* The number of permits issued has increased 1*4X8*29 per 
cent since 1937* 

15* Only 6*37 per cent of Canada’s teachers have one or more 
years of university training with 12 to 24 months of 
professional training*

RECOMMENDATIONS 


!• Improve the status of the teacher with respect to 

salaries, tenure, Retirement, and working conditions, 
and develop a public attitude that teaching is of the 
utmost importance® 

2® Develop more vigorous guidance and recruitment 
programs* Begin a recruitment program in high 
schools® Increase scholarships for normal-school 
students and provide federal subsidies for acceler¬ 
ating teacher-training programs® 

5® Locate qualified teachers who are not now teaching 
and get them back into the profession® This group 
includes married women, retired teachers still able 
to teach, and teachers in other occupations who might 
be encouraged to reenter the profession® 

4® Provincial and federal aid on such a seal© as to have 
a dominion minimum salary for teachers of $2400*00 • 
This would guarantee a sufficient supply and a proper 
selection of trainees could be made* Teaching would 
be hard to get into and the better students would be 
attracted to it® 

5* Th© training period should be lengthened to a minimum 
of four years university with a. broad arts background 
followed by teo years of professional training*

As soon as a higher respect and attitude toward 
the teachers and the teaching profession become 
more general, as soon as we develop better teacher 
tenure, as soon as we establish better social 
security for teachers, and as soon as we.will 
provide the types of salaries for all teachers 
commensurate with their training and with the 
importance of their work, wfe will retain and 
attract persons into the teaching profession 
who will build a better generation with the 
youth of today for the better world of tomorrow*

April 27, 1948 


Dear Sir (or Madam): 

The Canadian Education Association is making a survey in all 
provinces in an attempt to determine why there is such a 
scarcity of teachers and why the teaching profession does not 
attract and hold more capable, efficient, and ambitious young 
people* We are asking for the opinions of several school 
trustees; we have replies from several other groups. 

All replies are treated confidentially and are incorporated 
into summaries. Please let us have your answers to our 
questions as soon as possible as we wish to include them in 
a report now being prepared. I should like to have your 
reply to the questions below and on the back of this sheet 
at once and certainly not later than May 15th. 

Yours very sincerely. 


MEL:JS 


M. E. LaZerte, Chairman, 

C.E.A. Teaching Personnel Committee* 


QUESTIONNAIRE 11 T n 

1. What, in your opinion, are the causes of the present 
teacher shortage in Canada? Give all the reasons that 
occur to you, putting the more important ones first. 


2. How might the teacher shortage problem be solved, not 
temporarily, but on a long-term basis?

SPECIAL MANITOBA 


Edmonton, Alberta, 
March 2, 1948. 


The Canadian Education Association is making a survey in all 
provinces trying to determine why there is such a scarcity of 
teachers at all times and why the teaching profession does not 
attract and hold more intelligent and ambitious young people. 
We are asking for the opinions of representative citizens in 
each province. We shall be very glad to have your opinions 
and answers to the questions that follow. All replies will 
be considered strictly confidential. 

(a) What, in your opinion, are the four or five causes of 
the teacher shortage? 


(b) What should be done to increase the prestige of the 

teaching profession so that it will attract more capable 
personnel? 


(c) What Is your general impression of Canada*s teachers as 
a group? 


Yours very sincerely. 


M. E. LaZerte, Chairman, 

C.E.A. Teaching Personnel Committee.
