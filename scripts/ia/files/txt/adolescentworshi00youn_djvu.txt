Tha pariod from childhood to adulthooa, which is 
coiLLuonly known aa adoiesconce, is one of particulai* 
importanca in tho character ana in the chiiatian 
education of a chila* Its problams axe peeuliai^ Ihe 
habit-patterns formed dui-ing these years govern to a 
large extent the after-life of the individual* 

In this essa^r we restrict the term "adolescence” to 
the particular age group of from twelve to eighteen, 
consider the worship of the adolescents of the Christian 
coimunion only. 

Our purpose, then, is to show that the adolescent 
does v/orship, and to find what place worship has in his 

life.

hav'3 already djfinad tha tana ’’adolascanca” 
in our opaniHi:; ])ara£’:raphs, so now our task will ba to 
doteri^ine the psycholo,!^ of this period of life in so 
far as it affects the v^/orshir of the individual. Havini^ 
taken adolescence to designate developiaant v/ithin a 
certain chronological aje, we confine ourselves to consid¬ 
eration of the Liotives, drives, character foriuing, and 
physical developments of those years. 

In early adoieseenee we find the first aamnins of 
social consciousness expressed in the gregarious group 
known as ”the gan.^.” 

”'Ihe child 'from nine to twelve is v^ell adjusted to 

1 . 

his environment and proportionately developed.” ^t 
the dawning adolescence, this old unity and harmony is 
broken up, the child is driven from his paradise, ana 
must enter and conjure a hisgher kincsaom of man for himself. 
Because his -environment is to be far more coBiplex, the 
combinations ar-a lass stable, the ascent less easy and 
secui'C. 

Hev; dangers threaten on all sides, fhe soul now 
realizes in a deeper sense the meaning of maturity and is 
pretensive toward its higher plateau. Here worships arises, 
youth aspires to excel. 

The gang provides an opportunity for expression of

his djsira to excol> a satisfa tion for the trainin.i'^ for 
compauionship. It providois a xnore coxi lex society than 
his hoiiie* In most Cases it v/ili he composed of boys 
about his own a e from varied backgrounds and of diffjrent 
status, socially and xaax*ally« hot yet has he become 
conscious of any distinction of race, color or creed. He 
is in a state bordering on blissful savagery. 

The gang also provides a protection or defence group, 
wherein he can hide his personality, and a sanctuary from 
the abuses, tyranny, and miaconcaptions that he imagines 
in the recognised social group^^the home. 

The Sung unit constitutes a social break with the 
individual’s past. This is evident in the revolt against 
the doctrines preached in the fanxily chui*eh, and in the 
refusal to become a member or to attend services. This 
state of reaction lasts only a few years ana upon more 
critical and far-x*eaching exaEiination we shall see that 
during these years the adult behavior patterns are vary 
much i.nflueneed’^. Out of the gang, under peculiar circum- 
staneesv will come potential ariminais and outlaws of 
society, while on the other hand a Biiniiauiri of proper 
leaaarship and diraction will davalop a sense of woi'th 
that is productive of convaraion and consecration to 
Christian life. - 

The early adolescent, while largely emotional, does 
not brand his age as one of seething emotionaiiam. He 

rather has felt a sense of independence and is seeking to

fhoisi in his "Normal Youth and Everyday Probloms" 
points out that many of the difficulties v^hich we have 
come to thinic of as inherent in the mystorioas dovelopment 

process called adolescence, are reall'/ chai^act oris tic

of, and created by, our fom of civilisation* 

This beia,!^ the ease, via must grant viitii nr, 

7an ^ators that, "plriysicaily and mentally, the nori4iai 
adolescent is capable of approximating the adult role as 
he frequently does among priialtive peoples and pioneer 
groups." 

Out of the revolt of early adolescence and the gang 
social unit, there emerges in the middle period, a spii^it 
of altruism which may deepen^ to some great causa. 

Large groupings ax‘e possible viith the developing 
social conscn^ousness. Ideas talca the place of mex^e woras 
and thex^e is born a desire to do things in the eoiiiSionly 
accepted v/ay. 

Conscience eoxaes into focus to olay a leading'role 
as the youth develops, prompting -.o the highest aspira«- 
tions and resolves. Bali tails us that it aviakens with a 
longing hunger and a thirst for righteousness. If

those of virtue stru,if5le for the soul<» in such a 
aitu-ition, the keenly emotional adolescent finds the 
conventional sanctions or the social customs inaaequata. 

To adequatel;/ explain conscience would necessitate 
a thorough analysis and consideration of the psychological 
drives, ana the ph^^sical make-up of an individual* 
whether we should consider these froni the standpoint of 
pure science of philosophy^ or of religion, ¥?ould make 
hut little difference*- For our p'oi'pose only a cursory 
sui'vey of instincts,. siiiotions, reflaxee and desires 
is necessary. We recogniEO that these influence habit- 
formation and are components of powerful Biotivatiiig 
forces* 

Instincts in modern psychology have a place in any 
system de|)endeiit upon the opinions of the psychologist 
involved^ For J. W« waison there are tiirae prrmaxy 
instinctss hove^. Eage and Fear. Me would explain 
worship as x^e.-.ction to the love and fear instinct* The 
accepted tendency, however, is to describe an instinct 
as an inherited reactloa pattern, and to recognise that 
with the growth and increasing complexity of the nervous 
system, of the so-called hirnian instliicts have 

deteriorated ox*’ become extinct* Kefloxes also have a 
central place in the explanation of behavior** sihile wa 
recognise the simple reflexes, such as the knee jerk, 
and the aye wirilc, we find that fox' woi*ship the simple 

reflexes have bean supplanted by the knowledge that 
reflexes are, ana can be conditioned*

individual is, as a rul^, incited to action by 
a coiubination of circutistanceso In very fev; situations 
is there a siiapie stimulus or aix'set response to such a 
stimulus as the behaviorist would have us believe* Stolz 

points out thi^t the coui^se of huiaan life is rarely, if 

1 . 

ever, outlined by a single motivating causa* lake, 

for exaiiiple, the attendance at a church service on 

Sunday morning* JKo one could say that the soul motivating 

factor is that on Sunday morning the person v^aJcens and 

says to himself "’Sunday,” and the one response is "Church*” 

In the attendance there has been first. In most eases, 

a choice made, necessitating ^ decision* In the attendance 

at, and participation in, the there is satisfied 

the gregarious instinct and a desire for self-expression 

as well as other less coratandabie factors* 

Love is undoubtedly the strongest motivating agent 

to adolescent worship* Yet we cannot think of Love as 

a siiuple motivating factor* Its background is wider, and 

its ■exx:)resaional associations are more deeply rooted than 

those of an^?' other foi'ce or di-^ivea It is akin to pity 

and a factor in the strong adolescent drive of sex. Its 

expression is mental, aesthetic and physical. Hall says 

that, "without a doubt love is the greatest pov^er of the 

E* 

soul, fixed upon the greatest object—Ood*” Lvary 
tribe or racial group of people of whom we have any 
historical record has in some way, ascribed recognition

ana worship to viod or <3003. I’lis child expresses love 
throa^h a smile oi response to the caroos of a parent, 
or throU;3h kicking ena squealing as a familiar person 
approaches the crib. In the childhood of the race people 
expressea the love pov/er they recognised as existin.^ 
between themselves and the natural povrers, through 
crude ceremony• 

In the Christian religion, love finds its highest 
foi’m of expression in the I'elation of Jesus with hod—• 
hod so loved the world that he gave his only begotten 
sen, that through Him men might have a new realization 
of life*” He find love expressed also in the beauti~ 
ful attitude of a iiother for a chliu* Ihrougii this 
intimate, familiar^ interpratatioiml reiationsiiip, we are 
able to approximate an interpretation of the iiomeas ar¬ 
able love of hod* 

lu the adolescent axi early expression of this moti* 
vating -force is in the love of life, in the virile, 
noble desire to have a place in the sun and to express 
himself in many small ways' about the home* Ihe sooiai 
consciousness and the altruistic motivated spirit of 
later adolasoence are in a large meaaure laotivatea by 
love. 

When the aitx^uistic adolescent realizes his possi¬ 
bilities for service, his place in the sun, he wakens to 
the fact of social instincts* He also becomes conscious

It^rge till it can no lon-;er- be nourishod from v^ithout, 
and must divide or die, so the individual must be subor- 
ainatea to society. 

Three sets of opposites come to play a large part 
in motivation. These are; Pleasure ana Pain, alation and 
hepressioa, uciLniratian and Gonteinpt» Thvese seta of 
opposites are ail closely related. The oseilatlons between 
opposites in later auolescenes are slower and more 
extreme. The recovery of the normal state of mind is 
retarded. The genius for Pleasure is never so great, and 
if the opposites for any reason, grip the life, it is 
v/arpea and confined. *^Ther3 is always a wide range of 

ehc-oige, batween more and less, before a centra of gravity

responsos are less ^sirable« uS must take some care to 
distinguish betv^een anger» an exx^ressian of egotism^ and 
the seif-feeling-^ and righteous indignation which unauubted 
ly has been a factor in the creative religious wor'k of the 
world. Jesus was filled with righteous indignation when 
he drove the money changers from the tem,;la. The anti« 
slave refonaors ware righteously indignant* fheir 
indignation furnished an inspiration for their splendid 
work* fhe fears that ?;3 recognise tod^iy are social» 
moral and religious, and our eouatanaacing of them coiiies

silonce in tho prosenea of the inystoi'y of the universe, 
ahon a boy catches his first pouna trout, he experiences 
a complex respouse, which may not be fully intexcreted 
until years after when he knows inore of science ana is 
able to re.-,iiza the troutnative air and to intex^pret 
its beauty in terms of pi^entution* ahen he realities 
the fact of a brother or sister in the home, his lasponss 
is eriiiplex and its fall significance will not be 
comprehended iuntil he has a child of his ov/n in his arms. 

In every situation or process v/hose euaplexity is 
difficult to apprehend., there is an inaxpXxcabie element

to designate that something, as yet not fully underst red 
by psychologists, vmioa insures a sameness of response.

bonds become stronger with use luntil wo c^n insuim* a 
definite outeoiive of a specific wor-hi. situation. 

Possibly the chief motivating foi'-ee and assui'ediy the 
most complex of'adolescenee, is the developing sex urge. 

In these years the youth becoiues oonscious of latent 
powers and uivges that find expression in a great variety 
of v/ays. The boy discovers his beurd, his voice changes.

edly in various libraries. 

The girl becoiiies conscious of her developing 
physique and change of voles. She regards her father as 
mox"S of a eorapanioa than her moth up. 

On the part .of both sexes there la an attitude of 
defenee against public opinion or eritieisia. fhe deveiop- 
raent of curiosity is marked and if properly g^iided may 
be txa.nsferabie to all of life, in this respect, all 
too often we h.^ve made the - fatal nd.stake of ”iex taboo.” 
fha youth should be taught res|>3et for the facts of 
nature, for thereby he will coxae to realis&e hia own 
natural powers and place in a creative universal world- 
plan. It IsnH a sudden for ara leap, but rather a 
gradual development. However, the consciousness of having 
attain-ea puberty may ems aa a surprise or even a shook. 
Then it is all the more imperativa tiiat youth should 
have a factual knowledge to suppor't the all too over¬ 
worked moral oonsciencx. This conseiousness of a sexual 
po'.ver at puberty undoubtedly gives rise to new ideas and 
attitudes. Hall says of puberty that it is the time .hen

On3 ni^ht whan as a youn^:; man avmy from homo fox' tha 
first wintar in tha lumbar woods of the iiaat, I lay on 
bunk thinking of a oonfarance of youths I knew to be going 
on in a town fifty miles distant, fhe members of this group 
ware moating in fellowship and aocruaing to thamselvas 
many iiamaasarable values* 

It v/as a glorious moonlight night* fhe shadows of 
the trees on the white stretches of snow ¥^*3re fantastic* 

The slight breezes stirred the tree tops, but at tha huts 
we could feel scarcely a breath of the breeze which moved 
the branches. The stars shone in their glory as they can 
shine only on a cold, wintry night, out of the azure of 
deep purple blue* The eaiap yai‘d was still, except fox* an 
occasional hearty lau^gh from the bunk-house or a low curse 
from the office, v/here a group played or the stamp 

of a horse*s foot in the stable. In the windows of the 
cook-house the lights shone brightly as the chef set 
the tables for breakfast, all this I saw as I stepped 
from tha bunk-house and looked ai^ound for a moment' listening. 
Then I walked out the trail a mile or two stopping 
occasionally to trace the outline of a fantastic shadow on 
the snow, or to listen to tha music the treetopa 
or to cast my eyes to heaven to observe the clouds 
scudding across tha face of the moon, feeling all the time 
the pulsations of it all, realizing something out of the 
silences, interpreting new beauty, drinking in new strength.

wandoriiv^ thus for an hour, I turned tovyard carap. 

Just as I caught tho first glirijaer of light in the tre^s 
I felt a new ui*ge—an urge to pray, Stepping off the 
trail I knelt by a blackened stub of a tree—a monuciont 
to beauty that haa been, -vS I prayed, f saw new depths 
of beauty, felt a close sense of all around me, heai’d a 
nobler music in the evergreens, fhen as X v,^alked the 
fev/ rods to camp, I r3ali;r*ed that X had experienced 
something, #hat had I done? How had such a vivid exper¬ 
ience been possible? ihy did I feel happier and reali 2 e 
a contentment in place of the restlessness that had been 
in ay mind earlier in the evening, l^e answer undoubtedly 
is, I had worshipped^ 

In do soing in my teen-age way, I had interpreted 
the real meaning of this old Angla-Saxon word, "v^eorthsclpe” 
in its deepest meaning—^the practise of seeing deep down 
into the heart of things and finding their real worth, 
their inti’insic value and having that worth become a part 
of one. fhis practii^e of seeing deep down into the heart 
of things may mean a chain of contacts and a realization 
of power, 

Adoleseenee is a s ate of development leather than 
an age group or definite period of years. In the Old 
Testament we have the recorded experience of Jacob who 
worshipped, leaning on the top of his staff as he gazed 
at the starry heavens. The aborigine turned his eyes to 
the sun, the moon and the stars ana realized a stirring 
of his faculties that forced him to ascribe vjortii to his

raverence, or axhilaration, but too often it is frozen 
upon his lips by the stare or word, of a conventional adult 
companion. Yet in spite of such demanas upon him to 
confom, before his time, the taen-aije youth is shockingly 
frank, free and expressive. On the playing field he will 
loudly acclaim the popular hero and cheer his team to vic¬ 
tory. The boy in his early teens saturates himself with 
the life story, aceomplishmenta, habits ana manner!sma 
of his hero. He lives a role unreal uintil he makes it 
familiar, interpreting his hero to others in geatui^e, 
voice and attitude. This intex^prstation is as often 
unconscious as planned. Ha finds his moments on the side 
line of the practice field a delight and an inspiration. 

In the hero worship of the ee^rly adolescent, as real for 
girls as boys, the hero is the recipient of ”worth” in as 
real a sense as any Deity he can conceive. In fact in 
many cases the early adoleseont's conception of deity will 
be colored by his adoration of his hero, and will be 
interpreted in relation to that hero* ”0ur lather” to him 
v^ill mean almost exactly what he sees in his parent. By 
later adolescence the youth bac>mos conscious of hiiaself 
to the extant that he realizes less of delight in living 
the life of a hero, a new eluent arrives, the striving for 
the approbation of society. Hot the least of such express¬ 
ions is the cultivation of the companionship of the 
opposite sex.

i^urin^ these years there is a search for an adequate 
philosophy of life in v;hich he may scoi^n the ideas that 
were his only a few years beforeo For the boy and the 
girl of early teens Jeeus is a hero« They can read of 

how he woi'shipped at twelve years of age. Ha grew as 

1 . 

they are growing, ”in wisdoia and in statui’C.” 

The mystery of the hidden years is aliLOst a tragedy for 
the midale and later adolescent, yet these groups ax^e 
looking toward a realiJ^ation of companionship .with the 
Christ of OtOii and are ailigently seeking to fina how 
the dasus of histoxy re¥aal3 the good life. 

One of the tragedies of the ?#orshi^^-life of so many 
adolescents is that they have not come to know what 
worship is duriitg childhood, nor have they become 
acquainted with the Scripturs-s* If they have not had 
sotae training before adolescence it will^ difficult for 
them to worship adequately then* Ho one can ascribe 
worth to any object of which he is totally ignorant* 

The boy who has interpreted Jesus as the central figuie 
of his religion will be able to express the thought of 
”The Boy^s Own Boak**—^^he will find momants of worship 
a delight and an inopiration*" 

This ascribing of vmrth then, made vocal in praise, 
is a natural leapon-je to the good, the beautiftil and the 
true. The good will be evident in the life he has come

to Icnow as that of Christ, and even if ha doaa not know 
that lifa, he will racojnize the good in things with which 
he comes in contact, it does not take the boy long to 
realize that the universe is on the side of him v/ho is 
on the side of right? I’be beautiful and the true are of 
easier interpretation because they are deep-rooted in the 
muke-up of the adolescent* He knoVvS'beauty in the flora. 
In the hide it has been a part of his earliest recollec¬ 
tions. The true is characteristic of his dealing with 
his gang and his code of honour, f^hen the football 
hero fails, the dx'eam ideal fades through some disil- 
lusionnient. ¥shen the adolescent no longer has confidence 
in friends through misfortune or inisunaerstanainrs he 
automatically turns to grope for a confidant and companion 
who is adequate and sufficient. 

In the later period of adolescence he comes to 
realize fellows lip ?/ith a divine coniiaant who is ail 
sufficient and who is expressed in various ways. In the 
search for this confidant religious experience enters 
possibly for the first time and the development of the 
relationship with the confidant thx^ough the media of 
worship consciously and ^mconsciously leads in most 
cases to conversion. Tnis change, termed conversion, 
is brought about in many cases with dramatic suddenness 
as the flood of feeling harbored, unrationalized, and 
unsublimated for years, expresses itself in a natural 
response. 

The intensity of reaction will depend upon the

influancj and. Christian nurture to consider* Ona boy 
may have had a record of Juvenile doliii(3uancy and 
iidstaicQS that makes him deeply ashamed of himself and 
places obstacles in his v?ay of search for the newly 
desired vmy of life* While on the other hand a chap 
broujht up in a similar hjma, but of a different disposition 
may have never been conecious of any failure to adjust 
himself to the standards of his community* may have 
never had any expsi^iences for which ha is deeply sorry* 

His life has beei| simply a growth of thlisgs religious 
and there have been no occasions for personality 
disintegration* Since we are not concerned with a 
theological approach to eonvei’sion it is uselesE for 
us to compare these cases or to delve into aubsequent 
life-histories* 

With the eonvei'^slon^ wheth-^r thot^ht of as a dramatic 
experience or whether regarded as simply growth in 
grace^ there comes a new realiEatioa of the presence of 
the divine confidant* fhera also begins a davelopment 
of more stable Christian character* le are aceustomad to 
think of a Christian eharaeter as containing an element 
that provides balance and clarity of vision in facing 
the issues o£ life* fhe ah^:istian character mechanism 
is more highly tuned# fhia^ no doubts is due to the fact 
that the Christian ernes to realize a revelation of dod 
in the woi'ld about him* and also to the fact that thna^ugh 












tha procass of attainiaant, ha comes more and more to 
see the ^reat primal urje of the universe and to realize, 
ever increasin :ly, his own potentialities and powers 
yf^hen in. tune with the infinite« 

However, if we are to think of Christian character 
as a finely tuned instrument we must realize that, as any 
other elaborate machine it needs the care of specialization. 
This care can be provided through worship, which is as 
fundamental to Christian character—growth as the r-ain 
is necessary to insu e tha maturity and fruition of 
seed. The tragedy of many lives could be avoided 
if only the persons could realize that revival of strength 
is possible in an hour of quiet, or if they could callow 
the breeze to blow the v^rinkies from their brow and 
could knov^ that it is from the ”giver of every good and 
perfect gift.”

WHY WORSHIP? 

s/3 hav'3 coma to the placa whara now we ean ask the 
quastion, ”v;hy should an adolescent worship?” Ha lives 
in a world of stimulus and response^ v/hare a hum^uiistie 
philosophy is calling actjaptanea and the scale of values 
of life is all too material. Why than should ha worship? 

Oui' reply will ccmia only as we develop the i-emaining 
thought of this assayj seeking to prove that there are 
needs that worsiiip satisfies, throi^h specific types of 
service and ceremonial, and that the adolascant v^ay of 
life in itself is a response to truth and beauty. 

frue worship arises out of, and satisfies, three 
universal, himxan needs? 

1. fha need for ideal eompanionship. 

2. fhs yearning for inner toimony and peace. 

3. The desire for the preservation of all values.

He needs contagious living examples. Recognising conflicts

the close of a session of worship in a conference 
of boys a chap who had always been very shy, who had 
lived to himself and had stood apart from the group; 
whose interests had been in his own thin/s, ana had 
never known what it was to share and sacrifice in his 
h ms, caiua up to the leader and said, ”Gan I talk to 
you? I want to find out if X can be a Minister,” 

The leader was a student in theology and the boy had 
found in him, during the days of that conference, an 
ideal compcinionship. This boy dui'-ing those days and > 
in order to he near his new companion, had mingled with 
the group, and had shared in ac-ivities, vocal and 
physical as well as meditative, until he had lost some 
of the con^sciousness of self, and when he asked that 
question he had become endowed with a new freedom, a new 
courage, and a new purpose in life. With this recog¬ 
nition of a place among his fellows there dawned for him 
a new re lizution of beauty, a wider field of truth, and 
a noble longing for the expression of all that was pent up 
in his soul. 

With the conquest of seif there is released a new 
energy; a nev; soul force is set in motion* Through 
worship the individu^ii bee mes conscious of this new 
energy and finds new strength for the duties before him,

realization of new stren^-rth wq ma^ call "energy released 
through worship." Palmer speaks of woiSiiip as "putting? 

into life soraethihg which steps it ut to a hi^rher

voltage." This "energy release” con-es through the 
worshipper putting himself in tune uith the infinite. 

It will come with the conquest of self. The seekin; of 
such power will not be false peace or a mare escape as 
we might sometimes be forced to think. It may rather 
be a release of new energy to grapple v/ith the very 
problems he is sometimes accused of trying to avail. 

Jesus, in ^ethsemane went thx^ough such an experience. 
He seemed to be seeking an escape, yet when he realized 
viod*s wiil^ he f ound the energy relaased that enabled 
him to face trial, scorn and death. 


luner >iiy and Peace - 

Moat people at one time or another, have gone into 
the olace of worship, tired, disillusioned and discouraged 
its the conventional, familiar service h^ts proceeded, 
they have found peace of mind ana have gone forth in 
harmony with themselves and with their coimriunity. 

Our age often eremites in youth a sense of delusion. 
The school, the club, the dance, the pc^rty, the muaement 
hall and the church, all seem to compete for the time 
of youth. Business, erinie, pleasux-e, professions ana the 
service seem to bid at the auction block for the adol¬ 
escent facing the choice of a pathway of life. In spite

fhe third thin.? that v,-orsalp should do is to provide 
a desire for the praservation of all values. For man^’- 
an adult this desire is laeklnj because of sonie weakness 
in his'home Influanca and associution. The boy who 
worships shoula find a concept of dod, the Father^ in 
his own had. It should ba as natural a fchin,^ for- him 
to ba frank with his had as to confess to Goa» mr to

that a vary small parcGnta.ra of hoys will go to their

Gre.^t vuiuaa for the teen-age are in sport* in a 
sense of h neui’ to the pang. Ihe whole scale of 
living still will evolve around experiencea that ar© 
in accord vrith the satisfactions derived fr-om these 
values. Heligion only in the later teens will provide 
any sense of va lues at all. Youth thven mustj, and will, 
heed the j^dmonitioxi of Pauls ’hVhatsoever things are 
true, w'hutsoever things are honest, whatsoever things 
are Just, wliutsoever things re pure, whatsoever things 
are lovely, whatsoever things csra of good report, if

Christian eh-a^acter* Peter was little more than an

rebuke he received from Jesus—thee bahinii

It is to th3 credit of adolescents that they have 
coura^o to cope v/ith issues which they realize aj:*e beyond 
their power, and that they seek for an adequate c jntrol 
of life in its aajustLiOnts and conflicts. iJurin£^ the 
early years of adolescence one expects ideal i.ioral 
standards. The drea^u power is treii.endoua as the years 
of stress pass. It is subliisatea and becoii^es more 
practical. "It is well for youth,” says 3tolz, ”if 
it learn, before moral decay has set in, th.>t lib:irty 
is achieved throue^h the voluntary exercise of self- 
discipline.” dliile not always is ha able to evaluate 
the resti'ictions and customs v^hic society has i posed 
upon him, he is,nevertheless, seekln© for an adequate 
interpretation, and he idealizes that this can probably 
c jine only tl rough conformity to-existing convention. 

Very often he waits his turn till he will have economic 
and mental security enough to break the fetters that 
bina him. 

With his ever-increasing sensitivenass to religious 

values, while critical and analytical, youth seeks a 

religion which is equal to the damands of contemporary 

life. Honest doubt leads to ^ositive religious experience. 

Throughout the who^e period perplexity is apparent and 

needs careful guidance ana vjatchful care. His code of 

honor is high and chivalry is something more than can be

Unaoubteclly thiis is vor^’ true, I’ho eternal verities

find v;orihip to have been a source of daily strenf?th, 

" \s his custom was ho went daily into the temple,"^ v’he 
search for ciaily stren^’th has perpetuated in the f?«nily 
altar of christi^ni htmes ?ill throuprh the history of 
relipion. From those homes, in Vv'hose daily round there 
has been a half hour in the morninp for worship^ 2 ind for 
renevnil of strength, have pone man^^ of our leaders in 
church aJ3Ci state, with higher morality and finer courage 
th?in otherwise would have been thcurs. We find the 
Indlvidtial expression of this daily coirmiunion in the 
hour of silence, out of which comes the guidance of 
the members of the Oxford Group ITovanent,

really abstract to separate these things one from the other. 

Just as in church worship the personal iind the soci al are

In the Protest/int faith the individual finds the 
fine quality of this Idea ixi the na::e of m church or 
Saint, In the niime of Christ he confesses his sins and 
pleads forgiveness. It is with Christ that the ^cuth 
finds hiriLolf intimate and it is through Christ ho comes 
to God, ^his, of course, is due to the fact of the

juat how much a moment of quiet meditation, of 
dedication, of thank^giTing, as one enters one’s pew 
in a place of worship could mean as a prepjiration for 
the corporate v^orship v/ith the ecngregfitlon. In ever^ 
Zero hour of those who appetir on the public platform 
there is a moment of worship^ It Is not always 
conoeious, of course, but there is that tonso, juixious 
desire for pov/er, for strengtJi, which alwa^^s finds 
responsiveness as one grips one’s-self. Jesus in 

Geths^siane fought his fight in private before going 
cut to face the task of interpreting to the disciples, 
to the Jevfs, to the world, the messngo of his relation¬ 
ship with God the Father.

hls own group or g uig Y?hen hia worbhi p ib oofinltel^ 
subjective. During those exorcises he is posBessect by 
a sense of rest and of quiet pov er. These, as in the 
opening cerefioiiy of a group, often iff orb a re-cilrecticn 
of ©nerg;/ from ph^^sical activity to the cc ntempl ati\ e aiib 
studious attitude. 

QHCU? P 

Such is really group worship which bocomes increasing¬ 
ly complex v/ith the complexity of the group involved, in 
the g ing the ad o 1 e bc ent r e. il 1 r. es his first exper 2 one oof

and of devotion Inspire and challenge. Th© factor of 
human influence becomes real. He is increasingly conscious 
that each and every member of the group exerts some 
influence on every other member. In discussion the ehash 
of intellect sharpens the wit. Issues clarify anri 
decisions are made quickly, .llway-s in the group there 
is a plus element which v^e cannet altogether explain. 

In Christianity ?/e see the recognition of this fact by 
JeEus when he said, ^Where two or three .*ire met together 
in my n^jme I m in the midst.(Matt. 18:20) 

The e.i.rly clori stlims found that it va s advantageous 

to meet together for fellovvEhlp, for bre?iking of bre^jS and 

fo- pr? 3 y'ers. Throughout the history of the christifui 

church the public v7orship of the church has kept aliv^e the 

sense of Goo in the community, ’'hership has no meaning

In thf3 group wortihip thero iu the ob^ectiie eenue 
th it compritiou a large factor* ’’Worship Is 
aseentisocial* It goes out to God and fosters the 
highest fellowship of spirit between man anfi man.” 

I’o ^’outh it comes v/ith a sense of expectancy* 

For him surely somotiiing is going to happen* Two 

factors loom l^irge in liis worship oxp^-irioiices—the 

miriistry of beauty anc the ministry, of silence. As 

Simpson points out corporate v/orshi p i s an active thing. 

Stnothing is done—a re ponse is mace: there is mi ”of- 

1 . 

faring.” That offering is mape v ith others, in so 
far as the v/orshpper enters into ana interprets the 
offering response just to that degree will the 
sense of expectancy be satisfieb. These tv/o are gre it 
thoughts of corporate worship. 

The many expressions of justice tuici beauty that v;e 
see in the universe are all albs to our realisation of 
the depth of the lov^e of God. Through the concrete in 
corporate worship the youth catches viaicns of a Irtrger 
truth. He offers his response to this truth oi" to some¬ 
thing he feels in the ministry of beauty juid of silence* 
T‘ich of these-has a profcunci influence upon hiej. Always 
that offering is more profcunci ?ind meardugful if sheired 
with others. He comes to realise ’’the Lord is in 
his holy taiaple” find he cries In his heart ”let all the 
world keep silence before him.”

Religion for a man ma^^ be moa-^nred the ran^ e of 
his own consclousnoss of moaning ?iniD of purpose in the 
universe, and nna^; be interpreted through the process of 
relating himself to the central signlfieance. For the 
adolescont the struggle for an adequate religion seta 
in under pubertal stress vhien the dawning realisation 
of quickened povvor forces him to strive to reillao his 
purpose and moaning in the imlverso. With the coming 
of purpose to his existence there also da?msan 
lucre t&ingl;v^ intense love of life. He sees nev^ values 
in the universe around him, realises there Is something

something and someone beyond tho fi^ll^ circle which has

of striking plan’s!qua, or of some particular talent, he 
b comes conscious of hi 01 self as the oymimre of all es 

and suffers, as he gro?vB older, all the rebuffs of 
adjustment to norm?il living in a normal social world.

mystical in life has a profound meaning at puberty? for 
the acclescent and also in religious rite and practice, 

Vi/8 are led to ‘xrgue that for the age groups ‘’religion

PUHPQ3^ OF ..0li3HXP 

Th3 primary purpose of a service of worship is to 
direct the attention of a ^roup tov;ara 3oa« fhis bein^ 
the ca e the sei'vice must be planned to embrace such 
interpretation of the means of worship as v^ill ie^u to 
the coim-union of the total personality with the decree 
of ultimate reality which the particular personality is 
able to comprehend, viorship with such purpose and 
in all of its exercises or practices is an experience of 
life, thcit is difficult to measui'e. ^*.3 all other exper¬ 
iences of life it comes not only in the group but in the 
life situations, in the x»eactions of an individual 
character* 

In whichever aspect or relationshi it ma^ occur its 
motivations, forces and components will be the same, vie 
have in the chx’istian religion come to think of the 
ministry of silence as conducive to the apprehensions of 
reality, oymbolism and beauty have come to mean infinitely 
more than v^Fe can express in prosaic language. Therefore, 
we resui t to ways of the poetic impression. Thus the 
hymn with its associ-cted music, and the repetition of 
inspirational literature, whethax* scriptural or secular, 
have come to havj specific value for the one who 
practices chi^istianity in and through worsliip.

Th3 adolescent will prepare hiuiself in his own way. 

I knew one chap whOj faceoi vith his first op ortunity 
to speak in public, realizin^^ the priviledi'e v/ith 
adolescent e^otisiij. ana feeling his own inadequacy for t e 
task, walked for an hour before the service in the rain, 
going over the speech he had prepared ana reciting 
woras of hynns and prayer that enabled hiii to grip 
himself and when the time came to speak all that was 
in his teen-age heart* 

3ome of us of this generation remember the family 
altar, where each morning the family gathered while the 
father read and prayed. Possibly vie all repeated the 
hord’s prayer or it may have been the custom for the 
members of the faiaily to ea.h tioke a tuin with the 
reauing. Out of that homely practice of the r^r senca of 
Ood have gone forth sons and daughters to cherish that 
simple act as a tremendous factor of huiiian influence in 
their lives. 

i:he adolescent finds it difficult to expr ss himself 
adequately in properly accepted language, we find him an 
apt pupil in swearing and in slang. In these he seeks 
refuge when his language of expression is inadequate for 
h^s own sv^ift moving thought processes. It is not 
unconimon to heai‘ such senseless jargon asJ ”iiid what— you* 
eali-him leave a doohinlcies here for me** from a chap ask¬ 
ing whether a friend had left a bathing suit here for 
him. Fortunately, for the boy’s self-respect and for

mutual undarstandinj batvvejn him and tha laudai, the 
ona to v,/hom it wus aadrassad v/as familiar v;ith 
adolascant parlanca. In spoakinj of the adolaacant*s 
ability to axprajs spiritual exparionees, \/arkyl says: 

’*If the adolescent cLivelops normally in spiritual 
experiences he will find himself liickiur' in language to 
express himself adequately toward and about God. Either 
he must find such language or make it, else the feeling 
that Called forth worship expression is doomed to 

1 . 

dv/indle, which would be an iiriraeasurable calamity.” 

In the seaich for this adequate language of express¬ 
ion for spiritual experiences the adolescent will fina it 
in daily conversation, in prayers of others, in holy v^rit, 
in his own thoughts which struggle for expression, 
his vocabulary increases new expressions come, too, and 
are made real* Therefore unless our worship is creative 
and progressive it inevitably flattens and we deceive 
ourselves. 

One of the most familiar worship-rituals for 
adolescents in use today is the openincg ceremony of 
Trail Hanger and Tuxis groups. In this ceremony we have a 
call to loyalty to the group and a reminder of group 
allegiance, followed by a scriptual quotation of the basis 
and aims of the movement*

arg^iment for ritual. I'he ceremony helps to create a

the whole is on the 3xpi*essive elements found in all

Of the corporate practice of worship the most far^iiiiar 
to our day is that of the regular Sunday ochool session. 

Hera the opening exercises, so calJLed, tand tragically, yet 
often rightly, because they are exercises rather than 
woi'shipj in the majority of cases are adult planned, adult 
motivated and adult eondicted. ^11 too often there is no 
sense of proportion or fitness, nothing that would lead to 
a proper atmosphere for the study of the lesson to follow. 

In fact for the most scholars of our Sunday Schools the day’s 
session is divided into three parts: the opening exer¬ 
cises, the lesson, the elosln^:^, wherein the chief iteiu is 
to get one’s paper. V?heraver this is the case it is a 
tragedy. Thi adolescent in the Sunday School expects

worship is real, ha will no longer trouble hixuself v/ith it. 

Herein lies oar .jreatest op ortunity for training in 
vjorship® In all services there should be op'-ortunities for 
the ministries of silence and of beauty. If these are 
present there will also be the sense of wonder anci the 
realisation of an unseen o'didin^ presence. 

V,e ha\re found that in all services inaucing vjorship 
there axe all or some of the follovyin^^ madia pre^ant: 
music, hynins, prayer, stories, and scripture. Vi^e shall 
now look at each of these to ascertain, if possible, 
their values for adolescent vaorship. 

Music 

Music has been called by someone, "the l^uigua -e of 
heaven.” .i^s such it expresses emotions and attitudes, and 
also oraj.tes them, fhis hieing the ease we can see how such 
idealistic persons as adoieseents, with their sensitive 
emotional make-up, will recrt positively to music. Thera 
is no gre ..ter creator of an atmosphere than*instrmrental 
music, properly rendered, whether by_an artist or 
reproduced froiu records. Music helps one to forget self. 

It creates a medium of undsi^stanaing. it supplies a 
coBmion ground. It inspires to love and to aesthetic 
appreciation. Music is fsiirdliar groud to the adolescent 
of oui^ generation for it is so much a part of his home 
and social life#

very effective use as material for responsive readings or 
for unison repetitions. Tao teen-age boy should be 
encoux*aged to learn hyrans so that he may know the words* 

He should also be taught the music and the various

may mean a great deal to a boy strugglin'! with temptation.

iJuring the storni of the evening one could hear from 
the tents of the bo 3 or froiu the inaiviauais as they 
roamed the campsite, snatches of funit liar hymns. Those 
chaps faced, reality that night and in theii’- h^min snatches 
showed, ail unconsciously to themselves, the thoughts 
of their hearts. 

Kot ail hymns are suited for any one age group. 

Grieat caia must be exercised in the selection of hymns for 
specific services and occasions, h'o one can iFiagine a 
fuli-bloodsd boy or girl singiug *‘For such a v/orm as I”, 
or *U) coma all ye aisconsoiata. ” It is easy to conceive of 
the same boy and girl sin^^lnci, rejoicing and living 
through "0 let me ;vaik with Thee”, or "head on, 0 

eternal.” Singing induces physical expression anu. 
the joy of co-operative effort. It also aifords an 
opportunity for self-expression and creates a fine sense 
of unity. 

These latter factors were illustrated in the Inter¬ 
national Conierenco at Butfaio, whei^e in the o u*vice3 
all nationalities sang such hymns as "Blest be the tie

real value is in the intox'pi station and in the a£,phusininj: 


of truths

Tha intare. t will yilwciys bj sustained if its action 
is moving and syisibolic, with a balancj afforded b;, the 
element of suspense. Jesus used the story in his 
teachin-:. The truths of his uiessa/e found media of perpetu¬ 
ation in the stories that were hanaed from mouth to mouth. 

In,the presentation of any story the needs, the 
character and the e-.p rienee of a ^rou shoula be kept in 
mind. To meet the needs of a specific -;roup one should 
proceed to the point without thoujht of moralizinr; or 
of gi^iU:?; a sernonetto, except on occasion when the latter is 
a recognlK^d pai*t of a partiealai^ torxiL of service. * 1.3 the 
story unfolds the hearer should be able to visualiiia the 
incidents ano be able to relate chai^acters and events. 

Care must be used in the choice of stories for specific 
groups, even within the adolescent uge. ^ second caution 
is in the preparation. The story teller should knov; a 
story word for word, and fui^ther, he should be able to 
live anct to recreate it* Gesture and dramatic affect are 
not nac 33 ; ai*y. The occasional story may mean more than 
an^y di'avjing of attention to rule, or than any talk on 
conduct. 

One night a chap in a group was disturuing a discussion 
in ivhieh the others were inter ^sted. The l-entor stopped for 
a moment and then told, as if to no one in partic iltir, this 
Storys '-One day, at caEip, we haa a paper chase. The 
treasure was buried tuenty feat froiu any one of four* silver 
papers* Frank, one of the lads, came buck to carr when 
the whistle blew for the end of the chv^oe, ana asked if 




-59C- 


ho could go and Iooj;. for tho traaaui'e. Hov/ could 
find it? Prank roplioa, ’well, if I don’t, no one 
else will* ’ The leader asked v/h. that was* Frank opefeed 
his hanu, and iyln.,' in his palin v/ere the four pieces 
of silver paper. 

I’he leader saia nothing but looked frank straight 
in the eye* a.t length he turned to the group and said,’The 
ti'casure will have to be divided eq^ually because no one 
will ever find it*’ To the ’’whys" of the boys he said 
nothing but as the supper bugle blew, frank huiebly 
sidled up to the leader and said,’Gee, I’lu sorry I didn’t 
pla^' fair*’ That chap> v^ho was disturbing the group saw 
th^^t 2^ wasn’t playing squarely anci that story was the 
beginning of a new companionship for him. It was a v/orshiTj- 
experience. 

Of the other items of a recognized service of worship 
we will not say anything, because they have no particular 
relation to the purpose vie have in hand* Kor will we 
consider at all the places of worship. There ai-e many and 
varied—froiii the grove of trees, God’s first temples, to 
the ornate cathedral*

»V«3 have coiiie to the place v/here we can outline 
the specific ways in which the uholeecent does worship. 
The questions that have arisen v/ith respect to v»/hat 
type of service he will have to participate in and 
enjoy can in some measure be answered. It will be 
necessary for us to think of the language adequate 
for the age group, realizing that always his vocab¬ 
ulary,—the one he unaerstanas—is greater than thu.t 
which is used. Inereasingiy throutUi wise airection, 
the youth should coii^e to use the vocabulary of 
v;orship and religious practice if he is to take his 
place in the adult public worship whan he has retiched 
maturity, and if he is to do this not merely as one 
of the group, but rather as one who has something to 
contribute ana to get infinitely more from his exper¬ 
ience. He should be so trained that the return -to 
the worship of the sanctuary, after years of wandering 
in the by-ways of other laore attractive experiences, 
will be more than fulfilling a convention which society 
expects of those who have established homes. 

The training in a particular i*eligious group 
may determine to a large extent one*3 attituae to the 
form of service desired. However, for the auolescjnt, 
some degree of ritual is of ix^miense value, and affoi’ds 
impressive challenge that otherv^ise may be lacking. 

The appeal to xaore than one sense is a recoamienuea

Thy cro^s is before us, its message pierces our hearts.

"Christian seek not yet rer,ose, 

Thou art in the ridst of foes.

the Christ-centred lives that are oijut'S. kay we seek to

Unison heading of acrinture: 

Luke 2:40-5^. 

kna the child grew, and waxed strong in snirit, filled 
with wistioin and the grace of doa was upon him. 

Koy; his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the 
feast of the passo^ar. 

And when he wae twelve years olo, they went u> to 
Jerusalem, after the custom of the feast. 

.vnd ?/hen they had fulfilled the days, as they 
retux^aed, the child Jesus tarried behinu in Jerusalem; and 
Joseph and his mother knavi/ not of it. 

But they, supposing him to have been in the company, 
want a aay*s ,7 0 drnay; and they sought him axuon; their 
kinsfolk and acquaintance. 

mnd when they found him not, they turned back a^ain 
to Jerusalem, seekinis him. 

«jnd it came to pass, th.-t after three aays they foind 
him in the temple, sitting in the mlast of the doctors, 
both hearing them, and asking them questions. 

And ail that heard him ware astonished at his 
uaderstanaing and answers. 

*4jid when they saw him, they wex-e aiiiazed; and his 
mother said unto him, '^Bon, why hast thou thus dealt with 
U3? behold, thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing. 

And he said '^ito them, Ho¥^ is it that ye sought me? 
wist ye not that i must be about my Father’s business? 

*uia they understood not the saying which he spaxe 
unto them. 

ana he want down with them, and came to Nazareth, and 
was sub,)ect unto them; but his mother kept ail these 
sayings in her heart. 

xuid Jesus increased in wfisdom and stature, and in 
favour with Bod and man. 

meaitations 

Jiv-e us a measure of wisdom, 0 fhou Boy of Nazareth, 
that we may know something of I’hy faith and coara e. The 
caravan of our life passes on. Oux‘ himss, our parents are 
anxious for us as yours were in the aays of yore. Give 
US to see ourselves as livin_ Thy -way of life. Oux* hearts 
yearn, v/e watch and pray. dnable us to run as Pheiniades,
