CHAPTER I 


A STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM: 

THE PURPOSE OF THE INVESTIGATION 

At the conclusion of the marking of the candidates 1 
papers in the English 3 Examination which was conducted by 
the Department of Education of the Province of Alberta in 
June 1943, the committee in charge was somewhat disappointed 
over the results obtained. Despite the refinements in exam¬ 
ination techniques which had been adopted to ensure an 
adequate discrimination between the abilities of the various 
candidates, the committee found on examining the distribution 
of the results that there was an inadequate spread, that is, 
that the results tended to be "bunched” together. In fact, 
it was the opinion of the committee that such a degree of 
"bunching” might tend to invalidate the examination as a 
discriminating measure of ability. With a very narrow range 
of scores the possibility of dividing the candidates into 
the categories H, A, B, C, and D with any degree of relia¬ 
bility is rather small, since as the range becomes smaller, 
the frequencies of each class interval become correspondingly 
larger. 

With few class intervals and large class frequencies, 
it is quite apparent that it is difficult to subdivide the 
population into categories that represent significant dif-

ferences. This seemed to be the point to which the English 
examination results were approaching. 

The committee rather felt that, in view of the 
objectivity of the examination and of the other devices used, 
the distribution of results should be more nearly like that 
obtained in the mathematical subjects. 

For the sake of comparison, in addition to the graphs 
of distributions for English during the past three years, 
there are here presented the graphs 1 of the distributions 
for Physics 2, Algebra 2 and Social Studies 3 in the year 
1943. 



!The Graphs shown here are made from the actual charts 
drawn for Department of Education, Alberta.

Figures 1, 2, and 3 represent graphically the fre¬ 
quency distributions of the results of the English 3 
examinations for the years 1943, 1942 and 1941 respectively. 
From these, the following information in Table I is easily 
observable.

It will be noted that the actual range of scores is 
less than two-thirds of the possible range. However, from 
the graphs it is quite noticeable that the scores of a very 
large number of candidates lie within a much smaller range. 

On the other hand, Figures 4, 5 and 6, which show the 
frequency distributions for Social Studies 3, Physics 2, and 
Algebra 3, respectively for the year 1943, display much wider 
ranges with no abnormal bunching at any part of the range. 

The following data are noticeable in contrast with

In an effort to determine the cause of this alleged 
distortion, the examination results were inspected. It was no 
ticed that the marks assigned by the instructors for the 
candidates 1 tern reading, that is, the Part I A Score} were 
in general fifteen to thirty percent higher than the marks 
obtained by the same candidates on the Department’s written 
test in Literature, that is, on the Part 1 B Score. Of neces¬ 
sity, the teachers’ marks could not parallel the marks earned 
by the students on the written test, for as the marks on the 
Part I B Test reached the higher percentages the teachers*

the format of the English 3 examination are given in Appendix

marks attained the upper limit of 100% beyond which they could 
not go. Hence, the effect of the teachers’ marks would seem 
to be to raise the lower percentages and at the same time keep 
the upper percentages stationary. This is precisely what the 
graphs seem to indicate, namely, that the lower percentages 
were being displaced from their normal position and thrown in 
with those higher in the scale. 

The problem then to be investigated is as follows: 

"IS THE TEACHERS’ PART I A SCORE’ THE CAUSE OF THE INADEQUATE 
SPREAD AND OF THE "BUNCHING” OF THE RESULTS?" However, other 
effects as they preseht themselves mil be studied.

CHAPTER II 


METHOD OF THE INVESTIGATION 


Through the kindness of Mr. B.E. Walker and his staff 
of the Examinations Branch, Department of Education, the re¬ 
cords of all the students who wrote the Departmental Exam¬ 
inations in lune 1943 were made available. These records, 
as far as the English 3 and Social Studies 3 are concerned, 
were transcribed onto cards specially printed for the purpose. 
A sample card filled in with the actual marks of a student 
is shown below.

An explanation of the different marks listed on the 
card follows: 

(1) This is the mark assigned by the teacher based 
on the students reading and study of the prescribed texts - 
maximum 100 - and is deferred to as the Part I A Score or 
the Literature A mark. 

(2) This is the mark obtained by the candidate on 
the Departments written test on Literature - maximum 100 - 
and is referred to as the Literature B mark. 

(3) This is the Language A mark and is the mark as¬ 
signed to Question 5 of the Literature paper for its com¬ 
position value by a separate committee using a special 
language marking technique - maximum 30. 

(4) The mark for the written language test - maximum 70. 

(5) The combined literature mark. Marks 1 and 2 are 
added together and divided by 2, giving a maximum of 100%. 

(6) The combined mark for language. Marks 3 and 4 
are added together, giving a possible maximum of 100%. 

(7) The total mark for English. This is obtained 
by adding marks 5 and 6 together - possible maximum 200. 

(8) This is the n raw-score" and is obtained by 
halving the marks in .7, Maximum 100. It is from the marks 
in this space that the raw score distribution Is made. 

(9) The Transmuted Score. This is obtained from 8 
by using a transmuting scale which changes the range of the 
raw scores to a range 0-100. Thus the highest mark In 8

becomes 100$ and the lowest becomes 0. This is the mark 
of -which the candidate receives notification, 

(10) The grade-letters, H,A,B,C,D, according to the 
marks in 9. H = 80 plus, A s 65 plus, B s 50 plus, C = 40 
plus, D » less than 40, 

(11) This is the investigator’s mark, called ’’Score 
- A”, and is the total of marks 6 and 2. The Literature A 
mark has been left out of the computation. Maximum 200. 

(12) Mark 11 is halved giving a maximum 100. 

(13) Using a similar scale to that used by the De¬ 
partment in 9, the marks in 12 are transmuted to a range 

0 - 100 . 

(14) Grade letters - (as in 10 above) applied to 
the marks in 13. 

(15) Confidential mark. This is a reference mark 
only, and is assigned by the Principal of the school to 
indicate his opinion of the candidate’s work during the year. 
It may also be viewed as the Principal’s prediction of the 
candidate’s score for the examination. It does not enter 
into the computation. 

(IS) The mark for Question 5 of the Language paper, 
that is, for the construction of a paragraph of prose. The 
evaluating committee is the same as marked for 3, and the tech- 
nique used is the same. Maximum 10. 

(17) The mark for Question 5 of the Literature paper.

This is a question to test the candidate’s knowledge of the 
canons of literature and his appreciation. The question is 
marked now for literary content in distinction to the mark 
given in space 3 which was the language value of the same 
writing. Maximum for the literature answer is 10. 

(18) Mark for Social Studies content of the Social 
Studies paper. Maximum 80. 

(19) Mark for the Language value of the Social 
Studies answers. Maximum 20. 

(20) Total Raw-Score for Social Studies - Marks 18 
and 19 are added. 

(21) Transmutation of 20 to a range - 0 - 100. 

(22) Grade letters of 21, similar to 10 above.

Two colours of cards were used, one for urban students the 
other for rural students, in case it should be desirable 
to study the effects on each group separately. A card was 
made for each of the 3320 students who wrote on English 3. 

For those who wrote both English 3 and Social Studies 3, 
the marks in both subjects were transcribed. 

A sample of about three hundred Literature papers 
and the corresponding language papers were obtained. From 
these examination papers the marks of Question 5 on the 
Literature ancl Question 5 on the Language were obtained and 
marked.on the cards. 

The Confidential Reports of the* Principals of each 
school were obtained from the Department. From these reports, 
the confidential marks of the candidates who wrote the sample 
examination papers which were being used were obtained. 

Thus the complete information on each member of the 
distribution population was available to the investigator. 

Each card was carefully scrutinized to see trends, influ¬ 
encing factors etc. 

It was decided that, for the work dealing with the 
primary object of the investigation, the complete population 
would be used while for the study of."other incidental effects" 
such as the correlations between the various parts-yof the 
examination, the data derived from the sample would be used. 

A graph of the frequency distribution of the sample, 
(Figure 17) is shown. It will be seen that it resembles the

the graph of the distribution of the whole population. The 
almost complete coincidence of the two distributions is more 
clearly seen from the ogives in Figure 16, showing the cu¬ 
mulative percentage curve of the two distributions as well 
as the mean and medial points. Comparing the frequency 
distribution of the sample and the whole population in res¬ 
pect to ’’raw score”, we find:

Thus it will be seen that for practical purposes the sample 
is representative of the whole population. 

From there on, the investigation proceeds by making 
comparisons of distributions and measuring correlations.

CHAPTER III 


THE EFFECT OF . THE PART I A SCORE 
ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE FINAL SCORE 

The principal object of this investigation is to de¬ 
termine whether or not the marks given by the teacher for the 
students 1 work in the reading and study of the recommended 
texts, that is, the Part I A Score or the Literature A mark, 
is the cause of the inadequate spread of the "raw scores" or 
of any abnormal bunching of them around the middle of the 
range. In other words, what Is needed is the answer to the 
question,"what effect does the Part I A mark have on the re¬ 
maining portion of a candidate’s marks (the Score-A) when the 
two are combined together to form his "raw-score"?" 

This effect can be considered in two ways. It can be 
viewed, either from total effects, that is, the effect of the 
distribution of Part I A marks on the distribution of the 
Score-A marks in producing the distribution of the "Raw Scores", 
or It can be viewed in the light of the changes made in the 
individual scores. In this chapter, the former will be■con¬ 
sidered, while the latter effect will be discussed In the next 
chapter. 

The procedure in this chapter will be, first, to study 
the distribution of the "Raw Scores"; secondly, to study the 
distributions of the components of the "Raw Scores" namely the 
Part I A mark and the Score-A marks; and finally, to discuss the 
mutual effect of the "Part I A marks" and the' "Score-A marks in 
producing the "Raw Scores".

A casual inspection of the accompanying graph, of the 
frequency distribution of the "raw scores", Figure 8, as cur¬ 
rently obtained reveals a figure in which over one-sixth of 
the frequency population falls within one class interval near 
the middle. The surrounding class intervals seem large also. 
It is this situation apparently which caused the committee to 
suspect abnormal crowding near the middle of the range e 

However, a mathematical scrutiny of the figure shows 
that it is not the least leptokurtic. 1 In fact its kurtosis 2 
is practically zero. Neither is there any sign of skewness. 
The distribution is almost symmetrical as will be seen readily 

1 Leptokurtic - sharply peaked. 2 Kurtosis - measure of 

peakedness.

when one observes that the median, mean and approximate mode 
are 54.5, 54.2 and 54 respectively. A normal curve, 1 when 
superimposed coincides almost so completely that it is dif¬ 
ficult to distinguish them on the diagram. 

Assuming that the abilities in English measured by the 
English 3 Examination are normally distributed, the opinion, 
then, that there is abnormal crowding near the middle of the 
range is unsubstantiated. However, it does appear that the 
ranged, which extends from 27 to 87, that is, only 61 percent 
of the possible range, is quite inadequate for the purpose of 
discriminate testing. This will be investigated presently. 

At the moment, however, it is desirable to examine the fre¬ 
quencies of the component scores that go to make up the ’’raw 
score”. 


iThe normal curves throughout this work were constructed 
from the Tables of Ordinates of the Normal Probability Curve, 
as given in Walker; Statistical Methods, 1943 , Holt & Co. 

c 

The tern ”range” is used throughout this work to indicate 
the number of score intervals between the highest and lowest 
scores. Thus inadequacy of range” is to be considered as syn¬ 
onymous with ’’paucity of intervals”. The difference lies in 
the method of approach to the remedy for the situation; in the 
former, ways and means are sought to widen the range while in.' 
the latter, the remedy is sought in an increase of intervals by 
means of introducing fractions of marks. Both seek to increase 
the number of intervals in the range. The investigator has 
adopted the former, since it is thought that in a subject like 
English the discrimination limen is large and not well adapted 
to fractional marking.

In Table V which follows, a tabulation of the candidates* 
marks on Part I A is given. This is followed in Table VI by 
a tabulation of the **Score-A* T marks. "Score-A" is computed for 
each candidate by disregarding the marks assigned by the teach¬ 
er in Part IA; that is, the mark for Part I B (maximum 100) 
is added to the total language mark (maximum 100) and the sum 
divided by 2. This gives a score on a percentage basis in¬ 
dependent of the teacher’s score. 

The tables are followed by the graphs of these frequency' 
distributions.

n raw score** in Figure 8. In the Part I A Score, the mean, 
median and approximate mode are in slightly different pos¬ 
itions; the values of these are: mean 61, mode 60 and median 
58.9. although this latter is an actual 60. In superimposing 
a normal curve, we note that the class frequency at the mean 
of the normal distribution is 534 as compared with 550 in 
the actual distribution; the actual frequency polygon is then 
very slightly more peaked than the normal. Apart from this 
the distribution practically coincides with the normal, This 
is all the more remarkable in view of the fact that the 
teachers 1 marks are given only in multiples of five. 

It is quite evident then that the teachers have 
gauged rather accurately the work of the students as a group, 
that is^if the normal curve is a reliable index of this. 

Consider now the distribution of the Score-A as re¬ 
presented by the frequency polygon in Figure 10. The Score- 
A, as previously pointed out, is computed by leaving the 
teachers* marks, Part I A, out of the calculation. It re¬ 
presents the percentage obtained by the student on the De¬ 
partment’s written competitive tests only. Despite the fact 
that the omission of the teacher’s mark may change the weigh¬ 
ting of the other marks, yet the Score-A represents what 
would prevail if it should be decided to discontinue the 
Part I A mark. 

The figure presented in the graph is quite similar in

contour to that of the Part I A Score shown in Figure 9. 

Here again we notice that the mean, median and mode are in 
almost identically the same position; the values are 49.5, 

49.8, and 50 respectively. Likewise, the frequency at the 
mean for the normal distribution is slightly less than the 
actual. Again, we observe how the actual distribution and 
the normal distribution practically coincide. 

Again it is found that, if normality of distribution 
is accepted as an indication of the reliability of a test 
in English, the score on the Departments written tests, like 
the marks assigned by the teachers, is also an accurate meas¬ 
ure of the pupil’s abilities in the subject. 

The next step is to study the effects of the two dis¬ 
tributions on one another when brought together in the compilation 
of the raw score. It follows quite naturally that, since tie 
Score-A distribution is a series of values pitched at a lower 
degree in general than the series comprised by the Part I A 
distribution, the mutual effect would be a moderating one. 

An examination of figure 12 shows precisely this effect. The 
distribution of the Score-A is centred on the score 50 line; 
that of the Part I A is centred on the score 60 line; the 
resultant distribution, n raw score*’, is situated almost mid¬ 
way between theip, that is, it is centred on the score 54 line. 

The apparent effect then of the Part I A Score op the Score-A

has been simple to raise the mean about five points or in other 
words, to transplant the distribution without much distortion 
five points higher on the scale. This is really of no consequence 
since the pass mark is not a fixed point on the scale but 
rather a value determined after the marking which will cause 
a certain percentage of the candidates to fail. 

This effect is possibly more clearly shown in Figure 
11 where the continuous ogive at the left represents the 
"Score-A" and the dotted ogive represents the "Raw Score". 

These two ogives describe the cumulative frequencies both 
numerically and by percentages for the two distributions. 

It will be seen that the two curves "parallel" one another 
over the greater part of the range until the extreme limit 
is reached. In effect this means that on the average the 
teachers 1 marks were such as to virtually raise the score 
on the written tests by approximately five percent. Since 
the teacher’s mark accounts for only one-quarter of the raw 
score mark, then five marks on the raw score is equivalent 
to twenty marks on the teacher’s score. Hence, it follows 
that on the basis of the 1943 examination only, either the 
teachers’ marks were twenty percent "too high" or the Depart¬ 
ment’s marks were correspondingly "too low", if it is de¬ 
sired to make them mutually ineffective. 

(It might be noted here, that whereas the preceding

argument considers the situation from the view-point, "ef¬ 
fect of teachers* marks on the Department*s marks in 
producing the raw score", it might also be considered from 
the view-point,"effect of the Department’s marks on the 
teacher’s marks in producing the raw score". In other 
words it is not to be assumed that one is correct and the 
other incorrect. ) 

It is not necessary nor is It even to be expected, 
except according to the laws of chance, that the two dis¬ 
tributions would coincide. This could only happen on con¬ 
dition that the many variable factors remained constant and 
that the rating scales of each were tuned to each other. 

The purpose served by the two types is that one might com¬ 
pensate for the defect in the other. If the two were cons¬ 
tantly in unison, one or the other could be discarded. 

The mutual effect, then, of the two distributions - 
Part I A and Score-A - on one another may be summed as fol¬ 
lows. Each distribution is by itself an almost normal 
distribution and when, by the method of computation now 
prevailing, they are brought together to give the raw score, 
the resulting distribution is likewise an almost normal 
distribution. Hence, the surmise, which prevailed prior 
to the investigation, that the Part I A Score might be 
exercising a distorting influence on the results of the 
written tests, is not substantiated. Further, the effect of

combining the two distributions has been to give a resultant 
distribution (the distribution of the raw score) centred 
about a mean point higher in the scale. That is, the Part I 
A distribution with mean point at 61 when combined with Score 
-A distribution centred about mean point 49.5, produced a Raw 
Score distribution with mean point at 54.2. Speaking non- 
technieally we may say that the effect has been to move the 
distribution up the scale by five points. 

It must kept in mind, however, that we have been 
dealing with "total effects" only, that is, the effects in 
so far as they concern the group as a whole. Effects on the 
individual scores are not being considered at this point. 
These will be dealt with in a later chapter. 

The Effect of Part I A on the Pass Mark 

The pass-mark in Alberta Departmental Examinations is 
not a fixed score in the sense that it is a certain percent¬ 
age of items on the examination paper answered correctly re¬ 
gardless of all other factors. The following method is used. 

The answer papers are evaluated according to a scale 
that may or may not add up to a total of one hundred. 1

The results are tabulated and from those forming the lower 
end of the distribution a pre-determined percentage of the 
entire number of candidates are declared failures In other 
words, the pass mark is the score at a certain percentile 
of the distribution. The marks of the scale are then trans¬ 
muted so that this particular score becomes 40, while the 
lowest mark and the highest mark made on the examination 
become 0 and 100 respec timely. The other marks are then 
determined from the transmutation scale. Figure 13 illustrates 
the transmutation scale which was constructed for use with 
the Score-A marks. Note that the highest mark below 40, that 
is, the highest mark of a failing student is a predetermined 
37; also the highest mark below 50 is always 47; the reason 
is obvious. 

On the 1943 examination, it was predetermined to fail 
15# of the candidates. Following the method described above, 
it was found that failing 15# of the candidates would set 
the pass mark according to raw-score at 45 and that the lowest 
mark in B category was 52. When the same procedure was fol¬ 
lowed for the Score-A results, the pass mark became 40 and 
the lowest mark in the B category, 46. It must be pointed out 
here that although 15% of 3320 is 498, yet through unevenness 
of distribution over the class interval, only 461 candidates 
became failures according to the raw-score while 519 were 
included when calculations were made on the Score-A distri-

tribution. This makes a slight difference. 

The effect, then, of the Part I A Score on the Score- 
A in regard to the pass mark, is to raise the pass mark from 
40 to 45 and to raise B Category from 46 plus to 52 plus. 

This is in accordance with what was seen previously where the 
effect was to move the distribution approximately five points 
higher along the scale. 

The Effect on the Kange 

While range is not a very effective measure of the 
central tendency of a distribution, yet occasionally it is 
worth considering. Thus an extremely small range might 
delight us if we were interested in seeing how little a given 
phenomenon deviated from a standard. On the other hand where 
we wish to discriminate between several degrees of effect- 
iveness, we prefer a wide range provided the class intervals 
are well filled out. Thus it is in the case under consider¬ 
ation; we want to distinguish several degrees of ability in 
English. Hence, it is desirable to have a fairly wide range, 
so that the frequency in any class interval will not be greater 
than, let us say, ten percent of the total. 

In the distributions under consideration, out of a 
possible range in each case, Score-A has a range of 17 to 83 
or a total of 67, Part I A Score has a range of 20 to 100 or

a total of 81, while the Raw Score has a range of 27 to 87 
or a total of 61. Thus, it is seen that, when united to¬ 
gether, the effect of the Part I A Score, with its wide 
range of 81, on the Score-A's range of 67 is to reduce it to 
61. (This may seem rather strange but a study of the in¬ 
dividual scores constituting the extremities of the ranges 
shows that the effect has been to draw these within the 
deeper part of the distribution; the individuals constituting 
the extremities were not the same in each distribution) 

It is noted also that the lower end of the range was 
raised from 17 to 27 while the upper end was increased from 
83 to only 87. That the lower end should receive a greater 
increase than the upper end is accounted for possibly by rea¬ 
son of the fact that the possible difference in scores for 
the two distributions is greater for the lower end of the 
range than the upper. Thus, for example, a candidate who 
received 17 marks on the Score-A could receive any one of 
the marks of Part I A from 20 to 100, all of which are greater 
whereas the candidate who received 83 on the Score-A can 
receive only marks of 85 to 100 which are greater but might 
also receive any one of the marks of 20 to 80 which are less. 

The effect does not seem greatly significant part¬ 
icularly in view of the fact that it has already been shown 
that the means of the distributions have been raised by ap¬ 
proximately five points. Since it is customary to associate

median rather than mean with the range, it is just as well 
to state here for the sake of the record, that the effect 
of the Part I A Score on the median of the Score-A dis¬ 
tribution has been to raise it by approximately five points, 
that is, from 49.8 to 54.5. This follows from previous 
statements to the effect that the means and medians of the 
three distributions are practically coincident. 

A reference to the other ranges will prove rather 
interesting. Thus, for the Score-A distribution, the inter¬ 
quartile range,or the middle 50$ of the scores has a range 
of only 12.6 marks; the plus and minus sigma range, or 
middle 68$ of the scores, has a range of only 19.4 marks; 
while the Pg Q - P^ 0 range or middle 80$ of the scores has 
a range of only 25 marks. The distribution of the Haw Score 
has ranges so similar to the Score-A distribution that the 
effect of the Part I A distribution on its make-up may be 
considered almost negligible. These ranges are as follows: 
Interquartile range, 12.8; plus and minus sigma range, 18.3; 
and the P Q q - P^q range, 24. 

The investigation substantiates quite fully the fact 
that there is an inadequate range!in the marks. It shows 
also quite clearly, that since the ranges of the Raw Score 
and the Score-A are equally narrow, that the effect is in no 
way attributable to the influence of the Part I A marks. 

By way of illustration of the effect of a wide range

there is here presented, a tabulation of the frequencies for 
the same number of candidates the distribution remaining 
normal, but with the range increased to a maximum of 100. 

In the table, the Raw Score frequencies have been placed in 
an added column, for the sake of comparison. The graph, 

1 E - Ni multiplied by respective ordinate values of x 
from^the Table of Ordinates of a Unit Normal Curve.^

Actual Distribution.

(Figure 14}, shows the two distributions on the same scale. 

It is quite clear how much more accurate the subdivision 
becomes when the class frequencies are small and how much 
more meaningful is the distinction between a Grade A and 
a Grade D. This is, it seems, what the committee had in 
mind, when they complained of the crowding near the middle 
of the range. 

It should be clearly understood at this point that 
this desirable condition cannot be brought about by the 
method of transmutation of scores currently used by the 
Department. This method of transmutation changes the range to 
a - 0 - 100 range but it leaves the frequencies the same. 

This is illustrated in the following simplified example 
where the marks of the 3000 candidates ranged from 50 to 60.

It will be seen that the effect of the transmutation 
is merely to separate the scores with blank space. It does 
not change the size of the frequencies. Some of the evils 
of a narrow range are also illustrated. In the example, It 
is seen that more students (over 1/3 of the total) received 
H standing than any other, because it was impossible to 
make finer subdivisions. Further, the difference In marks 
between those who scored E and those who failed is so small 
that it might in many cases be the result of testing error. 

The remedy for this condition seems to be in a stand¬ 
ardisation of the examination paper before the marking is 
done, that is, the various items which constitute the paper 
should be properly weighted. This can be done by selecting 
a sample of about 200 papers and marking the answers right and 
wrong, or in the case of judgments or opinions by evaluating 
the answers as A,B,C or D. A frequency curve of correctness 
is then calculated and values are assigned to the various answers 
on the basis of their respective frequencies. The committee 
should be able to work out the details of this method. Before 
the final computation is made, It might be necessary to norm¬ 
alize the Part I A Score, If it Is not already normally dis¬ 
tributed , and to scale it according to the scale of the writ¬ 
ten tests. The combining ,of the,,Part I A Score with the marks 
for the written portion should be the last step In the cal¬ 
culation. With this procedure, an almost normal distribution 
over a complete range will be obtained.

CHAPTER TV 


THE EFFECT OF THE PART I A MARK 
ON THE INDIVIDUAL SCORES 

In the preceding chapter we studied the effects of 
the Part I A mark on the distribution of the final score 
considered in its totality. It was seen that there was 
no distorting effect of any consequence produced on the 
Score-A distribution in forming the Raw Score distribution 
from it. It does not necessarily follow that each individual 
in the distribution was effected in precisely the same man¬ 
ner as the entire distribution. Indeed, the effect on the 
individual member of the distribution is a very important 
aspect of the study. It is this effect which is to be the 
subject of the investigation in this chapter. 

Effect on the Individual Marks 

For each candidate the mark which he would have 
scored if Part I A had not been part of the examination has 
been computed and is referred to as his Score-A mark. To 
compute this, the mark on his literature paper (100%) is ad¬ 
ded to the total marks for language (100%) and the sum divided 
by 2. This mark is to be compared with his final score as 
currently obtained. For this, the Department’s Raw Scores are 
used. A Raw Score is computed by adding the Part I A mark to

the Part I B mark and dividing by 2; this gives the mark for 
literature; the literature mark and the total language mark, 
each 100%, are added together and divided by 2. This gives 
the Raw Score for English based on 100%. To be clear on the 
point the "Score-A" mark excludes the Part I A mark whereas 
the Raw Score includes it. 

In the accompanying tables is shown the effect of the 
Part I A mark on the Score-A mark, in producing a Raw Score. 
This is done by pointing out for each Score-A mark, the 
amount of change expressed in marks that has been brought 
about by including the Part I A mark in the ‘calculation. In 
Table X this has been done for the entire group of candidates. 
Tables XI and XII report the findings separately for rural 
and urban candidates. 

Thus, on the first line of the table, one and only 
one, candidate would have received seventeen marks if the 
Part I A marks had not entered into the calculation. From 
the table we learn, as we go across the first line, that one 
candidate received a Raw Score which was 10 marks in excess of 
his Score-A mark. Thus the Raw Score of this candidate was 
increased from 17 to 27 by including the Part I A mark in the 
calculation. 

In the table the column headings indicate differences 
between Raw Score and Score-A, that is, they are the deviations 
of the Raw Score from the Score-A. If the Score-A is increased

the deviation is considered positive, if decreased it is 
considered negative. If no change occurs it will be listed 
under the 0 heading. The numbers along the left hand mar¬ 
gin are the Score-A marks which will be considered in each 
row. The numbers in the main body of the table are the 
numbers of candidates whose marks were effected as indicated 
in the column heading. 

For a further illustration, let us consider a Score-A 
of £8. Going down the left hand margin to 28 and then reading 
across the row we find one candidates score remained un¬ 
changed, one received an increase of two,another received an 
increase of five, two received an increase of six, three re¬ 
ceived an increase of seven, two received an increase of eight, 
and finally one received an increase of nine. This means that 
of the eleven candidates whose written work was evaluated at 
28$ by the examiners, one received a raw score of 28, one 30, 
one 33, two 34, three 35, two 36 and finally one received 37, 
by reason of the influence of their teachers* marks. This 
range of 28 to 37 when the marks are transmuted becomes a range 
of 2-22 or a total range of 21. 

For a further illustratioh let us select a row with 
an extremely wide divergence - for example, the last row on 
the first page of the table, Score-A 52. Here, we observe 
that the deviations range from -6 to 16; This means that 
although the written papers of the 122 candidates were all

Deviations of the Candidates* Raw Score from the Corresponding Score-A

valued at 52, their Raw Scores, through, the effect of the Part 
I A mark, ranged all the way from 46 to 68 for a total range of 
23 marks; these, when converted to transmuted scores, become 
a range of 41-73 for a total range of 53 marks. It is true 
that this happens to be taking a sample at the point where 
the divergence is greatest. Yet, nevertheless, the fact 
that it is not an isolated case, and the fact that such can 
happen, that candidates whose written work is apparently of 
equal calibre can receive final standings which range from 
the lowest Grade C’s to the highest Grade A*s, makes one 
question the validity of the test. Can such an examination 
be a reliable test of ability? Mere the candidates* writ¬ 
ten papers really of equal value? Were the teachers trying to pass 
the students in spite of the written tests? Or, Is the result 
genuine and the divergence really due to the operation of 
many chance factors? 

These are questions which prove interesting. A 
close study of the situation leads the investigator to ac¬ 
cept the view that the results are genuine attempts at ac¬ 
curacy and that the deviations are due to the operation of 
a great many extraneous factors, including the human element 
involved in the evaluation of the papers and In the evalua¬ 
tion of the candidate's work during the year. That the de¬ 
viations are due to chance rather than concerted effort is 
substantiated by a consideration of the normality of the

distribution of the deviations as shown by the histogram 
in Figure 15. The mean of the deviations as calculated 
from the totals of Table X is only 4.7# (the same as was 
shown in the last chapter when dealing with the change of 
position of the mean). The indication seems to be that the 
teachers T marks for the candidates are based on a higher 
point of reference than that of the Department. This ac¬ 
counts for a considerable portion of the deviations, as is 
evidenced by the fact that the correlation of the Raw Score 
and the Score-A is f.90, a very high correlation. 

This difference in the point of reference does af¬ 
fect the score slightly since it changes the relativity. 

If the teachers’ marks are pitched £5% higher than the De¬ 
partment’s, then the teachers* actual range becomes £5-100 
instead of £5-l£5 or 0-100. The upper end becomes distorted 
because the total is limited to 100. To correct for this 
error it might be necessary to transform the scores of Part 
I A by a process similar to McCall’s T-Scaling device. 1 
But, Whether the advantage derived would be commensurate with 
the time and expense involved, is quite problematical. 

The better way of accomplishing this vould be to

Methods, page 181-4, Holt & Co. 1945.

Urban candidates is 3.36; for Rural candidates 5.34.

standardize the teachers’ evaluations. Not only would this 
correct the preceding fault, but it would also minimize the 
effect of another cause of the deviations, the present lack 
of standards. With 600 teachers, each evaluating according 
to his own standard, there is bound to be a considerable 
amount of variation with consequent unfairness to the can¬ 
didates. If a set of standard values were set up to guide 
the teacher in forming his estimate, there would be a great¬ 
er probability of uniformity. 

Further, if the suggestion made in the preceding 
chapter in regard to widening the range were carried out, 
the undesirable aspect, whereby the candidates are moved 
into other gradings, would be considerably moderated. The 
dividing lines of the different categories would be farther 
apart, and consequently 25 marks, the raw-score value of 
Part I A, added to any Score-A could not possibly raise a score 
more than two categories. 

When the range is not very wide* the Part I A mark 
may constitute more than an influence of 25$ on the final 
transmuted score. Its influence is 25$ of the Raw Score but 
in the process of transmutation this value is changed. Thus, 
in the 1943 examina tion, the range was 27-87, a total of 
67$ of the possible range. Let us see the total possible 
influence of the Part I A mark on the two end scores of the 
range by making the calculations with Part I A as zero and

It will be seen that in each of the Raw Scores,the 
Part I A has a maximum value of 25 marks, but that when the 
scores are transmuted its value is increased in the one case 
to 50 marks and in the other to 36. Note that the Part I A 
has a maximum value of 25 marks and not 25$; it may be greater 
than 25$ of the Raw Score or the Transmuted Score. Thus, 
in the first case, it is 25 out of 52 or 48$; in the second 
case, it is 25 out of 87 or almost 29$. 

Since this condition is an outcome of the device of 
lengthening an inadequate rqnge by transmutation, it should 
be possible to avoid it either by arranging factors so as to 
produce a complete range or by transmuting the Part I A and 
Score-A separately before combining them to form the final 
score. 

Effect on the Individual Grades 

Another interesting way of presenting the matter com¬ 
prising the earlier part of this chapter is to review the 
effect which the Part I A mark plays in the allocation of the 
Grade letter of the individual. 

The method used is similar to the one used at the be¬ 
ginning of the chapter. It was pointed out there how the 
"Score-A" was determined. These scores were then sorted into 
a frequency distribution. 1

From this, using the same method that is used by the De¬ 
partment, a transmutation scale (Figure 13) was made. The 
transmuted scores of Score-A, were then converted to the 
Grade Letters H,A,B,C,D. 

The candidates* file cards were sorted into five 
piles according to the Grades assigned by the Department 
on the basis of the transmuted value of the Raw Scores. 

The number of candidates falling into each category may be 
read from the column at the left in Table XIII. For pur¬ 
poses of comparison these have been further subdivided into 
Rural and Urban as well), thus the square at the upper left 
hand corner states that 37 rural candidates and 39 urban 
candidates, a total of 76 altogether received Grade H stand¬ 
ing. 

Each pile of cards was then sorted out according to 
the Grades determined on the basis of the transmutations of 
Score-A. The totals of these may be read along the hori¬ 
zontal rows. Thus, of the 76 candidates who received E stand¬ 
ing on the basis of the total Raw-Score only 65 would have 
received the same standing on the basis of the Score-A; 
the others would have been reduced to A standing. 

The changes in grading which would be made in the De-

partment’s Grade A, B, C, D, candidates if the Part I A 
mark were to be eliminated, may be read from the chart. 

The last row gives the total of the columns. From this, 
we learn that by disregarding the Part I A mark, 116 instead 
of 76 would have received H, 667 instead of 527 would have 
received A, 1384 instead of 1438 would have received B, 

634 instead of 818 would have received C and 519" instead 
of 461^ would have received D category or failure. 

If we express these figures as percentages based on 
the Score-A figures, the above statement would read like the 
following. Of all the candidates who would have received an 
H standing on the written tests alone, 34,5$ received a low¬ 
er standing by reason of the teachers* Part I A marks; si¬ 
milarly, a net 21$ of the Grade A’s were downgraded. At the 
same time, 11.1$ of those who would have failed received 
higher standing. As a result of the down grading of the H's 
and A f s, and the upgrading of the D f s, 3,9$ more received B 
standing and 29$ more received C standing. 

Considering the changes in grading for rural and urban 
candidates separately, we notice similar effects. For the 
rural candidates, 24.5$ of the Grade H and 16$ of the Grade 
A were downgraded and 20.2$ of the D*s were upgraded as a 

^The difference between these is due to unevenness of 
distribution. Both aimed at being 498, that is, 15$ of 
the total.

result of the teachers 1 Part I A marks; Grades B and C were 
increased by 6,5$ and £1.9$ respectively. Of the candidates from 
urban schools, 41.8$ of the Grade H and £5.3$ of the Grade A*s 
received lower grading. However, in contrast to the rural 
candidates, the percentage of failures was also increased by 
11.5$. The increases in Grades B and C were 0.8$ and 4.0.£$ 
respectively. 

Table XTV displays the change in grading in another way. 
In the column marked, "Raw Score" we find in the R rows the 
percentages of rural students in each category when both the 
written tests and the Part I. A marks are combined; similarly, 
the U rows give the percentages of urban candidates in each 
category and the T rows indicate what percentage of all the 
candidates fall into each grade. For example, of the 1876 
rural candidates, 1.97$ of this number are grade H, 13.7$ 
are Grade A, and so on. In the next column, marked "Score- 
A", is given the percentages of each group, Rural, Urban, or 
Total, which would, fall into each grade, on the basis of the 
written tests alone without the Part I A marks. The third 
column-marked "Difference", shows the extent of the effect of 
the Part I A marks, in terms of difference in percentage. 

(For those who may wish to do so, the table affords an 
opportunity of comparing the results of the rural and urban 
candidates in the subject for this particular examination. 

Compare adjacent R f s and U f s in each square).

The effect of the Part I A Score is clarified by a 
study of these charts. Briefly, the effect is a central¬ 
izing one, that is, the frequencies at the extremes seem 
to be reduced and the central ones, the B's and C's, are 
increased. If we consider the Departments distribution 
of grades, based on the Raw Scores, which'include the Part 
I A marks, and compare it with the distribution of grades 
based oh the Scores-A, which exclude it, we perceive this 
centralizing effect. In the earlier part of this chapter 
we stressed the effect of Part I A in raising the mean; in 
the last chapter, we showed its effect in condensing the 
range; in this section we see the complete picture of both 
these effects.

CHAPTER V 


OTHER EFFECTS AND RELATIONSHIPS 

The work contained in this chapter is not a necessary- 
part of the major topic under discussion. The writer’s prin¬ 
cipal reason for including it is that the information was 
readily available from the work done in the previous chapters 
and may not be so again unless it is specially sought. Further, 
the information given here does have a rounding out effect in 
so as far as it may supply facts dealing with the reliability 
of the present English examination frame-work. 

Relationships of the Literature A (Part I A) 

The purpose of investigating the possible relationships 
of Literature A was done with a view to determining to what 
extent the measure is reliable. In the first place it was 
felt that there ought to be a very high correlation between 
Literature A and Literature B. Presumably both purport to 
measure'' the same matter: Part A is an evaluation of "the stu¬ 
dent’s work in the reading and study of Poetry, Drame and Es¬ 
says n ; Part B is M a test of reading comprehension and literary 
appreciation on ’ sight 1 selections". Ostensibly they are 
quite similar. However, it is found that the correlation 
between the Teachers 1 marks in Literature A and the Depart¬ 
ment’s, 'marks in Literature B is only .46,(P.E. .0092) which while

being a substantial correlation, is nevertheless much smal¬ 
ler than had been anticipated. The correlation was made 
by using the results of the entire group of candidates, and 
so, it is not due to any error of sampling. 

Before discussing the possible causes of this dif¬ 
ference in scoring, let us consider two or three other re¬ 
lationships. The correlations for these were made from a 
sample of examination papers obtained from the Department. 

The reliability of the sample may be determined by 
a comparison of the cumulative percentage frequency ogives 
shown in Figure 16. The means and medians of the two dis¬ 
tributions are almost coincident. The mean of the whole 
population is 54.2 while the mean for the sample is 54.3; 
the median for the whole population is 54.5 while that for 
the sample is 54. It may be taken then that the sample is 
representative of the entire group. 

Using the sample, a correlation was made between the 
Literature A and the total mark for Social Studies. It was 
thought that there was sufficient similarity between the 
processes involved in the study of Literature, and that of 
Social Studies that there should be found an adequate cor¬ 
relation. Both processes involve ability (1) to read in¬ 
tellectual material with comprehension, (2) to pass judg¬ 
ment on what is read, (3) to appreciate the content and

(4) to remember and reconstruct both the ideas which have 
been read and those which have been formed during reading. 
The correlation yielded was rather low, .35,(P.E. .041), 

Another relationship,that between the Literature A 
and Question 5 of the Literature Examination paper, was 
studied. 

Question 5 is as follows: 

T, The reading and study of literature should help a 
student to know a good book when he sees one - to dieting- 
uish,for instance, between the temporary and the permanent, 
the false and the true . v 

With the above statement in mind write an essay in 
which you discuss some of the qualities which enable you 
to recognize a piece of literature as good. You may use 
illustrations from fiction, poetry, essays, or drama, and 
you need not confine yourself to one field...... 

The very nature of this question would lead one to 
expect that there would be a very close relationship be¬ 
tween the scores for this question and the marks assigned 
to Literature A. The information sought in this question 
seems to be precisely what the teaching and study of liter¬ 
ature aims primarily to give. It would seem that the pos¬ 
session of this information by the student would be the 
criterion by which the teacher would judge "whether or not 
the student’s work has been consistently and continuously 
satisfactory throughout the year"»" L

of the Department of Education, 1944, page 28.

However, once again the correlation was less than was anti¬ 
cipated. In this relationship, it reached the almost negligible 
low of .18, (P.E. .039). 

Between the Literature A and the average for the De¬ 
partment’s written tests in English, that is, the Score-A, 
which includes both literature and language, where, on ac¬ 
count of the many factors involved, one would hardly expect 
to find a close relationship, there exists the rather substantial 
correlation of .51, (P.E. ,029). 

What are we to think of these relationships? It is quite 
apparent that no conclusive facts are revealed. All that one 
can do is surmise the reasons for the disappointing relation¬ 
ships and surmises can be quite far from the truth. 

The very low correlation between Literature A and Question 
5 would seem to indicate that the factual knowledge of literary 
criticism studied as a science is not, and is not considered 
by the teacher to be, a dominant aspect of Grade XII English. 
Appreciation of literature is viewed as an art rather than a 
science, something to be felt or accepted on literary faith, 
rather than to be reasoned about or subjected to an analysis. 

This would account for the low correlation; the pupil might 
be satisfactory according to the teacher’s viewpoint but 
when subjected to the fact searching of the examination, he 
is found wanting. Similarly the lack of a high degree of 
correlation between Literature A and Literature B may be part-

ly explained on the basis of lack of standards in judging. 

Many more factors operating over a period of time enter into 
the formation of the teacher’s judgment, whereas the Depart¬ 
ment’s score is based on a single test given at a time which 
may not have been opportune. Estimates of value are often 
distorted because in the mind of the evaluator certain factors 
may receive undue stress whereas objective evaluations may 
be revised to meet the criticisms of many evaluators. 

Hence, it is the opinion of the investigator that if 
definite standards for evaluation were set up, a greater de¬ 
gree of agreement might be attained after a few years. 

( 

Relationships of the Language Parts of the Examination 

On the examination, the candidate’s ability to write 
a paragraph of prose is tested on three separate examination 
papers. First, Question 5 of the Literature paper is evaluated 
independently of the correctness of its literary content for 
its quality as good prose; this is marked on a basis of 30 
and constitutes what is referred to as the Language A score. 
Secondly, Question 5 of the Language paper calls for the 
writing of a paragraph of prose on one of the topic sentences 
selected from about a dozen on a great variety of subjects. 

, a $ 1 1 

This composition is marked on 10 and constitutes a part of 
the Language B marks. Thirdly, the Social Studies paper was

marked, apart from its Social Studies content, for its ex¬ 
cellence as prose writing. This is marked on 20 and forms 
part of the total Social Studies mark. Each of these e- 
valuations was made by using the same special scoring tech¬ 
nique. 

Here we have the marking of three samples of the 
same candidates 1 writing under nearly the same conditions. 

A study of the relationship between them shows a correla¬ 
tion of .28 (P.E. .037) between Language A and Question 5 of 
the Language paper and a correlation of only .23 (P.E. .044) 
between Language H and the Language of the Social Studies paper. 

Despite the fact that we are definitely measuring 
similar abilities the measurements yield only a very low cor¬ 
relation. It would seem that when the candidates are writing 
Literature or Social Studies, their minds are more attentive, 
to recalling content than to the manner of expressing their 
thoughts. But this does not tell the whole story. Other¬ 
wise, there should be substantial correlation between Lan¬ 
guage A and the Language■of the Social Studies examination, 
since both are measured on papers that serve a dual purpose. 

An inspection of the marks reveals that quite generally 
the marks for the language of the Social Studies paper 
were higher than those assigned to the language on the 
Literature paper. Probably the difficulty of content of the 
answer is an important factor; it is perceived that the marks

for the literary content of Question 5 of the Literature 
paper were rather low. It seems reasonable, that if the 
student has only vague ideas on a topic, that the expression 
of his ideas will suffer as a consequence. 

The correlation between the total Language mark and 
the total for Social Studies was .36, (P.E. .040). 

Relationship of Principals 1 Confidential Marks 

A further correlation was worked out between the Trans¬ 
muted Raw Scores or the Department’s Pinal Scores and the marks 
assigned to each candidate by the various school principals 
in their Confidential Reports to the Department. 

These Confidential Marks are intended to be the Prin¬ 
cipal’s estimate of each candidate writing from his school or it 
may be viewed as a prediction of ihat the candidate ought to re¬ 
ceive on the Department’s examination. In this we find a high 
degree of agreement. The correlation between these two marks 
is .7, (P.E. .0205). This might- be taken as an indication that 
in general the examination of 1943 attained results in keeping 
with previous examinations. It Is not to be thought that 
the Principal’s estimate and the Department’s findings are 
in agreement, but merely that the Department has placed the 
candidates in the same relative rank as the Principal has 
done. It must be kept in mind that the Principal forms his

judgment in the light of a comparison between this candidate 
and the attainment of the candidates presented in previous 
years. This point may be a factor in the high correlation 
which was found in this comparison.

CHAPTER VI 


SUMMARY' OF RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS 

1. The Distribution of the Raw Scores of the exam¬ 
ination in English 3 was found to conform almost completely 
with that of a normal distribution. Hence, the opinion that 
there seemed to be abnormal crowding near the middle of the 
range is not substantiated. 

2. Both the Part I A Scores, that is, the marks 
assigned by the teachers on the candidates 1 reading and 
study throughout the year and the Score-A, that is, the 
marks obtained by the candidates on the Department’s written 
tests alone, yield normal distributions. Hence, the feel¬ 
ing that the Part I £ Score was exerting a distorting 
effect on the distribution of the final results when these 
two parts, Part I A and Score-A, were brought together to 
form the Raw Score, Is not valid. 

3. Since the distribution of the Part I A Score has 
a mean value about eleven points higher than that of the 
Score-A, the net effect of combining these two distributions 
is to produce a distribution with a mean value about five 
points higher in the scale than that of the Score-A. This 
means that on the average the teachers’ marks were such as 
to virtually raise the candidates* scores on the written 
tests by approximately five marks.

4. The effect of the Part I A Score on the Score-A 

in regard to the pass mark, is to raise the pass mark from 40 
to 45 and to raise the lowest mark of B category from 46 to 
52. This is in accordance with the previous point where it 
was seen that the effect produced was to move the distribu¬ 
tion of Score-A approximately five points higher in the scale. 
The median was similarly affected. 

5. The effect of Part I A on the range of Score-A is 
to change it from a 17-83 to a 27-87; that is, the width of 
the range was reduced from 67 scale points to 61 points. 

The lower end of the range was raised from 17 to 27 while the 
upper end of the range was augmented only four points from 
83 to 87. 

The Interquartile Range, the Plus and Minus Sigma 

_ I 

Range, and the P 90 -^(£*ange, remained approximately the same 
size, although, of course, their positions were raised in 

the scale. 

The investigation substantiates quite fully that 
there is an inadequate range of marks, or an insufficiency 
of score intervals between the highest and the lowest marks, 
if highly discriminatory grading is expected. It shows 
also quite clearly, that since the ranges of the Raw Score 
and the Score-A are almost equally narrow, the effect is 
not greatly attributable to the influence of the Part I A 


marks.

It is recommended that, in order to avoid some of 
the undesirable effects arising out of this inadequacy of 
range or insufficiency of intervals, the examination paper 
be standardized for difficulty on the basis of a frequency 
curve of error before the marking of the papers is done. 

By this, it is meant that the various items should be pro¬ 
perly weighted in accordance with the frequency with which 
it appears correctly on the examination answer papers. 

This will produce a normal distribution of full range for 
the written tests. If this recommendation cannot be im¬ 
plemented, it is alternatively suggested, that the written 
tests be marked on a possible maximum of 150 or more each, 
in order to widen the range. 

It is further recommended that the distribution of 
the Part I A marks be normalized if it is not already 
normal and that the marks be scaled to give the same range 

as the written tests. The method of computing the final 

-1 

result should be changed, so that the combining of the 
teachers * marks and the marks for the written examination 
'will be the last step in the procedure. 

6 . A tabulation was made whereby the effect of the 
Part I A mark on every Score-A might be read. The table 
presents rather startling facts. On a selected group of 
cases (taken near the point o£ greatest deviation but by 
no means ah isolated group) It was shown that despite the

fact that all members of the group turned in written work which 
was evaluated as being of the same calibre, yet their final 
raw scores varied by as much as 23 marks and that their 
transmuted scores varied by as much as 33 marks and that their 
grades varied from the lowest of the C' r s to the highest of 
the A’s. However, the indications are that this condition 
is due to the operation of chance factors rather than any 
deliberate attempt to destroy the reliability of the exam¬ 
ination, Nevertheless, if the recommendations made in 
paragraph 5 and those to follow in paragraph 8 are imple¬ 
mented, much of the undue influence of the Part I A marks 
will be eliminated, 

7. Evidence that the marks given by the teacher in 
Part I A are not exerting greatly a distorting effect on the 
final score is shown by the fact that between the Score-A 
(without the teachers 1 marks) and the Raw Score (including 

the teachers’ marks) there is a correlation of .90. 

£ 

8 . It is shown that the marks given by the teachers 
are tuned to a higher point of reference than those assigned 
by the' Department, In general, the one is about 20$ higher 
than the other. It is recommended that a set of standard 
values be set up to guide the teachers in forming their 
estimates, so that near uniformity may be attained and 
secondly, that the marks so given be properly scaled before 
being combined with the Department’s scores.

9. A study of the changes in the numbers of can¬ 
didates receiving the different grades when the grading is 
made on the basis of the Raw Score and when it is made on 
the basis of Score-A, reveals that the effect of Part I A 
is a centralizing one. This is shown by the reduction in 
the frequencies at the extremes, the H*s, A T s and D*s, 
while the central ones, the B f s and C f s.are increased. 
Briefly, Part I A tends to reduce the range and to move the 
mean up to a higher point in the scale. 

10 . The special effects investigated are best seen 
by a study of the following list of correlations.

APPENDIX A 

THE FORMAT OF THE ENGLISH 3 EXAMINATION 

The format of the examination in English 3 will be made 
clear by a reference to the Regulations of the Department of 
Education" from which the following is quoted. 1 

"(i) The examination in English 3 consists of two parts: 
Part I on Reading and Literature, and Part II on Language. 

" The student’s score for Part I comprises two parts, 

"A" and r ’B". The Part I "A" score is given on the basis of a 
special report from the instructor in Reading and Literature, 
certifying the student’s work in the reading and study of Poetry, 
Drama, and Essays and in Free Reading, in accordance with the 
authorized list as set forth in Bulletin II of the Programme of 
Studies for the High School. The special report must show 
whether or not the student’s work has been consistently and 
continuously satisfactory throughout the year. 

" The Part I "B" score is given on the results of a 
written test, mainly of reading comprehension and literary 
appreciation, to be set on "sight" selections. There will 
be no attempt to examine specifically on selections from the 
prescribed or authorized reading; but a few general questions 
on this reading may be given along with the questions on

"sight" selections. 

"Part II of the examination in English 3 is a test on 
Language. Of the final possible score, 30 per cent will be 
derived from the evaluation for English Language of certain 
questions of Part I "B"; and 70 per cent will come from 
questions on language usage, and from questions of types 
denoted by the term "composition," including an essay. 

This essay will be evaluated for English Language with much 
the same procedure as that applied to the evaluation of 
certain questions of Part I "B", as mentioned above. 

" (ii) The general procedures of evaluation for 
English Language will be the same as those which have been 
used during the last two years for the Grade IX Examinations. 
It is very important to note that one or more of the can¬ 
didates 1 answer papers in subjects other than English will 
be evaluated also for English language by means of the 
procedures just mentioned. 2 All evaluations for English 
Language will be made by a special group of sub-examiners, 
and not by those who score for content. 

" (iii) The following schedule shoves the method 
of determining a candidates final score in English 3:

English.
