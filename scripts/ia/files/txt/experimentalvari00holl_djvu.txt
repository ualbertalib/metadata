INTRODUCTION 


Physiologists and pharmacologists have presented evidence 
that stimulation of the motor nerve to a muscle produces certain 
chemical and electrical changes at the neuromuscular junction, or as 
it is more commonly called, the motor end-plate 0 Few histologic 
findings have been reported in the literature, however, which lend 
anatomical support to any of the current theories of transmission of 
the nerve impulse at the neuromuscular junction. The late E» J, 

Carey (10-19) (1942) has published the only recent extensive work in 
this line, from which he advanced his theory of amoeboid motion and 
secretion of motor end-plates. He presented evidence of ejection of 
axonic substance into the muscle fiber from the motor end-plate and 
visualized a centrifugal movement of axone substance along the nerve 
fiber to the effector. His theory does not seem to be widely accepted 
by physiologists. Previous to Carey 1 s work, Kuhne (I860) reported 
that living nerve endings in lizard muscle had more distinct outlines 
after curare poisoning, and outlines still more distinct after curare 
and prolonged, electrical stimulation, Miura (1886) stated that 
prolonged curarization In the frog caused dwindling in size of the 
hypolemmal axones, while Herzen and Odier (1904) found that curare 
caused hypolemmal axones of the frog to become varicose and axones 
outside the muscle fiber to become covered with granules. 

In this project It is proposed to repeat and attempt to 
extend these existing studies on experimental morphology of motor 
end-plates in an effort to present morphological changes that might

help to fill in a great gap in the present knowledge of physiology 
of nerve impulse transmission at the neuromuscular junction. 

Before proceeding with any discussion of morphologic 
changes that occur it would seem expedient here to review the fine 
anatomy of the normal nerve fiber and its termination in the motor 
end-plate. 

Where the nerve reaches the muscle it is to supply* it 
branches into a series of smaller divisions which enter the various 
fasciculi that make up the muscle. Here the outer connective tissue 
sheath of the nerve bundle blends with the connective tissue of the 
perimysium* the nerve bundle undergoes further division and the 
individual fibers branch repeatedly (always at'the nodes of Ranvier) 
to form a terminal arborization among the muscle fibers looking like 
the branches of a bushy pine tree. At the ends of these branches 
are clustered the motor end-plates* from fifteen to eighty-five such 
terminations originating from the branches of a single nerve fiber* 
with one end-plate, and usually only one* for each muscle fiber. At 
the end-plate the nerve loses its myelin sheath* the neurilemma be¬ 
comes continuous with the sarcolemma of the muscle fiber* and the 
axone terminates in a network of expansions and ramifications embedded 
in the granular cytoplasm of the motor end-plate. The te.rm.inal 
portion of the axone within the end-plate (under the sarcolemma) is 
termed the hypolemmal axone to distinguish it from the epilemmal part 
of the axone outside the end-plate. Where the neurilemmal sheath of 
the nerve blends with the sareolemma of the muscle* the Schwann nuclei 
of the former also extend downwards to become continuous with the

nuclei of the motor end-plate* The granular material of the plate has 
been known as the granules of Euhne, and it has been suggested that 
these granules may be composed of cholinesterase* This seems possible 
since cholinesterase is reported to occur at the neuromuscular junction 
in concentrations 50,000 times as great as in other parts of the 
body* (47). The whole aggregation including hypolemmal axone, nuclei 
and granules constitute the motor end-plate* There has been some 
question of the anatomical continuity of the end-plate with the sarco¬ 
plasm of the muscle fiber* Preparations stained with Schiff reagent 
(Fig* 4) show a definite line of demarcation between end-plates and 
muscle fiber, which is in agreement with the findings of Couteaux 
(2) who with Janus Green stain showed a layer of pallisade cells at 
the interface between end-plate and sarcoplasm* 

It is the purpose of this thesis to present in the form, of 
direct measurements and untouched photomicrographs evidence for 
morphologic expression of different phases of physiological activity 
at the neuromuscular junction*

METHOD 


The method followed in this project consisted, in brief, of 
studying histologically the variations in size and appearance of motor 
end-plates in various types of striated muscle, and in muscle tissue 
fixed while the living neuromuscular apparatus was subjected to cer¬ 
tain experimental procedures® 

The animal mainly used in this work was the rabbit since it 
was readily available, of convenient size, and had good resistance to 
infection* The latter quality was of value in degeneration and regen- 
eration studies where it was necessary to revive and maintain the 
animal alive after nerve cutting operations with limited aseptic 
conditions® Specimens were also taken for comparison from mice, 
guinea pigs, dogs and frogs® 

In experiments involving different experimental physiologi¬ 
cal states of the nerve-muscle system, experimental work was done on 
one limb with, the muscle of the corresponding opposite limb used as 
a control with which to compare® 

Tissue for study was taken from living animals under ether 
anaesthesia and from animals quickly killed by breaking their necks, 
in which latter case the tissue was immediately removed to fixative 
within two or three minutes after the animal was killed® The 
necessity of immediate fixation is stressed by Weil in his Textbook 
of Neuropathology (43) in which he states that chemical changes 
appeared in the dog* s brain a few seconds after removal® Says Weil,

The method found most satisfactory for making preparations 
to show nerve endings on muscle fibers was to fix and stain tissue 
en bloc and then tease out small fragments in glycerol and spread 
them out on a slide under a coverslip. Permanent preparations were 
made by ringing the cover slip with Canada Balsam. By the method of 
teasing out small fragments it was possible to show terminal, nerve 
arborizations, end organs, and muscle fibers in greater continuity 
and better anatomical relationship than was possible with sections 
prepared by embedding and sectioning with the microtome.

A point in the method that was questionable was the making 
of observations and measurements of end-plates flattened out under 
the coverslip. It was recognized that these organs might be distorted 
by the pressure of the coverslip, so a study was made of the effect 
on the end-plate of flattening out the tissue under the coverslip 0 
Dimensions of particular end-plates were measured by eye-piece micro¬ 
meter and the tissue was then flattened out under coverslip and the 
end-plates remeasured* There was found to be no change in size, 
shape or appearance. Apparently the layer of glycerine is sufficient 
to cushion the pressure of the coverslip; also the elasticity and 
malleability of the plates appeared to have been completely destroyed 
by fixing and, staining processes because when extreme pressure was 
applied the organs broke up and fell apart rather than stretch or 
change shape* 

Of the various staining methods offered, the one found most 
satisfactory was a modification of Ranvier*s gold chloride impregna¬ 
tion technique (see Appendix I). 20% formic acid was used in place 

of lemon juice called for in the original formula* This method 
gives clear-cut, black impregnation of axones and their end-plate 
terminations, and also stains breakdown material from degenerating 
nerves* Granular material of the plate stains dark red, muscle 
fibers stain light red-purple* Schwann cells and nuclei of the end- 
plate show up as pale outlines* Little swelling or shrinkage of 


muscle fibers occurs,

Another method that was tried and shows some promise is a 
method described by Liang (40) (1947), using Schiff*s reagent. This 
method depends on presence of aldehydes in the nerve tissue which 
reduce leucofuchsin to give a bluish-red coloration at the nerve. 
Using the method as originally described by Liang, we were able to 
obtain only faint coloration of the nerve, and this faded within a 
few hours, Erlich, Taylor and Waelsch (24) (April, 1943), suggested 
that presence of lipides tends to inhibit color development of 
Schiff 1 s reagent with higher fatty aldehydes and stated that this 
inhibitory effect can be minimized by carrying out the reaction in 
a medium of 30 % acetic acid instead of in aqueous medium. This was 
tried on our muscle preparations and there was produced increased 
color development but there was also produced severe shrinkage; and 
the stain still faded, 

De Lemater (23) in October of 1943 published results of 
work with basic fuchsin dyes and described a mordanting action of 
formaldehyde for basic fuchsin. This mordanting action was tested 
on muscle preparations and was found to occur with the basic fuchsin 
of Schiff* s reagent. It was observed that if the tissue was first 
treated with formaldehyde and then stained as directed for use with 
plain basic fuchsin, there was produced diffuse staining of the 
tissue due to the reduction of leucofuchsin by formaldehyde and con¬ 
sequent color formation. However, if the tissue was stained by 
Schiff* s reagent in 20% acetic acid first, washed, and then treated 
with 2% formaldehyde for four minutes, fading of the stain was 
prevented without interfering with its selectivity. Sections

stained by this method and mounted in glycerine under coverslip ringed 
with Canada Balsam have kept without fading up to the time of writing 
which is over three months after their preparation. (See Appendix II 
for details of the method.) The stain shows terminal nerve arboriza¬ 
tions and endings as deep purple against a pale blue background of 
muscle fiber. It also brings out a clearly demarcated boundary 
between end-plate and muscle sarcopla.sm which is not shown by gold 
and silver methods* (See Fig. 4)« 

For sections of normal,.and regenerating fibers in nerve 
trunks, Ranvier 1 s gold chloride method, Ranson 1 s pyridine-silver 
method and the ammoniacal-silver method of Cajal were used. 

Measurements of end-plates was done with an eye-piece micro¬ 
meter which was calibrated against a stage micrometer. Length and 
width of each end-plate was measured and area calculated as for area 
of an ellipse, i.e. Area s 7 T ab when 

a Z semi major axis 
and b Z semi minor axis.

IV 0 End-plates of electrically stimulated nerves . 

Electrical stimulating apparatus and fixative bath were set 
up at the operating table so that nerve-muscle preparations could be 
taken directly from the animal, stimulated through the nerve and 
fixed while the nerve was being stimulated and the muscle actively 
contracting. Shielded electrodes leading from an induction coil 
giving rapidly repeated tetanizing shocks were used in the stimulating 
apparatus 5 the fixative bath was a 20$ solution of formic acid. The 
nerve-muscle preparations were stimulated for five minutes in the 
fixative, fixed for an additional five minutes and stained with gold 
chloride. Sections of muscle used in these preparations were 3 ram« 
or less in thickness in order to facilitate quick penetration of 
fixative. 

The muscle used in these experiments was the left Flexor 
carpi ulnaris complete with its Ulnar nerve supply. The right Flexor 
carpi ulnaris was used as a control and was simultaneously subjected 
to same histological technique but without electrical stimulation. 

It was noted that many of the end-plates from stimulated 
preparations were expanded to cover a greater area than that of the 
majority of end-plates from control sections. (See Table 4 and Fig. 

7). The fronds of the hypolemmal axones of these expanded plates 
were seen to be somewhat attenuated and fragments of material appearing 
similar to axone material were seen scattered about the end-plate. 

(See Figs. 9 and 10). In a few cases, the end-plates appeared to be 
completely depleted of auriphilic material. (Fig. 11).

Vo Effect of drugs on motor end-plates 0 

Drugs affecting the activity of motor nerves by their 
action at the neuromuscular junction either inhibit or stimulate 
functions of the neuromuscular system* 

Commonly known drugs inhibiting neuromuscular function 

are: 

1* Curare and its constituent alkaloids* 

2, Nicotine in medium to high concentration* 

3 * Acetylcholine in high concentration, 

Physostigmine group in high concentration. 

These blocking agents do not interfere with the release 
of acetylcholine and therefore their action appears to be peripheral 
to where acetylcholine is produced or released. Curare, and possibly 
also nicotine, are believed to act by preventing reaction between 
acetylcholine and the hypothetical receptive substance of the end- 
plate* The mode of action of the physostigmine group (which prevents 
destruction of acetylcholine by cholinesterase) and acetylcholine is 
not yet made clear, and is somewhat paradoxical since these sub¬ 
stances are stimulators in concentrations normally encountered® 

Since it has lately been found that curare is related to the quaternary 
ammonium compounds (which include acetylcholine and physo stigmine 
group)^, it might indicate that actions of all those blocking agents 
listed above may be similar, 

# Some are quaternary, some axe tertiary amines but actions are 
similar.

Drugs having a stimulating effect at the neuromuscular 
junction includes 

lo Acetylcholine, acetylbetamethylcholine, carbaminoyl- 
choline and other esters of choline* 

2. Nicotine in low concentration* 

3« Quaternary ammonium and related compounds including 
physostigmine, prostigmine and methylene blue© 

4* Di-isopropyl-fluorophosphate (D.F.P.) 

5* Potassium. 

The quaternary ammonium group act to maintain a high 
acetylcholine level by preventing its destruction by cholinesterase. 
Since acetylcholine is itself a quaternary ammonium compound similar 
in structure to the above drugs, it is presumed that inhibition of 
cholinesterase occurs by these drugs combining with the esterase 
molecule at positions normally available to the substrate acetyl¬ 
choline© Alkylated amino groups are also moderate cholinesterase 
inhibitors, such groups occurring in pyrazoline derivatives, morphine, 
caffeine, percaine, etc. 'Quinine, quinidine, cocaine and lobeline 
are also reported to inhibit cholinesterase. Di-isopropyl-fiuorophos- 
phate (D.F.P.), a compound developed as a war gas, destroys cholin¬ 
esterase completely, first destroying the pseudocholinesterase in 
serum and then the true cholinesterase of nerve tissue. Its action 
differs from the other esterase inhibitors whose action is reversible. 

The mode of action of potassium has not been well 


elucidated,

Carey (13) (1944) reported effect of certain drugs on motor 
end-plates of chameleons* He found that intocostrin caused a retrac¬ 
tion of the end-plate from average diameter 37.6 mu to average of 
49*5 mu, with increased gold staining material; a similar effect 
resulted with quinine, the latter especially enhancing the effect of 
curare. He also reported an expansion of end-plates after prostig- 
mine (37.6 mu to 110.5 mu), tetraethyl lead and acetylcholine. 

Similar experiments have been repeated on rabbits in this 
laboratory with intocostrin, physostigmine and acetylcholine. 

Intocostrin 

A rabbit was injected with 2 mg. of intocostrin intraven¬ 
ously. There occurred myosis, flaccid paralysis and cessation of 
respiration within three minutes. Rabbit was then killed, and 
sections from intercostal and flexor muscles of foreleg were pre¬ 
pared by gold and teasing method. 

The mean area of fourteen end-plates measured was 491 mu^ 
(as compared to a mean area of 935 mu^ for the control series). 

There was little change in amount of gold staining material. 

Physostigmine 

A rabbit was injected with 1 cc. of 0.1$ physostigmine 
intravenously. Signs of motor excitement - twitching, clonic muscle 
spasm, were seen within one minute after injection began. Rabbit 
was killed and sections prepared by gold and teasing method.

The mean area of twenty end-plates measured was 800 mu^ 
(slightly smaller than that (935 Era?) found for 1,360 controls)® There 
was little change in amount of gold staining granules® 

Acetylcholine 

2 cc® of Is1,000 solution of acetylcholine were injected 
intravenously into a rabbit® Few signs of the drug action were 
shown except for profu.se salivation® Rabbit was killed and sections

VI. Degenerative changes in the motor end-plate after transection 

of the nerve . 

In a series of adult male rabbits the Ulnar Nerve of the 
left foreleg was cut where it is quite easily accessible on the 
medial surface about 1 cm. above the elbow joint. The right foreleg 
was used as a control. Aseptic technique as far as possible was 
used, the wound closed with cotton sutures, and the animals killed 
for study at intervals of from one hour to three months after nerve 
transection. Sections for study were prepared by the gold and 
teasing method. 

The earliest histological change that was observed after 
the nerve was divided was a globulation of axone material at the 
motor end-plate. These globulations have been referred to as 
retension cysts by Carey (13)® (See Fig. 13)* The change was 
observed from two to twenty-four hours after nerve section. There¬ 
after, a process of gradual resorption appeared to take place so that 
after third or fourth day there was little auriphilic material visible 
in end-plate and terminal portion of the nerve fiber. (Fig. 14)® 

In the larger nerve trunks, fragments of degenerating nerve fibers 
taking gold stain may be visible for several weeks. After three 
or four days and up to the end of a couple of weeks after denervation, 
the location of degenerated end-plates is difficult to find, but in 
long degenerated nerves after several weeks the nuclei of the end- 
plate may stand out very prominently as pale ovals against a darker 
staining surrounding* (Fig. 17). These pale nuclei have been 
described by Carey as ’•'ghost cells 11 ®

Also observed in cases of late denervation was an increased 
prominence of the nuclei of muscle fibers (Fig® 18) which is in line 
with the work of Altschul (5) who reported an increase in size and 
number of muscle cell nuclei after denervation of striated muscle* 
There was seen no appreciable increase in the numbers of end-plate 
nuclei in denervated plates over the usual number of 7-13 found in 
normal end-plates from control rabbits*

DISCUSSION 

There was shown little variation in character and size of 
motor nerve endings among different species of mammals including the 
rabbit, mouse, rat, guinea pig and dog. End-plates from frog muscle 
were of a less compact and circumscribed nature than those of the 
mammals, being instead a simple system of terminal branches and 
knobs distributed over an extensive area of muscle fiber, resembling 
the endings described as u terminaisons en grappe 1 *. 

The absence of a significant difference between mean areas 
of end-plates from pale and red muscle is of interest in view of the 
fact that there has been reported a substantial difference in the 
rates of contraction of these two types of muscle. Red muscle con¬ 
tains more myoglobin, is slower contracting than pale muscle and is 
usually considered to be predominant in those muscles which contract 
slowly but which are active continuously for long periods of time, 
whereas pale muscle is adapted for fast action of shorter duration. 
In the musculature of man, pale and red muscle fibers are inter¬ 
spersed, but in birds, rabbits, cats and some other animals the two 
distinct types of fiber occur separately in certain muscles* 

By a similar lack of significant difference between end- 
plates from Intercostal and Flexor digitorum sublimis muscle there 
has been a failure to show any basis due to morphology of end-plates 
for the difference in fatigue^ability of these muscles, the first 
of which can keep contracting continuously indefinitely while the 
second contracts vigorously for a limited duration after which it

becomes fatigued and requires a period of inactivity in which to 
recuperate* Since fatigue of a nerve-muscle preparation is mani¬ 
fested earliest at the neuromuscular junction, it might have been 
expected that there should be morphologic evidence to accompany the 
physiological variations in these types of muscle* 

The expansion of end-plates shown in electrically stimu¬ 
lated preparations and after acetylcholine injection were of 
similar appearance and of a very similar order of magnitude* These 
variations can not be attributed solely to changes in shape of the 
muscle fiber (contracted, relaxed, stretched) since both with 
electrical stimulation and after physostigmine injection the muscle 
could be seen by the naked eye to be contracting vigorously but the 
mean area of end-plates was increased in electrically stimulated 
preparations and showed no great variation from the normal after 
physostigmine, while after acetylcholine injection there were seen 
only a couple of brief twitches and no visible sustained contraction 
of the muscle, yet there showed a mean area of end-plates close to 
that of electrically stimulated preparations*^ 

The disappearance of gold staining material of the end-plate 
about the third day after transection of the nerve coincides with 
the absolute failure of transmission of impulses which Titeca, 

Coppee and Baeq and others found to occur at a similar period after 
nerve section* 

$ The small number of cases of drug injected animals limits the 
validity of conclusions drawn from this section of the work*

SUMMARY 

1. The average area of motor nerve end-plates in striated muscle 
of the rabbit was found to be 935 mu^. 

2. There was found to be no significant difference between areas of 
end-plates from Intercostal and Flexor digitortun sublimis muscle. 

3. There was found to be no significant difference between areas 
of end-plates from red and pale Intercostal muscle. 

4» It was found that the mean area of end-plates electrically 
stimulated through the nerve was approximately one and a half 
times greater than that of a corresponding control series. 

5. The mean areas of end-plates after intravenous injection of 
drugs were: 

Intocostrin - 491 mu^ 

Physostigmine - 300 mu 2 
Acetylcholine - 1*250 mu^ 

The mean area for control series was 935 mu 2 . 

6. Degenerative changes of the end-plate consisting of globulation 
of the axone substance was seen 2-24 hours after transection of 
the nerve. After 72 hours there was little at the end-plate 
that was visible by gold stain. There was no apparent change 
in number of end-plate nuclei after denervation.

APPENDIX I 


Ranvter* s gold chloride method for motor nerve endings as modified 0 

1* Place thin slices of muscle tissue (3 mm* or less thick) in 
20$ formic acid for five or ten minutes until they become 
translucent* 

2* Transfer tissue directly without rinsing to 1$ solution of acid 
gold chloride* Let stand from 20-60 minutes until a uniform 
golden yellow tone is reached* (not brown) 

3* Transfer directly to 20$ formic acid and reduce in the dark for 
fifteen hours* 

4* Rinse in water and store in glycerol-alcohol solution 3*1* 

5* Snip out small fragments and tease out gently in glycerol* 

6* Mount in glycerol sealed with balsam, clarite or glycerol 
gelatin. 

Note s 

It is important to handle tissue with glass hooks or 
paraffin coated instruments. Glassware must be scrupulously clean.

APPENDIX II 

Modification of Schiff reagent for staining nerve endings 

The chemistry of this staining reaction occurs in two steps* 
First, in preparation of the reagent, red basic fuchsin is oxidized to 
its colorless form (leucofuchsin) by the action of S02* Then when the 
reagent is applied to tissues, aldehydes present in nerve tissue 
reduce the leucofuchsin and a quinonoid compound is produced which 
gives a purple coloration at the nerve* 

The source of SOp used does not appear to be of great impor¬ 
tance so long as by-products are not formed which interfere with the 
staining reaction* Sodium bisulfite has been the source most commonly 
used, but the thionyl chloride method of Barger and De Lemater (8) is 
less troublesome and gives similar results* 

Following is the method of preparation and usage of the Schiff 
reagent as modified and used in this project,. 

Preparation of Reagent 

1* Dissolve 1 gxn* basic fuchsin in 318 cc* distilled water* 

2* Filter. 

3* Add 2 cc* thionyl chloride 

4* Stopper flask and stand for twelve hours* The reagent should be 
pale straw colored. 


5* Add 80 cc* glacial acetic acid,

Staining 

1. Fix thin slices of tissue 10 minutes in 1% acetic acid* 

2, Immerse without rinsing in Schiff reagent for 1-3 hours until 
nerves are stained deep purple* 

3o Rinse in water. 

4* Immerse in 2 % formaldehyde for 4 minutes® 

* Transfer directly to glycerol for storage. 

6. Tease out small segments in glycerol and spread. out on slide 
under coverslip* Nerves and endings are stained deep purple 
against a paler background of muscle fibers*
