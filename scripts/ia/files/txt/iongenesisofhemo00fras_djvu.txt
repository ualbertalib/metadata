PREFACE 

Hans Fischer (6) in 1929 completed a chemical syn¬ 
thesis of hematin, the iron complex of protoporphyrin, 
and succeeded in combining this in its reduced form with 
the protein globin, thereby producing hemoglobin, which 
was similar in all respects to the natural blood pigment. 
However, the complete mechanism of the synthesis of hemo¬ 
globin in the animal body is still unknown* 

A study of the iron and copper metabolism in embry¬ 
onic life would be one way of approaching the problem 
of the biosynthesis of hemoglobin and the developing 
chick embryo was chosen for this purpose* Any inform¬ 
ation gained from such an investigation would add to 
the existing knowledge of hemoglobin synthesis which is 
presented, in summary, in this introduction* 

The pigments mentioned here may be regarded as 
being derived from porphin, a substance consisting of 
four nitrogen-containing pyrrole units joined in a ring 
structure by means of four methine groups (Fig. 1).

Each pyrrole group of porphin posesses two hydrogen atoms 
which may be replaced by other groups, for example, in 
aetioporphyrin there are four methyl groups and four ethyl 
groups attached at the eight corners of these rings in 
place of the hydrogens of porphin. This substitution may 
be made in different ways, resulting in four possible 
different aetioporphyrins which Fischer has named aetio¬ 
porphyrin I, II, III, and IV, and each is capable of giving 
rise to a potential series of porphyrin derivatives (Fig. 2). 



Fig. 2 - The Four A etioporphyrins (' 1 = pyrrole ring). 

Only two of these four possible kinds of porphyrins are 
known in nature, derivable from aetioporphyrin I and III 
respectively. 

Most of the pigments such as hemoglobin, myoglobin, 
cytochrome, catalase, bilirubin, urobilin, chlorophyll, 
etc., belong to series III, while series I isomers are 
excreted in large quantities in certain pathological 
conditions.

In most animals the iron necessary for hemoglobin 
synthesis is furnished by ferritin, the brown iron* 
containing protein present in spleen, bone marrow, and 
liver* The iron in ferritin is stored in the form of 
colloidal micelles of very insoluble basic iron phos¬ 
phate attached to a large, non-diffusible protein mol¬ 
ecule, apoferritin (7). When iron is required for heme 
synthesis, it is made rapidly available , probably by 
reduction of the ferritin iron to the ferrous form* 

Demands for globin synthesis may be met by breaking 
down the apoferritin molecule itself* 

The iron is believed to be incorporated into the 
prosthetic part of hemoglobin after the cyclic structure 
of the four pyrrole groups has been completed. This view 
is supported by certain facts: 1. H. Influenza requires 
heme for growth (8), When grown on certain iron-free 
porphyrins, such as protoporphyrin, these organisms insert 
the iron and their growth requirements are thus met. The 
vinyl groups seem to be necessary to make possible this 
introduction of iron Into the ring. 2. Protoporphyrin 
occurs in Immature erythrocytes which are rapidly synthesi 
ing heme (4). Protoporphyrin, then, not some iron-contain 
ing open-chained tetrapyrrole, is considered to be the 
precursor of hemoglobin. Its constitution is as follows 
and it can be seen that it is derived from aetioporphyrin

Rimington (2l) suggests that pyrrole precursors 
(probably dipyrrylmethenes) are capable of combining 
to give either series I or III pigments, but that 
the synthesis is selectively catalyzed so that the 
latter predominate. The small amounts of conronor- 
phyrin I which are excreted in normal urine may be 
considered as a by-product in the synthesis of Type 
III pigments. 

The first step In the porphyrin synthesis suggest¬ 
ed by the discovery by Shemin and Rittenberg (24), is 
that glycine is the nitrogenous precursor of the pyrrole 
ring. Also acetic acid or a closely related compound 
appears to take part in the synthesis. More recent 
discoveries by Muir and Neuberger (18) show that the 
acidic and non-acidic pyrrole nuclei in hemin have the 

same or closely similar isotope ratios, i. e., theie is 

>s 

an equal distribution of N over the four rings of 
protoporphyrin. By using glycine labeled with C on the

The iron of the hen egg is nearly all located in the 
yolk where it is combined with a material which has certain 
protein-like properties, Bunge (2) studied this and named 
it haematogen. Hugounenq and Morel (11) regarded haemat- 
ogen as being the precursor of the hemoglobin formed by 
the chick during the incubation of the egg. Support is 
lent to this theory by the fact that coincident with the 
great increase in the hemoglobin content of the chick 
on the fourteenth day of incubation as shown by Sendju (23), 
there is a corresponding sudden decrease in the vitellin- 
phosphorus of the yolk as shown by Plimmer and Scott (20). 
Hugounenq and Morel decomposed haematogen by acids and 
split off a black iron-containing pigment (2.60% Fe) which 
they named haematovin. McFarlane, Fulmer, and Jukes (1$) 
state that it is probable that the synthesis of hemoglobin 
has been partly completed in the body of the hen before 
the egg is laid, the embryo completing the formation of 
hemoglobin from this preformed compound. 

The subject of this investigation was originally 
intended to be this so-called preformed precursor”, in 
order to determine whether the mode of synthesis of hemo¬ 
globin in the developing chick was similar to that which 
has been summarized above.

A review of the literature showed that there is 
considerable controversy as to whether the iron is 
inorganic, or organically bound in a fraction in 
vitellin which serves as an intermediate in the 
hemoglobin production in the chick* Therefore the 
present work was reduced to a consideration of the 
state of iron and copper in the egg. 

SECTION I - THE STATE OF IRON IN THE EGO . 

INTRODUCTION 

In the earlier literature Bunge applied the term, 
haematogen, to iron-containing fractions obtained 
from the breakdown of the vitellin molecule. Hill (10), 

i 

using the °^-dipyridyl and sodium hydrosulfite method 
for iron determinations, concluded that iron was 
present as colloidal ferric hydroxide and that yolk 
contained no iron in a strong organic combination 
such as hematin. 

McFarlane (16) hydrolyzed lecitho-vitellin with 
0.25 N sodium hydroxide and obtained a fraction, not 
precipitable with trichloroacetic acid but precipit- 
able with normal lead acetate, which contained all the 
iron and 25% of the copper of the material hydrolyzed. 
The metals, present in the filtrate after decomposition

of the lead acetate precipitate with hydrogen sulfide, 
did not give direct reactions with potassium thiocyanate 
or sodium diethyldithiocarbamate. Hence he concluded that 
iron and copper were in organic form as part of the 
vitellin molecule. 

McParlane’s views are not supported by Tompsett 
(26) who used thioglycolic acid for estimation of iron. 

In trichloroacetic acid filtrates of egg yolk, and 
of egg yolk plus iron alum, negative tests resulted 
with thioglycolic acid and ammonium hydroxide, although 
iron added to the filtrate could be determined, thus 
showing that there is nothing which interferes with 
the test. If the reaction with thioglycolic acid is 
carried out before addition of the trichloroacetic acid, 
the iron in egg is readily estimated quantitatively 
in the filtrate and ferric iron added to the yolk can 
be recovered. 

However, the work of Shorland and Wall (25), 
confirmed by Borgen and Elvehjem (1) showed that 
thioglycolic acid and sodium hydrosulfite react 
with traces of hematin and hemoglobin to release 
Iron. It is not inconceivable then that if the iron 
were in weak organic combination in the yolk, sodium

hydrosulfite might split it off to give Hill T s pos¬ 
itive <fr*-dipyridyl test; and thioglycolic acid might 
release iron to give Tompsett's test when this re¬ 
agent was used before precipitation with trichloro¬ 
acetic acid, Kitzes, Elvehjem, and Schuette (12) 
reported that iron was co-precipitated with plasma 
proteins when trichloroacetic acid was used. They 
believed the iron was mechanically carried down. 

This might explain why Tompsett obtained no positive 
test with iron added to egg yolk. 

More information was needed to decide whether 
iron was loosely combined with the protein or was 
actually in organic combination in vitellin. It was 
decided to add inorganic iron to egg yolks and to see 
whether this would appear in the vitellin prepared from 
these. If the Iron forms a complex, its content In the 
vitellin will have increased. Under these conditions, 
provided the iron originally present in the egg is 
5n some sort of organic combination, then by repeating 
McFarlane’s hydrolysis with this vitellin, the 
difference between the two typws of iron might be 
manifested in the separate hydrolytic fractions.

RESIJLTS AND DISCUSSION 

Determination of Iron 

A. Iron was determined according to the method of 
Kitzes et al (12) with certain modifications. The above 
method was developed for the estimation of olasma iron 
of 0-5 jigm. range. Determination of iron in more 
concentrated solutions is attended with certain difficul¬ 
ties, noted below, which the modifications introduced cor¬ 
rect, 

B. The digestion procedure was essentially that of 
McFarlane (15). 

A, Preparation of the Standard Graph, 

Reagents 

1. Buffer - 12.5 gm. sodium acetate plus 12,5 
ml* glacial acetic acid were diluted to 100 
ml. (PH 4.7). 

2. -dipyridyl - 0.2% solution in 0.1 N HC1* 

3. Thioglycolic acid - Eastman grade, redistilled* 

4. Iron standard solutions containing 50 ;igm. Pe/ml* 

a. 0.3511 gm. pure salt, FeS©^_ (NH 4 ) gSO^. 6 H 2 O 
are dissolved in a little water and 100 ml. 

1.0 N HC1 and diluted to 1 liter. 

b. 0.0500 gm. analytical Iron wire are diss¬ 
olved in 17 ml. 6 N HC1 and diluted to 1 liter. 
The working standards containing 5 jigm. Fe/ml. 
were prepared by diluting 10 ml. of each of these 
solutions to 100 ml.

The HC1 used was double distilled, Olass-distilled 
water was used to prepare the standard iron solutions. 

Procedure 

Standard colored solutions of 10 ml, volume in 
colorimeter tubes were prepared in the range 5-25 jigm, 
Pe as follows: 

X ml, standard Fe solution containing 5 jigm. Fe/ml. 

' - ••• •' f' 

5.0 ml. buffer solution. 

7-X ml. glass distilled water. 

Two drops of thioglycolic acid were added to each tube 
and the tubes placed in a water bath at 60 C for 5 
minutes. The tubes were allowed to cool in a beaker 
of water without shaking. 

The center settings were then determined on the 
Evelyn colorimeter, using filter 520 mp, by setting 
each tube in the holder, adjusting the galvanometer 
to read 100, removing the tube and noting the reading. 
Thus each tube serves as its own blank, with the blank 
tube measuring the amount of Pe contamination in the 
reagents. 

Then 1 ml. 0. 2 % e^-dipyridyl solution was add'ed 
and the color development measured immediately using 
the previous center setting for each tube. L values 
(L- 2-lcg 0) were calculated from the galvanometer

B. Digestion 

The materials for iron analyses were transferred 
to micro-Kjeldahl flasks. One ml. concentrated sulfuric 
acid, 0.5 ml. 60% perchloric acid, and a glass bead 
were added and the digestion carried out with the flasks 
placed in a sand bath. Heating was continued until 
dense white fumes formed. The flasks were cooled and 
one drop of concentrated nitric acid was added and 
the digest heated again until the excess nitric acid 
was driven off. 

The digest was cooled, transferred to a 10 ml® 

volumetric flask with three one ml. portions of water 

and then 2.5 ml. 40% NaOH was added carefully. This 

was made to volume after cooling, and iron determinations 

were carried out according to the above method with 

a 2 or 1 ml. aliquot. The amount of Fe in the test 

solution was calculated from the calibration graph 

or from the formula (L . -L, n , ) X 39.3, where 

aliquot blank 

39.3 is the slope of the gf*aph. 

Modification of the method of determining iron . 

Center settings obtained with tubes containing a 
fair amount of iron, say 25 jigm., were found to be 
4 or 5 galvanometer readings greater than the center 
settings of the blanks. If the reduction of the iron 
were allowed to proceed for about an hour, the center

It was found that heating the tubes for 5 minutes 
at 60°C,after adding the thioglycolic acid, hasten¬ 
ed reduction and produced the same effect on the 
center settings as allowing the tubes to stand at 
room temperature for about an hour. 

WhenQf^'-dipyridyl was added after the tubes had 
been heated and cooled, full color development was 
attained immediately. By the method of Kit zes et al.

full color was not attained for about an half hour or 
longer, due presumably, to the fact that not all the 
ferric iron was reduced to the ferrous form to react 
with the °(f( -dipyridyl to produce the colored complex. 

A transient blue color is formed with ferric iron 
and thioglycolic acid in acid solution (13). As the 
iron is gradually reduced by the thioglycolic acid, the 
color fades. Therefore, at minimum color (i.e., when 
the center setting has fallen to its lowest value after 
5 minutes heating), all the iron may be assumed to be 
in the ferrous form. Addition of -dipyridyl at this 
point results in full color development..Adding the 
dipyridyl when the center setting has a higher value, 
because of the presence of ferric iron, results in 
an erroneous final galvanometer reading. 

The above modification eliminates this error and 
reduces the time of reduction and final color develop¬ 
ment.

Prenaration of vitellin (5) . 

The yolks of six eggs were separated from the 
whites and washed thoroughly with running water and 0.9% 
saline without rupturing the yolk membrane. The yolks 
were then broken into an equal volume of 10% saline 
solution and extracted with ether' containing 2% ethyl 
alcohol until the ether extracts were colorless. The 
water solution was strained through cheesecloth to re¬ 
move the yolk membranes. The solution was then poured 
into 20 volumes of water and allowed to stand over¬ 
night. The supernatant was siphoned off and the re¬ 
maining precipitate and fluid were centrifuged. With¬ 
out washing, the precipitate was dissolved in 10% sal¬ 
ine and again precipitated by pouring into 20 volumes 
of water. The material was collected as before, washed 
once with water, and centrifuged again. 

The protein was suspended in 1200 ml. 80% ethanol 
and refluxed for several hours. The precipitate was fil¬ 
tered as dry as possible by suction, and the process 
repeated using 95% and then absolute ethanol. It was 
filtered and washed with ether and dried in a vacuum 
dessicator over sulfuric acid for several days. The 
yield obtained was 7 gm. An analysis for iron and copper 
gave 0.051% Fe, and 0.0039% Cu.

Preparation of vitellin with Increased iron content. 

Elvehjem and Hart (5) state that the iron content 
of an egg of average size is about 0.8 - 1.0 mgm. The 
average vitellin content per egg is approximately 2 gm., 
so this results in an iron concentration in vitellin of 
about 0.04 - 0.05$*(16)* This percentage of iron in 
vitellin can be considered fairly constant since Schaible, 




Tavidson,and Bandener^have shown that there is no sig¬ 
nificant difference in iron contents of yolks of eggs 
produced before or after iron supplementation to the diet 
of the hen. 

To the saline solution of two egg yolks, 2900 jigm# 
iron as ferric chloride was added. The mixture was 
extracted with ether and the vitellin prepared as above. 

% Fe found - 0.147. The increase from about 0.05 to 
0.147% was then apparently due to the inorganic iron 
which appeared almost quantitatively in the vitellin, 
as shown by the following approximations.

Hydrolysis of vitellin. 

To 0.S279 gm. vitellin (0.051# Fe) in a 150 ml. 
Erlenmeyer flask was added 100 ml. 0.25N sodium hy¬ 
droxide* The flask was placed in a thermostat at 37°C 
for 72 hours* 

a. * 15 ml. of the digest was slowly added to 25 ml* 
of 3.5$ trichloroacetic acid in a centrifuge tube. The 
supernatant was drained off completely from the result¬ 
ing precipitate and iron analyses were done on the whole 
of the precipitate and on aliquots of the supernatant. 

Iron contamination of the precipitate due to the small 
amount of adhering supernatant would be negligible since 
1 ml. of the supernatant contains less than 2 ;ugm* Fe. 

b. To 25 ml. of this supernatant was added 5 ml* of 
saturated normal lead acetate in; a centrifuge tube. 

The supernatant was drained off and. iron determinations 
were done on the whole of the lead acetate precipitate 
and on aliquots of the supernatant. 

A second 15 ml* aliquot of this digest was treated 
in the same manner except with, the addition of 25 ;ugm. 

Fe to the trichloroacetic acid filtrate before lead 
acetate precipitation. 

Similar hydrolysis experiments were carried out with 
the vitellin containing 0.147$ Pe. The findings are given 


in Table 1

From the hydrolysis experiment it was found that the lead 
acetate precipitate did not account for all the iron. 

Some iron was precipitated by trichloroacetic acid and 
some remained in the lead acetate filtrate. Iron added 
to the trichloroacetic acid filtrate in experiment 2 
could be precipitated by lead acetate, alth6ugh McFarlane 
found this not to be the case, even though his trichloro¬ 
acetic acid filtrate contained large amounts of iron due 
to contamination from the flask.

Therefore, McFarlane's statement that all the iron was 
contained in the lead acetate precipitate could not be 
confirmed. It appears also from these experiments that 
the lead acetate precipitate shows no distinction between 
the iron added to vitellin and that originally present in 
the yolk. 

When McFarlane decomposed the lead acetate precipitate 
with hydrogen sulfide* Iron and copper were found in the 
filtrate. This was the basis for his conclusion that iron 
and copper were organically bound. Recently Neuberg (19) 
has reported that copper and iron sulfides are soluble in 
solutions of certain amino acids and proteins. This could 
explain McFarlane 1 s findings.

SECTICN II - THE STATE OF COPPER IN THE E3G . 

INTRODUCTION 

Copper has been reported to be part of the vit- 
ellin molecule* McFarlane (16) places the value at 
0.0033%, and states that it is not improbable that all 
the copper of the yolk is contained in this protein. 
Tompsett (27) performed recovery experiments with copper 
added to various biological materials. Copper was added 
to egg yolk and other materials and then determined in 
the trichloroacetic acid filtrates, allowances being 
made for the initial copper contents of the materials® 
Since it was recovered quantitatively from yolks, Tomp¬ 
sett concluded, that copper does not form a complex as 
does iron. This statement along with the fact that 
vitellin contains copper would appear to confirm McFar¬ 
lane* s belief that copper in vitellin is organically 
bound• 

Since the copper originally present In the egg yolk 
appeared in the trichloroacetic acid filtrate, one can 
conclude from Tompsett*s experiments that either the 
trichloroacetic acid split the copper from its organic 
combination, or that copper does form a complex which 
can be split by trichloroacetic acid. 

Therefore it was decided to add inorganic copper 
•to the yolk and ascertain whether It would appear in the 
vitellin prepared from this yolk. Increased copper con¬ 
tent would indicate formation of a complex*

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

Determination of copper - The sodium diethyldithio- 
carbamate method was used as described by McEarlane (14). 
Reagents 

1. Sodium pyrophosphate solution - 4$ Na 4 P 2 0 7 *3.(^2C)« 

2. Concentrated ammonium hydroxide. 

3. Redistilled amyl alcohol. 

4. Sodium diethyldithiocarbamate solution - 0.5$ 

in water. 

Digestion 

The destruction of organic matter by wet incineration 
was carried out in a micro Kjeldahl flask. Two ml. con¬ 
centrated sulfuric acid and 1 ml. 60$ perchloric acid 
were added and the solution was heated in a sand bath 
until white fumes ceased to be evolved. 

Preparation _o_f_^standard copper solution 

0.3928 gm. pure CuS0 4 .5H 2 0 was dissolved in water 
with a small amount of dilute sulfuric acid. The solution 
was diluted to 1 liter (1 ml. = 0.10 mgm. Cu). The 
standard copper solution was prepared by diluting 10 ml. 
of the above solution to 100 ml. (1 ml. = 10 pgm. Cu). 
Determination of copper 

The contents from the Kjeldahl flask were transferred 
to a volumetric flask and diluted to volume. A 15 ml. 
aliquot was taken for analysis in a 50 ml. stoppered 
graduated cylinder. The standard was prepared in exactly

the same way except with the omission of the vitellin. 
Ten jugm. of the copper standard was added to the ali¬ 
quot in the cylinder. Two ml. of the pyrophosphate 
solution was added and contents were made alkaline with 
concentrated ammonia. Then 10 ml. amyl alcohol and 0.5 
ml. 0 . 5 % sodium diethyldithiocarbamate were added and 
the cylinder was stoppered and shaken for 30 seconds. 
The alcohol layer was allowed to settle and after it 
was clear, 5 ml. was pipetted into clean cups in a 
Duboscq colorimeter and the colors were compared with 
the standard containing the 10 /igm. 6opper. 

Preparation of vitellin. 

Vitellin was prepared as above from one egg but 
with the addition of 120 /igm. copper as copper sulfate 
before the ether extraction. % Cu - 0.0086. 

The average amount of copper in vitellin is said 
to be 19Ss than 0 . 004 %, (16). The increase from about 
0.004 to 0.0086^ was then apparently due to the inorgan 
ic copper which appeared almost quantitatively in the 
vitellin, as shown by the following approximations.

Exp eriments with copper in vitellin. 

0,5543 gm. vitellin (0.0039$ Cu) was suspended in 
25 ml. trichloroacetic acid for about 3 hours at room 
temperature with occasional shaking. Then copper deter¬ 
minations were made on aliquots of the filtrate, 

0.5543 gm, vitellin 

Calculated copper content 21.5 jugm. 

Copper extracted with 
trichloroacetic acid 19.0 jigm. 

From the above work, it can be concluded that Cu does 
form a type of complex with vitellin and is easily re¬ 
moved from its combination by extracting with 20 % tri¬ 
chloroacetic acid. From similar experiments, it was 
found that iron in vitellin was not easily extracted 
by 20 % trichloroacetic acid but that it could be released 
by 1.5N HC1. Iron appears to be more strongly held than 
copper to the vitellin protein#

SUMMARY 

1. A modification of the method of Kitzes et al for 
iron determinations has been described. 

2. Iron added to egg yolk appears in the vitellin pre¬ 
pared from these yolks. 

3# It was concluded after repeating McParlane f s hydrol 
ysis experiments that iron is not in organic combin 
ation with vitellin® 

4. Tompsett’s statement that copper does not form a 
complex with vitellin was not confirmed. 

5. Conper added to egg yolk appears in the vitellin 
prepared from these yolks. McFarlane ! s claim that 
copper is In organic combination with vitellin is 


refuted

PREFACE 

In 1909 Tanret (33) first isolated the base, ergothioneine, 
from ergot of rye. Hunter and Eagles (20), and Benedict, 

Newton, and Behre (5) isolated from pig blood sulfur-contain¬ 
ing compounds which they named sympectothion and thiasine, 
respectively. It remained for Eagles and Johnson (8) to 
identify both products from pig blood as ergothioneine. The 
structural formula was established by the work of Barger and 
Ewins (4) in 1911, who showed ergothioneine to be the betaine 
of thiolhistidine (Fig. 1). But the ultimate proof for the 
structure of any compound rests on its chemical synthesis.

No physiological significance was attached to ergo¬ 
thioneine, a constituent of red blood cells, until Lawson 
and Rimington (23) attempted to demonstrate an anti-thyroid 
effect with the compound. A series of papers on other aspects 
of ergothioneine have since been published as a result of 
renewed interest in ergothioneine research ( Stanley and 
Astwood (32), Hunter (19), Work (35), Woolf (34), and Lat- 
ner and Mowbray (22)). In order to carry out physiological

and clinical experiments, adequate supplies of ergothio- 
neine are necessary and so the problem of the chemical 
synthesis has become more pressing* Part A of this work 
is concerned with the attempted chemical synthesis. The 
biochemical studies on ergothioneine described in Part B 
were undertaken in an attempt to explain its origin in the 
red blood cell and its role, if any, in the organism. 

PART A - CHEMICAL SYNTHESIS 

INTRODUCTION 

In 1930, Ashley and Harington (3) attempted the syn¬ 
thesis of ergothioneine. They suggested that the hypo¬ 
thetical amino acid, 2-thiolhistidine, first introduced 
by Eagles and Vars (9), might be methylated in vivo to 
produce ergothioneine. However, methylation of this 
compound by chemical means resulted in a pentamethyl 
derivative. Again in 1933, Harington and Overhoff (17) 
reported more attempts at synthesis. Their methods are 
outlined below, fallowed in each case by a brief statement 
of their results. 

a. Benzoylate ethyl a-chloro-3-glyoxaline-4(or 5)- 
propionate (I). Convert this by controlled hydrolysis 
to a-chloro-r-keto-^-aminovaleric acid. Condense with 
potassium thiocyanate to form the a-halogeno-^-2-thiol- 
glyoxaline-4(or 5)-propionic acid.(II). Substitute the 
halogen by trimethylamine to produce ergothioneine.

Their attempts to benzoylate I failed. It appears 
that the presence of a negative halogen atom in the side 


chain of I renders the glyoxaline ring resistant to fission 
by benzoylation. 

b. Convert the amino groups of the disulfide of 2-thiol- 
4(or 5)-aminomethylglyoxaline (III) to hydroxyls and finally 
replace by halogens. Condense with ethyl sodiochloromalonate 
reduce the resulting disulfide, hydrolyze and decarboxylate, 
to give II. 

The action of iodine to produce the disulfide from III 
did not proceed smoothly and a complex mixtiire was obtained.

Compound VIII could not be satisfactorily hydrolyzed 
to 2-thiol-4(or 5)-hydroxymethylglyoxaline, nor could the 
phenoxy group be directly substituted by bromine. The 
object would be to obtain XX and condense it with ethyl 
sodiochloromalonate to produce II. 

d. Condense phthalimidohalogenoacetone with ethyl sodio¬ 
chloromalonat e, liberate the amino group, form the thiol-

Highly pigmented resins were obtained when the conden¬ 
sation was carried out. 

e. Through a series of reactions, the following compound 
was obtained:

NH x o o T 

Methylation of X led to liberation of N(CHg)^ and pro¬ 
duction of an unsaturated acid. In another variation using 
X, the amino group was replaced by bromine by the action of 
nitrosyl bromide. This compound was to be hydrolyzed and 
the ring then formed, to produce II. However, on hydrolysis, 
HBr was given off, followed by ring closure. 

Harington and Cverhoff believe that the only hope of 
synthesis rests on the action of trimethylamine on II, and 
that this acid will have to be obtained from an appropriate 
thiolglyoxaline; that is to say, the formation of the thiol- 
glyoxaline ring cannot be postponed until the last stage. 

Dey (7) in 1937 described a new method of preparation 
of dl-thiolhistidine in hopes that it might lead to the 
ultimate synthesis of ergothioneine. In 1949, Winegard was 
reported to have been working on this problem (24). 

Harington and Overhoff used variations of the method 
of condensing an amino ketone with a thiocyanate salt to 
form the thiolglyoxaline ring. No work on ergothioneine

synthesis has been reported using the method described by 
Akabori (1) to form the thiolglyoxaline ring, i.e., con¬ 
densing an amino aldehyde with a thiocyanate, so this 
method was incorporated into a series of reactions which, 
theoretically, could produce ergothioneine, These are 
described below in the experimental part. The ease with 
which the sulfur group and the trimethylamine group are 
removed in ergothioneine reduces the number of types of 
reactions that may be employed.

The object of this method was to obtain °C-bromo- 
glutamic acid diethyl ester (IV) which, after the bromine 
group had been substituted for by trimethylamine, was to 
be reduced by sodium amalgam to the aminoaldehyde (V). 

Then on condensation of V with a thiocyanate, ergothioneine 
(VI) should result* oC-bromoglutamic acid has not been 
described in the literature and so its synthesis was attempt¬ 
ed using, first,red phosphorus and bromine* The amine 
group was protected from intermediate acid chloride that 
would be formed during the reaction, by benzoylation.

method of Fischer (12) from glutamic acid, sodium bicarbon-

The method used was essentially that described by Eck

and dropping funnel. Five gm. benzoylglutamic acid and

0.4 giru red phosphorus were mixed and cooled in the flask 
by means of an ice-mixture. About 10 ml. bromine was used 
in all. It was added slowly at first with stirring until 
the vigorus reaction with the phosphorus had subsided, then 
added more quickly. The mixture was then refluxed at 60- 

o 

70 C for 6 hours and then poured while warm into 30 ml* 
distilled water. A black, tarry material resulted with 
the evolution of heat. This was allowed to stand for an 
hour and then filtered. This material was dissolved in 
hot ethanol but could not be decolorized with charcoal. 

It was precipitated from cold ethanol by addition of water, 
whereupon about one-half the original amount of the tarry 
material came down again. The filtrate was concentrated 
in vacuo and allowed to stand. The solid that separated 
out gave a M.P. of 122°C on the second recrystallization, 
and a mixed melting point with benzoic acid of 122*0. 

It appeared that the benzoylglutamic acid was hydro¬ 
lyzed under these conditions of bromination. Probably the 
liberated amine group was then attacked by the intermediate 
acid chloride to form a resinous material. Attempts at 
bromination using varying temperatures and times of reflux¬ 
ing were likewise unsuccessful. 

Another method of bromination was tried, that of Schwenk 
and Papa (30) for the bromination of dibasic acids. The 
conditions of the reaction are less drastic and it was hoped 
to affect a bromination of the benzoylglutamic acid without

removal of the benzoyl group. 

Five gm. benzoylglutamic acid, 13 ml. thionyl chloride, 
and 10 ml. bromine were refluxed for 2 hours in a three¬ 
necked flask equipped for bromination. The material reacted 
vigorously in the cold at first, and after a few minutes 
turned dark in color, with a solid separating out* When 
the refluxed mixture was poured into water, a tarry material 
resulted. As with the other procedure, benzoic acid was 
recovered from the reaction mixture. 

It appears that the benzoyl group is easily removed 
from the amine group. The adjacent carbonyl group probably 
affects its reactivity, as Saunders (29), in preparing 
derivatives of monoaminodicarboxylic acids, found that the 
amine groups are much less reactive than those in other 
types of compounds.

The amino acid serine (I) was to be esterified and re¬ 
duced by sodium amalgam*\o its corresponding aminoaldehyde 
(III). On condensation with a thiocyanate, 2-thiol-4(or 5)- 
hydroxymethylglyoxaline (IV) should result. The synthesis 
of this compound was attempted by Harington and Overhoff but 
by other routes, as described in b and c of the introduction. 
IV was to be converted to the chloro derivative (V) by thio- 
nyl chloride or phosphorus pentachloride, and then by means 
of the malonic ester synthesis, o(-halogeno-A-2~thiolglyoxa“ 
linev4(or 5)-propionic acid is prepared. Treatment with 
trimethylamine should give ergothioneine* 

Serine methyl ester hyd r ochloride 

The preparation was essentially that of Fischer and 
Jacobs (13). Ten gm. serine was covered with 300 ml. dry 
methanol (prepared according to Fieser (11) ) f and satur¬ 
ated with dry HC1 gas. The clear liquid resulting was con¬ 
centrated under reduced pressure (not above 50°C) to a 
thick syrup and allowed to crystallize. To complete the 
esterification, the operation was repeated with half the 
amount of methanol. The crystals, which formed in the

cold, were mixed with a little ethanol, filtered and washed 
with ethanol and ether. A second crop was obtained from 
the mother liquor by concentrating down again after addition 
of more methanol and HC1 gas. Yield, 86$ of theoretical. 

Preparation of sodium amalgam. 

Sodium amalgam was prepared according to the method 
in Lassar-Cohn (21). 2.5 gnu clean metallic sodium was 

submerged in 97.5 gm. mercury in a small beaker. The 
sodium was held in place by a pair of tongs. The operat¬ 
ion was carried out in a fume chamber on account of the 
poisonous nature of the mercury fumes evolved. The reaction 
is violent and after about a minute the mixture bursts into 
flames. While still hot the sodium amalgam is stirred with 
a spatula until it solidifies. The amalgam is then obtain¬ 
ed in a crystalline form. If allowed to stand while cool¬ 
ing it sets to a hard mass which must be pulverized# 

Preparation of 2-thiol-4(or 5)-hydroxymethylglyoxaline 

3 gm. serine methyl ester hydrochloride was dissolved 
in 14 ml. methanol and 30 ml. water in a 300 ml. beaker 

o 

and kept at -10 C in an ice-salt mixture, with constant 
stirring. 80 gm, 2.5$ sodium amalgam, was added in small 
amounts over a period of 45 minutes. 5 N H01 was admitted 
dropwise during this time to keep the solution slightly 


acid. Stirring was continued for one-half hour longer

and the mercury then filtered off. 

Benedict’s test was nositive at this point indicat¬ 
ing successful aldehyde formation. The solution was con¬ 
centrated under reduced pressure to 40 ml. and filtered from 
the insolubles. The solution turned dark brown during this 
step but Benedict’s test was still positive. Then 3 gm. 
ammonium thiocyanate in 4 ml. water was added to the solut¬ 
ion of the aldehyde with stirring and the mixture evaporat¬ 
ed to dryness over a steam bath. After an hour, the react¬ 
ed 

ion mixture gave a positive Hunter test indicating formation 
of the thiolimidazole ring. The residue was warmed with 35 
ml. absolute alcohol and filtered after cooling. The alco¬ 
hol was distilled off in vacuo and the residue treated with 
20 ml. water and charcoal. The filtrate from this was con¬ 
centrated to a thick syrup and allowed to crystallize. 

2.5 gm. of crystals were collected and washed with a small 
amount of cold water. However they gave a negative Hunter 
test and a positive Nessler’s. The mother liquor still gave 
the positive Hunter test. 

During attempts at isolation of this compound, material 
was being formed that could not be redissolved in hot alco¬ 
hol. The mercury precipitation as described by Akabori 
was used in an attempt to further purify this thiolimidazole. 
The precipitate was decomposed by hydrogen sulfide and the 
filtrates from this step evaporated down. Crystals were 
obtained which gave a positive Nessler’s, negative Hunter’s 
test, and were insoluble in alcohol. It appeared that the

The object of this method was to condense the chloro 
derivative of serine (II) with ethyl sodicchloromalonate 
first, and to form the thiolimidazole ring later. The 
of-bromoglutamic acid (III) thus built up would be treated 
as in method 1 . 

Serine methyl ester hydrochloride 

This was prepared as for method 2. 

dl- 4-amino -ft -chloroproplonic acid hydrochloride 

This was prepared by the method of Fischer (14). 

10 gm. serine methyl ester hydrochloride was dried over 
P 2 O 5 , then finely pulverized and suspended in S7 ml. 
freshly distilled acetyl chloride in a stoppered bottle. 

It was cooled by ice water and 14.6 gm. pulverized PCI 5 
was added with shaking, in 3 portions in the course of 
10 - 15 minutes. The original solid disappeared. The 
mixture was then shaken on the machine for one hour, and 
allowed to stand in the cola overnight. The flocculent 
precipitate which settled was washed with acetyl chloride 
and petroleum ether. Yield 41#; M.P. 125°- 130*C with 
browning and evolution of gas.

compound was unstable and was decomposing since any ammon¬ 
ium salt impurities should not be carried through the 
mercury precipitation. During further trials at synthesis 
of this compound, potassium thiocyanate was used instead of 
the ammonium salt, for the formation of the ring. After 
the mercury precipitation, the filtrate was concentrated 
to about 4 ml. Material crystallized out which gave a pos¬ 
itive Nessler f s and an ammonium test with sodium hydroxide 
and litmus. Since none of the reactant materials contained 
the ammonium ion, the thiolimidazole ring was assumed to 
be decomposing. This might explain why Harington was 
unable to hydrolyze compound VIII successfully, as mention¬ 
ed in the introduction. This compound bears a resemblance 
to its analogous member in the glyoxaline series, hydroxy- 
methylglyoxaline, which Pyman (28) found to decompose when 
distilled under 20 mm. pressure. 

The above method of synthesis was discontinued and a 
variation of it attempted, but this was without success also# 
This was based on the following series of reactions.

Fischer states that the crystallization of the dl- 
compound is poor and the purification is difficult. Pre¬ 
vious trials at making this compound gave very poor yields, 
but the preparations exhibited the characteristic melting 
point with browning and evolution of gas. No success was 
had at crystallizing it from a methanol solution by ether, 
so the condensation with ethyl sodiomalonate was to be 
attempted without further purification of the product. If 
the condensation were successful, then the chloromalonate 
would be used. The HC1 group of the chloroserine ester 
must be neutralized before condensation with the sodiomal¬ 
onate, otherwise it would react before the chloro group. 

It was decided to neutralize the group, then add the free 
ester to the malonate for condensation. A 2% solution of 
sodium in dry methanol was used, with phenolphthalein as 
indicator. Sodium chloride precipitated out on addition 
of the sodium and the solution turned orange. Because of 
this, an attempt was made to recover the original material 
to make certain that the addition of sodium had not destroy¬ 
ed it. HG1 gas was passed in to bring the solution to the 
acid side. It was concentrated to dryness in vacuo and 
taken up in dry methanol. On precipitation with ether, no 
chloro-compound was regenerated. 

It was later learned that free a-amino esters on heat¬ 
ing, tend to form the dimolecular cyclic amides, and that free 
serine methyl ester itself, loses alcohol spontaneously to

form the diketo-piperazine (2). So this method was dis¬ 
carded since the chloroserine ester during condensation with 
the malonate would probably cyclize. 

4. Another theoretically possible mechanism that was devised 
used trimethyl-d-glutarobetaine (I) as the starting material*

insoluble in alcohol and ether and melts at 211 - 213 C. It

above, was attempted but without success* No crystals were 
formed from the final syrupy aqueous concentrate, and pre¬

gave a material of M*P. greater than 250°C,with blackening*

the difficulties encountered in obtaining any amount of 
starting material and because of the uncertainty in the 
literature regarding its correct formulation, it was deemed 
inadvisable to continue with this method, 

SUMMARY 

1. Pour possible mechanisms for the chemical synthesis of 
ergothioneine have been devised and tested. 

2. Bromination of benzoylglutamic acid lead to production 
of a tarry mass with the liberation of the benzoyl group. 

3. The preparation of 2-th.iol-4(or 5)-hydroxymethylglyox- 
aline has been described and its isolation attempted. It 
was found to be unstable. 

4. Method 3 was discarded because of the possibility of 
the free amino acid ester losing alcohol and forming the 
cyclic amide. 

5. Trimethyl-d-glutarobetaine could not be prepared satis¬ 
factorily as a starting material for the fourth method. 
Therefore this method of synthesis was also discarded.

PART B - B IOCHEMICAL SYNT H ESIS 

INTRODUCTION 

The presence of ergothioneine in the red blood cell 
has not been fully explained* Eagles and Vars (9) claim 
that diet, to a certain extent, affects the levels in 
animals. Potter and Franke (27) believe that ergothio¬ 
neine is entirely exogenous in origin, stating that vari¬ 
ations in pathological bloods are probably a result of the 
dietary regimes of the patients. The only diet found by 
Eagles and Vars, and Potter and Franke, to increase the 
ergothioneine level in blood was corn. The first named 
authors believe that an amino acid, 2-thiolhistidine, is 
probably present in corn and is the precursor of ergothio¬ 
neine. However, no one has, as yet, demonstrated the pre¬ 
sence of this amino acid. The latter authors give no 
suggestion as to the precursor of ergothioneine, but state 
that it is not likely to be glutathione, methionine, or 
thiolhistidine. 

If there is a precursor of ergothioneine in certain 
diets, the mechanism by which it is transformed into ergo¬ 
thioneine and eventually incorporated into the red blood 
cell is quite obscure. If the ergothioneine is produced 
in the body during the normal course of metabolism, then 
a study of factors and pathological conditions affecting 
theblood level may throw some light on its presence and

role in the organirm. 

The investigation into the biochemical synthesis 
took the form of a study of the effect of certain diet¬ 
ary factors on the blood ergothioneine level, in an 
attempt to determine whether ergothioneine is exogenous 
or endogenous in origin. If it were exogenous in origin, 
the problem was to determine the precursor(s). 

During the course of this work, some interesting leads 
concerning the mechanism whereby ergothioneine is incorpor¬ 
ated into the cell have arisen, and these are reported be¬ 


low

METHOD 

Experimental Animals - Weanling and adult male albino rats, 
Wistar strain, were used for all experiments. They were 
housed in metal cages and given abundant food and water. 
Weight gains were recorded, for the rats on special diets. 

Collection of blood sam ple - One to 1.5 ml. tail blood 
was collected by 1 ’milking T1 the blood, with stirring, 
into a small porcelain crucible containing 2 mgm. potass¬ 
ium oxalate monohydrate. Either 0.25 or 0.5 ml. blood 
wa? taken for the ergothioneine determination, and the 
remainder was pipetted into a hematocrit tube of approx¬ 
imately 1 ml. volume and spun at 3000 r.p.m., for 30 min¬ 
utes . 

Determination of ergothioneine - Ergothioneine was deter¬ 
mined in 0.5 and 1 ml. aliquots of the protein-free fil¬ 
trates of the blood according to the method of Hunter (19). 

Piets - The synthetic diets used contained the following; 


McCollum salts 

4 % 

cod liver oil 

2 % 

crisco 

3 % 

protein plus 


sucrose 

91 % 


To one kilogram of the above diet were added 10 mgm. 
thiamine hydrochloride, 10 mgm. niacin, 10 mgm. pyridoxin© 
hydrochloride, and 20 mgm. calcium pantothenate all dissolved 
in 10 ml. 70$ ethanol; and 20 mgm. riboflavin distributed in

EXPERIMENTAL 

I - THE PATE OF INGESTED SRGOTHIONEINE. 

The effect of ingestion of ergothioneine on blood ergo- 

thioneine levels . 

The only suggestions in the literature as to precursors 
of ergothioneine have been 2-thiolhistidine (9) and hist¬ 
idine (IS). Since ergothioneine occurs in most mammalian 
bloods, i.e,, it can be ingested with meats, and since it 
is present in some plant foods, mushrooms, dandelions,and 
possibly corn and flax (26), the following experiment was 
designed in order to determine whether ergothioneine, exist¬ 
ing as such in the diet, could affect the blood level. 

Three adult rats (250.- 300 gm.) were force fed from 
a pipette, a total of 100 mgm. ergothioneine each, in doses 
of 10 mgm. every 24 hours. Blood was taken 5 times the 
first day, 2 times the second day, and once a day thereafter. 
Blood was taken from the control rats at the same times, 
except that the 6, 30, and 48 hour bleedings were omitted. 
During the experiment, the animals were fed a 1:1 mixture 
of Purina and Victor Fox chow, finely ground and mixed 
to ensure homogeneity of diet. The results are shown in

Pig. 1•- Graph of results from Table 1. 

Pig. 1 shows that ingested ergothioneine causes increases 
in the blood level of this substance in rats about 4 or 5 
days after the first feeding. The feedings were discontin¬ 
ued on the ninth day and it took from . 3 to 5 weeks for the 
levels to approach normal values. No significant increase 
was detected in the first 30 hours after feeding.

Excretlon of the invested ergothioneine 

Urine and feces were collected from the ergothioneine- 
fed rats over a period of 96 hours, Ergothioneine was de¬ 
termined on 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 pi.aliquots of the 24, 

24 - 48, and 48 - 96 hour urine specimens, by the method 
developed by Siluch (31) of this laboratory using the 
paper chromatography technique. Hot water extracts of the 
feces were tested in the same manner. Both urine and feces 
extracts over the 96 hour period were negative for ergo¬ 
thioneine as tested by this method. It was therefore con¬ 
cluded that ergothioneine was not excreted, as detectable 
ergothioneine, when this compound was fed orally, 

Ergothioneine content of various organs 

Since the ergothioneine eventually increased in the 
blood, and since it was not excreted (as ergothioneine), 
we thought that perhaps it could be broken down in the 
gastro-intestinal tract, its products absorbed, and the 
ergothioneine resynthesized from all or some of the pro¬ 
ducts, This may have been the reason for its not being 
detected in the blood stream shortly after feeding. Or 
the possibility exists that the ergothioneine was stored 
in some organ of the body (especially the mucosa of the 
small intestine) and. that it was slowly released, in un¬ 
detectable amounts, to result in a gradual rise of con¬ 
centration in the red blood cells.

Rat III was sacrificed on the fourteenth day and 
determinations of ergothioneine on extracts of its organs 
were carried out in an attempt to determine the location 
of ergothioneine stores, if any. For a control, the org¬ 
ans of a normal rat were also analyzed for ergothioneine. 
The method used for extraction was the same as that des¬ 
cribed below for liver ergothioneine determinations, ex¬ 
cept that the extraction volumes varied according to the 
size of the organ. The results are shown in Table 2.

corpuscles, this more than 100 gm. corpuscles. Since 
liver tissue contains a greater percentage of water than 
the red blood corpuscles, then on a dry weight basis, these 
livers are more concentrated in ergothioneine than the 
red blood cells. Therefore, further ergothioneine deter¬ 
minations were carried out on other livers to confirm 
these findings, and these are reported below. The pre¬ 
sence of ergothioneine in the other organs tested could 
result from their content of blood in which ergothioneine 
was present in abnormally high concentrations. These 
same organs, other than liver, in normal animals gave poor 
ergothioneine tests, and mostly showed interference colors* 

Ergothioneine in Liver Tissue 

The following method of extracting and determining 
the ergothioneine content of liver was adopted: 

The rat was killed by decapitation and the liver 
was excised and washed with distilled water. It was dried 
with a clean cloth, weighed and placed in a boiling tube 
in a boiling water bath for 15 minutes* The contents of 
the tube were then ground in a mortar to a homogeneous 
paste, transferred, with washings, to a 100 ml. volumetric 
flask and again placed in a boiling water bath for 20 min¬ 
utes. The flask was cooled and made to volume. A one ml* 
aliquot was diluted to 5 ml. with distilled water, and the 
liver brei was centrifuged off* The supernatant was then

treated with 1 drop of Goulard f s and 1 drop of 10% 

NaHgPO^ solution as in the blood determination. Diazo 
tests were done on the final filtrate. A few of the tests 
on the extracts showed interference, but the results of 
only those livers whose extracts gave the typical red- 
purple diazo color are reported. Table 3 shows some 
ergothioneine values on rat livers, with blood ergo- 
thioneine levels reported for comparison. Results are 
included in this table for diabetic rats because it was 
noted by Gee (16) that abnormally high levels of ergo¬ 
thioneine were present in the blood of such animals*

In all the livers analyzed, the ergothioneine content was 
found to be greater than in the corpuscles. Possibly the 
liver has some role in removing the ergothioneine from the 
red blood cell, or in storing the ergothioneine unti}. it 
is incorporated into the cell. 

Application of corrections to blood ergothioneine values 

In the experiment on ergothioneine ingestion, the 
first rise in the blood ergothioneine of both, groups of 
rats was exhibited during the first 100 hours.(see Fig. 2). 
Because of the fairly severe blood loss in both groups 
of rats during the first few days of the experiment, it 
was necessary to consider exsanguination as a possible 
cause of this increase. Hunter’s (19) and Fraser’s (15) 
findings that plasma contributes to the whole blood ergo- 
thioneine color density were applied to the study of the 
rise in ergothioneine due to exsanguination. When the 
hematocrit Is low, the plasma contribution is consequent¬ 
ly Increased. Then, when the ergothioneine of blood with 
a low hematocrit is calculated on the basis of 100 ml. 
corpuscles, this increased plasma effect is also multi¬ 
plied, giving apparently higher ergothioneine values. 

The effect of exsanguination was studied over a period 
of 48 - 72 hours only, to parallel the rise indicated in 
Fig. 2, and it was concluded that the increased ergo¬ 
thioneine level was apparently due to a lowered hematocrit

and in some cases, a slightly increased plasma value. 

After the necessary corrections were applied to the ergo- 
thioneine values, any small increases in the blood ergo- 
thioneine then were considered insignificant, and probably 
resulted from slight variations in the diet. 

However, in later work (page52 ) where exsanguination 
was followed over a period of 12i days, it is clearly seen 
that exsanguination does cause an increase in blood ergo- 
thioneine. This increase does not become significant 
until after 72 hours, so this is why the first conclusions 
were erroneous. 

The part of this study that had any value was the 
application of plasma corrections to blood ergothioneine 
values. By Fraser r s method of freezing centrifuged blood, 
he was able to show that ergothioneine in the red cells 
plus the plasma effect in ergothioneine units equals the 
ergothioneine in the whole blood. Diazo tests on human 
plasma give a yellow color which represents in ergothio¬ 
neine units, an average value of 1.0 mgm. ergothioneine 
per ICO ml. plasma. An average of 10 determinations on 
rat serum ( serum was found to give the same value as 
plasma) gave a value in ergothioneine units of 1.5 t 
0.2 mgm. ergothioneine per 100 ml. serum. Fraser's 
freezing method applied to rat blood is not practical. 

The centrifuged cells, after freezing and thawing, can¬ 
not be pipetted because they are in the form of a very

thick paste. Therefore to confirm the belief that ergo- 
thioneine in the cells plus the plasma effect equals whole 
blood ergothioneine for rat blood as well as for human 
blood, the following data were collected,(see Table 4), 
Dilutions of the whole blood to produce varying hematocrit 
values on the same blood, were made with the serum rather 
than plasma because it was easier to obtain the serum free 
from hemolyzed cells* However, since both serum and plasma 
give the same ergothioneine color density, no error was 
introduced. 

Table 4 shows that whole blood ergothioneine minus 
the plasma effect that is proportional to the amount of 
plasma in the blood, gives constant values for ergothio-* 
neine in the cells. The error introduced when ergothio¬ 
neine values are not corrected for the plasma effect is 
significant in bloods of low hematocrit value, as seen 
in column 4(ergothioneine, mgm ,% corpuscles). 

Using the methods of calculations shown in the table, 
end the average value found for plasma (1*5), all ergothio¬ 
neine values in the subsequent experiments were corrected 
for the plasma effect.

II - THE EFFECT ON BLOOD EH GOTHION EINE LEVELS OF DIETARY 

SUPPLEMENTS. 

Effect of choline on blood ergothio n eine 1e vels . 

Ashley and Harington (3) believe that 2-thiolhist- 
idine can be methylated in vivo to produce ergothioneine. 
Therefore choline, acting as a source of transferable 
methyl groups, was studied in its effect on the blood 
ergothioneine level. 

Five rats (approximately 160 gnu each) were fed the 
10% casein diet with l gnu choline chloride per kgm. of 
diet added. Five control rats were fed the same diet, but 
without any choline. Blood was taken for ergothioneine 
determinations at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 weeks. The results 
are reported in Table 5. The graph of the results (Fig. 3) 
shows that choline in this diet does not affect the ergo¬ 
thioneine level. In both the choline-plus diet and the 
choline-free diet, there is a slight decrease in the ergo¬ 
thioneine l^vel until the third week, after which time the 
ergothioneine values drop rapidly and then remain more or 
less constant at a low level. This seems to be in agree¬ 
ment with the amount of time taken for the extra ergothio¬ 
neine of the ergothioneine-fed rats to be removed from the 
blood. 

The limiting factor in this experiment may be the casein 


itself. If some precursor is needed to be methylated to

then choline, as a source of labile methyl groups, 
would not alone increase the blood ergothioneine.

dffect of histidine on blood ergothioneine 

Because of the structural similarity between histi¬ 
dine and ergothioneine, it was thought that histidine 
might be a precursor of this compound.(18). Rats on 
corn diets show increases in blood ergothioneine (27) 
and in the albumin fraction of corn the histidine con¬ 
tent is 4-5$, greater than in most proteins. 

Histidine monohydrochloride was force fed from a 
pipette at a level of 60 mgm. per day, as a supplement 
to a low protein barley diet described by Tuba, Cantor, 
and Richards (36). This amount of histidine was calcu¬ 
lated to be approximately twice the daily requirement on 
the basis that food consumption was 10 gm. per animal 
per day. The rats on the control diet were not fed the 
histidine supplement. The results are tabulated in 
Table 6. Rats on Purina Fox chow show increases in 
blood ergothioneine in less than four weeks, so this 
length of time was deemed sufficient for assaying other 
diets for their ability to increase blood ergothioneine.

Low protein barley diets result in a general decrease in 
blood ergothioneine* and histidine supplements have no 
effect in increasing the level. In case the overall 
deficiency of amino acids affected the possible conversion 
of histidine to ergothioneine* this experiment was repeat¬ 
ed with a 10% casein diet supplemented with 60 mgm. histi¬ 
dine per day. The same decreases in ergothioneine were 
noted as with the choline diets, i.e., a slow decrease 
for about 3 weeks, and then a sharper drop (see Table 7).

Effect of methionine on blood ergothioncine. 

Because of the presence of sulfur and labile methyl 
group; in the methionine molecule, the effect of this 
compound in the diet on the blood ergothioneine was 
studied* Methionine was added to a 1:1 mixture of 
ground Purina and Victor Pox checkers at a level of 
0.5$, and fed to a group of 5 adult rats (125 - 150 gm. 
each). The control group received the same diet but 
without added methionine. Table 8 shows that both groups 
exhibited a slight but insignificant rise in blood ergo¬ 
thioneine. The rats used for this experiment were taken 
from the stock cage where they had received mostly 
Victor checkers as food. The slight rise in ergothio¬ 
neine noted in this experiment may have been a result 
of changing from this stock diet to the 1:1 mixture, 
described above.

Comoarison of high fat, high pro tei n, and high carbo¬

Diabetic rats were observed to have abnormally 
high ergothioneine values (16). Since fat and carbo¬ 
hydrate metabolism, is altered in this condition, the 
effect of diets with varying amounts of these substances 
on the blood ergothioneine level was studied. 

Groups of 8 weanling rats were started on the

All types of diets cause a lowering of the blood ergo- 
thioneine. At the end of six weeks there was no ergo- 
thioneine detectable in the blood filtrates of rat3 on 
the control and high protein diets. Fig. 4 shows that 
the richer the diet is in casein, the more effective it 
is in lowering the blood ergothioneine. The reason for 
this is unknown. The control rats were placed on Purina 
Fox checkers at the end of the experiment. A month later 
these eight rats had an average blood ergothioneine value 
of 9.7 mgm.;^ corpuscles. It appeared quite probable 
that the casein lacked some factor necessary to increase 
blood ergothioneine, and that this factor was present in 
Purina Fox checkers. The fact that diets with increased 
content of casein show increased effectiveness in lower¬ 
ing blood ergothioneine levels may suggest also that 
either increased protein metabolism causes the ergothio¬ 
neine to decrease, or that there is some inhibitory effect 
on the ergothioneine production,in casein. 

No noticeable symptons were observed in these rats 
other than poor growth on all but the control diet.

Effect of dried blood and dried liver supplements on 

blood ergothioneine, 

Since our rats showed marked elevations in blood 
ergothioneine when they were taken off the synthetic diets 
and placed on Purina Fox checkers, we tried to determine 
the dietary factors responsible. Among the ingredients 
of Purina Fox chow that might cause a rise in blood ergo¬ 
thioneine were: animal liver meal, dried yeast, fish 
meal, meat meal, and soybean oil meal. It is possible 
for some of these ingredients to contain ergothioneine 
or some precursor. 

We then determined the effect of dried blood and 
dried liver supplements on the blood ergothioneine. Two 
groups of seven rats each were fed diets of 10$ casein 
plus 10$ dried hog liver, and 10$ casein plus 10$ dried 
hog red blood cells. Ergothioneine determinations showed 
a level of 6.1 mgm.$ corpuscles in the hog blood, but no 
value was obtained for the hog liver because of interfer¬ 
ence. The average results for the sesren rats on the two 
diets are reported in Table 10.

Rats receiving the dried liver supplement showed a 
decrease in blood ergothioneine, while those receiving 
the blood supplement showed a slight increase.. This 
increase was not marked but it did show that ergothioneine 
was being replaced, to keep the level from, falling. 

About the time this experiment ended, we had at our 
disposal some rats that had been fed on 40$ casein, and 
consequently had low ergothioneine levels. These rats 
were given the dried blood supplement to determine how 
much of an increase in ergothioneine would result by 
starting with an initial low level. The experiment was 
concluded at the end of four weeks. Table 11 shows the 


results.

Table 11 shows that 10^ casein in the diet does not inhibit 
the ergo thioneine rise to any extent (Pig. 4, page 38,/ 
suggests the possibility that there is some inhibitory 
effect shown by casein which could prevent the ergothio¬ 
neine level from rising). The above experiment also 
indicated the importance of using rats with initially 
low ergothioneine levels when assaying diets for ergothio- 
neine-producing ability. The reason for this will be 
discussed following a later experiment. 

The factor in blood supplement responsible for the 
rise in ergothioneine could be ergothioneine itself. 

Further experiments should be carried out with blood 
supplement that has had its ergothioneine destroyed, 
perhaps through mild oxidation, to ascertain whether 
any compound other than ergothioneine could cause this 


rise

On the factor in Purina Fox chow responsible for its ergo - 

thioneine-oroducing ability. 

There was no ergothioneine detectable in Purina Pox 
checkers; however, a water extract, when analyzed, did 
give a yellow coupling color with a slight orange color¬ 
ation on addition of base. 

Water and ether extracts were made of finely ground 
Purina checkers and these along with th© residue were fed 
to groups of three rats each which had previously been on 
a 40 % casein diet. 

The diets were made up as follows: 

1. Control (finely ground Purina checkers). 

2. HgO extract from 1 kgm. checkers was added to 1 kgm. 
ground checkers. 300 Jjm. checkers were extracted 3 
times with a total of 2500 ml. hot water, acidified 
with several drops of acetic acid. This extract was 
concentrated in vacuo to a thick paste and mixed with 
300 gm. dry, ground checkers. 

3. The fat extract from 1 kgm. checkers was mixed with 

1 kgm. ground Purina checkers. One kgm. of the res¬ 
idue from the water extract was ether extracted for 
16 hours. The ether extracts were concentrated and 
added to 1 kgm. dry, ground checkers. 

4. Residue from the ether extract. 


The results are shown in Table 12

Table 12 shows that the residue does not contain the ergo¬ 
thioneine precursor. The results from the other diets are 
not significant enough to draw any conclusions. At the 
time this experiment was started, results from experiments 
described on pages 37 and 41 were known, i.e., that casein 
diets caused a lowering in the blood ergothioneine and that 
rises in ergothioneine in rats fed casein plus blood supp¬ 
lement were only slight (perhaps because of an inhibitory 
effect by the casein), so the extracts for this experiment 
were added to the control diet rather than to a diet with 
casein as base. It was hoped that if the ergothioneine- 
producing factor were contained in the water or ether ex¬ 
tract, a much greater rise would be given with the control

plus water extract, or the control plus ether extract, than 
with the control diet alone (it was known from the experi¬ 
ment on page 20, that feeding ergothioneine can raise the 
blood level to a high value). Concurrently with this ex¬ 
periment was run another reported on page 42, but its 
results were not known in time to apply to this experiment. 
It appears that ergothioneine-producing diets do not cause 
much of an increase in blood ergothioneine levels when this 
substance is already present in fairly high concentrations, 
but if the rats begin with an initially low level, the 
rise is quite significant. Also from that experiment, it 
was learned that 10% casein as a basal diet, did not 
exert any appreciable inhibitory effect on the rise in 
blood ergothioneine® 

The water or ether extract may have the ergothioneine- 
producing factor present, but any rise is difficult to in¬ 
terpret when all three diets produced a more or less maxi¬ 
mum level within a month. Therefore this experiment 
should be repeated, adding the extracts to diets with 10% 
casein as base.

III - THE FATE OF INJECTED ERGOTHIONEINE, 

The remo va l o f inje c ted ergothioneine from the blood • 

In a trial experiment, one adult rat was injected 
intravenously with 10 mgm. ergothioneine in normal saline, 
through the tail vein. Tail blood was taken 1 hour after 
injection and the rat was killed by decapitation and the 
blood was collected for serum. The liver was analyzed. 

No urine could be aspirated from the bladder for the 
estimation of ergothioneine. The results are tabulated 
below,in Table 13.

Prom the above table, it can be seen that all the ergo- 
thioneine has been removed from the plasma within an 
hour. There was no significant rise in the ergothioneine 
in the corpuscles, so it unlikely that ergothioneine 
can diffuse from the plasma into the red cells. 

Nephrectorn!zed rats injected with erg o thioneine • 

Prom the preceeding experiment, we concluded that 
either some organ was removing the ergothioneine from 
the blood stream or it was being excreted by the kidneys. 
If the latter were the case, there is a possibility that 
the ergothioneine could be excreted in some undetectable 
form. Bilateral nephrectomies on rats would eliminate 
altogether this possible route of excretion and more 
positive information would result than attempting to 
determine ergothioneine in the urine. 

Bilateral nephrectomies were performed on two rats 
followeddby injections of 10 mgm. ergothioneine in nor¬ 
mal saline into the tail vein. The results from rat I 
are tabulated in Table 14.

Table 14 shows that the greater part of the injected ergo¬

neys. Whereas all the ergothioneine was removed from the 
plasma in an hour in normal rats, there still remained 
about 0.7 mgm. of the injected ergothioneine circulating 
in the blood of the nephrectomized rat two hours after 
the injection. This value (0.7 mgm.) was obtained from 
the following approximations;

The fact that this amount of ergothioneine remained in the 
plasma of the nephrectomized rat may mean that the ergo¬ 
thioneine is excreted by the kidney after a certain satur¬ 
ation is reached by the organ or agents responsible for 
removing the greater part of the ergothioneine from the 
plasma. With the kidneys removed, this ergothioneine then 
remains in the plasma. We thought that if another injection 
of ergothioneine were given, the ergothioneine in the plas¬ 
ma should rise considerably. This was attempted with rat 
II. The results are given in Table 15.

Most of the ergothioneine had been removed from the plas¬

The effect of injected ergothioneine on the blood ergo - 

thioneine level. 

In view of the facts that most of the injected ergo- 
thioneine was removed from the plasma of the nephrectomized 
rats (i.e., it was not all excreted), and that it took 4 
or 5 days for the ergothioneine to increase in the blood 
after feeding it to normal rats, the effect of the inject¬ 
ed ergothioneine was followed over a short period of time 
in normal rats. At the conclusion of one of the exper¬ 
iments performed by other workers in this laboratory, six 
rats were available that had been injected intravenously 
with 5 mgm. ergothioneine. Hats 4, 6, 8, and 11 had 
received alloxan with their injection. Table 16 shows 
that after several days the ergothioneine rises in the 
red blood cells, since no ergothioneine was demonstrated 
in the plasma. No controls were used for this trial ex¬ 
periment because from previous work, rats on the stock 
diet were known to have an insignificant rise in their 
ergothioneine levels over this short period of time.

Applying this information to the feeding experiment with 
ergothioneine, we can easily see how it is possible for 
the ergothioneine to be absorbed through the wall of the 
intestine into the blood stream* Here it is quickly re¬ 
moved by some organ, and therefore cannot be detected in 
the blood by the diazo test. Then four or five days later, 
it appears in the red blood cells. The problem of bow 
this injected ergothioneine was removed from the blood 
stream was not further investigated. 

The effect of exsangulnatlon on blood ergothioneine levels . 

Ergothioneine does not appear to diffuse from the 
plasma into the red blood cell in vivo ( see experiment, 
page 46), nor does it seem probable that after 4 or 5 
days, the injected ergothioneine is taken up, all at once, 
by the circulating old red blood cells. However, this lag 
in the appearance of ergothioneine in the red cell may 
mean that the ergothioneine is mobilized for incorporation 
into new cells, and not until these new cells,with their 
increased ergothioneine content, are thrown into circulation 
will the blood ergothioneine level increase. A trial ex¬ 
periment was devised to obtain some information regarding 
this. Two rats (#2 and #5) were given one injection of 
lo mgm. ergothioneine and were made anemic through contin¬ 
uous bleeding. If the appearance in the blood stream of 
the injected ’ergothioneine awaits production of new cells, 
then the rats (#2 and#5) which have been exsanguinated

(reticulocyte production probably stimulated), should show 
a more rapid rise in blood ergothioneine than rets (#4 and 
#6) which have been injected but bled less often (normal 
reticulocyte production). Two control rats (#1 and #3) 
were given no injections tut were bled at the same times 
as rats 2 and 5. Plasma ergothioneine dterminations 
were done for all blood samples. The results are reported 
as mgm .% corpuscles, corrected for the plasma effect, in

O A Q 


Hats 2, 5, 4, and 6 - Injected with 10 mgn. ergothioneine. 
Ret? 1 and 3 - controls 
















-55- 


All four rats that were injected show increased ergothio- 
neine levels, but the two rats that have been bled frequent¬ 
ly (#2 and #5) show the greatest increase. Ergothioneine 
has also increased in the blood of the control rats that 
were exsanguinated. From previous experiments, we knew 
that rats on stock diets that are not bled often, show 
fluctuations in the ergothioneine level of only 1 or 2 
mgm.$ corpuscles in this same short period of time. 

Therefore, two other control rats not injected with ergo¬ 
thioneine and bled at the same times as rats 4 and 6 were 
not considered necessary. 

From this trial experiment it is quite evident that 
exsanguination causes an increase in the blood ergothioneine. 
If we assume in this experiment that reticulocyte formation 
was increased because of the exsanguination, and that the 
old red blood cells did not increase in their ergothioneine 
content, then variations in the blood ergothioneine levels 
in the above experiment may be explained on several factors. 

a. If reticulocytes are produced that have the same concen¬ 
tration of ergothioneine per cell as the average in the 
circulating erythrocyted, then since the reticulocytes are 
larger than the erythrocytes, for the same volume of cor¬ 
puscles, the blood richer in reticulocytes will have a 
smaller concentration of ergothioneine. This effect would 
tend to decrease the ergothioneine content of the blood of 
the rats that have been bj.ed frequently and it makes the

results obtained above all the more significant, 
b. If reticulocytes are produce that have a greater 
content of ergothioneine per cell than the average amount 
in the circulating erythrocytes, then as the ratio of 
reticulocytes to erythrocytes increases, the ergothioneine 
level will increase. Rats 2, 5, 4, and 6 could show this 
effect because the source of ergothioneine to the rat was 
increased through injection. However, rats 1 and 3 can be 
assumed to have a more or less constant source of ergothio¬ 
neine arising from their stock diet. Since their blood 
level increased after exsanguination, it suggests the possi¬ 
bility that, normally, new cells may be produced that contain 
more ergothioneine than'is present in the old cells. This 
means,then, that as the cell grows older, its ergothioneine 
content decreases. Perhaps in this way, ergothioneine 
performs.a function in the red blood cell which causes its 
concentration to decrease* 

This experiment should open un new pathways for fut¬ 
ure research on this subject. Ergothioneine its;elf can 
be used to study the mechanism whereby this compound is 
incorporated into the red cell. With the chemical synthesis 
of this compound, ergothioneine with labeled, elements 
should be available for a more complete stud$ of its role 
in the organism*

SUMMARY 

1. Ingestion of ergothioneine can result in increases 
in blood ergothioneine in the rat. 

2. Ingested ergothioneine was not excreted in any detect¬ 
able form in urine or feces, as tested by our methods. 

3. A method of extraction of ergothioneine from liver 

tissue has been described. In the rat, ergothioneine was 

found to be more concentrated in the liver than in the 
corpuscles, based on a dry weight basis. 

4. Choline has no effect in increasing blood ergothioneine 
when it is fed with a casein diet. 

5. Histidine supplement to a low protein barley diet was 
found to have no effect on the blood ergothioneine level. 

6. Low protein barley diets resulted in a general decrease 
in the blood ergothioneine level in rats. 

7. Methionine had no effect in increasing the blood ergothioneine 
when it was fed with a 1:1 mixture of Purina and Victor Fox 
checkers. 

8. Diets with increased percentage of casein showed increased 
effectiveness in lowering the blood ergothioneine levels 
in weanling rats. 

9. Dried blood supplements added to a 10 % casein diet were 
effective in increasing blood ergothioneine, probably 
because of the ergothioneine content in the blood. 

10..Purina Fox checkers caused increases in blood ergothioneine. 
The factor in the diet could be removed by extracting with

either one of hot water or ether. 

12. Injected ergothioneine was completely removed from th e 
plasma within an hour of the injection. 

13. Nephrectomized rats injected with ergothioneine were 
not able to completely remove the ergothioneine from 
the plasma within 2 hours. About 10% of the injected 
ergothioneine remained circulating in the jhlasma. 

14. Injected ergothioneine caused increases in the blood 
ergothioneine level about 3 or 4 days after the inject¬ 
ion. 

15. Exsanguination of rats which have ergothioneine pre¬ 
sent in the blood, caused increases in the blood ergo¬ 
thioneine.
