INTRODUCTION 


The quantitative composition of fruits and vege¬ 
tables varies with the geographic location, climatic 
conditions, season, variety, and within fairly wide 
limits during the ripening process. Analysis made on 
fruits and vegetables grown in other parts of the conti¬ 
nent are therefore not respresentative of these crops 
when produced in Alberta. 

Experimental work in raw foods makes possible the 
establishment of criteria of quality for their production 
and evaluation in terms independent of personal judgment. 
Such quality terms to be generally understood and repro- 
duceable must represent accurate measurement and indicate 
the preferences of the majority of the population. 

The main objects of this study are: 

1. To measure and understand fluctuations and 
effects of certain chemical components of fruits and 
vegetables which are of importance in establishing quality 
and maturity indices. 

2. To provide a useful definition of desirable 
quality characteristics to be attained in the development 
of new varieties.

LlTilRATURl RiSVIOT 

In order that the effects of carbohydrate and acid 
contents on the quality of the product may be better under¬ 
stood it seems desirable that their occurrence and character¬ 
istics be discussed in a general way at the outset. 

Carbohydrates 

In most edible fruits and many vegetables the solid 
constituents, water soluble or otherwise, are predominantly 
sugars, starches, and cellulose. 

Cellulose is responsible for toughness or stringiness 
of the product and makes up the cell wall but is not utilized 
in human digestion nor has it any effect on taste or odour; 
it therefore contributes nothing to the food value, but 
may greatly influence the coarseness or tenderness of the 
product. Platenius^*^ used a measure of cellulose content 
of carrots as an indication of their tenderness. He 
found old roots to be no higher than young roots in 
cellulose. His results indicate that cellulose differs in 
its degree of toughness, depending on age and very likely 
climatic factors. 

The potato has a major portion of its carbohydrate 
in the form of starch which is insoluble and tasteless. 

Hence, the quality of such a product is not based on carbo¬ 
hydrate content to the same extent as it is in many other 
vegetables and nearly all fruits where most of the digest-

ible carbohydrate is present in the form of water-soluble 
sugars. 

Sugars are very significant contributors to the taste 
and flavour of foods. This study will deal, therefore, mostly 
with plant products whose quality depends largely on solids 
dissolved in their respective plant juices. The principal 
sugars present are sucrose or cane sugar, levulose (fructose) 
or fruit sugar, and glucose (dextrose) or grape sugar. 

Pentoses and other sugars may also be involved but are of 
no importance in nutrition generally( 40 ^• 

Sweetness of Sugars 

The relative sweetness of the various sugars is an 
important factor to be considered where sweetness plays a 
large part in determining quality. Hawk and Bergeimt 2 ^ 
give the following ratings for the sweetness of sucrose, 
glucose and fructose: sucrose, 100.0; glucose, 74.3; 
fructose, 173.3. Thus, the sweetness of a product is due 
not only to the total amount of sugars present but also to 
the kind of sugars and to their proportions. 

Archbold^ made a detailed study over a period of 
years on sugars and acids of the apple in connection with 
the stored product. 

The carrot is a good representative of a product 
whose desirability depends largely on its sweetness. Sugar 
content is, therefore, an important indicator of quality 
in carrots. Platenius^ 32 ^ found that sucrose and glucose 
were the only sugars present in quantity in carrots, ^special-

ly was the absence of fructose assured. Since the sweeten¬ 
ing power of glucose is only 74.3% that of an equal quantity 
of sucrose, changes in the ratio between glucose and sucrose 
become important as well as the total amount of sugars 
present. Platenius found that eating quality, based on 
sweetness and fibre content, of old or mature carrots was 
better or equal to that of young carrots. The percentage of 
total sugars remained fairly constant during growth, but 
sucrose increased and glucose diminished as the roots matured. 
Thus it was concluded that as roots matured sweetness 
according to taste increased. 

Carbohydrate Changes in Storage 

During ripening processes and in storage, carbohydrates 

are continually being hydrolysed and utilized in respiration. 

These processes make great changes in flavour and quality 

of the product. Starch is present in many fruits to some 

extent, particularly in the immature stages. In ripening 

and storage much, if not all, of this starch is hydrolysed 

to its monosaccharide component glucose, in which form it 

contributes to the sweetness of the product, where as starch 

it contributed nothing to the flavour. Prolonged storage 

otic/ i zed 

depletes monosaccharide sugars as these are first hydrolysed 
by respiration and total sugars and sweetness will therefore 
in time be lowered. This aspect is considered in more detail 
later because of its relation to organic acids.

Sucrose is present in large quantities in many fruits. 
The breakdown or hydrolysis products of sucrose are glucose 
and fructose in equal proportions and this combination is 
known as invert sugar. This term arises from the change in 
specific rotation when sucrose is hydrolysed to glucose and 
fr*-icrose; sucrose has a positive specific rotation of 66 and 
invert sugar a negative specific rotation of 19. Invert 
sugar is sweeter to the taste than sucrose, about 124:100. 
Thus on hydrolysis of sucrose to invert sugar an increase 
in sweetness occurs with little or no increase in the amount 
of sugar by weight. 


Organic Acids 

In nearly all fruits and in a few vegetables organic 
acids contribute much to the flavour and palatability. If 
in some way a naturally high acid plant product is rendered 
low in acid by such means as overripening or prolonged storage, 
the product becomes very tasteless and is no longer desirable. 
Organic acids constitute a portion of the total soluble 
solids of plant tissue but on a percentage basis this is 
small compared to the carbohydrate content, except with a 
very few such as rhubarb and lemons, nor example, with well 
matured oranges (a fruit considered relatively high in acid) 
a ratio of 8:1 of total soluble solids to acid content, 
roughly, is maintained^ 9 ^. The acids present in the largest 
proportions in edible plant parts are malic and citric. 

Others present to some extent in some fruits and plant parts 
are tartaric, oxalic, succinic, tannic, benzoic, and quinic.

Bomtrager^ concluded that the only organic acids 
present in sound green, half-ripe or ripe tomatoes are citric 
and malic. In softened but not entirely spoiled tomatoes 
succinic acid was found, in ripe tomatoes citric acid 
occurred chiefly in the form of primary citrates, with less 
secondary citrates; malic acid was present mainly as an acid 
salt. The content of free acid calculated as malic was 
never over 0.05%. The percentage of' phosphates in tomato 
juice increased as the fruit ripened. 

Vickery and Pucker^ 41 ) found oxalic acid to predominat 
in the leaf-blade of rhubarb, with malic and citric present 
in relatively small amounts. Malic acid predominated in 
the petioles. They found evidence of a gradient in concentra 
tion of acids from the leaf-blades (highest in oxalicj to 
the petiole (highest in malic). 

Bigelow and Dunbarfound citric and malic acids 
to be the characteristic acids of fresh fruit juices, 
excluding grape juice which is high in both tartaric and 
malic. Succinic acid is found in small quantities in fresh 
fruit, especially in the unripe condition, (unlike the 
tomato, Bomtrager^ 4 ) . In berries, in general, citric acid 
predominates and most of them contain, in addition, malic 
acid in very small quantities. Malic acid predominates in 
stone fruits (cherries and plums) but is not present 
exclusively. In pome fruits, such as the apple and pear, 
malic acid predominates or is almost exclusively present 
except for a small amount of tannic acid. The total acidity

of berries should therefore be expressed as anhydrous 
citric acid and of stone and pome fruits as anhydrous malic 
acid. Belov/ is a list of the common fruits with the 
principal acids contained in them:

The above generalizations were made by Bigelow and 
Dunbar^ but were not put forward as final. The results 
obtained with pears emphasize the danger of drawing general 
conclusions on the acids of fruits from the analysis of a 
limited number of samples. In most cases, a large number 
of samples were analysed and in general the conclusions 
above are believed to be correct. 








8 . 


Effect of Acid on Quality 

Acids contribute much to the flavour and palatability 
of most fruits and some vegetables. Neutralization of 
natural plant acids usually renders the product undesirable 
as food. Certain plant foods by the addition of a small 
amount of acid are made more palatable and of higher flavour, 
e.g., the addition of vinegar to salads. Acids add a 
pleasant tartness or tang to flavours which would otherwise 
be unnoticeable. 

Charley and Harrison^ 10 ^ state that the three fruit 
acids, citric, tartaric, and malic, give different flavour 
effects. Citric acid provides a penetrating, refreshing 
acidity with a definite "lemonade" character; tartaric acid 
is refreshing without the excessive sharpness of citric 
acid; malic acid gives the softest acid character of the 
three and its addition to apple juice cannot be detected 
by tasting. These acids are used for increasing acidity of 
fruit juices made from sub-acid varieties. Of the three 
acids tartaric is probably the best suited to normal 
requirements. 

The effect of acid on tartness and astringency of 
taste depends to a large extent on whether the acid is 
dissociated to a small or large degree. That is, measures 
of pH and total or titratable acidity are important. A 
brief comparison of lemon and strawberry juice will 
illustrate this. The actual acidity or pH of strawberry 
juice is greater than that of lemon juice. However, the

total acidity of lemon juice is 5 times that of the straw¬ 
berry. The difference in tastes of lemon and strawberry 
juices is well known. Total acidity of the juice and not 
pH is responsible for the greater share of the sour taste. 
Comparison of these two juices is an extreme case, and the 
effect may not be entirely due to differences in H-ion 
concentrations as different acids are present and the sugar 
content of strawberries is slightly higher. 

Harvey^ 22 ^ studied the effect of pH as compared with 
total acidity on the sour taste of solutions. Using buffer 
solutions he prepared dilutions having the same pH, but 
differing widely in total acidity, and also a converse series. 
By comparing these dilutions, which were of sodium acetate 
and acetic acid, with HC1 (which is almost completely 
ionized at dilutions which can be tasted, and has therefore 
a hydrogen ion concentration equal to its total acidity), 
it was concluded that total acidity more than pH determines 
the sour taste of acids. 

A possible explanation of this observation may be 
had by mention of work done by Kahlenberg^). He found 
that the penetration of molecules through a membrane is much 
faster than that of ions. Molecules in solution are able 
to move independently- of one another, whereas ions can not 
get far apart because they are slowed down by attractive 
forces on one another. There also is a repulsion of certain 
ions from particular membrane surfaces. For these reasons,

it is believed that molecules penetrate the taste nerves 
more rapidly than do ions. A non-dissociated acid would 
then be more sour to the taste than a highly dissociated or 
ionized one, though its actual acidity might be far less. 

Harding, Kinston, and Fisher^ 19 ) found that doubling 
the citric acid content at a definite pH increased the sour 
taste more than did increasing the hydrogen ion concentration 
ten times (lowering the pH one unit) at the same total acid 
content. With oranges, total acidity decreased and pH 
reading increases as the fruit ripens; both of these changes 
cause the fruit to taste less sour. It is certain, however, 
that decreasing total acidity is the predominating factor 
in this change. Thus, total acidity supplies a better 
basis for a quality standard than do measurements of pH. 

The amount of sugar required for sweetening in 
preserving acid fruits bears a direct relationship to the 
total acidity of the raw product but not to the pH. The 
naturally-occurring sugars present in these products must 
also be considered when sugar is added for sweetening. 

Food Value of Organic Acids 

Charley and Harrison^ 10 ) state that organic acids 
such as citric, malic and tartaric not only influence the 
flavours and appeal of fruit juice but exert a stimulating 
effect on the digestive glands. In addition they also are 
believed to assist in preventing undesirable accumulation 
of certain bases of the alimentary canal. They also serve

to protect vitamins from the effect of heat during process¬ 
ing. Hawk and Bergeim^ 23 ^ have the following to say about 
acid- and base-forming foods. Certain foods such as vege¬ 
tables and fruits, on burning outsiae or inside the body, 
leave an ash or residue in which the basic elements (sodium, 
potassium, calcium, magnesium) predominate, whereas cereals, 
meat and fish foods leave an ash in which the acid-forming 
elements (chlorine, phosphorus, and sulphur) predominate. 

The former are spoken of as base-forming foods, the latter 
as acid-forming, and decrease or increase the acidity of the 
urine. High protein foods are usually high in sulphur, 
which is oxidized to form H 2 SO 4 and hence is acid-forming. 

On the other hand, citrus fruits contain citric acid and 
acid potassium citrate, the citrate radicals of which are 
completely oxidized in the body to carbonic acid, leaving 
the potassium as a carbonate with an alkaline reaction. 

Hence, many acid fruits are base forming.. Grape juice, 
high in tartaric acid, is not nearly as effective as orange 
juice in reducing urine acidity as the tartaric acid is 
not completely oxidized but is eliminated to a certain extent 
as such. Prunes and cranberries, contain benzoic and quinic 
acids which are excreted in the urine chiefly in the form 
of hippuric acid which increases the acidity of the urine. 

The acid- or base-forming value of foods may thus be 
calculated by obtaining the difference between the equiva¬ 
lents of acid-forming elements and of base-forming elements 
present.

Fruits and vegetables are distinctly base-forming 
foods; animal protein foods (excepting milk) and cereals 
are acid-forming. Through the use of considerable amounts 
of fruits and vegetables it is possible to markedly lower

the acidity of the urine or even to make it alkaline. This 
decrease in acidity may reduce a tendency to formation of 
uric acid calculi of the urinary bladder. A certain balance 
of acid- and base-forming foods is desirable since too 
much acid-forming food might be a drain upon the fixed 
alkalis of the blood. High acid conditions are usually 
met by the body's ability to protect itself by means of 
ammonia production, and is seldom harmful if mineral, 
vitamin, and other dietary requirements are met. 

In the A.I.Y. method( 42 ^ for the preservation of 
silage, mineral acids are added to the fodder till a pH 

of less than 4 is reached and maintained. At this low pH 

the fodder will keep excellently and the carotene content 
is preserved intact. Without the addition of the acid the 

pH of the fodder will be 5 or above. At this pH level the 

silage soon spoils and carotene is almost completely 
destroyed. 

Behaviour of Organic Acids in Bipening 

Harding, Winston, and Fisher(19) found the following 
changes to occur in the ripening of oranges. The buffer 
capacity of the juice increased with the ripening of the 
fruit. This was confirmed by analysis of the juice for 
ash content. The presence of these elements together with 
the organic acids make up the buffers. The ash of the 
juice was made up largely of potassium, calcium, magnesium, 
and sodium salts, and increased as the fruit ripened.

Ripe-orange juice is therefore a better alkalizing food 
than is the juice from unripe fruit. 

Archbold^) reports from his work on apples that 
acid concentration increases during the first three weeks 
of fruit growth on the tree, ij'rom about that time till 
maturity there is a gradual drop in acia concentration, 
although the total amount of acid per fruit increases till 
growth ceases. 

Sugar ana Acid Behaviour in Storage 
Normal changes in apples^) in storage at 1°C. under¬ 
go three stages of decrease in dry weight of the fruit. 

The first stage is characterized by a very slow rate of 
decrease in solids and is accounted for in the decrease of 
acids; this period is about 35 days long. Sugar content 
remains at approximately the same level; if starch is 
present it will be hydrolysed during this stage and thus 
increase the sugar content. This first stage in storage 
therefore results in a sweetening of the fruit owing to 
both lowering of acid and in some cases to increase of 
sugar content. While starch is present the increase in 
sugar is in the form of glucose or reducing sugar from 
the starch hydrolysis; sucrose is therefore constant. 

The second stage begins with an increase in the 
loss of dry weight and usually when the starch has been 
depleted. The inversion of sucrose now supplies the 
materials for oxidation in respiration except for a small

amount supplied by acid. Reducing sugars rise to a 
maximum value, the rate of inversion being always greater 
or equal to the rate of oxidation. This maximum value of 
reducing sugar is generally maintained for a considerable 
time, in some cases as much as 150 days. Since only 
fructose is accumulated during the increase of reducing 
sugar, the glucose produced by inversion is presumably 
preferentially oxidized, and as the reducing sugar rises 
to its maximum an increasing amount of the fructose is used* 
The predominance of fructose as the second stage progresses 
helps to maintain the sweetness of the fruit on a level 
basis even though total sugar is being decreased. A slight 
decrease in acid also tends to increase sweetness. 

In the third stage, sucrose inversion ceases and 
stable reducing sugars are oxidized* There is also a 
second increase in the rate of loss of dry weight (solids); 
this is also accompanied by a large increase in the rate 
of acid loss. At this stage apples become very susceptible 
to disease and internal breakdown. Keeping qualities of 
apples appear, therefore, to be related to a readily 
available supply of carbohydrate represented by inverting 
sucrose. 

Kidd and West( 28 > 27 ^ found in addition that total 
nitrogen content, which does not change significantly in 
storage, is directly correlated with total loss of dry 
weight and that both nitrogen content and acid loss are

related to keeping quality. A suitable balance between 
demand for respiratory substrate, represented by nitrogen 
content, and supply of readily available carbohydrate, 
represented by inverting sucrose favours keeping of apples. 

Archbold(l) found that the time lapse in storage 
before the third stage (breakdown stage) is reached is 
influenced by the date of picking. It should be possible 
to arrive at an optimum stage at which to pick different 
apple varieties for storage; this stage would be dependent 
on chemical composition and be determined by chemical 
analysis. 

Citrus fruits, having once attained maximum quality, 
begin to decline either when left on the tree, or when 
placed in storage^ 9 ). Sugar and acid contents decrease 
proportionately, the result being a low-flavoured, insipid 
fruit. Such fruits contain no starch at maturity and 
sugars will, therefore, not be increased once the fruit 
is picked. For this reason, oranges, unlike apples and 
pears, are not suited to prolonged storage. 

Hartman, Reimer, and Norrist 21 ) have shown that 
fall and winter pears stored at 50° to 32°F. attain 
optimum dessert quality in a few days when subsequently 
ripened at 65° to 70°F. Fruit of each variety has a 
more or less definite span of life in cold storage during 
which it will ripen properly if removed to a suitable 
environment. However, when certain varieties of pears are 
held at low temperatures beyond their normal storage life

they lose their capacity to soften ana attain satisfactory 
dessert quality, although retaining apparently normal 
external appearance while under refrigeration. After 
removal to higher temperatures, however, the pears may 
also develop severe surface scald and core breakdown^ 30 » 
Gerhardt and Fzell^^^ found that maturity at harvest is 
an important factor in determining the storage life and 
ripening capacity of fall and winter pears. If harvested 
too early the fruit tends to develop surface scald and 
become excessively shrivelled. If harvest is delayed too 
long, mealiness and core breakdown become serious in 
storage. Pears ripen rapidly at 60° to 70°F. The length 
of the previous storage period apparently has little 
effect on the time required to reach full ripeness at 
these higher temperatures. There is a difference of only 
2 days in the ripening time at 65°F. after having been 
stored previously at 32° for 74 to 200 days. Normal ripen¬ 
ing of the pear( 28 > 15 ) consists of softening or breaking 
down of the cell wall material of the fruit by enzyme 
activity at the higher temperature, causing hydrolysis of 
protopectin. Prolonged low temperature storage may result 
in injury ana inactivation of this enzyme ana thus render 
the fruit unable to ripen satisfactorily when brought out 
of storage. 

Kimbrough^) studied the effects of curing and 
storage on sweetpotatoes. Freshly harvested roots contain

considerable starch, dextrin and sugars. During curing 
and in storage the starch breaks down to dextrin and 
dextrose. Some varieties have a comparatively high starch 
content and are drier and firmer when cooked than are less 
starchy ones. The high starch varieties are grown for the 
storage and winter market, whereas varieties containing 
mostly dextrin and sugars are utilized on the fall market. 

Sugar and Acid Contents as expressions of Quality and as 

Foundations for Quality and Maturity Standards 

Most fruits have acidic properties and unless balanced 
by an almost proportional amount of sugars are too sour 
or astringent to eat out of hand. Also, if these fruits 
are deprived of their natural acids they are insipid and 
undesirable as food. Many fruits when ripe have a sugar 
to acid balance or ratio which with other flavours, give 
them a very pleasant taste which finds favour with most 
people. 

Chatfield and McLaughlin^ 2 ) have set up a very 
concise table of the composition of fresh fruits compiled 
from their own research work together with research records 
from many experimental stations. Their chief aim was to 
establish the value of various fruits as sources of food 
and not to distinguish qualitatively between varieties by 
way of quality indices based on chemical composition.

Fruits are, on the whole, poor sources of protein but 
good sources of sugars which supply energy in the most 
readily available form. 

Many varieties of apples, plums, cherries, grapes, 
and nearly all oranges, muskmelons, and watermelons are 
eaten raw and a sugar and acid content which will present 
a desirable raw product is necessary. 

With oranges a maturity standard based on the ratio 
of total soluble solids to total acid content has now been 
in use for many years in the United States. Although, 
according to Harding, Winston and Fisher^ 9 ), such a ratio 
as it is used at present has many faults, it has done much 
to stabilize the product placed for sale, and in time will 
no doubt be modified so as to present a reliable and accurate 
maturity standard. 

This standard for oranges illustrates the uses and 
difficulties encountered in the application of such an 
index of maturity. In making the official determination of 
ratio of total soluble solids to total acid the juice is 
extracted from 15 oranges and the test is made on this 
sample of mixed juice. The 15 oranges are taken at random 
from the shipment to be tested. Total soluble solids are 
determined with an Abbe (Bausch & Lomb) refractometer which 
makes the measurement from the change in refractive index 
of the juice resulting from the solids in solution,^. Sugars, 
acids, and dissolved mineral substances are included in 
this reading, but as sugars are present in proportions far

above the others it is usually a good measure of sugar 
content. Total acidity is determined by titration of the 
orange juice with standard sodium hydroxide, using phenol- 
phthalein as an indicator, the results being calculated as 
anhydrous citric acid. A ratio of 8:1 of total soluble 
solids to total acid content of the juice must be present 
before the oranges can go on the market as fresh fruit. 

This gives an average ratio for the lot or for the 15 
fruits taken. The fruit, however, is eaten singly by the 
consumer, and, particularly at the beginning of the season, 
one or more fruits out of the lb are often below the 
required ratio in total soluble solids and are sour to the 
taste. A solids-acid ratio of between 8.35 and 18.95:1 
is required at the beginning of the season to insure that 
all the individual oranges of different varieties come up 
to the legal ratio. In order to obtain none but legally 
mature fruits it was found necessary to pick from 16-58 
days later, than when using a composite sample, depending 
on the variety and conditions. 

Another difficulty is that a high ratio does not 
necessarily mean superior quality^ 19 in fact, fruit with 
a low ratio may be superior. A very high ratio may be 
associated with very low acid and a consequent insipid, 
low flavoured juice which is undesirable '. On the 
other hand, a low ratio may be the result of high acidity 
and low or medium solids. These latter conditions are

more desirable from a standpoint of quality than the first, 
yet the ratio would indicate the opposite. It is, there¬ 
fore, quite possible for low quality oranges to pass the 
ratio requirement and be placed on the markets for 
consumption. 

The desired results could be obtained^ 19 ^ by the 
adoption of an adequate standard based on a minimum total 
soluble solids content and a maximum as well as minimum 
total acid content. Minimum total soluble solids would 
have to be set at around 10% and total acid at around 1%. 

A standard based on these levels would permit shipment of 
"pleasantly tart" fruit which is rated highly by consumers, 
and at the same time prevent shipment of excessively tart 
or acid fruit. The minimum acid requirement would prevent 
inclusion of insipid or very low acid fruit. These 
determinations should be applied to each orange in the 
sample as oranges are consumed separately. Recommendations 
such as these would likely have to be modified in order to 
put them to practical use in commerce. A certain amount 
of tolerance must be allowed due to variation among fruits. 

Britton, Fisher ana Palmer^ give a starch-iodine 
maturity test for apples. As apples ripen the starch is 
depleted by hydrolysis to sugars, progressing from the 
core region to the skin. With storage varieties of apples 
when the core region contains no more starch the fruit is 
in the correct stage for picking.

are halved, by cutting at right angles to the axis, and the 
cut surfaces treated with iodine solution, which consists 
of potassium iodide and iodine dissolved in water. Areas 
containing starch immediately become a blue color owing to 
the starch-iodine reaction; areas devoid of starch remain 
unchanged. Starch conversion as related to stage of maturity 
varies with types and varieties of apples, and it is there¬ 
fore necessary to establish standards for each variety,

Brierley' ' points out that a total sugar content 
of 8 percent is necessary to produce vinegar of legal 
strength, and that in general. Minnesota apples do not have 
a high enough sugar content to justify their indiscriminate 
use for vinegar manufacture. 

Another maturity or quality standard based on chemical 
composition of the juice is that used with cantaloupes. 

A Canadian law^ 9 ^ stipulates that both Grades I and II 
must contain in the juice of the edible portion not less 
than 10% soluble solids. The Brix hydrometer is used for 
making these determinations. The spindle of this hydrometer 
is graduated to read directly in percentage the soluble 
solids present in the juice (the specific gravity of the 
juice increases with the soluble solids). This is a very 
rapid and convenient method for making the determination 
and is accurate enough for this work. To be of use to 
the picker, such a maturity standard must be correlated 
with external features of the fruit which can be detected

in the field^ 4 ^. Slipping of the fruit from its peduncle 
or stem has long been used as a measure of maturity. The 
full-slip condition (when separation is smooth and complete) 
being taken as the complete mature stage. Jones and Rosa^ 2 ^ 
however, found that juice quality and sweetness was not 

significantly correlated with the slipping condition and

therefore/f not a sati s fac t ory indication , ihey'fQund that 

quite often fruit in the half-slip condition was sweeter 

than that in the full-slip. Taste and quality was found 

to be closely correlated with total soluble solids content. 

Melons much above the 10% level will not ship well, but 

variations occur among varieties. Composition seems to 

be the only criterion for determining what melons are fit 

to ship. Experience and experimenting in the field in 

picking, checked against a few determinations of total 

soluble solids, enables pickers to select melons that will 

ship well and come up to the quality requirement of 10% 

soluble solids established by law. 

t^n\ . lvalue 

Work conducted by Shoemaker '° / ' indicates the uooo 
of sugar and acid investigations with grapes in quality 
determinations for wine making, for unfermented grape 
juices, and for eating out of hand. In general, the per¬ 
centage of alcohol obtained in wine making is slightly 
less than half the sugar content of the grapes used. 

Thus, the higher the sugar content of the grapes the 
higher will be the alcohol content of the wine without

the addition of other sugars. Gustafson reports that 
parthenooarpic fruits are higher in sugar content than are 
seeded ones. 

( 2 ) 

Barnes' ; reports that the acidity of grapes of the 
1936 crop at the University of Minnesota was noticeably 
lower than that of the same varieties in 1938. The summer 
of 1936 had higher temperatures, more sunshine, and less 
rain than did that of 1938. This is in agreement with 
work reported by Coldwellt 9 ) who found an inverse relation 
ship between acidity and amount of sunshine. For this 
reason it would seem advisable to grow standard varieties 
along with new originations so that comparisons can be 
made with fruits grown under the same conditions in the 
same season. 

As a rule, grape varieties with small berries 
are higher in sugar content than are those with larger 
berries. Usually, also, the small-berried varieties 
produce a superior quality of wine. Such varieties are 
slow picking and give a low yield per acre, and with a 
few exceptions are not suitable as table grapes. For ^ 
certain kinds of wines, comparatively high acidity as 
well as high sugar is desirable, but for eating out of 
hand desirable flavour may depend more on ratios than on 
high amounts. 

The total soluble solids and acid contents of a 
number of varieties are set up in Table 3, and provide

Brighton, Caco, and Delaware represent high quality 
table grapes and are high in total soluble solids and low 
in acid. Some prefer Herbert to any of the above three 
varieties because of its higher acid content which provides 
a "briskness” not found in subacid varieties. Delaware 
is also an important wine variety, Eor wine making it nay 
be desirable to add more acid with varieties of the group* 

Iona, Moore f s Early, and Ontario, represent a high 
sugar medium acid group in which wine varieties predominate 
over table grapes. The variety Wehner represents a low 
sugar, high acid grape. With added sugar grapes of this 
group may be used for wine making. G-eyer is a variety 
low both in sugar and in acid. Varieties like this possess 
little merit for any of the usual purposes for which grapes 
are used. 

Such analyses not only provide a measure of quality 
but also an explanation for preferences and dislikes 
concerning different varieties of grapes for eating out 
of hand, for prepared unfermented grape juice, and for 
wine. A knowledge of such a basis for quality should 
prove of great value in a breeding program in eliminating 
undesirable types at an early stage of the undertaking.

MATERIALS AND METHODS 


Materials 

The fruits and vegetables for this survey were 
obtained from several sources for two reasons: 

1. This method of sampling made possible a 
comparison of the effects of environment on the raw product 
and the reaction of particular varieties and types to 
climatic conditions. 

2. Only a limited amount of material was available 
locally. 

The greatest proportion of the material was obtained 
from three stations: Dominion Experimental Station, 
Lethbridge, Alberta; Provincial Horticultural Station, 
Brooks, Alberta; and the University of Alberta, Edmonton. 
Rhubarb was obtained from stations representing the major 
part of agricultural Canada, viz., Macdonald College, 
Quebec; Vineland and Ottawa, Ontario; Morden, Manitoba; 
Saskatoon, Saskatchewan; Lethbridge, Brooks, Edmonton, 
and Beaverlodge, Alberta. The materials were grown, 
collected, and analysed during the summer of 1941. All 
materials used were in good healthy condition, and an 
attempt was made to confine the period of collecting and 
sampling to that of the correct stage for use or the ripe 
condition. 

The results are not to be considered conclusive as 
only products from one summer’s growth were used. They

should, however, prove useful as a basis for comparing 
varieties and effects of environment. 

All products not grown at the University of Alberta 
were packed at the growing point and shipped immediately 
to the University where they were analysed in the plant 
biochemistry laboratory of the Field Crops Department. 

Preparation of Material 

Only edible portions of the fruits and vegetables 
were used as quality standards must conform to taste and 
desirability of these parts. Analyses were made on the 
extracted juice in all cases. The apples and crabapples 
were all cut into pieces, placed in a closely woven filter 
cloth and the juice expressed with a heavy steel hydraulic 
press. These juices all came out clear from the press 
and it was not necessary to use a centrifuge to separate 
out solid material. Other fruits, such as plums and 
raspberries, were placed in the filter cloth whole and 
crushed by the pressure of the machine. 

Some of the vegetable juices, such as those of 
sweet corn and peas were very cloudy and it was necessary 
to centrifuge before satisfactory tests could be carried 
out. It was much more difficult to obtain juices from 
the vegetables than from the fruits. Both peas and carrots 
had to be finely chopped in a meat chopper in order to 
obtain a satisfactory amount of juice with the hydraulic

press. Though the pea and corn juice were very cloudy, 
centrifuging for 10 minutes cleared them greatly and made 
readings of the apparatus possible. 

Apparatus and Methods 

Hydrogen-ion concentration (pH), titratable acidity, 
and total soluble solids (considered as an approximation 
of total sugars) were determined on all samples of fruits; 
acid determinations were not made on a number of the 
vegetables, but "total soluble solids" were likewise 
measured in each case. 

Hydrogen-ion concentration or pH was determined 
with a Coleman (Glass Electrode) pH Electrometer. Titrat¬ 
able or total acidity was determined using standard 
sodium hydroxide and phenolphthalein indicator. Total 
soluble solids were determined with an Abb& refractometer, 
which depends on the refraction of light through a film 
of the solution for its reading. With most fruits such a 
refractometer reading is a good approximation of the total 
sugar content^ 14 This is explained by the fact that 
organic acids and soluble salts present are in such small 
amounts relatively that they effect the refraction only 
to a small degree; also, as these acids and salts are 
present in almost equal amounts in all the varieties of 
a particular fruit or vegetable, they effect the reading 
by approximately the same amount for all varieties, and

thus the readings, although high for the total sugar 
content, are quite comparable with that of the next 
variety. 

The methods used for the three determinations 
(titratable acidity, pH, and total soluble solids) are 
simple and quickly applied to any clear plant juice. To 
be of practical use in determining quality and maturity 
standards it is necessary that they be so as many deter¬ 
minations must be made and neither time nor economy 
would permit detailed time-consuming analyses. 

DATA AND RESULTS 


Grabapples 

Table 4 gives the pH, titratable acidity as per¬ 
centage malic, and total soluble solids of the juice of 
eight varieties of crabapples grown at the Provincial 
Horticultural Station at Brooks, and at the University of 
Alberta, Edmonton. Lethbridge could not be included as 
not enough data were available from there on these 
varieties. Fruits of Florence were not available at the 
university and Amur was included instead; these two 
varieties quite closely represent the average in composi¬

The average total soluble solids content of the 
fruits at Brooks is significantly higher than that of the 
fruits at Edmonton (Table 4), Differences in average pH 
and titratable acidity are not of a significant level. 
Environment therefore is assumed to have a pronounced effect 
on the sugar (total soluble solids) content of crabapples. 
There may be a direct relationship between the amount of 
sunlight in the growing season and soluble solids. Thi§ 
is in agreement with the behaviour of tomatoes under similar

*This column supplies a ratio of total soluble solids 
to titratable acidity, e.g., for Olga the ratio is 
10.40:1. 
























36 


Pronounced varietal differences occur (Table 5). 
Garnet and Dolgo are extremely high in acids and Dolgo is 
correspondingly high in total soluble solids; Garnet, 
however, is below the average. Then one considers that a 
more than proportional amount of the total soluble solids 
is made up of organic acids in the case of these two the 
actual sugar content of Garnet is quite low. Garnet is 
well known for its hard, tart, nature and is undesirable 
for this reason. It would seem natural to assume that a 
high acid content accompanied by a low sugar content 
indicates a low quality fruit. Dolgo is considered a 
fruit of high quality particularly for jelly making and 
therefore high acid content alone cannot be considered as 
a definite criterion for low quality but only when 
accompanied by low sugar content. 

The pH is of importance with fruits for jellying 
purposes. The work of Tarr^°^ has shown that jellying 
power is correlated with pH and not with titratable 
acidity. Myers and Bakerrelated pH values to the 
hydrolysis of pectic materials,- which would signify that 
pH may be of considerable importance in the cooking 
behaviour of apples. Certain of these varieties may have 
poor jellying properties because of unsuitably high or 
low pH. This is suggested as an explanation for the 
generally recognized low quality of the Mecca crab. .The

pH and titratable acidity were closely related to each 
other in all varieties, that is, low acid was accompanied 
by a high pH, e.g., the juice of Mecca crab had the 
highest pH and lowest total acid content. 

A good quality preserving crabapple is indicated 
by a total soluble solid content of 15-17% and an acid 
content of 1.45-1.60% malic, based on analysis of the 
extracted raw juices. A higher acid content favours the 
use of the crabapples for jelly making. Dolgo crab and 
fruits picked before maturity when the acid content is 
high are better for jelly making than fully ripe fruit 
of varieties such as Osman and Piotosh. 

The average composition of crabapples grown in 
Alberta is about equal to the average of United States 
fruits in total soluble solids^ 2 ), but is about twice 
as high in total acid content. 

Apples 

The number of samples obtained of each variety of 
apple and from each station was not large enough to 
permit a comparison of varieties or of the effect of 
environment on the composition of the fruits. For this 
reason, all of the varieties and samples were grouped and 
an average obtained which should represent fairly closely 
the average composition of the apple when grown in 


Alberta

The average total soluble solids content of apples 
is about 4% less than that of erabapples. The total acid¬ 
ity of apples is less than half that of erabapples, and 
the pH of apples is 3.50 as compared with 3.28, the average 
pH of erabapples. The greater sweetness of apples is 
therefore due to lower acidity and not to sugar content. 

The two varieties, Rosilda and Trail, produce a small 
sized apple and originated from Dr. 7/m. Saunders' 2nd cross 
seedlings, but are indicated to be more like the apple in 













38. 


composition than like the crabapple. Trail has a sugar 
content corresponding to that of the average crabapple and 
the acid content of the apple. The composition of Rosilda 
corresponds very closely to that of the average for apples. 
These two varieties are rated of high quality for eating 
out of hand. Hibernal is not excessively low in total 
soluble solids but is very high in acidity and has a very 
low pH. The acidity, therefore, no doubt accounts for the 
excessive sourness and unpalatability of this variety when 
eaten raw. For cooking purposes this type of apple is 
undesirable because of the comparatively large amount of 
sugar required for sweetening. 

Plums 

An attempt was made to correlate taste preference of 
the cooked plums with their sugar and acid contents, using 
the varieties Qjibwa, Fmerald (summer), Minnesota 89 and 
Minnesota 92. Fmerald was distinctly the sweetest to the 
taste and contained much less acid than the others but 
was no higher in total soluble solids (Table 7). For this 
reason it was concluded that sweetness is determined in 
this case largely from the lower concentration of acid. 
Cjibwa and Minnesota 89 were of more desirable flavour 
than Minnesota 92 and had a higher total soluble solids 
content together with lower acid concentration (both pH 
and titratable acidity). This indicates a definite

The acid contained in the juice of plums cannot 
be considered as a direct proportion of the total as 
much of the acid is concentrated in regions just under 
the skin and near the pit^ Such acid is not released 

by ordinary cold pressure and is therefore not measured 
by titration of the raw juice. This acid, however, seems 
to be freely released during cooking, and the astringency 
of cooked plums may be much greater than that of the same 
raw product. For comparison of plums it would therefore 
seem necessary that analysis be made to include the acid 
contained in the skins and the pit regions. From the 
research carried out on plums, however, the author believes

that juice determinations are a satisfactory guide for 
comparison of varieties within distinct types; for example, 
varieties originating from P. salicina x P. americana 
hybrids, or from P. salicina x P. Besseyi (sandcherry- 
plum hybrids). Sugar content measured with a Zeiss refracto- 
meter has been found to be a consistent and practical 
indicator of harvesting maturity for prunes^Following 
are the averages found for the composition of the common 
hardy plums grown in Alberta: total soluble solids 15.7%, 
pH 3.36, Acid 0.88% (malic). 

Raspberries 

An attempt was made to relate the composition of 
raspberries with their desirability for eating as fresh 
fruit- by giving each raw sample a rating as determined by 
the average preference of seven persons before the juice 
was extracted from the berries for analysis. 

The following table gives the average ratings made 
on the two separate pickings July 24, 1941, and July 31, 
1941, the average total soluble solids content, pH, and 
titratable acidity.

*The samples of these varieties were not large enough to 
permit the making of a taste rating from the July 24 pick¬

are distinctly lower than those for fruits grovm here,

Viking was given top rating in both pickings. It 
was definitely higher in total soluble solids than any of 
the other varieties but did not differ appreciably in pH 
or titratable acidity from most of the other varieties. 




















.. 








42 


The other varieties which were given top ratings for eat¬ 
ing quality were also distinctly above those rated less 
desirable, in total soluble solids content, with the 
exception of the variety Adams 87 which was given a low 
rating but has a fairly high total soluble solids content. 
On the basis of these findings, high total soluble solids 
content is a definite necessity for high eating quality, 
but a high total soluble solids content does not necessari¬ 
ly mean high quality. The pH and total acidity were not 
related to eating quality and, therefore, are indicated 
to be of little use as a criterion for quality determina¬ 
tions. 

High total soluble solids content and small size 
of berry were directly related; Viking, however, is a 
medium sized berry with a high total soluble solids 
content. Chief, U. of A. #1 and #2 are small-berried 
fruits. This tendency probably explains why the red 
raspberry juice of United States berries is of lower 
concentration both in sugars and acids, as large berried 
varieties predominate in the United States. 

Taylor was very high in acid, but as only a small 
amount of fruit was available no conclusions were made.

A General Note on Vegetables 

Few vegetables depend on organic acids for their 
quality. Rhubarb and tomatoes are two exceptions and 
are often considered as fruits, although more correctly 
vegetables. Also, only a limited number depend to any 
great extent on sugar content for their quality. Most 
vegetables are made up of a combination of starch, protein, 
•sugars, fats, fibre (cellulose), vitamins, and flavouring 
constituents. A desirable balance of all of these may be 
necessary to provide a high quality vegetable. The 
following is a list of vegetables which are dependent on 
sugar content to a degree which makes a measure of their 
total soluble solids content a fair indication of their 
quality: rhubarb, tomato, carrots, sweet corn, onions, 
muskmelon, peas, sweet potato, and watermelon. In other 
vegetables quality is more closely associated with 
flavours, vitamins, and fibre content. 

Rhubarb 

A large number of samples were obtained from each 
of 5 varieties of red rhubarb and analysed (Table 9).

The total soluble solids obtained for rhubarb should 
not be considered as a good estimate of the sugar content, 
as the relatively high acid content probably contributes 
as much to the refractive index of the juice as do sugars. 
Chatfield and McLaughlin^ 12 ^ give a value of .4% sugar 
based on the total raw product; this would be slightly 
higher if calculated as a percentage of the juice. The 
ratio of total soluble solids content to total acid 
content of the juice gives an indication of the sugar 
to acid balance, and affords a better indicator for 
astringency of the juice. 

Variations within the variety, Macdonald, from the 
different stations were very marked. These were so great 
that they suggest a condition where one variety may be of

high quality when grown at one station and of consider¬ 
ably lower or inferior quality when grown at another, A 
high quality variety at Vineland would not necessarily be 
so at Lethbridge, When preparing the material for analysis 
the colour and texture of the petioles was also noted. 
Macdonald and Valentine rhubarb grown at Vineland, Ontario, 
were of a very dark red skin colour, and Valentine had 
also a dark red flesh colour. Macdonald obtained from 
all other stations was far more green in colour, and 
scarcely any red was evident in the flesh. No red colour 
was present in the flesh of Macdonald obtained from 
Beaverlodge.

Carrots 

A large number of samples including several 
varieties were tested for total soluble solids and acid 
contents. The acidity of carrot juice was practically 
nil in all cases and is not considered of importance. 

Tests were made on July 31 when the carrots were 
in the bunching stage, and on August 18 and September 10 
when the roots were mature. The analyses showed a 
definite increase in the total soluble solids content as 
the roots developed, having the highest content at 
maturity (see Table 11). These tests did not indicate 
significant differences between varieties at maturity, 
but do indicate the superiority of certain varieties at 
the bunching stage, namely Table Gem and Amsterdam Forcing 
as compared with Streamliner and Oxheart.

Peas 

Quality in fresh or canning peas is associated 
with the sugar-starch ratio. High sugar and low starch 
content make for high quality. Then the mature canning 
stage is reached changes are very rapid, particularly in 
hot weather, and delay in harvesting for only a short 

l R \ 

time may markedly lower the quality 1 • 

Tests made here on a large number of garden pea 
samples indicate that total soluble solids content as 
measured with the refractometer is not reliable for 
determining sugar content in peas or in other high nitrogen 
foods such as beans and asparagus tips. Juices of such 
products require treatment to remove water soluble proteins 
and other nitrogenous compounds before refractometric 
readings are reliable indications of sugar content. 
Refractometer readings for all varieties of peas give an 
average of 9% total soluble solids which is 3 times the 
sugar content normally found in canning peas( 11 
Similar results were obtained with snap beans and asparagus. 

Muskmelons 

Sugar content increases with maturity and decreases 
if the fruit is left in the field after maturity^^. A 
minimum total soluble solids content of 10$ is required 
by Canadian law in muskmelons for market, ilarly varieties 
of melons like those grown in Alberta may be of good quality

Fruits of these varieties were all considered of 
good eating quality at the time of analysis. The variations 
shown in Table 10 indicate the necessity of establishing 
maturity standards for separate varieties or for groups of 
varieties. It is necessary to make analysis on the 
section of the fruit near its equatorial circumference. 

Scott and McGillivray^ found a difference of 3 to 4/6 
in total soluble solids content between the blossom and 
stem ends of the fruit, it being lowest at the stem end. 

Watermelon 

No attempt has been made to use the refractive 
index or specific gravity of watermelon juice as an indica¬ 
tion of maturity, but a definite measure of correct stage

at which to pick has long been required. Colour, sugar 
content, and flavour are the chief attributes of a water¬ 
melon, and these are only favourable when the fruit is 
ripe^ 3,34 L Ripe fruits tested at the university 
averaged 7.4 % total soluble solids. r7ith watermelons, 
as with muskmelons, it would be necessary to correlate 
external features of the fruit or ste;is with juice 
composition. 

Sweet Corn 

Sugar content of sweet corn greatly influences the 
quality, and is greatly affected by the maturity^. 
Refractive index is not a reliable measure of sugar content 
or maturity with sweet corn. As corn matures starch, 
dextrin, hemicellulose, proteins, and fibre increase. 

Water, sugars, and simple nitrogenous materials decrease 
with maturity. Thus, the proportion of sugars to the 
water present may increase with maturity and yet the total 
amount of sugars decrease. Kertesz^ 26 ) suggests the use 
of a simple alcohol extraction to remove all constituents 
which contribute to quality as these are soluble in alcohol. 
By determining the alcohol insoluble solids content the 
proportion of all components contributing to maturation 
can be easily estimated without taking into account the 
changing water content. Alcohol insoluble solids are a 
good indicator of maturity in sweet corn.

5IM.1ARY AND COI.CLITSIONS 


An attempt has been made to evaluate the use of 
measurements of, and relationships between, total 
soluble solids and total acid contents in establishing 
definite maturity and quality standards for fruits and 
vegetables. 

Analyses were made on the juices of a large number 
of samples of fruits and vegetables. Total soluble solids 
content was determined as with an Abbe refractometer; 
pH with a Coleman (glass electrode) pH electrometer; and 
total acidity by titration with standard sodium hydroxide 
solution and expressing it in percentage of the expressed 
juice. 

Crabapple varieties differed markedly in chemical 
composition. Analyses indicated the possibility of 
representing desirable fruit by a fairly definite total 
soluble solids to total acid balance. 

Low pH, in nearly all cases, was accompanied by a 
relatively high total acid content of fruit juice; this 
was not true with rhubarb. 

Total soluble solids content of fresh red raspberries 
was indicated to be directly related to taste preferences. 

Total soluble solids content of high protein or 
high acid vegetables, as determined with a refractometer,

was found to be a poor measure of sugar content. It Is 
believed that the high amount of soluble proteins or acids 
is responsible for much of the refraction. 

The acid content of most vegetables was very low 
and the use of this fraction of the juice in quality or 
maturity indices is of doubtful value. 

The total soluble solids content by itself is a 
useful measure of quality and maturity in carrots, musk- 
melons, and watermelons. It should be possible to apply 
a measure of this fraction of the juice in determining 
maturity of watermelons, as it is with muskmelons. 

Environmental conditions have a significant effect 
on the composition of fruits and vegetables as shown by 
the results with crabapples and rhubarb. Zonation of 
fruits may become necessary from the standpoint of quality 
as v/ell as from hardiness.
