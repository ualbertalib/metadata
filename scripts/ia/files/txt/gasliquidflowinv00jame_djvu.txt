THE PROBLEM 


The problem undertaken is an investigation of the 
significance of certain variables on the pressure drop and the 
liquid hold-up in flowing two-phase mixtures of air and water in 
vertical tubes. The objective is to present the pressure drop 
data in the form of a friction factor - Reynolds number relation¬ 
ship with the necessary other parameters similar to that for 
single-phase flow. 





SUMMARY 


Pressure drops, gas-liquid discharge ratios and gas-liquid test 
section ratios are determined for air-water mixtures flowing upward in 
vertical butyrate plastic tubes having inside diameters of 0.640 inches and 
1.049 inches, and test section lengths of 22.78 feet and 22.88 feet respec¬ 
tively. For four constant water rates varying from 4.15 Ibs./ft^ sec. to 
51.9 lbs./ft 2 sec., the air rate varies from zero to 0.97 ft 3 /sec. (at 
14.4 PSIA and 60°F.) for test section mid-point pressures of 18 PSIA and 
36 PSIA. 

At each water rate the measured pressure drop is found to pass 
through a first minimum point, in which the flowing mixture is character¬ 
ized by slug flow, a maximum point, in which the flow is a frothy mixture 
of the two phases, a second minimum, in which the air travels in a core 
through an annular film of water, and then to increase steadily in the 
mist flow region as the air-water discharge ratio is increased. 

The pressure drops at these inflection points become greater as the water 
rate increases, and at high water rates the second minimum point disappears. 
Doubling the gas phase density results in the pressure drop discharge air- 
water ratio curve lagging the corresponding curve at the lower density. 

Tubing diameter shows only slight effects on the pressure drop. 

The measured pressure drops are separated into two components, 
hydrostatic head and friction losses, by a method proposed by Radford. Super¬ 
ficial friction factors, based on the flowing gas phase and arbitrarily 


defined as

are calculated from the friction losses and are plotted against superficial 
Reynolds numbers also based on the flowing gas phase occupying the entire 
cross-section of the tube. These friction factors are found to be as much 
as 1000 times greater than friction factors for single-phase flow. With 
increasing Reynolds numbers the friction factors decrease sharply (at a 
negative slope of 2.1) over the range studied. A separate curve is found 
for each water rate, gas phase density and tube diameter. The effects 
of these variables on the friction factor appear to be inter-related and 
are complex. 

Further studies are necessary before a complete correlation of 
the variables is possible.

CHAPTER I 


INTRODUCTION 


The problem of predicting the pressure drop attending the 
vertical upward flow of gas-liquid mixtures in tubes (e.g. gas or air 
lifting of oil or water) has never been solved in a satisfactory manner. 
The lack of usable data to apply to such a problem is probably due to the 
complexity of this type of flow. Whereas in single-phase flow the calcu¬ 
lation of pressure drops in tubes can be made easily from a knowledge of 
the physical properties and the rate of flow of the fluid, and the length, 
diameter and roughness of the tube, in two-phase flow the calculation is 
more difficult since the friction factor is not a unique function of 
Reynolds number and tube roughness. Thus the influence of the physical 
properties of both the gas phase and the liquid phase, the rates of flow 
and the proportions of each phase entering or leaving the tube, the 
proportions of each phase in the tube, and the length, diameter and 
roughness of the tube may be important. 

The present study is undertaken to obtain data on the effects of 
water rate, gas phase density, tube diameter and flow pattern on the pres¬ 
sure drop and the liquid hold-up of air-water mixtures flowing in vertical 
tubes, with a view to correlating the results in a manner analogous to 
that for single-phase fluids.

CHAPTER II 


REVIEW OF LITERATURE 

Prior to 1928 little or no research had been carried out on the 
simultaneous flow of liquids and gases in vertical pipes. The gas lift, 
the most common example of two-phase flow, had been successfully applied 
to the lifting of oil in wells and its use probably reached a peak in the 
oil fields of Oklahoma in the period 1927-1928. Yet an understanding of 
the mechanisms governing this type of flow had not been obtained. 

The term "gas-lift” has been restricted to the process of flowing 
a well by means of, or with the aid of, artificially injected gas. However, 
the flow of gas-oil mixtures in vertical pipes is essentially the same 
irrespective of whether the flow is natural, using formation gas, or induced, 
using air or gas lift. Accordingly a solution to either of the two types 
of flow will be a solution to both. 

Over the past twenty-five years several reports of experimental 
work on two-phase vertical flow have been published. Many articles on the 
air gas lift and its use in the oil field are also available. Versluys has 
published several papers discussing vertical flow of gas-liquid mixtures. 

In one of his earliest papers (20) published in the United States, the theory 
of flowing oil wells is developed in mathematical form. A theoretical dis¬ 
cussion of the energy balance in a gas lift is given. Two cases are treated: 
(l) where the gas is insoluble in the liquid, and (2) where the gas is 
soluble in the liquid. For each of these cases the author derives an equation 
summing up the work performed on, and by, the gas-oil mixture in rising

through a vertical pipe. The constants in the mathematical formulae set 
forth in this paper would have to he ascertained from experiments. 

In another paper (21) Versluys discusses irregular flow in detail. 
The causes and effects of intermittent flow are explained, and a method of 
selecting the proper length and diameter of tubing under these flow condi¬ 
tions is given. Graphs are presented to show the flow conditions at 
various gas-oil ratios and tubing sizes, and to estimate the quantity of 
gas that must be injected into an intermittent well in order to establish 
regular flow. 

In two papers published in England Versluys discusses the principles 
of gas lift and the conditions under which gas and liquid mixtures rise. In 
the first paper (22) he explains the mechanism of lifting a liquid by means 
of a compressed gas. In the companion paper (23) he discusses the principles 
limiting the different conditions under which the flow of gas and liquid 
through a vertical pipe can take place. The author states that two stable 
conditions are possible in the mixture of liquid and gas. These are the foam 
condition and the mist condition, and are dependent upon the volumetric ratio 
of gas to liquid present in the pipe. Between the two an unstable condition 
exists and in actual flow the two arise alternately but immediately each 
converts itself into the other. The result is that gas and liquid tend to 
segregate and form slugs or to fill the tube with slugs of mist and foam. 

This causes fluctuations which may pass into real heading and surging. 

Uren and his co-workers were among the first to conduct experiments 
on the flow of gas-oil mixtures in vertical pipes (18). They measured pres¬ 
sure losses for air-oil mixtures at many different flow velocities in a

vertical 2-inch pipe 41 feet high. In approaching the problem of evaluating 
and formulating the variables influencing pressure loss, they assumed that 
the Fanning and the Poiseuille equations would comprise all of the variables 
involved. These equations are used in computing the value of the friction 
factor and the absolute viscosity for various air-oil mixtures. 

The authors present graphs showing the variation of specific 
gravity, viscosity and pressure drop with air-oil ratios up to 6000 cubic 
feet of air per barrel of oil, log log plots of velocity versus pressure 
drop and friction factor, and friction factor versus Reynolds number. The 
assumption that the Poiseuille equation holds true over the entire range of 
viscous and turbulent flow and can be used in solving for the viscosity of 
the air-oil mixture is an erroneous one, since the equation is applicable to 
laminar unidirectional flow only. In presenting these results, the authors 
do not explain how the velocity term in the Reynolds number has been calcu¬ 
lated and whether it is the velocity of the gas or of the liquid, or the slip 
velocity (i.e. the difference in the velocity between the air and the liquid). 
It would appear that this slip velocity and the resulting lower air-oil ratio 
in the tube was not perceived by them. 

This slippage is one of the most important factors affecting the 
efficiency of the flow of oil and gas mixtures. Recognizing this fact, Moore 
and Wilde developed a method of measuring slippage in short experimental gas 
lifts. As shown in a paper presented by them (11), slippage can be easily 
calculated in a vertical pipe carrying a mixture of gas and oil if the frac¬ 
tions of the pipe occupied by the liquid and gas respectively are known. They 
measured the fraction of the pipe occupied by the liquid under a wide variety

of conditions and determined the relationship between this fraction and 
other quantities which are easily measured in ordinary work* 

The authors correlate their data by means of an equation relating 
the ratio of fraction of pipe occupied by liquid to that occupied by gas 
(designated by the symbol X) to the pipe diameter, specific gravity of the 
liquid, relative volume velocity and surface tension of the liquid. The 
equation is not dimensionless. The solution of the equation must be made by 
successive approximations since the relative volume velocity is the function 
of this ratio X, as well as the rate of liquid flow, the rate of gas flow 
through the pipe and the average pressure in the pipe. A value of X is 
assumed and used to obtain the relative volume velocity. This value of the 
velocity is used in the solution of the equation for X. The calculation is 
repeated until the calculated value of X checks the assumed value. Having 
estimated X correctly, the corresponding value for the fraction of pipe 
occupied by liquid (l) is easily found. The product of this fraction Y, 
the liquid density and the height of the gas-lift is taken to be, the hydro¬ 
static head of the liquid. 

Friction loss is determined by subtracting the hydrostatic head 
and the velocity head from the total pressure drop in the flow pipe. Veloc¬ 
ity head in most cases is negligible. The friction loss is subject to a 
fairly large error, since it is the difference of two large quantities, 
either of which may be subject to some inaccuracy in measurement. The 
authors maintain, however, that it is accurate enough to demonstrate that 
the Fanning equation can not be applied to the calculation of friction losses 
in the flow of heterogeneous fluids. The best correlation gives the friction

loss as a function of the linear velocity of the liquid, specific gravity 
and viscosity of the liquid, and the pipe diameter. Ho-wever, attempts to 
calculate the pressure drops in flowing or gas-lifted oil wells usually give 
results which are too high. At the time that this paper was presented the 
authors were unable to explain the discrepancy between the experimental re¬ 
sults and oil well data. 

In a subsequent paper presented two years later (12), Moore and 
Schilthius bring forth a new hypothesis which presupposes certain conditions 
affecting the flow of oil and gas in wells. When the equations proposed by 
Moore and Wilde are corrected to allow for these conditions, an agreement 
between the observed and calculated performance of an actual well is obtained, 
which in most cases is quite satisfactory, although subject to certain 
limitations. 

The authors are of the opinion that each variable in the equation 
for the pressure drop derived in the previous paper of Moore and Wilde 
influences the pressure drop in the proper manner, even though the results 
are in error. In all cases, it is observed that the calculated pressure 
drop is greater than the value observed, (i.e. the actual performance is 
more efficient than the equation would indicate). An analysis of actual 
well performance shows wells having flowing efficiencies of practically 
one hundred per cent, implying that the losses due to friction and slippage 
are negligible. Further investigation reveals that all such wells are pro¬ 
ducing with very little gas in excess of that dissolved in the oil at the 
pressure existing at the bottom of the well, and that in practically every 
case of a well flowing under these conditions, the efficiency is nearly

one hundred per cent. The authors give the following explanation for this 
apparently abnormal behavior: 

The gas coming out of solution from the oil as the pressure de¬ 
creases, becomes dispersed throughout the oil in very fine bubbles forming 
a stable foam in which gas bubbles can not move except at very low velocities 
and consequently slippage is negligible. Under such conditions and at veloci¬ 
ties sufficiently low to permit the neglect of friction, the pressure drop 
may be calculated with very little error by assuming that there are no 
friction or slip losses. 

For wells producing a quantity of gas in excess of that dissolved 
in the oil at the pressure existing at the bottom of the well, the authors 
formulate the following hypothesis: 

It is assumed that the gas in solution evolves as the pressure 
decreases but that this gas forms a stable foam, and that little of the 
dissolved gas escapes from the foam phase. Thus the gas which comes out of 
solution is prevented from slipping past the oil. The free gas, however, 
does slip past the oil, or rather, the foam, and the amount of slippage de¬ 
pends upon the properties of the foam rather than the properties of the 
liquid. The lift may be considered as one in which a foam, comprising the 
liquid and the gas which has come out of solution, is lifted by the gas which 
is undissolved at the point of entrance. 

The authors assume that the equations previously developed should 
hold, provided the physical properties and velocities used are considered 
to be those of the foam instead of the pure liquid, A corrected formula is 
given for calculating the free gas volume. 



11 . 


To check the hypothesis, the pressure drop in a number of wells 
is calculated and compared to the actual pressure drop observed. A table 
is presented showing the results of such calculations for a number of wells 
in several different fields. The calculated pressure drops agree reasonably 
well with the observed values, usually to within five per cent. 

It is stated that the equations developed are subject to certain 
limitations, however. At low pressures or at low rates of flow the equations 
fail because of the instability of the foam. No account is taken of the 
properties of the gas. The friction equation i3 only a rough approximation. 

The authors have prepared a series of curves showing pressure drop 
under various sets of conditions. These curves can be used in solving problems 
in tubing design. Two illustrations showing the use of these curves are 
presented. 

Nowels (13) has developed a method for computing pressure drop in 
the flow string of an oil well somewhat similar to that of Uren. He is of 
the opinion that an adaptation of the Fanning equation would include all of 
the variables involved and that the friction factor in this equation would 
be some function of the Reynolds number just as in the case of the flow of 
single-phase fluids in pipes. 

Using gas-lift data on 28 wells flowing through tubings varying 
from 2 l/4 to 6 l/4 inches in diameter, he determines Reynolds numbers and 
the friction factor in the Fanning equation and compares the two graphically. 

In determining the Reynolds number, the calculation of the average value of 
the weight of one cubic foot of the flowing mixture and the velocity of this 
mixture is based on the average pressure in the flow string.

Novels later has found that Reynolds numbers derived in this manner are 
almost the same as those derived from using surface velocities and weights 
of one cubic foot of mixture at the well head pressures. 

The determination of viscosity is more complicated. Nowels takes 
the plot of viscosity versus air-oil ratio of Uren (18) and transfers it 
to logarithmic paper. The resulting plot is found to be a straight line; 
(units of viscosity are changed to English units and the air-oil ratio is 
changed to percentage oil). Since this relation between viscosity and per¬ 
centage oil in the mixture is a straight line with viscosity decreasing as 
the percentage oil becomes smaller, the curve extended downward will 
ultimately reach an imaginary point which will represent zero per cent oil 
and one hundred per cent air. He then finds an average viscosity for 
natural gas of the composition he is using, and plots this viscosity on the 
same value of the abscissa as the intersection of the Uren line with the 
viscosity of air. This point is then used as a point of origin for all the 
straight lines connecting it and values of the viscosities of crude oils of 
various gravities, (i.e. one hundred per cent oil).. A portion of this plot 
is enlarged and the abscissa logarithmic scale changed to read gas-oil ratios 
in cu. ft./barrel. Correction charts for temperature variations and per cent 
water in the crude are also made. 

Nowels is then able to determine Reynolds numbers for any mixture 
of gas and oil flowing in a production tube. From the observed pressure 
drops in the gas-lifted wells, the friction factor in the Fanning equation 
is calculated. A plot of friction factor versus Reynolds number is made on 
logarithmic paper. The best-fit “curve” for each pipe size is found to be

13 . 


at a 45® angle similar to the plot of Uren. 

Nowels observes that the results show certain discrepancies. For 
a given Reynolds number, the friction factor increases in value as the pipe 
size increases, whereas the reverse of this relationship exists in horizontal 
pipes where the flow is turbulent. The 45® alignment of the straight-line 
curves representing values of friction factor indicates that vertical flow, 
in the pipe sizes dealt with, is of a viscous or streamline nature, in which 
case the Poiseuille formula would express the true relationship. This 
formula does not hold true in vertical flow, however, as impossible values 
for pressure drop are obtained. As Nowels says, "It is hardly conceivable 
that the flow of oil and gas in a flowing well would follow the viscous or 
streamline condition of flow due to the expansion of the gas and its rapid 
increase in velocity; yet the 45® angle slope to the curves on logarithmic 
paper indicates this viscous flow. At the entrance of the casing or tubing, 
viscous flow may exist but probably soon changes over into turbulent flow." 

Although the friction factor increases in value as the diameter of 
pipe increases, the net result of a survey of the 28 wells shows that the 
pressure drop per unit length of pipe is greatest for pipes of small diameter. 
In other words, the friction is greater in small pipes than large ones even 
though the equations used for determining friction factor show it to be 
greater in value with pipes of large diameter. Nowels concludes that addi¬ 
tional research and study of gas-lift data are necessary in order to correct 
the correlations that he has obtained. 

Gosline (5) has also performed experimental work on a small gas¬ 
lift using air and three different liquids. He is most interested in annular

or wall film flow such as occurs in wells having small tubing, high gas-oil 
ratios and/or low submergences (bottom hole pressures). For this type of 
flow, he investigates the effect of air velocity on the drag coefficient at 
the air-liquid interface by measuring the air '‘core” velocity, the liquid 
annulus velocity and the liquid annulus thickness. The air velocities are 
sufficiently high to be in turbulent flow and the liquid velocities of such 
magnitude as to be in viscous flow. 

Using these date the drag coefficient is calculated (using an 
equation developed in the paper) and plotted versus the air "core*' velocity. 

Gosline finds that the coefficient of drag diminishes rapidly with the abso¬ 
lute velocity of the gas and that at any air velocity the drag is greater 
with liquids of greater viscosity. 

Although not presenting any solution to two-phase flow, this paper 
provides a clearer understanding of the variables affecting the tractive 
forces at the air-liquid interface in wall film flow. 

Cromer and Huntington (3) carried out a visual study of flowing 
air-water mixtures in a 98-foot length of vertical pipe set up in a derrick. 
Glass observation sections 2 feet long were placed at 14-foot intervals in 
the column and the flowing mixture photographed at these sections. 

The four points which Shaw (15) has shown to be significant in the 
operation of an air-lift pump, (i.e, 1) the point of no flow due to deficiency 

of air; 2) the point of maximum efficiency; 3) the point of maximum yield, 
and 4) the point of no flow due to an excess of air,) are discussed by the 
authors with the aid of photographs taken at four of the observation sec¬ 
tions along the pipe. Their paper is helpful in obtaining a better under-

standing of flow conditions of two-phase mixtures under varying air rates. 

During the past six years several papers have been published 
covering research work on two-phase flow conducted at the University of 
California under the direction of R. C. Martinelli (7, 8, 9). Lockhart and 
Martinelli (7) have developed a generalized correlation for two-phase hori¬ 
zontal flow based on this previous work. 

It has been demonstrated (8) that four types of flow mechanisms 
can exist during the simultaneous flow of a liquid and a gas or vapor. These 
flow mechanisms are: 

(1) Flow of both the liquid and the gas may be turbulent. 

(2) Flow of the liquid may be viscous and flow of gas may be turbulent. 

(3) Flow of the liquid may be turbulent and flow of the gas viscous. 

(4) Flow of both the liquid and the gas may be viscous. 

Lockhart and Martinelli show that the pressure drop resulting from these 
various flow mechanisms can be correlated by means of two parameters (j) 

and X . (J) is equal to the square root of the ratio of the pressure drop 

per unit length during two-phase flow to the pressure drop per unit length 
for either the gas or liquid flowing alone. X is equal to the square root 
of the ratio of the pressure drop per unit length If the liquid flowed alone 
to the pressure drop per unit length if the gas flowed alone. The authors 
have plotted $ versus X > for 0 based on both the gas pressure drop 
and the liquid pressure drop and for each of the four possible flow mechan¬ 
isms (i.e. eight curves in all). On the same graph, curves of the fraction 
of tube filled with liquid and the fraction filled with gas are plotted 
against the parameter X

It would appear that more data are needed to establish definitely 
the validity of these correlations. The effect of varying the liquid rate 
and the resulting change in flow pattern with varying liquid rate were not 
investigated. 

However, van Wingen (19) compares pressure drops recorded in 
field lines between the well heads and the separators, with those computed 
by the method of Lockhart and Martinelli. He finds that at low rates of 
gas flow, the observed pressure drops are higher than those computed but 
that the difference is less than 1 p.s.i./lOOO ft., and hence insignificant. 
At higher rates of gas flow, the divergence is higher but is in the direc¬ 
tion of conservatism. Thus it would appear that for estimating the pressure 
drop for two-phase flow in horizontal pipes, this method could be of use. 

McElwee (10) investigated viscous annular flow of air-kerosene 
mixtures in a vertical 5 m.m. pyrex tube in order to provide a further check 
on the analysis of two-phase flow using the flow parameters 0 and X 
as developed by Martinelli and Lockhart. 

The relation between flow parameters, presented in this previous 
work, is generally substantiated by McElwee. However, comparison of the 
results of this investigation and those obtained by Lockhart for the same 
flow conditions in capillary tubes shows a lack of correlation. This discrep¬ 
ancy renders questionable the neglect of surface and body forces in small 
tubes, in this and previous investigations. Since Lockhart's experiments 
were performed in capillary tubes, the possibility is indicated that the 
justification for neglecting capillary forces may depend upon tube size. 
McElwee presents an excellent photographic study of the several flow patterns

investigated with pictures taken at high speed (l/30,000th of a second). 

Stuart F. Shaw is probably the leading authority in America, if 
not in the whole world, on the gas lifting of oil wells. Over the past 25 
years he has published many papers discussing the gas lift, its use in 
various fields under many different conditions and the design of such in¬ 
stallations (15, 16, 17). 

In conducting his experimental work he has been more interested 
in the practical applications than in the fundamental understanding of two- 
phase flow patterns. In a booklet published in 1949 by The Agricultural and 
Mechanical College of Texas (17), a complete summary of Dr. Shaw’s extensive 
investigations during the past ten years is given. Primarily, he has deter¬ 
mined the productive capacities (i.e. the amount of liquid produced by a 
gas lift at any gas rate) of four diameters of pipe of various lengths when 
lifting oil and water by means of air lift. 

Shaw previously showed (15) that there are four standard rates of 
flow which are significant in gas lift operations. As mentioned earlier, 
these are: 1) rate of no flow due to deficiency of gas; 2) rate of maximum 
efficiency; 3) rate of maximum yield, and 4) rate of no flow due to an 
excess of gas. Rates 1 and 4 have no practical application in lifting liquids. 
Shaw is principally concerned with rates 2 and 3. At these two rates he has 
varied the submergence (i.e. the static pressure at the fluid inlet), and 
has measured the gas and liquid rates. For each run he computes the percent¬ 
age lifting efficiency (i.e. the foot-pounds of work performed in lifting a 
barrel of the liquid from the operating fluid level to the point of discharge 
divided by the number of foot-pounds given out by the gas employed in carry¬ 
ing on the lifting operation).

18 . 


The results of this work are discussed by Shaw under three head¬ 
ings: 

(1) Influence of submergence (upstream static pressure) on the 
capacity of a given flow pipe. 

(2) Influence of length of pipe on the unit area capacity of the pipe. 

(3) Influence of diameter of flow pipe on its unit area capacity. 

(1) Increasing submergence increases the capacity of a pipe producing 
on air lift; also, as the percentage of submergence is increased, the lift¬ 
ing efficiency is increased up to some maximum point, but these tests do not 
definitely determine whether or not the lifting efficiency reaches some 
maximum point and then begins gradually to decline. 

(2) At maximum capacity rate, unit area capacity at any given submerg¬ 
ence increases with increased pipe length except for oil flowing in the 
small diameter tubes (1 inch and 1 l/2 inches). Similar results are obtained 
when producing at maximum efficiency rate, Shaw noted, however, that the 
graphs presented cannot be extrapolated to lengths of several thousand feet 
inasmuch as rates of flow indicated for such extrapolations would be far in 
excess of any production that has been obtained in oil wells for similar 
submergence conditions. 

(3) With water, it would appear that capacities per square inch for 
all diameters of pipe tested remain fairly constant at a given submergence 
percentage. On the other hand, when lifting oil, there appears to be a 
marked tendency toward an increase in unit area capacity of the pipe as the 
diameter increases. Shaw again makes clear the fact that the data cannot be 
extrapolated to great depths.

In his conclusions to this report, Shaw formulates a very ambitions 
program for testing gas lifts. Such a plan, if carried out, would probably 
go a long way toward solving the difficulties of two-phase flow. 

Carpenter (2), Gazley (4) and Jenkins (6) present pressure drop 
data for air-water mixtures in horizontal and vertical tubes, using “super¬ 
ficial" friction factors and Reynolds numbers calculated for the gas phase 
as though it is flowing alone in the tubes. They find that at any given 
gas flow, the addition of small amounts of liquid phase may increase the 
pressure drop from 2 to 50 times. 

For horizontal tubes the friction factors increase with increased 
water rate at any Reynolds number and the flow pattern greatly influences 
the friction factor causing sharp rises in it during the transition regions 
between different flow patterns. These flow patterns are somewhat different 
from those in vertical tubes. 

The data taken in the vertical tube are for downward annular flow. 
The results show friction factors near those for single-phase flow in the 
low turbulent region. At higher gas Reynolds numbers the friction factors 
pass through a maximum. The curves are extrapolated beyond this maximum 
with a negative slope in such a manner that they become roughly parallel to 
the curve for single-phase flow, implying that the water layer imparts 
"wavy roughness" characteristics to the gas flow. It is concluded that the 
orientation of the tubes is not important at high gas velocities. 

A preliminary investigation of gas-liquid flow in vertical pipes 
was carried out by Radford (14) in 1949. The purpose of this work was to 
obtain a better fundamental understanding of the mechanism of two-phase

vertical flow, as in the case of an oil well producing a mixture of gas 
and oil. The equipment consisted of a vertical 23-foot section of clear, 

1-inch plastic tubing with the necessary fittings for measuring the pressure 
drop and the rates of flow of the air and water used in the tests. Visual 
observations of the flow pattern were also made. 

The results show that at any given water rate, as the air rate 
is increased from zero, the measured pressure drop passes through a first 
minimum point, a maximum point, a second minimum point, and then increases 
smoothly. Closely related to the change in pressure is a transition in tM 
flow pattern from "slug" flow at the lowest rates, through "froth" flow and 
"film" flow to "mist" flow at the highest rates. This indicates that the 
flow pattern depends mainly on the air rate. Radford suggests that a modified 
Reynolds number based on the air rate might be used for further interpretive 
work. 

The present project has been undertaken as a continuation of the 
work started by Radford. The equipment constructed by him is enlarged and 
improved such that the effects of tubing diameter and gas phase density can 
also be obtained. The equation developed in the earlier work is used to 
compute friction losses for pressure drops over a wide range of air rated at 
four different water rates. These losses, in turn, are used to compute friction 
factors (based on the flowing gas phase alone) by means of a Fanning-type 
equation, and are compared to Reynolds numbers (also based on the flowing gas 
phase alone), as suggested by Radford.

CHAPTER III 


EXPERIMENTAL EQUIPMENT 

The experimental equipment consists of a flow circuit through which 
air and water pass, and auxiliary equipment for measuring and controlling 
the flow variables. The details of each part are described separately. 

1. Flow Circuit . 

A schematic drawing of the flow circuit is shown in Fig. 1. It 
can be best explained under the following headings: 

a. Air supply system. 

b. Water supply system . 

c. Mixing sections. 

d. Test sections. 

e. Air-water separation sections. 

a. Air Supply System. Air supplied at 90 to 110 p.s.i. from a compressor 
is passed through a reducing valbe which maintains the downstream pressure 
at 75 p.s.i., and then to the test equipment. A 1-inch "plug disc" globe 
valve controls the volume of air. For finer control a l/4-inch by-pass line 
with a l/4-inch needle valve is provided. Air flow is measured by an air 
flow manometer, connected to pressure taps located up and downstream from the 
orifice plate. In order to eliminate the necessity of frequently changing 
the orifice plates, two orifice unions are installed in parallel lines. The 
air flow manometer is connected to both sets of pressure taps. From the 
orifice unions the air supply line proceeds to the mixing section at the foot 
of the test sections. All lines between the air supply and the mixing sec¬ 
tion are one inch unless otherwise noted.

b. Water Supply System . Water is supplied at 23 p.s.i. from a constant level 
overhead tank. When the equipment is operated at the higher test section 
pressure (36 p.s.i.) the water is by-passed through a centrifugal pump having 
a capacity of 70 gallons per minute at 110 p.s.i. A 1-inch "plug disc" globe 
control valve and a water flow manometer connected to two sets of pressure 
taps on orifice lines are used to control and measure the water flow. A 
second control valve downstream from the orifice lines can be closed in order 
to prevent a negative pressure in the manometer, due to the water supply line 
to the mixing section being below the manometer. All lines between the water 
supply and the mixing section are one inch unless otherwise noted. 

c. Mixing Section. The mixing section shown in Fig. 2 is merely a vertically 
placed 2“ x 2" x 1" galvanized iron tee. Air enters the bottom 2-inch branch, 
water the 1-inch side branch, and the resulting air-water mixture flows through 
the top 2-inch branch. A 2 M x 1" reducer and the female half of a 1-inch union 
at the top of the tee connect to the male half of a 1-inch union at the bottom 
of each test section. In the smaller test section there is a 1" x l/2 M reducer 
above this union connecting it to the plastic tube. Below the mixing section 
there is a two-inch union containing ten 2-inch diameter circular discs of 
40-mesh screen which serve to disperse the air prior to mixing. A 2” x 1" 
reducer and a 1-inch union connect this union and the mixing section to the 
air supply line. Water from the water header enters the side branch of the 
mixing section through a 1-inch union. Check valves are located in both air 
and water lines upstream from the unions connecting them to the mixing section. 

d. Test Section. There are two vertical test sections, sizes 1" and l/2 M , 
each extending 35 feet above the mixing section. The actual transparent 
plastic tubes are each 30 feet long and lie between approximately 2 l/2-foot

sections of galvanized iron pipe (l/2" for the smaller tube and 1" for the 
larger tube). Appropriately-sized lubricated plug valves are located in both 
the top and bottom sections of the galvanized pipe. The top and bottom plug 
valves of the test section being used are interconnected by a 3/4-inch angle 
aluminum rod. Immediately above the bottom valves there are l/8-inch needle 
valves for draining the test sections. By moving the rod up or down , the 
top and bottom plug valves of the section being used can be opened or closed 
simultaneously. The actual inside diameters of the plastic in the two test 
sections are 1.049-inch and 0.640-inch. Each plastic test section contains 
two 15-foot lengths of clear butyrate tubing. In joining the sections of 
plastic tubing, a close fitting plastic sleeve is slipped over the butted 
ends and then sealed to the tubes, using chloroform. 

In joining plastic tubing to a similar-sized section of galvanized 
iron pipe, a reducer is used. The small end of the reducer is screwed in 
the end of the galvanized pipe (see Fig. 7). The inside of the reducer is 
then machined so that the end of the plastic tube can be butted against the 
iron pipe inside the reducer. A split brass collar is fitted in a machined 
groove on the outer surface of the plastic tubing about l/2-inch from the 
butted end. Above this is a snug-fitting bushing. Screwing the bushing in 
the reducer forces down on the collar, thus ensuring a snug fit between the 
butted ends of the plastic tubing and iron pipe. 

The plastic test sections are fitted flush in the H V"e of 30-foot 
vertical sections of angle iron. Each angle iron section is spot welded to 
the grating of the floor levels and braced at the top and bottom to the wall. 

In the larger tube the pressure drop is measured over a 22.88-foot 
section of plastic tube and in the smaller tube over a 22.78-foot section. 

The bottom pressure taps are about 8 feet above the mixing chamber.

The pressure taps in the flow sections are blocks of lucite machined to fit 
each tube. Each block has a hole bored and tapped for l/8-inch fittings, 

A 3/l6-inch hole is carefully drilled in the plastic tubing where the press¬ 
ure station is desired. The plastic block is then placed on the tubing so 
that the l/8-inch and 3/l6-inch holes coincide. It is then sealed to the 
tube, using chloroform. 

e. Air-Water Separation Section . The two vertical test sections can be 
connected separately to the 1-inch discharge header. In Fig. 3 the smaller 
tube is shown connected. The temperature of the air-water mixture is ob¬ 
tained, from a thermometer in this header. The header connects to an air- 
water separator consisting of a 30-gallon hot water tank supported at the 
middle by flanges on the floor grating. The top half of the separator is 
shown in Fig. 4 and the bottom half in Fig. 5. A sight glass is fitted on 
the lower half of the tank to indicate the amount of water in the tank. The 
air-water mixture enters At the middle of the tank, the water falls to the 
bottom and the air passes out of the top. The separator can be by-passed 
if necessary. When the test equipment is running, about a foot of water, 
indicated by the sight glass, is kept in the separator to maintain the re¬ 
quired pressure in the test section. A 1-inch "plug disc" globe valve at 
the bottom of the tank is used to control this water level. The water passes 
out through a 1-inch line to the drain. The air leaving the separator passes 
into the discharge line, through a 1-inch relief valve set to open at 30 p.s.i. 
and a l/2-inch control valve, and into an open-ended vertical 6-inch drain 
pipe. The air separates to the atmosphere and any moisture in the air drops 


into the drain

2. Auxiliary Equipment . 

The panel board shown in Fig. 6 is situated on the same level as 
the air and the water control valves. The two test sections pass flush in 
front of the panel board. A third test section (3/4-inch size), not as yet 
in use, is also shown. On the extreme left of the panel board are four 
pressure gauges measuring the water and the air pressures above and below the 
globe control valves. Next is a 5-foot Meriam manometer for measuring the 
water orifice differential pressure. Two manometers are used, one containing 
mercury under water and the other, carbon tetrachloride under water. To the 
right of the water differential manometer is another 5-foot Meriam manometer 
(partially obscured in Fig. 6 by the 3/4—inch angle aluminum rod) containing 
mercury under air. This manometer has one leg open to the atmosphere and the 
other leg has two needle valves on it such that either the mid-point pressure 
in the test section or the static air pressure upstream from the air orifice 
can be measured. The next two 76-cm. Meriam manometers, containing mercuty 
under air and water under air, measure the differential pressure drop of the 
flowing mixture over the test section. The 76-cm. Meriam manometer on the 
extreme left of the panel board measures the air orifice differential pressure. 
Two manometers are used, one containing water under air for low air rates and 
the other, mercury under air. All manometers have traps on both legs to pre¬ 
vent their fluids from being blown into the system. 

On the upstream and downstream pressure taps and the test section 
mid-point pressure tap there are separators to prevent water from entering 
the manometer leads. Fig. 7 shows the downstream tap and separator. These 
are constructed of two-foot lengths of l/2-inch butyrate tubing capped at

either end with l/2-inch galvanized iron caps that are drilled and tapped for 
l/8-inch pipe. About eight inches from the top the butyrate tube is drilled 
and tapped and fitted with an l/8-inch Saran fitting. This connects to the 
l/8-inch needle valve on the Lucite pressure tap through a three foot length 
of Saran tubing that is coiled to a five-inch circle. The pressure tap and 
the Saran fitting are in the same plane. The function of the Saran coil is 
to prevent water from passing into the separator. Since the pressure in the 
test section tends to oscillate, any air-water mixture in the coil moves back 
and forth with these pressure variations and only a slight amount of water is 
lost in the separator. The manometer leads run to the tops of the separators. 
Any water in the bottom of the separator can be drained through l/8-inch 
needle valves controlled on a panel board. 

The separator at the mid-point pressure tap (Fig. 8) is slightly 
smaller than the other two, and has Lucite caps. The Saran tubing from the 
top of this separator divides, and one line goes to the 5-foot static manome¬ 
ter and the other to a Brown Air-O-Line pneumatic controller. This controller, 
by actuating a Belfield l/2-inch motor valve in the air discharge line, main¬ 
tains constant midpoint pressure in the test section. The instrument has a 
proportional plus reset type of control action and both the propo r‘tional band 
and the reset rate can be varied. Air from the air supply header, filtered 
and reduced to 17 p.s.i., operates the controller. The motor valve has a by¬ 
pass consisting of a l/2-inch hand control valve and a 1-inch gate valve in 
parallel. The controller is shown in Fig. 9, and the motor valve in the air 
discharge line is shown in Fig. 10.

CHAPTER IV 


EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES 

In each tube, four series of constant water rate tests were made 
at test section mid-point pressures of 18 and 36 p.s.i.a. In all, 16 series 
of tests were made and for each series the air rate was varied from zero to 
the maximum rate attainable, the limit being reached when the mid-point 
pressure control valve and the control valve by-pass valves were wide open. 
(Any higher air rate resulted in the mid-point pressure increasing above the 
desired value.) In addition, an exploratory run was made at a water rate of 
4.15 lbs/ft 2 sec. and a mid-point pressure of 18 p.s.i.a. in the 1-inch tube, 
in which a liquid detergent (Tergitol) was added to the water in such an 
amount that its concentration was one part in ten thousand parts water. The 
same operating procedure was followed in each test. 

Operating Procedure . 

With both plug valves open and all pressure taps on the test sec¬ 
tion and the water orifice lines closed, the water control valves above and 
below the orifice lines are opened to admit water to the test section.. Water 
is flowed through the test section until no air bubbles are observed in the 
water in the plastic tube. The lower water control valve is then closed and 
the orifice line pressure taps ( both lines) are opened. Valves on the traps 
on the water flow manometer are then opened to permit "de-airing” of the 
manometer. When "de-airing" is completed, the valve above the orifice not 
being used is closed, along with the pressure taps in the same line. Uding 
both water control valves, a water rate slightly higher than desired is set. 
Tie air control valve is then opened carefully until approximately the desired

rate is reached. The mid-point pressure tap is then opened and the controller 
is turned on by admitting compressed air to it. The desired value of the mid¬ 
point pressure is set on the controller with the control index. Generally, 
a proportional band of 40% and a reset rate of 3 are found to give best con¬ 
trol, The water and air rates are then adjusted to the desired values and 
conditions are kept constant for ten or fifteen minutes. During this period, 
the air-water mixture temperature and the air temperature are noted and the 
barometer is read. The pressure drop taps are then opened and readings are 
taken of the water flow manometer, the air flow manometer, the static air 
and the mid-point pressure manometer, the gauge static air pressure and the 
pressure drop manometer. The pressure drop taps are then closed and the rod 
connecting the top and bottom plug valves is briskly pulled down. The con¬ 
troller is then turned off and the air and water control valves are closed. 
After allowing the water five minutes to settle, the level of the water in 
the tubes is recorded. The exact volume between the plug valves has been 
determined and marks corresponding to 100 c.c. intervals are found on the 
plastic tubes. With the completion of the test, the rod connecting the top 
and bottom plug valves is raised and a new test is carried out in a similar 


manner

CHAPTER V 


EXPERIMENTAL DATA 

The experimental data are presented in Tables I - III of Appendix A 
and in Tables IV - VIII of Appendix B. The data in Appendix A deal with 
calibrations and the data in Appendix B deal with the actual experimental 
tests. 

Appendix A. 

Table I contains data for the calibration of the water orifice 
plates. The test number is listed in column 1. Column 2 gives the amount 
of water collected in one-and two-litre flasks over the time interval listed 
in column 3. The calculated water rate, in ml/sec. and ft 3 /sec. is shown in 
column 4. The differential across the water flow manometer is reported in 
column 5 as inches of mercury under water, or as inches of carbon tetra¬ 
chloride under water. Plots of water rate versus manometer differential for 
the two orifice plates used are shown in Figs. 48 and 49 following Table I. 

Table II presents data for the calibration of the air orifice plate 
constants using a crifical flow prover. The number of the air orifice plate 
being calibrated is listed in column 1. The pressure, in p.s.i.a., upstream 
of the air orifice plate and the pressure differential, in inches of mercury 
under air, across the air orifice plates, are reported in columns 2 and 3 
respectively. The temperatures, degrees absolute, and the pressure, in p.s.i.a 
upstream of the critical flow prover are listed in columns 4 and 5 respective¬ 
ly. Column 6 gives the size of the critical flow prover and column 7 the 
critical flow coefficient of the prover. 

The results calculated from the data in Table II are listed in 
Table III. The air orifice plate number is reported in column 1. The actual 





40 . 


flow rates, in 1000 ft 3 /day are presented in column 2. These were calculated 
using the equation 


Q c = C P c 


/~ST 


where Q c = rate of flow, 1000ft 3 /24 hrs. at 14.4 p.s.i.a. and 60°F. 
C = critical flow coefficient. 

P c = pressure upstream of critical flow orifice, p.s.i.a.. 

S = specific gravity of the gas (= 1 for air). 

T = upstream temperature of flowing gas, °R. 


The air rate converted to ft 3 /sec. is reported in column 3, the 



term / hf P^ calculated from columns 2, 3 and 4 of Table II, is given in 


column 4, and the air orifice plate constant, K, is listed in column 5. These 
constants were calculated from the equation in the booklet, "The Orifice 
Meter*' published by the Pittsburgh Equitable Meter Company. The equation 
states that 



where Qc = air rate, ft 3 /sec. at 14.4 p.s.i.a. and 60°F, 

K = air orifice plate constant, 

hf = manometer difference, inches mercury under air, 

Pf = pressure upstream of air orifice plates, p.s.i.a., 
T = air temperature, °R. 


The average values of the constant for each plate, shown in column 5, 


are plotted versus their respective orifice diameters in Fig. 50 following 
Table III. The value of K for No. 2 Orifice Plate appears to be high. Since 
the value, 0.157, is above the curve which intersects the other three points.

is also higher than the value obtained by Radford (0.135), it is felt that 
the value of K at the point where the diameter of the plate intersects the 
line (0.147) will be more accurate, and hence is used. 

Appendix B. 

Table IV contains supplementary data giving the lengths and diameters 
of the test sections and the volumes of the test sections between plug valves. 

Table V contains the single-phase water flow experimental date for 
the l/2-inch tube. The test number is indicated in column 1 and the water 
temperature, in °F., in column 2. Column 3 gives the water rate, in ft 3 /sec., 
flowing through the tube, and column 4 shows the pressure drop over the test 
section in cm. of carbon tetrachloride under water and in cm. of mercury under 
water. 

Table VI contains the single-phase air flow experimental date. The 
test number is indicated in column 1, the test section in column 2 and the 
test section mid-point pressure in column 3. The flowing air rate, in 
ft 3 /sec. at 14.4 p.s.i.a. and 60°F., is given in column 4 and the air temper¬ 
ature in °R., in column 5. In column 6 the measured pressure drop over the 
test section, in cm. of water under air and in cm. of mercury under air, is 
shown. 

The two-phase flow experimental data are shown in Table VII. Column

both ft 3 /sec. and lbs,/ft 2 sec., are shown in column 3. The test section 
mid-point pressure is indicated in column 4 and the flowing air rate, in 
ft 5 /sec., at 14.4 p.s.i.a. and 60°F., in column 5. In column 6 the measured

into the air rate (at 14.4 p.s.i.a. and 60°F.) is listed. The measured 
pressure drop , calculated in p.s.i./lOO ft., is given in column 7. The 
test section air-water ratio, obtained by dividing the volume of water 
between the plug valves into the volume of air (columns 7 & 8, Table VII) 
is shown in column 8. 

The measured pressure drops are plotted versus the discharge air- 
water ratios for each water rate at both mid-point pressures in both tubes 
in Figs. 19 - 26. The test section air-water ratios are plotted versus the 
discharge air-water ratios in Figs. 32 - 39. 

The values of the pressure drops and the discharge air-water ratios 
corresponding to each maximum and minimum point in Figs. 19 to 26 are shown 
in Table XII. The test section is listed in column 1, the mid-point pressure

discharge air-water ratio at the maximum are listed, and in.columns 8 and 9 
the pressure drop and discharge air-water ratio at the second minimum are 
listed. 

In Figs. 27 and 28 the pressure drops at these inflection points 
are plotted versus water rate, and in Figs. 29 and 30 the discharge air-water 
ratios are plotted versus the water rate. 

The calculated results of the exploratory runs with detergent added 
to the water are shown in Table XIII. The test number is given in column 1, 
the discharge air-water ratio in column 2, and the measured pressure drop in 
column 3. The measured pressure drops are plotted versus the discharge air-

In Table XIV the two components of the pressure drop, the hydro¬ 
static head and the irreversibilities are calculated for various discharge 
air-water ratios in the 1-inch tube at 18 p.s.i.a. for a water rate of 
4.15 lbs/ft 2 sec. In column 1 the discharge air-water ratios are listed and

CHAPTER VII 


INTERPRETATION AND CORRELATION OF RESULTS 

A. Single-Phase Flow . 

In Fig. 11 the plot of friction factor versus Reynolds number for 
water in the 0.640-inch tube is shown. For comparison, the friction factor 
curve obtained by Radford for the 1.049-inch tube and the curve for smooth 
pipes are also plotted. It will be noted that the curves for the 0.640-inch 
and the 1.049-inch tubes are above the curve for smooth pipes. The data in 
the smaller tube were taken immediately following the pure air runs. The 
air carried with it a slight oil mist from the compressors and this oil may 
have been deposited on the walls of the tube to give the effect of roughness 
since the tube should be smooth or nearly so. 

In Fig. 12 the plot of friction factor versus Reynolds number for 
air in both tubes at both pressures is shown. Only the data in which the 
measured pressure drops corresponding with manometer readings greater than 
8 c.m. of water are plotted, in order to reduce possible error. Even after 
eliminating the low pressure drop results, the data show random scattering 
and lie mostly below the curve for smooth pipes. The data taken at 
36 p.s.i.a. in the 0.640-inch tube are the exception and are close to, or on, 
the smooth pipe curve. Results from previous work in the 1.049-inch tube are 
also plotted. They lie even farther below the smooth pipe curve. 

A comparison of the water and air data shows contradictory results. 
It seems hardly possible that mis-alignment of the pressure tap openings into 
the tubes or burrs or other roughnesses would cause the discrepancies in the 
air data, since their effect would also be noticed in the water data. Leaks 
in the manometer lines and pressure taps can hardly be considered a source of

error since they were prevented by frequent testing with a soap solution. 

Errors in measuring the air flow would not be great enough to account for 
the errors either. The calibrations of the orifice plates used to measure 
the air were checked until consistent results were obtained. The effect of 
water vapor or fine oil mist in the air, on the viscosity of the air would 
not be great enough to affect either the viscosity or the density signifi¬ 
cantly. 

Thus, no completely satisfactory explanation has been found to 
account for the scattered data. It might be well to note that, as Binder (l) 
says, ''One cannot expect a high degree of accuracy in determining f. For 
smooth tubing actual data may show a variation or scatter of+5 per cent in f. 
For commercial steel or wrought iron pipe, actual data may show a variation 
within+30 per cent in f•" The average of the water and the air data is within 
5 per cent of the smooth pipe curve. The conformity of these data to within 
5 per cent of the accepted values of f for a smooth pipe is an indication 
that the tubes are smooth or nearly so, and that the pressure drop data are 
reliable. 

B. Two-Phase Flow . 

1. Visual Observations. 

Pressure drops for the flowing air - water mixtures in the two 
test sections were measured for various air rates over as wide a range as poss¬ 
ible at each of the four different water rates. These data were taken at two 
constant test section mid-point pressures. For both test sections, at any 
water rate and at either mid-poipt pressure, the flowing two-phase mixture 
was observed to follow the same flow pattern with increasing air rate. Thus 
the introduction of air into flowing water results in bullet-shaped slugs of

air travelling up through the water separated by pistons of water. This is 
the slug flow region and is shown in Fig. 13. Increasing the air rate 
causes the slugs to become longer and bubbles of air to form in the water 
pistons. Such is the case in Fig. 14 where the top half of the photograph 
shows part of an elongated slug of air and the bottom half a piston of water 
mixed with bubbles of air. Gradually the pistons of water become frothy and 
merge together into "froth" flow characterized by a more nearly uniform mix¬ 
ture of air and water occupying the whole cross-section of the tube. The 
motion of the water appears to be random. This flow pattern is shown in 
Fig. 15. Further increasing the air rate results in part of the water moving 
up the walls of the tube, as in Fig. 16. Gradually less and less water mixes 
with the air until all the water moves up the tube walls and the air passes 
up the center in a core. Thus the annular film flow region is reached as 
shown in Fig. 17. With still higher air rates, the air core picks up the 
water as a mist, as in Fig. 18. Eventually, all of the water is flowing as 

a mist in the air at higher air rates. This is the mist flow region. 

2. Pressure Drop Results . 

a. Pressure Drop vs. Discharge Air Water Ratio Curves . 

Pressure drops, calculated as p.s.i./loo ft. of tube are plotted 
against air-water discharge ratios for both test sections and for both press¬ 
ures for each of the four water rates in Figs. 19 to 25. The observed flow 

patterns at each air rate were used to show the range of each type of flow 

pattern, viz., slug, froth, annular, film and mist, on these curves. These 
ranges are similar to those obtained in earlier work (14). 

It will be noted that the curves all show the same general shape. 

With only water flowing in the test sections (zero air-water discharge), the

measured pressure drop is largely due to the hydrostatic head of the column 
of water. Introducing air into the test section at increasing rates results 
in a rapid decrease in the measured pressure drop. This decrease continues 
until a minimum point is reached. Increasing the air rate beyond this point 
results in the pressure drop increasing to a maximum. From the introduction 
of air into the water through the pressure drop minimum and slightly beyond 
it, the slug type of flow pattern is observed. Between these maximum and 
minimum points the flow gradually changes from the slug type to the froth 
type. Further increasing the air rate causes the pressure drop to decrease 
again to a second minimum. Between the maximum and the second minimum the 
flow pattern changes from froth to annular film flow. At air rates beyond this 
second minimum, the pressure drop increases with increasing air rate to the 
highest air rate possible in the test equipment. Somewhere beyond the second 
minimum the flow pattern changes from the annular film to the mist type. 

Although the general shape of the curves in the larger tube conform 
to those of Radford, greater values of the pressure drop at any discharge 
air-water ratio are found. These differences may be due to three things. 

The calibrations of the orifice plates used to measure the air flow were check¬ 
ed and higher values of the orifice constants were found. Previously, an air 
purge system was used to keep the different manometer lines free of water. 

This system was removed and the small separators were installed. The mid¬ 
point pressure in the test section was somewhat higher, i.e., 18 p.s.i.a. 
compared to 16.2 p.s.i.a.. Any one, or all three, of these changes may be 
the cause of the higher pressure drops.

b. Effect of Water Rate , 

The effect of varying the water rate is shown in Figs, 19 to 
26. At the lowest water rate the pressure drop at the second minimum is 
lower than the pressure drop at the first minimum. With increasing water 
rate this situation changes until at the highest water rate used, only a 
bare suggestion of a second minimum occurs and at a greater pressure drop 
than the first minimum. This would confirm the observations in previous 
work (14). The disappearance of the second minimum is more pronounced in 
the smaller tube. 

The effect of water rate is also shown in Figs. 27 and 28, in 
which the measured pressure drops at the first and second minimum points and 
the maximum are plotted against the water rate. The points are scattered but 
do show the definite increase in pressure drop with increasing water rate. 

In Figs. 29 and 30 the discharge air-water ratio at the minimum and maximum 
points are also plotted against the water rate. At lower water rates the 
discharge ratio decreases rapidly with increasing water rate. At higher water 
rates the decrease is more gradual and suggests that the discharge ratio at 
these inflection points would change very little at high water rates. 

c. Effect of Gas Phase Density. 

The effect of gas phase density at each of the four water rates in 
the two sizes of tubing is also shown in Figs. 19 to 26. The tests in both 
tubes were conducted at test section mid-point pressures of 18 and 36 p.s.i.a. 
Thus, the gas phase density at the higher pressure was twice that of the lower 
pressure. At the higher gas phase density the measured pressure drops at 

i 

most ot the discharge air-water ratios are considerably different from those 
at the lower density. The two curves are out of phase with each other, When

the measured pressure drop reaches the first minimum at the lower density, the 
measured pressure drop at the higher density is about 35 per cent greater for 
the same air rate. As the air-water ratio increases, the measured pressure 
drop at the lower density increases to the maximum, whereas the measured 
pressure drop at the higher density continues to decrease until it reaches 
the first minimum at approximately the same air-water ratio at which the maxi¬ 
mum is reached at the lower density. Increasing the air-water ratio results 
in the pressure drop decreasing to the second minimum and then increasing at 
the lower density while the pressure drop at the higher density increases to 
the maximum and then decreases to the second minimum. Thereafter, the higher 
density curve lags the lower density curve at increasing air-water ratios. As 
would be expected, the two minimum and the maximum points for the higher 
density flow occur at roughly twice the air-water ratios at which the corres¬ 
ponding inflection points at the lower density occur. The maximum for each 
of the 16 curves occurs at about twice the air-water ratio of the first minimum. 

d. Effect of Diameter . 

The effect of tubing diameter is not so pronounced. The inflec¬ 
tion points occur at approximately the same air-water ratios in both tubes. 

The pressure drops at these points are slightly greater in the larger tube for 
the first three water rates, and smaller at the highest water rate. Beyond 
the second minimum the pressure drop increases more rapidly with increasing 
air rate in the smaller tube. 

e. Effect of Surface Tension. 

An exploratory run was made with a small amount of detergent 
added to the water in an attempt to determine the importance of the surface 
tension of the liquid phase on the pressure drop of the two-phase mixture.

31. Effect of Liquid Phase Surface Tension on the Pressure 
Drop Discharge Air-Water Ratio Curve (1-inch Tube, Water 
Rate - 4.15 lbs./ft^ sec.) 


























75. 


Five runs were made at the lowest water rate in the larger tube with the 
test section mid-point pressure constant at 18 p.s.i.a. The results of these 
tests are plotted in Fig. 31. 

A detergent (Tergitol Penetrant No. 4) was added to the water such 
that its concentration was 1 part in 10,000. The addition was made prior to 
the water mixing with the air. Surface tension measurements were made by the 
Du Nouy method on samples of the water plus detergent and the pure water. 
Relative to the pure water, the surface tension of the mixture was o.80. 

The detergent caused the mixture to become a foam of small air 
bubbles in water not unlike soap suds. At low air rates, the flow pattern 
was one of slugs of air passing through this air-water foam. In the annular 
film region the water annulus was cloudy, suggesting that it was an air-water 
foam. It would appear that the effect of the detergent is to lower the press¬ 
ure drop of the two-phase mixture, although not as much as had been expected. 

No data were taken at, or near, the maximum point in the froth region; hence 
the discontinuity of the curve. The maximum may be considerably lower with 
the addition of the detergent to the water. Higher concentrations of deter¬ 
gent were found to be impracticable because of excessive foam which made 
pressure drop measurements difficult to obtain. 

3. Test Section Hold-Up Results. 

(a) Test Section Air-Water Ratio vs. Discharge Air-Water Ratio 
Curves. 

In Figs. 32 to 39 the test section air-water ratios (ft 3 air at 
mid-point pressure/ft 3 water) are plotted versus the discharge air-water ratios 
(ft 3 air at 14.4 p.s.i.a. and 60°F/ft 3 water). It will be noted that with 
increasing discharge ratios the test section ratio passes through a maximum 
coincident with the slug flow minimum on the pressure drop curve, decreases

to a minimum at the same discharge ratio as the pressure drop maximum in the 
froth flow region, and then steadily increases through the annular film and 
mist flow regions. 

The water particles, in the mist flow region, become smaller with 
increasing air rate and , if this air rate is high enough, they may become 
vaporized. The flow then would be single phase and the hold-up would be zero. 

It may well be that the test section air-water ratio (corrected to standard 
conditions) approaches the discharge air-water ratio at these high air rates 
and becomes very nearly equal to it just prior to the point where the water 
all becomes vaporized. 

(b) Slip Velocity . 

An attempt was made to calculate the slip velocity, i.e., the 
velocity of the air relative to the particles of water, using the results 
obtained in the mist flow region in the smaller tube. In this region the flow 
pattern is the simplest since the water appears to be in the form of discrete 
particles. An equation was developed expressing the slip velocity in terms 
of the discharge ratio, the test section ratio, the water rate and the cross- 
section of the empty tube. Velocities of spheres, ellipsoids, and tear-drop 
shaped particles of water falling in air were calculated and plotted against 
their diameters. From these curves the calculated slip velocities indicated 
water particles having diameters from 3/32 to l/2 inches for tear-drop shaped 
particles, 5/32 to 27/32 inches for ellipsoids and even larger diameters for 
spheres. Since the calculated slip velocities increased with increasing air- 
rate, the particle diameters likewise increased. Observations of the diameters 
of water particles in the mist flow region indicated that these calculated diame¬ 
ters were much too large and that with increasing air rate the particles became

smaller. The results appear to indicate that the true mist flow condition 
probably had not been reached and that a thin annulus of water may have existed 
on the inside wall of the tube resulting in an error in the calculated slip 
velocity. Further study is evidently necessary in order to correlate liquid 
hold-up with the discharge air-water ratio. 

c. Effects of Water Rate, Gas Phase Density and Tubing Diameter . 

With increasing water rate the test section air-water ratios 
at the maximum and minimum points appear to decrease slightly. 

At any discharge ratio the effect of doubling the gas phase density 
is to increase the test section ratio when these ratios at the two densities 
are compared at standard conditions. At the higher density the curves show 
the same maximum and minimum points corresponding with the first two inflec¬ 
tion points on the pressure drop curves and lag those at the lower density. 

Little or no difference is found between the test section ratios 
in the two tubes at any discharge ratio up to the highest air rates that were 
possible in the test equipment. 

4. Correlation of Friction Factors, 
a. Energy Balances . 

In previous work (14) energy balances for air and water simul¬ 
taneously entering and leaving an elemental section of vertical tubing were 
developed from the first law of thermodynamics. These energy balances were 
combined and, after assuming that the surface energy and kinetic energy terms 
were negligible, and that the inlet and outlet air-water ratios were equal, 
the resulting differential equation was integrated. Upon simplifying and 
transposing the terms, the equation became

b. Determination of Friction Losses . 

Using the above relationship, the friction loss, ^F^ , is 
calculated at several points over a wide range on the smoothed pressure 
drop - discharge air-water ratio curves for each water rate at both gas phase 
densities in the two tubes. This , however, expresses the losses in 

terms of foot pounds force per pound mass of flowing water. Radford suggested 
that since the flow pattern appears dependent mainly on the air rate, any 
calculations of friction losses, friction factor and Reynolds number might be 
expressed in terms of the flowing air phase alone. This approach was also 
used by Carpenter (2), Gazley (4) and Jenkins (6) in their work on two-phase, 
two-component flow in vertical and horizontal tubes, at the University of 
Delaware. At this stage it would appear to be the most logical method. To 
obtain ^Fq , the losses expressed in ft,lbsf/lb m of flowing air, Sf^ is 
multiplied by the ratio of the mass rate of flow of water to air, i.e., 

= t The measured pressure drop - discharge air-water ratio 

curve for the 4.15 lbs/ft 2 sec. water rate at the lower gas phase density 

in the larger tube is shown again in Fig. 40. The two components of this 
pressure drop, computed from the above equation, are also plotted. It will 
be noted that at low discharge ratios the hydrostatic head equivalent forms 
a large part of the measured pressure drop but quickly falls off to a very 
small value with increasing discharge ratios. The friction or irreversibility 
equivalent then accounts for virtually all of the pressure drop. At zero 
discharge ratio the measured pressure drop is 45.5 p.s.i./lOO ft. mainly 
due to the hydrostatic head of the column of water.

c. Determination of Friction Factor. 

The determination of friction factors for the flowing two-phase 
mixtures is approached by analogy to single-phase flow in tubes. Thus a fric¬ 
tion factor defined as

Vq = gas phase velocity based on the empty cross section of the 
tube, ft./sec. 

D = diameter of tube, ft. 

N = length of tube, ft. 

A = cross section of tube, ft 2 

(Other items as defined in Part (a) above.] is used to correlate the 
friction losses. It is realized that this friction factor almost surely will 
be dependent upon the ratio of the mass rates of flow of the air and water, the 
gas phase density, the water rate, the tube diameter and length, the flow 
pattern of the two phase mixture, the surface tension of the liquid phase and 
other variables as well as the tube roughness and the Reynolds number as in 
the case of single phase flow. 

Using valuee of ^Fq computed from pressure drops from the smoothed 
pressure drop vs. discharge air-water ratio curves, friction factors are 
calculated from the above equation and are plotted in Figs. 41 and 42 against 
a superficial Reynolds number based on the flowing air, and the empty cross 
section, i.e..

Fig. 42. Variation of Friction Factor with Reynolds Number 
1-inch Tube. 

























































































92 . 


Two sets of curves are shown for each tube, these being for each gas phase 
density. The water rates are marked on each curve. For comparison, the 
friction factor curve for single phase fluids is also shown in each figure. 

The most notable features of the curves are the magnitude of the 
friction factor at low Reynolds numbers and the change in the friction factor 
with increasing Reynolds numbers. At a Reynolds number of 1000, the friction 
factors for the two-phase flow are about 1,000 times greater than that for 
single-phase flow. With increasing Reynolds numbers the friction factor 
curves decrease rapidly in the slug flow range. In the transition from slug 
to froth flow, the curves all show a marked change in slope and the decrease in 
the friction factor is not so great. Thereafter, the rapid decrease in fg. 
continues again until the mist flow region is reached. In this region the 
decrease in f^ is again not so great and the curves show a gradual tendency 
to approach the curve for single phase fluid at Reynolds numbers greater than 
100,000. This would be expected since at high discharge air-water ratios the 
single-phase condition is approximated. Over the range of Reynolds numbers 
studied, the slopes of the curves, disregarding the transition region and the 
mist flow region:, , are all about -2.1. 

In correlating the pressure drops for two-phase flow by means of a 
method analogous to that used for single-phase flow, it is appreciated that the 
former flow is complex and can not be solved completely by the methods used for 
the latter. After preparing the friction factor - Reynolds number curves, a 
parameter based upon the fraction of the tube filled with gas was plotted on 
them. At various assumed values of the ratio of the volume of gas in the 
tube to the total volume of the tube, i.e., the fraction of the tube filled 
with gas, the test section air-water ratio was calculated for each curve.

From Figs. 32 to 39 the corresponding discharge ratio was obtained and the 
Reynolds number was calculated. These ratios were plotted on each curve at 
their respective Reynolds numbers. It was thought that a series of curves 
might be obtained analogous to those for different relative roughnesses for 
single phase flow in pipes since it is felt that the test section air-water 
ratio may be the controlling factor in that part of the friction losses due 
to effect of interfacial roughness between the air and the water. The points, 
however, were scattered and no satisfactory curves joining all points of 
equal ratios could be obtained. Further investigation of the test section 
ratio is evidently necessary 

Since a separate curve is obtained for each water rate at each of 
the gas phase densities in both tubes, it is obvious that these variables 
have considerable influence on the friction factor. Such a plot is of little 
value in solving two-phase flow problems unless the influence of each varia¬ 
ble over a wide range has been determined. Only the effects of water rate, 
gas phase density and tubing diameter have been measured. These three 
variables are considered separately using cross-plots of Figs. 41 and 42. 

d. Effect of Water Rate. 

As a first attempt to analyze the effect of water rate, a 
cr@£s plot of the friction factors at four different fteynolds numbers, 2000, 
6000, 10,000 and 20,000 at the two gas phase densities in each tube versus 
the water rate, was prepared on semi-log graph paper. The values of the ordinate 
at W = 0 for the four Reynolds numbers were obtained from the curve for 
single-phase fluids in smooth pipes. However, on the semi-log paper the 
points were too crowded at the low water rates; hence it was felt that the

use of log log paper would show the curves better. In order to get around 
the difficulty of zero water flow, the friction factors are plotted against 
(W + 0.1) instead of W, as shown in Figs. 43 and 44. Strictly speaking, this 
results in a slight distortion in the curves as low values of W, hut it does 
enable the curves to be plotted d:own to W = 0. Since no data are available 
for water rates between 0 and 4.15 lbs^/ft^ sec., the curves are dotted in 
this region and their positions are only assumptions* However, it is apparent 
that the addition of a slight amount of water to the flowing air results in 
a large increase in the friction factor, the increase being greatest at low 
Reynolds numbers. Increasing water rate in the range studied has little 
effect on the friction factor at low Reynolds numbers, especially in the 
larger tube. With increasing Reynolds numbers the effect of the water rate 
on the magnitude of the friction factor becomes smaller, but with increasing 
water rate the friction factor becomes greater. This is more pronounced 
in the smaller tube. 

e. Effect of Gas Phase Density . 

The friction factor at the four Reynolds numbers (2000, 6000, 
10,000 and 20,000) for each water rate in both tubes are plotted against the 
ratios of the gas phase to the liquid phase density in Fig. 45. Since only 
two densities were used, the results cannot be extrapolated over a wide range 
of densities. The results do show, however, that at the higher density, the 
friction factors are higher, the increase being greater at the lowest and the 
highest Reynolds numbers. It would appear that the flow pattern greatly influ¬ 
ences the results. The effect of flow pattern in the intermediate Reynolds 
number (6000) results in the smaller increase in the friction factor at the 
higher density. This is the transformation region from slug to froth flow.

f. Effect of Tubing Diameter . 

In Figs. 46 and 47, friction factors at Reynolds numbers of 
2000, 6000, 10,000 and 20,000 are plotted against tube diameters for each 
water rate and each gas phase density. Friction factors are from 2 l/2 to 
9 times higher in the larger tube than in the smaller tube. The increase 
appears to depend upon the water rate, the gas phase Reynolds number and the 
gas phase density, but shows no consistent pattern. At the lower gas phase 
density, the greatest increase in fg. between the two diameters is at a 
Reynolds number of 10,000, whereas at the higher density the greatest increase 
is at a Reynolds number of 20,000. As observed in Part (d), friction factors 
increase more rapidly with increasing water rate in the smaller tube than in 
the larger one. 

( g) Summary of Friction Factor Results . 

At low water rates the effect of water rate on the friction 
factors appears to be very great, but at higher water rates, the air rate 
and consequently the gas phase Reynolds number become more important. The 
magnitude of the effect of.gas phase density on the friction factors is de¬ 
pendent upon the pattern of the flowing mixture, which is in turn dependent 
upon the flowing air rate. The effect of diameter is not consistent but 
appears to be dependent upon a combination of water rate, gas phase density 
and flow rate. 

Thus it appears that the friction factors for two-phase vertical 
flow are complex. Because of the number of variables that influence these 
friction factors, a correlation of the effect of any one variable alone is 
difficult to obtain. Further studies of the effects of water rate, gas phase 
density and tubing diameter are evidently necessary before a general relation-

examination of the flow patterns and their effects on the other variables 
would be very helpful. Such an examination might shed information on inter¬ 
facial roughness, i.e. the roughness effect of the liquid phase on the gas 
phase.

CHAPTER VIII 


CONCLUSIONS 

1. Studies have been conducted on the upward flow of air-water mixtures 
in vertical tubes embracing the following range of variables: tube diameter, 
0.640-inch and 1.049-inch; test section mid-point pressure, 18.0 and 36.0 
p.s.i.a.; gas rate, 0 to 0.97 ft 3 /sec. at 14.4 p.s.i.a and 60°F.; liquid 
rate, 4.15, 8.00, 17.9 and 51.9 lbs/ft 2 sec. The following observations have 
been made: 

a. The same series of flow patterns are found regardless of water 
rate, gas phase density, or tubing diameter. That is, as the air rate is 
increased, the flow pattern passes through the slug region, the froth region, 
the annulus film region and the mist region. The transition from one type 
to the next is gradual and does not occur at any definite air rate. 

b. The measured pressure drop shows the same general trend for 
different water rates, gas phase densities, and tubing diameters. As the air 
rate is increased the pressure drop passes through a first minimum point, a 
maximum point, a second minimum point, and then increases steadily. The magni¬ 
tude of the pressure drop, however, is greatly influenced by these variables. 
With increasing water rates the pressure drops at these inflection points 
become greater and the second minimum point disappears at high water rates. 
Doubling the gas phase density results in the pressure drop - discharge air- 
water ratio curve lagging the corresponding curve of the lower density. Tubing 
diameter shows only slight effects on the pressure drop. An exploratory run 
conducted with the surface tension of the liquid phase decreased to 80 per cent 
of that for water alone, shows only a small decrease in pressure drop.

c. The air-water ratio existing in the test sections increases to 
a maximum point, decrease slightly to a minimum joint and then increase steadily 
with increasing discharge air-water ratios. These two inflection points occur 
at the same air-water ratios as the first two pressure drop inflection points 
hut are reversed. 

An attempt to determine the slip velocity of the gas phase past the 
liquid phase in the mist flow region shows that further studies of test sec¬ 
tion hoM-up are required before this velocity can be properly calculated. 

2. Using a method proposed by Radford in earlier work on gas-liquid 
flow, the measured pressure drops are separated into two components, the hydro¬ 
static head losses and the friction losses. The hydrostatic head losses are 
only significant at low discharge air-water ratios and decrease rapidly with 
increasing discharge ratio. The friction losses, expressed in terms of the 
gas phase, are used to calculate friction factors based on the flowing gas 
phase. These friction factors, arbitrarily defined as 

f G = iS_ DA 2 

2 <= 2 

are plotted against superficial Reynolds numbers also calculated on the basis 
of the flowing gas phase occupying the entire cross-section of the tube. The 
results show that friction factors for two-phase flowing mixtures are as much 
as 1000 times greater than friction factors for single phase fluids at corres¬ 
ponding Reynolds numbers and that with increasing Reynolds numbers, the 
friction factors decrease sharply over the range studied. The curves all have 
a slope of approximately -2.1. This attempt to correlate the gas phase fric¬ 
tion factor with the gas phase Reynolds number is only partially successful 
in that the data for each water rate, gas phase density and tube fall on

separate curves. The effects of these variables on the friction factor 
appear to be interrelated and are complex. No complete correlation of these 
variables is possible at this time and further studies of their effects are 


necessary.

ABSTRACT 

The elementary thermodynamics and the flow pattern terminology of 
the upwards vertical flow of gas-liquid mixtures is reviewed and new 
terminology is proposed* 

Data on the upwards vertical flow of air-water mixtures in a smooth 
bore 1.025 inch I.D. tube are presented for a range of nine water rates 
from 0*00040 to 0.0421 cu, ft. per sec. and for air-water volume ratios 
under flow conditions from 0 to 348. T^e properties of the gas and liquid 
phases were held constant through the maintenance of constant average 
flowing pressure and temperature at 36.0 psia and 70 P. 

A correlation of the data based upon the. thermodynamic analysis 
is presented. The correlation enables the prediction of flow pattern, 
pressure drop and holdup ratio for gas and liquid rates within the range 
tested but is restricted as to tube diameter and liquid and gas phase 
properties. 

INTRODUCTION 

The general problem of the vertical flow of gas—liquid mixtures has 
received attention by a number of workers from the early days of the inven¬ 
tion of the airlift pump to the present time. The application of gas lift 
principles to oil well production in the late 1920 ’s stimulated further 
interest in two phase vertical flow and resulted in a number of mathematical 
and experimental studies. These investigations have shown that the vertical 
flow of two phase mixtures differs materially from that of single phase 
systems in two important respectss

(1) The flow pattern cannot be described simply (as for single 
phase systems) as laminar, transitional or turbulent. In the 
complex flow pattern of two phase systems the relative amounts 
of the phases, their dispersion one in the other, and their 
individual motions are all important. 

(2) The two phase mixture actually in motion in a vertical tube is 
never of the same overall composition as that admitted or re¬ 
leased from the tube even under conditions of steady state. 

This difference In relative quantities of the two phases has 
been referred to under the headings of ’’slip” and ’’holdup”. 

In general the fluid of lower density tends to slip past that 
of higher density so that, in the case of a gas-liquid system, 
the gas-liquid ratio in the flow tube is reduced over that of 
the entering or leaving mixtures. 

The complexity of the flow pattern and the existence of holdup make 
it obvious that the relationships between pressure drop and the pertinent 
variables will also be much more complex than is the case in the flow of 
single phase fluids. Moreover the differences in terminology used, the 
many variables involved, and the lack of or differences in the control of 
certain of the variables has made the interpretation and correlation of 
experimental data difficult. While considerable progress has been made in 
the overall and qualitative understanding of the problem .much remains to be 
done from a quantitative viewpoint# 

The work to be reported in the series of papers of which this is 
the first was undertaken with the pruposes of 

(1) clarifying the terminology and descriptions of the flow 
patterns encountered, 

(2) obtaining data, under controlled conditions, on-the influence 
of the pertinent variables on flow patterh, holdup and pressure 
drop, 

and ( 3 ) obtaining a general correlation which would enable the predicti 

of flow pattern, holdup and pressure drop for a,ny gas-liquid 
system in upwards vertical flow.

This paper includes a thermodynamic analysis of the problem and deals spec¬ 
ifically with the upwards vertical flow of air-water mixtures. Experimental 
data and certain correlations are presented on the effect of air-water 
volume ratio, at various water rates, on the flow pattern, the holdup, and 
the pressure drop. 


VARIABLES INVOLVED 


The primary variables involved in the upwards vertical flow of 
gas-liquid mixtures are the followings 

Liquid Properties 

Density, or specific volume, v^ 

Viscosity, jj ^ 

Surface tension (to gas), g- 
Gas Properties 

Density, /? or specific volume, v^ 

Viscosity, f 0 
Geometrical Properties 

Tube diameter, D 

Tube roughness, b 

D 

Tube height, Z 


Flow Rates 

Mass flow of liquid phase, L 
Mass flow of Gas phase, G 

Certain of these basic properties are dependent upon other variables. For 
example the gas phase density will depend upon the nature of the gas, the 
extent of vaporization into it of the liquid, the pressure and the temp¬ 
erature. Similarity the liquid density, viscosity.and surface tension will 
depend upon the nature of the liquid, the temperature, and the solubility 
in it of the gas - this latter depending again on pressure and temperature. 
Despite the complex interrelationship of properties with pressure, temp-

- 4 - 


erature and solubility it seems clear that the effects of pressure, 
temperature and solubility need not be considered as separate from those 
of the basic properties listed above* One may, therefore, expect that the 
pressure drop per unit height, the flow pattern, and the slip or holdup 
would all be functions of the primary variables* i.e* 


dP 

dX 

= ft' (v L > (T, L, G, D, _£_) 

(1) 

Flow Pattern 

= fi" ( v L »/ ty L » <T> ) 

(2) 

Holdup 

= 0 (t l , (T, v G , fS a , L, G, D, ) 

(3) 


These relationships point out a difficulty which has not always been 
appreciated by other workers* It is this: to the extent that the specific 
volume of the gas phase (in particular) influences flow pattern, holdup 
and pressure drop, this variable should be controlled in any experimental 
study of the effect of the other variables. The most practical approach to 
this seems to be through the conduct of tests at constant average temperat¬ 
ure and at constant average pressure. Another point clarified by the above 
equations is that, in principle, one should be able to correlate the press¬ 
ure drop with the pertinent variables indicated without separately including 
flow pattern or holdup* Certainly, however, a pressure drop correlation 
would be expected to reflect the basically different flow patterns.. 

While it seems reasonable the surface tension and liquid and gas 

(l) 

viscosities would be variables, work of Gosline' and Poettmann ..and 

( 2 ) 

Carpenter v ' in particular suggests that the effect of surface tension is 
small and that, in regions of turbulent motion, gas phase viscosity may hot 
be important. 

THERMODYNAMIC ANALYSIS 

Consider a differential height, dX, of a smooth vertical tube of 
diameter, D, to which is admitted a liquid and a gas phase at rates L. and 
G. Assume the phases are saturated with respect to one another upon 
admittance. Thus for the time interval dT the well known mechanical energy

balance may be written for each phase

arbitrary as the two are mathematically equivalent® 

These basic relationships suggest that pressure drop data for the 
vertical flow of two phase systems might best be understood 

(1) by separating the unit irreversibility component from the total 
pressure drop, 

« t 

(2) by calculating a two phase friction factor (either f or f

from equation (13) or ( 19 )) 

and ( 3 ) by seeking a correlation of the friction factor with a super¬ 
ficial Reynolds number, a relative roughness term and a mass 
or volume ratio of the phases® 

The fact that even a very small amount of liquid in a gas stream greatly 
increases pressure drop indicates further that the presence of the liquid 
phase may well outshadow the effect of roughness ( 3 ) and also that.at high 
velocities (fully developed turbulence) viscosity effects may ..be very 
small. In this work, where tube diameter and gas .and liquid, properties 
are held constant, the pressure drop data are correlated as functions of 
superficial liquid velocity (proportional to liquid Reynolds number) and 
the volume ratio of the phases. 

( 2 ) 

Poettmann and Carpenter v ' have also applied the mechanical energy 
balance to the vertical two phase flow problem but in an approximate, 
manner® Their assumption that a two (or three) phase..mixture, could, be 
treated as a pseudo homogeneous phase of constant equivalent specific 
Volume has led to a useful practical correlation but is not too sound fund¬ 
amentally * 

HOLDUP and SLIP 

As has been mentioned one of the distinguishing characteristics of 
two phase vertical flow is the development, within the flow section, of a 





-9- 


concentration of the denser phase greater than that in the supply mixture® 
The term ’’holdup ratio” is used in this paper as a quantitative measure of 
this liquid accumulation® Holdup ratio is here defined as the ratio of 
(a) the gas-liquid volume ratio in the supply mixture to (h) the gas-liquid, 
volume ratio in the flow section. Both volume ratios are expressed, in 
cu® ft® per cu. ft. at average flow pressure and temperature® Galegar, 
Stovall and Huntington^^ have reported quantities equivalent to the ind¬ 
ividual ratios (a) and (h) and Calvert and Williamshave made a math¬ 
ematical analysis of holdup in the film or annular flow region® Other 
workers (l, 4? 6 ? 7) have referred to the ’’slip velocity” of the gas phase® 
Slip velocity has been defined as the difference in the average lineal 
velocities of the gas and the liquid phases both measured at average flow 
pressure and temperature® 

The two quantities y holdup ratio and slip velocity are two measures 
of the same phenomenon and are simply interrelated as follows? 

Let the volume fraction of the flow section occupied.by the gas 
phase be defined as q® Then 1-q represents the volume fraction occupied by 
the liquid phase®

FLOW PATTERN TERMINOLOGY 

The flow pattern for the upwards vertical flow of gas-liquid 
mixtures has "been variously described by Gosline^), Bergelin^), Stovall 
and Huntington^), Calvert and Williams^), Cromer and Huntington^), 
Radford^), Dunn^^), Martinelli, R. C. et al^^) and others. The desc¬ 
riptions of most of these workers were based either .upon visual and qualit¬ 
ative studies or upon "efficiency" or liquid "yield” considerations. Radford 
and Dunn and, later, Calvert and Williams correlated their flow pattern 
descriptions with pressure drop observations. This method, which has the 
advantage of greater precision of definition, is used here. 

A typical pressure drop vs gas—liquid volume ratio curve at cons¬ 
tant low liquid rate and at constant average pressure and temperature for 
air-water flow in a smooth tube of 1.025 inch i.d. is shown in.Figure 1 . 

(At higher liquid rates the curve changes its.shape and shifts upwards as 
will be discussed later.) On the basis of this relationship it seems 
reasonable to divide the curve as indicated into four pressure drop regimes 
I, II, III, IV characterized respectively by a decreasing, an ihcreasing, 
a decreasing and an increasing unit pressure drop with increasing gas- 
liquid volume ratio at constant liquid rate. This basic division may then 
be subdivided, and given qualitative description by reference to visual 
observations. The terminology used by previous investigators has. been re¬ 
viewed and compared on this basis. Figure 2 shows th.e interrelationship, of. 

the terminology as nearly as this can be determined from, the published . 

worko While the importance of flow pattern as determined visually ..is.. 

recognized, the primary subdivision on the basis of pressure drop regime 
is considered more precise and to offer greater possibilities as an air 
to correlation. The flow patterns encountered in the four pressure drop 
regimes are illustrated by diagrams and photographs in Figure 3* 

LOW LIQUID RATES 

Regime I 

As the gas ra,te, at any constant liquid rate, is increased 
from zero to low values (gas-liquid volume ratios Up to 1 - 5 ) the gas is 
dispersed as discrete bubbles which increase steadily in number and size. 

This is the bubble flow pattern and it extends only a short way into

Regime I. With a further increase in gas flow some of the hubbies coalesce 
to form larger bullet shaped slugs. These slugs grow in length and diameter 
and their upward velocity increases as the gas rate is further increased* 

This slug flow pattern is characterized by alternating slugs of gas which 
are surrounded by a thin liquid annulus and interspersed with regions of 
bubble flow* As a slug passes any given tube section some of the liquid 
falls downward into the bubble filled region beneath it. Slug flow continues 
to the end of Regime I and well into Regime II. 

Regime II 

As the gas-liquid volume ratio is still further increased 
the tendency of the liquid phase to fall downwards beneath the. slugs 
decreases and finally stops* At this latter point the slugs seem to merge 
and degenerate into a froth. Froth flow would, seem to appear first at a 
point roughly mid-way in Regime II. This pattern is highly.turbulent with 
coarse agitation of the liquid phase being its most predominant char.acteris¬ 
tic o It extends through the second half of Regime II into Regime III. 

Regime III 

The flow pattern in Regime III is primarily froth. As the 
gas—liquid volume ratio is increased the amount of relative motion be¬ 
tween phases seems to decrease* This phenomenon continues with increasing 
gas rate until a region of ripple flow is entered.. Ripple flow is char¬ 
acterized by an upwards moving wavy or ripply layer of liquid on the tube 
wall. The zone of ripple flow is rather narrow and actually forms a trans¬ 
ition region between Regimes III and IV. 

Regime IV 

The ripple flow pattern continues, a short way into Regime IV 

and then develops into film flow. In this flow pattern the Liquid, flows 

as an annular film and the gas flows at a higher velocity.through.the .inner 

core 0 This flow pattern results from the smoothing, of the. waves or ripples. 

of ripple flow by the attrition of the higher gas. rates. Calvert ...and 

( 

"Williamshave analyzed the film flow pattern from the viewpoint-of the 
actual shearing forces involved. Eventually, at some sufficiently high 
gas rate, a sufficient number of water droplets will be captured from the 











- 12 - 


Liquid. interface to remove the liquid layer and to result in a region of 
mist flow. The occurrence of this zone is obvious but has not been directly 
observed in this work. 

HIGH LIQUID RATES 

The above description of flow patterns does not apply in its entirety 
to higher water rates 0 It will be shown that as the water rate is increased 
Regimes II and III become progressively narrower and finally disappear. At 
these higher water rates the flow pattern of the liquid phase seems much 
the same as at the lower rates but the gas phase pattern changes markedly. 

Atthe close of Regime I the gas phase, as before, is characterized by an 
agitated pattern which extends the entire length of the tube with fast 
moving slugs travelling intermittently through the system. As the gas 
rate increases these slugs become faster moving and more frequent in 
occurrence. Ho froth flow pattern is observed. The amount of turbulence 
present in the liquid phase decreases with increasing gas rates and develops 
directly into a pattern similar to ripple flow. Ripple flow gives way 
to film flow as at the lower water rates. 

EXPERIMENTAL EQUIPMENT 

The experimental equipment is illus.trated schemat.icaily in 

Figure 4° It consisted of an air supply and metering.system,, a. water, supply 

and metering system, the two—phase test section and..a manometer, system for 
measuring pressure drop. 

Air was supplied at approximately 100 psi from a central compressor, 
passed through a reducing valve to maintain a nearly constant downstream 
pressure of about 75 psi and then through an orifice metering station.to 
the base of the test equipment 0 Control was effected manually by a suitable 
valve in the main one inch line and by a needle valve in a quarter inch 
by-pass line. Water was supplied through a 70 gallon per minute capacity 
centrifugal pump having a maximum head of about 110 psi. The water was 
admitted to the base of the equipment through one of four rotameters con¬ 
nected in parallelo These rotameters had maximum capacities of .000272, 
o 00247 ? .0211 and .0219 cu. ft. per sec. thus permitting relatively accurate 
metering of the water over the full range from o 0004 to .0421 cu. ft. per 


sec.

Preliminary tests were conducted with different designs of mixing 
sections at the base of the two-phase flow column. It was found however 
that the design of the mixing section affected the flow pattern only for 
a very short distance above it and that with an adequate calming section 
no special mixing device was required. Accordingly the air and water were 
combined in a simple tee at the base of the test section. 

The test section itself consisted of a transparent section of cell¬ 
ulose acetate-butyrate plastic tubing approximately ..30 ft long and. of 1 inch 
nominal diameter 0 The lower end of the plastic tube was connected... to. the . 
mixing tee with a two foot section of 1 inch galvanized iron pipe containing 
a full flow plug valve. The upper end of the plastic pipe was similarly 
connected to the discharge piping of the system through another full flow 
plug valve. These plug valves operated with a.90° turn of the handle. The 
handles of the two were linked together with .a length of .1 inch aluminum 
angle iron. This permitted the two plug valves to be opened or closed 
simultaneously. Three pressure taps were made in the plastic tube. The 
lower or upstream tap was approximately 8 ft above the mixing chamber and.. 
the upper or downstream tap 22.88 ft above it. The third pressure .tap was 
located midway between the upstream and downstream ones. All presfeure taps 
were made in blocks of Incite, machined to fit around the tube and. sealed 
to it with chloroform. The block and tube were then bored with a 3/l6 
hole which was carefully reamed and the block was counter*-bored and tapped 
for 1/8 inch standard pipe fittings. Connected to the discharge end of the 
test section were an air-water separator which permitted the water to be 
discharged to sewer and a pneumatic control valve (installed in the air 
discharge line from the separator). 

Two 30 inch Meriam manometers, one filled with water, the other 
with mercury, were provided for measuring the pressure drop across the air 
metering orificies. A 60 inch mercury manometer and a 0 to 50 psig record¬ 
ing Brown pressure controller were connected in parallel to the mid¬ 
point pressure tap of the test section. This connection was made through 
a small plastic separator directly connected to the mid-point pressure 
tap 0 This separator enabled the operator to keep the pressure lead line 
to the manometer and the Brown instrument clear of water by periodic drain¬ 
ing from its base. The pressure controller actuated the pneumatic valve in 
the air discharge line from the main separator at the outlet end of the 
















-14- 


test section. Two 60 inch Meriam manometers were provided for the measure¬ 
ment of the pressure drop between the upstream and the downstream pressure 
taps. One of these manometers was filled with water, the other with mercury. 
They were connected in parallel through plastic separators directly connected 
to the pressure taps. 

Thermometers were provided for measuring the inlet temperatures 
of the water and the air and the outlet temperature of the two-phase 
mixture. T^e orifice plates used for measuring the air rates, were each 
calibrated with the aid of a critical flow prover. The calibrations were 
checked one against another for consistency between plates. The four 
rotameters used for measuring water flow were calibrated by a direct weigh¬ 
ing technique. 

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE 

The tests reported here were all carried out at the same mid¬ 
point test section pressure of 3 6 psia. This pressure was controlled to 
within 0.1 or 0.2 psia by the Brown pressure controller. Extensive tests 
were made at each of the nine water rates. The test procedure was essent¬ 
ially the same in each case. 

A test was started by opening the two plug valves on the test 
section, closing all pressure tap connections and introducing water at a 
desired rate through the appropriate rotameter to the base of the test 
section. With this rate set a small flow of air was started through an 
appropriate sized orifice to the base of the column. The mid-point pressure 
tap was the opened. The two-phase mixture discharging from the top of the 
test section was separated in the separator with pressure control on the 
entire system being maintained by the Brown instrument and the pneumatic 
valve handling the air discharge from the separator. With steady state 
conditions reached the upstream and downstream pressure taps were opened, 
the small separators flushed to give an indication of the pressure drop on 
one of the two 60 inch manometers. After conditions appeared completely 
stabilized, readings were taken of the water flow rate, the air flow rate 
and the pressure drop. A check reading of the mid-point pressure was taken 
on the Meriam manometer in parallel with the Brown instrument. Following 
this the upstream and downstream pressure taps were closed and the connecting 
link joining the two plug valves was operated rapidly to close both valves 
simultaneously and trap the flowing mixture in the test section. Some time 






















- 15 - 


was allowed for the mixture to settle out and then the relative volumes of 
water and air confined between the two plug valves were observed with the 
aid of a calibrated scale. Following this conditions were adjusted to 
successively higher air rates at the constant water rate. Careful visual 
observations were made of the flow pattern for each test and several series 
of photographs were taken. 

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 

The basic experimental data are tabulated in Table 1 (Partial) for 
the lowest, the highest and one of the intermediate water rates# (The 
complete tabular data including those of the other six water rates is given 

in Table 1 of material deposited as Document No. _ with the American 

Documentation Institute Photo Duplication Service, Library of Congress, 
Washington 25, D.C.)o 

Referring to Table 1, Column 2 gives the water rate in cubic feet 
per second of liquid saturated gas-phase at the mid-point temperature given 
by Column 4- and the constant mid-point pressure of 36.0 psia. These 
rates were calculated from the actual measured air rates to correct for the 
saturation of the air with water which took place in the calming section# 
Column 5 presents the ratio of the air to water rates, both on a volume and 
on a mass basis. Column 6 gives the ratio of air to water trapped in the 
test section at the completion of each test. Column 7 gives the specific 
volume of the saturated gas—phase at mid—point test section conditions. 
Column 8 presents the holdup ratio, being the ratio of the discharge air- 
water volume ratio to the test section air—water volume ratio i.e. of 
Column 5 Column 6o Column 9 is ik® total pressure drop between the 
upstream and downstream pressure measuring stations, expressed in terms of 
feet of water per foot of height. Column 10 presents the ratio of the 
specific volumes of the liquid—phase to the saturated gas—phase at average 
test section pressure and temperature. Column 11 identifies the pressure 
drop regime and Column 12 the flow pattern. 

The basic data are summarized for each of the constant water rates 
in Figure 5 through 13« These figures show by separate curyes (a) the 
relationship between unit pressure drop and the air-water volume ratio at 
test conditions and (b) the relationship between holdup ratio and air-water

volume ratio at test conditions® The different constant water rates for 
each of the figures is represented by the superficial water velocity, V • 

The existence of the four pressure drop regimes and the two minima points 
in the pressure drop curves is clearly indicated in Figures 5 through 9 
covering superficial water velocities from O.O 698 to 2.06 feet per second 
and at least perceptible at the rate of Figure 10. The data for the higher 
water rates shown in Figures 11 to 13 indicate a mergence of the maximum 
point in the pressure drop curve with the second minimu© point„ This mer¬ 
gence is reflected by the inflection point of Figure 11 and results in the 
disappearance of pressure drop regimes II and III at a superficial water 
velocity of about 3*5 feet per second. 

The interrelationship between the holdup curves and the pressure 
drop curves is to be noted. In each instance the holdup curve exhibits a 
region of inflection about in the middle of pressure drop regime I and a 
very abrupt change of slope at about the end of pressure drop regime II. 

It is also to be noted that the holdup curve is nearly linear from about the 
middle of regime I to the end of regime II. At low water rates the holdup 
curve has a slight negative slope through pressure drop regime IIIo This 
slope gradually increases until, at a superficial lineal velocity of near 
0.6 feet per second, the slope becomes zero. With increasing water rates 
the slope of the holdup curves in regime III increases further in a positive 
sense. 

The loci of the two minima and the maximum points in the pressure 
drop curves of Figures 5-13 are plotted in Figures 14 and 15* Figure 14 
shows the loci as functions of the unit pressure drop and the superficial 
water velocity. The convergence of the loci corresponding with the maximum 
and the second minimum at a superficial water velocity of about 3*5 feet per 
second is again evident. Figure 15 which shows the loci as functions of 
superficial water velocity and air—water volume ratio (under flow conditions) 
is perhaps more revealing and certainly more useful from the yiewpoint of 
delineating the various pressure drop regimes and flow patterns. The 
locus of the first pressure drop minimum, which is the boundary between 
regimes I and II,,is seen to be a straight line on logarithmic paper of 
slope equal to -1.17° The locus of the maximum point is more or less 
parallel to this and displaced toward higher air-water volume ratios. The 



-17- 


locus of the second minimum point is again not too far from being parallel 
to that of the first minimum and the maximum points but is displaced 
further toward higher air-water volume ratios. The maximum locus begins to 
approach that of the second minimum at superficial water velocities above 
about 1 feet per second and merges with it at the velocity of about 3»5 feet 
per secondo Thus above a water rate of 3*5 fto per sec 0 regime IJT does 
not exist and regime II becomes continuous with regime IY« 

The loci of the points of inflection on the holdup curves and of 
the points of abrupt change of slope are seen also to be roughly parallel 
to the pressure drop minima and maximum loci. The approximate boundaries 
between bubble and slug flow and between slug and froth flow, froth and 
wave entrainment flow and wave entrainment and annular flow are shown as 
dashed, lines. These lines have been located on the basis of visual obser¬ 
vations during the tests. 

INTERPRETATION' OP RESULTS 


A considerable amount of time has been devoted to an interpretation 
of the pressure- d.rop results. In the light of the fluid flow thermodynamics 
presented earlier the total pressure drop was, by calculation, separated 
into its two components - the hydrostatic head and the irreversibility 
component. The relationship between these two components and the total 
pressure drop, all in feet of water per foot, is indicated in Figure 16 
for the superficial water velocity corresponding with Figure 10, namely 
Oo873 feet per second. The components bare a similar relationship to the 
total at the other water flow rates. Both the friction factors, f and 

t 

f , were calculated for all of the test data and plots of these were made 

G 

vs the air-water volume ratios at each of the nine constant water rates. 

Both sets of plots yielded surprisingly smooth curves. (Complete numerical 
values of the components and the two friction factors are given in Table 2 

of the material deposited as Document No. ___ with the American 

Documentation Institute Photo Duplication Service, Library of Congress, 
Washington 25 , D.C.) 

t 

Typical curves of f versus the air-water volume ratio at the 
-L 

lowest, the highest and an intermediate water velocity are given for ill¬ 
ustrative purposes in Figure 17* Figure 18 was prepared from the set of 













-18- 


these curves representing all nine water rates* This is a logarithmic plot 

i 

of f versus the superficial water velocity showing lines of constant air- 

li 

water volume ratio* For reference purposes the conventional friction factor 
is also plotted against water velocity for single phase water flow* The 
friction factor lines representing the two-phase flow condition are seen 
to lie well above and to the right of the single-phase lines. At the 
lowest gas-liquid ratios the iwo-phase lines appear to be approaching the 
single-phase line but at the highest water velocities fall below the 
single-phase line representing turbulent water flow. Clearly more data are 
required at lower R^. ratios to determine the manner in which the two- 
phase lines blend into the single—phase lines. 

The loci of the pressure drop minima and maximum points are also 
plotted in Figure 18? the points on each R^ curve being taken from Figure 
15° The smooth curve loci resulting in Figure 18 attest the the consistency 
of the data for the derived f values are sensitive to minor errors in the 

JL 

total measured pressure drop. 

Figure 19 showing the holdup ratio as functions of air-water 
volume ratio and superficial water velocity was prepared from the holdup 
curves of* Figures 5 "to 13 inclusive. Again the minima and maximum pressure 
drop loci are superimposedo The relationship between these loci and the 
minima and maxima in the family of holdup curves is apparent. 

CONCLUSIONS' 

The correlation of Equations 10 and 13 and Figures 15> 18 and 19 
enable the prediction of the flow pattern, the pressure drop and the 
holdup as functions of the air and water rates for the upwards vertical 
flow of air-water mixtures at an average pressure of 36*0 psia in smooth 
tubes of approximately 1 inch diameter. 

These correlations apply only to a system in which the average 
pressure is 36 .0 psia and over which the fractional change in specific 
volume of the water saturated air is small enough to justify the use of an 
average value. Experimental work now nearly completed and to be reported 
shortly has been undertaken to extend the application of the correlation 
to other diameters and other average pressures (or average gas phase 
densities)o With the effect of gas phase density known, integration or 



-19- 


step-wise use of the correlation will permit its application to systems 
wherein there is a large change in gas phase specific volume.
