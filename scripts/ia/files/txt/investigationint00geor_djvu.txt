SYNOPSIS 


This study seeks to investigate the relationship of 
reading ability to achievement in the content fields. In 
particular, it attempts to show how the reading ability of 
the Alberta Grade IX students was related to their success 
in the final examinations of June, 1950, in literature and 
in general science and health education. Its primary pur¬ 
pose is to determine whether reading ability may be con¬ 
sidered to be an important factor in the academic achieve¬ 
ment of Grade IX students; its secondary purpose is to see 
whether mental ability and vocabulary have something to do 
with the relationship. 

The findings show that the results of the reading 
test were positively and rather highly correlated with the 
results in literature and that the correlation of the read¬ 
ing scores with the marks in general science and health 
education was lower, yet positive and substantial. As far 
as the group of students was concerned, good mental ability 
and good vocabulary were.at least concomitant with success 
in literature and in general science and health education. 
The study is not adequate to permit the statement that 
vocabulary training would produce much of the success that 
appeared to come from reading ability; it only suggests 
that knowledge of vocabulary may be a partial cause of the 
relationship.

CHAPTER I 


PURPOSES OF THIS STUDY 

Reading is now recognized as one of the most 
important skills developed in the schools. Indicative 
of this recognition is the large number of studies in 
reading. However, findings and opinions differ, and it 
is certain that the research is far from being complete. 

Reading ability appears to be related to achievement 
in many of the content fields, but the degree of correlation 
and the influence of common elements in the relationships 
are not yet clearly defined. This study examines new data 
in an attempt to gain a better understanding of how 
important reading is to students 1 success in other subjects. 
Specifically the problem is to answer these questions: 

1. To what extent were the scores in reading correlated 
with the scores in literature and in general science and 
health education in the final examinations of Grade IX 
students in Alberta schools in June, 1950? 

2, How would these relationships be affected by holding 
mental ability and vocabulary constant?

CHAPTER II 


LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY 

The main limitation of the study is the validity of 
the tests used. Lindquist"*" says, "The true validity of an 
educational or psychological test must always remain a 
hypothetical concept since there is never available an 
infallible criterion measure against which the fallible 
obtained measures may be evaluated." However, the examinations 
in reading, in literature, and in general science and health 
education were set by individuals considered by the 
Examinations Board of the Department of Education to be 
competent in this work. Davis points out that the opinion 
of experts is an important check on validity and that 
statistical considerations alone are not enough in test 
construction. The Alberta test in reading not only had the 
approval of the Examinations Board, but it was checked in 
this study by comparison and by statistical analysis and 
found to be reasonably valid. The test of mental ability^ 
is one widely used as a group test, and it is reported to 
compare favorably with other accepted tests of intelligence. 
That the examinations in literature and in general science

and health education were satisfactory measures of 
achievement is an assumption that rests on opinion alone* 

A second limitation of the study comes from the 
procedures which it employs. The correlations of reading 
with achievement in literature and of reading with 
achievement in general science and health education 
indicate not only that there is a relationship, but they 
are also measures of it* Partial correlations, on the other 
hand, are more difficult to interpret* They may be useful 
in analyzing the relationships in a set of related variables,^ 
but they must be used cautiously. They may reveal factors 
that are common to the related variates, but these factors 
are not necessarily the cause of the relationship. In this 
study the check on the partial correlations is a series 
of zero-order correlations worked on small groups in which 
the third variables - mental ability and vocabulary - are 
held within the range of a few points, but not with exact 
constancy* Consequently, the third variable remains a 
factor, even if it is a limited one, and holding this 
variable about one point on the scale that measures it does 
not give a result that is accurately representative of the 
relationship that might exist if the third variable were 
held at another point. In other words, the correlation 
between marks in reading and marks in science for students

of average mental ability would not necessarily be the 
same as it would be for students of superior mental ability. 

Yet probably one good feature of the procedures is that 
they are comparatively simple, and their results are readily 
translated into terms understood by persons with limited 
knowledge of statistics. 

A third limitation of the investigation is that 
its findings pertain to the group, not to the individual. 

The correlations discovered in it may be a satisfactory 
indication of the relationship between the reading ability 
of a large group of Grade IX students and their achievement 
in literature and in science, and one may expect that, when 
the correlation is positive and substantial, the achievement 
of the good readers will be better than the achievement of 
the poor readers in these subjects. However, what applies 
to the group does not necessarily apply to the individual. 

In fact, the smaller the group, the more careful one must 
be in applying to it a generalization based on the correlations 
discovered in this study. 

Another limitation of minor importance is the degree 
of accuracy obtained by the procedures used in calculating 
the coefficients of correlation. Most of the calculations 
are correct to two places of decimals, after the practice 
of Lindquist on his sample correlation chart.5 Because of 
of the grouping there may be small discrepancies between 

^E. F. Lindquist, op . cit ,, addenda.

the results from correlation charts and those that would 
come from the ungrouped-data techniques. However, this 
study cannot pretend to discover the final degree of 
correlation. In view of the invalidities and unreliabilities 
that persist in educational and psychological tests it 
would be unrealistic to claim that the correlations 
between reading and literature and between reading and 
science scores would always be exactly the same as those 
discovered here. 



CHAPTER III 


A REVIEW OF LITERATURE RELATED TO THIS STUDY 

The number of studies that have to do with reading 
in the content fields is very large* The study most 
pertinent to this thesis is that of Dr* H. T. Coutts*^ 

Examining the results of the Grade IX examinations of 1949, 
he found that achievement in the content fields of 
literature, mathematics, science, and social studies was 
significantly related to reading ability. He concluded 
that there was a general reading factor common to all 
these content fields and that there were also reading 
abilities specific to them. Of particular interest is his 
finding that general content vocabulary was the only element 
of reading common to successful achievement in the content 
fields mentioned above. Reading, however, was not the only 
factor entering into the relationship. Sex differences and 
the size and nature of the school organization were also 
related to the scores made by the students on their 
examination papers. 

Two Alberta studies, completed about the same time 
as that of Coutts,report somewhat different conclusions.

W. E. Hodgson found that the reading comprehension of the 
students in the Temporary-License Glass of the Faculty of 
Education, University of Alberta, was a poor predictor of 

their academic averages in the teacher-training course. 

3 

James M. Craig in an investigation into the relationship 
between reading ability and knowledge of basic concepts 
in social studies of students in the Junior Elementary and 
Intermediate Program of the Faculty of Education, 1949-50, 
found the correlation to be low. His finding differs from 
Artley T s^ discovery of a coefficient of .79 between reading 
comprehension in soc i al s tudies and general reading 
comprehension. 

Undoubtedly explanations of the apparent differences 
in the conclusions of these studies could be made, but here 
attention is drawn to them only to show that the last word 
on the relationship between reading ability and academic 
success has not been said. A need for careful evaluation 
and interpretation of previous studies remains, and there 
is room for further investigation.

Some of the difficulty lies in the definition of 

just what constitutes reading ability.* Burkart,^ from the 

opinions of one hundred and nine reading specialists, 

concludes that reading is a complex activity composed of 

at least two hundred and fourteen separate abilities. 

Strang states that there is no unmistakable evidence 

7 

of a general silent reading ability. Shores/ from a study 
of Grade IX students* ability to read science and history, 
believes that the results of his investigation offer rather 
conclusive evidence in refutation of the concept of a 
general reading ability in the ninth grade. Leary and Gray^ 

9 

consider reading to be a composite of many abilities. Yoakam 
and Gates'^ regard reading as a very complex mental process.

Yet Buswell says clearly: 

Psychologically reading is not a complicated 
situation. It is simply a process of interpreting 
a certain kind of visual experience in which 
conventional symbols on a printed page are substituted 
for the common objects in the environment. The 
interpretation depends on a broad understanding of 
the field. 

After a person has mastered the process of 
reading in those fields common to all people, nothing 
is gained by applying the term "learning to read" 
to the mastery of a new field. Mastering a new field 
is not learning to read; it is learning a new subject. ^ 

But whether reading in a content field requires a 

particular reading skill or simply a background of suitable 

experience, there are studies to show that in some way or 

other reading is related to achievement in the content 
12 

fields. Eva Bond found that reading ability was definitely 
related to achievement in ninth-grade English and general 
science. She suggested that reading abilities as measured 
by standardized tests were more highly related to achievement 
in literary areas than to achievement in other subject- 
matter areas because children were taught to do the literary 
type of reading, which was less efficient in the other 
content fields.”' Swenson, f working with Grade VIII students,

discovered that the upper group in scores on a science 
reading test were definitely superior in total scores 
on the Traxler tests of reading. She eliminated the 
factors of intelligence and age by matching the students. 

Shores J found, by examining Grade IX students, that the 
ability to read science was significantly related to the 
total score in silent-reading comprehension as measured 
by the Iowa Every-Pupil Tests of Basic Skills. Aukerman^ 
discovered that, when students of the eleventh grade were 
matched in intelligence, sex, color, age, half-grade, subject, 
hour of recitation, and teacher, there were still significant 
differences between the reading abilities of the good 
and the poor students in English, history, chemistry, and 
mathematics. 

Gray, in his annual summaries published each 
February in the Journal of Educational Research , reports 
a number of investigations that show how reading is related 
to achievement in the content fields. In one study Anderson 
and Dearborn - ^ found that there was a positive relationship 
between reading ability and college achievement of sixty- 
eight freshman, even when intelligence was not a factor.

Humber discovered that, at the university level, scores 

on reading tests were more closely related to achievement 

in the humanities group than to achievement in those 

curricula emphasizing science. Townsend-*- 9 found a 

substantial relationship between the reading ability 

and the scholastic achievement of pupils of Grades IV 

and VI in all subjects tested, except arithmetic. In a 

second study of both elementary and high-school children 

she found a substantial positive correlation between 

20 

reading and academic aptitude. Traxler also found a 
substantial relationship between reading ability and 
scholastic achievement of high-school students, but the 
correlations were lower than those for the younger 
children of Townsend T s study. Traxler thought that the 
increasing number of factors entering into achievement 
in the higher grades might explain the difference. 

Most of this evidence shows that ability in 
reading is either instrumental in the academic 
achievement of students or concomitant with it. As 
Strang * 2 ^- says, the relationship is positive, but not

invariably close. Correlations between scores on reading 

tests and various measures of scholarship range from those 

of comparative insignificance (such as those noted in the 

studies of Hodgson and Craig) to ones as high as .70 or 
22 

better. Strang reports that such correlations usually 
lie between .30 and .50. The degree of correlation depends 
greatly on the nature of the tests used, not only in rating 
scholastic achievement, but also in determining reading 
ability. 

The validity of the tests used in measuring ability 

and achievement obviously has an important bearing on 

23 

the results. Shores J feels that the reading tests for the 
intermediate grades and above should measure with materials 
chosen from a variety of content fields. If general reading 
ability is only a composite of specific reading skills, 
then one can understand why correlations are higher when 
the results of special reading tests, based on material 
from a specific subject field, rather than the results 
of Tt general reading” tests, are compared with academic 
grades in that subject field. h The nature of the tests 
used may account in large measure for the difference 
between the findings of Craig and Artley.

Triggs 2 ^ states that in general a test should use 
the sort of material that students meet in their course 
work, if the scores are to be a valid indication of how 
the students read in a normal study situation. She also 
notes the high correlation between results on some read¬ 
ing tests and scholastic aptitude tests, and asks, n Do 
these two types of tests measure different things or do 
they both measure merely a verbal skill which, according 
to Thurstone, is only one phase of mental ability? What 
is the relationship of this verbal skill to success in 
the educational curriculum? n2 

Intelligence and reading ability appear to be 

27 

very closely associated. Dolch says that the degree 
of intelligence is the strongest single factor in the 
child T s success in reading. Strang says that the 
coefficients of correlation between reading-test scores 
and scores on group tests of mental ability are usually 
above .50. She reports findings by Gray and by Monroe 
that show relationships of this order. 2 ^ She also suggests

of both intelligence-test scores and reading-test scores.30 

Abbott^l found that an increase in the silent-reading 

ability of Grade IX students was accompanied by a 

significant increase in I. Q. as measured by the Kuhlmann 
32 

test. McCulloughr warns that, because of the influence 
of intelligence on reading ability and on achievement 
in school subjects, it is desirable to obtain the correlations 
by procedures that hold intelligence constant. TT Partialling 
out” mental ability is a method of holding this factor 
constant when comparing reading ability with achievement 
in literature and in science. However, it is well to 
remember Strang T s warning that it is more important to 
know how the student T s intelligence functions in reading 
than to try to separate.intelligence from reading ability. 

She says that intelligence and reading ability on the high- 
school level appear to be 7T inextricablv associated. ”33 
Vocabulary is a fair indication of academic 
aptitude, if not a perfectly reliable one,^ &nd a good

vocabulary is second only to word recognition in basic 
importance for good reading.^ Gray^ tells that Good- 
enough secured a coefficient of correlation of .79 
between ability to understand and explain meanings of 
words and reading achievement. It is not surprising 
that Coutts ' found knowledge of general vocabulary 
to be the only factor common to successful achievement 
in the four fields of literature, mathematics, science, 
and social studies when the effects of mental age and of 
chronological age were held constant. In comparing the 
scores on reading tests with scores on achievement tests 
it would be well to consider the effect of vocabulary 
as well as that of mental ability in establishing the 
correlations. As with mental ability, however, it must 
be remembered that vocabulary is an essential part of 
reading. 

Partial correlations are a simple method of 
eliminating factors by means of formulas, but statisticians 
have noted certain dangers in the interpretation of 
results secured in this way. Garrett,Lindquist ,^

Odell, and Burks are four who issue warnings. Partial 
coefficients of correlation are based on the assumption 
that the zero-order coefficients have come from data in 
which the regression is linear. The validity of the test 
that measures a factor T! partialled out ?t may be doubtful. 

Another danger is that fT partialling out TT the scores obtained 
from one of the tests may hold constant factors that are 
essentially part of the abilities measured by the other 
tests. In other words, the process may hold constant more 
than it should. Another difficulty of interpretation is 
that the factors eliminated by partial correlation may 
be causes or they may be only features in common without 
causal relationship. However, although the use of partial 
correlations has limitations, it may also be valuable in 
analyzing the relationships in a set of correlated variables. 42

CHAPTER IV 


SOURCES OF THE DATA AND DESCRIPTIONS OF THE TESTS 

The three hundred and fifty-five sets of papers that 
were the main source of data for this study were drawn."by 
the use of random numbers* from the examinations written 
by close to ten thousand Grade IX students in Alberta in 
June, 1950. Consequently, the results of the tests are 
representative of the work of both boys and girls attend¬ 
ing small rural schools, village schools, consolidated 
schools, centralized divisional schools, and large urban 
schools. The scores on the mental-ability tests show that 
almost every level of intelligence of Grade IX students 
was represented. 

The results of the Iowa Tests of Educational Develop¬ 
ment were obtained from Dr. Coutts, who had given these 
tests to Grade IX students in Wainwright, Vegreville, and 
the University Junior High Schools shortly before the final 
examinations of the Department of Education. The answer 
sheets completed by these students for the Department’s 
test in silent reading were obtained from the Examinations 
Branch. 

With- the exception of the Iowa Tests used to check 
the validity of the Alberta test in silent reading, all

tests were those prescribed by the High School Entrance 
Examination Board of the Department of Education and 
written by Grade IX students throughout the Province 
at the end of June, 1950. 

1. The Hen mon-Nelson Tests of Men tal Ability,^ Form A, 
were used to measure mental ability. Raw scores, not 
mental ages, were used in calculating coefficients of 
correlation.

standardization of these tests seem as satisfactory as 

those of the better group tests of intelligence, but not

strikingly more so. rT 

2. The Al berta Literature Test'‘was Part I of the English 
examination set by the High School Entrance Examination 
Board for 1950* Its administration time was one hour. All 
work of the student was done in a question booklet. The 
total value of the items was seventy-seven. 

It was assumed that the test in literature was a 
valid measure of the achievement of the Grade IX students 
in that subject. The programme of studies used in 1949-50 
divided the course into two parts: intensive literature 
or the study of selections from the authorized reader,

comprising individual reading and free reading. Questions 
3 and 4 of the test, together worth seventeen points, dealt 
with selections from the rea.der and with the students 1 
individual reading of books listed in the programme.^ The 
remainder of the examination, scored sixty points, was 
based on ?t sight n selections, and was designed to test the

student s T ability to comprehend and to appreciate these 
selections. The test, therefore, was set in conformity 
with the regulations governing the Grade IX examination 
in literature,^ and it had the approval of the Examination 
Board. Under these circumstances it is probably safe to 
assume that the scores on the test were a reasonably 
satisfactory measure of the Grade IX students f achievement 
in the 1949-50 course in literature. 

The reliability of the test in literature by the 
split-halves technique and the Spearman-Brown formula was 
found to be .36. 

3. The Alberta Test in General Scien ce an d Health Education* 
was also set by the High School Entrance Examination Board 
for 1950. The time allowed for the test was two and one-half 
hours. There were three sections: 

Section A - 50 questions of the multiple-choice type, 
answered on a sheet for machine-scoring and covering a range 
of science and health facts; 

Section B - 56 questions of the multiple-choice type, 
answeredon the same sheet as Section A and requiring the 
student to select the idea or ideas related to sets of 
observations; 

Section C - 56 points on a variety of questions, 
scored from an objective key. 

It was assumed that the scores on this test were a 
valid measure of the students 1 achievement in general science

and health education. The Grade II course in general science, 
the 

outlined inAprogramme of studies for 1949-50, covered 
environment, air and its work, water and its work, heat and 
its work, light and its work, a study of industry, work of 
solar energy and its relation to living things, and safe¬ 
guarding and improving the life of the individual and 
community. The subject content of the examination was 
within the limits of this broad outline. The outline for 
health education was suggestive only, but it was not 
unreasonable to expect a Grade IX student, after his work 
in Grades VII, VIII, and IX, to be familiar with the material 
on which the health-education items of the final test were 
based. The examination covered a wide range of general- 
science and health material on a level that should have been 
reached by Grade IX students, it was approved by the 
Examination Board, and, consequently, the assumption that it 
had satisfactory validity appears to be justified. 

The reliability of the test by the split-halves 

technique and the Spearman-Brown formula was found to be .94.

of the Wainwright, Vegreville, and University Junior High 
Schools, were used to check the validity of the Alberta test

The following tests of the series were used:- 

Test 4 , Quantitative Thinking - 53 items, 65 minutes. 

Of this test Henry Chauncey, President of the 

Educational Testing Service, Princeton, N, J., says, 

"The problem settings are realistic, and the quality of

the items is good*"' 

Test 5 , Ability to Interpret Reading Materials in Social 
Studies - SO items, 60 min. 

Test 6, Interpretation of Natural Sciences - Si items, 

60 min. 

Chauncey says, "The passages, though individually 

good, are too largely drawn from the biological as opposed 

S 

to the physical sciences." 

Test 7, Interpretation - Literature - SO items, 50 min. 

Chauncey says of this section, "The questions are

good, calling for real literary interpretation." 

Test S, General Vocabulary - 75 items, 22 min.

5. The Alberta Readi n g Test, Grade IX,_ 1950** 

It was in booklet form with a machine-scored answer 

sheet. There were four parts: 

Part I - Literary material; 

Part II- Mathematical material; 

Part III - Scientific material; 

Part IV - Social-studies material.. 

Because it is essential to this study that the reading 

scores be a reasonably valid measure of reading ability, 

considerable care has been taken to check the validity of the 

reading test. The correlations between parts of the Alberta 

test in reading and the corresponding tests of the Iowa series 

are given in the following table. All of the coefficients are 

significant at the .01 level.

These substantial coefficients of correlation 
between the Alberta Reading Test and the Iowa Tests 
indicate that there is little reason to doubt the 
validity of the Alberta Test, particularly as far as 
vocabulary scores and total scores are concerned. However, 
because the validity of the criterion test is probably also 
imperfect, the validity of the test compared with it cannot 
be assessed with absolute accuracy in this way. Consequently, 
a second check by statistical consideration of the items 
was made on the Alberta Reading Test. 

When the Davis item-analysis method* was applied 
to check the validity of the Alberta Reading Test it was 
found that only five items had discrimination indices 
below 20. (Items with indices above 20 are considered by 
Davis to be satisfactory.) One of the five, Item 3$, had 
a discrimination index of plus 2. Both high and low groups 
found this item very difficult, probably because the dates 
in the test were not in chronological order. As its 
difficulty index of minus 30 indicates, the Item was at 
fault in being too difficult for all students. Item 6$ 
had a Davis discrimination index of minus 7, but on 
Flanagan T s^ chart the index was very slightly positive. 

The fact that economy increased as cost decreased apparently 
was overlooked by the students. On both Items 3$ and 6$

the highest 2of the stuaents haa more “rights** than 
the. lowest 27 %• It Is safe to say that,, if these two items 
added nothing to the validity of the test, they hardly 
detracted from. it. The indices of discrimination and of 
difficulty for all items are given in Table II, page 26. 

It is evident from these figures that the validity of the 
test as a whole was quite satisfactory, according to the 
Davis formula. 

The reliability of the Alberta Reading Test was 
found by using the split-hadves technique and the 
Spearman-Brown formula. The coefficient obtained in this 
way was . 92 .

PROCEDURE FOLLOWED IN THIS STUDY 

1, S election of data. 

The random numbers used in the selection of sets of 
examination papers came from Stati stical Tables for 
Biol ogical, Agric ultural, and Medical Research^ by Fisher 
and Yates. The Examinations Branch of the Department of 
Education matched these numbers with the numbers given to 
the sets of papers written by the candidates in the Grade IX 
examinations of June, 1950. Three hundred and fifty-five 
sets of papers were made available on this basis. They were 
the random sample that represented in this study the results 
of the Grade IX examinations throughout the Province. The 
sets of papers written by the Grade IX students of Wainwright, 
Vegreville, and University Junior High Schools in the June 
examinations were also received from the Examinations Branch 
so that their scores on the Alberta Reading Test might be 
compared with the students 1 scores on the Iowa Tests of 
Educational Development. 

2, Record ing the data. 

Raw scores made by the three hundred and fifty-five 
candidates on the following tests were recorded: 

Alberta Reading Test, including each of its parts 
and the vocabulary sections; 

Alberta Literature Test;

Alberta Test in General Science and Health Education; 

Henmon-Nelson Test of Mental Ability, Form A. 

The first hundred random numbers of the three 
hundred and fifty-five from Fisher and Yates were used to 
select a random sample of one hundred sets of papers. The 
hundred papers in each of reading, literature, and general 
science and health education were scored on their comparable 
halves, and the results were recorded for use in calculating 
the reliability coefficients. 

The scores on the Alberta Heading Test made by the 
students of Wainwright, Vegreville, and University Junior 
High Schools along with the scores made by these students 
earlier in June on Tests 4 to 8 of the Iowa Tests of 
Educational Development were recorded separately for use 
in checking the validity of the Alberta Heading Test. 

3. Finding reliabilities . 

The split-halves technique was used in finding 
the reliabilities of the Alberta tests. Although Cronbach 2 
believes that every test should be split at least two ways, 
Head^ found that the differences between reliability 
coefficients obtained by various methods of selecting the 
chance halves were small. In this study an attempt was 
made to have comparable halves, but the tests were split 
in one way only.

In the reading and in the literature tests the items 
were alternately thrown to the left and to the right to give 
the halves. In the test of science and health education the 
split was arranged to distribute evenly the possible marks 
on health. 

The Spearman-Brown formula was used:

correlation of one-half with the other. 

4. T esting the validity of the Alberta Reading Test. 

(a) By correlation with the Iowa Tests of Educational 
Development. 

The coefficients of correlation obtained in this 
check on validity are given in Table I, page 23. They were 
calculated by using the formula for ungrouped data, which 
is given in Section 5 of this chapter. The scores on Test 4 
(mathematical material) of the Iowa series were not available 
for the students of the University Junior High School. 

(b) By use of the Davis^ item-analysis technique. 

An index of discrimination for each item is read

from the Davis item-analysis chart once the values for

R z, the number of testees in the highest 27% of the sample 
who answered the item correctly. 

W - the number of testees in the highest 27% of the sample 
who answered the item incorrectly. 

NRg = the number of testees in the highest 27 % of the sample 
who did not reach the item in the time limit. 

P T % proportion of successes in lowest 27% of the sample,

who answered the item incorrectly. 

NR^-the number of testees in the lowest 27 % of the sample 
who did not reach the item in the time limit. 

K z the number of choices in the item. 

Briefly the Davis method is based on the idea that 
an item has discrimination, if the high-scoring group on

the total test are predominantly correct in their answers 
of the item, while the low-scoring group T s answers are 
predominantly incorrect. The item has no discrimination, 
if equal proportions of the two groups answer it correctly. 
If the low-scoring group answers more correctly than the 
high-scoring group, then the item is negative in its 
discrimination. In other words, the discriminatory power 
of an item is checked by comparison with the results of 
the whole test. 

Davis introduces certain refinements of this basic 
idea. Following Kelley’s lead, he uses the highest 27$ and 
the lowest 27$ of the sample for his two groups. He corrects 
for chance answers in multiple-choice items by using 
R - in the numerator of his formula, and he takes 

into consideration the items not reached in the time limit 
by using N - NR in the denominator. The terms in these 
two corrections have been explained in the first part of 
this sub-section where the main formulas are given. 

The Davis discrimination index for each item of 
the Alberta Reading Test is given in Table II, page 26. 

The higher the index, the better is the discriminatory power 
of the item. The indices of difficulty given in the same 
table indicate in the reverse order of the numbers the 
relative difficulty of the items. In other words, the lower 
the index of difficulty, the more difficult is the item.

5. Finding the correlations. 

The Pearson coefficient of correlation was found 
in two ways: - 

(a) The formula^ for ungrouped data was used in calculating 
these relationships; 

Correlations between the tests of the Iowa series 
and the corresponding parts of the Alberta Reading Test; 

Correlations between the Alberta Reading Test and 
each of the Alberta Literature Test and the Alberta Test 
of General Science and Health Education; 

Correlations between halves of tests for which 
reliability coefficients were sought* 

The formula follows;

Yc 2 "- {tx) 2 J ji - (£y) :

A Remington Calculating Machine was used with this 
formula* 

(b) For all other correlations of zero order the Lindquist 
Correlation Chart was used* 

The standard error of the coefficient was found 
in all instances by use of the formula^;

was used when two factors, (3) and (4) ,were to be held 
constant. 


In 7T partialli.ng out n vocabulary the total scores 
on the vocabulary sections of the Alberta Reading Test 
were taken as the measure of vocabulary. The scores used 
to measure reading ability in this part of the procedure 
did not include the vocabulary scores. In other words, 
the vocabulary sections of the four parts of the Alberta 
Reading Test were used as a test distinct from the remainder 
Of the reading test. 


7. The significance of the correlations . 

The significance of the coefficients of correlation, 

9 

including partial coefficients, was checked by reference 
to Table 49, page 299, of Garrett T s Statistics in Psychology 
and Education . This method is the equivalent of using the

For zero-order coefficients the degrees of freedom are 
N - 2. For partial coefficients of correlation the degrees 
of freedom are N - m , where N equals the number of cases 
and m equals the number of variables entering into the 
correlation. 11 An adaptation of Table 49 to meet the 
needs of this study follows. Values of r significant at 
the .05 level and the .01 level for degrees of freedom 
42, 4 $, 66, 69 , 92, 351, 352 , and 353 are interpolated.

show linear or approximately linear relationship. 12 

Non-linearity, if it were present, would make the 

correlation coefficients an underestimation of the 

13 

strength of the relationships. Because there was little 
reason to doubt the linearity of regression in the 
relationships of primary importance in this study, 
no mathematical test of linearity was used.

CHAPTER VI 


RESULTS OF THE STUDY 

1. Scores on the Alberta Reading Test and on the examinations 
in literature and in science and health education were 
positively and significantly correlated. 

The coefficient of correlation between reading and 

literature was .79* The standard error of the coefficient 

was i ,020. Corrected for attenuation the coefficient was .#9* 

In terms of verbal description this correlation was high.l 

The coefficient of correlation between the scores 

on the Alberta Reading Test and the scores on the examination 

in general science and health education was , 67 . The standard 

error of this coefficient was .029* Corrected for 

attenuation the coefficient was ,72. These figures indicate 

2 

a substantial correlation.** 

2. Mental ability appeared to influence the scores in read¬ 
ing, in literature, and in general science and health education. 
It was substantially correlated with each of these subjects 

as Table IV shows. If the Henmon-Nelson Test of Mental 
Ability is correctly described as a group test of academic 
aptitude, ^ then the high correlation between the scores on it

and reading scores is to be expected. Strang^ reports that 
the coefficients of correlation between group tests of

When mental ability was held to a limited range the 
coefficients of correlation between reading and literature 
and between reading and science and health dropped appreciably 
from the original figures of .79 and . 67 . As one might expect,

these coefficients did not agree exactly with the figures 
obtained by "partialling out" mental ability. There are 
two reasons for the differences: the small sample within 
the limited range and the particular location of the limited 
range within the full range of scores in mental ability. 

The fact that there are these slight differences suggests 
the possibility that the correlation between reading and 
the other subjects might vary from one level of mental 
ability to another. Because of the small number of cases 
at one level, particularly towards the extremes of the range 
of mental ability, it was not feasible in this study to 
investigate fully the possibility of such variations in the 
relationship of reading to academic achievement. Table V 
shows the results that were obtained when mental ability 
was limited to a few points near the arithmetic mean of 
the distribution of the scores in mental ability.

5* When both mental ability and vocabulary were held

scores on the reading test (without the vocabulary sections) 
and the scores on the literature test dropped to . 29 . 

The partial coefficient of correlation between reading 
(without the vocabulary sections) and achievement in

The partial ?T r ff between reading (without the 
vocabulary sections) and literature, when both mental ability 
and vocabulary were held constant, was .29. Although this 



























- 43 - 


figure is significant at the .01 level, it indicates 
only a slight correlation. It would appear that mental 
ability and vocabulary had much to do with the positive 
relationship between reading ability and achievement in 
literature, but possibly other unidentified factors entered 
into the relationship. 

The partial fT r TT between reading (without the 
vocabulary sections) and general science and health education 
was only .03 when both mental ability and vocabulary were 
TT partialled out.t T Of course, this coefficient is quite with¬ 
out significance. It is possible that mental ability and 
knowledge of general vocabulary were mainly responsible for 
the total TT r TI between reading ability and achievement in 
science and health. However, a decrease in the coefficient 
of correlation when factors are n partialled out tT does not 
necessarily establish causal relationship. Perhaps mental 
ability and knowledge of general vocabulary were only features 
concomitant with reading ability and achievement in science 
and health. In addition, it must be remembered that vocabulary 
and mental ability as they were measured in this study may 
not be distinct factors and that holding them constant by 
TT partialling out !T may be eliminating factors that are not 
identified. Despite such caution in drawing conclusions, 
it is fairly safe to assume that the children of better mental 
ability would be, as a consequence of this ability, better 
in reading and in science. On the other hand, it would be

wise for a person to determine experimentally whether 
improved general vocabulary brings improved marks in 
general science before he assumes that vocabulary was 
a distinct causal factor in the relationship discussed 


here.

CHAPTER VII 


Conclusions and recommendations 

A. Con cl usi ons. 

1. The Alberta Reading Test of 1950 was a satisfactory 
measure of silent-reading ability. 

2. Reading ability appeared to be significantly related 
to the success of the Grade IX students in literature and 
in general science and health education. General reading 
ability was more closely related to achievement in literature 
than to achievement in general science and health education. 

3. Mental ability was a factor common to reading ability, 
achievement in literature, and achievement in general 
science and health education. 

4* Knowledge of general vocabulary was positively and 
substantially related to reading ability, to achievement 
in literature, to achievement in general science and health 
education, and to mental ability. The relationship between 
general vocabulary and achievement in general science and 
health education was just as close as the correlation between 
the scores on the complete reading test and those on the test 
in science and health education. Vocabulary and literature 
were almost as closely related as reading and literature. 
Coefficients, all above or only slightly below .70, indicate 
that the correlation between general vocabulary and each of 


- 45 - 










- 46 - 


reading, literature, science and health, and mental ability 
might be described as "very substantial" or "high." 1 2 

B. Recommendations. 


1. Educators concerned with the junior high school should 
recognize that reading ability is closely related to the 
achievement of Grade IX students in literature, in general 
science, and probably in other content areas. Continued 
research into the nature of the relationship is desirable 
to determine what advantage of it may be taken by teachers 
and students. Instruction time spent in developing a general 
reading ability for the purpose of improving the students 1 
achievement in a content field may, or may not, bring 
commensurate returns, but one may expect that teaching 
reading in a particular subject area will result in a 
significant improvement of knowledge in that area. Often 
rather elaborate lists of specific skills are given for 
reading in a special content field, but, as Gray-^ suggests, 
there is need for further study to determine whether 
instruction in the various reading abilities has to be as

complicated as it sometimes tends to be, 

2. The close association of general vocabulary with reading 
and with achievement in the content fields should also be 
recognized. Again further investigation is desirable, 

(a) to determine whether or not vocabulary is truly a 
causal factor in the relationship, and 

(b) to learn to what extent and in what manner vocabulary 
training can be used to develop reading ability* * and to 
effect improved achievement in a content field. 

Merely teaching words is hardly teaching reading.^ 

Yet there is sufficient evidence in this study and in others 
that are described in Chapter III to suggest that the extent 
of a student’s vocabulary may have much to do with his 
success, not only in reading, but also in the content fields. 
Teachers and students may well become TT word conscious. TT

in Seco ndary Schoo ls, The Macmillan Co., New York, 1947,p. 93 

*Gray and Holmes found that the direct method of 
teaching vocabulary not only was superior to the incidental 
method, but it produced positive and greater gains in 
reading efficiency. They were working with pupils in Grade IV 
who at this level might be, or might not be, more dependent 
on direct teaching of vocabulary than would Grade IX students

When the triangle sounded in the morning, Jody dressed more quickly than usual. In 
the kitchen, while he washed his face and combed his hair, his mother addressed 
him irritably. “Don’t you go out until you get a good breakfast in you.” 

He went into the dining-room and sat at the long white table. He took a steaming 
hotcake from the platter, arranged two fried eggs on it, covered them with another 
hotcake and squashed the whole thing with his fork. 

His father and Billy Buck came in. Jody knew from the sound on the floor that both 
of them were wearing flat-heeled shoes, but he peered under the table to make sure. 
His father turned off the oil lamp, for the day had arrived, and he looked stern and 
disciplinary, but Billy Buck did not look at Jody at all. He avoided the shy questioning 
eyes of the boy and soaked a whole piece of toast in his coffee. 

—The Rod Pony

A newspaper reporter tells of two bandits who entered the office of a manufacturing 
firm, covered the employees with pistols, and demanded the payroll. “Let ’em have it,” 
said the proprietor to his employees, meaning that they should hand over to the holdup 
men the $550 payroll. The bandits thought the proprietor was telling someone to shoot 
them, so they opened fire. Two bullets struck and killed the proprietor. The bandits 
fled without the payroll.

When I heard the learned astronomer, 

When the proofs, the figures, were ranged in columns before me, 

When I was shown the charts and diagrams, to add, divide, and measure them, 

When I, sitting, heard the astronomer where he lectured with much applause in the 
lecture room, 

How soon unaccountable I became tired and sick, 

Till, rising and gliding out, I wandered off by myself, 

In the mystical moist night-air, and, from time to time, 

Looked up in perfect silence at the stars. —Whitman 

(15) The central meaning of the above poem 
is that the listener learned to appreciate 
the stars by 


The Sea Gypsy 

I am fevered with the sunset 
I am fretful with the bay, 

For the wander-thirst is on me 
And my soul is in Cathay. 

There’s a schooner in the offing 
With her topsails shot with fire; 

And my heart has gone aboard her 
For the Island of Desire. 

I must forth again tomorrow! 

With the sunset I must be 

Hull down on the trail of rapture 

In the wonder of the sea .—Richard Hovey 

[16) The chief idea in the above poem is 
that the speaker has 




;i|

16. a. a desire to travel 

b. a great yearning for sea life and travel 

c. become tired of the sunset 

d. decided to board a schooner

15. a. listening to astronomers lecture 

b. studying charts and diagrams

He pulled the mitten on hurriedly and stood up. He was a bit frightened. He stamped up 
and down until the stinging returned to his feet. It certainly was cold, was his thought. 
The man from Sulphur Creek had spoken the truth when telling how cold it sometimes 
got in the country. And he had laughed at him at the time! That showed one must not 
be too sure of things. There was no mistake about it, it was cold. He strode up and down, 
stamping his feet and threshing his arms, until reassured by returning warmth. Then 
he got out matches and proceeded to make a fire. From the undergrowth, where high 
water of the previous summer had lodged a supply of seasoned twigs, he got his fire-wood. 
Working carefully from a small beginning, he soon had a roaring fire, over which he 
thawed the ice from his face and in the protection of which he ate his biscuits. For the 
moment the cold of space was outwitted. The dog took satisfaction in the fire, stretch¬ 
ing out close enough for warmth and far enough away to escape being singed .—London 


(17) The best title to express the main idea 
of the above passage is 


17. a . Winter in the Woods 

b. Fighting against the Cold 

c. How to Light a Fire in Winter 

d. The Wisdom of a Dog 

e. The Man from Sulphur Creek 


(18) In the above passage the following 
incidents are mentioned:

In the King’s name! (Mary and Stewart are startled.) 

(Recovering first) The hay in the barn-quick, my son. 

Open in the King’s name! (Stewart snatches up such articles as would 
reveal his presence, and hurries into the barn. He overlooks the dirk on 
the floor. The old woman goes towards the door, slowly, to gain time.) 

Who is there ? What do you want ? 

Open, open (Mary opens the door, and Campbell of Kilmohr follows 
Captain Sandeman into the house. Behind Kilmohr comes his clerk. 
They are followed by soldiers.) 

Ila, the bird has flown. 

(Who has struck the dirk with his foot and picked it up) But the nest 
is warm; look at this. 

It seems as if we had disturbed him at supper. Search the house, men. 

I’m a lonely old woman. You have been misguided. I was getting 
through my supper. 

(Holding up the dirk) And this was your toothpick, eh? No! No! We 
know where we are, and what we want, and, I think we’ve got him. 

(Sounds are heard from the barn, and soldiers return with Morag. 
She has stayed in hiding from fear, and she still holds the cheese in 
her hands.) 

What have we here ? 

A lass! 

It’s just my dead brother’s daughter. She was getting me the cheese 
as you can see. 

On men, again; the other turtle dove will not be far away. Tut, tut, 
Mistress Stewart, and do you have her wait upon you while your 
ladyship dines alone! A grand way to treat your dead brother’s 
daughter. Fie, fie, upon you! 

(Soldiers reappear with Stewart, whose arms are pinioned.) 

Did I not tell you! And this, Mrs. Stewart, will be your dead sister’s 
son, I’m thinking; or perhaps your ladyship’s butler! Well, woman, 
I’ll tell you this: Pharaoh spared one butler, but Archie Campbell will 
not spare another. No! No! Pharaoh’s case is not to be taken as forming 
a precedent. And so if he doesn’t answer certain questions we have to 
ask him, before morning he’ll hang as high as Haman.

Bob and Ted were standing at a point D and shooting at a target T across a small 
pond. They wondered how far the target at point T was from where they stood. First 
they measured off a distance from D to E equal to 100 yards. Then they sighted T from 
D and found that angle EDT was equal to 58°. Next they sighted T from E and found 
that angle DET was equal to 60°. On the opposite side of DE they made angle EDS 
equal to 58° and angle DES equal to 60°. Then they drew and extended the lines DS 
and ES to meet at S. They measured DS. They knew that this was the same as the 
distance DT.

(33) The following are steps used by Bob 
and Ted in solving the problem above:

It is surprising how long it took the world to develop a good symbolism for algebra. 
Although geometry was well known to the Greeks, they never succeeded in working out 
a satisfactory number system. All early writers except Diophantus used the full word 
or an abbreviation for it, so that their equations were more like rules than modern 
equations. Diophantus (275 A.D.) used many symbols but his work had little influence 
on later mathematics, for all through medieval times, no satisfactory symbols were 
used for even the operations of arithmetic. Plus ( + ) and minus (—) seem to have been 
first used in Widman’s arithmetic (1489) in Germany. The multiplication sign (X) 
appeared in England in 1600. Our equality sign ( = ) was first used by Recorde, an 
Englishman, in 1557. Before his time the whole word or an abbreviation of it had been 
used. Vieta (1590), a French mathematician, used letters to represent both known and 
unknown numbers. His is the earliest book to resemble a modern text in algebra.

When we look at the sporting page of a newspaper we see many uses of percents. 
Notice this copy of a table that gives the standing of the Wheatland Baseball League 
near the end of a recent season. It shows that the Cubs had won (W) 48 games to 
date and lost (L) 28. They had played 76 games altogether. Since the Cubs had won 
48 of the 76 games played they had won 48/76 of their games. Newspapers print this 
fraction as a decimal correct to the nearest thousandth. So you find .682 as the 
“percentage” (Pet.) for the Cubs team. Although this figure is printed as a decimal, 
we usually read it as points and think of it as a per cent. The baseball fan who saw 
this in a newspaper would probably say, “The Cubs’ standing is 632”. By this he would 
mean that the Cubs had won 63.2% of the games played.

Nowadays lighthouses are found on every coast along which ships sail. When several 
lighthouses are near one another, sailors distinguish them either by the color of their 
lights or by the varying degrees of brightness at different times. In many cases the 
lantern revolves showing, one after another, a red, a white, and a green light. Others 
have a revolving shutter placed in front of the light, which causes it to make long 
and short flashes so many times per minute. From these differences the mariner can 
always tell just which light he is approaching, and thus he knows where he is. Behind 
the light is placed a concave mirror, which makes the rays of light shoot forward in 
parallel lines and reach out to a very great distance. 


(55) The main idea in this passage is 


(56) The distance at which the light from a 
lighthouse may be seen is increased by 
the use of

The fungi include more than seventy thousand species besides the many kinds of bacteria. 
Some fifteen hundred of them belong to the group called algal fungi. They are much 
like green algae except that they do not have chlorophyll. Many thousands belong to 
the club fungi, which get their name from the fact that they bear spores on the stalks, 
or “clubs”. Even more belong to the sac fungi, all of which bear spores in tiny sacs. 
The slime molds make up still another group of fungi, but not a very large one. None 
of these four groups of fungi can make their own food. They are all dependent plants: 
they all depend, that is, on other plants or animals for their food. 

Even though you may never have heard of the groups of fungi just named, you are 
almost sure to know some of the plants that belong to these groups. Among them are 
the yeasts, molds, mushrooms, and grain rusts.

At least two species of native Canadian animals are extremely fond of mushrooms. The 
mountain caribou, common in certain areas of British Columbia, will purposely walk far 
for a mouthful of the choice morsels. Pine squirrels frequently scour the forest floor in 
search of their favorite mushroom—that known as boletus. In autumn these active wood¬ 
land animals store quantities of mushrooms for winter use, placing them on the flat 
branches of spruce trees where they are dehydrated, and remain edible throughout the 
season of frost and snow. It is noteworthy that the high branches on which the fungi are 
dried and stored are out of reach of mice and mule deer. Apparently squirrels have no 
worries concerning unwholesome toadstools—they eat freely of varieties that to man are 
deadly.— McCowan. 

(62) This passage is chiefly about 62. a. mushrooms b. toadstools 

c. storage of food for winter 

d. animals of British Columbia 

e. some food habits of animals

Today the filaments of our light-bulbs are made of tungsten. Each tiny tungsten wire 
is formed into a very close spring-like coil so that each turn of wire helps keep its neigh¬ 
bors hot. The large bulbs are filled with the gas argon. Argon is a very inactive chem¬ 
ical agent; that is, it does not combine easily with other substances. Therefore it does 
not change the tungsten. It is put into the bulb to keep the tungsten from evaporating 
as rapidly as it would in a vacuum. These improvements allow us to get seven times as 
much light from electricity as could be got from the carbon-filament bulb. But still we 
receive less than three per cent of the electrical energy in the form of light. Our light- 
bulbs are better heaters than “lighters ”.—Science Problems.

b. how improvements have increased the 
effectiveness of light-bulbs 

c. the purpose of coils in a tungsten filament

(67) The following represent five phases of 
a situation which John Smith 
experienced: 

1. He ran to shelter. No sooner did he 
reach shelter than a downpour 
occurred. 

2. He decided that, if he did not hurry, 
the storm would overtake him. 

3. He proved that his hypothesis was 
correct. 

4. He saw that the cloud was black. It 
was then moving quite rapidly. It 
reminded him of similar clouds he 
had seen. 

5. He saw a cloud approaching from 
the west.

Would you like to take a personal part in the United Nations? You can do so without 
knowing a thing about diplomatic protocol, committee procedure, or how or when to 
hurl a veto. 

All you have to know is that twenty million children in this world haven’t enough to 
eat, enough to wear, or enough medicine to keep them well. All you have to do is send 
a dollar (or more if you can spare it) to UNICEF, Ottawa, Canada. 

UNICEF is short for United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund. It’s the 
only branch of UN that asks help from citizens as well as governments. It has already 
helped save the lives of some six million children in more than fifty countries in both 
hemispheres. 

But UNICEF’s funds are running low. Our Government has contributed six millions, 
will soon give another one million dollars. But all of us can do something toward 
redressing one of war’s greatest injustices—the misery, disease, and starvation it inflicts 
on innocent youngsters. 


(79) This paragraph is mainly about 


(80) The following are ideas stated in the 

above paragraph: 

1. The Canadian Government has con¬ 
tributed millions to UNICEF. 

2. We may share in the work of the UN 
without knowing the details of its 
procedures. 

3. UNICEF is the only branch of the 
UN which asks aid from both gov¬ 
ernments and individuals. 

4. Twenty million children in the world 
are starving.

the above passage is

America’s heavily burdened taxpayers may find explanation if not comfort, from a 
demonstration centuries ago of how money dwindles in the hands of officials when 
there is a multiplication and concentration of power in government bureaus. 

The occasion was a great state banquet given by Frederick the Great and attended by 
courtiers and noblemen of his realm. 

“Gentlemen,” the sovereign complained, “although we levy new taxes and duties, our 
revenues continue to diminish. Can you find a solution for this problem?” 

Expressions of various economic theories came thick and fast from various wise men 
present, until an old general, one Ziethen by name, stood up and motioned for silence. 

“If your majesty desires,” he remarked drily, “I will show you what happens to the 
money.” 

Removing a large chunk of ice from a wine pitcher, and lifting it high for the inspection 
of all, he handed it to his neighbor and requested that it be passed on from hand to 
hand, down the long table to the King. By the time it reached Frederick it was about 
the size of a pea. 

“Now,” said the old soldier, “does your Majesty understand why the money is so piti¬ 
fully reduced by the time it reaches your coffers?” 

In the strange silence which followed, a grim, unsmiling sovereign replied that he did. 

(81) The writer of this passage directs its 81. a. King Frederick 

idea chiefly to b. Ziethen 

c. the courtiers and noblemen 

d. American taxpayers 

e. old generals 

(82) The central idea in the above passage is 82. a. money is the root of all evil 

b. ice melts if it is passed from hand to hand 

c. a king always taxes his people heavily 

d. a highly organized and centralized govern¬ 
ment is costly 

e. Ziethen was a clever man

(83) The following are four incidents from 
the above passage: 

1. A wise man speaks. 

2. American taxpayers wonder why 
they have to pay high taxes. 

3. A king asks for an explanation. 

4. An old story is begun.

introduced in the above passage is

Greece grew partly by war, but much more by trade. In earlier times the vessels that plied 
across the Aegean from the mainland to the islands, carrying goods of various kinds, 
were not Greek. They belonged to another race, from whom the Greeks learned much, 
the Phoenicians. The home of these people—so called by the Greeks because of their 
darker skin—was in Tyre and Sidon, rich cities on the coast of Syria. They sent out 
trading vessels to all different quarters of the world. While the Greeks were still home¬ 
keeping farmers living poorly on their land, rude people with little art or knowledge 
beyond that of war or husbandry, the Phoenicians were highly civilized, like the people 
of Egypt. They had discovered the art of writing: they had an alphabet. They were skilled 
workers in metals. They knew how to dye woollen stuffs in rich hues. They used weights 
and measures and some rude sort of money.— Greece.

Land conservation activities are being continued under the Prairie Farm Rehabilitation 
Act. The Act was passed in April, 1935 “to provide for the rehabilitation of drought 
and soil-drifting areas in the provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta”. 
Emphasis is placed upon assistance to farmers in the development of water supply and 
improved farm practices. Under the terms of this Act the Minister of Agriculture is 
authorized to introduce throughout the affected area those “systems of farm practice, 
tree culture, and water supply that will afford greater economic security to the agricul¬ 
ture population.” By an amendment to the Act in March 1937 “land utilization and land 
settlement” were included as additional objectives, while a later amendment in March, 
1939, removed the original five-year limit to the life of the Act .—Canada 19h8.

2. Read the following paragraph and do the exercises which follow it. 

I turned up the dull and stinking oil lamp, and tried to read; but that fuliginous 
glim haunted the pages. That black-edged light too much resembled my own 
thoughts made manifest. There were some bunches of my cabin-mate’s clothes 
hanging from hooks, and I watched their erratic behaviour instead. The water 
in the carafe was also interesting, because quite mad, standing diagonally in the 
bottle, and then reversing. A lump of soap made a flying leap from the washstand, 
and then slithered about the floor like something hunted and panic-stricken. I 
listened to numerous little voices. There was no telling their origins. There was a 
chorus in the cabin, whispers, plaints, creaks, wails, and grunts; but they were 
foundered in the din when the spittoon, which was an empty meat tin, got its 
lashings loose, and began a rioting fandango on the concrete. Over the clothes chest, 
which was also our table and a cabin fixture, was a portrait of the mate’s sweet¬ 
heart, and on its frame was one of my busy little friends the cockroaches; for 
the mate and I do not sleep alone in the cabin, not by hundreds. The cockroach 
stood in thought, waving his hands interrogatively, as one who talks to himself 
nervously. The ship at that moment received a seventh wave, lurched, and trembled. 
The cockroach fell. I rose, listening. I felt sure a new clamour would begin at 
once, showing we had reached another and critical stage of the fight. But no; the 
brave heart of her was beating as before. I could feel its steady pulse throbbing in 
our table. We were alive and strong, though laboring direfully.

Old Susan 


When Susan’s work was done, she’d sit 
With one fat guttering candle lit, 

And window opened wide to win 
The sweet night air to enter in. 

There, with a thumb to keep her place, 5 

She’d read, with stern and wrinkled face, 

Her mild eyes gliding very slow 
Across the letters to and fro, 

While wagged the guttering candle flame 

In the wind that through the window came. 10 

And sometimes in the silence she 
Would mumble a sentence audibly, 

Or shake her head as if to say, 

“You silly souls, to act this way!” 

And never a sound from night I’d hear, 15 

Unless some far-off cock crowed clear; 

Or her old shuffling thumb should turn 
Another page; and rapt and stern, 

Through her great glasses bent on me, 

She’d glance into reality; 20 

And shake her round old silvery head, 

With—“You!—I thought you was in bed!” 

Only to tilt her book again, 

And rooted in romance remain. 24

Mr. Squirrel 

I saw a brown squirrel to-day in the wood, 

He ran here and there just as fast as he could; 

I think he was looking for nuts for his store, 

He’d found quite a lot, but he still wanted more. 

He can’t find much food once the winter is here, 
He hides all his nuts in a hole somewhere near, 
Then settles himself for a long winter sleep, 
Coming out now and then for a nut and a peep. 


Below are three versions of a final stanza for this poem. Read them carefully, then 
answer the questions which follow them by placing the correct letter in the space 
to the right. 


A. He has a long tail that is bushy and slick, 

He always sits up just as straight as a stick. 

He isn’t afraid of big men or small boys, 

Unless they are making a good bit of noise. 

B. His long bushy tail keeps him cosy and warm, 

His nest’s far away from the wind and the storm. 

But when Springtime comes back, I think that maybe 
He’ll be waiting again in the woodland for me. 

C. His long, thick tail keeps him snug and warm, 

In his nest in a tree that is quite broad and high 
We’ll see him again when the spring breezes blow 
Up the tree he will scamper, then down he will go.

The Machine 

I am the machine! 

Born of a poet and a mathematician. 

Mine is the beauty of precision, 

The rhythm of motion 

Exquisitely spaced for accurate performance, 
The grace of balance 
So that each of my parts 

Moves in exact harmony with every other part. 
I am thought made steel; 

I am a dream come to life 

in pistons and cogwheels, 
in turbines and transformers. 

I am a slave to serve you, 
obedient, docile; 

But when I am master 
I kill. 

There is no compassion in me; 

Who worships me 
I destroy. 

Pity and hate are alike unknown to me— 

I am the machine !

Set No. 5—Read the following description of an experiment carefully. Then follow the directions 
given below. 

EXPERIMENT 

The inside of test tube A was moistened and some 
iron filings poured into it. The filings adhered to 
the moist tube. The test tube was then inverted 
in a beaker of water. The level of water in the 
tube was marked, and it was allowed to stand for 
24 hours. The same procedure was followed with 
tube B, but the iron filings were left out. 

After 24 hours the level of the water in tube A 
had risen about one-fifth of the distance to the 
top of the tube, and the iron filings had turned 
a reddish color. There had been no change in 
tube B. 

Both tubes were removed carefully and the air 
still in each tube was tested with a burning splint. 
When inserted in tube A the burning splint went 
out at once, but in tube B it continued to burn for 
a short time. 

NOTE—It has been previously shown that the oxygen in the air supports combustion. 

Consider each statement below and on the separate ANSWER SHEET mark your answers as 

follows: 

(a) if the evidence from the experiment makes the statement true. 

(fr) if the evidence from the experiment makes the statement false. 

(c) if the evidence from the experiment indicates that the statement is probably true. 

( d ) if there is insufficient evidence in the experiment to decide if the statement is true or 
false. 


A B 



SAMPLE: 

1. Some of the air disappeared from tube B. 

2. The rusting of iron used oxygen from the air. 


(To be answered in blanks 87—96 inclusive) 

87. The rusting of iron is a form of slow oxidation. 

88. The water stopped rising in tube A because the oxygen in the tube had been used up. 

89. The air left in tube A is chiefly carbon dioxide. 

90. The rusted iron is heavier than it was before rusting. 

91. All of the air that was in tube A at the beginning of the experiment would support com¬ 
bustion. 

92. Heat was produced when the iron rusted. 

93. About 20% of the air is oxygen. 

94. Moisture is needed to cause rusting of iron. 

95. Tube B is not a necessary part of the experiment. 

96. Air pressure caused the air to rise in tube A.

magnetized. 

(2) The clapper B is pulled towards 
the electro-magnets and the 
clipper strikes the bell. 

(3) The circuit is broken at the con¬
