ABSTRACT 


A surface combustion autothermic reaction furnace was 
designed and built' in order to determine its suitability for the 
thermal decomposition of light hydrocarbons. The unit was used 
to produce ethylene by thermally decomposing propane. Propane 
was used to test the unit because it cracked at temperatures eas¬ 
ily obtained in the furnace, and because of the ease with which 
it could be handled. 

The product distribution obtained from thermal decomp¬ 
osition of propane in this unit correspond.ed approximately with 
the product distributions obtained in other processes. Thermal 
efficiencies were relatively low. However, the major heat losses 
present in this unit were of the type that could be reduced con¬ 
siderably when "scaled up" to commercial size units. The future 
of this process depends on economic factors beyond the scope of 


this thesis.

Various investigators in the past have been interested 
in the production of ethylene. This is due to the industrial im¬ 
portance of ethylene as a chemical building block. At present, 
the production of ethylene by the tubular furnace is the domin¬ 
ant process,, but other methods have been proposed which may yield 
even cheaper ethylene. One such method is by means of autothermic 
pyrolysis 0 This is simply a process wherein the heat required for 
decomposition is generated in situ. The process is consequently 
self-sufficient. 

During World War II Germany used autothermic techniques 
for the production of ethylene from ethane and oxygen. The pro¬ 
cess was carried out at approximately 0.5 atmospheres absolute 
pressure. After the World War R. M. Deansely and C. H. Watkins ( 3 ) 
in the United States studied the process on a pilot plant scale. 
They found that there was no real need for subatmospheric oper¬ 
ation with its attendant increased costs. Furthermore, with proper 
attention given to heat exchange and thermal economy, air may be 
used rather than oxygen. Although at the time ( 1951 ) the process 
appeared to be competitive with conventional methods, no indust¬ 
rial plants have yet been built in America. 

Recent experience in the Research Council of Alberta 
laboratories indicated that a surface combustion burner would be 




-2- 

an efficient way of supplying the heat necessary for thermal decomp¬ 
osition of hydrocarbons. 

The process is carried out by simply mixing the hot com¬ 
bustion product gases from the burner with the hydrocarbon feed as 
illustrated in Figure 1. Separation of combustion reactions from 
cracking reactions appears to offer several advantages over convent¬ 
ional autothermic techniques. First, a cheap fuel may be burned 
rather than part of the feed. Second, combustion is essentially com¬ 
plete at the burner surface, and the "reforming" reactions between 
the carbon dioxide and water (formed during combustion) and the hydro¬ 
carbon feed are slow compared to the cracking reactions. There is, 
therefore, a good chance that the carbon monoxide - to - carbon diox¬ 
ide ratio would be lower, resulting in higher thermal efficiencies. 
There have been several patents in which a premixed blow torch type 
of burner is introduced directly into the reaction zone. Flame temp¬ 
eratures in such a case are very high causing excessive carbon form¬ 
ation. Further, it is difficult to stabilize a flame in the gas phase. 
On the other hand, the surface combustion burner is capable of pro¬ 
ducing stable and complete combustion at relatively low temperatures. 

The work reported here included the design of a surface 
combustion reactor and its application to the thermal decomposition 
of propane. 

THEORETICAL COhSIDERATIOTIS 
1. Surface Combustion 


Sir Humphrey Davy first observed low temperature catalysis

in 1817 when he inserted a piece of warm platinum wire into 
a non-explosive mixture of oxygen and coal gas. He found that the 
platinum wire glowed and became hot. Other investigators, later 
on, discovered that various other metals and metallic oxides ex¬ 
hibited the same property as platinum with regards to low temper¬ 
ature catalysis. It was, however, Luke (10) who really started 
a systematic investigation of surface or flameless combustion. 

Luke worked on the idea that an explosive mixture of oxygen and 
gas when ignited would form a stable flame front on a solid surface. 

He noted that a screen or porous plate would prevent to some extent 
the flame front from travelling past it, provided the heat evolved 
in the very rapid reaction could be dissipated. Failure to dissi¬ 
pate this heat leads to what is called "back-flashing" or "back-firing". 
It was known then that flame movement was markedly damped by movement 
through small openings. Thus Luke designed and patented two types 
of surface combustion burners. Figure 2 (a) is an example of an 
explosive mixture of air and fuel gas impinging and burning on a 
bed of refractory chips. Figure 2(b) is an example of the explosive 
mixture of air and fuel gas passing up through a bed of refractory 
chips in which the burning takes place. 

Bone (1,9) in England worked, on the same problem and part 
of the work was done on a porous refractory diaphragm. Here, it was 
noticed that when the explosive mixture is first lit, there is a 
small flame in front of the plate (porous diaphragm). This flame re-

ceded to the surface after the plate became hot giving surface com¬ 
bustion. This is the fore runner of the surface combustion burner 
used in the present investigation. Excessive surface temperatures 
caused "back-flashing”, often damaging the plate. 

Further discussion of surface combustion requires some 
knowledge of the theory of flames (8), particularly that of flat 
flames. The surface combustion burner used resembles, in many ways, 
a flat flame burner. 

A flame is essentially a fast, high temperature oxidation 
that is generally regarded as a free radical reaction. This oxidation 
is controlled by external factors, such as burner design, initial gas 
temperature, and turbulence of the combustible mixture, as well as by 
the composition and other characteristics of the fuel. A flame may 
be considered to consist of three zones: 

1. Burned gases 

2. Luminous 

3 • Preheat 

Figure 3 shows a Bunsen burner flame in which the zones are not closely 
delineated. The flat flame studied to give the temperature distribution 
illustrated in Figure 4 was of a special type. 

To. experimentally study flat flames, special techniques and 
burners have been employed. Figure 4 illustrates the temperature dis¬ 
tribution in a typical flat flame. In this particular case, the propane- 
air flame was a very lean, wide, essentially flat, motionless, low- 
temperature flame. Conditions were deliberately chosen to give a thick

enough flame that a temperature traverse could be made. Normally 
flames are not this thick. The burned gas zone contains the products 
of combustion produced in the luminous zone. There are no temperature 
or concentration gradients in this zone. The luminous zone is the region 
between the burned and unburned gases. The thickness of this boundary 
may vary widely - the more rapid the combustion the thinner the flame 
front or boundary. The rate at which the flame front moves back towards 
the unburned gases is called the flame velocity and is one of the import¬ 
ant parameters in the combustion process. The position of the flame 
front in space is determined by the vectorial sum of.the flame velocity 
and the flowing velocity of th§ unburned gases. The flame front will be 
stabilized when the two velocities are equal - a condition that exists,, 
for example, at the exit of a Bunsen burner. 

The tendency of a flame to flash back through the unburned 
mixture may be explained by either of two flame combustion theories 
- one based on purely thermal grounds, and the other on chemical re¬ 
action grounds. The so-called comprehensive theories of combustion 
take into accoLmt both mechanisms. 

In the simplified thermal theory the combustible gases in 
the preheat zone are heated by conduction from the flame front. When 
these gases reach ignition temperatures, which may be as low as 1200° F, 
they burn and the flame front moves back. The onset of combustion is 
due to a rise in temperature of the unburned gases. 

In the chemical activation theory, the onset of combustion 
in the preheat zone is due to a backward diffusion of free radicals 



- 10 - 


which are in relatively high concentrations in the flame zone. (7) 
There is a concentration gradient of free radicals very similar to 
the temperature gradient shown in Figure 4. 

Both theories accept the role of free radicals as being 
responsible for the combustion process. Their presence in the preheat 
zone may be caused either by thermal means or by diffusion. It is 
generally agreed that there is a definite induction period before 
the combustible gas burns. This induction period explains why the 
unburned gases, upon reaching ignition temperatures in the preheat 
zone, do not burn until they reach the flame zone. Higher gas velo¬ 
cities enable the unburned gases to pass through the preheat zone in 
a shorter time due to two additive effects - a shorter preheat zone 
and a faster velocity through it. If the time interval between the 
point at which the unburned gases reach ignition temperature and the 
point at which it enters the flame zone is shorter than the induction 
period,, then the flame will not flash back. 

In surface combustion the general theory regarding the flames 
apply. Here,, the unburned gases pass through a permeable ceramic 
burner plate and the flame front is stabilized at the burner surface. 
Due to the catalytic effect of this surface, it is possible to get 
stable combustion at relatively low temperatures. A temperature 
gradient exists in the interior of the plate similar to that shown in 
Figure 4. However, since the thermal conductivity of the burner 
material is orders of magnitude higher than that for gas, the preheat 
zone is stretched out, and so is the ignition zone. Although the 





-11- 


actual width of the preheat and ignition zones in a surface combustion 
burner are larger than in a gas flame, the actual velocity of combust¬ 
ible gases is higher, for the same mass flow, since the cross-sectional 
area for flow is reduced due to the burner plate. With the burner used 
in the present investigation, in order to keep the residence time of the 
combustible gases in this ignition zone smaller than the induction period 
the surface combustion flame temperature had to be kept at significantly 
lower values than that encountered in open flames. 

The temperature at the surface of the burner plate is determined 

by: 


1. the rate of fuel and air flow, which determines the heat 
input to the system, and 

2. the rate at which the surface is able to dissipate the 
heat to the surroundings. 

A heat balance on the surface giveB the equilibrium temperature. The 
relationship between surface temperature and fuel rate is shown graph¬ 
ically in Figure 5« Air and natural gas, in stoichiometric quantities 
enter the burner at room temperature (77° F). Heat dissipated is assumed 
to be entirely due to radiation to surroundings at room temperature. 

Thus, at a combustible gas flow rate of k SCFM/sq. ft., the surface 
temperature is at 1370 F; at 8 SCFM/sq. ft., the surface temperature 
becomes l660° F. However, if the burner is completely enclosed and 

the combustion made adiabatic, then the temperature at the surface of 

o 

the burner will approach the theoretical flame temperature of 3500 F.

For steady state operation, and assuming that the gaseous 
mixture of air and gas is at thermal equilibrium with the burner plate 
at all times and that the mass heat capacity (GCp) is independent of 
temperature, the theoretical temperature distribution through the burner 
plate may be calculated. The detailed derivation of the equation for 
the theoretical temperature distribution is shown in the Appendix. 

It is obtained by writing a heat balance for an incremental section of 
burner plate of unit cross-sectional area in the preheat zone. The 
differential equation is of the forms 

k. d . 2 . 2_. + GCp flL . = (r) (^H) 

dx^ dx 

where k = thermal conductivity of burner material 

G = mass rate of flow of combustible gases, lb. moles/(hr)(sq.ft.)

x = distance from surface of burner, ft. 

T = temperature, °f. 

r = f(T) = rate of reaction, lb. moles converted/(hr)(cu.ft) 

AH= heat of reaction, BTU 1 s/lb. mole 
The simplest assumption is that there is no reaction in the preheat 
zone, in which case the right hand side of the equation becomes zero. 
Integration of the equation then givess 
(T s - T) = (T s - T a ) (I - e" X ) 

where T = temperature of entering combustible gases, °F (in this case, 
say 77°F or room temperature) 

T = surface temperature °F

The shape of the temperature profile in the preheat zone is 

a function of the surface temperature T as well as the parameter .

The curves of the temperature profiles for various values ofo^are shown 
in Figure 6. The larger values of ^give high temperature gradients near 
the surface, which help to prevent flash-back by shortening the time 
interval during which the combustible gases are at ignition temperatures.

ductivity are therefore desirable. The values ; °^-= 3^ und o{ = 85 , 
represent approximately the values of the parameters for two of the 
flow rates actually used experimentally in the present investigation. 

Flash-hack is the result of the inability of the system to 
dissipate the heat produced. The heat that is not dissipated increases 
the temperature of the surface of the burner. With an increase in this 
temperature there is a general temperature increase throughout the plate, 
eventually causing pre-ignition of the combustible gases before they 
reach the surface. The heating effect progresses cumulatively once it has 
started. Flash-back, when it does occur, does so in a matter of seconds. 
The flame front travels from the burner front to the back very quickly 
and ignites the combustible mixture entering the burner. 

2. Propane Pyrolysis 

The unit was built in an attempt to evaluate the possibility 
of using this type of heat source for the thermal decomposition of 
light hydrocarbons. While a wide variety of hydrocarbons may be 
pyrolyzed it is generally known that the lower the molecular weight 
of the feed stock, at least down to ethane, the higher the yield 
of ethylene possible. However, these lower hydrocarbons require 
more severe conditions of time and temperature, particularly the 
latter ( 3 )• Commercially, propane and ethane are the two favor¬ 
ed hydrocarbons for making ethylene by pyrolysis. Propane was used 
here because it could be pyrolyzed at temperatures easily attained 
in the furnace. It is also easier to store and handle then ethane, 
which requires very high pressures to maintain it in the liquid 
form at room temperatures.

(a^ Kinetics 

In the thermal decomposition of propane there are a great 
many possibilities for the occurrence of various teactions. These 
reactions may be affected by temperature, pressure, and contact 
time. Table 1 (ll) lists effective overall reactions encountered 
in propane pyrolysis. 

The relative rates of these reactions determines the pro¬ 
duct distribution. For example, at 1350° F and. 1 atmosphere press¬ 
ure the rates of reactions 1, 2, 3 and 4 (the primary reactions) 
are in the ratios 1.0; 0.26; O.87; 0.04. Reactions 1 and 3 are, 
therefore, the major ones. Myers and Watson (11) solved a typical 
reactor design problem by two methods: - first, by using all ten 
equations and, second, by using only the first four reactions. They 
found no significant difference in their answers and concluded that 
in predicting product distribution, the last six reactions may be 
neglected. 

At low conversions, all the primary reactions are assumed 
to be first order; hence the product distribution should not be 
pressure sensitive. It has been found experimentally that there is 
no noticeable change in product distribution when the pressure is 
varied from one to seven atmospheres. 

Since the reactions have different activation energies, 
then temperature would have a significant effect upon product dis¬ 
tribution. Of four primary reactions, reactions 1 and 2 become 
more important relative to reactions 3 and especially k as the temp-

erature is increased. The net effect is that at higher temperatures, 
ethylene is favored over propylene. However, in most industrial pro¬ 
cesses, the conversion does not take place isothermally (in the con¬ 
ventional tube furnace, for example, the temperature increases with 
the fractional conversion so as to maintain a relatively constant 
overall reaction rate); and the effect of temperature is masked. It 
is more common in such cases to try and correlate product distribu¬ 
tion as a function of fractional conversion. . 

(b) Industrial Processes 
The Tubular Furnace (12) 

The tubular furnace is designed so that the feed stock to 
be thermally cracked is heated, as it passes through the pyrolysis 
tubes in the furnace. The tubes are 3 to 5 inches inside diameter 
and made of stainless steel. The reason for this range in tube diam¬ 
eters is to get reasonable surface to volume ratios. The tubular 
requirements for a furnace are based on a heat transfer rate of 
approximately 125 to 200 BTU/hr.1 (sq. ft.)(°F). Average radiant 
heat intensities from 9000 to 11000 BTU^hr.^ (sq. ft.) are employed 
in operating pyrolytic furnaces having tubes located near the re¬ 
fractory wall. 

Advantages 

The operation is straight forward. 

Pisadvantage s 

The materials of construction are expensive and have to be 
periodically replaced. The formation of carbon on the tube walls 











-21- 


causes operational difficulties. 

T he Pebble Bed (Thermofor) Furnace (4) 

This is a continuous regenerating process wherein the 
pebbles flow countercurrent to the reacting hydrocarbon. The 
operation consists primarily of two units. In one, the heater, 
the cool pebbles are brought in by a bucket conveyor and hearted 
by an air-fuel gas flame. Any carbon that may have deposited on 
the pebbles is burned off. The hot pebbles fall into the second 
or reaction unit. In this unit the reacting hydrocarbon enters 
at the bottom and is heated by the pebble bed as it goes through. 
The cold pebbles at the bottom of the reaction unit drop down on 
to a bucket conveyor. This process depends upon the sensible hea,t 
of the solid. 

Advantages 

High thermal efficiencies; comparatively cheap material 
of construction. 

Disadvantages 

A variable temperature range exists within the reaction 

unit. 

The difficulties of handling and control of hot solids. 
Wulff Process ( 6(a )) 

This process is made up of two identical units built of 


refractory material so that there is a maximum surface to volume 
ratio. The checker work of refractory material is heated in a 
cyclic operation with an air-fuel gas flame. Thus, one side of 







-22- 


the furnace is being heated while the other side is decomposing the 
reacting hydrocarbon. When the temperature of the reaction side drops 
sufficiently the hydrocarbon is sent into the hot side while the 
cooled side is heated up. This process also depends on the sensible 
heat of the solid to supply the endothermic heat of cracking. 

Advantage 

High thermal efficiencies. 

Disadvantages 

Cyclic operation. The reaction occurs over a range of temp¬ 
eratures. 

Lead Bath process (Q 

The molten lead bath process utilizes the heat transferred 
from the molten lead to the hydrocarbon that is bubbled through it to 
decompose the hydrocarbon. With the heaters outside the reaction 
furnace it is necessary to rely on the heat transfer from the outside 
through the reaction vessel and molten lead to the reacting hydro¬ 
carbon. The inside heat transfer coefficients (based on calculated 
heat flux, corrected inside wall temperatures and lead temperatures) 
were of the order of 150 to 250 BTU/(hr.) (ft^) (°F. ) Thus the low heated 
surface to volume ratio for the reactor appeared to be favorable. 

There was little coke formation. 

Advantage 

There is very good heat transfer between the lead and the 
gas and ; therefore, the reaction vessel is compact.

Disadvantage s 

The flow rate of the reacting gas is limited due to 
possible entrainment of molten lead in the exit stream. 

The temperatures used are limited by the vapor pressure 
of the lead. 

The use of molten lead. 

Conventional Autothermic Process ( 3 ) 

The autothermic process is one wherein the hydrocarbon 
to be decomposed is burned in a deficient amount of oxygen or air. 
Part of the hydrocarbon is utilized to produce the heat necessary 
for thermal decomposition of the unburned portion. The CO to CO 2 
ratio in the product gas from this process is approximately 2 with 
the range being from 1.85 to The use of oxygen instead of 

air does not give a significant difference in the yields. Naturally 
there is a difference in concentration because, when oxygen is used 
there is no nitrogen for dilution. This process utilizes the effec¬ 
tive heat transfer between combusting and decomposing gases. 
Advantages 

The reactor volume is small. 

It is possible to attain high temperatures. 

The materials of construction may be cheap. 

Disadvantages 

There are a great many side reactions leading to C and C^ + . 

Dilution of the off gases if air is used or the cost of 


oxygen if it is used.

in Figure 7. The unit may be divided into various parts, namely: 

1 . Fuel System 

2 . Reactor gas System

4 . Exhaust System 
1 . Fuel System 

The controls for the fuel system are situated in one separ¬ 
ate section. Air used to premix with the gas is broig ht in at about 
80 psig. and passed through a water trap and Cuno micro-clean filter. 
The cleaned air then passes through a pressure regulator into the con¬ 
trol section, and then into the body of the burner. A venturi type 
mixer mixes the air and gas.

Natural gas of varying composition but constant heating 
value, used in the fuel system is brought in at a pressure of 
about 6 psig. It is passed through a Fisher Governor regulator 
that reduces the gas pressure to 11.25 pz. per sq. in. gauge, 
before being mixed with the combustion air. 

A rotameter in the line after the Fisher Governor is used 
to indicate the rate of flow o£ gas. There is an on-off solenoid 
valve in the line ahead of the pressure regulator that is connected 
to a temperature indicator with a preset controller feature. A 
thermocouple set against the back of the burner plate indicates this 
temperature. When the temperature gets too high due to a "flash-back" 
the solenoid valve is shut off automatically to protect the burner. 

2. Reactor Gas System 

In this system provision is made for the introduction of 
nitrogen from high pressure cylinders to clean out any combustible 
gas that may be present in the line. It is also possible to dilute 
the reactor gas with nitrogen. 

Commercial propane ( 2.5$ CgHg, and - ^8.1 $ C^Hg) 

is brought in as a liquid in 20 gallon cylinders. These cylinders 
are connected in parallel and thence to the system. 

A volumetric gas meter in the line after the rotameter is 
used to determine the rate of flow of either nitrogen, reactor gas 
(propane), or a mixture of both.

The top of the furnace is constructed as shown in Figure 8 . The 
shell of the body of the furnace is constructed as shown in Fig¬ 
ure 9* Within this shell two types of insulating bricks whose 
dimensions are 9 inches by 4-1/2 inches by 2 - 1/2 inches were 

used. The insulating bricks had a thermal conductivity of 0.31 

/ 0 / 

BTU/hr. sq. ft. F/ft. Of the two types of insulating brick used 
in the furnace type G 26 (good to 2600 °F) is used as the inner 
layer and type G 23 (good to 2300 °F) is the outer layer. These 
insulating bricks were installed so as to leave a reaction zone 
whose dimensions are 11 - 15/16 inches by II- 15/16 inches by I- 5/8 
inches in front of the burner. The reaction volume was 0.284 cu. 
ft. The first two dimensions are fixed by the size of the burner. 
The third dimension was chosen to give a retention time of the right 
order of magnitude. The reaction zone is closer to the top than to 
the bottom. This enables the furnace to have a "soaking" region 
just below the reaction zone and above the bottom of the furnace. 
This soaking zone allows for further reaction. Four chrome1-alumel 
thermocouples which were connected to a Brown Multipoint Recorder 
were installed in the reaction zone. An observation port on the 
side of the furnace permitted visual examination of the reaction 
zone during operation. This port was also used in lighting the 
furnace. The hydrocarbon feed passed through a preheater that was 
36 inches long. This preheater was made of l/4 I.P.S. stainless 
steel pipe and was located in the top of the reaction furnace.

The burner (Type No. 1, rectangular) is of the Cox combustor 
type and manufactured by Radiant Heating of London, England. The bur¬ 
ner plate is made of porous refractory material about 1-1/2 inches 
thick. This burner plate is cemented to a steel burner shell. The 
fuel gas entering the back of the burner shell is deflected by a 
distribution plate so that it is evenly distributed. Figure 10 is a 

cross sectional view of a burner plate. A burner of type No. 1 is 

o o 

specified to operate at surface temperatures of 1200 F to 1550 F 
releasing 50,000 BTU/(hr.)(sq.ft.). 

Figure 11 is an illustration of the furnace body; Figure 12 
illustrates the construction of the bottom of the furnace; Figure 13 
is a photograph of the furnace. 

4. The Exhaust System 

The mixture of spent fuel gas and reactor gas leaves the 
bottom of the furnace to pass through a heat exchanger. This heat 
exchanger is of the shell and tube type with the gas on the shell 
side (six passes). The cooling water is inside the copper cooling 
tubes (1/2 inch tubes) (12 passes). The cooled exhaust gases then 
pass through a flow meter and thence through the stack to the outside 
dir. 

An air ejector draws the gases through the system and pushes 
them out the stack. Figure 14 is a photograph of the heat exchanger 
and flow meter of the exhaust system. The oxygen analyser is also 


illustrated here.

Experimental Procedure 


-o 


, 6 - 


The air and fuel gas to the furnace were turned on. In 
lighting the furnace a fuel rich mixture was used. When the burn¬ 
ing became steady the flow of air and fuel gas were adjusted to the 
stoichiometric ratio. 

The pressure within the reactor proper was maintained at 
approximately atmospheric pressure by adjusting controls on the gas 
ejector system. 

Under conditions of no heat load the furnace heated up 
rapidly, and the burner surface soon reached the point where "back- 
flashing" was likely to occur. Thus it was necessary to introduce 
the hydrocarbon feed shortly after the burner was lit. 

After the unit reached a steady state (criteria of which 
included stability of reaction zone temperatures, and of the off-gas 
rate), an off-gas sample was taken and all the process conditions 
recorded. A typical run lasted one to two hours, after which a new 
propane rate was used and another run started. The air and fuel gas 
rates were held constant and a whole series of runs were made at 


various propane-fuel ratios.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 


Three series of runs were made at different fuel rates cover¬ 
ing approximately a three-fold variation in the flow of air and natur¬ 
al gas. In each series runs were carried out at fuel-to-feed ratios 
of approximately 3, 4, 5, and 6. The data are summarized in Tables 3; 

4 and 5* It must be noted that in these tables., the values reported 
as C i+ (including carbon) are calculated quantities obtained from the 
carbon balances by difference. They represent the carbon lost. The 
samples were taken in duplicate and analyzed by two methods. One method 
was by the Research Council of Alberta's analytical group using a Fisher- 
Gulf Gas chromatography unit,, and the other method was by the Canadian 
Chemical Company's Analytical Division using a Consolidated Engineering 
Company Mass Spectrometer. Comparison of the two sets of analyses are 
given in the Appendix. The discrepancies in these analyses are signifi¬ 
cant and not readily explainable. Both methods gave good material bal¬ 
ances, but neither showed a clear superiority. The gas chromatography 
analyses were chosen rather than the mass spectrometer analyses because 
a complete set of calculations had been made using the gas chromatography 
analyses before the results of the mass spectrometer analyses were avail¬ 
able. The treatment of the data is shown in detail in the Appendix. 

The introduction of propane into the reaction zone of the 
furnace gave no visual instability in the surface combustion on the 
burner. There appeared to be a wave motion of Incandescent gas within 
the reaction zone, which moved back and forth between the burner and the 
inert wall opposite it. 

n Flash-baeks ,T occurred when the burner surface got too hot(l800 - 
o 

1900 F was about the upper limit). Excess temperatures were caused by 
high fuel-to-feed ratios as well as by the total fuel input. Thus it was 

possible to operate with fuel-to-feed ratios as high as 7 to 1 at the 
lower fuel rates while, at the higher fuel rates

residence time) and fuel-to-feed ratio. Although temperature was not 
an independent variable, it was measured. 

To obtain an idea of the flow conditions, the range of Reynolds 
numbers existing in the reactor for the series of tests was calculated. 

The lowest Reynolds numbers existed at the entrance to the heated sec¬ 
tion where propane alone was present; the highest Reynolds numbers were 
at the exit where both the reaction and combustion gases were flowing. 

For all the runs, the Reynolds number ranged from 150 to 1500. This 
would, indicate that mixing due to flow turbulence alone would be small. 
However, since end effects are undoubtedly large and since the combustion 
gases and the reactant gases flow into each other at right angles, it is 
believed that mixing is fairly complete. 

Space velocities are not meaningful as a measure of reaction 
time in a reactor of the type used here since combustion gases enter 
the reaction zone all along the reactor length. However, they do give 
an indication of reactor capacity. Based upon gas volumes measured under 
standard conditions, and on the basis of the hydrocarbon feed alone, the 
space velocities ranged from 0.05 to 0.23 reciprocal seconds. On the 
basis of total feed (including both hydrocarbon feed and combustion gases), 
the space velocities ranged from 0.43 to 1.0 reciprocal seconds. 

The reliability of the data is indicated by examination of the 
material balances. First of all, a nitrogen balance was written and the 

rates adjusted to this balance. In general, the nitrogen balances 
checked to within 5 percent. The other elemental balances were then cal¬ 
culated. Carbon balances do not give the true picture because only the

gaseous products (up to 3 carbon atoms) -were metered and analyzed, 
while the higher hydrocarbons and free carbon were not collected. 

Oxygen balances were written assuming that the water formed during 
combustion remained in the off-gases. The oxygen balances generally 
agreed to within 5 percent and showed no trends. Losses of hydrogen 
ranging from 4 to 10 percent and averaging about 7 percent were shown 
by the hydrogen balances. These losses may be attributed to the 
hydrogen in the higher hydrocarbons and liquids that were not accounted 
for. 

In autothermic cracking the overall product yields are con¬ 
trolled primarily by energy■considerations. The heat produced by 
combustion of the fuel shows up in two places - as sensible heat in 
the off gases and as the heat of reaction in converting part of the 
hydrocarbon feed. Since pyrolysis occurs over a relatively narrow' 
temperature range, the magnitude of variation in sensible heat con¬ 
tent is small compared to the heat of reaction. The heat available 
for, reaction per unit of feed depends on the fuel-to-feed ratio:,, and 
therefore, this ratio is the principal variable in determining the 
fractional conversion of the hydrocarbon feed. The temperature in 
the reactor automatically adjusts itself to a level such that the 
kinetic considerations are satisfied. Severity of cracking may be 
measured by the percent expansion of the original hydrocarbon feed. 













































































.

Figure 15 shows the dependence of percent expansion on fuel-to-feed 
ratio rather than on space velocity. In this figure percent ex¬ 
pansion of the propane feed is plotted against the fuel-to-feed ratio 
for the runs that had ..a three-fold variation in space velocity. The 
data fell on one curve - the minor deviations can he explained on 
the basis of heat losses and differences in the preheating. 

Individual product yields of methane, ethylene, and propylene 
are plotted in Figure l6. Following the general practice in the liter¬ 
ature , the fractions,! conversion of the propane feed was used as the 
correlating variable rather than•temperature or space velocity. In 
a short reactor of this type,, where large temperature gradients exist 
both along and normal to the direction of flow, temperature would not 
be expected to give a satisfactory correlation. Also in a reactor where 
the bulk of the gas stream enters along the whole length of the reactor, 
space velocity has very little real significance. Fractional conversion 
is a measure of the severity of cracking. As may be expected there is 
some scattering of data; but, on the whole the curves indicate the expected 
trends. With increasing severity of cracking, methane and ethylene yields 
increase while propylene yields decrease markedly. The high fraction¬ 
al conversions occur at high fuel-to-feed ratios and in these cases, 
the temperatures in the reactor are also relatively high. High temp¬ 
eratures, of course, favor the production of ethylene over propylene. 

The product yields obtained in this investigation are com¬ 
pared to those from other industrial processes (tubular reactor, the 
lead bath reactor, and the conventional autothermie reactor) in

Figures 17 , l8 and 19• It should he noted that the yields are 
expressed in terms of the propane feed, and not the propane react¬ 
ed as in Figure 16. The methane and ethylene yield curves are in 
the same range as the other industrial processes. Within the limits 
of experimental error, it may he concluded that the yields from all 
those different processes are roughly the same. The propylene yields 
as shown in Figure 19 for this reactor are considerably lower than 
for the other processes with the maximum occurring at approximately 
the same percent conversion. The lower propylene yields may he 
attributed to the higher temperatures used in this reactor as compar¬ 
ed to the others. 

These higher temperatures are also probably responsible 
for the high conversion of the carbon in the feed to the higher mole¬ 
cular weight hydrocarbons (C^+) as well as to carbon black (which may 
be regarded as a high molecular weight hydrocarbon with a low hydrogen 
content). At the high conversions the literature shows a Ci_+ yield 
of up to 15 percent of the carbon converted. In this investigation 
the yield was as high as 29 percent. The rate of hydrocarbon decomposition 
ranges from 1.6 ..to 5*5 lb. moles of propane cracked per cubic foot of 
reactor space. This range of hydrocarbon decomposition rates is higher 
than that for the tubular reactor (l .2 to 1.8 lb. moles of propane 
cracked per cubic foot of reactor space) due to the better heat transfer 
characteristics of the surface combustion autothermic type of reactor. 

Thermal analysis of the data are presented in Tables 6 , 7 and 8 . 

The heat losses in the experimental furnace are of two types - heat losses 
to surroundings and heat losses due to the reforming reactions(the theoret¬ 
ical heat available was calculated on the assumption of complete combustion). 

Table 9 gives a breakdown of the heat losses into these two categories. 

The bulk of the heat losses are to the surroundings. However, in a ‘scaled- 

up" industrial

reactor this type of heat loss can he reduced to almost negligible 
proportions. The heat losses due to the reforming reactions are un¬ 
avoidable, but are fortunately low. In the conventional autothermic 
process the CO-to-CO,, ratios ranged from 1.8 to 2 . 5 , whereas the 
ratios in this investigation ranged from 0.3 to 0 . 8 . The lower ratios 
mean that higher thermal efficiencies are intrinsically possible. 

The difference in the range of values is explained on the grounds that 
in the conventional autothermic process, the combustion is carried 
out with an excess of hydrocarbon, while in the process described 
here the combustion utilizes a stoichiometric mixture of fuel and air, 
and the endothermic reforming reactions occur later. The heat generated 
by the burner in this (Surface Combustion Autothermic Reactor) reactor 
was between 18 to 46 thousand BTU per hour square foot. Comparing this 
with the heat fluxes encountered in the tubular reactor (8 to 10 thousand 
BTU per hour square foot) the heat fluxes are 2 to 6 times greater. 

The higher heat flux in the surface combustion reactor accounts for its 
generally higher rate of ethylene production. From an industrial point 
of view, this means a more compact reactor. It is believed that other 
types of surface combustion burners will give even higher fluxes. 

It is noted that the best thermal efficiencies were obtained 
with the lower fuel-to-feed ratios. The temperature inside the reactor 
for the latter were in general one to two hundred Fahrenheit degrees 
lower; consequently the heat losses were also lower. 

The composition of the off-gases are not representative of 
what may be expected from a larger unit in view of the high heat losses 
in this experimental unit. Table 10 shows the reduction in fuel-to-feed

ratio for various assumed operating conditions which would give the 
same overall conversion. 

It is assumed that the fuel gases supply the heat necess¬ 
ary for the pyrolysis, but otherwise have no effect on the reaction. 
Theoretically much lower fuel-to-feed ratios are possible than were 
actually used in the present investigation, resulting in an off-gas 

several times richer in ethylene and propylene. There would be no 

o 

difficulty in preheating the propane feed to 1000 F. Preheating the 
air and natural gas could result in even lower fuel-to-feed ratios, 
but this may lead to "flash-back" problems in the operation of the 
surface combustion burner. Hence this case was not analyzed theor¬ 


etically. 



-60- 


CONCLUSIONS 

No difficulty was encountered in the operation of the process. 
The presence of reacting hydrocarbon in the reaction zone did not have 
any noticeable effect on the operation of the burner. Thus the surface 
combustion burner gives complete combustion at relatively low tempera¬ 
tures in am atmosphere of hydrocarbons. However,, as the racial, ratio is 
decreased the reaction zone temperature also decreased. 

Whenever the temperature in the reaction zone reached l800 to 

1900° F a "flash-back 11 occurred. This indicates that the upper tempera- 

o _ 

ture limit of the Cox surface combustor used was about 1900 F. 

With the exception of propylene, the product distribution 
obtained from this investigation agreed within experimental error with 
those from the other processes. However, this discrepancy may be ex¬ 
plained by the different temperature levels at which the various pro¬ 
cesses are carried out. Since the product distribution and yields from 
propane pyrolysis in the autothermic surface combustion process are 
approximately the same as those for other industrial processes, this 
seems to indicate that the manner in which the heat is supplied has no 
effect on the product distribution. 

Due to the large heat losses, thermal efficiencies in the 
present experimental unit are low. However, most of the heat losses 
were of the type that could be reduced to negligible proportions in a 
large industrial unit. These heat losses that may be reduced comprise 
approximately of the heat lost. The other 6°/ 0 of the heat lost is 
used in the reforming reactions and cannot be reduced. 




-6l- 


Because of the lover CO to C0 o ratios the present process should have 
higher thermal efficiencies than the conventional autotherrnic process. 

No attempt has "been made to evaluate the economics of the 
process used. However., in view of the compactness of the reactor, the 
simplicity of the reaction furnaces, and the potentially high thermal 
efficiencies it is believed that the process investigated has indust¬ 
rial possibilities.

EXFERBMEAL PROCEDURE 

Before an experimental run is started there is some prelim¬ 
inary work that must he done. This work is as follows: 

1. Calculations are made of the various gas flows 

These calculations are corrected to the conditions existing 
on the day of the experimental run. 

2. The oxygen analyser is turned on at least 2k hours before 
the run is started so that the detecting unit is at thermal equilibrium 
when the analyser is used. On the day of the run a Varian Recorder that 
has been standardized is connected to the analyser. This oxygen analys¬ 
ing unit (Oxygen Analyser and Varian Recorder) is calibrated with two 
gases, purified nitrogen and air (20.93# 0 2 ). 

3* The temperature recorder and cooling water to the heat ex¬ 
changer are turned on. The off-gas meter is by-passed. 

4. The furnace is lit by inserting the lighting torch through 
the observation port hole. It must be noted that the torch is inserted 
before the natural gas is turned on. The air ejector is adjusted so that 
there is a slight negative pressure in the furnace during the lighting. 
The fuel gas mixture on lighting the furnace is such that there is an 
excess of natural gas in order to facilitate lighting. After the burner 
is lit the fuel gas rates are adjusted to the desired values and the fur¬ 
nace pressure is adjusted to atmospheric pressure. 

Thus the furnace is operating without any propane (reactor gas) 
passing through the unit. If desired, it is possible to take a sample of 
this gas in order to check the analysis with a carbon balance, etc. 

Using this run, it is possible to calculate the percent expansion of 












-6k- 


the reacting hydrocarbon in the following runs. The sample must be 
taken as quickly as possible and then the reacting hydrocarbon is let 
into the system. This is necessary because the furnace heats up very 
quickly when there is no reacting hydrocarbon passing through the system. 

After the propane (reacting hydrocarbon) is let into the 
system it is only necessary to adjust the pressure and maintain it in 
the furnace at atmospheric pressure. During a series of runs the fuel 
gas rate will be kept constant, thus only the reacting hydrocarbon flow 
rate and the furnace pressiire need adjusting for individual runs. 

Once all of the flow rates (including the off gas) and the 
recorded temperatures are constant (criterion of steady state).a sample 
may be taken. All of the pertinent information is recorded and the time 
of sampling noted.

Therefore the Total Q = 1-525 AT + 0.501 AT = 2.026 AT BTU/hr. 

o 

Assuming that the temperature of the shell of the furnace is 180 F 
and that the average temperature of the bricks inside the furnace is 
1323 °F then 

Q = 2.026 (1323 - 180) = 2316 BTU/hr. 


For a furnace height of 2 feet the heat loss through the walls of the 
furnace is 

2(2316) = 4632 BTU/hr = 4.63 M BTU/hr

Thermal Efficiency 

Basis: calculated combustion of air and fuel gas. Also 100 lb. moles

Table l4 shows the calculations in detail, but these calculations do not 
include the heat utilized to form CO from COg* 

Heat used (COg to CO) = + 40 M BTU/lb. mole 
The COg converted to CO is equal to the difference in the calculated 
combustion reaction and the moles of CO 2 in the exit gas.

Therefore, heat loss = 7.16 (O. 92 ) = 6.60 M BTU/hr

Calculation of the Rate of Generation of Heat 
Using run R-ll-2 as an example: 

The surface area of the burner is 1 sq. ft. 

The following is used to calculate the time it takes for 100 lb. 
moles of total feed to flow. 

Air flow = 4.02 scfm = 24l.2 scfh 
Gas flow == s 0.417 scfm = 25 .0 scfh 
Propane flow = O .745 scfm = 44.7 scfh 
Total flow = 310.9 scfh 

310.9 scfh /(359 cu.ft./lb.mole) = 0.865 lb. moles/hr. 

It takes 100 lb. moles 100/0 .865 or 115*3 hrs. to flow 

Heat generated by the fuel gas = 2089.9 M BTU/(l00 lb. moles) 

Therefore heat generated = 2089.9/115*3 = 18.1 M BTU/hr.(sq.ft.) 


Calculation of Ra te o f Hydrocarbon Decomposit ion 

Characteristic of the reactor = 3*995 sq. ft. of reactor/cu.ft. 

Using run R-ll-2 as an example 

Heat generated = 2089*9 M BTU/lOO lb. mole 

Heat lost = IO 8 I .7 M BTU/lOO lb. moles 

Heat available for thermal decomposition = 1008.2 M BTU/100 lb. mole
