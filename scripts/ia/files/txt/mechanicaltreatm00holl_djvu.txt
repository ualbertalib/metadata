FOREWARD 


The rapid extension of the systems of hard-surfaced roads 
has provided the incentive for thorough subgrade investigations prior to 
the design of the roadway. 

In contrast to foundation subsoils, highway subgrades are 
considerably influenced by climatic conditions. Because of this, general 
conclusions based on the results of laboratory tests can be very misleading. 

From the ground surface to a depth of approximately 6 feet, 
the physical properties of the soil are influenced by seasonal changes of 
temperature and moisture and by agents such as roots, worms, and bacteria. 
The upper part of this region is known as the A-horizon. It is subjected 
primarily to the effects of weathering. The lower part is referred to 
as the B-horizon. The highway engineer is chiefly concerned with the 
soils in these two horizons. 

Numerous authorities in Ganada and the U. S. A. have recom¬ 
mended the wasting of topsoils in highway and earth dam work. This recom¬ 
mendation involves stripping and hauling of this topsoil to some place 
where it may be wasted, which procedure can be very costly. 

During the past two summers the writer has been employed by 
the Department of Public Works, Province of Alberta. In that time, he has 
observed and experienced considerable construction difficulty in base course 
stabilization at some of the localities where topsoils were present in the 
embankment. Where the topsoil has been wasted in highway construction 
over virgin territory, the cost of grading per mile has been increased 
by as much as three times. Difficulty is also experienced in cases where 
the grade is being rebuilt. Usually drifting soil from cultivated fields 
has filled the ditches of the old grade. The amount of topsoil to be 
handled is thus greatly increased.

In preparing a program of soil study the magnitude of the 
job must be considered. If the proposed construction involves only a 
small expenditure, the designer cannot afford more than a few classifica¬ 
tion tests on representative samples. This lack of information must be 
compensated for by a liberal factor of safety in design. However, where 
the expenditure is large the cost of a thorough investigation is usually 
small compared to the savings possible by utilizing the results of the 
study in design and construction. Hence, on large projects, extensive 
soil investigations are quite likely justified. 

Accordingly, at the suggestion of officials of the Depart¬ 
ment of Public Works of the Province of Alberta, the writer undertook to 
conduct a laboratory study, under the direction of Dean R. M. Hardy, of 
compacted topsoil and subsoil samples, obtained from various localities 
in the Province of Alberta* This study was undertaken for the purpose 
of recommending some safe and practical solution to this difficult problem. 
If such a solution was not apparent at the completion of the study, it 
was hoped that the information obtained would suggest a program of future 


research,

INTRODUCTION 


In general, soil testing can be broken down into two general 

classes: 

1. Classification or identification tests, -which give results that 
can be used in semi-empirical design. They may also assist in reducing 
the number of more •laborate tests that would be necessary to predict 
the behaviour of the soil, 

2. Tests that give numerical values for a soil property. Such 
results can be used in theoretical soil mechanics as stresses are used 
in steel design. Examples of these soil properties are load bearing 
capacity, effect of changes in moisture, rate of flow of water through 
the soil, or its permeability, effect of freezing conditions, stress and 
deformation relations. 

Only classification tests for soils have been standardized 
by authorities such as the American Society for Testing Materials, 

Atterberg Limit and Specific Gravity tests were performed 
on the soils received. Upon considering these results, it was apparent 
that the topsoil and subsoil from each location, excepting location B, 
were essentially the same. Since the topsoil from location B is highly 
compressible with a high organic content, and the subsoil from location 
B is a clay with medium compressibility, it was decided to concentrate 
on these two soils in the laboratory study. 

The classification tests indicate that the topsoil and subsoil 
of location A are very similar. It was decided then to investigate the 
effect of any organic material present in the topsoil on the density and 
strength results.

GENERAL 


LOCATION AND DESCRIPTION OF SOIL SAMPLES 

Disturbed samples were received from the following locations, 
adjacent to existing highways: 


p i. 
J *4 


A — Highway 

16-C-2, : 

B — Highway 

2-E-l, H 

C — Highway 

16-B-2, I 

D — Station 

1992 f 00. 

E — Station 

2395 + 00; 

F — Station 

1188 + 00; 


These locations are plotted on a map of the soil zones of 
Alberta, Figure 1* 

The soils received are briefly described as follows: 

A — Topsoil: depth 0-6 inches, a grey silty sand with a low 
organic matter content. 

Subsoil: depth 6-2ii inches, a brown silty sand with no 
organic matter present, 

B — Topsoil: depth 0-8 inches, a black clay with a very high 
organic matter content. 

Subsoil: depth 8-2lj inches, a grey clay with no organic 
matter present, 

C — Topsoil: depth 0-6 inches, a black clay with a fairly high 
organic matter content. 

Loam Soil: depth 6-12 inches, a brown clay with no appreciable 
organic matter content. 

Subsoil: depth 12-U2 inches, a grey clay with no organic 
matter present. 








-f 



























D — Topsoil: depth 0-6 inches, cultivated field, a black clay 
with appreciable organic matter content and straw. 

Subsoil: depth at 2 h inches, a brown silt clay with no 
organic matter present. 

E — Topsoil: depth 0-6 inches, a dark brown clay with straw 
and some organic matter present. 

Subsoil: depth at II 4 . inches, a light brown clay with no 
organic matter present, 

F — Topsoil: depth 0-6 inches, a black clay with an appreciable 
organic matter content and straw. 

Subsoil: depth at lli inches, a brown clay with no organic 
matter present. 

It is of interest to note that the primary highways of 
Alberta are built chiefly through the soil zones with the higher organic 
matter content, these two soil zones being the shallow black and black 
zones. Figure 1 shows that locations B and C are located in the 
black soil zone and locations D and F in the shallow black soil 
zone. The topsoils from these four locations possess an appreciable 
amount of organic matter. It would seem, therefore, that a study of a 
map of the soil zones does indicate just where large amounts of organic 
matter in the topsoil might be expected along a proposed right-of-way. 



BROWN 


CLIMATE—Semi-arid, characterized by 
an average annual precipitation of 11 
to 13 inches, irequent drought, high 
evaporation and irequent hot dry 


SOIL PROFILE—In the normal profile 
the suriace (A) horizon is about 5 
inches deep and brown in color. The 
B horizon is commonly brownish in 
color and lime (Bca) is found at depths 
averaging 15 inches below the surface. 
The parent material (C) is found at 
depths of 20 to 24 inches. In the other 
zones this horizon occurs at greater 
depths. 


FERTILITY—Moisture is the principal 
limiting factor in crop production. Soils 
in this zone are relatively low in nitro¬ 
gen and under irrigation often respond 
to phosphorus fertilizers. 


LAND USE—Only the most favorable 
soil types can be considered arable. 
Most of the area is desirable for 
ranching. Where farmed, wheat is 
the principal crop grown. Cropping 
practices must provide for moisture 
conservation and control of soil drift¬ 
ing. The long frost-free period makes 
this zone a desirable area for the 
development of irrigation. 


DARK 

BROWN 


CLIMATE—The average annual pre¬ 
cipitation is 13 to 15 inches, and there 
are less frequent droughts than in the 
brown zone. Fairly high evaporation 
and hot dry winds are added char¬ 
acteristics. 


VEGETATION — Chiefly short grass 
prairie. The grass makes a denser 
cover and taller growth than in the 


SOIL PROFILE—In the normal profile, 
the surface (A) horizon averages about 
7 inches in depth and is dark brown 
in color. The B horizon is brownish, 
and the lime layer (Bca) is found 
usually at depths of 20 to 24 inches 
below the surface. In this zone as in 
other zones, the B horizon, having re¬ 
ceived some finer materials from the A, 
is usually somewhat heavier and more 
compact than the A horizon. 


FERTILITY—Moisture continues 
the principal limiting factor in 
production. Soils in this zone an

matter, but are higher in theM

BLACK 

(Boundaries Tentative) 


CLIMATE—Annual precipitation aver¬ 
ages between 17 and 19 inches and 
droughts are rare. Evaporation is 
lower and hot winds less frequent 
than in the previous zones. 

VEGETATION — Grassland which has 
been partially invaded by woodlands 
(mainly deciduous trees), often referred 
to as a parkland. 

SOIL PROFILE—The normal profile has 
a black to very dark brown surface 
(A) horizon that averages about 12 to 
14 inches in depth. The more com¬ 
pact B horizon is brown to dark brown, 
and the lime layer (Bca) is usually 
found at 30 to 40 inches below the 
suriace. 

FERTILITY—Soils in this zone are the 
most fertile in the province and they 
have in their surface foot about 3 to 4 
times as much nitrogen and organic 
matter as there is in the average 
brown or gray wooded soil. Every 
precaution should be taken to see that 
they aTe not allowed to deteriorate. 

LAND USE—A high percentage of the 
zone is arable. Wheat of fairly good 
quality can be grown, but mixed farm¬ 
ing, including the use of fertilizer when 
needed, is desirable from the stand¬ 
point of both profit and permanence. 



TRANSITION 

(Boundaries Tentative) 




CLIMATE—Annual precipitation aver¬ 
ages from about 12 inches in the 
northern section to about 20 inches in 
the southern. Evaporation is lower 
than in the previous zones. 
VEGETATION—M a i n 1 y woodland in 
which the tree growth is frequently 
denser and has more evergreens than 
in the black zone. 

SOIL PROFILE—Generally quite mixed, 
ranging from nearly black to gray. 
The surface horizon consists of a thin 
layer of semi-decomposed litter (A0) 
which may be absent in burned over 
areas, underlain by a mineral horizon 
that can usually be divided into two 
parts. The upper (Al) part may be 
black, gray black or dark brown. The 
lower part (A2) is frequently somewhat 
leached of organic matter and consid¬ 
erably grayer than the Al. The total 
depth of these surface horizons aver¬ 
ages about 10 to 12 inches. The B 
horizons are generally dark brown in 
color and Ume Is found at depths of 
about 30 to 40 Inches.

CLIMATE—Annual precipitation aver 
ages between 14 and 17 inches. The 
higher Tainfall is in the southern 
part of the province where there is a 
espondingly higher evaporation. 
Droughts occur only occasionally. 


SOIL PROFILE—The normal profile has 
A horizon that averages about 10 
inches in depth and which in its upper 
3 to 6 inches is black in color. The 
remainder is usually dark brown. The 
horizon is usually brown to dark 
brown and the lime horizon (Bca) is 
found at depths of 24 to 30 inches 
below the surface. Generally the depth 
to the lime layer is considered as 
:ative of the efficiency of 
penetration. 

FERTILITY—Soils in this zone 
usually fairly well supplied with 
gen and organic matter. In any zone 
exhaustive cropping depletes the soil's 
native food supply and fibre. A 
permanent system of cropping provides 
the adequate replacement of de¬ 
pleted plant foods and the maintenance 
of organic matter. 


LAND USE—A greater number of soil 
types can be considered arable than 
the brown zones. Wheat is the 
ncipal crop grown, but considerably 
more diversification is possible and 
should be practised to maintain soil 
fertility. The non-arable land is gen¬ 
erally very good pasture.

SOIL PROFILE—Generally quite mixed, 
ranging from nearly black to gray. 
The surface horizon consists of a thin 
layer of semi-decomposed litter (AO) 
which may be absent in burned over 
areas, underlain by a mineral horizon 
that can usually be divided into two

ages about 10 to 12 inches. The B 
horizons are generally dark brown in

as rich as those of the black z< 
Leaching of the surface horizons has

LAND USE—A system of mixed farming 
that includes legumes in the crop 
rotation, supplemented with applications 
of fertilizer when required, should be 
practised for best results. 


GRAY 
OODED 


(Boundaries Tentative) 


CLIMATE—Annual precipitation aver¬ 
ages from about 12 inches in 
northern sections to about 20 inches 
in the southern. This is accompanied 
by cooler temperatures, lower evapora¬ 
tion and shorter growing seasons than 
those of the previous zones. 


SOIL PROFILE—These soils have 
veloped under humid soil moisture 
conditions. The surface horizon consists 
of a semi-decomposed leaf mold layer, 
A0. that may be absent if the area 
has been burned over; a thin (sometimes 
absent) Al horizon that may be gray 
black, brown or gray brown, an< 
severely leached and platy. grayish 
A2 horizon, whose depth will average 
about 6 to 8 inches. The B horizons 
are heavier textured, compact, 
often darker in color than the A. The 
depth to lime is quite variable, often 
ranging from 30 to 50 inches. 


FERTILITY—Soils in this zone are rela¬ 
tively less fertile because of leaching; 
the deeper the leached layer, the less 
fertile. However patches of transition 
soils are found within the zone. 


LAND USE—This is a mixed fann¬ 
ing area in which legumes, hays and 
coarse grains are the most desirable 
crops. Rotations including legumes 
and supplemented with fertilizers, where 
needed, have given the most si 
factory results.

BRIEF DISCUSSION OF SIGNIFICANCE OF LABORATORY TESTS 


1. Specific Gravity 

The specific gravity will give a fair indication of the 
type of soil being tested. Silica sands have a specific gravity of 
about 2.65, clay soils vary from 2.70 to 2.80. The presence of organic 
material decreases the specific gravity considerably. 

The principal use of the specific gravity is in computa¬ 
tions incidental to other soil tests. 

2. Mechanical Analysis 

A comparison of grain-size curves does indicate great 
differences between soils. TlShile such curves may be satisfactory for 
classification purposes for soils of the same geological origin, any 
general system of classification based on grain-size alone is likely to 
be misleading, since the physical properties depend on many factors other 
than the grain-size. However, grain-size distribution curves do indicate 
the susceptibility of a soil to frost action. 

3* Atterberg Li mits 

The limit values of a soil are required for classification 
purposes. For sands and silts, the plasticity index may be zero, or even 
negative. For soils with an appreciable clay content, the plasticity 
index may be as high as 100. The clay soils of this area generally have 
plasticity indices ranging from 20 to 50* The compressibility of a 
clay is approximately directly proportional to its liquid limit, that is, 
a high liquid limit indicates high compressibility. A great deal of 
information is provided when the liquid limit and plasticity index are 
plotted on the Plasticity Chart, Figure l£. 

The shrinkage limit of the local soils is particularly

„ 

. 


important. A low value of the shrinkage limit indicates large volume 
changes, and swelling pressures with variations in the moisture content. 

li. Proctor Compaction Tests 

The optimum moisture content of a soil can be defined as 
that moisture content at which a given soil may be compacted most effi¬ 
ciently with a given method of compaction. The laboratory compaction 
test is the basis of control and inspection of the construction of high¬ 
way embankments. 

Since proctor developed his standard test, the weight of 
compactive equipment has considerably increased, and accordingly the 
modified Proctor test is often being used as a basis of control. The 
modified Proctor density test gives higher densities and lower optimum 
moisture contents. When the laboratory test is to be used as a control 
on the field compaction it must be remembered that the results of the 
test should compare to the results obtained by the field equipment. The 
available field equipment should govern the choice of the Proctor density 
test to be used as the basis of control. 

5. Trisocial Compression Tests 

The triaxial compression test is performed to determine 
deformation, stress and strength characteristics of a soil. Quick shear 
tests can be used to determine the shearing resistance of a material to be 
placed in an embankment. However, the differences between a compacted 
laboratory sample and material in the embankment are still uncertain. 

Hence the test results must be used with care. 

A series of tests to failure are run on samples at varying 
lateral pressures. One Mohr circle is plotted for each test, and then a 
line is drawn tangent to these Mohr circles. This rupture line is tangent 
to any Mohr circle drawn for failure conditions. Thus any Mohr circle

lying below the rupture line represents safe stress conditions. Any 
Mohr circle above the rupture line represents failure conditions, ' The 
intercept of the rupture line on the shearing stress axis is the cohesion 
"c”, and the slope of the rupture line is the angle of internal friction, 
" 0 ". 

The compressive strength of the soil can be determined by 
use of the following formula: 

q 0 = P c ( - * > + . (1) 

where, 

q - confined compressive strength 

c 

p c = confining or lateral pressure 

N . = flow value = tan ^ ( kS° f ) 

P 2 

This confined compressive strength is equal to the diameter 
of the Mohr circle, 1 - 3 . Where the confining pressure on the 

material is zero or where the material is near the surface of the embank¬ 
ment, then the unconfined compressive strength is: 

\ = 2c /V .(2) 

The ordinary highway embankment is usually not more than 
ten feet in depth; and then the confining pressure is not more than \ 
ton per square foot, and probably much less. 

Thus it is recommended that the compressive strength of a 
material in a highway embankment be determined by use of the relation, 

(2), above, 

6 , Califo rnia Bearing Ratio Tests 

The California Bearing Ratio, (C.B.R,), test is the basis 
of the California State Highway Department method of design of flexible 






. ' ' ■ J i'/or.f..: . j'« >•; I; j \ \

. 










pavements. The C.B.R. test, which is a penetration type test, determines 
a modulus of shearing resistance of soils. This modulus value is then 
used in empirical design curves to determine the total thickness of base 
and surface to protect the subgrade against shear failure. 

The validity of the laboratory C.B.R. test results are 
dependent on preparation of the sample to duplicate field conditions. 

At the present time, there is considerable doubt as to whether the labora¬ 
tory compacted samples have physical properties similar to the material 
in place during or after construction. Also the test is considered valid 
only when a large portion of the deformation under penetration is shear 
deformation. 

The U. S. Waterways Experiment Station has recently completed 
a laboratory investigation of the California Bearing Ratio test and its 
applications. The results of this investigation are found in the manual, 
”The California Bearing Ratio Test as Applied to the Design of Flexible 
Pavements for Airports”. A synopsis of the results shows that: 

(1) Wide variations in the C.B.R. test results on laboratory 
comp acted samples resulted. These variations are largely 
due to the method of preparation of the sample. 

(2) It is not known how closely the physical properties of labora¬ 
tory compacted samples correspond to those obtained by the 
various field compaction methods now available. Thus it will 
be necessary to study the physical properties of field com¬ 
pacted soils. 

The Department of Transport has recently completed an airport 
evaluation program. The results of this investigation conclusively prove 
that the C.B.R. method of design is too conservative for the design of 
airport runways and taxi-strips.

7. Freezing Tests 


Freezing tests are conducted on laboratory samples for the 
purpose of determining the volume change that is likely to occur in the 
material when in place in the embankment* If the void ratio is high, 
the expansion due to the water freezing is likely to occur in the voids. 
If the void ratio is small, then all of the expansion cannot be taken up 
by the voids and, accordingly, the soil mass will increase in volume* 
This increase in volume can be very detrimental. No attempt has been 
made in this study to measure the effects of frost action in either the 
topsoils or subsoils. As previously mentioned, little is known of the 
relationship between the physical properties of compacted laboratory 
samples and field compacted material. 

8 * Consolidati on Tests 

The results of the consolidation test are used to compute 
the settlement of structures on compressible clays. From the void ratio 
pressure curve, the compressibility of the soil may be determined* The 
results of the consolidation test have little use in highway engineering 
However, the time curve does permit a computation of the coefficient of 
permeability of compacted samples. This coefficient of permeability is 
necessary to investigate the effect of frost on soils.

PROCEDURE 


For the purposes of this laboratory study, it was decided 
that approximately one hundred pounds of both the topsoil and subsoil 
from each location would be required. 

A system of identifying the various soils was adopted as 
follows: the first letter in the soil number was used to identify the 
location, the second letter to identify the type of soil, and the third 
number to identify the number of samples of each soil received. For 
example, the samples received from location M C n would be identified as 
follows: 

C-T-l, the first sample of topsoil received from location "C”. 

C-L-l, the first sample of loam soil received from location n C u , 
(the loam soil being the layer of brown soil directly 
below the blacker topsoil). 

C-S-l, the first sample of clay soil or subsoil received from 
location "C n . 

After identifying each soil, the material was thoroughly 
mixed and air-dried, after which the sample was prepared* Preparation of 
the sample involved breaking down of the soil lumps, until the material 
would pass a J-inch sieve. Material such as rocks and roots, not 
passing the J-inch sieve was discarded, since the A.S.T.M. requires 
that only material passing a J-inch sieve shall be used in Proctor 
density tests. For each sample so prepared, it vras observed that not 
more than two per cent of the material had to be discarded. 

The following tests were performed on each soil type, with 
the noted exceptions, according to the test procedures outlined by, 

"Notes on Soil Testing for Engineering Purposes", by A. Casagrande and 
R. E. Fodum, 19UO.

3. Grain size analyses on A-T-l, B-T-l, B-S-l 

h» Standard and Modified Proctor density tests on A-T-l, A-S-l, 

B-T-l, B-S-l. 

5. Modified Proctor density tests on the loam soil, C-S-l, and the 
topsoil, F-T-l. 

6. Triaxial compression tests at lateral pressures of 0, 1$ and 

30 lbs. per sq. in., on samples, A-T-l, A-S-l, B-T-l, and B-S-l, 
compacted at approximately optimum moisture content for both the 
standard and modified Proctor density tests. 

7. (a) California Bearing Ratio tests on the topsoil, B-T-l, compacted 

at approximately optimum moisture content for both the standard 
and modified Proctor density tests. 

(b) California Bearing Ratio tests on the subsoil, B-S-l, compacted 
at approximately optimum moisture content for the standard 
Proctor density test. 

(Since the C.B.R. test molds were used for these tests, it was necessary 
to alter the number of blows per layer and number of layers from the 
A.S.T.M. standards to obtain maximum density. The results obtained are 
shown in Figures 35 and 36 .) 

8. (a) Freezing tests on the topsoil, B-T-l, compacted at approximately 

optimum moisture content in C.B.R. test molds for both the stan¬ 
dard and modified Proctor density tests. 

(b) Freezing tests on the subsoil, B-S-l, compacted at approximately 
optimum moisture content in the C.B.R. test mold for the standard 
Proctor density test. 

(c) Freezing tests on the soaked samples from the C.B.R. test for the 
subsoil, B-S-l, compacted at approximately optimum moisture

(d) Freezing tests on the soaked samples from the C.B.R. test for 
the topsoil, B-T-l, compacted at approximately optimum moisture 
content for both the standard and modified Proctor density tests. 
(In conducting these freezing tests, the sample in the C.B.R. test molds 
was placed in the frame ordinarily used in soaking the sample in the 
C.B.R. test. The open end of the sample was then covered with paraffin 
to prevent the loss of moisture during freezing. The sample was then 
placed in the freezing cabinet, with an Ames dial in position, to record 
the expansion of the compacted soil sample.) 

9. Unconfined compression tests on specimens approximately 1 cm. in 
diameter, obtained from a soaked sample, B-T-l, compacted approxi¬ 
mately at optimum moisture content in C.B.R. test molds for both the 
standard and modified Proctor density tests. These specimens were 
allowed to partly dry, before performing the compression tests. 

10. (a) Consolidation tests on the topsoil, B-T-l, compacted at approxi¬ 

mately optimum moisture content in Proctor density test molds for 
both the standard and modified Proctor density tests. 

(b) Consolidation tests on the subsoil, B-S-l, compacted at approxi¬ 
mately optimum moisture content in a proctor density test mold 
for the standard Proctor density test.

DISCUSSION 

1. SPECIFIC GRAVITY TEST RESULTS 

The specific gravity gives an indication of the type of soil. 
The results of the soils tested are listed in Figure ll|. The subsoils 
have values ranging from 2.6? to 2.69, indicating sandy clays and silt- 
clays. The effect of organic material in the topsoils is quite apparent. 
The specific gravities of the topsoils range from 2.5 to 2.6, with the 
specific gravity of one topsoil, B-T-l, being 2.U. fhen warm this parti¬ 
cular topsoil also emits the unmistakeable odor of decaying organic 
material. Thus, the author believes that the specific gravities of 
topsoils give an indication of the relative amount of organic material 
present. 

2. GRAIN SIZE CURVES 

Grain size analyses were made on the soils, A-T-l, B-T-l, 
and B-S-l. These results are shown in Figures 17 to 19. A. Casagrande 
states that the critical diameter of particles so far as frost heave 
danger is concerned is 0.02 mm. If the amount of these particles is less 
than 1 per cent, no heave is to be expected, while considerable heaves 
may take place if this amount is over 3 and over 10 per cent, in the case 
of nonuniform and very uniform soils, respectively. The following table. 
Figure 51, shows the per cent finer than 0.02 mm. for the three soils.

Figure 5l 

The topsoil, A-T-l, Is a nonuniform material, predominantly 
a silt-sand. The percentage finer than 0.02 mm. indicates that the soil 
is very susceptible to frost. However, the compacted material must possess 
a fair permeability if frost heave is to occur.

The topsoil B-T-l is a fairly uniform soil, predominantly a 
clay-silt. The percentage finer than 0.02 mm. indicates that this soil 
might also be very susceptible to frost action. However, permeability 
computations from the consolidation tests for the material compacted at 
both standard and modified Proctor indicate that the rate of flow of 
water would be too slow to permit ice segregation* 

The subsoil B-S-l is a uniform clay-silt, with 56 per cent 
finer than 0.02 mm. The coefficient of permeability as computed from the 
consolidation test for standard Proctor density is fairly low, thus 
eliminating the possibility of frost heave* 

3. ATTERBERG LIMIT TEST RESULTS 

The results of the Atterberg limit test a.re tabulated in 
Figure liu The liquid limit and plasticity index of each soil are 
plotted on the Plasticity Chart, Figure 15* 

In general the soils tested plot above the A-line in the 
C I group of soils. The soils A-T-l, A-S-l, C-T-l, and B-T-l do not 
plot above the A-line, thus indicating sandy silts or the presence of 
organic colloids. 

The C I group of soils are inorganic clays of medium 
plasticity and comp res sibil ity, with medium to high dry strength. These 
soils are practically impervious. 

The soils A-T-l and A-S-l plot in the soil groups ML-OL, 
being sandy silts, with slight to medium dry strength, and low compressi¬ 
bility. 

The topsoil C-T-l plots just below the A-line, due probably 
to the presence of organic material. Its physical characteristics would 
compare to those of the soils in the C I group. 

The topsoil B-T-l also plots below the A-line in the groups

MH-OH. The soil B-T-l is thus an organic silt clay, with high compressi¬ 
bility. Its dry strength is fairly low and it is practically impervious 
to the flow of water. The distinctive odor of decomposing organic 

i 

material is very strong when a wet sample jb f this topsoil is heated. 

The compressibility is approximately proportional to the 
liquid limit. With soils having the same liquid limit, the toughness and 
dry strength increase and the permeability and compressibility decrease 
as the plasticity index increases. Thus the soil with the higher plasti¬ 
city index is usually more suitable for fill construction. 

A. Casagrande makes the following statement: n An important 
property of all fine-grained organic soils is the radical drop in plasti¬ 
city due to oven-drying. This is due to the fact that organic colloids 
are very sensitive and undergo irreversible changes upon drying. Oven¬ 
drying also affects the limits of inorganic soils, but to a much more 
limited extent.” He cites an example of an organic clay where the liquid 
limit dropped from Qh to $1 and the plasticity index from 3k to 9 upon 
oven-drying of the soil. Thus it is not advisable to dry soil samples 
before performing the limit tests. 

The shrinkage limits of the soils tested range from 12 to 
20, with one exception; the topsoil B-T-l having a shrinkage limit of 
31.5 per cent. This high value of the shrinkage limit of B-T-l is quite 
significant, since it is not likely that the field moisture content of 
the embankment will ever be much higher than 30 per cent. Thus this 
topsoil would not exhibit any appreciable swelling or shrinkage. The 
remaining soils have much lower shrinkage limits and very possibly would 
exhibit appreciable swelling and shrinkage. 

The position of a soil on the Plasticity Chart provides 
considerable information about its physical properties when in place.

This information has been summarized in Figure 16, 

The author believes that if a topsoil and subsoil from the 
same place are in the same general soil group, they have quite similar 
physical properties* This statement is partly borne out by the fact 
that the topsoil and subsoil from location A have comparable optimum 
moisture contents, maximum densities and shearing strengths* These 
properties are quite different for the topsoil and subsoil from location 
B. A-T-l and A-S-l belong to the soil groups, ML-OL. The topsoil B-T-l 
belongs to the groups, MH-OH. The subsoil B-S-l belongs to an entirely 
separate group, C I. 

U. PROCTOR DENSITY TEST RESULTS 

The Proctor density test curves are shown in Figures 20 to 
23, and the results of these tests are tabulated in Figure 2lw 

The topsoil and subsoil of location A have comparable 
compaction properties, the optimum moisture content and maximum dry 
density being similar for the two soils. Also significant is the fact 
that the above properties of the two soils are almost identical with 
modified Proctor compaction. 

As expected from the classification test results, the com¬ 
paction characteristics of the topsoil, B-T-l, are quite different from 
those of the subsoil, B-S-l. The organic material in the topsoil resists 
the compactive effort, explaining the resulting low maximum density* 
Because of these great differences, it was decided to compare other pro¬ 
perties of the two soils. The stress and deformation properties of the 
two soils from the location A were also determined because of their 
similar compaction properties. 

The topsoil F-T-l belongs to the C I group of soils. There¬ 
fore, one might expect a modified Proctor dry density of 110 to 115 lbs. 
per cu. ft., similar to the two soils, B-S-l and C-S-l* However, this

dry density is only 97 lbs. per cu. ft. In performing the classification 
tests, only the material passing a No. I4O sieve was used. This soil 
appears to have been taken from a cultivated field, as visual observation 
disclosed the presence of large amounts of straw. This probably accounted 
for the relatively low density, as material used in the Proctor test had 
to pass only a sieve. 

5 . TRIAXIAL COMPRESSION TEST RESULTS 

During construction of an embankment the water content of 
the clay remains practically unchanged. Therefore, the shearing resis¬ 
tance of such clays immediately after construction corresponds to that 
determined from quick-shear tests, made on samples at the water content 
that the clay will have in the finished embankment immediately after 
construction. If the material contains air, as is usually the case in 
highway embankments, the shearing resistance increases with increasing 
normal stress. 

Therefore, in this laboratory study, the shear characteris¬ 
tics of the soils from locations A and B have been determined by 
quick-shear tests. 

The stress-strain curves and Mohr circles are plotted in 
Figures 25 to 33 , the results being tabulated in Figure 3 h* 

From this data, it is apparent that modified Froctor compac¬ 
tion as compared to standard Proctor compaction results in an increase of 
from 65 to 220 per cent in the cohesion and an increase of from 30 to 210 
per cent in the angle of internal friction. In highway embankments, 
where the fill is usually not over 10 feet, the resulting confining 
pressure is approximately 0.5 tons per sq. ft. as a maximum. 


In the following table, Figure 52 , the shearing strengths 
have been evaluated by use of the following formulae obtained from the

q u = unconfined compressive strength 
s u = unconfined shearing strength 

It must be remembered that the values of q and s tabula¬ 
ted in Figure 52 are the ultimate compressive and shearing strengths, 
respectively. 

In other words, no attempt has been made to take into account 
the compressibility of the material in place. Repetitive field bearing 
tests, approximately actual highway loading, should permit an estimate of 
the detrimental deflections in the subgrade. It is the opinion of the 
author that the results of these bearing tests could then be correlated 
with the moduli of deformation or other quantitative results of traxial 
compression tests.

From a study of the results of Figure 52, the folio-wing 
conclusions are apparent: 

(a) The shearing strength of the sandy silt topsoil A-T-l, compac¬ 
ted at standard Proctor, is approximately 125 per cent of the shearing 
strength of the sandy silt subsoil A-S-l, compacted at standard Proctor. 

(b) The shearing strength of A-T-l, compacted at modified Proctor, 
is approximately 65 per cent of the shearing strength of A-S-l, compacted 
at modified Proctor. 

(c) The shearing strength of A-T-l, compacted at modified Proctor, 
is approximately 225 per cent of the shearing strength of A-S-l, com¬ 
pacted at standard Proctor. 

(d) The shearing strength of the highly organic clay topsoil 
B-T-l, compacted at standard Proctor is approximately 60 per cent of 
the shearing strength of the silt-clay subsoil B-S-l, compacted at 
standard Proctor. 

(e) The shearing strength of B-T-l, compacted at modified Proctor, 
is approximately 55 per cent of the shearing strength of B-S-l, compacted 
at modified Proctor. 

(f) The shearing strength of B-T-l, compacted at modified Proctor, 
is approximately 120 per cent of the shearing strength of B-S-l, compac¬ 
ted at standard Proctor. 

(g) An increase of the compactive effort from standard to modified 
Proctor, results in the following percentage increases in shearing 
strength, as listed in Figure 53•

(c) An increase of approximately 25>0 per cent in the modulus of

(d) A small decrease in the degree of saturation of the sandy

(e) No change in the degree of saturation of the organic clay 
topsoil, B-T-l. 

(f) A considerable decrease in the degree of saturation of the 
subsoils* 

It must be remembered that the modulus of deformation 
permits only an estimate of the deformation due to shearing stresses 
in the material. An attempt is made to evaluate the deformation due 
to compressibility in the discussion of the results of the consolida¬ 
tion tests. 

In the Department of Transport publication, "Airport 
Runway Evaluation in Canada", by Dr. N. McLeod, design curves for 
highway wheel loadings are presented. In the following table, Figure 
55 * the required thicknesses of granular base are listed as determined 
using the values of the angles of internal friction of Figure 3k 9 and 
a wheel load of 7*500 lbs.

Correlation of the results of Figure 55 to the shearing 
strengths and moduli of deformation of Figures 52 and 5^ is just not 
possible. Since these design curves were determined by the use of 
plate bearing tests, one would expect correlation to the strength and 
deformation properties of the soil* 

6 . CALIFORNIA BEARING RAT IO TEST R ES ULTS 

The C.B.R* curves are shown in Figures 37 to 39* Results 
of the C.B.R* tests have been tabulated in Figure UO. 

The C.B.R* test is a penetration shear test used to 
determine a modulus of the shearing resistance of soils* Thus it 
should not be used where factors other than the shearing resistance 
control the design. 

The U. S. Waterways Experiment Station recently concluded 
an investigation of the C.B.R. method of design of flexible pavements. 
The results are published in the Manual, n The California Bearing Ratio 
Test as Applied to the Design of Flexible Pavements for Airports' 1 . 

From the conclusions of this report, the author believes that, at the 
present time, C.B.R. tests on remolded samples would not provide an 
answer to the question of whether or not topsoils can be used in highway 
embankments for the following reasons: 

(a) Wide variations in C.B.R. test results on compacted material 
occur. These variations are caused primarily by the effects of water 
content, density and type of compaction used in preparing samples; small 
changes in density and molding water content greatly affecting the C.B.R. 
value. 

(b) Since the molding water content greatly affects the physical 
properties of soils, it follows that, in remolded soils, duplicate 
laboratory samples cannot be prepared, unless the same molding water

content and method of compaction are duplicated, even though water content 
and densities obtained subsequent to molding are duplicated. 

(c) C.B.R. tests on natural undisturbed samples and on remolded 
samples with the same molding water content, moisture conditions, den- 
sity and physical properties that will occur during and after construc¬ 
tion are recommended. However, the laboratory study indicated a marked 
difference in the physical properties of a soil prepared by different 
compaction methods in the laboratory, and it can be assumed that these 
differences occur when the soil is compacted by different methods in 
the field. 

(d) Stress-penetration curves of compacted laboratory samples are 
generally concave upward for the range from approximately 0 to 0.2 
inches of penetration. The manual recommends correcting such stress- 
penetration curves. A curve of this type and the correction is shown 
in Figure 38 . The resulting increase in the soaked C.B.R. value due to 
the correction is almost 90 per cent. It Is the author 1 s opinion that 
this correction is possibly not warranted. From the set of empirical 
design curves, for a wheel load of 7*500 lbs., published in the U. S. 
Waterways Experiment Station Manual, the resulting decrease in thick¬ 
ness of base course and pavement is about 10 inches, which decrease 
represents a considerable saving in construction costs. 

From the data of Figure hO the following significant 
conclusions are apparent: 

(a) The organic clay topsoil, when compacted at standard Proctor, 
actually consolidates under the weight of the soaking surcharge. This 
surcharge approximates a 6-inch thickness of base course and surface. 

(b) The topsoil compacted at modified Proctor and the subsoil 
compacted at standard Proctor exhibit the same swelling under the weight 
of the soaking surcharge.

The results of Figures 56 and 57 definitely indicate that 
the organic clay topsoil cannot be used directly under the base course. 
There would seem to be no objection to placing the topsoil in the bottom 
of the fill, provided the compressibility is not excessive.

topsoil, B-T-l and the silt-clay, B-S-l, are tabulated in Figure Ul,

The following conclusions are drawn from these results; 

(a) The expansion upon freezing cannot be correlated to the mois¬ 
ture content, the density, or the void ratio of the material in place* 

(b) As might be expected, this expansion does bear a relation to 
the degree of saturation of the material, since the degree of satura¬ 
tion is the ratio of the volume of water to the volume of voids. Mien 
this ratio is low, there is no expansion of the soil mass upon freezing. 
Instead, the expansion of the water upon freezing takes place in the 
large air space. Mien this ratio is high, all of the expansion cannot 
take place in the available air space and an increase in the volume of 
the soil mass must result. 

(c) Soaking the sample results in an increase of the degree of 
saturation and accordingly, an increase in the expansion of the soil 
mass upon freezing, 

(d) The higher compactive effort, modified as compared to standard 
Proctor, results in an increase of the expansion of the soil mass upon 
freezing. This is also expected, since the higher compactive effort 

is effective in reducing the volume of air voids, available for expan¬ 
sion to occur in. 

In general, it would seem that the topsoil is not as 
desirable a material as the subsoil, from the standpoint of the effects 
of freezing. 

8. MOISTURE CONTENT-COMPRESSIVE STRENGTH RELATIONSHIPS 

The U. S. Waterways Experiment Station in their publication, 
"Triaxial Shear Research and Pressure Distribution Studies on Soils", has 
succeeded in obtaining a fairly consistent relation between final water 
content and compressive strength of saturated undisturbed clays. This 
relation shows the characteristic shape of a pressure-void ratio curve,

and is approximately parallel to the consolidation test curve. In the 
investigation of compacted soils, the Waterways Experiment Station 
arrived at the following conclusions: 

(a) The compressive strengths for tests under different lateral 
pressures, when plotted against water content at end of test, do not 
fall on, or close to, a single curve. The test points fall on curves 
or in groups that are displaced for each different lateral pressure. 

(b) The compressive strengths from quick and quick-consolidated 
tests under comparable conditions are not affected by the type of test. 

In other words the average results of quick and quick-consolidated tests 
are the same. 

In this laboratory study, the author performed unconfined 
compression tests on soaked samples of the topsoil, B-T-l, compacted at 
optimum standard and modified Proctor. The compression test specimens 
were allowed to dry to varying degrees of moisture content, thus resulting 
in varying values of the compressive strength. The results are shown in 
Figures 1*2 and 1*3# A study of these curves discloses the following: 

(a) The moisture content compressive strength curves are not paral¬ 
lel to the consolidation test curves. 

(b) A break in the moisture content-compressive strength curve 
occurs at approximately 28 per cent moisture content. The shrinkage 
limit of the topsoil, B-T-l, is 31*5 per cent. It is quite possible 
that the shrinkage limit had decreased to 28 per cent, when the compres¬ 
sion tests were performed, because of the progressive decomposition of 
the organic matter in the topsoil. This break in the curve at the 
shrinkage limit can be explained by theory if the effect of progressive 
drying from above the shrinkage limit is considered, A. Warlam obtained 
similar results in his thesis for a Ph.D. degree from Harvard University. 

(c) The compressive strength of the topsoil compacted at modified

Proctor for a moisture content of 26.6 per cent checks with the uncon¬ 
fined compressive strength result of Figure 3b * This value of 26*6 per 
cent is below the shrinkage limit* 

(d) The compressive strength of the topsoil compacted at standard 
Proctor does not check with the unconfined compressive strength result 
of Figure 3b* However, if the portion of the curve beyond the shrinkage 

limit is projected back, the strength at 32*5 per cent moisture then 

the 

does check with^result of Figure 3b • 

This would seem to indicate that increasing degrees of 
saturation result in a rapidly increasing rate of decrease of the shearing 
strength* 

It would also indicate that if the degree of saturation 
or moisture content does not increase, the portion of the curve to the 
left of the shrinkage limit is not correct. Instead a straight line 
relationship on serai-logarithmic paper exists* 

(e) An increase in the compactive effort from standard to modified 
Proctor results in an increase of the strength. As the material dries 
the percentage increase in shearing strength, because of the higher 
compactive effort, gradually increases* 

9. CONSOLIDATION TEST RESULTS 

The pressure-void ratio and time-consolidation curves are 
plotted in Figures UU to h9, the results being tabulated in Figure 50. 

A study of these results discloses the following: 

(a) The compressive index of the topsoil, B-T-l, compacted at 
standard Proctor is approximately 50 per cent higher than the compressive 
index when compacted at modified Proctor. 

(b) This compressive index of the topsoil compacted at modified 
Proctor is approximately equal to the compressive index of the subsoil 
compacted at standard Proctor. 

(c) The swelling pressure of the topsoil compacted at standard

Proctor is approximately equal to the swelling pressure when compacted 
at modified Proctor, both values being very low. 

(d) The swelling pressure of the subsoil compacted at standard 
Proctor is quite high, being approximately 10 times the swelling pres¬ 
sures of the topsoil for both standard and modified Proctor compaction. 

The weight of a fill increases the pressure on a confined 
stratum of soil from the overburden pressure p Q to the value p Q + £p. 
The corresponding void ratio decreases from e 0 to e. Then the compres¬ 
sion S of the confined stratum is

where H = thickness of the bed of soil

For the purpose of comparing the topsoil compacted at 
both standard and modified Proctor and the subsoil compacted at standard 
Proctor, let us assume identical loading conditions for each and equal 
values of H. The quantity 

P 0 + Ap 

H log — —- is thus constant for the three

cases. 

Therefore, S = 



Comparing the topsoil compacted at modified Proctor and 
the subsoil compacted at standard Proctor, the values of C c are almost 
identical for both so that the compression S is thus inversely propor¬ 
tional to the void ratio. The topsoil possesses the greater void ratio,

and accordingly the compression of this soil will be appreciably less 
than that of the subsoil. 

Comparing the topsoil and subsoil compacted at standard 
Proctor, the compressive index of the topsoil is almost 3>0 per cent 
higher than the compressive index of the subsoil, while the void ratio 
of the topsoil is almost 5>0 per cent higher than that of the subsoil 
for all pressures within the straight line portions of the pressure- 
void. ratio curves. The net result is that the compression of the both 
soils will be almost equal.

CONCLUSIONS 


1. In general, this laboratory study would indicate that 
organic topsoils may be placed in an embankment, provided they are 
compacted to a density approximating maximum modified Proctor density. 

In order to satisfy the design requirements of the C.B.H. test, the 
material should be placed in the bottom of the fill. This procedure is 
very practical, since the topsoil is the first soil to be handled in 
building the grade, 

2. The physical properties of the topsoil, when compacted at 
a density slightly lower than that of maximum modified Proctor density, 
would have values somewhere between the values obtained for maximum 
standard and maximum modified Proctor density. The results of this 
laboratory study would indicate that such a deviation from maximum den¬ 
sity is permissible. However, this deviation should be held to a minimum, 

3. The effects of decomposition of the organic matter have not 
been studied. It is quite possible that the compressibility of a highly 
organic topsoil in an embankment may increase as decomposition of the 
organic matter occurs. Also, at the present time, it is not known how 
closely the physical properties of laboratoiy samples correspond to those 
of the material in place. 

U* Incidental to the main problem., the following conclusions 

are also drawn: 

(a) The specific gravity of a topsoil gives an indication of the 
amount of organic material present. 

(b) The position of a topsoil or subsoil on the Plasticity Chart

provides considerable information as to its physical properties. 
Highly organic topsoils have very low densities and fairly 
high optimum moisture contents. The organic material resists 
the compactive effort. 

An increase in compactive effort from standard to modified 
Proctor results in an increase of both the cohesion and angle 
of internal friction, these increases varying with the type 
of soil. The cohesion is the dominant factor in the shearing 
strength of highway embankments. 

An increase in the compactive effort from standard to modified 
Proctor results in an approximate increase of 100 per cent in 
the shearing strength. 

An increase in the compactive effort from standard to modified 
Proctor results in no appreciable change of the shearing deforma¬ 
tion characteristics of a topsoil. A considerable improvement 
results in the case of a silt or clay subsoil. 

The C.B.R. test definitely indicates the impossibility of econo¬ 
mically using a highly organic topsoil directly under the base 
course and pavement. At the present time, it would seem that 
there are too many variables associated with the test to permit 
its use for the purpose of design, 

A relationship does exist between the moisture content at the 
end of the test and the shearing strength of compacted soils, 

A definite break in this relation occurs at a moisture content 
approximately equal to the shrinkage limit. As a soil compacted 
at optimum moisture content dries, the shearing strength rapidly 
increases. There must be some point beyond which the shearing 
strength does not increase any more. 

The swelling pressures exerted by compacted highly organic 
topsoils are relatively low.

(j) An increase in the compactive effort from standard to modi¬ 
fied Proctor is very effective in decreasing the compressi¬ 
bility of a highly organic topsoil.

RECOMMENDATION FOR FURTHER STUDIES 


Further investigation is necessary to determine the effects 
of time on highly organic topsoils. This should be possible by correla¬ 
ting field tests to a laboratory study. 

It is the opinion of the author that this investigation 
should include: 

1. A soil survey program along existing highways. This survey 
should be concentrated chiefly within apparent general failure 
zones. 

2. Field density and moisture content determinations. 

3. A laboratory study on: 

(a) Undisturbed samples of both the topsoil and subsoil 
from apparent failure zones. 

(b) Disturbed samples of both the topsoil and subsoil from 
locations corresponding to the undisturbed samples. 

II. The construction of test sections and observation of the effects 
of traffic, time, and climatic conditions on these sections. 

By means of classification and strength tests, correlation 
of the field and laboratory study should be possible. Once this correla¬ 
tion has been obtained, it will be necessary to perform classification 
and strength tests on only disturbed samples from the proposed right-of- 
way. It may be that classification tests alone will provide the answer 
to the question of using organic topsoils in highway embankments.
