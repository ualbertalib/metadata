C papulation g.nd Su rfa c e Losses la Dispersejayat©mg 
In Still and Tu rbulent Air. 

Extensive studies have 'been made of' the ageing of 
disperse systems consisting of solid or liquid substances 

Sti// 

in a finely divided state in,air,such as smolc©©,dusts, 
and fogs,(lor general discussions of aerosols see refer¬ 
ences 13,15,16*) It has been round(6,10,11,13,16) that 
the Increase in particulate volume ( X/ni with tine (i)

where n denotes the -number of particles per c*c* at tim©

not extend v eyond ageing tiroes of 100 minutes but it has 
been stated (1that the linear relation given by equat¬

equation (1) can be developed on the basis that coagulat¬ 
ion is the sole factor responsible for the decrease In 
particle number of an aerosol with time it has been cust¬ 
omary to interpret it as the coagulation constant. It is 
noteworthy that the values of 1 determined in this way 
are considerably greater than that for an ideal aerosol 
as calculated from a modified form of Bm& lochowsKi' s 
theory of coagulating: sols (2,3,10,16,also see appendix).

uence of the assumption that coagulation is the sole 
factor responsible lor particle number reduction^and exp¬ 
erimentally previous Investigators have found this quan¬ 
tity to decrease with time. These two factors indicate ^ 
that surface losses ar© of importance even in still air. 

The ageing of aerosols in turbulent air has received 
comparatively little attention. The results of studies 
that have been made (4,12) do not lend themselves readily 
to interpretation in terms of fundamental processes bec¬ 
ause of the difficulty of translating Tyndall beam bright¬ 
ness data to terms of particle number and size. Except in 
specially designed laboratory experiments however,problems 
Involving turbulent air conditions are most often encount¬ 
ered . 

In a confined space the decrease In particle number 

of an aerosol is due to coagulatIon,sedimentation,and lose 
Q r those particles which at laic to the various surfaces. 

In the attempt to obtain a better understanding of the 
relative Importance of these factors p studies have been 
made of ammonium chloride smoke under various controlled 
degrees of air motion ranging from the static condition 
upward. The changes In the mass of dispersed material and

particle number) were followed for 330 minutes under each 
set of conditions. Nona of the data for these long periods 


including the data for still air,could be interpreted on 
the basis that coagulation was the sol© factor responsible 
for the reduction in particle number. They are described 
however by equations developed from general postulates 
involving loss to the surfaces (which includes sediment¬ 
ation) as well as coagulation. The equations permit an 
analytical separation of the effects produced by coagul¬ 
ation and loss to adjacent surfaces,and are consistent 
with fact in the various points for watch a comparison 
has been possible. In particular the equations yield the 
’mass loss constant 1 ,the’loss constant] t and the coagulat¬ 
ion constant descriptive respectively of the decrease in- 
mass of dispersed material,the loss of particles to sur¬ 
faces,and the loss of particles due to coagulation. Changes 
in the degree of air motion alter the values of these 
constants and hence the effect of air motion on the factors 
involved in the ageing process may be described by plots 
of the values of the constants vs some index of the degree 
of air motion. This analysis has been facilitated by the 
wide range of conditions and the long observation times 
employed;it would have been difficult to achieve with the 
data previously reported by other workers for at .otic air 
conditions and relatively short observation times.

pose A since they do not Involve the effect of surface losses. 

' 

The following considerations which do Involve such losses 
load to a quantitative description of our experimental data,; 

An aerosol in turbulent air Is brought constantly 
into contact with various surfaces,and since practically 
all particles striking a surface stick to It (5*and the 
present data) there is a consequent decrease in mass con¬ 
centration and partial© number. Under a given set of con¬ 
ditions,ib© mass or dispersed material that comes into con- 
tact with a surface per unit time (and so Is lost to the 
system) should be proportional to the m &as concentration

as will appear later this relation Is in agreement with 
our data and receives strong support xroa other sources.

of large particles favors high sedimentation loss. Particle 
size is subject to change during the ageing of an aerosol, 
and strictly speaking k and 3 are in general functions of 
time.

may be neglected,it follows on Integration cf equation (6)

The reduction in particle number per c.c, due to coagul¬ 
ation in the Interval from 0 to t denoted by (An)- is 


evidently given by 

(An) e = (n - n ) 


(An), 


= (n 0 - n ) -( 3/ k) In p_(). 


A close relationship may be expected to exist between 
the loss constant P and the mass loss constant a. If the 
average mass of the particles in the aerosol and those in 
lost to surfaces at a given time be denoted tey/* and/^ 
respectively,the mass concentration may be written ae 
m =/c n and its rate of change as dm/dt =y^/(dr/dt) .

am zzyct'fin

i.e. a/p ; __ __(10), 

//tn ce for a homogeneous aerosol a and p should 

be equal. 


The mechanisms responsible for the observed decrease 
in mass concentration and particle number in still air 
may involve sedimentation,diffusion of particles to sur¬ 
faces, convection currents set up by temperature gradients, 
and disturbances caused In sampling, whatever the mechan¬ 
isms may be it seems reasonable to assume that under given 













- 3 - 




conditions the loss rate o t particles is proportional to 
n as specified by equation (4;,and that the loss rate of 
Ease la proportional to 21 as specified by equation (2 j. 

On this basis equations (2) to ,10) should be equally 
applicable to still or turbulent air conditions. This ex - 
setat ion la borne out by the agreement of experimental 
data with these equations d to 7. 


It might be thought at first sight that the mechan¬ 
isms of loss In still and turbulent air have little In 
common,since Ir: general,sedimentation velocity is negl¬ 
igibly small compared to the air velocity In turbulence. 
The former is however superimposed on the latter,and the 
time average of the latter Is zero. Consequently a tenden¬ 
cy for material to be deposited most densely on the sur¬ 
face below the aerosol must be expected f and is found in 
experiments* 


Although a sedimentation theory has been worked out 
for the case of 1 non-absorbing 1 walls (2),it Is not applic¬ 
able In this case since practically all the'smoke particles 
stick to the walls on contact. An idea of the importance 
of diffusion ns a mechanism of loss in still air may be 
gained from a consId©ration of the diffusion of homogen¬ 
eous non-coagulating particles to the 1 absorbing wails* 
of a spherical chamber of radiusA> In the absence of

type developed for the purpose (see appendix III ). The 
time-average air speeds at different points in tne cham¬ 
ber determined with this instrument in a series of prel¬ 
iminary experiments were remarkably similar and were prop¬ 
er! lonal to the oscillation frequency of the stirrer (fig.3) 
axcept for points very close to the corners. Since the 
oscillation frequency was maintained constant throughout 
an experiment,the value of the mean air speed V (ai/min.) 
for the given frequency,averaged over representative points 
in the chamber,should give a good estimate of the degree 
of air motion during the experiment. The mean curve for the 
air speed vs frequency plots of fig,3$ was used in exper¬ 
iments with smoke to assign the space-average value of V 
appropriate to the oscillation frequency used.

In some oi the earlier experiments aerosol sa,sales 
were diluted with air before precipitation in order to 
reduce the pert;tele number and thus facilitate counting. 
The method of dilution consisted .of drawing 35 : u c.c„ of 
the aerosol into a bell Jar■containIning 3.5 liters of 


air and mixing with one or tw.o strokes of a stirrer! see 
-Ig.lQ v. The diluted aerosol was then sampled, and the 
particulate volume of the.original was calculated taking 
into account the d HutLon • factor-. This method gave rel¬

and two with a high degree of air motion (V»50 ssi/mln.)

were performed to provide information on particle size 
distribution. Thermal precipitator samples were taken 
©very 30 minutes for a period of 2So minutes, the deposits 
were examined withjsubatage illumination and a magnificat¬ 
ion of 95QX, (1.8 J5m.objective and a 10 & eyepiece). The 
particles in crosswise strips selected as for particle 
number counts were classified into size groups by compar¬ 
ing them with the smallest square in the Whipple disc 
(projected area 2.2 x2,2 microns). If a particle appeared 
to fill the square its apparent radius was taken to be 
1.1 microns. Since this procedure is based on the appearance, 
in two dimensions it may be subject to systematic error. 

The size groups adopted were; less than 0.3, 0.3-0*6, 

0,6-0.9, 0,9-1.1, 1.1-1.4, 1.4-1.f, and i.f-2.2 microns 
to apparent radius. In the results shown in fig.12 the 
number in each size group expressed as a percentage of the 
total has been plotted at the median radius for the group, 
that for the first being plotted at 0.2 microns.

for 3 minutes longer. It was turned off t hen and the stir¬ 
rer set in oscillation and maintained at the selected osc¬ 
illation frequency. All subsequent times were reckoned 
$*o>n a zero set at the moment of turning off the fan. Part¬ 
icle number and mass concentration samples were taken at 
intervals of 30 mins, for a period of 5*5 Hours (see tables 
I and la ). Counts were made for the former Immediately 
since dust settling on the glass disc© interfered with tne 
counting. Furthermore the apparent number of particles 
decreased due to deliquescence if the deposits were left 
for a few hours, the mass concentration samples were usu¬ 
ally analysed at any time within a period of 24 hours 
sine© the analysis did not change with time If the tube® 
were well stoppered. The total volume drawn from the cham¬ 
ber during flushing and sampling did not exceed 1.7,-.'Of 
the chamber volume, A aeries of experiments was performed 
with various degrees of air motion (see table© I and la ). 
After each the chamber was well aired and cleaned. 

It was noted that the deposit on the bottom of the 

• ' ■ . : - ■ ? 

chamber was visibly greater than that on the top and side 

walls under still air conditions. Furthermore,the distrib¬ 
ution of the deposit was similar with stirred air,although 
under this condition the stirrer acquired a deposit comp¬ 
arable to that on the bottom of the chamber.

A series of special experiments was performed to 
investigate the extent to which particles deposited on the 
walls were swept off again by the air motion. The proced¬ 
ure was identical with that described above except that all 

surfaces exposed to the aerosol ware coated heavily with 

tuts 

Oil. ainee subsidiary A showed that particles striding the 
the surface were wet Immediately it seems reasonable to 
assume that, the return of particle© to the aerosol was 
eliminated in these experiments, 

3* Experimental Data, 

In tables I and la are given particulate volume i 1/n) 
and mass concentration (ml data descriptive of ageing un¬ 
der various degrees of air motion as specified by the index 
V (m/rnln,). The symbols 038,040,etc. ,refer to the serial 
numbers of experiments. Time® {t in minute® ) were reckoned 
fro© a zero ta&en 3 minutes after the completion of smoite 
generation. The values in the columns headed n calc. 11 were 
obtained from equation (?). In table© II and Ha are given 
particulate volume and mass concentration data obtained 
for the experiment© in which the chamber walls were wet 
with. oil. It le considered desirable to give the experim¬ 
ental data rather fully since the Interpretation differs 
fundamentally from that given previously by various workers 
for data covering a more restricted range.

Estimates of the oarticle size distribution at 
various times In the lives of the aerosols,as obtained in 
a series of subsidiary experiments ,are shown in fig.12. 
Each curve is based on the average of two sets of data 
that were in acceptable agreement, 

4. Analysis of the Data , 

Particulate volume vs time plots in the manner of 
previous workers are shown in fig,12,for some of the data 
They are not described by equation (1), Even for still al: 
the curve exhibits a concavity upward,although for a peri 
of about 200 minute© it is acceptably linear. The initial 
portion of the curve (for still air) has a slop© f eorrespo 
ding to a K value of 5,1 x e.c./ min. as def ined by 

equation (1),compared to values ranging from 2.0 x 10“^ t 
7.9 x 1Q~ c.c./min. obtained for ammonium chloride smoke 
by previous workers (6,10,11,16 p.46). 

Plots of log (a) ve time as Illustrated in fig.14 
were found to be linear for all degrees of air motion ovc 
the Investigated range. It is noteworthy that fatson and 
Sibler (14) have reported that Tyndall meter readings foi 
various types of fanned smokes decrease exponentially wit 
time. In addition some mass concentration data for still 
air found in the literature,when plotted similarly,provie 
further support, Mot only are the plots linear but their

slopes are strikingly similar. For example the data for 
two zinc oxide smokes studied by fhytlaw-Gr&y and Speakman 
(17) yield a*mass loss constant f (defined by equation (2) 
and (3) ) of 3.6 x 1G~ 5 mln.“ 1 on disregarding the first 
point In each which is stated to be erroneous,while somo 
data for an ammonium chloride smoke (16 p.19 ) give a value 
of 3.0 x 10*^ min,” 1 In comparison our own data for still 
air yield values of from 3.2 x 10*^ to 3.6 x 10*^ min.* 1 
(see table III). 

Following the suggestion of equation (?) it was 
found that plots of log (10^/n * £) vs time became linear 
on selection of a suitable value for the constant E by 
trial. Examples are shown In figs 15 and 16. The linearity 
of the curve was a fair criterion of the suitability of E 
for data associated with large V values,but was less crit~ 

| 

leal for plots of smaller slope. Under the worst conditions 
(still air data) a value of 6 or 7 produced linearity (fig. 
16),but higher values did not result In a noticeable con¬ 
cavity upward such as shown in fig.15. In these circum¬ 
stances a value of E was selected to produce linearity 
and to be consistent with other features to appear later. 
The loss constant 3 was calculated from the slopes of the 
curves,and the coagulation constant k N the values of E and 
3 (se© equation 7 ). The values of the constants for the 
entire data are given In table III.

Plots such as fig.15 and fig.16 may give an erroneous 

Impression of the experimental scatter since a constant has 

c. 

been added to each 10 /n value. For this reason particulate 
volumes as calculated from equation (7) using the data of 
table III have been included in tables I and II for compar¬ 
ison with observation. The observed values were in fairly 
good agreement with the calculated values; the average 
[deviation for the more than 200 determlnations given was 
16.2%. This is comparable to the scatter of determined 
points about linear 1/n vs time curves obtained by previous 
workers for still air and ageing times of 100 minutes. 
[Published data (10,6,11) exhibit average deviations of about 
5% ,4%, and ?%, and the overall frequency distribution of 

deviations is almost identical with that of the data' given 

' 

:tables I and II. It is considered therefore that equation 

j 

|(7) describes the entire particle number data as well as 
I may be expected in view of the difficulty of obtaining 
high precision in this type of aerosol work. 

A comparison of the results obtained with dry and 
with oiled chamber walls (fig. 17,18, and table III) shows 
*no marked difference. It is considered therefore that 
]particles once deposited were not removed from the dry 
jwalls to any serious extent.

Applications of equation (?) to the data for ©till 
air yield a value of 2.2 x 10 e.c./mln. for the constant 
k (table III). The Smolochowski coagulation constant for 
an ideal aerosol as calculated from equatIon(14) 1© 1.9 x 

10* * c.c./min. for particle® of 1 micron radius and 2,1 x 

a 

10 ’ o.c./mio. for particles of 0.5 microns radius.(dee 
fig.12). as previously stated the value of £ of equation (1) 
obtained from the early portion of i/n xfi time plots was 

ft . 

5,1 x 10* o.o./min. in agreement with the results of pre¬ 

vious investigators. 

lor a homogeneous aerosol the ratio of s/P should be 
unity'(equation 10). for a non-homogeneous aerosol loss of 
the heavier particles must be favored - in sedimentation 
when the air is at ill,and in deflections of air currents 
at surface© when the air is in motion, lieoc© q/p should 
b© greater than unity, but perhaps not so very much so If 
the particle 'sis® rang© la ©mail. Furthermore,both a and 

. tk& 

p may he expected to increase wlbh A rai@ at which air is 
brought into contact with surfaces,and it the particle-else 
distribution is not much altered (of A lg.12)*th©y should 
do-so In roughly the same proportion. Both these features 
are characteristic of the data, it is shown In fig.If that 

P is quite closely proportional u a regardless of the 
degree' of air motion. It is shown in table III that the 

ratio a /p iQ somewhat greater than unity. These facts

provide strong support for the ideas advanced previously, 
since (3 was determined analytically from particle number 
data^and a directly from an entirely independent set of 
mass concentration data. 



Fig.17: To Illustrate the similarity in the increases 

in a and p with increasing degree of air motion. 
The symbols • , and + , refer respectively to 
data obtained with dry and oiled chamber walls. 


Increased air motion is accompanied by an increase 
in the chance of collision of particles with one another, 

and in the chance of impact of particles on surfaces. Hence 
k , cx ,and p may be expected to Increase as the degree of air 

motion becomes greater. The manner in which they do is ill- 
ustrated graphically in fig.18 in which V (nv'min.) is used

In view of the wide range of condiclone investigated 
a- purely fortultuops agreement between the equations and 
tne lata appears highly unlikely* The equations au*t be 
regarded however as descriptive of a special case,i.e. that 
for which time variation In a«$,aod k,;iay be disregarded. 
They would not b© expected to apply,without modification, 
for example,to aerosols having a such smaller particle size. 


It follows fro® the ideas contained in section 2 
that the relative importance of coagulation and surface 
loss in the ageing process depends strongly on conditions. 
The importance of the former mechanism should be relatively 

great for particles with high particle number since the 

2 

rate of coagulation depends on a while the rat© of lose 

*- 

depends on n . Daring the life of an aerosol the relative 
Importance continually shifts to favor the latter mechanism. 
For tho conditions of the experiments described,the rates 
of disappearance and the total numbers removed by each 


ffijechaalam have been calculated for hypothetical aerosols 
(table I?) with the aid of equations 3,4,7,0,and with 

Constanta a© read from fig.IS* It has been assumed that

Instantaneous rates of coagulation (and loss; In nuaber/cc/ain 

























tho constants hold for amoices with initial n values as low 

as 10^ ec. -1 and as high as 8 * l(P cc.~S the experimental 

*5 5 — 1 

data cover the range 2 x 10 to 4 x 1-J cc. . The data of 

table IV illustrates the preceding predictions. It Indicate! 

that th© coagulation process should be of greater relative 

importance than the surface loss mechanism Initially in all 

experiments were the initial particle number was greater 
5 -1 

than about.3 x 10 cc. . although for such aerosols th© 
effect of both th© coagulation process and th© surface loss 
mechanism decrease with time, they do so in such a manner 
that the loss mechanism is the major factor after 5.5 hours, 
for aerosols with low initial particle number (less than 
2 x 10' cc. ) the surface loss mechanism should always be 
more effective tMn coagulation, furthermore It becomes 
relatively more important as these aerosols age. fable XV 

| 

also indicates th© increase in the coagulation and surface 
| effects with higher degrees of air motion. ( It should be 
noted that th© figures quoted above may be expected to 
apply only for aerosols having particle size distributions 
comparable to those obtaining in the experiments described 
In this tnesle.)

The results reported in this thesis were obtained 
under the direction of Dr.G.Q.bangstroth. His enthusiastic 
supervision of the research and his assistance in the 
jorganization of the results are greatly appreciated. 

I should like to express say thanks to Mr.i .hleave 
for his help with apparatus at various times. In particular 
we are indepted to him for blowing a dozen electrical 
precipitator tubes, 

I should also like to thank Mr.A.J.Stephenson and 
.M.Olyan for assistance with some of the experiments.

of an aerosol under at 111 air condit ions may be gained from 
a consideration of to® diffusion of homogeneous aon-coagul-

Measurement of_the_Degree of^Air^Motlon. 

In order to specify the degree of air motion in the 


preceding experiments It was necessary to determine some 

factor descriptive of It. Under completely chaotic condit- 

I 

ions ,the amount of air passing through any given small 

! 

volume in unit time,regardless of direct ion *would be a suit¬ 
able index of the degree of air motion. The various anemom¬ 
eters described in the literature are unsuitable for the 
determination of this quantIfcy,since those of the mechanical 
type measure the vector sum of air velocities,and those of 
the hot wire or thermocouple type give readings dependent 
to some extent on the direction of the air flow past them. 
The instrument developed to measure the desired quantity

Calibration of t he Instrument^ 

For calibration the instrument was mounted on a rev¬ 
olving arm driven by a raster with a reduction gear system, 
Electrical connections were made through mercury cups which 
served as slip rings* the rata of i low of air past the in¬ 
strument head was calculated from the measured number of 
revolutions of the arm per unit time,and the distance of 
the head from the axis of revolution* the speed of ■rotation 
was varied In steps over the range 1.8b to 75 revs./min., 
and the B.M.F. measured at each, the effect of changing the 
direction of air flow was investigated by varying the ori- 
entatlon of the instrument- head on the rotation arm* The 
directions of the air flow for. typical orientations of the 
instrument head ar® Indicated by the arrows in fig.22. the 
whole apparatus was enclosed In a 1.12 meter cube to protect 
it from stray air currents.- Typical results are shown in 
fig.a3. 

figaajXi- 

fixamination of fig.( 23 ) indicates that over the range 
investigated the readings of the instrument were practical¬ 
ly independent of the direction of the air flow past the 
head 4 

The time lag of the instrument was aaall. Subsidiary 
experiments showed that equilibrium was attained within 
one minute after an abrupt change in air velocity from 12

During dovelop*ment work Instruments of various 
designs ,including 3lngle coil types,were tested and were 
found to be uneulted to the purpose in mind,either because 
of excessive time-lag,marked directional properties,or botk. 
In particular,a decrease in the size of the head of the 
instrument described in this appendix,accomplished by brln 
bringing the heating coils closer together t resulted in son 
loss of directional properties.

The Coagulation Constant_for_an Ideal Aerosol. 

In order to calculate the coagulation constant for ai 
ideal homogeneous aerosol whose spherical particles stick 
on contact one could use the analysis developed by Smolo- 
chorski for the rapid coagulation of sols (see references 
10,16,3,2,on pagefYK Smolochowski showed that the probab 
ility of encounter between s particle and others in its 
neighborhood is ^7rhn(D^ + D g ),where n is the number of 
particles per e.c.,is* the diffusion coefficient of th 
particle and D a is the diffusion coefficient of the part¬ 
icle with which it collides,and 3 is the radius of the 
sphere of collision of two particles. The total number of 
collisions per unit time is therefore ^•4^3(D 1 ♦ I) s )n^ sc
