A METHOD FOB TEE ESTIMATION OF MILK LIPASE 


INTRODUCTION 

GENERAL 

In recent years a flavor defect of dairy products known 
as "Rancidity” has been receiving an increasing amount of 
attention* The main dairy products susceptible to this type 
of undesirable flavor are milk, cream, butter, whole milk 
powder, sweetened condensed milk and raw milk Cheddar cheese* 

In the Province of Alberta during certain seasons of the year 
as high as 20 % of the cream received at creameries exhibits 
this defect. The problem was referred to the University of 
Alberta Department of Dairying in 1943 because of the resulting 
loss to the cream producers and the lowering of butter quality. 
Since that time joint research on various aspects of rancidity 
has been carried on with the Department of Animal Science. 

The work reported in this thesis was undertaken to develop a 
method for the determination of the lipase content of or 
lipolytic activity in milk. It was also hoped that such a 
method might serve as a basis for modified methods for the 
determination of lipase and for the study of lipolysis in 
other dairy products and bacterial cultures.

THE NATURE OF RANCIDITY 

The deterioration of fats involving the development of 
undesirable flavors is an important problem in the food indus¬ 
tries in general. While this deterioration may involve both 
hydrolysis and oxidation, it has become customary for the 
public and many food chemists to refer to off-flavors in fats 
as a rancid flavor or to describe the condition as rancidity. 

In the dairy industry it is customary to reserve the term 
"rancid” for designation of the off-flavor caused by free 
fatty acids resulting from hydrolysis, and to designate the 
off-flavors resulting from oxidative changes "oxidized flavor” 
or "tallowy.” 

Milk fat differs from other naturally occurring fats 
in its high content of volatile fatty acids, especially butyric 
acid which does not occur in significant amounts in any other 
fat. Rancidity in dairy products is caused by hydrolysis of 
the milk fat with the release of free fatty acids which impart 
to the milk their characteristic unpleasant odors and flavors. 
This hydrolysis or lipolysis is brought about by the enzyme 
lipase. As some of the lower fatty acids in milk fat, par¬ 
ticularly butyric acid, have powerful and disagreeable odors, 
the presence of very small amounts of these acids may result 
in a rancid odor and flavor. 

The intensity of rancidity in milk is proportional to 
the amount of free fatty acids present and the terms used in 











- 3 - 

describing the flavor may vary from "unclean”, "cowy” and 
"goaty" to "bitter" or "rancid." It has been observed that 
rancid milk not only exhibits a disagreeable odor and a 
sharp, acrid or bitter taste, but also produces a peculiar 
throat irritation. Dunkley and Wood (1945) have suggested 
that the fatty acids of low molecular weight (butyric, 
oaproic and caprylic) are responsible for the characteristic 
arcrna, sharp taste and throat irritation, while the acids of 
higher molecular weight (capric and lauric) produce the 
bitter taste* 

In general, two types of rancidity caused by lipolysis 
of milk fat are now recognized* They are known as spon¬ 
taneous rancidity and activated rancidity. Spontaneous 
lipolysis is the type which develops in milk without any 
special treatments other than cooling. In induced lipolysis 
the system requires some special treatment or "activation" 
such as homogenization, vigorous agitation or a special 
temperature treatment. Such "activation" procedures may 
change the normal surface of the milk fat globules and in 
some manner make the fat more susceptible to lipolysis. 

Wide differences are observed in the susceptibility of 
milk to lipolysis or the development of the rancid defect. 

To explain such differences and if possible prevent milk 
from going rancid, two main problems concerning lipase have 
been studied by investigatorss 

(1) the factors that determine the initial amount of 
lipase secreted in the milk.

(2) the factors that influence the activity of the lipase 
secreted or the susceptibility of milk fat to lipolysis. 

It has been suggested that the period of lactation, the 
season of the year, the type of feed and other factors may 
affect the amount of lipase in milk. However, investi¬ 
gators are not in agreement on this phase of the problem. 

For example, while most workers agree that stage of lactation 
does influence rancidity, they are not agreed on the explanation. 
Palmer (1922), Hileman and Courtney (1935) and others have 
found that the amount of lipase tends to increase towards the 
end of lactation; while Herrington and Krukovsky (1939) and 
Mattick and Kay (1938) and others have found little or no 
such correlation. 

Dunkley (1946) has suggested that the increased suscepti¬ 
bility to rancidity of certain milks produced in late lacta¬ 
tion may be due to a change in the activity of the lipase caused 
by a change in the action of an enzyme inhibitor or activator, 
or that the butterfat has been altered in such a way as to 
favor more rapid lipolysis. Relatively large amounts of 
lipase may be present, but unless conditions are favorable 
for its activity it does not break down the fat. 

Castell (1942) has pointed out that many of the differences 
and contradictory statements in the literature will disappear 
when more consideration is given to differentiating between 
the amount of lipase present and the conditions which intensify

its activity. It is for the above reason that Castell defines 
rancidity as tf the product of lipase together with those 
particular conditions which permit the enzyme to function.”

THE NATURE OF LIPASE 

Milk normally contains lipase which is associated with 
the serum and the enzyme is believed to have at least two 
functions. Under certain conditions it may be involved in 
the synthesis of fat while under other conditions it may 
reverse this role the fat being hydrolyzed to form free fatty 
acids and glycerol. Lipase is produced by the living cell 
and is found not only in milk but in the liver, pancreas and 
blood serum of the body as well as in many plants, yeasts, 
moulds and bacteria. There are significant differences in 
the properties of lipases from different parts of the body 
or from different plants or micro-organisms. 

Very little is definitely known about the chemical consti¬ 
tution of the lipase or lipases in milk. The enzyme is at 
least partly protein in nature. The amount of lipase in milk 
may be very small and it has not been isolated as a pure 
substance. Sine© very few enzymes have been isolated, it 
has been customary to express their concentration in terms 
of their activity. The study of the lipase content of dairy 
products is complicated by various factors that influence the 
activity of the lipase that may be present. For example, 

Doraer and Widmer (1931) found that homogenization of raw 
milk greatly increased subsequent lipolysis. It has been 
shown by Krukovsky and Sharp (1938) that lipase may be acti¬ 
vated by shaking, particularly when the fat Is in the liquid

state. Herrington and Krukovsky (1939) found that lipolysis 
in cold milk is accelerated by warming the milk slightly and 
recooling. Several other factors such as pH, dissolved 
oxygen, traces of heavy metals, oxidizing and reducing agents 
and the presence of certain bacteria are believed to affect 
the activation of lipase. The lipolytic activity of lipase 
seems to be lost on proteolysis. Hylynka and Hood (1942) 
suggest that the tendency to produce a rancid flavor in 
Cheddar cheese is greatly decreased by increasing the 
proteolytic enzymes, pepsin or rennin, in making the cheese. 
Hetrick and Tracy (1948) have shown that the lipase of milk 
is inactivated by heat and this fact is of great practical 
significance. 

It has been suggested that there is more than one lipase 
in milk. Domer and Widmer reported the existence of two 
lipases in milk, one heat resistant to some degree and the 
other more heat labile. Herrington and Krukovsky found two 
lipases, one inhibited completely by small amounts Of formalin 
and the other apparently resista.nt to moderate amounts of 
formalin. Gould and Trout (1936) showed that there may be 
a difference in lipolysis of homogenized and non-homogenized 
raw milk. Lipolysis in homogenized milk was not reduced by 
fomalin or by traces of copper and this might be considered 
as evidence of two lipases. Peterson, Johnson and Price (1943) 
investigated the stability of the lipase system over a 12 hour

period at 0°C and concluded that two enzymes could be present 
and that the ratio of the two seemed to vary from cow to cow.

HISTORICAL 

Rice and Markley (1922) and Hileman and Courtney reviewed 
the early methods for the determination of lipase* According 
to Rice and Markley, Marfan (1901) was probably the first to 
report that experimental proof had been obtained of the presence 
of a lipolytic enzyme which splits monobutyrin in the milk of 
man and the cow. 

Between 1901 and 1909 several reports of investigations 
on the presence of lipolytic enzymes in milk and milk products 
appeared in the literature and are referred to by Rice and 
Markley. A great variety of substrates including simple esters 
as well as butterfat, cottonseed oil, castor oil, olive oil 
and almond oil were used* Preservatives such as formaldehyde 
and chloroform were used to inhibit bacterial growth in the 
samples but they also retarded lipase activity* The results 
reported were conflicting and the question of the presence of 
lipase in milk was not satisfactorily answered. 

Maass (1909) presented evidence that cow’s milk contained 
a true lipase capable of hydrolyzing milk fat. Maass used 
formalin as a preservative and sterilized cream as a substrate. 
He found that the addition of raw milk or cream caused an 
increase in titratable acidity after incubation at 35--38°C 
and that this Increase was proportional to the amount of 
inoculum. This is characteristic of an enzymatic rather than 
of a bacterial process. Maass also reported that the amount

of enzyme present in milk increases at the end of the lactation 
period* 

In 1922, Rice and Markley confirmed the report that normal 
milk does contain an active lipase which sets fatty acids free 
from milk fat in the absence of bacterial growth* Boiled cream 
saturated with cane sugar was used as the substrate for lipase 
and the extent of lipolysis after incubation from three to 
thirty days was measured by titrating the cream with standard 
alkali to the phenolphthalein end point. 

Reder (1938) made a chemical examination of rancid milk 
and found it to have a slightly higher chloride and lower 
lactose content and a higher concentration of total solids 
than normal milk. Besides the development of a rancid odor 
and flavor, several other changes occur in milk as a result 
of lipase action. Most studies of lipase action in milk have 
been based upon measurements of the increase in titratable 
acidity of the milk, but several investigators have used 
changes in pH, fat acidity or surface tension as a measure of 
lipolysis. 

Herrington and Krukovsky, Hylynka and Hood, and Gould 
and Trout all measured lipase activity by titrating the free 
acid developed in the fat phase of milk. The milk was held 
at a low temperature for periods of a day or more. The 
samples were then churned, the melted butterfat centrifuged 
and an aliquot of the clear fat titrated with a standard alkali. 




- 11 


Tarassuk (1939) found that, as a result of lipase action, 
one of the most profound changes that occurs in milk is the 
lowering of its surface tension. This lowering of the surface 
tension is due to the presence of free fatty acids liberated 
by the hydrolysis of the fat. As the hydrolytic rancidity 
develops, the surface tension of milk decreases from a normal 
value of 49-51 to 39-40 dynes per centimeter. However, many 
factors other than lipolysis influence the surface tension of 
milk. Dunkley found that care must be taken to standardize 
the procedure for collection and treatment of the samples in 
order to minimize the effects of various factors which influ¬ 
ence the surface tension. Hetrick and Tracy (1948) used sur¬ 
face tension changes supplemented with organoleptic examination 
as a measure of lipase activity in their studies on milk 
lipase inactivation by heat. 

Reder estimated lipase by measurement of the amount of 
hydrolysis of tributyrin added to raw whole milk. Formaldehyde 
was used to inhibit bacterial growth during the incubation 
period of twenty-four hours. The pH of the reaction mixture 
was not controlled. 

In 1938, Mattick and Kay questioned the reliability of 
many of the earlier methods for the determination of milk lipase. 
Among the procedures which these investigators considered 
dubious were the following: 

w (1) The incubation of admittedly non-sterile material 
suspected of containing a lipase with fat for long periods of

time, frequently under conditions almost optimal for bacterial 
repreduction* 

(2) The estimation of lipolysis by titration of increase 
in the total acidity of a reaction mixture, where processes 
other than lipolysis, as possible sources of the increase in 
acidity, had not been excluded* 

(3) Reliance on antiseptics not previously proved to be 
efficient * 

(4) Use of antiseptics which seriously inhibit lipase 
action* 

(5) Use of substrates other than triglycerides for the 
estimation of lipolytic activity . n 

Mattick and Kay devised an improved method for estimating 
lipase, or tributyrinase as they prefer to name the enzyme 
responsible for splitting tributyrin. It consisted in the 
titration of butyric acid, formed under standard conditions 
of time, temperature, acidity and volume, from the action of 
the milk enzyme on tributyrin in a buffer solution. 

Milk was buffered at pH 8.5 using sodium di-ethyl barbi¬ 
turate, tributyrin was added as a substrate and the reaction 
mixture held at 37°C with gentle shaking. Aliquot portions 
were removed at the start and after various incubation times 
up to six hours. The aliquot portions were acidified with 
phosphoric acid, steam distilled to recover the free volatile 
acids and the distillates titrated using phenolphthalein as

indicator. The hydrolysis of the tributyrin was determined 
by the titer of the steam distillate and was considered to be 
proportional to the tributyrinase present. Increases in 
bacterial population during incubation were small and could 
be considered a negligible source of error in the determination. 

In 1943, Peterson, Johnson and Price suggested a method 
for the determination of milk lipase. This method resembled 
that of Mattick and Kay except that the hydrolysis of tributyrin 
was measured by removing aliquot portions of the reaction mixture 
at the beginning and at the end of the incubation period and 
titrating them in the presence of alcohol and ether to the 
thymolphthalein end point. The shortening of the incubation 
time to thirty minutes and the elimination of the time-consuming 
steam distillation required in the Mattick and Kay method made 
this procedure more readily adapted to routine determinations. 
Peterson, Johnson and Price (1948) have recently reported a 
method for the determination of cheese lipase. This procedure 
is similar in principle to their milk lipase determination. 

Kelly (1944) (1945) developed a method of estimation of 
milk lipase in which the milk to be tested is first dried and 
then extracted with acetone and ether. A soft fine precipitate 
was obtained which would keep indefinitely. Various substrates 
including tributyrin and sterilized butter oil were employed. 

Some samples were immediately extracted with ether to serve 
as blanks, the remainder were Incubated at 37°C, usually for 
twenty-four hours, before extraction. Alcohol was added to

the extract which was titrated against standard alkali using 
phenolphthalein as indicator, Kelly pointed out that one 
disadvantage of his method is that the physical condition of 
the samples is not the same as it would be in undried milk* 

Johnson and Gould (1946) studied the variation in the 
acid degree of milk fat as affected by churning and extraction 
procedures. In their extraction procedure, rancid cream was 
shaken with a mixture of ethyl ether and Skellysolve, the 
solvents being in the ratio of 1:1. The mixture was centri¬ 
fuged, the supernatant ethereal portion removed by syphon 
and the solvent evaporated. The degree of fat splitting 
resulting from lipase activity was determined by titration 
with Q.1N NaOH to the phenolphthalein end point. 

Lubert (1949) reviewed methods for the detection of 
lipolytic micro-organisms and for the study of lipolytic 
activity in bacterial cultures. Using a method based on the 
procedure proposed for milk lipase in this paper, he studied 
the lipolytic activity in cultures of various micro-organisms, 
with particular reference to Pseudomonas fluorescens, end in 
Cheddar cheese.

PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATIONS 

In order to study the properties of lipases which may be 
present in dairy products, a reliable and yet versatile 
method for the determination of the lipase content of fluids 
such as milk and bacterial media was needed* The method should 
be simple enough that it can be applied routinely to large 
numbers of samples* 

Dunkley selected the Peterson, Johnson and Price technique 
and applied It to milk lipase determinations* However, 

Dunkley was not able to obtain satisfactory reproducibility 
In his results* The author also applied this method to routine 
lipase determinations of milk and found it unsatisfactory* 

The main difficulty is in determining the end point of 
the titration* Since the solution which is titrated contains 
milk salts and proteins and, in addition, is buffered at pH 
8.5, it has appreciable buffer capacity at the titration end 
point and does not give a sharp color change* 

As a result of numerous trials, Dunkley devised a 
tentative procedure based on that of Peterson, Johnson and 
Price. The necessity for titrating the liberated butyric 
acid in the presence of proteins and barbiturate buffer was 
eliminated by acidifying the reaction mixture with phosphoric 
acid, extracting it with ether and titrating an aliquot of 
the ether extract, Dunkley conducted experiments to determine 
the reliability of the method and the importance of standard!- 






15 


zing the conditions.under which it was carried out so that the 
measure of lipolysis could be considered directly proportional 
to the lipase content* Lipase determinations were made routinely 
at weekly intervals on a selected group of cows in the University 
herd. On the basis of this work, Dunkley suggested certain 
modifications to improve the tentative procedure. The author 
has investigated the feasibility of using these modifications 
and has carried out further work on the reliability of the 
method finally adopted.

EXPERIMENTAL 

I. METHOD 

Reagents 

Borate Buffer - 6.23g boric acid and 50 ml Normal NsOH 
made up to 1 liter, 

Tributyrin - obtained from the Eastman Kodak Company, 
Rochester, N.Y. 

Molar Phosphoric Acid 

Ethyl Ether 

Titration Mixture - containing 1 liter 95% ethanol, 

1 liter distilled water, 50 ml 0.1% 
alcoholic Cresol Red. 

A few drops of 0.05N NaOH are added 
to give the mixture a pH of 7.4. 

Standard 0.025N NaOH. 

P rocedure 

The sample of milk to be tested is centrifuged and the 
cream layer removed by means of a spatula. Two ml of the 
skim milk are pipetted into a test tube containing 5 ml of 
the borate buffer. The mixture is adjusted, if necessary, 
to pH 8.8 (at 22°C) using M/lO NaOH or M/lO phosphoric acid. 
Fresh normal milk samples seldom require any adjustment. 

The buffered milk is placed in a water bath at 37°C 
and allowed to reach this temperature in 3 minutes. Then 
0.6 ml tributyrin are added, a rubber stopper inserted, and 
the mixture is shaken vigorously for 5 seconds to emulsify 
the tributyrin. The reaction mixture is then returned to

the water bath and the rubber stopper loosened. The sample 
is not agitated during the reaction period. 

At the end of the reaction period (30 minutes after 
the addition of the tributyrin), 5 ml of M phosphoric acid 
are added, the test tube is inverted twice and transferred 
to a 20°C water bath. After allowing 3 minutes for the 
mixture to reach this temperature, 10 ml of ethyl ether are 
added and the tube is shaken vigorously for 5 seconds. The 
test tube is then returned to the 20°C water bath. The 
ether layer usually separates rapidly after the extraction 
but approximately 5 minutes should be allowed to permit 
small water droplets to settle out of the ether layer. The 
rubber stopper should be loosened 2 or 3 minutes before a 
5 ml aliquot of the clear ether extract is transferred by 
means of a pipette to a 100 ml beaker containing 10 ml of 
the titration mixture. The ether extract and titration 
mixture are then titrated with the standard NaOH to a feint 
orange color using a burette calibrated at 0.01 ml intervals. 
The number of ml of 0.025N NaOH required to reach this end 
point is designated as the "Titer.'* 

The blank determination is carried out in the same 
manner except no time is allowed for hydrolysis of the 
tributyrin to take place. The M phosphoric acid is added 
immediately after the samples have been shaken with the 
tributyrin. The number of ml of 0.025N NaOH required to 





18 


titrate the blank determination is reported as the "Blank* rf 
The difference in ml between the Titer and the Blank 
represents tributyrin hydrolysis and is referred to in this 
paper as "Hydrolysis*"

II. RELIABILITY OF EXTRACTION P ROCEDURE 

(a) Titration of the Ether Extract . 

The procedure described under "Method” involves the 
titration of ether extracts of butyric acid in the presence 
of low concentrations of boric and phosphoric acids. 

Since the dissociation constants and the end points 
of indicators as determined in aqueous solutions would not 
apply to the above titration which is carried out in the 
presence of ether, potentiometric titrations were made to 
determine the end point desired and the suitability of the 
indicator for this titration. The following solutions of 
the acids involved in the lipase determination were prepared 
in approximately the concentrations in which they would be 
present in the reaction mixture at the time it is extracted 
with ether: 

0.008 M butyric acid 
0.005 M butyric acid 
0.5 M phosphoric acid 
0.05 M boric acid. 

Ten ml of each solution were extracted with 10 ml of 
ether. A 5 ml aliquot of each ether extract was added to 
10 ml of titration mixture and the solutions were titrated 
potentiometrically with 0.025N NaOH using a Beckman glass 
electrode pH meter. The meter was standardized at pH 8.60 
and was checked with the standard buffer solution before 
each titration. The end point pH reading was taken at the

first change to a faint orange color. The apparent pE 
readings obtained were slightly high because of the influence 
of the ether, but it is only necessary to consider changes in 
pH (not absolute pH values) to establish the reliability of 
the titration. 

Figure 1 shows the curves obtained for: 

A - 0.008M butyric acid 
B - 0.005M butyric acid 
C - 0.5M phosphoric acid 
D - 0.05M boric acid 
E - distilled water. 

The end point color change occurred between pH 8.55 and 8.60 
in these titrations. From the above curves it is apparent 
that butyric acid is easily extracted, can be readily titrated 
and gives a sharp end point when Ores cl Red is used as the 
indicator. The presence of low concentrations of boric and 
phosphoric acid3 does not interfere with the titration of 
the butyric acid. 

(b) Extraction of Free Butyric Acid. 

Replicate test tubes each containing 2 ml of pasteurized 
skim milk buffered with 5 ml of borate buffer were prepared. 
After 0.6 ml of tributyrin were added, each sample was shaken 
for 5 seconds. Then increasing amounts of 0.05 N butyric acid 
were added to duplicate tubes. Each sample was acidified by 
adding 3*5 ml of 1.5M phosphoric acid, inverted twice, and 
then extracted with 10 ml of ether. A 5 ml aliquot of the 
ether extract was titrated with 0.025N NaOH as in the regular 
procedure. The data are given in Table I.

Figure 2 shows that there was a direct relation between 
the concentration of free butyric acid in the sample and the 
amount extracted by the ether as measured by the titer 
corrected for the blank determination. The percentage 
recovery of the added butyric acid was around 90 percent. 

(c) Varying the Agitation during Extraction# 

Twenty ml of pasteurized skim milk were buffered with 
50 ml of borate buffer and then 10 ml of approximately 
0.05N butyric acid were added. A series of 8 ml samples 
of this mixture was pipetted into test tubes. The samples 
were brought up to 37°C, 0.6 ml tributyrin added and the 
tubes shaken for 5 seconds. After a 30 minute reaction 
period at 37°C, the samples were acidified with 4 ml of 
M phosphoric acid. Ten ml of ether were used to extract 
the free butyric acid but the amount of shaking was varied. 

A set of blanks without butyric acid was also prepared and, 
after acidification with 5 ml of M phosphoric acid, was 
extracted with ether in a similar manner. 

The data given in Table II demonstrate that shaking 
each sample with the ether approximately 25 times in 5 
seconds is sufficient agitation to satisfactorily extract 
the free butyric acid present.

each sample tube. After the addition of 0.6 ml of tributyrin, 
the samples were shaken for 5 seconds and 5 ml of M phosphoric 
acid were added to each test tube. Triplicate samples were 
then placed in water baths held at 15°, 20°, 25° and 30°C. 
After allowing the samples to come to the required temperature, 
each triplicate set was extracted with ether which had been

100 ml of borate buffer and then 20 ml of 0.05N butyric acid 
were added. Eight ml amounts of this mixture were pipetted 
into test tubes and placed in a water bath at 37°C. About 
3 minutes later increasing concentrations of tributyrin were 
added, the samples shaken for 5 seconds and then held at 
37°C for 30 minutes. The blanks were prepared by adding 2 
ml of the pasteurized skim milk to 5 ml of borate buffer 
and shaking as before with the appropriate amount of tri¬ 
butyrin. After the 30 minute holding period at 37°C, 3.5 ml 
of 1.5M phosphoric acid were added to all the test tubes and 
the determinations completed as in the regular procedure. 

Table IV shows that as the amount of tributyrin is 
increased up to 1.50 ml, the titers obtained increase 
slightly. When the titers are corrected for the blank 
values, the addition of varying amounts of tributyrin has 
no appreciable effect on the amount of butyric acid extracted 
by the ether. However, as the tributyrin concentration is 
increased, less ether separates out as a clear layer and 
greater care is necessary in pipetting the 5 ml aliquot for 
titration.

III FACT ORS AFFECTING THE BLANK PETERMINATION. 

The blank determination may be made in either of two 

ways: 

(a) Carry out the determination as outlined in the 
procedure given under ?f Method ff but allow no time for hydrolysis 
of the trlbutyrin to take place* 

(b) Carry out the determination as outlined in the 
procedure given under ^Method” but destroy the enzyme in the 
milk by heat before adding the tributyrin* 

For routine determinations the first procedure proved to be 
the more convenient and was adopted* 

With fresh milk samples the blank has been found to be 
quite constant at 0*16 ml of 0.025N NaOH (within experimental 
error of about + 0*01 ml), and this value can be used as a 
standard correction for routine determinations. This means 
that only one titration may be required for each determination. 
However, this is not possible when dealing with samples which 
may previously have undergone lipolysis or souring. With 
such samples the free fatty acids or produced lactic acid 
increase the value of the blank. 

(a) Tributyrin Breakdown . 

To determine the extent of tributyrin hydrolysis in the 
absence of lipase activity during the 30 minute reaction 
time, a series of buffered pasteurized skim milk samples, each

containing 0,6 ml of tributyrin, was held at 37°C for varying 
periods of time. The determinations were then completed in 
the usual manner. It is apparent from the data given in 
Table V that no appreciable breakdown of tributyrin occurs 
during the 30 minute reaction period. Therefore, it is not 
necessary to correct the blank for acidity due to the 
hydrolysis of tributyrin during the reaction period.

used is approximately Q.1M with respect to boric acid. At 
the time of extraction the concentration is approximately 
0.04M. Increasing amounts of 0.3M boric acid were added to

The results given in Table VI demonstrate that an 
appreciable increase in the amount of boric acid present 
does not cause a significant variation in the value of the 
blank. This means that the composition of the borate buffer 
may be varied when the proposed lipase assay is to be applied 
to other dairy products or bacterial cultures. 

(c) Varying the Concentration of Phosphoric Acid . 

Five ml of M phosphoric acid are used in the determination

to lower the pH of the sample to below pH 2 in order to stop 
hydrolysis and to permit the subsequent extraction of the 
liberated butyric acid. For seme purposes it is desirable 
to use a smaller amount of 1.5M phosphoric acid. To determine 
the effect of such variations, different amounts of both 
M and 1. 5M phosphoric acid were used to acidify replicate 
blank determinations and the samples were then extracted and 
titrated in the usual manner.

Table VII gives the data obtained. Variations of 1 
ml in the amount of M phosphoric acid have little effect on 
the blank. Similarly variations of 1 ml of 1.5M phosphoric 
acid have no appreciable effect on the corresponding blank. 

(d) Varying the Concentra t ion of Tributyrin . 

Replicate samples were prepared by adding 2 ml of 
pasteurized skim milk to 5 ml of borate buffer. The samples 
were brought up to 37°C in a water bath, increasing amounts 
of tributyrin added and each test tube shaken for 5 seconds. 
Five ml of M phosphoric acid were then added and the samples 
extracted with ether in the usual manner.

The results given in Table VIII indicate that as the 
amount of tributyrin is increased the value of the blank 
increases* While differences of a small drop or two in the 
amount of tributyrin added do not materially affect the value 
of the blank, care should be taken to add the tributyrin as 
accurately as possible to avoid this source of error. 

(e) Varying the Agitation to Emulsify the Tribut yrin• 

A series of buffered skim milk samples was prepared and 
0*6 ml of tributyrin were added to duplicate samples. The 
duplicate tubes were shaken 5, 10, 20, 30 and 40 times 
respectively and then immediately acidified with 5 ml of 
M phosphoric acid. The samples were then extracted with 
ether and a 5 ml aliquot of the ether extract titrated in 
the usual manner. 

Table IX shows that the above variations in the amount 
of agitation to emulsify the tributyrin have little effect 
on the value of the blank. In the proposed lipase assay 
the samples are shaken approximately 25 times in 5 seconds.

IV. OTHER FACTORS AFFECTING THE M E THOD 

(a) Tributyrin Concentra t ion . 

Several experiments on the effect of the concentration 
of tributyrin on the hydrolytic activity of milks from 
selected cows of the University of Alberta herd were carried 
out. Samples of milk from individual cows were held at 15°C 
for approximately one hour after milking and then taken to 
the Department of Dairying where they were held at 4°G from 
1 to 24 hours. Forty ml of each milk were added to 100 ml 
of borate buffer and 7 ml amounts of the mixture pipetted 
into test tubes. The buffered samples were brought up to 
37°G, increasing amounts of tributyrin added, the test tubes 
shaken 5 seconds and then replaced in the ¥\rater bath for the 
30 minute reaction period. The determinations were completed 
in the usual manner except that 3.5 ml of 1.5M phosphoric 
acid were used to stop hydrolysis. Blank determinations with 
varying concentrations of tributyrin were also made. 

The curves obtained for six milks are shorn in Figure 
3. In the presence of excess substrate, the enzyme followed 
a zero order reaction under the conditions used in the 
determination. Very close to maximum hydrolysis was obtained 
when 0.60 ml of tributyrin were used an substrate except in 
the experiment on Milk tf A n . Further investigations were 
conducted on this particular milk. After holding the sample 
for approximately 24 hours at 4°G, an experiment similar to

that described above was carried oat except that the reaction 
period was increased to 60 minutes. Table X shows that maximum 
hydrolysis was obtained with 0.60 ml tributyrin under these 
particular conditions. However, the lipase activity of the 
milk was possibly reduced by the 24 hour holding period at 
4°C. Since it seemed desirable to avoid the use of a 60 
minute reaction period for routine work, investigations along 
this line were discontinued.

Other experiments on the effect of the concentration 
of tributyrin on hydrolysis obtained with both 2 ml and 1 ml 
amounts of Milk "A” were carried out* The 1 ml samples were 
prepared by adding 20 ml of milk and 20 ml of distilled 
water to 100 ml of borate buffer and pipetting 7 ml of the 
mixture into test tubes. A few drops of 1.5M phosphoric acid 
were used to adjust the pH to 8.55. Blank determinations 
with varying concentrations of tributyrin were also made. 

One hour later the experiment was repeated using 2 ml milk 
samples prepared by adding 40 ml of milk to 100 ml of buffer. 
The pH of the buffered milk was again adjusted to 8.55. Curve 
A1 in Figure 4 shows that 0.60 ml of tributyrin gave maximum 
hydrolysis when 1 ml of Milk n A lf was used. 

The great majority of the determinations carried out 

on the individual milks of cows in the University of Alberta 

herd have given hydrolysis values under 1.20 ml of 0.025N 

NaOK. For routine determinations 0.6 ml tributyrin should 

be satisfactory. However, for milks showing exceptional 
* 

lipase activity the sample size may be reduced to 1 ml. 

Mattick and Kay found that gentle shaking of the 
reaction mixture during the incubation period slightly 
increased the hydrolysis of tributyrin. Peterson, Johnson 
and Price did not agitate their incubation mixture. 

A few experiments were conducted to determine the 
influence of agitation during the reaction period in the 
proposed lipase assay. Little or no increase in hydrolysis

was obtained but further work should be carried out before 
a definite conclusion can be justified. For routine deter¬ 
minations a mechanical means of shaking would be very useful. 
The possibility that the inclusion of some emulsifying agent, 
such as lecithin, bile salts or saponin, might help to keep 
the tributyrin emulsified during the reaction period should 
also be investigated. 

(b) pH 

After considerable preliminary work a series of borate 
buffers was prepared which gave a suitable pH range when 2 
ml of milk were added to 5 ml of buffer. Each buffer was 0.1M 
with respect to boric acid and the composition of the series 
is given in Table XI. 

Five ml of each buffer were accurately pipetted into 
duplicate test tubes. Two ml of skim milk were then added 
to one of the duplicate tubes of each buffer and these were 
brought up to 30°C in a waterbath. After 0.6 ml tributyrin 
had been added and the mixture shaken 5 seconds, the pH of 
each sample was determined as quickly as possible. The 
inside electrodes of a Beckman glass electrode pH meter, 
previously standardized at pH 8.60 and checked at pH 7.00, 
were used. No trouble with "drifting" was experienced. The 
electrodes and electrode cup were rinsed with distilled water 
at 30°C and then dried with paper tissue between determinations. 
On completing the pH determinations, 2 ml of the same skim milk

were added to each of the remaining duplicate tubes containing

while curve ,f B n is for a mixed sample of milk from the University 
of Alberta herd. The optimum pH for hydrolysis of tributyrin 
by the milk lipase is between pH 8.7 and 8.8 when determined

at 30°C at the start of the reaction period® This pH optimum 
is slightly above that found by Mattiek and Kay, and Peterson, 
Johnson and Price. However, these investigators do not 
mention the temperature at which they determined their pH 
values. The so-called "optimum pH" curve is actually a 
function of two variables: 

(1) the stability of the enzyme protein to hydrogen ion 
c one ent rat i on, 

(2) the effect of hydrogen ion concentration on the 
catalyzed reaction. 

As a result, the pH optimum may depend on a number of factors, 
such as substrate concentration, reaction time and temperature, 
nature of buffer and purity of enzyme preparation. 

Saponification 

The increased rate of hydrolysis at pH values above 9.75 
is believed due to the increased saponification at high pH. 

In order to determine whether saponification at pH 8.75 could 
be a significant source of error in the lipase assay, deter¬ 
minations were carried out on buffered, pasteurized skim 
milk held at 37°C for increasing periods of time. Table 
XIII shows that over the 30 minute reaction period no signif¬ 
icant saponification occurs. 

pH Control by the Borate Buffer 

Figure 5 shows that pH has a marked effect on the ability 
of the lipases in milk to hydrolize tributyrin and that

In the early stages of this investigation, various sodium 
borate buffers were tried in an attempt to find a suitable 
buffer that would give the desired initial pH with the milk 
sample and also have good buffer capacity without inhibiting 
the lipase enzyme* The following experiment illustrates the 
buffer capacity of the borate buffer suggested In this paper. 

Eight milk samples from different cows in the University 
of Alberta herd were collected and held at 4°C for eight hours. 
Ten ml of each milk were buffered with 25 ml of the borate 
buffer* Quadruplicate test tubes containing 7 ml of each 
buffered milk were then prepared. The pH of one of the 
quadruplieate samples, to which 0.6 ml tributyrin had been 
added, was determined at 30°C before the reaction period*

The pH at the end of the 30 minute reaction period was also 
determined at 30°C, using the second of the quadruplicate 
tubes. In this case the pH was determined as quickly as 
possible after rapidly cooling the samples in a water bath 
from 37°C to 30°C. Lipase determinations were carried out 
on the remaining two tubes, one of the samples serving as 
the blank.

Table XIV shows that the pH values of the buffered milks 
did not drop over 0.30 pH units except in the case of Sample 
7 which had a high hydrolysis value. The milk from this 






















44 


particular cow also gave the unusually high results discussed 
under ff (a) Tributyrin Concentration.” The first four samples 
of milk were from Jersey cows and gave slightly lower initial 
pH values. However, for routine determinations on fresh 
normal milks, few samples should require adjustment of pH. 
Where extensive lipolysis of the milk fat has occurred or 
where lactic acid has been produced, adjustment of pH may be 
necessary. 

pH at Time of Extraction. 

In order to stop hydrolysis of tributyrin and to 
facilitate the subsequent extraction of the butyric acid, 

5 ml of M phosphoric acid are added to the sample after the 
reaction period. At the above stage in the lipase assay, 
pH determinations were made on the eight samples used in the 
above experiment and the results were found to be between 
pH 1.5 and 2.0. 

(c) Optimum Reaction Period Temperature. 

During the course of this investigation experiments 
were conducted to determine the optimum temperature for 
the hydrolysis of tributyrin during 30 and 60 minute reaction 
periods. The following experiment is representative of this 
work. 

A sample of mixed milk was collected from the University 
farm herd and held approximately 5 hours at 4°C. Twenty ml

of skim milk from the above sample were added to 50 ml of 
borate buffer* Replicate 7 ml samples of the buffered milk 
were then prepared. Triplicate tubes were placed in water 
baths held at 30°, 37°, 40° and 45°C and allowed to reach 
the respective bath temperature in three minutes. One sample 
from each triplicate set served as a blank determination. 
Lipase estimations were made on the remaining duplicates 
using a 30 minute reaction period. A similar experiment was 
then carried out using milk from an individual cow from the 
University herd. The data are given in Table XV. 

Figure 6 shows that, under the above conditions of the 
proposed lipase assay 37°G gave the greatest hydrolysis. 

Mattick and Kay used a 6 hour incubation period and a 
temperature of 37°C, while Peterson, Johnson and Price 
suggested a 30 minute reaction period at 40°C. These 
workers did not give any data regarding the effect of 
reaction temperature on hydrolysis. 

The temperature-activity curve of an enzyme can be 
resolved into two components: 

(1) the effect of the increase in temperature on the 
rate of the catalyzed reaction. 

(2) the effect of the increase in temperature on the 
stability of the enzyme. 

Until further work could be done on the kinetics of the 
lipolytic enzymes of milk, a 30 minute reaction period at 
a temperature of 37°0 was chosen for the proposed method.

However, it is recognized that such a reaction period 
temperature may be close to the point where little change 
in conditions with respect to pH, concentration of enzyme, 
substrate and products of the reaction, might tend to shift 
the reaction over to one of inactivation.

(d) Enzyme Coneentration. 

Preliminary experiments showed that varying amounts of 
milk could be added to selected buffers, whose composition 
is given in Table XI, to give similar pH values. The 
buffer solutions were all 0.1M with respect to boric acid 
but differed in concentration of NaOH present. The milks 
used in the following experiment had been held for varying 
periods of time from 8 to 24 hours at 4°C. Duplicate tubes 
containing 5 ml of each selected buffer were prepared. 
.Increasing amounts of skim milk were added to one set of 
buffers and the pH determined at 22°C. The pH of the buffered 
milks of each series checked within *0.04 pH units. The 
corresponding amounts of milk were then added to the dupli¬ 
cate set of test tubes containing 5 ml of each buffer. 

Both series of samples were brought up to 37°C. The first 
set, on which the pH values had been checked, served as 
blank determinations. The lipase activity of the second 
set was determined in the usual manner. Table XVI summarizes 
the data obtained for three different milks. 

Figure 7 shows that there appears to be a direct relation 
between the enzyme concentration and hydrolysis of tributyrin 
when 0.50 to 2.00 ml of milk are used. Under the above 
conditions the concentration of enzyme present is the 
limiting factor in the hydrolysis of the substrate.

(e) Reaction Time 

Several experiments were carried out in the course of 
this investigation to determine the effect of the reaction 
time on hydrolysis. In one such experiment two samples of 
milk, one from a Holstein cow and one from a Jersey cow, 
were obtained from the University herd and held at 4°G for 
6 hours. Thirty ml of each milk were buffered with 75 ml 
of borate buffer and the pH adjusted to 8.8 at 22°C. Seven 
ml of each buffered milk were then pipetted into replicate 
test tubes. Tributyrin was added to each sample tube and 
the determinations started in the usual manner. Duplicate 
tubes were removed from the 37°C water bath at increasing 
intervals of time, M phosphoric acid added and the determinations 
completed. 

Fifty ml of each milk were heated to 90°C, held two 
minutes at this temperature and then quickly cooled to 25°C. 
Reaction mixtures consisting of 2 ml milk, 5 ml buffer and 
0.6 ml tributyrin were prepared using the above milks and 
these were held 0, 30, 60 and 90 minutes. These determinations 
served as blanks to show the possible breakdown of tributyrin 
in the absence of lipase activity. The data obtained are 
given in Table XVII. 

The curves shown in Figure 8 indicate that the rate of 
hydrolysis was quite constant for the first 20 minutes of 
the reaction period and then it decreased appreciably.

TIME - MINUTES 

Figure 8 » Effect of Reaction Time on Hydrolysis

This decrease may be due to various factors such as: 

(1) a partial inactivation of the enzyme by the 30 
minute reaction time at 37°C. 

(2) a decrease in pH during the reaction period may 
affect the activity of the enzyme. 

(3) the accumulation of the products of the reaction 
may inhibit the enzyme. 

(4) the presence of impurities. 

With a 30 minute reaction period the percentage decrease 
in hydrolysis was 6 and 7 percent for milks A and B1 
respectively. Using the 60 minute reaction period* the 
corresponding percentage decreases were 19 and 24 percent 
respectively. In order to obtain significant hydrolysis 
without a large deviation,from the expected value, the 30 
minute reaction period was chosen for the lipase assay. 

Since a temperature of 40°C for 30 minutes results in 
a decrease in lipase activity as shown in n (c) Optimum Reaction 
Period Temperature, u further work may show the advisability 
of lowering the reaction temperature below 37°C« While it 
has been found that the borate buffer used in the determination 
will keep the difference in the pH of the reaction mixture 
at the beginning and end of the reaction time within 0.4 pH 
units, an improved buffer might prevent this drop in pH. 

The effect of the accumulating free butyric acid, which is 
in the form of highly ionized sodium salt, should also be 
investigated. It may be possible to fractionate milk in

order to obtain a relatively pure enzyme preparation. Such 
a preparation would be very useful in further study of the 
kinetics of the enzyme. 

(f) CaCl 2 

Peterson, Johnson and Price found that zinc chloride, 
potassium cyanide, manganous sulfate, magnesium chloride 
and cysteine did not appear to activate milk lipase. However, 
Goldstein and Roe (1943) used calcium acetate in their tech¬ 
nique for the determination of the lipase of blood serum. 

Early in this work it was decided to investigate the 
effect of adding CaClg to the reaction mixture as an activator. 
Preliminary investigation indicated that GaClg appeared to 
have a marked accelerating effect on the hydrolysis of 
tributyrin by milk lipase* Several experiments were then 
carried out to find the concentration of GaCl^ required for 
optimum hydrolysis under the conditions of the proposed 
lipase assay. The results of one such study are reported 
here. 

Mixed Jersey milk from the University of Alberta herd 
was held approximately 24 hours at 4°C. Sixty ml of this 
milk (skimmed) were buffered with borate buffer and replicate 
tubes, each containing 7 ml of the mixture, were prepared. 

The samples were brought up to 37°C and increasing amounts 
of 10% CaClg were added to duplicate tubes. After adding 
0.20 ml tributyrin, the determinations were completed in 
the usual manner. Blank determinations using 0.00, 0.25 and

0.50 ml of 10$ CaCl^ were ma<ie and these checked within 
experimental error. 

Figure 9 shows that, under the conditions of this partic¬ 
ular experiment, maximum hydrolysis occurred when 0.20 to 
0.30 ml of 10$ CaCl were added to the reaction mixture. 

When the amount of CaCl was increased over 0.30 ml, hydrolysis 
was decreased. 

It was decided to study further the use of 0.25 ml of 
CaClg as an activator in the proposed lipase assay. Using 
this modification of the procedure, the following factors 
were investigated: 

(1) Optimum pH at start of Reaction Period for Hydrolysis. 

(2) Effect of Tributyrin on Hydrolysis. 

(3) Effect of Reaction Temperature on Hydrolysis. 

(4) Effect of Heat on Lipase of Milk. 

(5) Effect of Storage Temperature of the Milk on Lipase. 

(6) Effect of Shaking during the Reaction Period on 
Hydrolysis. 

The data obtained for the above are not reported in this 
paper since it was later decided not to use CaCl o in the 
lipase determination. 

Several experiments were also carried out on the effect 
of CaClg on milks obtained from different cows. In one 
representative experiment, samples of milk from five Holstein 
and five Jersey cows were collected at the University of 
Alberta Farm and held approximately one hour at 4°G. Lipase

determinations including the addition of 0*25 ml of 10# CaCl g 
were compared with determinations made at the same time where 
no CaClg was used* The data obtained are summarized in 
Table XVIII. 

The results indicate that the addition of CaCl g seemed 
to increase the hydrolysis of tributyrin by each milk* Since 
HaCI did not give a similar effect, it seems possible that 
the Ca++ ion may be responsible* The actual manner in which 
the Ca++ ion may bring about the activation is not known* 
However, it may possibly prevent the accumulation of free 
butyric acid at the enzyme "active centers” by combining 
with the butyric acid as soon as it is produced from the 
substrate* 

The relative activation varied with the different milk 
samples. The amount of CaGlg used (0*25 ml) may not have 
been the concentration required to give optimum activation 
with each milk* Since there are differences in the salt 
composition of individual milks, it may be impossible to 
use the same amount of CaCl r , and obtain optimum activation 
in each case* Therefore, it was decided not to use CaCl^ 
in the routine determination of lipase until more data 
were obtained to show the precise amount required to give 
optimum hydrolysis with different milks*

DISCUSSION 

The term "lipase” has been used throughout this paper 
with reference to the enzyme in milk responsible for the 
hydrolysis of tributyrin. In the literature the general 
term "esterase" has been commonly used as a group name for 
all enzymes catalyzing the hydrolysis of esters whether the 
latter are simple or complex. The use of the term "lipase" 
has been restricted to those enzyme preparations whose 
maior specificity is toward glyceride substrates. While 
tributyrin is a triglyceride, it is probably not a naturally 
occurring fat. Mattick and Kay preferred to refer to the 
milk enzyme as a "tributyrinase." It seems reasonable to 
surmise that the enzyme in milk responsible for hydrolysis 
of the milk fat, which is a mixture of triglycerides contain¬ 
ing a wide variety of fatty acids, should be able to hydrolyze 
the tributyrin substrate. However, further work using other 
triglycerides as substrates is needed to confirm this point 
as well as the presence of more than one lipase. The com¬ 
parative solubilities in ether of the acids produced from 
other substrates would have to be considered in such a study 
Involving the use of the proposed lipase assay. 

The method as described in this paper provides a con¬ 
venient routine test for studies on lipolysis and lipolytic 
activity of different milks and bacterial cultures. Dunkley

has applied a method similar in principle to investigate 
the correlation between the lipase content and lipolysis, as 
shown by surface tension changes, over the lactation period, 
Lubert has used a method based on this procedure to study 
lipolytic activity in cultures of various micro-organisms 
and in Cheddar cheese. 

It is believed that the proposed method could be used 
to investigate the following factors in relation to the 
lipase activity of milk: 

(1) Heat, including the ff temperature activation” treat¬ 
ment investigated by Krukovsky and Herrington, 

(2) Stability of milk lipase in relation to storage 
time, temperature and pH, 

(3) Homogenization and drying. 

(4) Light. 

(5) Oxidation-reduction potentials, 

(6) Metals. 

(7) Activators and inhibitors. 

(8) Distribution of the enzyme between the fat and 
aqueous phase of milk. 

(9) Correlation between blood serum lipase and milk 
lipase during the lactation period. 

A detailed study of the kinetics of milk lipase would 
be of theoretical and possibly practical interest. However, 
it might be necessary to prepare a purified or partially 
purified enzyme preparation for such an investigation.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 

1* A method for the determination of the lipase content 
of or lipolytic activity in milk has been presented* The 
procedure involves the ether extraction of the butyric acid 
released by the hydrolysis of the tributyrin substrate under 
standardized conditions in the presence of the milk enzyme. 

The lipase activity is expressed as ml of 0.025N NaOH required 
to neutralize a 5 ml aliquot of the ether extract. 

2. Experimental data have been offered to show that, under 
the conditions of the lipase assay, the ether extraction 
procedure is a reliable measure of the butyric acid produced 
from the substrate. 

3. Various factors affecting the blank determination have 
been studied. 

4* Several other factors affecting the method have been investi¬ 
gated. 

In the presence of excess substrate (tributyrin) the 
enzyme followed a zero order reaction. 

Under the experimental conditions used, the apparent 
optimum reaction temperature and pH were 37°C and pH 8.75. 

There was a direct relation between the enzyme con¬ 
centration and the hydrolysis of tributyrin. 

The rate of hydrolysis decreased after the first 20 
minutes of the reaction period. 

The hydrolysis of tributyrin by milk lipase was increased 
appreciably by the presence of CaClg.
