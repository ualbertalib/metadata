ABSTRACT 


Investigations were undertaken t© determine en¬ 
vironmental and varietal influences upon the concentration of 
the bitter and poisonous components, solanine and solanidine, 
in tubers of Solanum tuberosum L» 

Soil types, geographic locations and the photo¬ 
period applied to growing plants did not directly affect the 
glyc©alkaloid content of the tuber« Varieties differed marked¬ 
ly in the amount of bitter coup one nt they were able to synthe¬ 
size, and in the external conditions at which they built up 
solanine most actively* They have been classified into three 
divisions* (a) those not subject to high concentrations under 
any conditions! (b) those capable of marked increase but not 
to levels of human toxicity (200 PsP«m«)| and (c) those that 
readily reach dangerously high levels when environmental condi¬ 
tions are such as to encourage this synthesis* 

An important observation that refutes reports of 
other workers is that all varieties consistently contain low 
concentrations of solanine at harvest time* but most are able 
to develop the alkaloid rapidly (and convert it to the glyco® 
alkaloid) if exposed then or later to solar or artificial illumi¬ 
nation, even if the essposure is of but a few hours f duration® 

The rate of synthesis is greatest in the earliest stage of ex-

posure periods Also, some varieties (in particular. Netted 
Gem) will develop solanine from a threshold to a high concentra¬ 
tion at a steady rate in storage at i|8° P. or less., The normal 
solanine content of Netted Gem tubers when harvested varies from 
20 to 60 p.pjn., but under favourable conditions has been found 
to reach above 800 p.p*m. 

The free alkaloid solanidine was determined by 
difference between colorimetric and hydrolytic methods of esti¬ 
mating solanine* Contrary to previously reported research, 
solanidine was found to be present in bitter tubers, in amounts 
up to one-half the total bitterness component* A low respira¬ 
tory rate in tubers in the presence of light produces solanidine 
first, some or all of which is later converted at a relatively 
steady rate to the glycosidal form. The peel of bitter tubers 
contains about one-third the total tuber solanine, and the peel 
concentration is six times that of the flesh.

INTRODUCTION 


An investigation into conditions tnat may lead to 
an abnormally High, synthesis of solanine in tubers of Splanum 
tuberosum L. was suggested by an increasing number of complaints 
from potato growers ana consumers concerning unpalatable and 
bitter-tasting table potatoes* The bitter component is solanine, 
a glyc©alkaloid possessing poisonous properties and normally 
present in all potato tubers in very small amounts* 

With attention drawn to the occurrence of this dis¬ 
order in our most important vegetable staple, several municipal 
health officers and other medical practitioners became concerned 
about the influence that consumption of bitter potatoes may exert 
upon human health* Income cases (1954- and 1955)# the opinion 
has been expressed that numerous cases of unexplained sickness 
may be caused by solanine poisoning® In view of the specific 
nature of complaints, and the close relationship of symptoms to 
those recorded for solanine poisoning, it is certainly possible 
that the incidence of potato bitterness is more serious than has 
been realized hitherto* 

Despite the fact that the occurrence of abnormal and 
toxic solanine concentrations in bitter potato tubers has been 
known for some fifty years, the knowledge of natural conditions

leading to the disorder has been somewhat fragmentary and con¬ 
fined to many contradictory statements and inadequate observations, 
partly due to a lack of reliable analytical procedures, and part¬ 
ly to the sporadic nature of "bitter potato" outbreaks, and their 
localized nature with respect to the geographical areas involved. 

With regard to the present investigation, it was 
felt that a detailed knowledge of conditions and factors respon¬ 
sible for initiation and the rat© of solanine synthesis in the 
potato tuber was an essential prerequisite to the development of 
remedial measures. 

Previous research at the University of Alberta has 
established that certain environmental factors play an important 
role in the development of bitter potatoes, and has provided some 
information concerning the extent to which bitterness may develop. 
The present work was undertaken to obtain further elucidation of 
the influences on this component of pre- and post-harvest condi¬ 
tions of environment and of differences that might be ejected 
as a result of heredity.

LITERATURE REVIEW 


The botanical and cultivated forms of Splanum and 
Lycopersicon genera produce a variety of glyc©alkaloids* These 
are basic substances poisonous to warm-blooded animals and close¬ 
ly related to sterols, and they occur naturally in the form of 
glycosides (24, 45* 50). Extensively studied glyc©alkaloids 
of solanaceous plants include solanine ( S> tuberosum L.), 
demissine ( S, demissum Lindl.), tomatin© ( L 0 esculentum bace . 
ent .) and solasonin© ( S. sodomeurn L.), and there is reasonably 
good agreement among research workers concerning the general 
nature of their structural configuration and chemical properties, 
(50). The glycoalkaloid solanine was discovered as early as 
1820 by Desfosses in S. nigrum L. (cit. 14)« Because of its 
toxic properties, it soon became the subject of extensive in¬ 
vestigation when it was found by Baup to occur in sprouts of th© 
cultivated potato ( S» tuberosum L.) (cit. 50). 

Chemical and Physical Properties of Solanine 

These have been studied by numerous workers, and the 
structural formula configuration now considered correct is pre¬ 
sented in Pig. 1. On acid hydrolysis, solanine yields on© mole¬ 
cule each of rhamnose, galactose and glucose, and the basic agly- 

cone solanidine, ^ 27 ^ 43 ^ (12, 61). The steroid nature of 

to 

solanidine was established by selenium degradation/ /-methyl cyclo -

penteno-phenanthrene, a characteristic dehydrogenation 

product of the sterols (24, 50) . The structure of the basic 
portion containing one atom of nitrogen has been a subject of 
many controversies and speculations (13, 53 )$ until the correct¬ 
ness of the formula of Prelog and Szpilvogel (1|2) was proven by 
partial synthesis of allo solanidan-3((3)-ol from sarsapogenin by 
Uhl© and Jacobs (57)® Additional evidence confirming the 
steroid nature of the glyc©alkaloids was obtained by the prepara¬ 
tion of derivatives from structurally ascertained sterols, and 
vice versa by obtaining these compounds as a degradation product 
of the alkaloid* Thus Uhle was able to synthesize solasodine 
from non-nitrogenous kryptogenin (56), and Briggs and 0 ! Sh©a 
succeeded in converting solasodine to diosgenin, a sapogenin (11)* 

Physiological studies on the development of solanine 
in plant material have been difficult to evaluate because of dis¬ 
crepancies introduced by the lengthy analytical procedures used* 
The inaccurate gravimetric procedure of Bomer and Mattis (5) was 
replaced by a more sensitive and precise method involving color¬ 
imetry (4l)« Also, in the extraction of plant material, many 
improvements and modifications culminated in the relatively short 
and more acciirate technique reported by Dabbs (15, 16 ) * Th© 
hydrolytic method of Conner (34) is valuable as an aid in the 
estimation of solanidine, although relatively high concentrations 
of glycoalkaloid in the potato tuber are needed before it can be 
rated as reasonably accurate*

Solanine is present in numerous tuberous Splanum 
species, although the findings of early workers (50) need to b© 
corroborated,, The natural occiirrence of free solanidine is 
said to be rare, and although found in sprouts of some potato 
varieties (13, 33), it is suggested that it arises by hydrolysis 
of solanine during the preparation of plant material or during 
the acid-extracting procedure (50)® 

In plants of the cultivated potato, the highest 
glycoalkaloid concentrations are found in sprouts (0*lf.. to 0©Y 
percent of fresh weight) and flowers (0*2 to 0*4 percent), the 
lowest concentrations being found in steins (0*003 percent) and 
tubers (up to 0*012 percent) ( 33 )« Within the tuber itself, 
normally most of the solanine is concentrated in the eyes and 
peels, while the flesh contains relatively small amounts* Accord¬ 
ing t© Fischer and Thiele, most of the solanine is found in about 
a ten-cell layer beneath the skin (20)• 

Solanine and Potato Bitterness 

Marked interest in the condition leading to abnormal 
solanine formation was aroused during the first World War when 
61 cases of alleged potato poisoning were reported in Scotland* 

One of these cases was fatal, and the responsible lot of potato 
tubers was found to contain ijJ .0 p*p*m* of solanine ( 23 ) * Similar 
reports cam© from Germany in 1922 and 1923 (6, 21 , 4.9), and today 
there is no doubt that tuber bitterness and pharynx irritation 
from potatoes are due to somewhat larger—than—normal amounts of

solanine (25)* Recently, the consumption of potato berries 
caused the death of a two-year-old girl after 13 days (lf.8)« In 
Alberta, reports of bitter potatoes ©re increasing as the public 
is becoming aware of the danger connected with the Ingestion of 
such potato©s« 

Potato tubers with a high solanine content leave a 
bitter and persistent burning sensation in the throat ( 25 )« 
Solanine, which resembles saponins In physiological action. Is 
described as a protoplasmic poison and potent hemolytic, causing 
headache, nausea and gastritis (24)* About 0*22 mgms* of sola- 
nine will hemolyze 0*1 ml* of sheep erythrocytes (32)* Prom 
other alkaloids, solanine differs by its strongly irritating 
effect on gastro-intestinal mucosa* This effect tends to lower 
its toxicity, since large doses cause vomiting and diarrhea, 
thus removing much of the solanine before It can affect the cen¬ 
tral nervous system (48)* The alleged toxic level of 200 p.p*m* 
for humans that has been reported by Bomer and Mattie (6) Is 
generally agreed upon by other research workers who have investi¬ 
gated this phase of the problem* 

Solanine Studies - Historical 

As early as 1907j von Morgenstern found high solanine 
tubers to have a bitter and acrid taste* His pioneering work 
was concerned with solanine contents of European potatoes (37)

and was followed by the extensive studies of Bonier and Mattis, 
also in Germany (6, 7), Lampitt ©t al in Great Britain (33)# and 
Wolf and Duggar who carried out a solanine content survey of 
American potato varieties (59)* The study of solanine and rela¬ 
ted glycoalkaloids has received much attention of Russian workers 
( 40 , 43, 44# 51 )# where the problem of bitterness in such an 
important vegetable staple is apparently of great concern (51) • 
Since 1950 a research program has been underway at the University 
of Alberta (15# 25, 27, 62), principally directed towards im¬ 
provements in the accuracy and speed of analytical methods, and 
an investigation into causal factors and the mechanism of synthe¬ 
sis* 


In spite of the fact that some 160 research papers 
have been published that deal with one or more phases of the 
potato bitterness problem, this number is not great when one 
realizes that these reports represent all that has been done dur¬ 
ing the last 130 years* A general impression gained from a study 
of the literature is that the achievements in the field of deter¬ 
mination, of causal factors, and of the physiological plant con¬ 
ditions conducive to high synthesis of the glycoalkaloid, have 
been of an indecisive and often confusing nature* * It does 
appear that the sporadic nature of research interest is du© large¬ 
ly to the fact that severe bitterness in the potato crop occurs 
only at irregular intervals - such as the ”high solanine years” 
that have occurred in Alberta in 1949 and 1954« Moreover, until

an improved analytical procedure was recently developed, as re¬ 
ported by Dabbs and Hilton (16), the methods of extraction and 
determination of solanine were very time-consuming and subject 
to extensive error. 

Literature Relating to Solanine Synthesis in Plants and Tubers 

The solanine content of potato plants and tubers is 
highly variable and apparently is governed by three principal 
factors: inheritance of varietal ability to synthesize large 
amounts (or inability to maintain low levels); stage of develop¬ 
ment (strong vegetative growth, tuber maturity, rest period and 
resumption of physiological activity); and conditions of the 
environment. 

(a) Potato plants 

Little of a positive nature is known about solanine 
transformation and translocation in the growing plants, except 
statistical data concerning its distribution in various parts of 
the plants (33> 37) and the fluctuations within major plant organs 
during the growing season {59)• The means hereby glycoalkaloid 

synthesis occurs in the plants are not well understood, although 
there is evidence that the site of synthesis is in the leaves and 
not in the roots (50). Since the Belladonna alkaloids and nico¬ 
tine are reported as being synthesized only in the roots ( 29 , 30), 
it appears that the pathway of So la mam glycoalkaloid synthesis is 
different* Biochemical studies of the mechanism of alkaloid

synthesis in the plant leaf, and of the possible functions of 
these compounds, are delayed by reason of a lack of basic informa¬ 
tion concerning the precursory substances and the enzymatic sys¬ 
tems involved* Although the existence of a solanine-hydrolyzing 
enzyme, solanase, in young potato sprouts was shown by Petrochenk© 
( 40 ), nothing positive is known about possible precursory metab¬ 
olites or processes related to the synthesis* It is likely that 
some amino acids are involved, as indicated by the need of argi¬ 
nine and ornithine in the synthesis of Belladonna alkaloids (7* 
29)* Increased solanine formation in greened tubers (6, 3h$ 37) 
leads to the assumption that photosynthesis and/or respiration 
may be closely related processes in providing the required energy 
or building material for the synthesis* 

The function of glyeoalkaloids, as well as of alka¬ 
loids, is obscure, and tney are generally dismissed as secondary 
by-products of metabolism (7)« Nevertheless, factors such as 
their presence in places of high metabolic activity (33), the in¬ 
creased rate of synthesis in the early stages of plant develop¬ 
ment (39, 59), and the apparent destructive metabolism that takes 
place towards the end of the season (37, 59) point towards some 
constructive reason for their existence* As some glycosides 
have been shown as controlling factors for self-sterility in 
Forsythia genus, depending on the presence or absence of the ap¬ 
propriate enzyme (31), the glyeoalkaloids may participate at 
least in certain developmental stages in a vital process of

a similar nature* It is known that free solanMine appears in 
tuber sprouts of certain potato varieties (13, 33), and that th© 
alkaloid content in sprouts increases with a parallel decrease 
in the tubers {33K 

(b) Potato tubers 

The amounts of solanine in tubers vary widely with 
respect to variety, stage of development and the environment* 

This variability appears to be dominated by a complex interaction 
of internal and external factors* 

Numerous studies on solanine in American (59) and 
European (6, 37) potato varieties indicate that concentrations 
often described as "normal” appear to be determined by varietal 
character* The general rang© is from 20 to 130 p.p*m* of fresh 
tuber weight* In a recently published work dealing with 58 
European varieties, Lepper reports values exceeding 200 p*p.m* 
in about seven percent of the samples; and though the extent of 
variation within a variety is not Shown, it was also stated that 
high solanine development appears to be a characteristic of some 
varieties (35)* Such relatively high values do not appear as 
"normal,” considering th© occasional extremely high concentrations 
exhibited by some varieties which have been attributed to certain 
effects of th© environment as very low levels of solanine are 
displayed at maturity in th© same varieties if such effects can 
b© excluded (62). ■ Th© inheritance of the glye©alkaloid synthesis

(or amounts) in potato varieties is discussed by Prokoshev et al , 
who have shown that inter-species hybrids of Solanum contain 
glycoalkaloid concentrations that are intermediate between the 
content of parent plants (44), though it is not known whether 
it was the contents of plants or of tubers that was determined* 

In the early tuberization stage, potatoes exhibit 
higher concentrations, which decrease towards maturity (39, 59), 
at which time larger tubers appear to have less solanine than 
small ones (6)© The latter observation probably related to the 
fact that the small tubers have relatively more skin surface 
than large tubers, and the solanine content is greatest in or 
near the peel (20) • Green and sunburned tubers are often bitter 
and contain larger-than-normal solanine amounts (6, Ilf., 37) • 

(1) Growth conditions 

Numerous studies of growth conditions and their 
possible effects upon solanine formation in mature tubers seemed 
to yield negative results insofar as the factors responsible for 
bitterness were concerned* Although reports are somewhat contra¬ 
dictory in many respects, none of the pre-harvest conditions 
appeared to be effective in inducing an abnormal synthesis, with 
the exception of situations where sunburn and consequent greening 
of tubers occurred (34., 37)# The presence of chlorophyll is not 
necessarily an indication of tuber bitterness, as samples ©f

Alberta-grown potatoes with absolutely no discernible pigmenta¬ 
tion were found to have exceedingly high concentrations ( 27 )* 

The influence of cultural practices such as depth of 
planting, level of hilling, and planting of single or multiple- 
eye seed-pieces proved to be negligible (27, 28); as also did 
various pre-harvest treatments such as chemical vine-killing, 
and mechanical removal or damage of vines (62)® Considering 
the fact that high solanine tubers as "seed 11 will produce tubers 
with normal alkaloid content within one (62) or two (58) years, 
it appears that normally developing plants possess mechanisms 
to maintain such low levels in tubers and also to prevent trans¬ 
location from the solanine-rich tops (59)o 

In spite of an increase of nicotine (19) and Cinchona 
(36) alkaloids attributed to the application of high fertilizer 
rates, similar work with.potatoes yielded no conclusive evidence® 
Levels of solanine seem to be influenced by high dosages of nitro¬ 
gen and potassium in the early tuberization stage, but the effect 
is not reflected upon the alkaloid content of mature tubers (39)* 
Von Morgenstern found an increase of tuber solanine with nitrogen 
and phosphorus fertilizer application (37), while other authors 
maintain that the concentrations are unaffected by higher rates 
of N, P, K (6, 3k, 49 ), 

Reports on the effect of soil and climate are rare 
and inconclusive, but it is claimed that when tubers are produced

under conditions of hot climate and dry, sandy soils, more sola- 
nine is likely to be produced (2). 

(2) Harvest conditions 

In view of the doubtfully important influences of 
plant growth conditions on tuber solanine development, it appears 
that abnormal formation takes place either at harvest or during 
subsequent storage* Immature tubers are thought to have higher 
concentrations (6), but this may be due primarily to smaller 
tuber size (59), and such evidence is indefinite in view of the 
alkaloid decrease towards the end of growth ( 29 , 37) and the very 
low concentrations found in tubers harvested about a month prior 
to usual harvest time (62)* The suggestion that freezing tem¬ 
peratures just prior to harvest may cause a rise in solanine ( 27 ) 
could not be confirmed (62). 

Marked solanine formation was observed on exposure 
of freshly harvested potatoes to solar radiation, and the rate of 
synthesis appeared to be influenced by the variety and tempera¬ 
tures (62) * 

While some workers found no appreciable changes during 
the storage ( 17 , 37, 59), others report an increase (20, 33, 62), 
or even a decrease (3k$ 38); however, most of them agree that 
there Is a sharp rise in solanine levels just prior to sprouting 
(38). The contradictory nature of the findings probably is due 
to a differential response of varieties under varying storage

conditions (62), as Arutyunyan reports no change at - 6° to -8° C® 
(2), and Naumov reports a decrease at 5° to 7° 0®, which amounts 
to 50 io when tubers are washed before storage (38) • Organoleptic 
tests also seem to indicate that less bitterness is accumulated 
or maintained at temperatures above 10° C* (25)* 

Differences between active and dormant potatoes were 
also studied, but did not yield conclusive results (34), except 
that in the early phase of dormancy solanine levels appear t© 
b© more readily influenced (62)® 

Numerous studies were carried out on the effects ©f 
light and of specific spectrum components upon solanine synthesis® 
Schowalter and Hartmann did not believe that light effects may 
be responsible for abnormal synthesis (49) • Conner found the 
ultra-violet light at about 300 mjx wave-length effective in in¬ 
creasing solanine levels, but wave-lengths effective in glucose 

synthesis did increase chlorophyll but not solanine (14)« AX- 

not 

though infra-red light was/considered by this author to be an 
effective factor, it was shown that irradiation with an infra-red 
light source of shorter wave-length than used by Cornier induces 
abnormal synthesis of the glycoalkaloid in dormant tubers® This 
is accompanied by chlorophyll formation and later in the storage 
by the appearance of purplish pigments resembling aithocyanins 
(62). Lepper noted, on exposure to light, an increase in tuber 
greening and the development of bitter tubers with large amounts 
of solanine® The solanine content was reduced during the sub-

sequent storage (31 l)* Bomer and Mattis observed increases in 
solanine in “young tubers” with or without attached tope when 
these were exposed to light for 7 to 10 weeks, “old tubers” 

remained unaffected (6)* 

From the foregoing, it is seen that exposure to light 
is considered by the majority of workers as an effective means 
of inducing solanine synthesis* Little information, however, 
is given concerning the parallel influence of other factors (tem¬ 
perature, light intensity, varietal response and metabolic state), 
which recently have been shown to exert a profound influence upon 
light-induced solanine synthesis (62)* Considering the fact 
that solanine is also synthesized in darkness in sprouting 
potatoes (I 4 . 9 ), it appears that the g lye ©alkaloid occurrence is 
not dependent upon any single factor of the environment, and 
that it takes place naturally as a result of a resumption of 
metabolic activities at the end of the post-harvest rest period* 

For abnormal synthesis, such as may be found in bitter tubers, 
it is probable that a photochemical induction stimulus is required*

STUDY OBJECTIVES 


Pour experiments were designed to investigate th© 
conditions which could lead to abnormal rates of solanine synthe¬ 
sis in tubers♦ A fifth trial was undertaken to obtain informa¬ 
tion upon the occurrence and distribution of solanine and solani- 
dine in various tissues of bitter tubers# Observations reported 
in earlier work suggested approaches along the following lines* 

Io To study the influence of representative soil types 
upon solanine concentrations of mature tubers and to seek addi¬ 
tional evidence relative to the hypothesis that abnormal synthesis 
rarely occurs before the tubers are harvested ( 62 )# 

In order to include possible influences of important 
soil types, experimental plots were planned for three sites, wide¬ 
ly differing with respect to soils# Confirmation of low solanine 
concentrations in mature non-pIgmented tubers would imply that 
abnormally high solanine in bitter tubers cannot be due to th© 
translocation from tops, but rather is a result of post-harvest 
conditions to which tubers are exposed, interacting with the pre¬ 
sumably inherent ability of some varieties to produce relatively 
large amounts of the glycoalkaloid# 

II# To study the effects of continuous and intermittent 
exposure of potato tubers to sunlight under harvest-time condi¬ 
tions, particularly in relation to temperatures normally encoun-

tered during that period 


The activating nature of light in the synthesis of 
excessive amounts of solanine has been demonstrated and acknowledged 
for many years (6, 11+, 21, 33 » 3k)> although it is also known that 
in developing sprouts solanine can be synthesized in darkness 
(i|9)o Recently, the effectiveness of light was shown t© be in¬ 
fluenced by the temperature and the metabolic state of stored 
tubers (62). A rapid rise in solanine levels has been noted in 
a limited number of samples after very short exposures of mature 
tubers to sunlight * In order to establish adequate statistical 
evidence for this result, the investigation was extended to eight 
varieties and^much greater number of samples* The effect of 
three soils was included as an additional variable* and in order 
to establish whether the effect of growth conditions or responses 
may have caused a delay in glycoalkaloid development, the sola- 
nine levels of exposed, tubers were determined after an eight-week 
storage period® 

III. To investigate the effects of short and long growth 
photoperiods on solanine development in tubers® 

The suggestion that higher rat© of solanine trans¬ 
location may occur under a shorter photoperiod (59) implies that 
a decrease of radiant energy during unfavorable growing conditions, 
as during periods of excessive rain and cloudiness, may result in 
excessive amounts of solanine in mature tubers 0 Such a finding

would provide evidence somewhat contrary to the results sought 
in the first experiment, but it might explain the incidence of 
"solanine years” as a result of climatic conditions* Such years 
were reported in Scotland in 1917 (23), in Germany in 1922 and 
1923 (6, 4-9), and have been observed in Alberta, particularly 
for the 1954 potato crop* 

IV* To study fluctuations of solanine levels in stored 
mature tubers in the presence or absence of light* 

Contrary to repeated conclusions that little meta¬ 
bolic change takes place during the storage of potatoes, a slow 
increase in solanine concentrations was recently reported for 
stored samples of Netted Gem variety, and the amount of alkaloid 
approached the alleged toxicity level after continuous illumina¬ 
tion for seven days (62)* The differences observed in the earlier 
trial in varietal responses, and the suspected dependence of the 
illumination effect upon the temperature of the storage chamber, 
could not be subjected to biometrical treatment* A new trial 
was therefore designed that would allow statistical analysis of 
results, and more precise information concerning the influence 
of the illumination interval on the rat© at whieh solanine synthesis 
was initiated* 

V 0 To establish the presence or absence in bitter tubers 
of the free alkaloid; and the distribution within the tubers of 
solanine and solanidine*

Although, solanidine is reported to occur in the free 
state in certain tissues, the possibility that it may also occur 
in bitter potatoes has received some negative comment and, in 
general, little attention* The widespread occurrence of bitter¬ 
ness in the Alberta 1951}- potato crop, with record high total 
solanine concentrations, made it appear desirable to determine 
the presence or absence of the free alkaloid and the distribu¬ 
tion of total solanine within bitter tubers* The study was 
facilitated by the discovery of a method by which exceedingly 
high levels of bitterness are produced in susceptible varieties* 


FIELD AND SAMPLING PROCEDURE 


Eighteen potato varieties were grown in identical 
experimental plots located in three major Alberta soil zones. 

Tuber samples from these plots supplied analytical material for 
the major phases of the work reported here* Some additional 
material, including Netted Gem and Katahdtn varieties, was grown 
in an experimental plot at the University of Alberta wherein treat¬ 
ments for observation of photoperiodic effect were made, and from 
which tubers were obtained for exposure to light and to storage 
in darkness* 

The three "variety 11 and "location" test plots were 
planted in a randomized block design at the following locations:

(1) the Provincial Horticultural Station at Brooks, in the brown 
soil zone; (2) the University of Alberta trial grounds, in the 
black soil zone at Edmonton; and (3) leased farmland at Fallis, 
in the gray-wooded soil zone. 

All tubers used for analytical purposes, except those 
used in Experiment V, were grown during the 1953 season. Th© 
three plots were laid out in identical fashion, even to the row 
direction. Each consisted of 20 rows at three feet apart, in¬ 
cluding single guard rows on the two sides. Four blocks, 12 
plants in width, were separated by two guard plants planted across 
the rows. Each variety was represented by a 12-hill row, with 
seed-pieces planted at 12 inches, and its location was determined 
by randomization in each block. The total number of experimental 
plants at each site was 1080® Planting was don© between May 27 
and June 1, 1953; hilling and the first roguing for virus infec¬ 
tion took place in mid-July. Virus disease was responsible for 
the complete removal of three varieties, prior to the harvest. 
These three are of recent and similar genetic origin, and are 
known under number only as 50-1, 50-2 and 176. The other 15 
varieties that were harvested for tuber samples are as follows*

September 30 and October 6; the growing days for plants at 
Brooks being 122, at Pallia 130, and at Edmonton 133* Rain de¬ 
layed the harvest at the latter stations® The yield was normal 
from the black and the brown soil areas, and relatively light 
from the gray-wooded soil* In all cases, however, satisfactory 
sampling could be done on a single-hill basis* The weights of 
all samples for storage studies were taken at harvest, but no 
other yield data were recorded* 

The additional Edmonton plot grown during 1953 was 
made up equally of Katahdin and Netted Gem varieties, planted 
in such a manner as to allow freedom in superimposing the light- 
excluding cage over plants of both varieties* 

Method of Sampling 

Tuber samples for solanine analysis were taken on 
the basis of single-hill plants®"' Hills were chosen at random, 
the plants of which were vigorous and healthy in appearance) and 
the tubers were harvested and placed in marked paper bags and 
immediately under a covering of potato sacks, to prevent undesir¬ 
able temperature and light effects* At the time the samples were 

macerated for frozen storage, four to six healthy and uniform 
100 gm* tubers (medium size) were selected and the remainder dis¬ 
carded* Particular care was taken to avoid over or under-sized 
tubers, and also any tubers showing traces of chlorophyll pigment- 

See Appendix VII for additional notes concerning field and 

sampling technique.

ation. All samples were brought to the laboratory, where they 
were prepared for treatments or analysis within the shortest 
possible time 0 

Preparation of Samples for Analysis 

Tubers selected for analysis were first cut along the 
longitudinal axis, and only one-half of each tuber was diced and 
macerated in a Waring Blendor© Maceration was continued for 
five minutes after the broken tissues began to circulate* The 
resulting finely minced material was thought to represent an 
accurate blend or mean of tubers from a single plant* It was 
assumed that the variation in solanine content of such samples 
was less than would be obtained from a combination of tubers from 
several hills© 

In order to prevent undesirable action of oxidative 
and hydrolytic enzymes, the pulverized potato tissue was weighed 
in duplicate 25 -gram samples in small, tightly closed tin cans, 
and immediately quick-frozen and kept in deep-freeze storage at 
0° F© To provide replacement material, where it might b© required, 
part of the ground tissue was quick-frozen and stored in one- 
quarter pint waxed paper containers© At a convenient time, when 
analysis was to be carried out, the samples were quickly defrosted 
and prepared for extraction© Additional notes on maintenance of 
samples are presented in Appendix VI©

ANALYTICAL PROCEDURES 

(1) u Total solanine’ 1 determination 

Early methods of solanine analysis in tuber and plant 
material were time-consuming and cumber sortie , the many necessary 
steps often resulting in data so variable and inconsistent as 
to be of very doubtful value* Repeated modifications have been 
reported (41# 47# 59) • In the extract, solanine may be estimated 
by gravimetric (5)# hydrolytic (47) or. colorimetric ( 41 ) methods® 
The most accurate and sensitive is the colorimetric estimation, 
which includes both solanine and solanidin© if the free alkaloid 
is present® The resulting determination is most accurately 
designated as ”total solanine*’ 1 Unless otherwise stated or in¬ 
ferred, the term ’’solanine” is used herein as meaning total sola- 
nine® 

Although no satisfactory extraction procedure for 
solanine analysis has been reported, a significant improvement 
in quantitative extraction procedure was introduced by Dabbs (15)# 
and this method was used with slight modifications in earlier work 
by the present author (62)® The same procedure has been used 
in the present investigation® Briefly, the method consists in 
the extraction of 25 gm® of macerated fresh tuber tissue (includ¬ 
ing the skin) with acidified ethylaic©hoi, using Soxhlet extrac¬ 
tion apparatus and the Dabbs colorimetric method for total solanine 
estimation®

A Fisher AC model electrophotometer, using a 335^5 
green filter (525 mja), was used for colorimetric work, after the 
instrument was standardized using purified sola,nine* The cali¬ 

bration regression line was, for convenience, calculated on a 
50 mlo volume basis* Total solan!no concentrations, usually ex¬ 
pressed in milligrams per 100 gm* of fresh or dry weight, are 
presented herein in parts per million (p*p*m*) of fresh tuber 
weight* The presented solanin© data are all based on results of 
duplicate analyses * 

(2) Solanine estimation by the hydrolytic method 

The hydrolytic method, introduced by Conner (Hi) and 
improved by Rooke et al (l*,?)* estimates solanine by measuring the 
increase of reducing power on acid hydrolysis* The latter method 
uses the Hulm© and Narain modification (26) of the ferrlcyanid© 
method of reducing sugar determination (22)* This method, which 
was used in the present work, estimates only solanine, and not 
solanidine* 

An aliquot of ten ml* of solanine extract is pipetted 
into a graduated 30 ml* boiling tube fitted with a condenser (8- 
inch length of glass tubing in a rubber stopper)* An equal volume 
of % hydrochloric acid is added, and the mixture is boiled on a 
water-bath for one hour* The solution is then cooled in tap water 
for 3-5 min*, and neutralized immediately with 5 N sodium hydroxide 
(methyl orange), and made up to 25 ml* volume. A 10 ml. aliquot

of the neutralized solution is transferred into a wide 30 ml, 
test-tube, 5 ml# of alkaline potassium ferricyanide solution is 
added, and the mixture is again boiled on a water-bath under a 
condenser for 15 min c The test-tube is again cooled and addi- 
tions are made of 5 ml* of potassium iodide reagent and 3 ml, of 
5$ acetic acid# The mixture is titrated with approximately 
N/75 sodium thiosulphate, using as an indicator a 1% starch solu¬ 
tion saturated with NaCl p until the disappearance of the blue 
color# 


A blank determination is mad© by using 10 ml# solanine 
extract neutralized immediately and titrated as above, after boil¬ 
ing the mixture with the alkaline ferricyanide solution# The 
difference between both values measures the increase of reducing 
power due to hydrolysis of solanine (equivalent of reduced ferri- 
cyanide)* 

The N/75 thiosulphate solution is standardized each 
day, using an acidified 2% potassium iodide solution and starch 
as indicator, and is calculated in terms of 0*01 normality* 

The solanine equivalent of the unknown extract aliquot 
is then calculated with reference to a regression line constructed 
by the use of known solanine concentrations treated in the above 
manner# The regression line was again conveniently calculated 
per 50 ml* volume, the final volume in which the extracted solanine 
was dissolved prior to colorimetric or hydrolytic methods*

(3) Estimation of solanidine 

The amount of solanidine present may be estimated 
only by the difference between colorimetric ("total solanine 11 ) 
and hydrolytic (solanine only) readings* A direct method for 
estimation of the alkaloid in plant material has yet to b© de¬ 
veloped, and the results of the above determination procedure 
are subject to an accumulation of experimental errors that may 
be involved in the colorimetric and hydrolytic analyses*

EXPERIMENT I 

SOIL TYPES, GEOGRAPHIC LOCATIONS AM) VARIETAL DIFFERENCES AS 
THEY AFFECT TUEER SOLANINE CONTENT 


Total solanine analyses were carried out on mature 
tubers of fifteen potato varieties produced in 1953 on three 
representative soil types, as noted previously* The three loca¬ 

tions were at Brooks, Fallis and Edmonton* 

Despite the fact that some possibly important uncon¬ 
trolled factors, such as fertility levels and variation in weather, 
were operative in the trial, new and useful information was anti¬ 
cipated* The solanine concentrations of Alberta-grown potatoes 
might deviate from those reported by Wolf and Dug gar (59) who 
used tubers produced under very different environmental conditions* 
Moreover, there is no clear evidence that potatoes when removed 
from the soil are already bitter, except those that are sunburned, 
although this assumption is encountered frequently in reports on 
solanine research* 


Experimental Material 

It was recognized that tuber samples should be pre¬ 
pared for analysis with the shortest possible time laps© after 
harvest; and that during harvest all factors suspected of in-

fluencing increases in solanine should be controlled 0 This 

applies particularly to exposure of tubers to light and to low 
temperatures (62)* This task was not achieved to complete sat¬ 
isfaction, as over 500 samples for all experiments had to b® 
harvested, transported and prepared quickly for storage at 0° F* 
The principal deviation from the desired conditions occurred in 
the transport of tubers from the Brooks trial to Edmonton, during 
which very cold autumn weather was encountered* It was not pos¬ 
sible to prevent some tuber exposure to low temperatures ( 35 ° F* 
range)• 

During the growing season the plants showed normal 
growth, producing somewhat smaller vine growth and tuber yield 
in the gray-wooded soil; however, satisfactory uniform samples 
of four to six tubers, each about 100 gm» in weight, were harves¬ 
ted from randomly chosen single hills* The conditions of harvest 
may be important and will be briefly discussed* 

The experimental plot on the brown-soil zone at Brooks 
was harvested first on September 30, followed by harvest on 
October 5 at Fallis of the gray-wooded soil, and that on black 
soil on October 6 at Edmonton* Single-hill samples were collec¬ 
ted in paper bags, one from each block (i*e*, four per variety), 
designated with block (replicate) number, and placed immediately 
under a thick cover of jute sacking* The harvest at Edmonton 
was carried out under ideal warm and cloudy conditions, while a

bright sunny day prevailed during harvest at Pallis 0 The least 
desirable conditions were encountered during the harvest at Brooks, 
when rather lo%* temperatures (about I|_0° F.) and a very bright 
sunny day were experienced. All samples after harvest were 
placed at 45° F. storage in complete darkness, and were processed 
as soon as possible for analysis* The task could not be com¬ 
pleted in less than two weeks after harvest, and it is thought, 
as will be discussed later, that certain undesirable conditions 
during this period may have influenced solanine concentrations* 

The total number of variates for this experiment included three 
locations, four blocks (replicates) and 15 varieties; 60 samples 
from each location, and 12 for each variety, making a total of 
180 samples. 


Experimental Results and Discussion 

A considerable variation of solanine concentrations 
was encountered in replicated samples from the same locality and 
within varieties on all three sites. Such a variability within 
a single variety - and even between tubers of a single hill - 
has been observed previously in potato bitterness investigations 
(27, 62). This characteristic makes the correct interpretation 
of the results the more difficult* 

Site influence 

Solanine concentrations of the 15 potato varieties 
at the three locations are presented in Table 1, and complete

data, including calculated data for analysis of variance, are 
presented in Appendix I* 

Potato samples from the brown soil plots show slight¬ 
ly higher levels as eight of 15 varieties recorded the highest 
means, while from the gray-wooded-soil zone five varieties, and 
from the black-soil zone only two varieties recorded the highest 
mean values* The difference, however, is not consistent, as the 
Brooks samples also showed five of the lowest means© Therefore, 
it is not surprising that when the data were subjected to analysis 
of variance the influence of locations was found to be of insig¬ 
nificant nature (P value of 2©lj.2 compared to 2©95 required at the 
five percent level)© There is a significant interaction of 
"locations x varieties" (P value of 3®70 compared to 1*85 re¬ 
quired at the on© percent level), and this is attributed to the 
fact that the highest mean values of all varieties are not con¬ 
sistent with the location© There is a possibility, too, that 
the slightly higher levels at Brooks and Fallis locations could 
be a result of the conditions durihg transport© 

The degree of variability in solanine concentrations 
is demonstrated by the fact that even in replications there was 
a significant P value of 3©9X* compared to 3®93 required at the 
one percent level© The greatest variability was encountered in 
Canus variety, which shows values from if.3 to 89 p*p©m© solanine 
in brown soil, 30 to 3k p*p*m© in gray-wooded soil, and 27 to

shown by Manota (52 to 92 , 4-0 to 56, and 27 to 55 p*p*m., respec¬ 
tively) • 

The foregoing considerations have led to the assump¬ 
tion that the differences in solanine concentrations are due 
rather to natural variation than to the influence of soils in dif¬ 
ferent locations* Therefore, it seemed plausible to illustrate 
total solanine levels for each variety as means of replicates at 
all three plots* These data are presented in Table 2*

The calculated deviation ranges of varieties showing 
maximum and minimum levels are illustrated in Figure l}-* Stand¬ 
ard deviations of 22 and 19 p.p®m® for Canus and for £0-7 indi¬ 
cate the extreme variation in so la nine, yaich suggests an insta¬ 
bility of varietal character as far as alkaloid synthesis is 
concernedo On the other hand, the extremely low variability of 
Irish Cobbler (3 p*p*m® deviation for 12 samples) denotes a high 
stability in this regard, which is noted to lesser extent in the 
C-16 and Latowski varieties* 

Varietal influence 

The differences between varieties exceeded the one 
percent level of significance (F value of 7*12 compared to the 
required 2*8 for high significance)* The highest and lowest 
mean solanine concentrations were in Early Dewey (76 p*p®m® ) and 
in variety 177 (19 p*p*m®)® These differences demonstrate that 
the rat© of solanine synthesis is determined through heritable 
characteristics of the varieties* 

As the main interest in potato bitterness investiga¬ 
tion is centered about the well-known ability of the Netted Gem 
variety to synthesize large amounts of solanine within a short 
time, the remaining lip varieties are compared to this variety on 
the basis of the calculated L«S®D. of 22 p*p®m* for the on© per¬ 
cent level of significance® A division into two groups may be 


mad© arbitrarily on the following bases; (1) the varieties which

normally produce solanine concentrations above 37 p*p*m. of fresh 
tuber weight* and (2) varieties in which mean concentrations do 
not exceed this limit. 

The authority for the development of this classifica¬ 
tion is supported by the results of analyses on pairs of tuber 
samples suspected of being bitter and received from farmers in 
various locations of the Province. Netted Gem variety (always 
represented in these paired samples) has shown very high concen¬ 
trations, while the other variety of the sample seldom reached a 
dangerous level* The normal solanine levels for Netted Gem and 
Early Ohio were higher than those determined by Wolf and Dug gar 
(59) 9 while those of Katahdin, Warba and Irish Gobbler were lower. 

In spite of the large variation between replicates 
and localities, the individual concentrations of all 180 samples 
were quite low, and much below a level which could indicate bitter¬ 
ness observable to taste. Only eight samples out of 180 (If.4 
percent) exceeded the 90 p.p.m. level (five at Brooks, two at 
Fallis and one at Edmonton), with the highest readings being found 
in Early Ohio (102 p.p.m.), Manota (100 p.p.m.) and Early Dewey 
(97 p.p.m.). The low percentage of samples reaching the 90 p.p.m. 
concentration demonstrates that, under the conditions of this 
trial, bitter tubers are not produced during the plant and tuber 
development in the field. (Exceptions would be green, sunburned 
tubers.) High solanine build-up, then, may most frequently be 








a result of post-harvest conditions* Similar observations were 
made in an earlier phase of potato bitterness work, when over 
150 mature tuber samples of Netted Gem, Katahdin and Carter»s 
Early Favorite, prepared for analysis and quick-frozen within a 
few hours after harvest, did not exceed 50 p*p«m. values (62) ® 

There is, then, a strong implication that a study of 
factors causing potato bitterness should concentrate on condi¬ 
tions after harvest, particularly the handling of potatoes during 
harvest and in the first stages of the post-harvest rest period,, 
There is still a possibility that certain responses to growing 
conditions may be delayed and become operative only later during 
the storage period®

EXPERIMENT II 


SOLAR RADIATION EFFECTS UPON THE SOLANINE CONTENT 
OF MATURE TUBERS 


This experiment respresented the major phase of the 
potato bitterness work* in which confirmation was sought con¬ 
cerning certain conditions thought to be responsible for the dis¬ 
order* The trial was designed to study the variables suggested 
under n Study Ob jectives* 11 


Experimental Material and Treatments 

The growing conditions of the plots at Brooks, 
Edmonton and Fallis, from which experimental material was taken, 
are discussed in an earlier section* Potato samples of eight 
randomly selected varieties were exposed to solar radiation for 
periods of eight and ?2 hours, and the storage duration and the 
locations represented additional variables* The eight-week 
storage period was included to test possible differences that 
might not b© apparent at the end of the irradiation treatments* 

A total of If.8 samples from Experiment I were used as 
control for the exposed and unstored tubers, in order to avoid 
unnecessary duplication of analyses on the same tuber material* 
These samples were, designated as controls at the time ^aen samples

for Experiment I were taken# An additional set of L\.Q samples 
was needed to control the effects of the eight-week storage 
treatment# 


In each locality, 12 single-hill samples per variety 
(three from each replicated block) were chosen at random® To 
these 12 samples (two replicates of two storage durations and 
three exposure treatments), the future treatments were randomly 
assigned at harvest time# 

The total number of variables thus included eight 
varieties, three localities, two replicate samples and six exper¬ 
imental conditions; totalling 288 samples for the whole experi¬ 
ment# 


The exposure treatments were as follows* (a) no ex¬ 
posure, control samples; (b) washed, mature tubers exposed con¬ 
tinuously for eight hours to direct sunlight in the field; 

(c) continuous open-air exposure for three days and three nights® 

The macerated tubers were quick-frozen for soIsnine 
determination immediately at the end of the exposure periods, and 
after an eight-week storage period# In the latter case, the 
loss of weight due to the storage conditions had to be recorded 
for correction of solanine concentrations# In both eases, the 
temperature and humidity flucuations were recorded®

Th© eight-hour solar-radiation exposure was carried 
out on October 11, 1953 (8:30 a.m® - 4:3® p®m®), and the 72-hour 
exposure from October 10 (5:00 p®itu) until October 13 (5:00 p®m®)® 
The shorter exposure was applied on a warm, sunny day, although 
it was hoped that temperatures would be lower than actually pre¬ 
vailed© The temperature for three and one-half hours was above 
60° F® (with a maximum of 63° F®), for four hours between 50° 
and 60° F®, and for a half-hour was below 50° (minimum of 48° F®)® 
The first half of the exposure was bright and sunny, while during 
the latter half the light became somewhat hazy® The humidity 
during exposure was above 80% at the start, decreased to 40 % at 
the end of the day, and varied between 60% and \\.0% in the after¬ 
noon® 

During the 72-hour exposure, peaks of 63°, 62 0 and 
61° F. were recorded during the daytime, and overnight minima 
were 48°, 35° and 34° The total exposure below 4®° F» lasted 

for 20 hours, above 60° F. for 10 hours, while in the remaining 
42 hours the temperature was fluctuating between 4®° and 60° F® 

The humidity readings were mostly above 80% during the night-time, 
while daytime readings fell below 4®/^ only for four hours on th© 
last day of exposure (minimum of 35% H®E®)® The temperature 
during the eight-week storage period fluctuated between 44° and 
li-8 0 P. 

A summary of temperature and humidity data is pre¬ 


sented in Appendix. IX-D 






Experimental Results and Discussion 


In all varieties, except Irish Cobbler, striking 
solanine concentration increases were observed as a result of 
both periods of exposure, and relatively little change took 
place during the subsequent storage period. Only "varieties 11 
and "exposure treatments" were found responsible for changes in 
solanine levels beyond the one percent level of significance, 
while the growing conditions of the three locations and the stor- 
age conditions did not seem to influence the synthesis of solanine 
to an appreciable extent. 

Solar radiation exposure effects 

The tremendous effect on solanine synthesis of solar-* 
radiation exposures, and particularly of the longer period, is 
evident from the data in Table 3, and from the maximum concentre** 
tions of individual samples reached in the varieties Netted Gem 
(396 PoPoDio), Early Dewey (350 p.p.m*) and Early Ohio (313 p.p.m*)* 
The original data appear in Appendix II-A. The analysis of 
variance gave an exceedingly high value of significance (F value 
of 180.76, as compared to 18.0 required at the one percent level), 
and the required L.S.D. value was exceeded in both solar radia¬ 
tion exposures (see Appendix II-B) * 

During the eight-hour exposure, a rapid rate of sola- 
nine synthesis is initiated and this ranges from li| to 53 p.p.m*

with a mean increase over control of 33 p*p.m* In the 72-hour 
exposure, a further increase was noted (mean increase over con¬ 
trol, 134 p.p*m*)* In relation to the length of exposure, this 
increase does not appear to be proportional, but seems rather to 
be limited by the capacity of a variety to synthesize solanine, 
and also by some internal limiting factor# This limiting factor 
becomes more pronounced as the exposure treatment progresses, 
and might be linked either to metabolic changes or to an accumu¬ 
lation of the products of synthesis* The apparent reduction In 
the rate of synthesis could not be accounted for by the lower 
temperatures during the latter part of the 72 -hour exposure* 

It will be shown in a later trial (Experiment V) that low tempera¬ 
tures promote, rather than decrease, the efficiency of light ex¬ 
posure in solanine synthesis* 

The increases in solanine concentration as a result 
of solar-radiation exposure are very consistent* In the lj.8 
samples taken from, the short-exposure treatment, only two samples 
failed to exceed the concentrations of comparable control samples 
from the same location, with differences of only 3 and Ik p*p,m«, 
respectively* The experimental error of the analytical method 
is of the order £3 percent* In the 72-hour exposure, with the 
exception of Irish Cobbler variety, the solanine concentrations 
were 3*3 to 8*6 times higher than in the control samples; and 
the concentrations of the eight-hour exposure samples were lower

than those of the 72 -hour exposure in all but one of the 4.8 
samples 0 


Another fact to be noted from Table 3 is the shift 
of deviation ranges towards higher valvies* The standard devia¬ 
tions ranged in control samples from 2 to 20 p«p*m 0 ; in the 8« 
hour exposure from 8 to 39 p*p.m«; and in the longest exposure 
from 38 to 53 p.p.m* Generally, the higher the concentrations 
of solanine in tubers, the larger are the deviations that are 
encountered, which indicates a high degree of variability in the 
response between individual tuber samples© This effect is il¬ 
lustrated in the histogram of Figure 5* Because of the extreme 
values and deviations in the 72 -hour exposure, the analysis of 
variance was not carried out on the original non-homogeneous sola- 
nine data, but instead these data were subjected to the logarithmic 
transformat ion» The analysis of the transformed variance data 

appears in Appendix XI-B. 

It could be assumed that with an increasing rate of 
solanine synthesis, the supply of some of the precursory building 
materials sooner or later might become limited or exhausted, re¬ 
sulting in an eventual decreased rate of synthesis© The lag 
period may not be coincident in all samples and might account 
for the variability of final solanine levels* 

Varietal influence on solanine 

The differences between the varieties exceeded the 
one percent level of significance (F value of l5l©08, as compared

to 2*75 required at the one percent level). The differences are 
obvious from inspection of data in Table 3, from which will be 
noted the lack of response of the Irish Cobbler variety to syn¬ 
thesize solanine under conditions wherein some other varieties 
produced extremely high concentrations. This presents clear 
evidence that the rate, and possibly the extent, of synthesis is 
to a certain degree a varietal characteristic* 

According to the solanine levels produced, three dif¬ 
ferent classes of varieties may be arbitrarily distinguished: 

(1) Varieties in which the increase after the 72-hour 

exposure was In excess of 150 p.p„m*: Netted Gem 

(mean increase 223 p*p*m*). Early Dewey (I 96 p.p 0 m*). 
Early Ohio (162 p.p.ra*), and variety 177 (153 P»Pom*). 
In the first three varieties, the alleged toxic level 
of 200 p*p*m* was exceeded, and these should be 
classed as varieties that are predisposed to develop 

a dangerously high degree of bitterness* 

(2) Varieties with an obvious ability to develop sola- 
nine readily, but where the mean increase Is less 
than 150 p»p*m*, include: Katahdin ( 10 ij. p.p.m* mean 
increase), C-16 (102 p.p.m*), and > 0-3 (95 p*p* m*)* 

In these varieties, the synthesis of solanine appears 
to proceed at a sluggish rate. The apparent in¬ 
ability to reach the toxic level is assumed to be 
limited by an internal factor « such as lack or un-

availability of a precursory compound, or inhibition 
of a particular enzyme which may be required for one 
of the steps of the biochemical reaction chain* 

(3) The variety Irish Cobbler represents a class in which 
abnormal synthesis of solanine apparently does not 
take place* This may be due either to the presence 
of a "balancing” mechanism or absence of suitable 
precursory building material* The negligible in¬ 
crease of 35 p*p«m* for this variety, in which. 80 p # p®m* 
concentration was exceeded only in three of the If.8 
exposed samples. Is further grounds for the thesis 
that the ability to synthesize abnormal amounts of 
solanine depends on inherited characteristics® 

It appears that varieties in class (X), which easily 
become abnormally bitter, are provided with a generous supply of 
building materials and a complete synthesizing mechanism® More¬ 
over, this mechanism seems easily set in motion under favorable 
conditions® In varieties of class (2), the imperfactions of a 
labile synthesizing mechanism might account for a sluggish synthe¬ 
sis up to a certain level at which some limiting factor prevents 
further build-up® 

Site influence 

The growing conditions at the three locations did 
not exert any significant influence upon the rate of synthesis.

although some effects appeal’ to be reflected on solanine levels 
of some varieties at the end of storage, as indicated by the 
significant interation "locations x storage x treatments* n This 

is attributed to somewhat higher concentrations in the stored 
samples from Brooks in the short exposure, and from Edmonton and 
Fallis samples only in the 72-hour exposure, while unstored 
samples from Brooks showed higher concentrations for both periods 
of solar-radiation exposure* 

Storage influences 

Although the variance due to a period of storage 
proved neglibible (P value less than one), some minor differences 
were noted* In the varieties 177 and 50-3, there are slight 
increases at the shorter light exposure, but decreases are ob¬ 
served at the longer exposure* At the 8-hour exposure, there 
was, in general, little change in solanine levels with the excep¬ 
tion of the Early Dewey and Early Ohio varieties, which had con¬ 
centrations greater than 100 p*p*m* to begin with* In the stored 
tubers of the 72-hour exposure, an additional increase was regis¬ 
tered in the Netted Gem and Early Dewey varieties, which have a 
high solanine production potential (7lp and 60 p*p*m*, respective¬ 
ly), Varieties 50-3 and 177# sis mentioned above, actually de¬ 
creased in solanine content in storage after the tubers had 
received the three-day exposure* These decreases were Ip 1 and 
k0 p.p *m*, respectively, and are thought to be caused by relative-

ly high weight losses (mean 3»3% in 50-3 and LiJ±% in 177) which 
could have resulted from a tissue rupturing., for in many cases 
the latter two varieties showed a severe cracking of tubers with¬ 
in a short time after the harvest* Rupturing of ©ell tissues 
could induce activity of enzymes participating in hydrolysis and 
degradation of the solanidine molecule, although we have no ex¬ 
perimental evidence to support this suggestion* 

The slight solanine content increase in other vari¬ 
eties might be due to experimental error or the variability of 
solanine within the tuber samples, escept in the case of Katahdin, 
where an additional synthesis and a mean increase of j?0 p*p*m* 
was noted* This increase was found to be due to a relatively 
large difference in the solanine levels of unstored and stored 
72-hour-exposure samples from the Edmonton site (127 and 252 p «p*m», 
respectively)* In view of the sluggish rate of synthesis in 
all other samples of Katahdin, this increase seems to be paradox¬ 
ical®

EXPER MCNT III 

THE INFLUENCE OF PHOTOPERIOD UPON POTATO TUBER SOLA NINE CONTENT 


An experimental plot of Netted Gem and Katahdin 
potatoes, grown at the University during 1953* was used for treat¬ 
ments designed to determine whether the photoperiod during th© 
tuber-set season had an influence upon solanine concentration in 
mature tubers. 


The shortening of the photoperiod was achieved by 
the use of a wooden frame covered with black cloth (Fig. 6), of 
3x5x6 dimensions in feet. The frame could be easily set in 
place over 12 plants of two adjacent rows of Netted Gem and 
Katahdin varieties. The rows selected were on the north side of 
the plot, the next row to the south being planted four feet away, 
and a two-foot space was left between the frame and the next plants 
in the two treated rows. The duration of daylight available to 
the plants was reduced to eight hours and 30 minutes by removal 
of the frame at 8:30 a.m. and replacement of it at 5:00 p.m. 

This treatment was applied during the tuberization stage from 
July 20 until harvest on September 22, 1953* a total of 58 days. 
Adjacent plants unaffected by the shad© of the box received the 
normal long photoperiod of lip to 16 hours under Central Alberta 
conditions.

Experiments III and IV. Not© the shading 
frame used for shortening the photoperiod.

The plants under short and long photoperiods showed 
normal development, although an earlier maturity of vines and 
slightly smaller tubers and lower yields were observed in plants 
under the short photoperiod. Low yields, however, were common 
to all plants of the plot, probably due to relatively late plant¬ 
ing (June 4) and to heavy rainfal and little sunshine during the 
season. The potatoes were harvested 110 days after plantingo 

Five to seven tubers of medium size were selected 
from single-hill samples, one-half of them being prepared im¬ 
mediately for analysis, the other half being first stored for an 
eight-week period® The loss of weight occurring in storage was 
recorded for correction of salanine concentrations* 

The total number of variables included two varieties, 
two photoperiods, two storage durations and three replicates - 
a total of 24 samples* 


Experimental Results and Discussion 

The analytical results, presented in Table 4# show 
very low solanine concentrations in all samples, particularly in 
the Netted Gem variety. 

There is a trend towards higher levels in tubers pro¬ 
duced under shorter photoperiod in both varieties, but this effect 
may be the result of having to use somewhat smaller tubers for 
the short photoperiod samples. The sample weights are recorded

variation appears to be due to natural solanine variability or 
to analytical procedure, rather than to the imposed conditions® 
Because of the very low concentrations found in all cases, no 
statistical analysis of the data was carried out® 

Although minor differences between short and long- 
photoperiod tubers were noticed, the results can be considered as 
negative with respect to photoperiod effect, and as additional 
evidence that solanine concentrations of freshly harvested tubers 
are generally low and within normal variation, as concluded from 
the results of Experiment I® Tuber size is known to influence 
solanine concentrations {6, 59 ) 9 and the variation found within 
this trial may well be due to that factor and to experimental 
error® Thus it means that a decrease of total radiant energy is 
not likely to be responsible for abnormal solanine synthesis® 
Moreover, the negligible changes observed after the eight-week 
storage period exclude the possibility that the photoperiod during 
tuber development may exercise a delayed effect during storage®

EXPERIMENT IV 


LIGHT AND TEMPERATURE EFFECTS ON SOLANINE IN STORED TUBERS 


Earlier work on this phase of the bitter-potato 
problem has suggested that illuminated tubers can show different 
degrees of bitterness depending upon prevailing temperatures 
(62). The trial reported here was undertaken to determine, if 
possible, how direct a relationship might exist between tempera¬ 
ture and light from the standpoint of solanin© build-up. 


Experimental Material and Procedure 

The material for the experiment was collected from 
the 1953 Edmonton plot wherein plants also were treated for photo- 
periodic effect. Tubers of Netted Gem and Katahdin varieties 
were utilized for the trial, which was carried out In two inde¬ 
pendent phases: (1) Tubers were placed in continuous dark stor¬ 

age at two temperatures ( 44 ° - 48 ° F. and 54 ° - 62° F.) for periods 
up to eight weeks* and (2) a continuous illumination of tubers 
in the first eight days after harvest. The tubers in (2) also 
were subjected to the same two temperature levels. Samples In 
triplicate for each treatment were analyzed for total solanin© 
at intervals of 0 (control), 2, 4? & and 8 weeks or days, respec¬ 
tively. Illumination was provided by a 100 W. Mazda lamp sus¬ 
pended about 30 inches above the exposed tubers.

Control samples were prepared for analysis and 
stored in the frozen state on the day of harvest (October 16). 

The samples stored in darkness were kept from October 16 until 
December 11 , and the tubers necessary for a three-replicate sample 
were removed for analysis at two-week intervals. 

The tubers placed in the lighted storage were 
sampled at two-day intervals between October 22 and 30. Humidity 
and temperature data for both phases of the trial were recorded, 
but the fluctuations were too slight to have had any influence 
upon the main factors being tested. Sample weights were recorded 
at the start and the finish of each treatment, and the solanine 
concentrations were corrected for weight losses where necessary. 

The number of variables included two temperatures, 
two varieties, five sampling dates and three replicates, giving 
a total of 60 samples for each of the two divisions of the work. 

The desirability of weekly sampling in the case of 
dark vs. light stored tubers, and daily sampling in the effect of 
continuous illumination trial, was suggested by preliminary observa¬ 
tions, in which solanine increases occurred slowly in tubers kept 
in the dark, and near-toxic levels were reached within a week 
after illumination (62). Because of the differences in sampling 
dates, both trials have to be discussed and tested for significance

a slow increase in glycoalkaloid content at both temperatures, 
while Katahdin does so only at higher temperatures* The dif¬ 
ferences are statistically significant, as illustrated by the re¬ 
gression lines in Figure 7 and Table 5® 

There is some doubt as to whether a toxic level of 
200 p®p®m® fresh tuber weight would be reached in a normal storage 
period, in view of the slow rate at which the glycoalkaloid was 
synthesized under these conditions® The maximum solanine content 
recorded for any sample was XOij. p.p.m® in one Netted Gem lot after 
the full eight weeks 1 storage® The largest overall increase is 
seen in the first two-week interval of storage, but in Netted Gem 
at the low temperature the rise appears steady and nearly pro¬ 
portional, indicating the absence of any interfering factor or 
factors® The relative irregularity of the rate of increase at 
the high temperature probably is due to differences in the meta¬ 
bolic state or the degree of maturity of the sample tubersi an 
effect, in any case, that must be caused by the higher temperature® 

The analysis of variance (see Appendix XV-B) shows 
no significant difference between the two varieties, but a sig¬ 
nificant difference exists in the interaction of "variety x 
storage duration” (F = $ compared to P = 3*86 required at the 

one percent level). This is undoubtedly a result of the incon¬ 
sistent response of Katahdin tubers at low temperature at the 
six and eight-week exposures* The lower values for Katahdin

samples at low temperature for the last two sampling periods in¬ 
dicate differences in the rate of glycoalkaloid synthesis* 

The steady rate of solanine increase at low tempera¬ 
ture in Netted Gem tubers appears to be due to an uninhibited 
metabolic process* The respiratory rate which presumably is 
low under these conditions seems to favor the formation of secon¬ 
dary nitrogen products* In Katahdin at low temperature there is 
apparently a limiting factor which is removed or inactivated at 
high temperatures, and which may eventually be directly linked 
with respiration* A better understanding of the fluctuations 
might be feasible if changes in both free alkaloid and the glyco¬ 
side could be recorded « an extension of the study which was not 
possible here. Moreover, there is presently no reliable solani- 
dine test for tubers having a relatively low total solanine con¬ 
tent* 

(2) Light and temperature effects on the rate of solanine 

synthesis 

The analytical data in Table 6 show a consistent 
increase of mean solanine concentrations in all four conditions 
tested, although marked differences are evident in the behaviour 
of the two varieties* The difference between varieties is sig¬ 
nificant (F value of 9*95, compared to 7*35 required for the one 
percent level)* The effect of temperature is insignificant and

figure. The maximum reading for Netted Gem was 191 p.p.m. 

(low temperature), and for Katahdin 11|1 p.p.m. (high tempera¬ 
ture). The rate of increase in Netted Gem tubers at high 
temperature was sharply reduced after the initial quick increase, 
but at high temperature the rise was steady and suggests no 
interference of any limiting factors. 

The steep regression lines in Fig. 8 snow that if 
the illumination period is continued long enough, ultimately a 
sufficient amount of solanine will b© produced to exceed the 
toxicity level of 200 p.p.m. This is particularly true with 
Katahdin tubers at the higher temperature, and with Netted Gem 
ttibers under cooler conditions, a paradoxical result that sug¬ 
gests different genetic constitutions with respect to some in¬ 
hibiting or activating factor or factors. It is obvious that at 
any normal temperature range the effect of light exposure on 
tubers is to induce solanine synthesis. Varietal differences in 
content of solanine, and in the rate of solanine increase, are 
significant variables. Also, the interactions "variety x storage 
duration" and "variety x temperature" are significant, a result 
that is consistent with the data recorded in Table 6. 

The steady rise of solanine levels (in Netted Gem) 
appears to indicate an activation of a "solanine-balancing" 
factor, and such a factor may not be present in the variety 
Katahdin. On the other hand, the differences observed might be

due to varietal differences in pathways of metabolisra and. this 
may not be linked directly to respiration* 


It is interesting to note that the loss of tuber 
weight during the storage in absence of light is considerably 
higher than in the case of illuminated tubers, particularly to¬ 
wards the end of the storage (see Appendix IV-C)* Thus it 

appears that illumination results in a decreased respiratory rate 
(less weight loss), which may consequently favor secondary meta¬ 
bolic processes at the prevailing higher temperatures* With 
the exception of Netted Gem potatoes illuminated at low tempera¬ 
tures, an increased rate of solanine synthesis was noted at the 
higher temperatures*

EXPER IM ENT V 

SOLANINE AND SOLAN IDINE IN BITTER NETTED GEM POTATOES 


The relationship of the glycoside and free alkaloid 
in potatoes has received little attention® Solanidine is known 
to occur in sprouts of some potato varieties (13), and is also 
reported to appear in brown senescent potato vines (37)• An¬ 
other view is that the alkaloid does not occur naturally in free 
state and that its appearance might be due to the activity of 
certain hydrolyzing enzymes during the preparation of samples for 
solanine analysis (50) o Accurate studies on solanidine are dif¬ 
ficult because at the present time the only practical method of 
estimation in plant material is based on the difference between 
colorimetric and hydrolytic methods of solanine analysis, the 
latter of which requires a minimal total solanine amount of 150 
p 0 p*m 0 of fresh sample weight (47)o The presence of solanidine, 
therefore, cannot be determined in tubers with a low or normal 
content of solanine* During the 1954-55 season, potato samples 
of a highly bitter nature were very frequently secured for analysis, 
so obtaining suitable material for solanidine determinations was 
a simple matter* Also, highly bitter tuber material could be 
developed very readily by using solar radiation as an induction 
technique* The unusually high amounts of solanine that occurred 
frequently in the 1954 Alberta potato crop led to the question

as to whether this might be due to an accumulation of solanidine* 
The synthesis of the alkaloid undoubtedly precedes that of sola- 
nine* The following report outlines the procedure and results 
of an effort to determine whether solanidine is actually present 
in the free state in bitter tubers, and, if so, to establish its 
distribution within the tubers 0 


Experimental Material 

Samples of tubers in triplicate were exposed late 
in November, 1951}-, to solar radiation for periods of three, five 
and seven days* For most of the exposure period, the weather 
was bright, sunny and cool, with temperatures ranging from 26° 
to 59 ° F*, but remaining most of the time below 5>0° F« Light 
frost was recorded during three overnight periods, with minima 
of 26°, 32° and 28° F* on the first, fourth and sixth nights* 

The tubers were prepared immediately for analysis at the conclu¬ 
sion of each exposure period, and solanine determinations by both 
colorimetric and hydrolytic methods were carried out. For the 
latter procedure, the method described by Rooke et al (1{7) was 
used* These methods have been described in a special section of 
this thesis* 

Additional material was available from a number of 
bitter potato samples received from various parts of the Province* 
Solanine and solanidine determinations were carried out, and in

a sufficiently large sample received from Belmont, Alberta, 
separate determinations were made on peel and tuber flesh in order 
to determine the amount of solanine removed by peeling and the 
distribution of the glycoalkaloid, and of solanidine if present*

data show rather wide differences, so that the presence of the 
free alkaloid is strongly indicated,. It is unlikely that such 
consistent differences could be due to the lesser accuracy of 
the hydrolytic method. 

The results of the first phase of this trial confirm 
the view that temperatures near freezing point in combination 
with solar radiation are highly efficient in producing extreme 
concentrations of total solanine. It is interesting to note that 
the solanine as determined by the hydrolytic method shows a 
narrow range of variation from 347 to 441 p.p.m„, while the amounts 
of solanidine range widely from IjpO to 508 p.p.m. Thus it appears 
that within tfa© short time in which a rapid rat© of give ©alkaloid 
synthesis was induced the formation of the glycoside is limited 
to a certain degree by an internal fact or . 

The presence in the tubers of free solanidine, in 
amounts up to 50 percent or more of the total bitter components, 
indicates that the primary effect of solar* radiation and low 
temperatures is the synthesis of this substance. It appears that 
precursory compounds for such synthesis must be present to a de¬ 
gree that permits, within limits, a steady increase in the rate 
of the glycoalkaloid build-up. The uniform levels of solanine 
point towards some intervening factor, such as a limited supply 
of the three sugars or an inhibition of the participating enzyme 
system. 

* Initial levels of solanine ranged from 42 to 67 p.p.m.

That the free solanidine is converted rather slowly 
to solanine is indicated by analyses of bitter potato samples, 
all of them of Netted Gem variety, which were received from a 
number of growers and consumers. These bitter tubers were re® 
ceived and prepared for analysis at the dates indicated in Table 8 . 
It was assumed that the synthesis of solanidine occurred during 
or shortly after harvest, and considering the lapse of time, and 
the results shown in Table 7# it appears that the free alkaloid 
is eventually quantitative]^ converted at a slower rate to the 
glycoside. The significance of this process cannot be explained

without further collateral studies of internal metabolic changes, 
although from the scarce occurrence of solanidine in nature it 
might be postulated that relatively high concentrations may have 
a toxic effect upon the plant tissue itself and the conversion 
to the glycoside is only a natural defence mechanism within 
potato plants# 

A study of the data presented in Table 8 indicates 
that tubers must possess some means for a conversion of the free 
alkaloid to the glycosidal farm# 

Once positive evidence had been secured of the 
presence of solanidine in bitter potatoes, an attempt was made 
to determine the relative distribution of both components of 
bitterness* At the same time, information was sought as to the 
amount of solanine removed by peeling of potato tubers* A 
20-lb* sample of the bitter Belmont Netted Gem tubers was used 
for this investigation* 

The analytical results are presented in Table 9, 
and illustrated in Figures 9* 10* 

The peel represents only 13*9 percent of the total 
tuber weights; yet the peel and flesh contain the same amount 
of solanidine* Thus the concentration of solanidine in the peel 
is about six times higher than that in the tuber flesh* 

The distribution of solanine and solanidine within 
a tuber is of practical significance in estimating the amounts

which can b© removed from bitter potatoes by peeling. The large 
amounts of solanine in the flesh of bitter potatoes seems most 
probably to be a result of diffusion from the site of synthesis, 
as it is difficult to visualise that the actual build-up could 
take place in the inner cortex or pith regions of the tubers. 

The extremely high concentration of M total solanine” in the peel 
(13l|lj. p.p.m. fresh weight) lends support to the general supposition 
that synthesis is confined to this region*

Slight greening was observed in tubers exposed to 
sunlight (Table ?)• Because of this, it appears that at least 
a partial synthesis of chlorophyll takes place in the earliest 
phase of exposure effect, and this is coincident to or followed 
by solanidine synthesis* It is highly probable that the photo¬ 
synthetic rate exceeds that of respiration during the exposure 
and thus the energy products would be available for secondary 
metabolic conversion*

GENERAL CONCLUSIONS 


A series of solanine determinations under broad 
environmental conditions and involving many varieties has estab¬ 
lished the fact that the poisonous glycoalkaloid does not occur 
in abnormal amounts in maturing potato tubers prior to harvest. 
This is counter to the conclusions of many earlier workers, but 
is supported to a degree by Pallman and Schindler (39) and Wolf 
and Duggar (59) > who have shown that solanine levels in potato 
tubers decrease towards the end of the growing season. 

It appears that the potato plant possesses some 
mechanism to control either the rate of solanine development 
within the tuber, or the translocation of the substance from 
stems and leaves into the tuber. 

Solanine is maintained in the tubers at levels that 
at harvest are variable with the variety but that in no instance 
are high enough to cause bitterness, and it is postulated that 
a metabolic mechanism or a system of enzymes exert a control over 
the movement of solanine during normal growth. This does not 
exclude the possibility that environmental factors exert a de¬ 
layed-action effect that may not be evident until several weeks 
or months after harvest. 

Wolf and Duggar (59) have suggested that the low 
solanine content in tubers at maturity may be due to a 11 diluting”

effect of tuber enlargement. Whatever the reason, the experi¬ 
mental evidence presented here allows the conclusion that neither 
photoperiod alteration, soil type, nor geographic location (with¬ 
in Alberta) has an appreciable influence upon the glycoalkaloid 
content of the potato tuber. Earlier work at Edmonton has 
indicated that other environmental artifacts such as depth of 
planting, degree of hilling, top-killing, time of planting and 
application of fertilizers have no apparent influence upon whether 
or not bitterness develops in potato tubers ( 27 , 62)* 

Once the tuber is removed from the soil, it is sub¬ 
ject to an interaction of inherited and environmental factors, 
and under certain conditions the tuber may have initiated a 
rapid rate of solanine synthesis that in predisposed varieties 
leads to abnormal concentrations. The present work indicates 
that not only are the “normal* 1 concentrations of mature tubers 
dominated by heritable characters, but also the potential ability 
of a variety to maintain normal levels of solanine appears to 
be inherited. Thus it was not possible to develop bitterness 
in Irish Cobbler tubers under the same conditions that led to 
extreme bitterness in Netted C-em tubers. It is well-known that 
in tobacco breeding strains have been produced differing in 
ability to synthesize nicotine (18, 19). Also, a strain of 
tomatoes (Tlf-llj.) has been shown recently to produce a bitter tast¬ 
ing fruit, suspected to be due to formation of a glycoalkaloid, 
and crosses of this strain in later progeny tests show varying

degrees of bitterness, indicating that the ability to produce 


the bitter principle is heritable (9)* There is little doubt 
that the unidentified bitter component is similar, if not 
identical, with the glycoalkaloid tomatine, which has been re¬ 
ported as present in tomato plant leaves (ij-3, 5>0). From these 
examples, and in view of the varietal differences observed dur¬ 
ing the present investigations, it appears certain that increased 
or reduced ability for solanine synthesis depends on inherited 
genetic factors* 

Exposure of tubers to solar radiation showed that 
with most varieties a higher rate of solanine synthesis was evi¬ 
dent when low temperatures were a coincident factor. Alter¬ 
nating light and dark periods (day and night) with a parallel 
influence upon metabolic processes within the tuber, may play a 
part in the solanine synthesis rat© increase® It is thought 
that the availability of building materials may be related to 
the activity of enzymatic systems responsible for supplying and 
transforming compounds utilized in the individual steps of the 
alkaloid synthesis. 

Tubers of different varieties that showed a close 
similarity in solanine content at harvest time were exposed to 
incandescent light and at the same time to low and high tempera¬ 
ture storage. At the termination of the storage period, the 
variation in solanine levels was marked, indicating differential

varietal response to the conditions imposed. Varieties could 
be classified into three divisions: (a) those not subject to 
high concentrations under any conditions; (b) those capable of 
marked increase but not to levels of human toxicity (200 p.p.m.); 
and (c) those that readily reach dangerously high levels when 
environmental conditions are such as to encourage this synthesis* 
Positive effects of light, temperature and the interaction of 
the two factors also were observed. The variability encountered 
may be accounted for by differences in the stage of tuber rest 
period (metabolic state), tuber maturity and respiratory rate* 

The influence of the li^it and low temperature 
factors is certain to be the principal cause of the abnormally 
severe bitterness in many Alberta 1954- grown potatoes. Dan¬ 
gerous levels of solanine were noted, particularly from Netted 
Gem tubers, and in most cases a history was available,that in¬ 
cluded tuber exposure to light after harvest. The exposures 
varied from direct sunlight for a few hours to several days in 
subdued light (as on a garage floor), and were employed to dry 
off muddy tubers harvested from the wet, heavy soil. The 1954 
Alberta potato harvest coincided with a period of bright but 
cool weather, following very wet growing conditions. 

Potatoes that were not exposed to light prior to 
or during storage also showed a variety difference in the rate 
of synthesis of the poisonous compound during a two-month period.

Thus Katahdin tubers showed essentially no change at a low tem¬ 
perature but a moderate increase at the higher temperature* The 
reverse was true for tubers of Netted Gem variety, and the con¬ 
clusion of many earlier workers that solanine could not be syn¬ 
thesized in dark storage has been proved incorrect* While it 
appears that for an increased rate of solanine synthesis in 
Katahdin tubers, a decrease in the respiratory rate (excluding 
the photochemical influence), and the consequent release of one 
or more specific metabolites, is essential, the rate of synthesis 
in Netted Gem tubers does not seem to be limited by such a factor* 

The presence of free solanidine in bitter potatoes 
has now been established, and may point towards two separate 
phases or mechanisms of solanine production; (a) formation of 
the aglycone which proceeds rapidly at low temperatures in the 
presence of a photochemical stimulus* and (b) conversion to the 
glycoside, which does not necessarily require the presence of 
light* In all probability, the rate of the alkaloid conversion 
depends upon the availability of the three sugar components* 

Both processes appear to be controlled by genetic characteristics, 
since certain varieties only are able to produce high solanine 
concentrations* The formation of glycosides in at least two 
instances has been shown to be under the control of specific genes 
(3, 4.) • moreover, the necessity of photochemical reactions for 
the production of heterocyclic ring structures has been suggested 
by several authors (cit* 18)*

At the present time, the study of glycoalkaloid 
or alkaloid formation in vivo is confined to heritable or ex¬ 
trinsic factors responsible for lower or higher rates of syn¬ 
thesis # The approaches of the organic chemist and botanist to 
the general subject reveal little information with regard to 
the involved biosyntheses* The lack of a unified approach is 
ascribed to three deficiencies of alkaloid biochemistry (18): 

(a) The absence of any evidence that would relate alkaloids to 
definite biochemical or biophysical functions and thus explain 
their significance in the metabolism of plants that produce them; 

(b) the inability of research workers to date to demonstrate a 
direct relationship of alkaloids to anabolic and/or catabolic 
processes in the plant; although several reports maintain that 
alkaloid formation is parallel or related to some phase of nitro¬ 
gen metabolism ( 29 ); and (c) the powerful physiological effects 
of alkaloids introduced into the animal body are almost certainly 
concerned with some type of interference or inactivation of en¬ 
zyme systems, while the presence or absence of alkaloids in the 
plant tissues always seemed a matter of relative indifference to 
the plant itself (18); which probably accounts for the fact that 
these substances are generally assumed to be irreversibly formed 
end-products of secondary metabolic activities (7) 0 

The presence of solanine in tissues of high meta¬ 
bolic activity (33) and its degradation in senescent leaves (37), 
together with similar observations on Belladonna alkaloids (29),

point towards some necessary function of these compounds, al¬ 
though none of the present experimental techniques has been able 
to reveal such a function* 

Unfortunately, until definite uses of biochemical 
or biophysical nature can be established, perhaps by determining 
the locus of synthesis and the sequence and intermediates of 
the biochemical reactions (as well as related physical or chemi¬ 
cal processes), the comprehensive process of alkaloid biosynthesis 
will remain beyond understanding* 


SUMMARY 

The experimental evidence presented in this work 
established the following facts concerning initiation and the 
rate of solanine formation in potato tubers: 

1* Solanine concentrations in mature tubers is 

generally low due to the very slow rate of sola- 
nine synthesis in tubers grown in the absence of 
light and/or to the existence of a low rate of 
translocation during the vegetative growth. 

2* Abnormal rates of synthesis occur only in certain 
varieties possessing an inherited predisposition

for rapid solanine build-up if tubers of these vari¬ 
eties are exposed to favorable extrinsic conditions. 

Normal solanine formation (content) appears to be 
a varietal characteristic, presumably heritable, 
but seldom accountable for toxic levels in bitter 
potatoes* 

Abnormal synthesis of solanine requires a photo¬ 
chemical stimulus (solar radiation or artificial 
illumination), the efficiency of which appears gen¬ 
erally to be increased by a decrease in the tempera¬ 
ture at which the tubers are held. It is suggested 
that a ”solanine synthesizing” mechanism is set in 
motion, or a !, balancing” mechanism is inhibited by 
the effect of light and low temperatures® 

A natural slight increase of solanine levels 
appears to take place in the early phase of the 
post-harvest rest period of the tuber, which may con¬ 
tinue in some varieties for an extended period, while 
in others it may become limited by some unknown in¬ 
ternal factor. 

The aglycone solanidine is found in bitter tubers 
of Netted Gem variety, and under favorable condi¬ 
tions it is formed first at a very rapid rate, while 
the conversion to the glycoside appears to proceed 
at a slow and uniform rate.

APPENDIX VI 


Maintenance of Prepared Tuber Semples 

Experiment IV originally was designed to contain 
four replicateso However, because of the large number of 
samples involved in tuber material from a single growing season, 
and also because of the transfer of laboratory equipment to new 
premises, analyses of one replicate had to be postponed® When 
the samples of this replicate were defrosted for analysis after 
a 12-month storage period, the minced material showed an extreme 
blackening# Compared to the analyses of the first three repli¬ 
cates carried out after seven to eight months of frozen storage, 
approximately 30 to $0 percent of the solanine appeared to be 
lost, as shown in Table VI-A# The inclusion of such results

would introduce a serious error, and therefore the data from 
the fourth replicate were omitted,, Fortunately, the remaining 
three replicates sufficed to indicate the gross effects of treat 
ments imposed in the particular trial® 

Earlier in the work, in certain samples from other 
trials, attempts were made to prevent undesirable enzymatic 
activities in the frozen samples, and particularly during the 
maceration process* Although only a slight decrease in sola- 
nine concentration was noted in samples left for 20 hours at 
room temperature, the addition of glacial acetic acid to 0*5 
percent, or thiourea to 0 o 01 M concentration, appeared to pre¬ 
vent blackening of the minced tissue, due to inhibition of oxida 
tive enzymes* Some of the samples treated in this manner were 
kept in quick-frozen state without traces of blackening for as 
long as 12 months*

Samples which were not frozen until 20 hours after 
the mincing generally showed slightly lower levels of solanine, 
as well as extreme blackening of ground tissues, in all proba¬ 
bility due to enzymatic oxidation and to melanin formation. As 
the addition of acetic acid during the maceration prevented such 
a process and appeared to result in slightly improved extrac¬ 
tion, this procedure was adopted for sample preparation; but 
unfortunately too late to be useful in the present investigation, 
with the exception of tuber samples used in Experiment V* 

In addition to the effects noted above, experience 
showed that the macerated tissue should be stored in relatively 
tightly closed tinned or glass containers, since moisture losses 
in storage tend to increase the readings©

APPENDIX VII 


Notes on Field Sampling Technique 

Single-hill sampling, although statistically unsuit¬ 
able, was adopted for the following reasons: 

(1) To eliminate during the actual harvest any prolonged 
light exposure, which would be more likely to occur when harvest¬ 
ing all hills from a single replicate, since it would be necessary 
to spread out the tuber material and select four statistically 
appropriate samples (one for Experiment I and three for Experi¬ 
ment II)o This compares with the very brief exposure-interval 
necessary when a single entire hill is harvested as a sample* 

(2) To ensure selection of the necessary samples from com¬ 
pletely healthy hills. Leaf roll virus infection was widespread 
and serious in many varieties® 

(3) To secure tubers from a uniform depth, and to exclude 
any tubers produced near the soil surface* This did not appear 
to be feasible by the use of other sampling procedures. 

The effect of geographical locations was considered 
to be adequately tested by four randomized replications, and the 
biometrical inadequacies of the single-hill sampling technique 
were thought to be less serious than those involved in the exces¬ 
sive handling and exposure, had a large number of hills to be har¬ 
vested for bulking to provide a sample more representative of the plot

Observation of the data in Experiment I (see Appendix 
I-A) indicates that the significant P value for replicates 
(Appendix I-B) expresses the variance between , rather than within, 
a single location# This overall effect is attributed to the in¬ 
fluence of transport conditions and a delay in sample preparations 
(see text, p# 33)# Moreover, the single-hill technique was suc¬ 
cessfully employed in earlier work, when a negligible variation 
was observed in over 150 tuber samples of three potato varieties 
prepared for analysis within a few hours after harvest# In the 
majority of samples, the variation was frequently less than the 
error of the analytical procedure (62)#
