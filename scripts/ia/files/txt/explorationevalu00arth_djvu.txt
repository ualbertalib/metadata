SYNOPSIS 


The main purpose of this investigation was to eva¬ 
luate the SRA Primary Mental Abilities Test (Primary) as 
a suitable instrument for measuring the intelligence of 
first grade beginners in the Edmonton public school sys¬ 
tem, The criteria were the Detroit Beginning First-Grade 
Intelligence Test (Revised), the teachers 1 estimate of 
school progress, and a correlational study on the internal 
consistency of the Primary Mental Abilities test. 

Early in September the sRA test was administered to 
two hundred and twenty randomly selected first grade begin¬ 
ners. The Detroit test was administered to two hundred and 
one of the pupils of the same group in September. Five 
months later the teachers of this group rated one hundred 
and ninety-seven of them on school progress. The coeffi¬ 
cients of correlation between SRA and Detroit test scores, 
and between SRA test scores and teachers 1 rating, together 
with profiles of the mean scores of the PMA test and its 
subtests formed the basis of evaluation. 

With the exception of one area the study showed posi¬ 
tive evidence of the value of the SRA test as an instrument 
for measuring the intelligence of first grade beginners. 
However, because of the length and difficulties of admin¬ 
istration of this test the author does not recommend its

CHAPTER I 


BACKGROUND OE THE PROBLEM 

INTRODUCTION 

Parents and teachers alike are concerned about the 
progress of the first grade beginner. Will the child be 
happy and successful in his first venture in our schools, 
or will he become frustrated and depressed as a result of 
difficulty and failure? To insure optimum success and 
happiness for these beginners the school must know them. 
Teachers must become aware of pupils 1 interests, aptitudes, 
abilities, social relationships, family background, and 
adjustment to the social group, such information may be 
the result of careful observation of class and playground 
behavior or it may result from measurement. As for ability, 
scholastic aptitude, or what is commonly called intelligence, 
there is no substitute for scientifically developed tests of 
intelligence. 


WHY TEST SCHOOL BEGINNERS? 

Teachers, parents and counselors should do their best 
to make the beginner happy and successful during his first 
attempts at adjustment in the school environment. They 
should protect him from disastrous underachievement and 
harmful attempts at overachievement. Through the wise use 
of good intelligence tests they can discover his capacity

to do school work. They can learn whether he is ready to 
profit from school instruction. 

Knowing the individual pupil’s ability, the teacher 
is able to assign tasks that he is capable of doing success¬ 
fully. She is able to differentiate the work in the class 
in such a way that each child is working at the level of his 
ability. Without the knowledge of test results the teacher 
must teach at a level suited to an average six year old and 
wait for the faster and slower learners to identify them¬ 
selves by their work. The danger in this method is that the 
bright child may learn to do poor work and idle away the 
time and effort necessary to achieve the standard of which 
he is capable. At the same time the work may prove too dif¬ 
ficult for the slower learner, causing loss of status in the 
eyes of his peers. Thus, the roots of underachievement and 
over achievement have established themselves in members of 
the class even before the teacher is aware of their exis¬ 
tence and will create many problems for both teacher and 
pupil in future years. Tests, if properly used, will help 
us to avoid much of the difficulty. 

PROBLEMS ATTENDING THE TESTING 
OF BEGINNERS 

The measurement of intelligence is an exacting task 
at any age but it is particularly difficult in the case of

pre-school children who lack the common experiential back¬ 
ground which facilitates comparison. While they share the 
common element of chronological age, its significance varies 
widely with the breadth and richness of environment during 
the pre-school years. 

The first grade beginner is not test-wise; he is not 
even school-wise. The whole situation including the teacher 
is strange to him. It is difficult for him to concentrate 
all of his mental energies on the test problems, and it is 
even more difficult for the teacher to know whether or not 
he is putting forth his greatest effort. There are no pre¬ 
vious test results against which to compare his score, nor 
is there a school achievement record that can be used as a 
check on its validity. Thus, the test score is only a 
single datum, the accuracy of which may be doubtful. 

Two variables are, however, to a considerable extent 
under the administrators control: the test or tests used, 
and the techniques of administration. Obviously the test 
should be the best available. The Detroit Beginning First- 
Grade Intelligence Test has been used widely and for many 
years. A relatively new test in the field is the SRA Pri¬ 
mary Mental Abilities Test. It is the purpose of this 
study to determine if the SRA is equal or superior to the 
Detroit as a measuring instrument at the Grade One level.

CHAPTER II 


GENERAL STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM 

SELECTION OF INTELLIGENCE TESTS 
FOR BEGINNERS 

Several factors must be considered if the adminis¬ 
trator is to assure himself that he is using the best 
intelligence test available for school beginners. Often 
he must make a compromise between a number of desirable 
features since it is unlikely that he will find a single 
test that contains all of the elements that he desires. 

Three "musts” in any standardized test of intelligence are 
high reliability, validity and objectivity. After a test 
has been in use for a number of years research workers have 
usually established the extent to which it contains these 
qualities; the purchaser may discover it in their reports. 
However, a new test may not have been the subject of such 
research and the school may be committed to the necessary 
investigation to discover the extent to which it is consis¬ 
tent, dependable, and objective. 

The test should be easy to administer and score. 

Both a total score, from which an intelligence quotient may 
be easily computed, and a profile possessing some diagnostic 
value are desirable in the test results. The profile is at¬ 
tractive because it gives the results of samplings in seve¬ 
ral learning areas, from which the teacher may discover 
something of the pupil’s strengths and weaknesses.

The test makers should provide both age and grade 
norms for the test. The price of the answer papers, the 
time required to administer the test, and the ease with 
which It may be scored are other factors that ought to be 
considered. 

The format of the test is important. Items should 
be spaced in such a manner that they may be distinguished 
easily one from another. Pictures must be clear and free 
from confusing detail. Items that are interesting to the 
child are considered to be desirable. The possibility of 
more than one correct response to any problem is to be 
avoided. Most good tests require a minimum of physical 
activity on the part of the child in selecting his answers. 
Instructions to the testee should be at a level that is in¬ 
telligible to him so that the possibility of misunderstan¬ 
ding is minimized. 

HISTORICAL REVIEW OP GROUP TESTS 
FOR BEGINNERS 

Just as intelligence scales stem from the work of 
Binet, so group intelligence testing as a major movement 
developed from the work done in the United states Army in 
world War 1. It did not arise at that time as a wholly new 
undertaking, but group testing received a marked impetus 
from that work and its success. The tests developed at that

times were far from perfect and have become outmoded in 
spite of revisions from time to time. However, they un¬ 
covered many of the persistent problems of group measure¬ 
ment and established many of its characteristic concepts 
and methods.^ 

After World War I, group testing spread into the 
schools. First utilized in the upper grades, it was not 
until some years later that tests suitable to the pre¬ 
school child were developed. One of the first of these to 
become popular in the Canadian schools was the Pintner- 

p 

Cunningham Primary Test. This group test was published 
in 1923 and revised in 1938. The revised form is so much 
like the original that it is difficult to discuss one with¬ 
out referring to the other. Seven subtests, all using pic¬ 
tures or drawings are included, involving common observation, 
aesthetic comparison, associated objects, discrimination of 
size, picture parts, picture completion, and dot drawing. 

The test requires detailed instructions and accurate timing 
in minutes and even seconds on many tests. The administra¬ 
tion of the test is quite complicated; there are many 
detailed oral instructions. Some of the pictures are not 
as clearly reproduced as is desirable. 

The primary test is one of a series of four Pintner- 
Cunningham tests designed to measure the intelligence of 
pupils from kindergarten to grade twelve. JSach test of the

series has received careful statistical treatment and the 
statistical findings are given in the manuals. Norms for 
the tests are articulated with each other, making possible 
comparable measures at the various age levels. Scores may 
be expressed in almost any way which the user may wish: 
standard scores, ratio or deviation IQ, T s, percentile ranks, 
mental ages, or grade equivalents. While the task of admin¬ 
istering these tests is somewhat greater than that for some 
of the tests constructed more recently, there is evidence 
that they have been constructed with care, and may be em¬ 
ployed with good results. 

A second test to reach some measure of popularity was 

the Cole-Vincent Group Intelligence Test for School En- 
3 

trants. When it was first published in 1?24 it was con¬ 
sidered one of the better tests for the determination of a 
child's readiness for the work of the kindergarten and first 
grade. Its standardization was based on the scores of 1,171 
pupils whose Stanford-Binet mental ages were known. However, 
later scientific work in the field of developmental readi¬ 
ness has shown Its norms to be of questionable soundness. 
Parts of this test are very difficult even for well-developed 
five- and six-year-old children. 

Another popular test for pre-school children was the 

4 

Kuhlmann-Anderson Intelligence Test. This test was pub¬ 
lished in 1927 after ten years of preparatory work. It has

been revised five times and was printed for the twenty-fifth 
time in 1942. It has an ability range from grade one begin¬ 
ners through grade twelve. There are in all thirty-five sub¬ 
tests in the battery, many recurring at different age levels. 
These subtests were selected from a tentative list of one 
hundred possibilities on the basis of definite increase in 
scores attained at successive age levels. A unique feature 
of the scoring is that mental ages are obtained from tables 
of equivalence for each subtest, and the mental age of the 
subject is his median subtest mental age. 

The test is relatively hard to administer and score. 

Its norms are based on the scores of some thirty thousand 
children and are doubtless quite dependable. In the final 
analysis, the validity of the tests rests upon the judgment 
of the authors, whose wide experience and knowledge of the 
experience of others have undoubtedly enabled them to develop 
a good test. 

Reliability coefficients of the Kuhlmann-Anderson test 
are respected even less by the test makers than the validity 
coefficients. The authors maintain that the reliability of 
these tests results from careful scaling of difficulty, the 
care with which directions have been formulated, and the use 
of the median mental age method of scoring. These tests are 
probably much better than the authors 1 reasoning about vali¬ 
dity and reliability would lead one to expect. They will

continue to be widely used, largely because of their 
5 

brevity. 

The fourth test for pre-school children to reach a 
measure of popularity in Canada was the California Pre- 
School Mental Sealed This test, like the Kuhlmann- 
Anderson, is one of a battery. Its age range is from one 
and a half to six years. It measures memory, spatial re¬ 
lations, reasoning, vocabulary and motor coordination, to¬ 
gether with visual and auditory acuity. Age norms are sup¬ 
plied from which mental ages and intelligence quotients may 
be determined separately for the language and non-language 
tests, and then for the test battery as a whole. A diag¬ 
nostic profile permits one to appraise the relative strengths 

and weaknesses of the examinee in the various subtest areas. 

7 

Cronbach 1 describes this as a good test that is inade¬ 
quately standardized. He states however, that its mental 
age-intelligence quotient type of scoring is seriously mis¬ 
leading. 

The California test was published in 1937• The reli¬ 
abilities for the subtests run from .70 to .93 and for the 
totals from *90 to .96. The total test requires about 
ninety minutes. It is one of the most extensive of its 
kind, and the profile of scores presents a clear picture 

o 

of skills which have been found to be somewhat independent.

measuring the intelligence of school beginners was the Group 
Test of Learning Capacity: the Dominion Tests, formerly 
called Group Tests of Intelligence. There are four tests 
in this battery, the primary one of which was designed for 
kindergarten and grade one. This test was first published 
in 1^44. The authors prepared their own norms for this test 
using two other group tests to determine mental age equiva¬ 
lents for scores on their tests. The reliability of the 
test was obtained by the equivalent-form method using 932 
subjects. Incomplete data are given on item validity, al¬ 
though certain manuals indicate that the items in the final 

form were selected from a much larger number after a study 

9 

of their validity. 

The Detroit Beginning Jrirst-Grade Intelligence Test 
(revised edition) published in 1937 is another of the pre¬ 
school tests to win popularity in Canada. This test con¬ 
sists of ten subtests each with from four to seven items. 

The items are weighted from one to three. Bach subtest has 
a non-scored introductory item. 

The test is designed to aid in the classification of 
children entering the first grade. The present edition is 
a revision and extension of the widely used original form 
of the test. The test items were separately validated and 
weighted from the scores of three hundred children selected 
from all levels or degrees of brightness. The weighted

scores of one hundred and sixteen first grade children cor¬ 
related .76 with their mental ages as measured by the 
Stanford-Binet test. The reliability of the test was de¬ 
termined by correlating the weighted scores on the odd- 
numbered items of the test against the weighted scores on 
the even-numbered items. The resulting coefficient, based ■ 
on one hundred and sixteen first grade pupils representing 
an unselected sample of children in this grade, was found 
to be .^1 when corrected by the Spearman-Brown formula. The 
correlation between successive administrations of the same 

form of the test, based on four hundred and seven cases with 

,10 

a four month interval between testings, was found to be . 7 o. 

Age norms have been compiled from the weighted scores 
of 37,9? 6 first grade pupils. These norms are given in men¬ 
tal ages from which the intelligence quotient may be computed. 

THE PROBLEM 

The problem of this thesis is to explore and evaluate 
the utility of the sRA Primary Mental Abilities Test, as an 
instrument for measuring the intelligence of school begin¬ 
ners. 11

It is made up of about thirty-five test problems for each 
of the primary mental abilities defined by the test makers 
plus about seven practice items for each test. The problems 
are presented entirely by pictures which the child marks in 
response to oral directions given by the examiner. 

With the publication of this test in 1^4 6 the Thur- 
stones have extended their work on the factor analysis of 
mental ability to the early childhood level. In devising 
the new battery, the Thurstones used seventy tests including 
all of the known types for children of this age group to¬ 
gether with a number of newly devised tests. These were ad¬ 
ministered to two hundred children in kindergarten and first 
grade classes. On the basis of a factor analysis, five fac¬ 
tors, identified as Verbal-Meaning (V), Perceptual-Speed (P), 
Quantitative Motor (M), and Space (S), were isolated. 
Mental age norms for each of the five factors separately, and 
for V, P, Q, and S combined, were derived from approximately 
twelve hundred Chicago school children ranging from five to 
eight years of age. By extrapolation, standards for ages 
three to nine years were added. 



CHAPTER III 


EXPERIMalNTAL DESIGN 

The plan of procedure was to administer the SRA Primary 
Mental Abilities test to two hundred and twenty randomly se¬ 
lected first grade beginners. The scores obtained were then 
to be correlated with the scores of the same pupils on the 
Detroit Beginning First-Grade Intelligence Test. After the 
children tested had been under school instruction for five 
months they received a composite grading on their school 
progress by the class room teacher. This rating was also 
correlated with the Primary Mental Abilities test score. 

These coefficients of correlation together with a comparison 
between the mean scores obtained by this group on the SRA 
test and its subtests and that expected if the total popu¬ 
lation was tested were used as the criteria against which to 
evaluate the SRA test as a desirable instrument for measu¬ 
ring the intelligence of first grade beginners. It was 
assumed that if the sample were randomly selected and if 
the trait measured were normally distributed in the popula¬ 
tion then the mean scores when reduced to percentiles should 
not be significantly different from fifty. 

Preparations for administering the tests were made by 
the assistant superintendent of the Edmonton Public Schools.

made by their teachers under the guidance of the Director of 
Elementary Education and the author. 

INSURING OBJECTIVITY OF TEACHER RATING 

Teachers were not informed until late in January that 
they would be required to submit a special report on the 
testees. At this time, each teacher was asked to award 
marks to her whole class without consulting the list con¬ 
taining the names of the pupils in the sample. They were 
also asked to refrain from consulting the test scores of 
these children until after they had awarded their gradings. 
As a guide to assist in evaluating the progress of the mem¬ 
bers of their classes the teachers were given the following 
marking categories;

Arithmetic, Language, and Reading were the only subjects 
considered in judging the testees 1 school progress. These 
subjects were chosen because the teachers concerned believed 
that they were the only ones on which they could give a com¬ 
prehensive objective rating.

tested against the null hypothesis. The method consisted 

of comparing the critical ratio for an obtained coefficient 

of correlation with the value of UR that may be expected by 

chance at the .05 and *01 limits. The reliability was then 

checked by using Table 49 which indicates the values of 

correlation coefficients at the 5>» and 1> levels of con- 
13 

fidence. 

The value of t for a given r is computed from the 
formula t = , where r is the obtained coeffi- 

yl - * 

cient of correlation, N is the number of cases, and t is 
the critical ratio.^ 

A profile of the means was drawn up including the total 
scores obtained on the SRA test and the score on each of its 
subtests. These means were each tested to find if they dif¬ 
fered significantly from the means expected if the total 

population was tested. This was done through the use of 
14 

table 29* The critical ratio between the obtained means 
and the expected means was computed by the formula UR = ’ 

where D is the difference between the obtained mean and the 
expected mean and (Tb is the standard deviation of the ob¬ 
tained mean. 

If the value of the calculated UR proves to be greater 
than the value indicated in the table for a given degree of 
freedom the obtained mean is significantly different from

METHOD OF SELECTING THE SAMPLE 

Each of the classes from which the sample was taken 
was arranged alphabetically and numbered from one to the 
total number in the class. Pupils were then selected in 
the order of the following numbers until twenty were pro¬ 
cured from each class. In the small classes the number 
selected was less than twenty: 

56, 10, 8, 23, 35, 2?, 34, 14, 42, 32, 45, 15, 54, 2?, 46, 
20, 1, 22, 5, 51, 40, 55, 50, 17, 19, 28, 57, 24, 44, 12,

CHAPTER IV 


VALIDITY OF THE PRIMARY MENTAL ABILITIES

Coefficients of correlation were obtained from the 


formula r

<fx <fy 


where N is the number of cases 


and c x Cy is the product of the correction for the means of 
tests x and y, when means are calculated by the assumed mean 
method. 1 ^ 

The Primary Mental Abilities test was found to corre¬ 
late .8.54 with the Detroit Beginning First-Grade Intelligence 
Test and .642 with teachers’ estimate of school progress. 
Appendix A shows a typical calculation. 


RELIABILITY OF THE OBTAINED C OEFFICl ENTS 
OF CORRELATION 


Does an r of .64 between composite teacher gradings 
and test scores indicate a significant relationship? This 
question may be answered by testing the coefficient of cor¬ 
relation against the null hypothesis. The method consists 
in comparing the critical ratio for the obtained r, with 
the OR value to be expected by chance at the .0j> and .01 
limits as found in Table 29 of Garrett. 

Table I presents the statistical data. Column 2 gives 
the values of the coefficients of correlation between the

indicates the values of t computed from the formula

t z — yY lT ^ 2 >where t is used for determining the signifi¬ 
cance of a computed r on the null hypothesis in which r 
represents the obtained coefficient of correlation and N 
indicates the number of cases. The value of t is then read 
as 2.60 from Table 29 of Garrett, taking N - 1 degrees of 
freedom as 200. since the values of t in column 4 are much 
greater than the corresponding values of t at the .01 level 
of significance in column 5, the null hypothesis is rejec¬ 
ted; and each r is assumed to be significantly different 
from zero, since only once in 100 trials would a value of t 
as large or larger than 2.60 arise through accidents of 
sampling.

As a further check on this computation of t, direct 
use was made of Table 4? of Garrett* For 200 degrees of 
freedom the value of r must be *l8l to be significant at 
the .01 level. This value is less than either coefficients 
of correlation in Table I. 

Therefore, it may be stated that the correlation be¬ 
tween the SRA test and the criteria is significantly dif¬ 
ferent from zero. This is a very mild test of significance 
when used on data of this nature. 

In a general way we may say that the coefficient of 
correlation between the SRA and the Detroit tests is high, 
while that between the Primary and the teachers' rating is 
substantial or marked. Garrett suggests that an intelli¬ 
gence test score and an achievement score must correlate 
.70 or higher before the r can be considered high.

CHAPTER V 


INTERNAL CONSISTENCY OE THE SKA TEST 


The score on each of the five component parts of the 
test was correlated with the total test score* The corre¬ 
lations thus obtained, however, are spurious since each of 
the subtests is a part of the total score. Therefore it is 
necessary to obtain a total score without including the sub¬ 
score that is to be correlated with it, or, alternatively, 
to use a formula that will correct for the subscore that is 
included in the total. This correction will lower the r, 
since a total score correlated with a subscore, that is part 
of it, will necessarily yield a higher coefficient of cor¬ 
relation than the correlation of the two scores that are 
independent of each other. 

This correction was made by using the formula 

r-i f /r\ - ^1 

ritt-i; = - — - , where r is the co¬ 



efficient of correlation calculated by the product moment 
method, 1 represents the subtest, t the total test, and (T 


18 


the standard deviation 


It was found that the total score 


correlated .471 with V (Verbal-Meaning;, .244 with P (Per¬ 
ceptual-speed) , .510 with Q, (Quantitative; and .401 with a 
(Space;. The r between M (Motor; and the total score was 
.296 calculated by the Product Moment formula without using 
the correction formula since the total score does not in¬ 
clude the Motor score. Appendix G shows a typical calcula-

INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS 

The degree of relationship between the SRA test and 
its subtests is positive but slight. The significance of 
this relationship depends on which theory of intelligence 
is being considered. 

For Professor Speaxman all intellectual abilities 
could be expressed as functions of two factors, one a gene¬ 
ral or intellectual factor, common to every ability, and 
the other a specific factor, specific to any particular 

ability and "in every case different from that of all 
19 

others." If the subtests of the PfclA measure the general 
factor they should show a high or very high positive cor¬ 
relation with each other and with the total score. On the 
other hand, if they measure specific factors of intelli¬ 
gence there should be no significant correlation between 
them and the total score. 

However, this test and its subtests were designed to 
meet a different theory of intelligence. The authors be¬ 
lieve intelligence to be the composite of abilities for 
acquiring knowledge of various types; it is a molecular 
rather than a molar entity. Using a statistical method 
called "factor analysis" they found that intelligence is 
not unitary but that it is composed of several describable, 
measurable and relatively independent abilities. They have 
identified eight of these abilities and suggest that still

more may be identified with further study. 

21 

In her report on the SRA test Professor Goodenough 

presents no data on the self-correlation, intercorrelations, 

or agreement with other criteria. The authors of the test 

claim that the total score gives a measure of the child's 

general learning ability, since it includes the scores of 
22 

V, P, Q, and S. 

Had the coefficients of correlations between the test 
and its subtests been very high they would have cast doubt 
on the validity of the test. They would be evidence that 
the test does not measure unique primary mental abilities 
as defined by the test makers. High correlations are not 
expected nor desired between the total and the subscores. 
Therefore, from the standpoint of Thurstones* theory of 
many independent factors it may be said that the results 
stated in Table II are satisfactory and that in this res¬ 
pect the test is internally consistent. 

COEFFICIENTS OF CORRELATION BETWEEN 
THE SUBTESTS 

The five component parts of the test were correlated 
one with another. The product moment method was again used 
resulting in the coefficients of correlation shown in Table 
III. Each of these coefficients was tested against the null 
hypothesis and with the exception of the relationship between 
Motor and Verbal-Meaning the null hypothesis was rejected.

The r between these two subtests could have occurred by chance 
at the *01 level of significance. However, if we are willing 
to risk being in error five times in one hundred trials we 
may reject the null hypothesis in this instance also. With 
200 degrees of freedom and a CR value of 2.03 we read from 
table 2^ of Garrett that the relationship is significant at 
the .03 level, since any CR of 1.97 or greater indicates a 

































- 23 - 


significant coefficient of correlation. 

As a further check on this computation of the OR, 

Table 49 of Garrett was consulted. With 200 degrees of 
freedom any r of .l8l or greater is significant at the .01 
level. This value is less than any coefficient of correla¬ 
tion in Table III with the exception of the r between M and 
V. From Table 49 we find that an r of .138 is necessary 
for significance at the .03 level since this also is higher 
than the coefficient under discussion, therefore it would be 
safe to conclude that the relationship between M and V could 
have occurred through chance and accept the null hypothesis 
that no significant correlation between these two subtests 
has been revealed by this study. 

RELATED STUDIES 


The authors of the PMA test report correlations between 
the factors of the test in the 1948 revision of the Examiner's 
Manual. The test makers' findings together with those of this 
study are presented in Table IV. 

A unique phenomenon between the test makers' findings 
and those of the Edmonton study is that in every case the 
local coefficients of correlation are lower. The Thurstones 
do not report the size of their sample, but since they nor¬ 
mally deal with large numbers it may be assumed that their 
sample was sufficiently large to yield dependable results.

Columns headed "Edm." contain the findings of the Edmonton

There is no evidence that they used a correction for attenu¬ 
ation. 

The difference between the findings of the two studies 
is probably of little importance. However, what signifi¬ 
cance it has is positive in so far as it concerns the sRA 
test, for, if the true nature of intelligence is factorial 
as claimed by the test makers, then a high or even a marked 
r is not expected between the subtests. 

INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS 

Relationships among the five abilities are low to 
moderate, ranging from correlations of .13 to .60. This

means that the abilities measured are interdependent to some 
extent with the exception of M and V which seem to be rela¬ 
tively independent of each other. The test makers do not 
claim that the Primary Mental Abilities should not show 
significant intercorrelations. They suggest that they are 

not as clearly differentiated in young children as in older 

23 

children and adults. 

Primary traits are not indivisible. They are merely 

families in which many interrelated abilities may be found. 

Their diagnostic importance lies in the fact that the 

separate families are less highly correlated than are tests 

24 

within any one family. 

The statistical data in Table IV tends to strengthen 
rather than weaken the test makers* claims since the author’s 
findings showed lower correlations than did those of the 
test makers. 

SUMMARY 


The data presented in this chapter substantiates the 
Thurstones* claims for the 3RA test. Variations from their 
findings have all been positive. In terms of this thesis 
the test is internally consistent and from this standpoint 
it may be considered to be a satisfactory instrument for 
measuring the intelligence of first grade beginners.

CHAPTER VI 


MEAN PROFILE OF THE PRIMARY MENTAL ABILITIES 


As a further study on the internal consistency of the 
test under consideration a profile of the mean scores on the 
subtests and total score was drawn up* This was done by 
taking the mid-point of the range of each test as the fif¬ 
tieth percentile and comparing the obtained mean on each 
test with it* Table V presents the mean profile of the 
Edmonton data expressed as percentiles.

If all of the first grade beginners in the city of 
Mmonton were tested the mean of their scores would be the 
average of the scores obtained. An approximation to the 
same mean may be expected if a random sample from this 
group is tested for a trait that is normally distributed 
in the population. Assuming that the sample used in this 
study was randomly selected and knowing that intelligence 
is normally distributed we may expect to obtain approxi¬ 
mately the same mean from the sample as from the total 
group. To discover whether there is a significant dif¬ 
ference between the obtained and the expected means the 
critical ratio was calculated in each case using the for¬ 
mula OR = —In each case the OR obtained was checked 
oa 

using Table 29 of Garrett. 1 ^ This table is used to test 
the OR against the null hypothesis, i.e., against the 
assumption that there i s no true difference between the 
population means being compared, and that our two means 
differ only through sampling accident. Depending on the 
evidence we retain or refute the null hypothesis, since 
the degrees of freedom equal 200 we reject the null hypo¬ 
thesis at the .09 level if the OR equals or exceeds 1.97 
and at the .01 level if the OR equals or exceeds 2.60. 

For critical ratios less than these we accept the null 
hypothesis and regard the differences as not significant 
at the level concerned.^

INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS 

There was a significant difference between the obtained 
and the expected mean scores on the Space sub-test. The mean 
score made by the first grade beginners tested was signifi¬ 
cantly higher than expected from a normal population. If 
the assumption of randomness of sample is valid our findings 
cast doubt upon the validity of the Space sub-test. In 
general its items are not difficult enough for first grade 
beginners.

The items of the Quantitative sub-test tend to be too 
easy for first grade beginners also, for if we are willing 
to be wrong five times in one hundred trials the mean score 
of these pupils is on the verge of being too high on this 
subtest. However, unless a parallel study were to cast 
doubt on the validity of this subtest no conclusion to the 
detriment of the SRA test should be drawn from the findings 
of the present study because significance at the .05 level 
is not a severe enough test on which to base such a conclu¬ 


sion

CHAPTER VII 


CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
CONCLUSIONS 

The purpose of this study was to explore and evaluate 
the SRA Primary Mental Abilities Test as an instrument for 
measuring the intelligence of first grade beginners. A 
summary of results follows: 

1. The sRA test correlated .854 with the Detroit 
Beginning First-Grade Intelligence Test. The Detroit has 
been adopted as a satisfactory test of intelligence by the 
Edmonton school administrators; therefore, from any stand¬ 
point of validity, there should be no objection to the 
SRA test. 

2. When correlated with teacher judgment the sRA 
test yielded a coefficient of .64. This indicates marked 
relationship and further substantiates the validity of the 
test when one considers the limitations upon the objectivity 
of teachers’ judgment. 

5. The total score correlated .471 with V., .244 with 
P., .510 with Q., .401 with S., and .2?6 with M. These cor¬ 
relations are all significantly different from zero at the 
.01 level. Since, in each case, a positive correlation co¬ 
efficient is present but not marked, the authors* findings 
in similar studies were substantiated,^ and in so far as 
its relationship to its subtests is concerned the test 
makers* expectations were realized, since high r*s are not

- 33 - 


expected or desired, 

4. Except for the correlation between M and V all of 
the subtests showed coefficients of correlation that were 
significant at the ,01 level. Little has been accomplished 
by making these correlations, and the most that can be said 
for them is that they are not different from what the test 
makers would have expected. Similar r’s are reported by 
Gronbach in connection with the intermediate form of the 
SRA. test. 26 

5. A mean profile study showed that the obtained 
means of total score, V, P, and M, were not significantly 
different from the expected means of the total population 
at the .01 level. These findings indicate that the test 

is at a level of difficulty suited to first grade beginners. 

6. The mean of Q, was not found to be significantly 
different from the expected mean at the .01 level but was 
doubtful at the .0^ level. 

7. The obtained mean of S was significantly different 
from the expected mean at both the .01 level and .0j> level. 
This means that the items in the S subtest are, in general, 
not sufficiently difficult for first grade beginners. This 
is serious because it affects the total score by raising 
its mean. The test is not internally consistent in this 


area

WEAKNESS IN THE STUDY 

There is an element of weakness in this study owing 
to the fact that the criteria against which the SRA test 
was measured were not as impressive as might have been 
desired. If a good individual intelligence test had been 
administered to a considerable number of the testees, their 
scores would have provided a better "yard stick" than was 
available for this study through the administration of the 
Detroit Beginning iirst-Grade intelligence Test, similarly 
the teachers* evaluation of pupil achievement suffered be¬ 
cause of the fact that it tended to be less objective than 
could be desired. 


RECOMMENDATIONS 

This study has found the SRA test to be reasonably 
valid and with one exception it seems to be internally con¬ 
sistent. The test is particularly good in that it yields 
both an intelligence quotient and a profile from which 
certain student strengths and weaknesses may be discerned, 
its greater length probably adds to the accuracy of the 
total score that it gives. i?'or these reasons it should find 
a place in the school testing program. 

However, due to the length of the SRA test it presents 
administrative difficulties. Considerable time is required

- 35 - 


to score it and it is difficult for many teachers to inter¬ 
pret the profile that it yields. Cost is another unfavorable 
factor. Therefore it is unlikely that the SRA test will re¬ 
place the test now in use, which is shorter, cheaper, and 
easier to administer and score, and in the majority of cases, 
adequate to the administrators 1 needs. 

It is therefore suggested that the SRa test be used as 
a secondary test for first grade beginners. It could be used 
to check the results where the Detroit gives a very low or 
extremely high score.
