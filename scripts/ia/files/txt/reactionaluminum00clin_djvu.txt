THE REACTION ALUMINUM QiHDE-CARBON-<HTORiNl 

I. INTRODUCTION . 

The chlorination of aluminum oxide mixed with 
carbon is known to proceed with facility at a red heat 
to give the anhydrous chloride f while the action of 
either carbon or chlorine, singly, on the oxide is 
negligible below temperatures approaching 2000 °C. The 
mechanism of the chlorination of the mixture is repres¬ 
ented in most reference texts by the equation: 

6C1 2 -h 2A1 2 0 3 +3C-► 4A1C1 3 -|-3C0 2 » 

the carbon combining with the oxygen of the aluminum 
oxide while the halogen attacks the metal. This is the 
principle underlying the preparation of the anhydrous 
chlorides of a number of metals, the chloride of the 
metal in its highest valence being formed. In the 
chlorination of a mixture of tungstic oxide and carbon, 
there arises the possibility of formation of three 
chlorides, 'namely, the dioxy dichloride, WOgC^ t the 
monoxy tetrachloride, W0C1 4 , and the hexachloride, 

wci 6 r 

The present inTestigation was prompted by the 
work of George W. Sears and Fred Lohse ^ who studied 












2“ 


the reaction tungstic oxide- carbon- chlorine, analyzed 
the evolved furnace gases and found that definite 
quantities of oxygen, but no carbon dioxide, were 
produced in a slow stream of chlorine# This indicated 
the role of carbon in the chlorination reaction to be 
that of a catalyst. In a static atmosphere of chlorine, 
however, no oxygen, but carbon dioxide and carbon mon¬ 
oxide were found, due to the oxygen first formed burning 
the carbon to one or both oxides. 

The immediate investigation was to ascertain 
whether carbon was also a catalyst in the reaction 
aluminum oxide- carbon- chlorine. If carbon were a 
catalytic agent, then oxygen, not carbon dioxide, 
should be a product, and the reaction must be expressed 
thus: 

2A1 2 0 3 + 6C1 2 -^-> 4A1C1 3 -+ 30 2 . 

Since the reaction occurs at temperatures in 
the neighborhood of a red heat, it became evident that 
the hot carbon would be attacked by the free oxygen to 
form carbon dioxide, and perhaps even carbon monoxide. 

If a slow stream of chlorine were maintained, most of 
the oxygen evolved would have an opportunity to be 
swept out of proximity to the carbon, in which instance 






-3 


large amounts of oxygen and smaller amounts of carbon 
dioxide would leave the reaction chamber. In a static 
atmosphere of chlorine, on the other hand, the oxygen 
would have little opportunity of escaping from the 
hot carbon, and one would expect to obtain large 
proportions of carbon dioxide with perhaps small 
traces of oxygen. Since the carbon would be in excess, 
the formation of the monoxide during the early stages 
of the reaction presented a possibility, thus* 

C02-+ C -► 2CO . 

Furthermore, if the loss of carbon during the 
chlorination were less than the theoretical amount 
necessary to form carbon monoxide or carbon dioxide 
from that weight of aluminum oxide which had reacted, 
then this fact would constitute another argument in 
favor of the catalysis supposition. Some difficulty 
was anticipated in arriving at the correct loss in 
weight of each reactant after chlorination in view of 
the fact that both carbon and aluminum oxide are 
excellent adsorbers of chlorine and other gases, and 
this would tend to give erroneous values for the 
actual loss in weight of each of the reacting con¬ 
stituents of the mixture.

II. HISTORICAL . 

The mechanism of the chlorination reaction of 
aluminum oxide and carbon appears to have been explain¬ 
ed unsatisfactorily in the literature, and little 
seems to have been attempted in the direct analyses 
of the furnace gases produced. The general assumption 
that carbon acted as a reducing agent to form carbon 
monoxide or carbon dioxide was found to haYe little 

experimental evidence in support of it. 

( 2 ) 

H. C. Oersted investigated the chlorination 

and found the reaction to be exothermic. Oersted*s 

reaction was expressed by the equation: 

A1 2 0 3 H- 3CX 2 +3C-►3C0+2A1C1 3 + 30.2 Cal. 

The Chemical Society published an article in 

(3) 

their Memoirs and Proceedings on 'decomposition of 

alumina at a red heat by charcoal and chlorine". 

(4) 

W. D. Treadwell and L. Terebesi ' ' expressed 
the main reaction in the chlorination of aluminum 
oxide- carbon mixtures at 550- 980 0 by the equation: 

AlgOs+SC+Sdg *— > 2AXC13 + 3C0 , 

the concurrent reaction: 


Al 2 0 5 -h3C0+3Cl 2 ^= ...fr. 2AlCl 5 +3C0 2 

proceeding much more slowly. A mechanism was suggested, 












5' 


and the heat and free energy of the reaction was 
calculated. 

The action of chlorine alone on aluminum 
oxide was found to begin about 800 0 according to 

(5) 

V. Spitzuin , who claims that cooling does not 
reverse the reaction. He states that carbon has no 
effect on the temperature at which the reaction sets 
in, and that its accelerating effect is probably due 
to its reaction with the oxygen produced in the main 
reaction, thus preventing equilibrium from being 
established. 

A general method of preparing anhydrous 

chlorides of twenty metals, including aluminum, is 

( 6 ) 

cited by Ed. Chauvenet , who gives the temperature 
range between 450 - 650 °. This author claims a 
mixture of carbon and chlorine to be superior to 
carbonyl chloride, but mentions no gaseous products. 

( 7 ) 

According to Walther Kangro and Richard Kahn , 
aluminum oxide must be heated to 1200 0 before chlorine 
will act sufficiently to cause at least 1 % of the 
oxide to react per hour. 

The action of carbon on aluminum oxide was 
studied at temperatures around 1900 0 by W.D. Treadwell 







- 6 - 


and A. Gyger , indicating that at temperatures of 

1000 ° or below no action was possible. 

The action of chlorine on wood charcoal has 

been studied by several investigators. F. A. ftehglein 

(9) 

and Grzenkowski observed an apparent chemical 

reaction between chlorine and the adsorptive charcoal. 

They found that 70 % of its weight of chlorine was 

absorbed at 15° and 4 atmospheres. 

( 10 ) 

A* P. Okatov reported that, of the chlorine 

adsorbed by charcoal, 11 % is retained even after 
heating at 260 - 280 0 in a stream of air. The 
charcoal poisoned with chlorine loses some of its 
adsorptive capacity. 

At 400 - 600 0 activated carbon combines very 
slowly with chlorine to form carbon tetrachloride 
according to the findings of A. Stock, H. Lux and 
W. Wustrow .

III. SXPBRMm . 

1. Preparation of Materials. 

Carbon . 

Experiment showed that the common wood charcoal 
"Norite" was unsuitable for the purpose of this ihves- 
tigation due to the great amount of impurities in it. 
When a stream of dry chlorine from a cylinder of 
liquid chlorine was passed over "Norite" heated to 
640 0 , a white sublimate appeared in the cooler part 
of the transparent quartz tube, but no liquid products 
could be condensed in a U - tube chilled to — 20 0 
by ice- salt mixture. On cooling, the "Norite" was 
found to have gained in weight. Subsequent heating 
in chlorine for several hours yielded more sublimate 
of a white, yellow, then reddish hue, and soluble in 
water, the solution giving a test for both chloride 
and ferric ions. The "Norite" suffered a great loss 
in weight and, after prolonged treatment in chlorine, 
the residue contained only a greyish- white ash, but 
no carbon. 

The action of chlorine on graphite produced a 
small amount of white sublimate at 510 - 520 0 , 
followed by yellow, then reddish - brown deposits at 







-3 


570 0 . At 700 0 a yellow deposit again formed. 
Microscopic drops appeared in the cooler part of the 
tube. Loss in weight amounted to 3 

Gasblack on similar treatment for several 
hours gave a faint white sublimate at 600 - 620 0 , 
and at 715 0 a trace of yellow material appeared as 
well as colorless droplets, as in the case with graph¬ 
ite. There was a loss in weight of 60 $£. 

An oxidation on each sample of carbon was 
carried out, the per cent of ash to total weight of 
original carbon being 3.7 for "Norite", and 0.0 for 
gasblaek. An oxidation on graphite proved unsuccess¬ 
ful at a red heat. 

A sample of sugar carbon was then prepared by 
dehydrating 120 gm. of pure cane sugar dissolved in 
90 cc. of water, with 120 cc. of concentrated 
sulfuric acid. The bulky mass was cooled, boiled with 
water, filtered and washed ten times until the washings 
no longer gave a test for sulfate radical. The carbon 
was dried on a watch glass in the oven at 120 - 150 0 
for 17 hours. The product possessed an odor of 
caramel. 

A portion of this sugar carbon heated in a 


















o 







9 


current of dry air produced considerable moisture , 
then a white sublimate, followed by brownish droplets 
and some crystalline needle-like substance. Complete 
oxidation left a greyish -pink ash amounting to 
0.05 % of the original weight. Chlorination of 
another portion gave moisture at 100 0 , yellowish - 
brown drops at 350 0 and yellow needle - like 
crystals at 500 0 . Two hours* treatment at 640-660 0 
caused a loss of 55 % of original weight. 

An attempt to purify this sugar carbon by heat 
treatment in vacuo was undertaken. The entire sample 
was heated to 250 0 under a pressure of 2.5 mm. of 
mercury, each boatful being treated for one hour at 
that temperature. The carbon appeared to lose 
considerable volatile material and, Y/hen cool, 
retained the odor of caramel, and was characterized 
by a decidedly brownish color. 

An oxidation on this material gave 0.05 % by 
weight of ash, as well as volatile products. Chlor¬ 
ination at 250 - 300 0 produced a yellow sublimate 
and brown drops. Above 400 0 , colorless droplets 
appeared in the cooler part of the tube, and at 475° 
pale needle - like crystals made their appearance.

There was no further change at 630 0 . A four- hour 
treatment at 650 0 caused a loss in weight of 60 °/ 0 • 

It was evident that a form of carbon had not 
yet been prepared pure enough for the investigation. 

The common types of carbon contained iron and various 
adsorbed impurities; the sugar carbon possessed 
decomposition products ranging between partly dehydrat¬ 
ed sugar, or caramel, and pure carbon. The heat 
treatment in vacuo had not been sufficient to eliminate 
all of these reduction products. 

The preparation of a very pure form of carbon 
was finally accomplished in the following manners 
Pure cane sugar was dehydrated as previously outlined, 
using double the quantities specified, and the product 
boiled with additional concentrated sulfuric acid for 
two hours to remove as much caramel as possible. The 
mixture was then cooled, poured into water and the 
hot mixture filtered by suction. The carbon was 
quite black and fine, yet readily filterable. The 
material was transferred to a 4 - liter beaker, 
boiled with water for half an hour and refiltered by 
suction. This process was repeated 21 times until 
only the faintest test for sulfate ion with barium 

nitrate and hydrochloric acid solution could be noted 












■IX- 


after long standing. The carbon was now so fine as 
to require nearly 24 hours for each ^Iteration by 
suction. The black mass was transferred to watch 
glasses and dried for 48 hours in an oven at 125 0 • 
The dried material weighed 71 gnu 

The carbon was now ground finely in an agate 
mortar and treated at high temperature in a current 
of nitrogen. Each boatful, containing 3*5 gm., was 
raised to 750 - 760 0 and a slow stream of nitrogen 
passed over at that temperature for 1-1/2 hours. Much 
vapor and brownish material appeared in the cooler 
portion of the tube. The boat was then allowed to cool 
to room temperature in nitrogen, and the contents 
quickly transferred to a glass- stoppered bottle. 
Cylinder nitrogen was employed, but was previously 
passed through a series of three wash bottles contain¬ 
ing potassium pyrogallate solution to remove any traces 
of oxygen. 

It was found that the above treatment caused a 
loss of 53 % by weight. A second similar treatment 
for 1- 1/2 hours gave a negligible loss of 0.09 %. 

An oxidation carried out on a portion of this newly 
treated carbon gave no visible products, but an ash of 





-12- 


0.084 % by weight of the new carbon* or 0.04 % of the 
original untreated carbon. Treatment with chlorine 
gave a faint trace of moisture at 120° , but no visible 
products up to 860 0 . The carbon appeared unchanged 
during the heating. This carbon was used exclusively 
in the chlorination of the aluminum oxide- carbon 
mixtures. 

Aluminum Oxide . 

The selection of a very pure form of aluminum 
oxide from various stock bottles was not found possible, 
since these gave analyses containing small amounts of 
iron and other metals as well as undesirable radicals. 
The oxide was therefore prepared from a pure sample of 
AlClj.6H2O of low iron content. A boiling solution of 
this salt was treated with excess of C. P. concentrated 
ammonium hydroxide, boiled and the precipitate washed 
by decantation, then boiled again and the process 
repeated over a dozen times until teste showed the 
chloride ion to be practically absent. The aluminum 
hydroxide was of a very fine texture and settled fairly 
rapidly. The white material was then dried on watch 
glasses in an oven at 150° for 36 hours. The dry 






-13- 


product was ground finely in an agate mortar and 
heated by portions in a crucible at bright red heat 
for over 1/2 hour. After cooling in a desiccator* 
the aluminum oxide was quickly transferred to a 
glass - stoppered bottle. Chlorine treatment of this 
aluminum oxide gave a faint trace of moisture at 
150 - 175 0 9 but no further indication of visible 
products up to 850 0 . On cooling* the oxide was 
found to have suffered a loss of less than 0.5 

A very intimate mixture of carbon and aluminum 
oxide was also made by precipitating the aluminum 
hydroxide with the carbon. Two ratios were used» one 
containing a small amount of carbon, the other a large 
amount of the element. To two boiling solutions, each 
containing 75 gm. of C. P. AifNOs)g.OHgO , the finely 
ground carbon was added, 0.89 gm. and 3.8 gm. 
respectively. The mixtures were stirred vigorously 
while G. P. concentrated ammonium hydroxide was added 
in excess to each, and the mixtures filtered. Each 
precipitate was washed 8 or more times with successive 
portions of hot water until the washings were practic¬ 
ally free from nitrate radical. The precipitates were 
then dried on watch glasses in an oven at 150° for 




-14. 


20 hours. The dried residues were each in turn finely 
ground in an agate mortar, heated in an atmosphere of 
pure nitrogen at 850 0 for one hour, then cooled in 
the inert gas and placed in glass- stoppered bottles. 
During treatment no sublimate formed, only a trace of 
moisture. Each mixture was calculated to yield 
10.4 gm. of aluminum oxide, hence giving values Of 
11*5 and 2*7, respectively for the ratio of aluminum 
oxide to carbon. 

Confining Solution . 

A suitable liquid for confining samples of the 
gaseous products of reaction was necessary, and one 
which would have little or no absorption tendency 
towards carbon dioxide, oxygen, carbon monoxide or 
chlorine. ,, Nujol ,i was employed at first, and while 
it was unattacked by the three common gases mentioned, 
it was rapidly attacked by the chlorine with formation 
of substitution products and hydrogen chloride. The 
oil became colored green, considerable foaming result¬ 
ed, and the yellowish- green color of the halogen was 
quickly replaced by the colorless hydrogen chloride. 
Moreover, the viscosity of the oil was so high as to 














n 


















15 


inhibit easy flow while a sample of the gases was 
collected by displacement of the liquid. 

A fluid which proved adaptable for the purpose 
was 20 % sodium sulfate solution with 5 % sulfuric 
acid. A number of gases have a negligible solubility 
in this solution; chlorine appeared to exert no action 
upon it, as indicated by no change in this gas con¬ 
fined over this liquid for several days. Moreover, 
samples of mixtures of carbon dioxide, oxygen, carbon 
monoxide and chlorine gave the same analyses when 
analyzed immediately after confinement as when they 
had been confined for intervals of several hours. 

Extraction Agent for Chlorine . 

In order to analyze for the gases carbon diox¬ 
ide, oxygen and carbon monoxide, it became necessary 
to devise a method for separating them from the great 
excess of chlorine present. Most reagents which 
dissolve chlorine without the formation of gaseous 
products, also absorb carbon dioxide and oxygen to a 
certain extent. Aniline absorbed the halogen readily 
with no objectionable products to clog the absorption 
pipette. A variety of reactions involving substitution

and neutralization occur, the following equations 
expressing one possibility: 

UH 2 BHC1 

Q + cx 2 -► ^ +HC1 . 

mOl KHo 

o —*0 

G1 

m 2 bh 3 ci 

0 + Hci —*0 

The objection to aniline was its dissolving power on 
carbon dioxide. 

Ferrous ammonium sulfate as a 10 % solution in 
6 normal sulfuric acid, absorbed chlorine readily, but 
also extended its solvent action to carbon dioxide. 

The absorption of the halogen is represented by the 
following equation: 

2F@S0 4 ( 304 ) 2304 + 0 X 2+112304 -►Fe 2 (S0 4 ) 3+2(BH 4 ) 2 S0 4 

+ 2HC1 

The absorption of carbon dioxide is apparently of a 
purely solvent nature. Ferrous sulfate itself behaved 
likewise. When the solution of the double salt was 









-17- 


heated to 60° , the absorption of chlorine was more 
rapid, and the volume of carbon dioxide absorbed 
decreased by one- half. 

Potassium iodide offered possibilities of 
chlorine absorption, the action being expressed as 
follows: 

ZKX +* Cl 2 - > 2KC1 -j-I 2 

KI-fl 2 -^KI 3 

Unfortunately oxygen and carbon dioxide were absorbed 

by this solution, iodine being liberated. 

Mercury 'was apparently the only liquid to absorb 

only the chlorine, it being also used by Sears and 

( 1 ) 

Lohse in their work on tungstic oxide. Possessing 
no property of dissolving carbon dioxide, oxygen or 
carbon monoxide, it had a rapid affinity for chlorine, 
especially when a fresh surface of the metal was 
exposed. The reaction was accompanied by the formation 
of heat: 

2ffg + Cl 2 -*Hg 2 Cl 2 

The product, calomel, was only partially soluble 
in mercury, and it was objectionable in its property 
of clogging the capillary tubes of the pipette. The 








-18- 


unused metal was separated from the calomel by washing 
with water and employing a separatory funnel, the 
separated mercury then being filtered through several 
layers of clean cheese cloth. The metal was suffic¬ 
iently clean to be re-utilized. 

Chlorine . 

Recalling the preliminary treatment of the 
various carbons by chlorine, the question arose as to 
the reason for the complete disappearance of the carbon 
on prolonged heating in the gas. Even though the 
samples contained large proportions of adsorbed material 
and pyroligneous matter, it was not feasible for all of 
the carbon to disappear unless chlorine itself possess¬ 
ed some property of action on hot carbon. Attempts to 
condense out carbon tetrachloride in a IT - tube packed 
in salt- ice mixture failed. 

Since the chlorine from the cylinder of the 
liquid was suspected to be of electrolytic origin, 
an analysis on a 950 cc. sample was carried out, using 
mercury to extract the halogen. A residual gas amount¬ 
ing to nearly 200 cc. remained, and an analysis on 
this showed the presence of definite quantities of 











, V ' r 











-19 


carbon dioxide and oxygen, a trace of carbon monoxide 
and a large proportion of inert constituent (nitrogen). 
SeYeral determinations supported the same results, and 
the ratio of oxygen to nitrogen bore a similarity to 
that maintained in the atmosphere, that is, about 
21 % oxygen. The following table indicates the 
composition by Yolurae of the tank chlorine:

In the electrolysis of brine for the production 

of chlorine, the anode is a carbon rod. At this 

( 12 ) 

electrode, according to Treadwell and Hall , the 
liberation of chlorine is accompanied by a small 
amount of oxygen which attacks the carbon, forming 
carbon monoxide. The greater part of this unites with 
chlorine to form carbonyl chloride which is hydrolyzed 
by water into carbon dioxide and hydrogen chloride: 
C0C1 2 + H 2 0-►2HC1 + C0 2 




















20- 


This accounts for the presence of carbon dioxide and 
carbon monoxide as impurities in the chlorine* ¥he 
oxygen and nitrogen probably came from contamination 
by the atmosphere* 

Thus the oxygen in the chlorine accounted for 
the gradual disappearance of the carbon at a red heat 
due to the formation of carbon dioxide or carbon mon¬ 
oxide. It now became necessary to generate pure 
chlorine. Potassium permanganate ( C. P.) and C.P. 
concentrated hydrochloric acid were used, the reaction 

with potassium permanganate in excess being, according 

(13) 

to F. P. Venable and D. H« Jackson : 

2KMn0 4 +8HGl- > 2KC1 -+- 2Mn0 2 +4H 2 G -f-3Cl 2 . 

With excess of hydrochloric acid and application of 
heat the second stage follows according to: 

mo z -f 4HC1-Kncig + 2H 2 0 + Cl 2 

The cylinder nitrogen used in sweeping out air 
from the system was also analyzed and found to contain 
0.44 % oxygen and a faint trace of carbon dioxide. It 
was therefore deemed adirisable to bubble the nitrogen 
through a series of three wash bottles containing 
alkaline pyrogallate solution prior to usage.

Regarding the possible existence of carbonyl 

chloride, it was wondered whether this substance» if 

formed in a mixture containing both carbon monoxide 

and chlorine, would hydrolyze in contact with the 

sodium sulfate solution to yield both carbon dioxide 

and hydrogen chloride. Mixtures of known proportions 

of carbon dioxide, oxygen* carbon monoxide and excess 

chlorine were confined over this solution, treated with 

mercury and analyzed. The per cent of carbon monoxide 

remained constant, with no increase in carbon dioxide 

content. Since no sample at any time was exposed to 

direct sunlight, it is more than likely that no 

carbonyl chloride was formed. According to R. H* 

(14) 

Atkinson, C. T. Heycock and W. J, Pope , the 

mercury would decompose any carbonyl chloride in 
accordance with the equation; 

2Hg + C0CX 2 


>Hg 2 Cl 2 + GO

2* Apparatus. 

The principle equipment consisted of an electric 
furnace with three resistance heating units, a quartz 
tube and thermocouple, a gas analysis apparatus, 
chlorine generator and gas sampling apparatus. The 
entire assembly is diagrammatic ally represented in the 
accompanying figure, page 23. 

The quartz tube (D) was of transparent 
vitreoeil to enable clear Tision of the reaction mixt¬ 
ure and the products formed along the tube. A ehromel- 
alumel thermocouple encased in quartz tubes projected 
through a rubber stopper into the furnace tube. The 
voltage was read from a Leeds and ITorthrup potentiometer 
indicator and converted into temperature readings by 
means of standard conversion tables. 

The chlorine generator (a) consisted of a 
2 - liter Florence flask fitted with a 3 - holed 
rubber stopper carrying a separatory funnel with 
capillary stem, the outlet tube, and a third fine tube 
reaching nearly to the bottom of the flask to allow 
for flushing the entire generator with nitrogen after 
charging with G. P. potassium permanganate and hydro¬ 
chloric acid. The outlet tube was connected by rubber

tuning to a wash bottle containing concentrated 

potassium permanganate solution to absorb any vapors 

of hydrogen chloride which, according to F. P. Venable 

(13) 

and D, H. Jackson , react with potassium perman¬ 

ganate at dilutions as low as 0*002 normal with 
respect to acid* Following this, there was a wash 
bottle of concentrated sulfuric acid to dry the gas, 
as well as an additional tower packed with granulated 
anhydrous calcium chloride for the same purpose. The 
series of two wash bottles and one tower is depicted 
as B in the diagram* From here the connection to 
the furnace tube was made by means of two T - tubes 
(C) equipped with rubber tubing in such a manner that 
the flow of chlorine could be directed into the quartz 
tube or through a side exit tube to the window, and at 
the same time the furnace tube could be flushed with 
nitrogen without altering any of the connections. 

From the exit of the furnace tube was connected 
a U - tube to receive any products of reaction, and 
this in turn to a system of tubes (S) in such a 
manner that a sample of the gases could be extracted 
or allowed to pass on out the window, without danger 
of air entering into the system. The small wash

bottle (l) acted in the capacity of a trap for any 
confining solution should it flood the main passage 

tube. 

The sample was collected in a liter aspirator 
bottle by displacing the sodium sulfate solution into 
a second similar bottle, the two being connected by 
means of a length of rubber tubing. The level of the 
second container was brought below that of the first 
in order to create a suction effect when collecting a 
sample. Two such pairs of vessels were employed (5*). 

The mercury pipette used in the absorption of 
chlorine from the furnace gases is illustrated in G, 
one end of the main body being sealed to one stem of 
a 5 - way capillary stop-cock, the other end connected 
to a levelling bulb filled with clean mercury. One stem 
of the stop-cock was connected with the sampling bottle 
containing the gases. The side tube off the main body 
of the pipette connected with a sampling tube contain¬ 
ing the sodium sulfate solution (H) . 

At the commencement of each absorption the 
pipette was completely filled with mercury up to the 
stop-cock, while the sampling tube was filled with 
sodium sulfate solution up to the side arm of the

pipette. Thus the apparatus was free from air. After 
flushing the stop-cock with the sample, the latter was 
allowed to enter the pipette by turning the stop-cock. 
The levelling bottle of the confining solution was 
kept considerably higher than the bottle containing 
the sample in order to force the gas into the pipette. 
The mercury in the levelling bulb was brought to a 
lower level than that in the pipette in order to create 
a suction effect on the sample. When the pipette was 
nearly filled with gas, the stop-cock was turned and 
the pipette shaken thoroughly until all the chlorine 
was absorbed as witnessed by the rise of mercury in 
the tube. A new portion of sample was then admitted 
and the procedure repeated a number of times until all 
of the sample had been thus treated. After the chlorine 
had been completely removed, the residual gas was 
transferred into the sampling tube to be analyzed. 

The apparatus for analyzing gases was patterned 
after the Crsat apparatus, equipped with a Pettersson 
pressure compensator. The carbon dioxide pipette 
contained 40 % potassium hydroxide solution. Standard 
potassium pyrogallate solution was utilized for oxygen 
absorption, while for carbon monoxide two absorption

pipettes were employed, one containing acid cuprous 
chloride solution, the other cuprous sulfate- beta 
n&phthol mixture* 

The reason for using two pipettes for carbon 
monoxide absorption is due to the fact that, after 
having absorbed a certain amount of the gas, cuprous 
chloride giYes up carbon monoxide t© gases containing 
little or none of this component immediately after it 
has absorbed carbon monoxide from a previous sample 
containing much of this gas* The unstable compound 
formed with cuprous chloride is dependent upon partial 
pressures: 

CU 2 CI 2 + 2 GO< ^CU2Cl2»2CO • 

Passing the gas a second time through the 
cuprous sulfate pipette ensures complete quantitative 
removal of the last traces of carbon monoxide by reason 
of the formation of a stable compound: 

CU 2 SO 4 + 2 CO-► CU 2 SC> 4 * 2 CO 

The absorption in cuprous sulfate is a little slower 
than in cuprous chloride. 

For flushing the manifold from time to time, a 
3 % solution of hydrochloric acid containing methyl 
orange was employed.

These solutions were made up according to 
directions in "Methods of the Chemists of the 
United States Steel Corporation for the Sampling and 
Analysis of Gases", pp 36-40, third edition (192*7) » 


3. Procedure, 

In conducting a chlorination run, definite 
quantities of both aluminum oxide and carbon were 
weighed out in the weighed boat and intimately mixed 
in the boat by means of a platinum wire, care being 
exercised to a^oid any loss of material. The boat 
with contents was then inserted into the quarts tube 
so as to lie in the middle of the largest heating unit 
of the furnace, and immediately next to the hot junction 
of the thermocouple. The assembly was as indicated 
in the diagram, page 23, all connections being of 
rubber. The entire system including generator was 
flushed with nitrogen to eliminate all traces of air, 
especially oxygen. This operation usually consumed 
one hour, after which practically no oxygen remained 
in the system. The nitrogen intake on the generator

was closed and acid allowed to drop onto the potassium 
permanganate to generate a steady stream of chlorine. 
After chlorine had passed through the system for some 
time, a sample of the gases was withdrawn and absorbed 
in the mercury pipette, the residue then being analyzed 
for carbon dioxide and oxygen. The carbon dioxide 
content was always low, but the amount of oxygen 
varied, depending upon how completely it had been 
removed from the system. Experiment indicated that 
after the chlorine had been passing through at moderalB 
speed for an hour, the blank sample contained very 
little residue, amounting to 1 or 2 cc., of which 
the oxygen content ranged from 0 to 0.6 cc. The 
system was now ready for a run. It was necessary to 
take these preliminary precautions in the nature of a 
blank at room temperature ( 20 - 25 0 ) prior to each 
chlorination in order to ensure the complete removal 
of oxygen or air. 

The furnace was heated up, the mixture viewed 
at intervals and the formation of any sublimate in the 
cooler part of the tube noted along with the tempera¬ 
ture at which the change occurred. Samples ( always 
1000 cc.) were withdrawn from the gases of the furnace

during the progress of the reaction, the time necessary 
for collection and temperature range being recorded. 

The samples were then treated with mercury to remove 
chlorine and any residue analyzed as usual for carbon 
dioxide, oxygen and carbon monoxide. Often a second 
and even a third sample was withdrawn during the same 
chlorination run, at a different temperature, the time 
of collection being varied. A measure of the rate of 
flow of chlorine was arrived at by the fact that a 
1000 ce, sample was collected in 4 minutes when the 
halogen was bubbling through the sulfuric acid drying 
bottle at the rate of 3 bubbles per second through a 
one - inch column of acid. 

After the reaction had proceeded as far as desired, 
the flow of chlorine was diverted through the side arm 
of the first T - tube (c) while a stream of nitrogen 
was allowed to enter the reaction tube and flush the 
remainder of the system free from chlorine, the furnace 
meanwhile cooling. When cool, the boat with residue 
was removed and weighed. The contents were then sub¬ 
jected to an oxidation in pure oxygen at a red heat in 
order to burn away any unused carbon, after which the 
boat was again cooled in a stream of nitrogen and 






-31 


weighed. Prom this latter weight was calculated the 
amount of carbon used as well as that of aluminum oxide 
which had reacted. When a large alundum boat was 
employed, it was necessary to weigh it both before and 
after a determination, due to a decrease in weight with 
each chlorination and oxidation. 

For each chlorination run a fresh portion of 
reactants was weighed out and mixed as before. Various 
ratios were used. In a number of instances the ratio 
of the weights of aluminum oxide to carbon had a value 
of from 12 to 15, the amount of carbon being insuffic¬ 
ient to form carbon dioxide from the weight of oxide 
used, according to the equation: 

2A1 2 0 3 + 6C1 2 + 3C-V4A1C1 3 + 3C0 2 

In other eases, an excess of carbon above that necessaiy 
to fulfil the above equation was used, and the ratio of 
aluminum oxide to carbon by weight assumed values of from 

2 to 4. 

The time for collection of samples ranged from 

3 to 9 minutes, with one sample taking 18 minutes, the 
average time being around 5 or 6 minutes. Temperatures 
at which samples were withdrawn ranged from 644 0 to 
880 Temperatures of first appearance of a sublimate

of aluminum chloride covered a range between 611 0 
and 710 °, the average being 650 0 for mixtures of 
high carbon content, and 690 0 for those containing 
only small ratios of carbon. Weights of total mixture 
used ranged from 0.1360 gm. up to 1.0407 gm., with 
an average of 0.5 to 0.7 gm. 

Besides chlorination in a flow of chlorine, runs 
were also carried out in a static atmosphere, The 
blank determination was repeated as in all previous runs, 
and the furnace heated up. At a temperature somewhat 
below that of first visible reaction, the flow of 
chlorine, at the rate of a bubble per 5 seconds, was 
stopped by turning the stop-cock immediately beyond 
the sampling outlet and above the trap (l). The system 
was thus closed. The reaction began soon after, and 
the temperature was raised to the desired point and 
maintained constant for 20 minutes. A small pressure 
built up in the reaction tube, but this was necessary, 
since from the equations: 

2A1 2 ° 3 -I- 6C1 2 -^-►4AlCl 3 + 30 2 

or 2Al- 2 0 3 6C1 2 + 3C-*4A1C1 3 + 3G0 2 , 

it is evident that the reaction causes diminution in 
pressure, and this would be counterbalanced by the

— - t*J ■ 'J

excess pressure accumulated from the chlorine supply. 

It was also more desirable to have excess internal 
pressure so that there would be an escape of gas Should 
any leaks be present in the system, while a reduced 
internal pressure would draw in air from without and 
thereby ruin the validity of the results. 

After the 20 minutes heating, the furnace was 
allowed to cool to a temperature of 200 0 to 300 0 at 
which no further reaction could possibly occur, then 
the generation of chlorine was accelerated and the 
gases from the furnace tube admitted into the sampling 
bottle. The fresh supply of chlorine thus flushed out 
the reaction products which were treated and analyzed 
in the usual manner. 

Static runs were made on mixtures containing 
both high and low carbon content. 

A number of runs were also undertaken on each of 
the two mixtures in which the aluminum oxide and carbon 
had been very intimately mixed during preparation. Both 
static and flow methods were employed and samples of the 
gaseous products analyzed as outlined. 

The sublimate formed in every run was white 
aluminum chloride, and on various occasions, tests 








-34 


were made on these deposits to give positive evidence 
of both aluminum and chloride ions. In a number of 
instances the sublimate was discolored by yellow or 
brownish films when the large aiundum boat was employ¬ 
ed, and the reason was due to yellowish- brown ferric 
chloride being formed from the iron in the boat. The 
latter also suffered loss in weight due to the aluminum 
oxide in its composition reacting with chlorine at the 
interface of the carbon in the mixture. The loss in 
weight was very marked at first, amounting to several 
milligrams, but it reduced to a few tenths of a milli¬ 
gram after a number of runs had been made with the 
boat. 

Altogether, 45 chlorination runs were completed, 
including 3 blanks on aluminum oxide, and one on carbon 
alone. Out of these many determinations, a few com¬ 
prised one sample each outside of the blank at 20 °, 
a number consisted of samples in duplicate, while some 
included samples in triplicate, yielding a total of 
78 samples. Out of the more than 45 additional blanks 
analyzed, several were repeated upon finding that not 
all the air had been thoroughly eliminated from the 
system.

Four runs were also attempted on mixtures of 

tungstic oxide and carbon as a check on the work of 

( 1 ) 

Sears and Lohse and as a comparison with results 
found in the present investigation with aluminum oxide* 
The tungstic oxide used was of C* P* grade, two runs

IV. DATA AND RESULTS . 

The chlorination determinations are tabulated 
in the following pages. The weights of aluminum oxide 
and of carbon which had reacted were found indirectly 

from the weighings recorded, as in the example cited 
below for run # 17, and the amount of carbon theoret¬ 
ically required to produce carbon dioxide from the 
chlorination of the amount of aluminum oxide used was 
calculated and compared with that amount of carbon 
apparently used.

In many instances the carbon used was apparent¬

formation of carbon dioxide from that weight of oxide 
reacted; in others the amount of carbon used appeared 
to exceed that originally present in the mixture, 
while a few instances indicated that less carbon had 
been used than required for formation of carbon diox¬ 
ide as outlined. In consideration of the fact that 
both carbon and aluminum oxide are excellent adsorbing 
agents for chlorine, and that carbon in particular 

possesses the property of retaining some chlorine even 

„ (9) (10) 

after heat treatment In nitrogen or air , and 

which phenomenon may even be exhibited by the oxide, 

it indicated the futility of interpreting such values 

as to Y/hether the carbon was a true catalyst or simply 

a reducing agent.

chlorine; table III gives the runs in static atmosphere.

V. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS . 

The blank runs on the aluminum oxide and on the 
carbon confirmed the purity of each reactant, as little 
or no gas was evolved from either by the action of 
heat as high as 860 °. 

Considering the runs in which a slow stream of 
chlorine was used, the temperature at which the first 
sublimate was noted decreased, in general, with in¬ 
creased carbon content, that is, with decreased value 
of the ratio aluminum oxide to carbon. The volume of 
residual gases, products of the reaction, was small 
for mixtures of low carbon content, but consisted of 
as much oxygen as carbon dioxide, and often more, 
indicating that oxygen was being evolved through 
catalytic influence. The mixtures of high carbon 
content yielded large residues of gas containing 
larger proportions of carbon dioxide and only small 
yet appreciable amounts of oxygen. The reason for 
this was due to the fact that the oxygen produced was 
partially converted by the hot carbon into carbon 
dioxide, and the more carbon present, the less oxygen 
was likely to escape from uniting with the carbon. 

At higher temperatures more carbon dioxide and less

\jV.'

oxygen, was obtained, since the carbon was more active 
in combining with oxygen at the higher temperatures. 

Using the two intimately prepared mixtures» 
residues containing fair amounts of carbon dioxide 
and smaller amounts of oxygen were obtained with small 
carbon content. The hot carbon, being more evenly 
distributed throughout the mixture, was able to unite 
with more of the oxygen to furnish more carbon dioxide. 
The mixture containing large amounts of carbon convert¬ 
ed more of the oxygen into carbon dioxide as indicated 
by the larger residues consisting of higher proportions 
of carbon dioxide. 

The factor of time entered into the reactions. 
Samples withdrawn while the halogen was passing through 
the system at the rate of 1000 cc. in 3 or 4 minutes 
often gave smaller residues than those samples collect¬ 
ed in 6 or 8 minutes. The faster the passage of 
chlorine over the mixture, the less time was allowed 
for the reaction to furnish gaseous products, and 
hence the greater percentage of chlorine in each 
sample resulted* However, the oxygen formed was 
removed before much was converted into carbon dioxide. 
When 6 to 8 minutes were allowed, more of the 1000 cc.

of chlorine had time to react, giving more oxygen 
which in turn had greater opportunity to attack the 
hot carbon due to prolonged contact, hence the greater 
proportion of carbon dioxide* 

Time and temperature variations altered the 
proportions of carbon dioxide and oxygen obtained, 
though the results showed that optimum residues of 
oxygen were secured at temperatures neighboring 700 0 
and at withdrawals consuming 5 minutes. The greatest 
yield of sublimate was noted to be also at about this 
temperature, or somewhat lower for high carbon ratios* 
The reactions in a static atmosphere of chlorine 
were all carried out at some constant temperature for 
a standard time interval of 20 minutes. The table (ill) 
indicates that for mixtures of low carbon content, a 
little oxygen was present along with large amounts of 
carbon dioxide, while with the high carbon-ratio 
mixtures the carbon dioxide assumed very large propor¬ 
tions. This was to be expected since, under static 
conditions, the oxygen had little opportunity of being 
removed from the vicinity of the hot carbon, except by 
convection and diffusion. The intimately prepared 
mixtures behaved in a similar manner, except to provide 





n 




«■> 



-46- 


still larger residues and more carbon dioxide. 

The presence of carbon monoxide among the 
reaction products was absent in every instance for 
the runs in a flow of chlorine. Only in static 
atmosphere, runs 38, 39 and 40, was there any sus¬ 
picion of carbon monoxide produced, but additional 
runs 41 to 45 under the same conditions dispersed all 
doubt as to the presence of carbon monoxide. Further¬ 
more, carbon monoxide would not be ejected under such 
conditions when free oxygen was present with the carbon 
dioxide. 

The total absence of carbon monoxide at any 
time and under any conditions of temperature, carbon 
ratio, and time of collection, was in direct contra¬ 
diction with the assumptions of previous workers. The 
presence of oxygen in most cases, and in quantities 
greater than in the blank, was definite evidence that 
this gas was formed during the reaction and that it 
came, of necessity, from the aluminum oxide during the 
chlorination. This strongly suggested catalytic 
activity on the part of the carbon. The presence of 
carbon dioxide at all times was expected when oxygen 
was in such immediate contact with hot carbon, 
©specially when the duration of contact was prolonged 















- 47 - 


and the temperature raised, the carbon content 
greater, or the element more finely distributed as 
in the prepared mixtures. 

Thus the reaction should be properly expressed: 

2A1 2 0 3 -I- 6C1 2 - ——» 4A1C3-3 + 30 2 , 

(C) 

in which case a secondary reaction also occurs: 

C + 0 -► GO 2 <* 

This is in direct agreement with the properties 
of a catalyst, A reaction proceeds with greater ease 
and at lower temperatures when catalyzed.' The chlor¬ 
ination of aluminum oxide, while slow and only at 
temperatures above a white heat, occurred readily with 
the introduction of carbon, and at a temperature of 
700 0 or less in static atmosphere, and at as low as 
630 0 to 650 0 in a slow stream of chlorine. Moreover, 
the speed of reaction increased and temperature of 
reaction decreased with the addition of more carbon, 
again offering strong evidence of catalytic action. 

The most powerful argument in favor of the catalytic 
action of carbon was the positive evidence of definite 
quantities of free oxygen which could have come only 
from the aluminum oxide during reaction. 

One other means of proving catalytic activity

lay in showing that the amount of carbon utilized 
during reaction was insufficient to form carbon dioxide 
from the weight of aluminum oxide which had reacted. 

The futility of interpreting the results from this 
method of approach was explained under the section on 
"Data and Results". 

The results of the 4 runs on tungstic oxide and 

carbon in a moving stream of chlorine indicated the 

existence of free oxygen as a product of reaction, but 

carbon dioxide was also obtained in the residual gases, 

(1) 

contrary to the results published by Sears and Lohse 
These investigators obtained oxygen, but no carbon 
dioxide, in the chlorination of the above mixture, 
when a slow stream of chlorine was used. Since the 
production of carbon dioxide was at first thought to 
be due to the action of the oxygen on the purified 
sugar carbon which was highly activated, two runs were 
also conducted using "Norite", a common form of wood 
charcoal similar to that used by Sears and Lohse 
This modification produced little difference, except 
perhaps to increase the yield of carbon dioxide and 
decrease that of oxygen. Thus the work of Sears and

Lohse could not be duplicated. In the chlorination 
of tungstic oxide - carbon mixtures, less oxygen was 
obtained than in the chlorination of the mixtures of 
aluminum oxide and carbon. 

While carbon appeared to act as a catalyst 
in the chlorination of tungstic oxide, there can 
be no doubt as to the catalytic effect of carbon 
on the chlorination of aluminum oxide.

VI. SUMMARY. 

1. The reaction Aluminum Oxide - Carbon - 
Chlorine has been investigated and from the results 
it has been shown that aluminum chloride and free 
oxygen are formed in accordance with the equation: 

2AI 2 0 3 + 6C1 2 -fljy-► 4AIC1 3 30 2 . 

2. The oxygen formed attacks the hot carbon 
and is partially transformed into carbon dioxide. 

3. The proportion of oxygen converted into 
carbon dioxide increases with increase in temperature, 
decrease in rate of flow and rise in content of carbon 
in mixture. 

4* Positively no carbon monoxide is formed in 
the reaction. 

5# The optimum conditions for the reaction are 
high carbon content of mixture, a temperature under 
700 0 and a rate of flow of 200 cc. of chlorine per 
minute for slightly less than a gram of reactants. 

6. The presence and amount of oxygen and carbon 
dioxide among the reaction products was determined by 
removal of the chlorine by absorption with mercury and 
the residue subjected to standard gas analysis.
