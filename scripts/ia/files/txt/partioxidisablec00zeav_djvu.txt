" THE OXIDXSABLE CONSTITUENTS OF COAL” 

GENERAL INTRODUCTION 

Sine© ih© beginning of the last century much experi¬ 
mental work has been carried out on the conetitution of coal, 
attacking the problem by various means, such as dry distilla¬ 
tion, microscopic examination, carbonization, action of sol¬ 
vents etc# and yet, at present very little advance has been 
made with regard to its constitution, this is well illustrated 
by quoting S. W. Parrf ’’Noteworthy however, is the fact that 
highly trained specialists have entered the fuel field and are 
devoting their energies to a solution of the riddles there 
embedded, and so by the various methods of attack we are just 
beginning to understand some of the first letters of the al¬ 
phabet pertaining to the constitution of coal.” As a result, 
the oxidisable constituents of coal have been found out. 

The presence of the so-called ulmic compounds in coal 
have long been known and much experimental work has been car-

ried out on them. They have been found to possess certain 
characteristic physical and chemical properties such as their 
solubility in alkalis, coloring the solution with various 
shades of brown, and their liability to be readily oxidised. 
The above facts have led to many attempts to classify coal 
according to the intensity in color produced by the solution 
of their ulrains in alkalis. Recently, G. Charpy and G, De¬ 
corps* attempted to est5.mate the oxidisability of the ulmins 
quantitatively but their method was very slow and unsatis¬ 
factory. It was attempted in the laboratories of the Scien¬ 
tific and Industrial Research Coimcil of Alberta, to obtain 
much quicker and more exact quantitative methods by means of 
which measurement of the oxidisability of different coals 
could be made. 

In the first chapter of this thesis the writer deals 
with the details of this method as well as the results ob¬ 
tained, It has proven to be a very sensitive method by means 
of which certain ’’characteristics’* of coal could be detected. 

Many authorities ascribe the spontaneous combustion 
or weathering of coal to be chiefly due to the readily oxi- 
disable ulmins. As a test for the liability of a coal to 
undergo spontaneous combustion, Fischer** proposes that a 
gramme of finely divided coal be shaken up with 20 c.cs. 
of a half normal bromine solution for five minutes, and if 
no bromine is perceptible the coal is dangerous. Here again

it was desired to produce a more accurate test, and research 
along these lines has been begun in the laboratories of the 
Scientific and Industrial Research Council of Alberta* The 
method and the results obtained are described in chapter two 
of this thesis. Iodine was used instead of bromine in the 
same experiment and very interesting results were obtained. 
On the whole the results of these experiments support the 
theory that the readily oxidisable ulmin compounds play an 
important role in the weathering of coal.

"THE OXIDXSABLE CONSTITUENTS OF COAL" 
CHAPTER I. 

ULMIN COMPOUNDS 
INTRODUCTION 


History of Ulmins. 

Vanquelin (1797) found a black substance oozing from 
a wound in the bark of an elm tree, A similar substance was 
described by Thomson, as "a peculiar vegetable principle" 
under the name "ulmin" because of their original association 
with the elm (Latin Ulmus). Since these discoveries a number 
of black and brown substances have been isolated possessing 
the same properties# To these no matter how obtained, the 
names "ulmin", "ulmic acid", "humic acid" or humic substances 
have been given with but little discrimination. St ope3 and 
Wheeler suggest Thomson^ name "ulmin" for all the different 
but closely related groups of compounds to which so many dif¬ 
ferent names have been given. 

Properties & Occurrence of Ulmins. 

The natural ulmins, the brown amorphous products of 
plant decays are soluble in alkalis and are precipitated by 
acids as brown flocks# These properties have long been used 
as a criterion of what constituted an "ulmin”. Ulmins are 
found in any substance derived from vegetable matter that has 













10 


undergone moldering decay; for instance in soils, peats and to 
a less extent in lignites and coals. The ultimate analysis of 
all such ulmins is similar, ranging from 50 to 60 % C., 4.5$ H. 
0.5$ to 2.0$ N., and 30 to 40$ Oxygen. 

Varieties of Ulmins. 

The ulmins may be divided into; (a) Artificial ulmins 
(sugar ulMns). (b) Natural ulmins (peat or soil ulmins). 

(a) Artificial Ulmins. 

It is best to begin with /fche 

artificial ulmins, since they have been studied the most and 
are usually referred to as the standards with which naturally 
occurring ulmins are compared. In 1835 Malagute found that any 
dilute acid at a temperature not greater than 95°0. changed 
the sugar into ulmic acid if air was excluded. The acid used, 
to effect the reaction itself, remained unchanged, and there 
were no gaseous products of the reaction which he regarded as 
being simply the removal of several molecules of water from 
the sugar molecule (C^ H 22 0^ - C^2 %2 $6 + 5 ^O). When 
the acidified sugar solution was boiled for 15 hours it became 
dark red in color, with brown matter in suspension, this sus¬ 
pended matter increased in quantity as heating was continued. 

At the end of 80 hours the liquid was filtered and the brown 
precipitate collected. It was found to be partly soluble in 
ammonia and partly insoluble. The soluble form had all the 
characteristics of M ulraic acid”. The insoluble portion, 
though it had the same analyses as ulmic ac5.d, he regarded as 
a distinct substance and called it "ulmln” to indicate that it 


had no acid character

(b) Natural Ulmins. 

Mulder made an extended examination 
of the products extracted from peat by alkalis, and proclaimed 
an absolute identity between the compounds he thus obtained and 
the compounds he prepared from sugar. After extraction with 
alcohol, the peat was treated with a solution of sodium carbon¬ 
ate. Dense black peat gave a black extract, from which, a dark 
brown gelatinous precipitate was obtained on adding an acid. 
Brown peat gave a red solution and a brown precipitate. His 
analyses of the brown precipitates were C. 60.1^, H. 4.7^> 0. 
31 . 5 $ and N. 3 * 7 %* A few years later an interesting discovery 
was made by Doppler on peat deposits near Aussee. Layers of a 
jelly-like substance existed there, extending over a consider¬ 
able area and depth, about six feet beneath the surface of the 
bog. The name Dopplerite was suggested in honor of its dis¬ 
coverer, and by this name similar jelly-like deposits in peat 
have since been known. This substance lost about 3/4 of its 
weight as water on drying and became of a shining black ap¬ 
pearance. After being dried it showed no desire to absorb 
water and was nearly insoluble in water, alcohol or ether, but 
readily soluble in alkalis. The solution in alkalis could be 
precipitated by acids giving a substance which on drying ap¬ 
peared to be the same as the ulmin compounds. The analysis of 
peat ulmins show a considerable difference from the average 
analysis of sugar ulmins. Noting this, and having regard to 
one similarity in properties between the two ulmins. Bottom- 
ley sought to explain the different analyses by assuming the 








12 


presence of absorption compounds in the natural ulmins, which 
like other substances with colloidal properties, retains such 
compounds pertinaceously. The probabilities are that sugar 
ulmins are distinct but related compounds, differing not only- 
in composition but, to a certain extent in constitution. The 
chief difference between the natural and artificial ulmins is 
the presence of nitrogen in the former. 

Origin of Ulmins. 

An important difference between sugar ulmins and nat¬ 
ural ulmins is the presence of nitrogen in the latter. The 
nitrogen present is due to the presence of proteins, e«g, boil¬ 
ing ulmins with hydrochloric acid, esters of amino acids were 
separated, Millard suggested that the reaction between amino 
acids and glucose through the agency of bacteria may have aided 
in the formation of coal. He formulated a course for the re¬ 
action involving: 

1, Condensation between the amino group of the amino 
acid and the carboxyl group of the sugar e*g, 

CO 2 + H 2 0 
R - CH - COOH^ /

2, Loss of C0 2 from the carboxyl group of the amino 
acid residue.

other molecules

Fischer and Schraeder consider that ulmins originated 
from certain non-celulosic substances* According to them the 
two most important non-celluiosic constituents of plants are 
pentosens and lignin. Lignin is a constant constituent of 
straw, and especially of wood, from which raw-material coal is 
largely derived. It is attacked by micro-organisms with dif¬ 
ficulty if at all. As far as its solubility in alkalis and its 
physical properties are concerned it is already of a nature 
similar to ulmins. It is a very active absorbent of oxygen 
under alkaline conditions, being converted into dark-colored 
alkalis-soluble products which bear a close resemblance to 
natural ulmins. On the basis of this and similar facts, they 
put forward the view that lignin is the parent substance of 
ulmins. 

Formation of Ulmins in Coal. 

That coal has been derived almost entirely from vege¬ 
table matter is proven by the presence din lignite of abundant 
remains of plants and by the presence in decreasing amounts of 
distinctly recognizable plant remains in all the varieties of 
coal from lignite to anthracite. Since coal has been derived 
chiefly from woody constituents it consists mainly of the ele¬ 
ments which go to compos© wood, but it differs from wood in 
composition inasmuch as certain proportions of those elements 
have been changed during the fermentation and metamorphic pro¬ 
cess which have altered the wood to coal. Wheeler grouped the 
various plant entities and residues that have contributed to 
the formation of the organic substance of coal as follows: 










14 


1. Resistant to Decay, (a) Spore exines and cuticular 
tissue, and (b) resins. 

2. Subject to Decay:* are either (a) Organised, such 

as cellulosic and Xignitic tissues or (b) Amorphous, the contents 
of plant cells. 

3 . The Products of Decay. The ulmins. 

Judging from the nature of peat, the formation of ulmins 
is the main chemical process during the decay of plants, and it 
becomes more pronounced the older the deposit. Thus, whilst a 
young peat may yield only 10 or 20/S of ulmin material soluble 
in alkalis, as much as 70 or $ 0 % can be extracted from an older 
peat. It is therefor© to be expected that, chemically, coal 
will be divisible into two main groups of substances differing 
considerably from each other; the one composed of the resistant 
plant materials, perhaps in a somewhat changed form, the other, 
the ulmins, derived from the less resistant cellular structures 
and cell contents. 

Constitution of Ulmins. 

Information as to the constitution of ulmins has so far 
been limited to the recognition of the presence of certain group¬ 
ings in the molecules, which are undoubtedly very large and com¬ 
plex. The ulmins are true colloids and as such absorb salts and 
acids readily so that it is difficult to purify them. Bauman 
and Culley state "that the power of the ulmins to combine with 
alkalis is merely a manifestation of their colloidal nature and 







15 


their solubility in alkaline solutions has been regarded as dis¬ 
persion or peptisation". The bulk of evidence favors the view 
that the ulmins are true acids* It was shown that peat and soil 
ulmdns can be titrated with alkalis, using electro-chemical con¬ 
trol* Assuming the acidic character of ulmins the question re¬ 
mains whether this is due to carboxylic or phenolic groupings. 
Basing their views mainly on the synthesis of ulmins from ohenol 
and lignin, Fischer and Schraeder concluded that the ulmins are 
complex phenolic bodies. Marcuson on the contrary, has insisted 
on their carboxylic nature and has cited as proof of this, the 
ease with which esterification is effected and the evolution of 
CO 2 on moderate heating. The slow solubility of dopplerite in 
alkaline solution, and the marked evolution of CO 2 has led Tids- 
well and Wheeler, to conclude that, this natural ulmin is mainly 
an unhydrite of carboxylic acid. Of the remainder of the ulmin 
molecule still less is known. By such processes as nitration, 

chlorination, dry distillation and th© fact that all ulmins 

a, 

yield protoqtecuic acid on fusion with caustic alkalis, some 
evidence of the presence of aromatic nuclei and particularly of 

Q 

the grouping -0 has been obtained, but this evidence 

is not entirely conclusive, 

Francis and Wheeler as a result of a series of experi¬ 
ments on oxidation concluded that the nuclei of ulmin molecules 
consist of compact systems of six numbered groupings connected 
together by heterocyclic structures such as pyrolle and furan. 

The question cannot be regarded as settled; further 
experimental data, that can reconcile the conflicting circum¬ 
stantial evidence so far brought forward, is required.

Distribution of Ulmins in Coals. 

The alkali-soluble ulmins are to a great extent found 
in peats, less in lignites and as we reach the anthracites they 
disappear entirely. In other words as the metamorphism of coal 
is increased the character of the ulmin is changed and instead 
of being soluble in alkalis as in the case of peat ulmins, the 
coal-ulmins are not soluble. The ulmins may therefore, be 
divided into two groups, namely, (l) The alkali-soluble ulmins 
and (2) the coal ulmins. The alkali-soluble ulmins can be pre¬ 
pared from the coal-ulmins which are the main group of constit¬ 
uents of bituminous coals. The coal-ulmins are themselves in¬ 
soluble in alkalis, but oxidation renders them soluble, pre¬ 
sumably by reason of replacement of some of the external group¬ 
ings of the molecules by carboxyl groups. The composition of 
alkali-soluble ulmins, produced on the oxidation of coals, re¬ 
mains constant over a wide range of coals of different rank, 
indicating the presence of a similar type of material through¬ 
out such a range of coals are mainly due to modifications in 
the readily oxidisabie and replaceable external groupings of 
the coal-ulmin molecules. The most obvious example of a dif¬ 
ference of this nature is obtained on comparing peat with bitu¬ 
minous coal. The ulmins as they exist in peat, are soluble in 
alkalis, but they possess a similar molecular structure to that 
of the coal ulmins, which have undoubtedly been derived from 
materiel akin to the peat ulmins. The change of solubility in 
alkalis, which differentiates the peat-ulmins from the eoal- 
ulmins, is the first of the changes indicated in the changing 







17 


ranks of coals. The amount of alkali-soluble ulmins decreases 
with the increase in rank of coal, for instance, peat contains 
the greatest amount and next comes lignites etc. , end as we ap¬ 
proach the anthracites there are no alkali-soluble ulmins left. 

Relation of Peat to Coal. 

Although it has been suggested that the absence of sol¬ 
uble ulmins in the older fuels is due to the fact that their mode 
of formation was different from that of peat, it can be more 
simply accounted for by assuming a change in the ulmins which 
through condensation, dehydration, end loss of carboxyl group, 
lose their "characteristic" solubility in alkaline solution. 

This suggestion implies that the amorphous cementing material 
for the numerous plant structures in coal was originally a sol¬ 
uble ulmin, corresponding to the ulmins that surround and per¬ 
meate the plant structures in peats. Moreover, its amount should 
be comparable with that of the soluble ulmins in the older peats. 
Chemical evidence of this relationship is not difficult to find. 
Fischer and his co-workers have been able to demonstrate to some 
extent the presence of the same groupings and structures in peat 
ulmins, brown coals, end bituminous coals, Wheeler found that a 
close relationship exists between the peat ulmins and a character¬ 
istic amorphous portion (vitrain) of bituminous coal, and between 
the latter and the general ground mass of all portions of bitu¬ 
minous coals. 

The relationship between peat and coal is based on two 
substances which show remarkable physical resemblances; e.g. 








- 18 


dopplerite from peat, vitrain from banded bituminous coal. Dop- 
plerite is a homogenous jelly-like substance entirely free from 
plant structure* From its composition and chemical behaviour it 
is regarded as an almost pure form of peat ulmin* Vitrain* is 
transparent and essentially free from plant structures, such as 
spores exines end cuticles* Chemically, the two substances al¬ 
so show certain similarities, which are especially apparent in 
their products of destructive distillation* The tars as well 
as the gaseous products, apart from a large and characteristic 
evolution of C©2 from the younger ulmin, are almost identical, 
at all temperatures of distillation* The differences in com¬ 
position between the dopplerite and the vitrain can be accounted 
for by the splitting off of the carboxyl and hydroxyl groups in 
the former as indicated by the marked evolution of carbon di¬ 
oxide in the distillation of dropplerite* From the above it is 
evident that vitrain is similar to, though not identical with, 
dopplerite, and that it represents a more advanced stage in the 
process that has formed dopplerite from the decaying vegetation. 

Prolonged Oxidation of Coal* 

Further evidence of the ulmin nature of much of the coal 
substance may be found in the "resolution" of coal, by prolonged 
oxidation into soluble ulmins (oxidised ulmins) in the manner 
described by Francis and Wheeler* Their method of experiment 
was to draw a slow current of moist air through $0 grms* of the 
three ingredients, vitrain, durain and fusain, contained in glass 
tubes and maintained at a constant temperature during prolonged 
periods. The temperatures used for oxidation were 100®C. and 

* The four ingredients of British banded bituminous coal - vit¬ 
rain, clarain, durain, end fusain.

19 


and 200°C. and the total time allowed wa3 5 months, 6 months, 
and 6 weeks respectively. 

After oxidation at 150°C. the coals contained large 
quantities of ulmins and their properties then became largely 
those of the ulmins they contained. The volatile matter of the 
ulmins is high (about 41$) and the volatile matter of the coal 
especially that of the vitrain, approached this figure as their 
ulmin content approached 100$. 

The abowe experiment leads one to conclude that the vit¬ 
rain portion of banded bituminous coal was originally an alkali- 
soluble ulmin, but due to prolonged pressure etc. the external 
groupings were split off and were transformed into an insoluble 
ulmin. 

Attempted Classification of Coals by Means of their Ulmin Contents . 

(a) Early Method. 

The knowledge that ulmins form a dark brown solution 
when dissolved in alkalis has led to numerous attempts to class¬ 
ify coals according to their ulmin contents. An early method of 
distinguishing in doubtful cases between a lignite and a higher 
grad© coal was to treat them both with a solution of potassium 
hydroxide. If a brown liquor was obtained the coal was classed 
as a lignite, if the solution remained colorless or became but 
slightly yellow the coal was called bituminous. Unfortunately 
the work that has been carried out on the ulmins contained in 
coals is very limited and of very unsatisfactory character. 

Numerous observations have been made as to the production of 













- 20 - 


brown liquors when lignites or bituminous coals are treated with 
potassium hydroxide solution, but rarely have quantitative esti¬ 
mations of any value been recorded. 

(b) Hoffman Potash Test. 

Dr. G. C. Hoffman, chief chemist to the Geological-Survey 
of Canada treated various coals with a boiling solution of caustic 
potash of 1.12 specific gravity. He divided the coals tested 
into three groups: (1) "Lignites” communicating a deep brownish- 
red color: ( 2 ) "Lignitic coals" giving a brownish-red, and ( 3 ) 
"Coals" giving practically no colorization. Later he modified 
this test by treating finely powdered coals at room temperature 
with a solution of KOH 1.6 specific gravity for 2 hours with fre¬ 
quent shaking. This gave a number of shades of color. He di¬ 
vided the solution produced into ten grades ranging from intense 
brownish-red to colorless but his nomenclature would be somewhat 
difficult to standardize for general us©. His experiments were 
based on the above mentioned fact, nemely, that low grade coals 
such as lignites impart a deep-brown color to a solution of pot¬ 
assium hydroxide, v/hereas anthracites and the higher bituminous 
coals do not. The coals intermediate between the two impart 
various shades of brown according to their nature, so that the 
potash test may be used as a means of identification and classi¬ 
fication. J. H. H. Nieolls of the Mines Branch at Ottawa worked 
along the lines of Hoffman and compared the colors produced by 
the various coals with twelve standards of colored solutions. 

This test has been satisfactorily standardized though it does not 
seem possible at present to definitely classify coals by means 
of their Hoffman numbers.

(c) Oxidation of Coal. 

Based on the fact that the ulmin compounds are the readily 
oxidisable constituents of coal G. Charpy and G. Decorps were able 
to determine the degree of oxidation of coals by means of the fol¬ 
lowing procedure. A known weight of the powdered sifted coal is 
digested for two hours at 100°C. with 50$ aqueous sodium hydroxide, 
using 10 c.cs. for each grm. of coal. The resulting solution is 
diluted and filtered, the filtrate being acidified with sulphuric 
acid and mad© up to a known volume. To an aliquot portion of this 
liquid an excess of standard potassium permanganate solution is 
added and the mixture left for two hours at the ordinary temper¬ 
ature after which theexcess of permanganate is titrated with am¬ 
monium ferrous sulphate. Prom the results it is possible to cal¬ 
culate the oxidation index, ie. the number of grms. of oxygen re¬ 
quired to oxidise the organic matter dissolved by the alkali from 
one kilogram of coal. Coals which give a resistant coke have, as 
a rule, an oxidation index not exceeding two. 

In their work they plotted the results of another experi¬ 
ment on two coals showing the variation with time of the total 
weight and the oxidation index for two different samples of coal 
kept at 150 °C. In one case the weight increased at a gradually 
decreasing rate and after about 4 50 hours remained practically 
constant, the total increase being about 4.3$. The oxidation in¬ 
dex, originally 0.15 bad risen to 2?0. In the other case the 
weight had increased by 6.75$ after about 220 hours, but then com¬ 
menced to decrease again slowly. The oxidation index increased 
continually from the beginning. After 2000 hours the weight was 









21 - * 


still about 4.3# and the oxidation index, originally 0.15 had 
risen to 270. In the other case the weight had increased by 6*75/° 
after about 220 hours but then commenced to decrease again slowly. 
The oxidation index increased continually from the beginning. 

After 2000 hours the weight was slightly less than the original 
value and the oxidation index had risen to 860, while the coal had- 
become almost completely soluble in caustic soda solution. 

Although their results are more reliable than those form¬ 
erly mentioned, their method as published, appeared to be slow and 
unsatisfactory. It was thought that by some modification this 
method could be changed so as to obtain a quicker method by means 
of which the oxidisability of the coal could be determined, work 
along these lines were begun in the laboratories of the Scientific 
and Industrial Research Council of Alberta. 

Object of Invest!gat ion . 

Since different grades of coals contain varying amounts of 
oxidisable constituents, each coal will likely absorb an amount of 
oxygen corresponding to its ulraic contents. With this in view the 
object was to establish a so-called ”oxygen-number” for coals, 
similar to the M iodine number” in differentiating lipoidal sub¬ 
stances. Not only would it then be possible to distinguish between 
various ranks of coals, but also between various grades of the 
same rank. 

Development of University of Alberta Method. 

Charpey and Decorp*s method of extraction involved two 
hours treatment at a definite temperature and a further two hours 










-21-/3 


oxidation at room temperature* It was desired to simplify the 
test and to reduce the time by working at higher temperatures. 
The investigation was begun following closely the method of 
Charpy and Decorps, by treating two grains of finely ground 
coal with 20 c.cs. of a 50 $ aqueous solution of sodium hydrox¬ 
ide, this was heated to boiling (i.e. a temperature above 100°C.) 
filtered and made up to 150 c.ce. with distilled water. Forty 
c.cs. of this solution was acidified with sulphuric acid 
(whereby a brown floculent precipitate formed) added 10 c.cs. 
of 0.1 N permanganate solution, (it was found that warming 
greatly accelerated the reaction.) The solution was allowed 
to stand in the cold and the excess of KMnO 4 titrated with 
0.1 N ferrous ammonium sulphate solution. This method was 
slightly improved by following Hoffman’s test more closely. 

Thus, instead of sodium hydroxide, a solution of one part KOH 
in four parts of water was used. The color of the solution, 
after digestion, was distinctly deeper than with sodium hydrox¬ 
ide, and an addition of ten c.cs. of a tenth normal potassium 
permanganate, the color disappeared fairly rapidly even in the 
cold. At this point the method described briefly would b© to 
take a two grm, portion of finely ground coal and wet with 50 
c.cs. of one part of caustic potash in four parts of water and 
rapidly heated to boiling 15 minutes total heating. It is then 
cooled with forty c.cs. of cold distilled water, filtered 
through a gooeh-crucible into a 100 c.c. measuring flask. Fifty 
c.cs. of concentrated sulphuric acid is added to a 25 c.c. ali¬ 
quot of the solution, shaking and cooling under the tap for a 









- 22 - 


while. This is followed by the addition of 25 c.ce. tenth 
normal potassium permanganate solution and then heated to 
boiling rapidly and continued heating for fifteen minutes. 

After cooling under the tap, 25 c.cs. of a tenth normal fer¬ 
rous ammonium sulphate is added, and at once titrated back 
with a tenth normal potassium permanganate solution. 

A number of tests were carried out with the above 
method and the results obtained showed that it was difficult 
to obtain checks and the results obtained varied on using 
different quantities of acid as shown in the following. To 
four tubes, each containing 5 c.cs. of potassium permanganate, 
amounts of concentrated sulphuric acid (5 normal) varying from 
10 to 40 c.cs. were added and heated on a water bath. All 
the solutions went turbid but the turbidity decreasing with 
the increased amount of acid, indicating that a large quan¬ 
tity of sulphuric acid was necessary to have a clear solution. 
The effect of various concentrations of sulphuric acids with 
5 c.cs. of potassium permanganate in the coltfd was tried. 

With 10 c.cs, 50-50 h 2 S0 4 by volume there was a 
noticeable change. With 10 c.cs. one in six H 2 S0 4 by volume, 
no change appeared except on prolonged heating. The results 
indicate that the concentrated acid seemed to affect the per¬ 
manganate solution and this is probably the reason why satis¬ 
factory results could not be obtained. 

The oxidising action of sulphuric acid on the coal 
extract was tested. The following results show that the length 
of time required for complete oxidation would be too long:

Tests showed that heating 1-6 by volume H2SO4 with permanganate 
consumed a certain amount of permanganate, the coal extracts 
were, therefore heated in alkaline solutions without any acid 
present. The results were very encouraging although not quite 
satisfactory, since KB1O4 is a better oxidising agent in the 
presence of an acid. It was found necessary to use an acid 
which would not act on the permanganate and out of a few acids 
tried phosphoric acid five normal was found to have the desired 
action of an acid and yet to be in itself without effect on per¬ 
manganate solution. 

The length of time of heating the solution was then 
taken into consideration. Solutions were allowed to be heated 
for various lengths of time, the results as shown below indicate 
that one hour boiling gently on an electric heater is the opti¬ 
mum length of time, subsequent addition of 20 c.cs. tenth normal 
ferrous ammonium sulphate forms a merky precipitate which rapidly 
disappears on cooling. Both oxidised and unoxidised coals were 


tested.

The following slight changes in manipulation helped to 
obtain a clear solution, namely, the addition of the phosphoric 
acid subsequent to the potassium permanganate and the cooling 
of the solution under the tap previous to the addition of fer¬ 
rous ammonium sulphate. The solution of ferrous ammonium sul¬ 
phate contained 25 c.cs. of concentrated sulphuric acid per 
liter. Thus the method was finally standardized. 

Reagents Employed. 

1. Approximately O.l/ potassium permanganate standard¬ 
ized with sodium oxalate, 

2. Approximately 0,1/4? ferrous ammonium sulphate con¬ 
taining 25 c.cs, of concentrated sulphuric acid per liter. 

3. Potassium hydroxide solution prepared by dissolving 
one part in four parts of water and filtering. 

4. Five normal phosphoric acid made up by diluting 100 
c.cs. of concentrated ortho-phosphoric acid to one liter. 

Size of Coal Required. 

Various sizes of coal were tested with the potash test 
in order to get the right size which will absorb the maximum 
amount of oxygen. The following are the sizes used and the re¬ 
sults obtained:

20.70 is the desired size. 










Details of Method 


When the writer began hie work on this test the method 
was completely standardized. A detailed description of the 
method is as follows: Crushed coal is ground in a ball-mill 
filled with natural gas to prevent oxidation. From time to time 
it was screened through a 200 mesh screen and the oversize only, 
returned to the mill for further grinding until all passed the 
screen. Tn this manner a reasonably uniform sized product is 
obtained with all coals* If the oversize coal were discarded 
the harder particles of the coal sample would be excluded from 
the test. A 2 grm. portion of the ground coal is wet with 50 
c.cs. of a solution of one part of caustic potash in four parts 
of water and rapidly heated to boiling - 15 minutes total heating. 
It wis then cooled with a small addition of distilled water, 
filtered with suction through hard filter paper, washed and 
mad© up to 100 c.cs. To 10 c.cs. of this solution wfcs added 
20 c.cs. of one tenth normal potassium permanganate solution 
and 20 c.cs. of five normal phosphoric acid in the order stated. 
The mixture is heated rapidly to boiling in a small flask pro¬ 
vided with a reflex air condenser, a gentle boiling continued 
for a total time of heating of one hour. The flask is cooled 
under the tap, 20 c.cs. of one tenth normal ferrous ammonium 
sulphate solution is added and the mixture back titrated at 
once with the permanganate solution. A blank is run with each 
test and oxidation and titration are carried out in duplicate. 

The final results are expressed as grms. of oxygen required to 
oxidise one kilogram of coal as mined, also to oxidise one kilo¬ 
gram of pure, dry coal substance which is mineral matter and 


moisture free 









- 26 - 


Accuracy of Manipulation, 

Great care must be taken in filtering the solution so 
that no particles of coal can oass into the filtrate since the 
coal particles will be oxidised and the result will be an ex¬ 
cess of permanganate used. Overheating will also cause a simi¬ 
lar error. 

Calculations. 

The following example illustrates the calculations in¬ 
volved: O./N Permanganate solution has factor 0.986, therefore, 

1 c.c. is equivalent to (8 X 0.1 X 0.986) f 1000= 0.000789 gms. 
of oxygen. 

20 c.ce. of the ferrous ammonium sulphate solution were equal 
to 19*30 c.cs. KISh0 4 . 

The blank required 1.70 c.cs, KMn0 4 . 

Two grams of raw coal were taken for digestion and one tenth of 
the solution taken for oxidation etc. 

20 c.cs. KMi 0 4 added then 20 c.cs. ferrous ammonium sulphate and 

finally, 9*70 c.cs. KMa0 4 . Therefore, 0.2 grms. of coal required 

29.70 - (19*30 + l.?0) = 8.70 c.cs. KMtt0 4 . 1000 grms. of raw 

coal would require: 8.70 X 1000 X 0.000789 gms. of oxygen = 

7 

34.3 grms. of oxygen. 

The value 1000 X 0.000789 is constant in all the test with this 

0.2 

solution and equals 3*945* 

This can be converted to the oxidation factor on raw coal 
or the mineral matter and moisture free basis (i.e. pure coal) 


as follows: 







27 


In the coal test the ash « 4.70# and the moisture = 23 . 68 ^. 
To obtain the mineral matter content of the coal the ash is 
multiplied by an empirical factor 1*1 which in this case gives 
5*17/£* Calculating the oxidation factor to a m.m. and moisture 
free basis would be 34.3 X 100 _ » 48.3 gins, of oxy- 

T6o-l5.il + 23 . 85 ) 

gen. 

Table I, page 28 shows the ordinary analysis of some 22 
coals, together with the oxygen absorption values determined as 
above. Determinations were also made on a few of these coals 
after they had been exposed to a current of air at 105°C. for 
six hours, the results of which are shown in Table II ,page 29* 

The oxidisability of a coal, as measured by this test, is in- 
creased with oxidation in hot air. In the same way a weathered 
coal gives a higher value than the fresh coal from the same 
mine. It will thus be seen that as a coal matures from lignitic 
to anthracitic character its oxidisability decreases, but if a 
coal of any character becomes weathered its oxidisability in¬ 
creases, and its apparent maturity decreases. 

Value of Test. 

During the year the value of this test has been con¬ 
firmed, as it is a more sensitive test than, for example, the 
determination of volatile matter. Although its full value can¬ 
not be ascertained until more coals have been tested, yet the 
sensitiveness was very well shown by the various tests carried 
out on different coals, as described belcw.

Oxidation Curves. 

It has already been mentioned that when a coal was oxi¬ 
dised in a current of air at 105°C. for six hours the oxygen 
absorption increased but when a coal was oxidised for one hour 
at the same temperature the oxygen absorption was found to be 
lees than with the original coal, see Table III page 31, end 
as oxidation proceded from one hour to six hours the oxygen 
absorption increased* Curves were plotted from the results of 
a few of the coals thus treated, as shown in Fig, I, page 32, 
each curve presents a kink at the beginning of oxidation. The 
conclusion to be drawn from these result sis that the oxidis- 
ability of the coal is either affected by loss of moisture or 
by heat. 

To eliminate moisture as a factor two samples of a lig¬ 
nite coal were placed in a dessicator over sulphuric acid and 
under a high vacuum for one week so as to get the moisture 
driven off without the use of heat. The results as shown below 
indicate that although the amount of moisture driven off is but 
slightly different from that in the toluol oven, yet the oxygen 
absorption was identical with the original moisture-containing 
sample,

Heat Without Oxidation 


The effect of heating coal in the absence of air was 
then tried, A two grm. sample of coal was placed in the toluol 
oven and heated for one hour to 105°C. in a current of natural 
gas. On carrying out a potash test on this sample the results 
obtained were practically the same as with that of one hour 
oxidation, see Table IV page 34* But if the heating in natural 
gas were continued for six hours the oxygen absorption would be 
still less instead of rising as with six hours oxidation, see 
Table V, page 34 . Following this discovery both the oxidation 
and heating in natural gas from one to six hours were carried 
out on a lignite coal during one day so as not to allow any 
marked change in the coal on standing, the results obtained are 
very well shown in Fig. 2, page 35* On close examination of 
this curve one can at once see that on oxidation the curve lies 
above the line while on heating with natural gas the curve is 
below the line. It therefore shows the effect of two factors, 
first the effect of heat which causes the kink in the first 
part of oxidation and second, the effect of prolonged oxidation 
which causes a rise. The resultant of the two curves would in¬ 
dicate the effect of oxidation only, which would practically 
come to a straight line. 

To prove that the effect on the coal was entirely due 
to the heat and not to the natural gas was to substitute the 
natural gas with another inert gas. For this purpose about 
eight cubic feet of nitrogen gas was prepared and passed over 
a sample of lignite coal for one hour at a temperature of 105°C.

From the above experiments it was concluded that the 


heat affects the coal in some way as to render the ulmie com¬ 
pounds less readily soluble in potassium hydroxide solution* 

Table XII page 31 shows the effect of heating various 
coals with natural gas for one hour at 105°C« There is in¬ 
variably a lowering of the amount of oxygen absorbed after 
one hour heating than with the original coal. 

Comparison of Results with Oxygen Content and Ignition Temperature . 

Accompanying this thesis is a table (Table VI, page 
37) in which the results of oxidation are compared with the 
oxygen content and ignition temperature of the same coals. 

The results in this table were calculated by J. W. Suther¬ 
land. 

Conclusion. 

From the above results it is possible to draw the 
following conclusions:

is possible to explain certain peculiarities of coal which 
hitherto could have not been detected by ordinary and less 
sensitive methods, for example* It was known that Saunders 
Ridge and Lethbridge coals contain practically the same 
amount of moisture and yet whilst in the former it is possible 
to determine the volatile matter by quick heating in the latter 
slow heatir.ghad to be applied* It is probably possible to 
explain this by this method which shows that the Lethbridge 
coal is more lignitic in character than the Saunders coal. 

2. Another important use of this method is to dis¬ 
tinguish between coals of an upper seam and a lower seam in 
the same coal field. Analytically it is impossible to show 
any difference between such two coals and yet with this method 
the difference in maturity of two Druraheller coals (one of the 
upper seem 1.D.2* (29-20 W.4th.) and of the lower seam 
(29-20 W. 4 th.) (Table 1, page 28). For this reason the test 
is not only of theoretical interest but may possibly be of 
commercial interest, however more coals have to be tested 
before this can be conclusive. 

3 . That heat at 1Q5®C. affects coal in any way could 
not be detected by any method while with this method it was 
possible to show conclusively that heat at 105 ® 8 . affects 
coal to a certain extent. 

4. Finally it may be of value in classifying coals. 
According to the work carried out in these laboratories it 
is shown that it is possible to distinguish not only between 
lignites, sub-bituminous and bituminous coals but also be¬ 
tween various grades of lignites, which is clearly seen in 
Table I, page 28.

CHAPTER II. 

OXIDATION OF COAL WITH BROMINE (As an Indication to Spontaneous 

Combustion) 

WEATHERING OF COAL 
INTRODUCTION 


History 

The earliest authoritative discussion of the causes of 
weathering and particularly of spontaneous combustion seems 
to have been in a series of three reports to the British Parl¬ 
iament by De la Beehe and Playfair (1846-50) on w Stecan Coals 
for the Royal Navy”® They discuss the probable causes of 
heating and give analyses and arguments leading to the con¬ 
clusion that considerable quantities of dust in the coal are 
more likely to give trouble than the mere presence of pyrite. 

Regnauli (1855)» experimented with coals which he 
analysed» sealed up in corked flasks and set aside for twenty 
years; on re-analysis he could detect no alteration, probably 
because his chemical methods were not sufficiently delicate, 
Regnauli states that pyritic coals are known to weather# 

Grundmann (1862) conducted extensive experiments on 
the weathering losses of coals, end found that large pieces 
weather less than small; he also found that increase of tem¬ 
perature accelerated the weathering. His experiments on the 
loss in weight of coal were chiefly of use in that they at¬ 
tracted attention to the subject.

Percy (1864) was the next observer to ascribe spon¬ 
taneous combustion of coal chiefly to oxidation of the carbon¬ 
aceous matter of finely divided coal (dust) rather than to the 
pyrite as had commonly been assumed* 

Thompson (1865) noted that in six months a dry coal 
lost iy% of its calorific value, but that if the coal was 
moist the loss was much greater* 

Richters (1868) concluded that oxygen was absorbed by 
coal, part being again given off as carbon dioxide and water 
while the rest remained in combination. He found that the 
absorption was at first rapid, but later became very slow; he 
thought that the only effect of moisture is to disintegrate 
the coal when pyrite is present* 

The English Royal Commission (l8?6) ascribed spontan¬ 
eous combustion to pyrites, condensation of oxygen on the sur¬ 
face of the coal, end to oxidation of the coal matter itself* 
Fischer* (1901) concluded that weathering of coal is 
due to oxidation, that actual wetting hastens the weathering 
of pyrite and mercasite, and that many coals contain organic 
sulphur compounds. 

Dennsiedt and Bunz (1908) passed oxygen through coals 
at elevated temperatures* They found that coals which have 
been thoroughly wet, kindle more rapidly than those that have 
been kept dry; They state that M self ignition increases in a 
ratio corresponding to the amount of moisture in air dried 
coals* 0 * They further point out that coals which contain the

most oxygen are most liable to heating, and describe several 
chemical methods of predetermining the liability of coal to 
spontaneous combustion* 

Parr and Barker (1909) found that after mining, cosl 
commenced to absorb oxygen at the same time evolving methane; 
and that after two months all the methane had passed away, hut 
absorption of oxygen continued. 

Boudouard (1909) working from the chemical side of the 
question of loss of coking power, proved the formation of humic 
acids caused by oxidation of the coal matter and showed that 
the presence of these acids is very detrimental* 

Erdmann and Stolzenberg (190?) think that humic acid 
is the prime cause of heating, ©specially where ozone is pre¬ 
sent in the air, as at sea. 

Dennsedi end Seharper (191?) note that the greater the 
percentage of oxygen in the coal the greater will be the lia« 
bility to give trouble* 

CHEMICAL METHODS FOR DETERMINING THE LIABILITY OF A COAL TO 

OXIDATION. 

Habermann* found that the most easily oxidisable coals 
were those which were attacked by bromine with greatest valid¬ 
ity* 

Dennstedt and Schaper experimented with coals in a 
current of oxygen at a temperature of 150®0* They concluded 
that coals which show no tendency to increase in temperature 


* Schillings Journal fur Gasbel. Vol. *9, 1906 pp. 419-22 












- 42 


under these conditions are absolutely safe. According to 
Charpy and Decorps the acceleration in the absorption of at¬ 
mospheric oxygen, when the temperature is raised to 150°C. 
does not afford a convenient method for the determination of 
the comparative liability of samples to oxidation. They found 
that treatment with nitric acid effects an oxidation similar 
in character but far more rapid. They claim that the liabil¬ 
ity of a coal to oxidation can be determined by the measure¬ 
ment of the degree of oxidation produced by treatment for 3 
hours at 20®C. of 0.25 gms. of coal with 10 c.cs. of nitric 
acid. The quantity of products soluble in soda solution, and 
the further quantity soluble in water after treatment with 
soda indicate the degree of oxidation. The comparative suit¬ 
ability of a coal for prolonged storage before use, particul¬ 
arly for coking can thus be judged. 

Francis Fischer of Gottingen proposes the following 
test for the liability of a coal to oxidation. On© grm. of 
any finely divided coal be shaken with twenty c.cs. of half 
normal bromine solution for five minutes. If no small amount 
of bromine is perceptible, the coal is liable to undergo 
spontaneous combustion. This test was thought to b© very 
vague and it was desired to change this from a qualitative 
into a quantitative test. Consequently, a certain amount of 
research along the lines of Fischer was begun in the labor¬ 
atories of the Scientific and Industrial Research Council. 








- 43 - 


Instead of shaking up the coal with bromine an attempt was 
made to titrate a similar quantity of coal with a half normal 
solution of bromine. 

Development of Test. 

It was attempted to develop a method by which coals 
could be oxidised very rapidly. If a solution of bromine is 
allowed to trickle down through a column of coal the first 
drops of the bromine in the solution will be rapidly used up 
in oxidising the surface layers of the coal; as more solution 
is added the bromine goes further down the column before it 
is reduced as the upper layers become oxidised. Finally un¬ 
reduced bromine escapes through the column and can be detected 
by a starch KI solution (used as an indicator). 

The results obtained depend on: 

(a) Strength of the solution. The stronger the 
solution the greater is its oxidisable power. 

(b) The temperature. 

(c) The rate at which the solution is passed 
through which depends on the number of c.cs. of the solution 
per cubic centimeter of the surface of the coal. 

(d) The surface of the coal exposed. It varies 
with the weight and the fineness of the coal. 

Experimental. 

(a) Fineness of Coal. 

The size of the coal to be used had to be determined. 
It was found that a coal ground very fine (-200 meshy was not 
practice! since it blocked the bromine solution so that it

could not pass through in the desired length of time. On try¬ 
ing out other sizes it was found that coal ground to pass 65 
mesh and retained on 100 mesh was the best size for this pur¬ 
pose. 

(b) Method. 

A five grm. portion of finely divided coal (+100 mesh) 
is placed in a narrow elongated glass tube so that the coal 
occupies about 1/3 of the length of the tube. The bromine solu¬ 
tion is allowed to run in from a burette and forced through the 
coal by means of a rubber aspirator bulb also connectaAto the 
glass tube, as shown in Fig. 3 page 45 . The solution is forced 
out of the glass tube containing the coal into en er^Jhyer flask 
containing some starch KI solution. The rate at which the 
bromine is passed through the coal is very important. On© c.c. 
of bromine is allowed to run into the glass tube at fifteen 
second intervals, during the remainder of the fifteen seconds 
the solution is forced through the column of coal and the 
starch KI solution shaken up. As long as the bromine is being 
absorbed by the coal a colorless liquid (water) runs into the 
starch KI solution. But as soon as the coal ceases to absorb 
the full ©mount of bromine, the liquid which is forced out con¬ 
tains traces of bromine which on coming in contact with the 
potassium iodide liberates the iodine and the starch is colored 
blue. As soon as the starch solution attains a definite blue 
color the end point is reached. The final results are expressed

the following; 

1. A glass tub© -jr" in diameter and 10 M long. 

2. A rubber cork with two appertures, one for the end of 
the burette and the other for the glass tube to which

Reagents. 

1. 0.5 /N bromine solution, standardized by placing I 2 
from Kland titrating with a standard sodium thiosulphate solu¬ 
tion. 

2. A starch solution (prepared in the usual manner) con¬ 
taining some KI solution. 

Conclusions. 

A very small number of coals were tested by this method 
and the writer does not feel justified to draw any definite con¬ 
clusions. Its full value cannot be ascertained until more coals 
have been tested. However, from the little work that has been 
done there is an indication that this test may be of value. The 
exactness and accuracy, that a quantitative test requires is 
lacking for the following reasons. The solution is run in 
quantities of approximately on© c.c. at a time and then again 
the end point as indicated by the appearance of blue color, de¬ 
pends on individual judgement. These factors may cause a dif¬ 
ference of a few e.cs. in two titrations, and one can easily 
see the final error when the results are calculated in grms. of 
oxygen. In spite of that the results as shown in Table VII, 
page48 indicate a greet tendency to differentiate between vari¬ 
ous coals. 

With the bromine method it is not only possible to dis¬ 
tinguish between lignite coals but it seems also to affect bitu¬ 
minous coals much better than the KOH method. The oxidising ef¬ 
fect on the same coals with the Br 2 and KOH methods is shown in

OXIDATION OF COAL WITH IODINE 


INTRODUCTION 


Bromine is a very volatile element and causes great 
difficulty in manipulation. On account of its volatility the 
strength of the solution diminishes from one test to the other 
hence it is necessary to re-standardize the solution before 
every test. It was suggested to try other oxidising agents such 
as KMhO^ etc, but it was found that KMnQ^ does not oxidise the 
coal in the cold. It was desired to obtain an oxidising agent 
which should affect the coal in the cold and in a very short 
time and yet b© non-volatile. Iodine, being next in the series 
in the halojen family was tried out, it was found that although 
it is not as powerful m oxidising agent as bromine, yet it re¬ 
acted very quickly with the coal and is a much more convenient 
reagent to work with. It is non-volatile and does not possess 
the objectionable physical properties as those of bromine. The 
solution of iodine was made up by dissolving a weighed quantity 
with a few c.cs. of a concentrated potassium iodide solution, 
so as to decrease the vapor pressure of the iodine and render

it more soluble in water* 0*1 Normal was used instead of 0*5 /N 
as in the case of bromine* Hence, the results expressed in grins* 
of 0 2 are numerically less with iodine than with bromine* 

Method 

The procedure was exactly the same as with bromine, ex¬ 
cept that a pure starch solution was used instead of a starch 
KX solution as in the case with bromine* To get a better end 
point a known quantity of standard solution of sodium thio¬ 
sulphate is added to the starch solution* The extra amount of 
iodine used to counteract the thy ©sulphate is subtracted from 
the total amount of iodine used. 

Calculations* 

The results were calculated similarly to those with 
bromine (see calculations under bromine method)* 

Results* 

The results are shown in Table VXX, page 48 alongside 
with those of bromine. The iodine, like the KOH method does 
not seem to have a marked effect on bituminous coals while 
with lignites the reaction is more marked. The results of the 
action of iodine on a group of coals were plotted against those 
of the action of bromine on the same group. As shown in Fig. 

5, page 52 there is a noticeable relation between the two 
methods as far as the lignitic coals are concerned but as far 
as the bituminous coals are concerned no relation exists.

It is interesting to note that the relation between these two 
methods is very similar to that of bromine and KOH. A better 
relation exists between the oxidation of coal by iodine and 
that of KOH as shown in Fig. 6, page 54. Here, the iodine 
results were plotted against those of KOH. With either method 
the bituminous coals were very little affected while the lig¬ 
nites show a relative gradation. 

Conclusion. 

Here again, due to the very few coals tested the writer 

is not justified to draw any definite conclusions. On close 

examination of the curves in Figs. 4,5 end 6, there seems to 
def mite 

be a relation between the Br2 and Ig oxidation of coal and 
their ulmin content. This inference is drawn from the fact 
that in the KOH method the oxidation was carried out on the 
ulmins themselves and not on the coal as a whole, yet the re¬ 
lation between the results obtained from the oxidation of the 
ulmins is strikingly similar to those obtained from the oxi¬ 
dation of the coals by Ig, to a certain extent, also with those 
obtained by the bromine method. These facts seem to support 
the views ©f certain authorities who claim that the ulmin com¬ 
pounds ar© the chief factors which play an important part in 
the process of spontaneous combustion.

THE VOLATILE MATTER CONSTITUENTS OF COAL WITH 

PARTICULAR REFERENCE AS TO THEIR RELATION TO 

THE COAL AND OIL DEPOSITS IN ALBERTA 

GENERAL INTRODUCTION 

Certain geologists have developed a formula based on 
the chemical composition of the coal found in any district 
which they employ to indicate the possibility of the occur¬ 
rence of oil in the district and the probable nature of such 
oil. This connection between the composition of the coal 
and the occurrence of oil is known as the carbon-ratio theory. 
The writer of this thesis will endeavor to present a clear con¬ 
ception of the carbon-ratio theory by quoting from many geol¬ 
ogists. The theory as proposed by David White* was based on 
his observations in Pennsylvanian coal fields. There he found 
the existence of a close relationship between the fixed car¬ 
bon of the coal (pur© coal) and the character of the oil pre¬ 
sent in that area. This theory has since been corroborated 
by many observers who worked in coal and oil fields other 
than those of Pennsylvania. On the other hand, there are 
many inconsistencies in this theory which have led to many 
geological controversies. Every publication, so far, of 
investigation, observation and criticism has been of a geol¬ 
ogist and not that of a chemist.

Petroleum”. Wash. Acad. Sci. Journal. Vol. 6 No. 5 P»512 

























- 55 - 

The writer, being a chemist, will attempt to criti- 
cise the theory from the chemical view only. In order to 
give a clear conception of the theory as it exists today it 
will be necessary for him to quote many geologists, for and 
against the theory. 

The theory is still in its infancy, yet it has aroused 
wide-spread interest. Since its enunciation, its applic¬ 
ability has been tried in most of the coal and oil bearing 
areas of the United States, It has been applied success¬ 
fully not only to many areas other than those of Pennsyl¬ 
vania, but it has also been claimed to be applicable in 
China. On the strength of such wide applicability, Dr. 

Hume* of Ottawa, made an attempt to apply this theory to 
Alberta, He believes in the strong points of the theory and 
does not take into consideration many of the inconsistencies 
which it presents. Although he believes that certain modi¬ 
fications of the theory would be necessary, due to the dif¬ 
ferent age of the Alberta coals from those of the Appalachion 
region for example, still he claims that the Alberta plains 
afford a suitable place for the application of this theory. 

It is interesting to note that within the boundaries 
of the Alberta coal fields there are practically all grades 
of coal present, from the brown lignites in the eastern 
plains to the semi-anthracites in the Rocky Mountains. In 
the coal fields of Pennsylvania, however, the coals range

only from bituminous to anthracite. 

Taking the above facts into consideration and keep¬ 
ing in mind the large number of lignites present in Alberta, 
research work has been undertaken in the laboratories of the 
Scientific and Industrial Research Council of Alberta. The 
immediate object of investigation was to clear up a discrep¬ 
ancy overlooked by geologists who employed without discri¬ 
mination in their calculations, the results obtained by two 
quite distinct methods for the determination of volatile 
matter in coal, although it was well known to chemists that 
the results were notably different. The results of this in¬ 
vestigation will be discussed in this paper. On the strength 
of this as well as on other chemical factors, the writer 
criticises both the applicability of the theory to Alberta 
coals snd the method hitherto employed for calculating car¬ 


bon ratios

INTRODUCTION 


History of the Carbon-Ratio Theory. 

In 1915» David White enunciated what has since been 
known as the "carbon-ratio theory” which has received almost 
general acceptance in petroleum geologic circles. It has 
been pointed out by White that there is a relation between 
the character of the oil found in any area and the character 
of the coal since, "petroleum is a product generated in the 
course of geodynamie alteration of deposits of organic debris 
of certain types buried in the sedimentary strata, the quan¬ 
tity and character of the oils generated are determined 
(a) by the composition of the organic substances; (b) by 
the stage in progress of the dynamic-chemical alteration of 
the .organic substances; (c) by the elimination under certain 
conditions of the heavier and more viscous hydrocarbons 
through filtration incident to migration”. Thus, the lowest 
ranks of oils is found where there is little alteration in 
the carbonaceous deposits and with the increase of carbon¬ 
isation the oils become higher in quality, that is, the 
lowest grad© of oils would be found in places where low 
grade coals are present, while where bituminous coals occur 
the oils are of high rank. The quality of coal, i.e. the 
amount of fixed carbon in the coal may be taken as an index 













- 58 - 


of the degree of metamorphism of the coal as well as of the 
sediments in which it occurs. 

Basis of Carbon-Ratio Theory, 

White has shown that there is a common relationship 
between coal, oil shales and petroleum. He divides the form¬ 
ation of the above into two stages. (1) The biochemical stage, 
in which the transformation of the plant or animal organic 
matter takes place and (2) the geochemical stage which con¬ 
sists in the alteration of peat to coals of successive ranks, 
such as lignite, sub-bituminous, bituminous etc., which he 
considers is a geochemical process induced by other dynamic 
influences, especially thrust pressure with their attendant 
temperatures. The greatest changes attend the greatest dyn¬ 
amo-thermal activity. This alteration of the organic matter 
is progressive, it is marked particularly by the gradual 
elimination of its volatile matter. 

Noting the gradual elimination of volatile matter 
from the oil shale simultaneously with the devolatilization 
of the associated coals in the course of the progressive 
regional alteration of the organic deposits, White called 
attention to several other points which seem to indicate a 
mutual relationship between coal and netroleum in the geo¬ 
chemical stage of development and that both react to the 
same geophysical influences as follows. That in regions 
where the coals are of the rank of brown lignites the oils

- 59 


in the same region are also of low rank etc. Wherever the 
devolatilization of the coals have progressed so far that they 
have a fixed carbon of 70# or more, oils if present, are in 
pockets and too small for commercial production. In conclusion 
he says " It will at once be seen that these conditions seem 
to define a law restricting the distribution of production of 
oil pools, end to afford a basis on which to eliminate many 
areas of great extent in which fruitless and costly operations 
by the drill is now going forward”. 

Use of Terms. 

Before going further, it is best that all terms used 
in this paper should be clearly understood. An indication 
as to how the terms of this subject have been misinterpreted 
is given in an article by Dr. Murray Stewart criticising, not 
the carbon-ratio theory itself, but the views apparently held 
by a large number of petroleum technologists and geologists 
as to what is really meant by w carbon-ratio". He gives the 
two following instances read before the Institution of Pet¬ 
roleum Technologists to illustrate the erroneous idea that is 
apparently prevalent as to what is meant by the term:- 

".......David White first directed attention to the 

relationship between the carbo-hydro gen of a coal and the 
nature of hydro-carbons in a geological succession. He de¬ 
monstrated that in the Pennsylvanian oil fields, heavy oils 
were met with when the ratio of fixed C. to H. in coals was 
50 to 55 P© r cent., etc...." 












60 - 


The following occurs in another paper:- 

".What justification is there for assuming 

that the method of sampling and the stated limits have al¬ 
lowed for the important factors, other than regional meta¬ 
morphism, which influences the C/h ratio?”. 

In both of the above instances it is seen that the 

carbon- ratio has been confused with the carbon-hydrogen 

contents of coal, which is a very different thing. If all 

the carbon in coal existed in the fixed carbon portion and 

the V.M. consisted exclusively as hydrogen, then it might 

tu , 

be permissible to refer to A carbon-ratio as the C/H ratio, 
but, since such is not the case and there is a very consid¬ 
erable quantity of carbon in volatile matter of a coal it 
is obvious that to do so is wrong. Not only is it wrdng 
but it is obvious that values which apply to the carbon- 
ratios of coals do not apply to the percentage ratios of 
carbon to hydrogen in the coals. For example, coals are 
known that have a carbon ratio of 50, but a C. H. ratio over 
90 . 

Carbon-Ratio. 

This term was given by David White to the percentage 
of fixed carbon (pure coal basis) in the coal. It is not the 
fixed carbon of the ordinary analysis which includes both water 
and ash but it is the percentage of fixed carbon after water 
and ash have been eliminated and the coal is reduced to a fixed 












- 61 - 


carbon volatile matter basis, that is, fixed carbon plus vola¬ 
tile matter equals 100. It is computed by dividing the fixed 
carbon of the proximate analysis by the sum of the fixed carbon 
and the volatile matter of the same analysis as expressed by the 
following formula: 

Carbon-Ratio « F.C. _X 100 

F.C. + V.M. 

Tsocarb ft Xsovole. 

These two terms are used extensively by geologists who 
are employing maps of certain districts to indicate the areas 
where the coals contain equal carbon-ratios or equal volatile 
matter contents. 

When carbon-ratios are plotted on the map the equal 
carbon ratios are joined by lines, to these lines David White 
applied the name Isocarbs. The term isovole is applied to lines 
joining points of equal volatile matter. 

General Relations. 

In general it has been found that in the oil fields 
throughout the world the occurrence of 70^ fixed carbon in pure 
coal establishes a dead line as regard to petroleum ana natural 
gas, although slight accumulations of these products may be 
found above this limit, no instance of commercial deposits are 
known. Fuller summarizes the relationship in the following 
table, the outline of which is more specific in its sub-divi¬ 
sions than those in the paper of Dr. White, it embodies statements 
as to the prevailing characteristics of the sands and water con¬ 
ditions not mentioned by the latter.

Inconsistencies of Theory. 

Too many difficulties have to be overlooked, difficulties 
which the theory is powerless to handle for the corroborative evi¬ 
dence to be conclusive, for this reason Fuller suggests that in 
utilizing his table it is to be born in mind that the limits of any 










- 63 - 


group are not hard and fast but are subject to more or less vari¬ 
ation* Analyses of the same coal may range through several points 
owing to differences in laboratory manipulation, while the coals 
in a given region may vary in a point or two, possibly more oc¬ 
casionally, as a result of original differences in material, 
changes incident to migration, composition of enclosing formation, 
and losses by natural distillation. For these reasons more or 
less generalization is always necessary in drawing isocarbs showing 
the carbon ratios* Isolated cases of high "fixed” carbon in areas 
of predominantly low ratios and of low fixed carbon in areas of 
high ratios are usually of little real significance where the dif¬ 
ferences are only 2 or 3 points, although "islands” of high or low 
ratios due to definite dynamic conditions and correspondingly either 
more or less favorable than the surrounding areas occasionally oc¬ 
cur. 

Specific Relations of Carbon-Ratios. 

The theory as laid down recognizes that the absolute 
carbon-ratio is not the only factor involved with respect to the 
presence or absence of oil and its character* But some of the 
other points to be considered, such as the relation of carbon- 
ratios to depth, unconformity, structure and temperature are also 
of great importance. 

(a) Relations of Ratios to Depth. 

The samples of which analyses are made are necessarily 
taJcen at or near the surface in predicting the possibilities of 









- 64 - 


oil. The ratios increase through successive seams downwards as 
well as laterally towards a region of disturbances, the ratios 
found there are likely to be several points, perhaps five or more 
higher than that at the surface. According to Fuller no conclusions, 
as to oil possibilities, should be drawn until a sufficient number 
of analyses of deep coals, made from samples obtained from boring 
or deep shafts, are available. The rate at which carbon percentages 
increase with depth is as yet unknown. It will probably vary, being 
most rapid over or near areas of marked disturbances and least rapid 
in the broad and deep basins furthest removed from such action. 

Fuller believes that the depth at which the "dead line” (C.R. of 
70$ is reached is probably much shallower than often believed, 
possibly 4000 feet where the surface carbon-ratio is 55 to 60. With 
lower surface ratios the depth should be greater but it is believed 
that oil will be found in paying quantities at a depth of 6000 to 
10000 as has frequently been predicted by oil men, no matter how 
favorable the character of the rocks and the structures may be, 
except possibly in unconsolidated deposits. 

(b) Relation of Ratios to Unconformities. 

Fuller makes the following statement: "Any important hiatus, 
whether or not represented by a recognizable unconformity, is 
likely to be marked by a rather sudden rise of the fixed carbon 
in passing downward across the break". He cites examples to show 
that this is true. It is natural to suppose that the older beds, 









- 65 - 


being deeper, will have undergone greater heat and pressure than 
the younger strata and that the older rocks have been subjected 
to longer periods of deformation. 

(c) Relations of Carbon-Ratios to Structures. 

That there may be a certain relation between carbon- 
ratios and the immediately associated structural features is in¬ 
dicated by David White, who says: "In another place, I have shown 
that the abnormally high percentages of volatile matter (low car¬ 
bon ratios) sometimes found in coals lying in folds and generally 
to be observed in thrust-faults in coal fields, are really due to 
compensation or neutralization of the thrust by buckling of the 
beds and by the faults themselves. Through shortening of the 
crustal ore by folding or by overthrust of broken beds the stress 
is partially compensated and the coals are enabled to escape the 
maximum pressure intensity". Fuller confirmed this by a study of 
the ratios in the faulted regions of Pittsburg and adjoining coun¬ 
ties in Oklahoma which seem to bear out White’s conclusions as to 
the low ratios associated with faulting. He gives the groups of 
adjacent locations which have the following relations:

The Effect of Temperature. 

Fuller considers temperature as being a possible con¬ 
trolling factor at depths below a certain heat it may be conceived 
that the pressure prevents the breaking up of the hydrocarbons, 
while at depths above the same point, although the heat may be less, 
the pressure may be sufficiently reduced to permit the breaking up 
and the escape of the volatile constituents. It has also been sug¬ 
gested that because of the nature of the folding there may be more 
open spaces due to the stretching of the strata, with a more ready 
escape of the volatile matter on the anticlines than in the synclines. 
Although it is impossible to definitely state that the forgoing is 
the decisive factor in determining the carbon-ratios, it is certain 
that the carbonization is greatest on the anticlines. According to 
Fuller not only do the carbon ratios show this, but there are re¬ 
corded instances of anthracite on certain anticlines (in eastern 
Pennsylvania), while in the adjoining synclines the coals approach 
the bituminous character. 

It may be remembered that, where the carbon ratios of 
coal indicate a favorable degree of metamorphism for oil and gas, 
other conditions necessary for the accumulation and preservation of 
the oil and gas must be present before drilling is warranted to 
test these prospective areas. Thus, given suitable source materials 
for oil and gas under favorable metamorphism, there must be porous 
horizons to contain the oil and gas when formed and these must ex¬ 
tend into structures which are suitable for the accumulation under

conditions where escape is prevented by an impervious cover. Un¬ 
less these conditions are present the carbon ratios have no value 
as to indicating the presence of oil or gas, but as a preliminary 
step in the search for suitable structural conditions they are valu 
able aid in separating the promising from the unpromising prospec¬ 
tive areas* It has been pointed out by W. Rogers that if source 
rocks and porous reservoirs are not present, there will of course, 
be no production, no matter how ideal the isocarbs are* On the 
other hand, if the isocarbs are extremely unfavorable, there should 
be no oil or gas production, even though the other favoring con¬ 
ditions are present. 

Proof of the Carbon-Ratio Theory . 

Before proceeding to an examination of the proofs, it is 
of course advisable to state a brief summary of the theory* In 
its original statement four distinct propositions are found: (l) 

The absence of oil and gas in regions of high carbon-ratios (more 
than 85) 1 (2) The occurrence of oil and gas fields in areas of 
medium carbon-ratios (50 to 65 ); (3) The occurrence of gas in 
areas of higher carbon-ratios than those in which oil is found; 

( 4 ) The occurrence of lighter oils in areas of higher carbon-ratios 
A fifth and very important division of the theory, added by Fuller 
in 1919, is that the porosity decreases towards areas of higher 
carbon-ratios* A sixth proposition, that oil production is ab¬ 
sent or relatively rare in strata closely associated with coals 
of very low carbon, such as lignites, brown coals, and peat, may 
also be included in the theory. 






























- 68 - 


This last decade or more has witnessed widespread ac¬ 
ceptance of the truth of the relationship pointed out by White 
as further detailed investigations of the other oil producing 
areas of the United States have shown the observation of White 
to hold to a remarkable degree* These investigations, notable 
among which are those of Fuller for Texas and Oklahoma, Russell 
for Kentucky, Moulton for Illinois and Reger for West Virginia, 
have not only corroborated the general relationship of degrees 
of alteration as shown by coals with occurrences of gas and vary¬ 
ing qualities of oil, but the numbers - the percentages - of 
White have been found to be the same in the other oil fields. This 
identity of numbers is one of the most striking features of the 
later work upon the carbon-ratio theory* According to Dorsey, 

"It is fairly safe to say that the net result of all the later 
checking of White’s observations has shown that, regionally, the 
relationship by the carbon-ratio theory appears to hold for the 
entire country}' 

Fuller’s Corroboration of the Carbon-Ratio Theory . 

Most of Fuller*s investigations have already been men¬ 
tioned above, but the extent to which he believes in the carbon- 
ratio theory may be seen from his own quotation "Dr* White’s pre¬ 
mises and reasoning have been generally recognized as sound, and 
they main hypothesis has not been disputed”. According to him, 
practically no exception to the general principle of distribution 
has been developed, and the theory affords a simple and practic¬ 
ally sure method of eliminating regionally unpromising territory* 



































- 69 - 


Many of the State’s geologists are still neglecting the carbon- 
ratios in outlying territory and overlook its bearing on the pre¬ 
sence or absence of oil* If the carbon-ratio theory were taken into 
consideration, wherever drilling for oil is undertaken, it would 
be of the greatest economical value, for example, in North-Texas 
field alone not less than twenty five and possibly more wells, 
costing an average of $40,000. each or a total of more than a 
million dollars, have been sunk within one year in localities 
where the carbon-ratios are known to be prohibitive. 

Non-Acceptance of Theory Due to its Inconsistencies. 

Owing to the various causes, such as differences in the 
original sources of oils, changes due to the filtration incident 
to migrations, the influence of the composition of the formation 
containing the oil, the loss of volatile matter through natural 
distillation, etc., the subsidiary hypothesis of a direct relation¬ 
ship between carbon ratios and the composition of oils has failed 
to hold true in many instances, engendering an unwarranted distrust 
of the most fundamental part of the hypothesis, as a result of 
which comparatively little application has been made of it in the 
field. 

Russell’s Corroboration. 

William Russell in a recent paper "The Proof of the Car¬ 
bon-Ratio Theory" presents the available data indicating that the 
relationship between the carbon-ratio and oil and gas occurrence, 
is produced by Tectonic forces more than by conditions of sedimen¬ 
tation. The evidence considered is from the laboratory and the 











- 70 - 

field. Owing to the composite nature of the theory, he considered 
the evidence regarding each portion separately. Hie paper wae in- 
tiated by the fact that many geologists do not question the prac¬ 
tical value of the hypothesis, but claim that the absence of oil in 
the areas where the coals have a high content of carbon is due to the 
change in the conditions of sedimentation rather than to the influence 
of tectonic forces, which he admits is a problem of important prac¬ 
tical significance, for there are certain regions in which the con¬ 
ditions of sedimentation are favorable for the development of oil 
pools, but where, according to the carbon-ratio theory, there should 
be no production. 

Experimental Evidence. 

Under the heading of ”experimental evidence” he says: "At 
any rate, the general results of the experiments relating to the 
distillation of oils and oil shales seem to be in support of the 
carbon-ratio theory, if they have any bearing on it at all, for they 
indicate that variations in the temperature, pressure, and other con¬ 
ditions have an important effect on the quality of the resulting oils, 
and on the proportions of oil to gas. Hence these experiments sug¬ 
gest that the variations in these conditions which are known to oc¬ 
cur with the increase in the carbon-ratios of the coals may account 
for the change in the gravity of the oils and in the proportions of 
gas to oil toward areas of higher carbon-ratios”. 

By means of chemical and physical iiws, he explains the 
manner in which variations in heat and pressure during the origin of 
oil and gas affect the quality and proportions of the resultant pro-

ducts. Thus, if the pressure is hydrostatic it will tend to favor the 
generation of the denser compounds, while if it is non-uniform it will 
tend to favor the generation of either dense compounds or compounds 
which are fluid and can escape from the system and so relieve the pre¬ 
ssure. Also the heavier molecules of the substances which form oil 
and gas are more unstable and more readily dissociated than lighter 
ones. Hence, under the comparativlev low pressures and temperatures 
which were generated in the regions of low carbon-ratios, only the 
heavier molecules of the parent substances might be dissociated, 
forming comparatively heavy oils. Under the greater temperatures 
and pressures which characterise the areas of high carbon-ratios, 
the lighter molecules might dissociate, forming lighter oils. In 
the regions of the most intense alterations all the molecules ex¬ 
cept the very lightest might have dissociated, forming only gas. 
Although the above mentioned is merely a speculation, yet it might 
account for the generation of lighter oils and more gas in regions 
of higher carbon-ratios. 

Field Evidence. 

Under this heading Russell considers other lines of evi¬ 
dence such as evidence of porosity, metamorphism etc., to prove that 
the relationship between the carbon-ratio and oil production is due 
to regional alteration of the sediments by dynamic forces and not to 
the original changes in the conditions of sedimentation. He claims 
that metamorphism is due to tectonic forces, end not any conditions 
of sedimentation, thus supporting this theory. This is proved by

the slow, steady alteration of the various metamorphic characteristics 
such as the porosity, crushing strength, density, and the carbon- 
ratios of coals* The oil pools not only do not occur in the true 
metamorphic rocks, but they do not occur in a wide zone around them, 
where the stnata possess some of the characteristics of metamorphism. 

It has been found out that as the carbon-ratio in coal in¬ 
creases the porosity of the sandstones become too low to yield large 
flows of water or oil, that is, there is a gradual change from the 
porous rocks found in areas containing coals of low carbon-ratios, 
to dense strata associated with coals of high carbon-ratios. It is 
evident, therefore, that the relation of the porosity to fixed car¬ 
bon content of coals affords definite proof that the absence of oil 
and gas production in regions of high carbon-ratios is due to re¬ 
gions! alteration caused by tectonic forces. 

Evidence of Porosity. 

In a recent paper Rogers has shown that the average por¬ 
osity of the sandstones is closely related to the carbon-ratios of 
the coals, ©id that, it could be based as an index of the alteration 
in areas where the coals are absent. A series of tests showed that 
the porosity of the pur© quartz sandstones readily decreases towards 
areas of high carbon-ratios, until in regions of anthracite coals it 
is only 1 or 2 percent or even less. The evidence indicates that 
there is a gradual change from the porous rocks found in areas con¬ 
taining coals of low carbon—ratios to the dense strata associated 
with coals of high carbon-ratios, and finally to the genuine quart¬ 
zites associated with anthracites and grphites.

Melcher has shown that the rate of production of oil and 
gas is dependent on the porosity and that if it is below a certain 
limit oil and gas cannot be produced in commercial quantities. Since 
the porosity of the sandstones associated with the coals of high 
carbon-ratios is well below this limit, oil and gas in commercial 
quantities could not be produced from them even if the conditions of 
sedimentation were favorable. 

Conclusions, 

Russell concludes "that the experimental data regarding the 
generation of oil and gas from bituminous rocks are at present too 
meager to furnish any definite evidence regarding the validity of the 
carbon-ratio theory; that the field evidence indicates that the por¬ 
osity of sandstones and other reservoir rocks is reduced by dynamic 
alterations and this decrease in pore space is an important factor in 
causing the absence of oil in areas containing coals of high carbon- 
ratios; that the intense deformation of rocks causes the oil and gas 
to escape, end that this is one reason why they are absent from 
areas that have been acted upon by great tectonic forces; that the 
tendency of gas rather than oil to occur in areas of greater alter¬ 
ation is probably due chiefly to the lower porosity of these rocks 
and to the action of dynamic pressure on the source material, through 
the variations in the conditions of sedimentation may have been oper¬ 
ative also; and that the distribution of marine bituminous strata in 
the three geosysinclines that may be used to test the carbon-ratio 
theory shows that dynamic alteration and not conditions of sedimen¬ 
tation is chiefly responsible for the barrenness of the areas in 
which the carbon-ratios of the coals are high".

Application of Theory to West Virginia . 

Such far-reaching results have been attained by applying 
the carbon ratio in determining the boundries of possible oil pro¬ 
duction in the States that it appears to have passed the hypothetical 
stage. In applying the theory to West Virginia, Reger has prepared 
an isocarb map, based on many thousands of proximate analyses of 
coals from that state. In general, his map shows that the main oil 
fields lie where the carbon-ratio is between 55 and 60, with a few 
exceptions, such as Brook County, where the carbon ratio is 62 and 
Mingo County, where the isocarb 65 crosses the Kentucky line. Gas 
occurs in several localities on the high side of isocarb 65* Here 
again, some of the inconsistencies of the theory make their appear¬ 
ance. 

Carbon-Ratio Theory Applicable to China Coal Fields. 

That the carbon-ratio theory was applied in areas other 
than the United States may be seen from the work carried out by an 
American expedition in Northern China. The exploration was carried 
out in conjunction with the Chinese Peking Government; geological 
cross-sections were made in Western and Northern Shensi and Eastern 
Kansee, which were regarded as the post promising areas of Northern 
China for petroleum occurrences. Attempts were mace to verify all 
reported oil seepages in the areas explored. Metamorphism has been 
considerably varying in degree in different localities, best indi¬ 
cated by the carbon-ratios. At Kaiping, 100 miles east of Pekin, 
the ratio is about ?6; in the Manchurian fields to the east, the 
carbon-ratio is as high as 8?. In attempting to trace down oil 












- 75 - 


rumors, it was found that all reports referred to limited occurrences 
of oil shales* Deposits of these were found in two localities, hut in 
bothcasee the deposits appeared to be two small to have commercial 
significance* The high carbon-ratios of this region are unfavorable 
to the existence of commercial quantities of petroleum* 

Oil seepages of a permanent character have been known in 
Shensi for centuries. An attempt to verify the large number of re¬ 
ported seepages led to the discovery of 63 actual occurrences, al¬ 
though some of these were of a transient character. A well drilled 
in 1907 » immediately west of the town of Yenchang, struck oil at 
230-250 feet, with an initial yield of about 60 barrels. No coals 
are available, but the grade of oil found was the same as in Okla¬ 
homa, and corresponds to a carbon-ratio of 50 - 55 * 

The expedition covered about 20,000 miles and everywhere 
the carbon-ratio theory was applied where the presence of oil was 
investigated. 

Criticism of Carbon-Ratio Theory. 

So general has been the acceptance of the theory in circles 
concerned with petroleum geology that it is regarded as something 
like a heresy to express doubts as to its truths. Like many other 
theories which have been found useful as a working basis, the carbon- 
ratio theory sometimes fails to work out. According to G. E. Dorsey, 
the application of the theory, while generally indicating the re¬ 
lationship referred to above, occasionally produces inconsistencies, 
the chief of which are the following; (l) The problem of residues; 



4 

■ u.

- 76 - 


( 2 ) the occurrence of lower grade oil in the older and more altered 
beds than is found in the younger and lees changed strata lying 
above the older oil-yielding zone; and ( 3 ) the presence of areas 
producing only dry gas from the same zone of alteration with areas 
producing oil and oil and gas. 

This author reaches the conclusion that so far as the 
causal part of the theory is concerned, it has the same value that 
it had when first announced, namely, that of an improved assumption. 

In regard to the wide acceptance of the theory the author mentions 
a discussion thereon at a meeting of petroleum geologists which 
practically amounted to the following expressions of opinion: (l) 
that the carbon-ratio theory is so well proved that geologists need 
not fear that it will be overthrown; and (2) until a decidedly better, 
more logical and appealing theory is evolved, geologists should be 
content to accept its truth. 

It seems that the theory has been accepted on the strength 
of the large number of corroborative instances of its truth, with¬ 
out regard to the cases where it has failed. Dorsey maintains that 
the multiplication of corroborative instances does not explain the 
inconsistencies and difficulties found in the application of the 
theory. He says, in fact: M Coal, the natural hydrocarbon most 
nearly akin to those producing oil, most certainly owes its different 
groups, from lignite to anthracite, to different degrees of meta¬ 
morphism. When White and the later workers called attention to 
facts in the occurrence of oil and gas which seemed to imply some 
connection between these occurrences and stages of alteration, the 
critical faculties of geologists were dulled by the attractiveness

and simplicity of the notion. Their mental processes have been 
what as follows: Coal and oil are both natural hydrocarbons; the 
groups of the former undoubtedly are due to geophysical alterations; 
there seems to be some relationship between the groups of oil and 
the same forces; therefore, the theory that the two are actually 
due to the same forces is proved”, 

Dorsey’s arguments are given at considerable length and 
it is bejrond the scope of this thesis to have them repeated here. 
The line these take may be gathered to some extent from the very 
brief mention of some of his main points. In the first place he 
says in effect, that metamorphism which can change the character 
of the original petroleum from a heavy to a light oil implies the 
formation of heavy residues, which may even be asphalt or coke. 

The carbon-ratio theory does not explain the absence of such re¬ 
sidues, Then as to cases in which a relatively high-grade petrol¬ 
eum is found in the younger and less altered beds and lower grade 
oil in the older and more highly metamorphosed beds below, the 
author gives numerous specific examples and says that they can be 
explained by supporters of the carbon-ratio theory only by the 
action of biologicaVchemical agencies. 

The author concludes his articles by saying that the 
’’Corroboration instances are found to lose a great deal of their 
persuasiveness when the difficulties in the detailed application 
of the theory are reviewed, and these difficulties the theory is 
powerless to handle. The way out can only be had by invoking 
agencies which the theory is generally understood to make sub¬ 
ordinate. Geologists should cease to speak of the carbonwratio

theory as proved..."The commercial value of the carbon-ratio 

theory lies in the empirical fact of the realtionship itself, not 
in its causes. The question of causes ip strictly a geological 
problem, subject to the rigorous exactions of scientific methods 
for its proof. These methods, in so far as they have been applied 
to the carbon-ratio theory, have not been productive of an adequate 
proof. The status of the theory today, therefore, appears to be 
that of an improved, though dangerously pleasing assumption". 

Application of Carbon-Ratio Theory to the Coals of Alberta. 

Recently, G. S. Humes, of Ottawa, made an attempt to apply 
the carbon-ratio theory to the coal fields of Alberta. h e dray/s a 
line of comparison between the degree of metamorphism of the Alberta 
coals end those of the Appalachian basin of the United States. He 
points out that in the plains area of Alberta where the deformation 
and the attendant metamorphism of the sediments is very small, the 
coals are lignites, whereas in the mountains, where the deformities 
have been severe the coals are semi-anthracites. Sub-bituminous and 
bituminous coals occur in the intervening areas. The same general 
relationship between the quality of the coal and the degree of meta¬ 
morphism holds true for the Appalachian basin of the United States, 
where there is a progressive improvement in the quality of the coals, 
from an area of comparatively slight metamorphism to an area of 
marked deformation in the Appalachian mountain region, that is, 
from west to east. He recognizes the fact, that in the plains of 
Western Canada, the coals are of Cretaceous age which may necessitate 
some modification of the theory, but he claims that the data per-

taining to the relation of age to the metamorphism of coal is 
limited to reach a satisfactory conclusion. He says: "From the 
present evidence, however, it appears that the carbon-ratios of the 
Cretaceous coals do seem to be an index of the degree of metamor¬ 
phism, and consequently the limits set by the carbon-ratios permit 
of predicting where, other conditions favoring, oil may occur”. 

In applying the theory of carbon ratios to Alberta, the 
Analyses he used are those given by Stansfield* and others. The 
analyses are averaged for each township for which coal analyses are 
available. He calculated the carbon-ratios of all the proximate 
analyses and placed each analysis into the area to which it belonged. 
He thus obtained twenty seven areas covering the most important coal 
fields of Alberta. 

This attempt of Dr. Hume to apply the carbon-ratio theory 
to Alberta coals has led to some chemical investigations in the 
laboratories of the Scientific and Industrial Research Council of 
Alberta# 

Determination of Volatile Matter. 

Originally the determination of volatile matter was de¬ 
signed for coking coals only. The chief reason for determining 
volatile matter was to gain an idea as to the amount of coke a 
coal would render, if any at all. Later on with the increased 
use of analytical methods, the determination of volatile matter 
was also applied to all non-coking coals including lignites. It 
was found that the method applied for determining volatile matter 
in coking coals is not applicable to lignites. There are at pre¬ 
sent, therefore, two methods in existence. Briefly the methods are 
as follows:

1* Quick Heating Method . 

In this method approximately one grm. of coal is weighed 
out in a platinum crucible and heated over a flame or in a special 
electric furnace at 950 - 20°C. for seven minutes, cooled and weighed. 
The loss in weight gives the amount of volatile matter plus moisture 
present in that coal. 

This method is applicable to bituminous coals and anthra¬ 
cites but when applied to lignites the sudden evolution of their 
high volatile content causes a current of gas which mechanically 
carries off ^articles of coal. From experience it has been found 
that to coals which normally contain lees than 10^ moisture there is 
a great deal of sparking with this method, and therefore, their 
volatile matter is determined by the slow-heating method. 

2. SI 077 -Heat in g Method . 

In this method the platinum crucible is first placed on 
a cold scarifier in an electric furnace. The scarifier is used to 
prevent heating from the bottom of the crucible and thus cause 
sparking, the crucible is thus heated mostly from the top and from 
the sides. This is followed by 5 minutes of quick heating. The 
percentage of volatile matter is calculated as before. 

Experimental . 

It was desired to draw a comparison between the results 
obtained on the same coal by the two distinct methods. Knowing 
that both methods could be applied to a bituminous coal, a number 
of slow and quick heating tests were carried out on some twenty-one

quick-heating coals. The percentage of volatile matter obtained by 
slow heating was invariably lower than that obtained by quick heating. 
Table VIII, page 82 shows the results obtained. The results of the 
slow-heating were plotted against those of the quick heating and the 
curve obtained showed a constant difference of 1.2 rather than a 
proportional difference, as shown in Fig. 7 , page 83 . The carbon- 
ratios were calculated both from one quick and slow heating results. 
The curve produced from plotting these carbon ratios also showed a 
constant difference as shown in Fig. 8 , page 84. In the case of the 
volatile matter there was an increase of 1.2 from slow to quick 
heating and in the case of the carbon-ratios there was a decrease. 

Extrapolation of Results . 

From the results obtained as described above it was justi¬ 
fiable to extropulate the difference to all lignite analyses avail¬ 
able. 

Application of Results to Alberta Coals. 

This correction was subsequently applied to a great number 
of proximate analyses of Alberta coals carried out in the laboratories 
of the Scientific and Industrial Research Council of Alberta for the 
last six years. It did not affect the analyses of the bituminous 
coals, but all those of ths lignite coals were changed. As a result 
their volatile matter^increased while their carbon content de¬ 
creased and hence, their carbon-ratio was diminished accordingly. 
Calculation of Carbon-Ratios. 

The carbon-ratio in a coal is usually calculated by taking 
the percentage of "fixed” carbon of the pure coal (ash and moisture 
free) and dividing it by the sum of the fixed carbon and the volatile

e.g. Carbon-Patio = F.C. X 100. 

F.C. + V.M. 

Other Chemical Factors which may affect the Carbon-Ratio Theory. 

Besides the corrected volatile matter in lignites, two 
other chemical factors which may affect the Carbon-ratio of a coal 
are: 

1. The Mineral Matter of a Coal. 

2. The Moisture. 

1. Mineral Matter. 

The ash as determined by burning the coal and weighing the 
residue, does not represent the M mineral matter” in the coal sample, 
and usually weighs less, thus, for example, carbonates and hydrated 
minerals, which are common impurities in coal, give off carbon di¬ 
oxide and water respectively when ignited, whilst pyrites and other 
sulphur compounds suffer chemical change. S. W. Parr* gives several 
formulae of which the simplest is: 

Non-Coal = 1.08 X Ash as weighed + 2l/40 sulphur. 
The correction due to sulphur is negligible for Alberta coals, so 
that this factor becomes mineral matter * Ash X 1.08. From heavy 
solution work carried out in the laboratories of the Scientific 
and Industrial Research Council, the factor was generally higher 
than 1.08. E. Stansfield of the Scientific and Industrial Research 
has taken the approximate figure of 1.1. That is in order to get 
the percentage of mineral matter of an Alberta coal the percentage 
of ash is multiplied by 1.1. As most of the loss in weight in the 

* Jl. Ind. * Eng. Chem., Oct. 1922, p. 921. 































86 - 


mineral matter, when for example, hydrated clay or carbonates are 
burned, some change takes place giving too high a volatile matter. 

So that the same correction that is added to ash to convert it to 
mineral matter, is subtracted from the volatile matter. 

e.g. In the original analysis Ash F.C. V.M. 

m 50? 40? 

When corrected becomes 11$ 50$ 39$ 

It is probably not correct that the volatile matter should take care 
of the whole of this correction but this has been assumed by Parr 
and. others. 

2. Moisture as a Factor. 

The geologists* who have calculated the carbon ratios, 
worked mostly with bituminous coals, but it does not seem satisfactory 
to ignore the moisture present in lower grades of coals. It has been 
shown that in the analyser, of coals from certain districts the mois¬ 
ture is the same from year to year. When the moisture is driven out 
the coal disintegrates and falls to pieces, showing that moistures 
in lignites are inherent constituents of coals. It is as much a con¬ 
stituent of coal as of the plants from which coal is made. It has 
been shown that the process of metamorphism from plants to coals, 
in the early stages, is almost entirely a loss of moisture. There¬ 
fore, artificially to cut out moisture in calculating carbon ratios, 
is presupposing a jump in the degree of metamorphism. For example, 
from the analyses of two coals, one lignite and the other (classed 
at present as) sub-bituminous, the carbon ratios were calculated on 
a m.m. basis and on a m.m. gross volatile basis as follows:

Showing that if taken on the dry coal basis, Taber shows 
up to be a more metamorphosed coal than Coalspur. It is well known 
that the contrary is true. 

The above three chemical factors have been overlooked by 
all geologists who have been working on the carbon-ratio theory. The 
error of omitting the correction of the volatile matter and the eli¬ 
mination of moisture is serious when calculating carbon-ratios on 
lignite coals. For this reason G. Hume obtained higher values for 
all his carbon ratios in lignite coals. It is obvious that a carbon 
ratio of 60 in a lignite coal if corrected to the volatile matter fac¬ 
tor would become much below that, that is, instead of a ratio un¬ 
favorable for the existence of oil, a very favorable ratio is obtained. 
The following two cases compiled by Hume will illustrate 
how erroneous his conclusions are:

In his comment on the Pekisko area the author says "The Turner Valley 
oil and gas field is in township 19 and 20, rsnges 2 and 3 . The carbon 
ratios from township 20, range 3 is favorable for oil etc...." 

While with regard to Pembina area he states "the carbon-ratios in 
this area are so high that the occurrence of gas in quantity is im¬ 
possible, and oil prospects are negative". The Pekisko coals are 
bituminous and the volatile matter factor does not affect them, while 
correcting ash to mineral matter would raise the ratio although very 
slightly. The Pembina coals, on the other hand, are lignites and 
when the volatile matter factor is applied to the coal in question 
the carbon-ratio would become 58^4 instead of 60.1. If the two 
coals are then compared, the difference is very slight, that is, 
the carbonpratio of the Pekisko is 58*1 and that of the Pembina 
coal is 58.4. Both lie well within the limits of oil possibilities. 
Moreover, a ratio of 60, according to Puller's table is not negative. 
The presence of oil and gas in one area and its absence in another, 
probably influenced the author in his conclusions. 

The usual method of calculating carbon-ratios are to an 
ash basis, Stansfield's analyses (which Hume made use of) are to a 
mineral matter and moisture free basis. The author however, did 
not mention this fact and was probably under the impression that 
his carbon-ratios were calculated in the same manner as those of 
White, Fuller and others. 

Accompanying this thesis are a number of tables, based 
on a great number of Alberta coals. All available analyses for each 
township have been averaged together. Tables 55 and 555 pages IX, 
page 92 shows the proximate analyses as well as the fuel ratios and

carbon-ratios on an ash basis. In table X, page 96 . The carbon- 
ratios have been calculated as follows: 

1 . Carboneratios on ash basis. 

2 . Carbon-ratios corrected to volatile matter factor (1.2) 
ash basis. 

3 * Carbon-ratios corrected to volatile matter factor (1.2) 
m.m. basis. 

4. Carbon-ratios gross volatile corrected to volatile 
matter factor ( 1 . 2 ) m.m. basis. 

The results of the last two tables show that with the lig¬ 
nites the ratios when calculated as in (4) become very much lessthan 
the original ratios as calculated in (l) This is also true with most 
of the sub-bituminous coals which contain an appreciable amount of 
moisture. In the case of the bituminous coals there is no appreci¬ 
able difference for the following reasons: Firstly they are quick¬ 
heating coals and there is therefore, no correction for the volatile 
matter. Secondly they are very low in moisture and therefore, the 
moisture factor affects them but little if at all. 

Isocarb Map of Alberta. 

An attempt was made to plot an isocarb map of Alberta, 

Based on carbon-ratios calculated on a m.m. basis and corrected to 
volatile matter, but it was practically impossible to do so. Another 
isocarb map has since been plotted based on carbon-ratios calculated 
to gross volatile matter on the coals as mined, adjusted to a m.m. 
basis, and it was found that isocarb lines could be drawn much more 
satisfactorily. The isocarb lines seem to be erratic in the southern

part of the province while in the northern part they are more sweep¬ 
ing and seem to be parallel to the moisture lines. According to 
this map the Turner Valley lies between the lines of 50 and 55 while 
the ieocarb of the Pembina area is 45 which in this case shows a 
greater difference than with the old system. The following are the 
relations between the character of oil in eit known oil fields in 
Alberta, and the modified isocarbs found in those areas. A compari¬ 
son being made with those of Puller’s isocarbs for the same grades 
of oil:

under 50 


From the above relations of the modified ratios to the 
known oil fields it seems to be very conclusive that the carbon- 
ratios must be modified when applied to Cretaceous coals. Al¬ 
though the above modified method of calculating carbon-ratios is as 
yet insufficient, still the indications are that the moisture in 
lignite coals cannot be considered as an extraneous matter and as 
such neglected. It points out clearly, that either from the point 
of view of plotting isocarbs or their relation to known oil fields, 
the modified method is much more satisfactory than the original, 
when Cretaceous coals are dealt with. 

From the chemical nature of coal and from the above dis¬ 
cussion of formation of coal from plants it is conclusive that No.4

is the logical way of calculating carbon-ratios for all coals. Now, 
the problem that must confront the geologists is whether they are 
justified in applying ratios obtained from coals of the Carboniferous 
age to those of Cretaceous age. According to the chemical nature of 
lignites and sub-bituminous coals it may be well advisable to change 
the limits put forward by Fuller when these coals are concerned.

Conclusion 

The original calculations of White, Fuller and others 
were on bituminous coals and as far m those coals are concerned 
they are not appreciably affected by the above mentioned chemical 
factors* The geologists are not justified in applying the ratios 
of bituminous coals to those of lignites and sub-bituminous coals 
which are very appreciably affected by all the above mentioned 
factors. 

To take that Pekisko coal for example, in which a ratio 
of 57*5 becomes 54*4 when calculated to m.m. free basis. In lig¬ 
nites the ratios become still less, ranging between 31.1 to 49*5* 
From the above it is obvious that limits put forward by Fuller will 
have to be changed if the carbon-ratio theory is to be apolied to 
lignite coals* 

The writer does not intend to criticize the carbon-ratio 
theory as a whole. The theory may be very well applicable to the 
coals in the Appalachian basin and to other places where there are 
bituminous coals present, and their ratios are favorable, but when 
it is applied to the Alberta lignites and sub-bituminous coals, the 
theory does not seem to hold its own. 

Before geologists decide for themselves about the carbon- 
ratio theory it is advisable that they consult the chemist. Until 
more chemical evidence is available to support the geologist, the 
theory is raerel 3 f an assumption and as far as Alberta is concerned 
it is not applicable.
