CORRELATION OP THE ORDOVICIAN 


IN CANADA* 


a. asusii* 

1* HISTORY Off THE ORDOVICIAN . 

The Ordovician as a period of the Palaeozoic era in the geologic 

time scale has attained a position of mucn importance especially in Canadian 

geology. The name, derived from an ancient tribe called Ordovici, was first 

applied by Professor Lapworth of Birmingham University in 1879, to a group 

of rocks which included the Lower Silurian of Murchison and the Upper Cam¬ 
'S e-cLa ew/c-K'j 

brian of fe apgoT fcfe, the fauna of which were the same. The introduction of 
this new name settled the dispute and it has remained since as the name for 
the period between the Cambrian and the Silurian. 

2. EXTENT OF THE ORDOVICIAN . 

In Canada the Ordovician rocks are mainly calcareous shale and 
greenish sandstone with quantities of limestone in the east, largely lime¬ 
stone in the central regions indicating quiet deep seas, and limestone 
dominantly, with dolomite and shale in the west. Usually limestone is more 
abundant in tne Lower and Middle Ordovician, and as you proceed upward there 
is an introduction oi shale. 

The dark to black shales and greenish sandstones of the eastern 
area are peculiar to this region and may be correlated more easily with tne 
European Ordovician rather than with that of the central or western areas of 
America. Tnis indicates that a European sea containing European launa en¬ 
croach ed upon the eastern area, but an arctic sea, carrying a different type 
of fauna from tne nortn, was responsible for the deposition in tne central

and western areas, 

3. DJiiLIM1T ATIQi-iS OF THiii OBDOVICIAN . 

The Ordovician is generally conformable, hut locally unconformable, 
upon tne Cambrian. Tnis inters that tnere was no general elevation of the 
continent mass, hut only local domings at the close of the Cambrian period. 

This is well shown in the western areas, ana particularly at Held, B. C. 
where we find a complete, conformable succession from Cambrian to Ordovician. 
Schuchert has placed an unconformity between the Cambrian and Ordovician 
which he claims is due to the Green Mountain revolution, but this was possibly 
only local and did not extend beyond the Appalachian. Such a revolution is 
certainly not apparent in the Cordilleran region. The contacts above the 
Ordovician indicate a slight general unconformity. This movement at the end 
of Ordovician time has been termed the Taconic disturbance by Dana (1874). 

4. SUBDIVISIONS OF TH& OBDOVICIAN . 

The Ordovician has been subdivided on the evidence of entombed 
fossils ana also on indications of three distinct cycles of continental sub¬ 
mergence. The latter has enabled us to divide the Ordovician into three parts 
namely. Lower, Middle and Upper Ordovician. The Lower Ordovician has been 
named Canadian as proposed by Dana in 1874, because the strata and fossils of 
this region were first distinguished and described by Canadian geologists. 

This region is comparatively poor in fossils. 

The Middle Ordovician has been named Champlainian from Lake Cham¬ 
plain by New York state geologists who worked this area from 1838 to 1842. This 
period represents the largest encroachment of the sea since the commencement of 
Palaeozoic time. The seas swarmed with life as shown by the sixteen hundred 
described species of fossils found. 

The Upper Ordovician has been named Cincinnatian by Meek and Worthen

in 18oi>« The liie oi this period was similar to tnat oi the Champlainian until 
the Richmond sea came in from the Arctic and enriched the fauna* 

5* STANDARD TYPE SECTION * 

These three sections of the Ordovician ha*e been again subdivided 
into formations and groups of formations. For the sake of correlation the 
following type section has been established more or less as a standard for 
reference, and one to which all Canadian formations may he correlated. It is 
named almost exclusively from eastern areas, hut nevertheless gives some idea 
of the general succession. In correlation, formations from other areas will 
he related where possible to this standard type section.

o. LIFE OF TiiE ORDQVICIAR , 

The life of the Ordovician must have been of a very prolific type as 
shown by the fact that there have been over five thousand described species named. 
It was the time of marine inverteorate dominance. There is no great break in tne

life succession between the Cambrian and Ordovician, but an apparent general 
increase of fauna. This has been due no doubt to three factors, namely, an 
increase in the number of fossilizable forms, an increase in the number of 
individual faunas and better conditions for preservation. 

Although land flora and fishes are not abundantly preserved, yet 
since the Ordovician fauna were more complete than those of the Cambrian we 
inter there must have been more vegetal forms on which these animals could 
live. The dominance of marine invertebrates is shown in the number of brachio- 
pods, cephalopods and trilobites which were present. The brachiopods were the 
most numerous, the cephalopods the most powerful and the trilobites the most 
highly organized. The latter reached their climax in Ordovician time and began 
to decline rapidly toward the end of the period. They showed a rapid increase 
from tne Cambrian to the Ordovician. In comparison to the Cambrian trilobites, 
the Ordovician trilobites have a wider specific range, that is more species in 
the genus, more prominent and better developed eyes and a higher degree of 
ornamentation. 

The cephalopods are the most important and best developed after the 
brachiopods and trilobites. Straight forms predominate but curved and coiled 
forms are present. Orthoceras is the typical genus. Gastropods are well repre¬ 
sented by a wide variety of forms including nign spires, low spires and both 
curved and coiled forms. Pelecypods are represented but are subordinate to the 
gastropods in range and number. Brachiopods reached their maximum development 
here and are well represented in the Ordovician. The articulate forms pre¬ 
dominate, showing a decided evolution from the Cambrian in the articulatory 
processes, involving an increase in length of hinge-line, an increase in thick¬ 
ness of shell, and an increase in the development of plications. 

Bryozoa appear for the first time and become abundant and are of the

colonial type like the coral fauna.* Only traces of vermes are found as 
fossilized "burrows in the muds and sands. The record of them is indeed very 
meagre. The cystoids reach their climax in the sea lakes of the Ordovician and 
crinoids "become fairly prominent. Echinoids make their appearance for the 
iirst time. Corals are relatively few, those present being in the maun simple 
cup corals. Porifera are present but are not important. The presence of fish 
teeth indicates tne beginning of the vertebrates. With reference to plants a 
few doubtful remains have been found and also remains of certain insects, but 
these are not important. A very important invertebrate of this period is the 
graptolite which was quite plentiful and is very useful for zoning purposes. 

These forms reached their maximum development in this period. 

7* CLIMATE OP THE ORDOVICIAN . 

Little is known of the climate of the Ordovician, but it is supposed 
that it was more uniform than at the present time because low latitude fossils 
are found in high latitudes. Per instance, reef corals appear in Baffin Land, 
the Mackenzie River basin and Alaska. The accumulation of limestone and dolo¬ 
mite with an abundant and varied life indicates warm and equable waters. 

8. SEQUENCE OP DISCUSSION. 

In studying the Ordovician of Canada it has been deemed advisable 
to follow a definite order of sequence. Consequently the occurrences of Ordoviciaa 
strata have been studied in the order as they occur from east to west, starting 
with Nova Scotia, and not in the order of importance of occurrences. Conse¬ 
quently, the following areas were studied in the order given? Nova Scotia, New 
Brunswick, Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, British Columbia, North 
West Territories, Yukon and the Arctic Islands.

B. NOVA SCOTIA. 

1. GENERAL GEOLOGY OF THE MARI TIMES . 

Geologically the Appalachian region of Canada is characterized by 
a very complicated structure. The strata, chiefly of Palaeozoic age, at various 
times and over large tracts, have been greatly disturbed, traversed by many 
faults, and now lie in highly inclined positions. During earlier Palaeozoic 
times, chiefly Ordovician and Silurian, embayments of the sea spread over the 
region in question, alternately expanding and contracting, while frequently these 
bodies of water seem to have taken the form of long, wide sounds, extending in 
a general south-westerly direction, sometimes to join the great interior seas 
that flooded the central portions of the continent. In these embayments were 
deposited great volumes of sediments, which, during intervals of emergence, were 
eroded and folded and faulted, due to successive periods of activity of mountain 
building forces. As a result of the successive action of similar mountain 
building processes in the Appalachian region, there is now a pronounced general 
tendency for the different formations to occur in elongated bands, striking 
approximately north-east and south-west. 

2. THE ARISAIG-ANTIGONISH DISTRICT . 

(a) Location and extent . The Arisaig-Antigonish district of Nova Scotia 
fronts on Northumberland Strait and is situated about one-third of the way from 
Cape Breton to Pictou Harbor. The area includes ten miles of coast line, with 
Arisaig point as its centre, and extends inland south-east about eleven and a 
half miles. The approximate area of the district is one hundred and fifteen 
square miles. 

(b) Importance . The name of the district is derived from the small settle¬ 
ment along its front, whose name has long been associated with the Silurian 
formations of the vicinity. Thus its chief importance is on account of its

fossiliferous and hence well studied section of Silurian, hut nevertheless it 
contains some Ordovician strata. It also is important for its gypsum and coal 
deposits which are exploited commercially. 

(c) Structural character. The land forms of the district fall into two 
classes: a plateau (chiefly Ordovician) between eight hundred and one thousand 
feet in height, underlain by resistant igneous and folded metamorphosed rocks; 
and a rolling lowland between two hundred and four hundred feet in elevation, 
underlain by soft sedimentary formations.

(c) Correlation. As above intimated the Brownes Mountain group occupies 
the plateau areas of the district; that is, the central and western part and the 


south east corner. Its lower contact has not been observed, but it underlies 
unconformably the younger formations. The alternation of greywacke and slate 
suggests that these thick deposits were the result of a transgressing sea. The 
region is rather poor in fossils but the sandstone and iron ore furnish some 
fossils, namely Obolus (Lingulobus) spissa, Lingulella and Didymograptus nitidus. 
These and the conformable succession of the rocks, place the Brown*s Mountain

group as Lower Ordovician, the James River and Baxter's Brook formations being 
respectively Sillery and Levis in age. 

The Malignant Cove lormation rests in places unconiormably upon the 
James River slates, but in other localities is underlain in order by volcanic 
breccias, Baxter's Brook formation and tnen the James River formation. It is 
hence considered Middle Ordovician (Chazy) but this has not been establisned 
definitely. 

The region evidently opened with Lower Ordovician and a long period 
of sedimentation. As the upper James River was being laid down conditions 
occurred favorable for iron deposition and very few fossils are found in these 
beds. The' red slate and thin sandstone of the Baxter's Brook formation con¬ 
stituted the higher beds of the Lower Ordovician and probably represented shallow 
water conditions with continental sediments of oxidized sand and clean sand. This 
period was followed by folding of the strata and consequent metamorphism. Ero¬ 
sion followed closing the Lower Ordovician which was followed by the Malignant 
Cove conglomerate and grits of Middle Ordovician time, and possibly some Upper 
Ordovician. The Upper Ordovician and part of the Middle Ordovician sediments 
were later eroded and the Ordovician closed with the Taconic revolution.

1. LOCATION ASD EXTENT . 

In Rew Brunswick, Ordovician beds partly occupy the broken, hilly 
-country stretching north-easterly through the province to Chaleur Bay. In this 
region the Ordovician consist of shales and sandstones or their altered equiva¬ 
lents, often penetrated by large bodies of granite and other igneous rocks. 

The first Ordovician of New Brunswick to be considered is that around 
Dalhousie. Tnese rocks are a continuation of those of the Gaspe Peninsula and 
extend as mentioned above, across the province of New Brunswick in a south-

Tnese rocks are covered by Devonian formations making a total thick¬ 
ness in lower Palaeozoic rocks of 2,^00 feet. 

Approaching tnis area from the south we first find. Ordovician strata 


exposed along the St. John river around McAdam and Canterbury and northward. 
Prom these points there are stringers of Ordovician sediments extending north¬ 
ward to Chaleur Bay. 

The Suspension Bridge region and northward may be taken as repre¬ 
sentative of the Ordovician of this area. Here the Ordovician measures are 
largely dark shales. They are exposed in a narrow band along the northern 
shore of the St. John river below Suspension Bridge. The shales are not very 
fossilferous and contain only a few species which are common. Tetragraptus 
quadribrachiatus is the most common fossil, others being species of Didymo- 
graptus, Clonograptus and Loganograptus, besides the brachiopods, Orthis 
electra major and Strophomena atava. 

Tne Ordovician beds are overturned since they dip southward at high 
angles thus appearing to underlie the Cambrian strata. The Ordovician measures 
are the highest preserved members of an overturned syncline which includes the 
Dictyonema beds of Havy Island in the St. John river. The thin bedded, dark 
shales on Havy Island are in places extremely fossiliferous, Dictyonema

flabelliformi "being particularly abundant. Separated cranidia oi trilobites 
are not uncommon, some of tne species found here being Parabolina heres grandis, 
Parabolinella posthuma, Leptoplastus latus and Ctenopyge flagillifer. There is 
a distinct fault separating Cambrian and Ordovician sediments, the Cambrian 
being more of a gray color and thus contrasting with the black snales of the 
Ordovician. These Ordovician strata extend tnrough to Gaspe peninsula and are 
correlated with tne formations of the latter. 

3. COHRELATION . 

The Cap-au-canon and Mount Joli shales are hard to correlate due to 
the former having no fossils, and also the intense volcanic and metamorphic 
action to wnich tney have been submitted, but nevertneless are considered Lower 
Ordovician and Middle or Upper Ordovician respectively. 

The St. Jo^m group lound in tne neighborhood of St. John city is of 
special geological interest since it includes a portion of the Cambrian basin 
which has furnisned so much palaeontological material to Dr. C. F. Mattnew. He 
zoned the Cambrian according to fossils. His upper two zones Asapheilus horn- 
frayi and Dictyonema flabelliformi respectively, considered by him to be upper¬ 
most Cambrian, are now placed in the Beekmantown of the Ordovician and can be 
possibly correlated to the Levis shales thougn of a European type of fauna 
rather tnan American. Therefore we may consider the upper part of the Bretonian 
division of Dr. Matthew to be our earliest Ordovician in Hew Brunswick. The 
following is the zoning of the upper part of tne St. John group with the new 
correlation.

The outcrops of the Mt. Joli formation are of erect grey limestone and 


snale. The formation may he divided into two flanks, north and soutn. The beds 
of the nortn flank, whicn is possibly Silurian, afford admirable examples of 
ripple marks and both flanks are fossiliferous. Fossils found are Buncanella, 
Zaphrentis, Streptelasma, Pleurodictyon (corals), Monographs, Dalmanella, 

Leptaena, Stropheodonta, Spirifer niagarensis. The soutn ilank contains Ampyx, 
Tretaspis, Colymmene, Trinucleus, Pterygometopus, Ptycnopyge, Illaenus (trilobites;, 
Dalmanella, Halinescuina, Strophomena, Parastrophia and Zygospira (bmchiopods), 
the assemblage indicating a Middle or more likely an Upper Ordovician stage. 

The Cap-au-canon formation is a mass of erect, dark argillaceous and 
calcareous slates, mucn crumpled and glazed. Further landward is an isolated 
boss of limestone conglomerate which is evidently part oi tne same mass. No 
fossils have been with certainty derived from these rocks, but their age is 


probably Lower Ordovician

2. ANTICOSTI AMD MlNGjg ISLANDS . 

(a) Location ana Extent . Across from Gaspe peninsula lying to the north¬ 
east is the island oi Anticosti which exhibits remarkable Ordovician and Silurian 
strata* Anticosti island is situated at the mouth of the St* Lawrence river, 
elongated approximately east and west. The island probably consists of a part 

oi a cuesta on an ancient coastal plain which possibly began to develop in 
Devonian time. Mingan inlands to the north consist of a parallel cuesta. The 
island is important for its enormous quantity of fossil remains. 

(b) Stratigraphy . There are two systems represented on Anticosti island, 
namely Ordovician and Silurian, and the area is very fossiliferous for both 
periods. The Ordovician oi this area has been divided up by Twenhofel into 
formations of chiefly Upper Ordovician age with a little Middle Ordovician on 
Anticosti and a good section of Lower on Mingan island. The section is as 
followss -

Anticosti island, but fragments in tne shore material show its presence at 
no great deptn below the surface of tne water. It has been called the 
Macasty black shale. The rock consists of soft, highly bituminous black shale 
and contains Climacograptus spiniferus, Climacograptus magnificus, Leptobolus 
insignis, Triarthrus becki macastyensis and Orthoceras indicating an age 
corresponding to the Utica. 

The English Head formation comes next in ascending order. This 
formation is rich in fossils containing as many as 10J species. The brachiopods 
are the most numerous, both in species and individuals, with the gastropods 
vying with them in each respect. The latter have a more ancient aspect than is 
generally found in the equivalent strata, but nevertheless are associated with 
typical Richmond species. The formation is 229 feet thick. 

The English Head formation is succeeded without lithologic or 
stratigraphic break by the Charleton formation. The fauna is likewise continuous 
and typical Richmond species which are introduced in the former, become exceeding¬ 
ly abundant in the latter. The northern outcrops of the formation are by far the 
thickest, reaching 9OQ feet as compared to 730 feet in the south. The lithology 
of the latter is also different from that of the former consisting of limestone 
and shale with the limestone predominating, as compared to the south with its 
predominance of shale with much sand toward the top. Corals which occur in the 
English Head formation, here become abundant, particularly on the south side. 

Near the middle of the formation occurs the peculiar hydroid Beatricia. The com¬ 
plete fauna consists of IbO species. 

On the north shore the sandy shales of the Charleton formation give 
place without stratigraphic break to the basal sands of the Ellis Bay formation. 

On the south shore the sequence is continued with limestones and shales, the 
latter becoming more important toward the middle. Here, as in the Charleton, the 
formation is thickest in the north. The formation is considered Ordovician

though it is to be noticed that 24 of the 2b species of Charleton bryozoa 
become extinct with that formation and. that of the 22 species of Ellis Bay 
Bryozoa, 20 species are introduced with the Ellis Bay formation. Furthermore, 
the Ellis Bay bryozoa have their closest affinities with Silurian fauna. The 
fauna is the largest or any oi the island*s lormations consisting of 142 species. 
There is an abundance of coral reefs though chiefly of Silurian age. It is con¬ 
sidered chiefly uppermost Ordovician (Gamachian)in age, though the uppermost 
part of the formation may be Silurian. 

3* BIG . 

(a) South St. Lawrence Strata . After leaving Anticosti island and 
reaching the mainland of Quebec, and going westward toward Quebec and Montreal, 
again we may trace occurrences of the Ordovician right along the south bank of 
the St. Lawrence from G-aspe peninsula, through Bic, Riviere du Loup to Levis 
where there commences a considerable increase in the width of the Ordovician 
outcrops. Logan*s fault runs along the St. Lawrence separating these strata 
from the Precambrian on the north shore. Bic and Riviere du Loup are situated 
within the long extended zone of the Quebec group, which borders the south side 
of the St. Lawrence from opposite Quebec city nearly to the extremity of Gaspe 
peninsula. 

(b) Location and Extent of Bic Formations . A certain amount of prominence 
in geological literature has been given Bic Decause of the occurrence of conglo¬ 
merate strata containing, in places fossiliferous limestone peobles. Somewhat 
similar conglomerate beds occur at various horizons in the Quebec group and at 
intervals throughout the whole of the extent of the group from Levis north¬ 
eastward. These conglomerates, which are displayed so prominently at Bic, occur 
in conspicuous ridges surrounded or alternating with low-lying areas occupied 

by shales and slates.

(c) Stratigraphy and correlation. The general succession of the strata 
is stated to be as follows: - 


1* Fine-grained sandstone or quartz, grading downwards into 
2. Conglomerate and sandstone, grading downwards into 
3* Comparatively coarse conglomerate resting on

'i'nis general arrangement, it is stated, occurs at Bic, where besides 


the main band of conglomerate, other smaller bands occur. The complete succession 
here is as follows:

The fossil evidence of age is rather scanty, though as far as is known 
it is partly Cambrian but chiefly Ordovician, and the dividing line has been 
placed more or less arbitrarily between formations (4) and (3)* 


4. RIVIjBHB DU LOP? MD LEVIS . 

(a) Location and Extent . Riviere du Loup and the adjacent districts are 
situated within the belt of folded and faulted strata of debatable age that 
borders the south side of the St. Lawrence river and gulf. These measures belong 
to the somewhat vaguely defined assemblage of formations known as the Quebec 
group. The strata of tne Quebec group extend southward past Levis to the Inter¬ 
national boundary and beyond. 

(b) Lithology of Formations. The strata in the immediate vicinity of 
Riviere du Loup contains no horizon lower than a quartzite formation considered 
to underlie the Sillery and therefore is in the main Ordovician. These quartzites

were termed. Potsdam (Upper Cambrian). Though originally the formations in 
tnis area have been given three names, tney have recently been merged into 
two, namely Sillery and Levis. Some consider Sillery Cambrian, but recent 
work seems to show it to be a very early conglomerate or sandy phase of the 
encroaching Ordovician sea followed by the later shales of the Levis formation,

Interbedded black shale and light colored sandstone. 


These formations were at one time all considered to belong to the 
Sillery group but are now divided into Levis and Sillery. 

(d) Correlation . The Sillery beds are the lowest lying unconf ormably in 


most cases on the Potsdam (Upper Cambrian) formation and include the old Lauzon 
beds. They consist chiefly of conglomerates of sandstone and limestone with 
green and red shales and are correlated witn lowermost Ordovician. 

The common fossils of the Levis shales are Phyllograptus and Tetra- 
graptus. Towards Quebec a higher formation called the Quebec City formation 
has been thrust over Utica and Lorraine formations and is considered Trenton 
in age* The whole succession of Sillery, Levis and Quebec City has been so 
badly folded and faulted as to almost prevent any attempts of establishing the 


horizon,

5 . QUEBEC JUTO MOmMOKEUCY . 

Extent, The city oi Quebec lies principally upon a 
narrow and high promontory on tne north side oi the St. Lawrence. To the north 
is the Precambrian highland bordered by a narrow belt oi Ordovician sediments. 
To the south lie the steep cliffs of the Levis formations followed by Sillery 
formations. The sediments to the north rest unconforaably on the Precambrian 
and the oldest are of Trenton age and the newest of Lorraine or possibly Utica 
age. Tne promontory on which Quebec city is built consists of shales and lime¬ 
stones of Middle Trenton age and is termed the Quebec City rormation which has 
been upthrust along Logan’s fault. The strata on the south side of the river 
are Levis and Sillery ^Beekmantown) age. There is a second fault present which 
passes along the northern side of the ridge on wnich the city is situated. By 
this fault the Quebec City formation is turust over the Sillery and Lorraine. 

(b) Stratigraphy and Correlation . The formations are as follows 
correlating Quebec and Levis with Montmorency.

I. Sillerys The Sillery formation consists of red and green shales 
and lenticular masses of red and green sandstone. With exception of the little 
inarticulate brachiopods, Linarssonia pritiosa, fossils are almost entirely 
lacking. The few that have been found, species of Phyllograptus and other 
graptolites, indicate a close similarity to the fauna of the Levis. The Sillery 
also contains layers of limestone conglomerate, but the pebbles differ from the 
conglomerate of the Levis in containing Lower Cambrian fossils almost exclusively, 
although an occasional specimen has been lound wnicn indicates the Dikellocepholus

fauna. The thickness of the Sillery is unknown. 

II. Levis; Tiie Levis formation consists mostly of hard, gray, green 
and red snale, thin-bedded hard, blue and light gray limestone, and thick and 
thin beds oi limestone conglomerate. Neither the top nor bottom of the formation 
is known. About 1000 feet of the strata are exposed in the vicinity of Levis. 
l r he shales contain graptolites, chiefly Phyllograptus typus and Tetragraptus 
quadribracniatus. The limestones contain Snumardia granulosa, Phyllograptus and 
Dictyonema. The Levis is thus to be correlated with similar deposits low in the 
Ordovician in Europe and is considered Upper Beekmantown in age. 

III. Quebec City; The Quebec City formation consists oi a hard, fine¬ 
grained limestone, ver^ dark shale and thick and thin beds oi limestone conglo¬ 
merate. The shales are frequently more or less altered, but sometimes contain 
rather well preserved graptolites as Corynoides calycularis, Climacograptus 
bicomis and Cryptograptus tricomis, fossils which are indicative of mid-Trenton 
age. 'The pebbles of the conglomerate are quite fossililerous and contain such 
fossils as Pleetambonites pisum, Tretaspis diademata, Lonchodomas hastatus and 
Nidulites which indicate an age of Lower Trenton or possibly Black River. The 
thickness of the Quebec City formation is -unknown. This completes the Quebec 

and Levis formations which constitute a rather complete Lower Ordovician (Canadian) 
section and extend up into the middle period of Cnamplainian (Middle Ordovician). 

I?. Trenton; The lowest Montmorency formations are of Middle Ordo¬ 
vician age and the area includes formations from this period up to Upper Ordovi¬ 
cian (Cincinnation). The Trenton of Montmorency consists of thin-bedded, dark 
blue limestones with shaly partings. It may be divided on the basis of fossils 
into four zones which can be correlated throughout Quebec, New York and parts of 
Minnesota. The zones with their characteristic fossils are as follows; -

The total thickness of the formation is about 500 feet. 

V. Utica* The Utica is a much darker and less micaceous shale tnan 


tne Lorraine and contains besides Triarthrus becki and Leptobolus insignis, a 
considerable variety of graptolites, Climacograptus typicalis and Climacograptus 
bicornis being the more common. At the base is a small thickness of impure, 
blocky limestone. The total thickness of the Utica is about 200 feet. 

VI. Lorraine* Tne Lorraine in this vicinity is a fine, soft, gray 
shale, with thin layers of sandstone. There are occasional thicker layers of 
sand or limestone conglomerate. The thickness is at least 700 feet. Fossils 
found are Uiplograptus pristis, Triarthrus becki, Cryptolithus tessellatus, 
Plectambonites sericeus and Dalmanella testudinaria. 
b. MOM'flEAL AM) OTTAWA . 

(a) Location and Extent. The last occurrence of Ordovician in Quebec 
is a continuance of the Ordovician strata which range along the south shore of 
the St. Lawrence almost continuously from Gaspe to Georgian Bay. Continuing 
a study of these rocks, the outcrops around Montreal and Ottawa may be considered 
as characteristic of the area ranging from east of Montreal to west of Qiebec 
and though the strata extends into Ontario it will be taken up here (Ottawa) 
under the Quebec occurrences as the strata is quite continuous in this section

west trom Montreal to west of Quebec and. tnerefore snouid be studied, as a 
correlated group. 

t b ) Importance . The occurrences of Ordovician in this area are very 
important inasmuch as good sections of all the Ordovician formations may be 
seen within a radius of 20 miles of either Montreal or Ottawa. 

(c) Structural Geology . The area consists of a great expanse of low, 
nearly flat land, which borders the St. Lawrence and Ottawa rivers for 200 
miles above and below the mouth of the Ottawa river and which is underlain 
by strata of Upper Cambrian and Ordovician age. While the greater part of 
the area is covered with boulder clay or marine sands and clays of the 
Champlain transgression of Plustocene time, there are many exposures along 
and near the rivers. 

(&) Stratigraphy and Correlation . The section, a combination of out¬ 
crops around Montreal and Ottawa, with the Trenton zoned by fossils, is as

- 21 - 


I. Tneresa Beds; The lowest beds ol‘ the Ordovician, namely Theresa 
at Ottawa, will be first considered. In some parts of the Ottawa valley the 
oldest beds of the Beekmantown are composed of reworked Potsdam sand, with 
calcareous cement. These beds are therefore softer and weaker than the 
Potsdam or underlying beds. Fossils found are Ophileta complanata and Pleuro- 
tomaria canadensis. The upper part of the Theresa is a thin-bedded, gray 
dolomite, with the same fossils. The Theresa is absent from the section at 
Montreal and is thin near Ottawa, but thickens southward toward Smith's Falls 
and Brockville. 

II. Beauhamois; The Beauharnois is possibly a composite formation. 

At the typical locality along the Beauharnois canal, south-west of Montreal, 
it consists of dolomite and rather pure, blue-black limestone, with a fauna 
allied to that of the Beekmantown at Beekmantown, Few York. Some of the 
typical fossils in this region are Hormotoma hanna, Holasaphus moorei, Isoteloides 
whitfieldi, Bathyurus angelini, Ophileta complanata. Farther west in the vicinity 
of Ottawa, the strata are more sandy and there is more light gray, rusty dolomite. 
The fauna is similar to the east but is considered lower than the typical Fort 
Cassin fauna of the Lake Champlain section. 

III. Aylmer; The Aylmer formation consists of sandstone and shale in 

the greater part, the beds at the base containing in places very coarse material. 
In it are found fossils which are common to both this sandstone and the Upper 
Chazy limestone of the Champlain valley. Tne limestone in the upper part of the 
formation is well developed at Montreal but thins westward. It is a hard, fairly 
pure, thick-bedded limestone and contains numerous fossils as Camarotoechia 
plena, Camarotoechia orientalis, Malocystites murchisoni, Sigmacystis barrandei, 
Sigmacystis emmonsi, Bolboporites americanus, etc. Tne limestone is extensively 
quarried around Montreal.

IV. Pamelia: The limestone of the Aylmer (Cnazy) wnich tnins toward 

Ottawa is succeeded in that vicinity by a formation consisting chiefly of 
limestone but snaly and sandy in its lower portion, and named the Pamelia 
formation. The lower portion (shale and sand) contains the fauna Beyrichia 
clavigera, Bathyurus acutus and Helicotoma whiteavsiana. In the upper part 
(limestone) are found Isochilina armata, Seperditia fabulites, Batnyurus 
superbus, Tetradium, etc. Botn horizons snow faunal relations to the Black 
River. The formation thins to the eastward* 

V* Lowville? The Lowville is a tnin formation consisting mostly 
of bull, fine-grained, rather pure limestone with an occasional shaly bed. 

It is characterized by Tetradium cellulosum and also contains Batnyurus 
extans. Though only 13 to 30 feet thick the formation is persistant, but 
is absent at Joliette to the north-east of Montreal. 

VI. Black River? The Black River is another thin formation, con¬ 
sisting of thick beds of rather impure, gray to black limestone. The fauna 
is large, the characteristic species being Columnaria halli, Hormoceras 
tenuirilum, Bumastus milleri, Dalmanella gibbosa and Strophomena filitexta. 

The formation may be correlated with the Leroy of New York, in having an 
abundance of flat, disc-shaped masses of black cnert and also from fossils. 

It is from jO to 40 feet thick. 

Montreal. The next nine formations are all included in the Trenton 
horizon. The Trenton at Montreal and at Ottawa differ greatly. Montreal 
appears to have the oldest formations, but it is hard to establish tne corre¬ 
lation. 

VII. Parastrophia and Trinucleus Beds. At Montreal the lower part of 
the Trenton is well exposed but the upper formations are scarce. All the 
strata here are rather thin-bedded, blue-black limestones ana the lowest beds

contain tne fauna, witn Parastrophia hemiplicata, and consequently tne group 
oi beds are called Parastrophia beds. TJbey are about 40 feet thick and are 
overlain by about 50 feet of limestone containing Trinucleus concentricus, 
Triplecia nuclea, Trematis terminal!s and other fossils, the group of beds 
being named Trinticleus beds irom the abundance of the lirst named fossil. 

VIII. Dalmanella Beds: The Dalmanella beds are thin-bedded, pure, blue- 

black limestone, characterized by Orthis tricenaria, etc. They have an esti¬ 
mated thickness ox 40 feet but are poorly exposed at Ottawa. 

IX. Prasopora Beds? The Montreal exposed section ceases witn the lower 
part oi the Prasopora beds which come next stratigraphically. They are very 
thin-bedded limestones, with thick shale partings, characterized by abundant 
Xange bryozoans of the genus Prosopora. The bed has wide distribution and 
contains well preserved fossils. The strata of this zone which reaches a 
thickness of feet is extensively quarried. 

Ottawa - Dalmanella Beds. At Ottawa tne lowest zone is tne Dal¬ 
manella beds which have already been described. 

X. Crinoid Beds. They are followed by tne Crinoid beds oi thick and 
thin-bedded, blue limestone, with a large amount of chert, which are well 
shown at Hull and furnish building stone for Ottawa. The upper layers of the 
beds are abundant in Crinoids. The thickness of these beds is about b5 feet. 

XI. Tetradium and Prasopora Beds. The Tetradium beds follow with 35 
feet of massive, coarse-grained, blue-gray limestones with tew lossils, which 
are also quarried near Ottawa. The common fossil is a species of Tetradium 
very liite Tetradium cellulosum. The Prasopora beds follow in the Ottawa dis¬ 
trict, but have already been described under the Montreal section. 

XII. Cystid Beds. Then follows the Cystid beds consisting of rather thm- 
bedded, light-gray limestone with thin shale partings. The thickness is about

75 feet and. tne lower zones contain Pleurocystites and Agelacrinites. 

XIII. Sponge Beds: The Sponge beds follow in the Ottawa section. They 

are heavy-bedded, tine-grained limestones with clay irregularly distributed 
through it. The thickness is about 75 feet and the characteristic fauna contained 
in the strata are Hormotoma trentonensis, Ratinesquina deltoidea and Cyclospira 
bisulcata. 

XIV. Collingwood. The Collingwood succeeds the Sponge beds completing 
the Trenton in the Ottawa section. This formation is not found at Montreal. 

The formation is 25 to 150 feet thick characterized chiefly by Ogygites canaden¬ 
sis and also containing Triplecia, Oxyplecia calnouni, Schizambon canadensis, 
Dalmanella emacerata, Leptobolus insignis, Zygospira modesta, Triartnrus becki. 

In litnology the Collingwood represents a sort of transition between tne Trenton 
and the Utica as it consists of alternating beds 01 limestone and snale, each 

a foot or so in thicioiess. Though tormerly considered as part of the Utica by 
Raymond it is now classed as uppermost Trenton. 

XV. Utica. At Ottawa tne Utica follows the Collingwood whereas at Mon¬ 
treal it follows the Prasopora beds of the Trenton. It consists of 200 to JOQ 
feet of thin-bedded, fine-grained, brown and black, carbonaceous shale, with a 
small fauna of chiefly graptolites. Clirnacograptus typicalis, Climacograptus 
bicornis, Diplograptus pristis, Leptobolus insignis and Triarthrus becki are 
common, and Triarthrus spinosus and Triarthrus glaber are also found near Ottawa. 

XVI. Lorraine; Exposures of the Lorraine and Ricnmond are few. The former 
consists of sandstone and shale in thin layers, and contains numerous, thin, 
calcareous bands. The common and characteristic fossils are Catazyga erratica, 
Byssonychia radiata, Pterinea demissa, Cyrtolites oraatus, and Isotelus maximus. 

XVII. Richmond; The Richmond consists of shales and sandstones, the most 
common fossil being Catazyga headi.

7. CALUMET ISLAND . 

( a ) Location and Extent. The last occurrence of Ordovician (in Quebec) 
to be studied is an outlier to the north-west of Ottawa along the Ottawa river. 
It is represented by the strata of Calumet Island. This Island is situated in 
tne Ottawa river about 58 miles north-west of Ottawa. The district is a farming 
country though it also has deposits of zinc of some importance. 

( b ) .Structural Geology . The island is mainly underlain by Precambrian 
rocks consisting of three main types, limestones, amphibolites and granites. In 
the north-west part of the island is a small area floored with horizontal Ordo¬ 
vician sediments; sandstones, shales and dolomites. The Precambrian sediments 
are cut by sills and dikes and folded and metamorphosed. Then, apparently, has 
ensued a period of erosion during which the region was worn fairly low. This 
was followed by deposition, by the Ordovician sea, of the Chazy grits, sand¬ 
stones and dolomitic shales. These were later submitted to extensive erosion 
leaving only one small patch in the north part of the island. 

(c) Stratigraphy . The section is as follows; -

(d) Correlation . This series lies unconformably on the Precambrian and 
is overlain by Quaternary sediments of gravel, sand and boulder clay. Much of 
it is concealed by sand and swamps. It is considered an outlier of Alumette 


Island to the north, which is wholly of this age (Chazy). 

The basal bed is a coarse, gritty sandstone, which upward becomes 
shaly. It is overlain by a very fine-grained, bluish gray, slightly quartzitic 
dolomite and this by a finely laminated quartzitic shale which has been ascribed 
to the Chazy.

8. SUBDIVISION Q-b* THE TRENTON: RAYMOND . 

Before leaving the Ordovician of Quebec to commence that of Ontario, 
a statement oi the subdivisions ot the Trenton may "be considered. The Trenton, 
much discussed, in the preceeding areas of Montreal and Ottawa has been sub¬ 
divided "by Raymond, and tor the purpose of reference in correlation may be 
tabulated below. In this table the Utica is not considered as a separate unit, 
but as a shaly phase of the Trenton. A Trenton formation is included as a sub¬ 
division of the Trenton group and considered as "Trenton proper". This is not 
good as it causes confusion in the two terms. The table, correlating Quebec, 
Ontario and New York, and also the zonal names, is as follows; -

U. ONTARIO, 

1. OENSRAL DISCUSSION Of ONTARIO ORDOVICIAN . 

After leaving the Quebec Ordovician rocks which extend westward past 

Montreal and Ottawa well into Ontario, we pass on to the Ontario peninsula. There 

is a break, consisting of Precambrian rocks between the Quebec formations and 

those of the Ontario peninsula. Probably the Ordovician sediments were continuous 

at one time, but have been eroded down to the Precambrian in this small area giving 

rise to a discontinuance of Ordovician strata. The Ontario Ordovician is charac¬ 
teristic around Trenton, N. Y. t which gives its name to the great limestone

formations ol the Middle Ordovician (Chanrplainian). Tne outcrops extend in 
a more or less triangular shaped mass extending longitudinally between Georgian 
Bay and Lake Ontario. Tne same lormations extend farther to the westward, out¬ 
cropping on Manitoulan Island and around Sault Ste. Marie, but the majority of 
the strata has been either eroded or is buried beneath the waters oi the Great 
Lakes. 

2. MMITOULAU ISLAND . 

(a) Location and Extent . Manitoulan Island represents tne western and 
northern extremity of the Ordovician strata, which have stretched irom Gaspe 
peninsula, along the south shore of the St. Lawrence, through Quebec and into 
the Ontario peninsula. The Ordovician strata constitutes the northern portion 
of the island and outcrops along the shore. Much of the island is of Precam- 
brian rocks on which the. Ordovician sediments rest unconiormably.

IV. Stromatocerium Horizon; Overlying the Curdsville limestone is one in 
which Stromatocerium is abundant and this limestone horizon is called the Stroma- 
tocerium horizon. 

V. Prasopora simulatrix Horizon; A higher Trenton strata is composed of 
an argillaceous limestone containing Prasopora simulatrix and Tetradium in 
abundance along with other bryozoans. It may be correlated with tne Nematopora 
beds or upper Prosser of Minnesota. 

VI. Collingwood and Utica; These limestone beds are followed by the 
black shales oi tne Collingwood and Utica which are practically continuous litho¬ 
logically and palaeontologically and quite conformable. Tne Collingwood shales 
at the base are interoedded with limestone similar iitnologically to the Trenton 
limestone beneath, indicating a retrogression oi tne Trenton sea, at tne close 

oi Trenton time. This strata was iormerly considered as a phase oi the Utica 
but is now included as uppermost Trenton, since it contains such fossils as 
Ozygites canadensis and Triarthrus fischeri. In some places the Collingwood 
shales are overlain by the softer clay shales which are considered Utica in age.

are seen lor nearly two miles south of Clay Cliffs along the shore line of 
Manitoulin Island, Here, clay shales are interbedded with line grained 
siliceous limestones, some of which weather to a brownish rock resembling fine¬ 
grained sandstone. This rock frequently contains an abundant pelecypod fauna 
including Byssonychia radiata, Cleidophorus planulatus, Ctenodonta pectunculoides, 
Lydrodesma poststriatum, Modiolopsis concentrica and Whiteavesia pholadiiormis. 
Along with these pelecypods, the presence of Diplograptus augustifolius 
vespertinus correlates the area to the Middle Lorraine of New York and the 
standard type section. 

VIII. Lower Richmondj The Lower Richmond is exhibited as a type 
locality at Clay Cliffs. Much of the area of the steep cliffs is covered with 
talus and thus is hard to determine, but nevertheless the thickness of the section 
is estimated at 40 feet. A Stromatocerium reef occurs at 30 feet below the top 

of the cliff. Hebertella insculpta demarcates the base of the Lower Richmond of 
this section. Many brachiopods occur below the St ronmito cerium reef and some 
brachiopods, corals and pelecypods range right through the formation. 

IX. Middle Richmond? The Middle Richmond includes the 30 feet oi strata 
above the Stromatocerium reef. The general type of fauna mentioned above for 
this section are characterized by Beatrices undulata, Liospira helena, Bucania 
and Bellerophon. At Manitowaning a Stromatocerium horizon occurs far above any 
of the levels at which Beatrices has been found. This Manitowaning Stromato¬ 
cerium reef limits the top of the Middle Richmond. 

X. Uppermost Richmond or Gsmachian; In the vicinity of Kagowong this 
reef is overlain by a horizon rich in silicified pelecypods including Cyrtodonta 
ponderosa, Ctenodonta iphigenia, Ortonella hainesi, Leperditia caecigena and 
Primitia lativia. The significant feature of this ostracod fauna with its 
associated pelecypod fauna, is that it may be correlated with that of the 




- 30 - 


Queenston shale of New York as exposed on the south shores of Lake Huron 
between Collingwood and Owen Sound. Just as the Upper Ordovician (Cincinna- 
tion) is well exposed at Clay Cliffs, so is the Middle Ordovician (Champlainian) 
at Little Current to the north-east of Manitoulin Island. 

3. ONTARIO PENINSULA. 

^ a ) Location and Extent . The Ordovician strata outcrops all along the 

north shore of Lake Ontario and along the south-east extremity of Georgian Bay 
and is continuous between these two points surrounding Lake Simcoe and extending 
north to meet the Precambrian Shield. The strata is existant on the south side 
ot Lake Ontario but is here buried by Silurian and Devonian measures. 

("b) Lake Simcoe . As we come south and east to Lake Simcoe, limestone 

is found in the outcrops of Black Hiver and Trenton age showing a drop in the 
strata from the Richmond (Upper Ordovician or Cincinnatian) to the Champlainian 
(Middle Ordovician). The greater portion of the area of the Lake Simcoe dis¬ 
trict is underlain by limestones of the Trenton and Lowville (Black River) 
formations, the last of which rests unconrormably on the Precambrian showing 
that the Canadian or Beekmantown (Lower Ordovician) sea did not reach this area. 
The limestone dips gently towards the south-west and have an estimated thick¬ 
ness of 330 feet. 

I. Stratigraphy? Around Orillia, at the northern extremity of Lake Simcoe 
the Trenton is underlain by a rather good section of the Lowville (Black River) 
and possibly some Chazy, which exhibits many outcrops of limestone and is sub¬ 
divided into three parts namely: -

II. Correlation; Tne lower part of the basal series consists of a 

few feet of coarse, calcareous sandstone or arkose, wnich rests unconiormably 
on the Precambrian. These beds pass upward into red and green shale with 
intercalated lenses of thin beds of sandstone and occasionally thin beds of 
fine-grained, dove-colored limestone. These beds evidently served as tillers 
in the hollows of the old Precambrian surface as they are not on the tops of 
ridges or domes of the crystalline Precambrian rocks, but in such places the 
limestone is laid down unconformably without the basal beds. This formation 
may be correlated as a phase of the Chazy. 

The first beds of the Lower Lowville consist of impure magnesium 
limestones which on fresh fracture are greenish-gray in color and weather 
yellowish-brown. They are usually barren of fossils but are followed by six 
to ten feet of fossiliferous blue-gray limestones characterized by an abun¬ 
dance of beatricea. The important fauna contained consists of Rafinesquina 
minnesotensis, Zygospira recurvirostris, Cyrodonta huronensis, Lophospira 
bic&neta, Isotelus gigas and Tetradium holysitoides. These beds are followed 
by seven to ten feet of unfossiliferous magnesium limestone similar to tne 
basal beds of this formation. 

The Upper Lowville is about 20 feet in thickness and composed of 
fine-grained, even-bedded, dove-colored limestone, characterized bjc such 
fossils as Phytopsis tubulosum, Batnyurus extans, Leperditia fabulixes, and in 
the upper portion by a great abundance of Tetradium cellulosum. 

(c) Collingwood. I. Location and extent; The next representative 

of the Ordovician in the Ontario peninsula, going south and ascending strati- 
grapnically, will be taken at Collingwood which has given its name to one of 
the subdivisions of the Trenton. Here an almost complete section of Middle 
( Cnamplainian) and Upper Ordovician (Cincinnation) is found in the following 
formations, given in ascending order; Black River (Lowville), Trenton (Trenton

the upper formations are represented better on Manitoulin Island to the west.

The Trenton limestone (Horaotoma zone) has little vertical extent 
but is rich in fossils characteristic of the upper zones of the Trenton. 

The Collingwood formation rests directly on Trenton limestone and 


is a series oi thin-bedded limestone and darh, bituminous shale which is charac¬ 
terized more particularly by the presence of Ogygites canadensis. 

The Utica overlies the Collingwood and consists of a series of 
snale beds. The common fossils are D a lmanella testudinaria, Leptobolus insignis, 
Plectambonites sericeus, Rafinesquina alternata, Endoeeras proteilorme, Calymene 
callicephala, Triarthras spinosus and Trinucleus concentricus. 

The Dundas (Lorraine) snale is not exposed at this point but fossils 
can be obtained from the talus. 

The Richmond gray shales and limestones are also not exposed and 
these higher Ordovician strata, may be better studied with the Manitoulin Island 
as Collingwood has Middle Ordovician (Champlainian) typically developed rather 
than Upper Ordovician (Cincinnatian).

4. TIMISKAKING. 

( a ) Location and Extent . The last area of Ordovician in Ontario and 

Quebec is the Palaeozoic outlier oi Lake Timiskaming. The area lies pa,rtly in 
each province 'hut the Ordovician strata (Liskeard formation) is cnietly comined 
to Ontario and thus it is included under this province. 

The Palaeozoic areas of Lake Timiskaming lie well within the borders 
of the Precambrian shield and have been known since 1S42. The area is oi tne 
extent of 2^j0 square miles and extends from the towns of Hailey bury and New

Liskeard northward. The Ordovician rocks are found along the western and 
northern shores of the lake and extend in a north by northwesterly direction 
with conglomerates and sandstones on the west shore* 

(b) Importance . This area of limestone rocks has become commercially 
important since it furnishes lime, building stone and carbonate, the last 
used in the pulp and paper industry. It is also geologically important 
since it gives evidence oi the wine extent oi tne early Palaeozoic seas and 
furnishes evidence not only showing the former sea connections to the south 
and north, but also gives a means of dating fairly precisely the later 
fracturing and faulting movements which have an important bearing on mineral 
deposits in this general region. 

(c) Structural Geology . The area consists oi a trench or valley termed 
the Timiskaming teench, protected on all sides by Precamorian rocks. This 
structure has caused tne preservation of the Palaeozoic sediments wnicn else¬ 
where in this region must have been eroded, as with the exception of this 
small pocket, the remainder of the rocks of the surrounding district are 
essentially Precambrian. 

(d) Stratigraphy * The Ordovician oi the area rests unconiormably 
upon tne Precambrian and includes a considerable thickness of rocks of 
Trenton age. Since the Trenton includes a varying series of formations, 
the formation of rocks of this age in the region has been given a new name 
the Liskeard formation. It is possible that the Black River and Richmond 
may be present as well. The basal Palaeozoic conglomerate and sandstone on 
the eastern shore are of Trenton age whereas on the west Side, below the 
sandstone, there is 50 feet of red clay and shale which may possibly be 







Black River but is now included in tne Liskeard formation. T&e distribution 
ol outcrops brought about by faulting has made it impossible to tell what 
comes immediately above the Liskeard formation. The relationships are such, 
that between the highest known rocks ol the Liskeard formation and those of 
Lower Silurian, an interval of 40 feet occurs that is entirely covered, mostly 
by post-glacial materials. Richmond may be present in tnis interval since the 
Richmond sea was quite widespread. Nevertheless tne Liskeard formation has been 
made to include all the known Ordovician rocks of the area. 

The Palaeozoic floor appears to have been very irregular when tne 
Trenton seas advanced over it. The contact of tne Liskeard formation with the 
old Precambrian is very irregular. The thickness of the section ranges from 
20 to 250 feet. The following is a section compiled from diamond drill core 
from lot 11 and supplemented to complete.

F. MANITOBA. 

1. GENERAL DISCUSSION OF MANITOBA ORDOVICIAN * 

The Ordovician in Manitoba is represented by two quite large and widely 
separated areas. Evidently the seas of Ordovician time came up from Minnesota 
and the Gulf of Mexico and deposited sediments, commencing, as far as Canadian 
occurrences go, at the International boundary and extending on northward past 
Winnipeg, along the western shore of Lake Winnipeg, past the Hudson*s Bay railway 
and beyond the Pas. Here an abrupt turn to the west is made and the area extends 
on past Lake Anisic to Lakes Wapawekka and Deschambault where it terminates and 
gives place to Silurian and Devonian formations. This iorms the Winnipeg and 
Lake Manitoba area* 

The second area is a northern outlier which really commences in northern 
Ontario, along tne head waters of some of the northern tributaries of the Severn

river, quickly passing west into northern Manitoba though not reaching the 
shores of Hudson's Bay. It crosses the Shamattawa and Hayes reaching the 
Nelson river, where it turns abruptly north reaching the Churchhill river 
which it follows northward terminating at cape Churchhill on the shores of 
Hudson's Bay. Both these areas represent the Middle Ordovician (Champlain ian) 
period and the majority of the formations can be correlated as Trenton. 

In Manitoba the Ordovician is comprised oi the following formations.

2. WINNIPEG 1 AND LAKE MANITOBA REGION. 


The divisions or the Trenton here indicated are made chiefly on physical 
grounds. The exposures are best seen on Lake Winnipeg and these may be taken 
as characteristic of the formation which stretches from the International boundary 
to the north. No deposits of this age occur in the outer ranges of the Rocky 
Mountains. 

(a) Lake Manitoba . The Winnipeg sandstone has a few exposures in tne 
Ordovician outcron on Lake Winnipeg and to the northwest. The sandstone varies 
in thickness from 100 feet to zero, the thickness depending to a great degree 
on the unequalities of the floor. In many exposures, particularly toward the 
north, the sandstone is absent, and limestones of Lower Mottled age are seen to 
rest directly upon the Precambrian floor. Tne formation is an unconsolidated or 


























- 38 - 


partially consolidated, sand, occasionally deeply stained by iron but otherwise 
practically pure silica, frequently showing cross-bedding, but nowhere a con¬ 
glomerate base* The sandstone grades upwards into a more argillaceous phase, 
with clayey partings containing fossils and is correlated as a phase of the 
Black River. 

The exposures of rocks of Trenton age in this area are best seen on 
Lake Winnipeg. Here there are three divisions an (A,) upper mottled limestone, 
which, as the name indicates, is a peculiarly patchy or mottled variety of 
limestone and very characteristic of the region. It has a thickness of 1^0 
feet. It conformably overlies the (B) Cat Head formation which is 70 feet 
thick. This formation divides the upper mottled limestone from the (C) lower 
mottled limestone which is the next formation. It is quarried extensively 
for building stone and is known commercially as the Tyndall limestone. It is 
70 feet thick. All three formations are usually correlated with the Trenton 
although the last named may be Black River. 

(b) Stony Mountain . The Ordovician of Stony Mountain may be taken as a 
representation of the strata of this age (Richmond) throughout the area. 

I. Location and Extent* Stony Mountain lies to the north-west of 
Winnipeg and is the only elevation oi strata on the flat lacustral plain. 
Magnesium limestones are quarried in this area and are of Upper Ordovician 
(Cincinnatian) age. 

II. Stratigraphy* The Stony Mountain formation is composed of three main 
divisions namely, descending stratigraphically: (A) an upper magnesium member 
about 12 feet thick in which the quarries are located and whicn contains a 
very meagre fauna including several Beatricias, together with brachiopods and 
several corals; (B) a middle member about 15 feet thick consisting for the 
most part of a massive, yellow, brick-like shale which is almost filled in

places with the casts and moulds oi corals, bryozoans, bracniopods, pelecypods, 
gastropods, cephalopods and trilobites; and (C) an exposed thickness oi 12 
feet of alternating thin limestone bands and red shale, the limestone layers 
bearing upon their weathered surfaces an even greater assemblage of fossils 
than were mentioned for the middle member, Tne launa includes Favosites aapeia, 
Cyathophyllum, Platystrophia biforata var. lynx and Rhyncnotrema copax indicating 
a Richmond or Lorraine horizon. The interlaminated shale crumbles readily and 
specimens of corals, brachiopods and bryozoans can be picked up from its 
weathered slopes. 

III. Correlation* Tne whole area is probably underlain by Trenton limestone, 
but no beds lower than Lorraine age are exposed. The complete exposure totals 
a thickness of 110 feet. The section is correlated as follows:

(c) FIin Flon . Passing on northward and following Ordovician outcrops we 
reach the Flimlon mining area which marks the last appearance of this stretch of 
Ordovician in Manitoba. At this point the strata swing westward across the bor¬ 
der to terminate in Saskatchewan and this last part oi tne continuous stretch 
of Ordovician from the International boundary into Saskatchewan will be discussed 
under the Lakes Wapawekka and Deschambault areas of Saskatchewan. 

I. Location and Extents Tne Flinflon district lies in Northern Manitoba 
and Saskatchewan along the provincial boundary line. Since 1913 the mineral belt 
of this area north of the Pas, has attracted considerable attention. This area 
has produced an important mine, the Mandy, and others are being commenced. This 

district though chiefly Precambrian, also contains some Palaeozoic strata, and

and tne only member present is that of the Ordovician. 

II. Structural Geology; The area lies witnin tne Precambrian shield 
near its southern margin, close to that other great physiographic division, 
the Great Plains. Its topographic features are typical ol the Precambrian 
plateau in general. By early Palaeozoic time, the tilted, folded and intruded 
Precamorian rocks had been eroded to a low relief and the successive advances 
of the Palaeozoic seas gradually encroached upon them. This is shown by the 
low gradient at the base of the Palaeozoic sediments. There were possibly 
more Palaeozoic sediments laid down than are now existant as much erosion took 
place after the Palaeozoic era. 

III. Stratigraphy and correlation; There is only one formation, as yet 
not well difterentiated, shown as follows; -

Six miles south of the Plinflon map area the Precambrian rocks are overlain 
by Ordovician dolomite. The edge of these Palaeozoic sediments is an escarpe- 
ment facing north. There is commonly an abrupt rise from tne Precambrian rocks 
to the top of the flat-lying dolomite. A few erratics of Ordovician dolomite 
in tne Flinilon area show that in Pleistocene time outliers of Ordovician age 
must have existed north of the area since the glacial advance was from the 
nortn-east. Two small outcrops were observed in the area itself. Both of these 
occur on Scnist Lake on the big island just south of the Mandy mine. They are 
flat-lying and fossiliferous, and are clearly in place. They show that at one 
time the Palaeozoic mantle extended much farther north than it does now. The 
area may be correlated with the Trenton.

3 . HUDSON 1 S BAY REGION . 

( a ) Location and Extent* The position of the Ordovician rocks in the 
Hudson's Bay region has already been described. The strata outcrop in a broad, 
roughly concentric belt that is bounded on tne west by Precambrien crystallines 
and on the east by Silurian strata whicn lap on tnem or in places transgress 
tnem in a westward direction* There are evidently occurrences of Ordovician 
strata iarther soutn in the vicinity oi the Kenogamic river, a soutnern branch 
oi the Albany, according to Wilson, but this area is not established. Then 
again the Ordovician sea evidently spread away to the nortnward as Schucnert 
claims that irom the iossils collected near the head of Frobisher Bay he has 
evidence that this Ordovician strata of the Hudson's Bay region extends as far 
north as Baffin Land* 

( d) Stratigraphy * The area taken for a type section of the Ordovician 
region west of Hudson's Bay is found along tne Nelson and Shammattawa rivers 
which give their names to the formations. The Ordovician strata is overlain 
unconformably oy Silurian strata. 

The sections taken irom both the Nelson and tne Shammattawa rivers are

Correlation,. I* Nelson River; The lowest formation of the area 
is the Nelson River limestone. The lowest (7) layers ot this group consist 
of sandy, bluish-gray dolomite and contain Recentaculites oweni. Above lie 
twoUb) and (3)) formations of gray limestone mottled with brownish dolomite 
which contain Receptaculites oweni, Hormotoma winnipegensis and Maclurina 
manitobensis. Tnese are followed by tne (4) uppermost, gray, non-dolomitic 
limestones which weather into thin irregular layers and also contain Recepta¬ 
culites oweni. Tne formation is correlated with tne Trenton. 

IX. Snammattawa: The Snammattawa limestone is the upper formation but 
the contact between it and the Nelson River is not evident. It is divided into 
three formations as shown in the above section. The Snammattawa limestone is 
thought to represent Richmond time and can be correlated with Stony Mountain 
(Richmond). The (3) lowest beds are oi gray, thin-bedded limestone, overlain 
by (2) brown, fine-grained, thin-bedded dolomite. The surfaces of the layers 
of dolomite are rich in fossils all characteristic oi Richmond age. This forma¬ 
tion is overlain by (1) gray and yellowish-gray, thin-bedded limestone containing 
Isotelus and other species of fossils characteristic of Richmond time. The 
following table estaolishes the correlation of these formations (Nelson River 
and Shammattawa) to adjacent areas.

above are thought to indicate tne age oi tne strata from which they came as 
Trenton. This formation is found, chiefly on the Nelson river though it does 
occur on the Shammattawa. The Nelson river exhibits the best sequence of both 
formations. 

IV. Fossils of Shammatawa; Some ox the more common fossils from the 
Shammattawa limestone are Strophomena fluctuosa, Rafinesquina alternata, 
Rhynchotrema capax, Dinorthis subquadrata, Streptelasma latuscula, Columnaria 
alveolata, Calapoecia canadensis, Palaeofavosites asper, Halysites gracilis 
and. T r ochonema umbilicatum. The above fossils indicate the Ricnmond age of 
the strata from which they came. 

The fauna ox the region may be correlated with that oi Wyoming, Colorado, 
Lake Winnipeg and Baffin Land indicating that these regions with the Hudson's 
Bay region were deposited in the same marine province or basin of deposition 
wnich was doubtless connected at the north with the Arctic ocean. This sea 
evidently extended down from the Arctic as far as Mexico but did not spread 
eastward to meet the Gulf invasion where the fauna of this period is somewnat 
difxerent. 

G. SASKATCHEWAN. 

1. WAPAWEhKA AND DlSCHAMBAULf AREA . 

Continuing the Ordovician area which stretches north from the Inter¬ 
national boundary through Manitoba and then west from the Flint ion area, the 
strata extends into Saskatchewan. This is the only occurrence of Ordovician 
rocks in Saskatchewan and they are entirely lacking in Alberta. 

(a) Location and Extent . Tne Wapawekka-Deschambault Lakes area lies in 
the northern part of the drainage basin of the Saskatchewan river. The area is 
not of great importance economically except for a bed of lignite and some oil 


shale

n (*) Structural Geology, Precambrian rocks underlie the greater part 
of the area and this part snows tne characteristics oi tne Precambrian Shield, 
namely, an abundance of lakes and a low relief with a very rugged surface* 
Plat-lying limestones of Ordovician age underlie a small area in the south¬ 
east part of the district* Here the suriace is comparatively flat and even, 
depressions are shallow and lakes are few. Some parts of this area are drift 
covered. These limestones form abrupt escarpments along some of the rivers 
and lakes. 

(c) Stratigraphy * Tne data available does not permit of' the subdivision 
of the Ordovician formations but points to an orderly sequence of deposition. 
The formation is classified as follows; 


Period 

Correlation 

Description 

Middle Ordovician 


Dolomitic limestone 

(Champlainian) 

Trenton 

Basal sandstone 


(&) Correlation . Much or the Ordovician boundaries cannot be determined 
on account of overlying drift and swamp. These Ordovician beds are the only 
representatives of the Palaeozoic in the area. The best exposures of limestone 
appear in escarpments on the east and west sides of Bigstone and Limestone lakes. 
.Another escarpment is on the north-east shore of Ballantyne Bay and shows the 
basal sandstone member. The sandstone is particularly friable due to a very 
small amount of cementing material. It consists almost entirely of pure white 
quartz sand, the larger grains of which are well rounded, the small angular to 
subangular. There are no fossils present. The Precambrian sediments were metar» 
morpnosed, weathered and eroded before the Ordovician sea came in, but tnere 
were some irregularities in the Precambrian suriace snown by the varying thick¬ 
ness of the basal sandstone. 

The Ordovician limestone resembles tne typical dolomites of similar age

wiiicn are exposed in many parts of eastern Saskatchewan and Manitoba. 

It has a well developed bedding. The beds are commonly tnin, most of them 
only a few incnes, but a lew reach a thickness ot two or three feet. The rock 
is typically solid and non-porous. A crude mottling of yellowish-brown is 
commonly apparent. The limestone has been largely dolomitized and recrystailiaed. 
No well preserved fossils are present thougn Keceptoculites oweni and some other 
indistinct corals are apparent. 

H. BE I Till COLUMBIA. 

I. GKNMAL DISCUSSION Ok B. C. ORDOVICIAN . 

The Ordovician sediments in British Columbia have not yet been well 
studied. Up until quite recently the Palaeozoic sediments of this province 
have not been considered to include much, if any, of the Ordovician period. 

Lately it has been established that at least one formation formerly included in 
the Cambrian is now partly at least Ordovician. This formation is the Goodsir 
shale formation of Mount Coodsir, the upper part of which is now considered as 
Ordovician (Beekmantown), though in the main Upper Cambrian. When the area 
has been fully worked out we may find a fairly complete section of the Ordovician 
in the region. The area may be considered to include two areas namely Banff and 
the Kootenay districts. The first occurrences of Ordovician are found in the 
Banff area and as one travels west into tne Kootenay district the strata rises 
and ends with Upper Ordovician strata ^Richmond). 

2. BANfF ABM. AND MOUNT GOOD SIB . 

(a) Location and Extent . Ordovician strata are represented at the railway 
section only within the limits of the Rocky Mountains and the floor of the Rocky 
Mountain trench. These Beds once extended over the site of the Purcell range and 
over much of the eastern Selkirks but have been completely denuded. It is highly 
probable that the western half of the Cordillera was a land surface during the 


Ordovician

(c) Correlation . The Goodsir shale formation is quite a large one and 
was formerly considered chiefly Ordovician and partly Cambrian, but the presence 
of ceratopyge fauna in the uppermost beds, determined by Ulrich as corresponding 
to the ceratopyge fauna which mark the commencement of the Ordovician in Sweden, 
places the boundary between the Cambrian and Ordovician almost at the top of the 
Goodsir shale formation* Hence the greater part of the formation is Upper Cam¬ 
brian (Croixian) as also indicated by fossils found by Walher in the Windemere 
area. The formation is best exposed at Mount Goodsir and lies conformably upon 
the Ottertail limestone of the Upper Cambrian (Croixian) and consists at the 
base of almost 3,000 feet of alternating hard and soft bands of argillaceous, 
calcareous and siliceous shales which weather light yellowish, gray and buff. 

This part of the formation is Uppdr Cambrian (Croixian). The upper part of the 
formation consists of banded cherts, cherty limestone and dolomite, thin-bedded 
and very dense, so that they weather into compact angular fragments. The 
following fossil suedes have been found in this formation; Obolus mollisonensis, 
Lingulella allani, Lingulella moosensis and Ceratopyge canadensis. It is 
correlated with the Siliery in age and hence is Beekmantown or Lower Ordovician 
(Canadian).

The G-raptolite or Glenogle shales comprise a large formation (at least 
2,200 feet) and have been given the former name by McConnell on account of the 
richness of certain layers in graptolites. The presence of this fauna determines 
the age of the formation as Ordovician and it may be correlated with Lower 
(Canadian) and Middle (Champlainian) Ordovician, or Levis and Chazy respectively. 
There evidently was little, if any, break between the Lower and Middle Ordovician 
in tnis area and this huge formation extends from Lower to Upper Ordovician, 
including parts of both. These graptolite shales consist ot black, carbonaceous, 
and brown, fissile shale at the top, underlain by gray shales which grade into 
the underlying Goodsir formations. These shales occur as two unfolded bands in 
the Beaverfoot range. 

The above formations are followed by the Wonah quartzite. There is 
quite an unconformity here between these beds which possibly indicates an erosional 
period when the sea retreated. This period which corresponds to quite a wide 
retreat of the sea over the North American continent as postulated by Ulrich, 
lasted for some time extending up to the Middle of Upper Ordovician (Croixian) 
time when the sea again advanced and laid down the Wonah quartzite. The Wonah 
quartzite is usually correlated with the Lower Richmond, since the Richmond sea 
was the most extensive of the Upper Ordovician (Croixian) time. It also approxi¬ 
mates very closely the Beaverfoot formation which is definitely Richmond. 

Tne Beaverfoot formation conformably overlies the Wonah quartzite and 
contains fauna which enable it to be correlated with the Richmond. It is de¬ 
scribed in more detail under the Kootenay area. This formation terminates the 
Ordovician in the Rocky Mountain region of British Columbia. 

3. KOOTENAY DISTRICT . 

In order to get a fairly definite section of the Ordovician for the 
British Columbia area, especially examples of the Upper Ordovician (Cincinnatian) 


the following district has been taken more or less in detail and the section given. 




- 48 - 


But nevertheless this region lacks in the Wonafc quartzite formation which is 
possibly only local and represents an oscillation of the sea. 

(a) Location and Extent . The area lies on the eastern slope of the 
Purcell range and extends from the summit of the range eastward to the Rocky 
Mountain trench. The district contains quite a section of strata of early 
Palaeozoic age with many good outcrops. The eastern slopes oi the Purcell 
range are made up of Precambrian sediments separated by a marked unconlormity. 
Palaeozoic sediments follow with small outcrops of Precambrian to the west. 

(b) Stratigraphy . The section is tabulated as followss

(c) Correlation . The Goodsir formation though formerly considered 
chiefly as uppermost Cambrian and Ordovician is now in part (the uppermost beds) 
Lower Ordovician (Canadian) and chiefly Upper Cambrian (Croixian) in age. It 
rests conformably on the Ottertail of the Cambrian and is overlain unconfoimably 
by the Beaverfoot (Richmond). It has an estimated maximum thickness in this area 
of 2,500 feet, but thins rapidly to the south-west to 70 feet. It is cut out in 
the trench by the thrust which carries the Precambrian over the Ottertail. The 
formation is made up of gray snale and tnin-bedded, bluish-gray limestone which 

is more predominant in the upper part of the formation. The limestone is fossili- 
ferous. 

(d) Summary of B, C. Ordovician . The section of Palaeozoics across the 
Rockies shows a remarkably complete sequence. The Ordovician rocks in this area

include representatives of Canadian (Lower Ordovician) Champlainian (Middle 
Ordovician) and Cincinnatian (Upper Ordovician) divisions of the period, al¬ 
though the last two are not complete. Therefore, in summary, the British 
Columbia section includes the uppermost beds of the Goodsir shale, the Glenogle 
shale, the Wonah quartzite and the Beaverroot formation with the upper part of 
the Middle (Champlainian) and the lower part of the Upper (Cincinnatian) 
Ordovician missing. 

j. nassasas areas. 

1. GENEHAL ORDOVICIAN OE NOHTHERftl AREAS . 

The final areas to be considered in correlating the Ordovician in 
Canada are the areas to the north including the North West Territories, Yukon 
and the Arctic islands. Little is known of these areas, due to their inaccessi¬ 
bility, but it has been definitely established that Ordovician does occur as 
far north as some of the northern Arctic islands. This large area has been 
represented by three smaller districts, and the Ordovician of these may be 
considered as indication of the type of Ordovician of the wnole area. 

2. MACKENZIE RIVER BASIN . 

(a) Location and Extent . The basin of the Mackenzie river occupies 
the north-west part of the continent of North America and includes within its 
area the northern parts of the provinces of British Columbia, Alberta and 
Saskatchewan, the western part of the North West Territories and parts of 
south-eastern and north-eastern Yukon. The area in great part lies in what is 
known as the Great Plains of North America but also is included in the Lauren- 
tian plateau region of tne west. The region has important palaeozoic areas, 
but has not been well worked out. It is also rich in mineral deposits and use¬ 
ful structural occurrences, such as waterfalls for hydro power. 

(b) Stratigraphy and Correlation . Tne area thus includes structures

chieily ol tne plateau type but also exhibits some mountainous regions* The 
Laurentian plateau lies to tne east and. is followed by tne Alberta plateau 
or the great central plain, going westward, ana finally tne Rockies. Tne 
basin covers an area of 6*52,000 square miles. Tne later Palaeozoics are 
mucn better developed tnan the earlier ones. Tne Palaeozoic has not been 
subdivided below the Silurian, out undouotedly contains Ordovician. This is 
noticeable in the Cordilieran region to the west, but Cambrian and Ordovician 
are not found east of the centre of the Alberta plateau. The rocks of this 
age are chiefly dolomite with shales and may be considered as cnietly Trenton 
in age. 

3. MAYO DISTRICT, YUKON . 

(a) Location and Extent . The Mayo District area of tne Yukon is 

that of tne upper Beaver river, comprising that part oi tne watershed of the 
Beaver river lying to the west of Baine Creek. The Beaver river lies in the 
Olgilvie range, a spur of the Mackenzie mountain system. Silver-lead deposit s 
nave caused tne district to be important. 

Cb) Stratigranny . The Palaeozoic section is as follows; 


Correlation 

Period 

Description 

Richmond (?, 

) Devon- 

Limestone and snaly limestone 

Ordovician 

Volcanic agglomerate, shale and sandstone. 


Tne major part oi tne material is volcanic in origin and has not been differen¬ 
tiated into tne various Palaeozoics. It is probably related to tne augite- 


andesites of the loY?er formations of Precambrian, but differs irom tne agglo¬ 
merates directly associated with tne andesites in that rounded pebbles and 
boulders of rocks other tnan greenstone are also present. Lithologically the 
bulk of the rock is composed of augite-mica-andesite and is dark green to dark 















purple. Associated with tne agglomerates are dark colored snales and sand¬ 
stones. 

Tile limestone is almost invariably wnite or lignt-colored, and as 
a wnole is somewnat massive-bedded over the greater part of the area, tnough 
shaly and sandy members are present. The limestone occurs in two areas or 
bands. These two bands outcrop in two different places and are tnought to 
represent the limbs of an anticline, the central part of which has been re¬ 
moved by erosion. 

(c) Correlation . Fossils are present in tne limestone but not 

abundant. The graptolites, Didymograptus and Climacograptus have been deter¬ 
mined. Halysites corals present seem to indicate Richmond age similar to the 
Lake Windemere district of British Columbia. Megalomus is lix;e those found 
by D. D. Cairaes in .Alaska boundary sections. Columnaria and Zaphrentis 
fossils indicate Ordovician. This limestone area belongs to the Devonian 
and Ordovician and no detinite break is recognized between the two systems. 

4. ALASKA-YUKON BOUNDARY AREA. 

(a) Location and Extent . The Alaska-Yukon boundary area includes 
tne district extending from the Procupine river north to the Yukon river and 
covers territory on either side of the boundary. The geology has been worked 
out to a distance of three miles in either direction from the boundary, or 
roughly, a strip of five miles in width. The district is important in that 
it is the one in the Cordilleras which contains a complete section containing 
all members oi the Palaeozoic. The area is roughly divided into three dis¬ 
tricts, namely, the Coastal system, the Interior system, and the Rocky Moun¬ 
tain system, which are self-descriptive. 

(b) Stratigraphy . Tne three above mentioned terraines consist of a 
mountainous uplift, a continuation of tne Rocky Mountain chain (Rocky Mountain 
system), the Yukon plateau which extends south-eastward from the mountains 








(Interior system) and. the coastal ranges wnicn are separated in places by 
wine valleys (Coastal region). Tne sections from tnese various regions is 
tabulated as follows;

(c) Correlation . Tne rociss of Ordovician age have not been clearly 


differentiated from tne limestone-dolomite sequence wnich ranges from Cambrian 
to Silurian time. This variety of rock comprises a great deal of the rock ex¬ 
posures. They are prevailingly white to lignt-gray in color, but occasional 
beds occur witn darm gray to nearly blacic appearance. The texture varies from 
firm dense dolomites to coarsely crystalline, almost pure limestones. They are 
characteristically somewhat massive in appearance. The Ordovician beds overlie 
tne Tinder group of Cambrian age and are fairly conformably overlain by tne 
Silurian dolomite-limestone. The Ordovician strata are only slightly metamor¬ 
phosed and are fossiliferous. They may be correlated with tne Port Clarence 
limestones and hence are considered as Trenton in age. 

5 . DOUBTFUL NOHThflhh ArtlUAS . 

There is some doubtiul Ordovician west of the Fort Norman oil field. 
They are red snales and are not fossiliferous and possibly belong to the Upper 
Cambrian (C r oixian) or Lower Ordovician (Canadian).
