I am deeply indebted to Dr, Wm, Rowan, Head of the 
Department of Zoology, for assistance and advice during the 
course of this study; for introduction to the writings or 
the persons of many ornithologists of note; for willTngly 
undertaking many small, and therefore onerous, commissions 
during ray absence from the TTniversitjr; and for encouragement 
at all times. 

I wish to thank Dr, P. Filler and Dr, ‘M'ue-hes of the 
Department of Zoolomv, whose advice or critical comments, 
freely given upon renuest, served to keep me on the narrow 
path of truth. 

thanks are also extended to Dr, Emil ^itschi of 
the State University of Iowa for helpful inforraa.tion and 
encouragement given to one who is not his pupil, 

Pinally I owe a great debt of gratitude to Fr. Robert 
lister, Technician of the Department of Zoology, not only 
for assistance in the preparation of m.aterials, but for 
providing an unfailing source of interest and enthusiasm, 
upon vrhich I very often leaned heavily. 



CERTAIN ASPECTS 


OF THE ¥ALE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM 
OF SOm PASSERINE BIRDS 


* * * 


INTRODUCTION 

In recent years a great deal of research has been carried 
out on the reproductive systems of birds, by some workers for its 
intrinsic value, by others because the sex hormones seem to control 
much of the birds' behavior including the fascinating and still 
little-understood act of migration. The fact that birds show a 
cyclical growth and decline of the gonads which is seasonal, at 
least in birds of the temperate regions, is now well known. A 
corresponding fluctuation in some of the accessory organs has more 
recently been discovered. Both are believed to be hormone- 
controlled. 

Much of this research has been of an experimental nature 
carried out on birds kept in the laboratory. Passerine birds have 
been found particularly suitable as experimentals, especially the 
Fringillids which are small and easily kept in captivity. 

Work with living birds in a natural state has been small 
despite the fact that excellent methods of securing wild birds 
unharmed have been developed by the bird banders. The reason for 
this is the necessity of sacrificing specimens in order to determine 
their stage of sexual development. This is also the most serious 
obstacle to successful research with laboratory experimentals. A 
method of determining the condition of the gonads without 
mutilation or death of the subject would do much toward advancing 
a study of sex among birds in a natural state. 




These facts were well known to the writer long before he 
started this thesis in the spring of 1946 as an orthodox invest¬ 
igation into the testicular structure and activity of some local 
species of passerine birds. The work soon became boring as nothing 
new was uncovered. Consequently it was decided to change the subject 
of investigation, A search of the literature had shoiim that a 
protruberance of the anal region,commonly used by the writer to 
sex passerine birds, was practically unknown. It also shovred that 
very little was known about the soermato-roa of many species of 
birds and that most descrintions were taken from specimens foimd 
in the testes. The idea of taking sperm samples, althoiigh familiar 
to the poultryman, seemed to be practically imknown to ornithologists. 
These two related subjects were therefore chosen for investigation, 
T’heir study forms the major part of this thesis but a short section 
on the testis is incliided to record part of the work done upon that 
subject, 

Tn this study the cloacal protruberance, an external feature 
related to the reproductive system, is found to be present on the 
males of some passerine species. It is believed that it could be 
used as an indicator of testicular development, A method of taking 
anal smears from males of some passerine species is also described. 

It is suggested that the nature of the semen obtained on these 
sm.ears might be used as an indication of sexual maturity. 

It is not the purpose of this thesis to follow the cyclical 
changes in either the cloacal protruberance or the nature of the 
semen. This is merely an introductorjr study, mainly anatomical and 
histological, which naturally should be followed by accurate quantit¬ 
ative work, Any quantitative facts obtained.incidentally to thd main 
problem, have, however, been included.

MATERIALS 

■^hree species of passerine “birds were selected during 1946 
as the Tna,ior species for study? the horned lark^ Qtocoris alpestris ; 
the vesper sparrow, Pooecetes gramineus; and the chestnut-collared 
longspun, Calcarius ornatus . Ordinarily, all are coirrmonly found and 
easily obtained in the Calgary district. During 1947 the chestnut- 
collared longspun was locally scarce, and since the specimens 
collected during the two years did not form a representative series, 
this species was placed with several others to form a group of 
minor importance which was used mainly for comparative purposes. 

This studji", therefore, deals chief 1^^ with the two species, 
the horned lark and the vesper sparrow. Both are members of the 
order Passeres but the horndd lark belongs to the family Alaudidae, 
and the vesper sparrow to the family 'f^ringillida.e. Their habitats 
are similar; both are found t^roically on the grassy prairie-lands 
of southern Alberta, They are partially insectivorous and partially 
granivorous. Both nest on the ground. But while the vesper sparrow 
arrives in southern Alberta about the end of April and nests only 
once during the suirarer, the horned lark arrives about the end of 
February and produces two broods by the middle of July. 

In all, one hundred and forty-six specimens comprising 
thirty-one species of birds, were examined. Of these, one hundred 
and thirteen specimens of eleven species, were passerine birds, 

A list of the species examined, with the number of specimens of 
each, is given in Table I. 

Most of the specimens were shot with light loads of dust- 
shot to prevent excessive damage. The ma,iority were ta,ken in the 
immediate vicinity of Calgary, but a few winter horned larks were 
secured at Rosebud, about fifty miles east and fifteen miles north 
of Calgary, where horned larks of one subspecies or another may be

found during every month of the year. Specimens were ta.ken mainly 
during the months of April, May, and June, There is a scarcity of 
material for the months of July and August when my attendance at the 
University was required. This prevented a study of some of the phases 
of regression ?.n the reproductive system and the work of others has 
been drawn upon to some extent to bridge this gap. Since this study 
is not intended to follow annual cyclical changes, but merely to 
examine certain parts of the reproductive system during the breeding 
season, this deficiency is not considered important. 

PREP.ARATTOIM OF FJlTERIALS 

Most of the specimens were examined in the lab within one, 
or occasionally two, hours of collecting. Here they were dissected, 
measurements taken, and records and drawings ma.de. Parts required 
for further examination were fixed i.n Bouin's solution for a 
minimum of twenty-four hnurs and stored in seventy percent 
alcohol. 

Materials for histological study were imbedded in wax 
following the orthodox procedure. They were then sectioned at a 
thickness of lO^a and stained with Delafield’s haematoxylin and 
eosin. Serial sections were cut at a thickness of 20/u . 

The method of taking sperm smears will be described under 
that heading, A great varietur of methods of preparing smears was 
used. The most successful proved to be immediate drying with no 
fixative or stain. Unfortunately^ this method fails to bring out 
the nucleus. To show the nucleus Delafield’s haematoxylin was 
used with eosin as a counterstain. It is believed that the use 
of Bouin’s fixative changes the shape of the nucleus but positive 
proof of this was not obtained.

T^E CLOACAL ■PROTPjmEP.AEEE 


prhen collecting passerine tirds the writer has long been 
accustoned to s^x them in the fi.eld by an external examination of 
the cloaca! reecion, Tn, males this region swells considerablv orior 
to thp bT-efadine season to form a defini.te protrn.beranee which 
imdoubtedly assists in coition. The organ persists throughout the 
breeding season after which it regresses and disappears. Its use 
as a diagnostic characteristic for sex is therefore confined to 
the spring and summer m.onths, but at that time it is particularly 
useful in sexing the sparrows, menj of which are alike in breeding 
olums.ge. The fact that ornithologists of my acouaintance were not 
familiar w5th this organ, and the lack of reference to it in texts 
and in papers dealing with the avian reproduct5.ve system, st5.mulated 
this in-'’^estigation. 

The protruherance was observed in breeding m.ales of the 
following species of passerine birds examined during the course 
of this study* 

Forned lark, Otoeoris alpestris 
Vesper sparrow, Pooecetes gramineus 
Savannah sparrow, Passerculus sandwichensis 
Chestnut-collared longspun, Calcarius ornatus 
Cowhird, Molothrus ater 
Meadowlark, Sturnella neglecta 
Brewer’s blackbird, Euphagus cyanocephalus 
Redwing blackbird, Agelaius phoeniceus 
Stresem.ann (1934) notes it in the American robin, Turdus 
migratorius, and in the Towhee, Pipilo erythrophtha-lmus, 

Rowan failed to notice the protruherance on the Slate-colored 
n’unco, Junoo hyem alis , which he used in his experiments on the 
manipulation of the reproductive cycle in birds by means of light.

Riley has worked extensively on the English sparrow. Passer 


domesticus, hut does not mention the presence of such a 
protruberance. It is not mentioned by Witschi or Feck who have 
also studied the reproductive system of this sparrow. Witschi, 
(personal communication) however, says that it has been 
observed. Both primary and secondary sex organs of the Starling, 
Sturnus vu.lgaris, have been the subject of investigations by 
Bullough, Bissonnette, and Witschi. Bullough’s work in pa.rticular 
treats in great detail with all parts of the reproductive systems 
of both male and female but, in common with the other •'Arriters, he 
says nothing of a protruberance of the anal region. The writer 
has observed the cloacal protruberance on the junco and the 
English sparrow. Unfortunately he has been unable to secure for 
examination a specimen of the starling which has only recently 
extended its range into Alberta. 

TTo evidence of a cloacal protruberance was found during this 
study on the following non-passerine birds used as comparative 
material: 

Laro-1 imicolae: Baird^s sandpiper, "Pisobia bairdi 

Pectoral sandpiper, Pisobia melanotus 
Least sandpiper, Pisobia minutilla 
Marbled godwit, Tjimosa fedoa 
Fr anklin gul1, Larus pipixcan 

Mseres: Mallard, ^nas piatyrhynchos 

Ealli: Sharp-tailed grouse, Pedioecetes phasianellus. 

The godwit, gull, mallard, and grouse were examined while in 
breeding condition. The sandpipers were migrating birds taken only 
as late as May 18. At that time, although there was no evidence of 
a cloacal protruberance (Fig. 4), the testes of these birds were 
well developed and contDined completed sperms in the tubules. 
























9 


Rowan (1929) records and pictures completed sperms in the testes of 
a closely related species, the semipalmated sandpiper, TCreunetes 
pusillus, taken during, migration at Beaverhills Lake, Alberta. Fe 
has also described (1926) the mating display of this species performed 
during the month of Fay. Tf a cloacal protruberance is produced at 
all, it must be by very raoid growth during the short period of 
time required by these sandpipers to reach their breeding grounds. 
Observations on passerine birds lead to the belief that, as in the 
testes, grovrfch of the cloacal protruberf:,nce is slow at the start and 
then precipitate. However, there is always some early evidence of 
it. Since this evidence is lacking in the sandpipers it is assumed, 
though conclusive evidence is lacking, that a cloacal protruberance 
is not present on breeding sandpipers of the three species examined. 

Structure in Vesper Sparrow 

The cloacal protruberance of the vesper sparrow is not fully 
developed when the bird first appears in the Calgary district about 
the beginning of May. ^t is then a cylindrical bod’'^ about 7-8 mm. 
in length projecting from the abdomen imder the urnpygium.(Fig.2). 
Aften the middle of May the protruberance becomes bulbons, swelling 
m.ainly on its dorsal side . (Fig. 3). 

IThen fuller developed the cloecal protruberpnce of the vesper 
soarrow is a roughly-spherical body nearly 12 mm. in greatest 
diameter, protruding backward from the abdomen under the uronygium. 

Its ventral surface is somewhat flattened. On its distal surface 
is the anus surrounded by rugose lips devoid of feathers. The 
long stiff feather group known as the anal tuft surrounds these 
lips and, the remainder of the protruberance bears small contour 
feathers, down, and filoplumes. From the anus during the breeding 
season, there often orotrudes a small naoilla overlapped by the

lips in much the same way as the eyelids fit over the eye. On this 
papilla is a simall opening. The papilla is the everted proctodaenm 
and the opening the outlet of the urodaeum ('Figs. 3,9 11), 

A dissection of the cloacal protruherance (Fig. 9) shows the 
rectum entering it near the dorsal surface and opening into the 
cloaca which extends back medially to the amis, Oopradaeiam, 
urodaeum., and proctodaeum are not distinguishable in gross dissection. 
On each side of the tectum, and running very close to it, are the 
very fine ureters which enter the sides of the cloaca. The vasa 
deferentia follow the route of the ureters but change their character 
before reaching the protruherance. Shortly before entering it each 
starts to coil and fold upon itself to form, a large pear-shape mass, 
the seminal glomus, whose narrower end points anteriorly. The 
glomera, separated by the rectum and cloaca, spread over these 
dorsally and ventrally usually meeting ventrally in the middle line. 
They remain distinct, however, as two bodies separated by their 
connective tissue sheaths. A continuation of the tube of which 
each is composed reappears on the median surface of the glomus 
toward its posterior end but it is now a thick tube, the ejaculatory 
duct. The two ejac\ilatory ducts rum close to the ureters near their 
ends and enter the urodaeum behind and dorsal to the ureter openings, 
'T’heir openings are situated fgirly close together on the dorsal 
surface of the cloaca. The identity of these various structures 
may be obscured by considerable fatty tissue surrou.nding and 
separating them. Around the whole of the above group of organs, 
and thus forming the wall of the cloacal protruherance, is a thin 
layer of volimtary muscle, the anal sphincter. The walls of the 
proctodaeum. are composed mainl^^^ of voluntary muscle, the cloacal 
sphincter. The proctodaeum m.ay be found in either the inverted or 
everted position (Figs. 10 Sc 11), 






During Fay ^nd June the seminal glomera are the larp^ast and 
most obvious organs in the cloacal protruberance of the vesper 
sparrow, in fact their growth, with a consequent enlargement of 
the region in which thej^ lie, causes the orotruberance. According 
to Bullough (194?,) these organs in the English starling consist of 
the much-coiled posterior ends of the vasa deferentia together with 
a number of blind branches of the vasa. He calls the organs 
seminal vesicles. He attributes their increase in size during the 
spring, not only to a lengthening and wi.dening of the gonaducts, 
but also to an increase in the size and number of the blind 
branches, Witschi (1945) on the other hand, vforking with specimens 
of the same species introduced into America, finds no branches of 
the gonaducts and calls its coiled end a glom.us, Webster’s 
Dictionary defines a vesicle as ’a small bladder’, and a glom.us 
as ’a coil or small plexus’. In accordance with these definitions 
the findings of the present studjr agree with Witschi and are such 
as to cause the selection of the term ’seminal glomus’ rather than 
’seminal vesicle’ for this organ in passerine birds. 

In serial sections of the whole cloacal protruberance of the 
vesper soaroow and of the horned lark no branches of the gonaducts 
could be found. There are no junctions of tubules to be seen 
although such are often found in sections of the testes where the 
seminiferous tubules are commonly branched (Fig. 24). A technique 
was devised involving the projection of serial sections upon a 
screen so that the tubules could be followed by means of a contin¬ 
uous pencil line. This also showed a lack of branches in the 
ducts. Finall 3 /-, parts of the coiled duct were teased apart and 
no branches could be found. Each organ then, appears as a much- 
coiled tube folded upon itself m,any times and forming a somewhat 
elliptical body which may best be termed a seminal glomus.

In the vesper sparrow the lumen of the ^lomeral duct varies 
from 150/^ to 315yU.in diameter when filled vdth snermato^^os, with an 
9verap;e diameter of about anneals to be no reeularity 

in the variation. Increase in diameter is probably caused by temp¬ 
orary congestion of semen in certain parts of the duct which becomes 
distended to accommodate it. There is evidence of stretching of the 
walls of the duct where the lumen is greatest. 

The glom.eral duct is lined with an epithelium averaging 
about 15 in thickness which consists mainly of a single layer of 
columnar cells whose vesicular nuclei are regularly arranged ;iust 
below the middle of the cells ('^ig. 19), Referring to the starl ing 
in a simnlar stage of develooment Bullough (1942) says that these 
cells ’were seen to be ciliated and actively secreting’. In the 
vesper sparrow the epithelium is not ciliated. However, numerous 
ragged strands extend a short distance i.nto the lumen from, many of 
the cells. This is taken as evidence of secretion and the epithelium, 
is considered to be glandular. The presence of groups of cells 
pulled away from the tunica but still connected with it by short 
cytoplasm.ic threads indicates that desnuamation takres placa. It 
is possible that the secretion of the m.ucosa and the substance of 
the cast-off cells both serve a nutritive function in the semen. 
Surrounding the columnar epitheliumL is a thin sheath of 
involuhtary muscle about 7,5yw.5-n thickness, ffhere the duct walls 
are very close together these m.uscle layers may lie in such close 
contact that they appear as a single layer but elsewhere they may 
be separated by a thin sheet of connective tissue. The interstices 
formed between the coils and folds of the glom-eral duct are also 
filled with connective tissue, usually of the areolar t^rpe. In 
this run many capillaries.

The posterior end of each glonus is made up of several folds 
of the gonaduct whose lumen is regularly circular in cross-section 
and of an average diameter of about 22.^. Here the lining epithelium 
and its involuntary muscle tunica are of the same type and thickness 
as in the more anterior parts of the duct but connective tissue of 
the compact type forms a complete outer tunica at least l^in 
thickness. That part of this duct which lies at the extreme posterior 
tip of each of the glomera, commences a transition into the 
ejaculatorjr duct which folds back upon itself two or three times 
before aopearing externall^r on the median surface of the glomus,as 
previously described. The first evidences of this change are a less 
regular structure of the mucosa and the appearancd of a connective 
tissue tunica between it and the muscularis. Shortly after, the 
identity of the muscle tissue becomes obscured and no definite 
muscular tunic is evident. At first there is no increase in the 
diameter of the duct, in fact its lumen has been considerably 
reduced as the ivalls have thickened. 

By the time the tvro ejaculatory ducts have reached the point 
at which they leave the glomera they have become well defined. 

Over a distance of 3 mm. each gradually swells to a diameter of 
about 750yu , becoming reduced aga5-n as it enters the urodaeum. 

Its lumen is small. Its mucosa consists of columnar cells but 
these are irregularly fitted together in more than one layer. 

The compactness of these cells and the fact that the mucosa is 
thrown into numerous longitudinal folds indicate that the duct 
is distensible. The connective tissue tunica becom.es very thick 
and the muscle less evident. Ho definite muscular tunic can be 
seen. 

The two ejaculatory ducts come close together on the 
dorsal surface of the urodaeum and- open on two conical papillae

which pro.iect into its cavity (Fig. 11), ^hese papillae are h short 
distance behind and above the openings of the ureters which are 
situated opposite each other on the sides of the urodaeum. The 
genital papillae project obliquely forward toward the copradaeuin 
when the nroctodaeum is in its normal position but when the procto- 
daeum is everted these papillae point backvrard toward the urodaeal 
outlet (Figs, 10 & 11), All three openings are thus brought into 
juxtaposition during coition. 

Contents of the Duct 

During the latter half of May and 5n June the -wh-ole gonaduct 
of the vesper sparrow is filled with semen. It contains sperm.atosoa 
so numerous that an estima.te of their numbers would be subject to 
an error of millions. Stresemann (1954) states that one ejaculation 
in the p?g*eon contains two hundred m.il lions, T’hej^ are crowded 
together in haphazard fashion; only here and there are there groups 
showing orderliness by lying parallel with their tails sweeping in 
the same direction. Protoplasmic debris is found in varying amounts. 
Some of it probably descends from the testes, the bye-products of 
snermiogenesis. Some of it, however, is the detritus resulting from 
the desquamation of the miicosa of the duct. Nuclear as well as 
cytoplasmic fragments m_ay be fo\md. 

No attempt was made during this study to show any definite 
correlation beti/reen the nature of the semen and the breeding cycle, 
Fowever, it Yfas noted in the vesper soar row that early in Fay the 
main constituent of the semen was debris with very few spermatozoa, 
typically occurring singly. At the height of the breeding season 
in June spermatozoa were most numerous and by the m.iddle of J\ily 
cellular debris again predominated. It was noted also that toward

the end of June spermatozoa with acrosomes missing appeared in 
increas5_ng numbers, both in the duct and on sperm sm.eprs. The 
loss of the acrosome is the first step in the disintegration of 
spermatozoa. 


Structure in Horned Lark 

The cloacal protruberance of the horned lark differs from 
that of the vesper sparrow in size and shape. Tt is elongate, 
nearly cj^lindrical in form, but tapering slightl 3 ^ toward its distal 
end (Fig, 6), Its length when fully developed is about 9 mm. ajid 
its average diameter about 5mm, i's in the vesper sparrow, the 
everted proctodaeum is very often exposed thj-ough the anal ooening. 

The bulbous tjrpe of cloacal protruberance was observed onl^/ 
on the vesper sparrow. The elongate tA^e, or a slight modification 
of it, was found on the horned lark. Brewer’s blackbird, redwing 
blackbird, and meadowlark. It has been observed by the writer 
previous to this study on a great Variety of passerine birds 
including the spotted towhee, Pipi lo maculatus , the robin, Turdud 
migratorius , McCown’s longspur, Rhyncophanes mccoi'mi, and many 
species of sparrows. 

Differences in size and shape of the cloacal protruberan.ee 
of different species are attributable to the size of the glom.era 
and the amount of adjacent adioose and connective tissue. In the 
horned lark, a definite mass of fattjr tissue is located betiTOen the 
glomera causing a m_uch wider separation than was ever noted in the 
vesper sparrow. The glom.era are much smaller in diameter than those 
of the vesper sparrow but about the same length, their shape being 
narrow ellipsoid (Fig, 8), They retain a more lateral position and 
were never noted to meet in a medianJline, This accounts for the 
cylindrical rather th^n spherical shape of the whole protruberance.

The glomeral duct folds and coils but does not branch. Its 
parts have an arrane^ement siriilar to those of the vesoer sparrow. 

The lumen of the duct, however, is much smaller in diameter varying 
between 80^ and 2,10jd wi-th an average of about 140/»., The mucosa 
averages a little thinner, about ISytt, and is more often cuboid than 
columnar. The involuntary muscle tunic is a little thicker, abotit 
lOytA or more in thickness. 

yo discernable difference Wf^s found in the eiaculatory ducts, 
nor in their openings into the urodaeum. 

The contents of the ducts were similar to those of the vesper 
soarrow save only, of course, that the spermatozoa ^vere quite diff¬ 
erent, These will be described below. 

Discuss ion 

The cloacal protruberance is formed in some passerine birds 
during periods of sexual activity, witschi "Personal communication) 
assumed, without investigation, that it might be caused by a locs.l 
_endev^us condition as well as by the growth and swelling of the 
seminal glome^^a, Tn the nasserine birds exam.ined during: the course 
of this study such is not the case, T'he protruberance was found to 
be form.ed as a result of the enlargement of the glomera although 
sometimes there is also an accumulation of fatty tissue in their 
immediate vicinity, naturally, there is some expansion of the 
muscular hody wall to accommodate these enlarged organs, and there 
is some evidence to show thr-t this muscular expansion occurs early, 
preceding rather than accompanying the enlargement of the glomera. 
nowever, the size of the protruberance is dependent mainly unon the 
size of the glomera. Fitsch.i (1945) has shown that groxrth and 
regression of the gondducts are oontvolled hy gonadotrooic hormones 
and that their 'zycle of development in the starling closely follows 
that of the testes. Tf we assi^me the sam.e to he in

pasRfri-ne then it follows that the developuTent of the cloaca-l 

protruberance is linked with that of the testes. 

So far, in experimental research on sex in birds, it has been 
found necessar^^ to follow the sexual cycle by rutilsting or sacrif¬ 
icing: inditridnals from a flock of experimentals. This method of 
5-nvestigation has obvious disadvantages. Each specimen must be 
assumed, to be a typical m_ember of the group. It cannot be returned 
as a member of the experT.m.ental group since it is either hsrmed or 
dead. It is impossible to follow 9 series of internal chanp^os in 
one individual. These disadvantages disanpear when the necessity 
of mutilating or sacrificing the experimentals is removed. Witschi 
and Wood (1936) tacitly epknowledged this when the^/- attempted to 
relate the color and size of the beak in the English snarrow with 
the development of the gonads, Pjiy external feature whose measurable 
variations might serve as an indicator for the cyclical changes in 
the gonads warrants serious- study. 

Although the cyclical nature of the growth and regression of 
the cloaca] protruber ance was noted during the present investigation, 
the relation between this cycle and that of testicular gro-'vth was 
not studied. The migratory habits of the two major species present 
obvious difficulties to si^ch a study by a resident worker. Certain 
impressions were ga,thered, however, with regard to this relationship, 
f^oremost among these was the belief that the cycles of testicular and 
glomeral activity are not coincident, but that the former precedes 
the latter. Thus there is a lag of development of the cloacal 
protruhersnce behind that of the testes. An attempt was made during 
the BB-rly spring of 1948 to check this in the resident English 
sparrow. Passer domesticus. It was there found that the development 


of the seminal glomera very definitely lags behind that of the

testes, ^or example, on March ?,1 male Engl5.sh sparrow showed 
nearly maximum gro'V'.’th of the testes (lengths, 9 mm and 10 rom.), yet 
the seminal glomera were very small (about 1.5 mm by 1 mm_). It was 
interesting to note that the glomera contained completed sperm.ato^oa 
in sm.all numbers indicating maturity of the testes, yet it is doubt¬ 
ful that coition had occurred or that sufficient semen had been 
produced to accomplish successful fertilization. Fowever, the 
cloacal protruberance ha.d commenced develooment and was measurable 
although it was still small. Tf such a lag occurs in the horned 
lark indications were that it is not nearly as great as in the 
English sparrow. 

Further WDrk of a quantitative nature is anticipated which 
should show the feasibility of using the cloacal protruberance as 
an indicator of testicular activity. 





Sperm smears were made from liviner or dead ‘birds by placing 
a microscope slide against the enus in snch a manner that the lips 
are opened against the glass, and then sliding it back toward the 
tail. Sometimes the faeces ore extruded upon the first slide but 
they may be removed abd a second smear taken. Practically no 
pressure is required during this procedure. Very often a good 
smear is obtained iirmiedlately, especially at the height of the 
breeding season. At that tim_e the proctodaeum is often exposed 
as a papilla at the anal opening and may be covered Y/ith semen. 

A mere touch of a slide against this surfacd is then siAfficient to 
produce a good smear. If a positive smear was obtained easily in 
this manner the fact is indicated in Table TI by the sign / / /. 

If spermatorroa were not observed on smears made in the 
above m^anner, light pressure was applied on the cloacal protruber- 
ance with the thumb and fore-finger of the hand Yh ich held the 
bird and further smears were taken. A positive sperm smear 
obtained in this manner is indicated in Table IT by / /. 

If neither of the above methods resulted ina positive sperm 
smear, greater pressure was applied, hut only on dead birds, forceps 
sometimes being used to secure a sample of the semen, A positive 
sperm smear secured in this manner is i.ndicated in T’able II hy / . 
Inability to secure spermatozoa in any of these manners is 
indicated in T’able II by - * 

Some sperm smears were dried and stored YYithout further prep¬ 
aration; others were fixed in Bouin’s solution and stained Yath 
either or both of Delafleld’s haematoxylin end aqiieous eosin; others 
were stained Ymthout use of a fixative. The sperm, smears were often 
greasy. Before staining, it was foun.d best to remove fats by immers¬ 
ing the slide in xylol, and then running it rapidly through alcohol

solutions from absolute through 85;^, and ^0%, before nutting it 

in the aqueous stain solutions, Sor^e were mounted in Canada balsam,* 
others in glycerine. The most successful preparations were those 
which were put through the i^''lol and alcohol baths and dried imm¬ 
ediately, unstained and unmounted; and those which were stained 
with Delafield’s haematoxj^lin and eosin withoi’t the use of a fix¬ 
ative. Figure 20 shows an. example of the first method of prepar¬ 
ation, Figures 21 and 22 show examples of the second m.ethod. 

The idea of taking sperm smears as evidence of full sexual 
maturity imfortunately did not occur to me until early in May, 1947, 
The first sperm smear from a horned lark was made on Fay 6th and 
thus the greater part of the first breeding period was missed. 

In the case of the vesper so eTrow, however, a smear was taken from 
the first male collected during 1947 and from all succeeding males 
taken during that year. It is admitted that the number of specimens 
taken was too small, and the dates of collection too far apart, to 
draw very definite Conclusions but Table 11 is offered as a possible 
indication of a trend. It lists the numbers, the dates of collection, 
and the ease with vfhich sperm smears were obtained, of specimens of 
Qtocoris alpestris and Pooe cetes g ramineu s taken during 1947.

Table TI shows that positive sperm smears were most readily 
obtained from vesper sparrows during the period from Jime 1 to 
June 28, a period which coincides well with the peak of testis 
development (Fig, 1), It also indicates th^t fertilization of eggs 
would be imoossible before about May 14 and after July 16, and that 
the chan.ces of fertilization before May 17 would be small. 

In the horned 1.ark positive sperm smears were obtained 
readily on May 6 and 7 toward the end of the first peak of testis- 
development (‘P’ig, 1) but were difficult to secure a week later on 
May 13, and remained so, with one exception, until between June 6 
and June 15 when positive smears were again easily obtained. This 
period coincides with the second peak of testis develooment. 

After .Time 19 snerms '■'^ere obtained only with considerable di-P-C t tv, 
TAo snerms could be found or enal smears taken from a snecimen 
collected on June 28, even after several attempts end the use of 
considerable pressure; yet the glomera were later found to contain 
a few spermatozoon. Successful fertilization is probably imoossible 
after the end of June. 'Ni’o information was seoi^red which would show 
the d^’te at which fertilization could first be effected. 

A very profitable and interesting problem arising from the 
above still remains to be carried out, Tt is quite nrobable that, 
in addition to devising s better method of measuring the ease of 
securing sperm smears, the vitality of the spermatozoa could also 
be measured. At very least, the presence of living or dead sperms 
could be observed. It is possible also that the nature of the 
seven as shown on the, smear could he used as an indicator of the 
dcvelonraent of the testes. Thus experimental workers using passer¬ 
ine birds could -writh certainty tell the time at which sexual m.atur- 
ity is reached without sacrificing individuals, and could perhaps 
estimate the stage of development of the testes before or after

that time. Since the necessity of keeping large numbers of 
experimentals, which must be sacrificed from time to time and 
which may vary among themselves, has always been som.ething of an 
obstacle to avian research on sex, this problem warrants consider¬ 
ation. 


SPERMATOZOA 


The descriptions of spermatozoa given below are of tjrpical 
specim.ens observed on slides obtained by the first method described 
above under ’Sperm Smears’. Previous authors have described sperm¬ 
atozoa mainly from, sections made of mature testis. Specim_ens 
obtained on sperm sm.ears are ideal since they are kn.own to be 
mature. In a well-made smear the spermatozoa are distinct and 
straight. This makes them easy to observe and easy to measure. 
Facility in the technique of taking sperm smears is recommended 
for any student of avian spermatozoa. 


Vesper Sparrow 


The spermatozoon of the vesper sparrow has a long head and 
an exceptionally long tail. It is the longest spermatozoon 
encomtered during the course of this study, sometimes reaching a 
total length of (Fig. 14 and Table ttt). 

The head form.s a spiral, the basal portion being 'thickened to 
contain the nucleus and then flattening raoidlj^ to form, a spiral 
membrane which is the acrosome. Apparently the nucleus is flattened 
somewhat to fit in the base of this spiral, When viewed fro^^ the 
side it is na.rrow and comTpa-shpfned, curving with the trarid of th'a 
ac^ai^n-me 12'', Tn front view, however, 5.t appears heart-shape

with an i.ndentation anteriorly which gives a bifid appearance 
(Fig. 13), '^he micleus is about 3y^ in length and beti^veen and 
n greatest width, 

"^he acrosome is a spiral membrane, arising from the nuclear 
part of the head. Broad at its base, the membrane tapers off at 
the tip which is thus sharnly pointed. It makes approximately?- two 
and one-half turns, 'T'he first turn is a fairly tight spiral throw¬ 
ing the membrane well beyond the width of its base; the next str?='tche 
out considerably; and the last part of the membrane travels far with, 
very little turning. Th.e average length of the acrosome is 17yu» 

Fo well defined region which could be termed the neck was 
observed in any spermatozoa of the vesper sparrow, whether stained 
or unstained. Fowever, the tail filament does not start abruptly 
from the rosterior end of the nucleus. Instead there is a gradual 
taoering from one to the other, Tliis conical structure probably 
represents the neck of this spermatozoon. 

The tail is a ve^-y long protoplasmic thread arising from the 
posterior end of the neck. Starting here a narrow spiral membrane 
winds about this thread in draiA/n-out coils. The membrane disa.npears 
so gradually that its end end the beginning of the termnnal filament 
were never definitely seen. The total length of the tail a,verages 
about 220/(, 

Horned Lark 

The spermatozoa of the horned 1prk are comparatively short, 
being only about one-third the length of those of the vesper 
sparrow (Fig. 14), The acrosome and tail are both shorter but the 
nucleus is about twice the length of that of the vesper s-parrow 
(Fig. 16). Total length of the spermatozoon is about (Table III)

In stained specimens the head shows a long, stout nuclear 
region and a thinner, slightly shorter spiral acrosome. The acrosome 
is a spiral membrane not as wide at the nu.cleiis as in the vesper 
sparrow, and gradually tapering to a point while making about two 
turns of a spiral'which not diverge Yery far l aterally from a 

central axis. Its length is about 

The nucleus is a twisted, cj/’lindrical mass whose diameter is 
about one-third of its length. It tends to follow the curvature of 
the spiral started by the acrosome. At its anterior end it is 
slightly concave where the acrosome .joins it (T’ig. 16), The length 
is about and the diameter about 

Attached posteriorly to the nuclear part of the head is the 
neck, Jt is quite short but correspondingly thin, its shape being 
long conical with the apex pointing posteriorly. The apical half 
stains darker than the basal portion in Delafield's haematox\^lin. 

Its length is less than l^w. 

The tail of the spermatozoon is short. From the anex of the 
neck arises a filament around which turns a narrow membrane which 
gradually taoers off as it spirals. It makes aoproximately t^venty 
turns over a distance of about 62^ before disappearing. The 
terminal filament continues on without this membrane to a length 
of about 14-yU, 

Discussion 

During the breeding season of 1947 samples of spermatozoa 
were secured from four species of passerine birds. Mong these 
spermatozoa those of the vesper sparrow were easily distinguishable, 
not only by the great length of the tail, byt by the presence of 
the short stout nucleus which, under low magnification, appears

as a small dark sphere between the acrosome and the tail. The 
spermatozoa of Brewer’s blackbird and of the cowbird are similar to 
each other and to those of the horned lark. In common thej/- oossess 
a fairly loner twisted nucleus and a. tail much shorter than that of 
the spermatogoon of the vesper sparrow, Desuite their similarity, 
however, it was found possible to identify good specimens of any of 
them. Just how far the ability to identify a species from the size 
and shape of its spermatozoa could be developed was not further 
investigated. 

After long examination of both stained and unstained sperm 
preparations the imnression was gained that some step in the prep¬ 
aration of the smears brings about a change 5.n the sire, and shape 
of the nucleus. The spermatozoon is one of the few places where 
such a change vrould be discernable, The change is believed to be 
similar to that which ocours in miscle upon application of extreme 
heat, or that vrhich is found in a viscous liouid mo'^^'ing freelj^ in 
space, insufficient material was on hand durinp 1947 to permit 
experimentation which would urove or dispro'^^e this impression, but 
some measurements '"^ere m.ade which strong"'y support it. The chanme 
is believed to occur in one or more of the following solutions: 
Pouin’s fixative, acid alcohol, Delafield’s haematoxylin. It is 
anticipated that further study of this problem during the avian 
brepding season of 1948 will bring about its solution.

■’."'hen this study was started durine: the spring of 1946 it 
was intended that a study of the testes of various passerine birds 
would form the major part of the vrork. It soon trecame anparent, 
however, that the testes of the .species examined differed in. no 
important respects from those of several species of birds already 
reoorted upon by workers better qualified than the vjriter, An 
examination of other parts of the reproductive tract sT:iggested 
more interesting and profitable problems and a search of the 
pertinent literature showed that much, less work had been done 
upon the accessory sexual organs. Consequently it was decided 
to relegate a study of the testes to a position of minor importance. 

T'he testes of all birds collectdd were preserved, sectioned., 
and examined. The following observations were made during the 
course of these examinations, '[hey do not nretend to be a compreh¬ 
ensive study of the testes of passerine birds but are considered to 
be of suf-ficient importance to record. 

Testis Size of Horned Lark 

The horned lark was chosen as one species for study partly 
because in southern Alberta it produces two broods per year, one 
hatched early in May, the other late in June. Measurements were 
t'^ken of testis sizes of specimens collected during the entire 
breeding season. It was noted that the shapes of the testes were 
•oarticularly uniform within the series, the right always being 
practically spherical, the left ovoid, with the ratio of major to 
minor axis approximately 5;2. Since the volume of a regular body 
is pronortional to any of its linear measurements the length of such 
a body is as good an indicator of variation as the volume. Therefore 





*■ ■’ f' . ■

lengths of the testes were chosen ss the standard of measurement. 

The accomnanying; granh (Fig. 1) uses average lengths of the two 
testes as a basis of comparison of specim-ens. It shovrs a composite 
picture of all specimens taken during 1946 and 1947, At that it is 
recognised that the data are too meagre, however, since there was 
no purposive selection of material it might be assumed that the 
specimens collected were representative ones and that the graph is 
significant, A graph of testis si^es of the vesner sparrow which 
breeds but once per year in southern Alberta is included for comp¬ 
arative purposes. 

The most striking feature of this graph is the double crest. 
Testes of the horned lark increase in size during March and April, 
reaching a peak about the time that the first set of eggs is being 
incubated, Fegression then occurs for about two weeks after which 
further increase in si^e for ^^hout twenty-five days brings them ba.ck 
to a second peak at ^ time when the second set of eggs is in the 
ne st. 

Keck (1954) gives a graph of testis size of the English 
sparrow. Passer domesticus, which shows a concavity at the top 
suggestive of a double peak. Bullough (1942) by-passes this subject 
in the English starling, Sturnus vulgaris, by giving only monthly 
averages of testis volumes. Another worker mth the starling, 
Witschi (Personal communication), has no records from which deduct¬ 
ions might be drawn. These are the only three passerine species, 
so far studied, vdiich regularly breed more than once per year. It 
is noteworthjr that two of the three species show a period of testis 
regression between periods of sexual a.ctivity. 

It is not intended to enter into the controversial discussion 
of the various external stimuli which bring about recrudescence and 
regression of the avian testis, but merely to point out the signif-

icRiice of the graph when considered 5.n relation to the more conmonly 
proDOsed stiir'iili* vi7.., variation i.n day-length, in temperature, and 
in activity. 

It is noted that hoth regression and recrudescence, involving 
a variation of about 2 ram. in testis length of horned larks, occur 
during a neriod when day-length and average temperature are increas¬ 
ing, It is also noted that degression of the testes follows a 
period of relative activity of the male i/^ile the female is incubat¬ 
ing, and that recrudescence follows a period of great activity 
during which he assists in ministering to the needs of a rapidly 
growing family. The ’lag’ in each case is aoproximately ten d^ys. 
Apparently such a lag of response behind stimulus is normal, for 
Bissonnette (1931), using experimental increases of day-length on 
starli^s, found that n-Pter five days the testas wer'=‘ not afPeote^ 
but aPter sev^^ri d^vs they were ’littl^ enlarged’. Assuming a 
similar lag for horned larks in this instance, it would appear that 
the facts fit the activity theory very closely. 

This same tonic, examined in some species which breeds twice 
annually snd in which the male assists in the dut^r of incubation 
thus becoming relatively sedentary between breeding periods, would 
m.ake an interesting subject for further research. 

An Example of Physiolop*ical Separation of Subspecies 

Since the writer personally collected and prepaned all 
materials for study in this thesis there was ample opportunity for 
recognition and study of problems other than those directly conn¬ 
ected with anatomy and histology. The following note is considered 
of sufficient importance to warrant its inclusion in this paper. 

It is andefinite illustration, of which few have been recorded, of 
what has been called ’the physiological differentiation of subs-pecies

On April 18, 1947, p male desert horkied l^rV, Oto<^oris 
alnestris lenco]aema, was collected from a field of alfalfa in 
which a few pairs of birds of this subspecies had obviously chosen 
territories end nest^ne! sites, T’he testes of this bird measured 
7 mm, and 9 mm., in length. Later examination showed mature sperm.- 
atozoa in the tubules of the testes ("Pig. 24) and the seminal 
glomera were filled with spermp.tozoa. In other words there seems 
to be no doubt that it was a breeding bird, 

A few moments after this bird was collected attention was 
attracted to a flock of horned larks feeding in a fallowed field 
across the road and about one hundred and fifty y^rds distant. 
Their oresence as a flock, when horned larks should be building 
nests, was unusual and a soecimen was collected, ^Aiis flock, or 
others with numbers var:'''ing from tvrenty-five to seventy-five, was 
present on the following two days, and further specimens were 
secured, a total of seven, of which wix were males. All were 
Hoyt’s horned lark, Otoeor is alpestris hoyti, a darker subspecies 
than the resident desert horned lark. On April 21 they were gone 
and it was assumed that the birds had continued their migration 
northward.

"^able TV shows the lengths of the testes of the six males 
collected. The average length is about 2.5 mm. at a time when the 
tp>stis-length of the locally bredding desert horned larks is 8 mm, 
or more (Fig. 1). Sections of the testes show development of the 
germ cells in ea,ch case. Spermatogonia are present in all testes 
a.nd perhaps also primary spermatocytes although these latter in 
the resting stage are sometimes difficult to distinguish from 
spermatogonia. Primary spermatoc^rtes in the s;^mi^esis phase were 
numerous in the testes of Hos, 98 and 105 (Fig. 25). Fo stages of 
spermatogenesis beyond this were noted in any of these testes. 

None of the six m.ales was in breeding condition. The female was 
in an equivalent stage of development, 

■^ere then are two subspecies of horned, lark present in the 
same region during the spring of the year. Despite their proximitnr 
aiid their close relationship they do not intermingle. Their 
behaviorisms are markedly distinct. In one, Otoeoris alpestris 
leucolaema, the Konads are fully developed; in the other, Qtocoris 
alpestris Hoyti development is slight. Due to this disparity in 
sexual development the form.er has completed its migration, chosen 
a territory, and is breeding; while the latter is still gregarioiis 
and migratory. They are physiologically incapable of inter-breeding 
A physiological condition separates them, while contiguous, as effect 
ively as any geographic barrier could do, and by the time this 
difference in sexual development has become equalized the original 
disparity has caused a geographic barrier to be placed between them. 
Phase appear to be as good grounds as any on which to base subspecif 
distinction. 

Tt is my opinion that mam^ of the avian subspecies with 
north-south distribution evolved as a result of original m.inor

variations in rate of s^xi.ial development with consequent variation 
in migration distance. The effects were cumulative within the 
environmnetal 15.mitations of the species. Superficial distinctions, 
not necessarily adaptive, in size, color, etc., followed i-n response 
to different environmental factors, and suhs ■•ecific i.dentitv was 
estahlished. 

It is believed that, within many soecies with wide north-south 
distribution, the whole population does not migrate as a phalanx with 
fixed relative positions, but that the members at the extremeties hop 
over the medial ones which a.re inclined to remaD.n se<lentary, "Tcis 
has been demonstrated in certain hawks (Salt, 1939) and is at present 
under study by the witer in waterfowl. Here it is demonstrated in 
the horned lark. Such habits tend to produce and fix geographically 
a variety of subspecies. Hln.ere the front of the migration is wide 
the number of subspecies 'may beegreatly increased. Such appears to 
be the case in the horned lark, 

Sertoli Cells 

A close inspection was made of testis sections of all 
species collected mth the express purpose of discovering the 
presence of Sertoli cells. None were observed. Mature soermat- 
ozoa are present in the seminiferous tubules in groups, very 
regularly arranged in passerine species (Fig. 24), less so in 

1.1 

non-passerine species, Noy^^evidence was discovered, however, which 
would point to the presence of any type of ’mother cell’ in 
connection with these groups.

An PTternRl feature, the e'’oacal nrotruberance, is (discovered 
on some species of passerine birds. 

A description is of this protruberprice as observed on 

the vesper sperrow, Pooeoetes frraniineus, and on the horned 
larlc, Otoe or is alpestris. 

The histology of the accessory sexual organs found in this 
protruberance is described. 

Methods of obtaining snerv smeans frorn some passerine birds 
are given, 

fhe spermatozoa of the vesper sparrow and the horned lark 
are described. 

Tt is suggested that the size of the cloacal protruberance 
and the nature of tlie semen obtained on sperm smears might 
be used as 5.ndicators of testicular activity, 

A double peak is found in the spring cycle of testis 
development of the horned lark, and an explanation of 
this in terms of the activity theorjT- is attempted. 

An example of the phiz’siological separation of subspecies 
is recorded from disparities of gonad dev^^lopment found 
in the desert horned lark and Foyt’s horned lark, 

,An/faT^ence of Sertoli cells is noted in the m.ature testes 
of certain passerine birds.
