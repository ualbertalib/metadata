THE RELATIONS OF BTOMATAL JIZE AND GENERATION 
TO THE YIELDING ABILITY OF 
BULKED WHEAT HYBRIDa 


B# Charles Jenkins 


GENERAL INTRODUCTION 


Yield in plants is an exceedingly complex character, 
and is the ultimate expression of the interaction of many environ¬ 
mental and inherent factors integrated throughout the life of the 
plant. It is well established that different varieties, are 
capable of giving different yields and it is equally well established 
that environmental conditions play a large part in determining yield. 

In crop improvement studies, yield is frequently the 
most important of desired characters and perhaps the most diffi¬ 
cult to analyze. Rod-row tests are unquestionably important and 
necessary in the' determination and final selection of a superior 
yielding strain, but unfortunately they are costly, time consuming 
and-unwieldy when the number of strains is large* Any method 
which could be used efficiently to reduce hybrid populations 
in relatively early generations would be a valuable aid to the 
plant breeder. It was hoped that the investigations described 
in this thesis might suggest two methods of this nature. 

The relations of stomatal size and generation to the 
yielding ability of bulked wheat h 3 /brids are treated in two parts. 
Part I .has to do with stomatal size and yield while Part II 
deals with generation and yield.

The Belation Between Btomatal Size 
and Yield in Bulked Wheat Hybrids

INTRODUCTION. 


The limiting effect of drought on crop production in 
western Canada has long been recognized. Little in the way of 
breeding resistant varieties of wheat has been accomplished, 
since the complex nature of drought resistance is difficult to 
relate to some easily recognizable character. Drought resistance 
possessed by any group of plants is due to a multiplicity of 
morphological and physiological characteristics and is further 
complicated by the existence of two types of drought. One, 
and perhaps the best known, is called M soil drought” and exists 
when the soil does not provide the plant with sufficient moisture 
to replace the amount lost by transpiration. The other, known 
as 11 atmospheric drought”, is caused by hot dry winds bringing 
about a desiccation of the plant, even possibly under conditions 
of relatively high soil moisture. Plants resistant to one type 
of drought may not necessarily be resistant to the other# 

Many phases of the drought resistance problem have been 
investigated with the hope of obtaining some relatively simple 
and practical index for determining drought resistance. This 
department has expended considerable time and effort in the 
production of drought resistant wheats - using high grain yield 
as the criterion by which a variety^ ability to resist drought 
is judged, but at the same time endeavouring to refine the 
methods of selection so as to reduce the time and cost of pro¬ 
ducing such new varieties. It was with this latter point in 
mind that the present study was undertaken, following the "lead” 
established by previous workers in this department (2, 6, 24)#

On the basis of the relationship between stomatal size 
and yield established by Birdsall (2), this study was undertaken 
to determine whether high yielding segregates or strains in a 
bulk population might be selected on the basis of stomatal size, 
i.e* length* If such a method could be used, the number of hybrid 
lines which would reach extensive yield tests would be materially 
reduced, allowing for a much more efficient program with a 
minimum of cost*

LITERATURE REVIEW, 

Much of the literature concerning drought resistance 
and methods of selecting for drought resistance, has already 
been reviewed extensively (1, 2, 6 , 24). No attempt is made to 
cover in this review all this literature* 

Maximov (21) regards the following anatomical peculiar¬ 
ities as characteristic of xerophytes; a decrease in the size of 
all cells, including the stomataJ a thickening of the cell walls \ 
a strong development of palisade mesophyllj a denser network of 
veins \ and an increase in the number of stomata per unit leaf 
area. Most workers have agreed that these characters are associated 
with drought resistance. 

Torrie ( 33 ) studied the genetics of several qualitative 
and quantitative characters in wheat as part of the drought 
breeding program initiated at the University of Alberta in 1929 (1)* 
It was hoped that certain of these characters might be related to 
drought resistance. Aamodt and Johnston (1) undertook preliminary 
investigations to ascertain the resistance of wheat varieties 
to drought and to study in detail certain morphologic and physio¬ 
logic characters associated with drought resistance and reported 
several interesting relations© 

A preliminary study of stoma tal frequency per unit 
leaf area in wheat varieties was made, and varietal differences 
established by Peto (24) in 1936 . Birdsall (2) continued the 
work with stomatal frequency and in addition measured the length 
of stomata, relating both of these characters to yield and protein

content* Significant varietal differences in sternatal length and 
frequency were established. He found that a negative relation 
existed between stomatal length and yield, and a positive re¬ 
lation between stomatal length and protein content. Since 
stomatal length was found to be less variable and more accurately 
measured than stomatal frequency, he concluded that such a character 
might be more valuable for selection purposes. 

Darroch (6) concluded that seedling leaf stomatal 
length shows some premise for the selection of high yielding 
types, on the basis that the seedling leaf characters are largely 
predetermined by embryonic development. He concluded that flag 
leaf stomatal length, being greatly influenced by environment, 
has no selection value* 

Working from the view/point of Maximov (21) that the only 
true criterion of drought resistance is the ability of the plant 
to endure drought without injury, Platt and Darroch (2£) have 
suggested that artificial drought tests would be useful in elim¬ 
inating low yielding lines or hybrid populations* Further 
work by Darroch ( 6 ) emphasizes the simplicity of the soil 
drought survival method. The equipment necessary is available in 
any greenhouse. A large number of plants may be handled without 
much work, and the positive relation between survival and yield 
suggests that by using this method of selection the yield level 
of any population might be raised* The soil drought method has, 
however, certain disadvantages. 1 'here appears to be a tendency 
to select late maturing plants in which ease the method becomes a 
device for eliminating the earlier maturing lines*

In an exploratory study Hopkins (17) was able to 
demonstrate significant effects of moisture supply on number, 
height, and weight of shoots, number of fertile heads and weight, 
size, and nitrogen content of grain per plant and per shoot of 
two wheat varieties. These results were obtained under winter 
greenhouse conditions, and may not be duplicated in all respects 
in the field. It was inferred, however, that observations of 
this type, under field plot conditions, of a relatively small 
number of plants grown under controlled moisture supply, might 
provide useful information respecting the adaptability of different 
varieties of plants, and the morphological aspect of drought 
resistance in general. 

Haber ( 9 ) made a study to determine whether there were 


any -physical or anatomical characters possessed by pure lines 
of corn which could be associated with resistance or suscepti¬ 
bility to drought and high temperature. This study was analagous 
to the present investigation, since, if successful, the method 
would be used to select resistant hybrids. It was found, however, 
that none of the anatomical or physical properties studied, in¬ 
cluding transpiration, number of stomata, root system and vascular 
bundles, provided a means of classifying unknown pure lines or 
strains as resistant or susceptible. A point of particular sig¬ 
nificance is that no real differences in relation to the numbers 
of stomata on either the upper or lower surface of the leaves 
could be established for resistant and susceptible lines. While 
numbers of stomata may not be as satisfactory as stomatal length 
as a criterion of drought resistance (2), the two characters have 
much in common.

Whiteside (35) using measurements of height, length 
of leaf blades, length of sheath and distance between nodes, 
has shown that the check gave higher measurements for each of 
these characters than^the plants exposed to drought. He also 
found that the number of veins in wheat was not less but that 
their distance apart was definitely less for the plants exposed 
to drought as compared with the checks.

MATERIAL AND METHODS * 

Material * 

Mary crosses have been made in the various wheat breed¬ 
ing programs of the Department of Field Crops. The object has 
been to produce new varieties of superior merit and not necessarily 
for the sake of plant breeding studies. Varieties have not, 
therefore, been combined with other varieties in any degree of 
completeness* 

For this study the seven varieties listed in Table I 
were chosen as parents. Particular attention was given to 
variations in stomatal size (length), yielding ability and 
maturity*

For brevity and convenience in subsequent discussion 
the N. 3. N# will not be given, Erythrospermum 0341 will be 
referred to as Erythro and the 062 will be dropped from Lutescens. 

Canus, Red Bobs, Reward and Thatcher are well known 
varieties now being grown commercially in western Gam da, although 
Reward, owing to its poor yielding ability is decreasing in 
importance. Comet originated as a result of a cross between 
Marquis and Hard Federation and is reputed to be drought resistant, 
early, and high yielding (3)* In drought tests conducted by the 
Department of Field Crops, Erythro and Lutescens, two varieties 
of Russian origin, have given good comparative yields#* Both of 
these varieties are late* 

In the summer of 1941 these seven varieties were 
crossed in all possible combinations excluding reciprocals! a 
total of twenty-one crosses. As far as possible, those varieties 
with recognizable recessive characters were chosen as female 
parents so that M selfs n could be eliminated in the F^ generation# 

The method employed in making the crosses, which involves the 
bagging of emasculated spikes, is described by Hayes and Immer (16). 
A minimum of 100 seeds was obtained from all but three of the 
crosses. In these, however, over 95 seeds were obtained. Despite 
the fact that several of the combinations had previously been 
made in connection with the drought breeding program, they were 
repeated to obtain comparable material.

Methods a 

Tests of Material* 

Individual plants were studied in three tests made up 
of twenty-one F]_ crosses together with the seven parental 
varieties* Two of these tests were grown in the greenhouse 
and the third in the field. They will be referred to as : 

Test 1 (Greenhouse - fall 1941) 

Test 2 (Greenhouse - spring 1942) 

Test 3 (Field - summer 1942) 

Each was arranged in a randomized block design, and 
despite differences in replication, etc*, which are mentioned 
later, these tests were basically similar. 

stomata were measured on seedling (first) and flag 
(terminal) leaves in each test* The technique and equipment 
used in measuring stomata has been described by Birdsall (2), 
and was used throughout the present investigation with the 
following modifications. 

An improved slide and a rapid method of identifying 
collected leaves, described in Appendix A, were used. Instead 
of taking a trans-leaf sample from the base of the leaf, all 
measurements of stomata were made in the mid-leaf region. 
Supporting evidence for the value of this procedure is given 
in Appendix B. .All measurements were made in as short a tjme 
as possible to minimize the error. Usually one "batch 11 was 

measured at a sitting. In the case of seedling leaves a 
"batch" consisted of one leaf from each of the twenty-eight

varieties in a replicate. For flag leaves, however, it was 
made up of leaves from plants at similar stages of development. 

Seedling leaves were taken for stomatal measurements 
when the plants were in the third-leaf stage. Flag leaves 
were removed when the head was about two inches out of the 
"boot". (See Appendix B). 

When the plants were mature, height and number of tillers 
were recorded. The number of poorly developed tillers was also 
noted. The main culm was not considered to be a tiller. The 
number of culms per plant, therefore, would be the number of 
tillers plus one. This system was used by Rosenquist in a study 
of hybrid vigor in wheat (28). Plants known to be "seifs" were 
discarded. Individual plant identity was maintained by placing 
the heads of each plant in an envelope, and to identify the 
head from the main culm about two inches of the stem was left 
attached. With the exception of Test 1, after the heads were 
thoroughly dry they were threshed and the following notes 
recorded: number of seeds in the main culm, weight of seed 
from the main culm and total seed weight. The latter includes 
all tillers. 

Details of individual tests varied slightly, and these 
differences are dealt with in the following sections. 

Test 1 . 

This test, seeded September 13th, 1941, was arranged 
in twelve replicates, each replicate being made up of three 
plants. For ten of the replicates (1-10) the plants were 
spaced in the form of an equilateral triangle, in six inch

unglazed flower pots and were located on the middle bench of 
the greenhouse. The other two replicates (11-12) were on a 
side bench and the plants were not in pots, Soil to a depth 
of eight inches made a continuous bed, allowing for the seeds 
to be planted in rows. Plants were spaced two inches each way. 
Extra material was planted around the margins of the test to 
reduce "border effect". A border row of plants, potted in the 
same manner as the test plants, completely surrounded the material 
on the centre bench and also helped to reduce "border effect"* 

Pots with weak or missing plants were moved to replicates 9 and 
10 and for the purposes of recording data these were discarded, 
leaving ten complete replicates. 

Test 1 was partly of an exploratory nature. Twenty 

x/jls 

stomata were measured for seedling leaf of every plant 

in the test. It was decided, however, that for future measure¬ 
ments ten stomata per leaf would provide an adequate sample. 

Owing to the limited amount of time available, it 
was only possible to measure stomata on plant number 2 for flag 
leaf determinations. Accordingly, the entire flag leaf was 
removed from number 2 plants and measurements taken. At 
harvest time, however, it was noted that in practically every 
case where the flag leaf had been removed, the seed was 
poorly developed. (See figures 2, 3 9 and 4). Growing conditions 
in the greenhouse in fall and winter of the year are, at best, 
unfavorable. Artificial light was supplied but it is impossible 
to approach natural conditions. Since the removal of the flag

leaf brought about variable degrees of shrivelling in the 
seed of number 2 plant, yields were recorded on the basis of 
number of seeds per plant rather than weight of seed per 
plant. 

Test 2 . 

This test was seeded January 1st, 1942 and consisted 
of ten replicates, two of which acted as "border material*'. 

Pots with weak or missing plants were moved to the border, 
leaving eight full replicates for the test. The number of 
seeds per pot and their arrangement in the pots was the 
same as for Test 1. In this test, however, six inch glazed 
pots were used. Stomata1 measurements, ten to each leaf, were 
made on all seedling and flag leaves. 

Growing conditions were decidedly more favorable 
than for Test 1. Only half of each flag leaf was removed for 
stomatal measurements and no detrimental effect on seed develop¬ 
ment was noticed. 

Test 3» 

Test 3 was seeded in the field on May 14th, 1942. 

The soil was quite dry so in order to avoid possible uneven 
germination, the entire test was thoroughly watered on the 
following day. There were four replicates of single-row plots. 

& plot consisted of seven seeds spaced two inches apart in 
the row with three seeds of Dakold fall rye at each end of 
the row. Bows were two feet long and one foot apart. Extra 
rye kernels were planted to fill any blank spaces after emergence.

The planting of rye reduced "border effect" to a minimum. 

Three foot pathways between "banks" allowed easy access to the 
plants. Ten stomata per leaf were measured for all seedling and 
flag leaves# 

Test of F 2 Material. 

Sufficient seed was obtained from Test 3 to permit the 
carrying out in 1?43 of a field rod-row test of the F 2 generation 
To be consistent with the nomenclature of tests conducted by 
the department, this test was called the "Special F 2 Wheat Test". 
It will subsequently be referred to as the "Special F 2 ". 

This test, consisting of thirty-six varieties, was 
arranged in a square lattice design (16). (F 2 hybrid populations 

are referred to as varieties). Seeding was done April 30th, 1?43 
The two-row plots were eighteen and a half feet long, with a nine 
inch space between rows and an eighteen-inch space between plots. 
The space between plots allowed for greater ease of handling, 
with little danger of mixing the unselected bulk populations, 
and at the same time afforded relatively accurate yield com¬ 
parisons (14). 

On the basis of the stomatal size average for both 
seedling and flag leaves of the parental varieties, with the 
exception of Reward (of which there was insufficient seed), seed 
of the plants was separated into "large" and "small". Only 
seed from those plants with the extremes in stomatal size was 
used, but to provide sufficient seed, approximately two thirds 
of the plants had to be used.

To obtain the number of varieties required by the 
square lattice design it was necessary to include "filler” 
varieties, results for which were included in the analysis, but 
HHB are not reported* 

Dates of heading were the only field notes taken. 

Owing to exceptionally vigorous growth, considerable lodging 
occurred in some of the varieties, thus making notes for straw 
strength, height and maturity unreliable. Such notes, however, 
would have added little to the value of this investigation. 

At maturity both rows of a plot were trimmed to sixteen 
and a half feet and harvested, and the four replicates of one 
variety were stooked together to minimize the danger of mix¬ 
tures. When dry the sheaves were threshed in a small rod-row 
thresher and the yields recorded. Every precaution was taken 
to avoid mixing and loss of seed. Since the sheaves were large, 
the error from the loss of a small quantity of seed was reduced. 
Yields were calculated on the basis of three rows instead of 
two, thus facilitating the calculation of yield per acre.

Results of Individual Tests * 

Test 1 . 

The results obtained for various characters in Test 1 
are reported in Table III and results of the analyses of 
variance for some of these in Table VI. Since the measurements 
of stomata on flag leaves were limited to the number 2 plants, 
the seedling leaf measurements reported are also limited to 
tnese plants. The lack of tillers and the low number of seeds 
on the main culm are indicative of the unfavorable conditions 
which prevailed throughout the entire period of the test* 

i 

Test 2 . 

Much better yields were obtained in this test than 
in Test 1 , indicating more favorable growing conditions. A 
summary of the results obtained is presented in Table IV* 

Results of the analyses of variance for most of the characters 
appear in Table VI. 

Test 3 . 

Owing to an abundant supply of moisture and the space 
provided for tillering, plants in this test were vigorous and 
productive. Slight lodging occurred just prior to maturity, 
but it did not affect the yield. 

The results obtained for various characters in Test 3 
are summarized in Table V. Results of the analysis of variance 
for some of the characters appear in Table VI. 

In all three tests of material, definite varietal 
differences occurred for all of the characters studied. The 
design of these tests prohibited a multiple analysis of variance,

but in spite of a possible variety x test interaction, the 
varieties arranged themselves generally in the same relative 
order. Bed Bobs consistently had small stomata while Reward, 
and some crosses involving it (notably Tha tcher x Reward) 
always gave poor yields. Tillering in the greenhouse was hardly 
parallel to tillering in the field. In the greenhouse, in 
Test 2 in particular, the early varieties produced the most 
tillers - a definite reflection of greenhouse conditions. 

For the most part, however, it was considered that these three 
tests of F]_ material, and more particularly Tests 2 and 
gave results which approach true varietal differences. 
Interrelationships # 

Seedling and Flag Leaf Stomatal Size Relationships. 

The stomatal size results for varieties in individual 
tests, for both seedling and flag leaves, were simply averaged 
to get the results presented in Table VII. Analyses of variance 
(Table VIII) indicated highly significant varietal differences 
for both seedling and flag leaves and, as might be expected, 
highly significant differences for tests. The varieties and 
hybrids are arranged in Table VII in order of increasing stomatal 
size. 

Although there is some similarity in the order in 
which varieties and hybrids arrange themselves for seedling 
and flag leaf stomatal size, there are striking exceptions. 
Erythro and Lutescens have much larger flag than seedling 
leaf stomata, while those crosses in which Reward is the male 
parent have smaller flag than seedling leaf stomata. The reason

for this difference is without explanation unless environment 
has been largely responsible* Darroch (6) has shown con¬ 
clusively that environment may affect stomatal size in flag 
leaves. It should be remembered, however, that Erythro and 
Lutescens are late varieties and that the crosses with Reward 
as the male parent ©re, for the most part, early. 

Despite these minor discrepancies, a highly significant 
correlation coefficient of 0.672 between seedling leaf stomatal 
size and flag leaf stomatal size was obtained. The results 
correlated are those presented in Table VII and represent the 
average of all three tests (720 individual measurements for 
seedling leaves and 620 for flag leaves). The correlation surface 
is shown in Figure 5 >. Positions of parental varieties are 
indicated. The relationship existing between stomatal size on 
seedling and flag leaves for this material is far better than 
the one found by Darroch (6) but is still far from perfect, 
indicating environmental or other influence*

Stomatal Size and Yield Kelationships # 

One of the main objects of the present study was to . 
determine the extent of the relationship between stomatal 
size and yield. Since total seed yield was not obtainable for 
Test 1, the number of seeds on the main culm were taken to 
represent yield. Stomatal sizes for seedling and flag leaves 
were individually related with number of seeds on the main 
culm and total seed yield and are discussed in the following 
sections* 

Number of Seeds, Main Culm . 

A summary of the number of seeds, main culm, obtained 
in the three tests of F]_ material is given in Table IX* The 
varieties and hybrids are arranged in descending order of 
productivity, expressed on a percentage basis. Instead of 
averaging individual test results directly, they were changed 
to a percentage of the general mean and then averaged. In 
this way equal weight was given to each test* 

Little relationship was found to exist between number 
of seeds, main culm and either seedling or flag leaf stomatal 
size. Insignificant correlation coefficients of -0.2Gj? and 
- 0 . 118 , respectively, were obtained. The correlation surfaces 
in Figure 6 show the widely scattered distribution of points. 
Parental varieties are indicated and, had the same been done 
for the hybrids, they would have been seen to group themselves 
round the common parent.

Relation between the number of seeds on the main 
culm and stomatal size for seedling and flag leaves#

Total deed Yield . 

Large test differences made necessary the conversion 
of individual results to a percentage basis before averages 
could be obtained. In Table X are the results for total seed yield 
of varieties and hybrids in two of the three Fp tests. 

Practically no relationship was found to exist between 
total seed yield and stomatal size of either the seedling or 
flag leaves. Insignificant correlation coefficients of -0.245 
and 0.002 respectively were obtained. The correlation surfaces 
are shown in Figure 7* Owing to variability in tillering, the 
range for total seed yield is much greater than for number of 
seeds on the main culm. These characters are, nevertheless, 
related. Although the results are not presented, a rough 
correlation surface was drawn up for the relationship of 
number of seeds on the main culm, and total seed yield. A 
scatter indicating a high correlation was obtained. 

Test of F2 Material. 

Results for the Special F 2 test are presented in 

Table XI. 

The analysis of variance for yield appears in 
Table XII. 

In the field test, strains of parental varieties 
were separated on the basis of large and small stomata. For 
summary purposes the results obtained for these selections were 
simply averaged.

Owing to rather severe lodging in the latter part of 
the season, the very late varieties did not fill properly. 
Evidence of somewhat abnormal yields for Canus, Erythro and 
Lutescens is shown in Table XI. Ordinarily these varieties 
would appear much higher in the list. 

A higher but still non-significant correlation 
coefficient of 0.416 was obtained when seedling leaf stomatal 
size for tests was correlated with yields of parental 
varieties and F2 hybrid populations. In this case, however, 
the relationship is positive. 

Selection of Strains on the basis of Stoma tal Size . 
StomataI Size - Yield Test . 

On the assumption that higher yielding strains within 
a variety might be selected on the basis of stomatal size, 
Birdsall in 1940 made stomatal measurements on 200 plants in 
each of three varieties, namely Ganus S-34-I, Caesium x Marquis 
H-37-20 and 1-28-60 x Milturum H- 29 - 33 . (The two hybrids 
mentioned showed promise as drought resistant varieties and 
were at that time in advance yield tests.) Plant identity was 
retained, a few with the largest and a few with the smallest 
stomata were harvested and increased in 1941. A quadrupli¬ 
cated single rod-row yield test, including sixteen strains of 
Ganus and eight strains each of H-37-20 and H-29-35, was con¬ 
ducted at Edmonton in 1942. This test was called the "Stomatal 
Size-Yield Test". The yield results appear in Table XIII# 
Statistical treatment of the results did not appear to be

necessary to indicate the lack of difference between ’’large" 
and "small" selections. 

It would appear from the results of this test that 
stomatal size has no selection value. 

Selection Within Parental Varieties. 

Plants of parent varieties in Tests 2 and 3 were separated 
on the basis of stomatal size. An average of stomatal measure¬ 
ments on seedling and flag leaves of the plants allowed a 
separation into "large" and "small". Seed from the "large" 
and "small" strains for Test 3 was used in the Special Fg. 

Results of stomatal size and yield differences for 

t 

six parental varieties appear in Table XIV. The/test of sig¬ 
nificance was used to determine the significance of the difference 
between mean "large" and mean "small" selection yields. Despite 
a few individual differences in favor of "small" selections, the 
mean for "large" was greater in every test. The difference was 
significant beyond the 3% point in two of the three tests. It 
is reasonable to suppose that similar differences might have 
been found had strains of the F^ hybrid material been separated 
on the basis of stomatal size, since F^ hybrids are completely 
heterozygous, giving each plant the same genetic constitution. 

These results do not support the theory that plants with 
small stomata are the higher yielders* Actually it would 
appear that selection on the basis of small stomatal size be¬ 
comes a device for obtaining small weak plants.

DESOUaSION . 

According to Worzella (37) a test of relationship be¬ 
tween characters must be simple, accurate and specific before 
it can be of much use in identifying and measuring accurately 
varietal or strain differences. The use of stomatal size 
(length) to determine the relative drought resistance, as measured 
by yield, of wheat varieties or strains has been studied in the 
present investigation. To be of practical value a high relation¬ 
ship must exist# Judged by these standards, the stomatal size 
yield relationship has no selection value. 

With protein content, high yield is associated with low 
protein (22) but with stomatal size there is no standard re¬ 
lation which can be used as a basis for selection. Red Bobs, 
for example, has small stomata and gives a good yield, ihile 
Thatcher has large stomata and also yields well. While minor 
discrepancies do occur in the relation between protein content 
and yield, this relation would be much more valuable for selec¬ 
tion purposes than the stomatal size and yield relationship. 

It might be argued that a better relationship would 
have been found had the plants been grown under limited moisture 
supply (21) ,* but even allowing for this, it is felt that the 
relation between stomatal size and yield would be of no practical 
value. At best differences are not great, and even within 
varieties large plant differences occur. If seedling leaf 
stomatal measurements were used as a basis of selection, unless 
the undesirable plants were immediately eliminated, an accurate 
method of plant identification would have to be devised. This 
would entail a considerable amount of work, which in addition

to the labor involved in measuring, would greatly limit the size 
of population to be handled* Flag leaf stomata! measurements 
would be easier to obtain, but environment plays a large part 
in determining stomata 1 size on these leaves. To be useful 
to the plant breeder, a specific test should be applicable to 
large populations and the stomatal size and yield relationship 
fails in this respect. 

There seems to be little doubt that stomatal size is a 
varietal characteristic. Despite the association between small 
stomata and high yield, varieties do exist which have large 
stomata and yield well. It is suggested that a possible reason 
for the negative relation between stomatal size and yield is 
that there is usually a greater number of varieties with small 
stomata giving good yields. 

^Selection of plants on the basis of stomatal size has 
actually been studied. In contrast to what might be expected, 
the plants with large stomata nearly always gave higher yields, 
lending further support to the explanation already suggested for 
the negative relationship. If the idea expressed by Maximov 
(21), that plants with small cells have small stomata, is 
accepted, then it would appear that selection on the basis of 
small stomatal size becomes a device for accumulating small, 
poor yielding plants. The results of the present investigation 
seem to support such a theory. In an unselected bulk population, 
however, this may not be true since the plants selected are 
actually newvarieties. It is unfortunate that the present 
material did not permit a more thorough study of unselected

hybrid populations, but in any case if stomatal size were used 
as a criterion for selection this character in the parents 
would have to be known. Little difficulty would be encountered 
if one parent had large stomata and gave a low yield while the 
other parent had small stomata and gave a high yield or if the 
reverse were true, but such an ideal relation seldom exists* 

Many varieties have medium sized stomata, some giving poor, 
others medium and still others high yields. The whole relation¬ 
ship is too complex to have any practical application in a 
breeding program. 

Immer ( 19 ) has concluded from a study of spaced barley 
plants that the variation in yield of single plants in spaced 
progeny rows is determined almost completely by environmental 
factors. In the present study it was thought that the yields 
obtained closely approached those which might actually be 
expected. The plants Immer studied were,spaced five inches 
apart in rows one foot apart, and this might account for the 
lack of varietal differences*

NUMMARY . 

The relation between stomatal size and yield has been 
studied for seven parental varieties and twenty-one F^ hybrid 
populations. Some sixty thousand stomata were measured during 
the course of the investigation. All possible parental com¬ 
binations except reciprocals were made. These may be considered 
as essentially twenty-eight varieties since the F^ hybrid 
plants being completely heterozygous, have the same genetic 
constitution. Using yield per plant, as measured by the number 
of seeds in the main culm and total seed weight, .no relation¬ 
ship was found to exist between it and the stomatal length for 
either seedling (first) or flag (terminal) leaves. Needling 
leaf stomatal length was actually more closely related to yield 
than flag leaf stomatal length, as indicated by slightly higher 
correlation coefficients, but neither relation was statistically 
significant. 

Selection on the basis of small stomatal size (length) 
within varieties produced no increase in the yield of the 
resultant strains and although further testing would be 
necessary to substantiate the results obtained, it would appear 
that this method becomes a device for selecting the poor 
yielding weak plants. 

Despite the fact that stomatal size is a varietal 
characteristic, there does not appear to be any standard or 
"best” size which may be sought. 

Owing to the complexities of the problem and the limi¬ 
tations imposed by the high expense and the unreliability of 
the relationship, it is concluded that the relation between

The Relation Between Generation and 
Yield in Bulked Wheat Hybrids.

INTRODUCTION 


Any method which might be employed efficiently to reduce 
hybrid populations in early generations so as to minimize the cost 
of ultimate rod-row testing would be a valuable aid to the cereal 
plant breeder. Several workers (11,13,18) have indicated that 
yield tests of unselected bulk populations in early generations 
might be used as a basis for discarding those crosses which 
will eventually give only a few high-yielding segregates. In 
similar studies Taylor (32) attempted to evaluate bulk progenies 
from single and multiple crosses in wheat and barley. Although 
the number of progenies was large, he had the results of- only 
one year’s- testing on which to base conclusions. oince Taylor’s 
material was confined to the generation, except for a few 
hard wheat single crosses in Fj * comparison of generations was 
practically impossible. 

The present study was made for the purpose of supple¬ 
menting the results obtained by Taylor. The fundamental aims 
of these two investigations have'been in most respects identical, 
though the scope of this study has been enlarged by the use of 
more than one generation and the addition of hybrid populations 
from all possible combinations, excluding reciprocals, of seven 
hard spring wheat varieties. 

It was hoped that this investigation with these addi¬ 
tions would not only corroborate the results already obtained, 
but would indicate more conclusively the value of various crosses 
as a source of future superior selections and the combining 
ability of parents for use in breeding programs.

LITERATURE REVIEW 

-Since a great deal of the literature has already been 
reviewed by Taylor (32), repetition will be avoided as far as 
possible• 

The results obtained by Harrington (13) have furnished 
information of value on the usefulness of bulk hybrid yield trials 
in evaluating crosses. He nevertheless felt that it would be 
worth while to have parental varieties F-|_, F 2 and F^ in the 
same replicated yield trial. In addition, he realized that a 
number of economic characters other than yield may be limiting 
factors. For such characters as milling and baking quality, 
disease resistance, and resistance to certain weather conditions, 
bulk hybrid trials would be of little value. Resistance to 
insect attack and more particularly resistance to wheat stem 
sawfly might be added to the list. 

The complexities of yield have been considered by 
several workers ( 3 , 4, 36 , 37)* In most cases, attempts have 
been made to separate various yield attributes in order to 
simplify the yield complex. It is generally considered that 
of the many characters present in wheat, yield is the most 
difficult to analyze. While the plant breeder is interested 
primarily in the inherent factors affecting yield, the importance 
of the environmental factors must not be overlooked, since they 
affect the physiology and morphology of the plant in a way 
that is directly related to yield.

Suneson and Wiebe (31) in studies with wheat and barley 
have suggested that the relative yield of a variety is not 
necessarily a criterion of its ability to survive in competition 
with other varieties grown in mixtures in the same locality. 

Barley variety mixtures were tested extensively by Harlan and 
Martini (10). In experiments with a mixture of eleven varieties 
grown for four to twelve years at ten stations, they found 
evidence at certain stations of early aggressiveness and 
increasing dominance of the local commercial type* At other 
points, however, the locally grown commercial variety in the 
mixture was depressed and varieties not grown in those localities 
dominated the mixture after a time. Papadakis (23) has shown 
that natural selection among wheat varieties sown in mixed 
stands does not always favor the varieties that give the higher 
grain yields when sown alone under the same conditions. It 
was concluded that high grain yield does not constitute the only 
factor on which depends dominance in the struggle for existence 
and also that wheat varieties differ in aggressiveness, each- 
being remarkably constant in this respect. 

The foregoing reports of disparity between individual 
and competitive yields suggest a decided limitation to the success 
of the bulked population method of cereal breeding. These have 
in addition a direct bearing on the use of yield tests of 
unselected bulk populations as a basis for discarding those 
crosses which will eventually give a low percentage of high^ 
yielding segregates.

Harlan et al (11) have shown that certain varieties 
of barley are more valuable as parents than others. This is 
demonstrated by their ability to produce an unusually high 
percentage of superior segregates in their offspring while others 
give only a few high-yielding segregates, dome varieties 
which were considered to be unpromising,, as judged by their 
performance in nursery tests, were found to be superior 
parents. 

Taylor ( 32 ), in a study of wheat bulk hybrids, has shown 
that the yield of the parental varieties is a valuable indi¬ 
cation of their combining ability. He has suggested, however, 
that each variety should be combined with each other variety in 
a more complete investigation.

MATERIAL AND METHODS . 

The material used in the present study consisted 
largely of the unselected bulk populations grown by Taylor ( 32 ) 
in 1942, and was, therefore, advanced one generation. In addition 
there was a residue from the seed used by Taylor. 

The ”early wheat hybrids”, ’’soft wheat hybrids” and 
’’barley hybrids” were all grown in 1943 f but this discussion is 
limited to the results from the first two. The names of tests 
were altered slightly to be consistent with the nomenclature of 
tests conducted by the Department of Field Crops. The early 
wheat hybrid yield test became the ’’-Special hybrid hard wheat 
test” and the soft wheat hybrid yield test became the ’’Special 
hybrid soft wheat test”. The 1943 names will be used throughout 
the subsequent discussion. 

The Special hybrid hard wheat test involved a comparison 
of unselected bulk hard wheat hybrids and 8 parental varieties. 
The hybrid populations included the following groups of crosses; 
in the F£ generation - 10 single and 2 double crosses, in the F^ 
generation - 11 single, 6 triple, 11 double, 2 five-variety, 4 
six-variety and 1 eight-variety, and in the F 4 generation 9 ' single. 
The terminology used in describing the crosses has been given 
by Taylor (32). 

The Special hybrid soft wheat test involved a comparison 
of 43 unselected bulk wheat crosses made for the purpose of pro¬ 
ducing an early soft wheat, and 6 parental varieties. The hybrid 
populations included the following groups of crosses; in the F 2 
generation - 8 single, and in the F^ generation - 10 single, 11 
triple and 14 double crosses.

The size and arrangement of plots, the experimental 
design and the method of handling described for the ’’Special 
Wheat Test” in Part I of this thesis applies also to both 
of these tests. The arrangement of plots is illustrated in 
Figure 8. 

In addition to the hard and soft wheat crosses, the 
present investigation includes the consideration of some results 
obtained from the tests to determine the relation between stomatal 
size and yield in wheat hybrids. Full details of these tests 
appear in Part I.

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 


Summaries of Bulk Hybrid Yield Tests . 

Results obtained for the Special hybrid hard wheat test 
and the Special hybrid soft wheat test are summarized in Tables 
XV and XVI respectively. In each table the varieties and 
hybrids are arranged in descending order of yield within each 
group. Analysis of variance for yield for varieties and hybrid 
populations in these tests appear in Tables XVII and XVIII. 

Yields of the late varieties, notably H-37-30, H-29-33 
and crosses involving these varieties, are noticeably below 
normal. Owing to severe lodging in the latter part of the 
season, varieties and hybrids such as these did not develop 
properly. 

Comparison of the 1942 and 1943 Results . 

Since several of the parental varieties and hybrids 
were common to tests in 1942 (32) and 1943, it was possible to 
make two year comparisons. Abnormally high yields were obtained 
in both of these ye.ars in all tests* 

The relationship between the 1942 and 1943 results was 
tested by correlation. For parental varieties in the hard wheat 
hybrid test, a non-significant correlation coefficient of 0.^84 
was obtained. * A higher but still not significant coefficient of 
0* 682 was obtained for the soft wheat parental varieties. 

Despite the lack of significance, due to the low number of 
comparisons possible, there does seem to be a fair relationship 
between the 1942 and 1943 yields of the parental varieties. 

(see Figure 9).

Yields for those hybrids which were in Fg in 1942 
and F^ in 1943 were correlated for both hard and soft wheat 
hybrids. Variations in hybrid vigor will admittedly affect 
such a relationship. However, it was thought that some indicatio 
of the closeness of relation for the two years * results might 
be obtained. For the hard wheat hybrids, a non-significant 
coefficient of - 0.030 was obtained, while for the soft wheat 
hybrids the coefficient was O .339 and highly significant. 

The correlation surfaces involved are shown in Figure 10. 

Field observations lend support to the statistical 
results obtained. Little lodging occurred in the 1942 test of 
hard wheat hybrids, while in 1943 lodging was severe. Variations 
in maturity, straw strength and height would all contribute to 
differential results for the two years. Lodging in the soft 
wheat hybrid test was equally as bad in 1942 as in 1943 . This 
undoubtedly accounts largely for the better relationship, 
indicated by significant correlation coefficients.

Heterosis* in Jingle and Multiple Hybrid Populations . 

Yield . 

Heterosis for yield was not so consistently demonstrated 
in 1943 as in 1942. ctome crosses gave yields above the parental 
averages while almost an equal number yielded below the parental 
averages. Yields varied considerably but the range was not as great 
as in 1942. 

Comparing the single crosses in the special hybrid hard 
wheat test, those in the F^ generation showed the greatest amount of 
hybrid vigor, the next and the F^ least (Table XIX). The fact 
that the F^ hybrid yield has shown an increase above the parental 
average over the F 2 and F^ is probably due to a greater predominance 
of high yielding segregates. The majority of the multiple 
hybrid populations are in the F^ generation, and the absence of 
hybrid vigor is apparent. It is perhaps significant, however, 
that, of the multiple crosses, all three of those involving six 
varieties and the one involving eight varieties have yielded 
more than the parental average. The 1942 results ( 32 ) show 
that these crosses demonstrated no more vigor than the other 
multiple combinations. It may be that six and eight-variety 
crosses would, by intensifying the qualities of several parents 
in one variety, be valuable as a source of high yielding 
segregates. 

The results in Table XX again show that single crosses in 
the F^ generation have less vigor than those in the Fg. Hybrid 
vigor was more general for the soft wheat hybrids than for the 
hard wheat hybrids (cf. Tables XIX and XX). 

^Heterosis (hybrid vigor) is considered as an increase over the 
average of the parents for the characters under study.

Mean yields of single, triple and double crosses in the 
F^ generation exceed the parental average by 3 , 3 and 10 per cent 
respectively, as compared with 19, 24 and 34 per cent for the 
generation in 1^42 (32), The double crosses have consistently 
displayed the greatest amount of hybrid vigor and appear to be 
more capable of retaining it. Only two of the double crosses 
yielded less than the parental average. 

The results obtained for tests reported in Part I of 
this thesis also afford comparisons of the bulk hybrid yield 
and the parental average. Immer ( 18 ) has shown that in barley 
crosses the F-^ exceeded the average of the parents in yield per 
plant by 27*3 per cent. The results in Table XXI, for Test 3; 
show that the F-j_ hybrid average exceeds the parental average by 
13 per cent for yield per plant. Great variations in hybrid 
vigor, ranging from 51 per cent to minus. 12 per cent, are 
apparent. The same crosses in the F 2 generation have shown an 
equal amount of hybrid vigor for yield (as measured in bushels 
per acre)(Table XXII). Only one cross, namely Thatcher x Reward, 
yielded less, than the parental average. It is suspected that 
some incompatability may exist between Thatcher and Reward as 
evidenced by a trace of sterility exhibited in the ? 2 population. 

Immer (18) with barley and Taylor ( 32 ) with wheat found 
that a close relationship exists between hybrid yields and the 
parental averages. In the present study the F 2 hybrid yields for 
twenty-one crosses were correlated with the parental averages and 
a non-significant coefficient of 0.232 was obtained. The correla¬ 
tion surface in Figure 11 clearly shows the lack of relationship.

A highly significant correlation coefficient of O .334 
was obtained between the F, hard wheat hybrid yields and the 
parental averages. A non-significant correlation coefficient of 
0.026 was obtained between the F^ soft wheat hybrid yields and 
the parental averages. The correlation surface’s are shown in 
Figure 12. It is interesting to note that in 1942 the relationship 
between the F 2 hybrid yields and their parental averages was 
also much better for the hard than for the soft wheat hybrids. 
Perhaps the poor relationship for the soft wheats is due to 
large differences in the parental varieties. ‘Two distinct 
classes of wheat have been crossed to give many of the combina¬ 
tions . 

It is reasonable to suppose that, owing to differential 
segregation, the F^ hybrid yields would be less closely related 
to the parental averages than would those of the F 2 . If it is 
possible to base conclusions on the comparison of the 1942 and 
1943 yields, the supposition is supported. A far less consistent 
display of hybrid vigor was demonstrated in the F^ in 1943 for 
both the hard and soft wheat hybrids. 

As mentioned previously, Taylor (32) had only a limited 
number of single crosses in both the F^ and F^ generations. It 
is fairly well established that as homozygosity is reached, hybrid 
vigor is lost. Harrington ( 13 ) and Taylor ( 32 ) with wheat hybrids 
have shown a decrease in the F^ yields as compared to the Fg. In 
the present study, six hard wheat hybrids in the F 2 and F^ genera¬ 
tions were common to both the 1942 and 1943 tests. A comparison 
of the results obtained is shown in Table XXIII. Within each

group the crosses are arranged in descending order of the difference 
between the F^ and F^. With the exception of H-29-33 x Reward for 
1943, the F^'yields are equal to or lower than the F 2 * The 
difference is particularly marked in the 1942 results. On the 
average, however, the decreases in yield range from 2.8 to 12.3 
bushels per acre, representing a loss in hybrid vigor for yield of 
7 bushels per acre or 13 per cent. Expressed in per cent of the 
parental average the F 2 and F^ yields are 109 per cent and 96 per 
cent respectively. In general, the crosses with the greatest 
amount of hybrid vigor for yield in the F 2 are the ones with the 
greatest reduction in yield in the F^. The average results are 
obviously predominated by the 1942 results in this respect. The 
need for more than one year f s testing is well illustrated by the 
results in Table XXIII. 

In the Special hybrid soft wheat test, eight crosses 
were present in both the F^ and F^ generations. Only two of the 
Fj hybrids yielded more than their respective F 2 populations 
(Table XXIV). On the average the F^ exceeded the F^ by 2.9 
bushels per acre. This represents a loss of approximately 6 per 
cent in hybrid vigor for yield by the F^. The F 2 and F^ hybrid 
yields were found to be fairly closely related to the parental 

* 

average. Non-significant correlation coefficients of O.3OO and 
0.6lb respectively were obtained. (See figure 13). The lack 
of significance is probably due to the limited number of ccm- 
par isons available. The closeness of the relation between the F2 
and F^ hybrid yields and the parental average, and the relative 
positions of the F 2 and F^ hybrid yields and the parental average

are shown graphically in Figure 14. The results for Pacific Blue- 
stem and 482B appear to exhibit a striking exception to the general 
trend, which suggests that crosses from parents having a low yield 
themselves tend to yield poorly.

Immer ( 18 ) , working with barley hybrids, has shown that 
a progressive reduction in yield took place for the F 2 , ^3 and ^4 
generations. In the present study, eight crosses occurring in the 
test of hard wheat hybrids were present in the F 2 , F 3 and F 4 genera¬ 
tions. The results in Table XXV, despite minor inconsistencies, 
show hybrid vigor for yield in all three generations. The F 2 and 
Fj , on the average, have yielded the same, but the F 4 has given a 
greater yield. Expressed in per cent of the parental average, the 
figures for the F 2 , F^ , and F 4 generations are 103, 103 and 110 
per cent respectively* With a comparison of ten crosses the F^

was found to exceed the F^ by three per cent. The F 2 hybrid yield 
was found to be closely related to the parental average as indicated 
by a highly significant correlation coefficient of 0.822. The Fj 
hybrid yield was less closely related to the parental average as 
indicated by a coefficient of 0 . 691 , which is significant beyond 
the five per cent point. A poorer relationship existed between 
the hybrid yield and the parental average. A non-significant 
coefficient of 0.656 was obtained. The foregoing relationships 
are shown in Figure 13* Figure 13 illustrates graphically the 
tendency for the low-yielding parents to produce low yielding 
offspring. A progressive reduction in yield for successive 
generations in barley hybrids ( 18 ) is not supported by the present 
results. It would appear that the high yielding segregates 
have begun to predominate in the populations of the F 4 generation. 
The fact that the and F 4 generation hybrids are progressively 
less closely related to the parental average than the F 0 seems 
to indicate that differential segregation is taking place.

Herliness . 

Taylor (32) and Darroch (6) are among the many workers who 
have demonstrated a close relationship "between yield and maturity* 
Florell, and Clark and Hooker, cited by Taylor (32), found that 
earliness was dominant in the Fg and F^ generations. Taylor’s 
results show that all but a few F^ hybrid populations headed and 
matured earlier than the parental average* 

The only results obtained in the present study to 
indicate earliness were "days to heading". Taylor (32) is among 
others who have repeatedly demonstrated a close relationship 
between "days to heading" and "days to maturity". It may, there¬ 
fore, be concluded that days to heading is a good indication of 
maturity. 

The results in Table XXVI show that all hybrid populations, 
regardless of generation, are earlier than the parental average. 

The hard wheat single crosses appear to become progressively 
earlier as homozygosity is reached. * 3 uch a condition is not in 
agreement with the 1942 results (32). 

The writer has repeatedly observed that high, yield has 
been accompanied by late maturity.* It has already been shown 
(Table XXV) that the single cross F4 hard wheat hybrids yielded 
more, in bushels per acre, than the same Fg or *3 populations, 
yet Table XXVI shows these same F4 hybrids to be earlier than the 
F 2 or F^ populations. It is the writer’s belief that since 1943 
was a year which favored early maturing varieties, early maturing

segregates have begun to predominate in the populations as

maturity plays in determining yield emphasizes the need for 
results of more than one year f s testing.

The figures for crosses were obtained by averaging the 
six crosses in which one particular variety was a common parent. 

The parental figures are simply those results obtained for the 
individual parents. An example may clarify the situation. The 
Red Bobs figure for crosses is an average of the results obtained 
for the crosses in which Red Bobs is combined with the other six 
varieties. The result for Red Bobs alone is indicated in the 
line for parents- 

For each character illustrated in Figure 16 the varieties 
are arranged in decreasing magnitude of the cross average. This 
arr angement facil itates the observation of the value of various 
parents. Late varieties are favored by such an arrangement and 
this should be taken into consideration in a study of the Figure. 
Late maturing varieties are not necessarily most desirable.

Considerable information is contained in Figure 16. 

With the exception of ’’yield in bushels per acre Fg”, Lutesoens 
consistently places first and Reward always last. As mentioned 
earlier, the yield of late maturing varieties in the Special Fg 
test was seriously affected by incomplete filling. This is clearly 
evident in Figure 16 . In support of the findings of Taylor ( 32 ) 
the results for parental varieties appear to be a valuable indica¬ 
tion of their combining ability. There is no indication of excep¬ 
tional parents, i.e. those parents capable of producing an unusually 
high percentage of superior selections in their offspring (11). 

There is considerable evidence of hybrid vigor and although 
the hybrid average is exceeded by the parent for some varieties, 
it should be remembered that the figure for the hybrid is an 
average of six, while that of the parent is an individual result. 

$aite aside from the combining ability of parents, the 
interrelationship of characters is illustrated in Figure 16. 

The association of height, number of tillers, yield and maturity 
is not only outstanding, but consistent throughout. Lutesoens 
is tall, late, high yielding and tillers well. Reward is short, 
early, low yielding and produces only a few tillers. Yield 
alone cannot safely be used as the criterion to judge the 
value of a parent. A valuable parent is one which combines a 
maximum number of desirable with a minimum of undesirable characters. 
The interrelationship is not only complex, but variable* One 
character may be decidedly important one year and relatively in¬ 
significant another.

The use of bulk hybrid yield tests as a basis for dis¬ 
carding certain crosses has been advocated by several workers 
( 11 , 13, 18 ) on the assumption that the proportion of high yield¬ 
ing genotypes in the low-yielding crosses will be less than in 
crosses with a higher average 3rield. The results of the present 
investigation and of the studjr by Taylor ( 32 ) have demonstrated 
that hybrid populations differ greatly in yield. If one is to 
consider that yield alone is the most desirable character, then 
it seems possible to conclude that at least a rough evaluation of 
hybrid populations could be made on the basis of yield. Perhaps a 
greater number of genot^rpes could be taken from the high yielding 
cros ses. 

It seems imperative that any evaluation of yield must 
be based on not less than two years 1 testing. Environment plays 
a large part in determining the complex called "yield". Hybrid 
populations or varieties favored by a set of conditions one year 
may be equally retarded by another set of conditions the next year. 
Among a multiplicity of characters, yield is affected by maturity 
and straw strength, as was illustrated by the results of the hard 
wheat hybrid yield test in 1943 . Little relationship between 
these results and the results for 1942 indicates that the results 
for either year must be treated with caution. The fact that the 
results of a whole year’s testing-may be rendered invalid by . 
environmental conditions suggests that conclusions should, be based 
on several tests. Accepting this, bulk hybrid yield tests immediate¬ 
ly fall into the category of rod-row tests and are therefore subject

to the same limitations such as labor and cost of handling* 
furthermore, the amount of seed available is a factor usually- 
limiting the extensiveness of bulk hybrid tests. It has been 
suggested (32) that, in addition to the possibility of obtaining 
sufficient seed for a fully replicated yield test, if the bulk 
hybrids were allowed to segregate in the F^ an ^ yield tests con¬ 
ducted in the F^ and F^ generations, a more accurate evaluation 
of the hybrids as a source of high yielding segregates might be 
obtained. Yield tests of the F^ and F^ would be less complicated 
by hybrid vigor and the yields obtained would represent to a 
greater degree the actual yields of the segregates themselves. 

There remain, nevertheless, the problems of mixing when handling 
and loss of vitality during storage. To provide comparable material 
not only should there be sufficient seed for one year’s test, but 
also enough for two or three tests. 

The following extract from a paper by Worzella (37) 
clearly demonstrates that yield alone cannot be taken as a criterion 
of the value of a variety: 

"Because of the varied demands for wheats and their products, 

'the objectives cannot be static but must be ever changing. 

Our aim is, not only a stable wheat crop, but also one that 
is more uniform and superior in quality to our present wheats. 

We do not want varieties that produce large crops some years 
and failures in others, but rather those that are able to 
resist the rigors of hard winters, drought, delayed harvests, 
etc., and that produce a uniform crop. Since wheat is the 
raw material that goes into the production of many foods 
and other products, new varieties must be "built up” to 
meet the requirements of these specific demands.” 

Bulk hybrid yield tests obviously have little place 


in the development of these varieties

studies on hybrid vigor are not new. Many workers 
(7, 8, 28 , 30 , 32 ) have reported the presence of hybrid vigor in 
cereals, and such a factor must obviously be considered in the present 
study* Varying amounts of vigor or lack of vigor have been found* 

In general the results of the present study agree fairly well with 
the findings of others in that hybrid vigor is lost as homozygosity 
is reached. There appears to be a tendency for those crosses with 
the greatest amount of hybrid vigor in the F^ to. have the greatest 
reduction in yield in the F^» Such a condition emphasizes that 
results of bulk hybrid yield tests should be interpreted with 
caution* 

It has previousljr been mentioned that certa in w orkers 
(10, 23 , 31 ) have found that the yields of varieties in mixed 
stands are not necessarily correlated with those of the same 
varieties grown separately. If such findings are accepted, the 
limitation of bulk progeny yield tests to determine the value of a 
particular cross is immediately apparent. Advocates of this method 
commonly assume that the forces of natural selection which favor 
the perpetuation of plants that are best fitted to survive in the 
hybrid mixtures will likewise sort out the types that will yield 
best when gro¥;n alone. High yielding populations may not, therefore, 
be the ones which will eventually produce a high percentage of 
superior segregates. If, however, the undesired types are being 
eliminated by such adverse factors as cold, disease or suscepti¬ 
bility to insect attack, then the plants which survive in the 
hybrid mixtures will, in all probability, be the ones which are 
most capable of giving good yields when grown alone. 

Artificial selection cannot be practiced on hybrid 
populations in yield tests,otherwise the plant breeder defeats

the purpose for which they were intended. The writer is firmly 
convinced that modern plant breeding methods should select for 
resistance'to disease and insects as well as drought and cold. 
Quality, strength of straw, and other desirable agronomic characters 
should also be sought in segregating populations. The mass - 
pedigree method advocated by Harrington ( 12 ) may be utilized ad¬ 
vantageously. Waldron ( 34 ) has suggested a positive relation 
between frost resistance and drought resistance. This relation 
is now being utilized in seme breeding-programs and appears to 
hold considerable promise for the selection of superior varieties. 

An important aim of the present study has been to deter¬ 
mine, if possible, the relative value of multiple cross hybrids. 
There is evidence that six and eight-variety crosses in the 
hard wheats and double crosses in the soft wheats have retained 
their hybrid vigor better than single crosses. It may be that 
there has been a high concentration of desirable characters in 
these multiple crosses to form a more stable -unit. It is thought 
that, within reasonable limits, multiple crosses may be a good 
source of valuable segregates. 

Taylor ( 32 ) has emphasized the importance of having 
crosses complete to facilitate the study of the combining ability 
of parents. In the present study, twenty-one crosses were avail¬ 
able, involving seven varieties in all possible combinations. 
Varieties differed,in their combining ability as measured by 
the characters: yield, number of tillers, height and days to 
heading. The importance of balancing the various attributes of 
a variety in determining its combining ability is clearly demon¬ 


strated.

SUMMA.HT 


This oontinuation of a study to determine the behaviour 
of single and multiple hybrid populations in early generations, 
as a basis for discarding low yielding crosses, has utilized 
a large number of hard and soft wheat bulk populations in repli¬ 
cated yield tests. 

Yield levels for 1942 and 1943 were similar but in 
other comparisons there was considerable disparity. Results for 
the two years 1 tests of soft wheat hybrids were more closely 
related than those for the hard wheat hybrids. 

Hybrid vigor for yield was not so consistent in 1943 
as in 1942* The average for all hybrid populations showed hybrid 
vigor for maturity. Six and eight-variety hard wheat hybrids 
and double cross soft wheat hybrids appeared most capable of 
retaining their hybrid vigor for yield, indicating the possibility 
that these crosses might be a good source of high yielding 
segregates. 

For a limited number of hard and soft wheat single 
crosses, the F^ on the average yielded less than the Fg. The 
few F^ hard wheat single crosses available gave yields greater 
than either the F^ or F^ generations. 

Only very slight relations existed between the hybrid 
populations and their parental averages. While some fairly 
close relationships were found for a few groups of crosses, it 
can hardly be concluded that the parental average is a good 
indication of the value of a cross. 

The yield of a variety appears to be a good indication 
of its combining ability. 3uch other factors as height, number of

tillers and maturity should not be overlooked in the determina¬ 
tion of the value of a variety. 

Even if the disparity in the results obtained for two 
years T testing of a large number of single and multiple hybrid 
populations is ignored, it is thought that the use of yield tests 
of unseleoted bulk populations in early generations as a basis 
for discarding those crosses which will eventually give only 
a few high-yielding segregates, has no place in a modern plant 
breeding program.

very difficult to recognize the most valuable segregates in this 
large mass of material. A cross is made between two varieties 
in the hope of getting something superior in yield, drought 
resistance, etc. , and this is possible only when the characters 
can be recognized and measured accurately. 

The relationship between stomatal size (length) and 
yield has been studied for seven parental varieties and twenty- 
one hybrid populations. If the assumptions of Birdsall (2) 
and Darroch (6) are correct, it should be possible to eliminate 
poor yielding lines from hybrid populations on the basis of 
stomatal size. Undoubtedly.this assumption would be true if 
there were any "best 11 stomatal size. It is true that varieties 
differ in their stomatal size, but the relation between stomatal 
size and yield is not constant. 

Selection for yield on the basis of protein content 
should be a valuable aid to the plant breeder* Notwithstanding 
minor discrepancies, Neatby and McCalla (22) concluded from a 
study of the relation between protein and yield that the differences 
are remarkably constant from station to station. They suggest that 
selection for protein content can be undertaken at any.one station 


with confidence.

In contrast to stomatal size, there appears to he an 
optimum protein content above or below which hybrid lines may be 
discarded. The high protein lines yield poorly, while the low 
protein lines, regardless of yield, are inferior in quality. 

The measuring of protein content is a relatively simple procedure, 
but cannot be done until sufficient seed is available. If there 
were a- satisfactory relationship between stomatal size and yield, 
selection could be made on the basis of single plants. For a 
reliable test, however, the plants should be homozygous so that 
even if there were a satisfactory relationship only one year 
would be saved. 

It is possible that a few hybrid lines would behave in 
an irregular manner with regard to protein content. These would 
be apparent on a correlation surface and could be dealt with 
individually. Where a relationship between stomatal size and 
yield cannot be used, protein content should serve a useful 
purpose. The plant breeder should have little hesitation, 
after subjecting hybrid populations to diseases, insects, cold, 
etc., to further reduce the surviving lines on the basis of protein 
content, Stomatal size has no such value. 

Replicated yield tests of a large number of unselected 
bulk populations of hard and soft wheat hybrids were conducted 
in the field to permit a study of the behaviour of single and 
multiple crosses in early generations. It was hoped that the 
results obtained would give information regarding the potential 
value of these crosses as sources of high-yielding segregates. 

Hybrid populations differed in their ability to yield, 
and it is considered by several workers ( 11 , 13, l 8 )-that these

di-fferences may be used to indicate the potential yielding 
possibilities of a cross. As is suggested by Taylor ( 32 ), for 
prediction purposes a rough classification might be set up in 
which the unselected bulk populations could be placed in three 
groups, namely, promising, average and unpromising* 

There are, however, many limitations to the use of 
yield alone in evaluating hybrid populations. The complexities 
of yield are recognized (3, 4, 23 , 36, 37). There exists, in 
addition, the fact that natural selection among varieties sown 
in*mixed stands does not always favor the varieties that give the 
higher grain yields when sown alone under the same conditions 

(10, 23, 31), 

An extensive study by the writer* of varietal changes in 
wheat, oats, barley and flax has revealed that in recent years 
new varieties nearly always possess disease or other resistance. 
Yield tests of bulk populations eliminate the possibility of 
practising artificial selection and, therefore, greatly retard 
the recognition of superior segregates. The aim of the modern 
plant breeder is to produce a variety which is able to resist 
the rigors of weather, diseases, insects, etc. Yield tests of 
bulk populations cannot be considered a satisfactory method of 
selecting those crosses which will eventually give a high percentage 
of superior segregates.

Aids to the Measurement of Stomata 







97 - 


Aim TO THE ul 

I. An improved microscope slide. 

In studies of stomatal size (length) and frequency, 
Birdsall (2) made use of 8 x 4 cm* slides on which the leaves 
were held by means of thin cardboard of the same dimensions, glued 
to one edge of the slide. In the centre of the cardboard a 
hole one centimeter in diameter was cut, thus exposing a portion 
•of the leaf. These slides were found to have a number of dis¬ 
advantages. The slide had to be removed from the micio scope 
stage each time a new leaf was examined. Very often considerable 
time was lost in an attempt to get the leaf in position. This 
was especially true of seedling leaves. 

A slide which facilitated the more rapid handling of 
leaves was developed. It consisted of an ordinary micio scope 
slide to which a number 2 Owl paper clip was fastened by cellulose 
tape. Instead of removing the slide from the stage of the 
microscope each time a new leaf was required, the leaf was 
slipped under the clip while the slide remained in position. 

This allowed a considerable saving of time, with the added 
advantage that twisted or curled leaves and leaves of any size 
(see Figure l) could be handled with relative ease. Very little 
focal adjustment was necessary since the leaf surface was 
constantly held flat. An improvement* consisting of the use of 
waterproof adhesive tape instead of the cellulose tape (which 
has a tendencjr to wrinkle when wet) was adopted.

Improved microscope slide adapted 
for leaves of various sizes#

It is the writer’s opinion that this slide or a 
modifioation of it has a definite place in studies where 
material of this or a similar nature is examined under the 
microscope# 

II. A rapid method of identifying collected leaves . 

The collection and examination of a great many leaves 
in as short a time as possible necessitated a speedy as well as 
accurate method of identifying them. Such a method is here 
describ ed. 

Numbers identifying the leaves are written on thin 
strips of paper. As the leaves are removed, they are placed 
with the tip beside their respective number and fixed there 
with a 3/8 inch strip of cellulose tape. (see figure 2.) The 
numbers are clearly visible through cellulose tape. When a 
"batch** has been obtained it is rolled up, with the numbers 
facing outward, starting with the highest number. This makes 
possible the orderly removal of leaves when stomatal measurements 
are made. 

It is thought that this method of handling leaves has a 
very useful application in these and similar studies.

Tests of Stage and Position, 








101 


TEjTo uF JTAGE Ai\D POSITION . 

The stage of plant development at the time leaves are 
taken for stomatal measurements, and the position on the leaf 
at which readings are made, are important considerations. 

Birdsall (2) measured the stomata of the first or seedling 
leaf when plants were in the third leaf stage: of the flag-leaf 
when the plants had just headed, and of the subterminal leaf 
when the plants were in the shot blade or just heading. He 
made his determinations at a position near the base of the leaf, 
but Darroch (6) took a trans-leaf sample within 1*5 to 2 inches 
of the leaf tip. Darroch reasoned that the leaf tip is the region 
where differentiation, maturation, and chlorophyll syntheses are 
first completed, and would therefore seem to be the most suitable 
region upon which to base varietal comparisons. That such 
reasoning is sound is not disputed, but it has been the writer’s 
experience that a higher percentage of abnormally large or 
abnormally small stomata occur near the leaf tip. The stomata 
occur in rows parallel to the veins of the leaf, and since 
there is a tapering off towards the tip, some rows are terminated, 
while others continue to the tip. Not all the rows can be 
crowded in the narrow space at the leaf tip. 

For the studies reported in Part I of this thesis an 
intermediate course with regard to position was followed. All 
measurements of stomata on seedling leaves were made by taking 
a trans-leaf sample at about the centre of the leaf. All seedling 
leaves were taken from plants in the 3 to 4-leaf stage and all 
flag leaves were taken when the head was 2 inches out of .the "boot”.

Although the position and stages just mentioned were 
used throughout the entire investigation, a few small tests were 
conducted to determine, if possible, whether these were satis¬ 
factory or not. Three such tests are dealt with briefly in 
the sections which follow. 

I* Experiment to determine proper stage at which seedling leaves 
should be taken. 

Flats of Ganus and Thatcher seedlings, two varieties 
differing markedly in maturity and stomatal size, were grown 
in the greenhouse in January 1942. Six typical plants were 
selected from each of these varieties for observations of stomatal 
size at various stages of growth. Measurements were begun 
as soon as the seedling leaves were sufficiently well developed, 
and continued, using the same leaves and the same relative posi¬ 
tion on the leaves, until they had shrivelled and died. Notes 
as to the length of the seedling leaf were recorded when the 
stomata were measured as well as the stage of plant development* 

A trans-leaf sample of ten stomata per leaf was taken on each 
date for each leaf. Results of the experiment and the analyses 
of variance are presented in Tables I and II.

The apparent fluctuation in stomatal size for January 
12 th and 14 th might have been due to error in measuring. It has 
been noticed that difference in lighting can affect the accuracy 
of recordings. The lighting in this experiment was not controlled 
•However, the results presented appear to indicate that once the 
seedling leaf is fully developed the stomatal size remains re¬ 
latively constant. This is true regardless of the stage of 
plant development, since on the first date the second leaf was 
just appearing while on the last the fourth was visible. The 
experiment was terminated when the seedling leaf began to turn 
yellow. It is suggested that within reasonable limits the 
size of stomata on a seedling leaf is little affected by stage 
of plant development. 

II# Experiment to determine proper stage at which flag leaves 
should be taken and whether stomatal size varies with 
different positions on the leaf# 

Flag leaves of Bed Bobs border material, growing close 
to Test 3 ? (see Part I of thesis) were taken from plants at 
three stages of development. Duplicate leaves were taken from 
plants at each stage. Stomatal measurements, twenty at each 
position, were made i m mediately for three trans-leaf positions 
on each leaf. The various stages and positions are shown in 
Table III. After the leaves had been placed in the "cold room” 
for some time, the measuring was repeated. As might be expected, 
the stomata were found to be uniformly larger (longer), since 
the guard cells elongate when the pore is closed. 

For the analysis of variance (Table III) and the results 


(Table IV) the direct and after cold chamber readings were

the leaf at which the stomata are measured. The stomata are 
slightly smaller when the head is just emerging. Flag leaves 
were never collected at this stage, however. The stomata at 
the extremities of the leaf appear to be more variable, lending 
support to the choice of mid-leaf measurements. 

III. Experiment to determine whether stomata on various tillers 
of the same plant differ in size. 

In Test 3 particularly, where the plants had tillered 
profusely, it was often difficult to determine accurately which 
was the main culm. To get some indication as to whether the 
flag leaf stomata on the tillers differed in size from those on 
the main culm, five leaves were taken from the tillers of each 
of five plants of Red Bobs. For all but the youngest tiller, 
the spikes were well out of the boot, a stage comparable to 
that when measurements would normally be made. Only the 
youngest tiller had smaller stomata. This tiller would never 
be mistaken for the main culm. It is therefore concluded that 
if the leaf from a tiller greatly resembling the main culm were 
taken accidently, no real error would be encountered. 

Realizing the danger of basing conclusions on single 
small tests it is, nevertheless, felt that the exploratory 
experiments here reported for stage and position are indicative 
of, variations which actually occur. The three leaf stage appears 
to be most satisfactory for seedling leaf determinations, while 
a stage when the flag leaf is well out of the boot is best for 
flag leaf determinations. In either case, a trans-mid-1 eaf 
sample has advantages.

APPENDIX "C" 

A Mass Crossing Test# 








- 107 - 


A IlkM CROSSING TEST. 


Preliminary emasoulations in 1940 , with subsequent 
open pollination in buffer rows of Red Bobs, produced seed sets 
of approximately 50 per cent on the average. Since emasculation 
may be achieved with relative ease and rapidity, it was thought 
that a "mass” crossing scheme might produce Fp seed in fairly 
large quantity. Large populations are highly desirable for 
various studies, and methods to obtain them have been sought 
by several workers. Suneson and Riddle ( 30 ) have used male 
sterility to obtain F^ populations for studies on hybrid vigor 
in barley. The lf approaeh method 1 ’ described by Rosenquist (27) 
has been found useful where a large F^_ populations of wheat or 
barley is required. A search through the literature, however, 
did not reveal any method similar to the one described below. 

The same seven varieties described in Part I of this 
thesis were used in the present investigation* Erythio was 
chosen as . the male or pollen parent because it is easily dis-^ 
tinguishedo To avoid contamination by foreign pollen, the test 
was well isolated from other wheat* 

The six varieties chosen as female parents, i.e. those 
to be emasculated, were arranged in six series or replicates. 
Each variety appeared twice in each series in single rows, 12 
feet long and 9 inches apart. A blank space 18 inches wide 
wqs left between each pair of rows to facilitate handling. Six 
plantings of Erythro were made at four day intervals, the rows 
being between and beside each two rows in a series, thus allows

ing only a 4^ inch space between male and female parents* fwo 
plantings of Erythro were made before the other varieties were 
planted. On the date of the third seeding the female parent 
material for all series was planted together with a planting of 
Erythro.* This method allowed for ample Erythro pollen to be 
present, regardless of the maturity of the female parent. 

Erythro was the only variety which was allowed to flower# 

Owing to the pressure of other crossing work it became 
necessary to abandon this method before a maximum amount of 
seed could be obtamed. Early observations on the number of 
seeds set were not in the least encouraging, but at harvest 
time the percentage seed set was found to be good. In other 
words, a test which appeared at one time to be an almost certain 
failure proved to be a reasonable success. The small amount’ 
of seed obtained was grown in separate plots in 1942 and critically 
examined for "seifs’ 1 , but none were found, indicating favorable 
possibilities for the method. 

The relative value of such a method of producing large 
quantities of Fp seed necessarily depends, to a considerable 
extent, on the amount of natural crossing within the varieties 
involved*. Various workers have studied natural crossing in 
wheat (15, 20) and barley (2b, 29) and the question needs no 
discussion here. 

Allowing for certain difficulties, which might possibly 
be overcome, the writer is convinced that the mass crossing 
method herein described warrants further consideration where large 
Fp populations are desired. It is suggested, however, that the 
number of varieties should be limited since considerable work is
