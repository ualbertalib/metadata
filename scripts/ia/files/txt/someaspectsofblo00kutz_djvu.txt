Some aspects of the blood and tissue 
chemistry of the foetal calf, 192£. 







































SOKS ASPSGTS OP TES BLOOD AMD TISSUE UHBMISTRY 
OF THE FOETAL CALF. 


The chemistry of the blood and tissues of embryos has not been 

very extensively studied. Most of the work reported has been carried 

out on the human foetus and in this case one must of necessity use 

blood which has been taken at birth. It was thought that a more 

detailed study could be made by using calf foetuses as they can be 

obtained at all stages of development. 

For this piece of work foetal calves were obtained from the 

abbatoir during the slaughter of adult female cattle. The removal 

of the uterus would take place about fifteen minutes after death. 

Because of this, asphyxia developed in the foetus before the blood 

could be obtained. This factor caused considerable change in some 

27 

of the chemical constituents of the blood as shown by Oollip 

The foetuses examined ranged in length from three to one hundred 
and twenty-two centimeters. Observations were made on the following 
constituents of blood, spinal fluid, and amniotie fluid:- calcium 
of serum, spinal fluid, and amniotie fluid; inorganic and acid 
soluble phosphorus of whole blood, serum, spinal fluid, and 
amniotie fluid; urea nitrogen and non-protein nitrogen of whole 
blood, serum, spinal fluid, and amniotie fluid; amino-acid nitrogen 
of whole blood; creatinine, creatine, uric acid, and cholesterol 
of whole blood; chlorides of whole blood, serum, spinal fluid, 
and amniotie fluid; serum albumin and serum globulin; sugar of whole 
blood and spinal fluid; carbon dioxide combining power and hydrogen 
ion concentration of serun. Tissue analyses were carried out for gly-

ooge n and water content# 

A few determinations were also mad© on the whole "blood and serum of 
cows for comparative purposes. 

Heyieof the_Literatur©,- 

Bogert and Plass~ found the average value for foetal serum 

calcium at "birth was somewhat higher than that of the mother. 

and that the maternal serum calcium was slightly lower than the 

normal for non-pregnant women. The magnesium content was the 

same in both foetal and maternal serum* 

Z 

Hellmuth has found that foetal serum always contains more 

calcium than maternal serum. 

& 

Blass and Tompkins determined the distribution of phos¬ 
phoric acid compounds in the serum of the mother and foetus. 

Lipoid phosphorus was found to increase above the iralue for 
normal women»at the time of delivery, and practically no lipoid 
phosphorus was present in the foetal serum. Inorganic and organic 
phosphorus were higher in the foetus, probably to give the 

optimum conditions for bone formation. 

4 

Hess and Matzner found the inorganic phosphorus of foetal 
blood to be consistently higher than that of the mother,but 
they found very little if any difference between the maternal 

and foetal sera. 

c 

Km von Oettingeri h s demonstrated a higher coneentrati on 
of chlorides, inorganic phosphorus, sodium, potassium, and amino- 
acids in foetel blood than in that from the mother. He has also 
found creatinine to be the same in both.

Men&eleeff^ found that the rate of cellular growth of embryonic 

guinea pig tissue cultures depends on the reaction of the medium, 

and that proliferation increased with decreasing 

7 

Slemons and Morrise carried out non-protein nitrogen and urea 
determinations on the blood of foetuses at birth and on blood taken 
from the mother at the same time. They found that in normal cases 
the values were practically the same in both mother and foetus. An 
increase in the maternal urea due to any of the toxaemias of preg¬ 
nancy gave a corresponding increase in the foetal blood urea. Ad¬ 
ministration of chloroform during pregnancy gave an increase 
primarily in the foetax urea and, if prolonged, also in the maternal 
urea. Asphyxia caused an increase in the urea content of foetal 
blood. 

Howe and Si veils studied the non-protein nitrogen and urea 

nitrogen of foetal and maternal blood. They found no consistent 
difference. In many cases they were the same in both mother and 
foetus. Uric acid was found to be slightly increased in parturient 
women* Sugar also increased due to the anaesthetic and muscular 
contractions. 

Morse 9 stated that the amino-acids in the blood remained 
normal during pregnancy, pre-eclamptic toxaemia, eclampsia, and 
nephritic toxaemia, but slight rises were encountered in some 
cases of obscure toxaemia, possibly related to acute yellow 
atrophy of the liver. The average value for the amino-acid 
nitrogen of foetal blood was slightly higher than that of the 
mother# 

Plass and Matthew 19 found that amino-acids and non-protein 
nitrogen were consistently higher in foetal serum and whole blood 
than in that of the mother. Many previous investigators

h.d not found this to be true and had concluded simple diffusion 
of these substances took place through the placenta. Urea and uric 
acid were found to be the same on either side of the placenta. 

Plaes*^ carried out an lyses for creatinine and creatine 
on samples of blood taken simultaneously from mother and foetus 
at the time of delivery. The determinations were made on serum 
or pi sraa as these are re lly the fluids concerned with placental 
interchange. Creatinine and oreatin were the same in the plasmas 
of both mother an foetus and they were the same as those found 
in non-pregnant women.- 

IE 

Hunter and Campbell stated tir t the creatinine and creatine 
were the same in maternal plasma as in the foetal. A slight rise 
of ere tinine was found during parturition in primiparous women. 

The creatin content of foetal whole blood wag slightly higher than 
maternal even though the concentration in corpuscles and plasma 
is the same in both. Pregnancy seemed to cause the storing of 
ere* tine in the corpuscles. 

Ungsbury and Sedgwick; have shown that at the time o 
birth uric acid was the sane on both sides of the pi oenta* 

There was an increase during th© first few & *ys after birth and 
then - decrease by the fifth day. 

Siemens and Bogert*^ have reported that uric acid of the 
blood remains norm 1 during uncomplicated pregnancy but it may 
increase to quite a great extent in cases of syphilis,nephritis, 
eclampsia, and other toxaemias of pregnancy, and there may even be 
a alight increase during r normal labour in primiprrious women. 

Slemons and Curtis 1 ^ have found th ,t the cholesterol con-

tent of foetal and m torn* 1 blood was practically the same at the 
end of gestation* They found a hypercholesterolemia beginning 
about the fifth month when the metabolism of fats bee me active 
in the foetus* 

Slemone and Stander^ found the fat content of nr tern 1 
blood to be much higher and seemingly independent of the foetal 
blood* On account of this lecithin and cholesterol were found 
in larger quantities in maternal blood* The greater part of 
the cholesterol present in foetal blood was found to be free* 

Ho significant change was found in lipoids during eclampsia 
or other toxaemias of pregnancy* 

17 

Plast: and Matthew have found that the total protein, 
the albumin, globulin and fibrin were.uniformly higher in 
maternal th t l foetal blood* in the e- se of it 

was found that the albumin decreased and the fibrin increased* 

TO 

Morrise found that ,he values for blood sugar remained normal 
during pregnancy and the first stage of labour, but there was 
a slight increase during the second stage due to muscular con¬ 
tractions and it was accentuated by an anaesthetic# In the e se 
of norm 1 foetuses the blood sugar at the moment of delivery 

w _s slightly lower than in the maternal circulation* 

19 

Aron determined the sugar content of the blood of guinea 
pig embryos of various sizes. He found a Very great difference 
between that and the sugar content of the mother’s blood until 
near (full term* He also did a few determinations on foe t 1 calf 
blood and found them lower than th t of the mother but with not so 
gre t a difference as that existing in i he c se of the guinea pig#

Rowley' reported the fact that the blood sugar on the foetal 
side of the placenta at birth was lower than that on the maternal 
side. He also stated that muscular contractions did not affect the 

level of the blood sugar, differing in this respect from the findings 

„ „ . 18 
oi Morriss • 

Burgess" 4 carried out blood sugar determinations on the blood 
from mother and foetus* In four out of ei^: cases the sugar was 
slightly higher in the maternal blood* 

I 2° 

Kellmuth J ~ reported that foetal blood sugar is always lower 
at birth than that of the mother 9 but is dependent on it* 

Grogoberidize"' carried out glycogen determinations on rabbit 

. 

foetuses and on various organs of the mother# "The glycogen content 
of the embryo increased to the twenty-eighth day after which there 
was a decrease* The muscles contained the most glycogen* The gly¬ 
cogen of the placenta and uterus increased for a time during preg- 
;nancy during which time the maternal liver glycogen decreased* At 
parturition the placenta was practically glycogen free while the 
muscles of the uterus had a high glycogen content. 

jgyj 

Ologne, ,7a lti, and Pi chon found the amount of glycogen 

present in the foetal liver increased from 1*8 gm* in the third 
month of pregnancy to 29.5 gm* in the ninth month* During the same 
time the glycogen in the placenta decreased from £♦? gm* to 0,6 gm* 

at full term* 

26 

I iiemiel and Le avenworth found that in the case of the pig 

embryo the glycogen content of the muscle increased with the age 
of the foetus and that it reached a value over one per cent at 
full term* They also found that the liver did not assume its

Stand or an:! Tyl or have found th tt that the moisture con¬ 
tent of maternal blood increased to the seventh month of preg¬ 
nancy after which it remained constant or decreased slightly* 

The moisture of the whole blood was higher in the mother than 
the foetus. The ash of the maternal and foetal plasma was ex¬ 
actly the same, thus indicating the free exch.nge of inorganic 
substances through the placenta*

Discussion of Results : 

The calcium and phosphorus content of foetal calf blood was 
found to be *uch higher than expected. At birth a normal foetus 
has a calcium content slightly higher than the normal average for 
adults. This may be seen in Table 1. where the calcium values for 
calves two and three hours and even two days old, range from one 
to two milligrams higher than for the adults. This fact was re¬ 
ported by Bogert and Plass ^ when studying the human foetus. 
However the calcium for the foetal calf serum averaged about four 
milligrams higher then cow’s serum. 

The inorganic and acid soluble phosphorus values were much 
higher in the case of the foetus, whereas one might expect only 
slightly higher values than those for the mother. Plass and 
Tompkins ^ found that the acid soluble and inorganic phosphorus 
were higher in the foetus but the total phosphorus was higher in 
the mother due to the much larger amount of lipoid phosphorus. 

It was found that asphyxia, caused the abnormally high values for 
calcium and phosphorus in the foetal calf serum. 

As shown by Collip 27 there is a decrease in blood volume 
with asphyxia and as there is practically no calcium in the cells 
this might account for the increase in calcium, otherwise there 
must be an actual mobilization of calcium and phosphorus from some 
source in the body. The former does not seem so probable because 
in the case of the calf foetus there cannot be much decrease in 
blood volume because the average for ten esses gave only twenty- 
eight percent cells while the average for the blood of ten cowrs 
gave forty-two percent cells. 





- 24 - 


There is also a decrease in in the foetal blood, caused 
by asphyxia * When taken for a large number, the £3 of foetal calf 

bloods averaged 0.42 lower than for the adult, The carbon dioxide 

26 

combining power was also less du© to the acidosis. Blair Bell 
and his co-workers reported that the Pg was lower and the lactic 
acid content higher in human foetal blood than in that from the 


mother. The blood was drawn from ths umbilical vessels, and it seems 
quite possible that there may have been enough asphyxia of the blood 
to give these changes, as he finds that in eases of Caesarean operation 
the difference is not so great. He also found the lower alkali reserve. 
During the course of this work, an experiment was carried out 
on a female dog carrying foetuses of almost full term. After being 
anaesthetised, an operation was performed to expose the uterus. Blood 
was drawn directly from the foetuses contained in one arm of the uterus. 
The other arm was ligated and the foetuses asphyxiated for twenty 
minutes, after which blood was drawn from each* 

The average values for the determinations carried out were as 
follows

The average value for the cholesterol content of the foetal blood was 
about 30 mgs./lOOc.c. less than that of the mother. 

This experiment would lead one to believe that the calcium and 
inorganic phosphorus of the normal dog foetus is higher than that

of the mother and that this difference is accentuated by asphyxia. 

The average calcium content of the cerebral spinal fluid of 
the foetal calf was about one half that of serum. In the case of 
amniotic fluid the ©alcium values varied over a great range. It 
was thought that this variation might in some way be related to 
the degree of calcification of th© placenta, go more were done, 
but it vms found that even in these eases the calcium values var¬ 
ied greatly. 

The inorganic and acid soluble phosphorus were nearer the 
same in the spinal and amniotic fluids than in blood, thus 
showing that less organic phospio rus is present. This is also 
true of serum. 

The Pishe and Subbarow, and Briggs methods were compared 
when doing inorganic phosphorus determinations. Almost identical 
results were obtained. 

Ion-protein nitrogen was consistently higher in foetal blood 
than in that of the adult, although th© average values for urea 
of whole blood were almost the same in both. Most of the difference 
can be accounted for from the fact that amino-acids exist in much 
larger quantities in th© foetal blood. The average was practically 
twice that of th© adult. As amino-acids are important in building 
the foetal organism, it seems to show a selective absorption of 
some sort on the part of the placenta or excessive manufacture of 
ajaino-aeids in the foetus. 

Urea nitrogen did not vary much between whole blood, serum, 
spinal fluid and amniotic fluid, Plass and Matthew^ have re¬ 
ported higher values of amino-acids and non-protein nitrogen in 

9 5 

the human foetus than in the mother. Morse" and II. von Oettingen

have also found the aminoxacid content of foetal blood slightly higher 
than maternal blood* 

That asphyxia causes an increase in blood urea is claimed by 
7 

Siemens and Morriss • This does not seem to take place in the foetal 

calf as the values for urea were no higher than in the blood of the adult. 

"'hers seemed to be nothing unusual about the creatinine, creatine, 

or uric acid determinations on foetal blood* 

Plate and Matthew’*' 0 , Si sin one and Bogert^ , and also rings bury 

and Sedgwick ^ have found that uric acid was generally the same on 

either side of the placenta* Creatine and creatinine have also been 

reported by Plass 11 to be Quite diffusible and to exist in the same 

concentrations in foetal and maternal plasma, this being also reported 

12 

b„ Hunter and Campbell * 

Little comment can be made on the chloride determinations.except 
the fact that slightly higher concentrations were found in foetal than 
in cow 1 s blood. The values for chlorides in spinal fluid and serum 
wereslightly higher than for whole blood and this is a normal occurr¬ 
ence* Several very low values were obtained for chlorides in amniotie 
fluid* These were checked by the Tan Slyke method of analysis and 
found to be the same. k. von Oe t tinge if y found that chlorides were 
always higher in foetal than in maternal blood. 

Serum proteins were lower in foetal serum than in cow’s serum. 

The values for both albumin and total nitrogen were consistently 
lower. Plaes and Matthew***'' found this to b© true in the case of 
human foetal serum. 

The sugar content was lower than would be expoctec in spinal 

fluid, especially considering the fact that the blood sugar 

22 £1 

was increased above normal due to asphyxia. Hellmuth and Burgess

found lower sugar values in normal human foetal blood at birth than 

19 

in the mother* Aron stated that the blood in the guinea pig embryo 
has a very much lower sugar content than the mother until near full 
term* This fact could not be studied by dealing with the blood of 
foetal calves as there was an abnormal sugar value due to asphyxia. 
The glycogen content of foetal calf skeletal muscle was high 
and increased with the si m of the foetus, while that of heart muscle 
was lower and tended to decrease with an increase in the sise of the 
foetus * 

Qogoberidse has reported that in the rabbit embryo muscle has 
a higher glycogen content than any other tissue * This was found by 

P H 

Mendel and Leavenworth to be also true in the case of the pig 

embryo• 

Cholesterol was found to be extremely low in the foetal blood* 

"I St 

Siemens and Stander have shown this to be true also in the case 
of the human foetus* They found that the cholesterol occurring in 
foetal blood is nearly all in the free condition, as asterlfiea 
cholesterol goes to make up the lipoids of the blood and this con¬ 
stituent ie much lower on the foetal side of the placenta* 

The water content of foetal tissues ie very high as compared 
with the average for adult cattle* It may be seen from Table X 
that the water content of muscle, kidney, and brain decreases with 
increasing age of the foetus* The remaining tissues do not show 

pc 

such a consistent relation* Stander and Tyler*"' have found the 
moisture content of human foetal blood lose than that of the mother* 
This is not indicated in the case of the foetal calf even in the 
foetuses of almost full term. Here, too, there has been the poss¬ 
ibility of a concentration of blood volume due to asphyxia* stander

p>£« 

and Tyler" also made the statement that “because the ash of foetal 
and maternal serum was the same that free exchange of inorganic 
substances through the placenta was indicated® In the opinion of the 
vjriter this is not necessarily true* ihe individual inorganic constituents 
might ha quite different in the blood of the mother and foetus ant 
the total ash bo the same® Taking the ease of calcium and phosphorus 
for ©sample; the serum calcium for a normal foetus or new-born indiv¬ 
idual is higher than that of the mother and the total phosphorus is 
lower due to the deficiency of lipoid phoopho.ru© in foetal blood and 
serum*

The abnormally high values for calcium of foetal serum end 
the inorganic and acid soluble phosphorus of foetal whole blood 
end serum were due to p sohyxia. The increased hydrogen ion 
concentration and high values for sugar were due to the same 
cause.

In concluding I wish to say that many thanks are due to 
Dr. J.B. Collip, of the University of Alberta, for much valuable 
advice and assistance at all times.
