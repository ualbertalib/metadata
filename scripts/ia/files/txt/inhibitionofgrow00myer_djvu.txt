THE INHIBITION OF THE GROWTH OF MYCOBACTERIUM 

BY 

STAPHYLOCOCCUS 


INTRODUCTION 

Knowledge of antagonistic interrelationships among 
micro-organisms dates back to the earliest attempts to iso¬ 
late these organisms. Pasteur T s discovery that microbes are 
responsible for certain human, animal and plant diseases , 
was followed closely by the observation that other organisms 
are able to combat and even destroy the disease-producing 

4 

agents. The latter discovery opened up the field of microbial 
antagonisms and led to the study of the activities and potent¬ 
ialities of these antagonistic organisms. Little is actually 
known concerning the nature or the mode of production of the 
antibiotic substances they produce and even less is known of 
their mode of action. 

Jennings and Sharp (l) in a recent review of the 
antibacterial activity of the Staphyloc occus state that the 
first observation of this phenomenon was by Babes, who showed 
that a Staphylococcus inhibited the growth of B. anthracis 
and of another Staphylococcus. Over a period of sixty years 
some fifty papers have been published regarding this pheno¬ 
menon. The majority of these reports have been concerned

with the action of Staphylococcia against the diphtheria 
bacillus• 

In 1909 Sehi^tz recorded the observation that a 
patient with a staphylococcus sore throat, nursed in a diph¬ 
theria ward because of a mistaken diagnosis, did not develop 
diphtheria, and that carriers became free of the diphtheria 
bacillus during a non-specific throat infection, 

Dujardin-Baumetz described in 1932 (2) the inhibi¬ 
tion of surface growth of saprophytic acid-fast bacilli and 
cold-blooded tubercle bacilli near growths of staphylococci. 

He did not study the effect on mammalian tubercle bacilli. 

He states that the diffusible inhibitory material is destroyed 

.o o 

by 60 C. for one hour but not by 50 C. for two hours. Strains 

isolated from the nasal mucous membrane were active but appar¬ 
ently most strains isolated from other sources were not. 

McPhedran, Lane and Crosson published in 1939 (3) 
an account describing marked anatomical and clinical improve¬ 
ment in cases of pulmonary tuberculosis treated with Staphylo ¬ 
coccus vaccine. They state that such improvement only occurs 
as long as local reactivity to the Staphylococcus is present. 

Arena in 1944 (4) demonstrated, that a certain strain 
of Staphylococcus isolated from a tf mucopurulent secretion from 
a non-tuberculous infection of the respiratory tract 11 would 
inhibit warm-blooded tubercle bacilli (type not stated) on 
coagulated egg medium. The tiro organisms were inoculated a 
few hours or days apart. He confirms the observation of 
Dujardin-Baumetz that not all strains show inhibitory activity. 

Apart from the note by Jennings and Sharp, the most

recent study of the antibiotic activities of Staphylococcus 
in general appears to be that of Duliscouet published in late 
1945 (5). Qnfortunately this reference became available to 
us after our preliminary investigation was completed, conse¬ 
quently we have not been able to check Duliscouet f s work in 
its entirity, nevertheless many of the characteristics des¬ 
cribed by Duliscouet correspond with our own results. The 
staphylococci used by Duliscouet were isolated from the 
throats of convalescent diphtheria patients and the diphtheria 
bacillus was the indicator of inhibitory capacity. Under cer¬ 
tain circumstances the staphylococci are reported to increase 
the growth of diphtheria bacilli, however the majority of the 
strains tested inhibit the growth of diphtheria bacilli. 

Aureus, citreus and albus strains were shorn to be active. 

The best organisms (classified on inhibitory potency) were 
rather larger and less Gram positive than usual, and the col¬ 
onies were smaller end more delicate than usual. Mixed cul¬ 
ture techniques are stated to have changed inactive to active 
strains. 

Simultaneous inoculation of active staphylococci and 
diphtheria bacilli into the same site in guinea pigs protected 
them from death due to the latter: but if the injections ?fere 
made into different sites there was no protection, and if diph¬ 
theria toxin was substituted for diphtheria bacilli there was 
no protection. Filtered cultures of staphylococci in liquid 
media had very little inhibitory activity. The active prin¬ 
ciple was best recovered from growths on solid media: when 
nutrient agar on which the organisms grew was dissolved in

water it was found to inhibit growth of diphtheria bacilli on 
solid and in liquid media* In vivo results were essentially 
the same. A number of characteristics of the active principle 
are mentioned, as follows: relative thermolability (destroyed 
in a few minutes at 80°C.), active in high dilutions, preci- 
pitable by alcohol, soluble in water and glycerine, absorbed 
readily by albuminoid materials, optimum pH for inhibition 
7.5-3.5, and increased activity in the presence of calcium 
ions. The substance is thought to be an enzyme. 

Jennings and Sharp (l) dealt with the effect of two 
hundred and five Staphylococcus strains on Stanhylococcus 
aureus , Corynebacterium xerosis, Corynebacterium aiphtheriae 
and Escherichia coli ♦ 

Surface plate tests were performed and twenty-six 
actively inhibiting Staphylococcus strains were found. C. 
xerosis was inhibited by all twenty-six active strains. Staph ¬ 
ylococcus aureus and C. diohtheriae by most of the active 
strains and E. coli by none. Hone of pigment production, lac¬ 
tose fermentation, mannite fermentation or coagulase production 
were related to inhibitory potency. 

Our Interest in the action of Staphylococcus on Myco ¬ 
bacterium tuberculosis was aroused by certain clinical and 
pathological observations in a case of pulmonary tuberculosis 
which will be described below. The patient 0. B. was a twenty- 
nine year old, male, white soldier. During 1944 while in Eng¬ 
land he developed periodic attacks of "bronchitis”. So far as 
we know. X-ray and sputum studies in England were negative for 
tuberculosis. He became seriously ill in April, 1945 and for

weeks ran an almost continuous temperature of well over 100 F., 
often 105 and 106°F. He had copious sputum, but no tubercle 
bacilli could be demonstrated in smear and a guinea pig inocu¬ 
lation with the sputum was negative for tuberculosis. X-ray 
was inconclusive as to the presence of parenchymal tuberculosis. 
The sputum contained large numbers of Monilia (said to be non- 
pathogenic by a mycologist) and Staphylococcus . He developed 
a pleural effusion from which tubercle bacilli of human type 
were isolated. 

The patient died in June, 1945. At autopsy, he had 
massive pleural tuberculosis, the pleurae being thickened as 
much as half an inch in places. There was remarkably little 
parenchymal involvement, amounting to slight local extensions 
just beneath the pleura in a few places. 

It was felt that a man in such a debilitated condi¬ 
tion over such a prolonged period, and with tuberculosis, 
should have shown more parenchymal involvement. For this rea¬ 
son tests were made of Monilia , Staphylococcus aureus , Strep ¬ 
tococcus viridans and unidentified gram negative bacillus 
strains isolated from his sputum, to determine whether any of 
these organisms would inhibit the strain of tubercle bacilli 
isolated from the pleural fluid. The gram negative bacilli 
overgrew the plates and inhibition was not determined: of the 
others only the Staphylococcus aureus shOTed any activity. 

The investigation described In this report was based upon this 
initial observation.

TESTIN G OF STAPHYLOCOCCUS FOR INHIBITORY ACTIVITY 


Introduction 

Methods of testing antagonistic action have been 
described by Selman A. Waksman in his book on T, Microbial 
Antagonisms and Antibiotic Substances” (6). Solid media 
have been used extensively for testing the action of anta¬ 
gonists. One of the methods most commonly used has been the 
simultaneous inoculation of antagonist and test organism. 
Waksman states that this method was introduced by Garre (7) 
in 1887. The method consists in streaking the antagonist 
and the test organism on the surface of solidified agar or 
gelatin medium. The streaks are alternate and may be para¬ 
llel, radiating from a common centre, or intersecting at 
right angles. If the antagonistic agent produced does not 
diffuse for any considerable distance into the medium, the 
method is not satisfactory. 

Experimental 

In our initial work the following procedure was 
adopted. Two plates of Loewenstein medium ( see Appendix l) 
were used for each test of Inhibitory potency of a Staphylo ¬ 
coccus strain against a, Mycobacterium strain. Twenty-five 
strains of Staphylococcus « collected from the Provincial

Strains of acid-fast bacilli tested for inhibition 


by Staphylococcus 


I Strains marked A.T.C.C. were obtained from the 
• American Type Culture Collection, 2029 M Street, 
N. W., Washington 6, D. C. 

n This strain was typed by animal inoculation. 






























(9 


The method of testing was to inoculate the plates 
with the acid-fast organisms in such a manner that a heavy con¬ 
fluent growth would be produced on incubation. Immediately 
after inoculation of the acid-fast organisms an inoculum of the 
strain of Staphylococcus to be tested was streaked in a straight 
line down the centre of the plate on top of the acid-fast inoc¬ 
ulum. The plates were incubated for three or four days at 

37°C., then sealed with Scotch tape to prevent drying of the 

o 

medium and incubation at 37 C. was continued for the duration 
of the test. 

Plates prepared as described above were examined 
every other day for the first two weeks of incubation,, every 
third or fourth day for the next two weeks, and once a week 
for the remainder of the period of incubation. The slower 
growing strains were held as long as fifteen weeks in certain 
instances before maximum growth was considered to have' been 
reached. 

Inhibition was quantitatively estimated by the dis¬ 
tance in centimetres from the edge of the Staphylococcus growth 
(and at right angles to it) to the nearest acid-fast growth. 
Duplicate plates gave the same results within 0.2 centimetres. 
The ease of obtaining similar results in the duplicate plates 
was rather striking, considering the method of inoculation. 

The results obtained in these tests are presented in 
Figures 1 and 2. These results were obtained from the obser¬ 
vation of some 5^0 test plates, prepared and observed, as des¬ 


cribed above.

FIGURE TWO 

The results shown in this Figure represent the 
"inhibitory distance" measured at the time of maximum growth. 

Explanation: 

The part of the acid-fast growth nearest the Staph ¬ 
ylococcus growth had sometimes a decreased rate of growth so 
that the "inhibitory distance" decreased as the culture aged. 

Sta y hylococcus strains are arranged roughly in order 
of increasing inhibitory power from right to left. 

Mycobacterium strains are arranged roughly in order 


of increasing susceptibility from top to bottom.

Duplication of Results : 

The remarkable duplication of results obtainable is 
illustrated in the Kodachrome Frontispiece , Two plates of 
Loewenstein medium are depicted. The plates were inoculated 
with four human strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in para¬ 
llel transverse surface streaks, an area one centimetre square 
in the middle of each streak was immediately inoculated with 
a strain of Staphylococcus . The four human strains of Myco ¬ 
bacterium tuberculosis as well as the strain of Staphylococcus 
shown in these duplicate plates were among those tested in the 
investigation with which this report is concerned. This modi¬ 
fication of the plate technique was developed with a view to 
using less medium for the tests. Formerly we had used one 
plate of Loe?irenstein medium for each strain of Mycobacterium 
tested. This latest technique made it possible to test four 
strains of Mycobacterium on each plate of medium. When we 
take into consideration the necessity of duplicate plates for 
each test we see that this technique reduces the number of 
plates required to test four strains of Mycobacterium from 
sixteen to two. The method of inoculating a small area in 
the middle of each streak of Mycobacterium with the strain of 
Staphylococcus being tested was employed in preference to 
inoculating the Staphylococcus strain in a continuous streak 
across the four streaks of Mycobacterium in order to avoid 
the dragging of organisms from one acid-fast inoculum to an¬ 
other. One previously tested strain of Staphylococcus was 


tested using this method and gave the same results as when

tested by the initial technique (one year previously). This 
modification was adopted as the routine method of testing for 
inhibitory activity. 

Organisms other than Staphylococcus tested for Inhibitory 
Potency : 

Three strains of haemolytic streptococci from throats, 
one diphtheroid bacillus, one unidentified gram positive bacil¬ 
lus and one unidentified strain of Actinomyces were tested. 

Two of the haemolytic streptococcus strains slowed the growth 
of one human strain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and one of 
them prevented overgrowth by the human acid-fast bacilli but 
not by the other strains of acid-fast bacilli. Otherwise no 
inhibition was observed.

Certain Phenomena Observ ed with regard to Inhibition ; 

Test plates prepared for the purpose of estimating 
the inhibitory potency of various strains of Staphylococcus 
towards the growth of various strains of Mycoba c terium often 
gave rise to certain unexplained peculiarities of growth which 
we have attempted to illustrate in Chart Three. The drawings 
shown in Chart Three were made directly from plates observed 
and irregularities in growth shown are as they appeared on 
such plates.

CHART THREE 


Explanation : 

Plate 1: 

This plate shows the normal appearance of confluent sur¬ 
face growth of a strain of Mycobacterium (orange pigment) on 
Loewenstein medium, (blue-green background). 

Plate 2: 

This plate represents the appearance of the confluent 
surface growth of a strain of Mycobacterium (orange pigment) 
on Loewenstein medium (blue-green background) with a diamet¬ 
ric surface streak of Stanhylococcns growth (golden pigment) . 
The area of inhibition is clearly seen between Mycobacterium 
and S tap hy1o c o c cus growth. This was a typical plate. 

Plates 3 , 4 and 5: 

These plates represent certain unexplained peculiarities 
of the growth of Mycobacterium observed. 

The green coloration of the Mycobacterium growth demon¬ 
strated on Plates 4 and 5 was observed only on plates which 

o 

had been subjected to prolonged incubation at 37 C. It is 
our opinion that the Mycobacterium growth has taken up the 
Malachite Green which is contained in the medium (see Appen¬ 
dix 1) .

Growth Chara c te_r isties of Mycobacterium strains tested : 

The character of the strains of Mycobacterium grown 
on Loewenstein medium followed closely the text-book descrip¬ 
tions of these strains. 

Mycobacterium strains of the human type grew with 
the usual granular (bread crumb-like) colonial morphology on 
this medium. The strain 2287H produced a slightly more slime¬ 
like growth. The avian, bovine and cold-blooded strains gave 
rise to moist viscous confluent growth on Loewenstein medium. 

M. smegmatls produced dry granular confluent growth on the 
medium. 

With regard to the pigmentation of the strains of 
Mycobacterium tested, the human types in general produced an 
orange-pink pigment, the avian and bovine strains a pinkish 
cream pigment, the cold-blooded strain a vivid yellow pigment 
and M. smegmatis produced, a salmon pink pigment. 

Growth Rates of Various Mycobacteriu m strains tested : 

Mycobacterium strains used in this investigation 

were maintained on Loewenstein slants throughout the period of 

testing. Strains were transferred every four to six weeks, 
o 

incubated at 37 C. until profuse growth appeared and then held 

at room temperature ( 20-25 C.). A record was kept during the 

tests and transfers to determine the average number of days of 

incubation at 37°C. required for a given strain of Mycobac - 

o 

terium to produce macroscopic colonies at 37 C. and the results 
of twenty-four transfers are given in Chart Four.

CHART FOUR 


Explanation : 

Mycobacterium strains are arranged in the column 
at the extreme left* 

Transfer numbers are listed across the top of the 

chart. 

Opposite each Mycobacterium strain will be found 

a number, which represents the number of days incubation at 
o 

37 C. required to give rise to macroscopic colonies for that 
transfer. 

The column (A) at the extreme right gives the aver- 

o 

age number of days incubation at 37 C. required to give rise 
to macroscopic colonies for a given strain of Mycobacterium 
for the twenty-four transfers. 

Example: 

Mycobacterium strain 1961H required 11 days incu¬ 
bation at 37°C. to produce macroscopic colonies on the eighth 
transfer. 

Mycobacterium strain 1961H required an average of 
o 

10 days incubation at 37 C. to produce macroscopic colonies, 
based on 24 transfers at four to six week intervals.

Summary 

The relations between different forms of life vary 

with the environmental conditions of the moment. Our tests 

were done under only one set of environmental conditions and 

these were not entirely optimal for some, if not all, of the 

strains of bacteria used. The temperature of incubation was 
o 

always 37 C., although the optimal temperatures for bacteria 
vary widely: the medium contained glycerine and Malachite 
Green, both of which had different effects, presumably, on 
the Stanhylococcus and Mycobacterium strains used. These re¬ 
marks merely emphasize the relativity of any observations made 
in this, or any, antibiotic work. 

There are marked differences in the susceptibility 
to inhibition among the strains of acid-fast bacilli tested 
by this method. It would be a mistake to make too many gen¬ 
eralizations on the basis of a study of so few strains. In 
general, however, the figures show that the human strains 
studied are more susceptible than the bovine strains, and the 
bovine more susceptible than the remainder of the strains 
tested. 

In general, the fast-growing strains of Mycobac ¬ 
terium are not inhibited as much as the slow-growing strains, 
and often are not inhibited at all. It is not quite true, 
however, that if a strain is slow-growing, it will be inhi- 

r ° 

bited: for instance, strain 224CB (growing at 37 C. well 
above its optimum 20-23°C., for it is a reptilian strain) is 
one of the slowest growing strains with which we worked, and 
yet it is very poorly inhibited.

MORPHOLOGICAL AND BIOCHEMICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF STAPHYnuCOCCUS 


Introduction 

TT In the earlier work on antagonisms, among micro¬ 
organisms, tvsTO main procedures were followed; the indiscrim¬ 
inate testing of pure cultures of bacteria and fungi, common¬ 
ly taken from culture collections, for antagonistic activity 
against one another or against certain specific test organ¬ 
isms; and isolation of occasional antagonistic organisms from 
old plate cultures, as contaminants from the air, or from 
mixed infections. Neither of these methods is suitable where 
a systematic study of antagonism is desired. Recently a more 
systematic study of the distribution of antagonistic organ¬ 
isms in nature has been attempted. The work of Fleming (8) 
and other British workers (9, 10, 11), on the antibacterial 
properties of the molds belonging to the PeniciIlium notaturn 
group served as a stimulus to the numerous studies that fol¬ 
lowed. tT The above quotation from Waksman (6) briefly des¬ 
cribes the development of the study of microbial antagonism. 
Gradually the idea developed that in the case of bacterial 
antagonists one is dealing with specific strains rather than 
with distinct species. Stokes and ¥Joodward (12) pointed out 
that the biochemical characteristics of spore-forming soil 
bacteria differed for strains possessing antagonistic prop¬ 
erties and strains which did not possess these properties.

Pigment production has been related to antagonistic potency 
in the case of Ps . aeruginosa by Schoental (13). In any sy¬ 
stematic study of the antagonistic properties of a given bac¬ 
terial strain it therefore appears logical that a concurrent 
study of the morphological and biochemical characteristics of 
the strains of that species might demonstrate some correla¬ 
tion with the antagonistic properties and. thus aid in the iso¬ 
lation of highly antagonistic strains. 

Experimental 

Our investigation of twenty-five strains of Staph ¬ 
ylococc us dealt with the following characteristics: micro¬ 
scopic morphology and staining reaction, colonial morphology, 
pigmentation, haemolytic activity, lactose fermentation, man- 
nite fermentation, coagulase production and a preliminary 
investigation of lipolytic activity. Before discussing the 
above mentioned characteristics perhaps we should note the 
source of the various strains. Th£$« data av-e given in Chart 
Five.

Microscopic Morph ol ogy and Staining Reac tion: 

All strains of Staphylococcu s examined in this in¬ 
vestigation were of typical microscopic morphology being 
grape-like clusters of cocci, individual organisms approxi¬ 
mately one micron in diameter. All strains examined stained 
Gram-positive. No significant variation in size, shape or 
staining characteristic was observed. 

Colonial Morphology : 

Growing on Nutrient agar medium and upon Blood agar 
medium all the strains of Staphylococcus tested produced typi¬ 
cal circular, smooth colonies with entire edges. Isolated 
colonies of the various strains showed no significant varia¬ 
tions in size, shape or consistency when growing on these 

o 

media. Incubation temperature was 37 C. and time of observa¬ 
tion for colonial characteristics was twenty-four hours in 
all cases. 

Pigmentation : 

o 

Growing on Blood agar medium at 37 C. the pigment 
produced by the various strains of Staphyloc occus is shown in 
Chart Six. Certain strains gave doubtful pigmentation at the 
end of twenty-four hours T incubation at this temperature and 
subsequent incubation and observation for forty-eight hours, 
seventy-two hours and ninety-six hours was carried out and 


recorded

Haemolytic Activity of Staphylococcus : 

The various strains of Sta?3hylococcus were tested 

for haemolytic activity on Blood agar medium, (Nutrient Agar 

containing 5 % aseptically drawn, defibrinated sheep ! s blood) 
o 

incubated at 37 C. Certain strains demonstrated delayed haemo 
lytic action so that it was necessary to observe these plates 
at prolonged incubation periods. The results of these observa 
tions are outlined in Chart Seven.

Lactose Fermentation : 

Strains of Staphylococcus under investigation were 

tested for lactose fermenting properties in beef-extract broth 

containing 1% lactose and 1% Andrade*s indicator. Cultures 

were incubated at 37°C. for 96 hours and observed every 24 

hours during that period for evidence of fermentation. All 

twenty-five strains of Staphylococcus tested fermented lactose, 

o 

within 24 hours* incubation at 37 C., with the production of 
acid and without producing gas. 

Mannite Fermentation : 

Strains of Staphylococcus under investigation were 
tested for mannite fermentation in beef-extract broth con¬ 
taining 1% mannite and 1 % Andrade*s indicator. Cultures were 
o 

incubated at 37 C. for 96 hours and observed every 24 hours 
during that period for evidence of fermentation. The results 
obtained for the twenty-five strains of Staphylococcus tested 
are presented in Chart Eight.

Coagulase Production: 

In their report on "The Differentiation of Patho¬ 
genic Staphylococci from Non-pathogenic Types", Chapman, 
Berens, Nilson and Curcio ( 14 ) state that with a few excep¬ 
tions, any coagulating (i.e., Coagulase Positive) strain is 
pathogenic. These results are in accordance with the find¬ 
ings of previous workers. Different results have been ob¬ 
tained using this test in different laboratories and accord¬ 
ing to these workers, errors may be traced to at least three 
sources: the use of plasma from unsuitable animal species; 
the time of observing the results;, and failure to recognize 
a minute coagulum. Our method of testing for coagulase pro¬ 
duction was that recommended by the above mentioned investi¬ 
gators. A loopful of the culture was obtained from solid 
medium and mixed with 0.5-1.0 c.c. of oxalated or citrated 
human plasma in Q.B5% sodium chloride solution (equal parts 

of human plasma and normal saline solution). After shaking 

o 

thoroughly, the mixture was allowed to stand at 37 C., and 
examined in 4 hours. If no coagulum could be detected the 
tubes were re-examined the following morning. The presence 
of a gelatinous globule in the tube was tested for by tilt¬ 
ing the tube to the horizontal position and then back to 
the vertical position. The presence of any degree of clot¬ 
ting at either time of observation was considered as a posi¬ 
tive test. The results obtained, for the twenty-five strains 
of Staphylococcus tested, are given in Chart Nine.

Preliminary In vest igation of Lipolytic Activity of Staphylococcus 

In 1901 Eijkman (15) devised a differential plating 
medium for lipase-producing bacteria. Since that time numer¬ 
ous references have appeared in the literature describing 
methods for the differentiation of lipolytic from non-lipoly¬ 
tic bacteria. Turner (16) reporting on the various techni¬ 
ques developed for this purpose states that Nile-blue sulphate 
medium containing an emulsion of tributyrin gave remarkable 
sharpness of differentiation and high degree of sensitivity, 
but inhibited the growth of certain organisms (namely certain 
strains of Clostridium welchii and Staphyl o coccus aureus ). 
Collins and Hammer (17) consider the addition of Nile-blue 
sulphate to a nutrient agar medium containing dispersed fat 
provides a convenient method for the detection of bacteria 
that hydrolyze fat. The medium employed by Collins and Ham¬ 
mer was a beef-infusion agar adjusted to pH 6.8 to 7.0. To 
each 100 ml. volume of this base was added 10 ml. of a 0.1$ 
aqueous solution of Nile-blue sulphate. The agar was then 
placed in tubes and sterilized. Fat to be used was prepared 
by filtration through a hot water funnel and addition to a 
0.5$ agar solution in the proportion of 10 ml. of fat to 90 
ml. of the agar solution. This mixture was sterilized at 
15 pounds for twenty-five minutes, cooled until it was near¬ 
ly solidified and then vigorously shaken to ensure an emul¬ 
sion of fat. Just before use the fat emulsion was heated to 
a temperature that would give a soft jelly-like mass which 
could be easily transferred with a pipette. When the plates

were poured, the agar containing the Nile-blue sulphate was 
melted and the fat emulsion added to the hot agar in the pro¬ 
portion of 1 ml. of the emulsion to 20 ml. of the agar. The 
agar was allowed to remain hot for a few minutes before it 
was poured since this intensified the red color of the fat 
globules. Large colonies of the organisms being tested were 
secured by touching the surface of the solidified agar with 
a small loop that had been put into a milk culture of the or¬ 
ganisms. The plates were incubated at the appropriate tem¬ 
perature and observations were made at various times, using 
a hand lens or a wide-field binocular. 

Rationale of this test : 

As a pH indicator in aqueous solution Nile-blue 
sulphate is blue at pH 10.1 and red at pH 11.7. Actually 
Nile-blue sulphate is composed of two dyes, the oxazone frac¬ 
tion being soluble in water, fats and fatty acids, and which 
is red when oxidized and blue when reduced, and the blue oxa - 
zine fraction which is soluble in water and fatty acids but 
not in fat, and which when reduced forms a colorless or leuco 
base. 

Ordinarily fat is stained red by Nile-blue sulphate. 
When it is stained blue, using Nile-blue sulphate, the blue 
color may indicate, either, the reduction of the red oxazone 
by bacterial products soluble in fat, or, the absorption of 
the blue oxazine by bacterial products soluble in fat. 

We include this observation by Castell and Bryant(IS)

in order to point out that the presence of blue-colored fat 
globules is not necessarily a result of fat hydrolysis as 
earlier workers believed. Fatty acids produced as a result 
of fat hydrolysis result in the absorption of the blue oxa- 
zine and the fat globule although appearing intact is sur¬ 
rounded by the blue-stained fatty acid. 

Either the oxazone or the oxazine may be permanent¬ 
ly oxidized to the colorless states by oxidase-producing bac¬ 
teria or by strong oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide. In 
our work using the Nile-blue sulphate procedure we did not 
observe blue-stained globules but in every instance, when the 
wide-field binocular was used colorless circular areas could 
be detected within the area of fat alteration. Two possible 
explanations of these colorless circular areas present them¬ 
selves | the fat globule may be intact and the Nile-blue sul¬ 
phate oxidized to the colorless state, or the colorless cir¬ 
cular area observed may be merely an artifact, i.e., the im¬ 
pression left in the solidified agar by the fat globule, which 
has since disintegrated. We have no means available to dif¬ 
ferentiate these possibilities. 

4 positive Nile-blue sulphate test probably usually 
means that some bacterial attack on the fat is under way. To 
date workers have accepted the absence of red-stained fat 
globules as evidence of fat alteration probably lipolysis. 

For the purposes of our preliminary investigation of the var¬ 
ious strains of Staphylococcus we have accepted a similar in¬ 


terpretation of the results obtained with this test.

The method employed by us in testing Staphylococcus 
strains for lipolytic activity was essentially that of Collins 
and Hammer. The fat emulsion used was made by adding 10 ml. 
of tributyrin to 90 ml. of 0.5% agar solution. This emulsion 
was sterilized by autoclave at 15 pounds pressure for 20-30 
minutes. To every 100 ml. of melted sterile nutrient agar 
5 ml. of this emulsion was added prior to plate pouring. 

Turner (l6) has- pointed out that certain strains of Staphylo ¬ 
coccus aureus are inhibited by the presence of Nile-blue sul¬ 
phate 1:8,000. Our initial experiments with this procedure 
demonstrated that approximately 50 per cent of the Staphylo ¬ 
coccus cultures being tested were inhibited by a concentra¬ 
tion of Nile-blue sulphate 1:10,000 in the finished medium. 

To avoid this inhibiting action we prepared our test medium 
so that the final concentration of Nile-blue sulphate in 
this medium was 1:100,000. All the strains of Staphylococcus 
tested by us grew slowly on this medium but growth was not 
entirely inhibited. Medium ?/as poured in large Petri dishes 
14 centimetres in diameter, the object being to test as many 
strains of Staphylococcus as possible under identical condi¬ 
tions and. on the same medium. In this manner it was pos¬ 
sible to test at least eight different strains in duplicate 
on the same plate. A standard loop was used for inoculation. 
The inoculum was from a healthy surface growth of the parti¬ 
cular Staphylococcus strain on plain agar. Giant colonies 

were prepared by touching a loopful of the inoculum to the 

o 

surface of the test medium. Plates were incubated at 37 C. 
for two or three days, then sealed with Scotch tape to pre-

vent drying of the medium. Incubation was continued for thir- 
o 

teen days at 37 C. Daily measurement of the diameter of the 
area of fat alteration surrounding each giant colony was re¬ 
corded in centimetres. The area of fat alteration was con¬ 
sidered to be that area within which no red-stained fa't glob¬ 
ules were observed. The measurements recorded after forty- 
eight hours’ incuba.tion and after thirteen days’ incubation 
are given in Chart Ten.

Summary 

We were unable to recognize any relation between 
the source of Staphylococcus and inhibitory potency. The 
two most powerfully inhibitory strains were from a wound in¬ 
fection of the buttocks and from food. 

Most of the strains of Staphylococcus studied were 
of golden pigmentation, haemolytic on sheep T s blood agar, 
fermented lactose and mannite and gave a positive tube test 
for coagulase using human plasma. However, there are sev¬ 
eral strains which gave strong positive tests in all these 
respects and which are less efficient inhibitors than strain 
35, which was white, only slightly haemolytic, fermented lac¬ 
tose, did not ferment mannite in twenty-four hours but did 
so in forty-eight hours and was coagulase negative. These 
observations confirm those in the literature. ?y T e have not, 
however, tested any number of white, non-haemolytic coagu¬ 
lase negative strains. We have not noticed any such differ¬ 
ence in colonial form as described by Duliscouet (5). 

If we consider the alteration of fat globules, as 
demonstrated by the Nile-blue sulphate technique, as evidence 
of lipolysis, then we can say that all the strains of Staph ¬ 
ylococcus tested possessed this characteristic. This con¬ 
firms the observation of Trussell and Weed (19), who tested 
thirty-eight strains of Staphylococcus and concluded that 
they exhibit considerable lipolytic activity. The test it¬ 
self is purely qualitative and until a more accurate tech¬ 
nique is available quantitative estimation of lipolytic

activity based on the results obtained by this method must 
indeed be only relative. It is difficult to establish any 
relation between the inhibitory potency, of a particular 
strain of Staphylococcus towards the growth of Mycobacter ¬ 
ium , and the lipolytic activity of that strain of Staphylo ¬ 
coccu s . For example. Staphylococcus strain 55 appeared to 
possess the greatest lipolytic activity according to our 
observations. However, this strain was very weakly inhibi¬ 
tory towards the growth of Mycobacterium . On the other hand. 
Staphylococcus strain 3297 is second to strain 55 in lipoly¬ 
tic activity and is one of the most potent inhibiting strains.

EXTRACTION AND TESTING OF INHIBITORY AGENT FROM STAPHYLOCOCCUS 

Introduction 

The literature contains numerous references to the 
possible growth products of Staphylococcus aureus in parti¬ 
cular and the genus in general. As we have previously pointed 
out the production of lipase by Staphylococcus has been stud¬ 
ied by many workers. Many other products of the growth of 
Staphylococcus have been demonstrated. The pigment of Staph ¬ 
ylococcus aureus was reported as lipochrome by Schroeter (20) 
in 1872 and as lipoxanthine in 1889 by Zopf (21). In 1908 
Much (22) reported Staphylococcus aureus produced an enzyme 
which he regarded as thrombokinase. Seo (23) in the same 
year reported that hippuricase was prooiuced by this species. 
Mavrojannis (24) reported in 1903 that Staphylococcus aureus 
and Staphylococcus albus produced a gelatinase, which does 
not change gelatine sufficiently but that formaldehyde will 
harden it again, forming Tl gelatose ,T . Burnet (25) reported 
in 1925 that Staphylococcus aureus produced catalase. Gosio 
(26) in 1904 suggested the employment of tellurite as a use¬ 
ful test for differentiating living from dead cells and 
found that Staphylococcus aureus reduced tellurite markedly. 
C-loger (27) in 1906 concluded that organisms capable of re¬ 
ducing potassium tellurite produced hydrogen sulphide. Meyer 
(28) in 1913 reported the production of acid and gas from

from glucosamine by Staphylococcus aureus . Seo (23) reported 
that Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus albus were 
able to dissimilate hippuric acid and that benzoic acid re¬ 
sulted. In addition to the above grom^th products Emmerling 

(29) reported in 1896 that decomposition of egg albumin by 
Staphylococcus aureus resulted in the production of formic, 
acetic and butyric acid, carbon dioxide, skatol, indol, am¬ 
monia, phenol, trimethylamine and betain. In the same ref¬ 
erences Emmerling states that higher fatty acids are pro¬ 
duced by Staphylococcus aureus growing on egg albumin medium. 
The report of the production of higher fatty acids assumes 
especial significance when we consider the statement by Dubos 

(30) that even very small amounts of free fatty acid exert a 
very strong toxic action on Mycobacterium . Kraaij and Wolff 

(31) reported in 1923 that Staphylococcus aureus splits fat 
and not lecithin. Sobin and Stahly (32) reported the isola¬ 
tion of delta-carotene, rubixanthin and an ester of rubixan- 
thin from the pigment of Staphylococcus aureus . The complex¬ 
ity of the investigation of growth products of Staphylococcus 
is clearly illustrated by the references cited above. 

The literature regarding the effect of extracts of 
Staphylococcus aureus on other organisms contains a recent 
report by Nutini, Kelly and McDowell (33) . In 1946 these 
workers reported that protein free alcoholic extracts of the 
cells of a single strain of Staphylococcus aureus had an in¬ 
hibitory action towards Escherichia coli, Aerobacter aerog: - 
enes. Staphylococcus aureus and Shigella dysenteriae . In 
high concentration this extract stimulated the growth of

Staphylococcus aureus and Sh. dysenteriae . Extracts of broth 
culture stimulated the growth of J£. coli when present in con¬ 
centration of 5 per cent, the other organisms tested were 
either inhibited or no effect was demonstrable. Extracts 
of filtrates had essentially a stimulant action towards the 
growth of all organisms tested. 

The report of Duliscouet ( 5 ) previously cited deals 
with the characteristics of an extract of Staphylococcus and 
the effect of such an extract on the growth of the diphtheria 
bacillus. 

We were unable to find any reference in the litera¬ 
ture regard.ing the effect of Staphylococcus extract on the 
growth of Mycobacterium . 


Experimental 

Preliminary experiments suggested that filtrates 
of broth cultures of Staphylococcus would not yield enough in¬ 
hibitory material for plate demonstration. These experiments 
involved growing Staphylococcus strain IB7 in an extract broth 

with Bactopeptone and salt, and in the same with 1 per cent 

o 

dextrose, for nine days and one day respectively at 37 C. 

These cultures were then passed through Handler diatomaceous 
earth filters. Sterile filter paper patches 1.2 centimetres 
in diameter were dipped in the filtrates and placed at the 
centre of heavily inoculated Loewenstein plates. Incubation 
revealed no inhibition of even the slower growing mammalian 
strains of Mycobacterium , although when the living organisms

from the same broth culture of Staphylococcus were used in¬ 
hibition was marked. 

Extraction of Staphylococcus bodies was first at¬ 
tempted using strain 187 (at this time we did not know that 
this strain possessed relatively little inhibitory power). 

This strain of Staphylococcus was grown on twelve plain agar 
o 

plates at 37 C. for 36 hours. The confluent growth was har¬ 
vested by scraping the surface of the plates, about 3.0 ml. 
of the material was thus obtained. Extraction was carried 
out according to the procedure employed by Harper (34) for 
the extraction of penicillinase. The organisms were extrac- 
ted for one hour at room temperature (20-25 C.) with about 
20 ml. of acetone. After filtering through ordinary filter 
paper, the bodies were again extracted with 15 ml. of acetone 
for one hour. Filtration was again carried out and extrac¬ 
tion with two 10 ml. volumes of ether followed. The ether 
and acetone extracts were then evaporated to nearly dryness. 
Filter paper patches were used as previously described, 
moistened in the acetone extract, the ether extract and the 
residue consisting of the extracted Staphylococcus bodies. 
Plates of Loewenstein medium were used for testing these 
fractions in the manner described above, neither the acetone 
extract nor the extracted bodies gave any inhibition. The 
results for the ether extract are given in Chart Eleven.

Possible Effect of pH : 

To rule out alteration in pH as a possible factor 
in the inhibition of the growth of Mycobacterium by Staphylo¬ 
coccus extracts, we prepared a buffer series of solutions 
having pH from 6.0 to 8.7. Filter paper patches as previous¬ 
ly employed were moistened with these solutions. Loew T en- 
stein medium was prepared and inoculated as before. No in¬ 
hibition of Mycobacterium strain 192 (var. hominis) or of 
M. smegmati s strain 225 was observed. Figure Eleven shows 
one of this series of plates with the typical uninhibited 
growth of Mycobacterium .

Having shown that it was possible to extract from 
the harvested bodies of Staphylo c occus a material inhibitory 
to the growth of Mycobacterium on Loewenstein medium, it be¬ 
came necessary to attempt to develop as simple and rapid a 
method for titration of the inhibitory potency of extracts 
as possible. There are a number of methods in the litera¬ 
ture which might be applied to the titration of agents in¬ 
hibiting the gro T wth of Mycobacterium but the process is uni¬ 
formly a tedious and long one, and subject to many unexpec¬ 
ted difficulties. One of the most promising of the more 
rapid methods appeared to be Muller Vs (35) modification of 
the slide culture method of Pryce (36). In this method a 
thick suspension of bacilli is prepared by scraping the growth 
from the surface of a three or four week old culture of Myco ¬ 
bacterium on Loewenstein medium. The harvested growth is 
suspended by grinding irith the gradual addition of sterile 
distilled water. The suspension thus prepared is centri¬ 
fuged and the supernatant is mixed with an equal volume of 
fresh blood serum and immediately spread on glass slides (in 
the Pryce method) or glass chips (in the Muller modification). 
The slides are dried in the incubator and then treated with 
25 per cent sulphuric acid to kill contaminating organisms. 

Slides are then placed in culture vials to be incubated. In- 

o 

cubation is carried out at 37 C. The medium contained in the 
screw capped vials may be: 

(a) 5 ml. of sterile distilled crater plus 2.5 ml. of 

citrated huma.n blood

(b) 5 ml. of citrated human blood plus 5.0 ml. of 1 per 

cent saponin solution. 

Growth on the slides is stated to be observable after one 
week*s incubation; at this time slides are removed from vials, 
stained and examined. Slides may be removed, one each day, 
so that a day by day comparison of the growth may be observed. 

The slides which we employed were made by cutting 
ordinary microscope slides in three lengthwise so that glass 
strips approximately 5/16 of an inch wide by 3 inches in 
length were obtained. The suspension of organisms was placed 
on the terminal quarter of the glass strip, fixed by the dry¬ 
ing process and placed in vials. The treatment with sulphur¬ 
ic acid was omitted, since we were dealing with a pure culture 
of Mycobacterium . Slides were placed in the culture vials 
containing the medium in such a manner that the medium cover¬ 
ed the inoculated portion of the slide. Incubation and sub¬ 
sequent observation of slides was as outlined above. Both 
the Pryce and Muller techniques were attempted several times 
using both human and sheep ! s blood in the medium. Initially 
our intention was to dilute the inhibitory agent, extracted 
from 3tanhvlococcus , in this medium and thus roughly estimate 
the inhibitory potency of such extracts. The procedure was 
abandoned due to two main difficulties. Using the glass strip 
technique of Pryce we found that following incubation the acid- 
fast organisms could not be found at the initial site of inocu¬ 
lation but were found at the extreme opposite end of the glass 
strip. This was probably due to inadequate fixing of the orig¬ 
inal inoculum and the organisms loosening from the slide during

incubation being carried to the surface of the medium floated 
upward in the thin film of medium adhering to the glass strip, 
due to surface tension. Using the glass chip method, the 
chips entirely immersed in medium, this difficulty did not 
arise. The second and the greatest difficulty encountered 
was the inability to obtain a suspension of isolated bacilli 
for the original inoculum. Tubercle bacilli are notoriously 
tenacious in clumping. Despite tedious grinding we were un¬ 
able to break up these clumps. The presence of clumps in 
the stained, specimen following incubation prevented detection 
of any growth which may have occurred. Chart Twelve is a 
diagram of the Pryce and Muller technique as employed by us 
and illustrates the difficulty present in the Pryce method.

Us e Qf Dubos 1 Medium for Titration of Staphylococcus Extract 

A new liquid synthetic medium for the rapid and sub¬ 
merged growth of Mycobacterium as developed by Dubos (37) was 
next employed. Our first work was performed using a medium of 
the following composition: 


Na 2 HP0^(anhydrous)

0.6 

gramme 

Distilled water

) ml. 

Tween 80 

0.5 

ml. 


This was dispensed in 1.0 ml. volumes in test tubes, 
and autoclaved. At first the test tubes were plugged with cot¬ 
ton, later screw capped tubes were used. Finally because of 
difficulties involved in drying out of the medium even in screw 
capped vials, and difficulties in studying the character of the 
growth in such small volumes, we changed to 5.0 ml. amounts and 
abandoned screw capped tubes in favor of cotton plugged tubes. 
We also felt that it was better to give freer access of air 
than screw capped vials allowed. 

At first, attention was confined to Mycobacterium 
tuberculosis var hominis , strain 192, and Staphylococcus aureus, 
strain 187. This strain of tubercle bacilli reached maximum 
growth (by macroscopic estimation) in the above medium in 4 to 
5 days when we first started using it. We proceeded to make

extracts of Staphylococcus and titrate them as follows: 
Extraction Methods : 

Method One 

Twenty-five to thirty plain agar plates were inocu¬ 
lated. confluently on the surface with Staphylococcus and in- 
o 

cubated at 37 C. for 24 to 96 hours. The growth was harves¬ 
ted using a sterile metal scraper, little or no agar being 
taken. The harvested organisms were placed in a sterile mor¬ 
tar and di-ethyl ether added. Grinding was carried out by 
hand, using a sterile pestle, until the staphylococcal bodies 
assumed a dry granular character (about two hours being re¬ 
quired) . The ether extract was then filtered through fine 
grad_e filter paper into a distilling flask. At this point 
the extract consisted of 75 to 100 ml. of a pale yellow liquid 
having an odour suggestive of buckwheat honey. 

This extract was evaporated under reduced pressure, 

o 

using a water bath at 45 to 50 C., until the volume approxi¬ 
mated 10 ml. Ten millilitres of sterile distilled water was 
then added, forming a yelloYfish opaque emulsion, sometimes 
with macroscopic oily droplets. Concentration was continued 
with shaking until the volume was again about 10 ml. 

In one case a similar extraction using acetone was 
carried out on the residue remaining after the ether extraction. 
This a.cetone extract was concentrated in a similar manner.

sion broth (Difco) inoculated with Staphylococcus and incu¬ 
bated at 37 C. for 24 hours and at room temperature (20-25°C.) 
for an additional 4$ hours was serially extracted with five 
150 ml. volumes of di-ethyl ether. The extract was separated 
by centrifugation and concentrated in the manner described 
under Method One. 


Method Three 

Staphylococcus growth was harvested as in Method 
One. The harvest was placed in the extraction thimble of a 
Soxhlet Continuous Extraction Apparatus and extracted with 
75 ml. of di-ethyl ether at 45 to 50°C. continuously for four 
hours. This extract was concentrated in the manner described 
in Method One. 

Titrat io n Methods : 


One cubic centimetre volumes of the aforementioned 

Dubos 1 medium were used in screw capped test tubes. 

Doubling dilutions of extracts were made with sterile 

precautions in these amounts. Each tube was then inoculated 

with one drop of a 1:10,000 dilution of the tubercle bacilli 

grown in Dubos* medium for several days. The growth in Dubos* 

medium had a characteristic almost ropy character, but was 

easily evenly suspended by shaking. Incubation was carried 
o 

out at 37 C. and readings made daily. Slowing of growth as 
well as complete inhibition was often observed.

Titration of Staphylococcus extracts 


against Mycobacterium

Some of the Inhibitory Titres of Various Extracts 























































Summary 


Chart Thirteen illustrates certain properties of the 
extracts of Staphylococcus . These are: 

(a) The titres of the extracts vary markedly. 

(b) There are several instances of inconsistency in two 
titrations of the same extract at different times, 

(e.g., EESox 2 and EEG 6). 

(c) The introduction of blood serum into the medium 
practically wipes out the inhibitory effect of the 
extracts. 

(d) Filtration through an asbestos filter pad removes 
most of the inhibitory effect of the extracts. 

(e) Heating to 100 C. for 15 minutes removes some of the 
inhibitory effect of the extracts. 

It is clear, however, that ether extraction of the 
bodies of Staphylococcus strain 1B7 yields a preparation which 
under certain conditions is markedly inhibitory to the growth 
of Mycobacterium strain 192. 

Our titration results obviously emphasized the neces¬ 
sity of further standardization of the titration procedure, and 
the method of extraction. We therefore set up an experiment 
in which it was proposed to make a number of extractions and 
titrations under carefully standardized conditions. In order 
to avoid changes of the tubercle bacilli due to continued pas¬ 
sage through Dubos 1 medium, we returned to a Loewenstein cul¬ 
ture of Mycobacterium strain 192. To our surprise, none of the

fifty-six titrations on seven new extracts showed any growth 
at all, even in control tubes containing no inhibiting agent. 
We then re-investigated the Dubos-passaged strain (which by 
this time had been passed through Dubos ? medium nine times) 
and found that the strain would now grow up overnight on 
Loewenstein medium and even on plain agar medium, and that 
it had lost its pathogenicity for guinea pigs. We have tried 
to reproduce this apparent change in character of Mycobacter - 
ium strain 192 without success. We are unable to say whether 
it really was a change, or whether at some stage we mixed it 
with a fast-growing, non-pathogenic strain. 

Because of these difficulties we turned to experi¬ 
ments designed to reveal the reasons for the absence of growth 
in our latest titrations. Studies of Dubos 1 recently publish¬ 
ed papers on the subject helped us considerably. The main 
difficulty which is emphasized by Dubos is the hydrolysis of 
Tween 80, with the production of small amounts of long chain 
unsaturated fatty acids. These fatty acids inhibit the growth 
of tubercle bacilli (30, 38). This inhibition may be coun¬ 
tered by the introduction of a small amount of serum albumin 
into the medium. Tween 80, the commercial product always con¬ 
tains small amounts of fatty acids, and when the medium is 
made up, hydrolysis tends to occur slowly so that if albumin 
is not used the medium may become inhibitory over a period of 
time. 

Our work confirmed the observation of Dubos 1 et al. 
that smaller inocula would suffice in the presence of albumin. 
In its absence, using the slow-growing strain of Mycobacterium

192, a drop of undiluted culture as inoculum for each 5.0 c.c. 
volume of medium was required before growth could be consis¬ 
tently obtained; whereas with albumin, a drop of culture dilu¬ 
ted as much as 1 in 100 sufficed. However, we are of the 
opinion (but on the basis of slight experimental evidence) that if 
Tween 80 is purified by a method reported by Davis, to be pub¬ 
lished shortly (39), and, used without albumin, growth is bet¬ 
ter, than with unpurified Tween 80 though not usually as rapid 
as when albumin is used. 

Our study of the factors influencing the growth of 
Mycobacterium strain 192 in Dubos T medium led us to the fol¬ 
lowing conclusion. Our main error was in using too small an 
inoculum. (it will be remembered that a drop of a 1:10,000 
dilution of a culture in Dubos 1 medium was used.) In such 
titrations it is our opinion that the Tween 80 that is used 
should be freed of uncombined fatty acid by purification. It 
is necessary to use a medium fd.th.out albumin in the titration 
of Sta/ohylococcus extracts because the albumin removes the in¬ 
hibitory quality of the extracts. Five cubic centimetre vol¬ 
umes of medium per titration tube are better than smaller vol¬ 


umes .

lowing formula (one of Dubos ! modifications of his first med¬ 
ium) (4*0) t

Ethanol extracts of Staphylococcus were attempted. 

The method of extraction used was that of Jansen and Hirsch- 
mann (41)• Unfortunately, it is difficult not to leave some 
living staphylococci using this method of extraction unless 
considerable heat is employed. As we have demonstrated, heat¬ 
ing affects the inhibitory potency of the extracts. We feel 
that we were able to obtain slight inhibition using the ethan¬ 
ol extraction method despite heating. 

A point which sometimes became quite bewildering was 
the variation in the macroscopic character of the growth of 
Mycobacterium strain 192 in the titration series. Originally, 
as observed in earlier titrations, there appeared a small mound 
of sediment in the bottom of the tube which upon gentle shak¬ 
ing swirled upward and became evenly distributed. It seemed, 
ho??ever, to have a certain degree of tenacity and the word 
”ropy tT described it fairly well. In titration series, however, 
the strain sometimes appeared to grow in flakes which settled 
to the bottom of the tubes and although readily suspended by 
shaking, the individual flakes were difficult to break up. of¬ 
ten some of the tubes in a titration series would yield one 
type of growth while others looked entirely dissimilar. Had 





(89 


there been any consistency concerning the presence, absence 
or amount of the inhibitory agent when a particular type of 
growth appeared, it would have been less confusing. 

We felt it would be interesting to see to what ex¬ 
tent oleic acid would inhibit the growth of Mycobacterium 
strain 192 under the conditions in our experiments since Dubos 
emphasizes the inhibiting action of unsaturated fatty acids. 

It seems likely that the inhibition of Mycobacterium growth by 
Staphylococcus on Loewenstein medium might be due to such acids 
(29). In Loewenstein plate experiments using filter paper 
discs soaked in 100 per cent oleic acid an initial inhibitory 
distance (measured from the edge of the filter paper disc to 
the nearest acid-fast growth) of 0.25 centimetres and a final 
inhibitory distance of 0.15 centimetres was obtained. (Com¬ 
pare with results shown in Chart Eleven.) Ten per cent oleic 
acid suspended in Dubos T medium and tested by the filter paper 
disc method gave an initial and final inhibitory distance of 
0.05 centimetres. A filter paper disc soaked in Dubos T medium 
gives no inhibition, nor does 1 per cent or smaller amounts of 
oleic acid. We consider that the total inhibitory action of 
the Staohylococcus extracts can hardly be due to fatty acid 
alone, since Inhibitory potency was considerably lessened by 
heating, pointing to possible enzyme activity. 

With regard to the diffusibility of the inhibitory 
agent, tubercle bacilli were Inoculated into Dubos 1 medium in 
small Erlenmeyer flasks. In each flask was also placed a loop 
of cellophane tubing containing plain broth inoculated with 
Stauhylococcus . Dubos 1 medium, with and without albumin, were 







(90 


both used. These flasks were incubated at 37°C. The tubercle 
bacilli grew well in the Dubos 1 medium whether the cellophane 
tubing contained Staphylococcus or not. Thus, there was no 
significant amount of inhibitory agent excreted into the cul¬ 
ture medium by Staphylococcus which would pass through the 
cellophane barrier. This technique of testing for diffusibil¬ 
ity has been described by Heatley and Florey (4*2) in connec¬ 


tion with colicine.

Summary 

1- Eleven strains of acid-fast bacilli were tested, on Loewen- 
stein medium, for susceptibility to inhibition by 
staphylococci. It was observed that there are marked 
differences among strains of acid-fast bacilli in 
susceptibility to inhibition by staphylococci. 

2: In general, the order of susceptibility is; human, bovine, 
other strains. 

3: In general, but with exceptions, slow-growing strains of 
Mycobacterium are inhibited to a greater extent than 
fast-growing strains. 

JL: Twenty-seven strains of Staphylococcus were tested for in¬ 
hibitory potency toward the growth of Mycobacterium . 
There is a marked variation among Staphylococcus strains 
in inhibitory potency. 

5i Inhibitory potency of Staphylococcus strains could not be 
related to the source, microscopic or colonial mor¬ 
phology, staining reaction, haemolytic activity, lac¬ 
tose or mannite fermentation, coagulase production or 
lipolytic activity of the Staphylococcus strains. 

6: There is a suggestion that there exists a high degree of 

specificity in the relationship between Staphylococcus 
and Mycobacterium .strains.

tory material from Staphylococcus bodies harvested 
from plain agar medium. Extracts from whole broth 
cultures of Staphylococcus are also potent. 

8: The inhibitory material is removed by filtration through 
an asbestos filter pad. 

9: The inhibitory action of such extracts is abolished large¬ 
ly^ if not completely, in the presence of serum 
albumin. For this reason, titration in Dubos* medium 
must be performed in the absence of albumin. (The 
presence of coagulated egg white in Loewenstein med¬ 
ium does not abolish the inhibitory activity.) 

o 

10: Heating of extracts at 100 C. for 15 minutes materially 
reduces the inhibitory potency. 

11: When Mycobacterium and Staphylococcus strains are grown 
in liquid media separated only by a layer of cello¬ 
phane, no inhibition of Mycobacteriurn is observed.
