THE DISTRI ■ ’ m AND J . 5T C' J 


FLAVQBACTEhlUIvI IIALOLORIS 


I. INTRODUCTION 


"Surface taint," which is a butter defect 
characterized by an objectionable odor and flavor, 
has recently received thorough review in a series 
of capers emanating from this department, (,/olochow 
et al, 8--I, III, IV, V, VI; Dunkley et al, 8—II). 

In this series of papers Wolochow et al, (8—VI) 
described a new species, Flavobacterium maloloris , 
which is capable of producing this defect in butter 
manufactured from pasteurized cream inoculated 
with the organism. The work reported in this 
thesis was undertaken to ascertain the distribution 
of this recently isolated organism and to present 
further information in connection with the character¬ 
istics of the species. 













II. HISTORICAL 


Woloohow et al (8—VI) obtained five cultures 
of Flavobacterium maloloris from among 2500 random 
bacterial isolations during a comprehensive study 
on surface taint. The organism, which was believed 
to be newly described, was isolated from the water 
suoply of one Alberta creamery. Isolations were 
made from the water of each of two wells supplying 
the creamery as well as from the creamery tank 
water. These workers report having received two 
cultures of yellow, gram negative rods through the 
courtesy of Dr. B. .7. Hammer, Ames, Iowa. The 
organisms which, he reoorted (3), were encountered 
infrequently in the Iowa studies of putrid butter, 
are identical to, or at least variants of, 
Flavobacterium maloloris.

III. METHODS 


Bacteriological techniques followed in this 
thesis have been described by Woloohow (9), and 
Manual of Methods for Pure Culture Study of 
Bacteria (7). Where the above were inadequate 
for the oreparation of culture media, directions 
outlined in the Manual of De'hydrated Culture 
Media and Reagents (6), were followed. 

For the quantitative determination of volatile 
acids the method adopted was essentially the same 
as that developed by Dunkley (l). Flavobacterium 
maloloris was grown in 1-litre portions of sterile 
skim milk, the pH of the milk having been adjusted 
to approximately 7.0 prior to sterilization. 
Incubation was at room temperature for periods of 
14 to 20 days. Volatile acids "were determined 
for sterile skim milk as well as for skim milk 
cultures of Flavobacterium maloloris . 

The 4-litre quantities of distillates 
collected by steam distilling the 1-litre portions 
mentioned above were titrated with barium hydroxide 
and concentrated. However, after the volatile 
acids were liberated from their barium salts by 
the addition of sulphuric acid, a second steam 










-4- 


distillation was not carried out as Dunkley 
suggests. Duclaux constants were not determined 
for the volatile acids present in the distillate 
until after the oxidation of the formic acid. 
Furthermore, the volatile acids from a number of 
distillations were not bulked and benzene extract¬ 
ions were not employed. 

Except for these alterations, the remainder 
of the procedure was identical with that described 
by Dunkley in his studies of volatile acids. The 
algebraic method described by Gillespie and Walters 
(£), was used for the calculation of the composi¬ 
tions of the acid mixtures. Where quantitative 
measurements of volatile acidities are reported, 
they have been expressed as the equivalent number 
of cc. of 0.1 N. acid. 

In the study of the distribution of Flavo - 
bacterium maloloris, water samples were elated 
on two culture media favorable for the growth of 
the soecies, tryptone-glucose-extract-2/o skim 
milk agar (T.G.E.M.) and nutrient gelatin. A 
series of three dilutions was prepared resulting 
in a total of six inoculated plates from each 
water sample. The gelatin plates were incubated 
at 10°-15°C. while the T.G.E.M. plates were 


























. . .

inoubated at room temperature. The period of 
incubation varied from 3 to 5 days, depending upon 
the amount of growth. At the end of the incubation 
period representative yellow, pigment-producing 
colonies were fished onto nutrient agar slants. 

Since a large number of cultures were isolated 
by this procedure, undoubtedly with some or many 
species duplicates, it was necessary to utilize 
certain bacteriological characteristics in order 
to discard undesirable organisms. Flavobacterium 
maloloris is a small gram negative rod, producing 
a characteristic odor and peptonization in litmus 
milk (Yfolochow et al, 8—VI). Therefore the 
following criteria were used for the selection of 
cultures: 

I. Reaction to the gram stain. 

All gram positive organisms were immediately 
discarded, whether they were rods or cocci. However, 
all gram negative rods and gram negative cocci as 
well as the gram variable organisms v/ere retained. 

£. Reaction in litmus milk. 

This bacteriological test was performed on all 
gram negative cultures as well as on gram variable 
organisms. Only cultures producing the desired 
peptonization v/ere kept for subsequent examinations.

After selection of desirable organisms on 
the basis of the above criteria, each culture 
was given a thorough bacteriological examination 
following the tests outlined on the S.A.B. 
Descriptive Charts. Organisms which appeared 
similar to Flavobacterium maloloris after this 
analysis were inoculated into high temperature 
pasteurized .cream and churned with the butter- 
making assembly used by V/olochow (9) for 
previous investigations. The resulting butters 
were graded for the odor of surface taint by 
those associated with the present study. 

Wolochow 1 s culture Ho. 178 was chosen as a 
representative strain of Flavobacterium maloloris 
and comparisons were made on the basis of the 
characteristics of this culture.

IV. RESULTS 


A. DISTRIBUTION 

Since the organism was first isolated frora 
well waters, (iolochow et al, 8—VI) it was con¬ 
sidered that this is probably a natural habitat 
of the species. Therefore a nrocedure was adopted 
to isolate as many cultures of Flavobacterium 
maloloris as possible from waters (well waters, 
lake waters, river waters, etc.) because this 
would have a direct bearing on its occurence 
and distribution. 

A total of 157 water samples were received 

from the Provincial Laboratory, University of 

Alberta. An additional 3 samples were kindly 

supplied by Dr. I. B. Linneboe, Provincial Dairy 

Analyst. The samples were received in sterile, 

o o 

screw-top bottles and stored at 10 -15 0 until 
ready for use. Table I shows the distribution and 
number of these water samples. 

These water samples were plated using the 
technique previously described. A total of 561 
yellow, pigment-producing organisms were obtained 
by this procedure. An additional 28 cultures 























■ 









-8- 


were received through the courtesy of .tudents in 
Dairy Baoterl Logy o] es. This accounts for an 
aggregate total of 589 cultures which were used 
for subsequent examinations. 

A.fter a microscopic examination of each 
culture using Huoker 1 s modi Lo 'on of tru 
stain, the results presented in fable II were 
obtained. 

Examination of this table shows that 204 
gram positive organisms, including rods and cocci, 
were obtained. These cultures were immediately 
discarded since fflavobaoteriurn mal o loris is a gram 
negative organism. But the remaining 385 cultures, 
which includes the gram variable organisms as well 
as all gram negative cultures, were inoculated into 
litmus milk. 

Of these 385 cultures, only 23 were found to 
be small, gram negative rods producing a peoton- 
ization in litmus milk similar to that described 
by .Volochow et al. Only 2 of these 25 cultures 
have been identified as Flavobacterium maloloris 
after an extensive examination using pure culture 
methods. A marked characteristic of these 2 
cultures is their production of the sweaty feet 
odor in litmus milk. The remaining oi sms

are not susnected of being Flavobacterium m aloloris 
because all have been found to differ quite markedly 
in cultural aspects from this soecies, as will be 
seen from Table III, and none produce the character¬ 
istic sweaty feet odor in litmus milk. 

After an analysis of Table III, the following 
results are obtained. Culture No. 4 differs from 
Flavobacterium maloloris in motility, production 
of indole, hydrolysis of starch and the Methyl Red 
and Voges-Proskauer tests. The differences noticed 
between culture No. 36 and Flavobacterium maloloris 
are in motility, nitrate reduction and production 
of indole. Culture No. 83a differs from this 
species in colonial characteristics, nitrate reduc¬ 
tion, indole production, utilization of citrate 
carbon and Methyl Red test. Colonial characteristics, 
motility, indole production, utilization of citrate 
carbon and starch hydrolysis differentiate culture 
No. 93a. Cultures No. 96 and 96a are unlike 
Flavobacterium maloloris from the stand point of 
motility, nitrate reduction and indole production. 
Culture No. 111a differs in motility, gelatin 
liquefaction, indole production, utilization of 
citrate carbon and the Methyl Red test. Nitrate 
reduction and indole production distinguish cultures 
No. 109a, No. 190a and No. 19^a from Flavobacterium 





















. 







* 



























maloloris. fitra ;e r 

indole production and hydrolysis of starch are the 
contrasting characteristics of culture No. 197a. 
Culture No. 199 differs in indole production, o 
carbon utilization and starch hydrolysis. Colonial 
characteristics, nitrate reduction and utilization 
of citrate carbon are the differential character¬ 
istics of culture No. 244. Culture No. 194, No. 

207a and No. 227 differ from Flavobactprinn maloloris 
in colonial characteristics, motility, indole nro- 
duction, starch hydrolysis and the Methyl Red and 
Voges-Proskauer tests. Colonial characteristics, 
motility, nitrate reduction, citrate carbon utiliz¬ 
ation and starch hydrolysis differ in the case of 
culture No. 58 and this soecies. Culture No. 19, 

No. 136 and 217 exhibit contrasting characteristics 
in production of indole, utilization of citrate 
carbon and the Methyl Red test. 

The characteristics of the two cultures 
previously mentioned, designated as No. 120 and 
No. 190, are identicf 1 ith those of Flavobaoterfun 
maloloris reported by ,/olochow et al (8—VI). 

After churning high temperature pasteurized cream, 
inoculated by the addition of 3 cc. of 24 hour 
broth suspensions of the organisms, defective butters 
were produced which graded surface taint.

However , the surface taint odor pr >ed was 
not as tyoical as one might expect to attain. Even 
the butter manufactured from cream inoculated with 
a reoresentative strain of Flavobacterium maloloris 
(No. 178) would not grade as typical surface taint. 

It must be noted that these results are based upon 
the results of a single experiment. Had it been 
oossible to secure high quality creams, additional 
churnings may have produced more satisfactory and 
definite results. 

A total of nine cultures, including the present 
isolations have now been identified as Flavobacterium 
maloloris or variants. Table IV illustrates the 
designations of these cultures. 

The nine cultures of Flavobacterium maloloris 
presented in this table show exceptional uniformity 
in cultural characteristics. ./olochow et el report 
that one strain of the organism failed to grow on 
agar slants incubated at a temperature of 37°G. 
However, during the present study all cultures 
were found to grow at this temperature although 
growth was not so abundant as at lower incubation 
temperatures. Variations in hydrogen sulphide 
oroduction are also reported by these workers but 
in this investigation all cultures yielded oositive 
results when the lead acetate paper strio technique 
was employed. 









- 12 - 


Minor variations were observed within the 
nine cultures in only a few instances. ,/hen ^rown 
in nutrient broth, the cells of the Iowa cultures 
were found to be somewhat smaller than the cells 
of other cultures after a microscopic measurement 
by use of the Filar micrometer. All of these 
cultures nroduce the sweaty feet odor in litmus 
milk and variations in the intensity of this odor 
are sometimes discernable with the different 
cultures. However, differentiation of cultures 


on this basis is believed unwarranted.

I. Additional characteristics of the Speoies. 

The descriotion of fflavobaoterturn maloloris 
given by Jolochow et al (8—\TT), was checked, 
using techniques described by .folochow (9) and in 
Manual for Pure Culture Study of Bacteria, and 
corresponded to that given by these authors. In 
addition to their description, other characteristic 
were recorded as below. 

Growth in Various Media 


Growth at both room temneiature and ice-box 
,o o . 

^erature (10 -lb C) was greater on North's 
gelatin agar slants (Bacto modification) than on 
any other medium used when incubated at these 
resoective temperatures. Pigment Droduction was 
at a maximum and bright yellow in color. Nith 
nutritive caseinate agar, slant growth was abundant 
while the color of the pigment was a pale yellow 
as compared with that on North* s gelatin agar. 

Using Jamieson's modification of Sullivan's 
"K" Medium (4), growth was moderate and the 
pigment bright yellow-orange in color. 



























- 14 - 


Carbohydrate Fermentation' 


No gas was produced when the organism was 
inoculated into nutrient broths containing Z/o 
of galactose, maltose, mannose, rhamnose, arabinose, 
xylose, raffinose, mannite or dextrin. There was 
no definite utilization of these carbohydrates as 
measured by the color changes of brom thymol blue 
or nhenol red in broth cultures containing them. 


Bacteriostatic Effects of Dyes on G-rowth 

Crystal violet inhibited growth of the organ¬ 
ism in nutrient agar in a concentration greater 
than 1: 5 0,000. G-rowth was inhibited by mercuro- 
chrome in a concentration of between 1:2500 and 
1:5000 using tryptone water as a base. Brilliant 
G-reen in a concentration of 1:200,000 in glucose 
agar also inhibited growth of the organism. These 
results indicate that the organism has comparatively 
strong gram-negative characteristics. 





- 15 - 


U tilization of Citrate Oarbon 


The organism did not i.n Koser 1 s citrate 

medium which contains sodium citrate as the sole 
source of carbon. 


Lioolysis 

The nile blue sulphate method, and modifications 
of this method as described by Long and Hammer (5), 
failed to demostrate lioolysis of butterfat by 
Flavobacterium maloloris . The natural fat technique 
of these authors also yielded negative results. 










II. Volatile Void Production 


Dunkley et al (8—II) obtained "steam dis¬ 
tillate residues" by steam distilling acidified 
skim milk cultures of Pseudomonas autrefaciens 
and evaporating the neutralized distillates to 
dryness. On the basis of quantitative determ¬ 
inations using Duclaux distillations it was 
concluded that these residues contained formic, 
acetic, butyric, and isovaleric acids. 

Flavobacterium maloloris produces an odor 
in skim milk which is essentially the same as that 
produced by Pseudomonas putrefaciens and, since 
both organisms give rise to the same defect in 
commercial butter, it was assumed that the volatile 
acids produced by the former organism would prob¬ 
ably be identical to those produced by Pseudomonas 
outrefaciens . On the basis of this assumption 
Duclaux distillations were used for the quantitat¬ 
ive estimation of the volatile acids produced in 
skim milk cultures of Flavobacterium maloloris . 

Since the Duclaux distillation apparatus 
employed in this study was the same as that used 
by Dunkley, it was believed unnecessary to determine 










































■ 
















- 17 - 


the constants for the pure acids’ again. Therefore, 
the constants of the aforementioned investigator, 
which are oresented in Table V, were used in the 
calculations of the compositions of the mixtures 
of acids. 

The volatile acids obtained by steam distill¬ 
ation of acidified sterile skim milk and skim milk 
cultures of Flavobacterium maloloris were determined 
quantitatively using the modifications of Dunkley 1 s 
(1) procedure oreviously outlined. The formic 
acid was estimated by titration of the acid mixtures 
after oxidation with mercuric oxide, and the com¬ 
positions of the mixtures remaining were calculated 
from Duclaux constants. Typical constants for 
distillates of sterile skim milk and for distillates 
of Flavobaoterium maloloris cultures are presented 
in Tables VI and VII resoectively. These tables 
also contain the total acidities of each distillation, 
expressed on the basis of 0.1 N acid per litre of 
milk distilled. 

Table VIII contains the experimentally determined 
constants from a sterile skim milk distillation which 
most nearly approximated the average of the five sets 
of constants presented in Table VI, together with 
constants calculated for a mixture of acetic, butyric,

and isovaleric acid* This table also contains 
the corresponding data for the distillation of a 
skim milk culture of Flavobacterium malolorls t the 
exnerimental constants being selected from Table VI 
on the same basis as those for sterile milk. 

Table IX shows the quantitative composition 
of the volatile acid mixtures from the sterile 
skim milk and the culture of Flavobacterium maloloris 
which are presented in Table VIII. The total acid 
reported is that determined from these distillations 
and is expressed as c.c. of 0.1 N. acid per litre 
of milk distilled. The figure reported for formic 
acid is the difference between the acidities before 
and after the oxidation, since the loss in acidity 
was assumed to be’due to the destruction of formic 
acid. The results presented in Table IX are illus¬ 
trated diagrammatically in Figure 1. 









V.ilLa.LUg : : 


The distribution of Flavobaoterlum maloloris 
was studied using a relatively simple isolation 
procedure. Although the orocedure apoeared reason¬ 
ably effective, in considering the results reoorted 
it should be recognized that failure to isolate 
Flavobacterium maloloris from a water samnle does 
not necessarily preclude the possibility of its 
presence. 

However, because the organism was isolated so 
infrequently in this investiagtion, one is led to 
believe that the organism does not occur frequently 
in Alberta waters. These results are not contra¬ 
dictory to those reported by Y/olochow et al (8--VI) 
who obtained only 5 cultures of Flavobacterium 
maloloris from 2500 random bacterial isolations. 
Because the organism oroauces a remarkably milder 
attack of the defect, and because cultures v/ere 
isolated so infrequently during their comprehensive 
study of surface taint, these workers believe that 
Flavobacterium maloloris is a minor contributor to 
the defect of surface taint in butter. Hesults 
secured during this oroject would seem to sub- 
staniate this belief. 















- 20 - 


The characteristics of Flavobacterium maloloris 
were found to conform to those described by v/oloohow 
et al (8—VI). A number of additional charater- 
istics are also presented. 

Steam distillations of acidified sterile skim 
milk and cultures of Flavobacterim - Loloris v/ere 
carried out. The formic acid present in the dis¬ 
tillates was destroyed by oxidation and the remaining 
acids were determined quantitatively usin * the 
Duclaux apparatus. The constants calculated for 
mixtures of acetic, butyric, and isovaleric acids 
show sufficiently close agreement with exoerimentally 
determined constants to justify the assumption that 
these acids are present in the distillates obtained 
by the foregoing nrocedure. 

The results also show that the volatile acids 
croduced by Flavobaoterium maloloris when grown in 
sterile skim milk are identical with the volatile 
acids produced by Pseudomonas outrefaciens when 


grown under similar conditions
