PREFACE 


The following report deals with an investigation on electro-osmosis 
carried out by the author from September of 1948 to April of 1950. The 
largest part of the time was consumed in the construction of the necessary 
apparatus and in developing the techniques suitable to the problem to be 
solved. The material used was the typical Calgary silt which composed the 
mass of a mud flow occurring there in June 1948. 

This report is the preliminary step into the large experimental field 
concerned with halting, reversing or redirecting a hydraulic flow net with 
an electric flow net. The various observations that have been made during 
the course of the test are recorded and recommendations for further tests 
have been made. Difficulties encountered and errors made have also been 
included so that future investigators will not have to spend their time 
uselessly. 

The author wishes to thank Dean R. M. Hardy, Prof. J» A. Harle, and 
Prof. T. Blench for their interest in, and direction of the investigation. 
Thanks are also due to Mr, L. Pead whose resourcefulness with construction 
details was deeply appreciated.

GENERAL 

Movement of water through a fine porous mass can "be accomplished "by- 
electro—osmosis, one of the electro kinetic phenomena* Often normal 
methods of ground water control are unsatisfactory and this process can 
"be used to drain fine grained soils to promote stability for example. 

The forces involved may "be used to halt, reverse, or generally redirect 
the hydraulic gradient in the soil mass, that is, they may be used as a 
potential barrier opposing the normal flow, keeping it away from some 
particular area. 

The initial phenomena, was first described by Reuss (6) in 1808 with 
subsequent experimental contributions by Wiedmann (?) and by Q,uencke (8). 
Theoretical development is due mainly to Helmholtz who is responsible for 
the electrical double layer concept. 

The action of electro-osmosis (or electroendosmosis) have been prop¬ 
osed to be as follows:- 

Consider a capillary tube to be filled with a fluid. Due to an 
existing ionic condition in the fluid, the inner wall of the capillary 
becomes coated with an electrical double layer, one charge is on the 
liquid in immediate contact with the capillary and the other on the 
capillary. 

Now, if an external potential difference is applied to the capil¬ 
lary it will cause the movable inner layer to be displaced relative to 
the capillary, its motion depending upon the sign of the electrical 
charge. In pure water the wall, for a great majority of solids, is 
charged negatively with respect to the water and, therefore, the water 
moves towards the negative pole.

THEORETICAL CONSIDERATIONS . 

(Ref,5) The quantity of liquid Q, e moved in unit time through a capillary 
under a potential difference E can he derived from the improved Helmholtz 
equation,

4 t l 


( 1 ) 


where r - the radius of the capillary 
D - the dielectric constant 


§ 


Z the electro-kinetic potential difference 
between the part of the double layer in 
the liquid that is bound to the wall, and 
the part which is free to move 


^ Z the coefficient of viscosity of the liquid

If instead of a capillary we consider a prism of saturated soil 
with base area A in content with the electrodes, and length 1, the 
equation becomesi

Where q is related to the porosity and to the cross section of the 
pore space through which the water moves. 

This can be written as j

termed the electrosmotic permeability, and i e is the electrical potential 
gradient. 

This is very similar in form to Darcy 1 s equation for hydraulic flow 
through a prism of soil; 


. . (3) 



where i I the hydraulic gradient 


A - the cross-sectional area 


k - the permeability of the soil. 


There is, however, a fundamental difference in the two permeabili¬ 
ties in that whereas k g depends mainly on the pore area and is indepen¬ 
dent of the size of the individual pores, k is very strongly influenced 
by the actual pore size. 

This brings us to another important relationship concerning the 
hydraulic pressure which can be built up by electro-osmotic action. 

If the pore water which is moved by osmosis towards or through the cathode 
is allowed to pile up in a standpipe, equilibrium between the electro- 
osmotic and counteracting hydraulic action will be reached gradually. The 
maximum hydraulic pressure at the cathode can be represented for a single 
capillary by the equation;

In contrast to the independence of the quantity of flow with the pore 
size the equilibrium pressure equation (4) does depend on the dimensions 
of the pores.

Practical investigations have revealed that equation (4) is also 
valid for irregular bundles of capillaries such as represented by the 
pores in soils* 

By combining equations (2) and (3) a simplified form for equation 
(4) can be derived: 

- k 

P - e E 

k~ ...... (5) 

Such a form will be found very advantageous for practical purposes, 
as k and k @ can be easily determined. 

The applications of electro-osmosis to the field of engineering 
can be classified as follows: 

(a) By augmenting the natural ground water flow producing 
incremented drainage using equation (2); the Calgary mud flow being an 
example of this* 

(b) To stop the moisture flow to or from a given area by 
pressure method using equation (5). 

(c) A modification of the material characteristics by electro- 
osmotic flow with or without chemicals. 

This research was initiated to investigate (b) above for the case 
of Calgary silt. Por simplicity the elementary arrangement of electrodes 
as used at Calgary was employed. 

Thus the physical problem is to determine if a flow controlled by a 
uniform hydraulic flow net can be stopped or alleviated by suitable 
positions of the electrodes and to confirm that the super positioning of 
the electrical field over the hydraulic flow net resulted in ratios of 
voltage and hydraulic gradients comparable with those obtained by the 
direct testing of samples of the material.

Ref. (12). If the techniques of flow control "by electro-osmosis are then 
proven it will he relatively simple to design electrode arrangements for 
any installation provided the constants of the material are checked by 
laboratory tests and proved suitable for such, application. 

In this research the line of electrodes was placed at 90° to the 
uniform hydraulic flow net. The fact that two such flow nets can be 
combined is shown in Ref. (4) on page 10 where the following equation 
occurs: 

-41V £ ...... (6) 

coefficient of permeability (Darcy) 

Laplacin operator 

hydraulic potential of the ground 
water flow 

dielectric constant of the 
saturated soil 

electrical potential 

electrical charge density of the 
space unit. 

Now t- 0 and therefore the electrical flow net and the hydraulic 
flow net can be applied and combined to determine the conditions of flow 
in a soil mass when two such flow nets are in effect. 

On page 71 in Ref. (6) the mathematical solution for the potential 
variation in an infinite number of positive sources distance 9 a 9 apart 
on one line is given by the following equation:

electrical field from anode to cathode on lines parallel to the line of 
electrodes and at various distances from this line. 

The principle of this thesis was to try to define the potential between 
the anode and cathode that would divert all the hydraulic potential to the 
cathode. This electrical potential was found by first taking a given 
hydraulic potential and increasing the electrical potential in steps until 
the outlet discharge of the prism of saturated soil registered zero at which 
point they were considered balanced. Taking the cases obtained later in the 
experimental results where the applied voltage equalled 25 volts, Graph 2

The flow net corresponding to the electrical field having been 
converted to terms of hydraulic potential can now be combined vectorially 
with the hydraulic flow net by conventional methods* Graph 3 shows such 
a combination and indicates how the flow from the top of the apparatus is 
all diverted to the cathodes for the potentials given. Under such circum¬ 
stances the anode would have to produce water as a source if the flow net 
were to apply for an indefinite period; actually there is no supply of 
fluid from the anode and the net would soon alter because the soil around 
the anode would dry out, Eowever, if the voltage were just short of adequate 
to divert all originally vertical flow lines to the cathode, we should expect 
the flow net to apply for an indefinite time. Under those circumstances the 
method of constructing the combined net shows that increasing the hydraulic 
gradient in a given ratio would require increasing the electrical gradient 
in the same ratio to preserve the flow pattern; in other words, the graph of 
voltage to first produce cut-off of flow against original hydraulic gradient

APPARATUS 

Stage 1 - Winter ! 48 

The apparatus at this initial stage consisted of a wooden box six 
feet long, two feet wide and one and a half feet deep containing a soil 
mass four feet long by two feet wide by one and one half feet deep as 
shown in figure (l). The water flows horizontally through the box with 
the anode and cathode placed so that the current will flow in effect at 
right angles to the flow of water* There were six piezometer tips and 
fifteen electrical probes spaced as shown in Pig* (l) and Photo (l). 

Stage (l) is shown completely assembled in Photo (2), 

The main difficulty encountered was the channelling between the 
top of the soil and the removable lid of the box* This was brought about 
because the soil was placed in a wet condition and consolidated due to its 
own weight, local vibration and the application of current driving water 
off at the cathode (estimated total consolidation equal to 9$ by height)* 
More soil was added and then a bentonite layer, but channelling proceeded 
with the result that this apparatus had to be discarded* 

Prom field experience in Calgary, June 19^8, it was thought that the 
flow of soil water would be sufficient to operate an ordinary manometer 
system but it was later realized that this was not so in a laboratory 
model* The system constructed demanded too much water to record accura¬ 
tely quick changes of pressure and combined with an unsuccessful attempt 
to remove entrapped air from the lines no readings of hydrostatic pressures 
were obtained. 

Some readings of electrical resistivity along approximate flow lines 
were obtained, their intrinsic values being difficult to interpret*

Some conclusions were derived from this stage: 

(a) All members of the box must he rigid so that the only- 
volume change would he in the soil mass itself. Large wooden boxes 
such as this do not fulfill this requirement without becoming very- 
unwieldy and this lack of rigidity accentuated the channelling difficulty. 

(h) The problem of channelling could possibly be stopped by the 
use of baffles combined with the bentonite along the top of the soil. 

(c) The scale was unnecessarily large and the future procedure 
became to get a model that one man could manage without so much difficulty. 

(d) The air removal problem from the pressure lines had to be 
given more consideration if successful recording was to be accomplished. 

Stage 11 - Spring and gall *49 

This apparatus was designed to a one third scale of the original 
in stage one and constructed of lucite for possible observation of 
channelling. The previous conclusions were utilized in the fact that the 
box was extremely rigid and baffles were built in the removable top. 
Channelling still persisted even with this baffle~bentonite combination, 
and in addition to the piezometer tips silting up this stage of the work 
was brought to an end. 

Photograph 3 shows stage 2 completely assembled. The oscilloscope 
and slide wire potentiometer were to be used to measure the electrical 
resistivity as in stage 1 but no readings were obtained because of the 
unsuccessful solution of the channelling problem. In stage 3 measurement 
of electrical resistivity was not continued, rather all effort being 
concentrated on the main problems of measuring the piezometer pressures 
and stopping channelling.

Conclusions drawn from stage 2 consisted in the sole fact that the 
changes in design although appreciable had not been carried far enough.

Stage 111 - Late Fall *49 and. Spring of 150 

This stage started with the objects of; 

(a) Obtaining a method of measuring pressure with negligible flow 
of soil water into the manometer system, thereby ensuring rapid and accur¬ 
ate recording. 

(b) Stopping the channelling by method of design. 

The first problem resulted in the following solutions; 

(a) Using the piezometer pressure to deflect a diaphram forming 
one plate of a sensitive variable condenser hooked to a stable tuned 
circuit and calibrating pressure against voltage or frequency change. 

This is shown and completely described in the appendix Electronic Pressure 
Cell*. 

The instrument as finally devised was thoroughly satisfactory. Unfor¬ 
tunately it was not found feasible, at this stage, to devise a system of 
valves and connections that would permit one cell to be connected to the 
thirty piezometer points in the new electrosmotic cell without causing 
trouble from included air and volume changes within the pressure measuring 
system itself. The use of one electronic pressure cell per piezometer tip, 
or per small group of tips, was debarred by cost. 

(b) The second system is very simple being based on a water filled 
capillary tube with air sealed in above the water column. This gauge works 
on the General Gas Law,

This gauge, as the General Gas Law states, is sensitive to tempera¬ 
ture changes hut these can he accounted for, although in this case the 
temperature changes were unappreciahle throughout the duration of the 
critical ohservations. 

Channelling was eliminated by having the water flow vertically through 
the soil mass so that consolidation of the soil mass would only serve to 
tighten it against the walls of the electrosmotic cell. 

Figure 2 shows the hydraulic and electrical circuits for the opera¬ 
tion of the electrosmotic cell. Figure 3 shows a more detailed layout of 
the piezometer tubes, pressure measuring system and the anode and cathode. 
The anode was made of steel since in the field this is the material that 
would he used. The cathode and piezometer tubes were made of brass. Since 
there is no electrolytic action involved in these parts the material would 
not necessarily have to correspond with the material in the field. 

Assuming a length of time between pressure readings and considering 
the piezometer tips acting as well points an allowable volume change for 
measuring pressure was arrived at. Now using the gas lav/ a. volume of 
capillary tube was determined. The accuracy of pressure measurement depends 
on the distance through which the v/ater surface in the capillary tube can 
move. Therefore, within reason, the finer the bore of the capillary tube 
the easier it will be to record pressure changes. The finest bore obtain¬ 
able at the time, being 0.05 cms,, was used.

PROCEDURE 

The electrosmotic cell or box in stage three was constructed of one- 
quarter inch sheet lucite using chloroform as the joining agent with a 
porous bronze plate three-quarters of an inch above the bottom through 
which the water drained to the downstream stand pipe and was recorded 
as or The remainder of the system consisted of saran tubing 

and lucite reservoirs appropriately arranged for easy removal of air, 

(See Pig, (2) )• The system was filled with a solution of blue ink in 
distilled water which was allowed to drain through the cloth covered 
piezometer tips into the fine bore rubber pressure tubing into the capil¬ 
lary tubes. After a period of draining the air was removed from the 
pressure measuring system and the box was isolated from the other parts of 
the system. The meniscus in the capillary tubes was drawn down so that 
there was approximately 35 cms, of air at atmospheric pressure in each tube. 
They were then sealed, with cigarette paper and acetone dope, from atmosphere 
and the box was connected with the rest of the system again and distilled 
water flushed through until the dye solution had been removed. This left a 
dye solution in the capillary tubes making it easier to read the meniscus 
changes due to piezometer pressure. 

The Calgary silt was prepared in a wet uniform mix and with the lid 
removed, was deposited in the water filled box. The outside of the box 
was tapped to consolidate the silt as it was put in and a noticeable increase 
in guage pressure occurred which is thought to be due to the excess pore 
pressure in the soil mass caused by consolidation. 

The lid was secured in place and a hydraulic gradient applied. The 

^inlet or Was measure< ^ b V timing a dye face passing through a capillary 

tube with a centimeter scale behind it and the Q, or Q, by taking the 

outlet o

discharge from the downstream stand pipe. The coefficient of natural 
permeability was found to vary from 8.3 X 10 cms/sec. at the outset to 
1.8 X 10 ^ cms/sec. at the end of the tests. The amount of consolidation 
throughout the tests was about ten percent by height of the soil mass. 

With a known hydraulic gradient applied the pressure readings were 

taken and Q,. and Q, determined. A known voltage was applied and the cathodes 
1 0 

were allowed to drain. After a lapse of ten minutes the pressure readings 
were again recorded along with Q, q and Q, ca-thode or Q,^ and current flow 
to each cathode. This process was repeated at ten or twenty minute periods 
until the pressure became stabilized at which time (generally thirty to 
seventy minutes after start of test) the voltage was turned off. In an 
effort to get back to the initial conditions a period of twelve to twenty- 
four hours was now allowed for the water to flow through the soil mass to 
replace any water that was drawn off at the cathode. Ideally the soil should 
have been replaced after every test run, but time and equipment were lacking. 

This process was repeated for voltages of 1,2,3,^, nominal volts/cms. 
at a hydraulic gradient of 5*5»» l,s,5 nominal volts/cms. at a hydraulic 
gradient of 8.0 and 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 nominal volts/cms. at a hydraulic 
gradient of 3*0.

TESTS RESULTS AHD DISCUSSION 

The soil used in tests was typical Calgary silt, obtained from a 
mud flow which occurred there in June 1948. It has the following 
properties:

@ 14.4$ M.C. 

This classifies the soil as a very silty sand, practically impervious, or 
an A2 by the Public Roads Administration Standard; the electrosmotic soil 
constants obtained by S.R. Hayden in 1949 (Ref.12) for this material are, 
k- 6.9 X 10 - ' cms./sec. k g - lx 10 oms. /volt sec. 
h 2 14.5 U 

-6 

The k obtained in the present tests varied from 1.8 to 8.3 X 10 
cms./sec. being a somewhs.t larger value than that obtained by S.R. Hayden. 

The difference can be accounted for in the fact that his apparatus had an 
applied load on the prism of soil helping to consolidate it whereas these 
experiments had none. 

The Graphs 4,5, and 6 indicate how a voltage applied at right angles to a 
hydraulic gradient can reduce the total flow through the cross-section of the 
soil mass to any desired level. The initial discharge rates when different 
voltages are switched on may be expected to be the same under ideal conditions. 
In these tests they varied, the considerable differences may be due to; 

(l) The soil mass receives a pressure shock when the voltage is 


suddenly changed

(2) Drying out at the cathode during previous tests allows entrance 
of air, that is, it causes capillary pressures to arise. 

(3) Displacement of soil occurs under flow, particularly near the 
electrodes. 

The soil apparently recovers again and the differences can he in 
opposed directions (e.g. G-raph 6). This may he explicable in terms of 
(l) above since a shock may cause pulsation of the pore water, or expli¬ 
cable in terms of the re-suspension of the colloidal material when flow 
stops. In an attempt to minimize the effect of the disturbances the 
hydraulic gradient was applied from 12 to 24 hours between applications 
of electric current. In spite of precautions no control over the permea¬ 
bility was obtained and by the end of the first test the total of 8$ 
consolidation by height was observed. More soil was added, and this in 
turn settled, the final consolidation being approximately 10$ of the total 
height. 

In spite of the differences in Q, q at the starting time all curves fall 
asymptotically to Q, values that showed no obvious anomalies. Possibly flow 
for some period tends to set up a steady state. Therefore the next step was 
taken by plotting the applied volts versus the asymptotic discharges that 
they permitted, for each of the three applied hydraulic gradients, shown in 
Graph 7,8, and 9* The determination of Qq became very difficult as it got 
small, but when it equalled zero the determination was fairly easy. This is 
due to the fact that the outlet discharge tube had a one-eighth inch inside 
diameter and the meniscus of the water could be observed. In the first test 
the meniscus was seen to retreat in the tube, indicating that the applied 
voltage was slightly more than necessary to stop flow through the prism of 
soil. The last two tests were closer to the balance between applied voltage

and hydraulic gradient and the meniscus was noticed to hold quite steady 
upon attaining zero. 

The final step was plotting these voltages required to nullify the 
given hydraulic gradients from Graphs 7t 8, and 9 and is shown in the 
linear relation in Graph 10, This is the proportionality stated in the 
theory between these two functions. The slope of the line is equal to 
0,64 volts/cm, per unit hydraulic gradient which could be called the 
•‘Control Volts per Unit Hydraulic Gradient 11 for Calgary silt. The 
theoretical reasons why this gradient should exist as a constant are 
given previously; the linear law would not be expected to hold for voltages 
in excess of those required to just stop the flow through the prism of 
saturated soil. It is expected that the value of this controlling- voltage 
per unit hydraulic gradient should vary from a low in clays to a high in 
the very coarse silts. 

Graphs 11, 12 and 13 show the total pressure drop for each combina¬ 
tion of voltage and hydraulic gradient after flow has become steady. The 
gauges read a combination of norms.! hydrostatic heads plus that due to the 
electrosmotic effect. Consolidation pressures should be absent since the 
flow lines have become steady. Each guage for complete accuracy should 
have had a separate calibration curve, but the small amount of variation 
between the capillary tube gu&ges allowed the use of one calibration curve 
for all thirty guages in these tests. The temperature during the length 
of time required for each test was constant for all practical purposes. 

It was expected that the pressure would be least affected by the 
applied voltage at the most upstream piezometer tips and most just down¬ 
stream of the anode and to either side of it. This was found to be true 
and the pattern of pressure drop was as expected throughout, varying in 
amount in some proportion to the applied voltage.

SUMMARY ADD RECOMMENDATIONS 

This research represents a preliminary investigation and before 
detailed conclusions can he drawn many more soil types must he used in 
combination with the following: 

1. Oriental ion of the line of electrodes to the hydraulic gradient 
to he varied between 0°- 180°. 

2. The effect of included air in the soil mass, 

3. The effect of temperature, 

4. Displacement of colloids in the soil, 

5. Settlement* 

6. Polarization* 

7* Electro-chemical change. 

In summary: 

I. The hydraulic gradient and the applied potential at 90° to one 
another have a definite proportionality when balanced so that the discharge 
through the cross-section of saturated soil is just halted. The relation 
is volts / cm. / unit hydraulic gradient and is equal to 0.64 for Calgary 
silt. 

II. The natural permeability of the soil decreases during testing 
and this is due mainly to consolidation, but does not seem to affect the 
quantitative results seriously. 

III. The applied voltage helps to consolidate the soil mass, in 
this case amounting to about ten percent of the height of the soil mass, 

IV. It is thought that the change in permeability of the soil mass 
may also change eventually by the electric current changing the physical 
properties of the soil.

- Suggestions for Future Work - 

(a) The electrosmotic cell he so constructed that the soil mass 
can he frequently changed without the entrance of air into the pressure 
measuring system. That is the cell should have a removable side as well 
as the removable top, and the change of soil completed underwater to 
prevent the entrance of air into the apparatus. 

(h) The pressure measuring system, especially the capillary tubes, 
be of fine bore, (less than the 0.0474 cms. diameter used in these tests) so 
that a greater length can be utilized to read the pressures more accurately. 
The use of a compound to destroy the surface tension in the capillary tube 
end thus prevent shattering the meniscus would be advisable. It might be 
added that the rubber pressure tubing used to connect the piezometer tips 
to the capillary gauges was an ideal material having unappreciable volume 
changes coupled with extreme versatility in construction. 

(c) Some more accurate means for determing and , such as 
measuring the velocity of a bubble of coloured fluid, that does not mix 
with water, flowing through a capillary tube. 

(d) Since in the field hydraulic gradients of magnitudes used here 
are rarely found, it is also suggested that future work be conducted in the 
lower ranges, and further because low electrical potential gradients will be 
used in the field. Such a programme would further increa.se the importance 
of (b) and (c) above. 

(e) With more accurate pressure determination it would be justifiable 
to use graphs such as 11, 12 and 13 to determine the flow net within the mass 
of the soil, and therefore check the theoretical flow nets. 

(f) The use of the Electronic Pressure Cell would produce accurate 
pressure determinations which could be used as suggested in (e) above.

ELECTRONIC PRESSURE CELL 

The cell was one of the means considered to measure pressure with 
little volume change as mentioned in the section on apparatus. The 
accompanying sketch gives the critical dimensions of the one designed, 
hut this could he varied depending on the allowable volume change, with 
appropriate changes, in the electronic circuit* 

For hest results it should he kept at a uniform temperature and he 
made as small as the governing dimensions and the removal of air will 
allow. Following is the description of the electronic circuit* 

MEASUREMENT OF PRESSURE BY ELECTRONIC MEANS 

The equipment used in the initial test circuit is shown in the 
accompanying diagram* A description of this equipment is as followsj- 

A cell was designed so that changes in pressure on a metal surface 
brought about a change in electrical capacity between this and another nearby 
metal surface. 

The amount of change in capacity is shown by Graph No* 1* page 28. 

The capacity of the cell is added in parallel to the capacity of the 
tuning condenser of the oscillator. Then, as the pressure changes, the 
capacity of the oscillator tuned circuit changes accordingly, thereby changing 
the oscillator frequency* The output from the oscillator is then fed to the 
discriminator. 

Briefly, the function of the discriminator is to produce a D.C.voltage 
output which is directly proportional to the input frequency. The relation-

ship, as shown by the sketch below, is only linear over a limited range 
of frequency.

In this equipment only the positive portion of the curve was used so 
as to be able to use a voltmeter of one polarity all the time. By proper 
arrangement, however, use could be made of the whole range of linearity. 

It might be added that it was found necessary to use a vacuum tube volt¬ 
meter as the ordinary voltmeter produced too great a loading effect on the 
discriminator. To summarize then, the D.C. output voltage of the discrimina¬ 
tor was made to vary with the change in pressure on the cell. 

Results of Tests 

Two tests were carried out over a range in pressure of 0 to 100 cm. of 
water. The first test was carried out for 20 values of pressure, the second 
served as a check. 

The resulting curves were found to be quite linear with the second dis¬ 
placed slightly from the first. This was actually due to our inability to 
keep lead wires from the cell, etc. in one position necessary to obtain a, good 
zero balance. However, had a correct zero balance been obtained, it may be 


seen that the two curves would be coincident

The total change in capacity was l6 micro-micro-farads for a total 
change in pressure of 100 cm. This resulted in a change of output voltage 
of from 0 to 3 volts or 0.03 volts per cm. of pressure. 

For measuring higher pressures a hack pressure may he applied to the 
cell. The effect of changes in amplitude of the oscillator voltage has 
been omitted since in this test they were not too great. This, however, 
would have to he overcome if the equipment was to he used continuously. 

Methods for doing this and obtaining a much more stable circuit are dis¬ 
cussed under the section "recommendations for Future Use 11 . 

Recommendations for Future Use 

In the opinion of the writer a much better circuit could he used to give 
high stability. The preferable way of doing this would he to use an "Automatic 
Amplitude Stabilized Oscillator". (See Reference 1 ). This is an oscillator 
in which the amplitude of the output voltage remains constant as the frequency 
is changed. 

Instead of using a discriminator, it would he better to use a Ratio 
Detector. The difference between these is that a discriminator is sensitive 
not only to frequency changes but, to some extent, to changes in ajnplitude of 
the applied signal. A Ratio Detector (see Reference Z) overcomes this disad¬ 
vantage and responds only to changes in frequency. 

The Power Supply for the oscillator should be well regulated to minimize 
changes in frequency due to fluctuations in voltage. 

Another method of keeping the voltage constant using an ordinary oscillator 
and a discriminator is to put a limiter (see reference 2) between the oscillator 
and discriminator. The limiter will give a constant output voltage for changes 
in frequency as long as the input voltage to the limiter is above a certain

value. Both methods necessitate using a Vacuum Tube Voltmeter to indicate 
output as an ordinary voltmeter loads the circuit too much. However, a 
very satisfactory and simple V.T.V.M. can he built right into the unit 
without increasing the expense more than a few dollars excepting the 
actual meter used to indicate output.
