THE BOUND WATER OF WHEAT-FLOUR SUSPENSIONS 
IN RELATION TO BAKING STRENGTH. 


By William Harrison Cook, 


INTRODUCTION. 


The ability of flour to make good bread is designated 
in the trade as "strength TT a strong flour is usually 
defined as one which will make large well-piled leaves of 
good texture and color. The qualification 'well-piled’ 
excludes flours which yield large loaves that in rising do 
not maintain a good shape. Loaf volume, however, is the 
only factor that lends itself to quantitative estimation; 
hence it is regarded as the best index to strength. 

Research has done much to elucidate the factors com¬ 
prised in strength. Protein content and diastatic activity 
are definitely correlated with loaf volume, but the magnitude 
of these correlations, especially those obtained in the case 
of durum wheats, suggest that some other factor is important 
in determining the strength of flour. Experimental evidence 
shows this factor to be the quality, or colloidal properties, 
of the gluten. ny gluten quality we mean its possession of 
a large degree of elasticity, combined with a capability of 
absorbing a large amount of water without losing its coherence.

The hydration capacity of the gluten proteins should 
therefore he related to quality. viscosity, a standard 

measure of hydration in emusiod colloids, has failed to show 
a definite relationship to baking strength. There is evi¬ 
dence to support the belief that viscosity is not a reliable 
index of hydration under the conditions prevailing in flour 
suspensions. To elucidate further the colloidal behaviour 
of gluten, the hydration capacity of flour suspensions has#in 
the work now reported,been measured by a new method. 


HE VIEW 

Crude Protein , 

The crude protein content of wheat received early consider¬ 
ation in connection with baking strength. In spite c£ the 
fact that it is a direct index to the amount of gluten, numerous 
investigations have shown it to be unreliable for the comparison 
of strength in different classes of wheat. Snyder (60) consider¬ 
ed that the quality of the gluten was more important than the 
quantity, since the addition of 20 percent of starch to flour 
did not affect its baking quality. In contradiction to this, 
Johnson and bailey (35) found that the gluten showed decreased 
strength when diluted with pure starch. Roberts (52) found 
the bread wheats to contain less protein than the durum wheats; 
this is the reverse of their relative baking strength. Thomas

(63) found high protein content was generally accompanied 
by high strength, but the relation between these two factors 
varied with the class of wheat, and extremely high protein 
content was sometimes accompanied by decreased strength. 

Similar results were obtained by bailey and Sherwood (5) who 
state that the increase in loaf volume, with each unit increment 
of increase of protein, diminished with increasing percentage 
of protein, Shis indicates that above a certain value 
additional protein does not increase the baking strength. 

Further correlations between protein content and loaf volume 
have been shown by Mangels and Sanderson (42) and Mangels (41), 
The magnitude of the correlation, however, shows that the pro¬ 
tein content can not be the sole factor in determining strength, 
and the effect of protein quality and diastatic activity are 
suggested. fhe durum wheats gave lower correlation co¬ 
efficients than the hard red spring wheats, and the effect 
of protein quality is brought forward to explain this difference, 
Coleman, Dixon and mellows (13) conclude, after testing various 
methods, that the crude protein test is the best single-factor 
test of baking quality. 

Crude Gluten . 

Crude gluten determinations are made by washing the starch 
from flour and weighing the gluten in either the wet or dry form. 
As well as giving an index to the amount of gluten, this test

gives an indication of the flour strength from the physical 
properties of the washed gluten. r i'he determination, how¬ 
ever, is empirical in nature and is subject to many errors, 
chief of v/hich are, the judgment of the operator and the 
character of the solution used for washing the gluten. Tap 
water has been shown to give different results in different 
localities, while distilled water causes considerable dispers¬ 
ion of the protein (18). Among different workers, the test 
seldom shov/s parallelism to baking strength, but it is still 
commonly used by individual chemists for evaluating flours. 
Ooleman et al (13) found it gave good results in the hands of 
a single operator; being next in merit to the crude protein 
determination. 

Various mechanical strength testers have been brought out 
in order to express quantitatively the quality of the hand¬ 
washed gluten, as shown by coherence and elasticity. They 
are, however, subject to the same errors as the crude gluten 
determinations, and concordant results are seldom obtained by 
different workers. 


Gas hetention 

Another method of testing strength has been proposed by 
Bailey (1) Y/hich is based on the power of a strong flour to 
retain the carbon dioxide produced within the dough during 
fermentation. According to Bailey, "The strength of flour

is determined by the ratio between the rate of production 
of carbon dioxide in, and the rate of loss of carbon dioxide 
from, the fermenting mass of dough,” A close relation was 
found between expansion of dough and volume of loaf. Results 
obtained by Bailey and Wiegley f6) and by Johnson and Bailey 
(35) show quite definitely that the rate of expansion is 
greater in strong-flour than in weak-flour doughs. Since the 
rate of expansion is synonymous with gas retention, it can be 
said that this is a property of strong flours 


The Wheat Proteins , 

Osburne (48) reported extensive studies on the flour 
proteins. He records these as belonging to five distinct 
classes, their separation being based on their solubilities 
in different solvents. These proteins are:- a prolamine, 
gliadin; a glutelin, glutenin; an albumin, leucosin; a 
globulin, and a proteose. Hoffman and Fortner (32) carried 
out a complete analysis for the various proteins in a sample 
of flour, and could detect no proteose, while they consider 
the presence of a true globulin problematical. uortner 
and his co-workers (24,26) have since shown that the salt- 
soluble proteins of flour, vary in amount with different salt 
solutions. Normal potassium iodide extracted 63.89 percent 
of the total protein from twelve flours. As the usual

solution of 5 percent potassium sulphate dissolves about 
10 to 15 percent of the total protein, it is clear that 
the amount of protein that will be dissolved by a salt 
solution depends more on the ions yielded by the salt, than 
on the type of protein present in the flour. The globulin, 
once believed to exist in wheat flour, may have been merely 
the product of peptization of other proteins. 

In connection with the above study Fortner (29) found 
that the salt solutions varied in their ability to peptize 
proteins from different flours. In this way he confirmed 
the results of some earlier work (25) that the proteins of a 
weak flour were more easily dispersed than those of a strong 
flour. The best salt solution for this fctudy was found to 
be normal magnesium sulphate which gave a correlation co¬ 
efficient of -0.925^0.028 between protein extracted and loaf 
volume. This is the most promising test of protein quality 
so far suggested, but the data available are too meagre to 
justify definite conclusions. further evidence supporting 
the idea that the proteins of strong flour are less soluble 
than those of a weak flour is reported by nosseaux and sirot 
(53,59). They found that the ratio of water-soluble protein 
to total protein in good flours was 1:5.72, while flours that 
gave a ratio of 1:5.20 were considered weak. 

u-lutenin and gliadin constitute the gluten proteins and 
are the most important from the standpoint of strength.

Gliadin is soluble in seventy percent alcohol while the 
glutenin is not; the latter is most soluble in dilute 
alkalies. After Osborne and Yoorhees (49) had demonstrated 
the existance of the above proteins they began to receive 
attention. J’leurent (22) claimed that baking strength 
depended on the ratio of gliadin to glutenin and found the 
optimum to be 72:25. Snyder (59) supported this view but 
found the optimum ratio to be 65:35. Later workers present¬ 
ed contradictory evidence as to the value of this ratio as a 
quality factor. ihis determination finally fell into dis¬ 
repute owing to the difficulty of determining accurately the 
amounts of these proteins as they exist in flour. fhe 
trouble lies in their over-lapping solubilities. Some of 

the salt-soluble proteins are soluble in seventy percent 
alcohol (57) while'-on the other hand the solubility of gliadin 
in water and saline solutions has been demonstrated (3,57,62). 
Kecently numerous investigators (7,9,11,27,57) using more 
reliable methods, have shown that the ratio of gliadin to 
glutenin in the ordinary types of flours appears to be 
relatively constant; at least this ratio has little, if any, 
relation to baking strength. 

Investigations on ?/heat-f lour proteins by widely different 
methods (29,57,66) have 3e d to the conclusion that glutenin 
is the most important of the two gluten proteins from the 
standpoint of strength. uiven with the recently developed

methods for the estimation of this protein, however, workers 
(12,27,40) have been -unable to demonstrate any positive 
relation 'between the amount of glutenin present and the 
strength of flour. 

Chemical constitution of the proteins - Hlish (7) and 
u ross and Swain (14) subjected the individual proteins to 
analysis by the van slyke method, and concluded that as far 
as this method would show, the corresponding proteins from 
a strong and week flour were identical, Woodman (66) 
concludes from specific rotation, and racemization in dilute 
alkali, that the gliadins from a strong and weak flour are 
identical. Prom a similar study of the glutenins he concludes 
that they are different, and suggests that a strong wheat 
synthesises one type of glutenin and a weak wheat another type, 
rlish and Pinckney (10) examined, with respect to their optical 
properties, seven wheats from different types and varieties, and 
could detect no difference, except in the glutenin from Polish 
wheat. Halton (29) confirms the results of Woodman, using 
four wheats. He further reports the separation of two glutenins 
by fractional precipitation with acid from alkaline solution, 

The two fractions exhibited different optical rotation but were 
identical in nitrogen content. blish (8) again calls this work 
in question, and presents experimental evidence to show that 
glutenin is a chemical entity which can not be fractionated. He 
found that glutenin which had been previously racemised, even to

a slight degree, gave rise to two types of protein having 
different isoeleotrio points, which made separation by 
fractional precipitation with acid possible. He therefore 
attributes Halton , s results to the occurrence of slightly 
racemization or denaturation during the latter T s manipulations. 
Gsonka and Jones (15) claim to have separated two glutenins 
from wheat flour by fractional precipitation with ammonium 
sulphate, 'The fractions had a different nitrogen content 
and a v a n Slyke analysis yielded different amounts of some of 
the amino acids, Kotation dispersion, refractive dispersion 
and absorption spectra were determined by Pingwall (19) and 
failed to demonstrate differences between either the glutenins 
or gliadins from strong and weak flours, beyond the errors of 
the method. 


Colloidal Investiga t ions . 

i'he constant failure of the aforementioned tests and 
chemical measurements to detect differences in the wheat pro¬ 
teins centered attention on their colloidal properties. i'he 
action of acids, bases, and salts on typical emulsiods is well 
known. The desirable properties of the gluten should be most 
pronounced at its isoelectric point. Jessen-Hansen (33) was 
the first to point out the beneficial effect of acidity. He 
reports an increased loaf volume with the addition of acid if

the pH without acid is greater than 5.0. The work of 
Henderson ej al. (30) on the viscosity of doughs indicated 
that the isoelectric point of gluten might he in this region, 
in which case the foregoing results would have a theoretical 
hacking. Numerous investigators (4,31,57,61) have no?/ 
sh?/n that the isoelectric point of gluten approximates pH 
7.0 in vrhich case an increase in hydrogen-ion concentration 
could hardly result in an improvement of the physical proper¬ 
ties of the proteins. Grei?e and bailey (28) explain the 
beneficial effect of acidity by accelerated enzyme action 
during fermentation, and mention that the gluten sho?/s more 
desirable properties in a more alkaline medium. 

Wood and Hardy (65) found that neutral salts tended 
to counteract the dispersion of the gluten caused by acids. 
Upson and Calvin (64) confirmed this result using a more 
precise method. This led these ?/orkers to conclude that 
gluten owed its quality to the kind and amount of acids and 
salts present in the dough. 

Gortner and Doherty (25) applied the method of Upson and 
Galvin to gluten separated from flours of different strengths. 
They found that the weak glutens had a lower rate of imbibition, 
and were dispersed sooner and at lower water contents than the 
strong glutens. The ratio of the decrease of imbibition, on 
the addition of salt was found to be about the same in the case 
of both strong and weak flours. Uortner and noherty conclude

therefore that the glutens from a strong and weak flour are 
different, even at their isoelectric point, and although their 
imbibition may be influenced considerably by the composition 
of the medium, this is not the explanation of gluten quality, 

A study of the imbibitional properties of flour led to 
viscosity methods. Luers and Ostwald (39) studied the 
viscosity of flour pastes and dough solutions using an Ostwald 
viscometer. Simple twenty-percent suspensions of rye flours 
and the lower grades of wheat flour were found more viscous 
than those of the better grades of wheat flour. Suspensions 
acidulated with lactic acid, however, showed much greater differ¬ 
ences in the reverse order. 

Sharp and Oortner (57) made a thorough study of viscosity 
in flour-in-water suspensions. fhey found the Ostwald vis¬ 
cometer unsatisfactory due to a large fall-back of viscosity 
with time. This gave a differential effect in the case of 
flour suspensions that varied widely in their viscosity. A 
MacMichael torsional viscosimeter was therefore used. With 
acidulated suspensions they demonstrated the effect of different 
acids on viscosity, which varied somewhat in degree, but all gave 
a maximum in the region of pH 3.0. With alkalies the maximum 
viscosity occured in the region of pH 11.Q, Kemoval of the 
natural electrolytes before the addition of acid or alkali, 
increased the viscosity on the acid side and decreased it on 
the alkaline side. Addition of electrolytes to the acid

suspensions caused a rapid decrease in viscosity* In 
further studies the electrolytes were removed before add¬ 
ing the acid, by washing the flour with two portions of 
distilled water. This procedure was adopted owing to the 
increased viscosity, and the belief of the authors that the 
characteristic imbibition of the proteins was best indicated 
in the absence of the natural electrolytes, which vary in . 
their effect on imbibition in different flours. They found 
that the washing procedure followed for the removal of the 
electrolytes, likewise removed most of the gliadin, but since 
the viscosity greatly increased with successive extractions 
with distilled water, they conclude that gliadin has a low 
imbibitional capacity and is unimportant from the standpoint 
of strength. Lactic acid was chosen as the best acidulating 
agent, since it produced a maximum viscosity over a wide range 
of acid concentrations. 

Sharp and Fortner were unable to demonstrate a direct 
relation between viscosity and baking strength. They found, 
however, that if several viscosity measurements were made on the 
sane flour, using different concentrations, and the logarithms 
of the resulting viscosities were plotted as ordinates against 
the logarithms of the corresponding concentrations as abscissae, 
a straight line resulted. The slope, or tangent of this line 
was found to be related to gluten quality; the steeper slopes 
indicating high quality gluten. This led to a viscosity method 

(23) for testing gluten quality,using the slope of the aforementione

line as the quality factor. The equation of this line 

is: 

Log viscosity = a + b (log concentration) 
in which b is the quality factor, obtained from the graph or 
computed by the method of least squares. extensive investiga¬ 
tions (12,13,21,27,40,58) on the vis cosity of flour suspensions, 
by this method have, however, failed to demonstrate a relation 
between gluten quality and the factor t>. 

It load been found that though this quality factor remain¬ 
ed relatively constant for the same flour, the absolute viscosity 
varied from day to day. This led Johnson (34) to study the 
conditions under which the electrolytes were extracted. He 
found the method was affected by time, temperature, and degree 
of manipulation during extraction. 'the factor a in the fore¬ 
going equation was directly related to temperature, and a 
constant value for _b could be obtained only at constant temperature, 
which temperature must be below 40°0. He suggests that varia¬ 
tion in temperature of the distilled water in a laboratory at 
different times may account for the discrepancies found by other 
investigators. Later Johnson and Herrington (36) report maximum 
viscosity when extractions were carried out at an H-ion concentra¬ 
tion of approximately pH 5.0. Confirming the work of Sharp 
and uortner they found the highest viscosity occurred in a 
suspension from which fifty percent of the original protein had 
been decanted in the electrolyte extraction. They stress the

necessity for complete removal of the electrolytes for 
comparisons of flour by this method. 

I'he value of a one-concentration test of the absolute 
viscosity has received some attention. Morgan (46) 
considers this determination satisfactory for routine work 
in commercial practise. Blish and Sandstedt (12) found 

a low but significant correlation between absolute viscosity 
and loaf volume. A measurement of factor b on these flours 
showed no useful relation to loaf volume. Goleman et al 
(13) found the single-concentration test the only one giving 
a satisfactory correlation math loaf volume ; the four- 
point, factor b system being of negative value. Bor the one- 
concentration test the removal of the electrolytes has been 
found by some to be unnecessary (20,46,58); in fact Blish 
and Sandstedt report a higher correlation with loaf volume 
when the natural electrolytes are not washed out. 

various types of viscosimeters have been used by differ¬ 
ent workers in the study of flour suspensions. Since the 
work of Sharp and Fortner, however, the use of a torsional 
type has predominated. Smith (58) claims satisfactory 

results were obtained with a sheely pipette, a modification 
of the Ostwald type. Beniiam, Scott Blair, and Watts (17) 
present results to show that there is no justification for 
abandoning the Ostwald viscometer on the ground of viscosity 
ihis phenomenon they found to be a definite 


fall-back.

colloidal property, not due to repeated shearing or 
proteolysis, hut prohahly due to syneresis in the suspen¬ 
sion. Further, it was to some extent related to flour 
strength. In using the Ostwald viscometer they recommend 
that the viscosity he expressed in absolute units instead of 
time of flow. 

Denham al . (16) found that the equation of bharp and 
G-ortner did not give a straight line but a curve, which they 
attempt to explain from a colloidal chemical and hydrodynamical 
view point. They suggest tlje equation^ log viscosity = a + b( 
concentration^ as more nearly representing a straight line for 
most flours. As pointed out by van der Lee (38) this equation 
may be more satisfactory from an empirical standpoint, but the 
theoretical assumptions used to explain the curved relationship 
shown by the original equation are premature, in the light of 
our present knowledge and the type of determination on which 
the assumptions are based. 

The value of viscosity for the study of emulsoid colloids 
has been stressed by Ostwald (50) who states that apart from the 
three variables f concentration, temperature, and degree of 
dispersity, the following factors have been shown experimentally 
to affect the viscosity of these systems; solvate formation, 
electric charge or ionization, previous thermal treatment, 
previous mechanical treatment, inoculation with small amounts 
of more viscous colloids, time, and the addition of electrolytes

or non-electrolytes• When flour suspensions are used for 
studying the viscosity of colloids, most of these factors play 
a part, and must be subjected to quite definite control as 
emphasized by Johnson (34) fhe heterogeneity of a flour- 

in-water suspension, however, throws doubt on the value of 
viscosity measurements for determining the colloidal properties 
of the proteins, even if all the aforementioned variables 5-re 
controlled precisely. A suspension of flour-in-water is not 
only a colloidal solution of part of the proteins, but like¬ 
wise a true solution of the natural electrolytes, and far more 
than either of these it is a suspension of starch. The re¬ 

moval of the natural electrolytes, in order to standardize the 
determination, likewise removes most of the gliadin. conflict¬ 
ing evidence is presented by different workers regarding the 
merit of this procedure. fhe presence of the starch in the 
suspension still remains a disturbing factor, which must 
certainly exert a mechanical influence on the viscosity 
determination. Theoretically there is no reason to believe 
that viscosity would be a true measure of hydration capacity 
in the case of flour suspensions. 

Experimental evidence has been presented by Sharp (56) 
to show that flour suspensions conform more closely to the 
laws of plastic rather than viscous flow. He found that a 
certain simple flour-in-water suspension became plastic at a 

It is therefore probable that

all the acidulated suspensions of bharp and cortner were 
plastic systems, in which case a measurement of their 
viscosity in a torsional viscosimeter is open to criticism. 


From this review it is evident that,the chemical nature 
of the proteins in a strong and weak flour are not sufficient¬ 
ly different to he differentiated by our present technique, 
rhere is good reason to believe , and some experimental evidence 
to support the belief, that the strong and weak glutens differ 
in their imbibitional capacities. The failure of viscosity 
to demonstrate definitely this relation throughout, may be 
due to disturbing factors such as heterogenity and plasticity. 
Consequently a new method of measuring hydration, which is not 
affected by the conditions influencing viscosity, has been 
applied to the study of flour suspensions.

Method 

The "hound-water" method was first suggested by Newton 
and Gortner (47) for estimating the hydrophilic colloid 
content of expressed plant tissue fluids. Considerable 
research has since been done on the method by Martin (43, 

44,45) who used this determination in extensive studies 
of the colloidal properties of plant juices. A similar 
method has also been found satisfactory for the determination 
of adsorption by other workers (51). 

This method is based on the fact that a quantity of sucrose, 
sufficient to give a molar solution in the total water present 
in a colloidal system, exhibits an excess freezing point de¬ 
pression when compared with the theoretical value. The 
explanation of this phenomenon is that the colloidal particles 
hold a certain amount of water, as such, against the osmotic 
pressure of the sucrose. Bound-water, as used in this paper, 
can therefore be defined as the water present in a colloidal 
system which is not available for the solution of sucrose. 

The original workers tested gum acacia sols of from one 
to ten percent concentrations and found that a straight line 
relation existed between the logarithms of the bound water 
and the logarithms of the concentrations. In explanation 

of this data they suggest adsorption. It would seem, 
theoretically, that the bound water plotted against the cone-

centration directly, should give a straight line, assuming 
that in these low concentrations the colloidal particles 
do not compete for the water. Martin (43) tested seven 
different colloidal substances, and obtained this straight 
line relation with some substances. For others a curved 

relationship was found, due to a falling-off of the bound 
water at the higher concentrations* The competition of 
the colloidal particles may explain this, but it seems more 
probable that it is due to small traces of impurities, such 
as electrolytes, which were found later (45) to exhibit a 
profound influence on the hydration. 

Hewton and Gortner state that sucrose has the following 
advantages as a solute in this determination. (1) It is 
easily obtained in a high degree of purity, (2) the large 
molecular weight reduces errors in weighing, f3) its behaviour 
in solution is faMy well known, (4) its effect on the swell¬ 
ing of colloids is probably negligible. An obvious dis¬ 
advantage is the possibility of slight hydrolysis while being 
dissolved. Dextrose is another possible solute, but it 

was found to give much lower bound water values. Further 

investigations by Martin (43,45) showed the hydrolytic action 
of plant juices and lactic acid on sucrose, (lee. 85 percent 
lactic acid in 2Q0 cc. of distilled water?) is negligible in a 
one-hour period, provided that the solution is maintained at 
0?c. Sodium carbonate on the other hand was found to decrease

the freezing point of sucrose. Martin, studying the 
effect of different sucrose concentrations, found that for 
a given gum-arabic sol the average bound water as indicated 
by one-half molar was b.4b percent, for molar 9.62 percent 
and for one and one-half molar 6.27 percent. As a result 
of these studies Martin concluded that molar sucrose gave the 
most sensitive test. 

Begarding the behaviour of sucrose in solution, Seatchard 
(55) found the average hydration of sucrose in the region of 
molar concentration to be 6 mols. water to 1 mol. sucrose, the 
hydrated compound being referred to as sucrose hexahydrate. 

This gives a molar solution of sucrose a freezing-point de¬ 
pression of 2.085°G• instead of l.b60°0. Newton end Gortner 
found that even with the assumption of a hexahydrate the freez¬ 
ing point depression of sucrose in distilled water was in excess 
of this theoretical value. Martin’s figures indicate a 
similar behaviour for the c.p. sucrose used in his studies. 
Further, his work on different concentrations of sucrose showed 
that its excess freezing-point depression in distilled water 
varied with the concentration. His results show 1.036°C. 
for one-half molar, 2.120°G. for molar, and 3.441°C. for one 
and one-half molar, which give a curved and not a straight 
line relation. Seatchard points out that for concentrations 
lower than 20 g. in 100 cc. of water, the degree of hydration 
is doubtful from present measurements, but his graph, (p.2911.)

indicates that it is quite close to a hexahydrate, as 
shown by all methods except the freezing point determination* 

A study of the original freezing-point data of Jones and Getman, 
(37) together with the variability of different sucrose samples 
tested by Martin, suggests that this excess depression in 
distilled water is probably due to impurities rather than to 
the formation of a higher hydrate. The c.p. sucrose on hand 
exhibited this excess depression, so a sample was recrystalliped 
and the determination repeated. The freezing-point depress¬ 
ion was found to be unchanged, Electrical conductivity 
measurements indicated the absence of electrolytes so it was 
assumed that for this determination, the slight impurity would 
have little effect on the bound water, provided it was calculat¬ 
ed on the itreezing-point determined by experiment, rather than 
on the theoretical freezing-point, In order to remove the 
disturbing factor of variability in sucrose, 8 large quantity 
was obtained, ground to pass a 60-mesh sieve, and thoroughly 
mixed before determining the freezing point. This single 
sample of sucrose has been used in obtaining all the reported 
resul ts. 

The technique used by previous workers had to be consider¬ 
ably modified for use with flour suspensions. With plant 
juice the total solids were first determined by a refractometer, 
and then a portion was weighed out to contain exactly thirty 
grams of water. This procedure was impossible in the case

o±* flour suspensions. It was found, however, that for 
both half-molar and molar sucrose a straight line relation 
existed if the water present fell between 29 and 52 cc. 

This made it possible to correct the freezing-point de¬ 
pression for the amount of water present within this range. 

Thus a sample containing approximately 50 cc. of water could 
be used for the determination and the absolute amount of water 
present determined by oven-drying a similar portion. It 
was found that 54 cc. of a 15-percent suspension contained 
about 50 cc. of water. The measurement of this quantity 

was greatly facilitated by cutting a small graduated cylinder 
at the 34-cc. mark.. This could be quickly filled to over¬ 

flowing, with the freshly-agitated suspension, and transferred 
at once to a flask, a technique which overcame the slight 
errors in settling that would occur if the sample were taken 
by making up to a mark. Owing to mechanical difficulties 
it was found unsatisfactory to determine the freezing point 
with the starch and undissolved protein present. This 
solid material was removed by centrifuging. The following 
method was adopted tentatively. 

The desired flour suspension was prepared at 09 C. in a 
graduated cylinder, the volume being such as to contain approx¬ 
imately 100 cc. of water. The graduate was stoppered and 
shaken vigorously. Duplicate 54-cc. portions were taken as 
described, and transferred immediately to tared 100-cc. erlen-

meyer flasks, which were then stoppered and weighed* These 
flasks were then coded in an ice hath, and 10*2672 g. of suc¬ 
rose added to each, this giving a molar solution in 30 cc. of 
water. The flasks were then gently shaken for thirty 
minutes in an ice hath by an oscillating shaker to dissolve 
the sucrose, the material transferred to cooled tubes, and 

centrifuged for three minutes. The freezing point of the 

was 

supernatant liquid^now determined and recorded as A a. The 
tubes were stoppered tightly and stored in an ice hath while 
the determination was being made. 

At the same time as the above portions of flour suspension 
were taken from the graduate, triplicate samples of about 8 cc. 
were poured into tared dishes for the determination of dry 
matter. After weighing, the dishes were placed in an air 
oven at 90°0. until most of the water was evaporated, then 
dried for twelve hours under Vacuum at the same temperature, 
later it was found that this vacuum technique could be omitted 
without introducing significant errors. 

The small portion of flour suspension still remaining 
in the graduate was transferred to a tube, centrifuged, the 
freezing point determined, and the value recorded as A. 

For determining the freezing point, the ordinary Beck¬ 
man apparatus was used. Since an undercooling of 0*5° to 
0.7° C. was found to give the best readings for these solutions, 
the freezing-point depression was corrected for change in concen

Prom the percent dry matter, the amount of water in 
the weighed flasks was determined, and the sucrose concentra¬ 
tion calculated. Prom this value the freezing-point de¬ 
pression of the sucrose in the total water present, assuming 
all of it to be free, was calculated, and expressed as ^c. 

The symbols used and their relationships are as follows;- 

A * the initial freezing point of the suspension. 

the freezing point of the suspension after the 
addition of the sucrose. 

, the additional depression due to the added 
sucrose. 

Ac the calculated freezing-point depression of the 
sucrose in the total water present. 

Ax = A S -A C , the excess freezing-point depression due 
to bound water. 

The percent bound water is then calculated by the formula; 

Bound water I 89.2 Ac percent of the total water 
-21T- present. 

This formula assumes the formation of a hexaydrate of sucrose, 
hence the factor 89.2. 

Since the proposed investigation is a measurement of the 
hydration capacity, it becomes necessary to study the factors 
that effect imbibition. Probably a great many play a part, 
but viscosity studies have shown the following to be the most 
important in flour suspensions; temperature, hydrogen-ion 
concentration, time of hydration, presence of natural electro-

lytes, and concentration of flour* In addition to these 
the hound-water method is affected by at least one more, the 
concentration of the sucrose used in making the determination. 
Experiments were therefore planned for the study of these 
vari ables. 

The effect of temperature, however, cannot be satisfactor¬ 
ily studied by the proposed method since the determination 
itself must be carried out at the freezing point of the solution. 

It is difficult to determine the effect on hydration caused by 
cooling the suspension from a higher temperature to that of its 
freezing point, especially if the whole occurs within a comparative¬ 
ly short period. Consequently this variable was standardized 
by storing the suspensions, and carrying out all manipulations 
in connection with the method, at 0°C. An exception to this 
occurs in the removal of electrolytes which was carried on at 
2Q°C. t 0.5°C. due to the inefficiency of extraction at 0°C. 


Material 

3*our flours were selected for use in these studies. Three, 
"Marquis","Little Club", and "Kubanka" are 75 percent patents, 
milled in an experimental mill from the corresponding varieties 
grown at Edmonton in 1926. The "Commercial Patent” is a 

standard patent produced by a Canadian milling company for 
household use. All of these flours were allowed to age for

six months at room temperature before the investigation 
was started# The samples were then tested for moisture, 
ash, and protein by the usual methods* Glutenin was 

determined by the method proposed by Blish, Abbot and 
Platenius ft)* The baking data is the result of tripli¬ 
cate tests using 100 g. of flour on a 13*5 percent moisture 
basis, low pans, and- a "fixed” method* A small amount of 

taka-diastase was added to remove possible differences due 
to diastatic activity. 

The data obtained in these determinations are given in 
Table 1, together with the percent of total protein extract¬ 
ed in the removal of electrolytes at 2Q°C. by the method of 
Sharp and Gortner* This is the average of repeated 
determinations on the supernatant extract, carried out in 
connexion with subsequent studies* The analytical results 
show that three of the varieties are practically identical in 
protein and glutenin content, the Marquis variety being 
higher in these constituents. All except the Kubanka variety 
gave the same loaf volume; the loaves from the Little Club, 
however, were poorly piled, indicating that this is also a 
weak flour as compared with Marquis and Commercial Patent.

Prel i minary Kxperiment 

The first determinations of bound water were made on 
simple £Lour-in-?mter suspensions, using molar sucrose, and 
without controlling the pH. For the experiments with the 
electrolytes present, 15 g. of flour was made into a smooth 
paste with water at 0°Q. This was transferred to a graduate 
and made up to a -volume of 110 cc. aid allowed to stand in an 
ice bath for 30 minutes , with shaking at intervals, before 
making the determination. For removing the electrolytes in 
the second experiment, the method of Sharp and G-ortner was 
followed. A sample of 15 g. of flour was shaken up in a 
litre flask with a litre of distilled water at 20°G # This 
was shaken every 5 minutes for 45 minutes, allowed to stand 
15 minutes and then the water decanted off, 500 co. more 
water added, shaken once, allowed to stand 15 minutes and 
again decanted. The remaining flour residue was then trans¬ 
ferred to a graduate, made up to volume and treated as in the 
previous experiment. 

These data, obtained both in the presence and absence 
of Ihe natural electrolytes, are recor ded in Table 2. Ho 
conclusions can be drawn from the results since the magnitude 
of ihe bound-water values is so small as to be vitiated by 
the error of the determination, which is in the region of 0.5 
percent bound water. ' The consistently lower figures obtain¬ 
ed for bound water with the electrolytes removed is perhaps

and phosphate buffers were used in the region approaching 
neutrality. These reagents were added to the graduate when 
making up to volume, well shaken, and the whole allowed to 
digest for 30 minutes at 0°0. The results are given in 
Table 3. The amount of hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide 
is shown in the first column; in the case of the buffer solutions 
50 cc. of the described mixture was used. 

The figures obtained indicate an increased hydration in the 
region of pH. 3.0 and pH. 11.0, as found by Sharp and Oortner 
by viscosity measurements. The experiment was considered 
unsatisfactory, however, for ihe following reasons: first, 

it was found very difficult to get consistent readings in ihe 
alkaline medium, a fact mentioned by liar tin (45); second, the 
viscosity of the suspension in the region of maximum hydration 
made it extremely difficult to dissolve all the sucrose in 30 
minutes shaking. The first difficulty showed the necessity 

of using an acid solution for future studies. The problem 

of dissolving the sucrose was more difficult. To increase 
the time of shaking seemed undesirable, since this would in¬ 
crease the error due to hydrolysis of the sucrose. The use 

of a lower concentration of sucrose seemed the best expedient. 

Qoneentration of Sueros e 

A comparison of the bound water as indicated by half¬ 
molar and molar sucrose was undertaken, using identical acid¬ 
ulated suspensions, with a viscosity as high as the satisfactory

solution of the molar sucrose would permit. The preparation 
of these suspensions was the same as previously described, 
with the electrolytes removed, except that the digestion 
period was varied, and 2 cc» of five percent lactic acid was 
used as the acidifying agent. The data obtained are given 
in Table 4. They show that ha If-molar sucrose gives bound- 
water values comparable to those obtained with the molar concen¬ 
tration. Further work showed that a pH. of 2.9 gave the great¬ 
est viscosity, yet no difficulty was encountered in dissolving 
half-molar sucrose in these suspensions in 30 minutes.

For the calculation of bound water with half-molar 
sucrose the formula was modified to:- 

Bonnd water = 94,6 Ax 

^s 

This formula assumes that a sucrose hexahydrate is formed. 

In the foregoing experiments it was noted that the tempera¬ 
ture readings appeared to be more sensitive and accurate with 
the half-molar sucrose. To substantiate these observations 
and obtain some critical data on the determination ,the freezing- 
point depressions of 49 samples of ha If-molar and molar sucrose 
were determined in distilled water. The figures were treated 
statistically and the results are presented in Table 5. The 
coefficient of variability was appreciably less with the half- 
molar sucrose, a decided advantage in favor of this concentra¬ 
tion. The probable error of a single determination with 
half-molar sucrose is 0.005°G, which corresponds closely to 0.4 
percent of bound water. In 3a.ter work the replication of the 
temperature readings would reduce this value considerably, but 
in the consi deration of experimental results no significance 
has been attached to differences less than this amount. 

Since the suspensions exhibited their greatest viscosity 
in the region of pH 2.9, maximum hydration can be expected at 
this point. lactic acid acts as its own buffer in this region, 
so it was chosen as the best acid for use in further work. It 
was added to the graduate when making the suspensions up to volume; 
10 cc. of a 5 [percent solution giving the desired pH when added 
to 100 cc. of the flour water suspensions. Allowing for the

Hydrolysis o f Sucro -se 

To complete a study of the method, ‘the hydrolytic action 
of lactic acid, under the conditions of the experiment, was 
investigated. In order to do this it was necessary to get 

an extract of Hie flour, since the starch and undissolved protein 
might be disturbing factors. To make this extract similar 

to that of an actual determination it was prepared in a similar 
way. Samples of the Commercial Patent were suspended in 

water acidulated with 3actic acid as described, without removing 
the electrolytes. These were allowed to digest for one hour 
at 0°C•, and then shaken for 30 minutes at the same temperature, 
centrifuged, and the liquid phase decanted off. Samples of

the latter were then taken for bound water and dry matter 
in the usual way. When the sucrose had dissolved, a test 
of the freezing point was made, and recorded as the initial 
depression. The samples were then returned to an ice bath 
and tested in one hour, two hours and thirty minutes, and 
five hours and thirty minutes. The freezing-point de¬ 
pression of the liquid with out added sucrose, kept under the 
same conditions as the above,was determined at the same time 
intervals. The excess f reezing-point depression Am, to¬ 

gether with its value in terms of bound water, is given in 
Table 6. The increase in the freezing point due to hy¬ 

drolysis has been expressed as an apparent increase in bound 
water, rather than as the percent hydrolysis, since the fomer 
gives a better idea of Ihe error. The results show no hy¬ 
drolysis in one hour, while at two hours and a half the change 
in two of the samples is still within the error of Ihe method. 
At five hours and thirty minutes the hydrolysis is appreciable. 
Since one hour allows ample time for making the deter mine U on 
there is little danger of error from this source. Samples 

preserved longer than this period were discarded. The fore¬ 

going experiments establish the suitability of the method.

T ime o f II yd ration 

The effect of time on the hydration of acidulated 
auspensions, in the presence of electrolytes, was the next 
factor studied. In this experiment the 15-gram flour 

samples were made into a smooth paste wi 1h dis 11 lied water, 
made up to volume and acidulated in graduates at 0°0. They 
were then allowed to remain in an ice bath for varying periods 
of lime before making the determination. The results are 
presented in Table 7. 

The first column gives the length of storage period, 
taken from the time of addition of lactic acid to the time of 
actually making the determination. The technique of the 
method makes it impossible to get a reading in less than forty 
minutes. Detenninations at the 1-J—hour periods were made 
in quadruplicate, and all olhers in duplicate. The average 
bound water from these replicates is given in the second column. 
It was found that with suspensions of varying viscosity, the 
34-cc. graduate delivered slightly different amounts of suspen¬ 
sion on transferring the latter to erlenmeyers, possibly be¬ 
cause the neaessary shaking trapped varying quantities of air 
bubbles. This resulted In varying amounts of both water and 
dry natter being present in different determinations. Further, 
since the bound water is given in percent, the absolute quantity 
varied with the water present. It was considered advisable 
therefore, to convert the values to an absolute basis and ex¬ 
press the bound water for each determination as a percent of

the dry matter in that particular case. These values 
as given in the third column, represent the average hy¬ 
dration of all the dry natter present. Subsequent 

studies on extracted starch (cf. Table 10) showed that 
the hydration of this substance was about thirty percent. 
Assuming this hydration for the starch present in a given 
determination, the remaining bound water was calculated as 
a percent of the proteins, and is given in the last column. 

The results show that the average hydration of the proteins, 
as measured in this way, is in the region of one hundred per¬ 
cent. It is probable that the hydration of the starch in 

ordinary flour suspensions is less than thirty percent, since 
the extracted starch, freed from lipoid substances by the 
final alcohol and ether treatments, would probably exhibit 
increased hydration. This idea is borne out by comparisons 
of Table 2 and Table 7 which show that acidulatL on stimulated 
hydration to the extent of about three percent of bound water, 
which increase must be chiefly attributed to the proteins. 

If this is true the protein hydration is far in excess of the 
values recorded in Table 7. The figures have been present¬ 

ed merely as a matter of interest, and are not used as a basis 
of comparison.

An examination of the figures for average hydration of 
the dry matter shows no consistent difference between the 
strong and weak flours; the strong Gommerdial Patent and 
the weak Kubanka sample showing a lower hydration capacity 
than the other two. In the case of the strong flours, 

there are indications of increased imbibition up to a certain 
point, after which it falls off, but the differences are too 
small to establish this point. The hydration, which is 

relatively constant throughout, shows no fall comparable in 
magnitude with the fail-back of viscosity with time. It 
must be mentioned in this regard that the viscosity fall-back 
starts almost immediately after the addition of the acid. 

By this method a determination can not be made in less than 
forty minutes after acidulation, and this may explain the 
difference in the results obtained. 

A similar study was repeated on corresponding samples 
of flour, after washing out the electrolytes by the method 
previously given. The data are presented in Table 8. The 

calculations for hie hydration of the proteins were no?/ made 
on the basis of the protein present after removing the electro¬ 
lytes (of. Table 1). Comparing the hydration of the total 
dry matter, the two strong flours show an increased hydration 
over the weaker types. Considering the error of Hie method, 
however, the differences, while fairly definite, are not great 
enough to be a good index to gluten quality. Regarding the 
effect of time, it can be seen that there is a definite fall

in hydration with increasing lengths of storage period 
for all the flours except the Little Club; the rate of 
fall, however, was greater with strong flours. 

Effect of Electrolytes 

A comparison of the last two tables shows the effect of 
the natural electrolytes on hydration. Increased imbibition 
is shown in all cases when the electrolytes are removed, but 
this only reaches a significant magnitude in the Commercial 
Patent and Kubanka flours, which samples showed a lower hy¬ 
dration than the other two in the presence of their natural 
electrolytes. This result exhibits the potent effect of 

different kinds and amounts of these salts. Comparing the 
calculated hydration of die proteins present in each case, a 
decidedly greater imbibitional capacity is shown in the 
absence of electrolytes. Regarding the fall of hydration 
with time, it would seem that though the electrolytes depress 
the original hydration, eilher they or the gliadin which is 
also removed, stabilise the suspension to some extent against 
this fall with time. This stability may be important in 
the fermentation behaviour of a flour.

Concent rat ion of fflour 

When the concentration studies ?/ere undertaken it was 
found that the method was not adaptable to the study of a wide 
range of concentrations. If over 25 g. of flour were used in 
the usual 100 cc. of water, the suspensions became so viscous 
on the addition of acid that it was difficult to dissolve all 
the sucrose in the time limit. At concentrations as low as 5 
g. the magnitude of the excess depression due to bound water 
was so small as to be seriously affected by the experimental 
error. However, determinations were carried out on five, ten, 
fifteen, twenty, and twenty-five gram concentrations. In this 
experiment the electrolytes were not washed out, and the suspen¬ 
sions were allowed to digest for one hour at 0°C. before making 
the determination. The data are given in Table 9, in the same 
form as in the two previous tables; the first column showing the 
percent dry matter in the suspensions as determined by oven drying. 
The apparent large differences in hydration of the strong and weak 
flours in the five-gram concentrations may be due to the error 
previously mentioned. Otherwise the results confirm those of 
Table 7, and support the conclusion that there is no significant 
difference in thehydr&tion of strong and weak flours in the pres¬ 
ence of their natural electrolytes. A slight fall in hydration 
with increasing- concentration occurs in all but the Marquis flour. 
This fall is probably due to the increased electrolyte concentra¬ 
tion rather than to a competition of the proteins for water. In 
general all the flours give the same type of curve with no sig¬ 
nificant difference either in slope or character. On the basis 
of these results, there seemed no good reason for changing from 
the 15 percent flour concentration originally adopted.

lixpe riments on jPI our fractions. 


To elucidate further the seat of hydration in the 
case of flour suspensions, experiments on some flour fractions 
were undertaken. A sample of starch, gliadin, and glutenin 
was obtained from the Marquis flour in the following way:- 

Jfive kilos of flour were doughed up and allowed to stand 
in an ice bath for one hour. The starch was then removed 

by kneading the dough under a stream of tap water. The 
gluten so obtained was ground in a meat chopper and extracted 
with 70 percent alcohol until no cloudiness was produced on 
pouring the extract into several volumes of 95 percent alcohol. 
The remaining gluten containing the glutenin was dispersed in 
0.2 percent sodium hydroxide, at 0°0. to prevent racemization. 
The purification of these fractions was carried out in the 
following way. 

Starch . The material of different specific gravity was 
first removed from the starch by differential centrifuging. 

The crude starch was then washed twice with one percent sodium 
chloride to remove traces of globulin, and then washed free 
from chlorides with distilled water. The centrifuge was 

used to throw down the starch after each washing. The 

purified product was finally dried wiih absolute alcohol and 
anhydrous ether. 

Gliadin . The alcoholic extracts were concentrated under 
reduced pressure,at a temperature below 40°G. The protein 
was then precipitated by pouring the concentrated solution into

several volumes of one-percent sodium chloride, the precipi¬ 
tate redissoived in alcohol, concentrated, and the process 
repeated, this time pouring the residue into di stilled water. 
The third and final precipitation was carried out by pouring 
the alcoholic solution into a mixture of absolute alcohol and 
anhydrous ether. The product was then dehydrated with 

anhydrous ether and ground to pass a hundred-mesh sieve. 

The resulting pale-yellow powder was completely soluble in 
70 percent alcohol at room temperature. 

Glutenin * The alkaline solution containing the glutenin 
was centrifuged to remove the undissolved material, and the 
protein precipitated from the liquid by the addition of normal 
hydrochloric acid to about pH 6.2 as indicated by brom-thymol 
blue. The material ms then re dissolved and the process 

repeated. The glutenin was then washed with 70 percent 

alcohol to remove traces of gliadin. This was repeated 

using 90 percent alcohol and finally dehydrated* When 

ground to piss a hundred-mesh sieve, a grayish white powder 
resulted which was slowly but completely soluble in dilute 
alkalies at room temperature.

Hydra ti on capacity of fractions . The hydrati on 
capacity of these fractions were tested in dilute lactic 
acid as -used for the flour suspensions. The complete 
data are given in Table 10. The viscosity was measured 
in an Ostwald viscometer, having a water time of 12.2 sec¬ 
onds, and reported as time in seconds, instead of absolute 
units, since there was not sufficient material to make a 
specific gravity determination. The gliadin was test¬ 
ed at the various concentrations given in the table; in 
all cases it dissolved completely in the presence of the 
lactic acid. The determinations were made on this pro¬ 
tein as soon as it was dissolved. The glutenin was 

prepared in similar concentrations, but was largely in¬ 
soluble in the lactic acid, though considerable swelling 
took place. These samples were given similar mechanical 
and thermal treatment, by shaking for five hours in an ice 
bath before making the determinations. The highest con¬ 
centration of glutenin had to be abandoned as it was too 
thick and unmanageable for satisfactory study. Similarly 

the next two concentrations clogged the viscometer to some 
extent and the readings were unreliable. The starch was 

treated similarly to the flour and allowed to stand for one 
hour in an ice bath. This procedure was followed in 

order that the results might be comparable with the flour 
suspensions.

The hydration as given in the above table for the 
extracted proteins, is in no way expected to represent 
their normal imbibition in the flour. The study was 
undertaken merely to elucidate their relative behaviour 
in lactic acid solution. The figures obtained show 
that there is little difference in the hydration capacity 
of these two proteins. This is remarkable when one is 
completely soluble and the other relatively insoluble. 

Judging from the above data, gliadin must also take part 
in the hydration capacity exhibited by flour. When 
their solubilities are considered, however, it would seem 
that the insoluble glutenin has in its make-up the proper¬ 
ties desirable in the gluten, and may therefore be the most 
important protein from a quality standpoint. The incident¬ 
al removal of the gliadin, in the complete washing out of the 
electrolytes would therefore seem to be justified. 

The studies on starch hydration were extended to a starch 
extracted from another flour by a method similar to that used 
for the Marquis sample. Both starches show a hydration of^about 
thirty percent by this methods The figures suggest that this 
hydration may be relatively constant for starches obtained 
from different flours. As previously mentioned, (cf, p. 38) 
this value is probably in excess of that exhibited by starch 
a flour suspension. It is worth noting, however, that starch 
exhibits this property, either by adsorption or absorption,

though its effect on the hydration of a flour may he 
insignif ic ant • 

The correlation shown between bound water and vis¬ 
cosity off ere further evidence supporting the bound-water 
method as a measure of hydration. Since the gliadin 

exhibited the properties of an emulsoid in this case, 
viscosily nay be regarded as a reliable measure of hydra¬ 
tion. The agreement is evident in all but the lowest 
cone entration, in which case the bound water is probably 
in error. The glutenin, being insoluble, does not 

warrant comparisons of this nature.

The disturbing factors of heterogenity and plasticity 
which affect viscosity as a measure of hydration in flour 
suspensions, do not affect the bound-water method. On 

the other hand the latter determination is more limited 
in application, and is less sensitive to slight changes in 
hydration. In most cases the results of viscosity 
determinations have been confirmed by this method. An 
exception occurs in the effect of time, but the methods 
are not strictly comparable in this respect. 

The gluten proteins are profoundly affected by electro¬ 
lytes. Varying amounts or kinds of these make measure¬ 
ments of hydration in their presence uncertain. But

extraction of these by solution in water also removes 
the gliadin, which has a hydration capacity comparable 
Ytfith the glutenin in the extracted form. The more rapid 
fall of hydration with time when the electrolytes are re¬ 
moved, suggests that gliadin may have some effect on maintain¬ 
ing the imbibitional properties of the suspension . The 
removal of the electrolytes in the usual manner before making 
a determination of the hydration capacity of a flour suspen¬ 
sion is justifiable only on the assumption that this protein 
is not important from the standpoint of strength. G-liadin 
exhibits a definite hydration capacity, however, and its 
possible stabilizing influence on the hydration of the gluten, 
as just suggested, may be of importance in bread dough. 

The results of these studies and that of other workers 
on viscosity, show that to a slight extent strong flours, 
free from natural electrolytes, and acidified to pH 3.0, 
show greater hydration than weak flours under the same con¬ 
ditions. The solubility of gliadin in water, and the 

potent effect of natural electrolytes, suggest that hydration 
capacity as measured in these flour suspensions is useless 
as an indication of gluten quality. Plasticity studies 
on more concentrated mixtures might prove valuable.

1. The bound-water method has been developed and 
applied to the measurement of hydration in flour suspen¬ 
sions. 

2. The hydration capacity of simple flour-in-water 
suspensions showed no significant differences. 

3. The strong flours showed a slightly greater hy¬ 

dration capacity than the weak flours after removing the 
natural electrolytes and adding lactic acid. These 

differences were too small to be used as an index to gluten 
quality. 

4. In general, time causes a greater fall in hydration 
capacity in acidulated suspensions from which the electro¬ 
lytes have been removed, than when the electrolytes are 
present. This may be due to the removal of part of the 
glia din in the process of washing out the electrolytes. 

5. Acidulated flour suspensions containing the natural 
electrolytes show slightly decreased hydration with increas¬ 
ing concentration. 

6. Glia din and glutenin extracted from one of the flours 
show similar hydration capacities in dilute acid. These 
are of the order of 70 to 90 percent.

7. The hydration of extracted starch is about 30 

percent of its weight, but there is evidence that this is 
in excess of that exhibited by starch in a flour-in-water 
suspension.

In conclusion the writer wishes to express his 
appreciation to Dr. -H. Hewton, Professor of Field Grops 
and Plant Biochemistry, for suggesting the problem, and 
for the helpful criticisms and advice, v/hich have been of 
material assistance, as well as a constant inspiration.
