PAET I 


The Historicity of Jesus . 


At the very outset we are confronted with this 
pertinent question, Did Jesus Christ ever really exist? 
Was there ever such a person? 

The usual answer to this question is that Jesus did 
have a real existence among men; this is an historic fact 
commonly accepted by believers and unbelievers alike* 
There was a time when infidels and sceptics denied this, 
but now it is ai&oet universally admitted that Jesus had 
a real existence. Ho man of knowledge and understanding 
| now questions the fact. Jesus lived and died. 

It may be advisable at this point to notice some of 
the theories that have been propounded with regard to the 
Mature and Person of Christ. These are so numerous that 
neither our time nor the scopt of this thesis will allow 
me to deal with each one separately. These theories are 
generally divided into two groups: I. Those that centre 
around His public appearances and work and II. Those 
that gather around the documents of the Christian Faith 
in which our Lord is credited with the attributes of 
Divinity. Among the first we have the following; 

I. (a) That He was a prophet - the first and greatest of 

the prophets| 

\ b) That He was a Jewish Fanatic, inspired by an 

intense study of the ancient documents and legends 
of Judaism; 

( c.) That He was a Cod-filled man, in whom the Divine 
dwelt as in none other; 

(d) That He was the Central Personage of our race - 
the ideal man. 

Under the second group we have the following: 

II. (a) That the Christ of the Gospels is the result of 

legendary accretions that have gathered around the 
name of Jesus, as in the case of Buddha, Osiris, 
Bacchus, and Krishna, 



Chat it is the applying to Jesus the symbol or 
expression of a national Messianic Myth; 











2 


(o) That it 1 b the result of the conflict among 
various parties in the Christian Church; 

(&) Kenan goes ©o far as to ©ay that the world*e 
faith in the lord's resurrection is nothing 
more than the creation of ...ary*8 love-rick 
heart that dreamt her ..aster hack to life again* 


In these two groups of theories we have the general 
argument© which have been used by sceptics to discredit 
belief in the existence of Jesus of ;!as$areth. Having 
failed to prove that He was merely a prophet, a men, a 
Cod-filled man, they swung over to the opposite extrem¬ 
ity and endeavoured to prove that Jesus was simply the 
product of fancy, or the mythical production of fanatic¬ 
al, or honest but overwrought and enthusiastic follow¬ 
ers* But Dr* W. B. Dope rays in his Compendium of 
Christian Theology ’’The four Co ©pels and the Acte and 
the Epistles are not composed of the stuff that myths 
are made of* They are, or profess to be, clear his¬ 
tory, and doctrine based on history, with reason of 
the severest kind binding the whole together* begen.de 
end myth© ere after all impalpable things, Christ and 
Christianity are hard realities.” Theodore Darker 
says, "Shall we be told such a man never lived - the 
whole story is a lie? Suppose that flats and newton 
never lived. But who did their wonders and thought 
their thoughts? It takes a Lawton to forge a Hewton. 
What man could have fabricated a Jesus? Hone but a 
Jesus*” 

DVct - e sf Uartensen in his Christian Dogmatics, ©ays, 
’’Christ, it Is true, is not present in the Scriptures 
alone; it is true, the image of Christ lives in a man¬ 
ner relatively independent of Scripture, in the heart 
of the Church, and in the heart of each individual 
believer; but the inward Christ of the heart presupposes 
the '■'hr let manifested in history, and without the latter 
soon fades into a mystic cloud!.... *” The Evangelist© 
have attempted to record accurately their impression$of 
the lord. In their experience He was a living, per¬ 
sonal, vital reality, and their desire was to portray 
Him in all His gentleness and tenderness to all nations* 

The actual human life of Jesus has not only been 
questioned by sceptics, but even devout religious 

people have had doubts concerning His humanity. They 
have been tempted to look upon Him as e being* far 
superior to mortals, one who was incapable of committ¬ 
ing ©ip, and who was proSt f mlnet the temptation of

the flesh. But the Apostle explodes this theory 
when he declares that Jesus as our High Priest, was 
not free from th© feelings of our infirmities, hut 
was/in all points tempted lilce as we are, yet without 
sin, " The Gospel writers emphasis© the fact that 
He was a truly human person, capable of all the feel¬ 
ings of Hie fellowmen, He hungered, thirsted, had His 
seasons of joy and of sorrow, and Hie humanity is por¬ 
trayed most vividly in the writings of the Synoptic 
Gospels, He lived among the Jews, and scarcely went 
away from the Jewish people. Yet His sympathies were 
far wider than the narrow Jewish Interests; He was 
vitally interested in the life of other peoples; this 
is shown by the vary fact that He could converse with 
a Samaritan woman, who was really an outcast from 
society ,^ 2 * Even among His own people, the Jews, Hi® 
interest in th© downtrodden was so great that He mote 
frequently mingled with the outcasts and sinners, than 
with the Keltgioue dead era of the day, because His 
mission was to save the outcasts and those whom the 
religious of Hie day despised* 

His teaching was of a High ethical order. H© has 
called us to an ideal which he# never been lived. The 
writings of th© Apostles show us how He lived the ideal 
life and His challenge to all who profess to be His 
disciples is to strive after this ideal, and to fulfil 
the highest commands we must love God with all our heart, 
soul, mind and strength and our neighbour as ourselves, 

Thomas Hill Green of Oxford, the prototype of 
uangham In Mrs* Humphrey ffar&'e "Robert Elsmere", would 
do away with th© historlea. 1altogether* Jesus, 
according to Green, is a beautiful ideal, the creation 
partly of St* Paul, but still -more of on© even greater, 
the writer whom the Church calls St. John, . So long 
as we have the Ideal it does not matter very much how 
this Ideal came into existence; there is, however, no 
longer any need to endeavour to discover these secret 
sources for the genuineness of Jesus; it is sufficient 
that the idea is here, and it is impure faith which 
concerns itself about hit toric evidence. Therefore, 
it does not matter whether m believe in the authenticity 
of the Scriptures or not, this ideal has given peace to 
our souls end has filled our hearts with love towards 
God and our fellowmen* 

But Green’s theory is open to much Question* The

.Apostles built their teaching upon an historic basis. 

We have to r ©member that only a short period inter¬ 
vened between the tine of our bcrd*s Ministry and the 
first written Christian Locuments. The men who had 
known the bord while He was teaching upon the earth, woulc 
carefully cherish Hie words after His death. While His 
teaching was handed down verbally to their descendants, 
it probably did receive additional Glosses, but it is 
hardly reasonable to Imagine that by the time Paul * s 
Epistles were written - within thirty years of Jesus* 
death - that people would have entirely forgotten the 
Gord; and at this early date it would be impossible to 
preach to the people the teachings of a men who was 
supposed to have lived in their midst, and of whom they 
■ad never heard* 

To Paul Jesus was a real personage, and his teach¬ 
ing was based upon the death and resurrection of Jesus.i 
He emphatically declares that Jesus appeared to him 
after Hie resurrection from the dead. c Hence Paul’s 
teaching was based upon historic facts, and if these 
facts had been tint rue, the people of hie own day would 
not have allowed them to go unchallenged. 

St. John in hie Gospel gives us a picture of the 
* Logos* mad© flesh, and dwelling among men. He empha¬ 
sises the idea that the Incarnation was an actual and 
historic fact. Thus the faith of these two great- 
pillars of the early Christian Church rested on the 
historical work of Christ. 

Green resolves Religion into a Metaphysical Idea”, 
the worship, through love and knowledge, of God ae a 
Spiritual Being immanent in the moral life of man. But 
Coleridge says "a true Religion must consist of ideas 
and facts both, not of ideas alone without facte, for 
then it would be mere Philosophy; nor of facts alone 
without ideas of which these facts are the symbol©, or 
out of which they arise, or upon which they are grounded, 
for then it would be mere History.” 

For Green, Religion is a fantastic shadow, it ladies 
the life, the spirit and the inspiring ideals of the 
teachings of Jesus and the Apostles; it fails to grip 
the hearts of people, because of its failure to satisfy 
the highest cravings of the human soul.*"

There lea par©age in the Autobiography of Mark 
Rutherford, where the hero in discussion with an 
agnostic friend tries to maintain that it really did 
not matter whether Jeeue actually existed or not, 
that what the four Evangellets recorded was eternally 
true, and that Christ idee was true, whether it was 
ever incarnated or not in a being hearing His name* 

"lardon me," said Pardon, "but it does very much mat¬ 
ter* It is ell the matter whether we ere dealing with 
a dream or with a reality* I can dream about a men’s 
dying on the cross in homage to what he believed, but 
I would not perhaps die there myself; and when I suffer 
from hesitation whether I ought to sacrifice myself for 
the truth. It is of immense assistance to me to know 
that a greater sacrifice is possible* To know that 
somebody has poetically Imagined that it ie possible, 
and ha,a very likely been, altogether incapable of its 
achievement is no help* Hence it ie most advantageous 
even for morale, to have the life which is recognised 
bb the Ideal actually lived in a person. 

Ur. John li. Robertson of London, returns to the 
demonstration that Jeeus ie a myth. In Me first voShrae 
he attempt© to survey the 'position© of the various 
writers who believe Jesus to be an historical figure, 
and endeavours to prove that they are bopeleeely wrong 
in their positive assumption© and in their objections" 
to the Myth Theory. lie second volume is a presenta¬ 
tion of his notion of how Christianity, with no Jeeus 
and nothing corresponding to the Goepel story, got 
started in the world. The theory advocated by Mr* Rob¬ 
ertson as to how the second century Church and it© Gos¬ 
pels came into being Is a thousand times more incredible 
than the simple postulate that Christianity, like.Moham¬ 
medanism, had a founder, whose mission has left a writ¬ 
ten deposit in the Gospels. The author "infers" every¬ 
thing and demonstrates nothing. He says "there was at 
Jerusalem, at some time in the first century, a small 
group of Jesuiet "Apostle©" among whom the chief may hav 
been named James, John and' Cephas. They my have been 
members of a ritual group of twelve, who may have styled 
themselves ’Brothers of the Lord’; but that group in no 
way answered to tb© Twelve of the Gospels. The adher¬ 
ent© believed in a non-Meta rio Jesus, the ’Servant’ of 
the Jewish God, somehow evolved out of the remote Jeeue- 
God who is reduced to human statue in the Old Testament 
&b Joshua. Their central secret rite consisted in a

symbolic sacrament of human sacrifice. This rite 
had, within living memory, if not still at the time 
from which we start, been accompanied by an annual 
popular rite, in which a selected person - probably a 
criminal released for the purpose - was treated as a 
temporary ling, then derided, and then either in mock 
show or in actual fact, executed,under the name of 
Jesus Barrabae, "the Son of the Father.” Of this 
ancient cult there were inferriblymany scattered centres 
outside of Judea.” 1 He endeavours to show that the 
Synoptics grew up from © mystery Hay, staged in a Gen¬ 
tile city. 3?he transcription of this drama furnished 
the nucleus of the Gospels, to which was added by accre¬ 
tion material from the LidecAe and other sources, along 
with much symbolic and legendary story. He refers to 
Paul but declares that the extant ”Pauline Epistles 
were not written by him; -he declares them to be a. 
second century production.” I* he Acte are according 
to this author’s views fictitious, a mixture of tradi¬ 
tion and fiction. He overcomes the difficulty of the 
parallel elements in the narratives of Peter and of 
Paul, by implying that, one or more may have written 
the narratives, end later hands may have systematically 
interpolated the other. 

Mr. Kobertson in his Mystery Play, "which may or 
may not have been definitely Jewish at the outset,” 
but which took its final form from the task of Gentile 
hands; makes the Apostles in general play a poor part: 
one plays the role of betrayer and the legendary Judaic- 
ing Apostle is made to deny his master• Judas is pic¬ 
tured as carrying © bag to receive his reward. In the 
development of another God in the Mystery flay alongside 
Jahveh, the author tries to prove that Judaism web not 
the unified monotheism which we have been taught to 
believe. Further, the reason why the existence of 
Jesus is not mentioned in the Hebrew Books, is because 
the Bacred Books would naturally exclude all mention of 
a cult which in effect meant the continued deification 
of Joshua, who wasinferribly a primitive God. home of 
the rites of the cult were well known* though the Mys¬ 
tery Play was performed always In secret, and is never 
anywhere mentioned, so that Mr* Robert bob has to infer 
everything. 

Professor Bowen criticising this theory says that 
Mr. Boberteon*s two books ’’constitute an astounding 
act of faith; for the mind that can honestly believe

artist’e absence had left a canvas daubed over with -

There have* however* been two famous answers given 
to the question concerning the existence of Jesus: 

*T. Schmiedel in his "Jesus and Modern Criticism”, lays 
HK>wn nine foundation, pillars* and attempts to show 
that these nine passages would not occitr in a book per¬ 
meated with the spirit of worship for the hero. If that 
hero had not actually lived.

tudes was not an historic occurrence, but the bread 
with which one man in the wilderness was able to feed 
a vast multitude signifies the teaching with which he 
satisfied their souls,

the last clause counteracting the preceding enumera¬ 
tion and proving that Jesus was speaking not of the 
physically but of the spiritually blind, lame,1©prims, 
deaf and dead. 


These fragments Professor Sehmiedel pronounces 
I ’absolutely credible.* This is all that is left - this 
j shattered remnant of that precious heritage, the Evangel¬ 
ic Tradition; and yet the foundation of the Church’s 
faith and hope is based on the Lord Jesus Christ, and 
the Church Fathers in the Creed of Constantinople, put 
into doctrinal form their Keligious Beliefs in His Person#-, 
ality and Divinity. Professor Sehmiedel intends that 
these fragments, which do not breathe the spirit of wor¬ 
ship for the hero, which permeates the other parte of 
the Synoptic Gospels, implies that the character of Jesusf 
is not an-invention or these passages would have been 
left out; for these passages give traits of character 
which could not consistently be associated with an invent¬ 
ed Deit;y. 1 


IT. Case recognised Sehmiedel’s position but was not 
content to let the matter rest there; he calls in 
extra Biblical witnesses, Philo, Josephus, Tacitus 
and Pliny. 

1. Josephus was & Jew who lived from about 57Q100 A.B. 
From 75 on he lived in Home. He was a member of the 
Priestly Party in Palestine, and when Jerusalem fell 
in 70 A.D., he went with Titus to Home, half cap¬ 
tive and half an honoured spy. He makes two refer¬ 
ences to Jesus in his Antiquities. 

(a) At this time lived Jesus, a wise man, if indeed it

ie proper to call him a rnan. For he was a doer 
of wonderful works, a teacher of men who receive 
the troth gladly, and he won to himself both many 
Jews end many Greeks, This was the Christ and 
when Hate, on the indictment of the chief men 
amono' us, sentenced him to crucifixion, those who 
loved Him at first did not cease loving Him; for 
He appeared to them alive again the third day, as 
indeed, the fivine prophets'had foretold these 
and ten thousand other wonders concerning Him* And 
/ . €ven t 0 this day the race of Christian® named from 
jUwt'ls not Mtiaaot.* This reference to Jesus' death 
a no. resurrection is believed to have been written 
by a person favourable to Christianity and is 
regarded as a Christian interpolation* The writ¬ 
ings of Josephus were preserved by Christians and 
not^by the Jews. The genuineness of this passage 
is doubted beooueo it claims uni quo powers for 
- and because of the difficulty' of a Jew aesert- 

f : hat Je6UE wae the Messiah* Historians among the 
& vewB had little to say concerning the kessianic 
Hope, because it had occasioned the Homans go much 
trouble, and the genuine historian was desirous of 
keeping the peace for the sake of the punishment 
his people would receive if he should give the pre¬ 
tence for a popular rising* 

Josephus in another plop© seemed to identify 
the ^oaeiah with Vespasian* *' (bj "James the 
brother of the so-called Christ."- This passage 
is possibly authentic* Josephus wrote to apologise 
to the Romans for the Jewish people; to make his 
own people letter and more favourably known to t&e 
Homans. 

-r* J. M. Robertson finds that the "silence of 
Josephus" concerning Jesus ana the Christians 5T is 
an insurmountable negation of the Gospel story*" 

But another reason has been advanced for the 
silence of Josephus, - that he me sympathetic to 
the Christian religion, and did not wish to embroil 
the Christiana* But this contention is not tenable, 
he shows S&dduee&n tendencies and sidestepped all 
Christian principles. Others contend that he was

©imply indifferent to Christianity, while others advo¬ 
cate that he was hostile to it, 

II. Tacitus, in hie ©tory of the burning of home, 
explicitly state© that the Christians of Hero*© 
day traced their origin to on© named Christ, who 
was put to death by Pontine Pilate, in Judea, 
during the reign of Tiberius. 1 

III. Pliny also mention© the Christian© . The Christ¬ 
ians "asserted that the amount of their fault or 
error was this: that they were accustomed to assem¬ 
ble on a fixed day before daylight, and sing* by 
turns (i.e., antlphonally) a hymn to Christ b.b God," s 
But thee© words shed no valuable light upon the prob¬ 
lem of Jesus* actual existence. Still it is believed 
that these three writers, Josephus, Tacitus and Pltyy, 
help to confirm the portrait of Jesus which is re¬ 
vealed to us in the Gospel narratives. 

■We get our earliest evidence of Jesus* existence 
from the 'letters of Paul, The question has been raised 
as to whether Paul actually mm Jesus, Two passages 
are quoted as intimating that Paul had seen Jesus (a) n Am 
I not an apostle? Am I not tree? Have I not seen Jesus 

Christ our Lord?*® fb) "Wherefore henceforth know we no 
man after the flesh: yea,th.oughwe have known Christ after 
the flesh, yet now henceforth know we him no more.The 
first passage alludes to the vision which Paul saw, as 
he travelled to Damascus to persecute the Christians in 
that city. The second message seems to infer that from 
this time onwards ha does not intend to have anything to 
do with the earthly career of Jesus, he is going to 
centre his attention on the tiring, that to him is vital, 
the Jesus as the Wesslah. 

Johannes Weiss, contends that Paul had seen Jesus. 

He must also have seen how these Christians met their 
fate, for he had mad© havoc of the Church.*"' To witness 
such an unshrinking faith on the part of these Christ¬ 
ians, at this period, mu it he ve left a great in pr e © si 0 n 
m Saul. He must ©Isoor he would not have 
persecuted hie followers. These things helped tp prepare 
him for the great change; he looked upon every" event in

from visiting the Thee salontans* because Satan hinder¬ 
ed hira." 1 

Sorae critics regard it as decisive that Paul had 
not seen Jesus, because he never mentioned that fact 
openly; even when he had many opportunities for doing 
so, and even when his own Apo6 tiesliip r was a great trouble 
to many of the Churches in which he laboured; therefore 
if he hod seen the Lord and had declared this fact to the 
churches, he wotild have saved them quite a lot of anxiety, 
and his own claim to be one of the Apostles would not 
have been questioned. 

Paul does give evidence of knowing the life of Jesus: 
he refers to the death, crucifixion and betrayal of Jesus; 
he also mentions the* Institution of the Lord’s Supper and 
the burial of Jeeus. 3 * He refers to the humble life which 
Jesus lived.'" He was born under the law, of a woman. ' 

But Paul is primarily interested in the death of Jeeue 
because this Is the first act of the Oreat Drama, which 
displays Jesus as the ^eseiah to be. This explains why 
he focuses his attention only on the death and the last 
events in the life of Jesus. For Paul the life of Jesus 
wasedrapreeoed into the short space of one week; for the 
Synoptics the life of Jesus covered a period of not more 
than three years. 

The difficulty of reading Paul 1 b, that he implies 
a situation, which was known to the Church to whom he was 
writing and himself, and we have to recover the situation 
from implications in the letter. GalatiAne is a good 
illustration of this. 

But in the Gospels there is a double cifflculty. 

There is the situation of the author and the situation of 
Jesus* own day. Luke is supposed to have been written 
about 75* The ailtKor has one eye on Theophilus, to 
strengthen hie faith, and the other eye on the year thirty 
the time in which Jesus lived. While Paul preaches a 
sermon, Luke simply tells the story of the life of Jesus, 
Luke does not take up each of the difficulties of Theo¬ 
philus and dlBco.se each one thoroughly as he goes along, 
but he telle the story of past events as the best remedy 
for the difficulties of Theophilus. Luke has to see

the world of 75* and the enlarged Christian world 
after haul's Missionary Journeys, as well ®s the world 
in which Jeeue lived* 

:uark * There is a situation for Mark a® well as 
for Jesus. ’’And there followed Kim a certain young 
man, having a linen cloth cast about hie naked body; 
end the young men laid hold on him; and he left the 
linen cloth and fled from them naked*” 1 Mark thought 
this was interesting, and therefore put it In* It is 
a personal reminiscence. Matthew and Make copy before 
enf after this, but omit this passage as of no conseq- 
ue nee. 


When the Gospele were written Chriat lenity was a 
growing thing: the writers looked back on the life of 
the Founder through forty years of development, and 
tell the story of that life after this interval, as 
they see it now* 

If Woodrow Wilson had died in the first year of 
the la e war, hie life story would have had a far diff¬ 
erent colour from that which it will have when it is 
written now. If Marcus bode- had died before he had 
reached the age of forty, he would not have had a story 
written about hie life* But after that age he attained 
great fame, and he it regarded as one of the Greet 
Bights of the Church* The writers of the Biographies 
of these men will have to depict their lives ae they are 
them at the height of their fame end will tell of their 
early years in the light of subsequent events. 

Matthew . Matthew seems to have an aptitude for tatm 
u1at Ing things • He arranges the Parables in a chap¬ 

ter. Ee uses tifw and one-half chapters for the Ser¬ 
mon on the Mount* 3 He also usee the word Church* 
Matthew*e popularity..is shown by the fact that it is 
placed first in the ^ew Testament, and was most frequent¬ 
ly read and quoted in the early church* The situation 
in Matthew is largely the Jewish Christian Church and 
the readers of the Gospel were most edified by seeing 
Christianity and established religion, as growing out 
of the Old Testament "as it is written." l> Thus would 
Case establish the Historicity of Jesus. * * 6

riimcsKs in thk fibst century• 


This ie one of the great questions around which 
controversy has raged# The simple Winded follower 
of Jesus of Nazareth feels that miracles are absolute¬ 
ly essential to hie: religion and to his belief in 
Jesus Christ. 

But students ar© becoming more and more convinced 
that it does not matter whether Jesus performed mirac¬ 
les or not; miracles are not essential to belief, and 
for them to be taken away from the picture of Jesus 
will not damage His character to any large degree* 

The development of the past two centuries in the 
scientific world has left its mark on the religious 
life of the educated man, so that the naive view of 
the world end of physical phenomena, which was char¬ 
acteristic of the life of the Christian Church, down 
to the middle Agee, has gone; the miracles were the 
’sin© qua non’,'but to-day miracles instead of being 
I en evidence of Christianity’s power, needs an Apologia 
j or defence. 

The Ideal life remains as the great challenge to 
all men, and if we only strive to emulate Els prin¬ 
ciples, and 'love God with all our heart, soul, mind 
and strength, and our neighbour as ourselves, 1 we shall 
be striving after the highest things; and the super¬ 
natural elements which are attributed to Jesus may be 
relegated to a secondary position, or thrown aside 
altogether. 

There are two types of miracles ascribed to Jesus 
I. The miracles which Jesus is said to have performed, 
and II. The miracle of Jesus’ own personality. 

All the reports concerning Jesus c*me through 
early Christian Tradition, and it Is altogether likely 
I that if the first century had not been so vitally 
1 interested in miracles that the Gospel writers and 
the early Christian fathers would not have stressed 
them as they dicl. 

Y/e can Gist in uieh two etraihe in the Jesus tra¬ 
dition. The non-Barkan or s sections of the Synoptic 














- c - 


Gospels, common to Matthew and Luke, depict Jesus mainly 
as a teacher; or as the Jews thought the wise man. 1 2 
Kence this part is taken up almost entirely with the 
sayings of Jesus, He is assumed to t© a supernaturally 
endowed individual, but he refuses at the outset to make 
His career one of miraculous display. He finds th© 
acme of His ambition realised in preaching the Gospel 
i to the poor and is content to await God’s own good time 
for the revelation of His messianic glory. This dis¬ 
position to set Jesus’ teaching in the foreground, 
deriving evidence of His uniqueness mainly from the 
power with which He spoke His message, was a most app¬ 
ropriate way of approaching Jews who reverenced above 
all others the historical Personages whom God had chosen 
to utter His message. 

With ilark on the other hand, another interest be¬ 
comes prominent. Instead of recordMg Jesus' refusal 
to make any miraculous displays, Mark's account of the 
Temptation emphasises the miracle element. Piracies 
characterised Hie ministry from the beginning and de¬ 
monstrated Hie power over the demons who recognised in 
Him the Hessiah, In stressing this side of Jesus' 
work, Hark made the new religion capable of ministering 
to a very pressing demand, particularly among his gen- 
til© audiences. The common people of the Graeco-Homan 
world were bound by fetters, which to us are gross super- 
stitlonej. fearing evil demons of all sorts. To such 
persons the new Gospel cam© as a message of deliverance 
and protection. They need not wait until the end of 
the world to enjoy the blessings of the new kingdom. 

In this new kingdom victory over demons in the power 
of Jesus' name was one of its most significant blessings 
made possible through Jesus' ieesianie triumph over 
Satan. Luke and the Acts endeavour to unite these two 
elements in the story of Jesus* life, the "Doings" 
and th$ "Teachings"©? all that Jesus began to do and to 
teach* c 

The interest of the first century people was cer¬ 
tainly in the miraculous. The miraculous authenticated 
the new religion. Dill ©ay©, 'the air was full of the 
lawless and the supernatural. Science, in the modern 
sense, was yet unborn; it was a mere rudimentary mass of

i,e•, Kcclius:4th " 2 re 














random guesses, with as little right to command the 
reef-on ae the-, legends which sprang from the^Tawl* 
imaginations? Lecky says, 1 physical science has 
given a new direction to the ourrente of imaglnation, 
supplied the judgment with new measurea of probability p 
and has thus affected the whole circle of our beliefs, 


But how far did this interest in the miraculous 
stimulate the imagination of the first century writers? 

Paul tells what he himself thought of miracles, 

•And God hath set some in the Church, first Apostles, 
secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that mir¬ 
acles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, di¬ 
versities of tongues. 1 Christianity for Paul is a 
supernatural thing and the activities of Christianities 
are supernatural, because they have the gift of the Holy 
Spirit and what they do is miraculous. 

In Galatians ^ Paul would persuade the people that 
his Christianity ie better than the Christianity preach¬ 
ed by the Judaisers. Hie evidence is his own power to 
work miracles, and the fact that the members of the 
Church of Galatia were also able to work miracles, thanks 
to the Gospel of faith which he preached and which they 
believed. 

In the Corinthians^ Paul's authority as an Apostle 
ie discussed, he substantiates his claim to the Apostle- 
ship by hie ability to work miracles, which power is da- 
; rived from his spiritual endowment. 

According to Acts, the power to work miracles is 
due to the gift of the Holy Spirit, and the Christians 
were able to perform miracles because of this new enthus¬ 
iasm. 


Irenaeue assure© xm that all Christlane possessed 
the power of working miracles, that they prophesied, east 
out devils, heeled the sick, and sometimes raised the 
dead. St. Augustine says that the bones of St.Stephen 
were brought to Hippo, and that through their mysterious 
power five dead persons were raised. 0 


mark shows Jesus' power to cast out demons, and 
Matthew writes with the presupposition that Jesus ie the 
exponent of the miraculous. The miraculous, however, 
does not impart to our herd his true worth for us to-day.

Dr. Gordon, of Old South Church, Boston, says, 
w We can imagine one horn without a human father, able 
to still storms and to walk on the tempestuous waves, 
to feed multitudes on food ordinarily sufficient only 
for a few persons, cleansing lepers, opening blind eyes, 
unstopping deaf ears, raising the dead and finally him¬ 
self reappearing after death; we can imagine a career 
like this, full of portent and wonder from beginning to 
end, and yet absolutely destitute of those supreme qual¬ 
ities that have given Jesus the moral leadership of the 
world. Plato’s story of the ring of Gygee illustrates 
this possibility; the wearer of the ring becomes invis¬ 
ible, he moves in an order of miracle, for him natural 
law does not exist. Yet his power to do with nature 
as he pleases may mean boundless opportunities to de- 
| fraud and outrage human life undetected. And if tMe 
I wizard becomes a beneficent wizard, who knows that he is 
not devising new forms of deception and plunder? It is 
plainly possible, therefore, that we might have the mir¬ 
acles of Jesus without Jeaui himself; that we might poss¬ 
ess the wonderful works without possessing the Divine 
;,an," 1 

Then how are we to account for the idea that Jesus 
used miraculous power to attest His authority? Christ¬ 
ianity originated at a time when practically all people 
were religious; the Greeks and Homans had their peculiar 
Deities, and so Christianity got away at a good start. 

God came peculiarly close to men in those early days, ard 
at the time of Jesus’ ministry there were real miracles 
as opposed to the counterfeit miracles of the Sub-Apos¬ 
tolic Age. The Church bemoans the fact that we do not 
have miracles to-day. Aortal richness is not healed, 
our dead are not restored to life, there is no voice that 
stills the tern set on our sees, no one can bid us walk 
upon the waters and save us when our faith fails, there 
ie no gracious hand to increase the meagre food supplies 
in starving homes, as Elijah was able to prevent the 
barrel of meal and the cruse of oil from dwindling away. 
The interest of suffering men and women to-day in these 
miracles of our ^ord must be a pathetic interest, be¬ 
reaved parents may recall the fact that Jesus restored 
Jairus* daughter to life, why does He not restore our 
child? There are no such miracles to-day, and among 
sane minds they are nowhere expected, and in our genera¬ 
tion we ore beset behind, before and on either side by 
a rational order fixed es fete.

report. It ie not the empty tomb that m-tiers for us, 
b t the fact that Jesus ie alive. Cut ten' e view is 
that in the study of Therapeuti ob, it has been found 
that there are two elements necessary for any cure, 
suggestion on the part of the healer, end faith on the 
part of the person healed. In the case of Jesus and 
the deaf and dumb man at Beoapolio, J«j la¬ 

gers to His ears to signify which organs He wished to 
be effectea, then He touched His tongue to draw atten¬ 
tion to the other infirmity, He next looked up to heaven 
sighed and said ’’Kphphrate", be opened. The man in 
looking could not help knowing what Jesus said for no 
word could be more easily read fro® Hie lips. The 

result was a cure* Peter and John going up to the 
temple, saw a lame man asking for alms. Peter turned, 
fastened hit eyes on him and commanded in turn that he 
should look ©t them* "He gave heed unto them*’* Peter 
then gave the command, "In the name of Jesus Christ of 
Nazareth, w&lk." The man was immediately cured. At 
Bethlehem they bring Him a blind man, Jesus takes him 
by the hand and leads him out of the village, spite on 
his eyes, leys Hie hands on him and asks, "Beeet thou 
aught?", he answered, "I see men ®8 trees walking." 

Jesus repeats the suggestion and as He lays Eli hands 
on him this time he sees clearly. * 

Huring the late waf' one of our own college stud¬ 
ents, Mr, A. G* was attached to the IwA.M.C* An 

Australian soldier was in a certain hospital sick, and 
had lost the desire to recover. Mr* Bea saw the state 
of the man’s mind, and gave him a lecture on his coward¬ 
ice; he urged the man to pull himeelf together and make 
an effort to recover. The soldier took" the message to 
heart, determined to get well and succeeded. Some time 
afterwards he met Hr. I#ea and thanked him for saving his 
life. 

Faith was necessary for the cures of Jesus. Then 
He was going to the house of the ruler to heal hie 
daughter, a woman who had heard of Jesus’ cures and 
perhaps had seen them., had great faith in His powers; 
she merely touched the hem of His garment and. was healed 
her faith had made her whole. After the death of 
Anneniae and Sapphire the people had unbounded faith 
in reter and he healed many. When Paul was at Ephesus, 
so great was the faith of the people in him and in the 
power which he had to heal that unto the sick were 
carried away from his body handkerchiefs or aprons, and

the disease departed. The virtue was not in the aprons 
hut in their faith. That then shall we say of Jesus? 

At least sixteen of His thirty-four miracles have never 
been duplicated by suggestive Therapeutics and so far as 
we are able to see never will he* Jesus is above and be¬ 
yond us. He healed the sick and feverish by command as 
men to-day may, but He also raised the dead, a feat which, 
the wildest thinkers of modern science do not anticipate. 1 

But in this first century the people did not under¬ 
stand the science of Therapeutics, hence anything remark¬ 
able was a miracle. A trolley car or wireless telegraphy 
would have been as great a miracle in Jesus 1 day as still¬ 
ing the tempest or raising the dead. Therapeutics is a 
:miracle to illiterate people to-day. In the first cen¬ 
tury, therefore, miracles were not impossible, and men 
'were able to cast out demons; in fact the Healing Cults 
of that day were doing exactly what Jesus did. 

The last generation has called attention to the first 
'century mind and has sought through the works of non- 
1 Christian writers of the Hellenistic world to recover the 
thought world of the first century; the result has been 
that the study of Comparative Religions and Hellenistic 
Literature (especially in the Mystery Cults and Healing 
Cults) has been to show that miracles of healing were 
■orevalent, and the expected thing of a Religious Person¬ 
ality; and that all the healing devices of the first 
century were connected with Religion. The Doctors were 
the religious leaders of the people, and the healing of 
! diseases was a recognised part of religion. 

The Cult of Asclepius at Spidauros^was a very 
! famous one at the opening of the Christian Era. Tried- 
i lander tells the story of Euphronius. Euphronius was 
a miserable fellow who delighted ir the gossip of Epic¬ 
urus, which taught Atheism and wickedness. He had a 
severe attack of pneumonia and the physicians could not 
heal him. He was" taken to the Temple of Asclepius. 

! After he had fallen asleep there, it seemed to him that 
one of the Priests told him that there was only one rem¬ 
edy for salvation. He must burn the writings of Epicurus, 
knead the ashes of these godless, sinful and effeminate 
; books with moist wax, smear his belly and breast there- 
* with, and tie bandages round them. He was healed after 
following these instructions and ever afterwards was a 
model of^pie ty for oth ers.^ (Cf . Antiphlogestin e.)

Arietarohue of Tegea, the tragic poet* fell ill 
and web c red by Asclepius, who commanded him to bring 
a thank offering* 1 At Carlsbnrg in Transylvania* a 
legate of the fifth legion records his own gratitude 
to Aeclepluo and all the gods and goddesses of the 
place, and that ofLhlfi wife and daughter for the recov¬ 
ery of his sight. 1 Arlatidaa was an invalid, who appease 
to have'been disordered in every organ. Ha travailed to 
Borne - a hundred cl.aye* journey - which aggravated hie 
sufferings, and followed the prescript lone of Aeclepius, 
which would have killed any ordinary man. His faith 
must have been very robust for his tortures lasted thir¬ 
teen years. After being prostrate for years, suddenly 
he found Me balance restored; the tide of energy return¬ 
ed to the old channels and Aristides believed himself the 
special object of Divine favour. w 


Aristides declares of the inexhaustible sacred well 
in the Temple of Aeclepius at Pergamus, that by bathing 
in it, many recovered their eyesight, and were cured of 
chest complaints,, asthma, and deformity of the feet; a 
dumb man who drank of its waters was able to speak; in 
several eases merely drawing the water from the well 
effected a cure. ^ 

During the excavations in the Temple of Aeclepius 
at Spidaurue in 1083-4, two of the six tablets have been 
| found, on which marvellous cures accomplished by the god 
are recorded. In addition to cures of the lame, the 
blind and the dumb, we find the recovery of a woman 
after being pregrant five years with a boy, who, immed¬ 
iately he was born, washed himself and walked about with 
his mother. & (See Kuo. Brit. Asolepiue and Epidaurue.) 


In Classic authors we also get accounts of people 
being, raised from the dead. In duel an the Mar, Anti¬ 
gen V s says, "I know of a man who rose from the dead 
twenty days after he had bean buried. I attended him 
both before hi© death end after his resurrect ion.” 6 
Lucian is a satirist and is poking fun at the incredible 
stories of his contemporaries, but yet hie fun making it 
evidence of the widespread belief in miracles. 


Euripides in his Aloestie* tells the story of how 
Hercules restored to life Alceatie, the wife of Acmetus, 
who had died in place of her husband. 7

Vergil telle*the story of Orpheus end Eurydioe. 
Arietaeus was the sdn of Apollo and Cyrenc. He became 
enamoured of Eurydioe, the wife of Orpheus. However, 
Eurydioe died and Orpheue was grievously enraged because 
his wife was taken from him, Orpheue went down to 
Pluto *& hell to being hack hie wife. On their way from 
Hades, and Just as they reached the verge of light, 
Orpheue looked at hie wife who was following. Phis 
broke the terms by which he was to retain hie wife and 
she vanished from hie eight in the opposite-.direction, 
like smoke blended with unsubstantial air. 1 


In this first century world there were many Relig¬ 
ious Personalities who had died and had risen from the 
dead, and had been elevated to the rank of gods. 


Fraser in hie "Dying God" portrays some of the pe¬ 
culiar Religious Customs performed in Austria, Germany, 
and Russia. Austria end Germany have a Religious cere¬ 
mony in which a dumrap representing death is either burned 
or thrown into a river to prevent death carrying away 
any of the people during the year. This destruction of 
the god. Death, is also supposed to bring with it inc¬ 


reased fruitfulness, both to the land, cattle and human 
beings. ^ 


Case in hie Evolution of Early Christianity cites 
some interesting narratives: Both Greek end batin writers 
tell the story of Adonis and Aphrodite. The slain - or 
in some myths, stolen-god, Adonis, descends to the lower 
world; Aphrodite agonises in grief at his disappearance. 
Finally he is restored in the Springtime and continues 
with the revolution of the Seasons to die and rise ©gain 
each year. ® 

The Myths about Attls vary in details, but all have 
the same general import. Attie dies, either at the 
hand of an enemy or by self mutilation, end the goddess 
mourns until he it restored to life. The Deity *t 
triumph over death is mde the basis of the ritual by 
which the believer avails himself of the god’s help in 
effecting a similar victory for mortals. 4 


In and about Syria there was a goddess worshipped, 
named Ishtar. She is the goddess of prosperity and

fertility* who teaches? men the arte of civilization and 
has a constant care for their welfare, Associated with 
her is a male deity Tammuz, a youthful god who is slain, 
remains for a period in the lower world, end ie later 
revived. Ishtar personifies the source of life and 
Tamranz represents life in its natural manifestations - 
the constantly rotating cycle of birth and death. Hence 
the prominence of lamentation in his Cult, a practice 
which in the time of Ezekiel had been adopted by the 
$ewe end was being parried on by the women, at the Morth 
gate of the p T©raple. Tammuz Is mentioned in the Old 
Testament. A 


The story of Osiris * death and resurrection: 

Osiris, upon the earth, had been a King of Egypt, 
bestowing the gifts of civilization upon mankind. He' 
suffered a violent death and lei© in fierce grief sought 
him until she recovered the body, which was carefully 
embalmed. Another tradition tells of the diemembermeat 
of the body, the part© being collected by Isis, and the 
whole restored to life. Osiris then became King of the 
nether world. Under astral influence his dominion was 
transferred to the plains of AAlu, in the West where the 
sun sank out of sight, absorbed In the death of night. 
Osiris was the protdtype of the virtuous man who sought 
from religion the ap.s nr a nee of admission into the abode 
of the blest after death. If a traveller, on reaching 
the judgment hall of Osiris, received a favourable ver¬ 
dict, he was permitted to enter the plain of Aalu, where 
he might load forever a life of eternal happiness. The 
believer identified hie own career so clearly with that 
of Osiris that the soul of a dead man was actually celled 
"Osiris" and those who gained admission to the p^ain of 
Aalu could stem become gods if they bo desired. 


‘he BleuSian Mystery of hemeter and her daughter 
Persephone: 

Hero wished to join this Cult, but was refused 
admission. Augustus was initiated in 21 B.C., 


although 


he was not favourably disposed to foreign religions. 

In this Elensian Mystery, Her©phone is carried off to 
become the wife of Unto, /ting of the lower world. The 
mother in grief and re ©entrant refuses life to nature 
until Persephone ie restored; an arrangement is ma.de by 
which the latter spend© a portion of the year with the

It a part, and Demeter before ascending Olympus with her 
risen daughter instructs men in her rites in order that 
they may attain to a blessed life after death. The 
rational; of this myth ie evident. It portrays the action^ 
of life in nature. Mature was dead in winter, when the 
mot tier goddess, source of all life, was grieved at the 
loss of her daughter; hut she resumed her kindly activity 
in the spring and maintained life in nature until Per¬ 
sephone was removed again to Hades. Spring brought 
another release and another triumph of life over death. 
This victory over death, together with the attainment of 
a happy life in the next world, was the special privi¬ 
lege of thos who were initiated into Ferneter *s Cult. 

The first century people believed in the direct 
intervention of the laity. Fricalender eeye there is 
a continuous Hierarchy of Superhuman Beings which keep 
up the connection between.the human and the Bivine,and 
the subordinate god# act as interpreters and mediators 
between human weakness and Bivine Sovereignty. It is 
they who appear to men, speak to them and. associate with 
them, and render them the assistance which human nature 
always needs from heaven. They healsi cknees, give ad¬ 
vice in trouble, reveal what ie hidden, give help in 
work and guidance on the road. Some are protecting 
spirits of individuals, others are terrible, and some 
are benevolent to men. The natures of Demons arc as 
numerous ae the naturae of men. To them belong in par¬ 
ticular human souls separated from the body, who ere 
unwilling to abandon their earthly desires or occupa¬ 
tions even in a higher nature. Thus Ascleplus still 
practises the healing art, Hercules performs deeds of 
might, and Dionysius continues his revels. 2 

Aelian, a second or third century writer, believed 
In the immediate interference of the heavenly powers, 
to reward the pious believer, and to ounieh the defiant 
sceptic. Birsoles, oracles, presages and warning dreams 

startle the reader on every page of hie work. ^ 

When Lysan&er, who was in command of the Peloponnes¬ 
ian Fleet, defeated by a. stratagem, a large force of the 
Athenians, and thus ended the Peolponnesian War, many 
regarded tie victory as e divine intervention and there 
were some people who affirmed that the stars of Castor 
and Pollux were seen on each side of Lyeander's ship,

when he first Bet sail from the haven towards his 
enemies, shining about the helm, and some say the 
stone which fell down was a sign of this slaughter. 

For a stone of groat size did fall, according to 
common belief, from heaven, at Aegos Pot&mi, which ie 
shown to this day and held in great esteem by the Cher- 
sonites. 1 

In the eighth year of the reign of llama, a terrible 
pestilence which traversed all Italy ravaged likewise 
the city of Home; and the cit1 gens, being In distress, 
and despondent, & brasen target, they say, fell from 
heaven into the hands of Suwa for the use and safety of 
the city• ‘* 

In the first century world the possibility of a 
Religious Personality being raised from the dead was 
accepted on every hand, so that the story of the raising 
of the dead and the resurrection functioned properly in 
that first century world, in the evolution of the Supreme 
Personality in Bellglen. 

Suetonius says that the body of Caesar Augustus was 
carried to the Campus Martiue and there burnt* A man 
of .Praetorian rank affirmed upon oath, that he_8AW his 
spirit ascend from the funeral pyre to heaven. c ' The 
translation of Caesar to the gods*, says Suetonius, was 
not only the result of a decree of the Senate, but in 
accordance with the belief of the multitude; a comet, 
which was visible for the next seven days was supposed 
to be his soul taken up into heaven. 

In the thirty-seventh year, counted from the founda¬ 
tion of Home, when Komulue, t he*.reigning, 6id on the 
fifth day of the month of July, called the Caprotine 
Bones, offer a public sacrifice at the Goat’s Marsh, in 
the presence of the Senate and people of Rome. Suddenly 
the sky was darkened, a thick cloud of storm and rain 
settled on the earth; the common people fled in fright 
and were dispersed; in the whirlwind Hamulus disappeared* 
and the body was never found either living or dead. A 
foul suspicion presently attached Itself to the Patric¬ 
ians that as they were tired of kingly government, they 
had made away with Eomulus to secure authority for them- 
efelves. The Patricians decreed divine honours to Bom- 
ulus as to one not dead but translated to a higher con¬ 
dition: Proeaius, a man of note, took oath that he saw

hereafter style him "by the name of Quirintis”• 1 

Peregrinue, before a number of men, resolved to 
depart this life in the blaze and glory of the funeral 
pyre, kindled by his ovsn hand. Oracles were circulated 
in which Peregrinue appears as the Phoenix, rising un~* 
scathed and rejuvenescent from the pyre, predicting 
that he is the Guardian Spirit of the right, that al¬ 
tars will rise in his honour, and that he will perform 
miracles of healing. As the fire burst into flames 
there was a great earthquake, accompanied by a sub¬ 
terranean thunder, and a vulture rose from the fire, 
proclaiming in a human voice, as it winged its way 
heavenwards, ”1 have left earth behind - I go to 
Olympus,” * 

Suetonius relates that after Hero had caused hie 
mother to be murdered, his conscience troubled him 
severely for this atrocious act, and he frequently 
affirmed that he was haunted by his mother*s ghost,and 
persecuted with the whips and burning torches of the 
Furies. 

Apuleiue in his Golden Ass tells the stories of 
Tlepolemus and a baker; 

Tlepolemus was attacked by a wild boar and while 
he struggled with it, his brother, Throwsyllus, assisted 
to kill him with his spear, because he was enamoured of 
Charite 5 Tlepolemus 1 wife* Cbarite, tried to starve 
herself to death, but wee ordered by her parents to 
cease mourning and assist with the household duties, 
Thrasyllus tried to win Gharite for his wife; while she 
delayed him, the shape of Tlepolemus, that was slain so 
mieerebly, appeared to Charite while she slept, with a 
pale and bloody face. He warmed her that Thrasyllus 
was the cause of his death and warned her not to marry 
him or have anything at all to do witja him, Charite, 
thus warned, lured Thrasyllus to her bed chamber, where 
her nurse made him sleep with wine mixed with drugs; 
then Charite plucked out both his eyes^and next day 
committed suicide on Tlepolemus* tomb.

she consulted a witch; she desired that she might return

and the door vaes closed. After a time, hie servants 
requiring new orders went to hie chamber, and after

Apollonius of Tyana, whom the lagans of the 
second century, set up in opposition to Jeeus, had

freed a young man from a vampire with whom he was 
enamoured, and filled the world with the fame of hit 
miracles and of his sanctity, 1 

Josephus tells the story of a wonderful plant. 

In the valley which encompasses the city of Mechorus 
on the north side, there is a certain place called 
Raar^e, which produces a root of the same name with 
itself; its colour is like to that of flame, and 
toward the evening it sends out a certain ray like 
lightning; it is not easily taken by such &e would 
do it, but recedes from their hands, nor will yield 
itself to be taken ouietly until either the urine of 
a woman or blood be poured upon it; nay, even then it 
j is certain death to those that touch it, unless anyone 
take and hang the root itself down from his hand and 
j so carry it away* It my alec be taken another way 
without danger, which is this: they dig a trench quite 
round about it, till the hidden part of the root be very 
small, then they tie a dog to It, and. when the dog tries 
I hard to follow him that tied him, this root is easily 
plucked up, but the dog immediately dies, as If it were 
instead of the man that would take the plant away, llor 
after this need any one be afraid of taking it into 
their hands; yet after all this pains in getting, it is 
only valuable on account, of one virtue it hath, that if 
it be only brought to EtC* persons. It quickly drives 
| away those called demons, which are no others than the 
spirits of the wicked, that enter in any men that are 
alive and kill 0 them, unless they can obtain some help 
’ against them* c

The Gospel writers in the first century knew what 
: would function in their day and of all the stories of 
Jesus* day they knew which to choose. Any religion 
which hoped to function properly in that age would have 
to provide a remedy for diseased demons. 

It is altogether probable that exorcisms were 
l effected by Jesus. Jesus was raid to cast out Demons

cast out demons by other names, but Jesus did not use 
: any formula. He simply commanded the demons to depart, 

| Eusebius says that in the Churoh of Home, "there were 
forty-six Presbyters, seven beacons, seven sub-beacons, 
forty-two &colythe, fifty-two exorcists, readers, Jan¬ 
itors, and over fifteen hundred widows and persons in 
distress, all of whom the grace end kindness of the 
Paster nourished. The footnote says concerning the 
exorcists, that they constituted one of the inferior 
orders of the clergy, but although we find exorcism 
very frequently referred to by the Fathers of the sec¬ 
ond century, there seems to have been no such office 
until the third century, the present being the earliest 
distinct reference to it. In the fourth century we 
find the office in all parte of the Church, East and 
West. Their duty wee to take charge of those supposed 
to be possessed of an evil spirit to pray with them, 
and exorcise the demon when possible. 1 

However, the magicians ded not haveoai very- prosper¬ 
ous time in Palestine, because there was an Old Testa¬ 
ment Lawr against such practices. By this law against 
witchcraft, some good witches were burned. The reason 
for the destruction of the magician was caused by the 
fact that he was soon surrounded by people who put great 
faith in this business, and if the name of the healing 
god was permitted in Palestine, b© notheism would be en¬ 
dangered. People would feel kindly to this god who 
had cast out these evil spirits, and the people would 
worship, erect temples and tablets to his honour. 

We also find that the people of this period were 
very susceptible to omens and signs.

ion that the Potttil, whose family had always possessed 
the right of ministering to the f Ava Maxima v of Hercules; 
; transferred that duty to some Temple servants whom they 
had instructed in the various observances* There is a

he had seen and beard, the repeated appearances of 
Jupiter In hie sleep, and the threatening wrath of 
heaven brought home to him by his calamities. On the 
strong advice of all present, he was carried in e lit¬ 
ter to the Consul© in the Forum, and from there by the 
Consuls' order into the Senate House. After repeat¬ 
ing the same story to the Senators, to the intense 
surprise of all, another marvel occurred. The tra¬ 
dition rune that he who had been carried into the Sen¬ 
ate House paralysed in every limb, returned home after 
performing his duty, on hie own feet.l 

Both Tacitus and Pliny the Younger tell the story 
of Curtins Rufus: 

Rufus was a Roman attached to the Quaestor to whom 
Africa had been allotted. One day as he was waiving 
elone at midday in some unfrequented arcade in the town 
of Ad rumen turn, he mm a female figure of more than humai 
stature and heard a voice "Thou, Rufus, art the man who 
will one day come into this Province ae Proconsul," 

Raised high in hope by such a presage, he returned to 
Rome, where, theugh the lavish expenditure of hie friend© 
and his own vigorous ability he obtained the Quaestorship 
iand eventually the Praetorehip from the Emperor fiberiu©. 2 

Suetonius tells the following story: 

On one occasion during the Civil War against WuciuS 
Antonias, Governor of Upper Germany, Remitian's troops 
defeated Antonins. For, at the moment of joining battle, 
the Rhine suddenly thawed, and the troops of the Barbar¬ 
ians which were ready to join Antonia© were prevented from 
crossing the river. Of this victory Dora!tian had notice 
by some presages before the messengers, who brought news 
of it, arrived. For upon the very day the battle was 
fought a splendid eagle spread its wings round his statue 
at Rome, making most joyful cries, and shortly after e. 
rumour became common, that Antonius was slain; many posit¬ 
ively affirm that they saw his head brought to the dity.S 

Maximus of Tyre declares that he himself h&B seen 
bioscura, like shining stare, guiding a storm-tossed ship 
and that Aeclepius appeared to him, not in a dream, but 
when he was awake. Friedlander adds that it i© now easy 
;to understand how opponents of Chrl. etianity, like Celsue,

j er.gel© of Christian and Jewish beliefs#* 

Suetonius collected from many source© stories, 
signs and wonders which foreshadowed the great destiny 
and also the death of Augustus# among which cr© some 
founded on Astrology. On the day of th© Emperor's 
Mrth, A. lilgidius, a learned Astrologer, found that 
th© position of the stars fotetold a coming master of 
the world. Augustus himself received a similar por¬ 
tent from Theagenes, a star reader of Apollon1a.” 

In the Homan Empire there is not an historian from 
Tacitus down to th© meanest writer in Augustan History, 
who was not convinced that numerous prodigies fore¬ 
shadowed the accession of every sovereign and every 
great catastrophe that fell upon the people. Vergil 
tells us that the sun showed his pity for Home at Caesar's 
death, when he shrouded his bright head with a lurid 
darkness, and impious mortals feared eternal night. 

For want of th© sun's heat, the fruits rotted without 
coming to maturity; at that time the earth too and waters 
of the deep, foul dogs and ill-omened birds gat© warning, 0 
(An eclipse of the sun actually occurred in November of f 
that year.) 


Luring the reign of Demitian, e Pythagorean Apostle 
predicted a plague at Ephesus, wee able to cast out 
demons, raise the dead and possessed the fEcn.lty of 
vanishing like a phantom from the clutches of LAraltian.4 

Demitian detested those- who pretended to able 
! to foretell future events. An Astrologer named(.Asele- 
tario, had been informed afai.net and did not deny hav¬ 
ing predicted some future event© - of which, from the 
principles of his art, he confessed he had a foreknow¬ 
ledge. Domitlsn asked him what end he thought he should 
come to himself. To which he replied. M 1 shall in e

ed him immediately to be slain and in order to demon¬ 
strate the variety of hie art, to be carefully buried. 
Luring the preparation© for executing this order it 
happened that the funeral pile was blown down by a sud¬ 
den storm and the body half-burnt was torn to pieces by 
j dogs.^

child just Leginning to Bpeak, once ordered some frogs

Tacitus says that on one occasion while Vespasian 
was at Alexandria, a well known blind man oame and threw 
himself at the Emperor’s knees, and implored him with 
groans to heal hie infirmity. The blind man said he 
had Leon ordered to do this by the god Serapie. He 
begged Vespasian that .he would deign to moisten his 
cheeks and eyeballs wsjth his spittle. Another with a 
diseased hand, at the counsel of the seme god, prayed 
that the limb might feel the print of a Caesar’s foot. 
They persisted and he, though on the one .hand, feared 
the scandal of a fruitless attempt, yet on the other 
hand, was induced by the entreaties of the men and by 
the language of his flatterers to hope for success. 
Vespasian accomplished what was required; the hand was 
instantly reatordd to its use, and the light of day again 
shone upon the blind. Tereons actually present attest 

both facts^ even now when nothing is to be gained by

evening, the physicians reported to the King e diminu- 
tion^of the disease in the course of the cay, and that 
thevnar-'ed for death was out of danger. The King had 
unconsciously performed a mlraolo.l 

Fried!ander states that in some ceres loth Pagan© 
and Christians laid claim to the same miracles. An 
instance of this is recorded. During the war of the 
1 uadi (17&-4) in the reign of Marcus Aurelius, the 
Homan army, overcome by the heat of the blazing sun, 
found itself surrounded by a superior force and threat¬ 
ened with annihil ation. Then suddenly thick clouds 
.gathered together, rain fell in torrents and a fearful 
storm wrought havoc and confusion in the ranks of the 
enemy. The Romans were saved and gained the victory. 
The effect of this event was overwhelming, it was re¬ 
garded as a miracle the :iemory of which lasted till the 
last days of antiquitygCfor centuries afterwards was 
appealed to by both Christiana and Pagans as a proof of 
their respective faiths. A Christian contemporary 
states that this miracle was wrought by the prayers of 
the Christian soldiers of the twelfth legion. Tertul- 
11an refers to the Christian notion as well known end 
appeals to a letter of Marcus ^nreliue in support of 


Dill says it ie curious to see that Origan (the 
Christian) and Celsue (the Pagan) as regards the proba¬ 
bility of recurring miracles, are on very much the same 
plane of spiritual'belief and that the Christian Apolo¬ 
gist is fighting with one arm tied. Ho is disabled 
from delivering his assaults at the heart of the enemy's 
position. The gods of heathenism are still to him 
living and portent spirits, although they ere spirits 
of evil.

aeoeptad by the champions of the Church. All the 
Church Fathers admit their miracles but ascribe them

inadmi m ihle, pad no doubt that in reality, a demon 
under the name of Antinous haunted hie jampie. But the 
mysteries performed by thie Cult were far different 
from those of .Teens' follower©.Origen testifies to 
the innumerable witneae©© to the miraclee of Jeeue, 
adding that he himself had aeon men delivered from griev¬ 
ous di©eases, demoniacal possession, madness and other 
evils, which neither men nor demons could heal, simply 
by calling upon the name of God and Jesus•*- 

Becky in his book speaks of the present day atti¬ 
tude towards miracles and declares that it 1 b not that 
of doubt, of hesitation, of discontent with the exist¬ 
ing evidence, but rather of absolute decisive and even 
uncxaraining incredulity. The question of the credulity 
of fairy tales has not been resolved by an examination 
of evidence, but by an observation of the laws of his¬ 
toric development. Wherever we find an ignorant or 
rustic population, the belief in falr1.ee is found to 
exist and oirouraetantis! accounts of their opposition 
er© circulated. But invariably with Increased educating. 
this belief passes a way. .miracles to the savage are 

neither etrange events nor violation© of natural law, 
but simply the unveiling or manifestation of the ordin¬ 
ary government of the world. The simple love of the 
wonderful and the complete absence of all critical 
spirit aid the formation. In certain stages of society 
an accretion of miraculous legend is naturally formed 
©round prominent personages or institutions. We ex¬ 
pect them, when men are destitute of critical spirit, 
when the notion of uniform law is yet unborn and when 
their imaginations are ©till incapable of rising to 
abstract ideas, histories of miracles are always formed 
end they continue to flourish end to multiply until 
these conditions have altered. ..iracle|| ; cease when 
men cease to believe and to expect them* 

The gradual decadence of miraculous narratives. 
which accompanies advancing civilisation may be chiefly 
traced to three causes: 

1. The first is the general accuracy of observation 
and of statement which all education tends, more 
or less, to produce, which check© amplification© of 
the undisciplined imagination end is speedily 
followed by a much stronger moral feeling on the 
subject of truth than ever exists in a rode civili¬ 
sation*

II. The second ie an increased power of obstruction which 
la likewise a result of general education and which 
by correcting the early habit of personifying all 
phenomena destroys one of the moat prolific sources 
of legends and closee the mythical period of history. 

II. The third ie the progress of physical science, which 
gradually dispel a that conception of a universe 
governed by perpetual and arbitrary interference,, 
from which, for the most part, these legends origin¬ 
ally sprang• The whole history of physical ecience 

is one continual revelation of tie reign of law. The 
same law that governs the motions of a grain of cast, 
or the light of the glowworm's lamp, is shown to pre¬ 
side over the march of the most majestic planet or 
the fire of the mm t remote sun. 1 

The theological habit of interpreting the ‘catastrophes 
of nature as Divine warnings or punishments or disciplines 
la. a baseless and .'pernicious superstition. Physical 
science has given new directions to the currents of the 
imagination, supplied the judgment with new measures of 
probability and this affected "the whole circle of our 
beliefs. We are told of showers of rain that followed 
public prayer, but we are not told how often prayers 
for rain proved abortive, or how much longer then usual 
the dry weather had already continued, when they were 
offered. 

A perpetual interference of the Deity with the natur¬ 
al course of events is the earliest and simplest notion 
of miracles and this notion, which is implied in to many 
systems of belief, arose in part from an ignorance of the 
laws of nature and in part from an incapacity for induc¬ 
tive reasoning, which led men merely to collect facts 
coinciding with their preconceived opinions without attend¬ 
ing to those that were*”inconsistent with them. By this 
method there is no super sit 1 ti on that cannot be defended. 1 ' 

With regard to this: subject of miracles the conclu¬ 
sion that forces itself upon one ie: that the world of 
the first century was a supernatural world*end a means of 
evaluating a Religions Personality was by ascribing to him 
supernatural activities. There is evidened, if DarV Is 
the earliest and Matthew is dependent upon Dark, that 
some of the miracles of the Dew Testament show a develop¬ 
ment in a desire to enhance the Pro at JP r rt onellty which

what actually happened. In the field of Claesice the 
specialist does not attempt to suggest what actually 
ha opened . end the best that can be done in the Mew 
.testament field is to become so conversant with the 
first century world that the miraculous is the natural 
language of that world.
