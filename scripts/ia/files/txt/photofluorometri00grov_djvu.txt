HISTORICAL BA CKO-ROUND 

Early investigation of estrogenic substances was made 
difficult by the lack of a suitable method of assay. With 
the introduction of the vaginal smear assay procedure (1) a 
quantitative test for estrous-producing extracts became 
available. This made possible the rapid developments in sex 
endocrinology which followed. 

Workers were still hampered at this time by the absence 
of a cheap and easily available source of estrogens. Using 
the method of assay introduced by Allen and Doisy (1), Ascheim 
and Zondek (2) in 1927 provided this source by their discovery 
that the urine of pregnant women contained large amounts of 
active principle which was readily extractable with ether and 
other fat solvents. The fundamental importance of this dis¬ 
covery is strikingly shown by the fact that within three years 
extensive research culminated in the isolation of a crystalline 
estrogenic substance almost simultaneously by four different 
laboratories (3-6). Doisy, Veler and Thayer (3) found the 
qualitative physiological effects of their crystals to be 
indistinguishable from those of potent extracts of ovarian 
follicular fluid. Subsquently, other crystalline compounds 
exhibiting similiar characteristics have been isolated (7, 8). 

These discoveries gave further impetus to the development 
of other assay procedures and to investigation of the signif¬ 
icance of the various levels and forms of excretion of the 
estrogens in normal, pathological and pregnacy urines.

THE CHEMISTRY AND NOMENCLATURE OE TEE ESTROGENIC HORMONES 

An estrogenic substance is the generic name suggested 
for any material producing sexual excitement in the female of 
the lower animals (9). In the human, a number of chemically 
distinct and biologically active estrogenic substances have 
been isolated (3-8, 10-12) ♦ 

A variety of names were suggested for the estrogenic 
hormone to which Doisy et al (3) had originally affixed the 
root "Theel-”. To avoid confusion the Council on Pharmacy 
and Chemistry of the American Medical Association (13) in 1936 
made official the root n Estr-" which had been proposed earlier 
(14). A system of nomenclature is outlined below. 

In common with other members of the sex hormone family, 
bile acids, toad poisons and other steroids, the estrogens are 
derivatives of cyclopentanophenanthrene, a saturated 
tetracyclic hydrocarbon. The position of each carbon in the 
formula is numbered, as are the four rings, for convenience in 
descriptive nomenclature of the various derivatives of this 
compound. 














3 


The parent nucleus of the estrogenic hormones is a 
perhydro derivative of 13-methyl, cyclopentanophenanthrene in 
which ring A contains three unsaturated linkages. This nucleus 
was termed Estrane hy Adams et al (14) and chemically it is 
1, 3, 5- estratriene. 



The principle estrogen is alpha-estradiol which is also 
knovm as the "true or active" follicular hormone because for 
many years it was the only active compound isolated in 
crystalline form from the ovaries. The chemical name is 
1, 3, 5, - estratriene -3, 17 - trans diol. A stereoisomeric 
substance is known as beta-estradiol. Another name used to 
refer to alpha-estradiol is dihydrotheelin. 

The two hydroxyl groups constitute the only structural 
differences between estradiol and the other two well known 
estrogens, estrone and estriol. The former has only one 
hydroxyl group in position 3 and a keto group in position 17; 
the latter an additional hydroxyl group in position 16. Other 
common names by which these compounds are often designated, as 
well as their chemical terminology, are given in Chart One. 

Subsequent to 1930 many estrogenic products derived from 
mare’s urine have been made available commercially. Such pro¬ 
ducts consist either of pure, free estrone or of mixtures of 
free estrone and the other estrogens normally found in pregnant’s 
mare urine, principally equilin, equilenin, alpha-estradiol and

potassium estrone sulfate (10-12). 

Mieseher et al (15) , taking advantage of the alcoholic 
nature of the estrogens prepared numerous esters of estrone and 
estradiol. The sites of esterification are the hydroxyl groups, 
of which we have two in estradiol at the 5 and the 17 positions 
and in estrone at the 3 position only. It was found that the 
dipropionic acid ester and the mono-benzoic acid ester of 
estradiol greatly enhanced its physiological activities. The 
structural formulae of these compounds, together with their 
chemical terminology, are also illustrated in Chart One.

EXTRACTION OF THE ESTROGENS FROM URINE 

In common with other extraction processes involving 
biological materials, the preparation of estrogenic con¬ 
centrates consists of three main steps. The first step 
involves the conversion of the estrogens into a form in which 
they may be readily extracted. The second of these is the 
extraction of the hormone, or hormones, together with other 
lyosoluble substances and the removal of the bulk of the 
extraneous material from the extract. Thirdly, the resulting 
concentrate must be purified. 

Within recent years Marrian and collaborators (16, 17) 
have established that over ninety percent of the female sex 
hormones in human and equine pregnacy urines are excreted, 
not as the ether-soluble, highly active free hormones, but as 
water-soluble, ether-insoluble conjugates, relatively inert 
physiologically. Before a reliable estimation of the total 
estrogenic content can be obtained by biological assay, it is 
therefore necessary to subject urine to a form of hydrolytic 
treatment that will convert all the impotent conjugates into 
active free estrogens. Similarly, the isolation of the free 
estrogens in maximum yield for assay first requires the complete 
conversion of the combined forms into the ether-soluble free 
forms. 

Since Marrian (18) noted that there was a considerable 
increase in the yields of estrogenic hormones as a result of 
preliminary treatment with acid, efforts have been concentrated 
on determining the optimum conditions for hydrolysis. With few 
exceptions it is generally agreed that hydrochloric acid gives 
the most satisfactory recoveries ( 16, 17, 19, 20)., Smith et 
al (20) are of the opinion that boiling the urine for ten minutes

under a reflux condenser with fifteen percent hydrochloric 
acid satisfies all the criteria for efficient and complete 
hydrolysis. 

The extraction of estrogens from urine has been the 
subject of investigation by numerous workers (2-8, 10-12, 17, 
21-25). The estimation of the estrogenic substance present in 
urine necessitates its removal from relatively large amounts of 
fluid. This has, in general, been accomplished by subjecting 
the urine to a continuous extraction procedure with one of a 
large number of organic solvents using specially designed 
apparatus (23, 24). Some workers have attempted to shorten the 
extraction procedures by extraction of a concentrate, or of an 
aliquot, of the urine with various organic solvents in a 
separatory funnel (21, 25). One procedure is also outlined in 
the literature involving the precipitation of the estrogens, 
from their solution in the urine by the addition of sodium 
tungstate to form an insoluble complex with the substance being 
extracted (22). 

An essential factor in the extraction of any biological 
substance is to obtain that substance in a quantitative yield 
and in a form ready for assay. In the case of estrogens, the 
possibility of achieving these conditions, in most cases, 
involves the separation of this estrogenic material from other 
urinary steroids, particularly androgens. Smith and Smith (26) 
found that their initial benzene extract of urine, when assayed 
biologically, was not as active as the extract after further 
purification by the method of Cohen and Marrian (16). They 
attributed the lOY/er initial potency to the presence of estrogen 
inhibitors, persumably androgens, which were removed on 
purification.

Purification procedures have been developed involving 
fractionation between immiscible solvents (20, 21), chromato¬ 
graphy (27); by using specific chemical reactions of the 
estrogens (28, 29) to effect their removal from contaminants. 

The presence of interfering pigments effects seriously 
the colorimetric assay of estrogens (21, 25, 27). Various 
procedures have been devised in attempts to obtain colorless 
extracts and extracts free from compounds that will give the 
same colour reaction as the estrogen being investigated. 

Butyl alcohol (19, 27) has been recommended as an excellent 
medium for the extraction of estrogens, since urinary pigments 
are relatively insoluble in this liquid and are not extracted. 
Bachman and Petit (21) recommend washing the extract with 
dilute sulfuric acid to remove pigmented and chromogenic 
materials. Stimmel (27) has evolved a chromatographic method 
of purification involving the adsorption of estrogens on 
Alumina (Brockman)• The estrogens are subsequently removed with 
a benzene:methanol mixture, the chromogens and interfering 
substances being left behind in the adsorption column. 

TEE ASSAY OF ESTROGENIC H0RU0HES 
Investigation of urinary estrogenic extracts has contributed 
much to an understanding of the elaboration of these substances 
and their physiological functions in the organism. 

(1) Biological Assay Procedures 

Allen and Doisy (1) in 1923, first devised a satisfactory 
assay procedure for estrogens. This method was the vaginal 
smear techique and it is still one of the most widely used 
methods of assay for both natural and synthetic estrogens. 

The test is based on the findings that the vaginal epithelium

undergoes a characteristic desquamation during the height of 
the estrous cycle (30). Atropy of the ovaries or their removal 
by double ovariectomy will bring about the cessation of this 
phenomenon* The injection of sufficient estrogenic substance 
into the spayed female will cause the reappearance of the 
estrous cycle and once again the vaginal epithelium will 
become thickened and cornified. These cornified vaginal layers 
which appear desquamate in much the same manner as do the super¬ 
ficial cornified layers of the skin. Microscopical examination 
of a sample of vaginal fluid, removed by means of a loop of 
wire or a pipette introduced into the vagina, will show the 
presence of numerous, large, cornified, non-nucleated cells. 

The presence of these cells represents the estrous phase of 
the sexual cycle and serves as a positive criteria for the 
estrogenic activity of the substance injected. 

Numerous variations in the original procedure have been 
developed using either adult ovariectomized rats or mice ( 31- 
35) in attempts to eliminate variables and to increase the 
sensitivity of the test animal. 

Other biological assay techniques have been described in 
the literature which are dependent upon the effect of the 
estrogenic hormones on both primary and secondary sexual 
characteristics of the test animals (36-41). Of these the 
most commonly used is the technique involving the effect of 
estrogens on the uterine weight of the test animal (38). 

In the Allen and Doisy bioassay method (1) the potency of 
the estrogenic substance was expressed in units. This unit 
was defined as the minimum amount necessary to induce estrous 
with complete cornification of the vaginal mucosa, as judged

from a smear, in 75% of a large group of ovariectomized, 
sexually mature rats. Other workers established a unit based 
on the effect on the mouse (31). Efforts to correlate data 
of different investigators and attempts to find a constant 
factor for converting the rat unit to the mouse unit met repeated 
failure. Investigation has shown that the route by which the 
assayed substance was administered to the test animal, as well 
as the solvent, number of injections, the interval between 
injections and the sensitivity of the animal to the material, 
were all factors influencing the estrous response (42). 

A definite advance was made when the International Unit 
was introduced by the Conference on the Standardization of the 
Sex Hormones of the League of Nations Health Organization in 
1933 (43). The standard selected was 0.1 gamma of estrone 
which was to be considered as one unit. The assay of new 
estrogenic substance was to be carried out on some test animal, 
as the rat or mouse. The standard and the unknown were to be 
administered simultaneously and under identical conditions to 
two series of test animals and the strength of the unknown was 
to be expressed in terms of estrone. 

The International Conference stated that the International 
Unit was approximately one-third of the Allen and Doisy rat 
unit (1), but other workers have placed the value at from one- 
fifth to one-thirty-eighth of the rat unit (44). Investigators 
state that the variation in the rat unit or the mouse unit may 
be as great as 1,000 percent (31). 

An International Benzoate Unit has also been established, 
equivalent to 0.1 gamma of estradiol benzoate and is known as 


one Benzoate Unit

(2) Chemical Assay Methods 

Since the elucidation of the chemical structure of the 
estrogenic hormones, many attempts have been made to replace 
the biological assay of these hormones by a simple chemical 
method of estimation, 

Marrian (45) is of the opinion that the only important 
colorimetric reactions for the assay of urinary estrogens are 
those based on the Kober reaction (46)• 

Kober based his assay procedure on the observation that 
the green fluorescence resulting from the treatment of pure 
estrone with concentrated sulfuric acid was changed to red 
upon dilution with water. This red colour was intensified by 
the presence of phenol. He was able to compare these colours 
with standard solutions of cresol red and to determine the 
amount of estrogenic substance present. Kober observed that 
the colour developed with the pure substance could be completely 
removed by warming with three percent hydrogen peroxide. It 
was assumed, therefore, that any colour remaining was due to 
substances other than estrogens and this colour was subtracted 
from the maximum red value after making necessary volume 
corrections. This reaction is highly specific to the natural 
estrogens and, when carried out under certain conditions, pink 
colours of equal intensity are developed by estrone, estriol 
and estradiol. Improvements in the technique of carrying out 
the colour reactions have been made by Cohen and Marrian (17), 

Venning et al (19) and Bachman (47) amongst others. Various 
modifications in the composition of the reagent have also been 

made, the most important being the substitution of beta-napthoi 
for phenol (48).

The presence of the phenolic group in ring A of the 
estrogenic hormones and their resultant ability to be con¬ 
verted into azo dyes, has been made the basis of quantitative 
colorimetric reactions by some investigators (49-52). 

The diazo reaction of estriol was first noted by Harrington 
and Schupbach (49) who used para-nitroaniline with aqueous 
solutions. They obtained solutions having a yellow colour which 
wbs difficult to match and did not conform strictly to Beer’s 
Law. 

Schmulovitz and Wylie (50) showed that estrone could be 
estimated much more readily by coupling it with diazobenzene 
sulfonic acid to give an azo dye. Beta-napthol was used as 
the colour standard and comparison was made in a Duboscq 
colorimeter at the end of five minutes. A red colour which 
was found to be permanent for one hour was produced by the 
addition of sodium hydroxide. 

The diazo method of Talbot (51) involves the coupling of 
the phenolic hydroxyl with diazotized dianisidine. Talbot 
suggested the test as being specific for the weakly phenolic 
ketone, estrone." This claim was later investigated by 
Riefenstein and Dempsey (52) who found the method to be accurate 
within limits and substantiated that the procedure was satisfac¬ 
tory only for the estimation of estrone. 

Other reactions have also been described in the literature 
which are specific for one or more of the estrogenic hormones 
to be found in human urine. 

Veitch and Malone (53) prepared the 2, 4 -dinitrophenyl- 
hydrazone of estrone and the high tinctorial power of the 
resulting solution suggested its use for the quantitative

estimation of this estrogen. They found that the alcoholic 
solution exhibited maximum absorption in the ultra violet 
region at 440 mu which was out of the range of most photo¬ 
electric colorimeters and thus necessitated spectroscopic 
analjrsis. The method has not been adapted to the assay of 
biological extracts. 

David (54) has described the development of a blue 
colour resulting from the treatment of pure estriol crystals 
with concentrated sulfuric acid followed by arsenic acid. 

The test is specific for estriol, but Pineus et al (55) found 
that the test was only half as sensitive as the phenolsulfonic 
acid test (46) and could not be applied to the assay of estriol 
in urinary extracts because of the bluish cloudy suspension 
which formed. 

Bachman (47) has also described a specific colour reaction 
for estriol. The method consists of heating the estrogen at 
150° C. with sodium para-phenolsulfonate and phosphoric acid. 

A stable violet-pink colour is produced which is examined in the 
Evelyn photoelectric colorimeter. The reaction can be used to 
determine the amount of estriol in a mixture of estrone and 
estradiol. The pink colour is highly specific for estriol and 
the other estrogenic hormones give no evidence of the pink 
colour. 

Szego and Samuels (56) substituted guaiacolsulfonic acid 
for phenolsulfonic acid in the Kober reaction (46) and obtained 
a pink colour with estrone having a similiar intensity to that 
produced with phenolsulfonic acid. The claim is made that the 
results are more readily reproducible than with the Kober reagent 
and that, using the conditions specified, the reaction is specific 
for estrone.

An assay procedure described by Pincus et al (55) involves 
the reaction of benzoyl chloride with estrone in the presence 
of zinc chloride and glacial acetic acid* In this method a new 
curve must be prepared for every determination, but sensitivity 
is claimed to be equal to that of the phenolsulfonic acid pro- 
cedure (46). 

Every colorimetric procedure appears to lack specificity 
when adapted to the assay of urinary extracts.(45) . Attempts 
to assay pregnacy urine utilizing the Kober (46) reaction have 
given readings as great as four times the amount of hormone 
actually present* This is due to non-specific materials which 
also give a colour change with this test (19) . Cohen and 
Marrian (16), on the other hand, state that the test is not 
applicable to the urine of non-pregnant individuals. The methods 
of Stimmel (27) and of Bachman and Petit (21) are fairly satisfac¬ 
tory for excretions of one to three milligrams daily. In the 
absence of pregnacy, however, the average daily excretion is less 
than 100 micrograms daily (57). 

Priedgood and Garst (58) have applied ultraviolet absorption 
to the assay of minute amounts of estrogenic hormones, and others 
(59) have developed a polarographic technique. However, in 
these procedures, also, difficulty has been encountered in 
application to the assay of urinary extracts. 

More recently Jailer (60, 61) has reported the successful 
assay of non-pregnant urines by fluorescence. The extraction 
procedure of Bachman and Petit (21) is used to obtain the con¬ 
centrates and the non-specific fluorescence is corrected for by 
means of an equation similiar to that employed by Stimmel (27).

described fluorescent techniques for the estimation of 
estrogens# The former workers have used phosphoric acid to 
develope fluorescence while the latter have employed sulfuric 
acid. Neither of these procedures have been adapted to the 
estimation of the estrogenic content of urinary extracts. 




THE PROBLEM 




17 


THE PHOTOELUOROMETRIC ESTIMATION OF ESTROGENS AND ANDROGENS 

In the colorimetric assay technique of Kober (48) the 
addition of sulfuric acid to estrone causes a green fluorescence 
to be produced. Prior to the commencement of our examination 
very little attention had been paid to this fluorescence, Sala 
(64) had previously employed this phenomenon as a qualitative 
test for pregnacy, and Cuboni (65) to determine the presence of 
estrone in the urine of pregnant mares. However, during the 
time we have been conducting our investigation, several papers 
have been published (60=63) involving the quantitative analysis 
of the estrogens by fluorescent estimation. The preliminary 
reports of two of these were so vague as to be impossible to 
check and it was necessary to wait until detailed reports were 
forthcoming to be able to evaluate them. We have been able, 
however, in the light of information received from these reports, 
to make improvements in our earlier procedures. 

The purpose of our investigation was to attempt the control 
of this fluorescence in such a manner as to develop a quantitative 
assay technique. We hoped by so doing to devise a procedure 
which would have advantages over the existing methods of assay 
for estrogens as regards sensitivity, accuracy, simplicity, and 
specificity, 

The similiar chemical nature of the androgens suggested 
the possibility that fluorescence might also be produced by 
these compounds which could be adapted for assay procedures.

COLEMAN PHOTOFLUOROMETER 
MODEL 12

APPARATUS 

The apparatus employed for our determinations was the 
Coleman Photofluorometer, Model 12 (Figure 1), The extreme 
fluctuations in the line voltage supplied to our laboratory, 
and the resultant effect on lamp sensitivity, caused us to 
employ a Variac so as to be able to note these voltage changes 
and thus make the necessary adjustments. For the Model 12 
Photofluorometer the Variac is set to read 115 volts. 

Before running any tests with this instrument it is 
essential that both its mercury vapor lamp and electronic 
amplifier reach equilibrium. The procedure for the attainment 
of equilibrium is as follows: 

1. Insert in panel opening number one, the proper filter for 
the fluorescent measurement involved. 

2. In panel opening number two, insert the corresponding 

filter to match filter number one. 

3. Energize the instrument by rotating the R STD !t knob clock¬ 
wise until it just clicks which turns on the amplifier 
and also starts the fan and excites the mercury vapor 
lamp. 

4. After thirty seconds, continue rotation of the !T STD tf knob 
to the extreme clockwise position, thus adjusting the 
amplifier to the condition of maximum sensitivity. 

5. Depress the button Tt B ft and, while in the depressed position, 
adjust knob tf BAL n until the Instrument reads zero. The 
purpose of this adjustment is to balance the electronic 
amplifier to the condition of the ”A ?t batteries. 

6. Adjust the "BLK" (blank) knob until the instrument jpeter 
reads zero. This knob serves to balance the amplifier to

so 


zero and may subsquently be used to correct for the 
fluorescence of blanks during the actual analysis of 
fluorescent samples* 

7. Allow at least ten minutes for the instrument to 
stabilize. 

8. After stability is attained, repeat adjustment 5 and 
then 6. 

It is then necessary to adjust the amplifier sensitivity. 
The instrument sensitivity is dependent, in part, on the inten¬ 
sity of the mercury vapor lamp, which in turn depends on the 
voltage and frequency of the current supply. Since these latter 
factors may vary, we have found that it is essential to check 
the sensitivity of the Electronic Photofluorometer immediately 
before each test, by inserting in the instrument a cuvette 
containing a standard reference solution. The Tt STD ff knob may 
then be adjusted until the meter reads a value selected as 
representing the proper sensitivity of the lamp for the deter¬ 
mination under consideration. 

Eor the actual calibration of the instrument or the deter¬ 
mination of an unknown quantity of fluorescent material the pro¬ 
cedure is as follows: 

1. Complete adjustments 1 through 8 as previously outlined. 

2. Place the cuvette of standard reference solution in the 
cuvette well, cover with the cap, and then open the lamp 
shutter by fully depressing button ,f P !t . With tT P 1f fully 
depressed, adjust the n STD tT knob until the meter reads a 
value consistent with the concentration of the sample to 
be determined. 

3. Insert a cuvette containing the Tt blank n solution, cover, 
again depress button ”P Tt and with f, P tT again fully depressed 
adjust the meter to read zero.

4. Next insert a cuvette containing a solution of the 

material to be tested, cover, fully depress button rT P" 

and note the reading. 

The adjustment of the sensitivity by means of the 
standard reference solution must be repeated before every 
determination. However, this adjustment with the "STD" knob 
must not be made again until the "BLK" knob has been returned 
to its original position; that is, with the meter reading zero 
when "P" is in the released position with the light shutter 
closed. 

The extreme sensitivity of this apparatus demands a 
constant examination of the mercury vapor lamp, amplifier tube 
and the batteries to maintain the instrument operating at the 
peak of efficiency. All these parts should be examined 
periodically for signs of failure. Any deficiency in these 
parts affects the readings and falsifies results. 

SELECTION CF THE FILTERS 

In photometric analysis a filter is used to isolate as 
narrow a band of light as is feasible, and this band must be 
centered as closeljr as possible to the point of minimum trans- 
mittancy of the sample. 

"With the Electronic Photofluorometer it is necessary to 
use two filters. The first of these filters, either B-l or B-2 
is placed between the mercury vapor lamp and the cuvette 
containing the reaction mixture. These two filters pass dif¬ 
ferent light bands, permitting the rays to strike the cuvette 
when "P" is depressed. Filter B-l passes the 365 mu band and 
filter B-2 the 436 mu band of mercury. 

The second filter is placed between the cuvette and the 
phototube. The purpose of this second filter is to screen

out the rays from the wave band passed by the corresponding 
primary filter, while allowing the fluorescent rays from the 
sample to enter the phototube and be measured. With primary 
filter B-l the manufacturers suggest using secondary filter 
PC-1 and with filter B-2, secondary filter PC-2. 

Preliminary experiments with the filters showed that a 
much greater sensitivity, with our solutions, was obtained 
with the B-l, PC-1 combination than with the B-2, PC-2 com¬ 
bination, These filters were therefore used throughout. This 
combination was also used by Bates and Cohen (63) in their 
procedure for the fluorescent analysis of estrogenic hormones. 

Jailer (60,64) has since reported the use of still another 
secondary filter PC-9A, This filter was used in combination 
with both B-l and B-2 primary filters, A report on our findings 
with these filter combinations will be presented later in this 
paper • 

THE STANDARD REFERENCE SOLUTION 
Por the purpose of a standard reference solution we 
selected a solution of quinine sulfate in dilute sulfuric acid 
as recommended by the Coleman Company. This solution had 
previously been used in the fluorometric analysis of thiamin 
solutions and was recommended because of its photochemical 
stability. 

Investigation of different strength solutions of quinine 
sulfate in sulfuric acid caused us to select a strength of 0.1 
microgram per millilitre of quinine sulfate in 0.1 N sulfuric 
acid. Selection of this strength was made as follows: 

One milligram of quinine sulfate was dissolved in 100 
millilitres of 0.1 N sulfuric acid. Various dilutions of this

solution were made in 0.1 N sulfuric acid and examined in the 
instrument. The strength selected was the one enabling the 
"STD" knob to be rotated so as to make the meter read 100. 

With stronger concentrations it was found impossible to adjust 
the reading to 100 or below, as the fluorescent intensity was 
too great. 

One milligram of quinine sulfate is dissolved in 100 
millilitres of 0.1 N sulfuric acid and stored under refrig¬ 
eration. One millilitre of this solution is diluted to 100 
millilitres in a volumetric flask with 0.1 N sulfuric acid. 

This dilution is prepared fresh daily as it has been noticed 
that the weaker solution has a tendency to decrease in 
fluorescent intensity if allowed to stand over several days. 
Sight millilitre aliquots of this latter solution are used for 
standardization. 

TEE " BLANK " 

The solvent and other chemicals used for preparing the 
reaction mixture exhibit some fluorescence in themselves and 
the activity of these "blank" constitutents must be considered 
in all measurements made. 

The "blank" solution is prepared by combining in the same 
manner and amounts all the ingredients of the corresponding 

sample solution except the estrogen. 

With the Electronic Photofluorometer the "blank" reading 

is subtracted electrically by inserting a cuvette of this 
solution, depressing "P" and then adjusting the "BLK" knob until 
the meter reads zero. When the corresponding sample is then 
inserted and "P" again depressed, the reading obtained is due 
to the fluorescence produced by the estrogen being examined.

REAC-ENTS AND EQUIPMENT 

95$ sulfuric acid C.P. (British Drug Houses) was employed 
in all our determinations. All other solvents employed in our 
determinations were either redistilled or were of unquestionable 
purity. The only solvent we believed to be in the latter 
classification was anaesthetic ether, which was employed in 
extraction procedures. 

All solutions were prepared using volumetric apparatus; 
and micro-burettes were employed for minute measurements. No 
stop-cock lubricant was used since it might give rise to 
extraneous fluorescence.

EXPERIMENTAL 





25 


SECTION ONE 

The development of any analytical procedure requires 
an investigation and standardization of any variables which 
effect the reaction. Our initial investigation, therefore, 
was aimed at a determination of the variables which might be 
involved in the production of the fluorescence. 

Nor our experimental work we selected crystalline estrone 
as the test material. For test purposes we initially made up 
a solution of 10 milligrams of crystalline estrone in 100 
millilitres of 95% ethenol. Various aliquots and dilutions of 
this solution were employed in the different procedures under¬ 
taken . 

We have expressed the concentrations of the several 
estrogenic solutions tested in terms of micrograms of the act¬ 
ive substance being investigated. This procedure has been 
employed in all tables, graphs and charts. 

The readings designated refer to readings of the galvan¬ 
ometer and are not meant to imply any special unitage. A 
reading of 100 indicates that the reading obtained was beyond 
the galvanometer range • 

In Table One we have presented the results of our 
investigation to find the approximate range over which estrone 
would display fluorescence. This investigation was performed 
by adding one millilitre of 95% sulfuric acid to the estrone 
contained in one millilitre of 95% ethanol and diluting the 
mixture with 95% ethanol to provide the eight millilitres 
necessary for measurement. The resultant solution was tested 
for fluorescence immediately. 

From this table it is evident that the range which might

be determined with the Electronic Photofluorometer would 
appear to be from 25 micrograms to 75 micrograms. The extreme 
variation and lack of consistency of readings indicated that 
the production of the fluorescence would require careful 
control to achieve uniformity of results.

Since it was thought possible that part of the variation 
might be due to the strength of acid employed 5 several dilutions 
were tested using the same procedure. The results are recorded 
in Table Two.

not overcome the variances obtained previously with concentrated

sulfuric acid, an interesting fact was revealed by this 
series of tests. This was the increase in the intensity of 
fluorescence produced by the use of the weaker acid. In our 
initial investigation concentrations of 30 micrograms gave a 
reading of 43 as their maximum, whereas in this series the 
same concentration gave readings of 100 in every instance. 
Evidence of this increased sensitivity was also shown in that 
we were now able to obtain results with concentrations as low 
as two micrograms. 

As the use of weaker acid solutions did not achieve uniform 
results we decided to employ several other solvents in place 
of 95%> ethanol. Accordingly, 10 milligram percent solutions 
of estrone were made up in n-butanol, ether, and absolute 
ethanol. The estrone contained in seven millilitres of the 
solvent being investigated was added to one millilitre of the 
acid and tested for fluorescence immediately. In some cases 
the acid was diluted with water, in others with the solvent 
being investigated. 

In Table Three are recorded the results obtained with the 
three different solvents as well as the results where the 
solvent had been evaporated off leaving the dried estrone 
residue• 

When the sulfuric acid was added in aqueous dilution to 
the estrone dissolved in n-butanol the immiscibility of the 
two liquids produced a cloudiness which reduced the intensity. 
When the acid was added-diluted with n-butanol the 0.2%> gave 
a range of only 9 on the galvanometer for 10 micrograms to 
300 micrograms of estrone. The 1% gave a wider range but 
agreement and uniformity were poor. The sensitivity with

ether was very poor, requiring 100 to 200 micrograms to 
produce a significant reading. With absolute ethanol there 
was some improvement in relation of degree of fluorescence 
to amount of estrone. When 95$ sulfuric acid was added to 
aliquots of dried estrone all the readings were above 100« 

The high sensitivity when concentrated sulfuric acid 
was added to dried estrone suggested the possibility that a 
smaller amount of acid might give an amount of fluorescence 
within the range of the galvanometer. Table Four shows the 
results obtained when 1 to 8 millilitres of 95$ sulfuric 
acid were added to 100 micrograms of estrone. V?here necessary 
the solution was diluted to eight millilitres with absolute 
ethanol.

Table Five presents the results obtained when one millilitre 
of 95 fo acid was added to different quantities of dried estrone. 

In each case dilution to eight millilitres was made with absolute 
ethanol. Since this technique appeared to hold promise, further 
work was undertaken using the procedure of adding acid to dried 
estrone. Estrone was dissolved in absolute ethanol and aliquots 
evaporated to dryness. 

The addition of the absolute ethanol to the sulfuric acid 
produced an elevated temperature. Our practice had been to 
test this solution for fluorescence without delay on completion 
of mixing. During the course of our investigations, however, 
evidence had been accumulating as to the effect of heat on the 
final reading obtained. As the solution cooled to room tem¬ 
perature the intensity of fluorescence appeared to decrease to 
a certain point where the readings would remain constant. It 
was thought possible that the variance in the readings might be

due to differences in temperature at the time readings were 
made. Table Six shows that marked variations are to be noted 
above 27° C., but that below that temperature readings were 
consistent. As a result we have since employed the practice of

cooling the reaction mixture under the cold water tap to 25° C* 

An investigation of the time required for the reaction to 
go to completion showed that with concentrations of estrone 
from 5 micrograms to 80 micrograms the readings could be in¬ 
creased to 100~*~ by allowing the estrone to stand for thirty 
minutes in the presence of one millilitre of 95$ sulfuric acid 
before adding the absolute ethanol to eight millilitres. From 
this series of results we were inclined to believe that perhaps 
some of our former discrepancies had been due to incomplete 
development of the fluorescence. By referring to Table Five it 
may be seen that with a concentration of 70 micrograms, for 
example, the readings obtained varied from 60 to 93, It was 
thought that this extreme variance could have been caused by 
different periods of time elapsing before the mixture was tested 
for fluorescence. However, in Table Six where we have recorded 
the effects of the temperature of the reaction mixture on the 
reading, we obtained good agreement of results in the two series 
investigated. These series of readings were obtained, however, 
by allowing the reaction mixture to cool slowly to the temperature 
stated. It seemed possible that the period of time elapsing 
between the first and last reading had helped to contribute to 
the reproducibility obtainedo 

The increase in fluorescent intensity on standing prompted 
an attempt to use heat to bring the reaction to completion more 
quickly. A temperature of 120° C. was arbitrarily chosen and 
using the same concentration range as above, the samples were 
heated in an oil bath with occasional agitation. All concentra¬ 
tions tested gave a reading of 100*. 

An attempt was made to dilute the solutions to a point where

the intensity would be within the range of the galvanometero 
Dilution of the mixture to 100 millilitres with distilled 
water produced a suitable intensity and the results obtained 
with the several different series were fairly uniform, ( Table 
Seven) 

Utilizing this dilution, a closer investigation of the re¬ 
action temperature, the time required for the completion of 
reaction, and the effect of agitation during the heating period 
was conducted* Results showed (Tables light and Nine) that our 
selection of 120° C* for a period of twenty minutes as reaction 
temperature and time had been fortunate as these appeared to be 
suitable for complete reaction. Shorter reaction periods or 
lower temperatures decreased the intensity of fluorescence while 
higher temperatures or longer periods for reaction did not have 
the effect of producing a greater intensity. Continuous agitation 
during the heating period appeared to increase slightly the 
results obtained and to contribute to reproducibility. 

The apparatus used for agitation purposes consisted of a 
wire basket in which the reaction tubes were set immersed in an 
oil bath. This basket was moved gently back and forth by means 
of a wire attachment to an eccentric arm of an electric motor. 

From the foregoing investigations a procedure was developed 
for the assay of estrone, and also applied to the assay of 
estradiol and estradiol benzoate. 

Technique One 

An aliquot of an alcoholic solution of estrone is evaporated 
to dryness in vacuo on a boiling water bath. One millilitre of 
95$ sulfuric acid is added and the mixture is heated at 120° C. 
for twenty minutes with agitation. The mixture is cooled

immediately under the cold water tap to a temperature of 25°C. 
or lower and diluted to 100 millilitres with distilled water 
in a volumetric flask. An aliquot of this solution, consisting 
of at least eight millilitres, is tested for fluorescence. A 
blank is run with all determinations; and a reference standard 
of 0.001 milligrams % quinine sulfate in 0.1 N sulfuric acid is 
employed. The "STD" knob is set at 100 using this standard 
reference solution immediately preceeding every determination 0 

For reaction tubes we employed Pyrex test tubes with a 
diameter of 25 mm. and approximately 8 to 10 cms. in height® 

The hormone solution was evaporated to dryness in these test 
tubes and the 95% sulfuric acid was added directly to the dried 
residue and then heated. 

In Tables Ten to Twelve we have shown the results of a 
series of determinations carried out with estrone, estradiol 
and estradiol benzoate utilizing the procedure outlined. 

Plotting the results of intensity of fluorescence against con¬ 
centration we were able to show that a linear relationship 
existed between these two (Graph One) . The curve obtained with 
estradiol does not quite split the axis at zero; the point of 
intersection is such that a concentration of two micrograms 
would give a reading of zero. Estrone and estradiol benzoate, 
however, folio?/ Beer ? s Law. 

The intensity of fluorescence produced by estradiol is 
approximately 12% less than that shov/n by estrone. Estradiol 
benzoate in turn shows approximately 31% less fluorescence 
than estradiol. The calculations are computed at a concentration 
of 50 micrograms of the hormones. With estrone a range of 10 
to 65 micrograms was covered, whereas with estradiol and

estradiol benzoate the ranges which could be determined were 
10 to 70 micrograms and 10 to 100 micrograms respectively. 

■While the sensitivity and accuracy of this method were 
not quite as satisfactory as one would like, this technique 
served to demonstrate that the fluorescence produced by 
estrogens in the presence of sulfuric acid could be controlled 
in such a manner as to provide a means of quantitative assay. 

PROGESTERONE AND THE ANDRCGMG 

The similiarity in chemical structure of the progesterone 
group of hormones and of the male sex hormones to that of the 
estrogenic hormones suggested the possibility of utilizing the 
above procedure for the estimation of these compounds. These 
substances are also derivatives of cyclopentanophenanthrene 
as are the estrogenic hormones ( Chart Two ). 

Progesterone 

Progesterone gave approximately the same readings as those 
obtained with similiar concentrations of crystalline estrone. 
However, several factors made us doubt that these readings were 
entirely reliable. Fluorescence did not appear on the addition 
of the 95 % sulfuric acid to the progesterone but after heating 
for twenty minutes at 120° C, a brown colouration appeared. The 
fluorescence produced, by estrone and estradiol was a clear 
bright yellow whereas with progesterone the colour exhibited 
showed every evidence of being caused by charring. The readings 
obtained with equal concentrations showed no similarity and we 
therefore concluded that the procedure was of no value for the 
assay of progesterone ( Table Thirteen ).

An insufficient supply of crystalline testosterone forced 
us to employ androsterone for further investigations of the 
androgenic hormones. Following the procedure as previously 

outlined -we again obtained very irregular results. 

As it was apparent that the method developed for estrogens 
was not suitable for androgens, an investigation of the variables 
as they apply to androsterone was undertaken. One complication

in the case of androsterone was its volatility (69) 

In Tables Fifteen to Eighteen, we have compiled the results 
of a series of experiments undertaken to determine the effect 
on the developed fluorescence of drying in vacuo, the heating 
period and the amount of acid. From these investigations the 
following observations were made. 

1 . The evaporation in vacuo on a boiling water bath of an 
alcoholic solution of androsterone resulted in readings 
which varied greatly from series to series for results 
run in duplicate. The evaporation for longer periods 
than the fifteen minutes which had been employed for the 
estrogens did not overcome this variance. The evaporation 
in vacuo at a lower temperature ( 75°C) gave much better 
reproducibility. 

2. Heating at a lower temperature during the reaction period 
produced better agreement between the results run in 

duplicate but these results could not be reproduced in a 
second series, 

3. Allowing the reaction to go to completion without the aid 
of heat and not evaporating the alcoholic solution to 
dryness produced fluorescence of similiar intensity in 
equal concentrations. 

4 . The readings obtained with solutions allowed to stand in 
the dark were not markedly different from the readings 
Obtained with solutions allowed to react in daylight. 

5. The addition of one millilitre of 95% sulfuric acid to an 
alcoholic solution of androsterone produced similiar 
readings with several different concentrations ruling out 
the possibility of a linear relationship existing between 
intensity and concentration v/hen this technique was

employed. 

6 . The addition of an amount of acid equal to the volume of 

alcoholic solution of androsterone being examined improved 
sensitivity. 

From these observations we were able to develop the following 
procedure which was used to determine the concentrations of 
androsterone, dehydroandrosterone and dehydroandrosterone acetate 
in solution in absolute ethanol. 

To an aliquot of an alcoholic solution of androgenic hormone 
is added an equal volume of 95% sulfuric acid. The two solutions 
are thoroughly mixed and allowed to react in a stoppered eon- 
tainer for fifteen minutes. The mixture is then diluted to fifty 
millilitres with distilled water, cooled to 25° C. and an aliquot 
of this solution is tested for fluorescence. A "blank" is run 
with all determinations. The standard reference solution is the 
same as for the determinations of the estrogens. 

For investigational purposes we used a solution of 25 
milligrams of androsterone, 25 milligrams of dehydroandrosterone 
and 25 milligrams of dehydroandrosterone acetate in one hundred 
millilitres of absolute ethanol. 

The sensitivity with this method is much less than that 
obtained for estrogens although the reproducibility of results 
is better. A summary of these results has been given in Table 
Nineteen, and presented graphically in Graph Two. 

Since the greater sensitivity of the estrogens indicated 
that they were more suitable for assay by fluorescent means, 
work was discontinued on the androgens and progesterone.

SECTION TWO 

Jailer (60) in a preliminary paper reported a method for 
the fluorometric estimation of the estrogenic hormones using 
60% sulfuric acid and a heating period of five minutes. The 
reported sensitivity of this method was greater that the 
procedure developed in our laboratory and was considered worthy 
of investigation. Our inital examination of this method was 
hampered by the scarity of details provided by Jailer (60) but 
the later appearance of a more detailed account (61) permitted 
a more thorough examination. 

Jailer (61) claimed, in his investigation, to have develop¬ 
ed a method whereby he could determine a concentration as low 
as 0.1 microgram of estrone and estradiol and as low as 0.5 
microgram of estriol. The maximum concentrations giving a 
reading which was within the range of the galvanometer was 0.3 
micrograms in the case of the first two estrogens and 3.0 
micrograms in the case of the latter. 

The intensity of fluorescence was determined in a Coleman 
Photofluorometer, Model 13 using B-3, PC-9A filter combination. 
The fluorescence in biological extracts was read by Jailer at 
two different wave lengths, 436 mu (B-3 filter) and 365 mu (B-l 
filter). The non-specific fluorescence of the reagent blanks 
and other non-estrogenic substances was found to be similiar at 
the two wave-lengths while that of the estrogens was quite 
specific at 436 mu. Thus, by reading the solutions with the 
two filters the blank fluorescence could be deducted. 

Attempts to reproduce the results obtained by Jailer with 
this method were unsuccessful. As shown in Table Twenty it was 
necessary to employ a concentration of 0.0130 micrograms of

estrone to obtain a reading within the range of our galvan¬ 
ometer • 

Plotting the results of these readings graphically showed 
that a linear relationship did not exist between intensity of 
fluorescence and concentration of estrone, Extrapolation of 
the curve to the axis showed that the point of intersection 
was at a galvanometer reading of approximately 42 which 
would appear to indicate zero concentration of hormone was 
still showing a reading of 42. 

In his report on this method Jailer made no mention of 
the use of a standard reference solution. Accordingly, in our 
attempts to reproduce his results we did not employ such a 
solution. However, we felt that by employing a standard ref¬ 
erence to reduce the lamp intensity, results more nearly 
approaching those reported by this worker might be obtained. 
Our first attempt v/as to adjust the tf STD n knob to a galvan¬ 
ometer reading of 100 using a standard reference solution of 
.0.001 milligrams percent quinine sulfate in 0.1 N sulfuric 
acid which had been succesfully employed in our initial pro¬ 
cedure. To accomplish this we were forced to adjust the ,f STD f? 
knob using the B-l, PC-1 filter pair. Using the B-2, PC-9A 
combination the deflection of the galvanometer was so great 
that no adjustment to 100 could be made. With the B-l, PC-9A 
combination the reading was extremely low and could not be 
adjusted satisfactorly. While the results obtained in this 
instance were somewhat lower than those shown with the same 
concentrations by the first method the results did not agree 
with those reported by Jailer (Table Twenty). 

Our next attempt to reproduce Jailer’s results was to 
reduce the lamp intensity to its minimum point. This was

accomplished by rotating the Tt STD Tr knob as far as possible 
without shutting off the Photofluorometer. This procedure 
enabled us to obtain readings over a concentration range of 
0.01 to 0.04 micrograms of estrone which is one-fiftieth the 
concentration examined by Jailer ( Table Twenty-two ). 

In this instance also we were unable to plot intensity 
against concentration in such a manner that the curve obtained 
would split the axis at zero. With this curve, extrapolation 
showed a reading of 26 with zero concentration of estrone. 

We have, therefore, been unable to reproduce the results 
obtained by Jailer. 

Technique Two 

The high sensitivity of Jailer’s method indicated the 
possibility that our original procedure (Technique One) 
might be improved. 

Further investigation of our procedure showed that results 
within galvanometer range were obtainable using one-tenth the 
original concentration if the mixture was diluted to ten 
millilitres instead of the one hundred millilitres previously 
employed. The effect of the amount of acid was also further 
tested; and an examination of the time required to complete 
the reaction was made. 

The filter combination, was the same as in our initial 
investigations and the same strength standard reference 
solution was used. Attempts to use other filter combinations, 
such as that used by Jailer, failed to give satisfactory re¬ 
sults. The B-l, PC-9A pair gave readings with the ’’blank” 

far beyond the range of the galvanometer and made adjustment 
to a reading of zero impossible. The readings obtained with 
other filter combinations gave lower values than those obtained

in intensity resulting when three millilitres of acid were 
employed in place of the one millilitre previously utilized 
(Table Twenty-Four). Four millilitres of acid increased 
the intensity but decreased the reproducibility. Three 
millilitres of acid was thus selected as a suitable volume 
to be added to the reaction mixture.

In view of the smaller concentrations of estrogens 
involved in these assays the question arose as to the 
necessity of still employing a reaction temperature of 12Q°C. 
As shown by Table Twenty-six, however, better reproducibility 
and greater intensity were obtained at this temperature than 
at higher or lower temperatures. The reproducibility of 
results at 98°C. was still quite satisfactory but the in¬ 
tensity of fluorescence was approximately forty percent less 
than that resulting when a temperature of 120°C. was employed.

Finklestein et al (62) have reported that water has an

during the period of reaction decreased sensitivity and re¬ 
producibility (Table Twenty-seven)• We continued, therefore, 
to evaporate an aliquot of the estrogen solution to dryness 
in vacuo before adding the acid. 

From the results obtained in these investigations the 
following procedure was developed which was considerably more

sensitive than Technique One. 

Technique Two 

An aliquot of a one milligram percent solution of the 
estrogen in ethanol is evaporated to dryness in vacuo on a 
boiling water bath. Three millilitres of concentrated 
sulfuric acid are added and the mixture is heated with 
agitation for five minutes at 120°C. The tube is removed 
and cooled immediately under cold water. Five millilitres 
of distilled water are added and the mixture is again cooled 
under the cold water tap to 25°C. 

A "blank" is run with all determinations and a standard 
reference solution of 0.001 milligrams percent quinine sulfate 
in 0.1 N sulfuric acid is used to adjust the lamp intensity. 

The "STD" knob is adjusted to give a galvanometer reading of 
100 with this solution. 

The addition of the distilled water to the sulfuric acid 
must be performed cautiously to avoid splattering. We found 
it satisfactory to add the vrater from a burrette along the 
side of the tube so as to form a layer of water on top of the 
acid. The solution was then mixed carefully with a fine glass 
stirring rod. 

Table Twenty-eight presents the results obtained with 
estrone and estradiol using Technique Two. It can be noted 
from these tables that this method is ten times more sensitive 
for estrone and two times more sensitive for estradiol than 
Technique One. In Technique One, we were forced to employ 
concentrations of from 10 to 65 micrograms of estrone and 10 
to 70 micrograms of estradiol to cover the complete galvan¬ 
ometer scale. In Technique Two, 1 to 10 micrograms of estrone 
and 1 to 3.5 micrograms of estradiol are all that are necessary.

Graph Three shows the results when intensity is plotted 
against concentration for these two estrogens. It will be 
noted that estrone obeys Beer’s Law; but with estradiol the 
point of intersection is such that a concentration of 0.6 
micrograms would not exhibit fluorescence. 

Phosphoric Acid 

Finklestein et al (62) reported the use of phosphoric 
acid to produce fluorescence of the estrogens. For their 
procedure a Lumetron colorimeter fitted with attachments to 
convert the apparatus to a photofluorometer had been employed. 
Two millilitres of the phosphoric acid solution were used. 
Since the Coleman Photofluorometer requires an eight mill¬ 
ilitre aliquot for final analysis we were unable to duplicate 
this procedure exactly. However, a comparison of the relative 
intensities of fluorescence developed by phosphoric and 
sulfuric acids showed the latter to be superior (Table Twenty- 
Nine) .

SECTION TKRBh 
Assay of Urinary Extracts 

In the Kober reaction (46) and its modifications (17, 

18) difficulty has been encountered in assaying urinary 
extracts of estrogens due to the presence of interfering 
pigmentso The pink colour produced by the.phenolsulfonic 
acid reagent on reaction with the estrogens is obscured by 
brownish pigments present in pregnacy urine. The resulting 
effect is an overestimation of the estrogen content * Various 
modifications (17, 19, 47) of this test have been proposed 
to overcome the effect of this brown colour, either by removal 
of the brown pigmentation or by attempts to correct for it® 
Bachman and Petit (21) and Talbot (47) have expressed doubt 
as to the rationale of using correction equations« 

Bachman and Petit (21) have stated that assay procedures 
based on the kober reaction are inapplicable to non-pregnant 
urines® For non-pregnant urines Friedgood and G-arst (58) have 
used ultra-violet absorption while Jailer (60, 61) has applied 
fluorometric techniques® 

It was hoped that some of the disadvantages of other 
chemical tests could be overcome by the application of our 
fluorometric procedures to the assay of urinary extracts® 

Since the important factor in estrogenic tests is the biolog¬ 
ical potency, it is necessary to correlate all chemical tests 
with biological activity. For this reason urine from the 
same normal male was extracted and assayed biologically as 
well as by fluorescent means® 

Assays were performed on twenty-four hour samples of male 
urine® No attempt was made to estimate separately the amounts

of the various estrogens present in the extract. Extractions 
were performed so as to maintain the total estrogen content 
of the extract while removing the androgens and other con¬ 
taminants by various means. In the procedures where a sep¬ 
aration of the estrogen into specific entities arose as a 
part of the technique, the separate portions were combined 
and assayed together. The results obtained were expressed in 
terms of estrone. 

Collection of Samples 

No preservative was employed and the samples were kept 
under refrigeration.until the extraction could be performed. 
Extraction of the Urine 

Our initial extraction procedure was that employed by 
Leiboff and Tamis (24). This method had previously been 
found satisfactory in this laboratory for the extraction of 
estrogens (66). The procedure is a continuous one employing 
chloroform as the extraction medium. 

Preliminary hydrolysis of the urine is performed by 
adding fifty millilitres of concentrated hydrochloric acid to 
a five hundred millilitre aliquot of twenty-four urine and 
evaporating the mixture to one-third its original volume by

overflow tube, C, leads to an Erlenmeyer flask, D, which 
serves as the collection vessel® 

The hydrolyzed urine is poured into A and forms a layer 
above the chloroform already present. More chloroform is 
then slowly added to A until chloroform is seen to pass 
through tube C into flask D. Enough chloroform is then added 
to give a volume of about twenty-five millilitres in flask D. 

The condenser E is then set in place and both the ex¬ 
traction chamber, A, and collection vessel, D, are gently 
heated, causing the chloroform to boil gently but steadily. 

When the chloroform in A boils it rises partly up into 
the urine and drops back again. When the temperature of the 
urine is elevated to that of the boiling chloroform, the 
chloroform will bubble vigorously through the urine, vaporize, 
and be liquified by the condenser. 

While this is proceeding the chloroform in flask D is 
vigorously heated and evaporates through the arm E and is 
liquified by the condenser. The increased volume causes the 
chloroform to rise in tube C and spill over into the flask® 

Leiboff and Tamis (24) have reported that a two hour ex¬ 
traction period is sufficient to extract all the chloroform 
soluble material and to concentrate it in flask D* We 
modified the procedure in that we extracted for a three hour 
period and added the chloroform fraction from flask A to that 
from D. This was to insure complete extraction(66)o 

For the purposes of biological assay five millilitres of 
sesame oil were add.ed to the chloroform extract. The solution 
was then heated in vacuo on a boiling water bath to remove the 


chloroform

Biological Assay 

Although a number of biological methods have been 
described (33-41), the rat vaginal smear method of Allen 
and Doisy (1), is highly satisfactory for the assay of 
estrogens and was employed by us throughout* 

Young female rats were spayed and smears taken one week • 
later. The rats were not used for assay until all were 
definitely negative. 

We used the following criteria for the classification of 
vaginal smears (66). 

I, Preponderence of leucocytes associated with a few compact 
and squamous cells. 

II, Predominance of compact ceils with a few squamous cells 
and leucocytes* 

II. * Compact cells only in large numbers of a characteristic 

appearance with the stained part drawn in, leaving a 
white ring around the cell or part of it. 

III. Predominance of squamous cells with a few leucocytes and 
compact cells. 

IV. Squamous cells only. 

1 and 11 are interpreted as negative. 

11* , 111, and IV are interpreted as positive. 

The smears were taken on the second, third and fourth 
days after injection, A small medicine dropper was employed 
for this purpose. A small volume of distilled water was 
injected gently into the vagina, the contents agitated, and 
removed. The contents of the dropper were spread on a slide, 
stained with methylene blue, and examined microscopically. 

Five rats were employed for each assay. The material was

administered in one injection subcutaneously under the loose 
skin of the flank. As an initial dose, 0.2 millilitres of 
the 5 millilitres of extract were given. When all the rats 
were negative with this dose, 0.4 millilitres was administered 
as a second dose. A period of at least ten days was allowed 
to elapse between the administration of the two doses. The 
rats were smeared before the administration of the second dose 
to determine if all were negative. 

A total of four extractions of twenty-four male urines 
were assayed by the Allen and Doisy method (1) and in no 
instance were we able to obtain a positive response with either 
a 0.2 or a 0.4 millilitre dose, (Table Thirty), indicating a 
low estrogenic titre.

To ascertain the ability of the spayed rats to respond 
to estrogens, 10 micrograms of estrone were administered to 
each of the rats used for assay purposes. The estrone was 
contained in 0.2 millilitre of sesame oil and in every case 
we obtained positive smears (Table Thirty-one)*

Technique One. For this purpose the chloroform was removed 
by distillation on a water-bath and the residue was dissolved 
in 25 millilitres of ethanol. A 0.25 millilitre aliquot of 
this solution was used for assay. 

All results obtained showed no agreement with the 
similiar series run using the Allen and Doisy (1) assay 
technique. In every instance the determined concentrations 
were several thousand times the normal twenty-four hour 
value reported in the literature (67).

Following the development of fluorometric Technique Two, 
additional attempts were made to assay estrogenic extracts 
of twenty-four hour male urine. The same extraction was 
utilized in our initial attempts to obtain a satisfactory 
extract for fluorometric assay without any better success. 

Further attempts at purification and deeolorization of 
the final extract did not improve the findings. While the 

results were somewaht lower the concentrations, as deter¬ 
mined, were still many times the known daily excretory value 
of estrone in male urine.

The purification procedures involved treatment of the 
final extract with charcoal and a chromatographic treatment 
(27) of the residue. These purifications were carried out 
separately but in several instances a combination of the 
two procedures were used. That is, the extract was passed 
through the chromatographic column and the eluate decoloriz¬ 
ed with charcoal« 

In Table Thirty-Three are compiled the results obtained 
with several different extraction and purification procedures* 
Extracts 1 and 2 show the results with the Leiboff and Tamis 
(24) method without any further purification. Numbers 3 and 
4 are extracts obtained by the method of Leiboff and Tamis 
but modified by treatment with charcoal (Extract 3); and by 
passing the solution through the chromatographic column of 
Stimmel (27),(Extract 4). Extract 5 was prepared by 
chromatographic purification and decolonization with char¬ 
coal * 

Departing somewhat from the usually accepted methods of 
extraction of the estrogens from urine by parition between 
immiscible solvents, Freed et al (22) have proposed a method 
involving the precipitation of the estrogens with a fifty 
percent sodium tungstate solution* No preliminary hydrolysis 
of the urine was performed by these workers. We introduced 
this modification to ensure complete extraction of the 
estrogenic hormones (16)* The technique employed consisted 
of refluxing the urine for ten minutes with 15 volumes per¬ 
cent hydrochloric acid and cooling the reaction mixture under 
the cold water tap immediately (20). The acidified urine 
was then treated with 5 N sodium hydroxide solution so as to

have the urine at approximate neutrality. 

The combined ether extracts were evaporated to dryness 
and the residue was dissolved in twenty-millilitres of 
ethanolo A 0.25 millilitre aliquot of this solution was 
tested for fluorescence initially and where the reading 
obtained was beyond galvanometer range, smaller volumes of 
the solution were analyzed. 

The readings obtained with this extraction procedure 
were also much higher than could be attributed to estrogens 
( Extract 6 )• Treating an extract obtained in this manner 
with charcoal until the extract was colorless still gave very 
high readings ( Extract 7 ). 

As there was a possibility that androgens were extracted 
along with the estrogens and were contributing in part to the 
fluorescence, an attempt was made to remove these by shaking 
the final ether extract with four separate portions of 2 N 
sodium hydroxide solution. The alkaline solution was then 
acidified with concentrated hydrochloric acid and extracted 
twice with twenty-five millilitre volumes of ethyl ether. 

The ether extracts were combined and washed twice with five 
millilitre volumes of 5% sodium carbonate solution and twice 
with five millilitre volumes of water. The washings were 
discarded. The residue was then evaporated to dryness and 
dissolved in twenty-five millilitres of ethanol for fluor- 
ometric assay. The results obtained with 0.25 millilitre 
aliquots of this solution are shown in Table Thirty-three 
( Extract 8 ). 

A number of extraction methods described in the lit¬ 
erature (19-21 ,68,69) were next investigated in the hope 
of finding a method where the final results would compare

favourably with results determined by biological assay. 

In all these methods the extracts are obtained in the 
usual manner involving preliminary hydrolysis of the urine 
followed by extraction with water-immiscible organic solvents. 
The procedures differ, however, in the purification tech¬ 
niques employed to get final extracts free of contaminants. 

Venning et al (19) and Stimmel (27) favour the use of 
butyl alcohol for the extraction of the estrogenic hormones 
from urine. This solvent is reported to extract fewer 
chromogenic pigments than other fat solvents. Further 
purification (19) is accomplished by washing the extract 
with sodium hydroxide solutions to effect the separation of 
the estrogens from the androgens. The phenolic nature of 
ring A of the estrogenic hormones enables them to react with 
solutions of the alkaline hydroxides to form the water soluble 
sodium salts. The androgens do not react and are left in the 
organic solvent. 

The final extract was, in our opinion, no less pigmented 
than an extract obtained by other methods (24). Results 
obtained again (Extract 9) greatly overestimated the normal 
estrone content of male urine and treatment of an extract 
with charcoal (Extract 10) did not significantly reduce the 
readings • 

Stimmel (27) has applied chromatographic treatment to 
effect the purification of the estrogenic extracts. The ether 
extract is dissolved in benzene and passed through a column, 
200 centimetres in length containing Alumina (Brockman) which 
has been previously moistened with twenty millilitres of 
benzene. The column is then fixed with a further fifty

millilitres of benzene. The estrogenic hormones are left 
behind on the column and their subsquent removal is effected 
by means of various strength solutions of absolute methanol 
in benzene. The three estrogens, estrone, estradiol and 
estriol may be collected separately by using different mix¬ 
tures of methanol and benzene. As we desired to examine the 
total estrogenic content of urine we used a mixture consisting 
of thirty parts of methanol and seventy parts benzene. This 
mixture has been reported to remove quantitatively all the 
estrogenic hormones. 

Extract 11 in Table Thirty-three shows the results with 
the Stimmel (27) procedure. The eluate was a dark brown 
colour and this pigmentation perhaps contributed to the high 
figures. Decolorization of the extract with charcoal (Extract 

12) produced somewhat lower figures but the agreement with 
bioassay was still not satisfactory. 

Cohen and Marrian (17) recommend the acidification of the 
alkaline solution of the estrogens and washing of this solution 
with toluene. This washing is reported to remove such sub¬ 
stances as pregnanediol and cholesterol which inhibit colour 
development in the Kober (46) reaction. 

No better success was achieved with this procedure(Extract 

13) or with subsequent treatment of the final extract with 
charcoal for decolorization purposes ( Extract 14, Table Thirty- 
three) • 

Bachman and Petit (21) have taken advantage of the weakly 
acidic properties of the estrogens and their relatively low 
solubility in mineral acids to effect purification. The 
benzene extract of urine is washed with 10% v/v of sulfuric

acid which removes much pigmented and chromogenic material 
from this solution* Estriol is previously removed by 
washing with 9 f 0 sodium carbonate as this estrogen is more 
soluble in the mineral acids and might be lost* 

Similiar results were obtained with this procedure as 
with the previous extractions (Extract 15) 0 Treatment of the 
final extract with charcoal reduced the reading somewhat 
(Extract 16). Passing a solution of the extract through a 
chromatographic column also caused a reduction (Extract 17). 
Treatment of the eluate from Extract 17 with charcoal made 
little improvement (Extract 18)* 

Beall and Edson (68) found that saturation of the 
toluene extract with sodium chloride prevented the removal of 
estrone and estradiol on subsequent washing with H/lO sodium 
hydroxide. At the same time much undesirable acidic material 
was removed* However, we obtained high estimates of estrone 
concentration using this procedure (Extract 19) and on sub¬ 
sequent treatment with charcoal (Extract 20). 

Mather (69) employed petroleum ether for purification 
purposes. This solvent is used to remove lipids and phenolic 
steroids but did not have the effect of reducing the t.ltre 
significantly (Extract 21). Treatment of the extract with 
charcoal did not produce the desired results (Extract 22). 

None of the extraction and purification procedures 
examined gave products whose assay by our fluorometric pro- 
cedure could be accepted as correct. In every instance the 
readings obtained greatly overestimated the reported estrone 
excretory value for normal male’s urine (67). It would seem 
that much non-estrogenic material remains in these extracts

SECTION FOUR 

Technique Three 

The publication by Bates and Cohen (63) of a method for 
the fluorometric estimation of the estrogens indicated that 
a simpler procedure than that developed by us vras possible® 

The procedure as described by these workers is as follows 

t 

An aliquot of an alcoholic solution of the estrogens is placed 
in the cuvette and to this is added one millilitre of 95$ 
sulfuric acid. The contents of the tube are mixed and heated 
in a water bath at 80° C. for ten minutes. The tube is then 
removed, cooled, and eight millilitres of 65$ sulfuric acid 
are added. The tube is again cooled and analyzed to deter¬ 
mine the intensity of fluorescence® 

These workers reported a linear relationship between 
intensity and concentration -for both estrone and estradiol 
over a range of one to ten micrograms. 

The filter utilized was the same B-l, PC-1 combina¬ 
tion with which we had obtained the best success. 

The 65$ sulfuric acid was made up in the ratio of 65 
parts of 95$ sulfuric acid to 35 parts of water as recommend¬ 
ed. While the resulting concentration is not exactly 65$ . 
w/w or v/v, we will refer to the strength of the sulfuric 
acid by this figure hereafter® 

To test this procedure we heated a series of aliquots 
of one milligram percent solutions of estrone in 95$ ethanol 
at 80° C. for ten minutes. The concentrations tested ranged 
from one to ten micrograms and were contained in 0*1 to 1.0 
millilitres of 95$ ethanol. The sensitivity of our apparatus 
was such that the maximum concentration giving a reading

within galvanometer range was 2.5 micrograms (Table Thirty- 
four) . 

It seemed possible that the different readings obtained 
by different workers, Jailer, Bates and Cohen and ourselves 
were due to differences in apparatus. To test this possibility 
we compared results obtained with our apparatus to those 
obtained with a similiar apparatus in the Department of 
Biochemistry using the standard reference solution. Quite 
different readings were obtained. It would seem that it is 
necessary to calibrate each apparatus, and that repeatedly, 
in order to detect failure. 

As shown also in Table Thirty-four there was poor agree¬ 
ment in readings given by the same concentration of estrone. 
Investigation showed the non-reproducibility was overcome by 
raising the temperature of the reaction mixture to that of a 
boiling water bath (98°C.) from 80°C. (Table Thirty-five). 

Not only was the reproducibility much better but sensitivity 
was increased. 

No mention was made by Bates and Cohen (63) of the use 
of a standard reference solution. In our attempts to reprod¬ 
uce the results obtained by these workers we made use of the 
quinine sulfate solution previously employed as a reference 
solution. Adjustment of the lamp intensity, and thus 
instrument sensitivity, by means of such a solution produces 
less variation in readings. 

In our previous techniques (One and Two) we had set the 
galvanometer to a reading of 100 with the quinine reference 
standard. With Technique Three it was found more suitable to 
set the galvanometer at 80 or approximately the minimum point

to which the "STD" knob may be rotated. This setting gave 
results more nearly approximating those of Bates and Cohen 
than did a setting of 100. 

This method of assay was found applicable to estrone, 
estradiol, estriol and estradiol benzoate. In every instance 
the reproducibility was very good; and the figures obtained 
obey Beer's Law. The results obtained in the calibration 
of the apparatus for these hormones are presented in Table 
Thirty-six and Graph Four. 

The ability of Bates and Cohen to obtain a satisfactory 
sensitivity without preliminary evaporation of the aliquot 
of estrogen solution to dryness raised the question as to 
the results obtainable if this procedure were used. It was 
also desired to know whether the volume of alcohol employed 
would have any effect on the final intensity. In Table 
Thirty-seven is presented data showing the effects of evap¬ 
oration as well as the results obtained when the estrone was 
present in volumes of alcohol ranging from 0.1 to 0.5 mill¬ 
ilitres. Estrone was used as the test material and approp¬ 
riate "blanks” were run in each case.

water bath and add eight millilitres of 65% sulfuric acid. 
Cool „ 

Evaporation of the alcoholic solution of estrone to 
dryness before the addition of the 95% sulfuric acid was 
found to increase greatly the intensity of fluorescence* 
Readings in every instance were beyond galvanometer range• 

The readings obtained with the estrone in solution were 
considerably lower, however, than when the evaporation 
process was used. The amount of ethanol, 0*1 to 0.5 
millilitres, used produced no significant difference in the 
readings obtained* 

Respite the higher intensity achieved by the evaporation 
method we did not change to this technique. The simplicity 
of the method, when the hormone is in solution, we felt 
outweighed the greater sensitivity obtained by evaporation* 
Also, we considered the assay procedure, as performed, to 
be of sufficient sensitivity for most purposes. 

The initial mixing of the one millilitre of 95% sulfuric 
acid and the eight millilitres of 65% sulfuric acid produces 
cloudiness throughout the reaction mixture. This cloudiness 
contributes considerably to the recorded intensity and gives 
an inaccurate estimation of the true concentration, of hormone 
present. The cloudiness takes several minutes to disappear 
and final readings should not be recorded until all 
cloudiness has disappeared*

SECTION FIVE 

The Assay of Commercial Prepara tio n s of Estrogens 

The potency of commercial preparations of estrogens is 
expressed both in terms of milligrams and International Units 
of estrone or of estradiol benzoate, depending on the material 
present. In the case of extracts of conjugates which have 
been obtained from pregnant mare’s urine and other sources, 
the potency is expressed in terms of equivalents of Inter¬ 
national Units of estrone. Present methods of assay of these 
products usually employ the Allen and Doisj^ (1) vaginal smear 
techniqueo Several chemical procedures (70, 71) for the 
determination of estrogenic preparations have been described 
in the literature and these and other modifications, the de¬ 
tails of which are not available outside their laboratories, 
are employed by various manufacturers. 

Types of preparations at present manufactured for clinical 
purposes include. 

1. Estradiol tablets, 

2. Estradiol benzoate or estradiol dipropionate in solution 

in various oils• 

3. Estradiol ointments. 

4. Estrone in solution in various oils. 

5. Estrone in suspension in aqueous mediums. 

6. Estriol capsules. 

7. Sodium estrone sulfate tablets. 

8. Conjugated estrogens in solution in various oils. 

9. Conjugated estrogens in tablet form. 

The strength of these preparations range from 0.1 milligrams 
(1000 I.U.) to 5 milligrams (50,000 I.U.)#

The extreme sensitivity manifested by our method of 
assay suggested the possibility of its adaptation to the 
assay of these products. Inasmuch as we were able to deter¬ 
mine a concentration as low as 0.5 micrograms the method 
appeared to possess the necessary qualifications for the 
estimation of the strength of individual tablets or ampoules 
without the necessity of combining several of these in order 
to have sufficient for assay purposes. 

Estradiol Tablets 

Control samples were made up consisting of estradiol 
in an intimate mixture with a vehicle composed of equal parts 
of corn starch and lactose. This mixture would appear to 
approximate the tablets on the market as they are in the 
form of tablet triturates. No attempt was made to mould 
these control mixtures into tablet form, the extraction being 
made from the powder. 

The strength of commercial tablets marketed are 0.1 
milligram, 0.2 milligram, and 0.5 milligrams and the individ¬ 
ual tablets weigh approximately 80 milligrams. The pro¬ 
cedure employed for the preparation of the control mixture 
was to weigh one milligram of estradiol and add it to a mix¬ 
ture of equal parts of corn starch and lactose. To prepare 
a mixture containing 0,5 milligrams of estradiol, the hormone 
would be mixed v/ith 159.0 milligrams of the vehicle and this 
mixture would then be divided into two parts of equal weight, 
each containing 0.5 milligrams of estradiol. 

Organic solvents would appear to be suitable for extract¬ 
ion purposes since estrogens are soluble in these materials, 
whereas the inert vehicle is not. The solvents investigated

were chloroform, anaesthetic ether and 95% ethanol. 

The mixture was suspended in twenty-five millilitres of 
the solvent and agitated intermittently for one half hour. 
The mixture was then filtered through a micro sintered 
glass filter using negative pressure. The residue remain¬ 
ing in the Srlenmeyer was washed several times with ten 
millilitre lots of the solvent. The washings were added to 
the main portion of the solvent and evaporated to a volume 
of two or three millilitres with the aid of gentle heat. 

The remainder of the solvent was removed by means of a 
stream of compressed air over the surface of the liquid. 

The purpose of this last step was to avoid charring and 
possible destruction of the estradiol. The residue was 
dissolved in sufficient ethanol to make a one milligram 
percent solution. 0.1 millilitre aliquots of this solution 
were then assayed fluorometrieally using Technique Three. 

Examination showed anaesthetic ether to be the most 
satisfactory extraction medium (Table Thirty-nine). Ethanol 
95% gave results varying from 25% to 50% in excess of the 
theoretical concentration. Addition of the 95% sulfuric 
acid to an aliquot of the extract made with this solvent 
showed evidence of charring. 

Chloroform, on the other hand, produced readings lower 
than the theoretical concentration. However, agreement of 
assays run in duplicate was good and there was no evidence 
of charring. Whether the dow readings were due to incomp¬ 
lete extraction or to the presence of inhibitory substances 
in the chloroform is unknown. 

Anaesthetic ether gave results showing recovery of 94-

101% of the known concentration of estradiol. As this 
appeared to he within the limits of experimental error, 
ether was considered satisfactory and used throughout. 

Examination showed that there was no necessity of 
allowing the mixture to stand one-half hour before 
filtration. Shaking the mixture vigorously with twenty- 
five millilitres of anaesthetic ether in a fifty millilitre 
Erlenmeyer completely extracted the estradiol. The 
Erlenmeyer was closed with a rubber stopper or cork covered 
with tin foilo 

To test the possibility that part of the fluorescence 
was contributed by the ether or vehicle, several extracts 
were made of "blank” samples of the vehicle. No fluor¬ 
escence was exhibited by these "blanks". 

An examination of a number of commercial tablets extract¬ 
ed by the above technique proved successful. The only change 
necessary in the technique was breaking up the tablet into 
a fine powder before extraction. This was accomplished by 
means of a fine glass stirring rod. 

The results of these assays are compiled in Table Forty. 
In several instances we extracted more than one tablet at a 
time to test the applicability of the technique to tablets 
of greater concentration than we had available. Satisfactory 
extractions resulted in every instance. 

Estrone Aqueous Suspensions 

Estrone aqueous suspension are marketed by several firms 
and consist of a suspension of pure crystalline estrone in 
isotonic sodium chloride solution. In one preparation of 
this type, 5.25% gum acacia is present to decrease the

tendency of the crystals to settle out of suspension. 

Mather (69) in his investigation on the partition of 
estrone between immiscible solvents had found estrone to 
be quantitatively removed from an aqueous medium with any 
one of a number of organic solvents including ether® The 
success we had achieved with anaesthetic ether in the ex¬ 
traction of estradiol from powders and tablets lead us to 
emplo3r this solvent for estrone® 

The strength of the control preparations was two mill¬ 
igrams per millilitre of vehicle® Two types of vehicles 
for this class of preparation were investigated. A simple 
vehicle of 0.9% sodium chloride solution and a similiar 
solution containing 5.25% gum acacia. To provide a more 
suitable working condition, the one millilitre volume of 
vehicle was diluted to ten millilitres with distilled 
watero 

To determine the amount of ether required for complete 
extraction several different methods were employed. 

1. Extraction with three separate volumes of anaesthetic 
ether of ten millilitres each. 

2. Extraction with three separate volumes of twenty-five, 
fifteen and ten millilitres respectively. 

3. Extraction with two separate volumes of twenty-five 
millilitres each. 

The separate portions of ether were combined and evap¬ 
orated nearly to dryness at a low temperature. The remain¬ 
ing ether was then removed by passing a stream of compressed 
air over the surface of the residue. The residue was diss¬ 
olved in twenty-five millilitres of ethanol and suitable

dilutions'were made so as to give a final solution contain¬ 
ing ten micrograms of estrone per millilitre <> Aliquots of 
this final solution were assayed by Technique Three* 

Extraction of a suspension of estrone in simple sodium 
chloride solution by the first method produced results 
averaging approximately Q0% of the known concentration (Table 
Forty). The results did not agree well in duplicate and this 
made us suspect the presence of some inhibitory substance in 
the final extract* Backwashing of the ether with ten mill¬ 
ilitres of distilled water in two separate five millilitre, 
portions was found to overcome this variance and the deter¬ 
mined concentrations agreed well with the known concentrat¬ 
ions (Table Forty)• 

Extraction with the thirty millilitre volume of 
anaesthetic ether of a suspension of estrone in gum acacia 
did not effect complete extraction of the hormone (Table 
Forty). Increasing the number of washings with distilled 
water did not remove any material which might be inhibit¬ 
ing the fluorescent development and did not produce the 
desired readings* Extraction with a twenty-five millilitre 
volume followed by a fifteen and a ten millilitre volume of 
anaesthetic ether was found to effect complete extraction. 

The three portions of anaesthetic ether were combined and 
backwashed with two lots of five millilitres ‘each of dis¬ 
tilled water. The same results could be obtained with two 
extractions, utilizing twenty-five millilitres for each 

extraction (Table Forty)* 

A total of five ampoules were assayed in the photo- 
fluorometer by Technique Three to determine the estrone

content. The vehicle used for suspending purposes in 
these was sodium chloride solution containing 5.25$ gum 
acacia. The extractions were performed with two sep¬ 
arate volumes of twenty-five millilitres of anaesthetic 
ether which were combined and backwashed with ten mill¬ 
ilitres of distilled water in two separate five millilitre 
volumes. The readings range from 96.6 to 102.9$ of the 
labelled strength (Table Forty-One). 

The alcoholic solution of the final extract was 
diluted to give a solution containing ten micrograms per 
millilitre; and 0.1 millilitre aliquots of this solution 
were assayed by Technique Three. If the extraction were 
100$ such an aliquot should give a reading of 61. This is 
the reading obtained with a similiar solution of crystall¬ 
ine estrone in ethanol (Table Thirty-eight).

Estrone in Oil 

A number of ampoules of crystalline estrone in sol¬ 
ution in either peanut or sesame oil were made available 
to us for assay purposes. The several strengths provided 
were 1, 0.2 and 0.1 milligrams per millilitre of oil. 

An attempt was made to extract the estrone from these 
solutions following a procedure outlined by Carol and 
Rotondaro (71) . The technique employed was as follows:- 

One millilitre of the oil solution of estrone was 
measured into a 125 millilitre separatory funnel contain¬ 
ing twenty-five millilitres of petroleum ether ( boiling 
point 35-60° G* )• Ten millilitres of 2 N sodium hydroxide 
solution were added, the mixture was shaken vigorously for 
two minutes, and the two layers were allowed to separate 
completely. The aqueous layer was transferred to a second 
125 millilitre separatory funnel. The extraction was re¬ 
peated with two additional ten millilitre portions of 2 N 
sodium hydroxide solution, 'each of which was added to the 
second funnel. The petroleum ether solution was discarded. 
A 50$ v/v solution of sulfuric acid was added to the 
alkaline solutions until a permanent opalesence formed 
(acid to litmus). The mixture was cooled thoroughly and 
twenty-five millilitres of anaesthetic ether were added. 

The mixture was shaken throughly for one minute and the two 
layers were allowed to separate. The acid layer was trans¬ 
ferred to a second 125 millilitre separatory funnel and the 
extraction was repeated with another twenty-five millilitres 
of anaesthetic ether. The acid layer was discarded. The 
ether layer was washed with two, five millilitre portions

of 5% sodium carbonate solution and then with two five 
millilitre portions of distilled water* The ether solution 
was transferred to a 50 millilitre "beaker and evaporated 
to a volume of three or four millilitres. The final few 
millilitres of liquid were removed by directing a stream 
of compressed air over the surface* 

Carol and Rotondaro (71) were able to report recov¬ 
eries of estrone ranging from 98% to 101% of the known 
concentrations in control samples prepared in sesame oil. 

The assay procedure emploj^ed was of the gravimetric type 
and good agreement was obtained in duplicate samples* 

The method was effective for concentrations of from one 
to ten milligrams of estrone* 

Assay of solutions of estrone containing 1 milligram 
per millilitre in either peanut or sesame oil indicated 
a degree of extraction (Table Forty-two)comparable to 
that obtained by Carol and Rotondaro (71). The control 
samples were prepared by dissolving the crystalline estrone 
in anaesthetic ether, adding the required amount of oil and 
removing the ether by gently heating the mixture on a hot¬ 
plate. One millilitre portions of the resulting solution 
in oil were extracted and assayed by Technique Three* 

Commercial ampoules containing one milligram of estrone 
per millilitre in both peanut and sesame oils were extract¬ 
ed by the above method and assayed by Technique Three. The 
residue remaining after removal of the ether was dissolved 
in sufficient alcohol to make a one milligram percent 
solution; and 0.1 millilitre aliquots of this solution were

assayed in the Photofluorometer. The assay results, re¬ 
ported as a percentage of the label statement are compiled 
in Table Forty-two. 

Although Carol and Rotondaro (71) had not employed 
this procedure for the gavimetric assay of smaller quant¬ 
ities than one milligram of estrone we attempted to assay 
0.2 milligram per millilitre solutions in both peanut and 
sesame oils. Initial attempts produced results higher than 
the known concentration. In some instances the discrepancy 
was as much as 60$ greater and the results also did not 
agree well in duplicate (Table Forty-three). 

Vegetable oils are known to produce fluorescence and 
it was thought that either the oily vehicle itself or fatty 
acids present in the final extract might be contributing 
to the fluorescent intensity. We repeated these assays 
with a second oil but with the same anomalous results (Table 
Forty-three). 

Several approaches appeared possible in our examination 
of the probable causes of the variance. 

1. The fluorescence due to the oil could be corrected for 
by using a solution made from a "blank 11 oil. 

2. Extraction with fewer volumes of 2 N sodium hydroxide 
solution. 

3. Extraction with N instead of 2 N sodium hydroxide 
solution. 

4. Extraction with fewer and/or smaller volumes of 
anaesthetic ether. 

5. Washing with more volumes and/or stronger strengths 
of sodium carbonate solution.

The "blank" extract was dissolved in twenty millilitres

it was impossible to record the same value for the "blank" 
oil in each assay we were unable to use this technique* 

The Carol and Rotondaro (71) procedure had employed 
three separate extractions of the petroleum ether solutions 
with ten millilitre portions of 2 N sodium hydroxide 
solution. On the assumption that fewer fatty acids might 
be extracted-with one or two extractions instead of the 
three previously used we prepared extracts using this tech¬ 
nique. The results obtained with two extractions were still 
much higher than the theoretical or known concentrations 
and the variance between duplicate determinations was still 
marked* When one extraction with 2 N sodium hydroxide was 
used the recoveries were less than 100% and the extreme 
variance between duplicates made us fear that most of the 
fluorescence was due to fatty acids or oil (Table Forty- 
Three)« 

Extraction with one, twenty-five millilitre portion 
of anaesthetic ether or with three, fifteen millilitre 
volumes did not overcome the variance. The final extract 
was dissolved in twenty millilitres of ethanol and assayed 
fluorometrically by Technique Three with no better sucess 
(Table Forty-Three)*

Increasing the number of washings with sodium car¬ 
bonate solution to four washings with five millilitre 
volumes of 5$ sodium carbonate solution did not decrease 
the variance between duplicates or reduce the intensity 
of fluorescence to a reading proportional to the estrone 
present. The use of three volumes of five millilitres 
each of 10% sodium carbonate solution was not satisfact¬ 
ory because an emulsion formed and it was difficult to get 
complete separation of the two layers (Table Forty-three) <> 
Visual examination of the results remaining after 
evaporation of all these extractions showed a slight oily 
film to be present in nearly every case. This film had 
also been present in the residue remaining after ether 
extraction of the controls containing one milligram of 
estrone. However, the results obtained with these extracts 
on fluorescent analysis of an alcoholic solution of this 
residue had shown no variance between duplicates and good 
agreement with known concentrations. The solution of the 
residue for these previous assays had been made in one 
hundred millilitres of ethanol, whereas, for the assay of 
0.2 milligram per millilitre solutions of estrone, the 
residue had been dissolved in twenty millilitres of ethanol. 
The purpose of this was to have the resulting solution con¬ 
tain ten micrograms of estrone per millilitre of ethanol . 
which would have the same strength as the solution used for 
the calibration of the Photofluorometer with estrone. By 
using such a solution, 0.1 millilitre aliquots should give 
a reading of 61 on the galvanometer, or the same as the 
solution of crystalline Nitrone in ethanol. This procedure

cases, and the. concentrations determined were approximately 
100% of the known concentration (Table Forty-three). 

Examination of the "blank" oils showed that solutions 
of the residue in fifty millilitres of ethanol gave read¬ 
ings of 12 in every case but solution in one hundred 
millilitres reduced the fluorescence displayed by these to 
zero. Solution of the residue in twenty millilitres of 
ethanol produced readings varying greatly in every assay 
(Table Forty-four). We, therfore, abandoned the previous 
procedure of making one milligram percent solutions of 
estrone and dissolved the residue in one hundred millilitres 
of ethanol. The same procedure was also used for extracts of 
0.1 milligram per millilitre solutions of estrone in oil with 
satisfactory results (Table Forty-five). 

A number of commercial ampoules of estrone in both peanut 
and sesame oils were examined by the above procedure. The 
strength of these preparations was 0.1 or 0.2 milligrams per 
millilitre of crystalline estrone. The results of these assays 
together with the results of assay of controls are presented 
in Table Forty-Five. All determined concentrations agreed 
satisfactorily with the labelled strength. 

Estradiol Monobenzoate 

Since estradiol monobenzoate is insoluble in solutions 
of alkali hydroxides it cannot be extracted from oils in a 
similiar manner to estrone. Therefore, a method for its 
estimation in oil solution would require one or the other of 
the following two methods:- 

1 0 An assay based on the difference in fluorescence 

exhibited by the oil solution and the oil itself.

2, Hydrolysis of the estradiol monobenzoate to estradiol and 
separation from the products of hydrolysis of the oil. 

Since the molecular weight of estradiol monobenzoate is 
376,77 and that of estradiol is 272„2, 1 0 38 milligrams of 
the monobenzoate yields 1 milligram of estradiol. Control 
samples were prepared containing 1 milligram of estradiol 
monobenzoate per millilitre of peanut oil. This amount of 
estradiol monobenzoate would be equivalent to 0.723 
milligrams of estradiol. 

To examine the first method one millilitre of peanut 
oil was diluted to one hundred millilitres with ethanol 
and 0.1 millilitre aliquots of this solution were tested 
for fluorescent intensity by Technique Three. The readings 
obtained were all beyond galvanometer range and the meter 
could not be adjusted to zero with the n STD n knob. Thus 
the possibility of employing a method of assay based on 
difference in fluorescence displayed by the oil solution 
and the oil itself was not possible. 

Hydrolysis 

Elvidge (70) had described a procedure for the hydrolysis 
of estradiol monobenzoate to estradiol and extraction of the 
salt from the resultant soap. He obtained readings 42$ in 
excess of the theoretical concentration and attributed the 
error to the presence of fatty acids in the final extract. 
These fatty acids gave absorption, on spectrophotometric 
analysis, in the same region as the estradiol and thus the 
error arose. 

An attempt to obtain an extract by the method of 
Elvidge (70) produced an oily residue on evaporation of the

final ether solution. Assay of an 0 0 1 millilitre aliquot 
of this residue dissolved in one hundred millilitres of 
ethanol produced readings beyond the range of the galvanometer. 
This would indicate a concentration of at least 100% in 
excess of the known concentration. 

Our next attempts were aimed at removing the fatty 
acids formed during the saponification process. The 
saponification was performed by refluxing the oil for 
thirty minutes with twenty millilitres of N/2 alcoholic 
potassium hydroxide on a boiling water bath (70) 0 

A solution of lead acetate on addition to a solution 
of fatty acids will form lead soaps, which are insoluble 
in both water and organic solvents. The United States 
Pharmacopoeia XIII in its monograph for peanut oil describes 
a process for precipitating the fatty acids of this oil by 
the addition of a hot solution of lead acetate. The soap 
formed by saponification is dissolved in fifty millilitres 
of hot water, and hydrochloric acid is added until the 
fatty acids separate as an oily layer. These fatty acids 
are dissolved in ether, and a hot alcoholic solution of 
lead acetate is added. The mixture is then allowed to 
stand for twelve hours and the insoluble lead soap filtered 
off. 

An effort was made to adapt the United States Pharma¬ 
copoeia procedure for the precipitation of fatty acids to 
the removal of these fatty acids from our extract of estradiol 
monobenzoate in oil solutions.

Extract One 

The soap obtained by the saponification of the oils 
was dissolved in fifty millilitres of hot water and hydro¬ 
chloric acid was added until the fatty acids just precipitated. 
The solution was extracted with three, twenty-five millilitre 
portions of anaesthetic ether and backwashed with two, five 
millilitre portions of distilled water. The washings were 
discarded. To the ether solution was added two grammes of 
lead acetate in twenty-five millilitres of hot ethanol. 

The mixture was agitated and allowed to stand for twelve 
hours. The precipitate which formed was filtered off and 
the ether evaporated at a low temperature. The residue was 
dissolved in one hundred millilitres of ethanol and 0.1 
millilitre aliquots of this solution were assayed by 
Technique Three. 

The readings obtained agreed well in duplicate but the 
determined concentration was 35% in excess of the known 
concentration of estradiol monobenzoate in the control 
sample {Table Forty-six). 

Two other attempts to obtain a satisfactory extract in 
this manner produced results 69% and 38% in excess of the 
known concentration {Table Forty-six). 

Extract Two 

In our second attempt to get a. pure extract the initial 
extraction was performed as above. The final residue remaining 
after the evaporation of the ether, however, was dissolved 
in twenty-five millilitres of petroleum ether and a further 
extraction was performed by the method of Carol and Rotondaro

(71) for the removal of estrone from oil solutions. 

Determined concentrations with two attempts were 37 0 6 
and 40,8$ of the theoretical concentration of estradiol 
monobenzoate <, 

Extract Three 

The addition of a solution of lead acetate to the fatty- 
acids immediately after acidification of the aqueous solution 
of soap, without preliminary extraction with ether, produced 
a dense precipitate of lead chloride. The amount of this 
precipitate could be reduced by controlling the amount of 
acid added prior to the addition of the lead acetate 
solution. Adding the acid drop by drop until the fatty acids 
just precipitated was found to produce the least amount of 
precipitate. 

The solution and precipitate were extracted with three, 
twenty-five millilitre volumes of anaesthetic ether. The 
ether extracts were combined, filtered through a small plug 
of absorbent cotton and backwashed with ten millilitres of 
distilled water. The ether was then evaporated to dryness 
and the residue dissolved in one hundred millilitres of 
ethanol. 0d millilitre aliquots of this solution were 
assayed by Technique Three. 

The results obtained did not agree well in duplicate 
and averaged 54$ in excess of the known concentration (Table 
Forty-six). 

Two other attempts failed to produce a satisfactory 
extract. In these instances evaporation of the ether left 
an oily solution indicating that the fatty acids had not 
been precipitated.

Extract Four 

The cloudy nature of the final ether solution and the 
slight solubility of lead acetate in ether indicated that 
perhaps this material was contributing to the fluorescence. 
Backwashing of this ether solution with five millilitre 
volumes of distilled water until the solution was clear 
produced a determined concentration of SB*9?l and 83»7$ of 
the known in duplicate determinations. However, we were 
unable to repeat these results and other determinations 
averaged 37.6 and 50.7$ in excess of the known concentration 
(Table Forty-six). 

Extract Five 

The insolubility of lead carbonate in ether led to an 
attempt to precipitate any lead acetate that might be present 
by the addition of 10$ sodium carbonate solution. The ether 
solution was - washed with five millilitre volumes of 10$ 
sodium carbonate solution until no more precipitate formed. 
The ether solution was then filtered through absorbent 
cotton and backwashed with two, five millilitre portions of 
distilled water. Several results were obtained ranging from 
65$ of the known concentration to 6.8$ in excess with poor 
agreement in duplicate. 

No further investigation of this latter step was under¬ 
taken as in many instances the addition of sodium carbonate 
solution produced a permanent emulsion. This would ax^pear 
to indicate that the fatty acids were not completely 
precipitated and were reacting with the sodium carbonate 
solution to form a soap.

Preparations of Conjugated Estrogens 

Certain commercial preparations used for estrogenic 
activity consist of conjugated estrogens and complex 
estrogens as found in pregnant mare’s urine. These prep¬ 
arations are stated by the manufacturers to contain mostly 
estrone with varying amounts of equilin, equilenin and 
potassium estrone sulfate. The activity of these prep¬ 
arations is expressed in terms of International Units of" 
estrone and the potency is determined by biological assayo 
These conjugated estrogens are available in aqueous 
suspensions, oily capsules, suppositories and solutions in 
oil o

The results of a series of extractions performed by 
the method of Carol and Rotondaro (71) and assayed by 
Technique Three are compiled in Table Forty-seven<> In 
every instance the readings were far below the stated 
concentration of International Units of estrone* 

The Photofluorometric method of assay does not appear 
to be applicable to the estimation of the potency of such 
estrogenic mixtures* The fact that the fluorescent 
phenomenon is not specific to any one estrogen and also 
that the estrogens vary in their biological potency 
would make difficult any statement regarding the true 
strength of these preparations based on a fluorometric 


assay 



SUMMARY 




- Ill 


SUMMARY 

1. A satisfactory photofluorometric method for the estimation 
of certain crystalline estrogens has been developed. 

So This method has been successfully adapted to the assay of 
commercial preparations of estradiol tablets, aqueous 
suspensions of crystalline estrone, and solutions of estrone 
in oil® 

3o Efforts to develope a photofluorometric assay for urinary 
estrogens were unsuccessful. 

4 9 The degree of fluorescence produced by testosterone, 
androsterone, dehydroandrosterone, dehydroandrosterone 
acetate and progesterone was considerably less than that 
produced by estrogens and has not been adapted to 
analytical procedures®
