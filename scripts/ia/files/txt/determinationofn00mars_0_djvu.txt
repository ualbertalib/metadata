IHE_DETERM IN ATION OF NE UTR AL EQDIYALgNgS 
OP FATTY ACIDS . 

Ordinary titration in the determination of 
neutral equivalents of fatty acids has proven to be far 
from satisfactory. The amount of fatty acid required 
in the determination is large, making it wasteful, 
which is a detriment to fatty acid research. The work 
on fatty acids in this laboratory 1 has shown it to 
be also desirable that a more suitable method be 
devised. 

The use of ethyl alcohol as a solvent in 

acid - base titrations in this particular work, is 

advantageous for two reasons. The first is its solvent 

power on fatty acids and their soaps, the latter being 

not very soluble in water. The second is the somewhat 

2 

greater sharpness of the end point obtainable. This 
is due to the fact that the dissociation of alcohol is 
much less than that of water, so that there is a great¬ 
er range of hydrogen ion concentration between an acid 
and an alkaline solution. For the same reason the 







- ( 2 ) - 

degree of alcoholysis of salts of weak acids and bases 
is less than the degree of hydrolysis, consequently 
the change in hydrogen ion concentration through the 
end point is more rapid in alcohol than in water. The 
bases in the alcohol system are ethylates, so that the 
neutralisation of a weak acid by sodium ethylate would 
be represented in the ionic form by the equation, 

HA * fi H_cf A" 4- C o H c -0H. 

2 5 2 5 

While the dissociation of the acid HA is doubtless 
smaller in alcohol than in water, the dissociation 
of the alcohol is so much less than that of water, so 
as to account for the degree of alcoholysis just men¬ 
tioned. The alcoholysis of the salt is, of course, 
represented by the reverse equation. 

For the titration of weak acids and bases, 
it is necessary to select an indicator which changes 
color at the hydrogen ion concentration existing at 
the true end point, when the acid and the base are 
present in equivalent quantities. 5 An indicator scale 
for alcoholic solutions, similar to those in common 
use for aqueous solutions, has been prepared. The

indicator which changes color at the hydrogen ion 
concentration existing at the true end point in the 
titration of fatty acids with sodium ethylate, is 
thymolphthalein. 

The purpose of this investigation, therefore, 
has been the determination of neutral equivalents of 
fatty acids by titrating in ethyl alcohol with the 
ethylate icn as the base. Much smaller quantities of 
the fatty acids, than is customary have been used. To 
make the end point more visible, Messier tubes and 
a mixed indicator have been used. 

MATERIALS. 

4 

STHYL ALCOHOL - Ninety-five per cent ethyl alcohol 
was distilled from concentrated sulfuric acid to re¬ 
move amines (10-15 cc, of concentrated sulfuric acid 
to one liter of alcohol). It was distilled again from 
silver nitrate and potassium hydroxide to remove al¬ 
dehydes (10 g. per liter of silver nitrate and a little 
potassium hydroxide). Then it was left in contact with 
calcium oxide for two days and finally redistilled 
using a trap to prevent any solid material distilling 


over.

SODIUM ET HYL ATE - After bubbling hydrogen gas through 
the ethyl alcohol, enough sodium was added to make the 
solution about 0,05 N. 

FA TTY ACID S - Eastman Kodak Company fatty acids were 

recrystallized from acetone until a constant capillary 

melting point was obtained, and agreed with those found 

5 

in the literature* After six recrystallizations from 
acetone fifty grams of the Eastman product gave twenty 
grams of the pure fatty acid in the case of stearic and 
palmitic acids. Fifty grams of myristic acid, after four 
recrystallizations, gave ten grams of the pure acid. 
Fifty grams of lauric acid, after three recrystalliz¬ 
ations gave six grams of the pure acid* All the fatty 
acids were dried in an AbderhaMen dryer, using conc¬ 
entrated sulfuric acid as the drying agent, water as a 
heating liquid, and with the system evacuated. The 
temperature was high enough to melt the fatty acid, 
and it was kept in the molten condition for at least 
t^o hours. 

ESN ZQI. C ACID - Bureau of Standards benzoic acid was 
dried in an Abderhalden dryer in a similar manner to 







-(B)- 


that of the fatty acids. 

THYM OL ?HIHALEIN IN DI C ATOR - Five grams of thymolphthal- 
ein was dissolved in a liter of alcohol. 

AP PARA TUS. 

(See page 6 for diagram). 

The sodium ethylate was kept in a three liter 
short-necked flask under an atmosphere of hydrogen 
furnished hy a Kipp generator. The hydrogen was purified 
by passing through alkaline pyrogallol to remove oxygen, 
silver nitrate to remove arsine, soda lime to remove 
carbon dioxide, and finally through calcium chloride to 
remove water vapor. The micro-burette was filled by the 
pressure of hydrogen forcing the sodium ethylate up the 
tube into the burette. It was found necessary to com¬ 
pletely empty the burette after the end of a titration, 
because if left in, the sodium ethylate dissolved off 
the stopcock grease, and air was admitted into the 
system, which caused the sodium ethylate to become 
colored yellow. This Is due to the fact that oxygen 
oxidizes the alcohol to the aldehyde and then in the 
presence of alkali there is polymerization.

PROC EDUR E* 

The fatty acid was weighed out into Nessler 
tubes* An amount equivalent to about ten cc. of 0*05 N 
sodium ethylate was used* Ten cc. of the purified ethyl 
alcohol was added to each of the Nessler tubes from a 
pipette taking care to wash down any particles of the 
fatty acid clinging to the walls of the tube. Five drops 
of thymolphthalein indicator and three drops of methyl 
orange indicator (0.2 g. of methyl orange per liter of 
water) were added to each of the tubes. Each Nessler 
tube was heated to about sixty-five degrees centigrade, 
by running hot water, and titrated with 0.05 N sodium 
ethylate. A ring stirrer was used and when near the end 
point, vigorous stirring was required after the add¬ 
ition of each drop. One Nessler tube was used as a 
control. Twenty cc. of ethyl alcohol was put into it, 
and three drops of methyl orange indicator. The solut¬ 
ion being titrated, remained the same color as the 
control during titration* At the end point the solution 
being titrated became a darker color than the control. 
The color change is from a yellow to a blue and is quite 
distinct with the addition of one drop of the sodium

ethylate. 


EXPERIMENTAL. 

The sodium ethylate was standardized against 
Bureau of Standards’ benzoic acid. About 0.06 g. of 
benzoic acid was weighed out into a Messier tube, and 
titrated in the same manner as described above. In the 
earlier titrations no auxiliary indicator was used, the 
thymolphthalein alone acted as indicator. Since the end 
point was not very visible, especially in the absence 
of good daylight,it was difficult to obtain good re¬ 
sults. Therefore it was necessary to do many titrations 
before the skill in observing the end point was 
acquired. 


Sixteen samples each of stearic and of palm¬ 
itic acids were titrated, and in each case not more 
than 0.15 g. of the fatty acid was used. Thymolphthal¬ 
ein alone as indicator was used. Under the same condi¬ 
tions, fourteen different mixtures of palmitic and 
stearic acids were titrated, giving the following 


results.

The last four on stearic acid were done by 
electric light and are not so good. It is seen that 
the neutral equivalents of fatty acids can he deter¬ 
mined with an error of 0.5 providing titrations 
are done in good daylight. The composition of a binary 
mixture can also he determined in the same way. 

Another factor to he controlled, was the change 


of volume of the sodium ethylate with temperature. The 
volume change of 10 cc. of ethyl alcohol is 0.01 cc.

per degree change of temperature. Therefore it "became 
necessary to standardize the sodium ethylate before 
every series of titrations and to keep the temperature 
as constant as possible. If any change of temperature 
occurred during the titration, corrections were ap¬ 
plied. The results with this controlled factor are 
as follows:

Again the error is the same as before but the calc¬ 
ulated values are all higher than the experimental 
values. 

Since only C.C6 g. of benzoic acid was used 
in the standardization of the sodium ethylate, it was 
thought that this weight and the low equivalent of 
benzoic acid might have something to do with this error.

Therefore the sodium ethylate was standardized against 
stearic acid and then mixtures of stearic and palmitic 
acids were titrated. The results obtained are shown 
in Table (3).

The error is somewhat smaller than before but not 
appreciably. Therefore the error introduced when using 
benzoic acid for standardizing the sodium ethylate 
is not responsible for the total error in the neutral 
equivalents.

Since the effect of light on the end point is 


marked, it became necessary to use a constant source 
of light* A daylight lamp was set up and a series of 
titrations made using benzoic acid for standardizing 
the sodium ethylate. The results are shown in Table (4)

During the course of these titrations it was 
observed that the end point was not as distinct as in 
ordinary daylight. The results also show that a day¬ 
light lamp is valueless. 

A final run was just about to be made when 
the sodium ethylate became colored yellow. A set of 
titrations were done using the colored solution stand¬ 
ardized against benzoic acid.

During the titration, it was observed that the 
end point was much sharper and more visible than the 
end point obtained when titrating with a clear solution 
of sodium ethylate. The results obtained are better than 
before. This immediately suggested mixed indicators. A 
mixture of thymolphthalein and phenolphthalein gave a 
very indistinct end point, but a mixture of thymol¬ 
phthalein and methyl orange gave a very distinct end

point. Five drops of thymolphthalein (5 g. per liter 
of ethyl alcohol) and three drops of methyl orange (.2 g. 
per liter of water) were used.

The myristic and lauric acids were titrated at night hy 
electric light and the end point was observable as well 
as in the daylight. From the results that it gave, and 
the sharpness of the end point, it was concluded that 
a mixed indicator of thymolphthalein and methyl orange 
was the most suitable for titrating fatty acids. 

Attempts were made to do titrations in the 
butylate and the isopropylate systems but with little 
success. The fatty acids are more soluble in these al¬ 
cohols but the soaps formed are not very soluble. 

Finally an attempt was made to make the method

semi-micro by using not more than fifty milligrams of 
the fatty acid and titrating with 0.017 N sodium ethyl¬ 
ate standardised against stearic acid. The following 
results were obtained.

This time the end point was not as sharp as before, two

CONCL USIONS. 

A method has been devised to determine the 
neutral equivalents of fatty acids to within an accuracy 
of 0.4 % using at the most 0.15 g. of the fatty acid, or 
to within an accuracy of 0.6 % using semi-micro quant¬ 
ities or not more than .04 g. of the fatty acid. A mixed 









- ( 16 ) - 


indicator of thymolphthalein and methyl orange was 
found to he most suitable.

PART TWO. 

BINAR Y SYSTEMS OF SOME FATTY ACIDS, 

This work is a continuation of a systematic 
study of fatty acids and synthetic fats begun by Woolley 
and Sandin. 1 A study of binary systems of fatty acids 
is of importance from the standpoint of its possible 
analytical values, the separation of fatty acids from 
mixtures of these acids, and also from the standpoint 
of purely theoretical interest. 

The purity of a fatty acid can be studied and 
confirmed with definite limitations by means of the 
cooling curve, i. e. the time - temperature curve. The 
form of the time - temperature curve for a single pure 
substance is given in fig. 1, the dotted portion at 
B representing the limiting case of no undercooling 
before freezing sets in. 













The temperature of a mass of a pure liquid, 
surrounded "by a shield, cooling at a uniform rate (along 

RS), falls along the line AB to C at which point cryst¬ 
allization is initiated. The heat supplied by the cryst¬ 
allization raises the temxoerature to that of the true 
equilibrium between solid and liquid; and the curve is 
horizontal along DE. When crystallization is substant¬ 
ially complete, at E, the effective temperature head is 
relatively large, and so the mass at first cools rapidly; 
but finally the curve at F again becomes parallel to RS. 

The shape of the curve described above is a 
good criterion of purity of a substance. With a per¬ 
fectly pure sample, the temperature remains quite const¬ 
ant during the freezing ( DE fig. 1 ); over an interval 
of five minutes or more. If the substance contains 
admixed impurity, the initial temperature of freezing 
will likely be depressed, the temperature falls off as 
the freezing progresses, and the concentration of the 
impurity in the solution increases. White ^ has given 
a thorough discussion of this matter, and its usefulness 
as a means of estimating the amount of impurity. 

The interpretation of a time - temperature 







< 








. 









V 



















i 














- ( 19 ) - 


curve for a binary mixture is as follows. A binary 
mixture cools similarly along AP ( fig. 2 ) until one 
of the components begins (in the absence of undercooling) 
to separate at P, when there is a change in direction 
(along the curve PD), but there is no horizontal portion 
in the curve. The heat set free now causes the rate of 
( fig. 2 ) 



cooling of the melt to change in a perfectly definite 
way, because to any temperature below P, there corres¬ 
ponds a definite composition of the residual liguid. Hence 
a definite amount of the component has crystallized, and 
a definite total amount of heat has been disengaged. The 
composition of the residual liquid approaches that of 
the eutectic, as the eutectic temperature is approached. 

At that temperature, the liquid still remaining, behaves 
like a pure substance. In this case, therefore, the 












' 









< 



' 













. 

















- 











, 



. 









- ( 20 ) - 


momentary composition of the solution is a factor in 
the cooling curve and its interpretation* 

The typical experimental curve for a binary 
mixture differs only in that seme undercooling is un¬ 
avoidable and, indeed, not undesirable provided that 
the curve be interpreted properly. When crystallization 
is induced at C ( fig. 2 ), equilibrium between comp¬ 
onent X and the solution is soon attained and maintained 
thereafter. The heat set free raises the temperature 
rapidly to a maximum D beyond which it falls off as 
before, a state of equilibrium being maintained. It is 
clear that the composition of the liquid phase at D 
differs from that of the original solution by the pro¬ 
portion of X which has then crystallized; and in careful 
work -this fact must be properly taken into account. The 
usual methods of making this correction are not based 
upon sound principles and are unsatisfactory* 

n 

Eell and Herty made this correction in the 
following way. They considered the initial portion of 
the graph ( fig. 2 ), DE to be linear, producing it 
backwards to meet AB and assuming that this intersection 
represents the temperature corresponding to the initial 















- ( 21 ) - 


crystallization of X from the given solution. Now with 
different degrees of undercooling of a single solution, 
this procedure leads to different values, as is evident 
from fig. 3, and is therefore unsatisfactory. Moreover, 
( fig. 3 ) 



Ime 


with solutions initially near the eutectic point, the 

curvature of the portion DE is so great as to render 

back extrapolation very uncertain if not impossible. The 

approximate character of this method of extrapolation 

8 

has been remarked in two papers. In this work, the 
freezing point was taken to be that at D (fig. 2) since 
with a small degree of undercooling the error is 
negligible. 

The purpose of this investigation was to det¬ 
ermine the freezing points of binary mixtures of the 
fatty acids— stearic, palmitic, myristic, and lauric.

Work has been done on stearic - palmitic, margaric -

stearic, and margaric - palmitic." Compound formation 

between two fatty acids has been reported for mixtures 

5 q 

of palmitic - stearic, n eicosanic - stearic, ligno- 

10 

ceric - stearic and lignoceric - palmitic. Compound 
formation has also been reported between lauric and 
palmitic acids. 11 Ho information is available on the 
behavior of mixtures of the other fatty acids. 

MATE RIA LS, A PPARATUS, AND PROCEDURE. 

The purest Eastman Kodak Company fatty acids 
were used. These were recrystallized from acetone many 
times, and with a considerable loss, until a constant 
capillary melting point was obtained. Stearic and 
palmitic acids, after six recrystallizations from acetone 
gave a constant melting point. The loss in each case 
was fifty percent. Myristic acid required four recryst¬ 
allizations from acetone to give a constant melting 
.point. The loss in the myristic acid was eighty percent. 
Lauric acid gave a constant capillary melting point 
after three recrystallizations from acetone. The loss 
in this case was eighty-eight percent. The neutral

equivalents of these purified fatty acids agreed closely 
with the calculated values. 

The determination of freezing points is test 

carried out by means of taking time - temperature curves. 

12 

The most suitable way is by means of a thermoelement. 

A suitable thermoelement was devised, but a sensitive 
enough galvanometer was not available, therefore it was 
necessary to resort to simpler apparatus. The form of 
apparatus finally used, was the ordinary molecular 
weight apparatus. A small test tube was surrounded by 
a larger one, forming an air jacket, and the whole was 
immersed in a water bath. The fatty acid (about one gram) 
was weighed out into a small test tube, the inside test 
tube in the set-up, and warmed until it all melted. A 
tiny stirrer and a thermometer (Unter Aufsicht der 
Physikalisch Technischen Reichsanstalt) calibrated to 
0.1° were placed into the melted fatty acid. The test 
tube with the fatty acid, thermometer, and stirrer, was 
placed into the air jacket which was immersed in the 
water bath, the temperature of which was not more than 
three degrees below that of the liquid fatty acid. A

mechanical stirrer kept the water at a uniform temp¬ 
erature throughout, and a calibrated thermometer recorded 
its temperature. The whole was allowed to cool,and while 
stirring, the time and temperature at every half minute 
was recorded. The temperature fell gradually until super¬ 
cooling induced crystallization. Precautions were taken 
to prevent excessive supercooling, otherwise the heat 
set free would not suffice to bring the temperature to 
the equilibrium point, and to compensate for the losses 
of radiation. The maximum to which the temperature rose 
after the beginning of crystallization was taken as the 
freezing point of the substance. Then mixtures of two 
fatty acids were made up and their freezing points 
determined in a similar manner. Each freezing point 
given is the result of several readings, and the maximum 
error in the reproduction of the freezing points was 
0.05°. It should be noted that the freezing points in 
Tables (1) - (6) represent definite temperatures and are 
quite different from the usual capillary melting point 
ranges which are ordinarily quoted as criteria of purity.

DISCU SSION. 

Curve (1) which shows the freezing points of 
mixtures of palmitic and stearic acids, possesses a 
transition point which clearly indicates the formation 
of a compound. Since the compound decomposes at or near 
its melting point, it is difficult to state its exact 
composition, hut it appears to he very close to an ecui- 
molecular mixture of the two fatty acids. The eutectic 
temperature for palmitic and stearic acids is 54.6°at a 
composition of 71.0 mol per cent of palmitic acid and 
29.0 mol per cent of stearic acid. At the transition 
point and at the eutectic, the temperature, after cryst¬ 
allization was induced by supercooling, remained constant 
for a considerable time. 

Curves (4) and (5) show the freezing points 
of mixtures of myristic and lauric, and palmitic and 
myristic acids respectively. The curves are of the same 
shape as Curve (1), both indicating clearly compound 
formation at an equimolecular mixture of the two acids. 
The eutectic temperature for myristic and lauric acids 
is 34.0° C at a composition of 74.0 mol per cent of 






- ( 30 ) - 

lauric acid and 26.0 mol per cent of myristic acid. The 
eutectic temperature for palmitic and myristic acids is 
44.8° C at a composition of 71.0 mol per cent of myristic 
acid and 29.0 mol per cent of palmitic acid. 

Curves (2) , (3) , and (6) show the freezing 
points of mixtures of stearic and myristic, stearic and 
lauric, and palmitic and lauric acids respectively. The 
curves are of an altogether different form. There is no 
transition point and therefore no compound formation. 
That there is nc;compound formation in these cases is 
further confirmed by studying the cooling curves. Since 
at the transition point a new compound is formed, a mix¬ 
ture of this composition will show a horizontal part of 
the curve ( DE fig. 1 ) in the cooling curve, i. e. the 
mixture behaves like a pure substance. Experimentally 
no mixtures represented by Curves (2) , (3) , and (6) 
behaved as pure substances except mixtures at their 
eutectic points. Special care was taken in studying 
equimolecular mixtures of these fatty acids, but in each 
of these three mixtures of different fatty acids there 
was no evidence for compound formation. The eutectic 






- ( 31 ) - 


temperature for stearic and myristic acids is 46.3° G 
at a composition of 20.0 mol per cent stearic acid and 
go.0 mol per cent myristic acid. The eutectic temperature 
for stearic and lauric acids is 37.5° C at a composition 
of 39.0 mol per cent lauric acid and 11.0 mol per cent 
stearic acid. The eutectic temperature for palmitic and 
lauric acids is 35.3° C at a composition oi 31*0 mol per 
cent lauric acid and 19.0 mol per cent palmitic acid. 

The binary system for palmitic and lauric acids 
has been done by P. Waentig and G. Pescheck " in 1919. 
They reported a transition point showing compound form¬ 
ation at an equimolecular mixture of the two fatty acids 
It was observed that the melting points of the fatty 
acids that they used were about 1.5^ C lower than the 
melting points of the fatty acids used in this work. 
Therefore the work for the binary system was repeated 
and there was no evidence for compound formation found. 
Special precautions were taken when working with this 
binary system. The error therefore in the work of Waenti 
and Pescheck may lie in the impurity of the fatty acids. 

5 

Curve (7) represents the freezing points of 







- ( 32 ) - 

mixtures of palmitic and margaric acids. There is no 
eutectic temperature. The two fatty acids form a series 
of solid solutions. It would therefore he very difficult 
to separate two such fatty acids by recrystallization. 

This work and the work of Shriner, Fulton, and 
Burke 5 shows that in the fatty acid binary systems, 
there are three types of curves. The type with a trans¬ 
ition point and a eutectic (Curves (1), (4), and (5). ), 
the type with a eutectic alone (Curves (2), (3)! and 
(6). ), and the type with no eutectic and no transition 
point (Curve (7). ). It is interesting to note that when 
the difference in the number of carbon atoms of the two 
fatty acids forming the binary system is one, we get a 
continuous curve. 5 (Curve (7). ). When the difference 
in the number of carbon atoms is two, then the curve 
consists of a transition point and a eutectic. (Curves 
(1), (4), and (5). ). When the difference in the number 
of carbon atoms is four or six, then the curve has a 
eutectic alone. (Curves (2), (3), and (6). ). It would 
be interesting to try out binary systems of odd numbered 
carbon atom fatty acids to see if the behavior is the 






























7 























rt 

























(.33 ) - 


same as with the even numbered carbon atom fatty acids. 

The relationship between the melting points of 
the pure acids, compounds, and mixtures is shown in 
Tables (7) and (8).

Cooling curves in the determination of the 

criteria of purity of fatty acids have their limitations 

in the fact that compounds and eutectics hehave as pure 

substances. It is clearly seen from Tables (?) and (8) 

how the eutectic mixture of stearic and palmitic acids 

may be mistaken for myristic acid, also the equimolecular 

mixture of palmitic and stearic for margaric acid. The 

freezing points of the mixtures will be a few degrees 

5 

lower than the capillary melting points. An equi¬ 
molecular mixture of palmitic and myristic acids may be 
easily mistaken for tridecylic acid. Other similar 
examples may be found in the tables. Therefore the 
cooling curve or melting point is not conclusive enough 
evidence for the purit^r of a fatty acid. In such cases, 
the neutral equivalents as described in the previous 





( 35 ) - 


paper are more conclusive evidence for the purity of 
fatty acids. 

C ONCLUSION. 

Binary systems of some fatty acids have been 
studied. It was' found that binary mixtures of stearic 
and palmitic, palmitic and myristic, and myristic and 
1auric acids show a transition point and a eutectic 
point. Binary mixtures of stearic and lauric, stearic 
and myristic, and lauric and palmitic acids show only 
an eutectic point and no transition point.

ELEC T RON E GATIVITY O F OR G ANIC RADI CALS. 

A study of the electronegativity of organic 
radicals is of much importance from the standpoint of 
the electronic conception of valence. The information 
can also be used advantageously in the interpretation 
of a number of baffling organic reactions. 

There are various means employed for represent¬ 
ing the carbon to carbon linkages. Among them are the 
Kekule bond, the polar bond, the Stark—Lewis bond, and 
Kharasch's extension of the Stark-Lewis idea. The theory 
of valence advanced by Lewis ^ points the way to fruit¬ 
ful representation of a carbon to carbon linkage. It is 
the basis of the Lewis concept that two electrons lying 
between the two atomic nuclei, constitute the chemical 
bond, and that the pair of electrons may be so placed 
with reference to the two nuclei as to give rise to no 
electrical polarization, or may be displaced in the 










- ( 37 ) - 


direction of one nucleus or the other to give to the 
one atom a negative charge and to the other a positive 
charge. These possibilities are indicated by Lewis in 
the following manner: 

(1) A : E (2) A : E (3) A : E 

In any case it is to be considered that the atoms A and E 
continue to share the bonding pair, and that only in the 
extreme case exemplified by an ionizing compound does 
one atom completely carjture the pair at the expense of 
the other. 

Electronegativity of a radical Is defined as 
the affinity of that radical for the pair of valence 
electrons. The attraction of the radical for the pair of 
valence electrons is a function of the electronic struct¬ 
ure of the molecule, and thus arises the difference of 
electronegativity of organic radicals. In order to make 
effective use of this concept it is necessary to devise 
'some means of determining the relative electronegativ¬ 
ities of organic radicals. That accomplished, we would 
have at hand a table comparable in utility to the 




. 

: ; 








- ( 38 ) - 


“electromotive series" vrhich systematised the early 
chaos of inorganic chemistry. It is obvious, that since 
in dealing with radicals which, for the most part, are 
incapable of becoming ions, that the elegantly exact 
quantitative method of determining inorganic electro¬ 
negativities, is inapplicable to organic radicals. 

13 S 

Kharasch and Sher extend the Lewis concept. 
As will be seen, numerous variations of the types of 
union indicated by Lewis are possible. These possibil¬ 
ities may be expressed most conveniently in terms of 
the Bohr concept of electronic energy levels. 















< 

, 

*

- ( 39 ) - 

The two carbon atoms can share a pair of electrons at the 
intersection of their inner shells (corresponding presum¬ 
ably to bond (1) of Lewis), or at the intersection of 
inner shell (1) of one and the outer shell (4) of the 
other, thus leading to polarization, or the reverse may 
be true. It is however also conceivable that the pair 
of valence electrons may be shared in the outer layers 
of the two carbon atoms, namely shell (4) of one and 
shell (4) of the other, as denoted by the dark rectangles 
of Pig. 1. 

Undoubtedly, two atoms or radicals that share 
a pair of valence electrons in their outer shells have 
a very slight attraction for the electrons, consequently 
the compound is unstable. The figure only indicates suf¬ 
ficient number of energy levels to illustrate conven¬ 
iently the concept of Kharasch. Electrons shared in the 
first energy levels of A and E (1,1 energy levels) con¬ 
stitute a non-polar and highly stable bond. It is typical 
of compounds like diphenyl. Electrons shared in the 
second energy levels of A and B (2,2 energy levels) con¬ 
stitute a strictly non-polar bond. This is however, less 



- ( 40 ) - 

stable than the first one discussed. Ethane may be cited 
as an illustration. Electrons shared in the third and 
fourth energy levels respectively, are also non-polar, 
but represent successively decreasing degrees of stab¬ 
ility. These illustrations demonstrate that the primary 
criteria of stability of a carbon to carbon bond is not 
its polarity or non-polarity, but the affinity of the 
bound radicals for the binding electrons. 

Now consider that A represents a radical capable 
of extreme electronegativity (such as the chloride) and 
that B represents an organic radical. We may then say, 
that the black circles (1 energy level of A and 2 energy 
level of B) represent an electron pair shared by a chlor¬ 
ide radical and a highly electronegative organic radical 
such as the phenyl or naphthyl radical. The white circles 
(1 energy level of A and 3 energy level of B) represent 
an electron pair shared by a chloride and a moderately 
electronegative organic radical such as methyl. The 
diamonds (1 energy level of A and 4 energy level of E) 
represent a bonding pair of electrons shared by a chlor¬ 
ide and a weakly electronegative organic radical such as 





- ( 41 ) - 


the triphenyl methyl. These bonds increase in the degree 
of polarity in the order named. The bonds decrease in 
stability as the degree of polarity increases. It may be 
stated that a low degree of affinity for electrons ( i.e. 
electronegativity) on the part of a radical results in 
instability of the bond which that radical may form with 
another radical or atom, regardless of the polarity of 
the bond thus formed. 

METHOD OF ESTABLISHING F.SLATiyS ELgCTHOMEGATI VI TIES 

2051MIP-1ADICALS. 

Kharasch and Grafflin, 1 ^ Kharasch and Marker, 
Kharasch and Beinmuth, 1 ~ ) and Kharasch and Reinmuth ^ 
established experimentally the relative electronegativ¬ 
ities of many organic radicals. Their method of approach 
was by coupling two organic radicals R* and R'* whose 
electronegativity was to be compared, with bivalent 
mercury and then treating with hydrochloric acid. The 
following equation represents the reaction: 

H* HgR ’ ' + H + C1~ —> R* H gCl + R ' * H . 


The more electronegative of the two radicals, 


R* and R*', 





- ( 42 ) - 


- 4 " 

combines with H to form the corresponding hydrocarbon. 
Thus by identifying the products of decomposition, the 
relative electronegativity of organic radicals R* and R 91 
is established. The above mentioned workers compared 
the electronegativities of many radicals and from their 
work drew up a table of decreasing electronegativities 
of organic radicals. 

In this work, an attempt has been made to est¬ 
ablish the relative electronegativity of organic radicals 
by an altogether different method of approach. The two 
organic radicals E* and R 99 , are coupled with an iodonturn 
bromide radical, and then decomposed. The following 
reaction takes place: 


R 9 

\ 

R 9 9 ^ 


I — Br 


heat 


R'l + R 9 9 Er 


Here it is plausible to assume that the bromine being 
itself highly electronegative will go to the organic 
radical which is less electronegative of the two. Thus 
if R** is less electronegative than R 9 , then on heating 
the compound R , R ,9 IEr, we should get R*I and R 9, Er. 










- ( 43 ) - 


The purpose of this investigation therefore, 
was first, to prepare the compound R , R' , IEr, and secondly, 
to decompose it, and examine the products of decomp¬ 
osition, thus confirming the order of electronegativity 
of the organic radicals as established by Kharasch and 
his collaborators. 

PQ 2 1 , 

Hartman and Meyer and Willgerodt have 
prepared symmetrical iodonium compounds by allowing 
equmolecular mixtures of the iodoxy-benzene and iodoso- 
benzene to react with moist silver hydroxide. In this 
work an unsymmetrical iodonium compound was prepared in 
the same way.

Pre paration o f p-Methox y-phenyl Iodide. 

One gram molecular weight of anisidine was 
treated with two and one half gram molecular weights of 
hydrochloric acid. After cooling the mixture to 0°C , 
the solution was diazotized with one gram molecular 
weight of sodium nitrite, and then treated with one gram 
molecular weight of potassium iodide. The solution was

warmed, and when the evolution of gas was complete, it 
was made alkaline and then steam distilled. The oily 
layer in the distillate was separated, dried, and dis¬ 
tilled. The distillate, on cooling, solidified to a pale 
hrown cake. 

Preparat ion o f p -Methoxy-i odoso-ben z ene . 

The p-methoxy-phenyl iodide was dissolved in 
four times its weight of chloroform, cooled, and chlorine 
gas passed into it. The solid p-methoxy-phenyl iodide 
dichloride which separated, was filtered off, and treated 
with a solution of sodium hydroxide immediately. (4 g. of 
water and .5 g. of sodium hydroxide for every gram of 
p-methoxy-phenyl iodide dichloride.) It was found that 
the p-methoxy-phenyl iodide dichloride is very unstable 
and therefore, immediate treatment with sodium hydroxide 
is necessary. After allowing to stand in contact with 
sodium hydroxide overnight, the p-methoxv-iodoso-benzene 
was filtered off and washed free of sodium hydroxide.

Some p-methoxy-phenyl iodide distilled over with steam, 
while the p-methoxy-iodoxy-benzene remained behind as an 
orange solid* Enough hot water was added to dissolve the 
orange solid. On cooling the feathery p-methoxy-iodoxy- 
benzene came down. The yield was low. 

p re p ara tion o f o- Chloro - phe n yl I odide * 

The o-chloro-phenyl iodide was prepared from 
o-chloro-aniline by diazotization, and treatment with 
potassium iodide as described in the preparation of 
p-methoxy-phenyl iodide. The o-chlcro-phenyl iodide dis- 
tilled over at -804 C as a brown colored liquid. 

Prepa ra tio n of o-C hloro-iod oso-benzene. 

The o-chloro-iodoso-benzene was prepared from 
the o-chloro-phenyl iodide going through the o-chloro- 
phenyl iodide dichloride as described in the preparation 
of p-methoxy-iodoso-henzene.

benzene, o-chloro-iodoso-benzene, and freshly prepared 
silver hydroxide were well mixed. The o-chloro-iodoso- 
benzene was added in slight excess. To the mixture a few 
cc. of chloroform, and water, was added. The mixture was 
shaken well in a stoppered flask and allowed to stand 
for twenty-four hours. The liquid was filtered off, 
several water extractions from the residue made, and the 
combined filtrate treated with potassium bromide. A white 
flocculent precipitate resulted. The p-methoxy-phenyl 
o-chloro-phenyl iodonium bromide was recrystallized 
from water. The following reactions take place:

THE DECOMPOSITION OF p-METHOXY-PHENYL o-CHLORO-PHENYL 
IODOIIIUM gROMI Dg7 _AND THE IDENTIFICATION OF~THE PRODUCTS 

of~decq mposI T 10 if . ' 

The dry p-methoxy-phenyl o-chloro-phenyl 
iodonium bromide was heated in a test tube in an arochlor 
bath* Decomposition was quite sharp at 165°C. The whole 
mass became a dark colored liquid* The products of de¬ 
composition were then identified. The dark colored 
liquid was distilled, obtaining two fractions, one at 
200 - 210°C, the other at 210 - 235°C. The second fract¬ 
ion solidified on cooling, but the first remained a 
liquid. The solid fraction was recrystallized from al¬ 
cohol and the melting point of the product was 4S°C, 
that of pure p-methoxy-phenyl iodide is 50° C. Then a 
mixture of pure p-methoxy-phenyl iodide and the purified 
second fraction was made and the melting point of the 
mixture determined. There was no lowering of the melting 
point indicating that the two compounds were the same. 
The boiling points recorded in the literature of 
p-methoxy-phenyl iodide and o-chloro-phenyl bromide 
are 237 C and 204°C respectively. This is further evid¬ 
ence for the compounds. At present, still further work 






- ( 48 ) - 

is being done to confirm the products of decomposition. 


The yield of the p-methoxy—phenyl o-chloro-phenyl 
iodonium bromide was small, and it was necessary to 
work on a micro scale. 

CONCLUSIONS. 

The compound p-methoxy-phenyl o-chloro-phenyl 
iodonium bromide has been prepared. From the work that 
has been done so far, evidence points in the direction 
to confirm the findings of Kharasch and his collaborat¬ 
ors.
