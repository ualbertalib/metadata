Abstract 


This thesis embodies the results of an investiga¬ 
tion of a dark brown clay shale bed, hereafter called the 
Dark Zone, which occurs over a wide area of Alberta in the 
Edmonton formation• Occurring within the dark zone is a 
thin tuff horizon known as the Kneehills Tuff 0 A study 
was also made of a white, highly argillaceous sandstone, 
hereafter called the White Zone, which underlies the Dark 
Zone. The investigation first involved a review of the 
literature on the subjects of clay mineralogy and the 
alteration products of tuff, the main points of which are 
summarized. 

The laboratory investigations showed the Dark Zone 
to be composed of iron-rich montmorillonite, with minor 
amounts of calcite, quartz and low-iron montmorillonite. 

The White Zone was shown to consist mainly of quartz, 
montmorillonite, and another clay mineral, probably 
kaolinite. Studies on the Kneehills Tuff showed it to 
be altering to bentonite, but studies on other bentonites 
failed to provide any evidence that they are of volcanic 
origin. 

It is concluded that the Dark Zone probably 
represents a decomposed tuff, bands of which escaped 
alteration, or, less probably, a normal fresh water 
shale. The White Zone is believed to have been deposited on 
an alluvial plain.

INTRODUCTION 


The Problem 

This thesis embodies the results of an investigation 
of a dark clay shale bed occurring over a wide area of 
Alberta in the Edmonton formation of Upper Cretaceous 
age. The main purpose of the investigation was to deter¬ 
mine whether there is any relationship between the shale 
and a thin zone of volcanic tuff, known as the Kneehills 
tuff, which it containso 

The investigation was undertaken at the suggestion 
of Dr. R. L 0 Rutherford in the hope that some evidence as 
to the manner in which volcanic tuff decomposes might be 
obtained. Bentonite, which is alleged to form from the 
decomposition of volcanic tuff is prevalent in the Upper 
Cretaceous sediments of the Alberta plains, yet the 
Kneehills Tuff is the only widespread tuff zone known. 
Accordingly, it was felt that a study of the clays assoc¬ 
iated with the Kneehills Tuff might throw some light on 
the whole problem of pyroclastics in Alberta.

clay analysis and their interpretation 0 Mr. C. A. Noble 
of the Industrial Laboratory, University of Alberta, 
kindly made an analysis of iron and Mr. W. H. A. Clow 
of the Research Council of Alberta donated several clay 
specimens. 

Previous Work 

Since the Edmonton formation was named by Selwyn 
in 1873, many geologists have worked on it. However, 
their efforts were mainly concentrated on mapping or on 
studies of the coal seams which the formation contains. 
Detailed studies by Allan and Sanderson ( 5 )Sternberg 
(53,54), Rutherford (48), and Ower (37), have resulted 
in considerable clarification of the lithology and age 
of the formation. Other workers, notably Fumival (11) 
and Russell(43, 46, 47) have added much to our knowledge 
of the Edmonton equivalents in the Cypress Hills and 
their correlation with the Central Alberta section. 

The first to identify the Kneehills tuff as a tuff 
was J. 0. G. Sanderson who was also responsible for naming 
it. Since then, Sanderson has noted many tuffs in 
Alberta (30). 

However, nobody has yet attempted to determine the 
origin of the dark shale horizon. Most reports merely 
describe it as a dark coloured bentonitic shale, and

some claim it may be of marine origin (49) 

Stratigraphy 

Sanderson (3) has divided the Edmonton formation 
into three members* The lower member includes all beds 
up to the top of a tongue of marine arenaceous limestone 
in the Drumheller area. The middle member consists of 
beds above the marine horizon up to and including the 
dark shale bed discussed in this report, and the upper 
member consists of the remainder of the formation. The 
upper member contains a vertebrate Triceratops fauna of 
Lance age; the lower and middle members contain a pre- 
Lance fauna. The upper member overlies the middle member 
with apparent conformity. 

Erom field observations and examination of well logs, 
Ower (37) has divided the Edmonton into five members on 
the basis of lithology. Member A and the lower part of 
member B are equivalent to the lower member of Sanderson; 
the upper part of member B and members C and D are equiv¬ 
alent to the middle member, and member E is equivalent to 
the upper member. It is with member D, designated by Ower 
as the Kneehills Tuff horizon that this report is con¬ 
cerned. Member D consists of dark brown, bentonitic clay

shale containing tuff beds, underlain by a white, 
bentonitic argillaceous sandstone* 

In general, the Edmonton formation consists of 
poorly indurated shales, clays, and argillaceous felds- 
pathic siltstones and sandstones. Characteristic 
features of the formation are its highly bentonitic 
nature, numerous coal seams and beds of iron concre¬ 
tions. On the basis of the lithology, the lenticular 
nature of many of the beds and large scale crossbedding, 
Sanderson (3) has postulated a deltaic origin for the 
entire formation,, Sternberg (33) has subsequently pointed 
out that the upper member is less feldspathic, better 
sorted and coarser grained than the middle and lower 
members. He suggests that this member may have been laid 
down under sub-aerial conditions rather similar to those 
under which the overlying Paskapoo was deposited. If 
Sternberg is correct, the dark shales probably represent 
the transition between two different conditions of depos¬ 
ition. They are unlike any other sediments in the entire 
formation and their origin presents a problem of unique 
interest. 

The dark shale under discussion is a poorly indurated, 
somewhat bentonitic, dark brown clay shale occurring in a 
thirty to forty foot bed over an area extending from the 
Wintering Hills in the south, to Whitecourt on the

Athabasca River in the north. The colour of the beds 
varies from very dark brown to grey brown. 

The Kneehills Tuff may occur at any horizon witMn 
the shale, but is usually found toward the top near 
Edmonton, and toward the base farther south. The dark 
shale has not yet been named, but since it seems inadvis¬ 
able to assign a name to it at this time, it will be ref¬ 
erred to as the "Dark Zone” for the purpose of this report. 

Underlying the Dank Zone is a bed of white, highly 
argillaceous, somewhat bentonitic, fine grained sandstone 
of variable thickness end grain size. For the purpose of 
'this report, these beds will be referred to as the "White 
Zone". 

Beds which are similar to the above described section 
occur in the Cypress Hills in southeastern Alberta (11). 

Here, the Frenchman formation, containing a Triceratops 
fauna of Lance age is underlain d is conformably by dark 
brown to olive green, poorly indurated, bentonitic clay 
shales known as the Battle formation. A thin bed of 
volcanic tuff occurs near the base of the Battle. Sender- 
son had samples of tuff from the Battle formation and the 
Dark zone analyzed end found their composition to be almost 
identical (3). Underlying the Battle is a series of white, 
kaolinitic clays, silts and silty clays known as the Whitemud 
formation. The Frenchman has been correlated, with the upper 
member of the Edmonton on palaeontological evidence (53).

On the basis of lithology and stratigraphic position, 
the Battle is correlated with the Dark Zone and the 
Whitemud is correlated with the White Zone (3,11). 

On the basis of stratigraphic position and lith¬ 
ology, the Whitemud formation has been correlated with 
the Colgate member of the Fox Hills formation in Montana 
and the Dakotas (10) 0 The Colgate consists of white, 
argillaceous sandstone, similar to the Whitemud, and is 
overlain by the Hell Creek member of the Lance formation 
(9). The Hell Creek consists of sombre-coloured sandstones 
and grey to brown shales, often carbonaceous. The basal 
beds of the Hell Creek may be sandstone or shale. 

Furnival (11) correlates the Hell Creek with the Franchman, 
since they both contain a Triceratops fauna. In those 
sections where the basal beds of the Hell Creek are shale, 
they may represent the equivalent of the Battle formation, 
or they may represent a different facies from the sand¬ 
stone which commonly makes up the basal beds® 

The locality from which the material used in this 
thesis was obtained is about thirty miles southwest of 
Edmonton and is marked on the sketch map of Alberta 
(figure 1) as locality 1. A detailed section of the Dark 
Zone and White Zone at this locality and the numbers of 
the samples taken are as follows:

The Kneehills Tuff 

The Kneehills Tuff horizon usually consists of from 
two to four beds of tuff, averaging about 6 inches in 
thickness, occurring within a zone of five or six feet. 

In the Cypress Hills and in the Drumheller area, the tuff 
occurs near the base of the Dark Zone, but farther north 
it is near the top. Although individual tuff beds are 
not continuous, tuff is rarely absent.

In the section sampled for this study, three beds 

of tuff were found, each overlain by light coloured 

bentonite which graded up into the normal dark brown 

shale of the Dark Zone. These field relationships 

indicate that the tuff has partly altered to bentonite. 

The tuff is a hard, light grey, fine-grained 

massive rock, occasionally showing traces of bedding.

The outstanding feature of the analysis is the high 
silica content, probably due in part to secondary silica 
filling the pores of the ash. 

Sanderson (3) describes the microscopic character¬ 
istics of the tuff as follows: "Microscopically, this 
rock is seen to be made up of minute, fresh mineral frag¬ 
ments, quartz and feldspar mainly, with varying proportions 
of altered glass, all set in a felty groundmass which is 
isotropic to dimly anisotropic. It is thought that the 
groundmass is made up essentially of devitrified glass 
along with minute masses of fibres of redeposited chalce- 
donic or opaline silica. In the thin section conclusive

tests of the matrix matter cannot be made. The presence 
of vesicular, partly altered glass becomes apparent on 
close observations at high magnifications in thin sections. 
The characteristic shapes of glass T chards f ; long, stringy 
fragments, crescentic bits or angular particles showing 
reentrant angles, may be noted among the grains that remain 

isotropic under crossed nicols.The larger fragments 

average from 0.03 to 0.05 mm in diameter, and grade from 
this down to sub-microscopic sizes. The rock is commonly 
vuggy, the vugs being either filled or lined with chalcedony

The origin of the tuff is uncertain, but there are 
two possibilities. The ash may have come from volcanic 
vents in the mountains to the west, or it may have come 
from Montana, where great thicknesses of andesite tuff 
and a minor amount of dacite occur at a horizon strati- 
graphically equivalent to the Edmonton formation (38,55)* 

The first theory of origin has one drawback. No 
volcanic rocks have been found in the Rocky Mountains 
except for the Crowsnest Volcanics, which is a thick series 
of flows and agglomerates occurring at the base of the upper 
Cretaceous. Possibly, later volcanics have been eroded 
away or concealed by overlying Tertiary rocks. 

The mountains west of the Rockies showed strong 
volcanic activity throughout Tertiary time (4), and may 
have been the source of the Kneehills tuff, if volcanism 
started earlier than is believed. In the foothills west

of Edmonton, a sixteen foot bed of tuff occurs in the 
Saunders formation, which is Upper Cretaceous and 
Palaeocene in age(3)<> If this tuff is the equivalent 
of t he Kneehills tuff, the source of the tuff probably 
lies somewhere to the westo 

If the tuff came from Montana, it originally had 
an andesitic, or, less probably, a dacitic composition. 

Plan of Present Study 

The present study began under a strong disadvantage 
because the writer knew very little about the study of 
shales and had no previous work to use as a guide. Further¬ 
more, research facilities for the study of such material 
were not available at the University of Alberta® 

The main part of the investigation was the study of 
the Dark Zone. The first step taken was to separate out 
the coarse fraction from each shale sample by dispersion 
in water and decantation of the fine fraction. The most 
effective method of dispersion was found to be soaking 
the shale in water overnight, stirring, and decanting the 
resulting suspension. After several such decantations, 
the remaining shale fragments were dispersed by rubbing 
them gently between the fingers. The coarse particles 
were then examined under the petrographic microscope and 
binocular microscope. 

Following this, the fine fractions were examined 
with the limited facilities available. This study involved

a review of the literature on the subject of clay mineral¬ 
ogy, a summary of which is given in the next chapter. The 
laboratory studies on this phase of the work included 
optical studies and dye tests. A key clay mineral which 
could not be identified without special apparatus was 
sent to the University of Illinois for identification. 

The next part of the study was an examination of 
the Kneehills Tuff with special reference to its alter¬ 
ation. Again, this involved a review of the literature, 
the results of which are summarized in Chapter 3 . The 
laboratory investigation on this part of the problem 
involved a stufy of the tuff, the associated bentonites, 
and other tuffs and bentonites from various parts of 
Alberta. 

Finally, a brief study was made on the White Zone 
in an attempt to determine its relationship to the over- 
lying Dark Zone. The procedure followed in these studies 
was much the same at that outlined for the study of the 


Dark Zone

THE CLAY MINERALS 

Introduction 

Although clays are one of the most important con¬ 
stituents of the earth’s crust, their mineralogical 
composition was virtually unknown thirty years ago. The 
main reason for this lag was the difficulty of studying 
the clays due to the sub-microscopic size of their con¬ 
stituent particles® However, with the recent development 
of research tools such as X-ray and differential thermal 
analysis, a reasonable understanding of the mineralogical 
composition of clay has been obtained. 

Grim (15) has pointed out that the term clay as 
used today carries three implications: 

(1) A natural material with plastic properties® 

(2) An essential composition of particles of 

very fine size grades® 

(3) An essential composition of crystalline 

fragments of minerals that are essentially 
hydrous aluminum silicates, or occasionally 
hydrous iron or magnesium silicates® 

The foregoing definition is not based on origin, but 
on the properties, texture and composition of the material® 

Most clay minerals possess excellent basal cleavage, 
therefore they occur in the form of flake-shaped particles® 
The plasticity of wet clays is caused by thin films of 
water surrounding each flake.

Clays invariably contain some impurity, usually in 
the fine size grades. The chief impurities found in clays 
are quartz, amorphous silica, cristobalite, chlorite, iron 
oxides, aluminum oxides, sulphides, organic matter, carbon¬ 
ates, titanium oxide and micas. These impurities affect the 
properties of the clsy , thus rendering the study of the clays 
more difficult. 

Clay mineral study is further complicated by the 
fact that different clay minerals can occur in mixed layers, 
each having a thickness approaching the order of one unit 
cell. Thus, material which appears to be a single mineral 
species often proves to be a mixture. 

Clay minerals have been divided into a number of 
groups which are as follows: the kaolin -halloysite group, 
sometimes divided into the kaolin group and the halloysite 
group; the montmorilIonite group; the illite group; the 
attapulgite group and allophane. These groups are sub¬ 
divided into species which will be discussed after a con¬ 
sideration of the lattice structures of clay minerals 
and a brief discussion of the property of base exchange. 

One point which is not usually stressed about clay 
minerals is that they are not stable, but undergo diagen¬ 
esis upon change of environment (16). Different environ¬ 
ments produce different clay minerals, and it is fairly 
safe to say that when more is known about clay minerals, 
their study will be of great value in determining geological 
environments.

Lattice Structures of the Clay Minerals 

The lattice structure of the clay minerals is still 
not completely known, hut all workers seem to be agreed on 
the main features<> Clay mineral lattices are believed to 
be built up of the same unit groups as all silicates, 
namely tetrahedrons and octahedrons ( 15 )* 

In general, clay minerals have planar structures 
which determine their basal cleavage<> There are two com¬ 
ponents involved in all clay lattices* The first is a 
double sheet of oxygen atoms enclosing smaller atoms of 
aluminum, each of which is equidistant from six oxygen 
atoms. Since the oxygens surrounding each aluminum are 
located at the corners of an imaginary octahedron, the 
aluminum is described as having octahedral co-ordination. 
Actually, only two-thirds of the possible positions between 
the oxygen sheets are filled by aluminum, so that each 
oxygen has one unsatisfied valence bond. This bond may be 
satisfied by a hydrogen atom, so that a hydroxyl group is 
present rather than an oxygen, or by linkage to a silicon 
atom in the adjacent silica sheet. 

The silica sheet makes up the second component of 
the lattice of clay minerals. It consists of silicon atoms, 
around each of which is grouped four oxygen atoms in the 
form of a tetrahedron* Three of these oxygens are in the 
silica sheet; the fourth is in the adjacent alumina sheet. 
The resulting Si 04 groups are arranged in a hexagonal net-

and tetrahedral silica groups are given in figures 3 and

Base Exchange 

The structural units just described have completely 
satisfied valences. However, unsatisfied charges are usually 
present, being formed by breakage of the lattice at flake 
edges or by replacement of tetrahedral silica and octahedral 
alumina by ions of lower valence* The unsatisfied valences 
thus developed are satisfied by alkali or alkaline earth 
cations held at the edge of the lattice structure. Certain 
of these alkali ions are held in preference to others, but 
the preferred ions are not always available when the clay 
is formedo Therefore, the clay adsorbs whatever bases are 
available at the time. If a solution containing preferred 
ions later comes in contact with the clay, the preferred 
ions are adsorbed by the clay and the ions formerly held 
by the clay go into solution. This phenomenon is known as 
base exchange. 

In general, the following is the order in which the 
ions are preferrentially held: H, Ba, Sr, Ca, Mg, Cs, Rb, 

K, Na, Li. There are slight variations in this order between 
groups of clay minerals. 

The base exchange capacity of clays is usually 
expressed as milliequivalents of exchangeable base per 100 
grams of clay, the base being stated in the oxide form. The

The Kaolin Group 

The minerals of the kaolin group are kaolinite, 
anauxite, nacrite, dickifce, halloysite and endellite, all 
of which have the approximate chemical formula 2 Si 02 0 AI 2 O- 5 . 

2 K 2 O. A platy habit is characteristic for the group, but 
halloysite and endellite have a lath-like habit. 

The most important member of the kaolin group is 
kaolinite, a prominent constituent of clays, soils and 
shales. It is formed by the prolonged leaching of feldspars 
and feldspathic rocks under neutral or slightly acid con¬ 
ditions. A warm climate, low potassium concentration and 
heavy rainfall are favorable for the formation of kaolinite 
(28). Anauxite, the high silica form of kaolinite, is formed 
under somewhat similar conditions. 

Nacrite and dickite, both comparitively rare minerals, 
are formed by the action of hydrothermal solutions on felds¬ 
pars or feldspathic rocks. Occasionally, kaolinite may be formed 
under these conditions. Halloysite is a very fine-grained 
mineral also formed by the leaching of feldspars or feldspathic 
rocks under acid or neutral conditions (44). Sulphuric acid

solutions liberated by the weathering of sulphides favor 
the formation of halloysite 0 Endellite, sometimes called 
metahalloysite, is the hydrated form of halloysite* 

The lattice structures of all minerals of the kaolin 
group are similar to the structure of kaolinite, which is 
shown in figure 5° The kaolinite lattice is made up of one 
tetrahedral silica sheet and one octahedral alumina sheet* 

The charges on one layer of oxygen in the octahedral alumina 
sheet are satisfied by hydrogen* Two-thirds of the charges 
on the other layer are satisfied by linkage to silicon atoms 
and the other one-third are satisfied by hydrogen* 

All charges in the lattice are completely balanced 
and lattice replacement does not take place. Therefore, 
kaolinite and other members of the group show little variation 
in chemical composition and do not undergo base exchange to 
a marked degree. 

The other members of the kaolinite group also have 
one silica sheet and one alumina sheet in their lattice, 
but are believed to vary from kaolinite in the way the sheets 
are tied together or in the configuration of one sheet with 
respect to the other (22). X-ray analyses show some varia¬ 
tion in lattice spacing between various members of the group* 

The Montmorillonite Group 

Since this report is chiefly concerned with the mont¬ 
morillonite minerals, more space will be devoted to a con¬ 
sideration of this group than to other clay minerals.

The montmorillonites are a group of variable chemical 
composition characterized by high base exchange capacity 
and the ability to hold sheets of water between lattice 
units. The approximate chemical formula for montmorillonite, 
the main member of the group is AI 2 O 5 .4Si0 2 .HgO* 

Montmorillonites are common constituents in soils and 
in clays derived from the decomposition of pyroclastic 
material, but are said to be uncommon in marine sediments 
(39)* In general, they form from the same materials as 
kaolinite, but under different conditions<, Whereas pro¬ 
longed leaching of feldspathic rocks in an acid or neutral 
environment will produce kaolinite, slightly basic conditions 
and poor drainage will produce montmorillonite. Reducing 
conditions, the presence of certain alkalis or alkaline 
earths, especially magnesium, and the presence of iron favor 
the formation of montmorillonite minerals (28) 0 Their form¬ 
ation is inhibited by the presence of potassium, which may be 
why montmorillonites are not common in marine sediments. 
Volcanic glass appears to alter to montmorillonite fairly 
readily (20). The iron and magnesium-rich members of the 
group are formed from basic rocks, which are rich in these 
elements® 

The minerals of the montmorillonite group are mont¬ 
morillonite, beidellite, nontronite, hectorite, saponite, 
volchonskite and sauconite. These species are believed to 
form one or more isomorphous series, the different species 
resulting from substitutions within the lattice rather than

from variations in the lattice structure,, Most members of 
the group have a platy habit, but hectorite and nontronite 
occur in lath-shaped particles. 

Whereas the kaolin group have only two sheets in the 
lattice, the montmorillonites have three, being made up of 
an alumina sheet sandwiched between two silica sheets. One 
third of the oxygen atoms in both oxygen layers of the 
alumina sheet are linked to hydrogens, the other two thirds 
being linked to silicon atoms in the adjacent silica sheet. 
The lattice structure of montmorillonite, the main member 
of the group is shown in figure 6. 

The successive units of the montmorillonite lattice 
are loosely held together, with water and exchangeable 
bases being held in the spaces between lattice units. Since 
there are invariably some unsatisfied charges resulting from 
replacement within the lattice, the montmorillonites have 
high base exchange capacity. Some workers claim that re¬ 
placements within the lattice are not sufficient to account 
for the high base exchange capacity of the montmorillonites. 
Furthermore, it is difficult to see how a lattice such as 
that shown in figure 6 could hold the thick layers of water 
which the montmorillonites are capable of adsorbing. To 
overcome these difficulties, Edelman and Favejee (1^) have 
proposed a modification of this structure in which every 
other tetrahedral silica group is inverted as shown in 
figure 7* The oxygens exposed by the inversion are attached

to hydrogens so that a group of hydroxyls is on the out¬ 
side of each lattice unit. These hydrogens may he 
exchangeable, and also serve to hold adsorbed water. 

Thus, base exchange is probably dependent upon 
three factors in the montmorilIonite group, namely 
unsatisfied charges due to lattice replacement, replaceable 
hydrogens on the outside of the lattice and unsatisfied 
charges due to the disruption of the lattice at broken 
flake edges. The first two factors are much more import¬ 
ant than the third. Since they are independent of part¬ 
icle size, the base exchange capacity of the montmorill- 
onites would be expected to be almost independent of 
particle size. This expectation has been confirmed 
experimentally by Hauser and Heed (lp). In the other clay 
minerals, in which base exchange is entirely due to broken 
bonds at flake edges, the base exchange should Increase with 
decreased particle size. Spiel (1.5) has confirmed this 
expectation experimentally. 

Montmorillonites never possess exactly the lattice 
shown in figure b or 7, because there is always some replace¬ 
ment of magnesium or iron for aluminum or of aluminum for 
silicon. 

In the lattice of the species montmorillonite there 
is usually some replacement of magnesium for aluminium. 
Appreciable substitution of iron for aluminum produces nontron- 
ite and partial substitution of aluminum for silicon produces 
beidellite. Montmorillonite, beidellite and nontronite are 
believed by Nagelschmidt (3>6) to form an isomorphous series.

montmorillonite (after Edelman and Fave^ee, from Grim(15) ) 































- 25 - 


Unfortunately, the nomenclature of this series has been 
confused by two factors. The name montmorillonite is 
used for a group name and for the name of a species be¬ 
longing to that group, resulting in loose usage of the 
word in some instances. Secondly, the term beidellite 
has been used for materials which are not members of the 
montmorillonite group. For example, some material which 
has been called beidellite has subsequently been shown 
to lack the power to hold water between its lattice units. 

As a result of such errors, some authors have questioned 
the validity of the species (lj?). 

Hectorite and saponite are isomorphous species in 
which magnesium has replaced aluminum, and some silicon 
has been replaced by aluminum. In hectorite, there is also 
substitution of a minor amount of lithium for aluminum and 
of fluorine for the hydrogen of hydroxyl groups. 

Volchonskite and sauconite are rare montmorillonites 
containing appreciable amounts of chromium and zinc 
respectively. 

As previously indicated, the montmorillonites are 
characterized by their ability to permit water to enter as 
sheets between lattice units, with resultant expansion of 
the lattice. If Edelman and Favejee T s structure (figure 7) 
is correct, then the adsorbed water could be tied on to the 
projecting hydroxyl groups. Unsatisfied charges due to sub¬ 
stitution within the lattice may help to hold the adsorbed 
water. In order to account for the thickness of the adsorbed 
water sheet, Hendricks and Jefferson have postulated that

the oxygen atoms of thev\ater form a regular hexagonal net¬ 
work, or, in other words, the adsorbed water possesses 
crystal structured 15 ) • 

Some investigators have postulated hydration of 
absorbed cations to explain the adsorption of water between 
lattice units* However, evidence against appreciable 
hydration has been presented for several ions, notably 
sodium (13), so that hydration of adsorbed cations is now 
believed to play a minor role in the absorption of water 
by montmorilloniteso 

There are two factors limiting the amount of water 
which caa be adsorbed between the lattice units of the 
montmorillonite minerals* Theiirst is the looseness of the 
bonds holding the water film together and the second is the 
attractive force operating between adjacent lattice units* 
The magnitude of the second factor is directly dependent 
upon the nature of the adsorbed cations which act as bridges 
binding the lattice units together* Since the second factor 
is more important than the first and since it is the only 
variable factor, the amount of water which can be absorbed 
by a montmorillonite depends upon the nature of the adsorbed 
cations* In general, larger, divalent ions bind adjacent 
lattice units together more tightly than smaller, univalent 
ions. Experimentally, montmorillonite with sodium as the 
exchangeable base has been shown to have greater adsorptive 
capacity for water than montmorillonite with calcium as the

exchangeable base (4-6) • Recent experiments (21,26), have 
shown that montmorillonite is able to adsorb large organic 
cations which bind the lattice units tightly together, 
resulting in a low adsorptive capacity for water* 

The Illite Group 

The illite group has not yet been divided into species, 
the term illite being used as a covering term for the group* 
Different species probably exist but there has not been 
sufficient data accumulated on the illites to permit their 
differentiation. The lag in the study of this very import¬ 
ant group of clays has been caused by the difficulty of 
obtaining pure specimens for study. 

The illites are a group closely related to the white 
micas* In the earlier literature, they were sometimes 
referred to as sericite, but Grim,Bray and Bradley (17) 
have shown that they possess somewhat different properties. 

The lattice structure of illite is shown in figure 8. 
The lattice is similar to that of montmorillonite with 
magnesium and iron partially substituted for aluminum, and 
aluminum partially substituted for silicon. The resulting 
unsatisfied valences are satisfied by potassium ions which 
bind the lattice units closely together, precluding the 
adsorption of inter-layer water or exchangeable bases. Some 
charges may be satisfied by substitution of hyrdoxyl for 
oxygen or by the addition of excess magnesium ions in the 
octahedral layer.

Illite forms from the weathering of feldspars under 
certain conditions (34-), from the disintegration of mus¬ 
covite, or from the alteration of montmorillonite by the 
replacement of exchangeable bases with potassium (28). In 
some cases, illite is believed to alter to montmorillonite 

(8)o 

It is interesting to note that illite is not common 
in soils, but makes up a large proportion of marine sediments. 
Presumably the potash in sea water encourages the formation 
of illite and inhibits the development of montmorillonite. 

A study of continental shales to determine their dominant 
clay mineral constituent might do much to elucidate the 
relationship of montmorillonite and illite. 

The Attapulgite Group 

Attapulgite and sepiolite, the clays of the atta- 
pulgite group are characterized by a fibrous habit. The 
lattice structure of attapulgite, as calculated by Bradley 
(6) is shown in figure 9. The lattice is related to the 
montmorillonite lattice in that it consists of an octahe¬ 
dral alumina sheet sandwiched between two tetrahedral 
silica sheets, but instead of being continuous in two directions, 
it is continuous in only one direction. In other words, the 
attapulgite lattice is fibrous rather than platy. Figure 8, 
which is a sketch at right angles to the long axis of the 
fibres shows how the fibres are held together. 

Some substitution of magnesium for aluminum is 
possible in the attapulgite lattice. Water is held in the

interstices between the fibres, but the lattice is non- 
expandable. Although some exchangeable ions may be held 
between fibres, attapulgite has not got a high base 
exchange capacity® 

Allophane 

Allophane is the term applied to an amorphous 
mixture of alumina, silica and water (44)* It is a minor 
constituent of some clays, being most commonly associated 
with halloysite* 

Methods of Study 

Physical Properties - The clay minerals are usually too 
fine grained to be studied as individual particles, hence 
only their mass properties can be observed* Since most 
clays contain fine grained impurities which cannot be 
observed in the hand specimen, physical examination is of 
little value in the mineralogical study of the clays except 
to distinguish them from other minerals. The main physical 
property useful for distinguishing clay is its plasticity. 
Montmorillonites, particularly those with adsorbed sodium 
are characterized by their ability to adsorb large volumes 
of water with resultant swelling* 

Colour is of little diagnostic value in working with 
clay minerals, as most are white or light coloured (43)• 
Dark colours characterize the iron montmorillonites, which 
are green, yellowish green or brown. However, the colour

of many clays is caused by minor amounts of impurity rather 
than by the clay minerals of which they are composed<> 

Optical Properties - Optical methods are of little value 
in themselves as a means of distinguishing clay minerals, 
which are usually too fine grained to be seen under the 
petrographic microscope. When particles of sufficient coarse¬ 
ness are found, the fact that clay minerals are opaque renders 
their study by optical methods very difficult® 

The only optical properties that can be utilized in 
the study of clay minerals are their refractive indices, 
which can be obtained from large particles or from aggre¬ 
gates. Aggregates of uniform optical orientation can be 
obtained by suspending the clay in a beaker of water, then 
placing a glass slide just below the surface of the suspen¬ 
sion. A film of clay is formed upon the slide, and upon 
drying, the flake-shaped particles are all oriented parallel 
to the surface of the slide (13)* 

A source of considerable error is introduced into 
the determination of the indices of montmorillonites by 
the fact that these clays absorb certain media with a 
resulting change in index. Consequently, relatively stable 
media such as halowax, kerosene or methylene iodide must be 
employed in the study of the montmorillonites (28). 

The refractive indices of the principal clay minerals 
are given below in table 2.

The indices of the members of isomorphous series in 
the montmorillonite group probably vary directly as the 
proportions of the two end members of the series contained 
therein. Examination of a number of montmorillonites with 
varying proportions of iron has shown such a relationship 
to hold true for this series (42). 

Chemical Analysis - Chemical analyses are of some value in 
studying clay minerals, but they possess several disadvantages. 
From a chemical analysis, one cannot differentiate between 
elements which are part of the lattice structure, elements 
which are adsorbed on the outside of the lattice and elements 
which are present in impurities in the clay. Furthermore, 
several clay minerals in the kaolin group have similar chemical 
formulas but a different lattice configuration. Unless 
chemical data is used in conjunction with other data and

unless care is used in its interpretation, the results 
obtained are quite likely to be deceiving. 

Perhaps the chief use of chemical analysis is in 
the differentiation of the various members of the mont- 
morillonite group. Ross and Hendricks (42) give an 
extended discussion on the method employed in calculating 
replacements within the montmorillonite lattice from a 
chemical analysis of a pure clay sample. 

Differential Thermal Analysis - One of the most useful 
methods for clay mineral determination is differential 
thermal analysis which consists of heating a clay sample 
and determining any exothermic or endothermic reactions 
which take place (j51). A characteristic graph is obtained 
for each clay mineral by heating a sample of it and some 
inert substance, such as aluminum oxide, at a constant rate 
of temperature increase and recording temperature differ¬ 
ences between them by means of a differential thermocouple 
with an attached recording device. 

The form of the curve obtained is dependent to a 
certain extent upon the rate at which the mineral is heated 
(51). A faster rate of heating will give a quicker rate 
of reaction, so that the peak on the graph will be higher, 
but will not cover such a great temperature range. A slower 
rate of heating produces a flatter peak covering a greater 
temperature range. Nevertheless, for any given mineral, 
each peak will be at the same temperature and the area

under the curve will he the same, regardless of the rate 
of heating. 

Sample curves of various clay minerals are shown in 
figure 10, The curves of the kaolin minerals show one 
endothermic peak caused by decomposition of the mineral, 
followed by an exothermic peak caused by recrystallization 
of alumina from the lattice ( 31 )* 

The curve of montmorillonite shows three endothermic 
reactions followed by an exothermic reaction. The first 
endothermic reaction is due to the driving off of adsorbed 
water, therefore, its amplitude will depend upon the degree 
of hydration of the mineral and the nature of the adsorbed 
ions® The temperature of the second endothermic peak is 
more constant; it is caused by the breakdown of hydroxyl 
groups to form water. The third endothermic peak is caused 
by the breakdown of the montmorillonite lattice and the 
final exothermic peak is caused by the formation of spinel. 

The positions and amplitudes of the peaks vary according 
to the degree and kind of substitution v\rithin the lattice {J>1 ). 

Beidellite gives a differential thermal curve similar 
to that shown for montmorillonite in figure 10. Nontronite 
varies in the absence of the third exothermic peak, pro¬ 
bably because the breakdown of the lattice and the forma¬ 
tion of spinel occur simultaneously. It also varies from 
montmorillonite in the lower temperature at which the second 
endothermic reaction takes place. Kerr, Kulp and Hamilton 
(Jl) explain the lower temperature of this reaction as due

to the relative weakness of the Fe-OH bond© However, many 
montmorillonites with an FegO^ content up to 7 per cent show 
the same temperature for the second endothermic reaction as 
montmorillonites with a low iron content® 

The thermal curve of hectorite varies from that of 
montmorillonite in the higher temperature at which the second 
endothermic reaction occurs and the lower temperature at which 
the third endothermic reaction occurs. 

The curves of illite and attapulgite are somewhat 
similar to those of montmorillonite and nontronite respect¬ 
ively and are shown in figure 10. 

Power X-ray Analysis - X-ray analysis is based on the fact 
that X-rays incident upon a crystal will be diffracted from 
each layer of atoms [y$)• Two rays diffracted from adjacent 
planes will only be observed if they are in phase. Conseq¬ 
uently, X-rays diffracted from a crystal will show a series 
of dots on a film, these dots corresponding to the angles 
of diffraction at which the crystals emerge from the crystal 
in phase. The positions of these dots are controlled by the 
formula NX= 2d sin# , where n= any whole numberj'x = the 
wave length of the X-rays; d= the distance between planes 
of atoms; and© — the angle of incidence of the X-rays. 

For X-ray analysis of fine grained materials such as 
clays, a powder may be used instead of a crystal. The 
random orientation of the grains ensures that there will 
always be some grains correctly oriented to satisfy the

above equation so that X-rays will be diffracted in phase * 

The random orientation of the particles around the axes of 
the incident X-rays will result in a series of rings being 
formed on the film, rather a group of dots. Each mineral 
will produce a characteristic set of rings, referred to as 
an X-ray pattern. This pattern may be used to identify 
unknown minerals by comparison with a set of patterns of 
known minerals, or it may be used to calculate interplanar 
distances in the lattice. Therefore, X-rays are not only 
useful in the determination of clay minerals, but are also 
valuable in research. 

Base Exchange Experiments- The determination of base 
exchange capacity is especially useful in identifying the 
montmorillonite group. Because of the great discrepancy 
in base exchange capacity between the montmorillonite group 
and other clay minerals, accurate base exchange data from 
an unknown clay may be used to obtain a semiquantitative 
estimate of the percentage of montmorillonite minerals in 
the unknown (23)* 

The general method used in base exchange determination 
is to place finely ground clay in a solution of ammonium 
acetate and agitate it for about 48 hours. The base exchange 
capacity of the clay is calculated from the ammonium ion 
concentration of the ammonium acetate before and after it 
has been in contact, with the clay ( 30 )* 

Base exchange capacities of the principal clay minerals 


were given in table 1

Dye Tests - Upon absorption of certain dyes and other 
organic compounds, montmorilIonite minerals undergo 
characteristic colour changes, which represent auseful and 
rapid test for the montmorillonite minerals ( 30 ). 

The simplest test is the treatment of finely ground 
clay with an aqueous solution of benzidine. Minerals of 
the montmorillonite group turn deep blue upon such treat¬ 
ment; other clay minerals retain their original colour. 

The test is very sensitive and records the presence of minor 
amounts of montmorillonite. The disadvantages of the test 
is that organic matter and ferric iron also react with 
benzidine to give a blue colour, so that discretion must 
be used in evaluating any positive results. 

Other tests involve the application of nitrobenzene 
solutions of crystal violet, safranine-y, and malachite 
green dyes to acid treated clays. Crystal violet causes 
montmorillonite to turn green, then yellowish orange. Illite 
turns dark green and kaolinite merely absorbs the dye,. On 
treatment with sefranine-y, montmorillonite turns purple- 
blue, and on treatment with malachite green it turns orange. 
Other clay minerals merely absorb these dyes with varying 
degrees of ease. 

Particle Size Analysis- Particle size analysis of clays 
was probably developed because of the good results this 
method has given in the study of sands and gravels. Un¬ 
fortunately, particle size analysis of clays is severely 
limited by the fact that clays tend to break down into

smaller particles in water. In order for results to have 
any validity, all clay minerals should he given the same 
treatment. Usually, a suspension of the clay is prepared, 
then the percentage of the clay which settles in a given time is 
determined by withdrawing a certain amount of the suspen¬ 
sion with a pipette and measuring the amount of clay which 
it contains (32). The results thus obtained give a compar¬ 
ative picture of the size of the clay particles in suspension, 
but there is no guarantee that the results have any signif¬ 
icance with respect to actual particle size. 

The recent development of the electron microscope has 
made possible accurate observations of particle size and 
habit of clay minerals (9)* The habits of various clay 
minerals have been mentioned in the preceding discussions. 

Little data has been obtained on the particle size of clays, 
and most results to date have been inconclusive. 

pH xdialysis - There are two methods of testing for pH which 
have been suggested in the literature. The first is a field 
test, known as the abrasion pH test, which requires very 
little equipment, but is rather inaccurate. The test con¬ 
sists of grinding a pinch of the material on a streak plate 
and moistening it with a few drops of water. The resulting 
suspension is then tested by means of standard pH papers. 
Experiments have shown that the pH of clay suspensions varies 
with the concentration of clay, so that this method is not 
very suitable for the study of clays. 

The secondi method is to prepare a suspension containing

a fixed concentration of clay, then to determine the pH of 
the suspension by titration. This method requires more time 
and technical competence, but is much more accurate them the 
abrasion pH test. 

Infrared Spectroscopy - Study of clay minerals by infrared 
spectroscopy has only been developed in the last few years, 
but the results obtained have been so encouraging that this 
method promises to become one of the most important tools in 
the identification of clay minerals (1). 

Briefly, the principle upon which infrared spectros¬ 
copy is based is as follows. Atoms within a molecule are 
continually vibrating with a frequency of the order of infrared 
rays. Consequently, if infrared radiation enters the molecule, 
that radiation whose frequency exactly coincides with the 
frequency of vibration of the atoms will be absorbed (j?). By 
passing infrared rays of known frequencies through an unknown 
clay mineral and measuring spectroscopically the amount of 
radiation absorbed, then plotting the frequency against the 
percentage absorption, a graph known as an infrared spectrum 
is obtained. Each mineral possesses a characteristic infrared 
spectrum, so that once a number of known minerals have been 
analyzed, an unknown may be rapidly identified by comparison 
of the infrared spectra. 

Conclusions - Because of the unreliability of many of the 
foregoing tests and the sources of error introduced by clay 
mineral mixtures and impurities, a combination of as many of

the tests as possible is desirable to obtain an accurate 
mineralogical analysis of any given clay* Unfortunately, 
the most useful tests, which are differential thermal 
analysis, X-ray analysis and infrared spectroscopy, require 
specialized equipment and technique. Therefore, clay mineral 
analysis seems destined to remain a specialized study to 
be carried on only in well equipped laboratories, unless 
some other method of determination requiring less expensive 
equipment is devised®

THE ALTERATION OF VOLCANIC TUFF 

The nature of the clay formed by the decomposition 
of volcanic tuff is dependent upon two variables, namely 
the original composition of the tuff and the environ¬ 
mental conditions acting upon the tuff at the time of its de 
composition• 

Tuff is composed of mineral fragments, rock fragments 

and volcanic glass in varying proportions, the overall 

/ 

chemical composition being the same as an igneous rock 
(40)o Tuffs are named after the flow rocks to which they 
correspond in composition. Thus, there are rhyolite tuffs, 
dacite tuffs, andesite tuffs, basalt tuffs, etc (18) 0 
Since tuff is a clastic sediment, admixture of other 
elastics in any proportion is possible. 

The only apparent way to determine the volcanic 
origin of any clay is to actually observe the alteration 
taking place. However, in some clays, relict volcanic 
textures such as shards are perfectly preserved and can 
be observed in thin section. All the clays of this type 
reported in the literature are montmorillonites (1J,12, 
19,27,29). Many authors have concluded that there is 
some feature of tuff which favours the formation of mont- 
morillonite, but it seems possible that volcanic textures 
are preserved with greater perfection in montmorillonites 
than in other clays. 

Since the composition of tuffs is the same as that 
of igneous rocks, their decomposition products under the

same environment should theoretically be the same. The 
only variable entering into the picture is volcanic glass, 
which is chemically similar to other igneous rocks, but 
differs from them in that no separation into mineral con¬ 
stituents has taken place. Therefore, if there is some 
constituent of tuffs which favours the formation of mont- 
morillonite, it would be volcanic glass. Hauser and 
Reynolds (20) have decomposed artificial and natural 
volcanic glasses in the laboratory under a variety of 
conditions, and in all cases, montmorillonite was produced. 

Further support is lent to the theory that tuff 
alters to montmorillonite by the occurrence of montmorill¬ 
onite in marine sediments of the Upper Cretaceous of the 
western plains of North .America, an area adjacent to which 
there was great volcanic activity in the Upper Cretaceous. 
If montmorillonite is rare in marine sediments as is 
claimed, the presence of appreciable montmorillonite in 
marine sediments in this area is best explained by assuming 
it to have had a volcanic origin. 

On the other hand, kaolinite, illite and attapulgite 
have all been reported to have formed from volcanic tuff 
under certain conditions. This would indicate that some 
tuffs, possibly those with a low glass content, alter in 
the same way as igneous rocks. 

Unfortunately, the use of the word "bentonite” with 
two meanings has added unlimited confusion to the whole 
problem. "Bentonite" was first used to describe a peculiar

soapy clay which swelled to many times its own volume 
when placed in water. This material has subsequently 
been identified as montmorillonite, with adsorbed sodium 
present. The varieties which do not swell to such a marked 
degree probably have some adsorbed calcium in addition to 
sodium. Bentonite was soon found to be widespread in 
Upper Cretaceous sediments of western North America and 
the name quickly became established in the literature® 

Later, a thin section study of several bentonites showed 
them to be derivatives of volcanic ash. In 1926, Ross and 
Shannon proposed a new definition of bentonite which ran 
as follows : n A rock composed essentially of a crystalline 
clay-like material formed by devitrification and the 
accompanying chemical alteration of a glassy igneous 
material, usually tuff or volcanic ash 11 . 

If this definition is accepted, no material can be 
called bentonite until it has been shown to have formed 
from the decomposition of volcanic glass. Furthermore, 
any clay which is derived from the decomposition of volcanic 
glass should be called bentonite according to this defin¬ 
ition, It has not yet been proved that glass alters to 
montmorillonite under all environmental conditions. How¬ 
ever, on the basis of the few studies made on high swell¬ 
ing montmorillonites, geologists have assumed that all 
materials possessing similar properties are also of 
volcanic origin® 

Even if it is assumed that volcanic glass usually 
alters to montmorillonite, the fact still remains that

montmorillonite can form in other ways* It can form from 
the decomposition of igneous rocks (56) and is a common 
constituent of soils ( 15 )* Since "bentonite", using the 
term in its original sense of a high swelling clay, is 
only montmorillonite with more or less adsorbed sodium, 
to say that all high swelling clays are of volcanic origin 
is apt to lead to grave errors in interpretation* 

In Alberta, "bentonite" is a common constituent of 
marine and continental Upper Cretaceous rocks. These 
bentonites are generally assumed to be of volcanic origin, 
but no proof of such origin has been given in any instance 
of which the writer is aware* Admittedly, the presence of 
tuff beds in the Upper Cretaceous is circumstantial 
evidence, but it cannot be accepted as proof* 

In this thesis, the word "bentonite" is used on the 
basis of physical properties without any implications as to 
the source of the material* In other words "bentonite" is 
used to describe a clay composed predominately of montmor¬ 
illonite, not necessarily derived from the decomposition of 
volcanic material*

RESULTS OF LABORATORY INVESTIGATIONS 

Examination of the Dark zjpne 

The sand size grades were separated out from 
each sample by the method described in chapter 1 and 
examined under the binocular microscope and petro¬ 
graphic microscope. The percentage of the sand grade 
in each sample was under 1%, but the presence of clay 
aggregates in the coarse fraction and the loss in wash¬ 
ing prevented accurate measurement. 

The dominant constituent in the coarse fraction 
of every sample was a dark brown, soft, opaque mineral 
with the ability to absorb water. Other constituents 
observed were calcite, quartz, and aggregates of a white 
clay mineral subsequently identified by dye tests as a 
montmorillonite. A semiquantitative estimate of the

Calcite and quartz have little significance because 
they might be expected to occur in any clays, no matter 
what their origin. The unknown dark brown mineral seemed 





- 47 - 


to be the most promising source of information as to the 
origin of the zone, so an attempt was made to identify 
it. Standard mineralogical tests showed it to have the 
following properties: colour, dark brown; hardness, 
approximately l.$ to 2; cleavage, fair, platy; fracture, 
sub-conchoidal; insoluble in water and acids; absorbs 
water and gives off water upon heating; abrasion pH 6.2; 
opaque; index, approximately l.j?2; biaxial; optical 
angle, fairly small® Because of the opaque nature of 
the mineral, other optical properties could not be 
determined. 

The properties outlined above seemed to indicate 
a clay mineral or some allied mineral, but precise ident¬ 
ification was impossible because of the limited facilities 
available. Therefore a one gram sample of the mineral 
was sent to Dr. R. E. Grim of the University of Illinois 
for identification. The method used in obtaining a pure 
sample was the same as that used in microfaunal studies. 
The coarse fraction was separated out and placed under 
a binocular microscope, then individual grains of the 
mineral were picked up with a moistened camels hair paint 
brush. 

Dr. Grim analyzed the pure material by means of 
differential thermal analysis and X-ray analysis. The 
differential thermal curve and the X-ray photo obtained 
are shown in figures 11 and 12 respectively. From these 
two analyses, Dr, Grim determined the mineral to be a

member of the montmorillonite group* On the basis of 
the low temperature of the second endothermic reaction 
of the differential thermal curve and the dark colour 
of the mineral, he considered that it was probably 
nontronite, the iron-rich member of the montmorillonite 
series. However, previous studies of the mineral had 
shown it to have a refractive index of approximately 
1.52. The index of nontronite reported in the literature 
is 1*^6 to 1.60, the index increasing with an increase 
in iron content. As previously pointed out, the montmor- 
illonites adsorb certain media with a resulting change in 
index. In order to remove any doubts as to the poss¬ 
ibility of error from this cause, the index was carefully 
checked using a mixture of .halowax and government oil, 
the result being 1.525* The oil was checked by deter¬ 
mining the index of a standard clay mineral purchased 
from a research committee of the American Petroleum 
Institute, and was found to be quite satisfactory. 

These results seemed to be in conflict with Dr. 
G-rim T s proposal that the mineral be classed as nontronite. 
In order to determine whether or not the mineral was 
nontronite, another pure sample was picked and sent to 
Mr. C. A. Noble of the Industrial Laboratory at the 
University of Alberta for an iron analysis. He reported 
that the sample contained 3 * 96 /° iron, which is equivalent 
to 5*&7% Ne 2 ° 3 * Since nontronite has an Fe 2 C >3 content 
averaging 25% or more, the mineral was definitely

established as being something other than nontronite. 

The most obvious thing which it could have been was 
montmorillonite• However, all montmorillonites reported 
in the literature, even those with a high iron content, 
showed the second endothermic reaction of the differential 
thermal curve at a temperature of 700 degrees C, whereas 
the curve of the unknown mineral showed this reaction at 
^00 degrees C. In response to a question as to what the 
mineral might be, Dr. Grim replied as follows: 

tf There can be all possible degrees of replacement of 
aluminum by iron in the montmorillonite lattice. As the 
iron content increases the endothermic reaction for loss 
of (OH) water tends to occur at a lower temperature. This 
peak for your sample is lower than that of many montmorill 
onites, hence my suggestion that your sample was iron-rich 
There are, however, some montmorillonites with a low iron 
content which also show a relatively low temperature for 
this reaction - why? Nobody yet knows. Also the final 
part of your curve is like that on many iron-rich mont¬ 
morillonites, but again, other samples show somewhat 
similar endings. 11 

"The iron determination you give indicates a mineral 
which would be classed as a montmorillonite rather than 
nontronite. However, many or probably most montmorillon¬ 
ites have less iron than your sample, and I would describe 
it as an iron-rich montmorillonite. The term nontronite 
would imply a montmorillonite-type mineral with more than 
half of the aluriiinum substituted by iron. The index of

refraction is in accord with the high iron montmorillonite. n 

Since the characteristic feature of the beds under 
consideration is their dark brown colour and since the 
coarse fraction contains a dark brown clay mineral, the 
assumption that the colour of the beds is due to the 
colour of this clay mineral seemed logical. However, 
there was the possibility that the colour of the beds 
might be due to organic matter, so the clay was tested 
for organic matter* A sample of the clay was ground and 
screened through a 150 mesh screen, then part of the 
sample was heated on a Bunsen flame for four hours* No 
noticeable discolouration took place. Another portion of 
the sample was boiled with hydrogen peroxide for fifteen 
minutes and again no noticeable discolouration took place, 
indicating that organic matter is probably not present in 
the beds in large amounts. The colour of the beds is 
therefore not primarily due to organic matter, but rather 
to the dark colour of the iron-rich montmorillonite which 
they contain. 

As a further check on the results, the dark mineral 
and a sample of the dark shale were tested with an aqueous 
solution of benzidine. Both gave a positive test for 
montmorillonite. 

A minor amount of the iron-rich montmorillonite was 
also present in the underlying White Zone. Examination of 
the Dark Zone and the White Zone from the Red Deer River 
Valley also showed the presence of this same mineral.

Unfortunately, samples of the Battle formation of the 
Cypress Hills were not available for study, but iron- 
rich montmorillonite was observed in minor amounts in 
several samples of the Whitemud formation, notably in the 
darker phases. A study of the Battle to determine whether 
it contained iron-rich montmorillonite would be a valuable 
check on the correlation of these beds with the Dark Zone, 

The relationship of the Dark Zone to the tuff 
remained uncertain after these results had been obtained. 
Evidence that there might be some relationship was given 
by a bed of Modern Ash which occurs about 2J5 miles south¬ 
west of Nanton (locality 2 in figure 1). This ash is 
overlain by a bed of dark coloured clay (2). Unfortun¬ 
ately, no sample of this clay was available for study, 
but an examination of the ash under the binocular micros¬ 
cope and the petrographic microscope showed the presence 
of several grains of material rather similar in appearance 
to the iron-rich montmorillonite. An examination of the 
dark clay would be necessary in order to fully evaluate 
the significance of these results. 

Examination of the Kneehills Tuff and Associated Bentonites 

A study of thin sections in the Department of G-eology T s 
collection confirmed Sanderson 1 s observations which were 
given in Chapter 1. Immersion mounts of the tuff samples 
from near Edmonton were examined and showed this tuff to 
be similar in all respects to the Kneehills Tuff from 
other localities in Alberta. Shards were visible, but

were rare, small and rather poorly developed. Conseq¬ 
uently, there seemed to be little hope of observing 
relict volcanic textures in the bentonite associated 
with the tuff® 

A study of the coarse fraction obtained from the 
bentonite overlying the middle tuff bed (sample 7) showed 
the following constituents to be present: quartz, 10f®; 
feldspar, 5%; iron-rich montmorilIonite, 20%; and biotite, 
65% • These minerals are the ones usually reported as 
occurring in bentonite (24), with the exception of the 
iron-rich montmorillonite. Since the bentonite grades 
upward into the dark shale characteristic of the zone, 
it is probable that most of the iron-rich montmorillonite 
came from the upper part of the sample. No volcanic 
glass was observed, presumably because it had all altered 
to montmorillonite® 

Benzidine dye tests on the bentonite showed its 
dominant mineral constituent to be a montmorillonite, 
probably the species montmorillonite. The light colour 
of the bentonite indicates that it has a low iron content® 
Its refractive index was determined to be approximately 
1.49, which is in line with these conclusions. A benzidine 
dye test on the Kneehills tuff gave a weakly positive 
result, indicating that it is partly altered to mont¬ 
morillonite. 

For purposes of comparison, a partly devitrified tuff 
from near Valleyview, Alberta, was examined for evidences 




- 55 - 


of alteration. Microscopic examination of the tuff showed 
dimly anisotropic particles with crystallites and air 
bubbles, and a light grey opaque substance. A benzidine 
dye test gave a positive reaction, indicating that this 
tuff is also altering to montmorillonite. 

The next step taken was to examine a bentonite sample 
from a horizon in the Edmonton formation below the Knee- 
hills Tuff. This bentonite showed no evidences of volcanic 
textures under the petrographic microscope and examination 
of the coarse fraction showed no volcanic glass. Benzidine 
dye tests gave a strong positive test for montmorillonite. 

Examination of the White Zone 

The examination of the White Zone was incidental to 
the main problem of this thesis, but some interesting 
preliminary results were obtained. 

The ’White Zone is much more sandy than the Dark Zone, 
the coarse fraction making up about 35% of the total. 
Examination of ,the coarse fraction showed it to be made 
up of 90 % quartz; 3% white clay aggregates, probably 
montmorillonite and/or kaolinite; 4f> iron-rich montmorill- 
onite similar to that in the dark zone; 1% calcite and a 
few grains of badly decomposed feldspar. 

A benzidine dye test on the clay fraction showed a 
positive test for montmorillonite. However, the test was 
not so strong as for the bentonite, indicating that some 
other clay mineral may make up part of the bed. The

refractive index of the clay fraction was determined 
as 1.54-8 - 0.0005, which is intermediate between the 

indices of montmorillonite and kaolinite. Since the 
stratigraphically equivalent Whitemud formation is 
predominately kaolinite, the suggestion is made that the 
White Zone is composed of a mixture of montmorillonite, 
kaolinite and clastic quartz. iv *ore work is needed to 
confirm the validity of this suggestion.

CONCLUSIONS 


Summary of t(e suits of Laboratory Investinations 

The study of the Dark Zone showed it to be composed 
mainly of iron-rich montmorillonite, with a minor amount 
of a light coloured clay mineral, probably montmorillonite 
with a low iron content. Occurring within this zone is 
a tuffaceous horizon of from two to four beds of tuff, 
partly altered to montmorillonite. The montmorillonite 
formed from the tuff is white, and presumably has a low 
iron content. Studies on other tuff indicated that it 
too is altering to montmorillonite, but studies on several 
montmorillonites failed to provide any proof that they 
were derived from tuffs* 

Underlying the Dark Zone is the White Zone which 
consists of sandy clays, probably composed of a mixture 
of montmorillonite, kaolinite and quartz. 

Theoretical Considerations 

The iron-rich montmorillonite which is the main 
constituent of the Dark Zone could be formed in soils or 
in clays derived from the decomposition of pyroclastics 
or igneous rocks* It may have formed elsewhere and been 
transported to its present position, or it may have formed 
in place. Originally, the clay may have been an illite 
which subsequently altered to a montmorillonite. Any 
theory of origin must take into account the fact that 
the zone occurs over an area at least 400 miles long.

The suggestion that the Dark Zone roay represent 
a fossil soil is rejected because a thirty to forty foot 
soil with a uniform appearance throughout and containing 
less than one per cent sand is unlikely. Furthermore, 
the deep leaching necessary to produce a deep soil should 
result in the formation of kaolinite rather than rnont- 
morillonite. 

If the zone was originally derived from the decom¬ 
position of pyroclastics, they may have come from the same 
source as the Kneehills Tuff or from a different source. 

The theory that they are from a different source is 
rejected, because predominately clastic deposition being 
interrupted by ash falls from two different directions 
would be highly improbable 0 

Chemical analyses do not favour the theory that the 
Dark Zone is derived from decomposition of the Fneehills 
Tuff. The analysis of the essential oxides of the Knee- 
hills Tuff given in the opening chapter shows the complete 
absence of iron, yet the Dark Zone contains 5*^7% FezOj. 
Furthermore, the tuff has partly altered to a light 
coloured montmorillonite, presumably of low iron content. 
The tuff seems to be acid in composition, but calculation 
of the normative minerals shows that this is not necess¬ 
arily so. The norm of the tuff as calculated by the method 
of Cross, Iddings, Pirrson and Wadi ington (25) is as 
follows:

Rock of this composition is unlikely, because highly 
acid rocks do not contain normative anorthite and hyper- 
sthene in such large amounts (57). Only by considering 
a large proportion of the silica to be secondary can the 
calculated norm be compared to any published norms. If 
most of the excess silica is considered to be secondary, 
the original tuff would be intermediate in composition, 
possibly equivalent to monzonite or andesite. If this 
conclusion is correct, the absence of iron in the analysis 
of the Kheehills tuff becomes hard to understand. Possibly, 
the original tuff was a monzonite or andesite, from which 
iron was leached following deposition. 

The origin of the secondary silica in the tuff is 
somewhat puzzling. Sanderson ( 49 ) states that it was 
leached from the adjacent beds, but they show no signif- 
leant mineralogical difference from the remainder of the 
zone. 

If the Dark Zone was derived from the decomposition 
of tuff, the Kneehills tuff must represent local bands 
which escaped alteration. The following is suggested as 
a possible order of events: (1) Deposition of thick tuff 
beds which were partly devitrified and decomposed during 
deposition. Local bands of tuff escaped alteration,

either due to more rapid deposition or to a slight change 
in environmental conditions. (2) Leaching of iron from 
the unaltered tuff bands and deposition of secondary 
silica. (3) Total decomposition of the partially decom¬ 
posed tuff to form an iron-rich montmorillonite. (4) 
Decomposition of part of the unaltered tuff to form mont- 
morillonite with a low iron content. 

If the clay was derived from the decomposition of an 
igneous rock, it must have been deposited under the same 
conditions as a normal shale. Microfaunal studies of the 
Battle formation in the Cypress Hills showed it to be a 
fresh water deposit (52). No microfossils were observed 
in the Dark Zone, but it is assumed that it was laid down 
under the same conditions as the Battle. The deposition 
of such a fresh water shale with few admixed elastics over 
a wide area is improbable, but other suggestions as to the 
origin of the Dark Zone are also rather improbable. Of 
the various origins which were suggested, the author is 
inclined to favour the theory that the zone is of pyro¬ 
clastic origin. The unconformity above the Battle form¬ 
ation lends support to the idea that the Battle was laid 
down in a period of non-deposition of elastics, and the 
Dark Zone was probably laid down under the same conditions 
as the Battle. Further study is needed before the problem 
can be considered as solved. 

The underlying White Zone is probably a mixture of 
quartz, kaolinite and montmorillonite. The Whitemud form-

ation of the Cypress Hills is composed of quartz and kaol- 
inite, and may contain minor amounts of montmorillonite. 
McClearn (10) considers the Whitemud to have been deposited 
on an alluvial plain. Deposition was slow and not con¬ 
tinuous, with leaching, of feldspars taking place during 
periods of non-deposition. It is suggested by the present 
author that the White Zone was laid down under similar 
conditions with less leaching, resulting in the formation 
of montmorillonite and kaolinite, rather than kaolinite<> 

The lateral variation in the grain size and in the thick¬ 
ness of the zone is well accounted for by this postulated 
environment of deposition. Since the Whitemud is thicker 
than the White Zone, the conditions which gave rise to 
these sediments must have operated for a longer period in 
the Cypress Hills than they did farther north. 

Suggestions for Further Study 

In this thesis, few definite conclusions have been 
drawn and many problems have been suggested. In part, the 
lack of conclusions stems from the lack of knowledge of 
the environments in which the different clay minerals 
were formed; in part it stems from the lack of data on 
Alberta sediments, particularly the shales and clays. In 
the course of this investigation, the author made several 
mis judgments, as pioneers are always apt to do. Much time 
was used in attempting to identify a clay mineral with 
insufficient facilities available for definite determination.

More time was spent in considering methods of approach 
and in searching the literature. 

Much work remains to be done on the Dark Zone , the 
White Zone and all other Alberta shales and clays. Part 
of this work will have to be coordinated with studies on 
modern clays formed in known environments. Several 
suggestions have been made in this thesis for additional 
methods of approach in the study of the Dark Zone and the 
White Zone, and these are summarized in the next paragraph, 
together with several other suggestions for future invest¬ 
igators in the field of clays and shales in Alberta. 

Complete and accurate chemical analysis of the Knee- 
hills Tuff, the overlying bentonite and the dark brown 
shale of the Dark Zone should assist in evaluating their 
relationship. A differential thermal analysis of the dark 
brown shale would give a better picture of the abundance 
of the iron-rich montmorilIonite which is assumed to be its 
dominant constituent. Considerable clarification of the 
whole problem of the Dark Zone might result from a mineral- 
ogical examination of the Battle formation and the dark clay 
overlying the Modern Ash bed near Nanton. Another approach, 
which would be of value in determining the relative import¬ 
ance of pyroclastics in Alberta would be a study of thin 
sections of numerous Alberta bentonites in an attempt to 
observe relict volcanic textures. 

Another problem which was only touched on in this thesis 
is the origin of the White Zone. A quantitative mineral-

ogical study of the White Zone from several localities 
combined with a similar investigation of the Whitemud 
formation might throw more light on this problem. 

In general, any study of a clay or shale is not 
complete without a mineralogical analysis. This entails 
the sending of samples to clay laboratories, a procedure 
which will undoubtedly become more common as the environ¬ 
mental history of the different clay minerals becomes 


better known
