ABSTRACT 


Experiments were conducted in 1952 to investigate the 
effect of maleic hydrazide upon the vegetative and reprod¬ 
uctive growth of plants. Applications of this chemical by 
two methods and at three stages in the life cycle of the 
common radish gave the following results: 

1. The results were all harmful from the standpoint 
of upsetting normal plant processes but the op¬ 
posite result was obtained from the standpoint 
of inducing a decrease in the rate of softening 
of hypocotyl tissue in storage as measured by 
resistance to puncture. 

2. Maleic hydrazide acted as an inhibitor to the growth 
of plant tops and hypocotyls, and to regrowth of 
roots and shoots from hypocotyls subjected to a 
cool storage period. Treatment caused prompt ces¬ 
sation in the activity of the terminal meristems, 
and shorter plants, a lower seed pod set, and 
marked reductions in the total dry weight of plants. 

3. The sensitivity of the plants varied inversely with 
the age of the vegetative or reproductive phases. 

That is, treatment produced the greatest abnormalitie 
(a) to vegetative growth when applied early in the 
life cycle of the plant, and (b) to the reproductive 
processes when applied early in the reproductive

phase. The latter affected the next generation by 
reducing the viability of the seed. 

4. Other effects which were observed but not so 
extensively studied were collapse of numerous 
palisade cells in the leaves and differentiation 
of a third irregular row of palisade cells. 

5. In time some plants can outgrow many of the ab¬ 
normal effects produced and eventually set seed. 

More should be known about the mammalian toxicity of 
maleic hydrazide and the mechanism of its action on plants 
before the compound can be recommended for practical use, 
particularly on edible food plants. Results noted here 
substantiate those of other workers and suggest certain leads 
toward a more thorough understanding of the mode of action 
of maleic hydrazide on living plants.

INTRODUCTION 


A new discovery was announced in 1949 when Schoene 


and Hoffman (29) reported that maleic hydrazide had an effect 
upon the growth of plants. Following this publication ( 29 ) 
numerous investigatiois to determine the effects of this 
new chemical upon plants and plant parts were conducted. 
Within a short time these experiments have led authorities 
to classify maleic hydrazide among other synthetic growth 
regulating compounds. Some have considered maleic hydra¬ 
zide as a general herbicide, but a number of studies have 
shown that maleic hydrazide is cest described as a tempor¬ 
ary plant growth inhibitor. This designation is based 
upon the present knowledge of the reaction of maleic hydra¬ 
zide to plants. The following ''Review of Literature" and 
the body of this report concern a consideration of the 
effects following maleic hydrazide application to plants. 


The active ingredient contained in the available 


formulations of maleic hydrazide has the chemical name 1 , 
2-dihydropyridazine-3, 6 dione, the empirical formula 
C 4 H 4 O 2 N 2 and the following structural formula:

Throughout the body of this report the compound maleic 
hydrazide is most commonly referred to as MH. 

Maleic hydrazide has been formulated (l) as a 
diethanolamine salt, in liquid form, containing 30.0$ 
active ingredient, designated as MH-30, and (2) as a dry 
sodium salt, in powder form, containing 40.0$ active in¬ 
gredient, designated as ME-40. The latter is the newest 
formulation, and it was prepared to overcome some of the 
deficiencies of MH-30. The MH-40 white powder is readily 
soluble in water, has a low rate of evaporation from the 
prepared liquid, can be easily washed from spray equipment 
with water (Zukel 35). Therefore MH-40 is a preparation 
of maleic hydrazide which is very easy to use as well as 
being more effective for application to plants than the 
MH-30 form. 

Many desirable and practical uses for the appli¬ 
cation of maleic hydra^de to plants have been suggested 
recently. Most of these suggestions have been inspired 
by the numerous experiments which have been conducted 
during the past three years. The results obtained, 

whether through external observation or through more fund¬ 
amental studies, have led inquiring minds to asi if maleic 
hydrazide can be employed for the following practical pur¬ 
poses : 

1. To improve the storage qualities of fruit and vegetable 
produce by decreasing breakdown and preventing sprouting.

2. To act as a general herbistat when applied at specific 
stages of growth to certain crops or mixtures of crops. 
The use of directional sprays possibly may broaden this 
phase of influence. 

3. To act as a temporary growth inhibitor of entire plants 
or plant parts. 

4. To create artificially dwarf fruit and ornamental trees 
and shrubs. 

5. 'To increase the sugar concentration in plants. 

6. To create artificial male sterility in some monoecious 
plants such as corn. 

7. To prevent the formation of undesirable fruit upon cer¬ 
tain ornamental trees. 

Other suggested uses could be listed but these indicate 
the diverse nature and the economical possibilities that 
are being considered for the use of the chemical maleic 
hydrazide. 

Since experimentation on the influence of maleic 
hydrazide upon plants has recently become popular and has 
been carried on by numerous investigators, many of the 
results reported to date have been comprised largely of 
visual Symptoms ' and comparatively few have been of 
the fundamental type. Although investigations of the fun¬ 
damental type require more time and resources they will 
be of more value in an effort to obtain accurate answers 
to the above questions concerning the possible and logical

uses of MH. For example, it would seem wise to secure .more 
complete and precise information on the toxicity of maleic 
hydrazide to animals than is published at the present time 
before recommendations on the application of this chemical 
to food plants are made to an unsuspecting public. Plant 
breeders and seed stock producers also would appreciate 
more knowledge than they have available regarding possible 
heritable effects of maleic hydrazide. Answers to the two 
preceding important questions require not only external or 
superficial observations but accurate, detailed, and pains¬ 
taking investigations of a more basic nature than many of 
those thus far reported. 

In line with the current interest in the possibil¬ 
ities of using MH for practical purposes, the research re¬ 
ported herin was initiated to study the effects of maleic 
hydrazide on the growth, hypocotyl quality and the germination 
of the T]_ generation of the common radish. This was an effort 
to gain information which would add to fundamental knowledge 
of the effects of various treatments to radish plants. It 
was hoped that from the results obtained answers to the ques¬ 
tions noted earlier might be provided.

LITERATURE REVIEW 


The purpose of the following survey of literature 
is to consider briefly some of the most important effects 
of maleic hydrazide upon the growth and quality of plants. 

Various definitions of plant growth are recog¬ 
nized. Meyer and Anderson (24) state that the term ’’growth" 
is popularly employed by botanists to designate the complex 
of processes involved in the more or less continuous in¬ 
crease in size and production of new organs throughout the 
life history of the plant. Such a concept of growth is 
suitable for the purpose of this study. 

A definition of quality in fruits or vegetables 
may be stated as the possession of those component charact¬ 
eristics which make the product more or less desirable 
for use. 


Of the two common formulations of maleic hydra¬ 
zide, MH-40 has certain qualities which MH-30 does not 
possess, -c'or example MH-40 contains a wetting agent and 
sticker (35). The addition of a wetting agent to MK-30 is 
necessary for maximum plant response (35). Furthermore the 
sodium salt is reported to have a lower mammalian toxicity 
than the diethanolamine salt (35). Otherwise the essential 
biological properties of MH-30 and MH-40 are for all prac¬ 
tical purposes the same. In the following discussion of

the biological properties the active ingredient maleic hydra- 

zide (MH) is considered. 

Biological Properties of Maleic Hydrazide 

A few of the most important biological properties 

of maleic hydrazide may be listed as follows: 

1. It Is a chemical substance which is toxic to animal (l) 
and plant tissues when absorbed, but is relatively In¬ 
active when not absorbed. To many plants the toxicity 

of MH is sufficient that it has been successfully used 
as a general herbistat (28). 

2 . It temporarily inhibits growth when applied to plants 
at low dosages (35). 

3. It is readily absorbed by roots and leaves, and is 
translocated in both an upward and downward direction 
in plants (Linder as reported by Zukel 35). The MH-30 
form requires about two days to be absorbed by plants 
and any rain or heavy dew occurring within this period 
may reduce the response (35). 

4. The presence of MH can be detected in vegetable and 
animal matter by an analytical method sensitive to a 
fraction of a part per million (33). 

5. The response of MH is greatest at a minimum dosage when 
applied to young plants at the start of the growing 
season (3) (34) (35), and the response varies with the 
dosage used (3).

6. It is reported that MH used at low or moderate rates has 
a short residual effect in the soil (35). 

The Action and Effects of Maleic Hydrazide Upon Plants 

The mechanism of the action of maleic hydrazide 
upon normal plant processes is as yet unknown (28). Pub¬ 
lications which might have a bearing on this problem are 
reviewed first in the following paragraphs. 

Experiments show that maleic hydrazide is anti¬ 
mitotic in its action rather than affecting cell elongation. 
According to Zukel (35), G-reulach found that no concentration 
of MH inhibited growth of etiolated bean hypocotyl, indicat¬ 
ing that MH inhibits cell division rather than cell elongat¬ 
ion. Observations made on the root growth of Southport 
yellow globe onions lead G-reulach and Atchison, as reported 
by Zukel (35), to conclude that MH inhibited mitosis and 
cell division in proportion to the concentration used. 
Darlington and McLeish (6) found no mitosis for two days 
following the immersion of roots of Vicia faba in solutions 
above .0005M. maleic hydrazide for 24 hours. Lower con¬ 
centrations did not stop mitosis, but rather showed break¬ 
age of chromosomes at mitosis. 

Other observations support the conclusion that MH 
acts in opposition to the natural or synthetic hormones in 
plants. Using four different inhibitory levels in standard

pea and straight growth tests Leopold and Klein (22) found 
that indoleacetic acid completely overcame MR inhibition. 
Hitchcock and Timmerman (18) observed that combinations of 
2,4-D and MH produced additive and antagonistic effects. 
Application of a mixture of 0.2 % MH plus 0.1^ 2,4-D showed 
a clear-cut antagonism (Currier 5). Pre-harvest foliage 
sprays of MH consistently retarded the softening rate of 
fruit on the tree and during storage at 74° F after harvest, 
whereas sprays of 2,4,5-T and 2,4,5-TP stimulated the soft¬ 
ening rate of fruit (Smock as reported by Zukel 35). 

Investigations on a number of plants indicates 
that MH inhibits respiration. Naylor and Lavis, as re¬ 
ported by Zukel (35), studied the respiration response of 
root tips of' peas, sunflowers, tomato, corn, barley, oats 
and wheat to maleic hydrazide. They found respiration at 
pH 6.0 was not appreciably affected, but at pH 4.0 marked 
inhibition resulted with the degree of inhibition increas¬ 
ing with the concentration of MH. Observations made on 
the storage organs of plants following pre-harvest foliage 
sprays also suggest <xk sctotesc that MH inhibits respira¬ 
tion (30) (Wittwer and Hansen as reported by Zukel 35). 

According to Zukel (35) Naylor and Davis state 
that MH possibly exerts its influence on growth by inhibi¬ 
ting respiration perhaps affecting the normal function of 
the dehydrogenase enzymes. Isenberg et al. (20) states

that ME sprayed on the foliage of onions affects respira¬ 
tion through the partial inactivation or inhibition of one 
or more of the dehydrogenases. 

MH may affect the carbohydrate metabolism caus¬ 
ing an accumulation of carbohydrates and the appearance 
of anthocyanins. Grreulach (15) found that the trans¬ 
location of starch from leaves of treated tomatoes, beans 
and sunflowers was extremely slow. Currier (5) reported 
that MH treated barley showed a lower fresh weight but a 
higher dry weight than the controls and that was due to 
accumulation of fructosan. Analysis of an exudate which 
appeared on the leaves of growing barley following treat¬ 
ment showed that sucrose was the predominant substance 
present. Naylor (27) reported an accumulation of invert 
sugar in both shoots and roots of all treated maize seed¬ 
lings. The amount of invert sugar accumulated depended 
upon the concentration of MH used. Thirteen times as much 
invert sugar was found in the tops of seedlings treated with 
4000 p.p.m. MH and twice as much in the roots as compared 
with the controls. Quantitative analysis of plants har¬ 
vested 20 days after treatment Indicated that MH had little 
effect on the dextrose accumulation in leaves. Less dex¬ 
trose was present in the roots of treated plants than in 
the controls. According to Zukel (35) both rtirie and

Mikkelsen,and Wittwer and Eansen found foliage sprays of ME 
produced a significantly higher per cent sucrose in sugar 
beets. Another common response following foliage treatments 
of MH is anthocyanin pigmentation which might logically re¬ 
sult from carbohydrate accumulation in the leaves (Grafts 3). 
This increased pigmentation has been noted by a number of 
investigators (ll) (12) (32) (34). 

MH has been considered to differ from most growth 
controlling chemicals in that it has been reported to cause 
only Inhibition of growth with no formative effects (28) 
(Wittwer as reported by Zukel 35). However other reports 
indicate that MH causes formative effects on sugar beets, 
radish, cotton seedlings and Croft Easter Lilies (3) (9) 

( 19 ) (31). An explanation for such a difference among 
plants has not been found in the literature. 

In the foregoing paragraphs what appear to be 
the most important hypotheses on the mechanism of the action 
of MH have been presented. They should be considered quite 
tentative and subject to revision as more data are secured. 

No doubt such hypotheses will provide a basis for the inter¬ 
pretation of most of the numerous superficial observations 
which are reported in the literature. 

For the following reasons the external obser¬ 
vations of the effects on plants following treatment with 
MH will not be discussed in detail: (a) many of the external

observations reported would be those which may be expected 
to follow as a result of the more basic type of observation 
already described; (b) a positive interpretation for the 
basic or causal influence responsible for most external 
observations cannot be given until the mechanism for the 
action of MH in plants is known. However the following 
brief comments will be useful for later discussion. 

The temporary inhibition of plant growth is per¬ 
haps the most common observation made following moderate 
application of MH (2) (5) (12) (13) (14) (21) (35). Al¬ 
though a delay in the vegatative development is usually 
accompanied by a similar inhibition in the reproductive 
development, in certain tree fruits it has been found 
difficult to delay flowering without producing injury (35). 
Zukel (35) states that Denisen obtained highly significant 
Increases in yield in one variety of strawberry the spring 
following an inhibition of runner development caused by MH 
treatment. On the other hand the results of other exper¬ 
iments with strawberries have resulted in significantly re¬ 
duced yields following foliage applications of MH (17). How¬ 
ever if MH treatment causes inhibition of growth the most 
common result is reduced yield as measured by the vegetative 
or reproductive parts of the plants (2) (12) (16) ( 19 ). 

Improvement in the storage qualities of certain 
crops can be attained by the use of pre-harvest foliage

sprays of MH. Such observations have been made in apples, 
onions, potatoes, lettuce, sugar beets, carrots, beets, 
parsnips, turnips, and rutabagas (30) (Johanessen and Oebker, 
Kennedy and Smith, Kosar and Thompson, Peto et al., Wittwer 
et al., Wittwer and Kansen, Wittwer and Paterson as repor¬ 
ted by Zukel 35). In the root crops sprout and root growth 
in storage was inhibited. Zukel (35) has summarized results 
and recommendations, prepared by Wittwer and Paterson, for 
the treatment of onions, potatoes and root crops. Reduced 
quality of snap beans was noted (16) following a spray ap¬ 
plication of MH made at different stages in the development. 
This observation indicates that for some crops a reduction 
in quality may result rather than an improvement in quality. 

A varietal difference in response has been noted 
in apples (30), but in onions a number of varieties and 
hybrids responded similarily to treatment (Wittwer and Pat¬ 
erson as reviewed by Zukel 35). The time of spraying prior 
to harvest for the best results was found to be critical for 
onions, but Zukel (35) states that Wittwer and Hansen found 
that the dates for spraying sugar beets could vary widely. 

The degree of inhibition may vary among plant species and 
within the same species depending upon the dosage used and 
the age of the plants at the time of treatment (35). Since 
young plants treated at the beginning of the growing season 
seem to be the most susceptible (15) (35) the amount of 
growth may be expected to be reduced the most if treatment

is made early in the season. 

Other experiments indicate that MH acts in the 
following ways: 

1. As a general herbicide to certain plants particularly 
if applied at an early stage of growth (3) (28) (35). 

2. Causes chlorosis in leaves or increases the concentrat¬ 
ion of anthocyanin pigments (4) (?) (11) (12) (23). 

3. Effects sterility in flowers (8) (25) or prevents the 
normal setting of fruit or seed (Chadwick et al., 

Grrigsby, Miller and Ers^ine as reported by Zu^el 35). 

4. Stimulates the rate or speed of reproductive develop¬ 
ment following treatments to young plants (2) (3). 

5. Produces dwarf fruit trees (White according to Zukel 35). 
In some cases plants may outgrow many of the formative and 
physiological effects of MH (5) (10) (13) (14). 

Other effects of MH could be given, but reference 
has been made to the most important observations. More detail 
may be obtained on the results of experiments conducted with 
maleic hydrazide from 1949 to 1952 by reference to a "Lit¬ 
erature Summary on Maleic Hydrazide" 1 as compiled by 
Zukel (35)

MATERIALS 


The common radish was the organism chosen as the 
test plant because it is a root crop with a short life 
cycle, thus allowing several crops to be grown in a rela¬ 
tively short period of time. 

The formulation of maleic hydrazide used for all 
treatments was Naugatuck MH-40 -. This formulation prepared 
as a dry water soluble powder, with sticker, contains 40.0^ 
of active maleic hydrazide. 


METHODS 


The plant material for all the experiments came 
from five separate plantings or trials. Titles of these 
trials together with the dates of sowing and seed material 


are as follows: 

A. Soil Application Trial 

B. Greenhouse Trial 

C. Field Trial 

D. Quality Trial 

E. The T-^ Generation Trial

Only the Field Trial was grown out of doors. The 
other trials listed above were grown entirely in the green¬ 
house in flats containing soil of medium texture. 

Applications of MH-40 at three stages in the life 
cycle of the plant were performed in this study, and for 
each two methods of treatment were employed as listed 
in Table 1. 

Soil Application. Greenhouse and Field Trials 

The procedures used in the Soil Application, Green¬ 
house and Field Trials were: 

(l) Pre-emergence Sta^e 

(a) Soil Apolicatlons . Maleic bydrazide was applied at 
30, 20 and 10 pounds of active ingredient per acre 
to greenhouse flats two days after planting the 
Cincinnati Market radish. 

(b) Seed Soaking Treatments . Seed of Scarlet Globe 
radish was soaked for varying periods of time.in 
solutions of maleic hydrazide^ as follows: 

0.01$ for i hour, 

0.02$ for 2 hours, 

0.20$ for 2 hours, 

1.00$ for 2 hours. 

^ Rates are stated either as maleic bydrazide pounds per 
acre or concentration of active ingredient in 
water solution.

The seed was rinsed well in water after soaking the re¬ 
quired time and then immediately planted in greenhouse 
flats. 

(2) Three to Six Days Prior to Stage of Mark et Siz e of 

Hypocotvl 

(a) Early Foliage Treatments. Early foliage sprays of 
maleic hydrazide were applied at 0.01, 0.05, 1.0, 

2.0 and 4.0 pounds per acre to the G-reenhouse Trial 
and 0.5, 4.0 and 8.0 pounds in the Field Trial. All 
rates were applied in 66 gallons of water per acre. 

In the Field trial a negligible amount of 
MH-40 reached the soil. In the G-reenhouse Trial ab¬ 
sorbent paper was used to catch any falling spray 
and later removed from the flats. The time of ap¬ 
plication was approximately three and six days prior 
to the marketable stage of hypocotyls for the Green¬ 
house and Field Trials respectively. 

(b) Early Root Treatments. In the Greenhouse Trial sol¬ 
utions of 0.1, 0.5, 4.0 and 10.0 pounds per acre of 
maleic hydrazide were pipetted to the region of 
root growth of the individual plants. In the Field 
Trial the MH-4o solution was applied at the rate of 
4, 10 and 20 pounds per acre delivered into a shallow 
furrow made on each side of the plot rows.

(3) 3 tap:e of 50% Full Bloom of Controls, 

(a) Late Foliage Treatments. Applications of maleic hy¬ 
drazide were made as late foliage treatments in 66 
gallons of water at the time when the control plants 
were at the stage of an estimated 50$ full bloom. 
Foliage sprays were directed horizontally towards 
the foliage below that portion of the plant which 
was bearing most of the flowers so that essentially 
no MH-40 was applied directly to the flower buds. 

The same rates as those applied to other plots at 
market size stage were applied at this stage; 
namely 0.1, 0.5, 4.0 and 10.0 pounds per acre, with 
the use of spray shields in the Greenhouse Trial; 
and 0.5, 4.0 and 8.0 pounds per acre in the Field 
Trial. In the Field Trial alternate guard rows 
were present and so shields were not needed. 

(b) Late Root Treatments. Maleic hydrazide was applied 
as in the early treatment. The same procedures and 
the same rates were employed in late root treatments 
as were used in the early root treatments. In the 
Greenhouse Trial 0.1, 0.5, 4.0 and 10.0 pounds of 

MH per acre was pipetted to individual plants. In 
the Field Trial 4, 10 and 20 pounds per acre were 
delivered from a nozzle into a shallow furrow on 
each side of the plot row.

was made readily available to the roots in the Green¬ 
house Trial by having the medium in the flats thor¬ 
oughly moist before treatment and in the Field Trial 
by adding water to the furrows a short time after 
the chemical was applied. No moisture came in con¬ 
tact with the plant leaves within a period of 30 
hours after foliage sprays were made. 

S.ualitv Trial 

The Quality Trial was designed to study the effects 
MH treatment had upon hypocotyl quality. The trial con¬ 
sisted of six plots treated and the same number not treated. 
The treatment was a foliage spray of maleic hydrazide ap¬ 
plied at 4.0 pounds per acre eight days before hypocotyls 
reached market size. Each plot contained 24 plants. 

Eight days after treatment all the plants were 
lifted, washed, and topped. The hypocotyls that were not 
used immediately for tests were packed in sterilized peat 
moss and placed in cool storage where the temperature re¬ 
mained near 4° G. 

Tests were made at three separate dates, and eight 
hypocotyls were used at each time as follows: 

(1) At harvest time a total soluble solids determination, 

(2) After hypocotyls were kept in cool storage for 18 days 
a total soluble solids determination plus a dynamometer

storage period of 36 days a second dynamometer test. 

Generation Trial 1952-1Q55 

The r, T-]_ Generation Trial 11 was conducted to make a 
comparative test of differences in germination of seed as 
influenced by application of MH-40 to parent plants. All 
the treatments in the Field Trial which produced seed were 
compared as separate treatments in the Generation Trial. 
Thus the rates listed in Table 1 for this trial are simply 
treatments identified by the rate at which MH-40 was applied 
to the parental plots. 

Summary of Methods 

The method of treatment and the amount of active 
maleic hydrazide applied at each date of treatment or 
stage of growth for each trial are listed in Table 1.

Experimental Designs 

R eplication. The Soil Application Trial was preliminary in 
nature, and therefore no replication of the three rates of 
application was made. The other trials with Scarlet Globe 
radish were set up in the randomized block design with four 
replications except in the Quality Trial where six replicat¬ 
ions were used. In the Greenhouse Trials each replication 
consisted of five major methods of treatments of four rates 
each. With two controls this made a total of 22 plots per 
replicate. For any test in which the material was taxen from 
the Greenhouse Trial the use of four replications and the 
randomized block arrangement was maintained. The Field Trial 
contained four methods of treatment at three rates each plus 
a control, making a total of 13 plots per replicate. 

Guards. Plant guards were not used in the trials grown in 
the greenhouse because flats were used as containers. Glass 
partitions were tightly fitted to separate plots where soil 
treatments were involved. A moveable shield was employed 
to confine the spray to the desired area. In the Field 
Trial alternate rows of the test were guard rows. On the 
end of each plot there was also two feet of guard row. 

This provided adequate protection against drift since 
applications were made during calm periods.

Thinning. At the time hypocotyls were harvested a process 
of thinning was also carried out. This allowed sufficient 
space for other plants to develop to maturity and left no 
undesirable gaps in the plots. Each plot in the Greenhouse 
Trial consisted of twelve plants until the time of market 
size. At this date six plants were harvested and six re¬ 
mained to comprise the population which was observed until 
the end of the normal life cycle. In the Field Trial a 
similar process of thinning was used in obtaining yield 
data at the time hypocotyls were at market size. Alternate 
plants were removed. 

Methods of Collecting the Lata 

On Plant Growth. To measure the growth of various portions 
of the plant the tops were cut off one cm. above the hypo- 
cotyl. Weights of the hypocotyls included this small stem 
portion and the main tap root which would remain attached 
after harvesting by the normal procedure of pulling. Records 
on the behavior of radish kept in cool storage were taken 
to show the renewed top growth and root regrowth. Top 
growth made above the point where the tops were first cut 
off was weighed as new growth. During the cool storage 
period new roots grew from the original tap root. The re¬ 
newed root growth was measured by carefully lifting each 

i weighing after 

hypocotyl from the vermiculite^ and/shaking off any of the 

1 Vermlculite is a heat expanded form of mica used as the 
inert medium for storing hypocotyls in this experiment.

medium which was not held firmly by the new rootlets. This 
proved to be an excellent way to measure the root growth 
activity exhibited among the various treatments. 

Q.ualltv. (a) Tissue Breakdown. A dynamometer was used to 

measure the firmness of the tissues of the radish hypocotyls 
after a cool storage period of six weexs. This instrument 
measures the resistance to puncture in pounds per square 
unit area of the head of the plunger, (b) Soluble Solids 
Content. The determination of the total soluble solids of 
hypocotyls was made with a hand refractometer accurate to 
approximately 0.2 per cent reading. By this method deter¬ 
minations could be made quickly without danger of evapora¬ 
tion nor of any change taking place inside the hypocotyl 
following the time these were removed from cool storage. 

T-j_ Generation. The procedure for the collection of seed for 
the T-l Generation Trial was based upon the following obser¬ 
vation. Since the plants were growing compactly in each 
row, spraying could not Insure application of maleic hydra- 
zide in precisely equal amounts to each plant. However by 
choosing plants most typical of the treatment concerned 
from which to obtain the seed material, the variation due 
to dosage of MH received was minimized. The sample of seed 
for each treatment was gathered from four plants (two plants 
from two replicates). Pods from each plant were chosen at 
random and this sample was threshed and well mixed before

used in further tests. Emergence data were collected one 
month after sowing. 

Methods of Analyzing: the Data 

The data were analysed to determine the sigrificant 
effects of MH-40 by means of the analysis of variance or by 
the H t M test if there were only two treatments involved. 

Separate analyses were made for each trial. A test 
was made to determine if there was association of the stan¬ 
dard deviation with means for any one set of data, tfhere 
this type of association was found logarithmic transfor¬ 
mation was used. 


Climatic Influences . 

The climate during the season of 1952 was excellent 
for the outdoor culture of radish. For the Greenhouse 
Trial the environmental conditions were largely controlled. 
Therefore in both trials the number of plants per plot and 
the resulting growth were very uniform. A long frost free 
season and good growing conditions until late in September 
allowed extra time for maximum plant development. In the 
Greenhouse Trial watering was gradually reduced during a 
period of three weeks to induce maturity of the plants at 
about the same time and in similar manner to that which 
would be accomplished naturally for plants growing out of

doors. 


Growth of radish in the Quality Trial and the 
Generation Trial was slow due to less favorable conditions 
of light and heat in the greenhouse in the late fall and 
winter months. 


Other Influencing Factor s 

During the cool storage period of hypocotyls ob¬ 
tained from the Greenhouse Trial a disease caused by a 
fungus, one of the Phycomycetes identified as Phvtophthora 
p arasitica . began to infect some of the hypocotyls. Upon 
finding that control measures would be difficult and the 
numbers of hypocotyls would become reduced with time, tests 
were terminated at the end of a period of six weeks in 
cool storage.

KSSULTS 


The .work of this thesis is presented under three 
main headings, namely; Treatment Effect on Plant Develop¬ 
ment, Treatment Effect on Hypocotyl Quality and Treatment 
Effect on the T^ Generation, The first two of these head¬ 
ings are in turn reported under two subheadings, viz.; 

(1) Visual Observations and Quantitive Observations, 

(2) Firmness of Hypocotyl Tissue and Soluble Solids Content, 
respectively. Most of the results have been presented 
photographically and graphically. The graphs shown in 
Figures 33 to 41 have been based directly upon correspond¬ 
ing original data given in the Appendix tables presented in 
pages i to xvii. Certain abbreviations and symbols have 
been used in the graphs. Similarily abbreviations have been 
used with the pictures, Figures 1 to 32, to describe the 
treatments represented. Table 2 contains a key to the 
abbreviations used in pictures and graphs.

Treatment Effect on Plant Development 

1. Visual Observations 

Certain effects on the growth of the plants soon 
became evident following the pre-emergence application 
of MH-40 in the Soil application Trial and in the 
seed treatment of the Greenhouse Trial. With both in¬ 
crease in the rate of application of the soil treat- 

and 

ments from 10 Id 20,/5201b 3'0 pounds per acre there was a re¬ 
duction in the number of plants which emerged. Com¬ 
pared with the control plots emergence was delayed as 
much as seven days. The emerged plants gradually 
became chlorotic and about 95^ died about one month 
after sowing without having passed the seedling stage. 
These plants were photographed 20 days after sowing and 
were shown in Figure 1. 

The results from the \.0%/2 hours rate of the seed 
soaking treatments of the Greenhouse Trial were remark¬ 
ably similar to those obtained from the Soil Application 
Trial. This is illustrated in Figure 2, and should be 
compared to Figure 1. 

Plants from both the Soil Application Trial and 
the l.Qfo/2 hours seed treatment of the Greenhouse Trial 
were lifted and washed. Examination revealed a greater 
inhibition of growth in the roots than in the shoot 
portion for both methods of treatment. This result

Approximately ten per cent of those plants left 
growing in the plots receiving the l.Oj^/2 hours seed 
treatment managed to remain alive throughout the entire 
growing season. Only some six per cent of these plants 
developed a flower stalx and bore two or three small seed 
pods. One of these plants is shown in Figure 24. 

As shown in Figures 4 and 5 the seed soaking treat¬ 
ment of 0. 02%/2 hours caused much less severe effects, 
but inhibition of growth was quite marxed in certain 
plants. This variation in effect upon the plants grown 
from seed soaked in 0.2 and 0.02;& solutions for two 
hours is clearly seen in these photographs. Inhibition 
of vegetative development was readily visible in the 
0.2%/2 hours seed treatment throughout the entire season. 
The quantitative results noted later in Figures 33 and 
40 support this statement. There was a smaller per¬ 
centage of the plants showing severe retardation in 

growth from the 0.02^/2 hours treatment as compared to 

0.02/fe 

the 0.2$/2 hours seed treatment. For the/ treatment 
quantitative data showed that growth was not significantly 
different from the control with the exception of renewed 
root growth (Figures 7 and 36) as described later.

Figure 7. Roots of radish newly cut from base of hypocotyl 
plus vermiculite media firmly held by new rootlet growth made 
during 41 days period in cool storage at 12° C. Renewed root 
growth was nil following early foliage treatment at 4*0 lb,./A 
(upper right), early root 10 lb./A (second from lower left), 
and the combined early foliage and root at 4.0 and 10.0 
lb./A respectively (lower right). In contrast, the amount 
of new rootlet development in the remaining treatments is 
similar to that of the control (right center). Weight of 
roots and vermiculite are graphed in Figure 36. Greenhouse

Differences between the control plants and those 
receiving the 0.01^/g- hour seed treatment were not 
large enough at any stage of growth to be observed 
visually. Figures33, 34, 36 and 40 illustrate such 
quantitative differences as were measured. 

The visual results from the early foliage treat¬ 
ments for the G-reenhouse and Field Trials can be most 
conveniently given together. Inhibition in the growth 
of the plant tops promptly followed the early foliage 
treatments of 2 and 4 pounds per acre Greenhouse Trial 
and 4 and 8 pounds per acre in the Field Trial. The 
difference in growth between the controls and these 
treatments was apparent four to five days after spraying 
and was quite obvious from one weef to more than three 
weeas following the date of spraying. 

In the Greenhouse Trial the effects of the MH-40 
were so drastic from the 4.0 pound treatment that ap¬ 
proximately 30^> of the plants slowly died before the 
date of harvest, September 16, and there was no ap¬ 
preciable amount of growth made by the plants which 
were living before the end of the growing season, 15 
weeks after spraying. These results are demonstrated 
by photographs in Figures 8, 27 and 28 and by graph in 
FiguroB 33 and 40. Only a few plants in the 2.0 pound 
treatment of the Greenhouse Trial died. The plants

appeared to be as severely retarded as those in the 4.0 
pound treatment for a period of some four to five weeks. 
After this time weak lateral growth from the basal por¬ 
tion of the shoot developed. This is shown in Figure 
28. The same observations were made in the Field Trial 
for the 8.0 and 4.0 pound treatments. Approximately ten 
per cent of the plants died following the 8.0 pound 
treatment and 5^ died following the 4.0 pound treatment. 
In both treatments the secondary cause of the death of 
these plants was disease. Weak shoot growth resumed from 
below the original terminal approximately three weeks 
after spraying. The time at which growth resumed in 
the 8, and 4 lb. treatments was approximately the same. 
This observation is supported by the quantitative data 
on the number of days from emergence to bloom stages as 
noted later under the beading, "Quantitative Observat¬ 
ions" . 


The late foliage sprays of 2 and 4 pounds per acre 
in the Greenhouse Trial and of the 4 and 8 pounds per 
acre in the Field Trial produced less marked effects 
upon the vegetative growth than upon reproductive 
growth. Nevertheless there was marked inhibition in 
lateral growth and further vegetative development was 
very meager and weak during the following seven weeks 
of normal growing season. This is shown in Figures 8, 
23t 24, and 31, and by quantitative data described 


later.

The effects upon vegetative and reproductive growth 
of MH-40 applied at the same time and at the lighter 
rates of treatment in either the G-reenhouse or Field 
Trials were less pronounced than was caused by the heav¬ 
ier rates already described. Therefore the description 
of the results shown photographically in Figures 7 » 14 to 
21 and 33 to 41 provides sufficient elaboration of the 
effects obtained for these lighter rates of treatment. 



Figure 8. Typical development of plants growing in two 
plots divided by the ruler. In the foregroun d the top 
growth of the six plants is very small 63 days following 
the early foliage treatment at 4 lb. per acre. The sparse 
development and short axillary branches characterize the 
plants 24 days following the second foliage treatment at 
the same rate. Greenhouse Trial.

weight of Plant Tons. The mean weights of the 
plant tops harvested at market size nine days after 
treatment, are shown graphically in Figure 33 Dased 
upon the data given in Appendix I and II. 

In the G-reenhouse Trial the effect of the 
0.01fo/i hour seed treatment is the only one which 
resulted in a significant increase in weight, at 
P equal to .01. The 0.02^/2 hours seed and the 
0.4 and 2.0 pounds per acre early foliage treatments 
and all root treatments resulted in no significant 
differences from the corresponding control plots 
for each trial. In the early foliage treatments 
there was a significant decrease in weight from the 
0.1 and 1.0 pound per acre rates and a highly sig¬ 
nificant decrease from the 4.0 pound per acre ap¬ 
plication of MH-40. 

In the Field Trail early foliage treatments 
the decrease in top weight was significant for 
the 0.5 pound rate and highly significant for the 
4.0 and 8.0 pounds per acre rates.

Kypocotyl Weight. For the Greenhouse Trial the 
data on hypoeotyl weight are tabulated in Appendix 
III. Only the 0. 20°/o/2 hours seed treatment resulted 
in a highly significant decrease in weight. Results 
from the Field Trial revealed no significant differ¬ 
ences between treatments in the weight of hypocotyls 
harvested at market size. 

Shoot Reyrowth. The weight and height of the 
new growth of shoots from cool stored hypocotyls 
from treatments of the Greenhouse Trial are shown 
graphically in Figure 34 based upon the data given 
in Appendix III and IV. All the significant dif¬ 
ferences were lower than the control. 

The weight of shoots from the 0.2j&>/2 hour seed, 
the 2 and 4 pounds early foliage and the 10 pounds 
per acre early root treatments was less than the 
shoot weight of the controls at P equal to .01. 

The weight of shoots from the 1.0 pound per acre 
early foliage treatment was below that of the control 
but was significantly so only at the 5 per cent level. 
In the 1.0%/2 hours seed treatment there were not 
enough hypocotyls at the time of storage to be in¬ 
cluded in this test. 

The height of new shoot growth was collected 
for the purpose of noting any great variations in

the type of growth made. Figure 34 shows that the 
height of regrowth follows quite closely the same 
trend or pattern as that for the weight with the 
exception of the 0. OVfo/2 hours seed treatment. At 
the latter rate the type of growth was found to he 
comprised of a greater number of shorter vegetative 
shoots than those produced in the other treatments. 

Roo t Regrowth. The weight of root regrowth ob¬ 
tained from hypocotyls placed in cool storage at the 
market size for six weeks included also the vermic- 
ulite firmly adhering to individual roots that were 
cut off at the base of the hypocotyl. Marked visual 
differences in the amount of root regrowth are shown 
in Figure 7. Quantitative differences are shown 
graphically in Figure 36 based upon the original 
weight data given in Appendix VII. 

Figure 36 indicates that in the following treat¬ 
ments there were increases in the root regrowth at 
the 1 per cent level of significance: 

1. The 0.01%/^ hour and 0. 02%/2 hours seed 
treatments. 

2. The 0.5 pound per acre early foliage treat¬ 
ment . 

3. The 0.1 and 0.5 pound per acre early root 


treatments.

In the 4 pounds per acre early foliage and the 10 
pounds per acre early root treatments highly sig¬ 
nificant reductions in root growth were noted. The 
weights for the 1.0 and 2.0 pounds early foliage 
treatments were significantly below the control 
for a P value of .05. 

bodging of Stems. Typical lodging of the plant 
tops in the field for the 8 pounds per acre early 
foliage treatment is shown in Figure 11. A visual 
score was made on the amount of lodging of plant 
tops in the Field Trial 13 weeks after sowing. These 
results are shown graphically in Figure 37 and in 
data form in Apnendix X. Only the 8 pounds per 
acre late foliage treatment showed a highly sig¬ 
nificant reduction in the amount of lodging, and 
only the 8 pounds early foliage and 4 pounds late 
foliage treatments showed a reduction significant 
at the 5 per cent level. 

Plant Height. The mean plant height in cent¬ 
imeters, taken near the end of the growing season 
or 13 wee&s after sowing in the Greenhouse Trial 
and 12 weeks after sowing in the Field Trial, is 
recorded in Appendix XI and XII and is illustrated 
graphically in Figure 38.

Figure 38 shows that treatments of MH-40 result 
in a definite trend towards a reduction in plant 
height with increasing rates of application. This 
reduction was most marked in the seed treatments 
and the early foliage treatments. Furthermore the 
reduction in plant height with increasing rates of 
application of ME was generally more pronounced in 
the G-reenhouse Trial than in the Field Trial. This 
was indicated by the difference in the slope of the 
curves for the two trials as shown in Figure 38. 

In the Field Trial, Figure 38 indicates that 
neither the 0.5 pound early and late foliage treat¬ 
ments nor the root treatments resulted in signific¬ 
ant reductions in plant height. However significant 
reductions resulted from the use of the 4 pounds 
late foliage treatment at the 5 per cent level and 
also from the 8 pounds late and 4 and 8 pounds early 
foliage treatments at the 1 per cent level. 

In the G-reenhouse Trial the following treat¬ 
ments caused highly significant reductions in 
plant height: 

1. The 0.2^ and l.Ofo/2 hours seed treatments. 

2. The 0.1, 0.5, 2.0 and 4.0 pounds per acre 
early foliage treatments. 

3. The 4 pounds late foliage treatment.

4. The 10 pounds early root treatment. 

Other treatments resulted in reductions in plant 
height which were significant at the 5 per cent 
level of probability. ‘These are listed below: 

1. The 2.0 pounds early foliage treatment. 

2. The 4 pounds early root treatment.

Final Plant X e ipht. Fresh and air dry weights 
of entire plants were obtained 15 weeks after sow¬ 
ing in the Field Trial. Appendix XIII contains 
the data on the fresh weight of whole plants har¬ 
vested from half the usual plot and Table 3 pre¬ 
sents the yields of the treatments found signific¬ 
ant. Table 3 shows a highly significant reduction 
in the fresh weight of the 4 and 8 pounds early 
foliage treatments. The least significant values 
obtained after analyzing were very large compared 
with corresponding values obtained for the dry 
weights. The result is that the fresh weight 
value based upon half plots is a much less refined 
measure of plant growth than the air dry weights. 

The data on the air dry weight are contained 
in Appendix XIV and given graphically in Figure 39* 
Two unexpected results are shown in Figure 39; first, 
a highly significant increase in weight for the 0.5 
pound late foliage treatment; secondly, in the late 
root treatment there was no significant reduction

in weight at the 10 pounds per acre rate while at the 
4 and 20 pounds rates there were significant reductions. 
In the early root treatments there were significant 
reductions at the 4 and 10 pounds rates hut none at 
the 20 pounds rate of application. At 4 and 8 pounds 
per acre in both the early and late foliage applic¬ 
ations there were highly significant reductions in 
total plant weight.

XV and shown graphically in Figure 40. In this trial, 
all treatments which showed highly significant re¬ 
ductions, compared with the control plot data, are 
listed as follows: 

1. The 0.2$/2 hours seed treatment. 

2. The 0.1, 0.5, 2.0 and 4.0 pounds per acre 
early foliage treatments. 

3. The 4.0 pounds per acre late foliage 
treatment. 

4. The 0.5, 4 and 10 pounds per acre early 
root treatments. 

In the l,0 a /o/2 hours seed treatment there were not 
enough plants remaining at the end of the season 
upon which to base an accurate score on the amount 
of vegetative growth. However the amount of growth 
was much less than that for the 0.2>/2 hours seed 
treatment. 

(b) Reproductive Development 

Date of Flowering. A striMng delay in the re¬ 
productive development followed the early foliage applic¬ 
ations of MH-40 at the two heavier rates in both Green¬ 
house and Field Trials. This is shown by Table 4, which 
contains the significant part of complete data collected 
from the Field Trial and this delay is represented in 
Appendix VIII as the mean number of days from emergence 
to first bloom. Table 5, obtained from Appendix IX, con-

Seed Pod Set. Data from Appendix XVI, graphed 
in Figure 41, show the results obtained from a visual 
rating on the amount of seed pod set from treatments 
in the G-reenhouse Trial. At a P value of .05 the 
following treatments resulted in significant reduc¬ 
tions below the controls: 

1. The 0.2^»/2 hours seed soaking treatment. 

2. The 0.1 pound early foliage treatment. 

3. The 0.1 pound early root treatment. 

4. The 10 pounds late root treatment. 

The following treatments resulted in highly sig¬ 
nificant reductions below the control: 

1. The 1.0fo/2 hours seed soaking treatment. 

2. The 0.5, 2.0 and 4.0 pounds early foliage 
treatments. 

3. The 2.0 and 4.0 pounds late foliage 
treatments. 

4. The 4.0 and 10.0 pounds early root treat¬ 
ments . 

The above results show that the earlier treatment 
is applied in the life cycle of the plant the greater 
is the reduction in seed pod set. Foliage sprays

Effects on Kygocotvl duality 

The effects of MH-40 on the hypocotyl quality of 
radish were measured as; (l) the firmness of the hypocotyl 
tissue after a period of storage and (2) the per cent con¬ 
tent of total soluble solids. 

1. Firmness of Hypocotyl Tissu e 

It was assumed that ease of or resistance to pun- 
ture by a dynamometer plunger provided a measure of 
tissue breakdown, and that in the case of healthy hy- 
pocotyls this breakdown was a result of respiration 
activity during the period of storage and root and 
shoot regrowth. Data collected on this statistic 
after six weeks storage are shown in Figure 35 for the 
G-reenhoiEe Trial. The graph, based upon the data given 
in Appendix VI, shows a highly significant increase in 
the resistance to puncture of the hypocotyl for the 0.5 
and 2.0 pounds per acre early foliage treatments and a 
significant increase for the 4 pounds early foliage 
treatment. Radish plants given an early foliage ap¬ 
plication at 4.0 pounds per acre showed no significant 
difference in tissue firmness following a cold storage 
period of 18 days. Following 54 days storage however 
there was a highly significant increase in the hypocotyl 
resistance to puncture. The average dynamometer reading

for sprayed and control treatments following 54 days 
of cool storage at 4° C is given in Table 6, and these 
figures show an average increase of 0.79 dynamometer 
units per hypocotyl. This represents an increase of 
4.3 per cent over the controls.

2. Total Soluble Solids Content of Hypocotyls 

A Bausch and Lomb hand refractometer (0 - 60% range) 
was used to determine soluble solids from expressed sap 
of radish hypocotyls. Readings from this refractometer 
were taken at the market size of the hypocotyl or seven 
days after foliage treatment at 4 pounds per acre. Data 
are given in Table 7. The results show a highly sig¬ 
nificant increase of 1.35 per cent total soluble solids 
(an Increase of 24.7 per cent over the control), or on 
the basis of relative water content this may be a cor¬ 
responding decrease in per cent moisture of hypocotyls.

Effects of Treatment upon the T-j_ Generation 

Data collected one month following sowing on the 
germination ability of the T^ generation planted in loam 
soil in greenhouse flats is given in Appendix XVII. The 
emergence count, taken one month after sowing, shows a 
highly significant reduction in the per cent of emergence 
of the seed collected from plants receiving late foliage 
application of MH at 4.0 pounds per acre, and a significant 
reduction for the 4.0 pounds late root treatment of MH. 

Seed from the 8 pounds late foliage application were not 
viable but consisted of shrunken seed parts and a shrivelled 
brown seed coat. In the 4 pounds late foliage treatment 
there were approximately 80 per cent of the seeds which were 
in the same condition. 

Three weeks after the seedlings had emerged a root rot 
became established, largely due to very damp conditions.

This disease caused much girdling of the stems which in turn 
caused unnatural formative effects. For that reason no 
attempt was made to determine whether ME applied to the 
parent plants produced formative effects upon the T^ gen¬ 
eration, but no gross formative effects due to treatment 
were evident in a population of approximately 450 plants. 


DISCUSSION OF RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS 


1. Physiological Effects of Treatment 

Maleic hydrazide primarily exerts its physiological 
influence on the vegetative and reproductive processes 
of the radish plant through arresting the growth of all 
meristems present at any stage of active growth shortly 
after direct or indirect application of the chemical. 

This explains the observation that with few exceptions 
MR reduced the weight of hypocotyls, plant tops, the 
regrowth of rootlets and shoots from hypocotyls kept 
in cool storage, and reduced the amount of seed pod set. 

The apparent stimulating effect of MH at the lighter 
rates of treatments, shown in Figure 36, for the regrowth 
of roots from hypocotyls may be explained on the basis 
of findings of Klein and Leopold as reported by Zukel 
(35). That is, stimulation is affected only through the 
MH acting as an auxin competitor in the presence of true

growth regulators. Then MH may stimulate growth through 

the removal of inhibition due to the presence of over- 

no 

abundant auxin. The observation that/significant in¬ 
creases in shoot regrowth (Figure 34) at the same rates 
which induced significant increases in the root regrowth 
(Figure 36) may be explained on the basis of the well 
known principle that more auxin is required to inhibit 
growth in shoots than in roots. Therefore less MH would 
be required to remove the inhibition in the growth of 
roots than for shoots or, as a ccnoTL ary, less MH may 
induce an apparent stimulation in the growth of the 
former but not in the latter. 

The one significant increase in yield noted fol¬ 
lowing a late foliage application of 0.5 pound per acre 
is undoubtedly due to the chance position of this treat¬ 
ment in the field plan. In all four replicates the pos¬ 
ition of this treatment occurred to one end near a 
hedge which imparted a marked beneficial effect in growth. 
This was the only treatment which had more than two 
out of four replicated plots occurring near the hedge. 

The results showing a reduction in the amount of 
lodging following heavy foliage treatments of MH, 

(Figure 37) are interpreted simply on the basis of 
external observations. Lodging in comparison to the 
controls was reduced following heavy foliage sprays at 
the pre-harvest size stage and at the full bloom size

stage because further shoot growth was so meager and 
short that the plant tops were much lighter in weight 
than the controls. 

It was noted that the duration of inhibition or 
severity of effect was increased if MK was applied 
(l) to plants early In their life cycle or (2) when 
plants were rapidly growing. These are results which 
may be expected since MK acts through the physiological 
processes. The effect would probably be greatest when 
the physiological activity is the most rapid. Recovery 
from such inhibition or injury would be more difficult 
for very young plants than for older and better estab¬ 
lished plants. This was found to be the case 'following 
treatments made at the stages of pre-harvest and pre¬ 
emergence compared to the full bloom stage. 

The response from the root method of application 
was less severe and direct than the response from the 
foliage method of application. This result may be 
expected to follow from the more indirect path of ab¬ 
sorption necessary if the MH must pass through the soil 
before being absorbed by the plant roots rather than 
being absorbed through the leaves. 

The mechanism of the effect of MH in reducing the 
viability of the T^_ generation seed is a similar 

problem to that involved following direct applic-

ation to plants. Presumably, the reduction in seed 
viability would be responsible for some reduction or 
retardation in eventual plant growth. In any case it 
could represent a serious loss to seed producers or 
to gardeners utilizing seed from treated plants. 

The results support the conclusion that MH acts 
as a temporary growth inhibitor through arresting cell 
division in terminal meristems. One explanation for 
this effect is that MH acts in opposition to the nat¬ 
ural plant hormones. Other actions may also be involved 
and until the exact mechanism of the action of MH is 
known no more definite conclusion can be drawn. 

Decreased physiological activity is the most 
logical explanation for the significant increases in 
resistance to puncture of the hypocotyl following 
pre-harvest foliar sprays as reported for two separate 
trials. This is supported by the results illustrated 
in Figures 34 and 36 showing reduced shoot and root re¬ 
growth and the conclusion of others that MH treatment 
causes a reduction in the rate of respiration. The 
possibility is not excluded that other changes, such 
as more rapid loss of water and a tougher outer tissue, 
also contributed to the results obtained. However since 
there was no visible basis for such supposition it is 
concluded that the result can be attributed to decreased

respiration and regrowth which would result in less 
rapid morphological breakdown of the hypoeotyl tissue. 

Following pre-harvest foliage sprays there was a 
significant increase in the per cent of total soluble 
solids of the hypocotyls, measured on the basis of ex¬ 
tracted juice available. This increase may bave been 
due to (l) a decrease in the amount of water present, 

(2) an increase in the manufacture of carbohydrates 
that were translocated to the hypocotyls, (3) a decrease 
in the rate of carbohydrate removal from the hypocotyls 
either through (a) a decrease in the rate of respir¬ 
ation, or (b) interference in the transport of car¬ 
bohydrates away from the hypocotyls. The first of 
these suggestions appears to be the most likely with 
the other possibilities somewhat less likely to account 
for the increase noted. Such a conclusion is based 
upon the observation that 18 days later there was no 
significant difference in total soluble solids con¬ 
tent. If a true difference in carbohydrates were pre¬ 
sent then this difference should only have been lost 
in storage due to increased respiration or growth ac¬ 
tivity. However the other results obtained show that 
growth activity was less (Figures 34 and 36) and 
strongly suggest , in agreement with other reports 
(30) (33), that respiration was reduced following pre¬ 
harvest foliage treatments (See Figure 33). Further-

more if MH treatment hinders the conduction of carbohy¬ 
drates, as G-reulach (15) has reported, or causes injury 
of the vascular tissue, as other workers have suggested 
(31) (36), then it is hard to explain how more total 
soluble solids would be translocated to the hypocotyls. 

On the other hand if MH treatment is followed by an in¬ 
crease in the transpiration of water (25) (32) then the 
apparent increase in the percentage of total soluble 
solids might be explained as largely or entirely due to 
a decrease in the moisture content of the hypocotyl. 

Such a conclusion need not cast doubt on other reports 
of increased carbohydrate content in root crops following 
treatment, but does suggest that all measurements of 
carbohydrate content should be made on the basis of 
known dry weight or a known amount of moisture. 

2. Anatomical Effects of Treatment 

Only two detailed accounts (23) (31) describing the 
anatomical effect of MH has been obtained to date, and 
these offer flQ explanation for the observations noted. 

Struckmeyer (31) has reported an increase in leaf 
thickness due to MH treatment which is attributed to 
a looser arrangement of the cells and partly to an in¬ 
crease in the size of the cells rather than increased 
cell numbers. Mcllrath (23) attrubutes thickening in 
cotton leaves following treatment entirely to cell

enlargement. The 65 per cent increase in leaf thickness 

for treated radish leaves over that of the control is 

attributed by the author to be due to the differentiation of 

an extra irregular row of palisade cells and also to a 

looser cell arrangement. Accurate counts were not made 
/ from the ten slides prepared 

to determine if there was any increase in the number of 
rows of cells. The similarity existing between the 
structure noted in the treated and non treated leaves 
to that observed in many species for sun and shade 
leaves respectively appears to be sufficient to warrant 
further comparisons of this type. To date no report 
has been found stating that MH treatment has resulted in 
an increase in the number of rows of palisade cells. 

The observation that palisade cells of treated 
leaves were largely in a state of collapse as compared 
to untreated leaves is directly in line with Struckmeyer's 
results (31) in the Croft Easter Lily. She attributes 
the difference noted to a disintegration of the chlo- 
roplasts in both palisade and spongy parenchyma cells. 

In the radish leaf examination was not detailed enough 
to give the reason for the collapsed state of palisade 
cells in treated leaves.

SUMMARY 

1. Experiments were conducted using the common radish as 
the plant material with the objective of learning more 
about the effects of maleic hydrazide upon the growth 
and quality of root crops and upon general plant 
development. 

2. Maleic hydrazide (Naugatuck MH-40) was applied in 
quantities expressed as active ingredient by two 
methods for each of three stages in the life cycle of 
the radish as follows: 

(a) Pre-emergence stage 

(i) To the soil at 10, 20 and 30 pounds MH per 
acre two days after sowing. 

(ii) By soaking seed in treatments at 1.0/2, 0.2/2, 
0.02/2 and 0.0l/i per cent concentration 
per hours time. 

(b) Pre-market size stage 

(i) In foliage sprays at 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0,4.0 
and 8.0 pounds per acre. 

(ii) To the roots through the soil at 0.1, 0.5, 

4.0, 10 and 20 pounds per acre. 

(c) Full bloom stage 

( i) In foliage sprays at 0.1, 0.5, 2.0, 4.0 aid 
8.0 pounds per acre. 

(ii) To the roots through the soil at 0.1, 0.5, 

4.0, 10 and 20 pounds per acre.

3. She sensitivity of the plants to the effects of MH 
treatment varied in the following manner: 

(a) Directly with the rate of application. 

(b) Directly with the rate of growth. 

(c) Inversely with the age of the vegetative or 
reproductive stages. 

(d) More directly and severely for the foliage method 
than for the root method of application. 

4. MH applied at medium or heavy rates by root or foliage 
treatments at all three stages was found to result in 
significant reductions in the weight of plant tops, 
hypocotyls, and In shoot and rootlet regrowth from 
hypocotyls subjected to a cool storage period. This 
was due to Inhibition in the growth of the terminal 
meristems. 

5. Dow rates of MH treatment induced significant increases 
in the amount of rootlet regrowth from hypocotyls in 
storage but not In the regrowth of shoots. 

6. Foliage sprays of MH at 4 pounds per acre made at the 
pre-harvest size stage resulted in: 

(a) An apparent significant increase in the per cent 
of total soluble solids per hypocotyl which was 
attributed to a decrease in the moisture content. 

(b) A significant decrease in the rate of softening 
of the hypocotyl tissue in storage as measured 
by resistance to puncture.

7 • MH sprayed to the foliage at 4 and 8 pounds per acre 

at the full bloom stage resulted ini 

(a) Abnormalities, sterility and abscission of floral 
parts if seed formation was not already begun 
prior to treatment, 

(b) Increased seed pod diameter containing seed 
shrunken in varying degrees if seed formation 
had commenced prior to treatment. 

(c) Great reductions in the viability of the seed 
formed. 

8. Foliage sprays of MH induced anatomical changes in 

the lea£ which are noted below: 

(a) The formation of an extra and irregular row of 
palisade cells formed immediately beneath the nor¬ 
mal two rows. 

(b) An increase in leaf thickness of more than 50 
per cent. 

9. It is concluded that MH acts in the following ways: 

(a) As a temporary growth inhibitor when applied in 
sufficient amounts. It promptly arrests the cell 
division in the terminal meristem possibly through 
its action in opposition to the natural plant 
hormones. 

(b) Regrowth of plant parts is reduced, and thus the 
rate of morphological breakdown in storage is 
delayed.

10. Comments which may be developed from this study are: 
(a) MH may he useful for increasing the storage life 
of certain plant products, but its use on edible 
food plants cannot he recommended until more is 
known about the mammalian toxicity of this 
chemical. 

(h) For optimum results it will be important to know 
the best time and rate for application of MH to 
plants.
