SOME ASPECTS OF TEST AND DESIGN 


AT 

RADIO STATION C. K.U.A . 

The tests and designs, for the University of Alberta's 
Radio Station C.K.U.A., included in this paper are part 
of the work done by Mr. Cornish and myself during 1951 
and 1932. 

For the most part we did not touch the studio apparatus 
since it was purchased with the makers guarantee but 
confined ourselves to the broadcasting station proper. 

We will then consider only that part of the equipment 
starting after the studio amplifiers. This includes the 
lines from the studio to the station, the speech amp¬ 
lifying equipment, the modulators and the oscillating 
circuit in the transmitter. 

Also there will be descriptions of the design and 
assembly of some of the equipment used in the tests. 

EARLY HISTORY ; 

A short description of the early history of station 
C.K.U.A. might help to show why it was desirable to 
carry out these tests. The station was placed in oper¬ 
ation on November the 21, 1927 and at that time can-

sisted of a Meisner Oscillator and Heising system of 
modulation.(See Pig. #1 for diagram.) The lines from the 
studio to the station were and still are part of the 
telephone system of the University. Pour lines into the 
station are used, for the following purposes. Two for 
broadcast transmission purposes, one for telephone 
communication to the studio and the fourth for city 
telephone. The two broadcast lines with suitable 
switching arrangements fed into a 50 watt, speech 
amplifier the volume of the signals being controlled 
by a potentiometer across the line. The speech amplifier 
was connected by means of a transformer to two 250 watt 
modulators in parallel, which modulated two 250 watt 
oscillators also connected in parallel. The oscillating 
circuit and. the antenna circuit are described by Mr. 
Cornish in another paper. Such was the original station 
and continually since that time a process of evolution 
has been going on. Many changes were made before the 
writer became connected with the station and- unless 
they are of particular importance and still incorporated 
in the station they will not be consideredhere.

THE BEAT FREQUENCY OSCILLATOR 


Shortly after commencing these tests, the necessity of 
having some method of supplying a variable audio frequency 
sine wave of known frequency and containing a very small 
percentage of harmonics was realized. For this purpose 
a beat frequency.odcillator was constructed. 

Two oscillators, one fixed and the other variable, 
are coupled by means of two pick up coils. The difference 
in the frequencies generated^gives rise to a beat note 
which is detected and then amplified by means of a 
resistance coupled amplifier. (See Fig. #2). The circuit 
is similar to that used in the General Radio Compahy 1 s 
Beat Frequency Oscillator, 

The fixed circuit A was built to oscillate at 
approximately 50,000 cycles. The condenser Cq has a 
capacity of .0025mfd. The inductance Lq composed of 
154 turns of #18 D.C.C. copper wire in 4 layers on a 
10 cm. diameter tube has a value of approximately 
4.05 millihenries. Lg,the grid coil has 34 turns of the 
wire wound on top of Lq. Its value is about 0.9 mh. 

The pickup coil L3 has 18 turns also #18 wound outside 
of the other two. 

The second and variable oscillator has a coil exactly 
the same as the above. The condenser branch shown in detail

by a 43 plate variable condenser (.OOlmfd) C 3 . Another 
fixed condenser C 4 (.0004mfd) can be cut in or out of 
the circuit to change the range of the instrument.

LINES FROM STUDIO TO STATION 


1. Measurement of Impedance. 

In order that the transmission of var ying currents 
may be carried on with a minimum of distortion, an 
amplifier must be fed into the transmission line 
through a matching transformer. Looking at Fig. #3 the 
matching transformer is choosen so that its impedance 
looking from A towards B when the line is connected is 
equal to that of the output circuit of the amplifier. 
The impedance looking from B to A when the amplifier is 
connected must be equal to that of the line. 3 

This principle applies whenever two circuits are 
joined together and thus another transformer must be 
used where the line feeds into the speech amplifier. 
Since our transformers at both ends were bought for 
a 500 ohm line we decided to measure the characteristic 
impedance to see how it compared with this value. 

The impedances of the line open and shorted were 
measured with an input frequency of 1000 cycles. 

The characteristic impedance therefore equals 

z k - \/Z 0 pen^short 


* It should be noted here that this matching is not? 
very critical and a difference 2x or 5x will not produce 
noticeable.dtisFor'i'oin,

Explanation: In the table the readings have been 

adjusted so that the reading for any given frequency 
represents its attenuation when compared with the 
attenuation of a 100 cycle note. 

The reading for the frequency of 7000 cycles is 
only approximate because the oscillator is not 
calibrated accurately for such high frequencies. 






the power levels being measured by two General Radio 
Company Level Indicators Type 586-A. The results 
obtained on Line #1 are shown in Fig* #5 and Table #1. 
Line #2 gave almost identical characteristics so they 
are not shown here. The change in transmission level 
from about 60 cycles to 7000 cycles is in the 
neighbourhood of 0.5 decibels, which is well within 
the range allowable for good transmission of sound.’ 

VOLUME CONTROL AND INPUT TRANSFORMER . 

The General Radio Volume Control Type 552-TC was on 
order at the time of making these tests and. has 
since been installed. Curves were therefore not taken 
on it but it is guaranteed, by the makers to have a 
flat freo x uency response. 

The Fenkins and Adair Input Transformer is also of 
standard make and its frequency characteristic curve 
is assumed flat since we have no equipment capable 
of testing it. Some readings were taken using the 
volume indicators as explained, above but it was 
found that they put too much load on the output 
sides of the transformers and spoiled the voltage 

regulation to shell an extent that the readings were 
o£ no vo la €* 

* The db or decibel is the unit used in measuring 
power level drops and is choosen so that 1 db is the 
smallest change which can be detected by the ear.

THE SPEECH AHPLIEYING TUBE AND ITS COUPLING CIRCUIT. 


A short digression is made here to outline the different 
types and classes of amplifiers so that the part 
following will be clearer. In all of the discussion 
we will confine ourselves to the triode since that is 
the only type of tube used in the station. 

As is well known the triode consists of three 
elements, one of which, the cathode or filament, 
supplies electrons, another the anode or plate, usually 
placed around the filament and. to which the electrons 
flow, and the third a modifying electrode called the 
grid and placed in the space between the other two. 

The latter modifying electrode is made in the form 
of a mesh or grid so that it will not physically 
interrupt the flow of electrons from the filament 
to the plate. The plate current may be changed 
considerably however by varying the potential 
applied, to the grid. 

In the diagram shown in Pig. #7 arrangements are 























. 






















made for measuring the grid bias voltage Eg, the plate 
voltage Eb and the plate current Ip. If Eft is kept 
constant at, say the rated voltage of the tube, and 
Eg is varied, a. graph of plate current against grid 
voltage may be obtained similar to Fig. #8. It will be 
noted that over the straight portion' of the curve erual 
increments of change of grid potential produce equal 
increments of change of plate current. For this reason 
the plate current wave will be a true image of the 
grid voltage wave producing it provided that none of 
the swings of grid voltage go over to the curved ends 
of the graph. When a vacuum tube is operating under 
these conditions it is said, to be a Class A amplifier. 
Class A amplifiers are used in most receiving circuits 
on account of the fact that they give true reproduction 
and also have the largest possible voltage amplification. 1 

On the other hand, when amplifiers are used in 
transmitters it is generally desirable for the sake of 
efficiency to obtain a larger output than is possible 

from Class A amplifiers. This high efficiency of con¬ 
version from from direct to alternating current is 
obtained when the plate current is stopped during part 
of the cycle. 

’ Because the slope of the gurve.Is greatest at the 
straight part.

To illustrate why the above statement is true consider 
the circuit of Fig.#9., which is a typical Class B or 
Class C radio frequency amplifying circuit. If we want 
to keep the system L C in oscillation ife is only 
necessary to supply intermittent pulses from the D.G. 
source Eb« The controlling of these pulses is done from 
the grid circuit, as mentioned before it is desirable 
that the conversion from direct current in the Eb 
circuit to alternating current in the L CLcircuit 
should occur with as little loss as possible in the 
tube. The loss in the tube is the average of the 

product of the instantaneous plate current and the 

loss 

instantaneous plate voltage-. ThIs A may be reduced 

first by making the plate current flow in impulses 

occur 

and second by making these impulses^at times when the 
plate voltage is a minimum. 

Fig, #10 shows how these currents and voltages vary 
with time in the circuit of Fig. #9. The plate current 
only flows when the plate voltage is on the minimum 
half of its swing. In order to make the current flow 
during half the cycle only the grid bias must be 
adjusted to point a in Fig. #8. This is called Class B 
amplification.

If the bias, is made even more negative than point a 
Fig, #8, the flow of plate current will be for 
smaller periods still and the amplifier is then 
known as C&ass C. (See Fig. #11.) ’ 

With the above explanation of Class A, B, and C 
amplifiers we will now consider the methods of using 
more than one tube in order to increase the amplification 
over that which can be obtained from one tube alone. 

There are many of these methods of coupling tubes but 
only two will be described here since they are the only 
ones which have been used in the part of the station 
with which this report is concerned. 

Trans f ormer Coupling 

In the circuit shown in Fig.#12, assume an alternating 
voltage e g=r Eg sin^t (effective value Egi) is applied 
to the grid of tube #1. The amplification factor of the 
tube being , ,the corresponding alternating plate 
voltage may be written Eg i . This voltage causes a 
current to flow in the primary of the transformer 
generating in its secondary a voltage E. This voltage 
is applied to the grid of tube #2 and is amplified 
through this tube appearing in the plate circuit as 
Eg ,f . On account of the fact that the transformer

■ 


may have a step up ratio of voltages the total amount 
of amplification is in creased in the system. 

Impedan ce Co upling . 

The other form of interest at this time is impedance 
coupling. See Fig.^5-. This is probably the most general 
type of coupling used in broadcasting stations for the 
speech amplifying system. 1 The variable plate current 
flowing through the impedance Z aauses a voltage drop 
across it which is applied through the condenser C 
to the grid of the following tube. This condenser also 
prevents the plate supply of t e first tube from apply¬ 
ing a positive potential to the grid of the second tube. 
The grid leak resistance R is inserted to provide a 
a direct connection between the grid and filament of 
the second tube}, preventing the grid from accumulating 
a positive charge and thus blocking its action. 

The Sp ee ch Amp lif ier and it s Coupling . 

We are now in a position to discuss the speech amplifying 
system of the station. The original connections are 
shown in Fig. #12. 

Mutual characteristic curves of the R-211-B tube 
were first taken for values of 785 and 900 volts on 
the plate. These curves are shown in Fig.#15. 

1 The impedance coupled amplifier is much flatter 
in its frequency response curve than transformer coupled 
amplifiers. It does not give as great amplification 
though.

The tube had been operating at a plate voltage 
slightly under 785 and the normal plate current was 
about 20 milliamperes. The normal operating point 
was therefore the point (a) Fig. #15. Thus instead 
of being on the straight portion of the curve it was 
around the lower bend. This must then have been the 
cause of considerable distortion in the amplified 
signal. In order to improve this condition the plate 
voltage was increased to 900 and the bias changed 
to - 45 volts. The operating point was thus changed 
to point (b) Fig, #,15. Under these conditions 
a grid, swing of about 7 volts can occur without 
getting appreciably off the straight portion of the 
curve.' 

With regard to the frequency characteristics of 

the speech amplifying system little can be said. 

Here again we were unable to take measurements with 

any degree of accuracy. We d.ecided to change from 

the traxasformer to impedance coupling, however, 

because it is usually possible to get a better frequency 

response curve from the impedance coupling. The 

connections are shown in Fig. # 15 and the values are 

as follows, Z - 40 rah, R-25,000 ohms, and C = 1 mfd. 

'That this tube is not particularly suited for Glass A 
amplification is quite apparent from ite characteristic 
curves. If however the grid swing is kept down to 
about 7 volts there will be no distortion.

THE MODULATING SYSTEM 


Thus far we have traced through the audio frequency 
section of the radio station. It is impossible to 
broadcast these audio frequency waves as they are 
for two reasond. 

1. At such low frequencies ( 100 to 16,000 cycles} 
the radiated energy is very small. 

2. Even if there were enough energy in the radiated 
audio wave, the air would be so congested that the 
results received would be unintelligible. 

For these reasons the audio signals are superimposed 
on a carried of much higher frequency,( in this case 
580 kilocycles). 

In order that intelligence may be transmitted over 
a radio frequency wave, it is necessary in some way 
to have this wave contain components which can be 
singled out at -the receiving station to reproduce the 
original signal. 

Let us assume that we have a constant amplitude 
carrier of frequency f c . An audio signal of frequency 
f s is to be transmitted along with it. These two waves 
are superimposed by means to be described later and. the 
resulting wave form is shown in Fig. #18.

A simple analysis of this complex wave is as follows. 

At any time t, 

e = E 0 + mE 0 sin 2Ttf'st 

where E 0 is the amplitude of the carrier frequency 
alone, and m, the percentage modulation} in other words 
the ratio Es/Eo* 

Knowing this amplitude we can now write the equation 
for the modulated wave as follows, 

e ~ E 0 ( 1 Hr ms in 2lTf s t ) sin Srffct 

s E 0 sin2rTf c t + mE 0 sin 2TTfst.sin 2TTT c t 
which by expanding the second term becomes 

e =E 0 sin 2Trf e t -y S p lQcos 2rf(f c -f s ) t-E^Ocos^T[(f c lf s ) t 
These three terms in the last equation are explained 
as follows, 

1. The fundamental or carrier Eq sin 2]TT c t. 

2. The upper side band cos 2TT(f c+f s ) t, 

with a freouency of the fundamental plus the signal. 

3. The lower side band m ^o cos 2'JT(fc-f s ) ^, 
with a frequency of the fundamental minus the signal. 

The two side bands are alike in all respects except 
frequency and they are the parts of the complex trans¬ 
mitted wave which carry the intelligence. 

’Note that the percentage modulation or the degree of 
modulation as it is sometimes called can never be over 
100^•but may have any value lower than this.

When a voice signal is to be transmitted we have, not 
a constant amplitude of frequency f s as shown in the 
above £auculations but a very complex wave containing 
many frequencies in the range 100 to 15,000 cycles! 1 
The signal wave could- be analysed by a Courier’s series 
and the resulting sine waves combined with the carrier 
as shown above. All these could then be superimposed to 
give the ultimate form of the transmitted wave. 

Prom the above discussion, the following points arise, 
LpXf it is to be possible to feceive the transmitted 
intelligence exactly as it was applied to the carrier 
wave} 

1. All the frequencies in the signal must be 

h'f * 

contained in the side bands at amplitudes relative to 
their amplitudes in the signal. 

2. There must be no extraneous freouencies added. 

3. They must arrive at their destination in proper 
phase relation with one another. 

If (1) above, does not hold there is said to be 
frequency distortion. This type of distortion is not 
distinctly noticable to the ear providing the power of 
any particular component is not reduced to less than 
70% of its former value. 

’It has been found that in order to get good repro¬ 
duction of the original it is only necessary to transmit 
the freouencies from 100 to 8000 cycles. 





■ i 










. 












. 

. 













The second, non-linear or amplitude distortion, may 
be looked on in another way. If the amplitude of the 
signal received is not directly proportional to the 
amplitude of the input, new frequencies have been in¬ 
troduced which are multiples of harmonics of the original. 
This is very easily detected by the ear and should be 
kept as small as possible. 

The third, called phase distortion, is of comparatively 
little importance since it is only noticed when the phase 
shifts are very large. 

These are the requirements for good transmission of 
sound and we will now see how the method, of modulation 
used in the station fulfils them. 

The Heising system or plate modulation is shown in 
Pig. #19. The signal waves from the speech amplifier 
are impressed on the grids of three 250 watt power 
tubes connected, in parallel. The plates of these three 
power amplifiers or modulators are connected to the 
plates of the Class B, push pull radio frequency 
amplifiers. The audio frequency signal wave causes the 
plate supply voltage of the radio frequency amplifiers 
to take the form of a constant D.C, applied voltage with 
an audio frequency voltage impressed on it. 

’For an explanation of this see Everitt fl Communication 
Engineering" p. 406 et seq.

This is dhown in Fig. #20(a). The radio frequency 
applied to the grids of the K.F. amplifiers is of 
constant amplitude and is shown in Fig* # 20(b). 

The curve marked cutofg grid bias is interpreted as 
follows* The cut off when the plate voltage is at its 
normal value is shown by the straight part of the 
dotted curve. When the plate voltage starts to vary 
on account of the impressed e.m.f* of the modulator 
tubes the grid cut off then varies as shown by the rest 
of the curve. Therefore plate current only flows when 
the grid impressed e.m.f. lied above the dotted srurve. 

The effective plate voltage will therefore follow a 
curve as shown in Fig. # 20(e). The plate current 
resulting from this will be similar to Fig. # 20(c)* 
and the current in the tank circuit will be represented 
by Fig. # 20 (d). Is this enveloped carrier the proper 
form to give a true reproduction of the original signal? 

Assuming that the modulators give a true image of the 
audio frequency, the curve in Fig. # 20(a) will also be 
a true image. The plate current curve Fig. # 20(c) will 
also have an envelope of the same configuration but is 
only on the positive section of the graph. The individual

positive swings of R.F. current give impulses to the 
tank circuit and keep it oscillating, the amplitude of 
the oscillations depending on the amplitude of the 
impulses given therefore follows the same curve as the 
original signal. 

In the station. Fig. # 19, a 625 ohm resistance is 
connected in the plate supply line between the modulators 
and the R.F. amplifiers in order to cut the amplifier 
plate voltage down. This resistance is by-passed by 
a 4 mfd. condenser so that it will allow the audio 
frequency from the modulators to get through with 
very little drop. The two radio frequency chokes in 
parallel prevent the high frequency oscillations in 
the tank circuit from backing up into the modulators. 

It should be noticed that since all the intelligence 
is in the-side bands it is desirable to have the factor 
m as high as possible. The swing of the carrier 
amplitude must therefore be as large as possible and 
this swing must occur without Introducing distortion. 

The measurement of percentage modulation is therefore 
Important and may be carried out in a number of ways.

MEASUREMENT OF T:• E MODULATION FACTOR. 


The method used most successfully in the station is 
described by C.B.Jolliffe on page 660 of the 1929 
Proceedings of the Institute of Radio Engineers. 

It used the electron tube voltmeter, the connections 
being shown in Fig. 21. 

The operation of the voltmeter is as follows. Without 
any radio frequency applied set Rp at zero (i.e. at A) 
and then adjust Rg until the plate current milliammeter 
just fails to show a reading. Now apply the unmodulated 
carrier wave and then adjust Rp until the plate meter 
again just fails to read. The voltage shown on the 
voltmeter at this point is Vq and represents the peak 
value of the unmodulated wave. Modulate the carrier and 
find another value of voltage such that the milliammeter 
again just fails to read. This is Vg. 

Since the currents are proportional to the voltages 
the percentage modulation is then given by 

% modulation ~ ~>JLl x 100 

Vl 

For different settings of the power le^rel indicator 
the foilov^ing results were obtained. See Table ff 2.

The readings of power level are taken at the station 
end of the studio line and -cover the range through 
which the level is' allowed to swing during programs. 





In the station we can let our level indicator swing 
to aapproximately -2 db. without causing distortion. 

At this point we are getting r 61% modulation which is 
very low,' 

Since making the changes mentioned in this report 
we have had. many comments from listeners commending 
the quality of reproduction. That we should have good 
quality in view of some of the things discussed above 
may seem strange and is due to the fact that we keep 
the grid swings on the speech amplifier and the modulators 
down to comparatively small values. 

The result of this, also pointed out above, is that 
we are not getting a very high % modulation and therefore 
not carrying much power in our sidebands. With the 
equipment that we have^and using out? present system 
I think that the station is operating with quite 
satisfactory results. 

The fundamental object In all the work done has been 
to improve the station from the point of view of the 
listening public. In many cases where we would have liked 

’ The modulation was also measured by means of a cathode 
ray oscillograph and values obtained were about 15% 
higher tha n those given here.

to do more experimenting it has been impossiftl© 
because the station had to be kept in operation. 

During all the work on the station we have had the 
cooperation and assistance of Dr. H.J. MacLeod, and 
to him we would express our thanks.
