ANTIBIOTICS IN SWINE NUTRITION 


ABSTRACT 


Three experiments were conducted to study the addition of aureo- 
mycin, penicillin or bacitracin supplements to swine rations. 

The rate of gain of pigs was generally increased by antibiotic 
supplementation of a ration, but responses were variable. Antibiotics 
in combination or in series showed no advantage over a single antibiotic 
supplement. Aureomycin was found to be the most effective in promoting 
growth. Feed efficiency was not affected to any marked degree by anti¬ 
biotic supplementation of the ration. As the level of protein in the 
ration during the growing period was decreased, there was a trend toward 
slower gains whether or not an antibiotic was added to the ration. 

Carcasses from pigs fed an antibiotic to 200 lb. tended to be 
fatter than carcasses from pigs not receiving any antibiotic supplement. 
Removal of the antibiotic at the end of the growing period prevented this 
reduction in carcass quality in two trials; however, in a third trial, 
carcasses from pigs fed an antibiotic to 110 lb. in weight were fatter 
and had a smaller area of loin than those receiving no antibiotic. Car¬ 
casses from antibiotic fed pigs shrank more in weight on cooling than 
carcasses from pigs not receiving an antibiotic, indicating an increased 
water content in the former carcasses. 

Plasma lipid levels were found not to be affected by penicillin 
supplementation of the ration, or by different levels of protein fed. 

In one trial, positive correlations were found between plasma lipid 
levels and thickness of loin or shoulder fat, and negative correlations

with area of loin or backfat score. However, in a second trial no 
significant correlations were found. 

Vitamin A and carotene storage in the liver was not affected 
by antibiotic supplement or level of protein in the ration.

ANTIBIOTICS IN SWINE NUTRITION 


INTRODUCTION 

In Canada, which is a major producer of bacon hogs, there has 
been a constant evolution in feeding and management practices in the 
swine industry. The use of antibiotics in rations for growing pigs 
has been one of the most spectacular advances in swine production dur¬ 
ing the past decade. Antibiotic supplements were first used in swine 
rations in 1 9h9, and most commercial rations for growing pigs now con¬ 
tain an antibiotic. 

The discovery that antibiotics are effective in increasing the 
rate of growth of chicks and pigs arose out of studies on the use of 
vitamin B-^ in their rations. The vitamin 3^^ supplements, formerly 
designated as APF supplements, were crude fermentation residues. It 
was found that certain of these APF supplements resulted in an increased 
rate of -growth greater than that which could be accounted for on the 
basis of their vitamin B^ content. It was demonstrated that the addi¬ 
tional growth response obtained was a result of the presence of residual 
amounts of aureomycin in the supplement. Subsequently, it has been 
shown that many other antibiotics are also effective in increasing the 
rate of growth of chicks and pigs. 

In the latter part of 195>0, the Association of American Feed 
Cpntrol Officials in consultation with others concerned, adopted the 
names "antibiotic feed supplement", or "vitamin B^ and antibiotic 
feed supplement" for all preparations that contained growth promoting 


antibiotics. Canadian requirements for registration of these supple-

ments were brought into effect in January, 1951* 

The effects of antibiotics, other than to stimulate rate of 
growth, have not been definitely established. In some instances, 
increased feed efficiency and a "protein-sparing” effect have been 
reported. It has also been observed that there appeared to be an in¬ 
crease in the fatness of hogs fed an antibiotic supplement. 

In view of the lack of information on the use of antibiotic 
supplements in typical Yrestern Canadian swine rations, it seemed desir¬ 
able to carry out studies to assess the value of such supplements in 
rations of growing and finishing pigs. Consequently, a series of 
experiments was initiated at the University of Alberta in 19U9 to study 
the effect of feeding antibiotics to growing and finishing pigs. This 
thesis is a summary of the results of these studies since 1951*

REVIEW OF LITERATURE 


Antibiotic feed supplements, as they are known today, are devel¬ 
opments of commercial animal protein factor supplements that were being 
used by the feed industry through 19U9 and early 1950. The residual 
products, resulting from fermentations to produce antibiotics, were 
found to contain vitamin or cyanocobalamin, and were fed to supply 
this vitamin. However, responses from various sources of supplements 
containing vitamin differed, and some antibiotic fermentation resi¬ 
dues gave a growth response above that attributable to their vitamin By2 
content (Stokstad et al., ’U9) • At first this additional growth was 
thought to result from another member of the ’’animal protein factor” 
complex, but the real explanation ivas found to be the presence of resi¬ 
dual primary and secondary antibiotics (Jukes et al., *50). 

The growth promoting effect of antibiotics was observed some 
four years before the announcement of a similar effect of antibiotic 
residues. In an effort to sterilize the intestinal tract of chicks for 
vitamin studies, Moore et al. (’U6) fed \ to 1 lb. of streptomycin per 
ton of ration. While the method did not provide the tool they sought, 
they did observe that the streptomycin significantly increased the 
growth of their chicks. However, the high cost of supplementing a 
ration with pure antibiotics prevented the immediate commercial appli¬ 
cation of the observation. 

The work of Moore was used as a guide for interpretation of 
results of experiments studying the animal protein factor. The fermen¬ 
tation residues were found to contain small quantities of antibiotics 
which have since been found to promote growth in poultry, swine, rats

dogs, calves and a number of other species. 

A variety of antibiotics have been tested at various levels. 
Antibiotics have caused a variable response in different classes of 
livestock and results appear to vary with differences in ration and en¬ 
vironment (Cunha et al., f 5l)* 

Poultry was one of the first classes of livestock vdth which 
the growth promoting effect of antibiotics was demonstrated. Numerous 
trials with antibiotic supplements have been conducted vdth poultry 
since 1 9 h 9 , and the following short review is only an indication of 
the general results obtained. Brown (*5>2) in a thesis from the Depart¬ 
ment of Animal Science summarized the literature on results obtained 
when poultry were fed antibiotics. 

The addition of 0.25 percent aureomycin fermentation mash to 
either a corn, soybean oil meal, herring meal basal ration, or one in 
v/hich wheat replaced corn, increased the growth rate of chicks signifi¬ 
cantly (Berg et al., *5>0a). Qn removal of aureomycin supplement from 
the ration, Berg et al. (*50b) found that there was no carry-over effect 
from the antibiotic. These results would tend to indicate that the mode 
of action of the antibiotic in promoting growth is dependent upon the 
material being present in the diet continuously. 

Matterson and Singsen ( ! 5l) compared five antibiotics using 
either an all plant protein basal ration or a ration containing fish 
meal to replace the soybean oil meal of the all plant ration. Penicillin 
and bacitracin maintained increased growth rate for the longest period, 
while streptomycin was least effective in promoting growth. "While 
the greatest percentage increase in growth rate was obtained by supple¬ 
menting the all plant protein ration, the chicks receiving antibiotic

supplement in the fish meal supplemented ration attained the heaviest 
final weights# 

Turkey poults fed a practical diet were stimulated in growth 
rate by the addition of aureomycin, streptomycin, terramycin or peni¬ 
cillin (McGinnis et al. *5l). Of the supplements tested, penicillin 
was the most effective# 

Supplementation of hog rations with antibiotics was also a 
development arising from the use of animal protein factor supplements. 
The addition of vitamin B^ to a ration was shown to increase the rate 
of gain of pigs (Carpenter, •JO; and Edwards et al#, *50)# The fact 
that animal protein factor supplement from fermentation mash residues 
contained a growth factor other than vitamin was demonstrated by 
Carpenter ( f $0)j Edwards et al# (’5>0); and Jukes (*50). The dried 
mycelium of Streptomyces aureofaciens produced a growth response in 
pigs when added to diets containing vitamin B-^ (Jukes, ’5>0). Early 
work with APF supplements prior to the realization that the presence of 
antibiotics was responsible for part of the growth response, has been 
summarized by Beacom (*?1) in a thesis for the M.Sc. degree in the 
Department of Animal Science. 

The first large scale experiment reported with antibiotic 
supplements for swine was conducted by Cunha, (’50). The antibiotic 
present in an aureomycin fermentation mash increased the rate of gain 
by 26 to 135 percent with an average of 100 percent increase in 12 
trials. The feed efficiency was increased by 5 to Ui percent with an 
average of 28 percent in the 12 trials. Pigs receiving the supplement 
did not scour as did those receiving the basal ration. These increases 
in gain and efficiency from aureomycin supplement were obtained on a

corn-peanut meal ration and thus tend to be greater than would be obtained 
on a better quality ration. 

That different antibiotic supplements vary in their effect when 
fed to swine is illustrated by Carpenter (*5>la) who compared five anti¬ 
biotics in a ration for swine. Streptomycin, aureomycin, Chloromycetin, 
terramycin and penicillin all stimulated growth and increased feed 
efficiency, but to varying degrees. All of the antibiotics tested 
except Chloromycetin controlled diarrhea. 

Briggs and Beeson (*5>1) found that 10 mg. of pure aureomycin or 
15 mg. of pure streptomycin per lb. of feed increased the rate of gain 
significantly when fed to healthy weanling pigs. Feed efficiency was 
increased about lit to 16 percent, and gains were, more uniform when the 
ration contained the antibiotic supplement. Carpenter ('50) reported 
that pigs receiving aureomycin supplement had less diarrhea, were 
smoother and generally thriftier than pigs receiving no antibiotic. 

Control of scouring has also been reported in several other instances 
(Burnside, ! £0; Carpenter *5la; *5>lb; Catron, *50; and Cunha, *50). 

The greatest response in rate of gain by pigs receiving antibiotic 
supplement is during the growing period (Bowland et aL., *5>1; Hoefer et 
al., ! ?2). However, in these trials, an increase in growth rate was 
obtained by feeding antibiotic supplements during the finishing period 
up to market weight. Runty pigs generally respond more to antibiotics 
than normal pigs (Bowland et al., *5>1; and Beeson, '52). For example. 

Bowl and et al. (*5>1) found that unthrifty pigs fed an aureomycin supple¬ 
ment gained up to 86 percent faster with 20 percent better feed utiliza¬ 
tion than the control groups. 

Catron et al. (’$0) compared the addition of several levels of

crystalline aureomycin hydrochloride to a ration for growing pigs. Five, 
10, 20 or b0 mg. of aureomycin hydrochloride per lb. of ration all resulted 
in significantly higher rates of gain than occurred in pigs receiving the 
bas.al ration with no antibiotic. 

While 2.5 mg. of streptomycin per lb. of feed stimulated growth 
of pigs, a further increase in growth rate was attained by supplementation 
at the 15 mg. level (Briggs and Beeson ’52). A combination of 12.5 V 
of vitamin B-j^ and 15 mg. of streptomycin per pound of feed improved 
growth rate and feed efficiency more than single additions of either 
factor. Penicillin at 1 or 5 mg. per lb. of feed resulted in a growth 
response, with one level as effective as the other (Luecke et al., *5l)* 

In an earlier study at the University of Alberta, Hironaka (*51) com¬ 
pared several levels of antibiotic supplement containing aureoraycin or 
penicillin. A supplement containing aureomycin was added at levels of 
0.1, 0.25 and 0.5 percent of the ration while penicillin supplement was 
added at 0.1 and 0.2 percent levels. While appreciable increases in 
growth rate were obtained in all cases by antibiotic supplementation of 
the ration, aureomycin supplement at the 0.5 percent level and penicillin 
supplement at the 0.1 percent level appeared to give the greatest growth 
response. 

Growth has not been promoted by antibiotic supplements in all 
cases. Sheffy et al. (*52) found only a slight advantage in streptomycin 
supplementation of a ration for young pigs. Similar findings were re¬ 
ported by Brown (*52) w r hen penicillin or aureomycin supplements were 
added to chick rations. Crystalline aureomycin hydrochloride or anti¬ 
biotic in liquid animal protein factor produced no increase in rate of 
gain or feed efficiency when fed to healthy pigs (Speer et al., *50)*

With a corn-peanut meal ration, penicillin supplement resulted in no 
increase in rate of gain of pigs, while aureornycin supplement increased 
the growth rate more than streptomycin which in turn was more favorable 
than penicillin (Cunha et al., *5l)« Neomycin, at 10 mg. per lb. of 
feed was reported to have a deleterious effect on rate of gain (Luecke 
et al., *51). 

Aureornycin in sows* rations for b9 to 90 days prior to parturition 
had no effect on litter size, or size, livability and growth rate of the 
suckling pigs (Carpenter, *5lb). However, aureornycin in a creep feed 
increased weaning weights from 25 to 36 pounds. Implantation of a single 
1000 unit bacitracin pellet in three to five day old pigs has resulted 
in an 11.3 percent increase in weight of pigs weaned at 56 days (Noland 
et al., * 52 ). 

Bowland et al., (*5l) have reported that the addition of anti¬ 
biotics to a plant protein ration increased the average daily gain more 
than when added to a mixed plant and animal protein ration; thus the 
supplement tended to equalize the two rations, regardless of protein 
source. 

The amount of protein required in a ration may be decreased by 
antibiotic supplementation. Protein requirement in a corn-peanut meal 
ration was decreased by 10 percent (Cunha, *50). Differences in rate 
of gain were negligible between pigs fed rations containing 18 and 15 
percent protein to 100 lb., and 15 and 12 percent protein from 100 lb. 
to market weight when these rations contained 5 mg* of terramycin per 
lb. of feed (Hoefer et al., *52). Several levels of protein in the 
ration for pigs were compared by Catron et al . (*52)• Levels of 20, IS, 

16 and II 4 percent protein were fed from weaning to 75 pounds. Each

level was reduced by 3 percent at an average weight of 75 lb* to 17, 15* 

13 and 11 percent protein until the pigs reached 150 lb* in weight, when 
the protein level was reduced an additional 3 percent to lh, 12, 10 and 
8 percent respectively. Each level was fed to groups of pigs with and 
without antibiotic; the antibiotic being aureomycin hydrochloride added 
at the rate of 10 mg. per lb. of ration. Without antibiotic supplement, 
a combination of 16 , 13 and 10 percent protein for the three periods 
appeared to supply the pigs’ needs; while with an antibiotic supplement, 
a combination of lli, 11 and 8 percent protein gave results equal to those 
obtained with higher levels of protein. Thus, the antibiotic appeared to 
exert a protein sparing effect. On the basis of 2h representative car¬ 
casses, the various levels of protein or the presence or absence of anti¬ 
biotic in the diet resulted in no significant differences in respect to 
backfat depth, length, depth of body or percentage lean (lean cross section 
measured at the last rib). 

In a review article Almquist (’52) summarized work done by several 
workers studying the effect of antibiotic supplement on protein require¬ 
ments in rations for chicks and turkeys. Prom the reports which were 
reviewed, it was concluded that antibiotics do not, in general, decrease 
protein or amino acid requirements* In fact, the effect appeared to be in 
the opposite direction. Higher protein and amino acid levels may be re¬ 
quired in association with the improved growth which is favored by the 
presence of antibiotics in the feed. 

Pigs receiving bacitracin have been reported to have a lowered 
dressing percentage (Terril et al., *52), while pigs receiving penicillin 
or aureomycin had a higher dressing percentage (Bowland et al*, ’51) 
compared to controls receiving no antibiotic. Advanced Registry scores

were lower on carcasses from pigs which received aureomycin or penicillin, 
although they were not significantly lower (Bowland et al., *51). The 
principal effect of antibiotic supplementation of the ration appeared to 
be a reduction in length (Bowland et al., *51) and increased backfat 
(Beeson, and Bowland et al., *51)• Terril et al. ( f £2) found no 

significant difference in thickness of backfat when bacitracin was fed 
to 100 lb. in weight only, but an average increase of 0.3 cm. in backfat 
when the supplement was fed until the pigs were marketed. 

Vitamin storage in the livers of animals receiving antibiotics has 
been studied to a limited extent. The concentration of several water sol¬ 
uble vitamins in the livers of chicks receiving antibiotics were quite 
variable (Monson et al., *52). In this experiment, there was no correla¬ 
tion between growth rate and storage of water soluble vitamins. Brown (*5>2) 
found the antibiotics added to a chick ration did not affect riboflavin 
storage in the liver. Burgess et al. (*5>l) observed in chicks that vitamin 
A per gm. of fresh liver and total serum carotenoids were significantly 
elevated by administration of dietary penicillin. These increases were 
independent of feed consumption and of body weight response to the anti¬ 
biotic. The same group of workers have made similar observations with 
rats, but the data are unpublished. 

Other species than the pig, chicken and turkey have responded in 
varying degrees to antibiotic supplementation of the ration. The growth 
of rats has been stimulated by feeding an antibiotic (Cravioto-LIunoz et 
al., *51; Sauberlich, »£2; and Stern and McGinnis, f £0). Weanling rats 
fed a purified diet with aureomycin supplement grew faster than without 
supplement, and as rapidly as or faster than with just vitamin B-^ 
(Cravioto-Munoz et al., '£1). Stern and McGinnis ( f £0) using a semi-

purified diet, found that terramycin, streptomycin or aureomycin stimu¬ 
lated the growth of rats beyond that obtained by vitamin B-^ supplement 
alone. Rats fed on a diet deficient in certain of the B-vitamins grew 
slowly, but with the addition of penicillin or aureomycin, a marked 
growth stimulation was obtained. 

Outside of controlling scouring of calves, antibiotic supplemen¬ 
tation of the ration of ruminants has not produced advantageous results. 

In fact a definite disadvantage was found when aureomycin hydro c 111 or id e 
was fed to steers (Bell et al., *5l)« Digestibility of crude fiber was 
reduced and digestive disturbances were produced when 0*2 or 0.6 gnu of 
aureomycin hydrochloride were fed daily. At the University of Alberta, 
steers fed aureomycin supplement at a level of 0.25 percent of the grain 
ration (MeElroy and Berg, *5l) gained slightly slower than control animals 
receiving no antibiotic. Antibiotic supplemented steers ate as much 
grain as the control group, but their appetite for hay was reduced, and 
they ate 2.5 lb. less per day. Several steers from the antibiotic sup¬ 
plemented lot suffered from moderate to severe diarrhea and went off feed 
for short periods. 

The mode of action of antibiotics is not known, but several 
theories have been advanced as to how they act. These include; (a) 
inhibition of toxin producing organisms, (b) reduction in intestinal 
bacteria and thereby lowered competition between host and microflora for 
nutrients, (c) selective inhibition permitting increased growth of micro¬ 
organisms that synthesize unidentified essential nutrients, (d) action 
of the antibiotic molecule or a fragment of the molecule as a metabolite 
within the body, (e) reduction in subclinical disease, (f) increased 
water intake and resulting nutrient absorption, (g) or combinations of

two or more of the foregoing (ELam et al., *5lb; Sauberlich, *$2; 

Sieburth et al., *5}.; and Weber et al., *52)* 

Moore et al. (*1;6) noted in their attempt to sterilize the intes¬ 
tinal tract of chicks, that there was a marked reduction in the coliform 
bacteria of the cecal contents* However antibiotics added to the ration 
do not give consistent changes in bacterial numbers for most types of 
bacteria, and the changes in numbers have no correlation vdth increased 
growth (Sieburth et al*, *5>l). Clostridium perfringens , an anaerobic 
bacterium, was inhibited by penicillin or terramycin in turkey poults 
and by terramycin in pigs; therefore a possible means of growth promotion 
may have been prevention of enterotoxemia* Streptothricin and streptomycin 
produced a very rapid and pronounced reduction in the numbers of both the 
coliform and non-lactose fermenting organisms found in the feces of mice 
(Smith and Robinson, 'Li5)« Reduced numbers of the organisms were main¬ 
tained by streptomycin as long as therapy was continued, and no symptoms 
of vitamin deficiency were observed* Feeding penicillin to the chick in¬ 
creased the numbers of penicillin resistant organisms in the intestinal 
tract (Elam et al*, *?la, ’^lb). An increase in the yeast count was also 
reported. Autoclaved penicillin fed to chicks, or bacitracin administered 
orally or parenterally, had little effect on the fecal microflora, but 
rates of gain were still increased* Edwards et al*, ('^l) treated an 
aureomycin mash with sodium hydroxide to destroy the vitamin and 9 7 
percent of the inhibitory effect of the antibiotic against various organ¬ 
isms* Addition of the treated mash to a corn-peanut meal pig ration 
resulted in a marked growth response. This would tend to indicate that 
the mode of action of antibiotics is by some mechanism other than a change in 
the intestinal microflora.

Injections of antibiotics generally do not produce a growth res¬ 
ponse, Chicks injected with aureomycin, streptomycin or penicillin 
showed no significant increase in rate of growth over the control groups 
(McGinnis et al., *50; and Ihitehill et al ., *50). However, Elam et al . 

(*?lb) reported that penicillin or autoclaved penicillin injected into a 
chick stimulated growth. Since parenterally administered antibiotic was 
found to stimulate growth in some instances, it might be surmised that the 
antibiotic molecule, or a fragment of it, acts as a metabolite within the 
body. 

Some evidence that antibiotics do not exert an effect on growth 
through a change in the microflora has been discussed. Combinations of 
aureomycin, streptomycin, terramycin and penicillin produced no greater 
response than penicillin alone (McGinnis et al., *51), These are all 
antibacterial in action, but act on a different range of organisms. Weber 
et al. (*52) found, that rimodicin, which is essentially antifungal in 
a.ction, promoted growth. When mixed with terramycin, growth was not 
stim.ula.ted any more than when each was fed singly. These results further 
strengthen the case that antibiotics do not exert their effect through a 
change in microflora. 

The most recent explanation of the increased growth rate was pro¬ 
posed by Weber et al . (*?2). They found that the water consumption of 
chicks was about double in the antibiotic supplemented as compared to the 
control group. They also reviewed similar observations made by Card (*?1) 
when pigs were fed antibiotic supplements. The increased rate of water 
consumption may reflect some physiological changes in the animal body. 

It is postulated that antibiotics increase intestinal protein inhibition, 
and that the proteins of the intestinal wall take up increasing amounts

of water from the intestinal tract. This wo'old result in increased 
nutrient absorption. 

On the basis of present knowledge, a reasonable explanation of 
the way antibiotics stimulate growth may incorporate three of the theories 
proposed. The antibiotic molecule or a fragment of it acting as a meta¬ 
bolite, may cause the necessary physiological changes for increased water 
and other nutrient absorption. This, coupled with a possible lower 
general disease level, could stimulate growth. 

A cordparison of results indicates that the effects of antibiotic 
supplements will vary with several factors including environment and the 
ration employed. This would indicate the necessity for measuring the 
effect under conditions such as preva.il in Alberta.

EXPERIMENTAL 


A series of experiments was designed to study antibiotic supple¬ 
mentation of swine rations typical of those fed in western Canada* 

The following aspects of the use of antibiotic supplements were 
investigated: 

I The effect of deleting antibiotics from the ration at various 
stages of the pigs 1 growth* 

II The effect of antibiotic supplements with various levels of 
protein during the growing period* 

III The rate of gain and feed efficiency of swine receiving 

various antibiotic supplements singly and in combination as 
well as in series* 

Analytical studies related to blood lipids and vitamin A storage 
were carried out in conjunction with some of the above trials. 

General ^Experimental Procedures 

All of the pigs used in these experiments were purebred Yorkshire 
weanling pigs. Allotment was as uniform as possible on the basis of 
weight, ancestry and sex* The pigs were treated with sodium fluoride to 
remove round worms, Ascaris lumbricoides var* suis, prior to going on 
experiment. 

The rations used were self-fed and water was available at all 
times. The antibiotic supplements used were as follows: 

Penicillin supplement - Merck f s vitamin and antibiotic feed 
supplement (APF-8), oontaining 12.5 mg. vitamin and 








2 gm. procaine penicillin per pound. 

Aureomycin supplement - Lederle’s vitamin and antibiotic feed 
supplement (Aurofac) containing 1.8 mg. vitamin ®I2 and 
1.8 gm, of aureomycin hydrochloride per pound. 

Bacitracin supplement - Commercial Solvents Corporations Baci- 
ferm-5^ containing the equivalent of not less than 5 gnu 
of bacitracin per pound. 

Penbac supplement - Commercial Solvents Corporation’s Penbac 

antibiotic feed supplement containing the equivalent of 
not less than 5 gm* of bacitracin and 1 gm. of 1-Ephen- 
amine penicillin G, equivalent to 0.635 gm. of crystalline 
penicillin G per pound. 

Feeding oil was fed during the growing period to supply each pig with 
approximately 7000 I.U. of vitamin A and 1200 I.U. of vitamin D per day. 

Each pig was weighed individually at one or two week intervals. 
Records of feed consumption were kept to coincide with each time' the pigs 
were weighed, and feed efficiency for each period calculated. 

EXPERIMENT I - The effect of deleting antibiotics from the ration at 
various stages of the pigs* growth. 

Earlier work at the University of Alberta has indicated that the 
greatest growth response from antibiotic supplements is obtained during 
the growing period, but rate of gain is enhanced during the finishing 
period. Pigs scored by Canadian Advanced Registry standards have been 
found to have lower carcass scores when an antibiotic was fed through the 
entire finishing period.

Experimental Procedure 

Forty-two pigs averaging 1+0 lb. in weight were divided evenly 
into seven lots of six pigs each. Two basal rations as shown in table 
1 were fed. Basal ration 1 was fed until the average weight per pig in 
a lot reached approximately 125 pounds. From 125 lb. until a market 
weight of approximately 200 lb., the pigs received basal ration 2. 

The individual lots were fed the rations and supplements as 
given in table 2. In addition all pigs received vitamin A and D supple¬ 
ment until an average weight of 125 lh. was reached.

The pigs were marketed at as near to 200 pounds as possible. 

The carcasses were graded by Canadian Government grades > and cut and 
scored by Advanced Registry standards. 

Livers were collected from a limited number of pigs. Samples of 
the liver tissue were analyzed to determine vitamin A and carotene storage. 
These few liver samples were used to evaluate a satisfactory method for 
determining liver storage of vitamin A so that the method could be used 
routinely in later trials.

Under the conditions of the trial, up to 75 lb. in weight only 
lot 1; receiving aureomycin supplement gained at a significantly faster 
rate than the control group (p = .05). During this period, pigs fed 
aureomycin supplement gained at a faster rate than pigs fed penicillin 
supplement. At an average weight of 125 lb., the pigs which had been 
fed aureomycin to 75 lb. had an average gain similar to the control group. 
Lot 7 receiving penicillin supplement gained at a rate equal to the pigs 
which had received aureomycin supplement. The differences in rate of 
gain in the overall period approached significance at the 5 percent 
level. Pigs fed aureomycin supplement to 125 or 200 lb. appeared to gain 
at a faster rate than pigs fed penicillin to 125 lb. or 200 lb. 

Analyses of variance of rates of gain were calculated combining 
lots receiving each antibiotic to 75 lb. and to 125 lb.; i.e., lots were 
combined for statistical analyses as follows: 

To 75 pounds; lots 2, 3 and 1* and lots 5* 6 and 7* 

To 125 pounds; lots 3 and U and lots 6 and 7*

In the period to an average weight of 7? lb., pigs receiving 
aureonycin supplement gained at a highly significantly (p = *01) faster 
rate than those receiving no antibiotic or penicillin supplement. Hoyt- 
ever, in the period up to 125 lb., no significant- differences existed. 
Although the supplements used contained vitamin B^, earlier work at the 
University of Alberta (Beacom, *5l) shoYred that vitamin had little 
effect on rate of gain or carcass quality, so that any effects of the 
supplements are attributed to the antibiotic that they contained. 

The results shorn on table 3 indicate that the greatest grovrth 
stimulation occurred in the groY/ing period. This is in agreement with 
the findings of Bowland et al. (*5lJ and Hoefer et al. (’52). Aureo- 
raycin supplement was more effective than penicillin in promoting rate 
of weight increase. However the levels of the antibiotic supplements 
fed may have influenced the results. Bates of supplementation of the 
ration were 0.5 percent aureonycin and 0.05 percent penicillin supple¬ 
ment, which supplied 9 mg. of aureomycin hydrochloride and 1 mg. of 
procaine penicillin per lb. of feed respectively. An earlier study at 
the University of Alberta (Hironaka, *51) indicated that aureomycin

supplement fed at the rate of 0.5 percent gave better response than lower 
levels and that 0.1 percent penicillin gave as great growth stimulation 
as 0.2 percent. 

Removal of the antibiotic from the diet when an average weight of 
75 lb. was attained did not appear to cause any marked depression in rate 
of gain. However, when the antibiotics were fed to 125 lb. in weight, 
and then removed from the ration, there was a period up to a week when 
rate of gain was sharply reduced. Following this period, the pigs con¬ 
tinued to gain weight at a normal rate. Bird ( *50) found that chicks 
fed streptomycin at the rate of 20 mg. per kg. of feed for 5 weeks, after 
which the antibiotic was removed from the ration, showed no change in rate 
of gain. However, when 1;0 mg. streptomycin per kg. of feed was fed for 5 
weeks and then removed from the diet, there was a sharp decrease in rate 
of gain. Deletion of bacitracin in a swine ration when the pigs reached 
a weight of 100 lb., resulted in a cessation of accelerated rate of gain 
(Terril et al., *52). Similar findings were reported by 'Whitlock (‘52) 
using aureomycin, terramycin and penicillin in swine rations. 

Feed efficiency of lots receiving aureomycin supplement to 75 lb. 
was improved an average of 12.8 percent, while lots receiving penicillin 
supplement to 75 lb. averaged 6.i| percent improvement. The feed efficiency 
of pigs fed antibiotics to 125 lb. was improved by 6.2 and 7.0 percent 
respectively. The pigs fed antibiotics to 75 lbs. had a feed efficiency 
almost identical to the control lot when an average of 125 lb. was reached. 
The feed consumed per 100 lb. of gain in the overall period was almost 
identical from one lot to another. This is in agreement with the findings 
of Berg et al. (*50), Blight et al. (*52) and Catron et al. (*50)j but is 
not in agreement with reports of several workers who found that feed

efficiency was improved by feeding antibiotics to swine (Bowland et al.,

Average carcass measurements and Advanced Registry scores are 
presented in table 6. Ik? statistical differences vrere found in length of

trend toward a reduction in Government grade, belly grade, length of side, 
area of loin and total A.R. score was evident when the antibiotics vrere 
fed to market weight. The reduction in total score from 73 to 6l resulted 
from lower score in length, belly and loin. Feeding of the antibiotic 
supplements to 7? or 12? lb. did not affect carcass grades or A.R. meas¬ 
urements •

Dressing prcentages a.veraged very close to 75 percent in all lots, 
and the addition of an antibiotic supplement had no appreciable effect on 
this percentage. Earlier work in the Department of Animal Science has 
indicated a trend toward an increased dressing percent when antibiotics 
are fed in the finishing period (Bowland et al., *51), while other workers 
have reported a decreased dressing percent from antibiotic supplementation 
of the ration for swine (Terril et al., ’52)* 

Carcasses of pigs which received an antibiotic shrank an average 
of 5*1 lb. on cooling for approximately J 4.8 hours, while the carcasses of 
pigs which did not receive any antibiotic shrank an average of 3*8 pounds. 
This significant difference (p = .05) in shrinkage indicates that the 
carcasses from antibiotic fed pigs probably contained more water. This 
may be explained on the basis of the observations made by Card (’5l) and 
Weber et al. (*52) that pigs and chicks fed antibiotics drank more water 
than animals receiving no antibiotic supplement. 

The results of the analyses of liver tissue for vitamin A and car¬ 
otene did not indicate any trend toward increased vitamin A storage when 
antibiotic supplements were fed. The limited data obtained in this exper¬ 
iment are summarized in table 7* The analyses in this and subsequent 
trials, were made by the method described by Berl and Peterson (*I|3) 
using livers which had been stored in a frozen state.

Summary - Experiment I 

1. Antibiotic supplementation of a ration for pigs tended to cause 
increased rate of gain, although generally not to a statistically 
significant extent. 

2. Antibiotic supplements produced their greatest response in rate of 
gain in a period from weaning to an average weight of 7? pounds. 

3* Aureonycin supplement resulted in significant differences in rate 
of gain over penicillin supplement. 

U. When an antibiotic was included in the ration until the pigs were 
marketed, a lowering in carcass quality as compared to pigs receiv¬ 
ing no antibiotic was indicated, although differences were not 
significant. The supplementation of a ration with antibiotics, 
until the pigs reached average weights of 75 or 125 lb., did not 
appear to affect carcass quality. 

Greater shrinkage in weight during cooling occurred in the carcasses 
from the pigs which had been fed an antibiotic supplement.

6. No difference in liver storage of vitamin A and carotene appeared to 
result from feeding antibiotic supplements. 

EXPERIMENT II - The effect of antibiotic supplements with various levels 
of protein during the growing period. 

Trial A 

A ,f protein-sparing n effect has been reported when antibiotic 
supplements are added to rations for swine , but such studies have nob 
been conducted using Canadian type rations. The effect on carcass qual¬ 
ity of the addition of antibiotic supplements to rations varying in 
protein level has not been studied. 

Experimental Procedure 

Thirty-six pigs averaging 33*5 lb. were divided into six lots of 
six pigs each. The rations for all lots contained the same ratio of grain 
(2 barley: 1 oats) and the amount of protein supplement was varied to 
obtain the percentage protein desired for each lot. The crude protein 
content of the grains as well as of the ingredients of the protein supple¬ 
ment were determined by calculation following nitrogen determination by 
the Kjeldahl method. The barley used in this trial had 11.i; percent and 
the oats 12.3 percent crude protein. The constituents of the protein 
supplement vd.th the amount of each and percent crude protein are pres¬ 
ented in table 8.

As the pigs of each lot reached an average weight of 110 lb., 
they were changed to a ration containing 13 percent protein and no 
antibiotic, the same as lot $ received during the growing period. 

Results and Discussion 

A summary of the rates of gain and feed efficiencies is presented 
in table 10. Analyses of variance, as presented in table 11 were carried 
out on rates of gain. Six weeks after initiation of the trial, a pig 
in lot 2, receiving 17 percent protein with antibiotic, became ill and 
was removed from the experiment and a replacement was put in the lot. 
Since the pig which was substituted in lot 2 received the antibiotic for 
only 3 weeks, and the gain by this pig appeared out of line with others 
in the lot, it was not included in the summary of the data.

ferences in rate of gain were produced by feeding a penicillin supplement 


to swine* Differences in rate of gain due to different protein levels 
were not significant* However, a trend toward slower rate of gain ap¬ 
peared as the level of protein was decreased, particularly in lots not 
receiving an antibiotic supplement. Hoefer et al. ('52) reported similar 
findings when terramycin was supplemented to swine rations containing 15 
and 18 percent protein. The interaction between the different levels of 
protein and antibiotic had no affect on rate of weight increase. 

Differences in rate of gain due to antibiotic supplement in the 
3 periods of growth (initial to 75 lb., 75 to 110 lb., with antibiotic* and 
110 to 200 lb. without antibiotic) were all significant (p = .05). The 
rate of gain continued to be enhanced, particularly in lot 2 receiving 17 
percent protein and antibiotic, following removal of the antibiotic from 
the ration. This is not in agreement with the findings in earlier work 
reported in Experiment I or Terril et al. (*52), where it was found that 
when an antibiotic was removed from the ration, there w r as a cessation in

short period following removal, of the antibiotic from the ration Y/as 
evident , as was the case in the previous experiment (Experiment I) 
when the antibiotics v/ere removed at 125 lb. in weight. 

A small increase in feed efficiency was observed Yihen antibiotic 
supplements were added to the ration. The feed efficiency appeared to be 
reduced as the level of protein was lowered in the period up to 110 lb. 
in weight.

Total Advanced Registry score of carcasses from pigs fed antibiotic 
compared to pigs not fed antibiotic was reduced by 12.5 percent. Carcasses 
of pigs fed antibiotic were significantly (p = . 05 ) thicker in loin fat and 
backfat and highly significantly (p - *01) lower in area of loin. This is 
not in agreement with Experiment I reported earlier, or with the findings 
of Catron al. ( ! 52), where it was found that when the antibiotic was 
removed prior to 125 lb. in weight, there was no effect on carcass fat 
measurements. This may be at least partially explained by the carry-over 
effect of the antibiotic which was shown by the accelerated rate of gain 
which was observed in lot 2. The length of carcasses of pigs fed 17 and 
15 percent protein with antibiotic supplement was decreased in comparison 
to the carcasses from pigs which were not fed an antibiotic. However, 


carcasses from pigs fed 13 percent protein with antibiotic were longer

than those from pigs fed no antibiotic. This difference in response to 
protein level with and without, antibiotic approached significance at the 
five percent level. Protein level alone had no significant effect on 
carcass quality. The trend toward lower belly scores from lower levels 
of protein and antibiotic supplementation of the ration was not statisti¬ 
cally significant. McMeekan (’1;0) found that pigs on a high plane of 
nutrition were fatter and shorter than pigs on a low plane of nutrition, 
which might be a partial explanation of the results obtained in this 
experiment. 

An average of 0.86 lb. more shrinkage in carcasses from pigs 
fed antibiotic compared to those receiving no antibiotic was found to be 
significant (p = .05). This is in agreement with findings reported earli¬ 
er. A possible explanation of this is that there was an increased water 
consumption by pigs fed antibiotic supplement which resulted in more 
water in the tissue. 

Samples of blood were drawn from all of the pigs after they had 
been on trial for 9 weeks. The blood was obtained from the anterior vena 
cava by the method described by Carle and Dewliirst (*1|2) using potassium 
oxalate as an anticoagulant. The lipid level of the plasma was determined 
using the method described by Allen ( ! 38). The blood was drawn and frozen 
before the plasma was separated. Average plasma lipid levels are presented 
in table ll;.

There appeared to be no definite trend in levels of plasma lipid 
between pigs fed antibiotic supplement compared to pigs receiving no 
antibiotic. Statistically significant correlations were found between 
plasma lipid levels and some carcass measurements and scores. 

Correlations were as follows: 

Area of loin -O. 698 ** 

Shoulder fat 0.356* 

Thickness of loin 0.371* 

Backfat score - 0 . 1437 **" 

The correlation between plasma lipid level and thickness of 
backfat was 0.206, which was not found to be significant. In general, 
the correlations would indicate that plasma lipid levels were a reason¬ 
able measure of the fatness of the carcass. 

The livers were collected when the pigs were slaughtered.

There did not appear to be any effect on vitamin A and carotene 
storage in the liver from the addition of an antibiotic supplement or 
from different levels of protein in the rations fed* This is not in 
agreement with Burgess et al * (*5l) who found that liver storage of 
vitamin A was increased when chicks were fed an antibiotic. The anti¬ 
biotic was removed from the pigs 1 rations at 110 lb. in weight so that 
any effect on vitamin A storage in the liver may have been lost by the 
time the pigs reached market weight* 


Trial I 

In trial A, the rate of gain by pigs fed 17, If? or 13 percent 
protein with an antibiotic supplement was significantly greater than 
gains with the same rations without antibiotic supplement, with a trend 
toward slower gains being observed as the protein level was decreased# 
This trial indicated that there were significant differences in carcass 
quality when an antibiotic supplement was fed, even though it was removed 
at an average weight of 110 pounds. Correlations between plasma lipid 
levels and certain carcass measurements were found to be significant.

There was no apparent difference in liver storage of vitamin A or caro¬ 
tene from feeding the rations varying in protein level with or without 
antibiotic, A duplicate trial was conducted to determine the repeat¬ 
ability of the first. Both trials were iniated in the spring of the year. 


Experimental Procedure 


Thirty pigs averaging I 4 .OO lb*, were divided into six groups of 
five pigs each. The rations were formulated as in trial A, containing 
the same ratio of grain (2 barley: 1 oats), and type of protein supple¬ 
ment, On the basis of Kjeldahl nitrogen determination, the barley used 
in this trial contained 12,6 percent and the oats 11*9 percent crude 
protein* The composition and crude protein content of the protein supple¬ 
ment are presented in table 16, The lots and rations up to 110 lb, in 
weight were as presented in table 17* The antibiotic supplement contained 
penicillin as in trial A* The mineral mixture was made up of equal parts 
limestone and iodized salt, All other experimental procedures were as 
described in trial A*

Results and Discussion 

The average rates of gain and feed efficiencies are presented in 
table 18. Analyses of variance for rates of gain are presented in table 
19. 

One pig in lot If. receiving 15 percent protein with antibiotic 
grew at an abnormally slow rate. The pig was withdrawn from the experi¬ 
ment Vfhen the last of the other pigs of the same lot was marketed. How¬ 
ever , this pig was included in calculations for average gains, feed 
efficiencies and analyses of variance. No information as to carcass 
quality or vitamin A liver storage was available for this pig.

No statistically significant differences in rate of gain were 
found up to 110 lb. in weight even if the one pig which appeared to 
grow at an abnormally slow rate was excluded from the analysis. These 
results are not in agreement with the results of trial A, or with other 
work reported from the University of Alberta (Beacon, ! 5lj Bowland et al. 
* 51 ; and Hironaka, ! £l) where the rate of gain was increased by anti¬ 
biotic supplements. Feed efficiency was not affected by antibiotic 
supplementation of the ration, but a trend toward lower feed efficiency 
was found at lower levels of protein in the ration. No protein “sparing 
effect" was observed when antibiotic supplements were added to the ration 
Neither feed efficiency, nor rate of gain varied significantly in pigs 
fed rations of different protein level. This same observation held true 
for the over-all growth and finishing period to market weight.

and work reported by Terril et al. (’52) who found, no significant differ¬ 
ence in backfat thickness when bacitracin was fed to 100 pounds. However, 
it does not agree with the results obtained in trial A. Carcasses from 
pigs fed 13 percent protein were significantly shorter than carcasses 
from pigs fed 15 or 17 percent protein. The difference in response to 
protein levels with and without antibiotic was significant (p = . 03 ). 

The difference in carcass measurements between trial A and trial 
B may be a reflection of the difference in rate of gain between the two 
trials. Antibiotic supplementation of the ration did not affect the rate 
of gain as markedly in trial B as in trial A. The quality of the carcasses 
is undoubtedly affected by rate of gain as shown by McMeekan (’ lj.0). Since 
the rate of weight increase was not affected markedly by antibiotic supple¬ 
mentation of the ration in trial B, the difference in carcass measurements 
in turn may not have been markedly affected by the rate of gain. If this 
is true, then the effect of antibiotics on carcass quality is not a direct 
effect, but rather an indirect effect through the rate of gain. 

A trend toward greater shrinkage from hot to cold carcass weight 
of pigs fed antibiotic supplement compared to pigs not fed an antibiotic 
was found, although differences were not significant. In previous experi¬ 
ments, a similar but larger effect of antibiotic supplements on carcass 
shrinkage was noted. 

Samples of blood were taken from all pigs at the start of the 
experiment and after £ and 10 weeks. Blood plasma lipid levels were 
determined using the method described by Allen (*38). Average lipid 
levels for each lot for the three dates samples were taken are presented 
in table 22. Analysis of variance of plasma lipid levels is presented

when samples of blood were taken. The interaction of any two of protein, 
antibiotic or date had no affect on plasma lipid levels. A differential 
response of the three factors produced the significant interaction which 
was found, but no interpretation can be made of the data. 

Correlations between plasma lipid level and backfat score, loin

Summary - Experiment II 

1. Two studies were conducted on penicillin supplementation of hog 
rations containing 17, 1? and 13 percent protein with and without 
antibiotic supplement until the pigs reached an average weight of 
110 lb. A ration containing 13 percent protein and no antibiotic

■was fed after the pigs reached this weight until they were marketed 


The pigs responded differently to the rations in the two trials, 
with respect to rate of gain and carcass measurements. 

The pigs in the first trial gained weight at a significantly faster 
rate when antibiotic supplement was added to the ration, while there 
was a trend toward faster gains as the protein level of the ration 
increased. Protein level appeared to have the same effect in the 
second trial but antibiotic supplement had little effect on rate of 
gain. 

A trend toward greater feed efficiency was found at the higher levels 
of protein in both triads, but feed efficiency appeared to be improv¬ 
ed by antibiotic supplement in the first trial only. 

Shrinkage from hot to cold carcass weight was greater in carcasses 
from pigs fed an antibiotic supplement in comparison to those receiv¬ 
ing no supplement. 

Positive correlations between plasma lipid levels and Advanced 
Registry measurements of thickness of shoulder fat and loin fat 
were statistically significant (p = .05) in the first trial. Area 
of loin and backfat score were negatively correlated with plasma 
lipid levels in the first trial (p = .01). In the second trial 
there were no significant correlations between plasma lipid levels 
and any of the carcass measurements. 

The level of vitamin A and carotene storage in the liver did not 
appear to be affected by antibiotic supplementation of the ration 
or by the different levels of protein fed.

EXPERIMENT III - The rate of gain and feed efficiency of smne receiving 
various antibiotic supplements singly and in combination 

as well as in series. 


Several studies have been conducted at the University of 
.Alberta with aureomycin and penicillin supplements, both of which have 
usually given favorable growth responses. Penicillin supplements have 
given less consistent increases in rate of gain than aureomycin supple¬ 
ments. There are few data, and none from the University of Alberta, on 
the complementary effect of different antibiotics fed together or in 
series. 

Experimental Procedure 

Forty-four pigs averaging 36.3 lb. in weight were divided into 
four lots of eight pigs each and tyro lots of six pigs each. After £ 
weeks, the pigs in the lots with eight in each were subdivided into 
two groups. The pigs for each group were identified at the time of 
the original allotment. Thus the final allotment was eight lots with 
four pigs in each and two lots with six pigs in each. The trial was 
conducted for an additional 5> weeks, mailing the entire trial of 10 
weeks duration* 

The basal ration was the same for all lots throughout the 
entire experiment, as shown in table 25>. Also shown in the table is 
the crude protein content of each constituent and the amount of protein 
supplied to the ration. Allotment and antibiotic supplements fed are 
given in table 26 .

The groups receiving aureomycin supplement or aureomycin and 
penicillin supplement gained at a significantly (p = * 05 ) faster rate 
than the control group during the first 5 weeks. Penicillin did not 
appear to promote rate of gain and bacitracin supplement appeared to 
retard the rate of weight increase. 

In the period from 5 to 10 weeks, the pigs receiving aureomycin 
supplement, penbac supplement or aureonycin and penicillin jointly gained 
weight at a highly significantly (p = .01) faster rate than the control 
group. In this period, one group receiving penicillin and another re¬ 
ceiving bacitracin gained weight at a significantly (p = * 05 ) faster 
rate than the controls, while two other groups receiving the same supple¬ 
ments did not* 

In the over—all period, only the groups receiving aureomycin dur¬ 
ing the entire trial, either alone or in combination, gained weight at a 
rate which was highly significantly (p = *01) faster than the control 
group. All antibiotics or combinations of antibiotics except bacitracin 
tended to promote some increase in rate of gain* 

These findings are not in agreement with those reported by

three antibiotics, or Bowland et al. ( ! 5>1) and Carpenter ( l 5la) who 
found that aureomycin and penicillin stimulated growth equally well. 
Previous work at the University of Alberta has shown that penicillin 
does not always increase the rate of gain of pigs (Hironaka *5l, Exper¬ 
iment I and Experiment II - Trial B). Similar findings were reported by 
Cunha (*5l) with pigs and Sauberlich ( r 52) working with rats. 

The combinations or series of antibiotics did not appear to 
increase the rate of gain or improve feed efficiency above that of the 
best single antibiotic in the combination or series. A trend towards 
more efficient utilization of feed was found in some instances, but no 
antibiotic appeared to show any advantage over another. 

Summary - Experiment III 

1. Rate of gain was stimulated the most by aureomycin supplement and 
the least by bacitracin, Yri/th penicillin supplement in between. 

3. Combining antibiotics or feeding them in series did not increase 
rate of gain above that obtained from the best single antibiotic 
supplement included in the combination or series. 

3. A trend toward more efficient utilization of feed was indicated 
when antibiotic supplements Yrere added to the ration.

Three experiments were conducted to study the addition of antibiotic 
supplements to swine rations. 

The rate of gain was generally increased when an antibiotic supple¬ 
ment was fed in the ration. The increase was not statistically sig¬ 
nificant in all cases, and there was a wide variability in response. 
A carry-over effect in rate of gain was observed in one trial after 
the antibiotic was deleted from the ration. 

Combinations of antibiotics showed no advantage over single anti¬ 
biotics. This would indicate that the growth promoting effect of 
antibiotics is not due to changes in the microflora of the digestive 
tract. Aureomycin was found to be the most effective in promoting 
accelerated rate of gain with penicillin less effective and baci¬ 
tracin having little effect. 

A trend toward an increase in feed efficiency was found when anti¬ 
biotic supplements were fed, but the increase was not marked. 

Lower levels of protein in the ration during the growing period, 
resulted in a trend toward slower gains. Antibiotic supplements 
appeared to spare protein in one trial but not in a duplicate trial. 

Pigs responded differently to antibiotic supplements "with respect 
to the quality of carcasses which were produced. "When the anti¬ 
biotic was fed to 200 lb., there was a trend toward fatter carcasses 
and lower Advanced Registry scores. In some cases, carcasses from

pigs fed an antibiotic to 110 or 125 lb. in weight were fatter and 
had a smaller area of loin. 

7# There was a greater shrinkage from hot to cold carcass weight in 
carcasses from pigs fed antibiotic than in those from pigs which 
did not receive any antibiotic. This would tend to indicate more 
water in carcasses from pigs fed antibiotic supplements# 

8# Plasma lipid levels were not affected by antibiotic supplementation 
of the ration or by different levels of protein fed. 

9. Significant correlations were found between plasma lipid levels and 
certain Advanced Registiy measurements of the carcasses in one 
trial. Positive correlations vrere found with shoulder fat and 
thickness of loin, and negative correlations were found with area 
of loin and backfat score. In a duplicate trial conducted the 
following year no significant correlations were found# 

10. Vitamin A and carotene storage in the liver was not affected by 
antibiotic supplement or by protein level of the rations#
