A LINGUISTIC STUDY OF ALBERTA PLACE NAMES 

BY 

WILLIAM TOWRIE CUTT, B.A. B.ED. 


A THESIS SUBMITTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF ALBERTA

FOR THE DEGREE OF MASTER OF ARTS

DOCTOR M. H. SCARGILL

A Linguistic Study of Alberta Place Names 


Th.e thesis A linguisti c St udy of Alb erta Pla c e Names seeks 
to classify the names already listed by the Dominion Geographical 

Board according to their sources in language, in order to find out 
the percentages of types of Indian, English, and European origin* 
These names have been subdivided into descriptive, personal, and 
historical names and names of other townships so that it may be 
seen which names are in sufficient numbers to repay the labours 
of others who seek to investigate Alberta place names, and that 
the future investigator may have more to work on than a nurely 
alphabetical classifcation. It is also the purpose of the writer 
to note any light the sources may throw upon the history of the 
province, and to draw attention to things of interest generally 
concerning the names. 

The thesis shows that in every eight Alberta place names, one 
is Indian, one is European, and six are English in origin. 

The main conclusion reached is that the great body of Alberta 
place names will not repay further investigation, and this is part¬ 
icularly true of personal names, When there is no connection be¬ 
tween place and person, a personal name has no significance when it 
is given to a place. If the name Castle ^ountain had to be change^ 
it might just as well have been called Mount Moses as Mount Eisen¬ 
hower. A descriptive name must be particular to be effective. The® 
are many ridiculous descriptive names, such as Golden R idge.

There may he between five hundred and a thousand colorful and 
significant place names in Alberta that would repay further invest¬ 
igation, names that are interesting in themselves or rich in hist¬ 
orical. or geographical association® 

I think that if further work is to be done on place names, the 
historical records of the Province should be made more available* 
The investigator is sure to need some document that no other person 
can foresee th&t he required, since he is possibly the first to 
read that document with place names primarily in mind* 

I think, too, that if our local history were more particularly 
known, places may be given names of colour and significance that 
might add some lustre to our prcvince 0 If our present leaders are 
to have monuments in our place names, it is necessary that they 
should be specifically connected with the place that bears their 
name* Wolfe's Cove would not be significant on the Pacific Coast 
nor would Cook's £nlet in Labrador* We may be losing opportunities 
to record the real history of our province in its place names©

ALBERTA PLACE NAMES 


Alberta place names in this work are those listed 
in Place-Names of Alberta , published for the Geographic 
Board by the Department of the Interior in 1928, which 
book is the authority for the sources of the names 
given herein. 

The classification of names in the source book is 
alphabetical purely. The purpose of this work is to 
classify names according to their various sources, to 
find the percentages of types so that it may be seen 
which are sufficiently numerous to repay investigation, 
to note any light that these sources throw upon the 
history of the Province, and to draw attention to any 
other thing of interest concerning the names.

As this is a thesis in language, the classification 
is, as far as possible, linguistic; hence a name like 
New Brigden, which is an Ontario place name, is counted 
in the percentages as English. Similarly, the name 
Usonia, imported from California, and coined from the 
initial letters of United States of North America , is 
listed under the names of townships in the United States, 
but as it cannot be called an Indian name or a French 
name, or a Latin name, it is counted in the percentages 
as English. 

The are 203 names for which no source is given. 

There are 17 names that look Indian but are not given 
as Indian. These have been counted in the Indian 
percentages. Sometimes a name from the same source 
is used more than once. A creek, a lake, a river, may 
all have the same name. Such names have been counted 
as one if the sources are identical. One-seventh of 
the other 186 may be European; the remainder are 
definitely English. As 186 is just about 7 c /° of the 
total names, of the names not given but listed are 
considered of English origin, and 1 % as European. 

The results of this survey show that %% of the 
place names of Alberta listed in the source book have

English sources, 12% have European, and 12% have Indian. 
The total names listed are 2,672. The percentages are 
expressed in the nearest whole number. 

The source book, Place Names of Alberta , says in 
the introduction: "The compilation is not a gazetteer 
of all the place-names in Alberta, but a selected list 
of names embodying the principal ones." In 1928 there 
were many more names in Alberta than those listed; in 
19j>0, there are thousands more. A short study of a 
recent map or of a recent waghorn 1 s Guide indicates 
that Alberta place names are still prevailingly English. 
While several European names have been added, very many 
English names have been added. About the only forecast 
the writer would make about a survey of 1950 place names 
is that English percentages have been maintained, Indian 
percentages have decreased, and European percentages 
have increased, with names of French origin no longer 
being overwhelmingly in the majority. New names have 
been added chiefly because new post-offices have been 
established and new districts erected. The highways 
that now serve our Province have followed in the main 
the paths of the railway, and have not caused new centres 
to spring up. The names of physical features seldom

change, and. the cities, towns, and. villages of 1928* are essent¬

Explorers were generally interested in naming land¬ 
marks so that they would recognize them next time they 
saw them. Follow the upper route of the Palliser expedition 
on the 1859 map, and one after another these names will

The only indication of human habitation in the list is Lake 


St. Ann T s. The name suggests a mission, and it was a 
Roman Catholic Mission in l8j?9 with a population of 900. 


Many creeks are named, a water supply being important to 


overlanders.

These names indicate river travel. The signs of human 
habitation are the names of the forts and the hunting 
grounds of Indian tribes. The fur traders themselves 
did not seem interested in naming anything but the fort; 
their business was inside - after they had made the trip 
from one fort to another. 

If a recent map is studied, and attention is focussed 
on an area that is not well settled, a sample of surveyor 
naming may be had.

Long Lake Equisetum Lake Good Fish Lake 

Peerless Lake Graham Lake Quitting Lake 

The history of Alberta can be read from the old place 
names. A name like Demi-charge Rapids tells us that since 
the canoe men had to portage over rough ground, they 
carried half the usual load. It also reminds us that the 
canoe men were Freneh-Canadian. This is a colorful name, 
rich in historical associations. Compare such a name with 
those in a small area of settled Alberta: 

Stettler 

Irskine Sabine Halkirk Big Valley 

Warden Gadsby Fen Red Willow

Individual settlers seem to have named places with their 
own name, or the name of some one in the family, or with 
the name of the old home town; settlers in council seem 
to have agreed only to call the place by the name of some¬ 
one illustrious to them, such as the leader of a political 
party, or by some u fine ,f descriptive name such as Golden 
Meadow. 

One general conclusion that the writer has reached 
is that, with the exception of a few hundred names, Alberta 
place names are dull, drab, and uninspired. If half a 
thousand interesting names disappeared, the others are about 
as colorful as the names of our country homes - Section 22, 
Township 87 > Range 2j?, W j?- or of our city homes - 108j?0 
7J? Avenue. From the title alone, who would prefer Township 16 
to Township 64 or 82 Street to 8j> Avenue? Numbers are 
convenient and often efficient in naming, as our city 
planners, our surveyors, our prison authorities, and our 
service organizations know. Numbers are neither colorful 
nor allusive. In the interest of efficiency, we possibly 
should name Calgary and Edmonton, City 1 and Gity 2, seeing 
that Number Two Highway joins them. Unfortunately, High¬ 
way Number 1 \TOuld have to run through City 1, and there

might be no agreement as to ?/hich gets the number 2. 

Confusion might arise, too, with towns; we might forget 
that Town 23 has a rink and a pool hall while Town 24 has 
no rink. The use of numbers has not given us much practice 
in getting significant names for places. 

Another factor contributing to drab place names such 
as Fairview and Sunnyslope is the vast stretches of identical 
landscape. The fairview at Point X is no fairer than the 
fair vie?/ at Point Y; one slope is no sunnier than the next 
- both being fair enough and sunny enough. The prairie 
rolls for mile after mile, the crest of the roll rising 
73 feet above the hollo?/, and the crest of the next rising 
80 feet. The parkland and the forest roll for mile after 
mile in similar fashion. The bushland varies from poplar 
plateau, spruce swamp, and muskeg, to muskeg, spruce swamp 
and poplar plateau. Any one section of it is beautiful, 
and colorful, especially when viewed in certain lights. 

But names had to be given in a hurry, before people had 
time to see variety in the monotony, and before the poet ? s 
eye had seen and his pen had described the beauty of the 
prairie at twilight - as in Simons Valley in early summer-* 
or of the morning sun rising from the mists of the Harmon

above the ridge of Judah. One out of three places got 
a personal name, and very often got the name of the post¬ 
master. The beginning of the post-office often marked the 
end of pioneering in the district, the postmaster not 
necessarily being a pioneer. Instead of thinking hard about 
the difficult beauty of the place, the postmaster made sure 
of his immortality; or some other person was so enamoured 
by the fact that blue sky could be seen there that the 
place got a descriptive name suitable for ten thousand 
other places. 

Indian names interest us, and we feel more of them 
should have been preserved. One difficulty might have 
been that there were few Indian names to preserve. A 
nomad people do not need many names. When a settled people 
have six springs in a small locality, they will distinguish 
these six by names, but a visiting band of nomads will be 
content with one and call it simply the spring . And it will 
be the spring to them when they come again, and to other 
visiting bands. The next place visited will also have a 
spring known as the spring . Another difficulty might have 
been that the white man had trouble with Indian names.

Blackfoot. The Englishman might have found the name cumber¬ 
some, and the Frenchman might simply have refused to have a 
name that required the pronunciation of five hard k y s . 

Another Blackfoot name put in translation is Oteschiksisa- 
paghkioteseh. 

Some of the Indian names now in use do not seem natural. 
Possibly the surveyor thought a spot looked pretty and turned 
to his Indian guide to ask for the Indian name for pretty . 

(See Wastash and Wastina) 

Difficulty with the language may have caused corruptions and 
misunderstandings. It is hard to believe that Pembina is 
a corruption of neepimenan as Thompson says, especially as 
there was another Pembina far to the east. Indian names 
on the whole are too few and many of them too doubtful to 
balance the dead weight of uninteresting names we have in 
English. # 

The absence of strata in its society has been a boast 
of the West and yet the big ranchmen have been remembered 
in names like Cochrane and Staveley, the railwaymen in 
Kirkpatrick and Mannville, Indian chiefs in Crowfoot and 
Pakan; explorers, surveyors, artists, kings and their 
councillors have been remembered. Along with these have

come a host of names of men evidently no greater and no less 
than their fellows. Whether-it is more democratic to call 
a place by the name of an ordinary settler or to refuse to 
call it by such a name since it will raise the man above 
his fellows is not a question this thesis will seek to 
answer. A personal name, however, cannot be very interest¬ 
ing as a place name if it names a man the equal in pov/er and 
glory to ten thousand other men. McLeod Lake is named after 
Captain G. McLeod, D.L.S. There may be some interesting 
Alberta history connected with the name of this surveyor 
captain. The town of Macleod was named after Colonel Macleod 
of the N.W.M.P., "stamix-otokan-okowy” to the Blackfeet, 
since the Colonel had the bull T s head crest of the Macleods 
over his door. McLeod River was called McLeod T s River on 
the David Thompson map of 1814. Who was this McLeod? His 
name was given to a tributary of the Athabasca before 1814. 

If he did something more than the ordinary man - and this 
is almost certain, since the date is before 1814 - we should 
know about him. McLeod Lake was given its name in lSl6, 
the barracks at Macleod were constructed in 1874, and 
McLeod River had its name by 1814; and it would seem that 
the personal name added some lustre to the place. If a 
personal name does not do just that, the name will not

the gun on the remainder.

It has been the boast of the West that in spite of 
droughts and blizzards, hailstorms and frosts, in spite of 
the long distances from heavily-populated centres and centres 
of culture, the people have lived . This is quite true, and 
it is equally true that, until recently, few of them have 
died, Rupert Brooke, who described the Rockies as a vast, 
uninhabited land - while admitting its grandeur - finished 
his essay with, ”0ne misses the dead.” Marks of the dead,

remains of a past history, traditions of a former population 
are as scarce on the prairie as in the mountains. Until 
recently, Alberta has been a country of young men and women. 
Settlement in the south began roughly thirty years before 
settlement in the north, and the great tide flowed into the 
south from l?0j? to 191J?. When the country became inhabited, 
it was necessary to begin naming from scratch, as it were. 
How surveyors became weary of having their ingenuity taxed 
for names may be realized by glancing towards the north 
boundary of the province, near the north-west corner. Tired 
of finding names, the surveyor evidently called ten lakes, 
One Lake , Two Lake , Three Lake » and so on up to Ten Lake . 

The necessity of naming many places in quick time, and the 
lack of people and things to name them after could only mean 
that many names of little significance were given to places. 

This investigation into place names has convinced the 
writer that Alberta should lose no time in collecting and 
making accessible all its historical records. One would 
think that a document like the Palliser Report would be 
easy to consult in the city of Edmonton. The City Library 
has no copy. The University has a copy so treasured that 
it is kept in the President 1 s Office and allowed to be read

in the Library only after advance notice to borrow has been 
given and approved. The Provincial Library has a tattered 
copy that one may consult in the library but may not take 
out. Surely some copies of the Report ought to be on hand 
in these libraries and ought to be available for lending 
out. The maps of Alberta in the Provincial Library that 
were made by our early map makers are in sorry condition, 
and it is difficult to get copies of the early maps. If 
one were to judge by the availability of its historical 
records, one would be forced to the conclusion that Alberta 
is not in the least interested in its own history. 

If my last point is justified, it will be borne out 
in the percentages of historical names given to Alberta 
places. The tables show that out of 2,672 names there are 
eight European historical, 91 Indian historical, and 115 
English historical, a total of 8%. The Indian historical 
include personal names, the European and English include 
names that have nothing to do with Alberta history. Alberta 
has recorded her own history in less than five per cent of 
her place names. 

Since there are many drab names (always remembering 
that there is a fair number of very picturesque names),

it is to be expected that the people of Alberta prefer the 
vast quantity of stuff made interesting. Hence the theses 
of honors students in history lie dead in the University 
Library, and Johnny Chinook , giving story, is acclaimed. 

”A mixture of a lie doth ever add pleasure,” Bacon tells us, 
and his truth is made manifest in the way we cling tenaciously 
to little legends. Fincher Greek is given in Place-Names 
of Alberta as ”so named because a man lost a pair horse 
shoe pinchers here.” This explanation seems reasonable 
when we consider how important the pinchers were to the 
blacksmith, and how the whole party would join in the search 
for them. The creek where the man lost the pinchers would 
very soon become Fincher Creek . There is, however, a 
legend. ”A party of surveyors split at the creek, one group 
going north and another west, agreeing to meet again at 
the creek. When the westbound party returned, all they 
could find of their fellows was a pair of pinchers in the 
ashes. Indians had massacred the others.” It is strange 
that the Geographic Board with its ready access to the 
records of surveyors has not recorded this graphic incident 
in its book on Alberta place names. It does agree, however, 
that a pair of pinchers was lost.

It seems to be the practice now to conclude that there 
are no authentic records of Alberta T s history and time will 
be saved by going to the nearest old-timer and asking for 
information. A word of caution against this may not be 
amiss. Old-timers are traditionally improvisers who must 
never be found at a loss. Some will improvise seriously, 
others with a satirical enjoyment of what is expected of 
them. A certain hill near Priddis is known as the Pres¬ 
byterian Hill. The writer, a Presbyterian born, being 
interested in the name, asked his brother-in-law, an old- 
timer of the Priddis district although born in England, 
how the hill got its name. 

"Well, you see, when you get away from Calgary, you 
come, after a while, down a hill. It is called the Mae 
West Hill because of its beautiful curves. Then you go up 
the Presbyterian Hill v/hich is called the Presbyterian 
Hill because it is so bloody straight." 

The old-timers are, nevertheless, the possessors of 
valuable information, and the Province cannot begin too 
early to collect all it can from them. For the first time 
in the history of Alberta, the old-timers are dying off, 
and we are becoming a province of the dead as well as of

the living. We cannot honour the dead by allowing them 
to go to their graves with the information that we will 
some day crave unwritten. We cannot honour the salt of 
our earth by allowing them to die thinking that all they 
know is of no importance to us. We want their information, 
and we should record it in our place names as an honour 
to them and as an education to us and to those who come 
after. 

There is a vast work lying ahead of the Alberta 
historian, and to make that work complete and true we need 
to make every effort to preserve the records already 
written by the historian, the H.W.M.P., the explorer and 
surveyor, the trader, the missionary, and the railway 
people. We need also to write down all that is interest¬ 
ing and authentic that can be spoken now by those who will, 
within a few months or years, not be speaking any more. 

When we know our history in the daylight of truth and 
not in the candlelight of fiction and truth, we can apply 
our knowledge of it in place names that will earn the 
gratitude of Albertans of 2200 A.D.

Fete 


An interesting article by George Pocaterra on Indian 
place names appeared recently in the Calgary Herald - late 1949* 

The writer p>oints out that faulty spelling and faulty 
translations are marks of some of our Indian place names®" 

r, Ihen there is the case of Lake Minnewanka# *Minne ! or 
’HinnES*. as would be preferable, in the language of the Sioux 
nation { the Stoneys belonging to that stem; means % 

1 water 1 f xHdbagKfers but in their tongue there is no such word 

as f wanka f ® 

Here there was committed a double error® W&at the first 
translator wanted to say was t f Mi2mEE- WaklLAH 1 , which means % 
’Spirit-water 1 } and refers to the old Indian legend that some 
spirit-form inhabited the lake® But the real Indian name for 
Lake Minn e wank a is *Inma~stoh f or long narrow lak@ # 1 ImPA* 
being the word for lake, and always preceding the word defining 
what lake® So f Lake Louise* in Stoney is called t ’Imna-toh 1 , 
the*Lake green* or more properly : f Green Lake’® 


"And here we come to some extremely incongruous place-names# 
I am referring now especially to Lake Wapta and Mount 
Wapta, as marked in the maps® How how can one call a lake or 
a mountain - a river? But that is exactly what one does when 

one mentions either Lake Wapta or Mount Wapta, besides which 
the proper pronunciation of the word is not 1 wapta 1 but 
^WapTAE 1 , river# 11

Aecepted Explanations Queried in this Thesis 


Avalon; after Avalon Peninsula, Somerset, Eng., where King Arthur 
died* ( Arthur did not die here) ' 

Baril; probably commemorates some occurrence in which a barrel 
v figured. ( TJncoiJvincing* Baril is a surname*) 

Big Knife; Steele gives the explanation that two Indians, Knife and 

fought and killed each other here. (Yet the 
Indian name Bistcho Is evidently descriptive of a lake) 
Blackfoot; hills. Tyrrell gives the Cree as ^^jis-thi-nloo-wa-chi. 

five Blackfeet having been kille&Hby the 'flrlcs. 9 

Blackraud; creek, trans. of Gree 

(One would think there ought to be some common element in 
the Cree for Blackfoot and Blacbnrud.) 

Bow ; river, lake, etc. the Indians obtained wood for bow-making 
on Bow Biver. Tyrrell gives the Cree name as ma-na-cha-ban 
meaning 'bow', Bow Lake is os kowwiooalni s&Kaherun in Cree, 
meaning ’Coldwter Lake*. On the 1801 Arroweniith map the 
name Askow river is given to the Bow. In the 1822 Arrowsmitfa 
map the name Askow or Bow is given. ( SSfikSw Askow may mean 
ffold j evidently it does not mean bow . Is Bow descriptive, 
and did Tyrrell translate it into Cree?) 

Bowden; after Bowden, near Manchester, Stag*, formerly named Lonenine, 
a well-known stopping place on the Calgary-Edmonton trail. 
(.Although Lonepines are numerous, this particular one might 
have been preserved because of its historical associations.) 
Buck Lake; lake, creek, B.B. trading post. On Arrowsmithrap , lull 

Lake. In Cree. ya-ne-oo « meaning ’bull moose*. In Stoney, 
tam-no-amna . (rather Lacombe 1 s Cree dictionary gives 
ayabe as meaning ’bull 1 , a quite di Lie rent term to those 
above•) 

Buckhorn; P.0. 1908. A pair of deer horns adorns the post office 

gateway; Abraham Davidson, former postmaster, was a keen 
hunter. (This seems rather a flimsy explanation. ) 
Bullpound; creek. In Blackfoot, 8 tom ax ah piskan —’buffalo lull pound* 
a number of Buffalo were killed here in a pound. (ITo 
information as to whether this was an isolated event or 
a yearly practise) 

Clearwater; mountain, river. Washacumow or Clear Water river on 

Turner map, 1790. In stoney, ^onith-ow-wap-ta (Tyrrell# 

(The Cree is -a&agamu — * Clearwater *) 


Cooking; lake, village. Translation of Cree, opiminawasu 
(Is there such a Cree word) 

Cowley; village. Mamed bya rancher, F.T, Godoal; watching his cattle 
wandering over the prairie, he was reminded of Cray’s ’blowing herd 
winds slowly o’ert the lea !? (Seems an odd association of 
term & -- cow-lea ) 


Cuthead; 


eek. According to legend, a translation o 
e. A Cree Indian who eloped 1th a Stoney 


c 

name 

overtaken and beheaded. (Too vague to be convi 
source, no actual Indian name)
