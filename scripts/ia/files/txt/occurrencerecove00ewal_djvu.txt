ABSTRAGI 


The occurrence and recovery of gold in arsenical ores from. 

Sue leer Bay area, L eke Atbabaska, flow sheet design, and estimated costs 
of mining and milling in the region, are described in this thesis. 
Briefly the facts may be stated as follows: 

(I) The Sucker Bay area is easily accessible and presents 
no serious physical handicaps to mining. 

(£) General geological conditions appear favorable and show 
that gold bearing solutions have been active over a large area within 
the region. 

(3) Mineralisation carrying gold is found in many separate 
localities and is confined to shear zones, varying in width up to 5 feet. 

(4) The metallics are in order of abundance: arsenopyrit®, 
pyrite, pyrrhotite? limonite? and gold. The gangu© is chiefly quartz. 

(5) Laboratory tests show high gold recovery by amalgamation 
and cyanidation and generally low erratic recovery by flotation. 

Gy&nid© consumption ©n raw ©re is high - up to 14 pounds per ton, 

(6) Based on laboratory tests a simple flow sheet has been 
designed using amalgamation plates and corduroy blankets. 

(?) Mining and milling costs in the Sucker Bay area should 
compare favorably with those of northern Ontario and Quebec.

OCCURRENCE 

OF 

GOLD BEARING ARSENICAL ORES, 


SUCKER BAY AREA, ATHABASKA LAKE, SASKATCHEWAN 


INTRODUCTION 


Location 

The Sue leer Bay area is located at the east end of Lake At hah as ka in 
the province of Saskatchewan, approximately 66 miles east of Goldfields and 
about 20 miles east of the fur trading post of Fond du Lac. It includes the 
area just north of the west end of Pino Channel, which connects Lake Athabaska 
with Fond du Lac. (S@© map No. 1). The AlgoId, Standard, Baska, Circle and 
Norsask groups of mineral claims are located around Sucker Bay, which is in 
the centre of the area. 

Accessibility 

The area is most accessible by way of rail from Edmonton to 
Waterways (300 miles), Athabaska river from Waterways to Chipewyan (235 miles), 
and then along the north shore of Lake Athabaska by boat via Goldfields and 
Fond du Lac (170 miles). Total distance from. Edmonton by this rout© is 
about 700 miles. 

During the summer months regular train and boat service connects 
Edmonton with Goldfields. The Northern Alberta Railways Company connects 
Edmonton with Waterways . The MacKenzie River Transport, Hudson Bay Company 
and the Mclnnis Fish Company maintain regular boat service from Waterways 
to Goldfields. Aeroplane service to Goldfields is continuous the year 














( 2 . 


round < 3 x 09 pt for slight interruptions during freeze up and break up. Three 
companies, Canadian Airways Limited, MacKenzie Air Service Limited, and 
United Air Transport Limited, operate planes into the northern mining areas 
from Edmonton. 

No regular boat travel has been established between Goldfields and 
Sucker Bay. Mail is delivered to Fond du Lac and Stony Rapids, two Hudson 
Bay trading posts, two or three times a year. Aeroplane service into the 
area is also intermittent, planes going in only on private charter. 

Privately owned boats capable of carrying freight up to seven tons can be 
hired at Goldfields at reasonable rates to transport men and supplies to 
the Sucker Bay area. 

History 

The five groups of claims were staked by Messrs. Caldwell and Duffy 
in the fall of 1935 on various showings of gold in quarts-pyrit©-arsenopyrite 
veins and on shear zones impregnated with quartz and sulfide mineralizations. 

The AlgoId and Standard group of claims were first optioned by 
the Consolidated Mining and Smelting Company. The gold bearing vein or break 
in the Algold group was traced up the hill immediately north of the 
east end of the inlet and inland about 900 to 1000 feet. Test pits and 
trenches were opened at irregular intervals and sampled. On the Standard 
group a shear zone beginning at the free gold showing on the shore of Sucker 
Bay was traced south across the island for a distance of about 775 feet. 

Test pits and trenches were opened up at intervals and sampled. 

Results obtained from both of these groups of claims did not appear 
encouraging and the option^dropped. 

The five groups of claims were then optioned by Mr. Curtis Munson 
and on the 15th of June, 1936, four men under Mr. Caldwell (prospector) 
were sent to the properties with instructions to sink test pits and trenches

on the Standard and Basks, free gold showings. 

Dr. Cameron and the writer examined the property on behalf of Mr. 
Munson during the first week of July, 1956. The pits and trenches made by 
Caldwell and his party were cleaned and sampled by the writer, and some of 
the pits and trenches previously dug by the Consolidated Mining and Smelting 
Company of Canada Limited, were cleaned and resampled. A general field study 
of the claims was also made. These results, together with the information 
gained by the field examination seemed sufficiently promising to warrant more 
detailed examination. On July 19, the writer with three more men, proceeded 
to the property to take charge of operations and spent until the end of August 
in further trenching and sampling together with a more detailed study of the 
geology of the claim. The results of this work are herein reported.

GEMER&L IHFORMJkTION 


Climate 

The winters in the Lake Athabaska region are fairly long and 
temperatures of 45° and 60° below zero are not uncommon. Lake Athabaska, 
being a large body of water of some 5000 square miles, has a large influence 
in lowering summer temperatures and retarding the advance of spring in the 
country adjacent to it because ice remains in the lake until June. Summer 
temperatures occasionally reach a maximum of about 85° F. during the months 
of June, July end August. The nights are always cool with temperatures 
around 50° F. Freeze up comes generally around the middle of October. The 
annual precipitation is about 15 to 20 inches. 

Water Supply 

Water supply presents no problem as the claims are located on the 
shores of Lake Athabaska. The lake is large and deep and since there is 
little danger of pollution the water can b© used for domestic and other 
purposes. 

Surveys 

A stadia traverse w as made of the shoreline of Athabaska Lake 
including the Sucker Bay area by A. H. Haultain, topographer for the 
Geological Survey of Canada in 1914, The area was photographically surveyed 
and ma pped by the Topographic Survey of Canada in preparation of Map Sheet 
74-0, Fond du Lac sheet, of the National Topographic series published in 1934. 
Otherwise the area lies beyond the limits of the Dominion and Provincial 
land surveys and no detailed surveying has been don© therein. Excellent 
oblique aerial photographs of the region are included in the photos taken 
in flight A2518 of the Royal Canadian Air Force, Photographic Division. 

Photos 26 to 33 inclusive cover the area known as the Sucker Bay Mining area.

A limited amount of stadia-compass traverse was don© by the writer 
on the various groups of claims to tie in tho mineralized zones but no 
detailed survey for claim delineation was undertaken. Geographic location 
of claim posts and shapes of claims as shown on maps accompanying this 
thesis are based on claim maps issued by the Department of Lands and Resources, 
Province of Saskatchewan, and drawn on basis of information supplied by the 
original prospectors. Accuracy .of position is thus not vouched for. 

Power 

No survey of possible water power sites in the Sue leer Bay area has 
been made to date. There are, however, two rivers - the Robillard and the 
Grease, closely adjacent to the mining fields, which may have potential 
water powe r sites. 

At present diesel oil sells at $7.40 per barrel, car lots 
MacMurray. The bituminous sands of the Athabaska River fora a potential 
source of supply of the material. Two companies. Aba sand Oils and Athabaska 
Bituminous Sand Company, are developing processes for their extraction and 
utilization of this material, although there is no commercial production 
suitable for Diesel engines at present. Estimates based on Clarke* s * 
figures show that diesel oil can be produced from these materials at a cost 
not exceeding $2.00 per barrel. Other private sources of information 
indicate costs as low as $1,50. 

Coal for steam power development cannot compete with these figures 
although some coal may be necessary for heating purposes. Cost of coal at 
MacMurray is shown in the table below;

Timber and Fuel 

A limited amount of timber oocurs in the Sucker Bay area* The 
rocky hills and ridges are for the most part bare* In the lowlands the timber 
growth consists of birch, spruce, tamarack and willow, none of which grow to 
any great size* On the south shore of the lake, however, timber growth is 
more luxuriant and it is quite possible that fairly good stands for mining 
purposes could be located within reasonable distance of the Sucker Bay area* 

The stand of timber within the area is sufficient to supply small 
mining camps with fuel over a short period of years* 

Supp lies 

All supplies such as food stuffs, machinery, powder, etc. can most 
easily be obtained from Edmonton. Fort McMurray and Goldfields are temporary 
store houses for food supplies* 

Labour 

Experienced labour may also be obtained in Edmonton* There are no 
people other than a few trappers living within the Sucker Bay Mining area* 
Goldfields, located within the Beaverlodge mining area, has a population of 
about 400* Of this number, most of the male population is, however, em¬ 
ployed by the mining camps within the area* Companies hiring men in Edmonton 
can transport them fairly cheaply by rail and boat. The scale of wages 
adopted by mining companies operating in the Beaverlodge mining area is as 
follows ? 

Miners and steel men #4*00 to $4*50 per day 

Muckers and helpers 3.75 to 4.00 per day 

Samplers $100.00 per month 

Assayers $100.00 per month 

Steel sharpers $4*00 to $4.50 

Mechanics 4.00 to 5.00 

Hoist men 4.75 to 5.00 

Surface men 3.75 to 4.00

are located at Goldfields, but these are privately owned and do not do commer¬ 
cial assaying. The nearest commercial assay offices are located in Edmonton, 
two of which arej J. A. Kelso, Provincial Analyst, University of Alberta, 
Edmonton, and Christopher Riley Assay Co. Ltd., Edmonton.

Sampling and Field Records 

Extreme care was exercised at all times in the sampling operation. 
Trenches and test pits were always thoroughly cleaned, brushed with a heavy 
bristled brush and washed with water before they were sampled. Channel 
samples were taken and these were out at right angles to the shear zone or 
vein sampled. The width of the sample varied, depending upon whether it was 
desired to determine a mineable width, values in the wall rock or values in 
the vein. Channels were cut from 2 to 5 inches in width and from J to 1 inch 
in depth. If wall rock was sampled the amount of rock removed per foot of 
channel was about 1 pound. If vein material heavily mineralised was sampled 
larger samples were taken, usually up to 2 or 3 pounds per foot. Nine bulk 
samples of about 75 pounds were taken from the main trenches of the various 
claims. These bulk samples were taken for the purpose of laboratory tests 
for gold recovery. 

Pointed, four cornered sampling moils about 10 inches in length and 
made from 3/4 inch good grade steel were used to cut the channels. All 
cuttings were caught on a 7* by 7 f , 12 oz. duck canvas sheet mounted on a 

frame, 

All samples were labelled in the field at the time they were taken 
with two paper labels. One was placed within the sample bag and one was tied 
to the outside. The width of the sample taken was marked on the ground with 
red paint and marked with a number corresponding to the bag sample number. 

In a sample notebook a detailed description was made of the sample. The 
date, sampler, w idth of sample, number of sample, geological formation, 
mineralization, location and any other pertinent information was recorded. 

In a field notebook record of all general geological data and 
traverses, compass stadia surveys were kept.

The length of time and type of work done on each group of claims 
was recorded in the time book. A record of all expenses was also kept. 4 
general map of the area on a scale of to the mile was made in the field 
by means of a grid from the Royal Canadian Air Force photographs. On this 
map was plotted all information gathered in the field, including geological 
formations, shear zones, etc. The general geological map contained in this 
thesis was reduced in scale from this map. 

A stadia traverse was made of the important shear zone, and the 
detailed maps contained in this thesis were plotted from these traverses.

GENERAL GEOLOGY 

Topography 

The Sucker Bay area is characterised by a number of long, narrow 
fiord-like bays or inlets running approximately east from t&e main body of 
Athabaska Lake. Usually a string of islands extend into Athabaska Lake as 
continuations of the points of the mainland. 

In the immediate vicinity of Athabaska Lake the relief is not pro¬ 
nounced, the mainland seldom rising to elevations in excess of 100 to 150 
feet above the water level. In the Robillard river area, however, and east 
of the east end of Sucker Bay the ground rises rapidly to elevations estimated 
to be in excess of 500 feet above the level of Athabaska Lake. 

The most pronounced characteristic of the topography of the region 
is the relative parallelism of the bays and intervening peninsulas. The 
aerial photographs of the region (Figs. 1,2,3,4), show this feature is due 
to structural conditions in the bedrock of the district® 

Geolo gy 

The explorations, surveys and examinations of J. B. Tyrrell (2), 

F, J. Alcock (3), and C® Camsell (4), have outlined the main geological 
features of the Sucker Bay area. They report three main rock types or 
formations? 

1. Foliated norite in sheets, dykes and sills, intrusive into 

the other two formations • 

2. Reddish sandstones and conglomerates, the Athabaska series® 

3. Foliated gneissic rocks, essentially laurentian granite gneiss. 

Later, diabase dykes and sills cut all these formations. 

Aerial distribution of these main rock types is shown in Map No. 2. 


The above classification broadly differentiates the main rock 
types of the Sucker Bay area. Detailed examination, however, shows that 








( 11 . 


there are many minor types. Acid intrusives in the form of granite tosses 
and dykes and pegmatite -veins cut the older rocks. Hybrid rocks associated 
with and along the contact of the intrusives, particularly the norite, 
develop local facies which may vary in short distances from acid quartz- 
rich types to basic amphibolites and pyroxenites. Microscopic examination 
of specimens taken from the basic intrusives show a preponderance of 
olivine and therefore these rocks could well he called olivine norites. 

The foliated gneissic rocks are clearly, in places, a granitoid 
complex of highly altered sediments. Bands of quartzites and quartz-rich 
rock alternate with more basic foliated types, and garnets are not uncommon. 
The whole complex shows a very definite and persistent foliation indicative 
of previous bedding. These features make it clear that the gneissic mass 
is largely a paragneiss derived by metamorphism of an earlier sedimentary 
series. 

In the northern portion of the map area, in the vicinity of 
Robillard river,, the gneissic complex is much more granitic in character than 
that further south, and knobs and bosses of granite are to be found intruding 
the granitic gneiss. The granitic character of the gneisses in this section 
is characteristic and as they can be readily differentiated from the 
paragneisses in the field they have been separately mapped. 

Geological structures in the area are relatively simple and are 
clearly shown in the aerial photographs (Figs. 1,2,3,4), North of Pine 
Channel the rocks have a persistent easterly strike and dip to the south. 
South of the channel the sandstones and conglomerates of the Athabaska 
series are flat lying. The change in dip occurs in Pine Channel itself and 
the nature of the change is not observable. Generally in the Athabaska Lake 
region the flat lying Athabaska series unconformably overlies the older rocks. 
Camsell however, reports that he found metamorphosed and tilted 




Athabaska series rocks on the north shore of Pine Channel intruded by 
norite and suggests that intrusion of the norite is responsible for the 
uplift and tilting. The persistency of easterly strike and southerly dip 
to all the rocks between Robillard River and Pine Channel, including strike 
and dip of the granite gneisses to the north and of the norite dykes and 
masses around Sucker Bay and Camille Bay suggest strongly that they have 
been developed, by the granitic intrusion to the north of the area rather 
than by norite intrusions around Pine Channel. The large and broad swing 
in strike occurring east of Sucker Bay as shown in the Aerial Photograph, 

Fig* 1* however, can hardly be placed to this cause also* It is probably 
the result of more massive norite intrusions occurring, as noted by Cams ell, 
north and east of Pine Channel. The general structure features of the 
area, must, therefore, be placed as due to both intrusions. Disturbance of 
the norite dykes and the presence of pegmatites cutting both gneisses and 
norite clearly indicate that the granitic intrusions were subsequent to the 
norite intrusions, or at least to some of them. If the norite intrusions 
occur, as reported by Camsell, cutting the Athabaska series, the granites 
are clearly amongst the most recent rocks of the region. 

Two secondary structures are imposed upon the general structure 
of the region. One consists of sharp walled cross fractures or shear zones 
striking generally northwesterly and thus cutting the foliation of the 
gneisses and the strike of the norite at an acute angle. In one or two 
places similar shear zones are developed parallel to the strike of the 
country rock but dipping steeply to the north and thus cross cut the gneissic 
foliation. 

These shear zones vary in width from a few inches to twenty or 
more feet. Within the zone of shearing the rocks are broken and badly dis¬ 
located but the relative absence of slickensiding suggests that there has 
been little displacement. The shear zones have been subsequently re-cemented 


■ 





(IS 


with quartz and mineralized with pyrite, arsenopyrite, pyrrhotite and galena. 
Gold is, in places.associated with the pyrite and arsenopyrite of this 
mineralization and it is within these shear zones that the gold bearing ore 
bodies are found. It is a reasonable assumption that this mineralization is 
associated with the granitic -intrusions. 

The other secondary structure is a distinctly developed twisted 
zone which shows on the east end of Standard Island at the mouth of Sucker 
Bay and at the east end of Algold Bay. It can be traced on the ground on 
Nuggett Island, in the center of the Bay, and on the north shore ©.bout the 
west boundary of the Algold claims. Its position on the Algold claims is wall 
shown in the photograph. Fig. 2, and is observable on the ground by changes 
in strike of the paragneiss and of the norite dyke. This twisted zone 
definitely cross outs and dislocates a gold bearing shear zone on the Standard 
claims on Standard Island and probably accounts for the change in dip of the 
gold bearing shear zone on the Algold claims. It is thus, clearly, the most 
recent structural development in the district. 

The geology and structure as outlined above are interpretations 
based on data gathered in the field and information obtained from published 
reports. Twenty-one thin sections were made from hand specimens of various 
types of rocks taksn in the field, but time did not permit to examine these 
in detail. 

Mineralisation (Su I fide ) 

The mineralization of the rocks in the Sucker Bay area may b© 
divided into three classes: 

1. Mineralization in the norite intrusions, 

2. Mineralization in the gneissic complex, 

3. Mineralization in the cross fracture or shear zones. 





(14 


1. The mineralization in the norites consists of pyrrhotite, pyrite and 
arsenopyrite, with smaller amounts of chalcopyrite and niccolite. This group 
of sulfides may all occur in one ore body though more generally pyrrhotite and 
pyrit8, pyrite and arsenopyrite, pyrite or arsenopyrite are the chief minerals 
of the ore body* Mineralization is not massive but occurs finely disseminated / 
in the norite as small particles and hairlike stringers* Mineralization is 
confined only to local areas within the intrusive. The ore bodies are isolated 
but by continuing along the strike of the same intrusive another mineralized 
zone may be found, not necessarily containing the same suite of sulfides as 
the previous ore body* Ore bodies vary in width from 5 feet to 30 feet de¬ 
pending upon the width of the norite sill. The length of the ore bodies 
also varies, two hundred feet probably being a maximum. In the field these 
ore deposits are easily located and recognized by the heavy red weathering 
iron gossans. Gold and silver are not associated with the mineralization in 
the norites. 

2* The mineralization in the gneissic complex is essentially the same 
as that of the norites, with pyrrhotite, pyrite and arsenopyrite minerals 


predominating® The deposits are of a contact metamorphic nature and are no 


'I 


doubt the result of the norite intrusions. The deposits are not continuous 
and as in the norites, they vary in width up to 30 feet. Gold and silver do 
not occur in these deposits® 

3. Mineralization in the cross fracture or shear zones consists of 
arsenopyrite, pyrite, galena, some pyrrhotite, gold and silver. Surface in¬ 
dications do not suggest impregnation of the wall rock and the values will 
likely be confined to the fracture zone. Pieces and fragments of rock with¬ 
in the shear zone, however, are frequently impregnated with ore minerals. 

Narrow veins and stringers of mineral bearing quartz traverse the 




(15 


shear zones* They show as quartz-pyrite or quartz-arsenopyrit©• Occurrence 
of massive pyrite and massive arsenopyrita together in the same stringer is 
unusual. Where arsenopyrita and pyrit© do occur together in the same vain 
or stringer, microscopic examination shows clearly (Figs. 28,29) that pyrite 
is later than arsenopyrite• The veins vary in width from a fraction of an 
inch to the full width of the shear zone® Usually there is greater accumula¬ 
tion of minerals in the narrow veins though widths up to two feat of solid 
arsenopyrite were observed in the field. 

Pyrrhotit© mineralization in shear zones is not as common as pyrit© 
and arsenopyrite, and when it does occur it is associated with small amounts 
of pyrite. Little or no gold seems to be found with this type of minerali¬ 
zation. 

No lead sulfides were observed by the writer on the various groups 
of claims. It is reported, however, that at the extreme east end of Sucker 
Bay cross fractures occur which are impregnated with quartz, galena, pyrite, 
arsenopyrite and gold. 

Sulfides occur both coarsely and finely crystallized* Pyrite cubes 
as large as 3 mm* edge (Fig* 15) may b© found and the mineral varies from 
this size to minute stringers intergranular to quartz. Arsenopyrite fre¬ 
quently appears coarsely crystalline (Fig* 16) but microscopic examination 
usually shows these to be aggregates of relatively finely granular masses. 
Both the pyrite and arsenopyrite show considerable fracturing with the 
fractures refilled with quartz and sometimes gold (Figs. 24, 28). 

Gold is found both free in the quartz (Fig* 23) and associated with 
both pyrit© (Fig. 15) and arsenopyrite (Fig* 17). Where present free in the 
quartz it is relatively coarse (Figs. 23, 27). Where associated with the 
pyrite, quartz stringers invariably lead out from the gold (Fig. 15). Where 




(16 


associated with the arsenopyrite it occurs with quartz or quartz and pyrite 
in the fractures (Fig* 28)* In the latter case gold completely surrounded 
by arsenopyrite is also found in small amounts and the gold is always finely 
divided (Figs. 17, 18, 19). 

The mineralization in the cross fractures is of a later age than 
that in the norites and gneisses and probably is associated with the granitic 
intrusion to the north of the area* 




DESCRIPTION OF PROPERTIES 


AlgoId Claims 

The Algold claims are underlain almost entirely by paragneiss, On© 
norite dyke, paralleling the foliation of the gneiss, cuts across the claims 
from west to east following the north wall of the depression occupied by 
Algold Bay* The dyke is conformable in strike and dip with the gneiss* Just 
east of the east end of Algold Bay the gneiss and dyke swing north in a sharp 
curve on the structure previously described. Just west of this structure a 
northwesterly striking shear zone is exposed at water level at the head of 
Algold Bay and is traceable on the top of the hill on the north side of the 
Bay for several hundred feet* The shear zone is, in places, well mineralized 
with pyrite, arsenopyrite and free gold. 

The shear zone shows as a sharp walled fracture varying in width 
from a few inches to a maximum of 5 feet. Strike of the zone is N. 30® W. 
and dip varies from vertical to 45° east. The rocks traversed by the fracture 
have been greatly crushed and broken, but the absence of sliekensiding suggests 
that there has been but little displacement as a result of the break. Ore 
bearing solutions penetrated the fractured zone w5„th deposition of quartz, 
pyrite and arsenopyrite. Surface indications do not suggest impregnation of 
the wall rock and the values are likely to be confined to the shear zone. 

Pieces and fragments of rock within the shear zone, however, are frequently 
impregnated with ore minerals® 

Location of the shear zone with record of trenches and samples taken 
therefrom is shown on Map No* 3, Results of assays of samples, including 
those taken during the first examination, are tabulated in Table No, 1, 

As shown in the map, the shear zone was traced through the south half 
of claim Algold 1, (M.C. No# S 647) and the northeast quarter of claim Algold 
6, (M.C* No. S 652), It was not definitely located south of Algold Bay but a

depression in the hill side south of the hay suggests its continuation there* 

A cross fracture, in claim Algold 2 (M.C. No. S 648) is defined on strike 
N. 67° W. which appears to intersect the main fracture at about the water 1 s 
edge on the south shore of Algold Bay. 

For purposes of discussion the mineralized zones may b© divided into 
4 sections as follows:- 

Section 1 - From the north end of the traverse (station l) south to 
the crest of the ridge overlooking Algold Bay (station 7) a distance of 439 feet. 

Section 2 - From the crest of the ridge (station 7) south to the foot 
of the ridge (station 12), a distance of 331 feet. 

Section 3 - From the foot of the ridge (station 12) to the water*s 
edge (station IS), a distance of 142 feet. This section is known as the 
’’Water showing’ 1 . 

Section 4 - From the water*s edge (station 19) south across the bay 
and up the hill on the south side to the south end of the traverse (station 18) 
a distance of 649 feet. 

Section 1 ; The north end of this section (station 1) marks the north 
limit of the shear zone as far as could be determined. It here appears as two 
small stringers of quartz, varying in width from 1 to 2 inches, mineralized with 
arsenopyrite. Assay of samples from these stringers is reported in Table No. 1, 
samples Nos. GAL 1 and CAL 2. The quartz stringers occur in gneiss about 10 
feet apart, the country rock itself showing little or no fracture. 

Although a number of traverses were made north of this point, 
continuation of the shear zone could not be located. 

As shown on map No. 3, the shear zone in this section was opened to 
its full width by a series of trenches varying in length from 3 to 35 feet at 
8 points for a total length of 96 feet, and the trenches sampled by channel 
samples at approximately 3 foot intervals. 

This trenching and sampling show that for at least 350 feet the 










( 19 , 


shear zone here averages 3*4" in width and carries values which should 
average 0.20 oz. per ton ore. 

Section 2: Within this section the shear zone is fairly well defined 
from the north end (station 7) to approximately the edge of the cliff (station 
11) but does not show clearly on the cliff face. The outcrop swings east as 
it continues south down the hill indicating an easterly dip to the fracture 
in this section. On the basis of the survey the dip should be about 65° east 
at this point. The occurrence of a fractured and mineralized zone at water’s 
edge in section No. 3, to be discussed later, must indicate the continuation 
of the zone to that point. 

The shear zone, where defined north of the cliff edge is narrower 
and apparently less mineralized than in section 1. Quartz predominates as 
the vein filling and ore minerals are scarce. This section was opened at 
three points by three short trenches. The samples taken therefrom showed no 
values. Time, however, did not permit satisfactory trenching to prove up this 
section. 

Section 5 ; In this section the shear zone is not, as elsewhere, 
sharp walled and clearly defined but the country rock appears broken and more 
irregular in strike and mineralization is developed in a series of independent 
zones. On the basis of the survey, the dip of the zone from the upper 
exposures on the top of the cliff (station 7) to the water showing is 45° 
east. This is less steep than on the north end of section 2 and suggests that 
the zone is flattening at depth. 

Detail of the trenching and sampling at this so called "water 
showing 1 ' is shown in map No. 4. Three mineralised veins were exposed. These, 
although for the most part narrow, locally carry heavy mineralization. Both 
arsenopyrite and pyrite are present and visible gold is readily observable. 
Microscopic examination shows gold free in quartz, and intimately associated 
with the metallic minerals. These associations are identical with those in 





• • ' • •- 











( 20 , 


section No. 1, and there can be no doubt that these exposures represent a 
continuation of the mineral values in the shear zone. 

As shown in the plan, map No. 4, values are not persistent over any 
great length in any one of the veins, although locally values are very high. 
The real importance of these exposures lies in that they indicate continuation 
of mineralization south from the occurrences in section 1. Their position 
at lake shore also suggests extension to depth. 

Section 4; At the south end of section 5 the shear zone runs into 
the water at the east end of Algold Bay. On the south shore opposite, a 
shear zone is developed on a strike which is appreciably more easterly than 
on the north side and the dip in at least one place (station 16) is westerly. 
This shear zone was not examined in any great detail. Five small pits were 
sunk on the zone. It was found to be narrow and tight and only at one point 
was there sufficient mineralization to warrant sampling. Mineralization 
shows quartz, pyrite and arsenopyrite and this is similar to that in the 
shear zones north of the bay. No values were obtained on assaying. 

It is extremely unlikely that this zone represents the continua¬ 
tion of the main shear zone north of the bay. It is definitely off strike 
and off dip and probably represents a cross fracture developed at the same 
time as the main shear. 

A very definite draw filled with debris (boulders, gravel moss, etc.) 
intersects' the south shore of Algold Bay at the north end of the above shear 
zone (station 13) and runs up the hill side at an angle which conforms to the 
strike of the main shear zone, and there is every reason to believe that this 
draw represents the surface outcrop of the main shear zone. At no point in 
this draw was bed rock exposed and time did not permit trenching. 

Standard Claims 

The Standard group, consisting of four claims, was staked on a free 
gold showing in quartz-pyrite-arsenopyrite vein exposed at the north shore of

Standard Island located in the southwest corner of Sucker Bay. The rocks on 
this island are chiefly gneisses, which are intruded on the southern part of 
the island by a norite dyke. This dyke parallels the foliation of the gneiss 
and is conformable in strike and dip. In general the gneisses are darker in 
color than elsewhere, due probably to the absorption of basic rocks or impreg¬ 
nation by the norite. 

There has been more structure developed in the rocks on this island 
than anywhere else in the region under discussion. At the east end of the 
island on claim Standard No. 4 (M.C. S 658) the gneisses and norite dyke have 
been twisted. This twisting is observable on the ground by a change in strike 
to the north. The forces which produced this change also dislocated a shear 
zone cutting from north to south across Standard No* 3 (M.C. 3 657). The 
shear zone is definitely faulted at the north end and cuts off two gold bearing 
veins at the shore of Sue leer Bay, About 320 feet west of this shear zone 
another fault is noticeable. The structure on Standard Island is very well 
illustrated in the aerial photograph No. 3. 

A limited amount of prospect development work and stadia surveying 
was done on these claims'. A stadia traverse was made of the most westerly 
shear zone (shear zone No. 1) on claim Standard No. 3 (M.C. 657). It can be 
traced across the island from north to south and strikes approximately 
N. 12® W. and dips vertically. It has sharp walls and varies in width from 
a few inches to 5 feet. The fracture zone is impregnated with quartz but 
there is no mineralization. At the north end of this zone a fault striking 
N. 15° E. cuts it off about 100 feet from the shore and at the same time 
terminates two gold-quartz veins coming up from the shore. The mineralization 
of these quarts veins is free gold, arsenopyrite, and pyrite. The veins can 
be traced for a distance of about 25 feet and vary in width from a fraction 
of an inch to one foot. Assays of samples taken are shown in table No. 3, 
as samples numbered C.St. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

About 320 foot west of shear zone No, 1 another fracture zone 
striIcing in a north-south direction is traceable across tho island. This 
zone is very narrow and may be the surface indication of a second fault, 
for quite definitely a basic band in the gneiss and a quartz-stibnite vein 
paralleling the foliation of the gneiss are terminated by this shear zone. 

On the west end of the island on claim Standard No, 2 (M.G. S 656), 
a third shear zone striking north and south is traceable over the full width 
of the island. It varies in width from about 2 feet to 15 feet. The zone 
is sharp walled and impregnated with quartz which, however, is not mineralized. 

The stibnite vein on Standard No, 3 previously referred to is about 
5 inches wide. It is well mineralized with stibnite, parallels the strike of 
the. gneiss but dips to the north and therefore outs the foliation of the 
country rock. This vein can be traced about 20 feet on the surface. Results 
of assays of channel samples taken on this vein are shown in table No® 3, 
samples No. C.St. 16 and C.St. 19® 

Another vein conformable in strike and dip to the vein mentioned 
above occurs on claim Standard No. 2 (M.G. S 656) near the south shore of the 
island. The vein is from 6 to 8 inches wide, composed of quartz, mineralised 
in this case, however, with arsenopvrite, Assay of a grab sample taken is 
shown in table No® 3 as sample No® C.St, 31® 

A limited amount of trenching and sampling was done on the Standard 
claims. Trenches and test pits were cleaned, washed and channel sampled, 
including some of the trenches previously sunk by the Consolidated Mining and 
Smelting Company® Location of shear zones, veins and faults on Standard No® 3 
with record of trenches and samples taken therefrom is shown on map No. 5. 
Results of assays including those taken during the first examination are 
tabulated in table No. 3.

Baska Claims 


( 23 . 


Bed rock on the Baska claims consists of para-gneiss, striking 
north 35° east and dipping south 32° to 40°. Three norite dykss parallel 
the foliation of the gneiss and so out across the claims from west to east. 
They are conformable in strike and dip with the para-gneiss and probably 
represent norite sills or flows interbedded with the foliation of the para- 
gneiss. Their position is clearly shown as the strike ridges in areal 
photograph, fig. 4. 

The mineralized shear zone* striking north 55° west with dip 85° 
east, cross cuts the foliation of the gneiss and the norites. Its general 
position is clearly observable in the areal photograph, fig. 4. In places 
this shear zone over narrow widths is well mineralised with pyrite, arseno- 
pyrite and free gold. The zone is defined by a sharp walled fracture which 
varies in width from a few inches to a maximum of 13 \ feet. Considered 
broadly over the whole length of the shear zone the rocks have not been 
greatly broken or displaced. Local areas, however, are exceptions and these 
occur where the shear zone widens. Ore bearing solutions have deposited 
within the fractured zone quartz and the associated minerals. Surface indica¬ 
tions show that the wall rock is barren and within the shear zone mineraliza¬ 
tion seems to be confined chiefly to the quarts. 

Quartz veins, varying in width from a fraction of an inch to several 
feet, traverse the shear zone. The narrower veins are generally more highly 
mineralized than the wider, although this is not always true. Arse no pyrite 
predominates over pyrite but both are gold bearing. Sulfides occur both 
coarsely and finely crystallized, the latter being more auriferous than the 
former. Gold occurs free in the quartz as well as associated with the 
sulfides, 

Location of the shear zone with position of the trenches and record 
of samples taten therefrom is shown in map Bo. 6. Results of assays including

those taken during the first examination are tabulated in table No. 2, 

As shown in map No. the shear zone was traced across the northwest 
corner of claim Baska No. 2 (M.C. S 511), the souttarast corner of claim Baska 
No. 4 (M.C. S 513), and partly across the northeast corner of claim Baska No. 1 
(M.C. S 510), for a total length of 1,265 feet. On the whole the shear zone is 
narrow and tight, and in places the whole shear zone may be confined to a 
quartz stringer only 1 to 2 inches wide. 1/There the fracture zone is only an 
inch or two wide the country rock shows no fracturing and the vein is barren 
of minerals. However, the zone does widen in places and these areas may be 
discussed in greater detail as follows with their location based on the 
stations of stadia compass traverse. 

Station Is On the shore of Norite Bay a quartz vein 8 inches wide 
represents the fracture zone. Within a few feet the vein narrows to 2 inches 
or less and continues as such for over 2-40 feet northward to station 5. The 
wall-rock shows very little fracturing and the quartz vein is barren of 
minerals. Assay results of samples taken gave very low results. (Table No. 2, 
samples C.Ba, 8 & 9) 

Station 5 : At station 5 the zone widens to 3 feet over a distance 
of about 10 feet. In the centre of the zone is a quartz vein 12 inches wide 
on the surface bur narrowing to 3 inches at a depth of 8 feet. The vein is 
mineralized with arsenopyrite and some pyrite; sheared and broken rock with¬ 
in the fractured zone is not mineralised. Results of assa.ys of samples taken 
across the 12 inch quarts vein gave results varying from 0.14 oz. to 0.44 
per ton. (Table No. 2, samples C.Ba. 14, 15, 16.) 

From station 5 north to station 10 a distance of 293 feet, the shear 
zone is replaced by a fracture from 2 to 6 inches in width filled with whit© 
quartz and no associated mineralization. The paragneiss of the country rock 
is very little fractured and in general the shear zone is very tight.

Station 11 to 14s A small depression near station 11 shows a sudden 


widening of the shear zone with a maximum width occurring at station 13 
(Figs. 9, 1C). This trench (station 13) marks the location of the origin¬ 
al discovery in 1935. Within the zone, in the vicinity of station 13, occur 
2 quartz veins, one 0 feet 5 inches, the other 3 feet 0 inches wide. The 
5 inch vein is heavily mineralized with arsenopyrite and assay of samples taken 
across this vein showed values up to 0.64 oz. to the ton. (Table No. 2, 
samples C.Ba. 2, 22). Coarse free gold is visible and microscopic examination 
shows that gold is also intimately associated with the arsenopyrite. The 
vein can be traced over a maximum length of 35 feet between station 12 and 13. 
The 3 foot quartz vein in places is heavily mineralized with pyrite. No free 
gold is visible and the results of assays of samples taken (Table No. 2) 
indicate only low values. 

North from station 13 to station 14 (85 feet) fracturing is less 
pronounced, the high grade vein disappears, at least on the surface, the 
large quartz vein narrows to 1 foot at station 13 and disappears altogether 
at station 14. At station 13 B the quartz carries no mineralization. 

Station 15 and station 17 s North from station 14 the shear zone is 
covered by muskeg as far north as station 17. However at station 15 a fractured 
zone 7 feet in width was opened by trenching. Two lenticular masses of quartz, 
barren of minerals, lie within the zone at this point. Results of assays of 
samples taken report only traces of gold and the walled rooks are barren. 

At station 17, a trench 25 feet long exposed a large iron-stained 
gossan. Country rock is largely norite and the rock is fairly well fractured 
and mineralised with pyrite. It is doubtful if this is a continuation of 
the shear zone as the location of the trench is to the west and south of the 
strike of the main shear zone. Mineralization closely conforms to that of 
the norites of the region, viz., pyrite and pyrrhotite. Results of assays 
of samples taken gave no indication of values. (Table No. 2, samples

C.Ba. 32 & 33). The shear zone could not be traced north of station 17. 

Norsask Claims 

The Norsask group consisting of 10 claims is located to the west of 
the Baska group. The geology is essentially the same as that of the Baska 
claims and need not be further discussed here. 

A shear zone varying in width up to three feet cuts across Norsask 
No. 3 (M.G. S 1263), Norsask No. 4 (M.G. S 1264) and Norsask No. 5 (M.G. S 1265 ). 
The zone is impregnated in places with quartz and some sulfide mineralization. 
With the exception of one test pit on Norsask No. 5 on the shore of Sucker Bay, 
no other prospect development work was done on this shear zone. Results of 
assays of samples taken at this point are shown in table No. 2 A, as sample 
numbers C.Nor.l, C.Nor.2, C.Nor.3, G.Nor.4, 

Circle Claims 

Circle claims are located at the east end of Sucker Bay. They were 
staked on a quartz-pyrrhotite-pyrite vein exposed on a peninsula in the center 
of the bay. The bedrock on these claims consists of gneisses cut by two, or 
possibly three norite dykes which conform in strike and dip to the folia¬ 
tion of the country rook, A norite dyke about 100 feet wide outcropping on 
the south shore of the peninsula is the largest of its kind located in the 
region. A shear zone varying in width from. 15 to 50 feet traverses the para- 
gneisses striking N.51°W. and cuts across claim Circle No. 2 from north to 
south. This fracture zone is by far the widest in the district and can be 
traced for several miles. Its location is easily observable in aerial photo¬ 
graph No, 1. On the ground it is represented by a ravine or low lying ground 
which for the most part is filled in. with debris or covered by swamp. On 
claim Circle No. 2 (M.C. S 1255), bedrock in the shear zone is exjjosed for a 
distance of about 360 feet. It varies in width from 10 to 30 feet. The 
fracture zone is sharp walled and is impregnated with quartz* pyrrhotite and

pyrite. In places almost pure quarts without mineralisation occupies the entire 
width of the zone. The quartz, however, does not persist and disappears within 
a short distance. Free gold was not found in this zone. 

Three trenches ware sunk across the fracture zone on claim Circle 
Ho* 2, Location of shear zone with record of trenches and samples taken 
therefrom is shown on map No. 7. Results of assays of channel samples taken, 
are shown on table No. 4. 

These trenches may be discussed in greater detail as follows: 

Trench No. 1 (Fig. No. 13): This trench exposed 20 feet of the width 
of the zone, which consisted of broken and breeclated rock impregnated with 
quartz, pyrrhotite and some pyrite. The west side of the fracture zone has a 
sha rp wall. The east side was not determined as it was covered by heavy 
overburden. Ten channel samples over 2 feet sections were taken. 

Trench No» 2 (Fig. No. 14); Trench No. 2 was located 75 feet south 
of trench No. 1 and is 26 feet in length. The shear zone here,as far as 
exposed, consists almost entirely of white quarts sparsely mineralized with 
pyrrhotite and pyrite. The west wall of the fracture zone is sharp. The 
east wall ms not determined. Thirteen channel samples over 2 foot sections 
were taken. 

Trench No . 3: This trench 16 feet long is located about 42 feet 
south of trench No, 2. The shear zone here contains no quartz but consists 
of very basic, oxi&iged and broken rock heavily mineralised in places with 
pyrrhotite. Eight channel samples over 2 foot sections were taken.

CONCLUSIONS 


General 


Tha Sucker Bay area is fairly easily accessible in summer by the 
combined rail and water route, and for most of the year by aeroplane. The 
climate, though fairly severe in winter, presents no serious handicaps. The 
Robillard and Grease rivers may have potential water sites located on them 
and a good supply of water from Lake Athabaska can be obtained on all the 
claims. Very little timber for mining purposes is available in the area, 
but there are sufficient stands to supply small mines with fuel for a period 
of year-s . Supplies such as food stuffs and machinery are easily obtainable 
in Edmonton. Labor is a more serious problem and will have to be imported 
from Goldfields or Edmonton, Freight rates are not excessive. There are thus 
no definite physical handicaps to mining in the region and cost of development 
and exploitation should compare favorably with those of the outlying districts 
of Ontario and Quebec, 

General geological conditions of the Sucker Bay area appear favor¬ 
able and show that gold bearing solutions have been active over a large area 
within the region. Mineralization carrying gold is found in many separated 
localities and it is reasonable to expect that in some of them large enough ; 


deposits will be found to be successfully exploited. 

Of the groups of mineral claims examined three of them, Algold, 
Standard and Baska, showed gold values in shear zones sufficiently high to 
suggest the possibility of ore deposits of economic significance, These are 
as follows; 

Algold Claims 


The results of the field examination reported here indicated that 
the north portion of shear zone located in claim Algold No. 1 (M-C. S 647) has 
a section over 350 feet in length which for an average width of 3 feet 4 inches 








\ 













( 29 . 


carries values shown by surface sampling which should average 0*20 ounces troy 
gold ($7.00) per ton of rock. 

This gold occurs free in quarts filling in the shear zone and 
intimately associated with pyrite and arsenopyrite mineralization accompanying 

the quartz. 

Standard Claims 

High gold values were obtained from three outcrops on these claims, 

namely*. 

(1) Two gold veins on the shore of claim Standard No. 5, 

(2) Quarts vein mineralised with stibnite on claim Standard No. 3. 

(3) Quartz vein mineralized with arsenopyrite on claim Standard No* 2* 
Basin Claims 

A shear zone 1265 feet in length was delineated on these claims. 

Two sections in the shear zone gave gold values sufficiently high to indicate 
possibilities of mineral deposits of economic importance, These two sections 
are; 

(1) At station 5 where shear zone widens to about 3 feet for a 
distance of 10 feet and results of assays of samples taken from a quarts vein 
in this section of the zone run from 0*14 ounces to 0.44 ounces per ton. 

(2) Between stations 11 to 14 where a 5 inch quartz vein heavily 
mineralized with arsenopyrite was traced over a distance of 35 feet. Resiilts 
of assays, of channel samples taken across this vein gave values up to 0.64 
ounces per ton. A hand picked bulk sample of about 75 lbs. taken from this 
vein assayed 7 ounces per ton. This suggests that if mineable quantities of 
ore can be found in this section, high grading by hand picking may be 
possible.

PART II 


REGCVERl 

OF 


GOLD FROM ARSEMG&L ORES, 

SUCKER BAY AREA, ATHABASKA LAKE, SJ&MSCtiBaMw 


INTRODUCTION 


Th® selection ©f a process for treating a gold ©re is governed 
primarily by the characteristics ©f the ©re under consideration. The form 
in which the gold occurs, its mode of association with other minerals, and 
the size and surface condition of the gold particles ar© important factors 
which influence materially the choice of procedure for recovering gold. A 
knowledge of these characteristics may be obtained by microscopic and chemical 
methods combined with’ experimental testing. 

Amalgamation, cyanidation, flotation and gravity methods ar© all 
adapted to the treatment of gold ores, each of course with its peculiar 
limitations. 

The principles involved in the above methods of recover ar® well 
known. The theoretical quantities of reagents, amalgam, cyanide, surface 
areas, etc. may all be calculated, but the errors due to assumption greatly 
exceeds the accuracy of the calculations. Experiments t© determine suitable 
procedures of gold recovery, and the proper kind and amounts of reagents for 
a given ore, appears to be the only satisfactory method. Results of careful 
experiment in laboratory sized equipment can be duplicated in plant practice 
to a remarkable degree. 

Nevertheless, even in experimental work, a start must be mad® 




' 




( 31 . 


somewhere, and obviously established practice elsewhere on ores of the same 
general type, is the best possible basis for original experimental work. If 
the proposition is a new development in an established field, methods used 
in adjacent plants are available, as are also, usually, the results of 
experimental work carried out previously by these other plants. If it is 
a new type of ore, i.e. different mineral association or a new field, the ore 
must be thoroughly studied as to mineralogical character, and the distribu¬ 
tion of the desired minerals, and the literature searched for results on 
similar ores. Standard references and texts (5,6,7,8,9) generally carry 
summaries of reagent and cyanide consumption for different types ©f ©res, m 
well as give information ©n methods ©f recovery. Because ©f the rapid devel¬ 
opment and changes in modern ore dressing and metallurgy, it is always- pre¬ 
ferable to us© the latest figures available. In this respect the publication® 
©f the United States Bureau of Mines, and the Testing and Research 
Laboratories, Mines Branch, Canada, ar© particularly helpful. From the 
United States Bureau of Mines bulletins may be obtained for a nominal sumj 
Reports of Investigations and Information Circulars &r© issued free • In 
Canada, the Dominion Government has an excellently equipped and maimed testing 
laboratory at Ottawa, and practically all Canadian ores have the preliminary 
experimental work don© there. These tests are published in bulletins, under 
the heading of ’^Investigations in Or® Dressing and Metallurgy’ 1 and serve as 
a very useful source for information. 

There ar© comparatively few arsenical gold ©res mined or treated 
in Canada and the United States. Literature pertaining to gold recovery 
from arsenical ores is by no means extensive. The ores of the Beattie 
in Quebec and the Hedley Mascotmin© in B. C. are probably the chief ores 
of this type mined and treated commercially in Canada. Both of these mines 
had considerable difficulty in the treatment of their ©res in the early 






.

stages of operation. Recovery of gold from the Beattie ore by cyanidation 
was poor. Flotation was adopted and the flotation concentrate had to b® 
shipped all the my from northern Quebec to Tacoma, Washington, for final 
recovery of the gold values. Recently the company has installed roasting 
equipment at the plant and cyanidation follows flotation and roasting of the 
flotation concentrates. The occurrence of fin® gold in dens© araenopyrite, 
in the Hedley Mascot or®, made liberation of the gold from the sulfides 
difficult. The gold is extremely fine grained and its position appears t© 
be independent ©f the fracturing of the ar senopyr it©. Tests carried out ©n 
the Mascot ora, assaying 0.3 ounce per ton, showed that slightly ©wr 80 
per cent of the gold could b® extracted by cyanidation. Flotation at first 
showed a rather poor ratio of concentration. Roasting of the ore could not 
be considered, inview #f the location of the property in an important fruit 
producing belt. Other references in the literature to 

tests made on arsenical ores give high eyanid© consumption, fouling of 
cyanide solutions, fouling ©f mercury, fin© grinding, special treatment such 
as roasting and generally low recovery by amalgamation and cyanidation. 

Fin© gold in pyrit© is also often associated with arsenical ©r©s 
and makes recovery difficult. Gold is often dirty or H rusty** which precludes 
recovery by amalgamation. 

In the face of these difficulties it is only natural that th© 
metallurgy of arsenical ores b© investigated first to discover an economical 
method of treatment, before an extensive program ©f development or ming 
is carried out. 

Th© ores on which the tests reported herein have been conducted 
ar© not only significant in that they are arsenical ores, and therefore may 
b© difficult to treat, but also in that they cam© from an area that is quit© 
remote and in which only recently gold has been found. This work is th© 
first of its kind don© on ary of the ores in the area.

SAMPLING, ASSAYING AND CHEMICAL ANALYSES 


Sampling is the operation of taking from a given lot of material 
a portion that is as nearly representative of the whole as possible, and is 
of convenient sis© for testing or analysis. To represent the whole it is 
necessary to take the sample frequently, or in as many places as possible 
and to take the same quantity each time at regular intervals. Correct 
sampling procedure aims to secure portions of the ore body large enough to 
yield results, within reasonable limits of error. Sine© metals are rarely 
distributed by nature in an even manner, it is impossible t© obtain mathe¬ 
matically exact samples. 

In mining, sampling is first employed during the prospecting and 
exploration period. Tisual examination of tb© samples with the naked ©y® or 
th© microscope and chemical analysis may assist the skilled geologist to 
formulate an opinion on th® probable extension of th© ©re. In milling, 
samples show how th© process is .working out, what values ar® going into th® 
concentrates and what is going to waste in th© tails. 

Fir© assay determinations involve the separation ©f the metal sought 
from th© constituents of th© or©, by th© aid of fire and suitable fluxes and 
its estimation by weighing in a state of purity. 

Fir© assaying gives accurate gold results providing correct methods 
and fluxes ar® used. It is general practice in the Ore Brassing Laboratories 
of the Mines Branch, Department 0 f Mines, Ottawa, t© roast all high sulfide 
ores before running assays for gold and silver determination. Roasting will 
d rive off th© sulphur which, if present in appreciable ©mounts in an assay 
charge, will form matt® causing a consequent loss of the precious metals. 

Much more injurious are arsenic and antimony in a charge, for not only will 
they form speiss, but when th© temperature rises above 700® C. arsenates and 








■ 






























(34 


antimonates are formed which produce a slag which will dissolve gold and 

silver. 

Arsenic may be volatilised by roasting, and Neville S. Spence 
showed that to secure good results the arsenic must be volatilized at low 
temperature. In a series of roasting tests conducted on concentrates 
running 15.52% As and 19.30$ S he found that the gold loss was about 1.7% 
on ore roasted below 400° C., but between 500° 0. to 700° G• the gold loss in¬ 
creased in linear proportions. Over 700° G. there was a gradual falling off. 
The upper limit was not determined, but at 800® 0. the gold loss was around 
34 $. 

Chemical analyses for Fe, As, S, GaO, SiOg and ^InsoX* wore made on 
representative samples of the three ores and on some screen products. Methods 
used were in all cases routine analytical methods as detailed in standard 
references . From the results of these analyses metallic mineral 

content was estSjnated, Results of analyses and calculated metallic mineral 
content are shown in Table No. 8. No chemical analyses were made of the 
other ores used since it was quite evident from observations made on the 
unorushed ore, grad© of concentrate obtained in flotation, and losses in 
weight sustained in roasting, that the metallics and gangu® were well within 
the rang© of the other ores. 

Samples for laboratory testing were taken from the more highly 
mineralized portions of the shear zones. About 1000 pounds of ore were 
taken as a series of bulk samples, varying in weight from 60 to 100 pounds. 
These samples were selected from various shear zones, and probably were 
not taken according to the orthodox rules of sampling, yet, the writer 
feels quit9 sure that the character of the ore shipped will approximate 
very closely that of the or© that may be taken from the min© should ore- 
bodies of economic size ever be determined in the area.

Each bulk sample was first crushed in a jaw crusher and a gyratory 
crusher until a minus 8 mesh product was obtained. From this product batches 
for various tests were taken, Although the minus 8 mesh material was well 
mixed originally in order to produce a uniform product * no particular attempt 
was mad® when each batch was withdrawn to obtain a representative sample 
of the whole. Consequently the heads * though coming from th© same feed, may 
vary from test to test. 

Fir® assay tests conducted on th© ores and concentrates using just 

enough litharge for a lead button, showed a gold loss of 30% whan the slag 

was reassayed. When a large excess of litharge was used, gold losses 

dropped to between 3% and 5%* This was still considered too high a loss to 

give reliable results and all ores and concentrates were washed for half an 

hour at a temperature not exceeding 400® C. With roasted ©res good results 

were obtained. The following charge was used*

MIMEROGRAPHY 

The American Cyanamid Co. (22) states "The increasing complexity 
of ore-treatment problems and the ever present demand for higher metallurgical 
efficiency and lower treatment costs have made it necessary for the ore 
dressing engineer to make use of more refined equipment end technique in his 
experimental investigations* 

"In modern ore dressing practice the microscope is assuming an in¬ 
creasingly important role because it furnishes the following pertinent in¬ 
formations 

(1) The mineralogical composition of a given ore® 

"Very often the microscope reveals the presence of minerals which the 
more usual methods of physical and chemical examinations of hand specimens 
would not disclose® 

(2) The size, range and manner of association of various mineral 

constituents » 

"This information is essential to determine the degree of grinding 
which is necessary to liberate the valuable minerals from gangue and from 
each other* 

(3) The structural characteristics of the various minerals present, 

such as surface coatings, degree of alteration or oxidation. 

"Such information accounts for the peculiar or anomalous behavior 
of certain minerals in the course of the treatment of the ore". 

The visible range of the microscope is between 150 microns (*0058") 
the smallest structure visible to the ©ye, and 0*02 microns® 

Since in ore dressing we are concerned with microscopic particles, 
it is to our interest to determine the physical and chemical properties of 
these particles* This can best be don© with th© microscope. 

Specimens were selected from the sample shipment and seventeen

polished sections were prepared and examined microscopically for the purpose 
of determining the character of the ore. Some of the polished sections were 
prepared in the laboratories of the University of &lberta; others were mad® 
by the Mines Branch, Ottawa, 

The polished sections were examined in detail and photomicrographs 
taken to illustrate the character of the ore and the mod© of gold deposition. 
Typical sections are shown in Figs, 15 - 30. 

Characteristics of Ore 

Microscopic examinations of the polished sections indicate that 
the gangue consists chiefly ©f quarts with some feldspar and ferrous mag¬ 
nesium minerals. 

The metallic minerals visible in the polished sections are in the 
order of their abundances arsenopyrite, pyrite, limonit© (?), pyrrhotite (■?) 
and gold,. The arson©pyrit© occurs as ©oars© grains and crystalline masses 
and is crossed by irregular stringers and fractures that contain quarts * pyrite 
and gold. (Figs, 26, 30). Where pyrite occurs in large fractures in the 
arsenopyrite and in quarts alone it is generally ©oars© and crystalline and 
pyrite cubes are not uncommon. (Fig. 15). 

Limonit© occurs as irregular masses in quarts, pyrite and arseno¬ 
pyrite, in cracks and fissures in quarts, pyrite and arsenopyrite, and along 
grain boundaries of pyrite and arsenopyrite, (Fig. 15) It is chiefly a 
decomposition product of the sulfides. 

Pyrrhotite (?) occurs as mry small inclusions in pyrite and 
arsenopyrite. 

Native gold occurs most commonly in stringers and fractures in 
the arsenopyrite and when this mod© of occurrence is noticed, it is very often 
associated with quarts and pyrite (Figs. 28,29). A good percentage of the 
gold also is found free in the quarts (Figs. 21,23,28). It occurs generally 






















• : C 











coarse with -150 mesh probably being th® smallest. Considerable coarse 
gold occurs in arsenopyrit© and in pyrite with stringers of quartz leading 
out from it (Figs, 15,20,23,24). A small percentage of gold occurs as 
small minute particles (3 microns) entirely encased by arsenopyrit© (Figs. 

17,18,19). 

Faragenesis of Ore 

The data available at this time are probably not sufficient to de¬ 
termine conclusively th© paragenesis, nevertheless a tentative outline ©f the 
succession of deposition may b© given. 

(1) Arsenopyrit© with minute particles of gold completely encased in it. 

(2) Pyrite, quartz and gold. 

This second period of mineralisation appears to have been the ©m 
in which most of the ooarse free gold was precipitated. The gold not only 
crystallised out in th© quarts and pyrite, but as th© or© bearing solutions 
entered the cracks and fissures in the arsenopyrit© this sulfide acted as 
the precipitant, causing the deposition of free gold. 

(3) Limonite and Pyrrhotit© (f) 

Summary and Conclusions 

Th® important features of the ©re as observed microscopically may 

be summarized as follows? 

(1) Most of th© gold occurs coarse in cracks in arsenopyrit®. 

(2) Considerable coarse free gold is also found in quartz. 

(3) A minor amount of gold is found in pyrite, 

(4) A small amount of gold, occurring as very fine particles is found 
completely surrounded by arsenopyrit©. 

(5) Both pyrite and arsenopyrit© are coarsely crystalline. 

These facts indicate that: 

(1) Comparatively coarse grinding should liberate most of th© sulfides from 
the gangues and also liberate most of the gold from the sulfides and quartz, 








' 














(39 


(2) Recovery of the gold by amalgamation on the whole should be compara¬ 
tively high. 

(3) Recovery of the gold by ©yanidation should b© comparatively high. 

(4) Recovery of the gold by flotation should be lower than that by the 
other two methods because of the coarse free gold which would b® difficult 

to float. 

(5) Th© fine gold completely encased by the arsenopyrite could not be liber¬ 
ated even by excessive grinding* and therefor® could only be recovered by 
flotation with arsenopyrite. 




GRINDING TESTS 


Grinding or fin© grinding is essentially the eommunition ©f 
material of on© inch particle si z ©, or smaller, down to an impalpable powder, 
or to such particle sis© that the valuable minerals are completely liberated 
from the gangue minerals« It is the last crushing operation prior to treat¬ 
ment by amalgamation, gravity concentration, flotation or cyan!dation. 
Grinding may be don© wet or dry, and the degree of grinding varies depending 
upon the nature of the or© and the amount of reduction required. 

In practice, ball and tube mills are used which consist essentially 
of rotating cylinders with flat or conical ends, balls, pebbles or rods 
as grinding media* The Hadsell mill is a more recent development. It 
consists of a large wheal up to 24 feat in diameter by 4J- feet wide fitted 
with internal buckets. The ©re is crushed by its own impact on stationary 
plates within the mill* 

Practical grinding equipment is not easily duplicated in the 
laboratory. The Wenig laboratory ball mill is the on© generally used for 

testing purposes. 

Grinding tests are mad© on the or© to determines 

(1) The relative ease of grinding of the ore. 

The mining industry still is in need of a universally approved 
method of determining a ** gr indab ility factor** bo that ores may be compared 
as to their relative amenability t© eommunition. However, Goghill 9 ® (23) 
graphical methods are a step in this direction.

(5) The sulfide mineral distribution in the various screen sizes, or, 
in other words, the crushability of the sulfides. 

Grinding tests were carried out in a Wenig laboratory ball mill, 
using 1500 gras, of or© and 7000 gms. of X w to l n steel balls. A number of 
batches from the same feed were taken and ground dry for varying lengths 
of time. Following each grinding test the batch was carefully sampled and 
a screen analysis made using Tyler standard sieves. No attempt was mad© to 
measure the power input to the mill, as it was felt that the results would 
be difficult to correlate with those in practice and therefore be of little 
practical significance. 

Table No. 6 shows screen analyses of products of various ores for 
different times of grinding. Graph Nos. 1 and Z show Goghill diagrams of each 
grind and gold and sulfide distribution in various screen sizes. Xafel© No, 7 
shows average assays of ores used and assays of various screen sizes, and 
table No, 8 gives chemical analyses of ores and the products of the various 
screen sizes. 

Summary and Gonelusions 

Microscopic examination of polished sections mad© on 20, 35, 65, 
and 100 mesh screenings showed that in the 20 and 35 mesh screenings some 
sulfides were still not liberated from the quartz or gangue. 

In the 35 mesh screenings a few gold particles were also observed. 

65 and 100 mash screenings showed complete liberation of the sulfides from 
the gangue, and coarse gold from the sulfides and gangue. 

Assays substantiate the results obtained by microscopic examina¬ 
tion. A greater portion of the gold is coarse, around -55 mesh or coarser, 
as is indicated by the high gold assay of the 65 mesh and the relatively 
high gold assays of the coarser meshes. The comparatively low assays of the 
-200 mesh probably is an indication of the amount of gold intimately associated 
with the sulfides. The high gold content of the screenings coarser than +65 









( 42 . 


indicates one of two things, or both: (1) that all the -Go mesh gold has not 
been liberated from the sulfides and quarts, (2) that much of the gold in the 
ore may be coarser than 65 mesh. 

Chemical analyses show that a high percentage of the sulfides still 
occur in the meshes coarser than 65 mesh, and since 65 mesh gives complete 
liberation of sulfides from quartz, it is evident that some sulfides in the 
coarser meshes could not be recovered by flotation, as sulfides with country 
rock attached to them will not float. There does not seem to be any appre¬ 
ciable higher concentration of sulfides in the finer mesh, which indicates that 
their grindability is on a par with that of the gangue. From the Coghill 
diagrams (graph Ho. 1), it can be seen that there is a gradual increase in 
finer material with increased time of grinding. They do not, however, 
indicate that grinding to 100^ -66 mesh gives a preponderance of fine ©re, 

i.e* -200 mesh. 

From the above observations it is quit© clear that to obtain maximum 
recovery by amalgamation, flotation or cyanidation, grinding to «65 mesh is 

essential.

SETTLEMENT TESTS 


"Settling is the process of concentrating a relatively dilute 
slime pulp into a thick pulp, i.e. on© containing a low percentage of mois¬ 
ture, by rejecting liquid that is substantially solid free." 

Thickening is another name for the same process. The early methods of 
thickening employed flat bottomed tanks into which the pulp was fed until 
the tank was full. The solids were then allowed to settle to the repaired 
pulp density, the top clear liquid was withdrawn, and the settled solids 
were discharged. This w as a batch operation. The advent of the Dorr 
thickener has made continuous dewatering of a dilute pulp possible. In & 
Dorr thickener dilute pulp is slowly added, a thick pulp of uniform density 
is scraped off the bottom of the tank into a central discharge, by slow 
revolving scraper blades, while a clarified solution overflows at the top# 

The sis© of tank required is determined by the rate of settlement 
of the pulp. Taggart gives the following formula for calculating the 
settling areas required per ton of dry feed per 24 hours.

the projected settling tank. 

Settling tests are carried out in a graduated cylinder. They are 

conducted to determines 

(1) The rate of settling of different particle si&es at various 

pulp densities. 

(2) The amount ©f "slime" or colloidal material created by 

grinding. 

(3) The settling area required per ton of feed per 24 hours. 
















Settling tests were conducted on three ores, viz. Baska, Algo Id 
station 6, and Algo Id station 5. Results obtained were so similar that data 
are given only for one series of tests. Results of the tests are shown in 

tables Nos. 9 and 10, and graph No. 5. 

Summary and Conclusions 

The graphs of rate of settlement plotted against ratio of liquids 
to solids maybe considered straight line graphs, except those of the 15 
minute and 30 minute grinds. Straight lino graphs indicate free settling 
which are ideal conditions for rapid settling. Goars© particles of ©re 
settle more easily than fin© particles, and therefor© the graphs of the 15 
and 30 minute grinds do not indicate hindered settling, but rather show that 
settling was so rapid that readings ©ould not b© taken accurately. 

In a few tests, data of which are not given in the tables, lime was 
added. This increased the rate of settling. 

There was little evidence ©f M slimlng w , or colloidal suspension, 
in the liquid above the settling pulp. A mere cloudiness could be observed 
in the finer grinds and the addition of lime to the pulp helped to clarify 
this# 

Settling areas were computed for the different grinds, and various 
dilutions for each grind. These settling areas are not very significant in 
the design of settling tanks, as results obtained by using the Taggart formula 
do not ©heck very closely with those in actual practice. These computed areas, 
however, are useful as comparisons between different grinds and pulp dilutions. 
They show that the thicker the pulp and the coarser the grind, within the 
limits of the tests, the smaller the settling area required.

AMALGAMATION TESTS 


About 95% of the gold in the world occurs in the native state, and 
since clean, free gold can be recovered by amalgamation, this method of 
recovery cannot be too highly emphasized. Losses in the treatment by amal¬ 
gamation are mechanical and may be reduced to an insignificant minimum. The 
gold is recovered in its original purity without admixture with baser metals 
used in precipitation processes. The cost of amalgamation is low and the 
initial expense of equipment trifling when comparison is made with other 
processes* The technique is simple, the fundamental principles of practice 
are easily defined and the operation calls for no particular skilled labor, 
no expert technical supervision or fine adjustment. Supplies needed are 
few in number and of regular standard. Special equipment is used rarelyj 
patented practice is almost unknown. Yet in recent years, with the advent 
of newer methods of gold recovery, such as flotation and cyanidation, oppor¬ 
tunities have been overlooked for the profitable application of amalgamation 
for the treatment of small daily tonnages. 

Recovery of gold by amalgamation for ores where arsenic or antimony 
is present generally presents special problems. The presence of antimony, 
arsenic or soluble sulfides has a harmful effect. Antimony or arsenic will 
cause mercury to darken and form base bullion which will slough off the amal¬ 
gam plates and b© lost in the tails® Very little is known about the way in 
which arsenic and mercury combine® A, Descamp (25), however, has shown that 
most of the metals unite with arsenic forming alloys or definite arsenides. 
Mailer (26) states that mercury appears to form amalgams with arsenic, anti¬ 
mony and bismuth, but the evidence in the case of arsenic and antimony is 
not so satisfactory. Undoubtedly arsenic is generally harmful in gold re¬ 
covery by amalgamation and may be expected to give trouble®

The fin© gold, generally known as "float gold” is generally lost 
in the usual methods of amalgamation- Most of this gold is probably in the 
form of fine laminae, flattened grains or scales, and its loss is caused by 
non-contact with the mercury. 

"Rusty gold" is a term designating gold which, though apparently 
free, does not amalgamate. It is known that a thin film of sulphur, oxide 
of iron, silica or grease or other substances may cover the surface of the 
gold particles and prevent amalgamation. 

Fin© gold contained in pyrit© or arsenopyrit© does not readily 
unite with mercury. This gold is generally recovered with the sulfide con¬ 
centrate or leached by cyanidation. 

There &r© numerous ways of applying amalgamation to the flow 
sheet ). The earliest and most common method was to cans® the pulp 
stream to flow over mercury covered copper plates. This method is still 
used if the gold is clean and fairly coarse. Plate amalgamation followed 
by flotation, and vice versa, may be employed where gold occurs free as well 
as associated with sulfides* More recently barrel amalgamation has gained 
prominence. It is a batch operation, and is carried out in cylindrical or 
barrel shaped containers. Barrel amalgamation is particularly suited to 
small tonnages, and concentrates from corduroy blankets, mineral jigs and 
concentrating tables ar© usually treated in this way. Mercury is often 
added to the ball mills, and the gold amalgam formed is later recovered in 
mercury traps. 

Sine© much of the gold in the ©r@s under discussion is comparatively 
coarse and can be easily liberated by coarse grinding, a high percentage of 
the gold should b@ recovered by amalgamation* The following types of 
amalgamation tests were carried outs

(1) Barrel Amalgamation 

The tests were carried out in a standard laboratory jar mill. Th© 
charge to th© jar mill consisted of 200 to 500 gms. of ore, 600 to 1000 gras, 
of water, 1 to 2 gms. of NaQH, 25 to 50 gms. of mercury and a hand full of 
quartz pebbles. The whole was agitated for about Tj=r hours. The charge was 
then removed, the pebbles screened out, and the mercury separated by a 
laboratory counter-current classifier. The tails so obtained wer® filtered* 
dried and assayed. 

(2) Plate Amalgamation 

Richards* method of preparing amalgam plates was used. 

FiT3 copper plates, S n x 12** were colored with mercury amalgam. These plates 
were then placed in a sluice box in step-lik© fashion, with a drop of 3/8** 
from one plate to another. Or® pulp was allowed to flow over the plate in 

th® sluice box. 

(3) Barrel Amalgamation followed by Flotation 

In these tests th© tails from barrel amalgamation were run through 
a standard sub A laboratory flotation machine. Flotation procedure was the 
asm© as shown in tests ©n Flotation reported later. 

Complete data and results obtained are giimn in table No. 4. 
Summary and Conclusions 

The mercury used in th© amalgamation tests on th© ore under dis¬ 
cussion, showed definite signs of being dirty after th® teste were completed. 
A black scum- infrequently appeared on the surface. Dilute nitric acid 
brightened the mercury. A. Bruhl obtained mercurous arsenide, Hg^Asg, 

by th© aotxon of arsine in a solution of a mercurous salt. Th© black precip¬ 
itate, he states, is soluble in nitric acid. It is thus iguit© possible that 
the black scum is Hg^ASg.

In barrel amalgamation, the ore in Test No. 6 was given 10.5 
hours agitation. This test was run to determine how much gold could be 
recov ered by amalgamation, if given a long period of agitation. 94$ was re¬ 
covered, and since microscopic examinations do not reveal any dirty or rusty 
gold, it is quit© possible that this percentage is the total gold liberated, 
the other 6$ representing gold intimately associated with the sulfides. 

All barrel amalgamation tests were very satisfactory and gave high 
recovery, ranging from 88 to 97.4$. 

Plate amalgamation gave a much lower gold recovery. It must be re¬ 
membered, however, that the or© was passed over the plates in the sluice box 
only one© and had more plates been used a higher recovery could have been 
expected. It is safe to say that all the ©oars© gold may be recovered in this 
way, and what gold is left in the tails is that portion intimately associated 
with the sulfides. 

Tails from barrel amalgam were flotated giving a combined overall 

recovery around 98$.

CYAjMIDATION tests 

Daman (29) states: "The principle of dissolving gold and silver 
values in solution of potassium or sodium cyanide is old and has been carried 
out in practice for many years. There have been only a few changes in the 
chemical procedure and also few changes in the type of equipment used, 

"The gold and silver are dissolved by chemical solution, usually 
with varying amounts of oxygen or air added to complete the reaction. The 
amount of air or oxygen required for a particular ore varies and depends not 
only upon the size of the ps-rticl© of the mineral to be dissolved, but also 
upon the chemical composition of the ore. In most instances the value of the 
ore and the size of the mineral particles are the deciding factors • . • 

"The basic principle of adding certain chemicals to counteract un¬ 
favourable chemical constituents in the ore is still necessary on each parti¬ 
cular ore and therefore complete test work is essential to determine the mesh 
of grind; the time required for agitation; the settling ratio of the ore 
and the amounts of chemicals required, together with the correct flow sheet**. 

Cyanidation has a wide application, pearly all gold ores are 
amenable to cyanidation. Some, however, possess characteristics in the 
form of certain minerals, salts, etc. which cause excessive consumption 
of reagents, cause fouling of the solutions and generally increase the 
costs of treatment® Modification or introduction of additional steps, such 
as preliminary roasting, or preliminary acid treatment will usually overcome 
most difficulties, although these steps are always more or less costly® In 
some cases mechanical concentration or flotation will yield a concentrate 
suitable for smelting operations and the precious metal will be more economi¬ 
cally recovered in that fashion® Or the concentrates will form a much less 
bulk of material for these costly intermediate steps, and thus reduce the

total over-all costs. 

The chief obstacles to cyanidation are substances known, as cyani- 
oides, which consume cyanide and foul the solutions. The commonest cyani- 
cides are soluble salts from the decomposition of the ore, e.g. sulfides, 
sulphates, arsenates, iron and copper salts, free acid and carbonaceous 
material. Most sulfides of the metals in the presence of water and air are 
more or less oxidized and decomposed with the production of free acid and 
acid salts. Thus pyrite (FeSg) decomposes to form ferrous and ferric sul¬ 
phates and sulphuric acid: - 

5F©§2 + 2 HgO + 220 « FeS0 4 + F© 2 (S0 4 ) s ♦ 2 HgS^ 

The sulphate salts will tend to precipitate gold with the formation of 
Ferro and Ferri cyanides and all will be consumers of cyanide. Lime is 
generally used to neutralize the acid. 

Sodium cyanide is generally used in the cyanide process, and sine© 
the cost of this chemical is about 25 cents per pound, it is essential to 
keep the cyanide consumption to a ndnimmru Any or© treated by cyanidation 
should not consume more than 1.0 pounds or, at the most, 1.5 pounds NaOn 
per ton of ore. 

In practice leaching or dissolving of precioiis metals in an ore 
by cyanide solution is accomplished by agitation in tall wood stove con¬ 
structions and by pneumatic, mechanical, or combination of pneumatic and 
mechanical devices. The air used for agitation also aerates the pulp and 
thus gives the necessary oxygen for solution of the precious metals. 

Practical equipment cannot be duplicated easily in the laboratory. 
However, results obtained in test work check very closely in most cases with 
those in practice, 

Cyanidation tests are generally carried out in 1 litre to 2 litre 
winchesters. The initial charge to the winchesters usually consists of

200 to 500 grams of ore, 600 to 1500 grams of known cyanide solution, 2 to 
6 grams of lime* The winchesters are then placed in some rotating device 
which will give the required agitation. Prom time to time small amounts of 
clear solution are withdrawn and titrated for cyanide and lime consumption. 

The time of agitation may vary from 7 to 72 hours. 

Cyanide tests are carried out to determine: 

(1) Cyanide consumption 

(2) Lim© consumption 

(3) Percentage recovery of precious metals. 

The cyanide tests made on the ores under consideration were carried 
out in a 1 litre winchester, to which were added 200 grams of ore, lime, and 
600 cc. of cyanide solution. The winchester bottles were placed in & lab¬ 
oratory ball mill frame and rotated by a small electric motor. Cyanide 
consumption was determined at the end of ©n© pro agitation, and ©very three 
hours thereafter. Lime consumption did not increase after 2 hours agitation. 

The ores of the Baska, Algold Station 5 and station 6, showed a 
steady increase in cyanide consumption, varying from 1.5 pounds to 2.5 pounds 
per ton in the first hour, from about 5 pounds to 5 pounds per ton in 3 
hours, etc. 

In tests 14 and 15 the or© was first agitated for 10.5 hours with 
lime. The idea here being to oxidise, if possible, some of the arsenopyrite 
and thereby decrease the cyanide consumption. Sodium cyanide was then added 
and after 7 hours agitation it was found that cyanide consumption ceased and 

remained at 8.1 pounds per ton. 

Detailed data and results of cyanide tests are given in table No. 12. 
Summary and Conclusio ns 

Recovery by cyanidation is very high ranging from 95$ to 98.9$. 
However, the high cyanide consumption (3.88 and 14.38 lbs. per ton) makes 
this method of gold recovery uneconomical. 







c 




< 
















■ • • 













Pro -aeration and agitation with lime had no effect on cyanide 
consumption. Roasting no doubt would reduce the cyanide consumption, and 
probably would be good practice to follow if it could b© done cheaply.

FLOTATION TESTS 


"During the last five years rapid strides hair© been made in 
the ore-dressing metallurgy of gold ores. Theretofore, amalgamation and 
cy&nidation were the two chief processes employed in the treatment of 
precious-metal ores, but with the marked development of flotation and 
flotation reagents in the last few years, this comparatively new innovation 
of ore-dressing has become a third and a popular method of treatment in 
the beneficiation of refractory.and non-refractory previous-metal ores. 
Although the flotation process alone has proved to be an important method, 
it has its greatest application when used in conjunction with amalgamation, 
cyanid&tion, or both. For example, research (end practice) has definitely 
demonstrated the fact that coarse free gold (plus 48 mesh) is not easily 
floated, and consequently when this condition exists, amalgamation (or jigs, 
or gold traps and blankets followed by amalgamation of these products) is 
the natural procedure to follow for the recovery of coarse gold, followed by 
flotation to recover the fin© gold that may b® free ©r looked in the sulfide 
content of the ore. Again, the gold in an or® may be finely associated with 
sulfide minerals, preventing recovery by amalgamation (for example, a pyritio 
gold ore), but with the use of flotation a concentrate may be produced that 
can either be shipped to the smelter, or treated by cyanidation, resulting 
in a satisfactory recovery of the values, thus eliminating the higher cost 
of a cyanide plant for the total mill tonnage, and also the cost of smelting 
charges and similar items. Many other examples, such as flotation of cyanide 
tailings, can be given, shovdng the various combinations of the three pro¬ 
cesses mentioned in the foregoing, that ar© being used today in mills 
throughout the world, but the cases cited serve to point out briefly the 
application of flotation in the present-day metallurgy of gold ores •** 




< • 


. 








Amalgamation and cyan!dation ar© relatively easy tests to carry 
out on a given ore. The characteristics of an or© that male© it amenable to 
amalgamation or cyanidation are not hard to determine. In general the vari¬ 
ables are few in number. This, however, is not try® in the case of concen¬ 
tration and recovery by flotation, numerous varieties of activators, 
promoters and frothers are manufactured today. The various combinations of 
these reagents that may be used in one test are many. pH control, fineness 
of grinding, pulp density, and water purification ar© some of the other 
factors that must be considered. Certain flotation reagents and flotation 
circuit conditions have proved successful in the treatment of many ©resj 
nevertheless, every or© still presents a problem in itself and requires 
additional research. 

To get a start in so complex a scheme the best thing to d© is* 

(1) To s ©arch the literature for information on reagents and 
methods used on similar or©. 

(2) To not© the particular qualities of each reagent. 

Then from the above information, together with that obtained from 
the ore to be tested, a preliminary method can be adopted, which may b© 
gradually changed as the tests continue. 

The general procedure adopted in the flotation tests varied very 
little from test to test. The or© was ground dry and then dumped with water 
into the Denver w 'Sub A ** flotation machine. Conditioner and activators were 
add©d, and agitated for about 10 minutes without aeration. 4 fr other was 
added next, air admitted and the froth removed for 8 to 10 minutes. 

Concentrates and tails were filtered, dried and assayed. 

Reagents used are given below with amounts used in tests shown in 
table No. 13. 

Creosote (Coal Tar) produces tough froth and has strong collecting 


property. Cost 7^© - 9@ per pound

Sodium Xanthate - a standard collector, is very extensively used. 

Cost .13^ per pound. 

Butyl Xanthate - eonsidered a good collector for gold. Cost .22/ 

per pound. 

Sodiim C a r bonate - used for obtaining alkalinity. Cost .03/ per

Pine Oil - steam distilled variety, is very extensively used on 
account of frothing properties and uniformity. Cost ,08^ per pound. 

Reagent 2Q8 - is the most effective promoter for "free* * 1 2 3 4 gold. Cost 
.24zj?/ per pound. 

Aerofloat No. 51 - is an effective promoter, which, when combined 
with Reagent 208, will float "free" gold and gold in intimate association with 
sulfides. Cost .20 - *27^/ per pound. 

Lime - is extensively used for obtaining alkalinity. Its avail- 
ability and low cost are factors in its favor. Cost .01-g^ per pound. 

Detailed data on flotation tests are given in table No. 14. 

Summary and Conclusions 

She results obtained by flotation tests may be summarized as follows? 

(1) Percentage gold recovered by flotation varies from 67.7% t© 94.4^. 

(2) Percentage gold recovered by flotation is lower if or© is not ground 
to 90% -65 mesh. This is clearly indicated by T@st 15 min.. Algo Id Station 5* 

(3) Finer grinding than -65 mesh does not seem to affect the percentage 
of gold recovered. 

(4) The ratio of concentration is generally low. 

These facts indicate that gold recovery by flotation is erratic, 
and - generally low, and therefore is sn unsound method to use alone •

CONCENTRATION BY CORDUROY 


No tests were made to determine how much gold could be recovered 
by corduroy treatment. The American Cyanamid Company has investigated many 

/ 3 "} \ 

grades of corduroy and compiled data on corduroy concentration. ' They 
state that practice has shown that it is difficult to duplicate corduroy 
practice in the laboratory because of the small amount of ore that is 
generally used. However, it is reasonable to assume that much of the gold 
in the ore under discussion could be recovered in this way. Much of the 
gold is coarse and coarse grinding (-65 mesh) liberates the sulfides and 
gold from the gangne. These are factors which favor corduroy concentration. 







GENERAL SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 


Microscopic examination of the ore under discussion shows that 
most of the gold is coarse and free, and that only a small percentage, 

2 to 5%, is fine (3 to 5 microns) occurring in, and completely surrounded 
by, arsenopyrite • Grinding to 100% minus 65 mesh liberates all the coarse 
gold from the sulfides and gangue, and also frees the sulfides from the 
gangue. CoghilPs diagrams (graph 1) show that grinding to 100% minus 65 
mesh does not give a preponderance of fines (minus 200 mesh). The ore is 
free settling with a minimum amount of slime or colloidal suspension. A 
high gold recovery (over 90%) can be obtained by barrel amalgamation, and 
by plate amalgamation followed by flotation. In all amalgamation tests the 
mercury showed signs of contamination or fouling. Recovery of gold by 
cyan!dation is high (over 92%) with a high cyanide consumption (4 to 14- 
lbs. per ton). Gold recovery by flotation is erratic varying from 70% to 
90%. Much of the coarse gold could, no doubt, b© caught on corduroy blankets. 

The above facts indicate a simple flow sheet with no serious prob¬ 
lems. Because of the relatively easy lxberat5.cn of gold and sulfides from 
gangue, no elaborate crushing equipment nor excessive grinding is necessary. 
Rapid settling of the or© means settling tanks of small cross section area, 
and a minimum, outlay for filtering equipment. A simple flow sheet based 
primarily on amalgamation and corduroy blanket concentration could well be 
the basis of any mill design.

PART III 


FLOW SHEET DESIGN, MINING METHODS FOR FUTURE 
DEVELOPMENT, ESTIMATED COSTS, AND FINAL 
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 


FLOW SHEET DESIGN 


Introduction 

From the results of investigations, reported in Parts I and II 
of this thesis, a tentative flow sheet has been outlined which could be 
used as a basis for mill design. Amalgamation and corduroy treatment have 
been chosen in preferance to cyanidation or flotation for the following 
reasons; 

(1) Gold recovery by amalgamation is comparatively high. 

(2) Because of the coarse nature of the gold it is assumed much 
could be caught on corduroy blankets. 

(3) Gold recovery by cyanidation, thogh higher than by amalgamation, 
is unprofitable because of high cyanide consumption. 

Cyanide consumption could be reduced, no doubt, by roasting and 

leaching before cyanidation. However, the scarcity of fuel in the Sucker 

Bay area, and the high cost of transporting fuel from Edmonton precludes 

these methods of pretreatment. 

(4) Gold recovery by flotation is erratic and generally lower than 
by amalgamation. Furthermore, concentrates obtained would have 
to be shipped to smelters, or be specially treated by roasting, 
cyanidation, etc., all of which make this an unprofitable method. 

(o) As has been reported elsewhere in this thesis, amalgamation and 

corduroy treatment are simpler to operate, cheaper to install, and 
more especially adapted to milling of small tonnages than either of 
the other two methods.

Sinee investigations as outlined in Part I tend to indicate a small 
tonnage proposition, amalgamation and corduroy concentration would be there¬ 
fore more suitable. 

Plow Sheet 

The flow sheet is die.granimatica 1 ly illustrated on page 61, and may 
be more fully discussed as follows: 

The ore from the mine goes to a coarse ore bin^^, and from here 
passes owr a grizzly (2) with 5 tt openings. This 5 W product is then fed 
to a jaw crusher (3) (blake type) where it is crushed to iff’ size. A Symons 
cone crusher (4) reduces this further to ^ size, which then goes to the fin© 
ore bin (6). Prom the fine or© bins, the feed is passed to a ball mill (6) 
which grinds to between 48 - 65 mesh. At the discharge end of the ball mill 
a 20 mesh screen (7) catches any oversize, and this oversize is passed to the 
classifier (11). The underflow passes over a corduroy blanket (8) where 
coarse gold and sulfides collect. The concentrates are stores in a concen¬ 
trate bin (16). The overflow from, the corduroy pass over amalgam plates (9) 
where more of the gold is caught by the amalgam. The mercury that comes off 
the plates during operation is caught in mercury traps (10) • Some gold also 
collects here. The overflow from the plates is pumped to the classifier (11) 
which is in closed circuit with the ball mill. Plus 65 mesh product or sands 
are returned by the classifier to the ball mill. The overflow (-65 mesh)

retort (18). The mercury recovery is used again to dress plates, etc. and 
the gold is melted, cast into bars and shipped to the mint. 

The function of the 20 mesh screen is to catch any of the very 
coarse material, which if allowed to go over the corduroy, would cause 
excessive wear. Furthermore, the gold would not be liberated from the 
gangue and sulfides in the coarse material and therefore would not amal¬ 
gamate . 

Since arsenic causes fouling of mercury, the corduroy has been 
placed ahead of the amalgam plates. In this way much of the sulfides are 
caught on the blankets and prevented from passing over the mercury plates. 

Any mercury that sloughs off the amalgam plates is caught in the 


mercury traps

METHODS AND COSTS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT 


Methods and costs for future development are shown below. It is 
thought they will serve some useful purpose to anyone working in the Sucker 
Bay area. Since the Algold shear zone as a result of work to date shows the 
most promise of possible development into a mineable project, it has been 
used as the specific example on which to base estimates. Quotations are on 
new equipment, lumber, etc. Prices were kindly submitted by the Gardner- 
Denver Company Limited, Canadian Ingersoll Rand Company Limited, and the 
Dorr Company Limited, and obtained from catalogues and published literature. 
The following figures are estimates costs of materials as delivered at 
Sucker Bay* 

Sinking and Drifting (Machines )- Estimated costs of a 6* by 8* shaft, 200 

feet deep sunk at station 6, Algold Claims, with a shaft station and 400

COST OF MILL CONSTRUCTION 


Parsons gives the following data on mill construction and 

operating costs: 

( *CQ3t of M i H Construction 

"The cost of a small mill will range all the way from $600.00 to 
over |2,000.00 per ton of ore treated per day, depending on factors such as 
location, new or second-hand machinery installed, the size of the unit, and 
the type of plant. 

M A few examples will illustrate the actual costs of small mills: 

(1) H A 75-ton mill situated in Quebec, using traps and blankets 

only, cost $573.00 per ton capacity per 24 hours. 

(2) W A 25-ton cyanide plant in Ontario, using a ball-^aill and 

one stage of filtration, cost $1,300.00 per ton. 

(3) l *A 50-ton cyanide mill in Ontario, using single-stage grinding 

and single-stage filtration, cost $1,300.00 per ton. Later, to 
obtain recovery, a tube-mill was added and the tonnage was only 
increased to 60 tons. In this case, the crushers, ball-mill, 
filters, and m&iy accessories were rebuilt second-hand equipment. 

(4) tt A 50-ton cyanide plant in Quebec, using single-stage grinding, 

two stages of filtration , and with tankage and precipitation 
capacity for 100 tons, cost $1,100.00 per ton. Practically the 
whole of the equipment was rebuilt second-hand machinery. 

(5) ,! A 50-ton straight cyanide mill in British Gjolumbia cost $1,230.00 

per ton. This mill now treats 75 tons without lowering recovery. 
The cost on this latter basis is only $820.00 per ton, but not® 
should be taken of the fact' that the or© is easy t© crush and 
that the gold is readily soluble. 

Operating Costs 

! *The direct cost of operating a small min© and mill is high, and 
moreover this cost, if the operations are directed from a head office at 
a distant point, can easily be increased 30 to 40 per cent by the addition 

of overhead charges. 

"Costs at different properties vary widely, as they depend on many 
factors, such as the width of ore mined, the amount of development work 











required, the size of the operations, etc. Labour will represent owr 
60 per cent of the total direct cost. 

tt The cost of operation also varies with th© tonnage of ore being 
treated daily, and to illustrate this the actual figures obtained by a 
mining company are givens 

»At 48 tons per day, the cost of mining and milling was $9.60j at 
69 tons, |8.37; and at 61 tons, $8.05. Indirect charges amounted to 
$2.20, $1.90, and $1.84 per ton, respectively, making totals of $11.90, 

$10.27, and $9.89. ®&x©s are not included. 

^The actual operating costs of four mines, all with 50-ton mills, 
give an average figure of $10.20 per ton. 

**It happens that the lowest cost of th© four is obtained at the 
property where the mill consists of a simple blanket plate. This low cost, 
however, is not due to the type of mill but to th© fact that wide ore- 
bodies are mined. 

11 In fact, there is very little difference in the operating costs 
of these four properties, but if fixed charges are included, the costs at 
the mines ©quipped with cyanide plants are the highest. 

“Figures on the cost of operating with a 25-ton mill were not avail¬ 
able, but it is estimated that the direct operating cost would be about 
$13 .00 per ton. To this would have to be added other overhead charges before 
the grade of or© that would b© mined profitably could b© determined.

Based on the above figures it can b© assumed that a mill designed 
and. constructed on the basis of the flow sheet previously given would cost 
anywhere from $600.00 to $1000*CO per ton capacity per 24 hours. 4 50-ton. 
mill located in the Sucker Bay Area would cost to construct in the neighbor¬ 
hood ©f $40,000.00 to $50,000.00. Cost of flotation and cyanidation mills 
would be higher. 




( 71 . 


FINAL SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 

The guoker Bay area located at the east end of Lake At hah a ska 
is easily accessible in simmer by the combined rail and water route, and for 
most of the year by aeroplane. The summer season is short, but the winters 
are not unduly severe» Timber for mining purposes is scarce in the area, 
but may b© obtained at reasonable prices from the mills around MaoMurray. 

Food supplies, machinery, etc, must be obtained in Edmonton, Freight rates 
are not excessive. There are thus no definite physical handicaps to 
mining in the region. 

General geological conditions ©f the Sucker Bay area appear 
favorable, and show that gold bearing solutions have been aotiv© over a 
large area within the region. Mineralization carrying gold is found in 
many separate localities. 

On the Algold claims, a shear zone can be traced for over 1000 
feet. A limited amount of trenching and sampling ©n this shear exposed 
350 feet, averaging S J 4 U in width and carrying gold values of about 0.20 
os. troy per ton of rock. Narrow widths over short lengths on the 
Standard and Baska claims carry gold values from 2,0 to 6.0 oz. troy per ton. 

It is reasonable to expect that in some of tbs shear zones large 
enough deposits will be found to be successfully exploited. 

Investigations on gold recovery from the ore of the Sucker Bay 
area show that most of the gold occurs ©oars© and fine in the sulfides and 
gangue. It can b© easily liberated by coarse grinding. Gold recovery 
by amalgamation and cyar&dation is high; by flotation, generally low and 
erratic. Cyanide consumption, however is high, and this method of recovery 
would not be economical. 

A simple flow sheet based on amalgamation and corduroy coneentra-

tion has been outlined in this thesis, and is recommended as suitable in 
the milling of the ore. Cost of a mill designed on the basis of the 
flovr sheet would b© from. $600*00 to $1000*00 per ton of or© mined per 24 

hours * 

The expenditure required to bring a property in the Sucker Bay- 
area into production with an output of about 30 to 50 tons per day, 
including preliminary prospecting, min© de-folopnent and mill construction 
may be estimated at from $125,000*00 to $150,000*00,
