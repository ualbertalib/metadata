SYNOPSIS 


The ever increasing demand for access by- 
ground approaoh into Canada!s north country and 
hitherto nearly inaccessible areas has made it 
essential that studies be carried out to increase 
the knowledge of the engineering properties of organic 
terrains, generally termed as muskeg 0 

This thesis is such a study, conducted by the 
author, under the direction of Dean R. M. Hardy of 
the Faculty of Engineering, University of Alberta. 

The study consists of two parts. First is the 
development of a Vane Shear Test Apparatus employing 
the use of a Torque-wrench. Second is the collection 
of data on the measurement of in-situ sheer strengths 
of different types of muskeg and its presentation 
showing the relationships between shearing strengths, 
depth, moisture content, ash content and angular 
deformation. 

The Field Tests were conducted in the Pmbina 
Oil Fields which include large areas of different types 
of muskeg as classified by N. W. Radforth in his, 

M Suggested Classification of Muskeg for Engineers." 
(Bib #1.) 

The results show that the maximum shearing 
strengths range from 115 to 850 pounds per square foot, 
that the shearing strengths increase, directly with 
depth, ash content and angular deformation and vary 
inversely with moisture content* The study shows that 
the Vane Shear Test Apparatus meets its design 
requirements•

INTRODUCTION 

Although organic terrain or muskeg has 
many undesirable properties, the available 
strength of such terrains must be taken into 
account in the economic study of the construc¬ 
tion of roads both permanent and short term 
in such areas. 

This need has been brought about by the 
rapid increase in development in such terrain 
by the Department of National Defence, the Pulp 
and Paper Industries, the Oil Industry and the 
large Ore Development Programs. These expan¬ 
sions, necessitating the construction of roads 
and railways are concurrent across Canada* 

The specific problems studied in this 
report are those of determining the Shearing 
Strengths of organic terrains by means of a 
Vane Shear Tester and corelating the strengths 
to depth, muskeg classification, moisture 
content, ash content, angular deformation and 
to determine the Liquid, Plastic and Shrinkage 
Limits obtained by laboratory tests. 

The preliminary study involved the pro¬ 
duction of a Vane Tester using a Torque-wrench 
to apply the required torque. The Vane Tester 
was to be designed so that it was portable by

a crew of two or three men yet sufficiently 
strong to endure the wear and usages of 
field tests. 

The area chosen for the field work 
was the Pembina Oil Fields, an area of 
approximately one thousand square miles, 
the northeast corner of which is located 
sixty-five miles west and twenty-five miles 
south of Edmonton, Alberta. It is estimated, 
by the Oil Companies in this area, that about 
thirty percent of this large tract is muskeg. 

It is of interest to note some of the 
difficulties that arose and delays that occur¬ 
red during the field tests. These were the 
existence of ice conditions in the muskeg until 
the end of June, and the time required to 
become familiar with the Oil Companies Expan¬ 
sion Programs. Numerous delays were caused 
by roads made impassible from inclement 
weather. The trial testing of the Vane Shear 
Test Apparatus was delayed until the last of 
June pending the arrival of the required 
torque-wrenches from the factory.

THEORY, D£VEL,QB/LSNT AND DESCRIPTION 

OF THE VANE TESTER APPARATUS 

Essentially the Vane Test consists of 

pushing a vane, usually four bladed, into the 

ground and measuring the torque required to 

rotate the vane and thus shear a cylinder of 

soil. On rotation the vanes revolve a total 

cylindrical area equal to 

2 ffr ( h f r ) 

where h - length of vane 

r = radius from centre line of shaft 

The resisting moment to the torque applied 

is developed by the shearing strength of the soil 

acting on the revolved area of the vane. This 

can be stated as, 

T a S x A x m 

where T s Torque applied 

S = Shearing strength of soil 

A a revolved area of vane 

m z moment arm. = radius of cylinder rev¬ 
olved. 

Thus the necessary equation to compute the 
Shearing Strength of the soil from the torque 
applied may be stated as, 

T s S x A x r .. Equation 1 

In order to make the vane penetrate to the 
required depth it is necessary to auger down to 
the desired depth less one half the length of the

vane. Due to this, the area on which the shear 
strength acts is the cylindrical wall area plus 
one end area. 

Expressing Equation 1 in terms of radius and 
length of vane, 

T « s ( 2ffr x h x r *f nr 2 x 2 r ) 

3 


or 

T = 2irr 2 x S ( hfr ) . 

3 


where 

T = torque in foot-pounds 



S « shearing strength in pounds per square 

foot 

r a radius in feet 
h a length of vane in feet* 

To facilitate computations the height and radius 
of the vane were chosen such that the Shear Strength 
would be some whole integer times the torque applied. 
The radius of the vane was limited by the diameter of 
the portable field auger. After numerous trial comp¬ 
utations the dimensions of the vane chosen were, 
diameter 4*5 inches and length 10.1 inches. Using a 
vane of these dimensions resulted in the shear strength 
being equal to the torque applied multiplied by five. 
Appendix number 1, page 70, shows the computations of 
Vane size. 

From previous records of the shearing strengths 
of muskeg in Western Canada it was noted that in some 
instances strengths of over 1600 pounds per square 
foot were recorded. To ensure that the apparatus being 
developed would encompass such strengths, the torque

wrenches used had a range from zero to three hundred 
foot-pounds and could he used with an extension arm 
so designed that the actual torque applied was equal 
to two times the torque reading on the wrench. The 
manufacturers of the wrenches used, specified that 
the wrenches should not he stressed beyond eighty 
percent of their scale reading, which set a limit of 
two hundred and forty foot-pounds on a wrench. This 
meant that the extension arm would have to he used 
if shearing strengths of more than twelve hundred 
pounds per square foot were encountered. 

To eliminate friction between the vane shaft 
and the soil being tested, the drill stem used as the 
shaft was enclosed in a thin wall casing of sufficient 
inside diameter to clear the drill stem couplings. 

The drill stem turned through a hearing at the bottom 
of the casing which was two inches above the top of 
the vane. Plans of the Tan© Tester designed are 
presented on Plates 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18, pages 64 
to 68, of this report. 

The Vane Tester Apparatus designed and used in 
the Field Tests consists of: 

2 - 300 torque wrenches with 3/4 drive head 
1 - extension arm, multiplication factor of 2 
1 - Vane assembly, diameter 4.5 tf , length 10.1 M , 
complete with thrust bearing and casing, 
overall length 2t-0 ff to centre of vanes.

Tiie V a ne Test Apparatus produced is a modi¬ 
fied version of the Vane Tester developed by 
Captain S. Thomson which is described in his Thesis, 
Bibliography 2. 

The primary modifications made to the Thomson 
apparatus are as follows; 

In the Walsh-Wyld apparatus torque is applied 
directly to the vane shaft by means of a Torque- 
wrench from which the applied torque can be read* 

In the Thomson model torque was applied by means of 
tensioning a steel wire, by winding on a hand rat¬ 
chet, through a mechanical system including a spring 
anchored pulley and the wire being wound around a 
20 inch diameter disn which was clamped by set 
screws to the vane shaft* To determine the torque 
applied involved the computation of the extension 
of the spring anchoring the pulley and then reading 
the applied torque and the shearing strength from a 
graph giving the relationship between these* The 
Walsh-Wyld apparatus is so designed that the shear¬ 
ing strength is equal to five times the torque read¬ 
ing. 

The physical differences betwen the two models 
is most apparent by a study of the plans included 
in this report and in Thomson’s thesis*

FIStD TES TS 

The field tests were conducted in the 
Pembina Oil Fields and with the exception of one 
site were all carried out within the leaseholds 
of Mobil Oil of Canada. A photographic copy of the 
site plan showing the test areas is included in 
this report as Plate No. 19, Page 69 . 

Trial Tests to establish procedure and to 
correct any flaws in the apparatus were conducted 
in Block 5 as this was the earliest accessible 
area. 

It was found during the trial tests that it 
was not possible to push the vane through the sur¬ 
face mat due to its very fibrous and rooty nature. 

It became standard procedure to remove the top three 
or four inches of the mat and to take the initial 
reading for each test hole at a depth of one foot. 
The next reading was taken at a depth of two feet 
and consequent readings taken at two foot intervals 
to the bottom of the muskeg* 

All holes were augered to such a depth that 
when the vane was inserted, the centre of the vane 
was at the required depth and the top of the vane 
was one inch below the bottom of the augered hole. 

Torque was applied to the vane at a steady 
rate of approximately thirty degrees per minute. 

This rate of deformation was adopted after trial 





-9 


tests showed that if torque was applied by hand 
at a slower rate its application became uneven and 
jerky. In order to maintain some consistency the 
torque was applied by the same person for all read¬ 
ings. 

At any given location, tests were run to 
give data on virgin muskeg, muskeg affected by 
drainage and muskeg consolidating under the well 
site pads which were constructed for drilling oper¬ 
ations. To ensure that fairly representative data 
were obtained three tests were run for each condi¬ 
tion of muskeg at each site. Many test holes had 
to be abandoned because logs, large roots or bould¬ 
ers were encountered during augering. 

Throughout the program difficulty was ex¬ 
perienced in obtaining good samples for testing in 
the laboratory. Augering greatly disturbed the 
material and the removal and inserting of the auger 
caused a large amount of sloughing from the sides of 
the hole. To keep the samples as representative as 
possible they were taken from the bottom portion of 
the load in the auger. All attempts to obtain good 
Shelby Tube samples were failures and samples re¬ 
tained were greatly disturbed. The use of three and 
one half inch diameter tubes still resulted in very 
compressed samples with a large reduction in water 
content. For three feet of muskeg in-situ the

the samples obtained were about eleven inches in 
length. The samples retained were kept by Mr. I. C. 
MacFarlane for laboratory investigation at National 
Research Council, the results of which will not be 
available before the summer of 1957* 

Muskeg Classification was done by the method 
as described by Dr. N. W. Radforth in his paper, 
n Suggested Classification of M us & e S for the Sngi&- 
eer. H This system is based on the classification 
of the living organic material at or on the surface 
of the terrain under consideration. This living 
organic material, known as coverage, is the first 
thing noticed as an observer enters the muskeg area. 
No knowledge of the species of plants is necessary 
to classify by this method. The Classification is 
done by recognition of the physical aspects of the 
growth including such things as, the woody or non- 
woody characteristics, the approximate height of 
growth, whether the growth is young, old or dwarfed, 
if the coverage is of tree or scrub form or grass 
like, or if growth is in patches, mats or hummocks. 

A table, giving the summary of properties 
designating nine pure coverage classes, is presented 
as Appendix Number 2, Page 71, to this report. 

Vane Tests were conducted at Well Site No. 
28-8, of Mobil Oil Block 4, as recorded on Data Sheet 
No. 8, Page 35 . These tests were run on virgin mus-

keg. On the information from Mr. j. p. Walsh, 
that the construction pad of clay fill was to he 
built at this site within a few weeks, four 
settlement gauges of the Casagrande pattern were 
installed. These gauges were placed at the sur¬ 
face and bottom of the muskeg and at two inter¬ 
vening levels. Mr. Walsh, of Mobil Oil, kindly 
consented to keep the record of settlement of 
these gauges. 

It is noted that about seventy percent of 
the time when the vane was withdrawn after a test, 
the revolved cylinder of soil adhered to the vane. 
It was noted by the author and Mr. I. C. MaoFarlane 
that the diameter of the cylinder of soil as accu¬ 
rately as could be measured was the same as the 
diameter of the vane.

DISCUSSION 

The discussion is divided into two parts, 

a) Discussion of the Vane Shear Test Apparatus, 

b) Discussion of the results. 

Discussion of the Vane Shear Test Apparatus 

Mechanically the Vane Tester developed and 
used was found very satisfactory. The addition 
of guide bearings at regular intervals, say every 
second casing section, would eliminate the small 
transverse movement of the vane shaft within the 
casing* This could easily be done by use of 
tapered split bronze bushings, machined to fit 
between the vane shaft and the inside of the 
casing couplings* The weight of the tester, esp¬ 
ecially when assembled to a length of ten feet or 
over, made it quite awkward to handle* This could 
be remedied by the use of a smaller diameter high 
strength steel vane shaft and a lightweight metal 
for the casing* This would also reduce the over¬ 
all weight of the tester which was not as easily 
portable as desired. To transport the apparatus 
from the vehicle to the test site required six 
well loaded trips by one man. 

It is worthy of note, that just when the con¬ 
struction of the Vane Tester designed had been 
finished and the test trials and necessary adjust¬ 
ments made, that a commercial Vane Shear Kit was 
put on the market by Acker Drill Company Incor¬ 
porated of Scranton, Pennsylvania.

The Acker kit includes three sizes of vanes, 
two torque wrenches of lj?0 and 600 inch-pounds 
capacities and guide bearing and couplings as 
required. The largest vane in the Acker Kit has 
a diameter of 5*63 inches as compared to the 4*5 
inch diameter vane used in this project. The 
Acker Kit is practically the same as the appara¬ 
tus developed by Mr. P. Walsh of Mobil Oil and 
the author. A summary of the component parts and 
the price list of the Acker Kit is included in 
this report as Appendix Number 3, page 72. 

As a small sized vane was not used during 
any of the field tests, the author does not feel 
qualified to comment on any merits or demerits 
of smaller equipment. It is his opinion however 
that a Tester using small sized vanes would likely 
give comparable results. Smaller apparatus would 
also increase the portability of the equipment and 
greatly reduce the physical effort required during 
the operation of the field tests. 

Discussion of Results 

Perusal of plates numbers 1 to 8, which 
graphically present the correlation of some of 
the engineering properties of muskeg, shows the 
following characteristics.

a) For Muskeg of Radforth Classification DFI 
i Virgin muskeg shows an increase in 

strength with depth varying from 270 to 
390 pounds per square foot and having a 
characteristic decrease in strength just 
below mid-depth with the minimum strength 
recorded at this point* 
ii Muskeg, whioh has been drained for 21 

months, shows an increase in strength with 
depth, ranging from 283 to 473 pounds per 
square foot* The characteristic decrease 
in strength occurs between 0*2 and 0,4 of 
the total depth when the muskeg is on the 
virgin side of the drainage ditch. Where 
the tests were run between the overburden 
and the drainage ditch, the characteristic 
fall-off in strength occurs between 0*4 
and 0*8 of the depth. 

lii The muskeg consolidated under 400 pounds 
per square foot for twenty-one months, 
shows no tendency to increase strength with 
depth, but it shows again the fall-off of 
strength at 0.4 to 0*6 of the depth with a 
minimum of 300 pounds per square foot, the 
maximum strength recorded for this condition 
being 700 pounds per square foot. 

In summary DFI muskeg shows a general increase 
in shearing strength with depth, with a characteristic 
weak zone at 0.4 to 0.6 of the depth with minimum

values of 270 pounds per square foot in virgin 
muskeg to 500 pounds per square foot under con¬ 
solidating conditions. 

Hates, nos.5, 6 and 7, which, present 
graphically the correlations from DFI muskeg, 
between shearing strength, depth and moisture 
and ash contents, show that the Shearing Strength 
increases, 

i with increase in depth 
ii with decrease in moisture content 
iii with increase in ash content. 

Ash content was determined from weight of 
residue after 24 hours at 300°C divided by: 
dry weight of sample after 24 hours at 110°C. 

The plates also indicate an increase in 
Ash content with depth and a decrease in Moisture 
content with depth. The consistency with which 
increase in the shearing strength is accompanied 
with a decrease in moisture content is clearly 
shown by graphs a and b on plate 3. 
b) For muskeg of Radforth Classification BDI♦ 

The following points are clearly depicted 
on plates 2, 3 and 8, which present the correla¬ 
tions of some of the engineering properties of 
BDI muskeg. It is noted at this point that some 
of the Field Data sheets show the classification 
as A to BDI, which is applying the Radforth 
classification beyond its intended degree.

In presenting the data in graph form the author 
has included all A to B DI classes as strictly 
BDI and feels justified in doing so as the A class 
growth tends to overshadow the B class growth in 
visual identification due to its height and more 
noticeable foliage during the summer season. 

i Virgin muskeg shows the shearing strength to 
increase directly with depth. BDI muskeg 
does not show the pronounced characteristic 
of having a zone from 0 A to 0*8 of the depth 
which has a decrease in strength. Rather it 
shows a slight increase in strength through 
this zone and a marked increase in strength 
below this depth* Strengths vary from 175 to 
525 pounds per square foot at one location 
and from 150 to 575 pounds per square foot at 
another location, both being in the same 
large BDI muskeg area. 

ii Muskeg affected by drainage increases in 
shearing strength directly with depth, with 
variations from 525 to 525 pounds per square 
foot from the surface to the bottom of the 
muskeg. Test run on the cleared Flowline 
right of way show strengths froia 115 to 450 
pounds per square foot which are a little 
lower than the strength ranges found in the 
virgin muskeg*

iii The plotted data from both locations show 
a slight decrease in strength with depth 
for BDI muskeg under an overburden of 
about 520 pounds per square foot for a 
period of ten months. One site shows a 
decrease from 550 to 500 pounds per square 

y 

foot from surface to bottom and the second 
location shows a decrease from 600 at the 
surface to 515 at mid-depth increasing to 
550 pounds per square foot at the bottom. 

In summary BDI muskeg, in the virgin and 
affected by drainage states, shows the 
shearing strength increases directly with 
depth, 'vtiile under the overburden existing 
at the site, this type of muskeg shows a 
small decrease in shearing strength with 
increase in depth. 

Plate 8, presenting the relationships bet¬ 
ween shearing strength, depth and ash and moisture 
content for virgin muskeg shows that moisture con¬ 
tent decreases with an increase in shearing strength 
and depth. Ash content with depth remains nearly 
constant except for the bottom few inches of muskeg 
where the ash content shows a sharp increase. The 
data was not comprehensive enough to show any char¬ 
acteristic for shearing strength versus ash content*

Plate 4 shows shearing strength versus 
depth for both ADI and G class virgin muskeg. As 
construction had not been started it was not pos¬ 
sible to obtain further data at the sites. 

The ADI muskeg shows minimum strengths vary¬ 
ing from 273 to 475 pounds per square foot from the 
surface to the bottom. It is at this site that 
settlement gauges previously mentioned have been 
installed. 

Data were obtained for the type 0 muskeg as 
it was the only area encountered where there was 
only a single descriptive type of muskeg. The 
surface mat was extremely tough and axe work was 
required before the vane could be pushed through 
to the one foot depth. After the bottom of the 
muskeg was reached at two and one half feet from 
the surface, augering continued as local lore had 
suggested the depth being somewhere between -‘very 
deep” and 51 hot tomless”. As data sheet number 9 

records clay extended on down to a depth of eleven 
and a half feet, from the surface, at which point 
augering was stopped. Plate 4, graph fb) shows 
that for this type muskeg the shearing strength 
increases directly with depth over the range of 
J550 to 765 pounds per square foot for an increase 
in depth of one foot.

twenty-three disturbed samples are presented 
on Data Sheet No 10, Page 57* 

In an attempt to analyse the plasticity 
characteristics of muskeg, tests to determine 
the Atterberg Limits were conducted on nine 
disturbed samples. Data Sheets numbers 11 to 19, 
pages 6l to 69 ,record the test data and computa¬ 
tions, A summary of the results is compiled as 
Data Sheet number 21, page 48. A study of this 
summary leads to the following discussion. 

The increases and decreases in the Liquid 
Limit parrallel the natural moisture content and 
the highest values of moisture content and liquid 
limit occur at the lowest ash contents. 

The Plastic Limits determined are in all 
but two cases higher than the liquid limits. In 
the two cases where the liquid limit is greater 
than the plastic limit the samples have a high 
ash content. Prom the tests run it is noted 
that when the ash content is ever 30% the plas¬ 
ticity index can be computed. At an ash 
content of 31 % the liquid and plastic limits are 
nearly equal giving a plasticity index of zero. 
Time did not permit but it might prove interest¬ 
ing to make a further study to see if 33 % to 40% 
ash content is a limit below which the plasticity 
index can not be computed. 

In performing the tests difficulties were

found in running the plastic and shrinkage limits. 
Due to the very fibrous organic nature of the 
samples the water content had to be very high in 
order to roll the soil into threads of approxi¬ 
mately one-eighth inch in diameter. The few 
results obtained are plotted on the Plasticity 
Chart presented as Plate no. 9, page 59 . The 
determination of the shrinkage limits was not 
continued throughout all the tests as measure¬ 
ment of the volume of the dry pats could not be 
done accurately. 

During the field tests the total angular 
deformations for all torques were recorded on the 
applicable field data sheets. These angular de¬ 
formations included the twist of the drill stem 
as well as the deformation of the soil. In order 
to know the deformation of the soil only, it was 
necessary to determine the amounts of twist in 
the drill stem for variations in lengths and 
applied torques. 

By securing the blades of the vane in a 
vise and measuring the angular twist in the drill 
stem for applied torques of forty, eighty, one 
hundred and twenty and one hundred and sixty foot 
pounds the data as presented on Data Sheet no 20, 
page 47 , were obtained. These data are presented 
graphically on Plate 13, page 63 .

in the soil are shewn on Computation Sheets nos 1 
and 2, pages 49 and 50 , which are self-explanatory. 
For these computations the twist in the drill stems 
was determined from the graphs on Plate 15. 

A brief discussion on the Theoretical Compu¬ 
tations of twist in the drill stem is presented 
as Appendix no 4, page 73, to this study. 

Plate no 10, page 60, shows the Angular 
Deformation versus Depth for DFI Muskeg in the 
three states of virgin, drained and drained and 
consolidated under a load of approximately 400 
pounds per square foot for twenty-one months. In 
general there appears to be a decrease in angular 
deformation with increase in depth down to the six 
foot depth. The data presented are not conclusive* 

Plate no 11, page 6l, presents similar data 
for BDI Muskeg. Again there appears to be a de¬ 
crease in angular deformation with increase in depth 
down to the six foot depth. BDI muskeg shows a 
tendancy to increase in angular deformation between 
the six and eight foot depth zone. This may be due 
to the higher mineral content near the bottom of the 
muskeg. 

From the data presented on Plates 10 and 11 
both the DFI and BDI muskegs show a tendancy to 
decrease in angular deformation with an increase 
in depth. 






- 24 - 


Plate no. 12 graphically presents maximum 
Shear strength versus Angular Deformation for BDI 
and DPI muskegs. The data presented is not con¬ 
clusive but show that both types tend to increase 
in shear strength with an increase in angular de¬ 
formation as shewn by the sloped dashed lines. 

The slope of the lines as shewn indicate that BDI 
muskeg would increase about 7*5 psf and DPI mus¬ 
keg about 8.5 psf per degree increase in angular 
deformation. 

Prom a study of the Pield Data Sheets and 
Computation Sheets it is seen that there is a 
definite difference in shear strengths for each 
state in which the muskeg was studied. Por DPI 
Muskeg, as shewn on Computation Sheet No. 1, in 
the virgin state the average shear strength 
varies from 270 to 450 pounds per square foot. 

In the drained state the values varied from 500 
to 650 psf and in the consolidated and drained 
state the shear strength varied from 625 to 850 
psf. This indicates that DPI muskeg, under a 
consolidation load of approximately 400 psf for 
twenty-one months doubled in strength compared 
to the virgin state. The drained state shows 
a marked increase in strength compared to the 
virgin state. 

The strengths recorded for the various 


states of BDI muskeg are from 150 to 500 psf for

the virgin state, from 325 to 650 for the drained 
state and from 400 to 700 psf for the consolidated 
state. Comparing the low values of shear strength 
obtained for each state shows that BDI muskeg 
drained gave twice the strength of virgin muskeg 
and that BDI consolidated shows nearly three times 
the strength of virgin muskeg. This type of mus¬ 
keg was consolidated under a load of approximately 
320 psf for ten months. 

I, C M class muskeg in the virgin state gave 
shear strengths from 550 to 7&5 psf* No consoli¬ 
dation or drainage had taken place in this tract 
of muskeg. The high strength in this vrigin state 
is likely due partially to the root growth extend¬ 
ing throughout the total depth of the muskeg which 
was just two and three quarter feet* Fine hair 
roots were encountered five feet below the bottom 
of the muskeg in a grey-blue sandy clay. 

CONCLUSIONS 

The vane 3hear test apparatus, designed for 
and used in the collection of data for this study, 
met the design requirements * 

The maximum shear strengths for the types 
of muskeg tested varied over a wide range, from 
115 to 85O psf, but indicate that the shear 
strength in muskeg is increased by drainage and 
when under consolidation* The shear strengths of

muskeg were found to vary directly with the depth, 
inversely with moisture content and appeared to 
vary directly with angular deformation and ash 
content. 

The shear strengths of muskegs determined 
in this study are in agreement with those deter¬ 
mined by Capt. S. Thomson, as presented in his 
Thesis on the same subject and with the values 
obtained by C. F. Ripley and Associates from 
investigations carried out in the Campbell River 
area on Vancouver Island* The following tables 
show the comparison of the values obtained from 
the three different sources*

the engineering properties of muskeg* 

A vane tester of similar design but of 
smaller dimensions and made of light weight 
materials will greatly reduce the work required 
in the field and will make the tester more port¬ 
able • The Acker Vane Shear Test Kit, mentioned 
previously is suggested as a standard kit for 
such further investigations, 

A suggested alteration to the Vane tester 
used by the author, to enable the application of 
torque at any desired rate is as follows. 

Axially fix the Torque wrench on to a cogged 
wheel of radius equal to the length of the 
Torque wrench and motivate the assembly by means 
of a hand operated worm screw* 

Continued investigation is required to 
broaden and substantiate any conclusions indic¬ 
ated by this report. Such investigations should 
be conducted over divers and well dispersed mus¬ 
keg areas. All data should be centrally col¬ 
lected thus allowing the best interpretation, 
and corelation of properties and classification.

COMPUTATION OF VANS SIZE 


In computing the size of the vane the 
following points are to be considered. 

a) Shearing strength = Torque applied X 5 

b) The ratio of height to diameter to be 
2 or more* 

o) Area upon v/hioh the shearing strength 
acts is side area plus one end area® 


From Equation No. 2 

T = S X 2Hr 2 ( h + r/5 ) 
and as S * ^ T 
1 = 10 ffr 2 ( h + r/5 ) 

Trial # 1, 

letting r = 0.25 feet then, h = 0.425 
h/D = 0.85 

Trial # 2. 

letting r = 2 1/4 " then h = 10.1 " 
h/D = 2.25 

USB VjiNE TOTH Diameter = 4.5 " and Height 

10.1 "

APPENDIX NO. 4. ' 

THEORETICAL CALCULATIONS OF ANGULAR TWIST IN DRILL STMS . 
From the theory of torsion, 



where 9 = twist in radians per unit length 
M t = torque 

G- r Modulus of Rigidity 



To express twist as degrees per foot of length 
using torque in foot-pounds and assuming G = 12 x 10^ psi, 
this equation becomes, 

r<xdtkr\<> / 

9 (d egr ees/foot) = Mt (foot-pounds) 

144(12 x 10 6 ) x n i £ z 1_ 

52 8 4 (12) 

which reduces to, 

0 s 0o046 (M^) foc>f. 

The following table is produced using this formula.

in graphical form on page IS 




















-O'or 





75 


Comparison to the values obtained by 
measurement of the angular twist in the drill 
stem is shewn by the dashed lines. 

The discrepancies are due to, 

a. assumptions in theory of torsion 

b. assuming G as 12 x 10^ psi 

c. the theoretical values do not take 
into account the enlarged cross-sectional areas 
at all couplings of the drill stem, vihich 
occurred at the 2, 6 and 10 foot lengths and 
gave a total length of drill stem with increased 
cross-sectional area of about 27 inches in a ten 
foot length. 

Due to these discrepancies, corrections 
for angular deformation were taken from the 
graph as shewn on plate no. 13 page which 

is plotted from direct measurements.
