An abstract of 

An Examination of Some Factors Associated 
with the Decline of the Coal Industry in 
Alberta 


by Harry Douglas Trace 


Alberta coal deposits were formed from vegetation 
which grew around ancient seas which covered and receded from 
the land a number of times during the Cretaceous era. Mountain 
building activity of the Cenozoic era, besides maturing a belt 
of coal parallel to the mountains, folded and faulted the seams. 
These events set cost limitations to Alberta coal mining, of 
varying, dipping and faulted seams. Alberta’s reserves of 
mineable coal amount to 46 million tons, or 48% of Canada’s 
reserves of mineable coal. 

Commercial mining commenced in Alberta in 1886, and 
grew with the advance of the railroads. The industrial depress¬ 
ion of the thirties, which adversely influenced the industry, 
was followed by peak demands of the World War II period. 
Employment in the industry, besides being influenced by these 
major forces, was beset by problems of distance from markets 
and seasonal fluctuations, which resulted in low income for 
miners and poor working conditions. 

The decline of the industry resulted from the 
competitive pressure from newly discovered fossil fuels, and

to soma extent, the growth of hydro-electric power. The problem 
of transportation costs was also a factor in the decline, having 
prevented Alberta coal from winning the major market for coal 
in Central Canada. 

With the decline of the industry after 1949, conditions 
became critical for the miners and their communities. The situa¬ 
tion for bituminous miners was severe because the mines were 
located away from the settled areas of the province. Seasonal 
fluctuations were more pronounced in the sub-bituminous mines 
and the miners were conditioned to finding alternative employ¬ 
ment. The decline of the industry, meant to many miners the 
learning of new trades, the abandonment of their homes, and 
transportation to new areas where employment was available. 

Federal government aid to the industry has been limited 
to subventions designed to equate the cost of transportation to 
that of imported coal at the market. During the World War II 
period additional measures were adopted to encourage production 
to meet war needs. Provincial government activity has been 
directed to regulation of the industry. When the plight of the 
miners became critical, provincial aid was extended to aid the 
miners' rehabilitation. 

Federal government policy has been formulated on the 

dictates of national security. A source of fuel to supplement 
American imports was vital to an expanding economy. Subventions 
enabled the maintenance of nominal fuel prices while encouraging 
the development of domestic sources. Provincial government

policy was directed to creating conditions conducive to a 
healthy industry. With the discovery of alternative fossil 
fuels, the coal industry was allowed to find its own competitive 
level of operation. 

Federal government policy, while directed to develop¬ 
ing an alternative source of coal, failed to create an atmo¬ 
sphere of stability necessary for a stable industry. With the 
discovery of alternative fuel sources in Canada, maintenance 
of subventions are difficult to explain. Long run forecasts 
of world energy needs seems to indicate a future for coal 
after 1970. The creation of a coal board analogeous to the 
Canadian Wheat Board might enable the coal industry to con¬ 
tribute beneficially to the Canadian economy.

INTRO DUCTION 


Probably no industry has been examined and probed 
with greater care in an effort to understand and cure its 
problems, than the coal industry. Concern for the welfare 
of the coal industry stems in part from the belief that 
our present material civilization depends on coal. Despite 
the close attention given to the industry’s growing pains, 
the Alberta coal industry matured and reached a state of 
suspension, without fulfilling the expectations of many of 
its pioneers. 

It is the purpose of this thesis to survey the 
historical background of the Alberta coal resources and 
industry and to determine when and how the decline of the 
industry resulted. A great deal has been written about the 
coal industry of Alberta; consequently in the field of 
exploration and historical background, only a sketch of 
the highlights will be attempted. The major emphasis of this 
thesis will be placed on the decline of the industry, and 
the problems associated with the decline, together with 
the factors which might be said to be responsible.

Chapter 1 

COAL RESOURCES IN ALBERTA 

The story of Alberta coal commences between 40 and 
90 million years ago during the Cretaceous period of geological 
time. Alberta coals are geologically much younger than those 
of the Maritime Provinces, which were laid down during the 
Carboniferous period between 200 and 240 million years ago. 

The oldest coal formations of Alberta are from the Lower 
Cretaceous period and were deposited between 75 and 90 million 
years ago. 

The coals of the Lower Cretaceous period in Alberta 
occur in two formations which are referred to as the Blairmore 
and Kootenay formations. These deposits are found in a belt 
extending from the Crowsnest area along the foothills, north¬ 
west to the Smoky River area and contain Alberta’s most 
important deposits of bituminous coal. 

The next deposits of coal in terms of age, occur in 
the Upper Cretaceous period and were laid down between 40 and 
55 million years ago. The coals of the Upper Cretaceous age 
occur in two general formations, which are referred to as the 
Belly River and Edmonton formations. These deposits underlie 
a large part of the southern part of the province and outcrop 
along the outer foothills from Pincher Creek to Prairie Creek. 
The deposits of the Upper Cretaceous also extend over much of 
the central plains area.

Distribution of the Cretaceous formations has been 
determined by geological forces which culminated in the Rocky 
Mountains and the uplift of the continent to the east. As a 
result of these forces a structural basin exists in Alberta 
with its centre at Rocky Mountain House. Its axis extends 
from the international boundary south of Macleod, northwesterly 
closely paralleling the trend of the foothills. The youngest 
formations occur in the centre of the basin and progressively 
older formations occur in the outer rims of the basin. Figure 1 
shows the distribution of the coal-bearing formations in Alberta, 
and illustrates what has been outlined about the structural 
basin and age distribution of the formations. 

Coal may be defined as plant or vegetable matter, 
which over long periods of time has been subjected to physical 
and chemical changes. In very brief terms, it is composed of 
moisture, fixed carbon, volatile matter and ash, the proportions 
of which vary with the degree of maturity of the coal. The 
two chief factors which determine the maturity of the coal are 
age and pressure. Generally, the older the coal, the more 
mature or harder it is compared to younger coal. 

In Alberta, the coals laid down in the Lower Cretaceous 
are more mature than those of the Upper Cretaceous. Pressure, 
however, also operates to mature the coal. The mountain-building 
period of the Cenozoic faulted and folded the strata containing 
the coal deposits, and consequently the maturity of Alberta

coal increases from east to west, or from the plains to the 
mountains. As Alberta coals have been laid down at different 
times and under varying conditions, classification does pre¬ 
sent some problems to the statistician. It was not until 
1939 that some attempt was made to find a uniform system of 
coal classification for Canada, at which time the American 
Society for Testing Materials - Specification D388-58 was 
proposed. Table 1 outlines three classifications which have 
been used and indicates their relationship to each other. 
Figure 2 indicates the location of Alberta coal, grouped 
according to the method outlined in Table 1. It will be 
observed that this map reflects what has been said about the 
influences of age and pressures. The maturity of Alberta 
coal does not conform with its geological age. Coal of the 
same geological age has a higher maturity when located close 
to mountain stresses. 

According to estimates of mineable coal made in 
1946, Alberta has some 48 per cent of Canada’s reserves, with 
Saskatchewan possessing about 24 per cent, British Columbia, 
some 19 per cent, the Yukon and Northwest Territories, nearly 
5 per cent, Nova Scotia, a little over 3 per cent and the other 
three provinces having, in aggregate, about one-third of 1 per 
cent. 1 Estimates of Alberta coal resources make a clear 
distinction between two terms: coal resources which include

all known coal deposits based on the extent of coal bearing 
formations wi thout consideration of its mineability and coal 
reserves which represents the quantity of coal that may be 
mined at present or in the future. Coal reserves are then 
necessarily smaller than coal resources. Table 2 sets forth 
the estimated coal reserves of Alberta by group, area, and 
tonnage, and is based on seams three feet or over, within 1000 
feet of the surface. According to this criterion an area of 
1, 974 square miles is underlain by 46,562 million short tons 
of coal.

The geological forces which uplifted, submerged, 
folded and faulted the land which was to become Alberta were 
very generous in their creation of coal. It has been shown 
that coal was deposited in two general areas, with bituminous 
coal parallel to the mountains in the west, and sub-bituminous 
coal underlying most of the plains. The geological story 
closes with the retreat of the last glacial age, about 15,000 
B.C. The final touches of nature’s architect were completed, 
and the stage was set for human drama. This brief sketch 
of Alberta coal resources indicates an exciting aspect of the 
coal story which, at first thought might appear to be an 
unattractive, slightly grimy episode.

Chapter II 

HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT 

Commercial mining of Alberta coal had its beginning 
in 1883 in the Medicine Hat area, followed by Lethbridge in 1886, 
Canmore in 1888 and Edmonton in 1891. Production of coal in 
Alberta was sparked by railroad construction for its own use 
and also from the markets which it made available. The develop¬ 
ment of metallurgical plants in British Columbia gave a further 
stimulus to the mining of Alberta coal* Production of coal 
in Alberta rose from 43,220 tons in 1886 to 8,826,311 tons in 
1946, after which a decline began and by 1956 production had 
fallen to 4,854,838 tons. The development of the industry has 
been characterized by fluctuations of output over the years and 
these have been the subject of a number of governmental enquiries. 
The graph reproduced on page 12, indicates the production of 
Alberta coal between the years 1886 to 1956 in total, and for 
bituminous and sub-bituminous coal* 

In its examination of conditions in the industry, the 
report of the Alberta Coal Commission in 1925 declares that 
over-development of the industry had resulted in low earnings 
for workers, loss of capital invested, high costs and loss of 
markets. It was reported that by 31st. December 1924, 1,051 

mines had been opened, 674 had been abandoned and 68 were 
temporarily closed, leaving only 309 in operation. 1 The

problems of the industry were the subject of a federal enquiry, 

culminating in the Report of the Royal Commission on Coal in 
2 

1946. As frequent reference will be made to this report, as 
a matter of convenience, an abbreviated caption, The Carroll 
Commission 1946 will be used. At the time of this report, it 
was said the principal difficulty of operators and men alike 
was the achievement of a relatively stable level of operations. 
Up to that time, the industry had been characterized by severe 
fluctuations through peaks and depressions. The instability of 
the industry can be seen from Table 3, which sets forth the 
number of mines in operation in the province between the years 
1907 and 1954.

An analysis of consumption of Alberta coal over the 
years points up the importance and development of markets in 
Canada. This analysis has been graphed on page 15, where it 
will be observed that the railroads have been the most import¬ 
ant consumer of Alberta coal. The influence of the depression 
and the drop in railroad activity can be seen between 1927 and 
1932. From this date until 1941 consumption recovered falter- 
ingly until 1949, followed by a decline up to 1956 when consump¬ 
tion fell below the 1926 level. The development of the domestic 
market was influenced by the depression, but its development 
progressed up to 1950 when a noticeable decline followed until 
1956. Saskatchewan and Manitoba markets have followed similar 
patterns and have registered a general decline from 1947 to 
1956. The British Columbia market has become increasingly 
important and has registered an increase in consumption from 
1939 to 1956. The Ontario and U.S. markets have not represented 
a significant market for Alberta coal. 

The ownership of coal resources in Alberta was the 
subject of an enquiry in 1925, when a survey was made by Dr. J. 

A. Allan by means of a questionnaire. His findings were part 

of a submission made in the Report of the Alberta Goal Commission 
2 

1925. Control for purposes of this enquiry was defined as

Employment in the coal fields of Alberta has been 
dominated by severe fluctuations in demand which reflects the 
seasonal nature of the industry and the close link between 
agricultural crops and freight activity. The Report of the 
Alberta Coal Commission 1925 notes, that the peak production 
of the bituminous mines falls between May and August, while 
production of Lignite comes between October and February. The 
main problem of employment in the coal industry was the need 
for steady markets which would enable proper scheduling of 


production.

Table 6, indicates the number of shifts worked by sample 
mines between the years 1931 and 1944 and does show the 
extent of under-employment in the industry. It will be noted 
in 1944, that over 53% of the miners in the "Alberta domestic 
coal fields" had worked less than 200 shifts, compared to 27% 
in western steam coal fields. The decline in markets for 
Alberta coal has added to the difficulties of employment in 
the industry. The graph on page 19, gives a picture of the 
employment situation, indicating the number of persons employed 
in the Alberta coal industry, the per capita wage and the coal 
yield per person employed between the years 1906 and 1956.

Some measure of the importance of the Alberta coal 
industry may be obtained by comparing the value of its output 
to the value of total mineral production in the Province, In 
1951, when the coal industry was relatively strong, the value 
of coal production represented 24.4$ of the value of Alberta’s 
total mineral output. In the same year, Alberta’s total pro¬ 
duction amounted to $1,059,383,938.00, of which coal production 
represented 4$. However, by 1953, these percentages in the 
same order had fallen to 12.9$ and 2.8$. In 1951 salaries 
and wages in Alberta amounted to $534 million, of which those 
of the co&l industry amounted to $21 million or 4$. In 1953 
salaries and wages in Alberta amounted to $674 million, of 
which the coal industry constituted $16.8 million, or 2.5$ of 
the total. 


When Alberta’s coal production is compared with 
Canada as a whole, it is found that in 1951 Canada produced 
18,586,823 tons, of which Alberta produced 7,659,412 tons or 
41.3$. In 1953, however, Canada produced 14,913,579 tons, 
of which Alberta produced 4,859,049 or 32.6$. 

The history of the Alberta coal industry from its 
beginning 1883, except for the World War I and II periods, 
has been plagued by seasonal fluctuations, compounded by short¬ 
ages of accessible markets and overproduction. The bituminous 
coal market was characterized by one large consumer while 
the sub-bituminous coal market had a large number of small 
consumers. Employment in the industry had reached a peak in

1921 only to fall with the industrial depression. This slump 
was ended by the second World War, only to enter a period of 
decline after 1948. 

The importance of the Alberta coal industry can be 
measured in terms of the employment and income it generates 
within the province. Its importance in this role is reflected 
in the number of commissions which have been appointed to 
investigate its problems. Control of resources was not given 
to the Province until 1930, at which time 15,765,479 acres of 
coal land had been alienated, without reserving royalty rights. 
The rise of a competitive industry such as oil and natural 
gas was likely to influence the importance of the coal industry.

Chapter III 

DECLINE OF THE INDUSTRY 

Although Alberta was blessed with an abundance of 
coal, there were factors which operated to lessen any advant¬ 
ages given by nature. Cretaceous coals in Alberta originated 
from relatively small types of vegetation which grew along shore 
lines of ancient seas. These shore lines were subjected to 
rapid changes and so Cretaceous coal seams are less regular in 
occurrence than Carboniferous coal. Folding and faulting in 
the mountain areas makes Alberta coal more difficult to mine. 
These conditions make coal more costly to mine and place cost 
limitations on the area of markets Alberta coal may command, 
before competition from American coal mined under less costly 
conditions, becomes too severe. Two factors then, put limita¬ 
tions on the development of the Alberta coal industry from the 
start, the nature of the seams leads to a high cost of produc¬ 
tion and Alberta is located a long distance from markets. 

With the passing of time, competition from new sources of energy 
for the existing markets has been responsible for the present 
decline of the industry. 

The Report of the Alberta Coal Commission in 1925, 
made an examination of the competition facing the Alberta coal 
industry. Competition from U.jg. Coal, operating under more 
favourable conditions, placed severe limitations on the Ontario 
and Manitoba markets. At that time hydro-electric power was

proving to be a source of competition and had made serious 
in-roads into the coal markets of the province. Natural gas 
had also become well established in Edmonton and Calgary and 
the surrounding areas. In the words of the commissioners, 

"While the history of all gas fields is that they play out in 
time, there is nothing to indicate to the coal men of this 
province any immediate relief from this form of competition." 
Oil received a brief mention but its threat to the railroad 
market was noted. "Fresh discoveries of oil might at any time 
increase the competition from this source." 1 

The Carroll Commission 1946, noted that 75$ of the 

province’s steam coal was supplied to the Canadian National 

and the Canadian Pacific Railroads, and that the problem of the 

industry at that time was one of evening out production in order 

to maintain steady employment. Domestic coal, however, was 

faced with different market conditions. Instead of two large 

consumers, it had a great number of small consumers. It did 

have one factor in common with steam coal, however; both were 

tied to the fluctuations of an agricultural economy. It was 

recognized that the domestic coals were facing increasing 

competition at that time from hydro-electric power, natural 
2 

gas and oil.

As the railroads have been the largest consumers 
of Alberta coal, it is proposed to examine all the factors 
which might account for the decline in this market from 
3,012,425 tons in 1949 to 385,388 tons in 1956. The Alberta 
Coal Commission of 1925, reported that variations in consump¬ 
tion by the railroads at that time could be partly accounted 
for by variations in traffic. Table 7 gives the freight 
movements in and out of Alberta and the total Alberta coal sales 
to the railroads for the period 1949 to 1954. Although there 
was some decline in freight movements, other factors must be 
sought to account for the decline in consumption indicated.

officials of one railroad stated that in the past ten years in 
the freight service, there had been a decrease of 20% in fuel 

3 

consumption per 1,000 gross ton miles." The Carroll Commis¬ 
sion 1946, reviewed the question of operating efficiency and 
its influence on coal consumption, and it was reported by the 
Canadian National Railway, that had efficiency remained at 
the 1923 level, the railways would have required in 1944, two 
million more tons of coal than waa actually consumed in that 

4 

year. Table 8 indicates the change in coal consumption 
for the Canadian National and Canadian Pacific railroads, 
between the years 1925 and 1945.

The Carroll Commission 1946, also examined the 
future trend of operating efficiency as a factor in future 
coal consumption. The age of locomotives in use on Canadian 
railroads was examined and the result of their findings is 
given in Table 9. From the age of equipment in use, it was 
expected that opportunity for fuel economy existed and further 

5 

savings of fuel might be expected.

The use of oil as a factor in accounting for the 
decline of consumption of coal by the railroads, was examined 
by the Royal Commission referred to above, and they noted at 
that time, diesel locomotives were offering keen competition 
to steam locomotives for both road and switching service. 

Diesel engines had a lower maintenance cost and a higher avail¬ 
ability factor, besides requiring no water, and consuming no 
fuel when idle. They concluded, however, that at that time 
steam locomotives were considered more desirable than diesel

locomotives for use in road service under Canadian conditions. 

This was a result of the higher capital cost of diesel locomotives 
and the need for maximum utilization to keep interest charges 
per unit mile at their lowest. The Commissioners were of the 
opinion that schedules in Canada do not permit maximum utiliza¬ 
tion. The use of diesel locomotives in Canada has been limited 
to the switching field where they have proved more efficient than 

steam locomotives and their use for that purpose is being 
6 

extended. 

The transition from coal burning to oil burning and 
diesel locomotives for both road and switching has continued 
and it would appear from the figures reported in Table 10, that 
it is likely to continue in the future. In 1954 the Canadian 
National Railway reported that it had received 100 new diesel 
locomotives and the Canadian Pacific Railway reported that it 
had placed orders for 44 new diesel locomotives in the same year.

The future railroad market for Alberta coal does 

not appear too bright. The reserves of oil in Western Canada 

have increased from an estimated 418 trillion B.T.U.’s in 1946, 

7 

to an estimated 17,000 trillion B.T.U’s in 1956. At the 

present time there does not appear to be any reason why the 

conversion to oil by the railroads should not continue. The 

report on Alberta f s Economic Prospects has this observation, 

however, on the future of the railroad fuel market: 

In view of recent American experience in relating 
to the economics of diesel-operated railroads, 
there are some reasons for thinking that coal 
may recapture a substantial share of the railway- 
fuel market. Such a development would in fact 
become a distinct probability if current work on 
coal-fired gas turbines is successfully completed. 

Next to the railroad market, Alberta’s provincial 
market is the most important outlet for Alberta coal. Con¬ 
sumption of coal in Alberta has fallen from a peak in 1918 of 
3,440,154 tons to 898,175 tons in 1956, or a fall of 74%. The 
Report of the Alberta Coal Commission, 1925, in discussing 
competition to Alberta coal, placed hydro-electric power as 
its chief competitor, followed by gas and oil. A report of 
the Dominion Fuel Board is cited as estimating the coal equiva¬ 
lent of water power as about 9 tons per year per horsepower 
at the turbines. Table 11 gives some idea of the growth 
in power capacity from hydro-electric installations for the

years 1900 to 1955. The increase of hydro-electric power 
capacity between 1920 and 1955 was 250,888 horsepower and 
would be the coal equivalent of approximately 2,257,992 tons. 
This does not mean that hydro-electric power has displaced 
this equivalent amount of coal, for cheap hydro-electric power 
creates its own market through industrial growth, besides 
acquiring markets previously filled by coal.

Competition from natural gas has been recognized as 
early as 1925. The Report of the Alberta Coal Commission, 1925, 
estimated that the consumption of gas in the province in 1925 
was 6,000 mil. cu. ft., which was estimated to be equivalent 

9 

to 375,000 tons of coal. The Carroll Commission 1946,

reported that in 1944, the consumption of natural gas in 
Alberta was approximately 35,000,000 m.c.f., which was estimated 
to be the equivalent of 1,350,000 tons of 13,000 b.t.u.*s coal. 
By 1954 this figure had increased to 107,173,777 m.c.f., or 
a coal equivalent on the same basis as above, of 4,122,068 
tons. 10 The same reservations made about hydro-power, also 
apply to natural gas. The production of natural gas creates 
some of its own market, so it does not replace coal in ratio to 
its growth. There is no doubt, however, that natural gas has 
substantially influenced the market for Alberta coal. Table 12 
illustrates the growth in natural gas production for the years 
1931 to 1953.

In view of the available reserves of natural gas 

there does not appear to be any immediate relief to the coal 

industry from the competitive pressure of this fuel. The 

report on Alberta’s Economic Prospects had this to say, 

however, about the future of natural gas and oil competition to 

the coal industry: 

A perhaps equally extensive market is likely to 
offer itself by industry other than power-generation* 
par ticularily if coal’s competitive position in 
relation to petroleum and natural gas improves 
as a result of changes in the price structure 

currently obtaining among fossil fuels. The 

present trend of markets for Alberta coal is down¬ 
ward and it seems likely that this will continue 
until such times as oil and natural gas are sold 
at realistic prices for industrial heating and 
power generation or until new markets for coal are 
developed through minehead power generation, ^ 

liquification, gasification or chemical utilization.

Saskatchewan coal production has been a source 
of competition for Alberta coal, in both the Saskatchewan 
market and the Manitoba market. The production of Saskat¬ 
chewan coal has increased from 1,322,763 tons in 1941 to 
2,116,740 tons in 1954. The Carroll Commission 1946, had 
this to say about the coal industry in Saskatchewan, "There 
has been a remarkable growth in Saskatchewan production in 
recent years, achieved through an effective campaign to educ¬ 
ate potential consumers in the technique of using lignite 
12 

coals.” Table 15 indicates Saskatchewan coal production

Besides meeting competition from provincially mined 


coal in Saskatchewan, other fuels are exerting increasing 
pressure on the markets previously open to coal. Table 16 
indicates the sale of petroleum products from Alberta to 
Saskatchewan. It will be noted that the sales of petroleum 
products to that market have grown from 125,277,991 gals, in 
1939, to 565,360,248 gals, in 1953. Although some sales are 
in response to new markets, some do represent displacement of 
coal markets. 

Competition from hydro-electric power in Saskatchewan 
is not a large factor because only two hydraulic stations 
are in operation, while almost all electricity output is fuel- 
generated. However, competition for this market comes from 


Saskatchewan coal and petroleum products

The British Columbia coal market has not been an 

important outlet for Alberta coal in the past, although its 

importance has grown in comparison to other markets. In 1936 

sales amounted to 244,928 tons and by 1956, they amounted to 

860,329 tons. Table 17 indicates total sales of Alberta coal 

in the British Columbia market. Competition for the British 

Columbia market has come in the past from British Columbia coal, 

wood fuel, hydro-electric power and petroleum products. It 

was reported by the Carroll Commission 1946, that in 1937 and 

1943, coal, hydro-electric power and petroleum were approximately 

equal as energy sources. The commission also stressed the 

13 

importance of wood as a source of energy.

Production of coal in British Columbia under impetus 
of wartime conditions climbed from 1,489,171 tons in 1936 to 
a peak of 2,168,541 tons in 1942. From this point production 
has declined slowly to a level of 1,299,510 tons in 1954. 

This represents a fall of 40$, compared to a 14$ decline of 
Alberta coal sales to British Columbia, for the same period. 

The largest competitor of coal for the fuel market 
in British Columbia is hydro-electric power. In 1900, British 
Columbia had hydraulic turbine horsepower of 9,366 H.P., and, 
by 1955, this had grown to 2,271,460 H.P. Table 18 gives 
the electric energy generated in central electric stations in 
British Columbia between the years 1949 to 1953. Some measure 
of the growth in use of electrical energy can be seen from 


this table.

Wood has been a very important source of fuel in 
British Columbia, especially in the use of mill -waste in the 
form of sawdust and hogged fuel. The supply of this fuel is 
necessarily linked with the operations of the mills. Statistics 
on wood-fuel consumption are difficult to obtain. However, the 
1941 housing census reports that 75$ of the occupied dwellings 
in the province were heated principally by wood fuel and 6$ by 
fuel oil. The Carroll Commission 1946, referring to the 
prospects of coal replacing wood fuel in the industrial market 
of British Columbia, was of the opinion that the use by industry 
of wood fuel in the post-war period might be expected to decline 

somewhat, but the market opened was more likely to be filled 
14 

by oil than coal. 

The impact of natural gas from Alberta to British 
Columbia is as yet difficult to assess, but it seems likely 
to add to competition for the domestic and industrial markets 
formerly filled by wood and coal. The development of natural 
gas wells in British Columbia and the marketing of their fuel 
oil, seems likely to further diminish the market for coal in 
the future. 

Historically the Manitoba market for Alberta’s coal 
has not been great. In 1925, when the question was considered 
by the Alberta Coal Commission, American and Saskatchewan coal

were the chief competitors. Coal shipments from Alberta 

to Manitoba amounted to 249,549 tons in 1917 and had risen to 

509,655 tons in 1925. By 1946 shipments had reached a peak 

of 658,733 tons. At the time of the Carroll Commission 1946, 

two new competitors for the coal market were water-power and 

16 

petroleum products. From the peak of 656,733 tons in 1946, 

shipments of Alberta coal to Manitoba have declined to 304,918 
tons in 1956. 

The progress of coal’s chief competitors in Manitoba 
are set forth in Table 20. It will be observed that hydro¬ 
electric capacity has risen from 1,000 h.p., in 1900, to 
796,900 h.p., in 1955. Power generated in Manitoba has risen 
from 83 mil., k.w.h., to 272 mil., k.w.h., in 1953. The sales 
of Alberta petroleum products indicate an increasing pressure 
on the energy market. In 1939, these sales amounted to 
4,916,067 gals., and by 1953 had risen to 215,414,636 gals. 

The Ontario market has not been an important market 
for Alberta coal. It was, however, a goal which many planners 
hoped to acquire for Alberta coal. Shipments started in 1919, 
of 595 tons, and had risen to 28,831 tons by 1925. At that 
time the chief difficulty facing Alberta coal, was the cost of 
shipping from Alberta and competition from American coal. By 
1945 shipments to Ontario had risen to 541,882 tons, and reached

a peak in 1946 of 658,733 tons, only to decline to 75,029 tons 
by 1956. Table 21 indicates Alberta coal sales to the Ontario 
market for selected years from 1920 to 1954, together with the 
statistics of competitive energy sources. It will be noted 
that competitive pressure from imported coal and petroleum pro¬ 
ducts, together with the sales of Alberta petroleum products, 
have increased over the period. The growth in hydro-electric 
power capacity, has also been a factor in the decline of the 
market for Alberta coal. 


Sales of Alberta coal to the United States have been 
influenced by war conditions. Sales rose from 32,742 tons 

in 1941 to 414,627 tons in 1943. They have declined from that

peak to 45,692 tons in 1956. An investigation by the Carroll 

Commission 1946, revealed that adjoining states of Montana and 

North Dokota, are well supplied with locally-mined coal, natural 

gas and hydro-electric power. The commissioners concluded, 

M Such a survey makes it abundantly clear that any hope of a 

large market for prairie-mined coal in the adjacent United 

17 

States is without reasonable foundation." The competition 

from export of oil and gas in the immediate future, does not 
seem to alter the conclusion suggested by the Carroll Comis¬ 
sion 1946. 

Export of Alberta coal to Japan in the past has not 
been very large. In 1947, 14,461 tons were shipped, 200,947 
tons in 1946, 44,317 tons in 1951 and 1,588 tons in 1952. 

Recent news reports seem to suggest that current negotiations 
are in progress, to make further shipments to Japan. Unless 
these shipments are of sufficient size and regularity, they 
will not offer a solution to the present condition in the industry. 

This brief sketch has attempted to survey the coal 
markets which have been available to Alberta coal in the past. 

The decline of the industry has resulted from the development 
of new and more economical energy sources. With certain 
exceptions, it would appear that hydro-electric power, natural 
gas, and petroleum products, have been the chief competitors in 
the coal markets, previously served by Alberta coal. In Sask¬ 
atchewan, locally-mined coal has been a factor in the decline of

Alberta’s prairie market. In Manitoba and Ontario, the 
pressure of American coal imports has added to the competition 
of hydro-electric and alternative fossil fuels. The exports 
of Alberta coal have never been large, relatively to reserves. 
However, current reports of possible Japanese sales, seem to 
indicate possibilities of extension in export markets in the 
future. It seems likely that freight rates will be factor in 
this market and in the Canadian market of the future. The 
question of freight rates will be explored in Chapter 5»

PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DECLINE 

The major problems of the industry under normal 
peace-time conditions, was a lack of markets. At the time 
of the Alberta Coal Commission, 1925, it was recognized 
that there was a general condition of over-development. The 
availability and abundance of Alberta coal made production 
sensitive to changes in demand. By 1924, 1,051 mines had 
been opened, 674 abandoned permanently, 68 temporarily closed, 
leaving only 309 in operation. 1 The influences of over¬ 
production on the labour force are low incomes, despite high 
wage rates, and poor working conditions. Lack of markets, 
and seasonal demand, made employment conditions in the mines 
unsatisfactory. From its start, the industry had an employ¬ 
ment problem, and the decline of the industry added to the 
problem. It will be observed from the graph on page 19, that 
persons employed declined in 1924 and average earnings were 
declining. Annual income of Alberta miners as reported to by 
labour unions to the Alberta Coal Commission 1926, for the 
years 1921 to 1923, indicated income between #700 and $900 per 
year. The Commission was of the opinion that improvement in 

living, housing and education would be secured by anything 

2 

which brought stability to the industry.

At the time of the Carroll Commission 1946, conditions 
were improving, although far from satisfactory. It will be 
noted from Table 6 on page 18, that the number of shifts 
worked indicated under-employment of the industry’s working 
force. The number of persons working 99 and 199 shifts per 
year, showed an improvement over the period. The graph on 
page 19 indicates an increase in the number of persons employed 
from 1940 to 1943. Both the average wage and yield also showed 
an increase. Table 22 sets forth earnings of sample mines for 
selected years and it will be observed! that the percentage of 
workers earning under #1500 declined, while those earning over 
that sum increased between 1931 and 1944.

From 1948 employment declined from 8,865 persons to 
3,443 persons in 1956. The decline in the bituminous mines 
for the same period was 3,275 persons, while the decline in 
the sub-bituminous mines was 1,878 persons for the same period. 
Employment figures for total employment, employment in bituminous 
and sub-bituminous mines, together with the number of shifts 
worked are given in Table 23 for the years 1936 to 1956. It 
will be noted that the average number of shifts worked for the 
years 1950 to 1956 was 213, or ten months per year, based on 
a 40-hour week. The average coal miner’s wage in 1953 for 
Alberta was #2,913, compared with an average wage of #2,990 
for the coal industry in Canada.

The Carroll Commission 1946, reported with reference 
to employment conditions, that the seasonal factor in the 
Alberta "domestic” fields is a long standing problem to which 
no adequate solution had been found* The Commission disclosed 
that some men turn to farming in the slack season, either on 
their own account or as employees, but many of the men have 
over the past years been unable to count on securing other 
employment to supplement their work in the coal mines. 

It is now proposed to examine the question of seasonal 
employment in the industry in total and finally to separate 
employment figures into bituminous and sub-bituminous mines. 

One method used to measure seasonal fluctuations has been out- 
lined by R.G. Allan. 0 This is to compute a series of moving 
monthly averages and then separate the deviations from this 
average or trend. The average deviations for each month over 
the series is then averaged to give the mean amplitude. Finally 
abnormal fluctuations are removed, to give an average seasonal 
variation. 

Table 24 indicates monthly employment in the industry 
for the years 1945 to 1956. These employment figures were used 
to compute a series of moving averages shown in Table 32 included 
in Appendix 1. It will be observed that the peak employment 
month for the industry is December, while the trough in employment

was in June* The average number of seasonal employees for the 
industry was 1,746 persons* The moving average and the monthly 
employment figures for the industry as a whole are graphed on 
page 48. It will be observed that the amplitude of seasonal 
employment increased at the height of the trend in 1946 and as 
the industry declined, the seasonal fluctuation became smaller. 
However in relative terms in 1945 seasonal workers amounted to 
18% of the trend value while in 1955 this percentage had risen 
to 42%. The change in the trend of the industry came in 1948 
and it has declined up to the present time. 

An analysis of employment in the industry as a whole, 
although useful for an overall picture hides factors which are 
useful in understanding the problems of the industry. In 1949 
93.5% of bituminous coal, groups 1 to 3, was sold to markets 
outside of Alberta. It should also be remembered that this 
coal is mined in a belt running along the western boundry of 
the Province. This point was demonstrated in the map located 
on page 5. On the other hand, in 1949 59.8% of sub-bituminous 
coal was sold outside of Alberta. This classification includes 
groups 4 and 5, and this coal is mined in the prairie belt of 
the province. As fluctuations in employment in each of these 
groups influences a different area of the Province, an examina¬ 
tion of seasonal fluctuations will be made for both bituminous 
and sub-bituminous mines. 

Table 26 gives the monthly employment figures for the 
bituminous coal mines of Alberta, for the period 1945 to 1956.

The moving averages which were computed from these figures are 
given in Table 34, Appendix 1, Table 27 gives a summary of 
the deviations from the trend, listed in Table 55, Appendix 1. 

It will be observed that the peak employment month was in Janu¬ 
ary while the trough in employment came in June. The average 
seasonal employment for the twelve year period was 525 persons. 
Reference to the graph on page 52, and to Table 35, Appendix 1, 
indicates that there are two periods in which the character of 
the fluctuations changed. The first period might be said to 
run from 1945 to 1950, while the second would run from 1951 to 
1956. In the first period the peak employment came on the aver¬ 
age in January and the trough in July, with 382 seasonal workers. 
In the second period, the peak employment months was January on 
the average and the trough in June, with 751 seasonal workers. 

As the industry declined, the number of seasonal workers in¬ 
creased. In relative terms in 1950 seasonal workers amounted 
to 14$ of the trend value while in 1955 it had risen to 25$.

as the second, there is little change in the timing of the 
peaks and troughs, but seasonal workers in the first period 
were 1,446 compared to 1,074 in the second period. The graph 
on page 54 indicates the trend of employment in the sub- 
bituminous mines, together with the monthly employment figures. 
A general decline appears to have commenced in 1948 and con- 
^^■^ued to the present time. The amplitude of seasonal employ¬ 
ment decreased with the decline of the industry. In relative 
terms in 1950 seasonal workers amounted to 63% of the trend 
while in 1955 it had risen to 66%.

The problems resulting from the decline of the industry 
did not fall with equal weight on the lives of the bituminous 
and sub-bituminous miners. A characteristic of the sub- 
bituminous market was its relatively large concentration in 
the domestic market. The seasonal aspect of the domestic 
market has long been a problem associated with this division 
of the industry throughout its history. It was noted that the 
amplitude of the seasonal variations was more pronounced in the 
sub-bituminous mines between the period 1945 to 1956. With the 
general decline in employment which appeared to commence during 
1949, increasing numbers of miners were released during the 


summer months

of employment over the years and with the development of the 
oil and gas industry, and the boom in construction, they were 
easily absorbed. Employment in the oil and gas industry increased 
from 4,433 in 1949 to 7,716 in 1952, or a 57% increase. 

Another factor which operated to make the transition 
easier for sub-bituminous miners, was the proximity of the mines 
to the newly developing oil and gas fields. In a very general 
way, the oil and gas fields are located in the plains area of 
the province. The development of new industries in the com¬ 
munities formerly dominated by coal, made the transition from 
the coal industry to others much easier. 

The transition for sub-bituminous miners was not 

without some hardship. Many small communities were located 

close to mines which were forced to close and these people were 

forced to abandon their homes and seek employment in new areas. 

A summary of a speech by the member for Drumheller, Minister of 

Highways, Hon. G. E. Taylor, reported in April 1957, 

To-day in the Drumheller area, however, is a time of 
sadness, particularily in the hamlets of Rosedale and 

Aerial.About one-quarter of the men who have been 

laid off are over 60 years of age and about one- 
quarter are under 40 years of age; the other 50% are 
between 40 and 60 years of age. Most of the men in 
the two older groups have spent their lives in the 
coal fields and rehabilitation will be difficult. 

The impact of the decline on the bituminous miners 

was a much more dramatic and troublesome story. Unlike the

sub—bituminous mines, the amplitude of seasonal variation in 
bituminous mines was not so pronounced. Efforts had been 
made in the past to level out production. With the decline 
in the industry, the miners were not conditioned psychologically 
for entry into new trades. Contrasted with sub-bituminous 
mines, the bituminous mines are located away from the settled 
areas of the Province. The towns were completely dependent 
on the coal industry and no new industry developed in close 
proximity to alleviate the hardship of losing their means of 
subsistenc e. 

With the initial decline in 1949, the younger men 
moved out and found employment in lumbering and construction. 
Those who remained were older married persons, who had estab¬ 
lished their homes in the area. For these people the situation 
was tragic. Faced with unemployment, they were forced to move 
but unable to sell their homes, which had fallen in value from 
#5000 to #800 in a very short space of time. For those who 
lived in company owned homes and communities, they were faced 
with moving their families and personal belongings. A notice 
which was posted on the office in Alexo on June 21st., 1955, 
portrayed the situation in a very vivid way. 

Notice - as Mr. Renton will be leaving at the begin¬ 
ning of July, it is now our intention to close the 
store at the end of June. It is our present intention 
to have power cut off at the end of July, and to have 
the road to Alexo closed, to prevent the entrance of 
trespassers. Therefore this is notice to all residents 
to make arrangement to move by about 1st. August.- 

Alexo Coal Company.

Municipalities located in the vicinity of sub-bituminous 
mines were accustomed to the fluctuations in mining activities 
and were not dependent on it for their existence. However, in 
the mining areas of Crowsnest Pass, Nordegg-Brazeau and the 
Coal Branch, hitherto thriving communities were transformed 
into depressed areas. In the Coal Branch and Brazeau areas, 
the towns were for the most part, company owned. The situation 
was different, however, in the Crowsnest Pass area where homes 
were owned by the unemployed miners. 

The loss of capital and equipment which resulted 

from the decline of the industry has not been measured to the 

writer’s knowledge. However, the picture of a ghost town was 

described by K. Wood in an Edmonton Journal article entitled, 

"Nordegg - Twilight Town." He described the scene of locked 

doors and empty windows, general store, bake shop, hotels and 

churches. A measure of the losses involved might be taken 

from the Nordegg example, where it was reported in the Canadian 

Mineworker, that the Provincial Government had a mortgage on 

5 

the property of five million dollars. This money was loaned 
to the company after a fire disaster, to help revive the coal 
industry. A further indication of the amount of capital and 
equipment lost, can be obtained from the fact that between 
1945 and 1956, 234 mines were abandoned. Besides the loss 
of buildings and. equipment must be added the loss of resources. 

It is reported that an abandoned mine cannot be re-opened

without considerable expenditure of new capital and training 
of personnel. 

With the decline of employment in the coal industry, 
membership in the labour union has declined. Due to a decline 
in membership, and a consequent reduction of income, District 
18, United Mine Workers of America announced in June, discon¬ 
tinuation of their publication, The Canadian Mineworker . It 
had been published monthly since 1941 and many will miss the 
fine contribution it has made to the journalistic stage of 
Canada. 


Revenue from coal royalties received by the Province 
declined from $646,539.66 in 1948-49, to $379,492.51 in 1952-3. 
However, this decline was more than offset by the increase in 
gas and oil royalties, which increased from §1,753,573.00 to 
$13,510,951.66 in the same period.

Chapter V 
ADJUSTMENTS MADE 

In this chapter it is intended to review the steps 
which have been taken by the various governments and groups, 
to meet the problems of the coal industry, For purposes of 
discussion, the period 1900 to 1956 will be divided into three 
parts. Prior to 1925 is termed the pioneering period, while 
the period 1926 to 1949 might be called the maturing period 
of the industry. The final period which begins in 1949, 
represents the period of decline. 

The recommendations of the Alberta Coal Commission 
1925, recognized a need for re-organization of the Alberta 
coal industry. The regulation and control of the industry had 
become divided between various government departments. The 
Department of Mines prior to 1914 was connected with the 
Department of Public Works. It then became a branch of the 
Provincial Secretary’s Department and in 1920 it came under the 
Executive Council. The Commissioners therefore recommended 
the establishment of a Department of Mines of the Province of 
Alberta, in anticipation of the ceding of control of resources 
in the province from the Dominion Government to the Provincial 
Government. They recommended that control and regulation of 
the industry be vested in the department and in all matters of 
policy related to the coal industry, the government be guided 
by the Department of Mines.

It was felt by the Commissioners that many of the 
problems causing dissatisfaction between the operators, the 
employees and government departments would be removed. Proper 
co-ordinated inspection of mines, administration and enforce¬ 
ment of leases, and fair and impartial adjustment of compensa¬ 
tion claims, would do much to alleviate problems presented to 
the Commission. The Commissioners were of the opinion that 
conditions sanctioned under pioneer times, were no longer 
justified and there was a need for re-organization with a 
view to achieving uniform and equitable standards for the 
industry as a whole. 

In addition to a need for uniformity, the Commission 
recognized a condition of over-development in the industry. 

The causes of over-development did in some aspects relate to 
the administration of the industry. Besides the abundance of 
coal resources and the easy access to the deposits, the Alberta 
Coal Commission 1925, referred to the lack of effective control 
over the number of new mines opened. Low initial capital out¬ 
lay made it easier to exploit temporary markets resulting from 
strikes or seasonal demand. Once a mine was opened, it tended 
to stay in production, despite the disappearance of the causes 
which originally brought it into existence. At the time of the 
enquiry, figures were introduced to show that in 1922, 293 out 
of 362 mines produced only 4.6% of the total production of coal 
in the province and on the average, produced only 1,063 tons 
each. Of these mines, 217 produced less than a 1,000 tons

each and 163 were less than 500 tons each. 

The commissioners had no recommendation to make with 
regard to the size of the mines, only that uniform standards 
of production and working conditions should prevail, regardless 
of size. It was recognized that the number of mines was a fac¬ 
tor in the seasonal fluctuations of the industry. Solution to 
seasonal fluctuations, it was felt could only be found in stabi¬ 
lizing railroad railroad production and in finding new markets 
for coal. 


The problem of freight rates was discussed in the 
report of the Alberta Goal Commission 1925, when prospects for 
markets in British Columbia, Manitoba and Ontario were considered. 
Any extension of markets would depend on tariffs, dumping pro¬ 
visions and freight rates. Action in this regard would depend 
on the Federal Government. 

The situation in 1925 might be summed up by describing 
the coal industry as in process of standardization, plagued by 
seasonal demand and the lack of markets. Part of the solution 
would be in the hands of the Provincial authority but the 
question of markets would depend on Federal action. 

In November 1923, influenced by the coal strike in 
the United States, the Minister of Mines in the Dominion Govern¬ 
ment recommended the organization of the Dominion Fuel Board. 

The board was instructed to study the Canadian fuel problem.

In the winter of 1922-3, as a result of a shortage of fuel 
supplies from the United States, there was a severe fuel 
shortage in Canada. On March 8th., 1923, a special committee 
of the Senate was appointed to consider the Canadian Fuel supply, 
and it recommended the Dominion Fuel Board he empowered to co¬ 
operate with the transportation and other interests, to the end 
that freight rates may be reduced and better facilities be 
provided for the handling and storage of coal. As a result of 
these committees and the Dominion Fuel Board, tariff changes 
were made and subventions were instituted. 

While the Fuel Board came into existence as a result 
of expected coal shortages, its chief function soon became that 
of administering subventions. The Carroll Commission 1946, 
reported that this scheme was administered by various methods, 
depending on the market and the area involved. They summarized 
these methods as follows: 

(1) Paying on individual movements, the difference between 
the laid-down cost of Canadian coal andthe laid-down 
cost of imported coal that might otherwise have been 
used. 

(2) Reducing the freight rate by paying the carrier a 
fraction of s cent per ton mile. 

(3) Reducing ths freight rate by paying the carrier a 
percentage of the rate. 

(4) Paying $2.50 per ton on an $8.00 rate offered by the 
railways for movement of Alberta coal into Central 
Canada. 

It was generally conceded by those who had studied 
the Alberta coal problem that distance from the large potential

It is quite apparent that there is not any very great 
incentive to retail dealers in the Toronto area to 
stock Alberta coal under these conditions. If the 
dealer could secure it at the docks in a ton or two 
at a time as he can with imported coals, he would 
feature it and do a great deal to promote its sale. 
This desired arrangement can be brought about by one 
or two Alberta mines joining together and providing 
covered storage facilities on the docks as is done 
by the importers of foreign coals. But as already 
stated, Alberta mines can not undertake an expenditure 
of this type when there is no definite assurance that 
the government at Ottawa will continue its payment of 
subventions or the railways continue to haul the coal 
from Alberta to Ontario at $8.00 per ton. 


Table 29 is a record of the subventions paid on 


movements of Alberta coal 1928 to 1954. 


The Carroll Commis¬ 


sion 1946 reported that substantial quantities of bituminous 
coal had moved under subventions from Western Canada. The 


amount of domestic coal reaching the market in Central Canada 
during the middle and late 30’s never exceeded 65,000 tons 
annually. Table 30 gives the percentage share of Canadian 
coal consumption secured by Canadian coal and imported coal. 
It would appear from these percentages that the policy of 
subventions did not materially influence the distribution of 
Canadian coal supplies. It should also be noted from the 
figures in Table 30 that the amounts of coal moving under

subventions and the rates fluctuated from year to year. 

In the report of the Carroll Commission 1946, Commis¬ 
sioner Angus J. Morrison found that administration of subven¬ 
tions had been somewhat unsatisfactory. Operators or dealers 
did not know from one year to another whether subventions would 
be available or not. Referring to this unstable situation, 

Mr. Morrison reported 

Even within the areas and time limits for which sub¬ 
ventions might be approved in a given year , it has 
frequently been found that movements of coal which 
otherwise qualified were denied subvention assistance 
merely by the accident that subvention claims filed 
previously by operators in other parts of the country 
had exhausted the funds voted for subventions. 

The changes in market conditions were not fully anti¬ 
cipated by the Carroll Commission 1946, and since 1949 have 
had an adverse effect on the coal industry. Despite increased 
subventions, which rose from $4.6 million in 1951-2 to $11.3 
million in 1954-5, the industry has continued to decline. It 
is reported in the Canada Year Book, 1956 , that the Dominion 
Coal Board is keeping pace with its studies of the situation 
and that the government is currently seeking as sound a solu¬ 
tion as possible to the difficulties confronting the coal 
6 

industry.

In 1955 the Dominion Government appointed a Royal 
Commission to study Canada’s economic prospects. This commis¬ 
sion which became known as the Gordon Royal Commission, 
requested a study of Canadian energy prospects, which was 
published in March 1957. 7 This study made some estimates 
of the future use of coal in Canada. It was estimated that 
although coal would fall in relative supply in relation to 
other fuels, from 39$ in 1953 to 16$ in 1980, quantatively the 

c 

tonnage of coal required in 1980 would be up 1.3 times. 

Estimates of the place coal would fill in future energy 
requirements were based on the assumption that nuclear energy 
would not reach its final stage of development until 1980. 
Technological advance might alter this estimate. However, if 
Alberta is able to maintain its position as a supplier of coal, 
it could mean a production of coal in 1980 of approximately 
7.7 million tons. This level of production is somewhat below 
the peak production of 8.7 million in 1948. 

The study referred to above, does anticipate a reduction 
of persons employed with an increasing emphasis on mechanization. 
Reference was made to the fact that in 1945, strip mining 
accounted for 20$ of output, while in 1957 this had risen to 
50$. It was anticipated that this might rise to 66% by 1960.

With reference to future production of coal in Western 
Canada, the report suggested that production may not begin to 
pick up until 1970 or later. This improvement is likely to 
be engendered by the needs of the electric power utilities. 

It might be important to note that it is in this field that 
nuclear energy might make its first impact. 

Before leaving the finding of the report on Canadian 
Energy Prospects, the question of imports of coal was discussed. 
It was estimated that the revival of Canadian coal production 
after 1970 will by then be overshadowed by the great increase 
in imports which were expected to increase approximately 2.6 
times over the 1953 level. 

Activities of the provincial government in aiding the 
coal industry have been considerable. Numerous commissions 
of enquiry into conditions in the industry have been set up in 
the past. Legislation designed to improve the efficiency of 
marketing and production have been enacted. Protection of 
labour and mine safety measures have been the responsibility 
of the Workmen’s Compensation Board. In addition to these 
activities, the Research Council of Alberta has contributed to 
geological and technical knowledge. Research has been continued 
in an effort to establish new uses for coal. 

With the decline of the industry after 1949, the full 
impact of the situation fell upon the provincial government.

In 1954 the mining areas of Orowsnest Pass, Nordegg—Brazeau and 
the Coal Branch faced a crisis brought about by a decline in the 
steam coal market. A delegation of citizens from Coleman 
approached the Provincial Cabinet in that year, requesting 
something be done to aid the men and their families faced with 
unemployment and no prospect for employment in their area in the 
future. A bill was introduced in the session of 1954, and it 
received Royal Assent on April 8, 1954. This statute, termed 
"The Coal Miners Rehabilitation Act," provided for the expendi¬ 
ture of $100,000 to assist in the rehabilitation of coal miners 
from special areas in the Province. A miner’s rehabilitation 
committee was formed, consisting of J. A. Dutton, Director of 
Mines, W.A.R. Rees, Director of Single Men’s Relief and Chair¬ 
man, J. Ferguson, Supervisor of Immigration. 

Surveys were made of affected areas and arrangements 
were made to move families and effects to areas where employ¬ 
ment might be found. Transportation to any point between the 
Pacific coast and the Great Lakes was paid by the Provincial 
Government. The services of the Vocational Training, National 
Employment Services, Chambers of Commerce and Trade Associa¬ 
tions were enlisted in the problem of finding alternative 
employment. Problems associated with this program were enor¬ 
mous. Miners were still faced with loss of their homes and 
were naturally reluctant to face the facts of the situation. 

New jobs presented to many an enormous challenge and in many cases

a fall in income was involved, when compared to miner’s rates. 

An Edmonton Journal editorial January 5th., 1956, 

had this to say about the aid provided to the miners. 

A combined effort by government, labour unions and 
individuals has written a happy ending to what 
could have been a tragedy to the story of Alberta 

coal industry.It now appears that the 

committee’s work is about finished. In fact, 
there is a demand for coal miners in some areas, 
including Lethbridge and Drumheller. But it is 
purely seasonal and temporary, brought on by 
increased domestic consumption due to the early 
onslaught of winter.® 

The District 18, United Mine Workers of America has 
continued its efforts to promote the welfare of the industry in 
the interest of its members. In February 1950, a joint brief 
was prepared by the Dist. 18, United Mine Workers of America, 
Domestic Coal Operators’ Association of Western Canada and the 
Western Canadian Bituminous Coal Operators Association, which 
was published in the Canadian Mineworker in February 1950, 
warning of the dangers to the industry, and to the province 
which would be risked, if natural gas was exported from the 
Province. It was anticipated that a considerable market for 
coal would be lost if this policy was pursued. The subject 
of export of natural gas was again voiced in the editorial of 
the Canadian Mineworker of May 1952, when it was pointed out 
that members from Drumheller, Edson, Rocky Mountain House and 
Crowsnest Pass had voted in favour of export.

In July, 1952 an editorial in the Canadian Mineworker 
brought to the attention of its members, the situation exist¬ 
ing between policy of the Federal and Provincial Governments. 

It records: 

In a recent discussion in the Canadian House of 
Commons some Alberta members expressed concern 

about the future of the coal mining industry. 

The Minister of Mines and Technical Surveys, 

George Prudham, called attention to something 
else that will hurt the Alberta Goal Industry... 

The export of natural gas to the Pacific coast. 

This he said, would affect one of Alberta’s 
best markets....But, said the minister, he had 
confidence that the Alberta Government would 
measure up to the situation. 10 

On June IS, 1952, officers of Dist. 18, United Mine 
Workers of America, on the occasion of a visit of Mr. Prudham 
to Calgary, questioned him on the situation of the coal industry. 
Although Mr. Prudham would not commit himself to extend further 
assistance to the industry, he did state that he was very 
optimistic of the future of the industry but in the long-term 
view the industry would combat its present difficulties.^ 


On November 22, 1954, a delegation representing Dist* 
18, United Mine Workers, Coal Operators Association, Coal 
Companies, and the Alberta and British Columbia Provincial 
Governments called on the Federal Government to take steps to 
alleviate present conditions in the industry. Their recommend¬ 
ations included, increased subventions on shipments to Ontario 
and Western Canada, maintenance of a minimum number of steam

locomotives on the railroads, use of coal by Federal Institu¬ 
tions, establishment of thermal power plants, increased research 
and aid to establish exports to Japan. 

On the 3rd., of October 1957, a delegation representing 
Dist. 18, United Mine Workers, presented a brief to the Hon. 

P.E. Comtois, Minister of Mines and Technical Surveys. After 
outlining statistics on production, mines abandoned and operated 
during the period 1949 to 1956, they drew attention to the fact 
that imports of American coal had increased from 18.5 million 
tons in 1954 to 23.1 million tons in 1956. They pointed out 
that if 10# of these imports were supplied from the western 
coal fields, the industry would be stabilized. They suggested 
that this could be accomplished by raising the tariff on 
imported coal - by paying higher subvention, or subsidies or 
by establishing a quota system on tonnage imported. They 
renewed their suggestions outlined in the brief of November 
1954. A brief at the same time was presented to Hon. M. Starr, 
Minister of Labour, requesting amendments to the Unemployment 
Insurance Act, to render assistance to the unemployed miners. 

In a brief compiled for submission to the Gordon 
Royal Commission by the Province of Alberta in 1955, it was 
reported, that the future of Alberta coal industry is impos¬ 
sible to predict with any assurance. A further decline would 
appear likely in the immediate future but the consensus is that, 
on a long-term basis, the future for the industry is assured.

This judgement is based on immensity of reserves, expanding 
demands for all forms of energy, technological improvements 
in mining, preparation and utilization of coal, an aggressive 
research program, and predicted increased well-head prices 
for both oil and natural gas. This has been the pattern of 
events in the United States and will no doubt be the pattern 
in Canada and particularly in Alberta.

Chapter VI 

DOMINION AND PROVINCIAL POLICIES 

Up to this point, this thesis has attempted to give a 
picture of the coal industry in Alberta from its inception, 
together with the changing conditions faced by those concerned 
with its operations, up to the present time. In this chapter 
the most important points of government action will be examined 
and an attempt made to restate them in terms of administrative 
policy. Dominion Government policy is directed to the Canadian 
coal industry, however; only those actions which influence the 
Alberta coal industry will be reviewed in this thesis. 

The first attempt to regulate the industry arose as 
a result of a fuel shortage in Ontario in 1917. A Fuel Control¬ 
ler was appointed at that time with power to investigate and 
regulate the production and distribution of coal. The result 
of the work of the Fuel Controller during the war of 1914-18, 
was to secure increased supplies from the United States, secure 
economies of use from consumers and to control prices to the 
consumers. Policy at this time was directed by the exigency of 
the war. 

It was not until 1921, when a Special Committee of the 
House of Commons was set up to investigate the fuel resources of 
Canada, that the coal situation received special attention. 

This committee recommended the appointment of an officer to 
keep in close touch with the fuel situation and with power to

deal "With any emergency* The committee also urged the develop¬ 
ment of water resources, electrification of railways, reduction 
of water transportation rates and wider use of Canadian coal, 
instead of imported anthracite. 

In 1922, following the committee’s report and probably 
influenced by the coal strike in the United States, the Minister 
of Mines recommended the establishment of a Dominion Fuel Board. 
In 1923, following a severe fuel shortage, a Special Committee of 
the Senate was formed to consider the fuel situation and to co¬ 
operate with the Fuel Board. This committee recommended that 
power be given to the Dominion Fuel Board to co-operate with 
transportation and other interests with a view to bringing about 
lower freight rates, better facilities for handling and storing 
coal, and greater use of Canadian coal. 

In March, 1923, a resolution was introduced in the 
house of Commons and referred to the Select Standing Committee 
on Mines and Minerals , urging the establishment of a National 
Policy on coal. It went on to state that action should be taken 
at once, through the various interests concerned, to insure 
Canadian independence from other countries in its supply of fuel. 
This committee recommended a conference of coal interests and 
an investigation into costs of transportation. 

It was not until 1926, that a Special Committee of the 
House of Commons recommended trial shipments of Alberta coal 
under supervision of the Fuel Board, to ascertain the possibi-

lities of large-scale movements of western coal to Ontario. 

It also recommended increasing the scope of the tariff to 
cover anthracite and the re-examination of possible assistance 
to rail movement of coal. 

As a result of these committees and the activity of the 
Fuel Board, tariff changes were made and subventions instituted. 

In the period from 1919 to 1939, Dominion Government policy was 
implemented through the agency of the Dominion Fuel Board. The 
board came into existence as a result of fears of a fuel shortage. 
However, its function became the administration of subventions, 
with a view to assisting Canadian coal producers find markets 
for their co al• 

The entry of Canada into the war in 1939 prompted the 
Dominion Fuel Board into issuing a memorandum to the Wartime 
Prices and Trade Board, recalling the fuel difficulties of the 
last war and outlining a program of action. This resulted in 
the appointment of a Coal Administrator, to conduct negotiations 
with the United Kingdom for coal imports to Canada, and to co¬ 
operate with the Provinces to maintain and stimulate production 
of Canadian coal. In 1941 the powers and duties of the Dominion 
Fuel Board were transferred to the Goal Administrator in the 
interests of war needs. In 1942 as a result of increased cons¬ 
umption of coal it was found necessary to establish the Emergency 
Coal Production Board to increase production of Canadian coal. 


In 1942 all control of coal was centered under the Department of

Munitions and Supply, reflecting the problem of supply to meet 
the war needs. 

Policy during the war years was directed to the utiliza¬ 
tion of all available supplies in the interest of fuel conserva¬ 
tion. The manipulation of markets and the direction of supplies 
were all decided in the interests of the war economy. Alberta 
coal producers were subsidized directly to encourage production 
and to give some relief to wage and bonus regulations imposed 
by government authority. These subsidies were paid to maintain 
a normal return on individual operations. Grants were also made 
to encourage the opening of new mines for quick production. In 
October, 1944, as a result of a report to the Committee of 
the Privy Council from the Minister of Munitions and Supply, a 
Boyal Commission on Coal was appointed to make a full enquiry 
into the coal industry in Canada. With the abandonment of con¬ 
trols in 1947, the coal industry was once more on its own. The 
problems of the industry at this point might be described as 
an industry which in peace-time was plagued with overproduction, 
while in war-time it was unable to meet unexpected demands. 

The Carroll Commission 1946, recommended that a policy 
of equating costs of domestic and imported coal, through sub¬ 
ventions should be continued. assistance in this form, 
announced as a permanent policy, would materially help pro¬ 
gressive coal operators to secure markets in Central Canada. 

It further recommended that a Statutory Board be created with

a full-time chairman to keep Canada’s fuel requirements under 
continuous review and to advise upon and administer transporta¬ 
tion subventions. 


Commissioner A.J. Morrison submitted a minority report 
with respect to the recommendations of the Royal Commission. 

He emphasized the need for a co-operative policy of stock¬ 
piling by the railroads, in order to remove seasonal fluctua¬ 
tions in the bituminous coal fields of Alberta. The Commissioner 
recommended certain principles which should guide the adminis¬ 
tration of subventions, as follows: 

(1) Policy be clearly defined and set, rather than 
left to individual negotiation. 

(2) Consistency of policy be developed, to give some 
assurance that markets developed in one year will 
not be left outside the competitive areas of the 
Canadian producers in a subsequent year. 

(3) Adequate advance commitments be available, to 
enable producers to plan their sales and develop 
new customers. 

(4) Adequate finances be provided. 

A recommendation also made by Commissioner Morrison, 
was the establishment of a Dominion Coal Board, whose functions 
should be as follows: 

(1) Administration of transportation subventions. 

(2) Administration of direct subsidies extended by the 
Dominion Government to promote production, distribu¬ 
tion and use of coal for specific purposes such as 
bunkerage and coke production. 

(3) Research into marketing problems and techniques.

(4) Technical research on coal mining methods, the 
physical and chemical characteristics of coal, 
development and new uses for Canadian coal. 

(5) Co-ordination of the activities of other Government 
Departments such as the Bureau of Mines, the Dominion 
Bureau of Statistics, and such other Departments 

as deal with matters relating to coal. 

(6) Publication and distribution of information on coal. 

(7) Provision of a central point through which representa¬ 
tions can be made to the Government on problems res¬ 
pecting coal production, distribution and use. 

(8) Advice to the Government on policy respecting coal 
production, distribution and use. 

In July, 1947, an act to establish the Dominion Coal 
Board was passed by the Government, with the function of recom¬ 
mending to the Minister, policies and measures it considers 
necessary as to production, importation, distribution and uses 
of coal in Canada. This body has issued yearly reports on the 
coal situation in Canada and has continued to advise the govern¬ 
ment on matters concerning the industry. In the annual report 
of the Coal Board 1955-6, the views of the board on the present 
coal situation were expressed as follows: 


Reviewing the situation as a whole, the Board is con¬ 
vinced thatthe Canadian coal industry is basic and 
essential to our national economy. The proof lies in 
the experience of other main industrial countries where 
coal requirements presently exceed the supply. While 
oil and natural gas may have the glamour associated with 
relatively new discovery and development, coal, which 
may become prosaic because of its ancient history, will 
undoubtedly remain a potent and growing force in the 
industrial and power field. The problem in Canada is 
to maintain coal mining in the strategic areas of supply 
so that it may fulfil the role that it will undoubtedly 
be called upon to play in our economic expansion.

Before turning to the evidence of Provincial policy 
on the Coal Industry in Alberta, a summary of federal policy 
might be helpful. It has apparently been recognized by the 
Government over the years that an economical source of energy 
was essential to the nation’s growth. Tariffs which would 
open up the market in central Canada to Canadian coal would 
mean higher prices of coal* It was also recognized that 
complete dependence on one source of coal was not in the 
best interests of Canada. It should also be noted that the 
Carroll Commission 1946, reported that the industry as then 

g 

constructed could not meet the total needs of the country. 
Freight rate subventions which would equate costs of produc¬ 
tion at the market area, it was believed would provide incen¬ 
tive and markets for Canadian coal. This policy was criticized 
because past administration gave no assurance of continuity, 
necessary for long run planning in the industry. During the 
war years from 1939 to 1947, control of the industry, as to 
wages, manpower, production and profits were regulated in 
the interests of the war economy. With the lifting of controls, 
it became evident that the industry was faced with competition 
from new energy sources. The relative importance of energy 
sources is summarized by figure 9, on page 80, where it will 
be noted that coal generally has declined as an energy source.

The report of the Dominion Coal Board appears to envisage a 
slackening of the competition from other fuels, with a renewed 
dependence on coal as a fuel source. Policy seems likely to 
be directed to maintaining a skeleton industry over the 
intervening period. 

In the outline of events which helped to determine 
federal government policy towards the Canadian coal industry, 
it was noted that fear of coal shortages and dependence on 
American supply focused attention on the fuel problem. It 
was felt by many leading industrialists that coal was the 
mainspring of modern material civilization. The importance 
of coal as a natural resource of the Province of Alberta was 
recognized by its administrators, and numerous commissions 
have made studies of the problems of the industry. 

At the time of the Alberta Coal Commission in 1926, 
it was recognized that the main problem of the industry was 
one of finding markets. At that time, control of natural 
resources was still vested with the federal government, al¬ 
though it was anticipated by the Commission that they would 
shortly be turned over to the Province. The recommendations 
of the Commission for guiding Provincial policy were largely 
directed to the improvement of conditions within the industry. 
They recommended the establishment of a Department of Mines, 
and regulations designed to bring uniform standards of 
performance and. working conditions. The question of nationa-

lization was considered by the Commission but it was not 
recommended, as it was felt that nationalization at the pro¬ 
vincial level would not solve the problems of the industry. 
The Commissioners recommended that the Government exercise 
its power of control and stricter enforcement of its regula¬ 
tions. 


In 1935 a Royal Commission was appointed under the 
chairmanship of Sir Montague Barlow to examine the coal 
industry in the Province of Alberta. Three major changes 
had taken place since the previous enquiry, which had influ¬ 
enced the industry in the Province. In 1930, the Province 
had taken over control of natural resources from the Federal 
Government. The industry after reaching a peak in 1928 was 
suffering from the industrial depression. Finally, a policy 
of freight rate subventions had been launched by the federal 
government. Two major problems were cited by the Commission, 
marketing and regulation. 

The recommendations of this Commission were quite broad 
and difficult to do justice to in a summary way. However, in 
order to secure a substantial portion of the Ontario market for 
Alberta coal, the Commission suggested an agreement with the rail 
roads on a |7.50 per ton freight rate for a period of five years, 
together with assurances from the federal government of a sub¬ 
vention rate of #3.00 for the same period. The provincial 
government should obtain the co-operation of the operators to 



84 


obtain standardization of grades and quality. It was also 
suggested that the provincial government spend up to $10,000 
annually to promote the sale of Alberta coal in Ontario. The 
commission recommended the establishment of an operators 
association and a mining industry welfare fund, together with 
changes in the mine rescue work and certification of miners. 

It was also recommended that the province control the number of 
mines in operation through its lease policy, and that necessary 
steps be taken to fix coal prices and minimum wages for those 
engaged in small mines. Control of production was to be obtain¬ 
ed through quotas and central selling agencies. Finally, 
schemes for rationalization or amalgamation of mines be 
considered. 

In 1945 the provincial government prepared a brief for 
submission to the Morrison Commission 1946, in which was contained 
a statement of provincial aids to the coal industry and a request 
for federal action. Under the heading of miscellaneous govern¬ 
ment activities, the numerous commissions and boards appointed 
to enquire into the problems of the coal industry, were outlined. 
With reference to the work of these enquiries it had this to say: 

It is safe to say that if the recommendations of the 
above commissions had been implemented, the coal 
industry of the province would be in a much better 
condition to-day. It is pertinent to remark that 
legislation normally follows public opinion: and 
that the recommendations of a Commission are likely 
to prove futile unless by education and forceful 
presentation they so carry public opinion the 
implementing legislation is bound to follow.

The services provided by the Provincial Mines Branch and the 
Research Council of Alberta were also cited. In concluding 
its recommendations to the Morrison Commission 1946, the 
brief stated: 

The spirit of the intentions of the Government of 
Alberta has been to bear constantly in mind the 
ultimate object that when the time comes for our 
vast coal reserves to yield more fully their 
blessings to mankind, human ingenuity will have 
devised ways and means of production which will 
eliminate completely the burdens of human toil 
and the dangers to life and limb which are now the 
lot of those who labor in the pit. 4 

One of the recommendations of the Carroll Commission 
1946, submitted by Commissioner Morrison in his minority 
report, concerned the operation of closed towns. He recommended 
that the provincial governments take action to remove the res¬ 
triction of freedom of individuals and to create conditions 
similar to open towns. The majority report did not emphasize 
this point, but felt that most of the objectional aspects of 
closed camps had been removed as a result of government 
regulation and collective labour agreements. With the sub¬ 
sequent decline of the industry, the question of closed camps 
has become academic. The problems of rehabilitation would have 
been that much greater had the open towns existed instead of 
the company towns.

A crucial point in provincial policy towards the 
Alberta coal industry came in 1950 when the question of export¬ 
ing natural gas was considered. Representation by coal interests 
was quick to point out the implications of this policy on the 
coal industry. At a time when the industry was suffering from 
the competition of fuel oil, the export of gas could only add to 
their difficulties. This policy would add new markets for 
natural gas and it was argued that it would substantially encour¬ 
age the exploration for new oil resources. It could not be 
denied that the development of the oil and gas industry was 
providing employment and income to the province in many ways. 

The boom in this new industry was bringing large cash benefits 
to the government through its lease sales. Against these 
immediate benefits it was suggested the province might lose new 
industries which in the long run would locate in the province 
if natural gas were kept in the province. 

It would appear that the immediate benefits which 
flowed from a healthy expanding gas and oil industry were in 
the best interests of the province from the government’s point 
of view. Its policy towards the coal industry appears to be 
one of allowing the industry to find its own competitive level 
of activity and to render all assistance necessary to ease 
adjustment of persons employed. Research into potential uses 
of coal are being continued by the Alberta Research Council.

Chapter YII 

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION 

The story of Alberta coal had its beginning between 
40 and 90 million years ago, during the period which is known 
as the Cretaceous era. The vegetation which was to form 
Alberta coal deposits, was small in nature and the seas around 
which it grew fluctuated during the period at various levels. 
These two factors placed restrictions on what might be described 
as an abundant supply of coal. It meant that seams might vary 
in volume and quality fairly rapidly. The mountain building 
activity of the Cenozoic era matured what normally would be 
lower rank coal, giving a belt of bituminous coal parallel to 
the mountains. This event added, besides its beneficial aspects, 
a restrictive factor of dipping and faulted seams which are more 
costly to mine. 

When Alberta coal deposits were measured against the 
rest of Canada, it was found that Alberta had 48$ of Canada’s 
reserves of mineable coal. Alberta’s reserves of mineable 
coal were estimated as 46 million short tons. In addition to 
the handicap of unpredictable seams, and dipping and faulted 
seams, the distance of Alberta coal from the major coal markets 
of Canada, added a prohibitive cost. This later factor has 
been the major problem of the Alberta coal industry during 


its history.

The historical sketch of the industry indicated that 
commercial mining commenced in Alberta in 1886. It followed 
a rather hesitant rise in production to reach a peak in 1927. 
After a decline until 1938, a result of the industrial depres¬ 
sion, the wartime tempo carried the industry to a new peak in 
1946, only to commence a decline from that date to the present 
time . 


Employment in the industry was subjected to seasonal 
fluctuations besides the influence of over-production in relation 
to market capacity. This resulted in a low income for the men 
employed in the industry. Studies of employment in the bitu¬ 
minous mines reveals that in 1944, 62$ of the men worked between 
200 and 299 shifts, while in the sub-bituminous mines only 42$ 
worked the same number of shifts. The level of activity was 
closely linked with the agricultural economy and freight traffic. 

Control of resources was not obtained by the Province 
until 1930, by which time, 15.7 million acres of coal rights 
had been alienated without royalties. Of the 15.7 million acres, 
13 million had been given as subsidies to the railroads. With 
the decline in the use of coal generally, its importance as an 
employer also declined. Salaries and wages of the Alberta coal 
industry in 1951 constituted 4$ of the total provincial wage 
bill, but by 1953 this had fallen to 2.5$ of the total. The 
development of competitive fuels had eclipsed the coal industry 
as a major employer in Alberta.

The decline of the industry can be attributed to the 
discovery of alternative fossil fuels. However, from the start 
of the Alberta coal industry, the factors mentioned earlier in 
this chapter placed severe limitations to its development. The 
nature of the coal seams and the distance from the major coal 
markets of Canada, prevented the full development of the industry. 
The survey of the markets for coal in Canada revealed the influ¬ 
ence of the development of alternative fossil fuels and, in some 
markets, the development of hydro-electric power. This competi¬ 
tion diminished those markets which had been won by Alberta 
coal and resulted in the decline of the industry. 

The Central Canadian market had never been completely 
won for Alberta coal. Although freight subventions enabled 
Alberta coal to get to the market at a price competitive with 
imported American coal, the manner in which they were adminis¬ 
tered failed to give stability to the market necessary for long 
term planning by the coal operators. American coal which had 
become established in the market, continued to retain its 
position. The demands placed on the industry during the war, 
indicated its inability to meet the total market. With the 
close of the war period, sales of Alberta coal to the Ontario 
market continued, to decline. 

The exports of Alberta coal have never been large 
relatively to reserves. However, current reports of Japanese 
interest in Alberta coal, seems to indicate possibilities of 
extension in export markets in the future.

Problems which were associated with the decline were 
largely concerned with communities located close to the bitumi¬ 
nous coal mines. These communities were removed from the settled 
areas of the province and their complete dependence on the indus¬ 
try, made their circumstances critical. Towns which had been 
thriving communities became ghost towns in a relatively short 
time. Families who had made homes in the areas, were forced 
to abandon their homes and seek new occupations in strange 
surr oun dings• 

Communities where the sub-bituminous mines were located, 
were conditioned by the seasonal nature of the industry in the 
past. The seasonal fluctuations, it was observed, were more 
marked in this part of the industry and the miners were thus 
conditioned to finding new employment. The decline of the 
industry, however, had its impact on some communities which 
grew up around the mines. The development of the oil and gas 
industry in fairly close proximity, provided some relief to 
these communities and most of the miners were quickly absorbed 
into new industry. 

Loss of revenue from coal royalties to the province 
has been more than replaced by the development of the oil and 
gas industry. Industry associated with the new industry has 
also brought increased income to the province. 

Federal government action to remedy the coal problem 
has been restricted to those measures necessary to assure the 
economy of an adequate supply of cheap fuel, without too great

a dependence on any one source of supply. Federal aid in so 
far as it applies to the Alberta coal industry was confined to 
freight rate subventions, designed to equate the cost of coal 
delivered to specified markets to imported coal. Special aid 
wa§ instituted during the war to encourage production but these 
were terminated with the close of the war. 

Provincial government aid was confined to administer¬ 
ing the coal industry with a view to maintaining uniform stan¬ 
dards of production and working conditions. Regulation of the 
industry was given to the Mines Branch and the Workmen’s 
Compensation Board. Research was undertaken through the Alberta 
Research Council with a view to acquainting potential consumers 
with the quality of Alberta coal and to discovering new uses 
for coal. 


When the decline of the industry made itself felt 
in the bituminous mining communities, aid was rendered by the 
provincial government, National Employment Service, and community 
organizations, to assist in the rehabilitation of miners into 
new areas of employment. 

Examination of Dominion government policy indicated 
that concern for the coal industry was motivated at first by 
fear of coal shortages which had resulted in Ontario during 
World War I and the period following. This fear was based on 
the belief that our economy depended basically on an adequate

supply of cheap fuel. The introduction of subventions was 
designed to encourage a source of supply which would supplement 
American sources, and would give us a measure of security 
against temporary interferences from this source. 

With the advent of the industrial depression of the 
thirties, subventions aided in the maintenance of a coal indus¬ 
try. With outbreak of war, the necessity of coal to an economy 
geared to war needs was once again demonstrated. The Carroll 
Commission 1946, investigated the coal situation and reported 
that domestic sources as then constituted, were unable to meet 
all Canada’s coal needs. Maintenance of Canadian coal as a 
secondary source of coal was to be encouraged by subventions 
designed to remove the geographical barriers of coal sources, 
from markets in Central Canada. 

The development of competitive fuels has not changed 
the present policy towards coal. The long run outlook on the 
need for coal, seems to indicate the preservation of Canadian 
coal sources in the event that the pressure from competitive 
fuels slackens. When this time arrives, Canada’s fuel needs 
will require exploitation of Alberta’s coal deposits. 

The provincial government of Alberta has been guided 
by several commissions who recognized that the question of mar¬ 
kets is one largely beyond its jurisdiction. Control and regu¬ 
lation of the industry have been directed to creating an efficient 
industry which if given the opportunity could meet the demand

of new markets# With advent of competitive fuels, protec¬ 
tion of an unstable industry was apparently ruled out and 
coal was allowed to find its own competitive position. With 
the decline of the coal industry, extra measures were required 
to aid the men employed to adjust to the new position and pre¬ 
vent unnecessary human suffering. 

Any comment on coal policy covering the period during 
which the industry has been operating should recognize two 
periods, which unfortunately blend into each other. The first 
might be said to exclude the existence of competitive fuels as 
a major factor# The entrance of new sources of energy into 
the market would necessarily require a different solution than 
that suggested in the first situation. 

In the period in which the existence of competitive 
fuels was not a major factor, the life of the economy depended 
on an adequate supply of coal. When the major source of 
supply of coal to Canada indicated instability, a policy designed 
to develop alternative sources was indicated. This objective 
might have been achieved by imposing a tariff on imports of 
American coal sufficient to equate costs of transportation or 
by subsidizing the industry to the same extent# Imposition 
of tariffs would mean higher fuel costs in an industrial area 
which might retard development. Subsidies were ideal in this 
respect as they assisted the development of an alternative source 
of supply while maintaining low fuel costs in the area. The

development of the Canadian coal industry was justified on 
grounds of national security and the costs should have been 
carried by the economy as a whole. 

Criticism of the policy referred to in the last para¬ 
graph was mentioned by the Carroll Commission 1946. The fact 
that subventions were administered on a year to year period 
and on an individual basis, maintained a feeling of insecurity 
in the industry. This atmosphere was not conducive to long-run 
planning necessary to establish proper facilities in the Central 
Canadian market. The changing conditions make it difficult to 
say whether lack of initiative on the part of the Canadian coal 
industry or government policy was responsible for the failure 
of the industry to secure the Ontario market for Canadian coal. 

If the objective of government policy was to establish Canadian 
coal in the Ontario market, it is difficult to understand why 
any other necessary steps were not taken to achieve this objective. 

A first step might have been for the federal govern¬ 
ment to announce a long term coal policy which would assure the 
coal operators of a freight rate designed to enable them to 
compete with American coal in the Central Canadian coal market. 

To encourage the formation of an operator's marketing organiza¬ 
tion, funds might have been made available through the Indus¬ 
trial Development Bank, for the development of docking and 
storage facilities in the major market areas. The report of 
the Gordon Royal Commission anticipates a demand for coal

which can be filled from Canadian sources. The stimulation 
of increased coal production and transportation activity might 
justify the costs to the tax-payer of increased subvention 
payments. 


The establishment of a Coal Marketing Board, with 
exclusive power to buy and sell coal in Canada, similar to the 
Canadian Wheat Board, might be a possible solution to the coal 
problem. Facilities for handling and storage of coal could 
be operated by the board and charges for its upkeep could be 
made against revenue before fixing payments to the operators. 
Stock-piling of coal by the board would eliminate seasonal 
fluctuations for producers, while the fixing of quotas would 
enable operators to plan production in advance. Considerable 
reorientation of consumers, conditioned to the use of American 
coal, would be required. Operation by the board would enable 
standards of quality to be made and enforced. The responsibi¬ 
lity for development of markets for coal would be with one 
body and would lead to more efficient marketing of coal. The 
question of exports of coal to Japan would be facilitated by 
this arrangement and quality could be assured. 

The institution of a coal marketing board would avoid 
the problem of tariffs and import quotas. The board would be 
empowered to fill its needs from Canadian sources and to pur¬ 
chase imported coal only when Canadian coal was not available 
in the desired quality or quantity. This approach to coal 
imports might avoid the danger of retaliation against Canadian

exports which a quota or import embargo might engender from 
the United States. Reductions in our imports from United 
States might have some influence on the exchange rate of the 
dollar. A reduction of Canadian dollars available to fill the 
present foreign demands, would tend to bid up the price of the 
Canadian dollar in terms of the United States dollar. This 
would have an unfavourable influence on Canadian exports and 
American capital inflow. 

Appreciation of the Canadian dollar would encourage 
imports of American goods. Increased economic activity from 
an invigorated coal industry might further stimulate consump¬ 
tion of American imports. In the long run, the exchange rate 
between American and Canadian dollars would tend to adjust 
back to the rate in effect before the disturbing influence. 

If the present ownership of the coal industry was 
a bar to a healthy industry, then nationalization might possibly 
offer a solution. If it can be shown that the industry failed 
because of poor management, then there might be some justifica¬ 
tion in this solution. The problem of the industry has been 
markets and freight rates. Nationalization of the coal indus¬ 
try would not solve these problems. 

The entry of competitive fuels on the market does 
present some additional problems in finding a solution to the 
coal problem. Support of the coal industry might in some

instances place the government in the position of favouring 
one group of producers at the expense of another. Coal might 
in some cases replace gas or oil as a result of an artificially 
supported price* Subsidization of coal exports to Japan might 
bring increased competition to our manufacturing industry from 
Japanese imports. 

With the above-mentioned costs in mind, support to 
the Canadian coal industry can only be justified where the long 
run interests of Canada require the maintenance of a vital 
supply. It was reported on page 79 that the Dominion Coal 
Board was of the opinion that a renewed demand for coal would 
result. Support can also be justified where idle resources 
can be employed, which would otherwise be maintained at public 
expense. 

The findings of the Gordon Royal Commission suggest 
by 1970, increased quantities of coal will be required. 1 If 
the quantity estimated by the Gordon Royal Commission as likely 
to be imported from the United States is modified by policy 
which expands the use of Canadian coal, there would be ample 
markets for Canadian coal. 

The question of world energy supply and its uses was 
investigated by H. Brown, J• Bonner , andJ. weir, of the

California Institute of Technology. 2 They were of the opinion 
that if consumption of energy continues to increase at an 
accelerated rate, coal would become the major source of energy 
as early as 1965-70 . S They also stressed the fact that coal 
reserves are not evenly distributed. United States has suffi¬ 
cient coal reserves to last several centuries but Europe and 
some parts of Asia would be desperate for energy sources. 

The case for support of the coal industry is documented 
by studies which indicate restricted use of coal until possibly 
1965-70, by which time coal is likely to be the major source 
of energy. Restricted use of coal will continue, however, in 
the intervening period. Maintenance of a skeleton industry may 
be justified on grounds of national security. 

Such a policy would involve certain costs, but while 
a net benefit may be deemed to accrue, support of the industry 
seems desirable. Increased flows of coal would mean costs to 
the tax-payer in terms of taxes. Employment of resources in 
uneconomic activity which might otherwise over time be employed 
in unsupported industry, involves certain costs. It should 
be noted that resources unemployed at the present time are 
not necessarily unemployed over the period necessary to

support the coal industry# Finally, the development of nuclear 
energy raises a number of conjectural considerations in relation 
to the prospects of the coal industry. 

However, Canada is a large and variegated country. It 
is presently utilizing a number of competing energy sources 
with the proportions varying in different parts of the country. 
The degree to which any given fuel is used depends fundamentally 
upon marginal costs and revenues. The principle of substitu¬ 
tion tends to distribute fuels among the uses in such a way that 
marginal equalities of returns are approximated. In these 
economic terms old fuels and energy sources hold their own in 
many areas as against the new. The new never take over entirely. 
A basic coal industry can be expected to survive in Canada and 
Alberta for decades to come. 

The part played by the provincial government in the 
development of the coal industry of Alberta has been limited by 
the nature of its jurisdiction. However, in the field of 
regulation and control, much has been done to stabilize the 
industry. At the point where export of natural gas was decided, 
the provincial government might have indirectly aided the coal 
industry. The issue was not, however, whether coal should be 
protected, but whether retention of natural gas in Alberta was 
likely to bring greater benefits to the Province by providing 
abundant cheap fuel to industry locating in Alberta. Had such

The cost of such a policy would have been less immediate 
benefits with possible greater returns in the future. 

If the long run interests of Alberta are best served 
by allowing the coal industry to close down, there are some 
humanitarian aspects which favour such a policy. Coal under 
present conditions is a risky enterprise to human labour, and 
its use certainly adds to the hazards of air pollution. It is 
to be hoped that, if coal does come into demand in the future, 
better conditions for labour be made a first requisite, before 
the industry is permitted to operate.

NOTE ON CONSTRUCTION OF TABLES 1-6 


The moving averages are constructed by taking the 
twelve month total of the monthly employment averages indicated 
in table 24 of the text, for the year 1945 and placing it mid¬ 
point under the column, "sums of twelve”, illustrated below. 
Successive periods of twelve months are obtained by subtracting 
the first month of January 1945 from the first sum and adding 
January 1946. This process is continued throughout the period 
under study. The average of pairs is obtained by averaging 
adjacent pairs of sums of twelve months and this average is 
placed in the month of July to commence the series* Finally 
to obtain the trend or moving average, the average of pairs 
is divided by twelve. 


Deviations of the original monthly employment averages 
are obtained by subtracting the moving average to obtain 
either a positive or minus deviation.
