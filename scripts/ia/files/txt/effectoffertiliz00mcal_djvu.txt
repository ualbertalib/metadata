THE EFFECT OF FERTILIZERS ON 


PLANT COmPOSLTION 


R® E. A# McAllister 


INTRODUCTION 


Xt is only in the last few years that attempts 
have been mad© to include the us© of commercial fertilizers 
in the general farm practices of Alberta® The numerous 
trials that have been conducted have met with varying degrees 
of success, and would seem to Indicate there is a place for 
fertilizers In the agriculture of this province® 

Fertilizers are primarily applied to increase yields, 
but they may also have an effect which is not so physically 
obvious, namely, an effect on the composition of the plant® 

These two effects combined. Introduce problems of maintaining 
a well balanced supply of nutrients in the soil, for the 
application of on© or two nutrients usually causes increased 
utilization of others not applied® Furthermore, as plants 
and their products are valued for the constituents they contain, 
any factor, such as the application of fertilizers or variations 
In the soil, which may tend to vary the proportions of the 
elements In the plant, is worthy of consideration® It is well 
known that considerable variation occurs in the composition of

various grains and food stuffs, duo largely to variations in 
the soil and climatic conditions# At times the scarcity of 
certain elements causes serious problems in the feeding and 
breeding of livestock, examples of which may b© found in pract- 
ically every country in the world# On this continent these 
problems are of particular concern in areas of Minnesota (7), 
Wisconsin (9) and Montana (14)(18)# The problem of the last 
mentioned State is mainly lack of phosphorus in much of the 
range feed, and this condition extends into Alberta for 
ff bone-chewing” and similar indications of a shortage of phos¬ 
phorus, are reported by ranchers of Southern Alberta# Also it 
is well known that a lack of iodine occurs in parts of this 
province (17)# Besides these problems in the nutrition of 
livestock, the maintainanee of the protein content of Western 
Canada»s wheat crop is very desirable and any factor which will 
affect the protein content is worthy of consideration# 

The composition of the plant is also a good indicator 
of the utilization of various plant foods# Knowing the yield 
and having the analysis, it is possible to compute the drain 
on the soil caused by plant growth® This knowledge is valuable 
from the viewpoint of the maintainanee of fertility, for it 
permits the planning of farm practices which will not impoverish 
the soil# The possible result of years of experience by field 
trials may thus, in many cases, be forecast#

OBJECT 


The object of this study was to gain information 
on the variations in the composition of various crops grown 
with and without fertilizers* With the combined knowledge 
of the yield, the composition of the crop and the fertilizer 
applied, an attempt will be mad© to judge the effect of th© 
fertilizers on the soil, special attention being given to th© 
wooded soils* The various crops will also be considered from 
the nutritional standpoint of the elements determined® 

REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE 


The study of the effects of fertilizers on plant 
composition has been carried on for many years, by many 
investigators in different parts of the world* A large amount 
of literature has been presented recording their observations 
and conclusions* As the study has been so widespread, and 
conducted under conditions of soil and climate that ar© ex¬ 
tremely variable, it is only to b© expected that these 
observations and conclusions will differ largely* 

The application of phosphatle fertilizers in large 
amounts has been found to increase th© phosphorus content of 
plants (4)(5)(12)(20)• Light applications under some conditions

have also increased the phosphorus content (12) but under 
other conditions have not. Phosphorus has had the effect of 
depressing the nitrogen content of wheat (2) and of barley 
and clover (22), However it has also been found to increase 
the protein content of hays and grasses (lb). 

Nitrogenous fertilizers have various effects on the 
composition of the plant. Variations in equilibrium between 
nitrogen and carbohydrates are responsible for fluctuations 
in the percentage of nitrogen® Applications of nitrogen may 
decrease the protein content of wheat by increasing yields (2) 
(15), Increasing applications tend to build up excess nitr©« 
genous compounds in uhe plant for the plant is unable t© 
maintain its carbon nitrogen ratio (15), When applied during 
the growing season the later applications tend to increase the 
protein content of wheat ( 2 ), 

Th© effect of liming has been found to increase the 
availability of phosphates (5)(6)(8) and increase the percentage 
of phosphorus in the plant. 

The maintaining of the nitrogen carbohydrate ratio 
is facilitated by the application of potassium when a large 
supply of nitrogen is present, Th© potassium has th© effect 
of increasing the efficiency of the leaf as a producer of 
carbohydrates (13),

material 


The material that has been available for this 
study was collected in connection with the fertilizer work 
of the Department of Soils This Includes pot culture work, 
plot work conducted entirely by the Department and cooperative 
trials with farmers« In the latter case the application of 
the fertilizers and the harvesting of the samples was don© 
by the Department• 

The pot culture work includes studies of crops on 
two main classes of soil, the Edmonton black loam and the 
podsolie wooded loam* 

All of the samples designated l? Br©ton f * are from the 
Breton Experimental Field which is located on wooded soil* 

Of the cooperative field trials, the legumes of 
Duffield and Fallis are on wooded soil* The trials from Leduc 
and Spruce Grove are from typical black soil* 

Special consideration is given in this study to 
crops grown on the podsolie wooded loam due largely to this 
soil's low natural state of fertility* These wooded soils 
constitute a large proportion of the soils of Alberta* The 
Edmonton black loam, on the other hand, is a fertile well 
balanced parkland soil® Detailed descriptions of these soils

are available (21) but further comparison is submitted® 

The greatest difference betv/een the two soils is in the first 
foot, with the black soil containing about four times as much 
nitrogen and over twice as much phosphorus as the wooded soil* 
Considering a three foot depth, the black has almost four 
times as much nitrogen, one and one-half times as much phosphor¬ 
us and calcium, and one and one-third times as much magnesium 
as the wooded soil® However, the analysis of the wooded soil 
is comparable with many of the fertile soils of the world, 
which makes the relatively low yielding power of these soils 
rather unaccountable* The wooded soil has suffered extensive¬ 
ly from leaching, which condition is quite absent in the black 
soil*

Pot Studies 


The soil in Series 2 and 3 reported on is a typical 
wooded soil of the Pigeon Lake district (22) collected in 
1925 and 1926 from land just broken® On analysis it showed 
the presence of *114$ nitrogen, ®056$ phosphorus, *43$ calcium 
and *35$ magnesium with a pH of 6*5®

62-64 Horse manure, 50 tons per acre® 


Series 4. 

This series was started in 1951 using Edmonton black 
loam® Its analysis shows nitrogen .53%, phosphorus .10%, 
calcium .94$, magnesium .50% and a pH of 6.0. The pots received 
the following treatments: 

Pot No.

80-82 5 tons of marl (90% CaGOg) per acre® 

83-85 500 pounds of triple superphosphate (48% 

86-88 5 tons marl plus 500 pounds triple superphosphate. 

89-91 30 tons fresh horse manure. 


Series 2 was fertilized in 1925 and 1927, and since 
1925 the following yearly crops have been grown: sweet clover*

wheat, barley, wheat,Altaswede clover (second growth turned 
under), wheat, wheat and Altaswede clover* The analysis 
submitted of the Altaswede clover on Series 2 is of the last 
mentioned clover crop and from soil not fertilized since 1927, 
which had clover turned under in 1929 and has grown five crops 
since the last fertilizer application* 

Series 5 was fertilized in 1926, 1928 and 1931® 

Since 1926 the following yearly crops have been grown: barley, 
sweet clover (failure), Altaswede clover, Altaswede clover 
(second growth turned under), wheat, wheat and clover® Thus 
the clover analyzed from Series 3 is from soil last fertilized 
in 1931 and with on© wheat crop between it and the time of 
fertilizer application* 

Series 4* This series mas fertilized in 1931, during 
which year a wheat crop was grown® Thus the clover analyzed 
and reported on from this series is one year from fertilizer 
application with one wheat crop having been grown in the mean~ 
time® 


Breton Experimental Field 


This field, located near Breton, is on typical 
wooded soil* The field had been cropped for about ten years 
before fertilizers were applied and yields at that time were 
far from satisfactory* The following rotations and treatments

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 


The results obtained in this Investigation are 
recorded in Tables I to X* They consist of 1952 crop yields 
from seventy-one plots at Breton, twenty-one plots of four ©f 
the cooperative trials and three series of pot studies® The 
analytical data has been obtained from the analysis of samples 
of the crops from these various sources® Nitrogen has been 
determined on all except the pot studies® The phosphorus 
content has been determined on all samples, except three from 
Breton which were not available, and one ©©operator*s® Calcium, 
silica and ash were determined on the clovers of Series c at 
Breton® Calcium and ash were also determined on the grain from 
Series B at Breton* 


Methods 


Nitrogen was determined by the official Gunning 
method (1)* Protein on all samples Is recorded as 6*25 x 
nitrogen content*

Phosphorus was determined by the color hue trie method 
developed by Truog (14)® The sample was moistened with 10$ 
calcium acetate solution, dried, and ignited at about 700° G® 
for three hours® It was then digested with dilute HC1, follow¬ 
ing which it was made up to 500 cc® Aliquots were taken and 
read according to Truog*s method® 

Calcium, ash and silica were determined on the same 
sample® The sample was first ashed (at not over 600° C#) and 
weighed to obtain the ash content® The ash was then digested 
in cone® HC1, the insoluble portion "being filtered off and 
recorded as silica® The filtrate was made up to 500 ee® and 
aliquots used for the determination of calcium by official 
methods (1)® 


Oats, Series A, Breton, 1952 


The yields submitted in Table I, indicate a relative¬ 
ly light crop of oats with the straw yields being very low® 

They also indicate a very high percentage of grain in relation 
to the amount of straw® In general there is almost one pound 
of grain for every pound of straw® Under normal conditions 
the ratio spreads, giving one pound of grain for every 1£ or 
2 pounds of straw® This would indicate conditions on this 
Series at Breton ar® not favorable to the development of straw® 
A comparison of the checks would also appear to indicate a good 
deal of plot variation® Plot 11 has always been a better

yields furnished are that nitrogen, as applied on Plot 4 and 
Plot 10 (see Plate 1), gives the largest increases and that 
phosphorus, calcium and potassium, have a much lesser effect® 

The application of manure has not given appreciable increases® 

Effect of the Fertilizers on the 
Nitrogen Content of Oats 


On comparison with the analysis of the oat grain 
as given by Hopkins (11), or Henry and Morrison (10), the oats 
on Series A are far below normal in nitrogen content® Hopkins 
gives a normal content as 1*94$ and Henry and Morrison report 
1.98$® The oat grains from Breton are thus lacking up to 35$ 
of their normal protein content, a condition which should b© 
considered in their use as feeds® The lowest percentage of 
nitrogen is found in Plot 4, which received the largest appli- 
cation of nitrogen® Also other plots receiving nitrogen, namely 
Plots 3 and 10 show decreases in the nitrogen content© 

The application of phosphorus, calcium and potassium 
have not increased the nitrogen content, but the application 
of manure, as on Plots 2 and 9 has yielded the two highest 
nitrogen contents, viz® 1*35$ and 1®4Y$ respectively*

In the consideration of the straw from these plots, 
the fluctuations in the percentage of nitrogen, follow very 
closely the variation in the grain* These straws are exceed¬ 
ingly below normal in regards to the nitrogen or protein 
content* Hopkins (11), and Henry and Morrison (10) report 
average composition for oat straw as *62 % and *58$ respectively* 
As a feed this Breton straw has serious limitations* 

The Relationship Between Yield and th© 

Nitrogen Content of Oats 


Increases In yield are accompanied very consistently 
with decreases in the nitrogen content of the grain® This is 
graphically illustrated in Pig® 1 where the fluctuations In 
total yield are compared with the fluctuations in th® percentage 
of nitrogen in the grain® There Is only one definite exception, 
that of the application of lime plus phosphorus® Her© an 
Increase In yield is accompanied by a slight Increase in 
nitrogen® The highest yielding crop, that of Plot 4, has th© 
lowest nitrogen content, indicating exceptionally efficient 
utilization of the nitrogen present* This is also noticed in 
Plots 3 and 10* The plots receiving manure show more extr&va- 
gent use of the nitrogen than any of the other plots in this 
Series* There Is no relationship between the application of 
phosphorus and the nitrogen content® These results would

appear to indicate any fertilizer substantially increasing 
growth, increases the efficient use of nitrogen in the plant# 

Removal of Nitrogen by the Oat Crop 


The figures along the top of Pig# 1 indicate the 
amount of nitrogen removed from the soil per acre# The amount 
of nitrogen removed varies directly with the yield in all cases, 
except Plot 2 where the manure depressed the yield but increased 
the nitrogen content sufficiently to cause greater removal of 
that element than from Plot 1# 

Considering the plots which received a nitrogen 
fertilizer, and observing the utilization of the nitrogen 
applied it is found that Plot 5 received 10 pounds of nitrogen 
and the crop removed 17#5® Averaging Checks 1 and 5, they 
removed 14*8 pounds® Subtracting this from 17#5 indicates the 
utilization of 2*5 pounds or 25$ of the nitrogen applied, which 
is low utilization* Plot 4 received 20 pounds of nitrogen, 25 
were removed in the crop, and calculated as above, 41$ of the 
nitrogen applied is utilized; this being a more desirable 
condition* Similarly Plot 10, on comparison with even Plot 11 
which is above average as a check, made us© of 29$ of the 10 
pounds of nitrogen it received* Compared with other checks 
this percentage is still higher# This would seem to indicate 
in the comparison of Plots 3 and 10 that potassium has not

increased the use of nitrogen. 

The effect of the manure on the nitrogen content 
has been to increase the percentage of nitrogen in the grain 
and straw, there being no appreciable effect on th© yield* This 
would suggest that later in the season when nitrogen was not so 
able to act as a growth stimulant, the manure was decomposing' 
allowing the formation of nitrates which resulted in a higher 
nitrogen content in the grain and straw (2)* 

The total amounts of nitrogen removed by this oat 
crop (see Pig* 1) indicate very clearly the inability of this 
wooded soil to supply enough nitrogen to raise a good crop of 
oats* According to Hopkins (11) a heavy crop of oats, namely 
100 bushels and 2.5 tons of straw of normal composition, 
requires 96 pounds of nitrogen per acre* The maximum removed 
from any Breton oat plot is 25*4 pounds per aer©| in other words 
the Breton soil has only been able to furnish one quarter as 
much nitrogen as furnished by really fertile soil* Furthermore, 
any increase in yield is made at the expense of the protein 
content of the grain* 

Effect of Application of Phosphorus on th© 

Yield and Quality of Oats 


The application of phosphorus has not had much effect 


on the yield. When applied alone the yield was not increased.

but when used in combination with lime some increase is noted® 
When it is applied with nitrogen the yield is further increased, 
but this is more attributable to the nitrogen® 

It cannot be said that the phorphorus has increased 
the protein content of the grain for phosphorus was applied on 
Plot 3 which produced a very low protein crop, and on Plot 9 
which produced the highest protein crop® Thus it may be said 
there is no relationship between the supply of phosphorus and 
the protein content (see Table I and Fig® 1)® 

Relationship Between the Phosphorus Content 
and the Yield of Oats 


The phosphorus content of the grain and straw vary 
directly with each other for the different treatments® The 
straw, however, has-a greater percentage variation for it varies 
between *012% and *583^, while the grain varies between «364 % 
and *438^ (see Table I}® 

There is, also, an inverse relationship between the 
yield and the percentage phosphorus in the grain® The lowest 
yielding plot (Plot 5) has the highest phosphorus content, and 
the highest yielding plot (Plot 4) has almost the lowest content® 
4 ny increase in yield has caused a greater reduction in the 
phosphorus content of the straw than it has in the grain®

However on Plot 4 the phosphorus content has been greatly 
reduced but still is not seriously below normal® 

Hopkins ( 11 ) gives normal contents, of .32$ for oat 
grain and . 1 $ for oat straw® Henry and Morrison (10) record 
*33$ for grain and J382 for straw® Thus it is seen that all the 
grains are considerably above normal, and all the straws are 
very much above normal except those of Plots 1 and 4, which a w 
close to normal* Thus from a study of the yields and the 
phosphorus content of these oats, phosphorus does not appear to 
limit the yields but rather a shortage of nitrogen is the cause® 

Utilization of Phosphorus by the Oat Crop® 


From the discussion immediately above it may be 
observed that the crops of the higher yielding plots have 
utilized their phosphorus more efficiently® 

CP 

From a comparison of the percentage of phosphorus in 
the oat crop and the application of phosphorus (see Table I) 
no correlation is apparent between them which suggests the 
phosphorus applied has not been used to advantage® The follow-* 
ing amounts of phosphorus have been removed from the various 
plots•

The amount of phosphorus removed varies from 5*1 to 10•! 
pounds per acre. Plot 3 received approximately 20 pounds of 
phosphorus per acre, and only 6.6 pounds were removed in the 
crop* An average of the checks shows removal of 6.5 pounds® 
This would indicate that practically none of the phorphorus 
in the fertilizer was used. Plot 10 also received 20 pounds 
of phosphorus and its crop removed 9.8 pounds from the soil* 

On comparison with the checks this gives a utilization of the 
phosphorus applied of about 17$ which is low. Plots 7 and 8 
received about 25 pounds of phosphorus per acre, and they show 
that approxImately 3$ and 2.5$ of the fertilizer applied was 
used. This only emphasizes that phosphorus is not a limiting 
element for this oat crop. 

Wheat, Series B and F, Breton, 1932 


On Series B the wheat crop is immediately following 
a clover crop which was plowed down in 1931® The crop, thus 
has at its disposal a larger amount of plant nutrients than 
are present in any of the other Series. The effect of this 
extra plant food was very apparent throughout the growing season, 
for the wheat crop was at all times, taller, heavier and 
healthier than the oat crop beside it, on Series A. The 
comparison was very striking® The same comparison could be 
mad© of the wheat over the barley on Series B®

In the early growth stages on Series B all the plots 
receiving phosphorus or lime had a dark color and a fin© 
healthy appearance# The untreated plots and the nitrogen plot 
(Plot 4) were distinctly yellowish® 

Table II contains th© yields and analysis of the 
plots of Series B and also contains the same data for the short 
Series P® This latter series had no clover turned under, for 
the clover crop was allowed to ripen for seed, and was removed© 

Yields from Series B and P 


From a study of the oats from Series A it was evident 
that nitrogen was the limiting element, so It may be anticipated 
that the large amounts of nitrogen and th© other plant foods 
derived from the clover turned under in 1933, will give a decided 
increase in the wheat crop® As may be seen by Table II these 
larger yields are realized® By a comparison of Series B and 
Series F (Table II) some of the increase, actually due th© 
clover turned under, may be determined® Th© yield on Plot IB 
has been practically doubled over that of Plot IF, correspond¬ 
ing Increases are also noted for Plots 3 and 4 of Series B# 

From a further study of Table II and Fig® 2 it appears 
that nitrogen is no longer th© large limiting factor on Series 
B, for an application of nitrogen alone (Plot 4) has not 
materially increased the yield* The larger increases are all

from plots receiving phosphorus, calcium or manure® The 
combinations of manure and phosphorus (Plot 9) and of nitrogen, 
phosphorus and potassium (Plot 3) have given the very satisfactory 
yields of 45*9 and 43*1 bushels per acre® The application of 
phosphorus alone has given an increase of 1G®8 bushels of grain, 
and ammonium phosphate 15®5® It will be noted that all the 
higher yields are combinations of nitrogen and phosphorus® With 
the presence of nitrogen and phosphorus in sufficient amounts 
to sustain heavy crops, the application of potassium is apparent-* 
ly beginning to increase yield, for a comparison of Plots 3 and 
10 shows an increase of 8 # 4 bushels of grain and 1115 pounds 
of straw from Plot 3 over Plot 10® Plots 3 and 10 received the 
same amount of nitrogen and phosphorus per acre and by reference 
to Table XXA received practically the same amounts of clover in 
1931® This would make it appear that this extra increase is 
largely due to potassium® The application of manure alone shows 
a fair increase in yield and a very substantial increase when 
applied with phosphorus®

Table 1XA* A Balance Sheet for Nitrogen and Phosphorus on Series B« 1932 

























I I 












►2 a 


1931, which was plowed down, and the amounts of the fertilizers 
applied in 1932# The amount of nitrogen that was supplied by 
the 1931 clover (Series B) crop was determined by analysis, 
but this crop was not analyzed for phosphorus* In order to 
convey some idea of the amount of phosphorus supplied by the 
1931 clover crop the phosphorus content of the 1932 clover crop 
(Series G) is placed In the table* These latter figures are 
considered comparable as both crops received the same fertilizers 
and much the same treatment* There is one exception to the 
fertilizer treatments and that is in the case of manure# Manure 
was applied in 1930 to Series C and in 1930 and 1932 to Series 
B* The table does not show the amounts of nitrogen and phosphor® 
us supplied by the manure* The 22 ton application of manure 
should supply 44 pounds ©f phosphorus and 220 pounds of nitrogen* 
These nutrients are not as readily available as In the prepared 
fertilizers applied but the effect of the manure is noticeable 
as indicated by Table IX and Table XXA® 

A certain amount of nitrogen and phosphorus Is 
necessary for normal plant growth, and when the ratio between 
them becomes changed It may be assumed that one Is lacking in 
proportion to the other, thus limiting plant growth* Hopkins 
(11) has recorded the amounts of nitrogen and phosphorus necessary 
for normal growth and a good yield* He says a 50 bushel crop 
of wheat accompanied with 2-g- tons of straw, requires 96 pounds 
of nitrogen and 16 pounds of phosphorus* Considering Plot 1 
(Table XXA) its crop removed 45 pounds of nitrogen which is

capable of producing about a 24 bushel crop of wheat, and 10*9 
pounds of phosphorus which is capable of producing a 34 bushel 
crop. In spite of the fact that there has been a large increase 
in the nitrogen available to this crop, nitrogen still would 
seom to be the more limiting factor* Similarly on Plots 5 and 
11 the crops have not been receiving enough nitrogen to balance 
the phosphorus they contain* These plots also show practically 
no nitrogen balance. Some extra nitrogen, not shown by Table HA, 
was supplied by the roots of the 1931 clover crop* However, 
as nitrogen is readily lost from the soil, no reserve likely 
remains* Thus future crop increases due to nitrogen from the 
clover can hardly be expected on these check plots* 

A further consideration of the possible yield based 
on the nitrogen and phosphorus in the crop show that all the 
plots except Plot 3, contain enough phosphorus for yields 
higher than were realized* The following tabulation indicates 
this*

Prom the standpoint of the nitrogen that is present 
in the crop, the yields realized from all the plots receiving 
phosphorus or marl are greater than those expected* This 
suggests that the phosphorus and marl make for more efficient 
utilization of the nitrogen* In Plot 4 J s crop there is enough 
phosphorus present for a much higher yield and enough nitrogen 
present for a slightly higher yield than that realized. The 
nitrogen balance on this plot is very high, an ample amount 
seems available (Table IIA), but there has been a drain on the 
phosphorus in the soil as shown by the phosphorus balance 
(Table IIA). Thus in the presence of what appears to be a 
nitrogen reserve, and a phosphorus deficit, it seems that 
phosphorus is limiting this plot f s yield, even though there has 
been apparently extravagent use of the phosphorus in the crop* 
As soon as phosphorus is applied the yield increases, as is 
shown by Plot 10* 

It is also likely that other elements may be lacking 
and limiting yield on this series. This probability may be 
examined by consideration of Plot 5* This plot did not receive 
as much nitrogen as Plots 4, 7, 8 and 1*0 yet it removed the 
second largest amount in the second highest yield® This is the 
only plot where the yield has been greater than expected from 
both the nitrogen and the phosphorus in the crop® The nitrogen 
and phosphorus have both been efficiently used* The fact that 
there is a shortage of phosphorus on Plots 7, 8 and 10 does 
not seem reasonable in the face of the phosphorus reserves that 





-31 


are present on those plots® Also the fact that the nitrogen 
reserves on these are higher than on Plot 3 would seem t© 
indicate no shortage of nitrogen in them* Therefor© the 
increase in yield of Plot 3 seems due to the presence of 
potassium® Plot 9 supports this suggestion by its high yield, 
and relatively small nitrogen balance, for in the manure 9 
potassium and other elements ar© supplied* 

By varying the amounts of clover plowed down the 
following situations appear to arise* When the smaller 
amounts of clover ar© turned under (see Table XIA, Plots l f 
5 and 11) the nitrogen balance has been lost or badly reduced 
by the following crop, and the phosphorus balance has been 
badly depleted* Increasing the supply of nitrogen does not 
materially increase the yields as is seen by Plot 4* As 
soon as phosphorus is applied (Plot 8) the yields increase 
greatly® This would seem to indicate a lack of phosphorus 
on the check plots and Plot 4, even though the grain and straw 
from these plots is very high in that element® With the demand 
for phosphorus satisfied nitrogen now becomes a limiting factor 
as is evidenced by the increase in yield in Plot 10 over that 
of Plot 8* This shortage of nitrogen would be felt much 
sooner on the check plots, for they had much less clover plowed 
down in 1931, than Plots 8 and 10 (Table XXA)® When the large 
amounts of clover are plowed down and phosphorus applied (Plots 
7, 8 and 10) the yields are not as great as those of Plots 3 
and 9 f thus indicating that potassium and possibly other elements

have become limiting factors* It now appears that phosphorus, 
nitrogen and potassium are all limiting factors when high 
yields are desired at Breton* Calcium is also a limiting 
factor as shown by the increased yield and by it causing more 
efficient utilization of the nitrogen* 

Some very interesting comparisons may be drawn from 
Table XXA on the relative amounts of nitrogen and phosphorus 
removed by the wheat and clover crops* It will be seen that 
an unfertilized wheat crop following an unfertilized clover 
crop, which was plowed down, removes just as much or more 
nitrogen, than was present in the clover crop® Also the 1932 
wheat crop has taken more phosphorus out of the check plots 
than did the clover* This extra amount of phosphorus removed 
by the wheat from the checks of Series B Is almost as much as 
was removed from some of the plots in Series D by the barley 
crop* Even though clover is a deeper feeder and is usually 
considered as a heavier feeder on phosphorus than wheat, it 
does not supply, as a green manure crop, enough phosphorus to 
meet the demands of the wheat crop following It* Only when 
phosphorus has been applied to the clover crop does the clover 
return enough phosphorus to the soil to meet the demands of 
the following wheat crop*

Nitrogen Content of Wheat, Series B® 


Fig# 2 illustrates graphically fluctuations in 
the yield and the nitrogen content of the wheat grain® The 
nitrogen content of the straw is given in Table II and it 
will be seen that the fluctuations in the straw correspond 
closely to those in the wheat, but the percentage of variation 
is greater in the straw# 

From Fig# 2 It Is seen the check plots are all 
high in nitrogen while the yields are relatively low# Th© 
addition of a lot of nitrogen with little increase In yield 
(Plot 4) has given a high nitrogen content# The two highest 
yielding plots are relatively low In their nitrogen content® 

A report from the Board of Grain Commissioners (5) 
places the protein content of average Alberta wheat grading 
No. 2 and No# 5 at 12#9$® By placing this grain from Series 
B on the same basis (N x 5®Y on 13®5^ moisture basis) Plots 
1, 4, 5 ? 10 and 11 are from 2 to 3 % above average® Plots 2 
and 3 are about 1 % below average and the rest are close t© 
a normal protein content# A normal nitrogen content for straw 
is about #5 %. From Table II it will be seen that in general 
the high yielding crops are all low In the percentage of 
nitrogen in their straws®

Calcium and Ash Content of Wheat, Series B* 


Wolff (19) places the calcium content of wheat at 
•04$ • Judged by this standard all of the wheat from Series 
B is on the low side® The higher yielding crops (see Table 
II) have been considerably reduced in their percentage of 
calcium® The application of calcium on Plot 6 has apparently 
maintained the calcium content in the face of increased yield* 
It would appear that calcium is not over supplied by these 
plots and benefits could be obtained by its application® 

The percentage of ash (see Table II) varies very 
little in the grain from all the plots, except Plot 3, where 
the ash content is distinctly lower® This is a high yielding 
plot and it would seem that this plot is utilizing its mineral 
matter more efficiently® 

Phosphorus Content of the Wheat and Stra?? 
of Series B© 


Hopkins (11) places the percentage of phosphorus in 
wheat and wheat straw at ®4$ and .08$ respectively® It will 
be seen by Table II that, excepting Plot 3 which is about 
normal, all the grains are very high in phosphorus® The 
percentage of phosphorus in the straws are also high on all 
plots except Plots 2, 7 and 8 which are normal, and Plot 3

which is distinctly low# 

There seems to be no close correlation between yield 
and the percentage of phosphorus in the grain, for high and 
low yielding crops are both high in phosphorus content# It 
would appear, however, that Plot 3 has utilized its phosphorus 
more efficiently# The percentage of phosphorus in the straw 
fluctuates a great deal and it would appear there is soma 
inverse correlation between yield and the phosphorus content 
of the straw, but this does not hold true for Plots 7 and 8® 

The percentage of phosphorus in the straw does, however, appear 
to be related to the stage of maturity of the crop® In order 
of maturity Plot 8 is first by several days # Plots 7 and 3 are 
next, and the rest of the series were noticeably greener# This 
seems to indicate that as the crop ripens the percentage of 
phosphorus in the straw decreases® 

Clover, Series C, Breton, 1932 


The yields and analytical data for this series, are 
to be found in Table III® This clover consisted of a mixture 
of a Is ike and white s?/eet clover® The proportions of the two 
clovers varied from plot to plot, but on the separate analysis 
of these crops from Series H it was found the phosphorus content 
is of the same order for both clovers and the nitrogen content 
is only slightly lower in the alsike® These variations ar© not

considered sufficient to consider the mixture as other than 
one uniform crop from the standpoint of analysis* 

The barley crop was omitted in 1931 so this clover 
did not have a nurse crop In that year* A good uniform stand 
was obtained# 

It will be noted there Is a great deal of variation 
in the yields of the various plots due to the various treatments# 
In several cases the yield has been Increased to over three 
times that of the lowest check* The yields of these plots have 
been influenced to some extent by variations in the relative 
amounts of the two clovers grown* Increases in the percentage 
of sweet clover present would tend to give heavier yields* for 
the sweet clover is a larger plant than the aIsike# This point 
is demonstrated by Plot 11 where the proportion of sweet clover 
was greatly increased over that of Plots 1 and 5, the higher 
yield being thus obtained in Check 11# In other years Check 
11 in this series has not been a high yielding check* 

By reference to Table III it appears all fertilizers 
are giving increases with the phosphorus giving large increases 
alone or in combination* This situation is just the opposite 
of that present on the oats (Series A)* 

The application of manure alone has increased the yield 
of clover over Cheek 1, but is slightly less than the average 
(1700 pounds) of all the checks# When the manure was applied 
with phosphorus it gave a further increase of 300 pounds over 
phosphorus alone which is hardly significant* Nitrogen alone

has given the next larger increase, followed by marl on Plot 
6 (ref# Table III)# The five remaining plots (Plots 3, 7, 8, 

9 and 10) all receiving phosphorus gave still higher yields# 

The yields of the checks and the manure plot are all consider** 
ed low; the yield for the application of nitrogen alone is 
medium; and the remaining yields are considered good# 

Further mention should be made of the proportions 
of the two clovers on these plots# The application of marl 
stimulated the growth of both clovers but especially that of 
the sweet clover# On Plots 7, 8* 9 and 10, all of which 
received phosphorus, both clovers did very well with the sweet 
clover predominating# On Plot 5 the percentage of sweet clover 
was not as great but the alsike was very good# Plots 1 and 5 
consisted largely of alsike, both clovers being distinctly poor# 
From these observations it would appear the sweet clover is a 
very good indicator crop on the Breton soil# 

The quality of this clover is considered from the 
standpoint of the nitrogen or protein, phosphorus and calcium 
contents, as secured by the analysis submitted in Table III# 

Nitrogen Content of Clover 


Considering the nitrogen content of the crops (see 
Fig* 3) we find a very sharp increase in the nitrogen content 
of the crop from Plot 3, which received nitrogen plus phosphorus

plus potassium* This is also accompanied toy a high yield* 
Compared with Plot 10 which received the same amounts of 
phosphorus and nitrogen as Plot 3, it would appear that potassium 
had a very strong effect on the nitrogen content* 

The effect of marl has toeen to decrease the percent¬ 
age of nitrogen* although growth has toeen greatly increased* 

This suggests very economical use of the nitrogen in the plant© 
The application of nitrogen on Plot 4* increased yields 
considerably tout did not increase the nitrogen content mater¬ 
ially* Neither does manure increase the percentage of nitrogen* 
The remaining Plots 7* 8, 9 and 10 are only slightly above the 
check plots in their percentage of nitrogen# 

The percentage of nitrogen in normal clover as 
recorded toy Hopkins (11) is 2*G$® Henry and Morrison (10) 
record the percentages of nitrogen as 2*05 and 2*32 for alsike 
and sweet clover respectively* Thus the nitrogen content of 
the clovers from all of the plots of Series C are approximately 
normal with the exception of Plot 3 which is practically 50$ 
above normal* 


Phosphorus Content of Clover 


The consideration of quality from the standpoint 
of the phosphorus content reveals considerable fluctuation 
for the different treatments* The two crops lowest in phosphorus

are the ones which received nitrogen alone and marl alone# 
These crops (Plots 4 and 6) are considerably below all the 
rest, and apparently the low phosphorus content is due to 
increased yield with a shortage of available phosphorus# This 
has forced a more economical use of the phosphorus in the 
plant# All plots receiving phosphorus which are also accom« 
panied by large increases in yield have considerably higher 
phosphorus contents# Here the supply of phosphorus has 
apparently been sufficient to keep up with growth# This is 
further corroborated by the check plots, where yield has not 
been increased and the phosphorus content has remained on a 
level equal to that of plots receiving phosphorus# 

The application of manure has had much the same 
effect as the nitrogen application, although on a smaller 
scale, for a slight increase in yield is accompanied by a 
decrease in the phosphorus content# 

There are only two plots (4 and 6) on this series 
yielding crops slightly below normal in phosphorus content© 
Henry and Morrison (10) and Hopkins (11) place the normal 
phosphorus contents of these clovers as ranging from #25$ to 
#28$. The balance of the plots produce clovers close to and 
above normal in phosphorus content#

Calcium Content of the Clover 


The normal percentage of calcium in alsike clover 
hay is about 1.0% and sweet clover will contain from 1.2% 
to 1*4$£ in normal crops* From the figures submitted in 
Table III It will be seen that the calcium content of Series 
C clover is close to normal with the crops of Plots 5 and 8 
a little on the low side* Apparently the plants are getting 
all the calcium they require from the soil for even the 
largest increases in yield give only slight depressions in 
the calcium content* Also the check crops are slightly above 
the rest in their calcium content, even slightly above normal* 
Greater total amounts of calcium, however, are t© 
be found in the crops from the high yielding plots* The 
approximate amounts of calcium removed per acre are as follows

These relative amounts are indicative of the calcium 
that was returned to the soil by the plowing down of this 
clover* Some of the higher yielding plots have returned three 
times as much as low yielding checks*

Ash Content in Clover 


The ash content is indicative of the amount of 
mineral matter in the crop® The applications of the various 
fertilizers have caused no large variations in the ash content* 
This indicates that the elements supplied have not been con¬ 
centrated in the plants* It would also indicate that even 
when yield is Increased two and three times the plant Is still 
using a proportionate amount of minerals* The average ash 
content of aisike and sweet clover are given (10) as 8*3^ and 
8*t$* Apparently this clover at Breton is using as much 
mineral matter as normal plants* 

Silica Content of Clover 


From Table III it will be seen that the check plots 
and the plot receiving manure alone, are all high in the 
amount of silica they contain* There is also a general In¬ 
verse correlation with yield and the silica content* The 
lowest yielding plots are the highest in silica* It appears 
that manure when applied with phosphorus has Increased the 
silica content over some of the other high yielding plots* 

The total amounts of silica removed per acre are greatest from 
the check plots and those receiving manure*

Mather (12) found indications of an increased 
utilization of silica in cases of phosphorus deficiencies* 

He also reports much greater variations* The plots on Series 
C which received phosphorus all yielded crops lower in silica 
than the checks. But Plot 4, receiving nitrogen and no 
phosphorus* also gave a low silica content in its.crop* This 
would appear to indicate the silica content varies indirectly 
with yield, rather than phosphorus applications, under Breton 
conditions* 

Accumulation of Nitrogen in the Clover Crop 


The practice of green manuring helps to conserve 
plant food constituents, increase the organic matter and soil 
nitrogen, improve the soil texture and influence the soil 
microorganisms. The use of a legume crop as green manure is 
of particular value because through the agency of symbiotic 
bacteria it is able to fix the free nitrogen of the air* 
Although the legumes are also highly valued from the standpoint 
of conserving other plant foods, they are of particular value 
in increasing the store of nitrogen# 

The following tabulation gives the amounts of 
nitrogen in pounds per acre that have been accumulated by the 
clover crop in the above ground portion of the plants;

These amounts are also placed on Fig* 3. 

The accumulation of nitrogen bears a relationship 
with the yield. The high yielding plots have the most nitrogen 
in their crops, thus any factor which will increase yield and 
not seriously reduce the nitrogen content will increase the 
value of the clover. &om@ idea of the extra amounts of nitrogen 
accumulated through the various treatments may b© obtained by 
comparison with the checks® The average of the three checks 
shows 34.7 pounds of nitrogen in the clover per acre® Thus it 
is seen that some of the plots have almost three and in on© case 
four times as much nitrogen stored in their crops. This extra 
accumulation of nitrogen is obtained from three sources* the 
soil, symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria, and the nitrogenous 
fertilizers. The amount supplied by the fertilizers is known; 
a portion of the amount from the soil is indicated by the 
amount the checks contain, but the checks have also obtained 
some from the air. Thus the large amounts on the fertilized 
plots are due to extra feeding power by larger root systems, 
and increased nitrogen fixation® In all probability the 
application of phosphorus stimulates the nitrogen-fixing organ¬ 
isms® It would also appear that the marl makes conditions more

suitable for the nitrogen-fixing bacteria* The manure is 
the only fertilizer that has not had a decidedly positive 
effect on the accumulation of nitrogen. 

Utilization of Phosphorus by the Clover Crop 


The amounts of phosphorus in pounds per acre removed 
by the clover crop are as follows:

Checks 1 and 5 have had the same amount of phosphorus 
removed by their crops, but Check 11 has had more due to the 
heavier clover crop* An average of the check plots shows 5.1 
pounds of phosphorus removed by the unfertilized crop* Of the 
remaining plots all but one (Plot 2) show substantial increases 
in the amount of phosphorus in the plants. 

By comparing the amounts of phosphorus applied, with 
the amounts in the plant some idea may b© obtained of the 
amount of fertilizer utilized* Plot 3 received approximately 
20 pounds of phosphorus* Its crop contained 12*3 pounds* 
Deducting 5.1 as supplied by the soil, the remainder is 7.2 
pounds, and considered as being supplied mainly by the fertilizer* 






































































-49 


This is a percentage utilization of 36 % which is fairly good* 
Plots 7 , 8, 9 and 10 similarly have utilized 37 %, 35 %, 42 % and 
43 % of the phosphorus they received. Actually the percentage 
is lower than this for some phosphorus is likely obtained from 
the soil by the more vigorous root system which has been 
developed. This probability is substantiated by Plot 4 from 
which 2.4 pounds of phosphorus in excess of 5.1 pounds have been 
removed by the larger growth. The marl also has had the effect 
of removing an additional 4.3 pounds of phosphorus, thus liming 
these soils has the effect of increasing the amount of phosphor¬ 
us removed by the crop (6) (8). 

Apparently wherever phosphorus has been applied it 
has been utilized to approximately the same extent. As phos¬ 
phorus is only negligibly lost from the soil by processes other 
than cropping, the actual percentage of phosphorus in the soil 
has been increased by the application of phosphatie fertilizers, 
for in no case on Series C was the amount removed in the crop 
greater than that applied. A residual effect may thus be 
expected. 


Barley, Series D, Breton, 1932 


In 1931 a change was made in the rotation and barley 
was grown in the place of oats. This 1932 crop is thus barley

The yields and analytical data for thi 3 series 
are submitted in Table IV and Fig® 4® 

The yields of this series are all relatively low® 

The largest increases are from the plots receiving nitrogen, 
i®e * Plots 3, 4, 10 and from Plot 9 which received manure plus 
phosphorus® Phosphorus alone has not Increased the yield; 
neither has the marl® The manure on this series does have a 
beneficial effect. Thus it would appear that nitrogen is the 
plant food most required for this crop on this series® 

A comparison of the pounds of grain in relation to 
the pounds of straw produced per acre is of interest® All of 
the plots, except Plots 3 and 7, produce practically as much 
grain as straw® Plots 3 and 7 produce about two pounds of 
grain for every three pounds of straw, which ratio is much 
closer to that of normal crops® This would serve to indicate 
that this soil can not support much vegetative growth due 
largely to the lack of nitrogen® 

Effect of Fertilizers on the Nitrogen Content 
of Barley 


The analytical data for the barley grain and straw 
are recorded in Table IV and the nitrogen content of the 
grain together with the yield of grain are plotted in Fig®

content of the straw correspond in a general way with the 
variations in the grain* Also it may be noted that the 
nitrogen content of the barley grain fluctuates in much the 
same manner as the oats, (see Pig* !)• 

The two plots which received manure have produced 
the barley with the highest nitrogen content* The crop that 
received phosphorus has the same nitrogen content as the 
average of the three check crops* All the other treatments 
have reduced the protein content of the grain* 

There is a certain amount of correlation between 
yields and the percentage of nitrogen in the grain, but it is 
not as distinct as for the oat crop* The two lowest protein- 
content grains are from the two plots (5 and 4) which yielded 
the most produce per acre* 

While there are relatively large increases in the 
protein or nitrogen content of the grain of some plots over 
those of other plots, all of the barley from this series is 
below normal, judged by the standards of Wolff (19) 1*6$ and 
Henry and Morrison 1 s (10) 1*84^* From the standpoint of feed 
this is a disadvantage* However in the brewing industry a 
barley of low protein content is desirable, and plot samples 
of this barley have been tested by the Canada Malting and 
Brewing Company who reported on them very favorably* 

Barley straw is not often used as feed, but if used 
for that purpose the straw from Series D has a serious shortage 
of protein* The protein content is less than half that in

Utilization of Nitrogen by the Barley Crop 


Some idea of the amount of nitrogen per acre removed 
from the soil by the barley crop may be obtained from the 
following tabulation* These amounts are also placed on Fig* 4*

As it might be expected the lower yielding plots have 
the least amount of nitrogen removed by their crops and vice 
versa* The application of manure alone (Plot 2) has increased 
the removal of nitrogen by 7*5 pounds over Plot 1* When manure 
Is applied with phosphorus It has increased the removal of 
nitrogen from Plot 9 over that from the phosphorus plot (Plot 
8) by 10*8 pounds* Marl alone or phosphorus alone have not 
increased the utilization of nitrogen* Wherever nitrogen has 
been applied, even as manure, the amount of nitrogen in the 
crop Is increased* On comparing the amount of nitrogen in the 
crops from Plots 5 and 4 with the average from checks. Plots 
1 and 5, an increased removal of 5*1 pounds and 4*S pounds is 
noted* Plot 5 received an application of 10 pounds of nitrogen

and Plot 4 received 20 pounds* r J?he percentages of the 
nitrogen applied that have been utilized are 51$ and 22.5$. 
Plot 10 which also received 10 pounds of nitrogen shows a 
percentage utilization of 36$ by comparison with Check II and 
57$ when compared with the average of Checks 5 and 11. The 
percentage utilization is good on Plot 3 and Plot 10 but poor 
on Plot 4. This situation suggests that any application of 
nitrogen over 10 pounds is wasted unless the other elements 
are also increased. 

Utilization of Phosphorus by the Barley Crop 


The percentages of phosphorus in the grain and straw 
from Series D are shown in Table IV# It will be seen that 
the grain is relatively high in phosphorus, a normal percent¬ 
age being about .34$ (19). The percentage of phosphorus in 
the straw varies a great deal more than that of the grain. A 
normal phosphorus content for straw is about .072$. Thus the 
srtraw from several of the plots is about twice normal. 

The application of manure has increased the phosphor¬ 
us content of both the grain and the straw more than any other 
treatment . By applying phosphorus alone the content of that 
element in the plant has been increased over that of the 
untreated crops. The application of marl has yielded grain 








»56«* 


that is lower in phosphorus than any other treatment* The 
nitrogen fertilizer applied on Plot 4 has lowered the phos¬ 
phorus content of the straw to the greatest extent, the grain 
content being about that of the check crops* In spite of 
these fluctuations none of the crops are below normal* At 
their present yield, phosphorus is not a limiting factor but 
where the yield has been Increased and no phosphorus applied, 
as in Plot 4, the phosphorus has been more economically used* 
If the yields were Increased further, phosphorus would likely 
become a limiting factor* 

The following amounts of phosphorus have been 
removed per acre by the crops from their respective plots:

The amount of phosphorus that has been taken from the phosphatic 
fertilizers le relatively small* By comparing the amount 
removed from Plot 5 with the average sectored from the check 
Plots 1 and 5, it is found that only 2 pounds or 10 % of the 
20 pounds supplied has been taken up in the plant* This does 
not allow for any that may have been taken up due to the stronger 
root system of Plot 3*s crop* Similarly all the other plots 





















- 57 ~ 


that received phosphorus show very poor use of that element* 
Plot 8, which received only phosphorus apparently has not 
used any of the fertilizer* 

Considering Series D from all the points discussed 
it may he said that nitrogen is the element that is the most 
lacking; that phosphorus will not increase yield unless 
supplied with nitrogen or calcium, preferably the former* 

Yields and Composition of Alfalfa, 1932 


Table ¥ gives the treatments, yields and composition 
of the first 1932 cutting of alfalfa grown at Breton and 
Duffield® The soil at DuffieId, while classified as a wooded 
soil, is of a better type than the Breton wooded soil* However 
on both soils the yields of alfalfa were quite good* 

It will.be seen that on Series H at Breton the yields 
are all high* Due to variations in the stand the yields 
obtained are not significant, they do not correspond to the 
field observations, excepting that the marl plus ammonium 
phosphate plot gave the best crop* 

The nitrogen content of Series H alfalfa is very 
clos e to normal and no significant differences are present* 

The phosphorus content, however, shows differences due appar¬ 
ently to the fertilizers® The check crop has the lowest

phosphorus content# The plot that received marl shows a 
significant increase in phosphorus content# Apparently the 
marl has increased the availability of phosphorus (6)* The 
marl and ammonium phosphate has further increased the phos¬ 
phorus content# The extra phosphorus applied as fertilizer 
has apparently increased the phosphorus content of the alfalfa# 
The alfalfa that received ammonium phosphate has the highest 
phosphorus content# It would thus appear that as the plots 
are already high yielders the application of phosphorus has 
tended to increase the phosphorus content of the alfalfa# 
Hopkins (11) has set a normal phosphorus percentage for the 
alfalfa at #225$. Thus the check and marl plots are slightly 
below normal and the others slightly above normal# 

At Duffield the applications of phosphorus were made 
in 1931 and the nitrogen applications were made in 1932# The 
phosphorus appears to have increased the yield by a small 
amount# The application of nitrogen has given considerable 
increase when applied alone* but not when applied with the 
phosphorus# As the yields are already large no big differences 
could be expected# 

A study of the nitrogen contents indicate that this 
alfalfa from Duffield is higher in nitrogen than the Breton 
alfalfa# A normal protein content is about 15#6$>, thus all 
this alfalfa is considerably above normal. The application

of phosphorus has not significantly affected the nitrogen 
content, hut when nitrogen was applied with phosphorus there 
is apparently a tendency to increase the nitrogen content. 

The application of nitrogen alone has slightly Increased the 
percentage of nitrogen even though the yield was increased. 

The phosphorus percentages of the Duffield alfalfa 
show considerable fluctuation and all are above normal. The 
high phosphorus content is found in the crops from the plots 
which received phosphorus. The lowest percentage of phosphor¬ 
us is in the alfalfa which received the nitrogen. Apparently 
the increased yield due to the nitrogen has caused more 
efficient use of the phosphorus in the crop. 

From a study of the alfalfa from Breton and Duffield 
it would appear that while the yield is only slightly Increased, 
the application of phosphorus tends to increase the phosphorus 
content of the alfalfa. Also, that the application of nitrogen, 
causing increases in the yield, will depress the phosphorus 
content *

fact that Series P received a partial summerfallowing and 
Series H received a thorough summerfaliowing the year before 
these legumes were sown* 

It will be noted that there are considerable increases 
in the yield of sweet clover due apparently to the fertilizer 
application* An increase of 600 pounds is found on the marl 
plot while the marl plus ammonium phosphate plot shows an in¬ 
crease of over half a ton® The application of ammonium phosphate 
alone has apparently given the highest yield of all* 

There are also differences in the nitrogen content 
of the crops from the different plots* The check and the marl 
plots are lower in their protein content than either of the 
plots that received ammonium phosphate® Although the yield is 
considerably greater from the two latter plots it would appear 
that the nitrogen added in the ammonium phosphate and the 
nitrogen secured by the more vigorous root systems of these 
plots has been sufficient to increase the protein content of 
the sweet clover* The application of marl has shown a tendency 
to depress the nitrogen content below that of the check* This 
clover is about normal in nitrogen content® 

The percentage of phosphorus in the sweet clover 
shows a slight increase where phosphorus was applied* There is 
no significant difference in phosphorus content between the 
crops from the check and marl plots* The phosphorus content 
of this sweet clover is about normal®

It is apparent from the yields of alsike clover 
(Table VI) that Series H is slightly more productive than 
Series F# This is likely due to the better summerfallowing 
received by Series H before the legumes were sown* 

In both series there is an increase in yield for 
the application of phosphorus, and in both the application of 
ammonium phosphate has given the highest yield# The marl and 
the marl plus phosphate applications have also given increases 
in yield on Series H# 

According to authorities (10)(19) a normal nitrogen 
content of alsike clover ranges from 2#X$ to 2#4jJ# This 
would indicate that there is a tendency for this clover to be 
slightly on the low side# The fertilizers appear to have 
affected the nitrogen content differently on each of the series# 
The ammonium phosphate application, while giving about the 
same Increase in yield in both cases, has depressed the nitrogen 
content on aeries' P and increased It on Series H# No conclus-* 
Ions seem possible from the effects of the fertilizers on the 
nitrogen content of these clovers# 

The phosphorus content of these alsike clovers is 
fairly high, especially in the clover from plots which received 
ammonium phosphate# Besides increasing the yield this fertilizer 
has been able to increase the phosphorus content of the clover# 
This is also true of the triple super on Series F# The marl on 
Series H has apparently depressed the phosphorus content of the 
clover# This is the reverse of the effect of the marl on the 
alfalfa#

Yields and Composition of Red Clover, 1932 


The data for the red clover crops are to be found 
in Table VII* The crops reported on are from Fallis, Duff i©Id 
and Breton. The Fallis and Breton soils are much the same type 
but the DuffieId soil is of a better type, although all ar© 
wooded soils. 

The increase In yields for the application of fert** 
ilizers on the Fallis clover have been very outstanding* The 
yield of the check has been almost doubled by the application 
of phosphorus as triple super® The super (monocalcium phosphate) 
has given a further increase of almost three quarters of a ton® 
The ammonium sulphate has Increased the yield the greatest, 
that plot yielding three times the check plot* 

The super 72 pound application contains only about 
one fifth as much phosphorus as the triple super, so the 
increase in the former plot f s yield does not appear to b© due 
to the extra phosphorus. The ammonium sulphate has also given 
a very high yield. The three highest yields are all from plots 
that received sulphur either as gypsum in the super or as 
sulphate in the ammonium sulphate® This suggests that sulphur 
has a very important part in increasing the yields of clover 
on this soil® However the effect of nitrogen alone is not 
shown, but when applied with super It did not further increase 
the yield. The effect of calcium alone, likewise is not shown 
and since calcium was present In the super some of the effect

on the crop may be due to calcium* 

The nitrogen content of all the clover from Fallis 
is below the average figure of 2.4$ set by Wolff (19). The 
application of nitrogen appears to have helped maintain the 
nitrogen content even in the face of increased yields. 

The phosphorus content has been considerably lowered 
in the higher yielding plots. A normal phosphorus content is 
about .25$ for this clover, thus all the crops are considerably 
below normal* The amount of phosphorus available to the plant 
does not appear to have been sufficient to maintain the 
phosphorus content of the clover. Both from the standpoint of 
yield and phosphorus content, phosphorus is on© of the limiting 
elements in this soil. 

Considering the red clover grown at Duffield an 
increase in yield is shown for fertilizers but not as great 
as the increases at Fallie. The percentage of nitrogen is 
practically the same in both crops, although the content is 
slightly below normal. It is doubtful if nitrogen is a large 
limiting factor in the DuffieId soil* 

The percentage of phosphorus has been increased by 
the application of the fertilizer. As the increased yield 
has not utilized much of the phosphorus applied, it appears 
some of the balance has gone to increase the percentage in the 
plant. This clover is about normal in its phosphorus content.

At Breton on Series G the yields have been consider¬ 
ably increased by the fertilizers applied to the red clover# 

The triple super has increased the yield by a ton, and the 
ammonium phosphate by slightly over a half ton# 

The nitrogen content of the crops from the three 
plots are practically the same but all are below normal (2#5$)# 
The phosphorus content appears slightly reduced by 
the increased growth due the triple super application, but the 
difference is not significant# Both of these crops are normal 
in their phosphorus content# 

Yield and Composition of Hays, 1932 


Table VIII contains the yields and composition of 
an alsike clover and western rye grass mixture grown at Breton 
and of an alsike clover and timothy mixture grown at Fallis# 

As has been previously stated these soils are comparable in 
type# 

It may be seen by Table VIII that the yields from 
the Breton field are low when not fertilized and that sub¬ 
stantial increases may be obtained by the application of 
fertilizers* The complete fertilizer application has given 
by far the largest yield* This plot and the nitro-chalk plot 
have received their fertilizers for two years while the rest 
received fertilizers only in 1932, so some residual effect may

be expected from the complete fertilizer# 

The large increases in the yield have been 
accompanied by depressions in nitrogen content# As this is 
a mixture of grass and clover, a lower nitrogen content, than 
that in clover alone, can be expected# With this in mind the 
nitrogen contents of these hays are possibly about normal# 

The higher nitrogen content of the checks was not 
expected, for during the growing season the clover seemed to 
be more stimulated than the grass by the fertilizers# It would 
appear that the proportion of grass has been Increased or that 
the clover has been considerably reduced In nitrogen by the 
large Increases In yield on the fertilized plots# A combination 
of these effects is quite likely# 

The phosphorus content of the hay shows a great deal 
of variation# The check crops are very high in phosphorus, 
the triple super and ammonium phosphate crops are also high# 

The complete and nltro-ebalk applications have produced crops 
which are the lowest In phosphorus content, yet compare favorably 
with a normal clover crop, despite the grass that is present# 

It would appear that nitrogen and phosphorus are 
both limiting elements for this crop, with nitrogen being the 
most necessary# There are also indications that potassium may 
be having a beneficial effect# 

At Fallis the application of 150 pounds of ammonium 
sulphate has given over a ton increase in the yield* In spit©

of the fact that the yield here has been greatly increased 
the nitrogen content has been increased over that of the 
check# The check crop has a nitrogen percentage about equal 
to that of timothy# The higher nitrogen content of the 
treated crop may be due to increased clover growth, which was 
apparent during the growing season* It may also be due te 
the fertilizer directly increasing tbe nitrogen content or to 
combinations of these two factors# 

No difference is evident in the phosphorus content 
of this hay# This would seem to indicate that phosphorus is 
not lacking in this soil, but other experiments have shown 
that phosphorus may be a limiting factor even when crops are 
high in that element# 

Effect of Fertilizers on the Nitrogen 
Content of Wheat 


Table IX contains data showing the effect of 
fertilizers on the nitrogen content and yield of wheat from 
some of the fertilizer trials# 

Comoaring the crops grown on the black soils with 
those grown on the wooded soils it is apparent that the yields 
and the percentage of nitrogen are consistently higher in the 
former crops#

The effect of the triple super on the black soils 
here reported has been to substantially increase yields and 
slightly lower the percentage of nitrogen* The ammonium 
phosphate would appear to be having the same effect* 

On the wooded soil the triple super does not always 
increase yields, but in the case of Series B, Breton, where a 
large amount of organic matter has been plowed down the increase 
is large. The ammonium phosphate gives fairly good increases 
in yield in these soils* The percentage of nitrogen is usually 
depressed by both fertilizers. Apparently on both wooded and 
black soils the increase in yield causes more efficient 
utilization of the nitrogen in the plants 

Discussion of Pot Studies 


The study of the clover grown on the pots has been 
undertaken with the view of determining the residual effects 
of the fertilizer applications both on the yield and on the 
percentage of phosphorus in the crop# A detailed description 
of these pot studies is on page 6* 

Series 2 and Series 3 are typical wooded soils and 
Series 4 is a black parkland soil* 

Table X contains the yields of the various pots, 
the percentages of phosphorus in the clover and the amount of 
phosphorus removed from each pot by its crop*

Table X # Yield and Phosphorus Content of Clovers and Phosphorus Removal 

by Clover Crop, Grown in Pots in 1932# 



























-75 


In spit© of the fact that Series 2 has not been 
fertilized for five years there is still a marked residual 

ft 

effect from the fertilizers both in yield and phosphorus 
content. The application of CaCO s has had the effect of 
slightly increasing the phosphorus content and doubling the 
removal of phosphorus. Apparently the CaC0 3 has had the 
effect of making phosphorus more available (6). Also when 
CaCOg was applied with superphosphate the removal of phosphorus 
by the crop has been increased. This fertilizer combination 
has also more than doubled the phosphorus content of the plant. 
Superphosphate when applied alone has increased the phosphorus 
percentage of the plant to a normal point® It has also given 
a fair yield but has not removed as much phosphorus as its 
combination with CaCOg. The application of manure on Series 2 
has increased the yield but has not increased the percentage 
of phosphorus materially. 

Series 3* fertilized in 1931, does not shov/ signi¬ 
ficant increases in yield over Series 2 except in its manure 
pots. The phosphorus contents are of the same order as those 
in Series 2 again excepting the manure which shows a substantial 
increase. Apparently the phosphorus in the manure of Series 2 
is nearly all utilized® The application of phosphorus in 
Series 3 has increased the phosphorus content of the clover 
to slightly above normal. As in Series 2 it will be seen that 
CaCC >3 has caused increased removal of phosphorus by the plants.

While Series 2 and Series 3 agree closely with each 
other, Series 4 differs from them considerably# Phosphorus 
is apparently more plentiful in this series, for the removal 
of phosphorus by the checks is from two to three times as great 
as in the wooded soil series# The most important difference 
is the uniformly low phosphorus content of all the clover# 

They are all about half normal in their percentage of phosphor¬ 
us, even where phosphorus has been applied# This would seem to 
indicate that the phosphorus applied has not been as available 
on Series 4 as on Series 3 or 2# This indication is also 
supported by the fact that the phosphorus removed by the 
phosphate treated plants in Series 4 is less than the phosphorus 
removed by the corresponding plants in Series 3# Also the 
effect the CaCOg had in Series 2 and Series 3 is not present in 
Series 4* for instead of increasing the removal of phosphorus 
when applied alone it has had no effect, and when applied with 
phosphorus it has had a depressing effect, as seen by comparison 
with Series 2# The manure application on Series 4 has been more 
effective than on Series 3# It would seem from a study of 
these three series that phosphorus when applied to the black 
soils is not as available as on the wooded soils, and that 
residual effects are not as outstanding#

SUMMARY 


The data submitted shows far reaching effects 
on wooded soils for the combined use of fertilizers 
and legumes. Yields of wheat have been increased by 
about 10 bushels by plowing down one ton of clover 
thereby doubling the yield* The application of 
certain fertilizers to the green manure crop and the 
wheat crop following doubled the crop again, thus 
reaching satisfactory yields (about 40 bu.)* Fertilizers 
applied to oats and barley (without legumes turned under) 
on these soils gave increases up to 50$ but yields were 
still not satisfactory® 

Following a good summepfallow satisfactory yields 
of legumes were obtained without the use of fertilizers* 
Under most conditions however, yields were not satisf&et-* 
ory and the use of fertilizers in many cases doubled the 
yield® 

Hays that ordinarily yielded about § ton per acre 
were increased by the use of certain fertilizers to 
over 2 tons® 

In most cases where relatively large increases in 
yield were obtained by fertilizers the nitrogen and 
phosphorus contents of the crop were reduced* When

increases were relatively low the elements supplied 
appeared to have accumulated in the crop* These 
effects vary in degree with different crops 0 

(3) At Breton the protein content of oats and barley 
was, with and without fertilizers, low enough tm 
seriously impair their feeding value, although commer¬ 
cially they all graded high# The barley was all of 
excellent malting quality# The wheat crop following 
clover was about normal in protein content, and no 
appreciable variations in commercial grade, for the 
different treatments was apparent# 

Most of the legumes at Breton were about normal 
in protein content and feeding value; red clover being 
an exception* At Fallis the red clover was seriously 
lacking in protein, but the alfalfa at DuffleId was 
not 0 

(4) The phosphorus contents of practically all crops 
analyzed showed a distinct tendency to be above normal* 
The alfalfa check at Breton and the higher yielding 
crops of red clover at Fallis are the only crops where 
phosphorus is lacking seriously enough to impair the 
feeding value*

(5) A green manure crop of clover at Breton Increased 
the supply of nitrogen to such an extent that phosphorus, 
calcium and potassium appeared to be limiting elements 
for the following wheat crop. With cereals not receiving 
a green manure crop, nitrogen was the most limiting 
element, phosphorus and potassium having little effect# 
The legumes at Breton showed good increases for both 
nitrogen and phosphorus, and some effect for potassium* 

(6) From the number of trials here reported it appears 
that the application of phosphatic fertilizers tended 

to slightly depress the protein content of wheat, at the 

same time increasing yields. 

-* 

( 7 ) As Illustrated by the pot studies the phosphorus 
content of clover on wooded soils can be reduced to one 
third normal by continued cropping* The phosphorus 
applied to this wooded soil appears to be more available 
and have a greater residual effect than when applied to 
the black soil* CaC0 3 appears to have increased the 
availability of phosphorus on the wooded soils.
