SYNOPSIS 


This thesis, ”A Diagnosis of the Achievement of a 
Sample of Alberta Grade Eight Pupils in Solving Arithmetic 
Problems”, is the report of an attempt to analyze achieve¬ 
ment and weaknesses in problem solving on a standardized 
arithmetic test. Four hundred answer papers written by 
Alberta grade eight pupils from various parts of the pro¬ 
vince and from different types of schools were studied 
with the object of finding whether these students solve 
all types of problems with equal facility; whether their 
difficulties may be diagnosed for remedial purposes; 
whether there is equal proficiency among pupils from urban, 
town, graded rural, and ungraded rural schools in solving 
different types of problems., and whether grade eight boys and 
girls are equally adept at solving problems of different 
types. 


When the statistics of the study were compiled, it 
was found that our grade eight pupils are much more pro¬ 
ficient in solving problems of one type than another. 

Pupils* weaknesses were diagnosed and classified, 
and remedial and preventive teaching could have been im¬ 
plemented after the test results were studied. 


When the results of the four types of schools were 












' 
























V 


compared, it was found that in the over-all test, the rank 
order of achievement was urban, graded rural, town, and un¬ 
graded rural. However, this order did not prevail in all 
types of problems. With the exception of ungraded rural 
schools, each type of school excelled in some class of 
problems. 

Although boys generally showed a slight superiority 
over girls in solving problems, this difference was often 
insignificant, and in some cases girls achieved better 
than boys. This was particularly true in ungraded rural 
schools, and in certain types of problems, girls excelled 
in other schools as well. 

On the basis of these findings, certain recommenda¬ 
tions have been made, which, if adopted, may help to 
equalize educational opportunities for pupils in Alberta 
schools and improve achievement in solving problems in 


arithmetic

CHAPTER I 


THE PURPOSE OF THE STUDY 

Arithmetic is a social subject. In almost everything 
we ho, whether as individuals or in interaction with others, 
we use numbers. It is therefore of great importance that 
we gain some insight and develop some facility in mathe¬ 
matics. If we are to become efficient in the use of numbers, 
we must find them meaningful, and meaningful arithmetic is 
found in problems. For that reason, it seems important that 
we learn how well our pupils are able to deal with problems 
in numbers. 

The primary purpose of this study is to diagnose both 
the achievement and the shortcomings of our grade eight 
pupils in solving arithmetical problems. A secondary pur¬ 
pose is to make certain recommendations to teachers of arith¬ 
metic in order to attempt to improve instruction in those 
fields which are least effectively handled by our pupils. 
Since .grade eight is the last grade in which mathematics 
instruction is primarily in the field of arithmetic, this 
study deals exclusively with pupils from that grade. 

More specifically, it is the aim of this study to 
determine the answers to questions such as the following: 

1. Do the grade eight pupils in Alberta solve all types 
of problems with equal facility or difficulty, or do 































■ 















2 


they achieve better in some types than in others? 

2. Can their shortcomings be diagnosed so that prevent¬ 
ive teaching and remedial work may be implemented and 
thus help our pupils to become more proficient in 
solving problems? 

3. Is there equal proficiency in all phases of problem 
solving among the grade eight pupils of urban, town, 
graded rural and ungraded rural schools in Alberta? 

4. Is there equality in proficiency in solving all types 
of problems between grade eight girls and boys in 
Alberta schools? 

I. THE DESCRIPTIVE METHOD — ANALYSIS 


The purpose of analytical description in research 
is said by G-ood and Scates to be ^to uncover what lies 
beneath the surface.”^ 

Under the heading Meaning of Analysis, the same 
authors continue: 

All who teach covet a finer knowledge of the way 
in which the birth of an idea takes place. We know 
less of mental growth than of physical. Is learning 
to be viewed simply as a process? Or is it a matter 
of adding on one building block after another? Does 
an area of expanding comprehension represent just 
more blocks? Or a different kind of structural

relation among them? Or something that cannot be 
thought of in terms of units at all? The same 
questions arise when we think of ability in cross 
section. 2 

Since the questions posed by these authors are close¬ 
ly related to the purposes of the present study, analytical 
research seems to be logical means by v/hich to attempt to 
find the answers to the questions asked by the present 
investigator. 

II. TIMELINESS -AND IMPORTANCE OF THE STUDY 

Statistical studies have recently been conducted in 
Alberta in some of the major fields of learning, notably 
the Carmichael -- Rees survey of reading achievement, the 
Reid -- Conquest survey of language achievement, and the 
Pritchard — Climenhaga survey of arithmetical achievement. 
Further reference will be made to the last-mentioned study 
in the section devoted to related literature. Suffice it 
here to say that the Pritchard —* Climenhaga study is a 
normative survey of arithmetical achievement of Alberta 
grade five and grade eight pupils, including achievement in 
problem solving. While norms are compared between Alberta 
pupils and those of other regions, that study is limited to 
an over-all view of such proficiency. It is important also

for purposes of preventive teaching and remedial work that 
inefficiency he analyzed, so that difficulties may be pin¬ 
pointed. That is what this study purports to do. It is hoped 
that the answers found to the questions listed earlier in this 
chapter may serve as a guide to teachers in the field, and 
that the conclusions may lead to further investigations. 

The writer acknowledges that this study has definite 
limitations. Some of these will be dealt with more fully 
in a description of the testing instrument in Chapter IY. 

At this time it will be enough to state that because of 
certain limitations of the testing instrument for diagnostic 
purposes, the percentages shown in the treatment of the data 
are relative only, and not an accurate statistical represent¬ 
ation of pupils* errors. The reason for this will be made 
clear later. The investigator feels that this limitation 
does not lessen the value of the study appreciably. 

III. PREVIEW OF THE THESIS 

Chapter II of this thesis contains a survey of litera¬ 
ture related to problem solving in arithmetic. It reviews 
both general discussions of problem solving and previous 
studies conducted in this field. Chapter III explains the 
sampling technique and the experimental design of this study, 
including the gathering of data and the plan for reporting 
them. Chapter IY describes and evaluates Part III — Problem

CHAPTER II 


RELATED LITERATURE 


The literature related to this study may be divided 
roughly into two types: general texts and articles dealing 
with problem solving in arithmetic, and reports of other 
studies or investigations made in this field. Only such 
literature as was directly useful to the writer in his study 
has been included. 

I. TEXTS AND ARTICLES ON PROBLEM SOLVING 


J.F. Weaver has this to say about the relationship 
between computation and problem solving: 

It is quite possible that a person may possess 
considerable skill in arithmetic computation but have 
little or no understanding of why he does things in a 
manner which has become well habituated. 

It is equally possible that a person may have a 
thorough understanding of the mathematical bases for 
the algorisms which he uses but operate at a relatively 
low level of computational efficiency.^ 

This then would suggest that in analyzing weaknesses 
in problem solving, the first classification might well be 
between computational inefficiency (which would not be 
peculiar to problem solving, but -would be prevalent in all

Arithmetic, n Elementary School Journal , 51: 35 - 41.

phases of a weak pupil*s work with numbers), and actual 
difficulties with the processes of solution of problems, 
which is what this study in part purports to do. Once com¬ 
putational difficulties have been dealt with, the remainder 
of this study will report on weaknesses which are not a 
direct result of inefficiency in computation, but rather of 

inefficiency in other areas which lead to incorrect solutions, 
o 

Wilson, reporting in the Encyclopedia of Educational 

Research, indicates that if arithmetic is to be of value, 

it must be useful socially. He makes references to studies 

by Traniello, Louth, Sala, and Dorothy Wilson which point 

out that various devices for gaining skill in denominate 

numbers have little or no value. He lists: 

...committing to memory of tables; addition sub¬ 
traction, multiplication, and division of compound 
numbers; reductions ascending and descending.' 5 

He goes on to say that: 

... pupils tend not to reason when they attempt 
to solve verbal problems of the usual textbook 
types. 2 * 4 

He further quotes Hydle and Clapp as reporting that: 

If the problem could be visualized it became 
almost as easy as if it has occurred within the

child's experience. 

The writer suggests that the remedy is better prob¬ 
lems and better teaching. He offers evidence to indicate 
that reading verbal problems requires both special reading 
skills and a knowledge of the type of vocabulary used in 
problem statements. He stresses that understanding the prob 
lem must be superior to getting correct solutions. 

Brueckner and G-rossnickle in a chapter on The Scope 
of Problem Solving in Arithmetic corroborate this. They 
compare the outmoded method of problem solving which was 
mental gymnastics of a mechanical nature with the present 
idea of developing quantitative thinking to gain insight 
into problems. 

These authors deal particularly with reading skills 
which are related to quantitative thinking: 

The ability to read quantitative materials of 
many different kinds with understanding and for a 
wide variety of purposes is fundamental to success 
in arithmetic. It is the basis of much of our 
quantitative thinking. The ability to read explana¬ 
tions of number processes, problems, graphs, instru¬ 
ments of measurements, and diagrams is quite differ¬ 
ent from the ability to read literary materials such 
as stories or newspaper clippings.

They recommend the use of survey tests to discover 
weaknesses in verbal problems explaining that through such 
testing it is possible to make an evaluation of a pupil f s 
knowledge of quantitative vocabulary and social applications 
of arithmetic as well as to appraise his ability to interpret 
graphs and tables. This, in part, is what the present study 
proposes to do on a group basis. 

G-lennon and Hunnicutt reporting in ft What Does Research 
Say About Arithmetic?” stress the importance of meanings in 
arithmetic by quoting Brownell T s summary: 

1. Arithmetic can function in intelligent living 
only when it is understood. ... It is a fallacy to 
classify arithmetic as a skill or a drill or a tool 
subject. In practical living we must be intelligent 
in quantitative situations, for many years we have been 
told that skills can be used intelligently only when 
they have been acquired intelligently; hence the 
importance of meanings in arithmetic. 

Meanings facilitate learning. ... Through mean¬ 
ings we secure insights and note relationships which, 
without meanings, we should not be likely to hit 
upon. The insights in turn enable us to foresee 
connections and to tie together various aspects of 
the learning task which, without understanding, would 
have to be mastered separately, one at a time. 8

Minnesota: 

1. In such psychological factors as general mental 
ability, delayed and immediate memory, language level, 
and general reading ability, the differences between good 
and poor achievers in problem solving are highly sig¬ 
nificant in favor of the good achievers, that is, the 
scores for good achievers excel those of poor achievers, 

2. The differences in skill in fundamental oper¬ 
ations and ability to estimate ansY/ers also are highly 
significant in favor of the good achiever. 

3. The differences in four basic reading skills 
peculiar to arithmetic as a special field ... and in 
range of information about arithmetic also are highly 
significant in favor of the good achievers. 

4. The differences between good and poor achievers 
in problem solving in range of general information and 
in the four general reading skills measured by the 
four Gates Silent Reading Tests are shown not to be 
significant. This conclusion is in sharp contrast to 
the third conclusion stated above. 9 

This again would seem to indicate that for purposes 
of problem solving, not only is general ability to read 
essential, but it is also necessary that the pupil have 
special reading skills in interpreting quantitative expression.

ment in specific mathematical vocabulary helps in solving 
problems in which this vocabulary is used. In working with

a group of 898 grade seven pupils equated as to chronological 
and mental age, reading ability, knowledge of arithmetic 
vocabulary, abilities, nationality, and occupation of the 
father, he reached the following conclusions: 

1. There was significant growth in knowledge where the 
specific terms were used. 

2. There was no general improvement in arithmetic 
learnings. 

3. There ?;as no evidence of transfer of learning. 
Johnson^ later tested to find reasons for difficulty 

in problem solving, giving two problem-tests, one with number 
and the other without. He reached the conclusions that know¬ 
ledge of vocabulary is the main factor in problem-solving 
ability; the second factor being ability to reason. There is 
also inconclusive evidence that problem-solving ability may 

be influenced by memory.

In 1932, Tanner tested 432 grade five pupils from 
Edmonton schools, comparing their achievement in problem 
solving in relation to X.Q,., sex and age. He found that I.Q. 
is the most important factor in determining ability in solv-

ing problems, that age, while significant, is not so important 
as might be expected, and that boys are generally superior to 

girls in achievement in this field. 

13 

Swift in his Investigation of Abilities of Grade IV , 

V and VI Pupils in Solving and Analyzing Problems in Arith¬ 
metic , came up with conclusions which seem to contradict 
most of the findings of other investigators. He found that 
pupils 1 abilities to understand problems lag far behind their 
abilities to get correct solutions for them, and that ability 
to analyze a problem is not essential to efficiency in its 
solution. He also found that ability to explain principles 
involved in a problem does not greatly increase efficiency in 
its solution, nor does inability to explain imply failure on 
a problem. 

14 

On the other hand, Hall in a diagnostic study of 
the difficulties encountered in the LaZerte Survey Tests 
twelve years after Swift*s study, concluded that denominate 
relationships can be effectively learned only through activity, 
that pupils with difficulties lack ability to visualize the

experience, and that learning arithmetic vocabulary is 
important. 

LaZerte in his series of studies in problem solving 
reached conclusions very similar to those of Swift. He says: 

1. The ability of school children fully to under¬ 
stand problems lags far behind their ability to get 
correct answers. 

2. The ability to analyze a problem is not essen¬ 
tial to efficiency in problem-solving. The solution 
depends rather on certain habits of response which do 
not require analysis. 16 

Nevertheless, at the end of his investigations, 

LaZerte listed the following findings: 

Pupils are handicapped in problem-solving if they 
are deficient in reading ability. ... The special 
vocabulary of arithmetic, its technical terms, its 
abbreviations, and its conventions must be under¬ 
stood. ... Other things being equal, the pupil 
for whom the problem is full of meaning is aided 
in estimating in advance the result of operations 
to be performed and in approximating to results. 

... Pupils are sided in problem-solving by train¬ 
ing in analysis. 16 

More recent studies in arithmetic have been carried 
out by investigators sponsored by the Committee on Education¬ 
al Research, Faculty of Education, University of Alberta.

Climenhaga and Pritchard carried out parallel investiga¬ 
tions of arithmetic achievement of grade eight and grade five 
pupils respectively in Alberta schools, while Peta 19 evaluated 
arithmetical competence of junior high school students in the 
city of Lethbridge. 

These were normative surveys rather than diagnostic, 
although Peta also diagnosed areas of strength and weaknesses. 
A comparison of their findings is interesting and useful in 
forming hypotheses for the present study. 

Both Pritchard and Climenhaga found a tendency for 
boys to be superior to girls in arithmetic. Peta did not 
differentiate between the sexes. Again the two aforementioned 
investigators found that Alberta students compared more 
favorably with the test norms in the part dealing with prob¬ 
lem solving, while they suffered slightly by comparison on 
the other part of the test. They found urban pupils superior 
to those from town and rural schools. Peta T s study was 
limited to city pupils, which may explain why the subjects he

tested compared favorably with the standardization groups. 
All of these investigators found weaknesses in arithmetical 
achievement, which would confirm the need for the present 
investigation. 

Nearly all the evidence encountered in the survey of 
literature outlined above seems to point at the causes of 
difficulties listed in the problem of this study. For the 
purposes of this investigation, therefore, the hypothesis 
will be that pupils 1 weaknesses in problem solving may be 
so categorized. 







CHAPTER III 


THE EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN 


Since a normative survey had already been conducted 
by Climenhaga" 3 ' using one thousand grade eight pupils random¬ 
ly chosen from four types of Alberta schools, permission was 
obtained by the writer of this report from the committee 
sponsoring the study to analyze a subsample of four hundred 
answer sheets for purposes of diagnosing achievement and 
deficiencies in problem solving. This chapter will discuss 
the method of obtaining the subsample, and explain the pro¬ 
cedure used in diagnosis, such as classifying difficulties, 
as well as treatment given the data in preparing it for this 
report. 

I. SELECTION OF THE SAMPLE 

The original sample of Alberta grade eight pupils used 
in Climenhaga’s study consisted of 390 urban pupils, 251 from 
towns, 227 from graded rural schools, and 202 from ungraded 
rural schools. These 1070 pupils had been selected randomly 
in direct proportion to the grade eight school population in 
the four types of Alberta schools. Each pupil had been

Achievement of Grade Eight Pupils in Alberta Schools,

17 


given a number on assembly sheets. 

The same proportion was retained in the subsample of 
400 used in this investigation. Thus the present sample 
consists of 145 urban pupils, 94 town pupils, 85 from graded 
rural schools, and 76 from ungraded rural schools. (Actually 
the number of pupils in each category becomes a mixed number, 
with the fractions totalling three pupils. These were arbit¬ 
rarily assigned one to each of the three smallest groups.) 

Since a number of the original 1070 had not actually 
written the test, and since the 400 pupils in the subsample 
were considered a minimum number for purposes of analysis, 
only those pupils for whom data could be obtained were made 
eligible for selection in the present study. 

Slips containing numbers corresponding to the numbers 
assigned to pupils on the assembly sheets were prepared and 
thoroughly mixed in a container. The required quantity was 
drawn by lot, and the numbers so selected w r ere recorded. 

The result of this procedure was a sample of 198 boys and 
202 girls. The answer sheets completed by the pupils selected 
were then gathered from the file at the faculty of Education. 

Good and Scates have this to say about the method of 
selecting the sample outlined above: 

The procedures commonly used to select random 
samples of human populations include: drawing 
by lot numbered slips of paper from a container, 




































.

capsules from a gold-fish bowl, or balls from 
an urn .... 

Garrett also defends this method of choosing the 

sample. He says: tf Randomness in a sample is assured w/hen we 

3 

draw similar and well shaken-up slips out of a hat .... 

Further to confirm the validity of the subsample, a 
comparison w r as made between the mean scores on the problem 
solving part of the test in the original sample as reported 
by Climenhaga, 4 with the mean scores on the subsample used in 
this investigation. This comparison is shown in Table I 
below:

Table I indicates a very slight difference in all 
pairs of mean scores. In every case the mean of the sub¬ 
sample is slightly lower than that in the original, but the 
order of achievement remains the same in both, i.e. Urban, 
Graded Rural, Town, and Ungraded Rural in that order. 

The differences of the means v/ere tested for sig¬ 
nificance in the following manner: The differences of the 
means were computed. The standard error of the difference 
was found by using the formula 

X SD 

The critical ratio was found by the formula CR = SE 

DIFF SD 

This critical ratio was then checked against Table D in 
Garrett for significance. The result of this test is shown 
in Table II below.

Since, in every case, there was no significant differ¬ 
ence in the mean scores, the null hypothesis was retained, 
and the writer feels that he has a valid sample with which to 
carry out his investigation. 

II. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN 

Once the sample was chosen and the answer sheets 
gathered, every question on each pupil 1 s answer sheet was 
checked and the solutions recorded to determine the frequency 
of each choice. Pupils were grouped according to the type 
of school attended, and according to sex. When the frequency 
of responses had been tabulated, the problems we re classified 
according to the categories outlined below, and comparisons 
were made as to differential achievement and difficulties 
encountered by each group. 

Achievement in each group of problems was handled 
first; then difficulties were diagnosed. Comparisons were 
made of problems omitted, difficulties in computation, read¬ 
ing, ability to apply denominate numbers, processes in prob¬ 
lem solving, the use of per cent and fractions, ability to 
estimate answers, ability to visualize problems from drawings 
and diagrams, and the use of formulas. Some difficulty was 
experienced by the writer in classifying W N W answers. A 
detailed explanation of this type of response will be given 
in Chapter IV.

III. STATISTICAL PROCEDURES 

In order to make comparisons statistically sound, 
percentages of responses over attempted solutions were 
computed for each group of pupils according to school 
attended and sex. Eor purposes of comparison, the signifi¬ 
cance of differences of percentages between the pairs of 

groups was computed according to the method recommended by 
0 

Garrett. The chapters devoted to presentation of the data 
describe the findings of these computations.

CHAPTER IV 


THE TESTING INSTRUMENT 

This survey is based on Part III — Problems of The 
Iowa Every-Pupil Tests of Basic Skills , New Edition , Test D: 

Basic Arithmetic Skills Form _0, Advanced Battery , For Grades 
Five to Nine .^ In the following pages, the part of the test 
used in this study will be referred to as w the problem test n . 

The present chapter will give reasons for choosing this test¬ 
ing instrument and present an evaluation of its usefulness 
for diagnostic purposes. 

One reason for this choice of testing instrument was 

the availability of materials from which the data could be 

processed. Reference has been made earlier in this report 

2 

to a recent study by Climenhaga in which the complete Iowa 
Test D in Arithmetic was used. The completed tests had been 
machine scored by the Faculty of Education, university of 
Alberta, and tabulation of data assembly sheets had been 
completed by hired clerical assistants. Using the same 
instrument, therefore, saved time, money and labor.

A more important reason was its suitability for the 
purposes of this investigation. The test consists of 31 
problems requiring for correct solutions a wide variety of 
mathematical skills which may be analyzed without too much 
difficulty. The authors of the test have this to say about 
interpretation of test results: 

An analysis is given of the skills tested in 
Part I, since these are not clearly identified 
in many texts, but none is offered for Parts II 
and III. The teacher should have no difficulty 
in recognizing just what each of the items in 
these parts is intended to test. 3 

The writer found certain limitations in the use of 
the test for diagnostic purposes, but feels that these are 
offset by its many desirable features. The first of these 
limitations is the lack of an analysis by the authors, which 
necessitated a detailed study of the test. Such a study is 
not very difficult, since each choice on the answer sheet, 
with the exception of answers, indicates a definite pro¬ 
cedure followed by the pupil in his attempted solution. The 
multiple-choice type of response makes such a scrutiny of the 
test essential, since pupils are not required to v/rite com¬ 
plete solutions to the problems. This analysis, which is 
recorded in the appendix of this report, also served to make

Skills, Grades 5-9, (Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company,

the investigator thoroughly familiar with the testing instru¬ 
ment. Leroy H. Schnell, reviewing the test in Buros, feels 
that the Examiner’s Manual should have included such classi¬ 
fication* lie says: 

The analysis of all items of Part I of the tests 
should prove most helpful. ... Analysis of the skills 
involved in items of Parts II and III would prove 
as useful as this information for Part 1.4 

The tf N” type of answer caused the writer some difficulty, 
as it is impossible to analyze the process followed by a pupil 
who arrives at this solution. This difficulty was made more 
acute by the fact that "N" answers were very popular with 
the pupils tested, even when they were incorrect choices. 

One of Buswell’s findings in his recent study of patterns of 
thinking may account for so many responses of this type. He 
observes that: 

... although there appears to be a considerable 
degree of uniformity in the sequence employed by 
a group of subjects in solving a simple problem, 
there is also a great deal of individual variation 
in patterns of solution ,.. * * * 5 

The ”N ff response might include a multitude of patterns. Since 
it is possible for any of the weaknesses diagnosed in this 
to lead to such an answer, the tt N” choices have been grouped

ments Yearbook , (New Brunswick, New Jersey: Rutgers Univer¬ 

sity Press, 1949 .) p. 423.

as a separate part of the analysis of difficulties. 

Schnell in his review vigorously attacks the n N” type 
of answer: 

Here a new feature, definitely open to challenge, is 
introduced. In 54 items, r, N M is one of the four choices. 
Pupils are instructed to place an X in the box by the 
answer that agrees with theirs; but ’*if none of the 
three answers given is like yours, place an X in the 
box in front of the N. * In approximately 20 per cent 
of these 54 items the correct response is M N n . Hence 
a pupil actually may solve one of these problems incor¬ 
rectly and still be awarded a score merely because his 
incorrect answer was different from the three incorrect 
answer choices l The procedure is educationally unsound, 
in addition to the fact that grade a$d age equivalents 
for Form 0 cannot be given credence.° 

The writer of this report was not nearly so troubled 
about W N M responses which w r ere correct as about M N W choices 
which were incorrect. At any rate, Miriam M. Bryan, review¬ 
ing the same test in a later edition of Buros, expresses an 
opinion which nullifies Schnell*s condemnation of M N n res¬ 
ponses by reporting: 

An innovation in the machine scorable forms is the 
use in Parts II and III of the ’None* response, stand¬ 
ing for f None of the preceding answers is correct. T 
The validity of this type of response, when there is 
one indisputably correct answer to the question asked 
and the response accompanying the T N0NB* have been 
carefully constructed to cover the commonest errors, 
has been well established.'

Still another difficulty encountered by the writer 
in using this testing instrument was the large number of 
responses omitted, presumably due in large measure to the 

O 

fact that the Iowa lest has a time limit. Schonell in 
defining a diagnostic test explains that since its main 
object is to analyze rather than to assess, the speed factor 
should be ignored, and ample time provided for pupils to 
complete all they are able to do. Since, obviously, the 
Iowa test does not offer this feature, a statistical study 
has been made of the number of omissions, while other com¬ 
parisons of difficulties encountered by the pupils are based 
on attempted solutions rather than on the possible number. 

Despite these limitations of the testing instrument, 
there is ample support for its suitability. Gustav J. Froe- 
lich states that in his experience ” ... the Iowa Every- 
Pupil Tests of Basic Skills are most valuable as diagnostic 

Q 

instruments.” Anton Thompson agrees with this when he says: 
"Teachers who follow the authors* suggestions for analyzing 
the pupils* errors find the tests useful as diagnostic

in Arithmetic, (Toronto: Clarke, Irwin & Company Limited,

instruments.”^" 0 Ralph. 0. Preston also reports that "all 
tests in these batteries lend themselves to diagnostic pur¬ 
poses more successfully than tests in most achievement 
batteries.”^' 1 * Climenhaga in his conclusions found that "for 

normal classroom use and individual diagnosis, it (the Iowa 

12 

Test) appears quite reliable.” 

Several reviewers have praise for the subject matter 
covered in the test as well. Thus, Frederick L. Ayer reports 

The arithmetic test is almost evenly divided among 
vocabulary and fundamental knowledge and includes 
distance judgment, time telling, and the understand¬ 
ing of the reasons behind basic computations, funda¬ 
mental operations, and story problems. In general, 
the content is well presented and appears appropri¬ 
ate to grade levels. 13 

William A. Brownell, speaking of the problem test, 
has this to say: 

The problems in Part III are also typical of 
curricular and measurement practice, though they 
are more ’practical f and are perhaps better stated 
than is the rule. The use of centers of interest 
for organizing groups of problems is to be commended. 
Isolated problems, however, still serve an important

28 


function, and the authors are justified in retaining 
this type in their tests. 14 

In spite of his severe criticism of the ,f N n type of 

answer, Schnell also has some kind words regarding the Iowa 

Test: 


Only approximate answers are required in 8 of the 
31 problem-solving items in Part III, Form 0, of the 
Advanced Battery. Since an exact answer to a practical 
problem often may be less meaningful than a good 
approximation, it is encouraging to find this type of 
item in standardized tests. Surely fevv, if any, 
educators will deny the fact that if 21/32 of a farm's 
acreage is planted in corn, the most common sense 
interpretation is that about 2/3 is planted in corn. 1 ^ 

Unless it is specifically constructed for a particular 
investigation, it is doubtful that any test can be found w r ith 
all the exact characteristics desired in a measuring instru¬ 
ment. Since it was impractical in this investigation to build 
a new test, a good standardized test seemed to be the logical 
instrument to use. The Iowa Test D appears to have met the 
pui-poses of this study to as great an extent as any such test 
could be expected to do. The writer feels that Brownell 

aptly summarized its suitability when he said: "There probably 

16 

is no better battery of arithmetic tests on the market."

CHAPTER Y 


PRESENTATION OF DATA 

This chapter will be devoted to a comparison of 
achievement in the different concepts tested. For purposes 
of organization, the problems have been classified according 
to the following nine categories: (1) simple computation, 

(2) averages, (3) cost, (4) per cent, (5) fractions, (6) use 
of formulas, (7) approximations, (8) telling time, (9) inter¬ 
pretation of diagrams. Since many of the problems test more 
than one of these concepts, such problems are included in 
more than one category. Also, since this part of the study 
is concerned with achievement rather than diagnosis of 
difficulties, percentages are based on total possible answers, 
since omission of a problem may indicate the pupil ! s inabil¬ 
ity to solve it. 

Since all verbal problems require a certain amount 
of skill in reading, it is impossible to say of a problem 
that it tests that skill. Hence, no attempt has been made 
to measure achievement in this area, although difficulties 
in reading are diagnosed in Chapter YI. Since it may be 
argued that all problems require skill in computation, 
computation has been made the first category for comparison.

Tables I'll and IV, and all tables like them in this

school and sex. "Combined" means the total sample from the 
type of school under consideration. The possible score is 
the number of pupils times the number of questions in this 
particular category. The correct score is the number of 
correct solutions, to these questions. The third column 
gives the per cent of correct solutions out of the possible 
number. 

In Table TV, the first column gives the samples com¬ 
pared; the second column indicates the difference between 
their percentages of achievement; the third column gives the 
standard error of this difference; the fourth column shows the 
critical ratio between Columns II and III; and the last column 
indicates the level of significance in the difference. 

For ready reference, the legend has been given below 
each table throughout the chapter.

It is interesting to note in Tables V and VI that, 
although the percentage differences are fairly large, the 
sample is so small that the standard error becomes large 
enough to make differences in achievement insignificant. 

The only significant difference is in the combined sample 
where urban pupils showed superiority over the ungraded 
rural pupils at the .05 level. The order of achievement 
remained the same as for computation. 

III. COST 

For purposes of classification, the third group con¬ 
sists of problems dealing with cost. Questions 80, 81, 83, 
94, 95, 100, 102, 103, and 104 were of this type. Tables 
VII and VIII on pages 36 and 37 respectively illustrate the 
achievement on these questions.

It is interesting to note in Table VII that the 
sequence of rank order has changed from that appearing in the 
two previous types of problems. In cost problems, the order 
of achievement is: graded rural, town, urban, and ungraded 
rural. Table VIII on page 37 shows, however, that the 
differences are significant only between graded rural and 
ungraded rural schools, and this is at the .05 level only.

Table XII indicates significantly inferior achievement 
on the part of ungraded rural pupils in problems requiring 
the use of fractions. Although, with the exception of the 
ungraded rural pupils, boys scored higher than girls, this 
difference was not significant in any comparison. The 
poorest achievers were the boys from ungraded rural schools. 

VI. FORMULAS 

Problems number 84, 97, 98, 99, 100, and 101 require 
the use of formulas for finding areas ana volumes. Table 
XIII on page 43 indicates a general weakness in the use 
of formulas with an average achievement of only 28 per cent. 
The rank order of achievement was also unusual in this type 
of problems, with tom pupils at the top, followed by those 
from graded rural, ungraded rural, and urban schools in 
that order. It is particularly interesting to note that 
urban pupils were the poorest achievers in handling formulas.

Table XIV on page 44 shows that both urban boys and 
girls were inferior to town boys and girls in working 
problems with formulas. In the total sample, urban pupils 
proved inferior to pupils from both town and graded rural 
schools, significant at the .01 level of confidence. In 
this type of problem, boys were superior to girls in every 
type of school, also significant at the .01 level.

It is obvious from Tables XV and XVI that ungraded 
rural pupils are inferior to those from each of the other 
three types of schools in approximating an answer. This 
difference is significant at the .01 level of confidence. 

In this skill, ungraded rural girls are inferior only to 
those from graded rural schools, and then only at the .05 
level. In the total sample, in approximating answers girls 
were also found to be weaker than boys, significant at the 
.05 level. The poorest achievers in this category were the 
ungraded rural boys who were significantly inferior to the 
boys from all three other types of schools at the .01 level. 


VIII. TELLING TIME 

Only problem number 90 deals with telling time, so 
the sample here is very small, but since this problem does 
not fall into any other category except for computation, it 
has been included as a separate class. Tables XVII and 
XVIII on pages 48 and 49 respectively give the achievement 
statistics for this problem.

Table XVII would indicate a wide variety of achieve¬ 
ment in this type of problems, but the small sample makes 
it impossible to state with any authority that such dif¬ 
ferences are reliable. The rank order of achievement in 
this small sample was graded rural schools, town schools, 
urban schools, and ungraded rural schools in that order. 

The significance of the differences has been computed in 
Table XVIII on page 49.

According to Table XVIII, the boys from ungraded 
rural schools were far below those from other types of 
schools in achievement, with the difference significant 
at .01 in each case. There was no significant difference 
between boys and girls, but in the combined sample, un¬ 
graded rural pupils showed significantly inferior achieve¬ 
ment, at the .05 level as compared with urban and town 
pupils, and at the .01 level when compared with those 
from graded rural schools. 


IX. DIAGRAMS 

The final category of problems consisted of two 
groups, one based on a road map, and the other on a 
floor plan of a house. Correct interpretation of the 
diagram was required for the right solution to each 
of the twelve questions in these series of problems. 
Achievement in this type is summarized in Table XIX on 
page 51, and Table XX on page 52.

Table XIX above and Table XX on page 52 show that urban 
girls were particularly weak in these problems. They were in¬ 
ferior to the boys and to graded rural girls at the .01 level, 
and brought down the average for the combined urban sample to 
such an extent that urban pupils scored significantly lower 
than graded rural pupils at the .01 level. Ungraded rural 
pupils were also inferior to graded rural pupils at the .05 
level. In the total sample, boys proved superior to girls, 
significant at the .01 level.

X. ALL CATEGORIES 

In addition to the comparison of achievement in each 
type of problems, it is interesting and useful to compare 
the results obtained in all the different categories. As a 
basis of comparison, the percentage of correct solutions on 
the complete problem test has been compared with each type of 
problems in turn. Table XXI below and Table XXII on page 54 
show this comparison.

below the test average at the .01 level. The poorest achieve¬ 
ment was found in problems requiring the use of formulas, 
while those based on diagrams, per cent, and approximation 
also had a high critical ratio. 

XI. SUMMARY 

The tables in this chapter indicate that the inferior 
achievement of pupils in ungraded rural schools is consistent 
in almost all types of problems, a notable exception being 
problems involving per cent, where no significant difference 
was found. 

Another interesting fact is the inferior achievement 
of urban pupils in problems requiring the use of formulas. 

Here pupils from city schools were significantly below town 
and graded rural pupils, and had insignificantly lower scores 
than ungraded rural pupils. 

As for sex differences, while boys general^/ scored 
higher than girls, this was usually the reverse in the case 
of ungraded rural schools. The only significant difference 
between boys* and girls* achievement was in problems requir¬ 
ing formulas or diagrams, where the boys were significantly 
superior. 

The most important fact noted is that there is a 
great difference in ability to solve different types of 
problems.

CHAPTER VI 


PRESENTATION OF DATA CONTINUED 

The first half of the data in this investigation dealt 
with achievement and was presented in Chapter V. The second 
half is an analysis of pupils’ errors, and will be presented 
in this chapter. 

Several factors in this part of the study made it 
necessary to alter the method in treatment of the raw data 
used in Chapter V. The first of these factors was the 
comparatively large number of problems omitted. In¬ 
structions to the pupils on the fly leaf of the Iowa 
Test read in part as follows: 

Answer the questions in all parts of the test 
in the order in which they are given, but do not 
linger too long over difficult questions or prob¬ 
lems. Skip them, and return to them later if 
time permits. . ..^ 

There may, therefore, be at least two reasons for 
an omission: lack of ability to solve the problem, and 
lack of time. That the latter is not entirely responsible 
is perhaps indicated by the number of omissions in the 
early part of the test. For these reasons, omissions

Basic Skills , New Bdition , Test D: Basic Arithmetic Skills -

Houghton, Mifflin Company, 1943.)

57 


have been treated as a separate class of difficulty. 

Another factor which made a change necessary is the 
N answer which does not lend itself to diagnosis. It also 
has been treated as a class in itself. 

Because of the large number of omissions, and since 
this is a timed test, the writer feels that all statistics 
other than those on omissions are more valid when based 
upon attempted solutions than upon possible answers. This 
procedure is therefore used in reporting the second half of 
the data. 

Since the difference between boys and girls in the 
various types of schools and that between the combined samples 
of the four classifications of schools yield all the informa¬ 
tion sought in this portion of the study, tables of signifi¬ 
cance have been limited to such comparisons only. 

Bor purposes of differentiation, the grouping of 
errors will be as follows: (1) omissions, (2) the M answer, 

(3) computation, (4) reading and vocabulary, (5) use of 
denominate numbers, (6} processes in problem solving, (7} per 
cent, (8) fractions, (9) estimating answers, (10) interpret¬ 
ing drawings and diagrams, (11} formulas. The method of 
determining to which category each answer belongs is discussed 
in the appendix at the end of this thesis.

I. OMISSIONS 

As stated on page 56 above, a large number of problems 
were omitted on the answer sheets, and therefore these were 
considered as a separate type of error. Tables XXIII and 
XXIV give the statistics of these omissions.

the boys omitted more problems than the girls. Both tables

problems omitted and achievement on the total test. 

II. THE II RESPONSE 

The reader will recall that at the end of several 
questions, one choice of answer is N, meaning !t none of 
the other three answers is correct”. Since it is impossible 
to place an error which would lead to this choice in any 
other category, such incorrect responses have been treated 
as a separate class also. Tables XTV and 2QCVI give the 
statistics on this type of error.

Table XXV shows that a very large percentage £21.36$) 
arrived at an N response even when it was wrong. This is 
probably so because a variety of incorrect solutions may 
result in an answer other than the three listed previous to 
the N. The order of types of schools making this error from 
lowest to highest percentage was urban, graded rural, town, 
and ungraded rural, the exact order of achievement on the

Table XXVI, page 62, indicates that differences in 
the number of N answers were generally significant both 
between schools and between sexes. In all but ungraded rural 
schools, girls made this error significantly more often than 
boys, although in urban and graded rural schools, the differ¬ 
ence was significant at the .05 level only.

III. COMPUTATION 


The relatively small percentage of errors found to 
be caused by inefficiency in computation is not necessarily 
a true picture of computation mistakes, since many errors 
of this type may have led to N responses. This may be 
equally true of other classifications to follow. However, 
the writer feels that for purposes of this study, the com¬ 
parison of frequency of such errors gives a valid indication 
of differences. Table XXVII, page 63, and Table XXVIII on 
page 64 summarize these differences.

The rank order of schools from lowest to highest in 

percentage of computational errors was found to be urban, town, 

graded rural, and ungraded rural. It is interesting to note 

that this is the exact order of achievement in computational 

2 

skills found by Climenhaga. This would seem to indicate 
that computational skill carries over into problem solving.

According to Table XXVIII, the only significant dif¬ 
ference in computational errors between boys and girls was 
in urban schools. However, the difference here was great 
enough to make girls significantly inferior to the boys at 
the .01 level in the total sample. 

Urban schools were significantly superior to both 
graded rural and ungraded rural at the .01 level, while 
town schools scored better than graded rural at the .05 
level, and better than ungraded schools at the .01 level. 
Graded rural schools were significantly better than ungraded 
rural schools at the .05 level of confidence. 

IV. BEADING AND VOCABULARY 

'Twenty-one of the suggested answers would be chosen 
by pupils making errors in reading or misunderstanding the 
vocabulary. Tables XXIX and XXX summarize the data for 
this type of answer.

The minus sign indicates a higher percentage of errors in

It may be seen in Table XXXII that the girls in this 
small sample handled denominate numbers much better than did 
the boys. Except in urban schools where the boys were sig¬ 
nificantly superior, the girls had fewer errors than boys in 






























70 


denominate numbers. 

Urban and town pupils were superior to both graded and 
ungraded rural pupils. No significant difference was found 
between urban and town nor between graded and ungraded rural 
students. 


VI. PROCESSES 

The reader will recall that in the chapter on related 
literature, reference was made to the effect on problem 
solving of understanding processes in arithmetic. Thirteen 
possible answers indicated errors in procedure in the problem 
test. Tables XXXIII and XXXIV on pages 71 and 72 indicate 
how these questions were handled. 

The rank order from lowest to highest percentage of 
errors is urban, town, graded rural, and ungraded rural. In 
each type of school, girls had a higher percentage of errors 
than boys.

According to Table XXXVIII, girls were significantly 
superior to boys in problems involving fractions and decimals 
in both town and ungraded rural schools. This superiority was 
also significant in the total sample. Graded rural pupils 
were found to be inferior in this type of problem to those 
from all the other types of schools.

It will be seen from Table XLII that as far as sex 
differences were concerned, the results of questions based 
on diagrams were very irregular. In urban and ungraded 
rural schools, the boys were definitely superior to the 
girls at the .01 level of signif ican.ce, while in town schools 
the boys were inferior. In graded rural schools, the girls* 
superiority was not statistically significant. In the total 
sample, the boys were significantly better than the girls at 
the .05 level. 

The achievement of pupils in urban schools was signifi¬ 
cantly superior to that of the other three schools at the .01 
level of confidence. Otherwise there was no significant 
difference among the schools. 

XI. FORMULAS 

The last classification of errors to be considered, 
and the most troublesome for the pupils, was the one where 
formulas were required for solution of the problems. More 
than one-third of the six hundred fifty-two attempted solu¬ 
tions to these questions were wrong, as Tables XLIII and 


XLIY illustrate.

In spite of the substantial differences between the 
percentages of boys and girls, only in two groups were these 
differences significant, viz. in town pupils at the .05 level, 
and in ungraded rural pupils at the .01 level. In the whole 
sample, boys were superior to girls, significant at the .01 
level. The only significant difference between schools was 
the superiority of town schools over graded rural schools 
at the .05 level.

XII. SUMMARY 

This chapter has presented the differences in dif¬ 
ficulties in problem solving between boys and girls and 
among the four types of schools. From the statistics we find 
that the percentage of errors varies greatly from one type 
of problem to another. Boys make fewer errors than do girls 
in computation, reading and vocabulary, fundamental processes, 
per cent, estimating answers, using diagrams and formulas, 
but make more mistakes than do girls in fractions and decimals 
and in denominate numbers. Urban pupils make fewer errors 
than those from other schools in almost every type of prob¬ 


lem. 




CHAPTER YII 


CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 


I. CONCLUSIONS 

On the basis of evidence found in this investigation, 
the writer has reached a number of conclusions: 

1. Alberta grade eight pupils do not achieve equally 
well in ail types of problems, doing their best work 
in problems requiring little else than computational 
skill, and their poorest work in problems requiring 
knowledge of formulas for correct solutions. Achieve¬ 
ment differs significantly with almost every type of 
problem. 

2. Diagnosis of difficulties in problem solving indicates 
that grade eight pupils make many more errors of some 
types than of others. They do very well with frac¬ 
tions and decimals and fairly well in fundamental 
processes, denominate numbers, and computation. They 
make more errors in percentage problems, reading and 
vocabulary, and estimating answers, and fall down 
badly in using diagrams and formulas. 

3. There is a considerable difference in the proficiency 
of pupils from different environments in solving 
various types of problems. With the exception of 























, 
















. 



















86 


ungraded rural pupils, who are consistently weaker 
than pupils from city, town and graded rural schools, 
the four classifications do not achieve in a fixed 
order of rank. Pupils from graded rural schools 
frequently exceed those from town schools in achieve¬ 
ment, and occasionally lead all other groups. In 
other problems, town schools reach a higher achieve¬ 
ment than any of the others, although urban schools 
are most often at the top. 

4. There is a slight difference in achievement in prob¬ 
lem solving between boys and girls in Alberta grade 
eight classes. Usually this difference favors the 
boys, but such superiority in the male is not con¬ 
sistent. In ungraded rural schools, girls frequently 
score better than boys. When the comparison is based 
on attempted solutions, the difference is most appar¬ 
ent. The reason for this seems to be that boys tend 
to omit a difficult problem, while girls will attempt 
a solution even when they are unable to get the right 
answer. 

There may be various reasons for the differences noted 
above. It seems reasonable to assume that students solve mean¬ 
ingful problems with more facility than those which mean very 
little to them. Thus, a student who has had experience in 
following a road map would have an advantage in solving that 















. . - 6 \ 













87 


type of problem over one who has never read, such a map. It 
is quite possible for a problem to be within the experience 
of a city pupil and at the same time be completely foreign 
to a pupil from the country, and vice versa. 

Since teachers in ungraded rural schools have to 
divide their instruction time among several grades, it is to 
be expected that pupils attending such schools will fail to 
reach the level of achievement of those ?/ho receive full 
time instruction. The statistics of this investigation seem 
to confirm this hypothesis. 

It seems probable, too, that many of our pupils are 
allowed to go through school without having their difficult¬ 
ies diagnosed so that individual help may be given. This 
would be true most often where a teacher T s time is limited. 

If remedial work, based on careful diagnosis, were given 
whenever a weakness is discovered, achievement might be 
expected to improve. 

As for sex differences, the reason for the slight 
superiority of the boys is possibly due to the fact that 
many of the problems are more closely related to a boy f s 
experience rather than to a girl’s. Few girls, for example, 
would be concerned with the amount of coal which may be 
stored in a bin of certain dimensions. In problems where 
experience is equalized, such as finding the cost of an 
article, the girls prove at least equal to boys in efficiency.

II. RE C OMMENDAT IONS 

After reviewing the data of this study, the writer 
makes the following recommendations: 

1. Teachers of arithmetic should strive to give their 
pupils insight into all phases of problem solving 
so that it will not be necessary for a student to 
•rely on memory alone in attempting a solution. For 
example, the diagnosis of certain problems reveals 
that many pupils do not understand the algebra of 
formulas, but will attempt a solution by trying to 
recall a procedure which to them is meaningless. 

2. Diagnostic testing on a classroom basis for purposes 
of finding pupils 1 weaknesses in problem solving 
should be frequent. Tests for this purpose, based 
on the Alberta program of studies, should be made 
available to our teachers, so that preventive and 
remedial teaching would help our students overcome 
their individual difficulties. 

3. The present trend toiflds centralizing rural schools 
should be encouraged where conditions warrant it. 
Graded rural pupils generally achieve on a par with 
town pupils, and, in problem solving, are not signifi¬ 
cantly inferior to urban pupils. Glasses from un¬ 
graded rural schools, on the other hand, fail to come 
up to the achievement of those from any of the other 














. 








































89 


schools. Since no teacher can hope to do the same 
work with each of several grades as another does with 
a single class, centralization would seem to be one 
solution to the problem of equalizing educational 
opportunities in Alberta. 

4. Writers of arithmetic text books should strive to 

reach a balance in problems suited to the interests of 
boys and girls. While the difference in achievement 
between the sexes is not great, it is possible that 
present textbooks favor the boys. A study of this 
hypothesis may prove the writer to be wrong, but 
could lead to interesting and useful findings. 

The writer feels that adopting the recommendations 
outlined above would help to equalize educational oppor¬ 
tunities in Alberta and to improve the proficiency of our 
pupils in solving problems in arithmetic.

The problem solving part of the test consists of 
thirty-one questions based on problems as stated below. 

The numbering of the questions is a continuation of that 
used in Parts I and II. Four possible answers are given 
for each question. In twenty-one cases, one of the four 
answers merely indicates that none of the other three is 
correct. 

Directions to the pupils are as follows: 

"Read each problem carefully. Do your work on scratch 
paper. Compare your answer with those given on the answer 
sheet and mark the proper box, as you did in Part II. 

"In some problems, you are asked to give only an 
approximate answer. For these particular problems, no M 
is given on the answer sheet, but you are to mark the box 
in front of the answer that is most nearly like your own." 

The problems with possible answers are analyzed on 
the following pages.

M At the beginning of the year, there were 13 girls 
and 18 boys in the third grade, 15 girls and 12 boys in 
the fourth grade, 11 girls and 16 boys in the fifth grade, 
and 13 girls and 13 boys in the sixth grade of the Jackson 
School. M 

74. ”How many girls were in the four grades? w 
•Answers: 41, 52, 111, N 

41 indicates a reading deficiency, as the answer is 
arrived at by omitting the 11 girls in the fifth grade. 
52 is the correct answer. 

Ill indicates lack of understanding processes, as 
all numbers have been added. 

Since there is a correct answer, it is impossible to 
determine how a pupil arrived at the answ r er H. 

75. f, How many more boys than girls were there in all 
four grades?” 

Answers: 108, 110, 112, M 

The first three of these are approximations of the 
total number of pupils, and therefore indicate that 
students giving any of these have used the wrong pro¬ 
cess . 

N is the correct answer.

"At the end of the year, there were 34 children in 
the fifth grade. How many more children were in 
the fifth grade at the end of the year than at the 
beginning?” 

Answers: 6, 7, 8, N 

6 indicates an error in computation, either in sub¬ 
traction or addition. 

7 is the correct answer. 

8 indicates an error in reading, as the figures for 
the sixth grade have been used. 

N is impossible to analyze. 

77. "The absences in the fifth grade during one week were 
as follows: Monday 3, Tuesday 0, Wednesday 5, Thursday 
2, Fridajr 5. What was the average number of absences 
for each day?” 

Answers: 2, 4, 5, N 

2 and 5 must be considered reading errors, as students 
giving these choices obviously do not understand the 
meaning of the term "average”. These numbers have 
merely been chosen from the list of absences on indi¬ 
vidual days. 

4 is an error in procedure, as the lack of absences on 
Tuesday has been ignored, and the average of the other 
four days has been brought to the nearest whole number. 
N is the correct answer.

$1.36 is an error in procedure, as the cost of the 
oil has not been added to the aost of the gasoline. 
$1.62 is an error in computation, as the ten from 
the units column has not been carried to the tens 
c olumn. 

$1.72 is the correct answer. 

N is impossible to analyze.

82. "Their profit was what per cent of the selling price?" 
Answers: 40%, 50%, 60%, N 

40% is the correct answer. 

50% indicates lack of knowledge of the use of per 
cent in finding profit. 

60% is a reading difficulty, as the cost rather than 
the profit has been used in computing the percentage. 

N is impossible to analyze.

2-g- ounces to Australia if postal rates are 50 for 
the first ounce and 30 for each additional ounce 
or fraction of an ounce?" 

Answers: 7-J-0, 110, 12§0, N 

7-J-0 indicates inability to use denominate numbers, 
as obviously 2-J- ounces have been added to 50. 

110 is the correct answer. 

l£-|-0 indicates a reading deficiency as a part of the 
essential information has been ignored. 2 m ounces 
have obviously been multiplied by 50. 

N is impossible to analyze.
