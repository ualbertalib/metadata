SUMMARY 


The title of this thesis is f *A Review of the Evidence on 
the Problem of Why Youth Leave School. 1 * 

This thesis undertook to review critically and analytically 
the findings and methods of study of the problem of youth leaving 
school before graduation. This statement is, in fact, a statement 
of the problem of the thesis. A primary purpose of this study is 
to refine techniques and methods of research in the area of early 
school leaving. 

To obtain data on the problem, the departments of education 
and other reliable sources of information in many centres of the 
world were contacted. The countries contacted include the United 
States, England, Scotland, Australia, Mew Zealand, the Union of 
South Africa, France, Norway, Sweden, and Denmark. Replies were 
received in every instance and these indicated an awareness of the 
loss through exodus of youth from school. In most cases, concern 
for better school retention was shown. 

Information from these countries was reviewed with particular 
emphasis on methods and findings of the research work. All studies 
from 1940 to the present time are included in the main body of data 5 
major studies before 1940 are briefly surveyed. Reference throughout 
is to students in junior and senior high school; in other words, to 
students who have completed grade seven, but have not graduated from 
their senior year of school. 

In planning a basis for the organization of this data, it was 
found that four major groupings were apparent.

These research reports are reviewed under four sub-headings. 
These are, first, background, which includes information on the 
investigator, place, time and sample; the method of research; the 
findings of the research; and an evaluation of the methods and the 
findings. In addition, the leading methods and chief findings are 
summarized, and a list of recommendations for future studies on 
school retention is offered.

CHAPTER I 


BACKGROUND OF THE PROBLEM 

The evidence of leading Canadian 1 and American 2 studies 
on school retention indicates that in the average public 
school system, fifty per cent of the students who enter 
high school do not remain to graduate. This phenomenon 
of youth leaving school poses a grave problem in the face 
of current twentieth century world conditions. As Dr. James 
B. Conant, president of Harvard University, asserted: 

Tt To the extent that we now fail to educate the 
potential talent of each generation, we are wasting 
one of the country’s greatest assets. In the world 
today, a highly industrialized nation simply cannot 
afford this kind of waste. Yet no one familiar 
with the situation would deny that such a waste 
exists.” 3 

This point of view is particularly that of the American 
educational system and is not completely accepted, for 
instance, in Canada and the British Isles, In this study, 
however, the writer makes certain assumptions. First, that 
a waste of potentially valuable persons does exist and that 
this waste creates a serious man-power problem, particularly 
in the fields of science, technology, and commerce. Second,

secondary education should constitute a minimum of training 
for all youth who are able to benefit from it. 

The ideal of secondary education today should be to 
enroll, retain and meet the needs of those adolescents who 
are not yet ready for gainful occupation or for higher 
education. It is consistent with a democratic philosophy 
that the schools must serve f, all the children of all the 
people.That the schools of this continent are aware of 
the challenge and that they are hopeful of eventually 
meeting it is indicated by the following declaration, 
developed and endorsed by school superintendents in the 
United States and Canada with cities of population greater 
than 200,000: 

The High School is no longer selective in its 
membership. Emphasis is placed on holding power. 

All youths of high school age should be kept in 
High School until they complete the high school 
program. The High School enrolls all the children 
of all the people, and provides a program that 
makes their attendance worth while. 4 

This platform expresses the ideal of secondary educ¬ 
ation, one which will be approached only when the schools 
survey and evaluate their work critically, and study 
necessary adjustments to changing social and educational

demands and to a population which is drawn from all economic 
and social levels. Until such a time, a complete high school 
education will continue to be virtually denied to half of 
our school population, a situation which, in the final 
analysis, is a serious threat to democracy.

CHAPTER II 


THE PROBLEM 

This thesis undertakes a critical review of the findings 
and methods of study of the problem of youth leaving school 
before graduation• Such a bibliographic summary and evalu¬ 
ation of research on why youth leave school early should be 
of value in developihg methods of attacking the problem 
in Alberta. 

To obtain data on the problem, the departments of edu¬ 
cation and other reliable sources of information were contacted 
in the following countries: Canada, The United States, England, 
Australia, New Zealand, The Union of South Africa, Scotland, 
Prance, Norway, Sweden and Denmark. Replies were received 
in every instance. These indicated an awareness of the loss 
through exodus of youth from schools and in most cases a 
concern for better school retention. 

The United States has carried out an imposing number 
of studies on national, state, county, and city levels. 

Other countries have not done as much. Canada has conducted 
one major study on a national scale, that by the Canadian 
Research Committee on Practical Education, a committee of 
the Canadian Education Association. A second study, basically 
a statistical review, is now being carried out by the Trustees 
Association of Canada. But the first valid and penetrating

study in Canada on any level, whether national, provincial, 
city, town or community, is yet to be made® 

New Zealand and the Union of South Africa have made no 
studies in the field of high school mortality rates, record¬ 
ing only attendance figures* Australia, with its statis¬ 
tics showing a high rate of premature school leaving, has 
become much interested in the problem# New South Wales’ ini¬ 
tial step to change the trend is to develop an effective 
Guidance and Career Counselling program in its schools* In 
England the Central Advisory Council for Education, working 
under the Ministry of Education, is at present conducting 
an extensive national study of early school leavers* In the 
last two years Scotland has published findings of six studies 
relating to the problem.**" 

France too has surveyed the status of school holding 
power with the Ministry of National Education publishing 
the results in 1953. 1 2 In Sweden, the Central Office for 
Military Service is at present carrying out a questionnaire 
study of students who left before graduation in order to as¬ 
certain their education at the time of leaving and to find 
out their reasons for leaving school. This data will be turned

over to the Koyal Board of Education in Sweden for investi¬ 
gation and analysis. In Oslo, Norway, two education officials 
are studying the problem. 

Information from these countries will be reviewed with 
particular emphasis on methods and findings of the research 
work. All studies from 1940 to the present time will be 
included in the main body of data; major studies before 1940 
will be briefly surveyed. 

Reference throughout will be to the students in junior 
and senior high schools, that is, to students who have com¬ 
pleted grade seven but have not graduated from their senior 
year of school.

CHAPTER III 


CLASSIFICATION AND PLAN OF PROCEDURE 
CLASSIFICATION OF STUDIES 

The studies on the problem of why youth leave school 
are classified on the basis of the objectives of the study 
or the sources of the data of the study* There are four 
categories under which all the research on the problem may 
be classified* 

Factual reports of incidence of drop-outs. 

Studies of factors related to early school leaving. 

Statements of drop-outs giving reasons for leaving school. 

Statements of experts giving reasons for students leav¬ 
ing school. 

Each category will be discussed in more detail. 

FACTUAL REPORTS OF INCIDENCE OF DROP-OUTS. 

o ....... 

These reports record the actual number of students, 
usually by age, grade, and sex, who have terminated their 
high school careers. They are in the nature of normative 
surveys, census, and statistical reports, usually comparing 
school population figures of smaller units such as states or 
provinces, cities and towns, with national figures. 

STUDIES OF FACTORS RELATED TO EARLY SCHOOL LEAVING. 

There are many selective factors that operate to in¬ 
fluence the extent of student persistence in school.

These factors, logically isolated, should operate different¬ 
ly at different levels. Low average intelligence should be¬ 
come a progressively more important factor as a child moves 
up through the high school grades. Attitudes, likes, and 
dislikes can hardly cause School leaving before age fifteen 
because of compulsory attendance laws. The operation of 
these attitudes is somewhat modified by the parents, but 
once the adolescent can earn his own money, his attitudes 
begin to determine behavior. 

Also, different factors operate at different levels 
and an absence of one doesn’t preclude the operation of 
another. Many students who have high intelligence ratings 
quit school before graduation; when intelligence is not a 
factor, attitudes could still operate. Attitudes frequent¬ 
ly relate to abilities and interests. A student who is 
mechanically inclined may drop out of a school if subjected 
to a narrowly academic curriculum. Did he do so because of 
the curriculum or the cluster of abilities and interests? 

It is apparent that the problem of early school leaving 
is concerned with a multiplicity of factors operating 
as clusters. While one investigator 4 of factors associated 
with school withdrawal had developed a list of 301, the fol¬ 
lowing eighty five appear to include those which have been 
found of enough significance to be listed for the purposes 
of this study. They are grouped under four categories:

OPINIONS OF DROP-OUTS 


Reasons for leaving school, as stated by the students 
themselves, are obtained through interviews, questionnaires, 
and check lists. There are some decided limitations to the 
data obtained in this manner. The student often may be una¬ 
ware of the causes of his departure. In some cases a student 
may be so embarrassed by having left school that he may give 
a fictitious reply. In other words, students vail frequent¬ 
ly offer plausible explanations to place themselves and their 
parents in the best light. It is in the nature of human 
behavior to use defense mechanisms 5 , in most cases unconscious 
1y, to preserve one*s sense of personal worth. Accordingly 
frustration, anxiety, regression, repression, displacement, 
projection, compensation, and in particular rationalization 
would tend to color student opinions and therefore reduce 
the validity of the findings. 

Many students do not know the fundamental reasons for 
their leaving. They are most aware, all too often painfully, 
of the last incident which seemed to force them out of school. 
Others give excuses rather than causes and their statements 
must be closely examined to see whether or not there is ne¬ 
cessary and sufficient sequence in time to provide cause. 

The most frequent excuse appears to be "I did not like school”

This could be interpreted as "I could not do the work re¬ 
quired by the school 11 , but one cannot be sure. 

After reviewing several student opinion studies, Galen 
Jones enunciated the following four conclusions which should 

A 

be kept in mind with regard to studies of this nature: 

(1) There is an element of truth in the state¬ 
ments made by both girls and boys as to why they 
leave school, but there is a question in the minds 
of the people who make the studies as to whether 
you can take them absolutely at their face value. 

(2) There is evidence that more serious and 
fundamental conditions are basic — frequently 
regardless of the reasons given. 

(3) A large proportion of both sexes, when 
interviewed, were unable to do more than express 
a lack of interest in school, or a hatred for it. 

All of that went into one generalization - they 

were just not interested in school, or they dis¬ 
liked it. 

(4) The preponderance of reasons emphasizes 
dissatisfaction with some aspect of school life. 

In most cases, those stressing economic difficul¬ 
ties were also victims of retardation and failure. 

This is not saying that economic conditions are 
not present, but there is always the question as 
to whether they are the major reasons for dropping 
out of school. 


OPINIONS OF EXPERTS 

This part of the thesis will review statements by various 
education authorities who indicate those reasons which they 
feel are responsible for causing early school leaving. 

While these opinions, based on reading and experience, may 
be regarded as expert, they nevertheless constitute the least 
valid type of information because of the absence of actual

CHAPTER IV 


REVIEW OF RELATED RESEARCH 

YOUR CHILD LEAVES SCHOOL 1 
Baoteround 

This title reports a study of 12,124 graduates and 
14,219 drop-outs from Canadian schools during 1948, conducted 
by the Canadian Research Committee on Practical Education, 
This was a national committee, comprising representatives 
of national organizations in commerce, industry, agriculture, 
labour, the home and education. The study was designed to 
collect information on students withdrawing from school, 
either by graduation, or by dropping out before graduation. 
With regard to these students, the investigation attempts 
to show why they have left school and what they have started 
to do. 

A later study 2 traces the progress of these pupils to 
determine how well they are getting along in their jobs 
and how adequate their education has proven.

Method 


A first draft of the central committee’s questionnaire 
was studied by provincial committees. After a number of 
revisions it was approved by all committees and distributed 
to the schools by officials in the Departments of Education. 

In the instructions to the principals these points 
were emphasized: 

A questionnaire card was to be filled out for every 
pupil from grade VII up who withdrew from school during 
the year, except for those who transferred to another school; 
graduates of high school who went on to another institution 
for further training were to be included, also drop-outs 
who went on for further training to business or other 
private trade schools. 

The information on the card was to b© entered by the 
principal, or another member or members of the staff 
selected by him. 

If the school had an organized guidance program it 
was suggested that the guidance counsellors be selected 
to record the information. 

The card should be completed at the time the pupil 
withdrew and where possible, the information should be obtained 
during an individual interview with the pupil. 

The data from the returned questionnaire were tabulated 
under a general sample for the provinces, and a selected

city sample. These data were analyzed for each province 
and for each of the selected cities separately. 

In this study a graduate is a student who has completed 
successfully Junior Matriculation or its equivalent. A 
drop-out is one who has not completed Junior Matriculation 
or its equivalent, and who has ceased to attend any school, 
except a private trade school. 

Findings 

The major findings of this reasearch may he summarized 
as answers to the following questions: 

How many pupils drop out? How many graduate? 

What are the reasons for dropping out? 

What factors are associated with dropping out? 

What do drop-outs and graduates do after they leave school? 

HOW MANY PUPILS DROP OUT? HOW MANY GRADUATE? 

The data reveal the following information: 

Among 100 boys who leave grad© VII or higher grades 
during the year: 

28 are early drop-outs, from grades VII, VIII, or IX. 

31 are late drop-outs, from grade X or above. 

24 are graduates who accept employment. 

17 are graduates who seek further training. 

Among 100 girls who leave during a year: 

21 are early drop-outs. 

30 are late drop-outs. 

22 are graduates who seek employment. 

27 are graduates who seek further training.

In other words, of 100 boys and 100 girls who reach 
grade VII, 59 boys and 51 girls become drop-outs. At the 
grade VII level or above, and excluding the school systems 
of Catholic Quebec and Newfoundland, the findings of the 
Committee on Practical Education give a conservative estimate 
of over 73,000 drop-outs a year. When those who graduate 
are added, the total estimated annual withdrawal becomes 
133,685. 

WHAT ARE THE REASONS FOR DROPPING OUT? 

Reasons for dropping out are often interrelated. In 
many cases, several reasons apply to one drop-out so that 
percentages overlap and total over one hundred.

Personal reasons include attitude of parents, opportunity 
for a good position, maladjustment, illness, and others.

The percentage break-down for each separate reason 
showed that: 

Personal reasons are least important, and are of about 
equal significance for boy and girl drop-outs* 

Economic reasons are second in importance, and are more 
frequent for boys than for girls. 

Reasons relating to the school are most important, and 
are much more frequent for boys than for girls. 

The most important single reason, lack of interest, 
is common in all grades and is strongly associated with lack 
of ability, desire to earn money, attitude of parents, and 
maladjustment. 

More reasons are given for early drop-outs, while 
later drop-outs usually leave for single and specific reasons. 

WHAT FACTORS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH DROPPING OUT? 

Sex of Pupils — In this sample, boys have about two chances 
in five of graduation, while girls have two chances in four. 
While this difference does not permit accurate prediction of 
dropping out, the difference is significant. The two reasons 
relating to the school which are much less frequent among 
girls are lack of interest and unsuitability of curriculum. 
This prompts the Committee to pose the question of whether 
or not the school has provided curricula and staffs more 
suited to the needs of girls.

Repetition of Grades — Pupils who dropped out of grades 
VII or VIII repeated an average of 1.38 grades. The number 
of grades repeated decreases among later drop-outs. This 
study shows that grade failure is a danger signal indicative 
of early dropping out, and should be so recognized by teachers 
and counsellors. 

Age of Pupils — Pupils being overage, whether due to 
repetition of grades or to other reasons, is closely related 
to dropping out of school. 

Learning Capacity — Learning capacity above average is 
closely associated with graduation. Among boys above average 
in this factor, three out of every four are graduates. Rates 
are more favourable for girls. 

The group which is average in learning capacity forms 
about 60 per cent of the total. Of these, about 60 per cent 
of the boys and about 50 per cent of the girls drop out. 

Below average learning capacity is strongly associated 
with dropping out. Among boys, S3 out of 35 are drop-outs. 

The rates are but slightly more favourable for girls. 

Economic Status of the Pupil 8 s Family — The study reveals 
that pupils from families of below average economic status 
are more likely to be early drop-outs. Below average economic 
status is highly indicative of early dropping out. 

Occupation of the Pupil * s Father — There appears to be a 
strong relationship, either direct or indirect, between

occupation of the father and dropping out. The most 
important findings are: 

Occupation of the father is strongly associated 
with rates of dropping out. 

Differences in retention of pupils from various 
occupational groups are to some degree independent 
of economic status and learning capacity. 

Boys and girls from the clerical group as well as from 
the professional and proprietor groups tend to take 
further training. 

There are sharp differences in retention between 
farm boys and girls. Twenty-five per cent more farm 
girls graduate, and bout two-thirds of the girl 
graduates seek further training. Nevertheless, 
farm boys tend more to further training than do the 
skilled worker group. 

The worker groups tend to take employment rather than 
proceed to further training after graduation.

Data from this table show conclusively that the average 
initial wages of graduates, both boys and girls, exceed those 
of drop-outs. Moreover, the average wages increase by grade 
last attended. The evidence shows too, that boys receive 
higher initial wages than do girls. 

Relation of Employment to Vocational Courses — All jobs 
entered by vocation school graduates and drop-outs were 
classed as having: 

Specific relation to school training. 

Some relation to school training. 

Little or no relation to school training. 

For graduates, the results show that over 80 per cent 
of the boys and over 90 per cent of the girls enter jobs 
having some relation to school training. Most of these 
jobs have a specific relation to school training. 

For drop-outs, results are not so definite. It 
appears that 60 per cent of the boys and girls enter jobs 
having some relation to their school training. Specific 
relationship of school training to jobs is more common for 
girls who had vocational training than for boys.

EVALUATION 

What has the report shown? It has shown: 

That over 73,000 boys and girls who reach grade Vll drop 
out of school each year, insufficiently trained for life work 
and for citizenship. 

That education is faced with the tremendous challenge to 
make the schools conform more closely to the needs of Canada ! s 


youth

23 


That a great deal needs to be done for the parents to 
help overcome school costs before educational opportunity 
becomes meaningful for their children. 

What are the implications ? 

Is there such a thing as equal opportunity for education? 

Is it sound educational philosophy to continue a 
predominantly academic type of curriculum in the face of the 
fcnown fact that only a small minority of the students ever 
go on to university? 

Are the schools doing the jobs they should? 

What are the Limitations ? 

There is no evidence that the Committee obtained 
representation in their general sample in the same proportion 
as the number from large cities, small cities, towns and 
rural areas is represented in the general population. 

It is necessary to be cautious in ascribing causality 
because some other factor or factors may be the reasons or 
cause of an observed relationship. Also relationships may 
be concomitant—two factors may be the result of a third 
factor. 

There is always a chance of undetected wrong emphasis; 
any statement of result should be treated with some degree 
of hesitancy. 

The data on the questionnaires were given by principals 
whose opinions may have been coloured on such items as

economic status, reasons for leaving school, and even 
general ability of the students. 

The study is based on the experience of one year only. 
It is possible that there were economic factors in 1948, at 
variance with normal conditions, which might influence the 
results. 

In some cases every question was not fully answered.

CHAPTER V 


EARLY SCHOOL LEAVERS 1 
Background 

The National Child Labor Committee has pioneered 
efforts to gain understanding of the problem of why so 
many boys and girls leave school before graduation. The 
Committee’s investigator, Dr. Harold Dillon, Specialist 
in Educational Problems, visited a number of areas of 
differing characteristics, and, in association with local 
authorities, carried on a number of studies. 

The Committee made a survey of young people who left 
school voluntarily in 1945-46. Five communities were 
selected for the study. These were the towns of Jackson 
and Lansing in Michigan; Cleveland and Cincinnati in Ohio; 
and Indianapolis, Indiana. While this sample does not 
provide a completely representative cross-section of the 
population, it does contain elements from metropolitan 
centres, towns and rural areas, and reflects their social, 
economic, racial, and cultural differences.

Method 

For all students chosen for the study, complete 
personal data cards were prepared. From this file of 
former students, a ten per cent sampling was taken for 
detailed study. Substitutions were made only when it was 
difficult to arrange for interviews with former students 
or when it was impossible to find school records. 

For each subject in the study, all available objective 
data were drawn from their school records. Where it was 
possible to do so, records as far back as the third grade 
were used. Next, opinions were secured from two or three 
teachers who knew the student before he left school. In 
this opinionnaire were included such items as qualities, 
characteristics and behavior patterns of the youth; whether 
he seemed interested in school; whether he was an attendance 
problem. The final step in the procedure was a personal interview. 

Dr. Dillon felt that these three lines of inquiry 
would yield information that would be valid and useful 
in determining how the holding power of the schools may 
be increased. In the study 1,360 school leavers are 
represented, but complete data were not available for all 
of them. 

The personnel who gathered the data and conducted the 
interviews were selected on the basis of their knowledge 
of youth and their problems. Teachers, counselors, 
visiting teachers, principals, and attendance workers 
comprise the group. They were given some basic training

to acquaint them with the objectives of the study and the 
methods to be employed in gathering data. This was part¬ 
icularly important for interviewing since it was necessary 
to use the same techniques in all the centres. Dr. Dillon 
met frequently with the people gathering the information to 
make certain the data would be as objective as possible. 

Findings 

The chief findings may be summarized under the 
general categories of home conditions, school conditions, 
reasons for leaving school, employment, and implications 
of education.

The percent of school-leavers coming from broken homes 
was ten per cent higher than the national figures for the 
age group. The majority lived with both parents.

Eighty-eight per cent came from homes in which English 
was used. Less than eleven per cent spoke a foreign tongue, 
which would suggest that language was not a barrier to 
remaining in school. The majority (63 per cent) came from 
families with children under sixteen years of age. It would 
appear that there may be some relationship between the factor 
of children under sixteen years of age in the family and 
school retention, but the significance of this for the school 
leaving group cannot b© determined without having the same 
information for those who remain in school. Without such 
information it would appear that this factor may best be 
included with the economic factor because the smaller the 
family, the easier it is to keep the children in school. 

In relation to the factor, occupation of parents, it 
appears that parents of early leavers seem to be typical, 
average wag© earners. While the data on type of employment 
were incomplete, it is safe to say that semi-skfclled work 
predominated. Factory work was given most frequently as 
the occupation of the father; clerking, restaurant work, 
and selling were given most frequently by those mothers 
who worked outside of their own homes. Skilled work, 
clerical, and stenographic work were also represented but 
not as frequently. In general then, school leavers seem to 
be children of average wage earners, but this is not a 
distinguishing factor, since many children of average wage 
earners complete high school.

School Conditions — 


Having ascertained the family background of the early 
school leaver, Dr. Dillon then tabulated and discussed the 
data on the school leavers themselves. In his study of 1300 
school leavers in five communities, eight per cent more boys 
than girls left school before graduation. Several factors 
might be operative to explain why boys make up the greater 
percentage of drop-outs. These factors might be that more 
jobs are available for boys, and at higher wages, than for 
girls; that the curriculum Is more suited to the needs of 
the girls.

Dillon gathered data to prove or disprove the claim 
that schools cannot do much for the early school leavers 

because the students were new to the local school system. 

He found little grounds for such © claim. Of approximately 
1,100 school leavers in four of the communiiiies Studied, 
eighty-three per cent had been born in the state where they

were attending school at the time they dropped out. The 
same data for individual cities shows a range from 73% 
to 91%. The great majority of school leavers had five to 
seven years of contact with their school system before 
withdrawing from it. 

This study reveals that Grades X and IX, in that 
order, suffer the greatest mortality rates. Dillon feels 
that these grades very often are peaks in accumulated 
pupil maladjustment over the years. The challenge is

Primarily a matter of recognizing trouble at an early stage. 
Action can then be taken in time so that maladjustments are 
not permitted to become cumulative. Dillon is further dis¬ 
heartened by the fact that more than five per cent were in 
grade XII when they left school, and nearly twenty per cent 
were in grade XI. He feels that since they were so close to 
graduation, it is a matter of serious concern whether every 















31 


effort was made to encourage them to complete their work. 

Table VI whows a trend which indicates that boys leave 
school earlier than girls. Twenty-nine per cent of the girls 
remained until grade XI or XII as compared with eighteen per 
cent of the boys. 

The majority of school leavers had made several transfers 
from one school to another. Unless there is proper orientation, 
confusion and misunderstanding in meeting the situations in a 
new school may make the youth develop a "lost" feeling, 
resulting in the wish to leave school. 

In junior high school only 60% of the drop-outs had 
good attendance records, and 40% in high school. Attendance 
data become significant when Dillon points out that three- 
fourths of the school leavers were in attendance 90% of the 
time in their elementary grades; 60% of the school leavers 
were in attendance 90% of the time in junior high school. 

In the senior high school this record dropped to about 40% 
in attendance for more than 90% of the time. There seems 
to be a real need for serious consideration of attendance 
records as evidence of maladjustment that may be due to 
any number of underlying causes. 

In discussing I.Q. as a factor in school leaving, 

Dr. Dillon found that about 20% had I.Q. f s above 105, and 
40% above 95. It is fair to assume that the 40% whose 
I.Q. 1 s were above 95 were educable in programs of the 
secondary schools as they are constituted today.

About half the school leavers had repeated grades, 
and for most of these (70 per cent) grade repetition started 
in the elementary school. It is evident that "trouble signals" 
appear early enough to be recognized and dealt with in time 
to prevent maladjustment. The findings showed too, that 
approximately three out of four school leavers failed subjects 
on either the junior or the senior high school level, and 
that nearly half of these failed in three or more subjects. 
Grades most vulnerable to failure were the first, third, and 
fourth in the elementary schools—ninth in the junior, and 
tenth in the senior high school. 

While Dillon found that 58% of the early school leavers 
who repeated grades had I.Q.*s below 95, he also found that 
approximately 30% of the grade repeaters had I.Q.*s of 95 
or higher, and that 11% had I.Q. f s over 105. On the one hand, 
the schools must provide experiences and standards of achieve¬ 
ment appropriate to those of limited intelligence; on the 
other hand, the schools must seriously consider the fact 
that significant numbers who repeat grades have I.Q. f s that 
are normal or above normal.

While these reasons are subject to such limitations as may 
be the result of immaturity and rationalization, they are 
nevertheless significant. The individual presumably felt 
that the reasons he gave were those which motivated him to 
terminate his schooling. 

Most of the school leavers had not consulted a teacher 
or a counselor before dropping out of school. It should 
be a serious concern of schools that students ignored to 
that extent, the available counselling services. Sound 
rapport must be developed between guidance services and 
students. 

The school leavers suggested part-time work, smaller 
classes, guidance services, and understanding teachers as 
aids to keeping young people in school. The following table 
is worth examining to note the frequency of suggestions.

The former students were about evenly divided on the 
question of whether they regretted leaving school. Those who 
did not regret gave reasons that focused heavily upon feelings 
of insecurity—"was failing”, "not interested in school work”, 
"teachers were unsympathetic”, "nobody cared”. Those who did 
regret felt that additional education would have enabled them 
to get better and more suitable jobs at better pay. Others 
wished they had stayed to receive their diplomas. It is 
especially unfortunate that this latter group had not been 
reached by the school before they left. 

Employment — 

Approximately 800 youth answered the question, "From 
whom did you seek advice on occupational problems?” Table IX 
shows further that students fail to use resources within the 
school to assist them with their problems.

The lack of job stability might point to lack of 
counsel in job selection. About two-thirds had had only 
one or two jobs during the survey period (1945^46), but 
five per cent had five or more jobs. About half the jobs 
were sales or factory work.

Approximately 85$ of the early school leavers entered 
work directly from school. Nearly half obtained their job 
by "shopping around ”, while nearly 45$ obtained a job 
through a friend. Only 5$ were placed on the job through 
school guidance facilities. It is likely that most school 
leavers got their jobs first, then withdrew. Approximately 
80$ felt that school did not prepare them for their jobs, 
possibly because the school did not get them jobs. 

Nearly 40$ stated that none of the subjects taken in 
school was helpful to them in their work. Those who did 
find suojects helpful, listed tool subjects which correlate 
quite closely with the type of employment secured by the 
youth, namely: mathematics, English, and business subjects. 
Other courses mentioned included shop, home economics, 
science, social studies, and physical education. Photography, 
journalism, mechanical drawing, and art printing were also 
listed as helpful. 

Only about 20$ of the early school leavers had taken 
additional training since leaving school, each as short¬ 
term courses or on-the-job training afforded by employers. 

Teacher appraisal of early school leaver — Two-thirds 
or more of the teacher judgments of personality characteristics 
indicated that the early school leaver did not show to any 
marked degree, the characteristics commonly associated with 
maladjustment, such as being unhappy or worried, secretive

or seclusive, immature, overly aggressive, trouble making, 
or sullen and resentful of authority. At the same time, 
about the same proportion of judgments suggested that 
school leavers were attendance problems, lacked initiative, 
and had no interest in school. A smaller majority of 
judgments indicated that they lacked skill in tool subjects 
and had poor study habits. 

Seventy per cent of the judgments indicated early 
leavers got along well with teachers and other pupils. 
According to the teachers, about half of the school leavers 
had been counseled on the value of continuing in school— 
a marked contrast to the school leavers 1 replies to the 
question. 

There was a marked similarity of teacher judgments in 
the four cities from which data were obtained. 

As far as the teachers were able to judge the early 
school leaver does not seem to be markedly different from 
other students. Since more than half of the teachers 1 
judgments were unfavorable on skill factors, and only about 
one-third were unfavorable on personality characteristics 
associated with maladjustment, Dillon raises the question as 
to whether anything was done to improve the skills—a 
relatively simple matter in comparison with assistance in 
emotional problems. Because of such contradictory judgements 
as 50% agreement that school leavers participated in class 
work and discussions, and 70% agreement that they were not

interested in school work, Dr, Dillon suggests that many 

teachers lack knowledge of their students. He says that: 

If the schools are to recognize the needs 
of youth and attempt to provide for them , recording 
of all pertinent experiences of students and sharing 
of records by school personnel are essential 
requirements, 2 

Symptoms of Dropping Out of School — From these findings 
Dr. Dillon suggested seven symptoms of dropping out of 
school: 

A decline in achievement 

Grade repetition in elementary school 

Many failures In junior and senior high school 

Decline in attendance 

Frequent transfers 

Signs of insecurity 

Lack of interest in school

Reoomfliendations — Dillon also discusses seventeen specific 


recommendations for reducing the number of drop-outs. 

Briefly they are as follows: 

Know the student as an individual 
Obtain the student f s confidence 

Provide an educational program wherein the students 
can experience achievement 

G-ive grad© repeaters something new 

Demonstrate relation between education and life 

Extend social experiences 

Grive some personal recognition 

Recognize signs of trouble 

Provide for above-average students 

Establish a good record system 

Make use of the record 

Help students select the right courses 

Begin counselling early 

Allow time for home visits 

Secure parent interest and cooperation 

Secure public support 

EVALUATION 

Dillon has presented a set of valuable findings in 
the area of school retention. His report is the most widely 
read and studied of any researches in the area. Since the 
sample was drawn from such diversified communities, the 
composite results cannot be generalized to other populations.

It would have been worth while to tabulate separate findings 
for each of the five communities thereby making it possible 
to at least infer what might be expected in comparable 
communities. 

This study could have been made more valid if Dr. 

Dillon had set up a control group mad© up of boys and girls 
who remained in school. A comparison of findings might have 
resulted in a list of factors which distinguish the early 
school leaver from the student who remains in school to 
graduation. 

While findings appear to be generally sound, the 
following factors tent to reduce their validity: 

Complete data for the 1560 cases was impossible to 
obtain because of inadequate records. This situation was 
often caused by the failure of schools to forward scholastic 
and personal records when students transferred to new school 
systems. All too often, though, it was caused by inadequate 
record keeping in the systems studied. It would probably 
be quite fair to say that this inadequacy would be an 
obstacle to a thorough study on school retention in the 
majority of school systems in North America. 

Not all of those who interviewed the students had had 
previous experience of this kind before. The preliminary 
training they received could not give them the equivalent

of the skills and techniques of the trained interviewer. 

In the interview method there is always the problem

basic problems; others responded only with "shoulder

themselves. 

The subjective opinions of the teachers were shown to 


be unreliable

CHAPTER VI 


MINNESOTA STUDIES IN RURAL EDUCATION 


The State of Minnesota has done extensive and penetrating 
invesitgation into the problem of retention of pupils in rural schools. 
The poor.record of high school attendance of rural youth in Minnesota 
has been of much concern to those who believe that a minimum of twelve 

years of education is necessary for effective living in any community, 

1 

urban or rural. Increasing concern over the differences between urban 

and rural youth in the number of years of formal schooling is evidenced 

by the increasing number of studies in Minnesota attempting to quantify 

and analyze various aspects of the problem. At the present time the 

2 

results of a fruitful community study are being studied. 

This chapter will survey in detail the available research which 
has been conducted in Minnesota since 191*0.

I. EDUCATION OF THE FARM POPULATION IN MINNESOTA 
Background 

This report is the first in a series of studies related to the

other population is classified as rural.

education or rural youth in Minnesota. It was made by Lowry Nelson, 
Rural Sociologist of the Minnesota Agricultural Experimental Station 
in 19U0. 

Method 

Nelson examined and interpreted the 19k0 state and national 
census figures dealing with school attendance. 

Findings 

1. 3h 19U0 Minnesota ranked fortieth in school attendance 
figures with 52.7 percent of the 16-17 year old native white farm youth 
attending school, 

2. Minnesota ranked forty-seventh among the states in percentage 
of farm boys and thirty-first in percentage of farm girls attending high 
school. 

3. When the state is compared with the United States on the basis 
of the I 9 I 4 O census as to the proportion of all school age youth, rural 
and urban, who attend school, Minnesota is above the average for the 
country as a whole. 

U. Among the rural farm population, the proportion of the 6 to 
lb year olds attending school is above the average for the nation, 

5. The percentage of school attendance for farm youth 15 years 
and older is lower than for the country. Completion of grade eight 
brings the first marked drop with the second coming between the ages of 
fifteen and sixteen. 

6 . Nelson concludes that the rural drop-out rate seems to be 
closely related to Minnesota's compulsory attendance law which requires

that a child attend school until he is sixteen or has completed the 
eighth grade. 

Evaluation 

It appears that finding number six is justified in terms of the 
five preceding ones. 

It is very likely that in bringing to light the comparatively 
low attendance of farm youth in Minnesota high schools, Lowry Nelson 
supplied the impetus that resulted in many succeeding studies of rural 
education in that state. 

II. MARKED PROGRESS MADE BY MINNESOTA BJ RURAL 

EDUCATION b 

Background 

Ten years after his initial study. Nelson once again surveyed the 
census figures tc appraise the status of rural youth attendance at that 
time • 

Method 

In this study, Lowry Nelson again analyzed state and national 
figures of 19k0 and 1950. 

He studied the school population trends as indicated by these census 
reports.

Nelson found that the high school attendance was increasing throughout 
the country. He felt the rise in percentage attendance was largely due to 
bringing in more of the farm youth to town and city schools, and attempted 
to explain the increasing popularity of high school with rural youth in 
the following ways: 

(1) the tendency to raise compulsory attendance age to 
sixteen, 

(2) growing recognition that successful farming requires 
more training, 

(3) reduction of opportunities of young people in farming 
due to technological advances, and the consequent 
necessity of preparing for non-agricultural vocations, 

(Ii) general spread of the idea that everybody should go 
through school.

(£) some possibility that the reorganization and consolidation 
of schools which took place during the decade encouraged 
attendance, 

(6) educational work of farm organizations may be promoting 

rural school attendance^ continuing work of teachers and 
administrators also may have helped to establish high 
school as a normal goal for farm young folk. 

Evaluation 

In answering the question M Why is high school now more popular 
with rural youth? n Nelson offers logical reasons which no doubt 
influence increased school retention of rural youth to varying degrees.

III. ARE MINNESOTA'S FARM YOUTH IN SCHOOL? 

Background 

This report is the first in a series of three by the authors on 
variations in school attendance between counties in Minnesota and the 
differences that exist between school attendance of farm boys and farm 
girls. Dr. Marshall is now the Chairman of the Department of Rural 
Sociology at the University of Wisconsin, while Dr. Peterson is the Head 
of the Department of Agricultural Education at the University of 
Minnesota. When they began this and their subsequent studies on rural 
education in 19^0, they worked together at the University of Minnesota.

a special U.S. Census tabulation, 19U0, not appearing in the published 
Census volumes. Since the figures for the 111 and 15 year age group and 
the 16 and 17 year-olds are so similar, this report deals with the latter 
group. The 87 counties are divided into four groups with 22 counties in 
each group, except the lowest, which includes only 21 counties. 

Findings 

1 • The better farming areas were usually not the areas where the 
highest school attendance of farm boys is found for the 16-17 year age 
group. Sixteen out of 22 counties in terms of land value fall in the 
third and fourth lowest quarters of school attendance for their 16 and 17 
year old farm boys. 

2. There does not appear to be any definite geographic pattern in 
the distribution of school attendance. In general, the northeastern 
counties of Minnesota were sending the largest proportion of farm boys 

to school while the central and western counties had lower school attendance 
than other parts of Minnesota. 

3. A comparison of counties indicated great variation in school attend¬ 
ance. School attendance in Cook County for example, was proportionately 
triple that of Brown County. 

I|. School attendance of farm girls 16-17 years of age followed the same 
general pattern as for boys and the variation between counties was about 
the same, but the differences in rank order of counties seem to indicate 
that there mightbe different reasons for the variations in attendance 
for boys compared with giris.

Marshall and Peterson drew two principal conclusions: 


(1) Rural youth in Minnesota are not getting the schooling 
to which they are entitled. 

(2) Variations in school attendance between counties and 
between schools in the same counties indicate a grave 
lack of balance in educational opportunities in Minnesota. 

Evaluation 

This is mainly a statistical report indicating school attendance 
trends on the county level. The findings are accurate and the conclusions 
justified in terras of the data examined. The study further emphasized 
the problem of early school leaving of rural youth in Minnesota.

IV. FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH SCHOOL ATTENDANCE 
Background 

The sample in this 19W Marshall and Peterson study was made up 
of farm boys 16-1? years of age. Attendance of farm girls was not 
included since the attendance of the boys and girls in this age group 
shows a high correlation - Pearson correlation coefficient, r~ 0.73. 

Method 

This study made an effort to determine the major factors 
associated with variations in school attendance of faim boys 16-1? years 
of age. The study is on variations among the 86 counties, not within a

county . 

Nine selected factors were used in the analysis. 

1. School attendance of farm boys 16-17 years in 19k0. This 
was the dependent variable; 

2. Cultural characteristics as indicated by the culture index 
which included nationality background, religious background, and 
intensity of enrolment in elementary parochial schools; 

3. Labor requirements per farm which is an indirect measure 
of actual income as well as of potential income or ability to pay; 

U. Value of farm products per farm; 

5. Availability of school bus transportation; 

6. Value of land and improvements per acre. This is a reliable 
index of agricultural wealth; 

7. Enrolment in high schools having less than 100 pupils; 

8. Percentage of total farm males enrolled in vocation 
agriculture in the high schools; 

9. Cost of public transportation per pupil. 

The eight independent variables were correlated with attendance of 
farm boys. 

Findings 

1. At the .05 level of significance, the following factors were 
significant, with the numbers referring to factors listed above: 

2. Approximately 18 per cent of variability in school 
attendance can be accounted for by this factor.

3. About 25 per cent of the variability is accounted for by 
this factor. 

h . About 10 per cent. 

5. About 10 per cent. 

When these four factors are grouped, they act as a cluster in 
relation to school attendance with r - Jjl. 

It would appear that in areas of high labor requirements on farms 
in Minnesota, the necessity for getting farm work done outweighs the 
necessity for attending school under present education conditions in 
the state. 

Evaluation 

The above findings on the county level indicate places where 
community studies would be of great value. 

The four factors found to be significant are factors of association 
rather than causes. 

Cultural background is reflected in attitudes toward the kind of 
education farm people in Minnesota are being offered. 

The four significant factors alone do not account for low 
attendance. In one-quarter of the counties these factors were not 
operative; there must be others.

community as the basis of study. An attempt is made to obtain certain 
facts about and attitudes toward education as they are indicated by 
parents, out-of-school youth, and boys and girls in school. 

Twenty-six communities are included in this analysis. They 
were selected to be representative of: 

(1) the whole State (geographically), 

(2) ’’type-of-f arming" areas, 

(3) predominantly agricultural populations. 

The analysis is based upon data obtained from 763 16-17 year old 
farm boys and girls in school, and 1*26 parents of students. The high 
lights are presented by geographical regions, into which communities 
were grouped. Type of farming areas correspond closely to geographical 
regions. 

Method 

Data were collected from students in school, from parents by 
means of questionnaires, and from students out of school by actual 
interview. 

Findings 

!• The variation among counties in school attendance of Minnesota 
farm boys and girls indicates serious inequality in educational 
attainment. The 19^0 United States Census revealed that Minnesota 
ranked forty-seventh in school attendance for 16-17 year old native- 
white farm boys. It showed, too, that in 27 of the 87 counties, 
less than UO per cent of the 16 and 17 year old farm boys were

attending school in 19^0. The data for 1950 indicate considerable 
improvement, but variation over the state is still vexy great. 

2. The analysis by counties indicated that four significant factors 
were related to school attendance. They were cultural background, 
labor requirements per farm, value of farm products per farm, and 
availability of school bus transportation. These accounted for nearly 
62 percent of the variance in rates of attendance of farm boys. The 
nonlinear correlation coefficient between attendance and these four 
factors acting as a unit was 0.79. 

3. The data indicated that even though the southern part of 
the state had the highest average educational level for the parents, 
it tended to be an area of low attendance for farm youth. Conversely, 
the northeast part had the lowest average years of schooling for the 
parents but was an area with a high rate of school attendance for farm 
youth• ' 

U. Many of the students who were in school indicated that they 
planned to obtain additional schooling. Nearly 75 per cent of the 
farm youth would have liked to have had short courses and additional 
educational opportunities in their community schools One-half of the 
boys chose farming as their favorite occupation, but two-thirds of them 
expected to be farmers. The study indicated farm girls will continue 
to leave farm areas, possibly at an accelerated rate. Thirty-five per 
cent of them indicated that they expected to get into clerical work, 
about 23 per cent into professional, and 17 per cent into teaching.

Twelve per cent expected to be housewives. 

5. Nearly one-half the boys disliked English most as a school 
subject; history was disliked most by one-third. It is possible that 
these disliked courses were factors discouraging students from completing 
high school. 

6. Within the four communities, six factors were associated 
with the educational attainment of out-of-school youth. They are: 
education of male head, age of child, residence in or out of the 
community, occupation of males, marital status of parents and language 
used in the home. The question was raised whether this significance 
is due to the six factors used or Aether it is due to community 
influences. 

7. When the analysis is done within each community, many of 
the factors are no longer significant. Apparently an important 
variable is the community itself. Within community, age of the out- 
of-school individual was the only factor significant throughout. Those 
who left school several years previous to the study were more closely 
associated with old-country culture, tfiich in turn negatively influences 
educational attainment. Language used in the home was significant in 
three communities$ this factor also indicates the degree of association 
with the old-country culture. Attitude of the parents toward the 
amount of education considered necessary was also significantly related 
to education of the children in three of the four communities. A 
favorable parental attitude is normally associated with a relatively

high educational attainment. In the t wo German communities where 
number of milk cows and acres in the farm are indicators of labor 
requirements and economic status, only the German-Catholic revealed an 
association with high educational attainment. This is a reminder that 
factors which are related at the county level for a combination of 
communities might be unrelated to educational attainment in an individual 
community. 

8. Certain selected factors were related to attitudes toward 
education expressed by the parents. When the factor of community is 
also a variable, language used in the home, education of the out-of - 
school group, age of male head, and education of male head show up as 
significantly associated with attitude toward education. Size of farm 
shows up only in a comparison of two communities. 

9* When the factor of community is controlled, the most important 
surviving factor is language used in the home. Use of foreign language 
is an indication of the old-country culture and the persistence of a 
strong agrarian tradition. 

10. Certain basic factors apparently operate to decide how 
much education farm boys and girls will receive. Two of them seem to 
persist in this analysis. They are the occupation of the parent and 
the closeness to old country culture. 

11. In the four communities, in most cases the educational 
attainment levels were higher in the village, regardless of age or 
sex. Nearly twice as many farm boys as compared with village boys

failed to go beyond the eighth grade. Nearly 25 per cent of the 
village boys had some post-high school education in contrast with only 
four per cent of the farm boys. The data suggest the following 
conclusions. Older people who live on a farm and are closely associated 
with the old-country culture, whose farms have high labor-requirements 
and who are relatively secure financially, seem to be negatively disposed 
toward more than a grade school education. There is some indication 
that farm people do not think education will help them achieve their 
objectives as farmers. 

Evaluation 

Although nationality is important in explaining variations between 
educational attainment and school attendance, other factors obviously 
operate at community levels. An examination of size of family, 
relationships with the teachers and the schools, the degree to which 
the schools serve fam people, and other factors should throw further 
light on why individuals do or do not complete high school. Probably 
the most important single differentiating factor between the educational 
pattern of farm people and those of town and city people is occupational 
"opportunity". This apparently is true regardless of the cultural 
background of the people involved. 

It would appear that the community is the ideal background against 
which to study the problem of school retention. An invaluable aspect 
of a study of this nature would be an appraisal of the community itself 
in terms of class structure based on such factors as socio-economic

status, occupation of father, family background, religion, nationality 
and income. 

The findings are probably valid enough for the communities in 
the sample, in terms of the method employed. Since a set of criteria 
was used as a basis of selection of these communities, some generalization 
may be possible to other agricultural communities which meet the same 
criteria. Beyond this, no generalization is possible, 

A factor study such as this offers much useful information which 
can be used to develop insights into the problem of school retention. 



VI. EDUCATION OF FARM BOY; 

MINNESOTA 


Background 


A different approach to the problem of the low percentage of 
rural farm youth in high school was made by Ekstrom of the Division of 
Agricultural Education, University of Minnesota. He studied two 
counties, Sibley and Morrison which, in 19li0, had the lowest percentage 
of farm youth in the 16-17 year old group attending school. 

This sample was 208 boys and girls who had graduated from the 
eighth grade between 19^1 and 19hU and had not entered high school 
or had dropped out of high school. Of this sample, 69 per cent in one 
county and 58 percent in the other county had entered a secondary 
school and subsequently dropped out. 


8. Ekstrom, G.F., "Education of Farm Boys and Girls in Minnesota". 
The Visitoy 19U6, p.l. 









Method 


Ekstrom secured his information by questionnaires sent to these 
former students. 

Findings 

1. Those who did not go beyond eighth grade were likely to 
be members of large families, were likely to follow the pattern of 
education set by older siblings and were more likely to be boys than 
girls. Those who started high school and then dropped out did so 
chiefly because they were needed at home, they did not care for school, 
and transportation was not accessible. Of the boys and girls of one 
county who dropped out of high school, a majority left school in the 
ninth grade, but they were not failing in school subjects. The chief 
reasons they gave for dropping out were lack of interest and lack of 
encouragement by parents. More than half the drop-outs were not adjusted 
socially and had not participated to any degree in extra-curricular 
activities. 

2. Failures in English were most frequent for boys, in 
mathematics for girls. 

3* Ekstrom himself concludes that the principal reasons why 
more farm boys and girls do not go to high school ares 

(a) lack of encouragement on the part of parents and other 
adults in the community, 

(b) inaccessibility to high school because of distance 


or lack of transportation

(c) lack of school prestige, 

(d) lack of an orientation program in the elementary school. 

He believes these factors are more important than academic 

ability. 

Evaluation 

The -whole area where Ekstrom made the study was one of relatively 
great sparsity of habitation. Presumably such factors as inadequate 
school facilities, long distances from school, lack of transportation, 
and a curriculum unsuited to the needs of rural youth would mitigate 
against the development of positive attitudes toward education on the 
part of both parents and students. 

It is doubtful that the findings of a questionnaire from a group 
can be regarded as valid when the majority dropped out as early as 
grade eight and nine. The findings are nevertheless pertinent to an 
understanding of the problem of school retention in the sample 
communities.

VII. THE EDUCATIONAL PLANS OF MINNESOTA YOUTH 

Background 

The determination of some of the factors associated with 
anticipated education was the subject of a study carried on in 19U6 
by Breier and Kreitlow in nineteen graded and high schools in Carlton, 
LeSeur, Nobles, and Norman counties in Minnesota.

Method 


Data were collected by means of a questionnaire. Formulated by 
the authors, this questionnaire was based on a study of factors which 
were considered to have a bearing on future educational plans of youth* 
Responses required either the statement of facts likely to be known by 
the pupils or answers requiring a minimum of judgment on their part. 

Findings 

1. It appears that grade pupils from rented farms were more 
likely to terminate their education with grade eight than were children 
from town or from owned farms. Beyond this grade, future education did 
not seem to be related to tenure. 

2. Pupils from farms anticipated less education than pupils from 
town in all four counties. 

3. Differences in anticipated education among the four communities 
were negligible when proportionate numbers of rural farm and rural pupils 
were considered. 

U. The amount of education anticipated beyond high school 
tended to vary inversely with the size of farm in the 80-320 acre 
category; children from farms under 80 and over 320 acres tended to 
expect an increasing amount of education beyond high school. 

Other findings are summarized as followsi 

1. Years of anticipated education varied inversely with 
family size. 

2. The amount of education anticipated by the children varied 
directly with the education of the parents. 

3. Birthplace of parents showed little relation to education 


of the parents

U. As distance from school increased, the amount of anticipated 
education decreased, 

5. The older pupils in any grade, especially the boys, were 
the most likely to leave school before graduation. 

6. Vocational plans showed a marked effect on the amount of 
education anticipated. 

7. More farm boys than fairo girls planned to conclude their 
education in grade eight. 

8. Reasons given most frequently for leaving school were: 

(a) the cost of attending school, 

(b) the necessity of helping at home, 

(c) lack of interest in school. 

9. Rural youth who did plan to go to high school believed that 
it would train them for jobs or prepare them for further education. 

Evaluation 

This study points to a useful preventive technique which any 
school systems concerned with school retention can use, namely, the 
study of factors associated with anticipated education. "When these 
factors are known, the schools could then attempt to modify those 
related to the school to favor the pupil’s remaining in school. 

Because the four counties were selected to meet specific criteria, 
the findings are applicable to these counties only.

investigation were also used by Archer for his study because they 
had similar numbers of rural farm population but the percentage of 
16-17 year old youth attending school varied among the counties. 

All districts in which ungraded schools were operating were asked 
to participate. The requested information was furnished by 120 districts 
of a total of ll|U in the four counties. 

Grades 7 and 8 pupils were chosen for the study since they were 
about to make decisions regarding high school attendance and therefore 
could be expected to reveal real motives related to the problem of factors 
associated with anticipated education* Of the 505 pupils included in the 
sample, there were 255 girls and 250 boys. 

Method 

Archer used the same questionnaire that Dreier and Kreitlow used. 
Co-operation of county superintendents was secured and through their 
assistance contacts xvere made with the teachers of ungraded schools. 
Instructions were furnished to these teachers and they supervised the 
completion of pupil questionnaires. These were returned to the Bureau 
of Educational Research for tabulation and analysis. 

Information was first analysed in relation to the amount of 
further education anticipated by each sex, separately. The difference 
in amount of education anticipated by boys and girls v/as determined to 
be statistically significant on the basis of Chi-square tests. Sex was 
considered to be one of the major determinants of anticipated education 
and other factors were studied in relation to the sex classification. 

The various factors other than sex are discussed under the 
following general classifications? 










(a) socio-economic factors: farm-town residence, farm size, 

tenure, 

(b) home factors: size of family, education of parents, birth¬ 
place of parents, 

(c) school factors: distance from school, teacher encouragement, 
age in grade, 

(d) vocational plans: choice of occupation was considered 
in relation to other factors, 

(e) financial factors, 

(f) reasons for attending or leaving high school, 

(g) preferred school subjects. 

Findings 

1. The general findings of this study based upon anticipated 
education agree with research findings based on actual school attendance 
conducted by Lowry Nelson;*^ rural farm boys are contributing the most 
to Minnesota’s poor showing on school attendance as compared with other 
states, 

2. Although this was a study of rural ungraded schools, over 
18 per cent of the pupils reported town residence. There was a 
significant, difference between farm and town boys in the amount of 
anticipated education, but not between farm and town girls, 

3. Boys from farms over 2l|0 acres in size tended to anticipate 
more education than did boys on smaller farms. Girls from farms over 
2 I 4 O acres or under 160 acres anticipated more education than girls

from medium-sized farms, 

k. No significant differences in amount of expected school 
attendance were found between pupils from owned and rented farms, 

5. Size of family seems to be one of the factors in determining 
whether or not education is terminated in grade eight, 

6, The anticipated education of the children is very closely 
related to the education of the parents. The more education the parents 
have, the more the children anticipate, 

7, Birthplace of the parents was not found to be an important 
factor. 

8. Lack of bus facilities is an important factor in not com¬ 
pleting school, but is less a factor in this study than in previous ones. 

As age in grade goes up, a larger proportion of the pupils 
anticipate only the eighth grade, but other factors related to age in 
grade are probably more important than age itself. 

10. The choice of an occupation which requires certain standards 
has a direct bearing on the amount of education anticipated. Much 
variation exists among boys who choose farming^ about one fourth anti¬ 
cipate grade eight education, almost one-half high school, about one- 
fourth high school plus, and a negligible number anticipate college, 

11. No definite statements seem warranted as to the effect of 
lack of money on plans for future education. 

12. The chief reasons anticipated for not completing high school 

(a) necessity for working at home - first for both sexes.

(b) transportation difficulties - second for girls and third 

for boys, 

(c) choice of an occupation for which the pupils consider 
further occupation unnecessary - second for boys and seventh for girls, 

13. Responses indicate that preparation for a job is considered 
as the most important reason for going on to school. Preparation for 
citizenship is ranked second by girls, third by boys, 

liw There was no clear-cut differentiation between the various 
levels of anticipated education as to which high school subjects pupils 
wished to take. Mathematics ranked first among favored subjects for 
both boys and girls with other choices differing in rank between sexes 
and between expected levels of education. 

15, This study shows that some of the important factors related 
to the amount of anticipated education are sex, place of residence, 
i.e., farm or town, size of farm, size of family, education of parents, 
availability of transportation, choice of occupation, and necessity of 
working at home. 

Evaluation 

The findings of this study refer only to the four counties included 
in this sample. These counties were selected because they met certain 
criteria and cannot be considered as representative of the state of 
Minnesota as a whole. It follows that the findings cannot be generalized 
to apply to the entire state. 

This and other Minnesota studies relied heavily on the question¬ 
naire method of research. 'While this method has its limitations it has 
the advantage of offering an inexpensive means of securing information 






65 


from a large population. Such information indicates trends which are 
often suggestive of areas in which more refined research would be valuable* 

IX. ¥1-11 MINNESOTA PUPILS DROP OUT 

OF SCHOOL 12 

Background 

The twenty-four school districts in the study represent the various 
types and sizes of schools in operation in Minnesota. The districts 
reported the number of pupils enrolled in the fifth grade in 19U0 who 
dropped out of each grade before completing high school in 19h7* 

During that period 1,127 students dropped out from grades 6-12® 

The report was prepared by T* J. Berning, Grace Dougherty, and 
A. L. Gallop. 

Method 

In this survey the school administrators, presumably the 
principals, supplied the investigators with the necessary data. The 
latter analysed the information and found 23 factors associated with 
dropping out of school from grades 6-12. These factors were listed as 
primary or secondary, depending on their frequency of mention. 

Findings 

1. Of the 1,127 boys and girls who left school before graduation, 

7k did so in grade six, 107 in grade seven, 137 in grade eight, 270 in 
grade nine, 29lj in grade ten, 211 in grade eleven, and 3k in grade 
twelve. 

2. The leading factors which appear to be associated with early

school leaving as found in this study appear to be:

required to work around home or farm, 

lack of interest of parents, 

economic necessity, 

taking paying job, 

not liking school,

Evaluation 

There is a high probability of error involved when school 
administrators have to state reasons why pupils leave school. They 
give the best answers they can but these are, in most cases, statements 
of what appears at the surface. 

The study is weakened through its inclusion of new pupils and 


transfers in its sample

CHAPTER VII 


ELMTOWN'S YOUTH 1 
Background 

Hollinshead describes the relationships existing 
between the behavior patterns of 735 adolescent boys 
and girls and the positions occupied by their families 
in the community^ class system. The major areas of 
social behavior covered are the school, the job, the 
church, recreation, cliques, dates and sex* 

Part IV of this investigation is an examination of 
a few interrelations between class system and the activities 
of 345 young people (47 per cent of the study group) who 
had left school. Of these early school leavers, 74 P er 
cent withdrew in the spring of 1942 , before the legal 
school leaving age of sixteen. 

The complete sample represented 535 different 
families. It Included all youth enrolled in Elmtown 
High School in I94l~42 together with those who had been 
graduated, or should have been gradiiated, from an elementary 
school between 1938 and 194 ^ and who resided in the 
community in 1941 - 4 2 but who were not in school.

Method 

There were available to Dr. Hollinshead three main 
sources of information: 

Statistics. These represent a comprehensive picture 
of a specific phase of behavior for the whole group. 

Elmtowners 1 own stories. 

Participant observation, schedules, interviews, 
official records, tests, autobiographies, "The Elmtown 
Bugle", historical pamphlets, visits with adolescents, 
with their parents, and with other local people. 

The researcher had a choice of three methods with 
which to develop class stratification: 

Single factor index — occupations, income, education 
or area of residence. 

Composite index — such as the Chapin or Sewell scales. 

A rating scale, locally developed, which would apply 
a common measure to all families. 

Hollinshead chose the last one because of the stability 
of population, the knowledge people in Elmtown had of each 
other, and the way people referred to each other, to social 
groups, to organizations, and to institutions. This method 
uses local values to define position in a functional way. 

Fifty interviews were analyzed, and information about 
30 families was abstracted. These families had been placed 
in similar if not identical positions by different interviewees. 
More than 100 criteria were mentioned in the interviews and 
were grouped under five general headings:

Tell how representative these classes were of the 

different people in the community. 

The results: 

Seventy-nine per cent believed there were five social 
strata. 

There was a high order of agreement as to which 
families belonged in each group, with certain definite 
exceptions. 

The raters justified their judgments by the use of 
the same types of symbolic referents that appeared in the 
interviews. 

A control list, representative of the five classes

composite coefficient was r = 0.88, high enough to indicate 
that the control list was diagnostic of the 5 major classes, 
and high enough to insure reliability of the rating procedure. 
A further test showed that the raters were able to equate 
the families in the study with those in the control group. 

CULTURAL CHARACTERISTICS 

The following outlines describe the cultural character¬ 
istics which distinguish the five social classes in this 
study. 

Class One 

Membership in Class I is more or less stabilized 
through the gnerations through a combination of wealth 
and lineage. Once wealth is attained, its loss does not 
drop the individual from the class for at least two 
generations. Family fortunes are often recouped through 
"brilliant marriages". This class strongly emphasizes 
the inheritance of abilities and characteristics; "good 
blood" is a doctrine. 

Class marriages are encouraged, divorce is discouraged, 
children are well looked after, with rarely more than two 
in a family. Accumulated wealth provides this group with 
the highest income in the community so that in Elmtown 
this group, comprising 2$ of the population, owned both 
banks, the large industries, nearly all the business

buildings in town, and extensive farm land. In order 
to keep assessments and tax rates low, members of this 
class successfully exert much political influence. 

Leisure is the main interest. While various types of 
help look after their affairs, these people emphasize club 
life and travel, associating exclusively with other class I 
persons who belong to the same clique. Education is not 
highly regarded. All belong to a church, contribute freely, 
but attend infrequently. 

Ritual in the social code is based for the ladies on 
clothes, stationery, good-breeding and self-assurance. 
Violation of the social code is the greatest possible sin 
for this class. High personal morals are present particularly 
among older men and women, but the middle-aged drink and 
gamble. Some may not observe the laws too carefully but no 
arrests are made. The prestige a family has determines 
largely the manner in which an act is interpreted by law 
enforcement agencies. 

Glass II 

About half of this group attained its position through 
its own efforts while the remainder Inherited it, but the 
climb to class I is impossible. Instead, members of class 
II attempt to identify themselves with members of class I. 

The prestige of class II appears to depend on civic 
leadership as much as it does upon economic success. Its

members do much work in community affairs and in power- 
wielding associations. Many of these leaders are manipulated 
by Class I members. 

About four out of five families trace their ancestry 
to pioneer "American" stock. Half of the families live in 
the "best residential" section and ninety per cent own their 
own homes. The family income is earned largely by the man 
through professional work like law, medicine, engineering, 
and dentistry; through the operation of a family-owned 
business; as a salaried executive, or as a salaried pro¬ 
fessional in public office. To relax from work, cliques 
meet at home-parties on the week-ends. 

Because education is very highly regarded, class II 
is the most educated group in Elmtowh. The rearing of the 
children (mean number per family is 2.3) is the joint 
responsibility of the parents. Almost all the families 
belong to a church and about half attend, particularly the 
women. 

Since families in this group have neither time nor 
money to travel extensively, short holiday trips are common. 
At home, 85% belong to the Country Club. 

The position of Class II is based on dignified 
occupations, income, higher education, leadership, and 
social activity.

Class III 


This pivotal group looks down on Class IV as the 
"common man" and resents class II because of its condescending 
attitude. 

Family income is earned mostly by the male head but 
it is not a disgrace for the woman to work. Incomes range 
from $3,000 to $4,000 with the mode at $3,800 to $3,899. 

Forty-two of the 139 families in this group own businesses, 
farms, or are independent professionals. One-sixth of the 
mothers are gainfully employed, one-quarter of these after 
the husband 1 s death, largely as school teachers, nurses, 
music teachers, stenographers, bookkeepers, secretaries, 
seamstresses, and beauticians. The family income is spent 
largely on consumer goods and on a two-week vacation. 

Twenty-five per cent of the families live in the 
best residential area, 53$ in the second best. Two-thirds 
own their own homes. 

About two-thirds of the families trace their ancestry 
to European rather than to "American" stock. Ethnic 
background and religious affiliation are connected directly. 
Church guilds, study groups, missionary societies, and 
welfare organizations are kept alive largely by class III 


women

Class III mothers marry about a year sooner than do 
those of class II, have children sooner, and have more of 
them, with a median of 3•6, Both parents rear the children. 
Class III is not so well educated as the higher classes, 
with the women having significantly more education than the 
men. Leisure is used in some type of organized group activity 
usually segregated on the basis of sex and age. Evening 
parties are Saturday night clique affairs. All affairs of 
any type, are listed in the town’s newspaper. To enhance 
their prestige, members of class III seek personal publicity 
whether it be social, economic, political, religious or 
educational. 

Class IV 

Families in this class resent the attitude of those 
above them but take pride in the fact that they are not 
as badly off as those below them. Class IV members are 
wage earners with family income ranging from $800 to $2,700. 
Thirty per cent of the mothers work to supplement the income. 

Twenty-five per cent of the families do not own a 
car and over 35 per cent either own or are buying a home. 

Home ownership is concentrated in certain occupational 
groups other than the laboring. Class IV farmers are, in 
nearly all cases, tenants. 

Cash reserves are low; 35 per cent have small commercial 
bank accounts, and 17 per cent have savings accounts. For 
the rest, the small loans broker acts as the credit agent

and does a profitable business. During the early and middle 
1930*3, many families were on federal and state relief. 

All ethnic groups are found in about the same proportion 
in which they are found in the general population. 

Family stability is low so that one-third of the 
families are broken by separation, divorce, or death. 

(Glass III, 18$). Members marry earlier than in other 
classes with 55$ of the mothers having their first child 
before 20 years of age. (Glass III, 19$). The mean number 
per family is 4.3. The mothers* role is looking after the 
home, the fathers* to provide for it. 

Formal education rarely goes beyond the public elementary 
and high school. One-third of the fathers and a fifth of 
the mothers have not graduated from grade eight. The present 
generation is receiving more education but rarely more than 
two grades of high school. While mofet of the children 
aspire to high school education, the parents often are not 
convinced of its value, and have few if any scruples about 
letting a child quit or in fact taking him out to work. 

Gategorization of religion in this class is difficult 
because denominational, ethnic, and role factors are operative. 
In general, religion is either shunned or embraced with 
enthusiasm. This group is not nearly as active in the churches 
as are those of higher classes. 

Civic and community organizations are pretty well 
taboo to class IV, but the local labor organizations are

run almost exclusively by class IV men. Nearly all leisure 
time is spent within the community either at home or in 
activities offered to the public. There is little travel 
to lakes or resorts, and associations in cliques are limited 
to intra-class relationships, and these are informal, like 
evening "drop-in" visits. 

This class is taken for granted, and its members are 
largely ignored except in so far as they perform economic 
and political functions. 

Class V 

In general, class V Is regigned to a life of frustration 
and defeat in a community that despises them for their 
disregard of morals, lack of "success" goals, and dire 
poverty. 

Ninety-two per cent are unskilled and semi-skilled 
laborers or machine operators. Not one is a farm owner, 
and only 8 are farm tenants; 2 are notions salesmen; 8 
operate very small businesses. Fifty-five per cent of the 
mothers work. Annual family income is from #500 to a high 
of #1500. Many receive township relief. Semi-public and 
private help is often accorded this group. Bank credit 
is non-existent. 

""embers of this class are very irregular in their 
employment, often leaving jobs very casually. The work 
history of the parents is known to the employers and

therefore affects employment opportunities of the children. 

All population elements are represented but 58 per 
cent trace their ancestry to "American" stock that came to 
Elmtown before the Civil War. 

These families are excluded from the two leading 
residential areas and are concentrated largely north of 
the tracks and below the canal. The homes are dilapidated, 
box-like affairs with crude, second-hand furniture. 

Privacy is almost non-existent. The house is rented in 
four cases out of five. 

Husband-wife relations are unstable so that disagreements 
often lead to quarrels, vicious fights, desertions, and often 
divorce. Marriages are early, and one-fifth to one-quarter 
of the births are illegitimate. The mean number of children 
per family is 5.6, the range 1 to 6, and 78% of the mothers 
gave birth to the first child before age twenty. 

Formal education is limited largely to the elementary 
school. Of the sample of 8,230 in this class, only one 
father and four mothers graduated from high school, 7 fathers 
and 6 mothers completed a year or more of high school, 

67% quit before the eighth grade was reached, and the 
remainder completed grade eight. 

Religious ties are either very strong or non-existent. 
Only 71 per cent claim any religious connections. Nine out 
of ten families have no active connections with a church 
and in fact are hostile toward church, ministers, and pi&us

people. They feel they are not wanted by the congregations 
and some of the ministers, and in fact, they are not. 

Ninety-five per cent of the fathers are completely unknown 
to the ministers. 

Their leisure time is spent in the community or in 
nearby ones. They are almost completely isolated from 
organized community activities. The family is so loosely 
organized that each member usually seeks his own amusement. 

This group, occupying the lowest-ranking in the prestige 
structure, are much better known to the police, sheriff, 
prosecuting attorney, and judge than they are to the 
ministers and school officials. Between 1954 and 1941, 

8 per cent of the mothers and 46 per cent of the fathers 
had been convicted once or more in the local courts. 

Findings 

Place of residence — No relationship was found between 
town or country residence and tendency to drop out of 
school. 

Social class as a factor — Class position, as determined 
by the way the family lived, its income and possessions, 
and standing in the community, was found to be highly 
significant. All the people of high school age in the 
upper classes were in school. The proportion of drop-outs 
started and increased in the other classes with the largest 
proportion, 8 out of 9 pupils, dropping out in the lowest 
social class.

Hollingshead feels that these phenomena might be 
explained in two ways: 

Class and family cultures furnish the child with 
certain beliefs about the school system, and perceptions 
of what it has to offer. 

School authorities provide pupils in the several 
classes with differential attitudes toward the school system. 
Age — The withdrawal process begins in the elementary 
grades when the child becomes aware of the way he is 
regarded by peers, teachers, and the community. 

Some children in class V withdraw as early as age 12. 
Before they are 16 years of age, 64 per cent of Class IV 
and 75 per cent of Class V have dropped out of school. 

Sex — Proportionately more boys than girls dropped out 
of school. In class V, 53 per cent of drop-outs were 
boys and 47 per cent were girls. 

Grade — In class III all the boys and girls finished 
the eighth grade and 11 out of 12 of those who dropped 
out had entered high school. Members of class IV and V 
showed a tendency to drop out of school from the sixth 
grade on. 

Time of withdrawal — Most of the withdrawals occurred 
during the summer vacation period and in the first six

weeks of the school year. Seasonal work did not appear to 
have any effect. 

Achievement — The drop-outs appeared to be school failures. 
Hollingshead found that when he compared the class IV*s 
who dropped out of school with those who remained in school, 
the drop-outs had poorer scholarship, attendance, and 
deportment records. They also had lower I.Q. f s but 
Hollingshead concluded that differences in intelligence do 
not fully explain dropping out of school since there were 
no difference in I.Q,. between some of the class V drop-outs 
and those of class V who remained in school. 

Punishment — Sever© punishment for misbehavior is often 
followed by withdrawal. Members of class IV and class V 
are most affected, because their families have no influence 
with school authorities. 

Illness — Real and alleged illnesses forced the withdrawal 
of 16 adolescents. There were probably others. 

Relief — Relationship between township relief and with¬ 
drawal cannot be ignored, especially in class V where 53 
per cent of the families were on relief for at least three 
months between January 1, 1937, and June 30, 1942. 

Family — Area of residence, broken homes, rented homes, 
family income, gainful occupation of the mother are assoc¬ 
iated significantly with leaving school in class IV. 

Concludes Hollingshead:

Unfortunate family background within the 
context of the class system is undoubtedly the 
most potent factor in any explanation of the 
reasons underlying withdrawals from school in 
Elmtown, and perhaps elsewhere for that matter. 

Conclusions 

Out-of-school adolescents are products, in large 
measure of the impact of the Elmtown social system on 
them as constituent members of this system. 

Policies of the Board of Education are conditioned 
in a number of ways by class interests, particularly with 
respect to their ties with property ownership and taxation: 

Administration of the school, especially 
in the way the compulsory attendance law is 
administered. 

Sensitivity of the school officials to the 
wishes of the upper classes. 

The invidious way discipline is carried out 
in the case of children from very low ranking 
families. 

Administration policy in regard to local relief 
encourgges dropping out. 

The most powerful factor, and the most complex, is 
one f s family culture. There are intangible barriers against 
children in class V. The child’s family has been isolated 
in like manner by necessity and by choice so that his

escape from this class is well-nigh impossible. 

The struggle for the necessities of life, the search 
for pleasure to break the monotony of work, unemployment, 
insecurity, family life all too often punctuated with 
quarrels followed by fights and physical violence—these 
are usual accompaniments of living in a class V social 
structure and provide little background against which 
to continue in school. 

There appears to be a negative orientation of class 
V children toward education and a positive orientation 
toward work and pleasure. It would seem that the social 
system is such that an isolating process operates in and 
out of school. The lower class child learns that to get 
money for things he wants he must work, so he leaves 
school as soon as possible, but in doing so he further 
restricts himself to his own group. 

EVALUATION 

It would appear that Hollingshead was most zealous 
to develop and use correct research procedure. It would 
appear, too, that the study of youth in its actual social 
structure within the community might shed more insight 
into school mortality rates than many other experimental 
methods.

In this study the author has used every technique at 
a researcher’s disposal in order to obtain objective 
information. The findings of this experiment present a 
different point of view when they emphasize the relationship 
between cultural factors and early school leaving. It is 
likely that Hollingshead 1 s findings are different from those 
of other studies in this emphasis because he did not restrict 
himself to one method of obtaining data. A restricted 
means of seeking information very often structures the 
responses or obtains information in only limited areas, 
thereby precluding the possibility of reaching conclusions 
of such validity as to be generally applicable. 

In view of HollingheadS precise design, it would 
seem that he has contributed a set of findings which would 
be generally true, in respect to the impact of class 
society on the adolescent, in any community in North 
America. Such conclusions as the invidious discipline of 
class V students, the influence of the upper classes on 
education, and the attitude of teachers to members of the 
lower classes are most worthy of further investigation. 

In the meantime, these problems pose grave and searching 
questions which school authorities can no longer answer 
by saying: r, It is not so."

CHAPTER VIII 


CENSUS STUDIES 

Census reports are of great significance to the under- 
standing of early school leaving. They indicate trends which 
provide insights and suggest courses of action. 

I. YOUTH FIGURED OUT 1 
Background 

The data in this report, Youth Figured Out, on the young 
people in Canada between the ages of 15 and 24 were derived from the 
Dominion Census and other authoritative sources of statistical 
information. The author of this study is Dr. John E. Robbins, Chief 
of the Education Branch of the Dominion Bureau of Statistics. 

Method 

The author presents census tables with detailed explanations 
and statements of implications to education. 

Findings 

Approximately 51 percent of children of ages 10-14 years 
live in rural communities. In the 15 to 19 year group, fewer than 
48 percent are in this category; in the 20-24 year group, fewer 
than 43 percent, and at ages 25-29 only 41 percent. It would seem 
that about one out of every five young people from the country has 
migrated to towns and cities in recent years. This trend is more 
pronounced among the girls than among the boys.

Interprovincial migration - There is much interprovincial 
migration with Ontario and British Columbia attracting the greatest 
numbers. These two provinces have 44 percent of the Dominions 
adult population and only 35 percent of the children* From estimates 
of national income during the 1930*s compiled by the Dominion Bureau 
of Statistics, it appears that approximately half of it was received 
by the residents of those two provinces, indicating that they offered 
a substantial margin in economic opportunity. So long as nearly two- 
thirds of the country's children are located where half of the national 
income is earned, and onlyabout one-third of them where the other half 
is earned, a continuing migration during the years of youth seems 
assured. 

The relation of frequent moving to early school leaving is 
of enough significance to make this interprovincial migration a matter 
of concern to educators. 

School Enrolment - 

(a) About 35 percent of the younger half of the youth group 
are still in school, less than 4 percent of the older half. These 
percentages are not uniform in different parts of the country. 

(b) There is a wide disparity in the attendance of rural boys 
and girls, 24.7 percent of such boys as compared with 8.3 percent of 
rural girls. 

(c) There is a wider disparity in attendance of rural and 
urban boys, 24.7 percent of rural as compared with 42.8 percent for 
urban boys. 

(d) Differences are wide between the provinces. In spite of 
its being one of the most rural and least wealthy provinces.

Saskatchewan has a higher proportion of its youth in school than 
any of the more easterly provinces. Alberta and British Columbia 
stand at the top in this respect, presumably as an outcome of 
educational reforms in recent years in curriculum and administration. 

Length of Schooling. 

(a) For Canada as a whole, in 1941> the average duration of 
school enrolment per child was exactly 10 years. The corresponding 
figure for 1931 was 9.39 years of enrolment, for 1921 it was 9.13 
years, and for 1911 only 7*96 years. 

(b) There are very considerable differences between provinces 
in the number of years their children attend school. 

(c) In terms of ages of school leaving, the record of attendance 
above the age of 15 indicates that in Canada on the average, young 
people discontinue school at almost exactly 17 years of age (15 plus 
1.95)• The range between provinces is 16 years 5 months in Quebec, to 
17 years and 8 months in British Columbia. 

(d) School and university records in recent years show that 
between 20 and 25 percent of young persons have been attaining the 
level of high school leaving or junior matriculation. About 3 percent 
have been continuing their formal education long enough to graduate from 
a university. Of these, more than 4 percent are boys and less than 2 
percent are girls.

Evaluation 

Robbins presented a brief statistical picture of Canada’s youth 
against which other reports in this chapter many well be studied. His 
data too, show trends over a period of more than twenty years. Because 
his report is suggestive rather than definitive, certain areas of his 
study could be examined more searchingly, and consequently more definite 
findings recorded*

II. STUDENT RETENTION IN CANADIAN HIGH SCH00IS 2 
Background 

Dr. M. E. Lazerte, director of the School Finance Committee 
of the Canadian School Trustees Association, conducted this study- 

in 1953. 

Method 

The investigator explains census figures in order to present 
a clearer picture of school retention in the high schools ofCanada. 

Findings 

How Many Grade I Children Reach High School Grades? 

The following analysis of enrolment data shows current atten¬ 
dance trends in Canada. 

Figures for Catholic Quebec are not given for grades above the 
seventh because a large percentage of children in grade VIII and above 
are enrolled in schools emphasizing practical rather than academic 
subjects* 

There is a marked drop in enrolment in Newfoundland in grade . 
II. Few proceed through junior or senior high school grades* 

In New Brunswick promotions and progress are quite normal 
during compulsory attendance years but enrolments decrease rapidly 
thereafter. 

Retention is best in the high schools of British Columbia, 
Alberta and Saskatchewan. 

After grade VII, many pupils withdraw from school for economic 
reasons, because they reach the upper compulsory age limit or because 
they are so out-of-step with the school program that school work is no 
longer interesting*

1951 Census Data Regarding Attendance. 

1* Fewer rural than urban children are continuing their 
education through high school grades. Census data^ show that in the 
ten provinces, 57 percent of urban children and 63 percent of rural 
children 15 to 19 years of age inclusive, are not attending school. 
The urban youth referred to have completed 5.2 years of schooling 
and the rural youth about 4*6 years. 

2. The data show that there were in Canada in 1951 more than 
630,000 young people of approximately high school age who were not 
attending either high or elementary grades. Again non-attendance was 
higher for rural than for urban children. 

3. Of the 1,057,972 Canadian children 15-19 years of ag®, 
630,290 were not enrolled in schools, public or private. 

4° It is worthwhile to compare provincial and dominion en¬ 
rolment figures^, as compiled by the Canadian Education Association.

Holding Power of the High School: Progress and Problems 

Lazerte points out that retention of grade VII students in 
grades VIII, IX, X, and XI increased 0.7 percent in the five-year 
period from 1946-1947* but that enrolments^ are increasing only be¬ 
cause the population is increasing. The high schools are not holding 
an appreciably larger percentage of grade VII students than they did 
in 1946-47. 

In the U.S., the enrolment^ in grades VIII to XI in 1949-50 
was 6,293,^97, or 83.9 percent of the grade VII enrolments of 1945-46 
to 1948-1949 inclusive. In Canada the corresponding percentage was 
59.6. If grade II instead of Grade VII be the base of reference, the 
1949-50 high school retention for the U.S. becomes 70.13 while the 
Canadian percentage drops to 44*5. 

Calling attention to the acute shortage of personnel in pro¬ 
fessions, ^azerte points out that if the high schools were educating 
90 percent instead of 44.5 percent of the children in the elementary 
school, the problem might be solved. To do this, some positive means 
of meeting the problem of retardation inevitably associated with mass 
education, is imperative. 

Evaluation 

Census figures carry a high degree of reliability. Dr. Lazerte*s 
discussion of them is a valuable contribution to an understanding of 
the problem of school attendance.

III. PROGRESS OF 194^ GENERATION 
Background 

No substantial study in the field of early school leaving 
has yet been carried out by the Sydney, Australia, Department of 
Education, but some work in the field is now being projected. The 
following report?, however, does provide useful information for the 
purpose of this study. 

Method 

Attendance records of a first year high school class are 
listed through to graduation. 

Findings 
TAB IE XIII 

(see next page) 

Evaluation 

Apart from indicating general trends in high school attendance 
in Sydney, and showing, too, the tremendous loss of pupils before 
graduation, this report outlines the organization of secondary schools 
in that province.

PROGRESS OF 194-8 GENERATION THROUGH SECONDARY SCHOOIS

IV FEWER DROP-OUTS INDICATE BETTER HOLDING POWER 8 
Background 

The Department of Public Instruction of North Carolina conducted 
an investigation in 1951* 

Method 

The writers interpret enrolment, membership, and drop-outs for 
1949-50, as set down by Department Statistical Tables. 

Findings 

The highest number and percentage of drop-outs for white pupils 
was for the year 1933-1934• This was followed by a downward trend to 
1942-1943 and 1943-1944 when some disturbance, presumably the war, 
caused a slight increase. Following 1943-1944 the trend has been 
downward. 

There was no trend for Negro pupils until 1935-36 from which time 
a decline in drop-outs is in evidence till 1941# A slight increase in 
1942 was followed by another downward trend to 1946-47, when another 
increase occurs. Since that year the trend is definitely downward to 
1949-50, when only 4.9 percent of the Negro enrolment were drop-outs. 

The percentage of drop-outs is greater in the high school than 
in the elementary grades. In the case of white pupils, only four percent 
dropped out during the year in the first eight grades, whereas in high 
schools, 8.3 percent dropped out. In Negro elementary schools, the 
drop-out percentage was 4.1, whereas in high schools there was a 9.2 
percent drop-out.

On a grade by grade compa&son, the greatest number of drop-outs 
was for grade nine. The records indicate that this grade was the most 
difficult to pass for both white and negro pupils. Drop-outs totalled 
4,447 or 9.& percent in this grade in the case of white children; and 
1,663, or 10.2 percent, in the case of negroes. 

Evaluation 

It appears that the schools of North Carolina retain 95 percent 
of their students to high school graduation. This is a remarkable 
record, a record toward which all schools might work and aspire. 

V. 44,000 BOYS AND GIRLS DROP OUT 9 

Background 

This is a second report of the North Carolina State Department 
of Education. 

Method 

Department officials examine enrolment and attendance records 
and state implications. 

Findings 

In 1949-50, state figures showed that 5 out of every 100 
children enrolled dropped out before the end of school. The total 
for the state for this year was 43,991 boys and girls. 

Of each 100 pupils in average daily attendance each school day, 
7 were absent. The total absent each day for the state in 1949-50 
was 60,490.

The drop-out rate varies from county to county from a low of 
4*0 to a high of 11.6 percent. 

Experience has shown that in most of the 62 units in the state 
which employ attendance officers, the drop-out rates were lower. Ex¬ 
ceptions indicate the need for some correlating and standardizing 
agency on the state level. 

Evaluation 

In comparison with other states, both the drop-out and the 
daily absence rates are unusually low in North Carolina. It is 
most commendable that the State Department feels that 5 out of 100 
drop-outs per year and 7 of 100 absences per day are too many, and 
that steps must be taken to improve this situation. 

VI PUBLIC SCHOOLS OF SOUTH CAROLINA 10 
Background 

In 1946, the Division of Survey and Field Services of the 
George Peabody College for Teachers conducted an education survey 
in South Carolina. 

Method 

With the assistance of out-of-state educational consultants, 
a large group of South Carolina laymen and professional educators 
made the survey. The work was done by eleven committees of from eight 
to twenty members each. Each committee was assisted by at least one 
consultant from the State Department of Education and one out-of-state 
consultant.

Findings 


School Enrolment Figures 

Out of 116,382 boys and girls in grade I in 1936, only 
15,666 or one-seventh, were enrolled in grade XI in 1947* Only 1 
out of 30 negro boys enrolled in grade I graduated from high school, 

1 out of 14 negro girls, 1 out of 4 white boys, and 1 out 3 white 
girls. On the average, only 2 out of 15 grade one pupils graduate 
from high school. The national figure is 4 out of 15. 

The proportion of white students enrolled in the final year 
of high school in 1946 was 413 per 1000 of the original fourth-grade 
class of 1939* In schools for negroes, the ratio was 121 per 1000. 

The present survival rate index in South Carolina is 320 per 1000. 

Causes of Non-Attendance 
legitimate; 

illness of pupil 
distance and inclement weather 
lack of transportation 
sickness and financial difficulties 
not legitimate; 

parental indifference or neglect 
maladjustment and lack of interest of pupils 
lack of flexibility in school program 
lack of sympathetic understanding of pupils by 
teachers 

uninspiring teachers 

Teachers were criticized for not doing more home visiting and 
for not showing a sincere interest in the individual pupil in other 
ways. However, teachers in many schools have almost an impossible job

because of heavy teaching loads* 

Evaluation 

Indifferent daily attendance is significantly related to dropping 
out of school. Both attendance and retention rates in South Carolina 
are very low* 

This study would indicate that the combined efforts of the entire 
staff and the community are required to increase the daily attendance 
from its present 81*9 percent of the total enrolment, and to increase 
the number who stay in school until graduation. 

VII PUBLIC EDUCATION IN NEW MEXICO 11 
Background 

This is a report of the New Mexico Educational Survey Board 
which deals with all aspects of New Mexico's public education* 

Method 

Once again the Division of Surveys and Field Services of 
George Peabody College for Teachers of Nashville, Tennessee, was 
hired to conduct the survey. Members of the staff visited various 
parts of the state where meetings were held and attended by lay and 
professional people. 

Findings 

Of all the pupils who enrolled in the first grade, only 11 
percent finished high school in 1943-44* Of the pupils who enrolled 
in the first grade in New Mexico in 1935> 32 percent reached the eighth 
grade eight years later, and 14 percent reached the twelfth grade in 
1947.

A ten-county study in 1948 shows that the holding power 
of the school varies from one county to another. In the lowest 
county, pupils drop out of school year after year until only 6 
percent of the pupils enrolled in the second grade graduate from 
high school. In the county with the best record, 45 percent of the 
initial enrolment of pupils finished grad© XII. 

A comparison of the enrolment during the current year in 
grade VIII and grade XII indicates the holding power of the school. 

The enrolment in grade VII in five representative counties in 1946-47 
was 1,322. The enrolment in grade VIII was 649, and 518 graduated from 
high school. These figures suggest that nearly 60 percent of the pupils 
in grade VIII will leave school before high school graduation. 

Withdrawals are much more numerous in the rural than in the 
municipal schools. An eighth grad© enrolment of 447 pupils in rural 
schools dropped to 136 in grade XIII, of whom only 88 graduated. This 
indicates that of every 5 pupils in grade VIII, only one will graduate 
from high school. An eighth grade enrolment of 928 pupils in municipal 
schools dropped to 513 in grade XII, with 430 graduating from high school. 
Of every 2 pupils enrolled in grade VIII in the municipal schools, on© 
probably will graduate from high school. 

Elementary principals gave the following reasons why pupils 
leave school before reaching grade eight: pupils are over-age; pupils 
go to work; lack of interest; and low mentality. The chief causes of 
withdrawals reported by the high school principals are: lack of interest 
on the part of the pupil or the parent; pupil finds employment; pupil 
is married; serious retardation; and lack of finances.

The survey committee states that the number of withdrawals could 
be reduced by a more interesting and useful curriculum. Fewer pupils 
would withdraw if the language difficulties of the Spanish speaking 
students were removed. In New Mexico, 10 percent of the pupils are 
Indian, and the remainder divided evenly between Spanish and English. 

In some counties an intensive campaign would be necessary to 
change the attitude of the parents toward the education of their chil¬ 
dren. The citizens should be induced to recognize the social and economic 
advantages of a good education. The teachers should visit the homes of 
their pupils, particularly those who are irregular in their attendance. 

The employment of visiting teachers in some counties would increase 
attendance, reduce the number of withdrawals, and establish better re¬ 
lations between home and school. 

Evaluation 

The survey is well organized and presented. Withdrawal trends 
in New Mexico are indicated and their implications outlined. The 
reasons for withdrawal as listed by the principals may not be true 
reasons in precise terms of cause and effect. They are obviously 
subjective. The study does reveal the circumstances under which early 
withdrawals occur in the school systems of New Mexico. 

VIII EXTENT AND CAUSES OF NON-ENROLMENT 12 
Background 

During the school year 1946-47, a study was made by the Division 
of Census and attendance of the Kentucky State Department of Education 
for the purpose of determining the extent and causes of non-enrolment 
of all children of ages 6 to 17 inclusive.

Method 

This is primarily a census report with some attempt to examine 
the causes of both non-attendance and non-enrolment, on a state-wide 
basis* 

Findings 

School Enrolment* 

According to official census reports submitted as of April 1, 

1947, by state school districts, there were 683,806 children of ages 
6 to 17* A study of the reports indicates that as of this date, 580,567 
or 84*90 percent of all census children were enrolled in some type of 
school. Public school enrolment accounted for 535,293 or 78.28 percent, 
private and parochial school enrolments accounted for 40,898 or 5*98 
percent and otter type schools, such as colleges, training schools, and 
enrolments in other states, accounted for 4*376 or O.64 percent. 

Extent of Non-Enrolment 

As of April 1, 1947, a total of 103,239 or 15*10 percent of the 
census children were not enrolled in any school. It is significant to 
note that the six, sixteen and seventeen year group accounted for 75 
percent of all non-enrolls . These age groups are not subject to the 
compulsory attendance laws. 

Those not enrolled in any school have been grouped under three 
categories: 

(l) The number outside the compulsory school age. The records 
show that in this group 77,480 were not enrolled. Of this number, 

31,350 were 6 years old, 19,697 were 16 years old, and 26,433 were 17 
years old* 

The total number of six year old children in the State of Kentucky 
on April 1, 1947 was 59,180, of sixteen year old, 55,114, and of 17 year

old youth, 56,052. It is significant to note then that the drawing 
power of the schools is less than 50 percent effective with the six 
year olds, and that for the 16 and 17 year olds it is less than 60 
percent effective. 

(2) Of those within compulsory school age, only 89 enrolled in 
any completed high school. It is interesting to note that 842 chil¬ 
dren under 16 years old were married and did not enroll in school. 

Only 510 of the 7,206 in this group had been granted work permits. 

Proper provision regarding marriage laws, health programs, and the 
Child Labor Law would enroll 5*000 of the 7,206 cases falling within 
this category. Under existing conditions, this group appears to have 
had valid reasons for leaving school. 

(3) Those within compulsory school age, 7 to 15, who may 
be considered as not having valid reasons for failing to enroll in 
school - This group contained 18,553 of the 513,460 children falling 
within the compulsory school age. This figure represents 3*6 percent of the 
children of compulsory school age that should have been enrolled in 
school. In other words, the compulsory school attendance law was 

96.4 percent effective as far as getting children without legitimate 
reasons for non-attendance to enroll in school. 

Of this group 921 dropped out in high school indicating the 
school*s failure to attract and hold these youngsters. The report 
states that since they did quit, one of two things should have been 
done. In the first place, the high school program should have been 
readjusted to fit the desirable interests and needs of these children 
so that they would have wanted to enroll and remain in school. In 
the second place, these children should have been required to enroll

in school 


There were 517 children in this age group who apparently because 
of insufficient clothing, failed to enroll in school, Carty points 
out that with the many agencies to whom the schools can turn for aid, 
such a condition should not exist anywhere at any time in Kentucky, 

The law does not exempt any child from attendance in order to 
stay at home and work for their parents. In spite of this fact, 2096 
children, age 7 to 15, inclusive, remained at home and did not enroll. 
In most of these cases, certain physical or economic conditions may 
have explained their absence* But existence of such factors does not 
absolve the schools of responsibility for the education and welfare 
of these children. If it is a case of pverty or illness, it should 
be referred immediately to the state and local welfare agencies or to 
the local health authorities. Finally the compulsory attendance law 
should be invoked. 

Over three-fourths of the 18,553 in this age group failed to 
enroll because of parental indifference, indifference of the child, 
or miscellaneous causes. There is no justification under the law for 
tolerating such excuse® 

Evaluation 

Carty*s examination of the attendance and enrolment figures 
presents useful information offering some insight into the problem of 
why children are not in school, even when they are not old enough to 
be away legally. His vigorous stand on the school*s responsibility 
in respect of school attendance is heartening as it would appear from 
his review that the schools are not doing all that they might do to 
keep the youngsters in school.

XX WASTAGE IN THE SECONDARY SCHOOLS 13 
Background 

The facts regarding ”wastage 1 *, or leakage in the senior 
secondary schools in Scotland are in general well known to adminis¬ 
trators and teachers there* Nevertheless, Dr* Walker feels that it 
may be useful to publish some specific figures* In 1946, the Aberdeen 
Education Committee employed a form of ’’transfer** examination subsequently 
adopted in Aberdeen. In a report recently before the Educational Com¬ 
mittee, the Director presented the results of a follow-up inquiry 
regarding the entrants to senior high schools in 1946* In the sample 
were 2827 pupils* 

Method 

The report is based on the records of the pupils over a six- 
year period, 1946-1952. 

Findings Part I 

Of the total of 282? boys and girls who wrote the transfer 
examination, 443 were admitted to five-year courses, a percentage 
of 15.7. Of the 443, some left the city or left school because of 
illness before they had completed three years. Excluding these pupils, 
a substantial total of 179 boys and girls or 44.1 percent still dropped 
out of the Leaving Certificate course by the beginning of the fourth 
year. In other words, 4 out of 10 had given up the course by the end 
of the third year. Walker states that this is a high wastage figure, 
which raises questions regarding the proper use of teaching power and

school accomodation, to say nothing of disappointed hopes and implanted 
sense of failure. 

The wastage is higher for girls than for boys, 50 percent as 
against 3$ percent. Many girls left to seek posts in shops and offices 
or to enter other forms of gainful employment. 

The wastage group comprises pupils of varying degrees of 
measured ability. Of 77 entering employment at the end of the third 
year, 31, or some 40 percent, were found on entry to the secondary 
school to have a mental ratio of 120 or above and were adjudged to have 
a reasonable chance of achieving success in a five-year course. It is 
obvious that many factors besides measured ability contribute to success 
in senior secondary courses; nevertheless, there is a serious leakage 
from the five-year course of pupils potentially capable of completing 
such a course successfully, success being measured in terms of the 
award of the Leaving Certificate. 

Notwithstanding, there is a progressive decrease in the pro¬ 
portion of successful pupils with decrease of mental ratio. No pupil 
with a mental ratio below 110 succeeded in gaining university entrance 
qualification, even after a sixth year at secondary school. 

The total score, compounded of standardized scores in two ability 
tests, an English test, and an arithmetic test, has higher predictive 
value than the mental abilities test. Reckoned on the basis of the 4 
tests, to have a fifty-fifty chance of success, a pupil is required to 
have an average ratio of approximately 120. 

Results of the follow-up study show that very few, if any boys 
and girls are denied the chance of academic education who are capable 
of profiting by it. Whether the system results in an education suited

to the ability and aptitude of the pupils is very much a moot point* 
l‘he wastage figures are certainly serious and indicate the existence 
of a potential reservoir of ability from which the professions could 
recruit. 

Whether or not such a program eliminates many students because 
of high standards is answered by a second report showing that of the 
1946 entrants to senior secondary schools in Aberdeen, only a very few 
could avail themselves of the concession represented by lowered stan¬ 
dards. If a pupil is retarded before the fourth year, his chances of 
success are small, although a few retarded pupils did eventually suc¬ 
ceed. 

Part II 

Dr. M*Intosh, Director of Education to Fife Education Authority, 
outlined a study^ of 73 students of the High Schools in Fife who were 
capable of taking a Leaving Certificate but who, having attained the 
statutory leaving age, left school in the third year session 1952-53* 
About 4000 pupils are promoted to secondary courses each year; there¬ 
fore the wastage at the end of the third year was approximately 1.8 
percent of an age group. It is worth noting that this figure approxi¬ 
mates closely to Dr. Walker*s figure of 15 per 1000 for wastage at the 
end of the third year. 

The Youth Employment Service listed the first type of employment 
entered by these pupils and made a special investigation into any case 
which they thought would help to throw light on the problem. Jobs were 
placed in the five categories of the Registrar General*s classification:

professional, intermediate, skilled, partly skilled, unskilled. In 
addition, the pupil's record at the promotion stage was made available. 
The wastage group consisted of 35 boj's and 38 girls whose dis¬ 
tribution of IQ's is given in the following table. Three of the pupils 
had been transferred from other areas and their IQ's were not available 
they were placed in the category, non-classified (N.C,) 

The mean IQ of the group is 121; most of the students scored 
high marks in the tests of English and arithmetic at the promotion 
stage. The high scores in the promotion tests and the rectors* 
estimate that these pupils were capable of taking the Leaving Certi¬ 
ficate if they had stayed on at school, justify the assumption that the 
majority of them might have added to the pool of ability* 

The first classification of the careers of the group is given 
in this table*

It is interesting to note that 51 of the 58 pupils entered into 
skilled employment* Only 1 girl did not seek skilled employment» 

A study of case histories showed that many factors operate to 
draw from the pool of ability* 

(1) Home Background - Where there is lack of interest and where 
the financial circumstances are adverse, there is an inevitable pressure 
brought to bear on the young person to leave school and begin to add to 
the family income* 

(2) Temperament and Character - A young person with high intel¬ 
lectual ability, but who lacks the determination necessary for the 
successful completion of a course of higher study, often has little 
ambition and prefers employment which does not involve an encorachment 
on his leisure time. 

(3) Physical defects - A not inconsiderable amount of physical 
stamina is necessary in young persons if they are to complete higher 
courses of study at school, university or technical colleges. 

(4) Attraction of immediate financial gain - This is perhaps 
the greatest drain on the pool of ability. Many girls, for example, 
see little point in undertaking a university or college career as 
against a clerical appointment which gives an immediate financial return

particularly when marriage is their ultimate goal. In the same way, the 
mining industry today, with its ^Ladder Plan”, is bound to attract a 
number of intelligent boys from school because, not only is there an 
immediate financial gain, but also the opportunity of a career leading 
to many highly paid posts. 

Evaluation 

This study, through a presentation and discussion of school 
records, shows effectively the picture of pupil loss or wastage in 
Scotland*s secondary schools. An interesting feature is the fact that 
in both England and Scotland, proportionately more girls than boys drop 
out of school prematurely. This phenomenum is in marked contrast to 
the trend in Canada and the United States where proportionately more 
boys than girls find it necessary .to leave school before graduation. 

X. 547 HAVE GONE 15 
Background 

This report was prepared by the Research Division of the National 
Education Association of U.S.A. in 1948. It is a Federal Aid Series 
Bulletin designed to give interested people specific information on 
trends in school survival rates. 

Method 

School survival rates for the nation, and for a cross-section 
of states and counties are tabulated in this report. The difference

in these rates among the states are discussed, with some attempt to 
indicate the causes for these differences* Reasons for leaving school 
before graduation are offered, and an explanation of how school sur¬ 
vival rates are computed, are included in this comprehensive report* 
Application of various mesures of holding power of schools has 
revealed wide differences among the states* One such measure is the 
percent of all children fourteen to seventeen years old, inclusive, 
as reported in the U.S. Census, who were attending school at the time 
the census was taken* Another indirect index is the percentage of 
high school enrolment in a given state* The general significance of 
each type of data in bringing out gross differences among the states in 
the holding power of their schools is apparent; yet each is subject 
to limitations* For example, many census enumerators in certain states 
may make their calls during the period when schools are not in session* 
In the case of high school enrolment as a percent of the total, this 
is considerably affected by the presence or absence of kindergartens, 
by the existing rate of pupil retardation, and by whether the elementary 
school has a seven or an eight-year program* 

The U*S* Office of Education has not attempted to calculate 
rates for the several states based upon fifth-grade enrolments because 
of interstate migration. If 50 of each 1000 fifth-graders in one state 
would move to other states, without like numbers coming in to take 
their places, it would be inaccurate to base survival rates on that 
original grade five total* Conversely, if incoming pupils exceed those 
going out of the state, the fifth-grade enrolment seven years earlier 
would be too small a base to determine the holding power of the schools 
for grade XII*

In this study, fifth-grade enrolments of 1950 are used as a 
base, a correction for interstate migration is applied to these fifth- 
grade enrolments, and the survival rate in the final years of high 
school, by states, for the year 1945-46 is then determined. The general 
reliability and substantial accuracy of these survival rates seem well 
established. 

Findings 

Calculating from the 1946 enrolment data, it appears that of 
every 1000 pupils who attend public elementary schools to the grade 
V level, only 453 are still in school when the final year of high 
school is reached. In terms of national totals, this means that each 
year a million to a million and a quarter children and youth are 
dropping out without completing high school. During the time required 
to complete one twelve-year cycle of schooling, somewhere between 
twelve and fifteen million children discontinue their education before 
the final year of high school. 

Causes of school drop-outs - No one cause is responsible for 
students leaving school. Many are forced by straitened financial 
circumstances to withdraw from school and go to work. Others lack the 
sympathetic interest and encouragement at home. A few withdraw for 
health reasons, and many, especially girls, marry and drop out of 
school before reaching grade twelve. But in conjunction with these and 
similar causes, a substantial reason for leaving school is that pupils 
become disinterested in, or discouraged with respect to, its program. 
Young people will not remain in school if, rightly or wrongly, they 
believe that its program has little practical value for them. Such

judgments are often in error, but young people themselves must be con¬ 
vinced of the worthwhileness of the school program if they are to remain 
voluntarily to complete it« 

The range in holding power for the various states is very wide, 
from 204 high school seniors per 1000 former fifth grade pupils in one 
state to 731 per 1000 in another. Sane of the explanation might lie in 
the fact that the 16 states lowest in survival rates are states urgenly 
in need of federal financial assistance for public education. 

The nation*s average expenditure for public education per pupil 
in 1944-45 was $125.41* In the 16 states representing the highest 
school survival rate in 1946, the average per pupil expenditure was 
$168.46. In contrast, the average per pupil expenditure by the 16 lowest 
in survival rate was $82.16, which is less than half the average expen¬ 
diture of the 16 in the highest third. With 76 percent as many pupils 
to be educated in the 16 states forming the lowest third as there were 
in the 16 states of the highest third, actual expenditures in the low 
group were only 37 percent of those of the 16 states high in holding 
power. If the states are divided into thirds according to expenditures 
per pupil, twelve of the 16 states shown to be low in survival rates are 
also in the lowest third on the basis of expenditures. These twelve 
states are Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, 
Mississippi, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia and West 
Virginia.

Division supply a cross-section appraisal of survival rates in the 
United States. These figures support and confirm previous discussions 
on school survival rates in the various states« 

Alabama - In white schools in 1946, the twelfth grade enrolment 
was less than one-sixth of the 1935 first-grade enrolment and about 
one-fourth of the 1939 fifth-grade enrolment. In Negro schools in 
1946, the twelfth-grade enrolment was about one tenth of the 1939 fifth 
grade. The survival rate was 238 per 1000 former fifth grade pupils. 

Connecticut - From analysis of grade enrolments year by year 
the state department estimates that of each 1000 pupils who enter the 
first grade, 795 complete the eightht grade and 446 go on to the twelfth 
grade. For each 1000 entering high school, 561 reach Grade XII. The 
survival rate index is 506 per 1000 former fifth-grade pupils. 

Delaware - There is no data on losses from the elementary 
schools. At the high school level, 56 pupils in 1946 and 54 in 1947 
reached the twelfth grade for each 100 who entered high school in 1943 
and 1944> respectively. Those graduating in 1946 and 1947 were 51 
percent and 62 percent of their respective freshman classes. The sur¬ 
vival rate index is 438 per 1000 former fifth-grade pupils. 

Florida - During the biennium 1944-1946, of each 1000 entering 
the first grade, 693 entered the sixth grade. Similarly, of each 1000 
who entered Grade VII, 465 entered Grade XII. The survival rate index 
is 338 per 1000 former fifth grade pupils. 

Indiana - No data for elementary schools. The percent of pupils 
withdrawing from high schools of the state during two school years were

Iowa - Latest study of withdrawals was made in 1938. At that 
time, 77 percent of the eighth grade graduates entered high school and 
three fourths of these remained to complete the high school program. 

The survival rate index is 624 per 1000. 

Kentucky - For each 1000 pupils entering the first grade in 
1935, 260 entered the eighth grade in 1942, 202 enrolled in grade IX 
the next year, and only 127 entered high school in 1946. Survival rate 
index, present memorandum: 332 per 1000. 

Maryland - For the year 1945, the percents of the largest age

graduates entered high school, and the high school graduates in those 
years were 56.5 percent and 61.2 percent respectively, of the ninth- 
grade classes of 1942 and 1943* Twelfth-grade enrolments in 1946 were 
48 percent of the first-grade enrolment of 1935 and 54 percent of the 
fifth-grade enrolment in 1939* The survival rate index is 486 per

Minnesota - In 1946, the twelfth-grade enrolment was 55 percent 
of the first-grade enrolment for the same year. The high school 
graduates were 60 percent of the first-grade enrolment in 1931* The 
survival rate index is 631 per 1000. 

Missouri - In 1947, the pupils in grade VIII were 68.3 percent 
of those in the 1940 first grade, and the twelfth-grade enrolment 
was 47.2 percent of the 1940 fifth-grade enrolment. The survival 
index is 421 per 1000* 

New Hampshire - From an estimate made in 1946, of each 100 
eighth-grade graduates in the state, only 90 enter high school and, 
of these, 54 graduate. The survival rate index is 503 per 1000 fifth- 
grade pupils. 

New Mexico - There were 3440 twelfth-grade pupils in 1945 and 
3454 in 1944 as compared with 11,839 fifth-grade pupils in 1938 and 
11,775 in 1937. These ratios, uncorrected for interstate migration 
would be 291 and 293 per 1000, respectively. As calculated in the 
presentnBmorandum, the survival index is 326 per 1000* 

New York - Data for a continuous period of eleven years show 
that the number of children in grade II who continue to grade VIII 
seven years later decreases at the rate of eleven percent a year. 

The number of entering ninth-grade pupils who later graduate from high 
school has ranged in the past seven years from 40 to 48 percent. The 
survival rate index is 565 per 1000. 

North Carolina - The percent of pupils dropping out of school 
during each school year since 1938 has ranged from 6.2 to 7*1 percent. 
The survival rate index is 389 per 1000.

Employing the grade V enrolment for purposes of comparison, 
the Alberta survival rate index is approximately 350 per 1000. The 
index rate for Canada is approximately only 182 per 1000. The range 
in provincial retention rates in terms of percentage is from a low of 
0.3 percent in Prince Edward Island to a high of 28 percent in Albeata. 

Evaluation 

This memorandum presents accurate figures on school survival 
rates, figures which place early school leaving in its true and dis¬ 
couraging perspective. The totals for each state are impressive; 
those for the nation are staggering. These facts point strongly to 
the need of federal aid to up-grade school retention rates. 

The discussion of causes of drop-outs is based on a study 
of research on the problem. It would appear that the Research 
Division probably touched on the heart of the whole matter of drop¬ 
outs when it names disinterest and discouragement as key factors. 

This study provides many insights and Implications relating 
to early school leaving, and is, in general, an excellent contribution

Background 

The sample in this study comprises a total of 483,052 boys 
and girls throughout the second degree grades in France. These 
grades are comparable to the junior and senior high schools of 
America. The study is longitudinal, beginning in 1946 and carried 
through to 1953. 

The purpose of the study is to note the distribution of 
students in various grades, particularly in high school, to show 
what happens to one group of stdents relative to dropping out from 
one year to another. 

Method 

The authors examine, interpret, and discuss the annual atten¬ 
dance data for the various school systems in France. 

Findings 

1. The sample of 4^3,052, as of November 15, 1952, represents 
a 6 percent increase over the 1951 secondary school population. 

2. The female population increased more than did the male, 
rising to 47.5 percent from 46 percent. 

3* The secondary schools show an increase in school retention 
of nearly 7 percent in 1952-53 over French retention rates in 1951-52. 

An examination of the French classical school retention rates 
reveals interesting trends.

1* The largest decrease in school retention is between the 
sixth and the fifth classes, then levels off to a reduced rate of 
decrease up to graduation. 

2. More students appear to be finishing high school now. Of 
100 boys and girls in the sixth class in 1946-47, there were 66 in the 
second class in 1953* This represents a steady and marked increase 
which would appear to continue. It is difficult to compute the number 
passing from class two to class one because some students fail to 
pass university admission examinations and have to return to high 
school for another year of philosophy, science, and mathematics. 

3. Thirty to forty pupils of a beginning class drop out 
before reaching class 2. One main reason for these drop-outs in the 
classical schools appears to be the lack of orientation of students 
at the sixth class level because after the fifth class, the drop-outs 
levelled off. The fifth class is comparable to our grade seven, at 
which point there appears to be the greatest amount of orientation and 
guidance. A second reason is the fact that many students in the 
classical schools are eliminated because of difficulty with foreign 
languages. These people leave and swell the number in the modern schools*

Of the total of 46,000 high school students who withdrew from 
traditional schools, 29 percent in 1949-50, and 32 percent in 1950-51 
did so either by transferring to another school, like the technical, 
or by dropping out* 

In comparing school retention rates for the large cities, trans¬ 
fers were not considered* On the basis of home students only, sixth 
class retention rates place Marsailles first, Paris second, then 
Montpellier, Nancy, and Grenoble, all above national norns. On the 
other end with low retention are, in order, Portiers, Dijon, Rennes, 
and Caen* This distribution should be compared with the importance 
attached to secondary education in private schools. In areas where 
free schools are prevalent, the relationship between the number of 
students in public school and the total population is diminished. For 
example, Renne and Lyons are influenced by private schools. In the

other three cities with low retention there is no influence by 
private schools, rather these centres are not large, and are primarily 
agricultural. 

The study shows that 30 percent of the young people of France 
go to school only until they reach compulsory school leaving age. 
Furthermore, in Caen, Poiter, Dijon, and in particular Renne, this 
figure surpasses 40 percent. 

In other academies in 1951-52, like Lille, Strasbourg, and 
Basancon, the reason for low percentage enrolments is the development 
of technical schools which draw students away from the public schools 
to apprenticeship. In 1951-52, however, the attendance at public 
schools had grown in notable proportions and is gaining ground in 
regions where prior to this, private schools equalled or even surpassed 
in importance the public schools. 

The French Government has built secondary schools in congested 
centres of population and has made necessary changes to fit the needs 
of students in curriculum and finance. These efforts are increasing 
school retention at the second degree, or high school level. 

Evaluation 

The study presents data to show the status of school retention 
in France as a whole, and of a cross-section of her cities. In all 
cases, trends are indicated and adequate explanations for them are 
offered. The report is well organized and effectively presented.

CHAPTER IX 


STUDY OF FACTORS RELATED TO EARLY SCHOOL LEAVING 
Invariably, no single reason has been found as the 
cause for early school leaving. There appears to operate 
a multiplicity or cluster of factors which influence 
school withdrawal. Gragg 1 reported that the failure of 
any criterion to measure absolute correlation between 
graduation and drop-out led to the conclusion that dropping 
out is a result of several forces working concomitantly. 
Gragg states that any investigator seeking to gain a 
better understanding of the drop-out problem must shift 
from the traditional approach of endeavoring to isolate 
causes of drop-out to a new one of seeking factors which 
are most closely associated with the problem. 

While no factor operates to the extent that all 
drop-outs fall on one side of the line and all graduates 
on the other, it is possible to establish critical points 
which differentiate between a majority of the graduates and 
a majority of the drop-outs. 

This chapter will review the literature which covers 
research attempting to seek out these factors. Studies 
will be presented in the order of diminishing numbers of 
factors.

I FACTORS IN VOLUNTARY DROP-OUTS 2 
Background 

As Director of Guidance in the Detroit Public School 
system, Dresher attempted to find out why so many boys and 
girls left secondary school grades before graduation. His 
sample was made up of all those who did not return or who 
withdrew voluntarily from 18 academic high schools, one 
trade school, and one technical high school of the Detroit 
Michigan Public School system during the month of September 
1951. There were 622 cases in the study, 311 each of boys 
and of girls. 

Dresher defined a drop-out as one who has left school 
permanently for reasons other than graduation or transfer 
to another school. He excepted those who leave school to 
take employment but complete required subjects in evening 
school to qualify for high school graduation. 

Method 

Data were obtained from enrolment and cumulative 
records, and from physical examination cards. If necessary, 
school officials such as the principal or assistant 
principal, counselor, and attendance officer or visiting 
teacher were interviewed. Each student who dropped out,

and his parents, were interviewed by the attendance officer. 
Drop-out forms were completed for 601 out of 622 drop-outs. 

Each item was coded and punched on I.B.M. cards in such a 
way that the machine could compare any two factors. 

From bibliographic studies Dresher listed 301 factors 
associated with dropping out of school. He selected 39 
leading factors for his study and used Ghi-square to compute 
their relationship to the criterion, age of drop-out. In 
this way he was able to arrive at primary and secondary holding 
and hastening power factors. The latter includes those 
factors which influence a student toward leaving school. 

Findings 

The following factors were related to the criterion, 
age of drop-out. Therefore, they are considered of primary 
importance in school drop-outs. First, Holding Power Factors: 

Out-of-school employment. 

Participation in ecttracurricular activities. 

Having school spirit. 

Having a sense of belonging in the high school. 

Participation in out-of-school activities. 

Good attitude of parents toward education, high 

school, and teachers. 

The pupil having a career plan. 

A desire to complete high school

The following factors influence boys and girls to 
leave school before graduation. They are Hastening Power 
Factors: 

Elementary school failures. 

Absences in ninth grade. 

Low scholastic aptitude. 

Being a discipline case. 

The following factors were not related directly to 
the criterion, age of drop-out, but were found to have a 
relationship to another factor that was related to the 
criterion, and are therefore considered to contribute to 
factors of secondary importance. These he called Secondary 
Holding Power Factors: 

Skilled occupation of parent in preference to unskilled 

Good citizenship rating. 

Living with both natural parents 

Similarly, Secondary Hastening Pwwer Factors were: 

High School subject failure. 

High School absences. 

Physical defects. 

EVALUATION 

Dresher’s statistical development of holding and 
hastening power factors has useful possibilities. His 
study would have made a much more positive contribution 
to the problem of pupil retention and withdrawal if he

had had a like sample of school remainers. It would then have 
been possible to note the extent to which these holding and 
hastening factors distinghished the child who left from the 
one who remained. 

II FACTORS WHICH DISTINGUISH DROP-OUTS 5 
Background 

Dr. Gragg used all the boys and girls who dropped 
out of the Ithaca, New Hbrk; and New Haven, Connecticut, 
public schools in 1947 as his sample. He is the Assistant 
Superintendent of the Ithaca Public Schools. 

Method 

Besides investigating all who dropped out in the two 
communities, Gragg selected as control group a like number 
of students who graduated from school the same year. In 
this way the investigator was able to obtain the most 
significant factors distinguishing the drop-out from the 
graduate. For the drop-outs, principals gave additional 
information on a prepared questionnaire. 

Findings 

Gragg found the following factors either "most 
significant" or "nonsignificant" in his study. These are

in effect, predictive factors identifying early school 


leavers. 

Most Significant 

Retardation 

Sex (Boys 2:1) 

Verbal intelligence 

School achievement 
(Standardised tests) 
Participation in extra 
class activities 
Membership in homes broken 
by divorce of parents 
Occupation of parents 
(Managerial, clerical, 
professional, and non¬ 
professional more likely 
to be graduated) 


Nonsignificant 

Racial stock 

Health status 

School attendance 

School tardiness 

Personality ratings by 
home room teachers. 

Tenure of residence 

Major subjects (English, 
Mathematics. Social Studies 
and Science) 


Gragg suggests that there must be other factors 
associated with dropping out* Psychology might reveal 
personality patterns definitely related to dropping out. 
Through the use of sociemetric analysis, sociology might 
show relationships between dropping out and group organization 
patterns of classrooms, neighbourhoods and play groups. 

He stresses the need of an earlier attack on the problem 
when the child enters school. 

EVALUATION 

Dr. Gragg appears to have brought a new approach into 
the study of early school leaving, that of seeking the 
factors in the total situation which are most closely 
related to the problem, instead of trying to isolate causes

of dropping out. These factors are valuable as a guide 
to the school administrator who wishes to make an early 
discovery of potential drop-outs with a view to the 
establishment of a corrective program. 

Through his use of objective data from school records 
and case studies, relating both to drop-outs and a control 
group, Gragg was able to complete a factor analysis of the 
two groups. 

Because of his large sample and sound research design, 
some generalization of his findings might be proper. 

Ill REPORT OF DROP-OUT COMVUTTEE 4 
Background 

This report summarizes the data from the questionnaires, 
which were part of the above study. The information covers 
the six pupils from Junior High School and the twenty-three 
from Senior High of one Ithaca Public School who withdrew 
from September 6, 1950 through February 38, 1951 before 
graduation for reasons other than transferring to other 
schools, marriage, or joining the armed services.

Method 

Guidance counselors, the senior high school principal, 
or the teachers in charge of attendance stated their opinions 
about these drop-outs on prepared questionnaires. 

Findings 

Interpretation of the data by Gragg shows these findings: 

The majority of the pupils are from families having 
moderate to poor incomes. Only three were in comfortable 
circumstances and none came from wealthy homes. 

Only eight could be recommended for jobs. The fields 
for which these were fitted were skilled or semi-skilled 
with but one exception—that of trades and distributive 
occupations. 

Their chief asset was physical fitness though a 
surprising number, twelve, fall in the intelligent group. 

Twenty-two of the twenty-nine have presented unusual 
problems: scholastic, attendance, and personality, in that 
order. 

Home environment, including relationship between parents 
in care of the children, has been a detrimental factor with 
the majority. 

EVALUATION 

As these questionnaires represent only opinions, the 
results are not necessarily conclusive.

IV INCREASING THE NATION’S HOLDING POWER. 5 

Background 

In this study, Sam M. Lambert, Director of Research 
and Public Relations of the West Virginia Education Assoc¬ 
iation, gives a progress report of the Associations three 
year study of why 65$ of the Mountain State's boys and 
girls are failing to finish school. 

Method 

The W.V.E.A. held three summer work conferences 
beginning in 1947 at which time 150 laymen, teachers, 
principals, and superintendents met to explore causes 
that lead to leaving school. For this purpose, six 
discussion groups were set up for the study of the problem 
in relation to intermediate, junior high school and senior 
high school grades. 

In 1948, the Conference selected a group which built 
detailed suggestions on how to plan and organize local 
studies, including sample discussion outlines to be used 
in county-wide work conferences and interview blanks to 
conduct individual case studies. Special committees were 
set up to plan specific research projects. Plans were 
made to visit the home of emery student who quit in 1948. 
In some counties, the entire teaching staff acted as the

interviewing corps. Visits were made, problems discussed 
with parents and pupils, and reports prepared for the 
research committee. Before the year was over, case-study 
reports numbered in the thousands. 

During the 1949 work conference, another group was 
organized to summarize all that had been learned on the 
drop-out problem, eliminating overlapping and duplication. 
The aim was to produce research methods and techniques for 
local studies, or to compare experiences of various schools 

The W.V.E.A. staff completed the job the following 
winter. 

Findings 

Health was found to be a critical factor. Fifteen per 
cent of those who quit did so because of personal illness 
or of prolonged illness or death at home. 

The attitude of parents proved important. In one 
county, 31 % of the parents had wanted their children to 
stay in school, 9% had urged their children to quit, and 
26% did not care either way. 

Marriage was an important escape route for the girls. 
In 2 counties involving 2000 drop-outs, one in every ten 
left for this reason. 

53% of all who quit did so at the legal leaving age; 
23% quit before that. 

Frequent transfers from one school to another was a 
basic cause for ten per cent of the drop-outs in one county

Two counties reported that 50$ of drop-outs had little 
or no interest in school. 

One county used case-studies of over 1000 drop-outs 
over a period of two years. This county reported that a 
surprisingly small per cent "were mentally unable to cope 
with school work". 

70$ of the families of students leaving school in one 
county enjoyed a financial status that was completely 
satisfactory; only 5 per cent were on relief. 

One large county reported only 9$ of those quitting 
were disciplinary cases. 

11 of 55 county school systems found that over 30$ 
of pupils who reached grade VTII filed to go on to grade 
IX the following year. Most were on the 8-4 plan. 

Many failed to go to high school because of a fear 
complex built by parents, older students, and elementary 
teachers. 

Superior teachers doing high quality teaching constitute 
one of the most important factors in any consideration of 
the holding power problem. 

Only three counties graduated over 50$ of their pupils. 
These high holding power counties were characterized by a 
high degree of industrialization, compact population, high 
wages, and well-developed secondary schools.

Other factors related to dropping out of school included 
a lack of variety in the curriculum of the typical small 
secondary school, transportation problems, lack of adequate 
guidance programs, and retardation. One report said that 
the subject-centred philosophy which demanded the same 
accomplishment of all pupils was driving thousands of children 
out of school. 

EVALUATION 

A longituidual method is always a most useful means 
of studying the problem of school retention since it reveals 
the nature and importance of factors operating at different 
levels. This study emphasized the fact that different factors 
operate at different levels from the intermediate grades 
through to high school. 

As in the Minnesota studies, the data on school 
retention rates show much variation from county to county 
so that the results cannot be generalized to the whole 
state of West Virginia. The findings on county levels are 
more valid, but again differences within counties must be 
assumed. The study would have produced more insightful 
findings if the W.V.E.A. had used the case study technique 
on an equal number of students who remained to graduate 
and then compared the results.

V DO SCHOOL COSTS DRIVE OUT THE YOUTH OF THE POOR ? 6 

Background 

Harold Hand, of the Illinois State Guidance Department 
directed this study in nearly eighty schools in principal 
regions of Illinois outside the city of Chigago. He tried 
to evaluate the extent to which school costs to the student 
operate as a factor in school withdrawal. The schools 
ranged in student population from less than one hundred 
to over 2000• 

A second study followed, using 13 schools from the 
original sample. These schools had all four high school 
grades, with grade nine being used in the study, and were 
well scattered in size and location. 

Method 

The children were placed in one of three categories, 
upper, middle, and lower, on the basis of socio-economic 
status of the family. Then each child, in the first 
experiment, on an inventory made to fit each school, told 
the full story of his participation in extra-curricular 
activities. The activities were classified as primary,

Ratios were derived by dividing the medians for the upper 
by those for the lower social-economic groups. 

In the second study, using grade nine classes in the

Had the accident of birth in an economic sense been in 
no way associated with who did and who did not participate 
in extra-class life of the schools, these ratios would all 
have been about 1 to 1. Such was not the case. 

The ratios show that children of less privileged 
families had fewer social opportunities than those with 
higher economic status. At the same time it was found that 
no factor other than socio-economic status made any difference 
when this factor was held constant, neither sex nor grade 
nor distance from the school were associated to any 
significant degree with the extent to which the pupil either 
did or did not participate in extra-class activities. 

This initial study found that 72% of all boys and 
girls who dropped out of high school came from families 
low on the income saale. 

In the second study, one of hidden tuition costs, 

Hand records the actual average costs of such expenditures 
as text books, participation on the school S s interscholastie 
athletic teams, attendance at home athletic contests, 
attendance at ninth grade dances, parties, banquets, and 
picnics. He considers also the cost of a yearbook, school 
paper subscription, class pins or rings, physical education 
uniforms, towels, locker-fees, insurance, photographs, 
notebooks, pencils, briefcases, school sweaters, chafity 
drives and other solicitations, and other costs as indicated 
by teachers and sponsors.

He found these hidden costs of an education to be very- 
high and, coupled with the findings of the first study,- Hand 
concludes that one-third of the families could not afford it. 
As 7 out of 10 early school leavers are from the lower socio¬ 
economic group the implications of hidden school costs on 
school leaving are apparent. For corroborating evidence he 
cites recent findings of the U.S. Bureau of Statistics which 
reveal that 32% of all American families today find it 
impossible to meet their living costs out of current income. 

EVALUATION 

School costs in this study were objectively computed 
on a large sample of schools, sufficiently varied in size 
and location to give a true representation of this factor 
in those regions. Since this is an objective study and one 
that is substantiated by national statistics, it is fair 
to assume school costs to be a weighty factor wherever 
youth drop out of school. It should be remembered, too, 
that the hidden cost study used grade nine classes for 
its sample and that school costs increase with increasing 
grades. 

It would appear that the experimental design is adequate 
and the findings are valid because they represent actual 
costs. Since 72% of all who become early withdrawals are 
from low socio-economic groups, it would seem that Hand 
had successfully established school costs as one of two 
significant factors related to dropping out of school.

VI DIFFEBENGES IN ACADEMI0 ACHIEVEMENT 7 

This research, conducted by Harold A. Bowman, supervisor 
of test construction in the Los Angeles City Schools, 
measured the difference in academic achievement between 
pupils who left and pupils who entered Los Angeles High 
Schools, 1948 - 1950, 

Background 

The sample comprises three groups: 

All the students in the high schools of Los Angeles 
in grade X in 1948, regarded as a group, in its progress 
from grade X to grade XII, without reference to the indiv¬ 
iduals who constituted the group. 

Those pupils who appeared in 1948 in grade X but did 
not appear in grade XII in 1950. 

Those pupils who appeared in grade XII in 1950, but 
who had not been members of the original 1948 group. 

The original 1948 Grade X group numbered 12,700 
students. Of this group, 11,500 were in grade XI in 
1949, and 9,700 in grade XII in 1950. 

Method 

The list for each school T s group of 1948 grade X 
pupils was checked against the list of grade XII pupils 


7. Bowman, Howard, A., Differences in Academic Achievement, 
Journal of Educational Research, San Francisco, 1952, 
pp. 216-223. The grade X list was pencil marked to 
indicate each pupil whose name did not appear on the 
grade XII list. Similarly, the grade XII list was pencil 
marked to indicate the names of pupils who had not been 
in the original grade X group.

for the same school in 1950. 

A 3" by 5" card was typed for each pupil. This card 
carried the following data: pupil's name, grade, school, 

I. Q., chronological age, Iowa test standard score. 

Cards were alphabetized for each grade level group. 
This made it possible to cross-check the two groups in 
ordef- to pick up any further pupils who had been a part 
of the original group, but had not appeared as grade XII 
in the same school. 

Two sets of cards remained. One group contained the 
data for all pupils who had been tested as grade X in 
1948, but who had not been tested as grade XII in 1950. 

The second group contained the cards of grade XII pupils 
of 1950 who had not earlier been tested as grade X in 1948. 

Findings 

The following tables summarize the major findings of 
this research. 

Table XXI is a comparison of Chronological Age, 
Intelligence Quotient, and Achievement Test Data between 

II, 1B0 grade X pupils tested in March 1948, and 3,845

who were no longer enrolled as members of the group in 
April, 1950.

The data in the tables may be interpreted as follows: 

Difference in Number — Of the original 12,700 
grade X group, 11,120 pupils or 87.6 per cent were tested. 
Of these, 3,825 or 34.58 per cent did not reappear as 
grade HI pupils two years later. In their stead had 
been enrolled 2,124 pupils who had not been members of the 
original class. The difference, 1,701, represents a 
net loss of 15.3 per cent of the original group. This 
number is the minimal estimate of the high school drop¬ 
out proportion. A comparison of the total estimated 
enrollments for grade X in 1948 and grade XII in 1950 
indicates a loss of 23.6 per cent. 














146 


Differenoea in Chronologioal Age and Capacity — The 
drop-out pupils were, on the average, five months older 
than the total group, indicating a chronological retardation 
of one semester. The average intelligence quotient was 
2.8 points lower than was the average for the class as a 
whole. 

The late entering group was three months older, on 
the average, and 2.3 points lower in intelligence quotient 
than the average for the entire group. 

Differences in Achievement — The drop-out group is 
lower in achievement than the class as a whole with the 
range from 1.4 to 3.0 standard scores. The composite 
score is 2.1 standard scores behind the class as a whole. 
This deficit would indicate a retardation of approximately 
one year in terms of grade placement values. 

The late entry group shows a loss of 1.3 standard 
scores, or a retardation of 7 months. 

EVALUATION 

The findings give for Los Angeles a general over¬ 
view of the three categories of students tested, but 
since a clear-cut statistical analysis was not possible 
due to the absence of certain essential data, interpretation 
by inspection only was possible. The results, therefore, 
cannot be applies to any other school population except by 


inference

The difference in achievement of the drop-out gfoup 
is probably not a real difference, since the apparent 
increase in achievement of the late-entry group in all 
probability represents rather a decrease in loss of 
achievement due to the fact that the group would no longer 
contain many of its less able members. 

The data appear to indicate that transient pupils, 
whatever their origin, tend to be older, less able, and 
lower in achievement than permanent pupils. 

71I HOLDING POWER AND SIZE OF HIGH SCHOOL 8 
Background 

Gaumitz and Tompkins, specialists in the administration 
of high schools, attempted to gauge the extent to which 
the factor, size of high school, was related to holding 
power. The study was made on a state-wide basis, examining 
data for all schools which offered the last 4 years of 
high school work. This included 11,957 regularly organized 
4-year high schools and the 6,358 schools operating as 
undivided, junior-senior high schools. In cases of the 
few remaining high schools which still begin with grade 
8 rather than grade 9, the data for the respective first 
second, third, and fourth years were grouped together. 

Five categories of size were used.

Method 


The investigators extracted data from studies presented 
in the Biennial Survey of Education in the United States, 

1945 - 1946, Chapter V — data which appeared to have bearing 
on the problem of holding power of the high school. Since 
the data referred to the high school only, and for just one 
year, the applicability of these statistics would be limited. 
To overcome this weakness, and to test the validity of the 
data, the authors present facts from supplementary sources. 

Findings 

All high schools fall short of their announced goal 
of serving all youth. 

Two out of every five boys and girls drop out after 
entering high school. 

Well over half of all youth either do not enter high 
school or drop out before graduation. 

Secondary schools of the states recording highest 
holding power indices, as defined by this study, appear 
to be two to three times as successful in retaining youth 
to the twelfth grade level as those showing the lowest 
holding power indices. 

State school systems which maintain separate high 
schools for minority groups almost invariably whow low 
holding power.

Indices of most of the states show few significant 
holding power differences between the reorganized and the 
traditionally organized high schools. Those recording 
significant differences are more often in favor of schools 
organized as junior-senior high schools. 

No clear, consistent evidence was found to demonstrate 
the superiority in holding power of the larger high schools 
over the smaller ones. In many states the smaller high 
schools seem to retain youth better than do the middle- 
sized schools. In a few states the smallest high schools 
excel even the largest schools in holding power. 

EVALUATION 

It is difficult to evaluate the influence of only one 
factor, because holding power is affected by a multiplicity 
of influences and these would have to be considered in 
comparing the holding power of the various sized high 
schools. For example, in some of the States, especially 
those with disproportionately large rural areas, many 
elementary schools offer from one to three years of 
high school work. Insofar as such schools send their 
pupils in disproportionate numbers to the nearby small 
high schools to complete their work in grades 11 and IS, 
the ratios of holding power for the smaller high schools 
are likely to be higher than they otherwise would be.

Another difficulty in comparing these indices of 
high school holding power by size of schools arises from 
the fact that the several size categories naturally merge 
quantitatively into each other. There would be comparatively 
small differences in holding power between a typical school 
in the one group enrolling 95 pupils and another in the 
second enrolling 105 pupils. Such differences would be 
even less marked between a school in the fourth size group¬ 
ing with 475 pupils and another in the next size grouping 
with 510 pupils. To eliminate such difficulties, Gaumitz 
and Tompkins compared ratios for schools in the 100-199 
enrolment group to those in the 500 and over group. 

A similar study? relating to class size was completed 
using a questionnaire to obtain the opinions of 504 teachers 
in 179 public secondary schools. Again, no definite 
relationships were found to exist.

VIII TRUANCY AND CLASSROOM DISORDER' 


10 

Background 

Mullen’s 1945-46 study of 1628 children from the 
secondary schools of Chicago compared those who dropped 
out under truancy conditions and a group in school which 
was referred to the child study bureau for disorderliness. 

He began with the axiom that the child is truant because 
he is unhappy and unsuccessful in school. 

Method 

Data were compiled from records of individual exam¬ 
inations by psychologists and psychiatrists of the Bureau 
of Child Study of the Chicago Board of Education. In 1945, 
8262 individual examinations were given, in 1946, 8679 
tests were administered. Sources of data included a mental 
test, educational achievement tests, physical tests and 
observations, interviews with parents, school personnel, 
social agencies, truant officers, physicians and clinicians, 
and others. Information was coded on the basis of a 
numerical system, and IBM punch cards prepared. 

All pupils who were coded as having histories of 
truancy, but were not conspicuously disorderly in class 
were placed in the truant group. Those who were considered

notably disorderly but not truant formed the group labelled: 
"discipline problem in the classroom." Subdivisions were 
made into a pre-adolescent group, ages 9-12, and an adoles¬ 
cent group, ages 13-16. 

The above four groups were compared with each other 
and with the whole range of child study cases for the year 
1946. This group was not representative of all truant or 
disorderly pupils in the school system but only of those 
of the specified ages selected for referral to this agency. 

Findings 

The disorderly group in school had poorer work habits, 
were more hyperactive, were more aggressive, had more anti¬ 
social behavior, and more temper tantrums® This group ex¬ 
hibited very clearly aggressive frustrated behavior® 

The school histories of the in-school group were more 
erratic than those of the truant group. Their homes present 
more social and family problems, and have poorer personal 
adjustment of home members® 

The truant group showed more lying and stealing. It 
exhibited fairly clearly a regressive type of frustrated 
behavior. 

The truant group had more home problems: crowded homes 
broken homes, relief, parents or siblings delinquent or 
criminal, step-parents in the home, or foster-home placement 
especially in the case of girls®

Bioth types suffer extreme educational retardation in 
terms of grade placement and even more in terms of basic 
skill subjects. 

In adolescence, grade retardation and reading disability 
appear more prevalent among those who become classroom 
problems than among truants. 

An Indiana study^corroborates some of these findings 
by Mullen. Two age groups in one Indiana high school were 
studied intensively with various types of approaches. The 
results on the Differential Aptitude Tests 12 showed that 
despite varying trait differences in certain ’’intellectual” 
traits, the school was not adapting its program to such 
differences either between the sexes or within one sex 
group. In view of these tremendous sex differences, to 
throw these boys and girls together in the same courses 
or course patterns, without differentiated instruction, 
and to impose the same standards of achievement for both 
would certainly not promote good adjustment for the boys 
and might even set up psychological disadvantages for 
the girls. Most of the 17-year-old boys could not possibly 
enjoy much success in a pattern of academic type courses.

If the tests are at all valid, it is doubtful whether more 
than 10 per cent of the 17-year-old boys would etfer be 
successful in college work of the liberal arts type. 

Results of the California Mental Health Analysis^ 
used in the Indiana study showed many tendencies toward 
maladjustment or frustration. Both 17-year-old boys and 
17-year-old girls exhibited excessive emotional instability. 
Achievement in fundamental skills, social participation, 
and attitudes of various types showed somewhat the same 
pattern of serious maladjustment of youth to school and to 
life which when added together, indicated a serious problem 
for American Education, 

EVALUATION 

Mullen studied adolescents against the background of 
their own communities. Each individual is in his own 
setting, reacting naturally to a usual environment. The 
community develops social values in youth, which are mirrored 
in various forms of behavior in the classroom. 

The major finding of this study, that the disorderly- 
in-school groups exhibit aggressive frustrated behavior, 
and that the truant group exhibit regressive frustrated 
behavior is a very important finding for education. These

two groups are unhappy, unsuccessful. Why? Physical 
conditions, history, innate mental capacities, home and 
community environment, curriculum, teaching practices, 
environment of the school—any factor from any one of 
these areas may produce a prohlem symptom. More likely, 
several factors from several areas will be found to 
contribute to a particular child’s behavior pattern. 

In the case of educational retardation it would be 
difficult to decide whether the phenomenon is a cause or 
effect of behavior problems. 

On the basis of Mullen’s method of gathering data, 
and the varied areas investigated in seeking information, 
it would appear that the findings regarding truant drop¬ 
outs and disorderly remainers are possible of widespread 
applicability to these two groups in other school systems.

IX WITHDRAWALS OF PUPILS FROM SECONDARY GRAMMAR SCHOOLS 14 

Background 

This summary of England*s Grammar School withdrawals 
appears in the April, 1951 minutes of the Executive Committee 
of the National Association of Divisional Executives for 
Education which met in London to discuss a wide range of 
subjects pertaining to education. 

Method 

Detailed returns had been received from about 100 
Divisional Executives and Excepted Districts as to the 
extent of the withdrawal of pupils from secondary grammar 
schools before the completion of the course, the reason for 
such withdrawals, and the action taken by the local author¬ 
ities to deal with the problem. The report covers a wide 
area of the country, and in many instances the information 
provides a survey of the problem over a number of years. 

Findings 

The Extent of Withdrawals. 

There is a wide variation in the extent of premature 
withdrawals, not only between authorities, but between 
individual schools within the same authority. For example, 
in one divisional executive, an administrative unit, in

Kent, one case only has been reported in three years. In 
another, daring the six months July to December, 1950, in 
three grammar schools with a total roll of 1,640, only three 
children left without completing the course. Against this, 
in a large Excepted District in the South, the percentage 
of withdrawals at the age of 15 to the intake at 11 has 
been, over the period 1948-50, as high as 25 per cent for 
the boys and 33 per cent for the girls. 

The tradition and quality of the school, the extent 
to which it can secure and maintain the interest of the 
pupils and provide a real incentive for the full course of 
studies, is always an important factor, although it would 
be untrue to draw an inference that a large number of early 
leavers is necessarily an indication of failure on the part 
of the school. Certainly no comparison could be made between 
schools solely on this fattor. 

It is almost everywhere true that the withdrawal of 
girls is larger than that of boys. Thus, in a coeducational 
school in Essex with 770 children enrolled, during 1950 
one boy and 12 girls left before the completion of the 
course, while in a Middlesex Excepted District with three 
grammar schools, 72 left before course completion, 52 of 
whom were girls.

There has been a tendency for the size of the problem 
to increase during the period from 1945-49, although the 
rate of growth has not been uniform. 

Reasons Given for Withdrawal 
It is extremely difficult to give precise reasons for 
the withdrawal of a particular pupil. All the evidence shows 
that the actual excuse given many be quite different from 
the real reasons, and that all factors are related. The 
chief reasons given ate: 

Economic Hardship — Almost everywhere economic 
necessity, which is defined as the inability to maintain the 
child in food and clothing and the need for a contribution 
to the family income from the child’s earning, is cited as 
a reason for premature leaving. In many instances, however, 
this appears to be a mask to cover the real reasons which 
are much more complex. It is a contributing factor rather 
than a real reason. Where this factor is coupled with 
disappointing or unsatisfactory reports from school, the 
pressure becomes almost overwhelming. 

In some cases, pupils whose ability may be high, but 
whose health is indifferent, are withdrawn by parents and 
often at the desire of the children themselves. In a few 
cases the health of the mother leads to the girl being 
withdrawn. Rather, however, than give these reasons, the 
plea of economic hardship is submitted.

Failure to Make the Grade — Rather less emphasis is 
placed upon the failure of children to make the necessary- 
grade in grammar school work. Such a failure means that the 
original selection scheme was unsatisfactory; that there has 
been a less rapid development of ability than was anticipated 
or that other personal qualities, unmeasured at the time of 
transference, have militated against the child’s success. 

Indifference on the part of pupil or parent — Where 
both the home and the pupil are antagonistic to the school, 
great effort is needed to retain the child. 

EVALUATION 

It would appear that the findings of this report are 
based on adequate data and sound procedures. The conditions 
surrounding school withdrawals in England are comparable 
to those in America, with the notable exception of the 
fact that more girls than boys leave school early in 
England, This might have something to do with the English 
tradition that a boy has a greater need for the background 
of a secondary education.

X NEW T0RK CONFERENCE STUDIES 15 
Background 

The New York State Education Department reported to the 
Conference its plan on three city studies of early school 
leavers. The objectives of the studies included: 

Learning the characteristics of drop-outs. 

The causes of their terminating school prior to 
graduation. 

Their eventual job and school placement. 

Met nod 

The record of each student in the potential class 
of June 1949 in 13 schools (5,637 students) was studied to 
determine his intelligence level, work habits, personality 
traits, scholastic achievement, and reading ability. These 
were then analyzed to learn which students left school early 
and which remained to graduate. Records of transferees were 
followed through to learn their ultimate destination. 

1,538 boys and girls applying for employment certificates 
were interviewed in employment certificating offices to 
learn reasons for leaving school, their job placement, and 
parents* attitude toward their leaving.

3,155 post-card questionnaires were sent to drop¬ 
outs in the class of June, 1949. Twenty-four per cent 
were returned. Again, the intent was to learn the student’s 
opinion of the guidance received, and his job progress. 

Findings 

The findings indicated that drop-outs as a group had 
less job satisfaction than graduates, that they changed 
jobs often, received lower salaries, and were less likely 
to be in jobs related to their school training than graduates. 
Their reasons for leaving jobs were similar to those for 
leaving school: restlessness, lack of perseverance and 
intense interest, and poor habits—all of which have 
implications for the modification of educational and 
guidance services. 


EVALUATION 

The triple attack through school records, interviews, 
and questionnaires constitutes a sound approach. These 
three devices should certainly obtain excellent data upon 
which to basetentative findings and conclusions. They 
may be used also for purposes of validating the evidence 
gathered by other techniques. 

In most respects their findings support those of 
Dillon, and McCreary and Kitoh.

XL FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGH SCHOOL ATTENDANCE 16 
Background 

The authors tested the association of eight independent 
variables with the dependent variable—school attendance of 
16 to 17-year-old farm youth. County figures were used. 

Findings 

Five factors were found to be significantly correlated 
with school attendance; 

Number of milk cows per farm, r of minus 0.240 — Approx¬ 
imately 6 per cent of the variance in school attendance among 
counties can be explained by this measure. This suggests 
the greater the number of milk cows per farm, the lower the 
school attendance. 

Nationality background, r of minus 0.595 — The heavier 
the proportion of German, Polish, Belgian and Swiss, the 
lower the school attendance. About 35 per cent of the variance 
was explained by this factor. 

Public transportation costs per pupil, r of plus 0.408 — 
This explains about 17 per cent of the variance. The greater 
the amount spent per pupil for attendance, the greater the 
attendance.

Enrolment in high schools having less than 100 pupils, 
r of plus 0.286 — This factor explains slightly over 
8 per cent of variance. The greater the proportion enrolled 
in small schools, the higher the school attendance. 

Enrolment in elementary, parochial and private schools, 
r of minus 0.229 -— This accounts for 5 per cent of variance. 
The greater the proportion of the elementary school enrolment 
in private and parochial schools, the lower the high school 
attendance of farm youth. 

EVALUATION 

It must he remembered that in communities which are 
in any way different from the ones in this study, these 
factors might be less significant or might be entirely 
absent.

CHAPTER X 


OPINIONS OF ACTUAL DROP OUTS 

This chapter reviews that kind of research which obtained 
information from drop-outs themselves. In general, these studies 
attempt to gather evidence which would help to evaluate the train¬ 
ing and school experiences of those who left before graduation. 

It is felt that such information, along with their post-school 
work experiences, would disclose weaknesses in school offerings. 

In addition, the investigators felt that certain pertinent data 
regarding their social and family background might reveal reasons 
for the drop-outs* inability or reluctance to complete their high 
school courses. 

Such studies are worthwhile even though they do not answer 
the question of why youth leave school before graduation. Like any 
manufacturer of consumer products, the educational systems need to 
ask the people who use their schools how they feel about them. 

I. MAT HAVE OUR DROP-OUTS LEARNED? 

Background 

Charles M, Allen, of the College of Education, University of 
Illinois, conducted this study^ in twenty-two four-year senior high 
schools in the state of Illinois.

In particular the investigator wished to find the answer to 
a question of major significance to guidance planning: Had the 
students who withdrew been assured by the school that they were doing 
well or had they been labelled with the stamp of failure? 

Method 

The questionnaire and the interview techniques were used to 
obtain the data in this study, 

Findings 

This Illinois study by Allen shows wide variation among 
schools in one state. For example, one of the schools in the study 
reported that 7 students had dropped out for each 10 who had reached 
the twelfth grade while the school with the lowest rate of elimina¬ 
tion had lost only one student for each 10 who had become seniors, 
Allen found enough similar cases for two basic conclusions: 

1. The number of drop-outs in many schools is sufficiently 
large to warrant that the needs of these pupils be taken into 
account in improving the school*s program. 

2. The variation in the proportion of drop-outs from school 
to school is so great that each school must study its own holding 
power. 

The data obtained from the drop-outs and summarized below 
should be read keeping in mind the major hypotheses of Allen*s re¬ 
search, and the fact that the most common label of success or failure 
is subject marks, 

1. (a) Eighty percent of boys and 66 percent of girls who 

withdrew got less than average marks.

(b) Only one percent of boys and four percent of girls 
had marks above average. 

2. (a) If these drop-outs had graduated, 8 I 4 . percent of the 
boys and 71 percent of the girls would have been in the bottom 
quarter of the graduating class. 

(b) Only one percent of the boys and three percent of 
the girls would have ranked in the upper quarter. 

3. Half of the boys and one-third of the girls who with¬ 
drew had received failing marks in their first semester - a 
distressing first experience with the high school. 

ii. (a) About one third of the drop-outs were of normal 
age (13 years eight months, to lh years 7 months) when they 
entered ninth grade. 

(b) Of the remainder, among the boys, 53 percent were 
over-^age; only I 4 . percent were below normal age. 

(c) Among the girls, Ul percent were over-age and 7 
percent were under-age. 

The major factor in this over-age group must have been the re¬ 
peating of one or more grades in the elementary school. 

5* Most of them were of sufficiently high intelligence to do 
high school work, although most were in the below average range. 

6 . Fathers of 69 percent of the boys, and of 75 percent of 
the girls, were skilled, semi-skilled, or unskilled laborers. Many 
schools are organized to best serve the needs of middle class families. 

7. Allen*s major finding appears to be that a large pro¬ 
portion of the youth who withdraw had been labelled as failures in 
the chief enterprise of the school - the activity that is built

around the classroom 


8. Tyro main implications arise from this study for those 
planning guidance programs: 

(1) The potential drop-out should be discovered and pro¬ 
vided with counseling before he leaves school. 

(2) Those planning guidance programs must join the others 
to provide potential school leavers with in-school learning ex¬ 
periences which they will accept as meeting their needs. 

Evaluation 

It would appear that Allen has been able to establish that, 
in the large four-year senior high schools at least, there might 
be a tendency to label students of lower academic ability as 
failures. When this situation develops, these students tend to 
become chronic failures and finally withdraw. Whatever the school*s 
failure in teaching these former students, Allen has shown that it 
has taught them one lesson very effectively: that school is not 
for them. That they have learned their lesson well is demonstrated 
by one convincing fact - they are no longer in school. 

II. WHY PUPILS LEAVE SCHOOL 
Background 

Mr. George Melcher, Superintendent Emeritus, Kansas City 
Schools, obtained information directly from drop-outs in order to 


2. Melcher, George, Why Pupils Leave School, The Kansas City Schools , 
Missouri, 19k5>. 












find out just what they thought about education, whether they were 
happy when in school, if they had participated in extra-curricular 
activities, what their experiences had been since leaving school, 
and thether they thought other young people should finish their 
high school course* 

Except for those transferring to other schools, all the pupils 
leaving Paseo, Northeast, and Manual high schools during 19i*3-Uh 
and not returning in September, 195U> were listed and sent a letter 
asking for confidential information. Of the total sample of 38 U 
drop-outs, 2h2 were boys, and 1U2 were girls. 

Method 

This study was primarily based on the questionnaire. Adequate 
data were received from 119 of the 38 I 4 . members in the sample. Mail 
addresses could not be found for 52; phone calls accounted for 88 
of those not returning the questionnaire, and 125 did not choose to 
answer. 

Findings 

1. These early school leavers who responded were successful 
on their job in terms of tenure and salary. Three-quarters had only 
one or two jobs since leaving school. One-fourth began work at $30.00 
or more per week; one-half at $2^.00 or more per week; and three- 
fourths at $15.00 or more per week. One-fourth of the girls began 

at $20.00 or more per week; one-half at $18.00 or more per week; and 
three-fourths at $15.00 or more per week. The high level of employ¬ 
ment in 1 9kb must be borne in mind in evaluating these findings. 

2. Most of these people were happy in their work. Twenty

percent of the boys and fifteen percent of the girls said they liked 
their jobs because of the "chance to learn", yet they left school* 

3* The following reasons for leaving were given by these 
youths, one and a half years after they had left: 


Boys: 1* enter armed services 2h 

2. poor health 13 

3* because of teachers or administration 15 

U* did not like school 25 

5* failing grades 10 

6. to take jobs 20 

7# independence, money 9 

8. to help support family 8 

9* because fattier died 3 

10. because of illness at hone 3 

11. because of unfriendly, snobbish students k 

12. home problems 3 

13* bad eyesight 2 

llj.. marriage 9 


In summary, 73 students left for reasons which are the responsibility 
of the school. In nine cases the element of frustration and a lack 
of adjustment is evident. The emotional factor is important so that the 
need for more constructive guidance would be indicated. 

Four noteworthy facts explain these students* dislike of school, 
as reported by them: 

1. Dislike for school begins early, mostly in the upper elementary 
grades. 

2. Main causes of dislike are teachers and subjects. 

3. Main criticisms are of teachers, courses, methods, and school 
system. 

U. Nevertheless, the drop-outs urged others to finish high school. 

In answer to how the schools could be more helpful to its students, 
the following ten suggestions were made by the drop-outs: 

1. Employ younger, better, happier teachers, who are understand-

Teaching self-reliance and placing responsibility on 

the pupils. 

6. Omitting useless material and making courses more

7. Helping pupils get acquainted and teaching them how to 
make friends. 

8. More thorough work and more review. 

9. Using testbooks more and library less. 

10. By making work easier and giving less homework* 

Evaluation 

The study is interesting and insightful but cannot claim any 
degree of validity because less than half of the sample responded. The 
respondents appear to be adjusted in their jobs and satisfied in general. 
There is some likelihood that those who did not reply are not happy in 
their work and chose not to answer, so that the data Melcher obtained 
cannot be taken as evidence for all those who dropped out. 

On the other hand, the replies from the three different school 
groups were so nearly indent!cal in content that it could be taken to 
mean that the answers have a good deal of reliability. This apparent 
reliability, however, is weakened by evasions, and rationalizations. 

The list of suggestions offered by the drop-outs would appear to 
indicate that these two escape mechanisms are significantly operative 









in this study. 

III. SYRACUSE YOUTH 1HO DID NOT GRADUATE 
Background 

This research presents a study^ of youth who withdrew from the 
schools of Syracuse, New York, during the years 19U6-19k9* before 
high school graduation. The research division of the city*s Board 
of Education conducted the investigation under the direction of 
Harry P. Smith 0 

A total of I 4.62 early school leavers were selected .fo** the 
sample, of which 19k were actually used in the study. 

Method 

The interview was used to obtain information. To assure 
uniformity in getting the data, interview forms were carefully pre¬ 
pared, with precise directions to the interviewers. Counselors, 
vice-principals, visiting teachers, and attendance officers, were 
interviewers. All these people were very experienced and had a 
high understanding of school conditions. In addition, all had much 
experience with lower socio-economic groups. 

For the initial sample, all those who dropped out from grades 
VII to XII during the fall semester of 19k5>-19k6, and six subsequent 
semesters, were included. This number was so large that a sampling 
was necessary. The drop-outs were arranged alphabetically by years

or by classes* Each fifth name was chosen for the sample and each 
sixth was chosen as an alternative. This method insured that all 
socio-economic and racial groups would be sampled in about the 
proportion that their children withdrew. 

Forty-two percent, or 19U of the 1|62 selected were interviewed. 
Seme could not be located while others were not available during 
the hours when the interviewers could contact them. Of the 19U* 99 
were boys and 95 were girls. 


Findings 


1. The median age of the drop-outs at the time of the study 


was 19 years. 

2. The median grade completed was ten. 


3. The employment situation of these out of school youth 


was as follows: 


(a) Boys: working for employer 

looking for work 
idle but not looking for work 
in services 
ran own business 


76 percent 
11 percent 
8 percent 
k percent 
1 percent 


(b) Girls: employed

idle but not looking for work 
looking for work 
had own business 
did not report 


55 percent 
22 percent 
10 percent 
8 percent 
k percent 
1 percent 


h • Eighty percent of the drop-outs were born in Syracuse with 


the majority living with their parents. 


5« These people were representative of major occupational 
groups. The proportion of drop-outs from families of craftsmen, fore¬ 
men, factory workers, etc., was greater than the ratio of that group 


to the total labor force

(a) 

Dissatisfaction with school.

Illness. 


(e) 

Feeling of being too poor in comparison with 


other pupils. 


9. The majority of families did not approve of their children 


leaving school. About one-half the leavers consulted school personnel, 
-which one-fifth consulted no one. 

10. One-third of the drop-outs said nothing would have induced 
them to remain in school. The following factors might have induced 
others to remains 

(a) Different subjects and courses. 

(b) Better financial condition of family. 

(c) More passing school grades. 

(d) Better family situations. 

(e) Better teachers and teaching. 

(f) More guidance. 

More than half said if they could do it again, they would stay 


longer

11 . Scholastic test records were available for 107 cases. 

More than half of these were able to do secondary work as it was 
then organized. With some adaptation of curriculum and teaching 
methods, nearly all could have achieved success. 

12. Scholastic records of the 183 interviewed showed that 
£6 percent of the boys, and 63 percent girls had averaged above 
the minium passing point for the entire secondary courses. 

13. There were many individual failures. 

111.. In help with vocational planning and preparation, the 
school ranked third behind parents and friends. The drop-outs 
asked parents and friends about jobs before they asked school 
officials. 

15. Subjects found most helpful while in school were: 

(a) Boys: Mathematics, English, and shop, the 
latter including mechanical drawing and science. 

(b) Girls: English, mathematics, and Commercial. 

Evaluation 

Smith feels that the usual objections to the interview were 
overcome in his study because of carefully prepared interview forms, 
and of precise instructions to the interviewers. Even so, with four 
different dategories of officials interviewing these students, it 
is very likely that all four would receive widely varying responses 
from ary one client. 

Choosing every fifth name from an alphabetically arranged list 
of names does not ensure that all socio-economic groups and racial 
groups would be sampled in about the proportion that the children 
withdrew. The names of most national groups, particularly those of

European background, would be grouped together* Smith might have 
been more successful with a table of random numbers* 

In spite of the limitations indicated, the Syracuse study is 
worthy of close inspect on by any group concerned with the problem 
of school mortality rates. The research group used great care to 
gather as much data as possible, to develop justifiable, tentative 
conclusions based on these data, and to present their findings in 
a scholarly, sequential manner. 

IV. DROP-OUT STUDY 
Background 

Mr* Hotchkiss, a member of the Guidance Department of Cortland's 
Board of Education conducted this studjA to determine what the school 
might do to hold students in school longer. 

A total of 2li3 students were found to have left school from the 
Cortland Junior-Senior High School between July 1, and June 30, 1950. 
This total constituted the gross sample. 

Method 

The drop-outs were identified by examinining census cards and 
school registers. They were interviewed according to a prepared 
interview guide. Two interviewers were hired and instructed in the 
objectives of the study and anticipated problems in securing satis¬ 
factory responses to various questions. Practice interviews were 


U* Hotchkiss, Kenneth H*, Drop-Out Study, Cortland, New York, 1950 










organized, then a conference was held to study the results. It was 
felt that the interviewers did an excellent job in locating individuals 
and establishing good relations with them. 

Of the total sample of 243 drop-outs, 158 were located for 
interviews and 9 returned mailed questionnaires, making a total of 
approximately 70 percent from whom responses were received. There was 
a 58 percent response from the total of 117 boys and a 77 percent re¬ 
turn from 126 girls. This difference seems to have resulted largely 
from the military situation at that time. 

Homes of the drop-outs were plotted on a city map. There was no 
really outstanding concentration in any section. The interviewers re¬ 
ported general home conditions. 


Findings 

1. Hotchkiss found no one solient feature accounted for drop¬ 
outs. There appeared to be a pattern of conditions whose cumulative 
effect was to force the conclusion that education frequently fails to 
meet the needs of these youths. The investigator raises the question 
too, whether the school can, or can be expected to overcome environmental 
influences which affect school attendance, 

2. At the same time, Hotchkiss was able to find certain more 
noticeable characteristics of drop-outs. These are; 

1. Failure in school. 

2. Mediocre ability. 

3. Non-participation in school activities. 

4o Poor attendance. 

5. Part-time employment. 

6. Dislike for school. This dislike is more often in 
terms of teachers and subjects, and then other students. 

The incentive and interest for school are lost over a 
period of years and Hotchkiss found that school frustrations 
do much to set the stage for this type of attitude, but the 
lack of strong parental influence cannot be ignored as an 
important determining factor.

3. As a result of these findings the researcher was able to 
list five major possibilities for school action to reduce drop-outs, 

1. Early recognition of potential school leavers. 

2. Greater emphasis on the individual through more 
understanding and more guidance. 

3. Curriculum modification; not just more addition of 
courses, but changes to meet varying needs and interests in subject 
matter. 

U. Better utilization of school activities: participation 
and leadership is limited to the interested and the capable; but a 
sense of achievement, of belonging, is necessary for all. 

5>. Closer co-ordination between the school and other 
community agencies since many factors outside of the school affect 
the careers of the children. 

Evaluation 

The smaller the number of interviewers employed, the more valid 
the findings may be. Much care went into the preparation of interview- 
forms and in the training of the interviewers. However, as in so many 
other studies of this nature, no control group was set up to provide 
a basis for selecting factors which distinguish the leaver from the 
non-leaver. This makes it difficult, if not impossible, to use the 
findings for purposes of prediction.

State Supervisor of Guidance, studied the problem^ in all the grades 
of the junior and senior high schools in the state of Iowa* The 
period May 1 , 1950 to April 30, 195l> was set as the year to be cover¬ 
ed in this investigation. 

Forty-three counties participated, with the sample comprising 
1,328 cases. 

Method 

The committee used the questionaire method. County superinten¬ 
dents asked all city and town superintendents to supply the names of 
drop-outs, and cards were mailed from the county superintendents 
office. County superintendents obtained information on all rural 
children from school superintendents. The questionnaire ?>ras printed 
on a double stamped post card. County superintendents received these 
cards from the chairman. 

Findings 

1. The median age grade of drop-outs was 10.78. 

2. As many as 15*50 per cent dropped out after they had 
reached grade 12. 

3. The median age of drop-out was 17.33 so that some other 
factors than the desire to quit as soon as legally possible must be 
operative. 

U. More boys dropped out of school than did girls. The per¬ 
centages, 55*27 for the boys and UU.13 Tor girls tend to agree with national 
study figures and spot survey figures throughout the nation.

6. The occupations of the drop-outs are largely in the 
semi-skilled and unskilled trades as are their fathers*. 

7. The leading reasons for dropping out as given by the 
drop-outs themselves are listed here in descending order of 
frequency:

6. Health 6

9. Lack of success in school 3 

10. Lid not like school 3 


8. The first four listed constitue 60 per cent of the total 
reasons given by the drop-outs# 

Evaluation 

The findings of this study are not unlike those of other surveys 
of this nature and serve as additional evidence on the subject, ihey 
cannot be regarded as conclusive for the State of lowas as only k3 
counties participated by sending in results, and of these, many of the 
results were incomplete. One county sent in 702 of the 1328 returns 
received. Of these 702, only 9$ were complete. In about 20 per cent 
of the cases, returns showing reasons for drop-outs were reasons 
stated by the school administrators rather than reasons stated by the 
drop-outs.

the Division of Research and Child Accounting, Schenectady, New 
York^ The sample of 352 drop-outs included 228 boys and 12U girls. 
The period covered in the research was the time between September 
1950 and August 1951. 

Method 

The information in this study was obtained from the interview 
files of B.A.Colby, Chairman of the Young Adult Ed cation group in 
Schenectady. All interviews occured at the time when these people 
were leaving school so that Colby was able to obtain data relative 
to drop-outs at the critical point when the students felt they must 
terminate their formal education. 

Findings 

1. About three-quarters of the drop-outs came from families

Sick of School: inability to make personal adjustments, clashes with 
teachers, fear of failure, social disappointments, truancy, outside 
temptations.. 

The high incidence of the first response is evidence of the dif¬ 
ficulty students have of verbalizing reasons for early school leaving, 
especially when they are asked for a primary cause. From this table 
it would appear that 90 percent of the drop-outs leave school because of 
factors and conditions inherent in their school experience, 

k • Most drop-outs have some kind of immediate plan #iich involves 
a job. Some of these jobs are held for only a few days or weeks. Some 
change jobs several times when first out of school. Some quit and just 
drift, living with their parents and having no occupational responsibilites. 

With regard to job placement and job satisfaction, the findings of 
this study are in sharp contrast to those of Ross's investigation^. Ihe 
difference might be explained in terms of the sample; the Shenectady 
study concerned itself with students at the time of leaving while the 
Ross research was a follow-up study, one and a half years after the sub¬ 
jects had left school. 

Evaluation 

The primary weakness lies in the fact that this stucfor covers less 
than half of the boys and girls who dropped out of Shenectady's Public

Schools in 1950-1951• Those who were included cannot be regarded as a 
representative sample. From the data covered, it is impossible to 
specify the status of the drop-out by age groups, sex, grade level, or 
any other characteristics* The study does point up the significance 
of a stable home as a factor of school retention. 

VII. IOWA LIFE ADJUSIMEWT COMMISSION STUNT 
Background 

In 1950 the Iowa Life Adjustment Commission undertook to ascertain 
■why young people were leaving the secondary schools of Iowa before 
graduation. 

Method 

Interview teams obtained information directly from the drop-outs* 

Findings 

The five principal reasons for dropping out were the following: 

1. Preferred work rather than school. 

2. Needed money to buy clothes and help at home. 

3® Not interested in school-work. 

U. Could not learn and was discouraged. 

5. Was failing and did not want to repeat. 

Since four of the reasons are related to the school, the Commission 

o 

in its report 0 , includes the following five questions: 

1. What are you doing to challenge the five per cent of the pupils 
in your school system who are gifted individuals? 

2. What are you doing to help the handicapped pupil to become 
better adjusted? 

3* Are you educating all youth to meet their imperative needs 
in a democratic society, such as education for family life, consumer

economics, functional citizenship, and human relations? 

U. Have you surveyed the needs and desires of your pupils? 

5. Is the curriculum in your school flexible enough to respond 
to the known needs of the youth who remain in school? 

McNerney feels that the classroom teacher is of vital importance 
to school retention and states that any teacher trained to teach a 
particular subject or a particular age level cannot answer in the 
affirmative to the above questions. McNeraey suggests "that a teacher's 
preparation should be broad enough to permit him to move easily from one 
level of school organization to another, and broad enough so that he can 
at least be an informed point of referral for most student problems 

Evaluation 

It would appear that the Iowa Life Adjustment Commission conduc ted 
an effective research the findings of which add ihrther evidence that 
the school in general sets up the kind of situation TAhich many students 
feel impelled to quit. In addition, this study specifically names the 
untrained teacher as a factor related to early withdrawal. This finding 
is comparable to that found in The Status of the Teaching Profession ^ 
which indicates that lack of teacher selection and the lack of a high 
degree of teacher training could be contributing factors to pupil drop¬ 
out. The recommendations*^ that followed emphasized better methods of

1p 

to education authorities in the final report of the Committee of the 
Canadian Education Association. 

VIII. CAUSES OF HIGH SCHOOL DROP-OUTS 
Background 

In 195>2, Mr. Gushaty, a Master of Education student at the 
University of Alberta, conducted a study into the causes of drop-outs. 
The research included all drop-outs in Grade XT and Grade XII, except 
those in one-room high schools, over the period from 19U7 to 19f>0 in¬ 
clusive . 

The school sample included all the high schools in Southern 
Alberta, from two-room rural high schools to the three largest centres, 
the Alexandra High School in Medicine Hat, the Lethbridge Collegiate 
Institute in Lethbridge, and the Taber High School in Taber. The case 
sample was 503 drop-outs. 

Method 

The investigator used a questionnaire to obtain his informal!on. 
Answers to questions were indicated bywords or phrases, check marks, 
x’s, or by encircling one of a few given letters. 

Bindings 

The three main reasons given by both boys and girls were: 

1. dropped out to look for a job, £2 percent; 

2. dropped out because of curriculum deficiencies, 29 percent; 

3. dropped out because of poor teaching, 28 percent.

Other important reasons for leaving school were poor grades at 
school, given by 20 percent of the sample, and failure in school sub¬ 
jects, 16 percent of the sample. Of the twelve boys who left school 
because of failure in some courses, eleven failed English, three failed 
mathematics courses, two failed social studies, and two failed foreign 
language. Of the five girls who failed courses, four failed EngLish, 
one social studies, and one failed a foreign language. 

Only 10 percent of the sample, 9 boys and 2 girls, left school 
primarily because of financial difficulties. Seven percent left because 
of illness. There were no pupils to whom a high school was not available 
and no pupils left school because parents were not interested in the 
pupils 1 further training. 

Other reasons given by the pupils were: 

1. dropped out because of lack of interest in school work, 22 percent; 

2. dropped out because of the offer of a good job, 9 percent. 

Mr. Gushaty reclassified these reasons to permit a closer com¬ 
parison between the reasons for dropping out as given by school leavers 
in Southern Alberta over the period 19h7 - 19?0, and the reasons given 
for the whole of Canada as presented by the 19^8 study. Tour Child Leaves 
School , by the Canadian Research Committee on Practical Education, p. 19* 

This classification attempted to show reasons relating to such sources 

of influence upon the individual as the school and tie home. 

A. Reasons relating to the school . 

1. Unsuitability of the curriculum - not getting what was wanted, 
courses unrelated to vocational plan, weak student activity program, 
enrolled in a technical school. 

2. Lack of ability - low grades, failed some subjects. 

3. Lack of ability - no interest in school, friends did not 


go to school

B. Economic Reasons 


1. Besire to earn money - left to look for a job. 

2. Family income - financial difficulties, brother or sister in 
school and both could not go; could not dress as well as others. 

3. Needed at home. 

C. Personal Reasons 

1. Opportunity for position - a good job offered. 

2. Illness. 

3. Others - marriage or plans for marriage. 

Seventy-three percent of the boys and fifty-eight percent of 

the girls gave unsuitability of curriculum. Lack of ability was given 
by U5 percent of the boys and 2k percent of the girls, while in the 
economic reasons, the desire to earn money was listed by 60 percent of 
the boys and k2 percent of the girls. 

It is apparent then, that the reasons relating to the school are 
the most important and are more frequent among the boys than the girls. 
Economic reasons are second in importance and also more frequent among 
boys. Personal reasons for dropping out are least important, and more 
frequent among girls. 

The investigator found that most of the drop-outs stayed in school 
as long as they did because it trained them for a job or because they 
liked to attend. They recommended debating and speech training, journa¬ 
lism, hobbycraft, student government, and religion as worthwhile extra¬ 
curricular activities. 

A high percentage of the drop-outs changed their vocational plans 
during their high school careers. All the changes were frcm matricula¬ 
tion over to technical or conmercial programs. In these areas they found 
a lack of suitable courses. Since the curriculum was not suited to their

needs, they lost interest in their school work, received low or 
failing marks, and eventually left school to earn their own living* 

Evaluation 

The reasons given for early school leaving are consistent with 
other data of this study and are comparable to the reasons given in the 
study by the Canadian Research Council on Practical Education* While 
this comparison is interesting, it cannot be regarded as an indication 
of validity since neither sample is representative of the population 
from which they were chosen. In the Gushaty sample, approximately 20 
percent of the 503 returned the questionnaire* In some cases every 
question was not answered fully* All answers were opinions or rationali¬ 
zations. In the case of the interviews, since the interviewer was a 
teacher, some of those interviewed did not discuss the problem freely* 
However, the responses are useful because they represent actual state¬ 
ments of the drop-outs and throw some light on the problem in the 
schools*

CHAPTER X Continued 


This chapter reviews research which, in addition to the 
opinions of drop-outs themselves, includes that of other persons 
concerned with education* Among these are parents, churchmen, 
guidance personnel, teachers, graduates, and employers. These 
studies present a much fuller composite picture than do those which 
concern themselves with only the opinions of those who actually drop 
out of school* 

I. NOW HEAR YOUTH 1 
Background 

This report summarizes the California Co-operative Study of 
School E>rop-Outs and Graduates, which included 28 different projects 
involving 73 secondary schools. These investigations were conducted 
in various parts of the state, most of them during the 195>0-195>1 school 
year. 

The sample of 13*000 former students of high schools and junior 
colleges are geographically representative of the state as they include 
people from rural, suburban, and urban schools, and from small, medium, 
and large schools. They are not, however, representative of the total 
population as the sample was not scientifically selected.

The San Diego study was begun in I 9 I 4 O wife a total of 2132 
pupils# Detailed information from school records were used; promo¬ 
tions, transfers, and withdrawals were verified# Excluding transfers, 
1)403 students were promoted to grade seven and they comprised the study 
group # 

In addition to the analysis of school records, interviews with 
parents and drop-outs were carried out. Questionnaire-type guides were 
prepared to assist in the interview situations# Studies in Los Angeles, 
Stockton, and San Francisco used the same methods* 

In Contra Costa, Dr. San do of the Los Angeles State College 
interviewed the first 100 sophomores to withdraw during 19)46 from the 
high schools of the Contra Costa County# They vsere all interviewed 
within a wedc after they had left school. Ihe parents of the se students 
were also interviewed. 

At the same time, 100 sophomores who remained in school were inter¬ 
viewed. This group was matched as closely as possible in terms of 
school attended, sex, socio-economic status, and rate of promotion. 

Both groups were later matched for intelligence and no significant 
difference was found. The parents of the group that remained in school 
were also interviewed. 

Findings 

Ihy do boys and girls quit school? The following primary reasons 


are based on £00 responses: 

1. Dissatisfaction with school. 5l% 

2. Marriage . 25$ 

3. Financial.13$ 

lw Enter armed forces ............. 5%

It is difficult to know -whether marriage is rightly a cause 
or a result. 

The danger signals prior to school withdrawal were found to 

be: 

1. Frequent failure, 

2. Retardation, 

3. Excessive absences, 

iu Little or no participation in school activities, 

5. Lack of friends. 

The conmon patterns are similar to those found by hie National 
Education Association^ and the Child Labor Committee^. 

1. Three out of four were between 16 and 17 years of age. 

2. Many dropped out in grade nine. 

3* Between 10 percent and 15 percent dropped out before age 16. 

k . About 20 percent gave up during the senior year. 

The following factors were found to be related to school, with¬ 
drawal : 

Intelligence : Results of this part of the study parallel those 
of Dr. Dillon^ who found that h.0% of 1081* school leavers had I.Q.'s of 
95 or higher. McCreary and Kitch found that of 1500 drop-outs in 
San Diego, bp% were of average I.Q. (90-110 ); 3h% were below average, 
12$ above average, and lAx% had no recorded test scores. 

Their Jobs : Four times as many drop-outs as graduates were unem¬ 
ployed and seeking work. Graduates found and kept better jobs.

Courses Taken : This study does not bear out the claim that 
rate of withdrawal can be reduced by shifting potential drop-outs 
from college preparatory to other types of courses. In a sample of 
119 school leavers, 70 percent were enrolled in business, industrial, 
homemaking and related courses. 17 percent were in college preparatory 
courses, and 13 percent in general courses. In addition to a broad 
offering of courses, holding power evidently depends upon content, 
teaching methods, and other favorable conditions. 

Occupation and Education of Parents : Sixty-two percent of the 
parents of drop-outs in San Diego were unskilled or semi-skilled 
workers; 24 percent were skilled workers, and only 5 percent were 
professional workers. Fathers usually had less education than mothers. 

Size of Family : Little apparent relation was found here. One- 
half of the school leavers were from families of one to three children, 
and half were from larger families. 

Attitude of Parents : 

A. 1. Half of the parents disapproved of their children 

quitting school. 

2. One-quarter approved. 

3. One-seventh consented but did not approve. 

4. Other parents were not consulted. 

B. 1. Fifty-eight percent of the drop-outs made the decision 

to withdraw before seeking parental approval. 

2. In one-tenth of the cases, the decision to withdraw was 
the result of a talk with the parents. 

3. In one-seventh of the cases - result of pupil-school 
consultation. 

4. In one-eighth of the cases - result of pupil-parent 


consultation

McCreary and Kitch conclude, "Apparently it is not a common 
practice for drop-outs to talk it over with the school people before 
or as they leave 

Benefits from School : 

1 . Reading - Only three out of ten felt they had all tie 
training they needed as compared with seven out of ten 
graduates. 

2. English - two out of ten drop-outs and six of ten graduates 
felt their needs were met. 

3. Ma.'thematics - two out of ten drop-outs and six of ten 
graduates said that they had enough training for everyday 
living. Others felt they needed more for "home" and "store". 

U* Speaking - one-quarter of drop-outs aid more than one-half 
of graduates felt they had aH the training they needed. 

Many felt that inability to speak easily and well with their 
associates to be a definite handicap. 

McCreaiy and Kitch reviewed the woik of Or. R. E. Sando of the Los 
Angeles State College, entitled the "Contra Costa Study". The problem 
in this study was, "Yilhat distinguishes the drop-out from the non-leaver 
in his thinking and feeling about school?" His findings are worthy of 
record in this study. 

1. Social Relationships : The drop-outs felt more poorly treated 
by teachers and by other students. They were more critical of discipli¬ 
nary action and of teachers’ personal knowledge of and interest in them

as individuals. This feeling is consistent "throughout the drop-out 
group and existed in the same degree regardless of sex, rate of pro¬ 
motion, I.Q,, or socio-economic level. One-third of the drop-outs 
cited unreasonable, inconsistent discipline» 

2. Personal Interest ; One of the most revealing questions was, 

“How many of your teachers seem really to care about you as a person 
who needs individual understanding and attention?” “Few,” “none”, “one”, 
were typical answers from drop-outs. Thus the drop-outs were rejected 
by both teachers and students. Both parents and drop-outs stated the 
latter badly wanted help but were afraid to ask for it. 

3* Attitude of Parents : Many parents were unaware of tie problems 
children faced at school. The real problems were in the minds of the 
children but were not discussed with the parents. This is significantly 
different with the non-leavers. 

Iw Curricular Practices : Crop-outs reported they had gotten less 
from school, found subjects less useful, were more dissatisfied with 
variety of subjects, and learned less, received less help from teachers, 
were more dissatisfied with teachers’ methods, had too much work to do, 
did less homework, and had spent less time on homework than non-leavers. 
With few exceptions, these differences existed regardless of sex, rate 
of promotion, I.Q., or socio-economic status. 

5* Bxtracurricular Activities : There were no significant dif¬ 
ferences. Both groups expressed a marked degree of dissatisfaction 
with student activity programs. Fifty-six drop-outs and forty-five 
non-leavers felt that they did not take part in activities as much as 
they thought they should. As reasons, 11 said they were too shy; 15 
were not interested in the activities offered; 15 said they were not

in r, the gang", 9 had grades which were too low. Parents voiced the 
same feelings. All pointed out the high cost of school parties, dances, 
plays, and athletic contests. 

6 . ~What Can Be Done ? "For the most part, drop-outs are boys and 
girls in difficulty, dissatisfied, unhappy, unsuccessful, alone. Vi/hat 
can be done to help them?"^ In the light of the above findings. Dr, 
Sando outlines the following proposals: 

1 . Give greater attention to the task of understanding today's 
teen-agers and their problems, their need for status and social accep¬ 
tance with other boys and girls. 

2 . Make school discipline more consistent. Biop-outs complained 
about inconsistency among the teachers, and about inconsistency in the 
same teacher from day to day. 

3 . Show the students that the faculty is sincerely interested 
in them as individuals. 

lu Make the subject matter as real and meaningful to boys an} 
girls as possible. Content of courses and methods may need to be 

SB |j|§j 

changed. Field trips and work experiences are necessary, 

5. Revamp the extracurricular activity program so that it will 
appeal to more students. They should be gauged to various social and 
cultural groups in school. The costs should be kept as low as possible. 

7. Identifying Drop-Outs : The process begins in the elementary 
grades as identification should give time for remedial procedures. 
Riverside County selected a small number of students who displayed

"drop-out symptoms" and provided them with special counseling ser¬ 
vices. Low grades, retardation, excessive absences, non-participation 
in school activities, low test scores, and lack of interest in school 
were signs used to identity potential leavers. 

In addition, a "drop-out score-card" can be devised by systems 
studying school withdrawals. 

Luring interviews, Lr. Sando noted Ume after time ihat certain 
questions elicited critical reactions or attitudes that seemed to 
distinguish the drop-out. Perfection of an instrument that would 
reveal these less tangible signs of a desire to leave school prema¬ 
turely would be a significant contribution to the improvement of 
education. 

Bvaluation 

These studies by the California State Department of Education 
have made two valuable contributions to education: 

1. They have demonstrated the need for continuous research 
on drop-outs; 

2 . The studies reveal how subtle are seme of the underlying 
causes of early withdrawal from school and how decisive are young 
people’s feelings about their personal and social re3a Hons with 
teachers and pupils. 

Interviewing students right after they leave school is sound 
technique because the forces acting upon them in the direction Qf 
withdrawal are then painfully apparent to them. While they cannot 
always recognize these forces, or combination of forces, they never¬ 
theless feel them keenly and are able to verbalize them adequately 
enough. On the other hand, a lapse of time may make a per sen more 
objective, but it may be a selective type of objectivity based on the 
individual’s degree of success or failure in his post-school work

experience. 

Sanders interview with the parents as a validity check appears 
to have been successful in view of the fact that there was a hig£i 
degree of similarity in the responses of the childroi and parents. 

XI. SPECIAL SERVICES FOR THE DROP-OUT'? 

Background 

As divisional director of the Department of Guidance and Place¬ 
ment of the Detroit Public Schools, Warren K. Layton organized a 
city-wide drop-out study to check on reasons for vdthdrawal, to note 
characteristics of drop-outs, and to examine significant relationships 
which appear to exist among various factors associated with the drop¬ 
out problem. 

The sample constituted individuals who voluntarily withdrew 

from the Detroit secondary schools in 1950-1951* 

Method 

The findings of this study are based on an examination of school 
records and interviews of drop-outs and their parents. 

Finding s 

The typical drop-out had the follcwirg characteristics: 

Age: 16 to 17 years. 

Sex: Either, but there were slightly more boys than girls. 

Grade: Tenth to eleventh. 

Nationality: Citizen by birth. 

Home Language: English. 

Family Background: Good.

Economic Status: Probably average or a little better than 
average• 

Educational standards: Drop-out pattern already established in 
family. 

Social relationships: Not very favorable - little participation 
in activities. 

Scholastic aptitude: Slightly below average. 

School citizenship: Probably about average or below average. 

Progress in school: Not favorable - much failure in both 
elementary and high school. 

Hie findings of this study* with regard to family background and 
economic status are opposed to those of Hollingshead^ who found socio¬ 
economic status and class structure vital factors in early school 
leaving. 

The principal reasons for leaving as stated by the student 
were: prefer to work, dislike school, have lost interest in school. 

Parents gave as their most frequent reasons the same two that 
were given as first and second by the students, but their third most 
frequent reason was financial need at heme. 

The three most frequently cited reasons given by the high school 
principals were: 

loss of interest in school, 

financial need at home, 

emotional disturbance owing to home conditions. 

Analysis of all the reasons cited showed that the three classes of 
persons quoted disagreed about 19% of the reasons, two of them agreed 
about 37% and all three agreed about kk%; thus there was partial or total 
agreement about 81$ of the reasons for dropping out of school.

Evaluation 

This report is valuable because of its attempt to describe a 
typical drop-out in terms of specific characteristics. Only when dis¬ 
tinguishing and predictive factors are known and recognized in the early 
grades can a positive program be set up to reduce mortality rates to any 
great degree, 

III SECONDARY AND POST SECONDARY EDUCATION CONTINUATION 9 
Background 

John W. Berry, Professor of Sociology in Eureka College, had 
three major aims in his rural county study in 1940; 

1. To estimate the degree of educational continuation during 
and following the secondary level; 

2. To discover and measure whatever differentiation of 
continuation exists within the County; 

3* To develop some understanding of factors basic in producing 
such differentiations* 

One hundred and ninety-three students, comprising the total gra¬ 
duating class for 1940, made up the sample* They represented nine 
four-year secondary schools of Woodford County* 

Method 

Data about the students are obtained by examining school records, 
and by interviewing the subjects themselves, their parents, school 
officials, and church leaders* The interviews were conducted by 
seniors majoring in Sociology in Eureka College*

Findings 

The variation of the class of 1940 from the class of 1937 to 
1939 is noted under five categories: 

The Extent of Post-Secondary Education Continuation - Of 193 
students 47, or 24.4$, continued at college level and 25, or 12.9$, at 
vocational levels, 72, or 37*3$ continuing at all levels. 

Female continuation was found to be higher than for males, beir^ 
much greater at vocational, but less at college level* 

The Influence of Age - Age has been seen as mainly of influence 
among older females and of slight importance to all other groups. 

Eight female graduates age 19 years or over were all drop-outs, whereas 

11 of 14, or 79$ of those age 17 years or less were continuants. 

Age has little significance for males. Of 15 males aged 17 years 

or less, 33$ continued and of 14 males aged 19 years or over 28$ con¬ 

tinued. 

The Influence of Parental Occupation - Of the 168 cases whose 
parental occupation was known, 40$ were of farming background. 

The Influence of Academic Achievement - The class of 1940 reveals 
the same tendencies in grade levels as in the years 1937-1939. 

Other Factors Affecting the Class of 1940 - Factors such as much 
improved economic conditions, anticipation of selective service and 
other war influences were not operative for preceding classes. The 
major effect appears to have been to increase male college continuation 
and to switch females from college to vocational schools, especially to 
training for nursing. Despite these influences the class of 1940 follows 
closely the pattern of the earlier graduates as to the influence of the 
four factors briefly reviewed above*

Evaluati on 


The original data on which this analysis and its conclusions 
are based have reference only to Woodford County and within the period 
studied, 193h to 19h0. To some extent the area might be termed 
somewhat typical of rural Illinois. The County is characteristically 
rural in its nearly complete dependence on agriculture, and. the 
cessation, since 1900 , of population growth. On the ob ho* hand 
the County is sharply disb inguidied by having a large population 
of close affiliation with European Protestant churches traditionally 
opposed to secondary education. Any adverse influence these ethnic 
groups, along vdth other differentiating factors may have on educational 
continuation lessens any rural typicality Woodford County m^y possess 
and confines valid comparison to similar areas. 

The study does contribute to knowledge of rural educational con¬ 
tinuation. The findings of this stuc^y may also be profitably used as 
a basis for comparison with similar post-war investigations. 

IV. GUIDANCE FACULTY STUDY OF STUDENT WITHDRAWALS 10 

Background 

Under the organization and direction of Armand Lanier, the 
guidance department and the faculty of the Austin High School in Texas 
surveyed the problem of early school leaving. The year under study was 
19 i* 8 . The sample of 135 drop-outs for the year represented 5*2 percent 
of the high school population. Of this number, 6k percent vrere boys and 
36 percent were girls.

Method 


Lanier used two broad methods: 

1* A statistical approach using such objective data as age, sex, 
classification, nationality, course of study, teachers, family information, 
address, and test scores, 

2. A case-study approach combining information from the counselor's 
personal interview with the student at the time of dropping out, with 
written and oral teacher reports, with infornation from confidential 
folders, health information from the nurse, and reports from the dean's 
and attendance offices. 

Lanier's definition of a "drop-out" is worthy of summary here. 

He describes the early school leaver as one who terminates his schooling 
for that semester of his own volition. Not included were those who 
moved to other towns with their families, tubercular cases compelled to 
leave, students suffering incapacitating injuries, or a veteran who 
learned he could graduate in ni^it school in the same length of time. 


Findings 


In this high school study in Austin, Texas, Lanier found certain 
descriptive factors among withdrawing students. They are listed here 
in approximate order of incidence. 


1 . broken home 


6 . discouragement over academic progress 


2 . student in financial need 


7 . feeling of not belonging 


3 . student has been wo iking 
ii. family in financial need 
5 . significantly low test scores 


8 . sickness in family 


severe personal maladjustment

In this sanple, 60 percent of the cases were from broken homes* 

Lanier found seven common characteristics in the total Austin 
drop-out population* 

1* Lower mean I.Q. score than for any trade school or high 
school grade. 

2. Significantly lower "language” I.Q. than "non-language". 

3* Significantly lower reading achievement scores than those 
of a sample of non-withdrawals. 

iw L ower correlation between reading and I.Q. than -that of a 
non-random sample matched by I.Q. 

5>. Lower reading achievement scores than those of a sample of 
non-leavers matched by I.Q. 

6. Significantly more broken homes than for students (matched 
for I.Q.) who graduated. 

7. Significantly more drop-out students lived in a section of 
the city characterized by low incomes. 

A cross-section of the drop-outs were interviewed at the time 
of leaving. They were found to have the following five common charac¬ 
teristics. 

1. Broken homes 

2. Financial needs of students and family 

3 . Lqw test scores 

ii. Discouragement over academic progress 

5. Feelings of not belonging 

Obviously a multiplicity of factors are operative in influencing 
the schools' mortality rates.

Evaluation 

The two approaches used by Lanier seen to cover the factors 
essential for the study of the situation in one high school. For 
more general applicability, he would reqiire a control group of non¬ 
leavers selected on objective data as listed in his fir st method. He 
would then have had descriptive factors not only for those who left but 
also for those i/ho remained. Such information would probably lead to 
the formulation of factors which would distinguish the two groups and 
make possible a certain degree of prediction. 

V. MAT VACANT HIGH SCHOOL SEAT 11 

This is a sixteen-page report by Delaney, chairman of a special 
committee which spent one year on the problem of why students drop out 
of the high schools of Chicago and what can be done about it. The 
period under study was 191*6 to 1950 with 379 cases in the sample. 

Method 

The four years under study covered the tine from freshman entrance 
to commencement day. Of the 17*592 freshmen, only 10,1*15 merited 
diplomas, \hile 7*177 or i|l percent dropped out. Of this latter group* 
379 were interviewed. 

Talks with parents, teachers, students, and employers constituted 
many phases of the inquiry. 

The age score of the drop-outs showed that 23h were 16 to 17 years 
of age, 115 were 17 to 18, and that 30 were over 18 years old. 

Findings 

Symptoms and Causes - The Committee found the folloving symptoms

and causes operative in early school leaving: 

1. Repeated absence from school, 

2. Hme of dropping out: 

20% left during their freshman year 
h0% left during their second year 
30 % left during their third year 
10% left during their final year 

3. Schools in underprivileged areas. Seventy-three percent 
of the drop-outs were frequently absent or truant prior to leaving. 
City-wide records showed that approximately 35 percent were chronic 
absentees and that over 50 percent had truancy r ecords. 

Ij.. Of the drop-outs interviewed, only 19 percent had a fair 
record of scholarship at leaving; others failed in many or in all 
courses. 

5* Health records showed many cases of faulty vision, hearing 
defects, and other handicaps influencing retardation. 

6. Forty-six percent of those interviewed rated average or 
better on mental tests of ability. Some had definite handicaps, pre¬ 
cluding successful academic work. 

7« Few of the drop-outs participated in extra-curricular activities. 

8. Seeking employment was found to be a negligible factor; ten 
percent did part time daily work and seven percent did work on Saturday. 

9. The home situation was a factor in many cases. Overcrowding, 


broken family ties, guardianship, financial problems, disordered home 
because of working mother were all important influences operating toward 
early school leaving#

10* Frequent absences began to appear in grades k and 5* con¬ 
tinuing through high school. 

11. Most drop-outs were not aware of real causes of dissatisfaction. 

12. Fewer tiian half of the drop-outs had promises of jobs prior 
to leaving. 

13# Many who left because of financial straits at home continued 
their education at nights. 

What Is To Be Done? 

1. There must be a coordinated plan to handle such activities 
as truancy. 

2. In-service guidance training is essential. 

3. The curriculum must be revised. 

Ip. A definite checking-out school plan must be devised. 

Evaluation 

A four year study is much better than a one year study for two 
reasons. First, it is possible to follow a group from year to year and 
make a comparison of the first and fourth year record. Second, it is 
very likely that a four year period would be more typical than a one 
year stucfcr in terns of economy, job opportunity, wages, and school 
courses offered. At the same time it is impossible to generalize his 
findings because of a lack of comparison of the drop-out sample with 
a like group of students who remained in school.

educational program * This statewide follow-up stuc^- involved nearly 
12,000 individuals, including not only former students, but also high 
school principals, college registrars, employers, and staff members of 
the Virginia Consultation Services. In the case of the students, both 
drop-outs and graduates were surveyed, making a total sample of 22,190, 
of whom 9,269 or ij.1.8 percert responded. These cases represent approxi¬ 
mately 5>0 percent of the graduates and 25 percent of the drop-outs to 
whom questionnaires were sent. 

Method 

The following steps outline the method employed in Ihis research: 

1. Questionnaires were sent by high school principals to the 
graduates of the year to be studied, and to those former students who 
during that year had left junior or senior high school without gradua¬ 
ting. 

2. College Success Questionnaires were sent by the principals 
to the colleges entered by former students. 

3. Employer Interview Schedules were designed as an interview 
guide and a confidential summary sheet on which principals would 
record the results of their interviews with representative employers 
of the graduates and drop-outs studied* 

iu Summary Sheets for graduates and drop-outs were prepared 
to record ail findings from the three sources indicated. 

5« Two follow-up questionnaires were employed to obtain the 
highest possible number of responses. 

Finding s 

Training After High School - Of 7,5U9 graduates, 5,829 cr 77*2 
percent had taken or were taking some form of post high school trainirg .

Of these, 90*1 percent were men. Of the 1,720 drop-outs, 711 or Ul*3 
percent had taken or were taking more training. Of the drop-outs, 

5U.2 percent were males* 

Undoubtedly the large number of World War II veterans using 
educational benefits accounts in large measure for a higher than normal 
percentage of former pupils, particularly males, vho have taken advantage 
of post-high school edicational opportunities. A significantly higher 
percentage of graduates than drop-outs have taken training beyond high 
school. 

Employment Status - There were twice as many unemployed drop-outs 
(1*.9$) as there were unemployed graduates {2.2%) at the time of the stuc^y, 
a period of relatively high employment -throughout the nation. The 
unemployment ratio was higher for women whether graduates or drop-outs. 

Occupational Distribution - The two largest groups were (l) Clerical 
and kindred workers and (2) Skilled and semi-skilled workers, comprisiig 
about 53 percent of the leading occupations. The combined professional 
and semi-professional groups are relatively twice as large in the popu¬ 
lation sampled in this study (15^) as in the entire working population 

(7*). 

Service occupations represent about 8 percent of the graduates and 
drop-outs studied and about 11 percent of the entire working population. 
Others included Agriculture, 6 percent, Sales 10 percent. Unskilled labour 
about 5 percent of the sample. 

These comparisons are significant when allowance is made for the 
age level of former students in comparison with the entire working 
population, and for the fact that many persons in tie nationwide labor 
force have had less formal education -than any of the former students 
in the study.

It appears significant that nearly one-fourth of the drop-outs 
felt that they obtained no value from their high school training. 

Helpfulness of Job Information - Approximately half of the 
graduates and drop-outs felt that they did not get any help in this 
area. 

High Sdiool Subjects Most Helpful - Graduates and drop-outs of 
both sexes placed highest value on mathematics and English while women 
of both groups frequently list commercial subjects. Male graduates 
placed high value on natural sciences, and male drop-outs ranked indus¬ 
trial arts near the top. 

Subjects Most Desired if Fpmer Students Could Repeat High School . 

It appears significant that separate lists for male graduates 
and male drop-outs were led by the same six subjects, namely,mathematics, 
business subjects, industrial and trade courses, English, natural sciences, 
and social studies. Female graduates frequently mentioned foreign 
languages, while female drop-outs frequently mentioned mathematics. 


































209 


Employers Interviewed by Piincipals - The majority of the 
employers ranked personal characteristics ahead of trainirg and pre¬ 
vious experience as the most important factors considered in employing 
workers. 

Evaluating the characteristics which they considered most 
desirable in their employees, the employers ranked reliability, co¬ 
operativeness, and truthfulness ahead of ability to use figures 
accurately and rapidly. The aforementioned characteristics were 
ranted ahead of punctuality and courtesy, which in turn preceded ability 
to write plainly. 

The subjects which employers themselves would desire to take if 
they could repeat high school are business subjects, English, mathe¬ 
matics, industrial arts, and self-management, listed in that order. 

Evaluation 

There appears to be evidence that the findings of this study are 
based upon a population sample which is fairly represaitative of the 
entire class of graduates and drop-outs of 1939-19I|D, and that the 
findings may be accepted as a valid basis for conclusions, keeping in 
mind, however, the problem of selective returns. The following criteria 
appear to validate the findings: 

1 . Distribution of Leading Occupations of Eoimer Students 

A Bureau of Census Estimate^ of the distribution of aLl employed 
workers in the nation in January 1 9h9 9 the time of the stuc|r, indicated 
that the two largest occupational groups in the U.S. at that time were 
Skilled and Semiskilled Workers and Clerical and Kindred Workers. In 
this study, 53 percent of the sample represented these groups.

2* Similar Responses from Graduates and Drop-Outs 
An analysis of the data reveals significant similarities between 
responses from graduates and drop-outs where such similarities would 
be expected; that is, where differences in educational background 
would not be expected to be an important factor in the type of responses 
given. For example, the male graduates, the male drop-outs, the female 
graduates, and the female drop-outs, all giving separate responses, 
each ranked social studies and English as two of the three subjects 
which had been most helpful to them in personal ad social life. 

3. Different Responses from Graduates and Drop-Outs 
There were differences between responses from graduates and 
drop-outs where such differences would be expected; that is, where 
differences in educational background may be expected to be an impor¬ 
tant factor in the type of responses given. For example, there was a 
higher employment rate among graduates than among drop-outs* 

4* Similar Responses from Former Students and Employers . 

There is a significant similarity between responses from male 
graduates, male drop-outs, and 1,545 of their employers with reference 
to the high school courses each group would take if they could repeat 
their high school education. 

5* Range of Responses 

The data reveals a wide range of types of responses which 
appears to reflect the cross-sectional character of the group of 
former students responding to the questionnaire. This range reflects 
both the favorable and unfavorable extremes of economic success and 
security, vocational prestige and adjustment, and opinion as to the 
value of high school education.

6. Representative Character of Participating Schools 

Although a hundred high schools in Virginia did not participate, 
analysis of the summary sheets from the 385 schools which did, reveals 
a composite picture which is quite typical of the secondary schools in 
Virginia* 

7# The Sample Population Studied 

The former students, at the time of the study, were no longer 
boys and girls but citizens in their late twenties, many of them 
parents and school patrons. Their employers represented in these find¬ 
ings were mature men and women in positions of responsibility and leadership 
in their respective communities. There is no question that, even with 
all the weaknesses of a questionnaire study, the experience and the 
opinions which these more than ten thousand citizens and taxpayers 
have voiced through this study are of vital interest and concern to 
every educator in Virginia and, by inference, to every educator in 
North America.

VII. EDUCATIONAL NEEDS CF ROCKY ^ 

MOUNTAIN SCHOOL DIVISION 

Background 

A portion of Alfred Deverell*s doctoral dissertation on 
the educational needs of the Rocky Mountain School Division deals 
with drop-outs in that area* In the sample were 167 parents and 
573 children. In the latter group were 381 students, 202 boys and 
179 girls who were still in school, and 192 (105 boys and 87 girls) 
who had recently left school. 

Method 

Mr. Deverell, then superintendent of schools in the unit under 
study, obtained his information through questionnaires to parents and 
students. 

Findings 

The principal causes of school drop-outs as revealed by this 
investigation were: 

1. The economic factor, or inability of rural parents to afford 
the cost of sending their children away from home to attend high school. 

2. Lack of high school facilities within reasonable distance 
of the average rural home. 

3. The purely academic nature of the program of studies 
offered in existing high schools. 

4. Inefficiency in existing rural elementary schools, re¬ 
sulting in abnormally high rate of retardation throughout the school 
system.

Mountain School Division , p. 2

5* The established habits and attitudes of a population 
comprised almost entirely of a single socio-economic group among 
whom education is not valued as highly as it is among workers, in 
the professional, proprietory and managerial, and clerical groups. 

Deverell feels that in the classification of workers in various 
occupations into socio-economic groups, farm owners and tenants should 
be grouped in the vicinity of skilled and semi-skilled laborers, and 
possibly between the two. 

In a study^5 of secondary education of Alberta, Evenson sur¬ 
veyed the Cardston Inspectorate, which like Rocky Mountain, is largely 
a rural division. He found that: 

1. Enrolments in all school grades remain about the same, 
until the end of Grade IX. 

2. The yearly drop-out in the three high school grades 
averaged about 15 percent of the preceding grade*s enrolment. 

3. The greater portion of all students, about 63 percent, in 
grades IX to XII in the Cardston Inspectorate have parents or guardians 
that belong to the Agricultural Service Vocational Group. 

4e Of his total sample of 809 students enrolled in grades IX 

to XII, the grade totals were as follows: 

Grade IX. 265 Grade XI.195 

Grade X. 207 Grade XII.142 

The grade XII enrolment b 45*2 percent less than the enrolment 
of grade IX. Evenson found that 171 parents of the above grade nine 
group were in agriculture, while in grade twelve, the corresponding 
number was only 96. The total number of parents of gradeK students

who were in the business, professional and clerical categories, was 
32; of the grade XII students, 21* Like Deverell, Evenson found that 
children of parents in rural agricultural areas tend to drop out of 
school much more than children from parents in other occupations* 

Evaluation 

The values and the limitations of questionnaire studies 
have been discussed before in this dissertation and will be sum¬ 
marized in a l8ter chapter* Insofar as Deverell deals with early 
school leaving, he, and also Evenson, strongly points to rural agri¬ 
cultural areas as a great challenge to those interested in increasing 
school retention rates* These findings corroborate those of Marshall 


and Peterson in their Minnesota studies

VIII EARLY LEAVING FROM GRAMMAR SCHOOIS 16 
Background 

H Ten Years of Change”' is a report on the changes which have 
taken place in the Education Service in the West Riding, London, 
since the passing of the 1944 Education Act. 

Method 

The Committee on Education, West Riding, investigated the 
causes of early school leaving. 

Finding 

”Many parents will not spare their children 
to learn, if they can but find them any 
employment about their domestick or rural 
affairs, whereby they may save a penny •” 

(Charles Hoole-e.1650) 

It is one of the odd consequences of free Secondary educa¬ 
tion for all that the scramble to enter the Grammar Schools at all 
is almost matched by the scramble to leave them at 15. In the West 
Riding more children leave the Grammar Schools before the end of 
the course and fewer stay on into the sixth form than is typical 
of the country as a whole. 

It was with these facts in mind that the Committee decided 
to take powers under the West Riding Act to impose a penalty on 
parents who broke an agreement to keep their children at school. 
Before invoking these powers, however, they decided to enquire into 
the reasons which led to early leaving. These reasons included the 
demands on girls to work in the home, the financial difficulties of 
maintaining children at school, the earning capacity of the child, 
the attraction of the well-paid job, the desire to get into a job

before being called up for national service, and in some cases 
the apparent reluctance to stay in such schools as were not as good 
as they might be. 

But the Committee realized that a considerable number of 
pupils might be receiving an education unsuited to their abilities 
because of mistakes made in allocation, or of excessive provision 
of Grammar School places, and decided, therefore, that having wrongly 
admitted children to a Grammar School it would be doubly wrong to 
compel them to stay there. They were strengthened in this final de¬ 
cision by the knowledge that the imposition of a penalty finds no 
place in the 1944 Act, and by the belief that no penalty which they 
might have the power to impose would be likely to act as a deterrent 
in these days of high juvenile wages. 

The Committee also conducted a small investigation into the 
reasons why a high proportion of children with good Central Certificates 
do not remain at school for a sixth form course. 

It appears that parents are reluctant to have to feed, clothe, 

V 

and provide entertainment, holiday and pocket money, for a further 
two or even six years; that the earnings of children who have left 
attract those who are wavering; that girls crave the smarter clothes 
which a wage makes possible; that some parents no longer believe that 
the better job will go to the better educated; and that boys are 
overwhelmed by the thought of a University course followed by two years 
of national service. 

Some children apparently have a frank dislike of the thought 
of University or College work; some girls think it will ruin their 
chances of marriage; others resent the discipline of further studies;

and some boys think they can get the best of both worlds by taking 
a job and studying further in the evening. 

Evaluation 

While the article does not indicate the manner in which the 
investigation was conducted, the findings give considerable evidence 
on early school leaving from the grammar schools of West Riding.

CHAPTER XL 


OPINION OF EXPERTS 

Trie vast body of material on early school leaving includes 
numerous contributions -which may rightly be regarded as expressing 
expert opinion. There are three types of study in this area. In 
one instance, an educator may conduct a critical examination of school 
records and in the light of his findings, formulate tentative conclusions, 
implications, and suggestions. In the second case, one might study 
census figures and on the basis of various classifications and 
comparisons, arrive at some conclusions. In both these cases, the 
conclusions are largely opinion because they are based on varying 
methods of classification and factors considered important. The 
third type embraces pure expressions of opinion by educators interested 
in the problem. Since no experimentation, or data of any kind are 
involved, this area of information on early school leaving is least 
reliable. 

I. NINE OUT OF ONE HUNDRED 
Background 

In 19£0-195l, Kansas City had 1,21k drop-outs, excluding 

transfers, deaths, and entrance into the armed services. This 

number constitutes the 9 out of 10 who did not graduate in that 

1 

year, and represents the sample in this study.

Method 


The teachers of the Kansas City Schools analyzed the drop-out 
record of their High school classes in 195>1. The principals indicated 
the reasons for -withdrawal. 

Findings 

1. Table XXV. 


Drop-outs by Grades, with Reasons for Dropping Out 


1* Drop-out by Grades: 


Grade: 9 10 11 12 

Number: 273 3^1 350 230 

2. Reasons for dropping out: 

Reason: Number of cases: 

1. Verified employment . $30 

2. Uninterested, discouraged, or 

lacked suitable employment . 186 

3. Marriage . 130 

U. Physically unfit . 76 

5. Specific reasons not known. 126 

6. Enlistment . 53 

7* 'Whereabouts unknown . 50 

8. Anti-social behavior . Ii6 


2. Through many studies runs the category, "Uninterested in 
school, discouraged by lack of progress, or, no suitable program". 

This squarely challenges the school, for no school wants to be 
responsible for creating discouragement or for inadequate programming. 
The schools must create interest, not necessarily cater to prevailing 


interests. 


































220 


3* Summary of implications: 

There has been no significant decrease in drop-outs in 
the Kansas City Schools in a score of years* 

More boys than girls drop out; more students in grade ten 
and twelve drop out than in other grades. 

Late enrollees in grade nine are more likely to leave 
than early enrollees. 

There needs to be a further investigation of cases 
reported "Physically unfit to attend". 

The number reported as "Whereabouts Unknown" is too 

high. 

Half the withdrawals for anti-social behavior are in 

grade nine. 

Evaluation 

The main contribution of a study of this nature is pointing up 
the gravity of the problem in the area studied. The reasons as listed 
in the study are not true scientific reasons but rather, with the 
exception of numbers four and eight, statements of the drop-outs' post¬ 
school status in the working world. Furthermore, the stated reasons 
are mostly guesses and highly subjective.

children engaged in non-^agricultural employment reflected primarily 

part-time wcrlc, or whether there had been a noticeable increase in 

2 

children leaving school for full-time jobs. This study was conducted 
in 1951 9 with the help of a total sample of 131 superintendents. 

Method 

A questionnaire was sent to school superintendents in 226 cities 
inquiring about the situation in their communities. This included 
practically all cities over 50,000 and a few smaller cities in low 
population states. 

Findings 

1. A general increase in drop-outs was noted. 

2. There was a marked increase among boys. 

3. The increase was most marked in grades ten and eleven. 
h . The increase was most marked for sixteen and seventeen 

year old boys and girls.

they are nevertheless too subjective, and based on evidence -which is 
too general to admit of any generalization. 

III. SUMMER DROP-OUTS INCREASE IN 1950 
Background 

The Minneapolis Public Schools ascertained in the fall of 1950, 
first, who dropped out during the summer, and second, -which of the drop¬ 
outs should be in school. It was found that 683 students failed to 
return in September. Of these, 371 had withdrawn for reasons which 
seemed valid or which were beyond the control of the school. The 
remaining 312 students, however, were out for reasons which seemed 

3 

questionable and which school officials felt required further follow-up. 

Method 

Representatives of each high school P.T.A. met with the Consultant 
in Work Experience and Placement. The follow-^up was discussed and the 
procedure planned. Those students who appeared to be away for inadequate 
reasons were visited by a P.T.A. member, not just as an information 
seeker but in the role of another parent. 

Ihe school clerks prepared a list of all the students over 16 
-who were in school in June but not in September. 

Findings 

1* It was apparent that many boys and girls who were now beyond 
the reach of the school were students who found school an unsatisfactory 
experience.

2. The effects of war seem evidenced in this year's drop-outs 
with hi students in the armed services as compared with 17 in 1950. 

3 . In the questionable drop-outs, the greatest number were 
working, but 19 students were seeking work, many of whom had been 
unemployed since school was out in June. Among the 17 who were 
reported to be at home there were undoubtedly a number who found that 
plan easier than competing for a job. 

U* There was a great disparity among the percentage drop-out 
from school to school, from nearly 8 per cent to about 2% per cent. 

5* There was a marked difference in the drop-out rates for 
boys and girls with 207 boys and l6h girls dropping out for "valid" 
reasons. 

6 . Counselors felt that 2 out of 3 students in the questionable 
group should return to school. Of these 195 students, 97 returned, 
which made exactly 50 per cent of those whom the school felt should 
return. 

7. The percentage loss for 1950 in Minneapolis secondary 
schools was U.57, the lowest in its history. 

Evaluation 

The combined counselor-clerk-P.T.A. efforts in locating and 
contacting these drop-outs has seemed very worth-while. Many of 
the P.T.A. representatives indicated they had learned a great deal 
about the school program. Both P.T.A. and counselors recounted 
incidents where drop-outs or parents had been extremely pleased with 
the school's interest. Certainly, there is a feeling of satisfaction

in knowing that every effort was made to identify and encourage these 
drop-outs who could profit by continued school experience. 

IV. MEETING THE DROP-OUT CHALLENGE 
Background 


Lewis Horowitz, Principal of the Benjamin Franklin High School, 
examined the drop-out situation in the schools of Philadelphia and 
read extensively in the field of early school leaving to prepare himself 

h 

for this study. He found that in 1950-1951* a total of 30 per cent of 
the senior high school enrolment in Philadelphia left school before 
graduation. 


Method 

Horowitz summarized related information and examined the records 
of drop-outs. 

Findings 

1. 1/Vhat symptoms identify the potential drop-out? 

(1) Poor attendance. 

(2) Poor reading ability. 

(3) Subject failures. 

(U) Personal maladjustment. 

(5) hack of active participation in school 
activities. 

(6) Parental indifference, broken home, or lack of 
parental control. 

(7) how financial status. 

(8) hack of interest or dislike of certain subjects. 

(9) Lack of warm pupil-teacher relationships. 

2. 7i/hat are the reasons given by Drop-outs?

(1) Di.ssatisfaction with school or lack of interest tops the 
list* Other reasons given are: 

(2) The program is not suited to their needs or abilities. 

(2) Failure in subjects causing non-promotion. 

(k) "No one in school was interested in me' 1 . 

(5) Economic conditions. 

(6) Inadequate guidance. 

3. THttiat is the drop-out picture in Philadelphia Senior High 
Schools? 

(a) Thirty per cent of aH senior high school students left 

school prematurely in 1950-1951 for these causes: enrolled elsewhere; 

moved from district; over compulsory age; general employment certificate 

issued; deceased; mentally or physically incapacitated. 

(b) Of every 10 drop-outs in Philadelphia Senior High Schools, 

1 drops out in Grade 9> 

5 drop out in Grade 10, 

3 drop out in Grade 11, 

1 drops out in Grade 12. 

(c) Six out of every 10 pupils who drop out are boys. 

(d) Fifty per cent of those who reach grade ten in the average 
senior high school drop out of school before graduation. 

(e) A detailed analysis made in one school showed: 

(i) Pupils who dropped out because they obtained employment 
at age sixteen were on the average of superior intelligence to those 
who dropped out at age seventeen, which is past the compulsory age. 

(ii) Pupils who left school for employment compared favorably 
in intelligence with pupils who remained in school. 




Evaluation 


Horowitz effectively summarized important data pertinent to 
the study of student mortality in the high schools. Studies such 
as this indicate definite implications for e ducation and are suggestive 
of areas in -which actual experimentation could be conducted. 

V. SECONDARY SCHOOL EDUCATE ON IN AGRICULTURAL 

COMMUNITIES 

Background 

5 

This report was prepared by a committee of the Canadian 
Education Association to find out the views of leaders in agricultural 
communities on how the high schools can best serve the needs of 
agriculture and home life, and the needs of rural young people, 
especially those who are not planning to attend university, or 
preparing for professional careers. 

Method 

Questionnaires were sent to approximately 2800 persons, of whom 
110 U, approximately I 4 .O per cent, replied. 

Findings 

1. The 19lfL Canadian Census figures shewed that approximately 


32 per cent of Canada’s employed are in agriculture. '■ftieir education 
is: 

Less than 5 years of schooling.15*5$ 

Five to eight years .65.1$ 

More than 8 years: some high school or 

more... 52.2$

2. Why do rural youth drop out of school? 


Reasons Per Cent 

(a) Parents think farmers do not need 

high school. 12 

(b) Scarcity of farm labor . 22,9 

(c) High School program inadequate. 52.2 

(d) Other reasons or no answer . 12.9 


This view appears more pronounced in Nova Scotia, Manitoba, New 
Brunswick, and Alberta. 

3« Of all those answering the questionnaire, 3 I 1.8 per cent 
thought the schools were giving a suitable education to help girls to 
become good homemakers. Only 16.1 per cent thought the schools were 
giving a suitable education to help boys to become successful farmers. 

it. With respect to education for employment in urban centres, 
68.1 per cent thought the high schools were doing a satisfactory job. 

5. Less than half of the agricultural leaders thought the high 
schools were serving the community well in preparing young people to 
think clearly on the social, economic, and political questions of the 
day. 

6. Statistics indicate that rural boys do not stay in school 
as long as urban beys do. 

7. Eighty-seven per cent of the sample felt that the composite 
high school is the type of high school that can best serve the needs of 
a rural community. 

8. In descending order of greatest value, the following courses 
were thought to be valuable: Practical agriculture, home economics, 
farm mechanics, shop work, agricultural science and commercial work.

9 . There was a strong endorsation of the “school and home- 
farra cooperation concept" by the members of the sample. This is in 
line with the development of Vocational Agricultural Projects in the 
United States. 

10 . There was strong support, 77.6 per cent, for short courses 
in shop work, farm mechanics, and practical agriculture where schools 
and staff are prepared for such an offering. 

Evaluation 

The sample in this report is much too small for a nation-w3.de 
study. It does represent however, the thinking of 110h recognized 
leaders, and in many instances the thinking of groups of interested 
persons such as the Home and School, or the Federation of Agriculture. 

VI. EDUCATION AND TRAINING OF EMPLOYEES 
IN INDUSTRY 

Background 

6 

Another report of the Canadian Research Committee deals with 

K{,-. 

secondary school education as a preparation for employment. A total 
of 227 employing firms, and the two railroads, were contacted for 
information. 

Method 

Questionnaires were sent to 1000 randomly chosen small business 
firms listed in the Canadian Trade Index, UOO large business firms

selected by the Canadian Manufacturer^ Association, and the 2 rail¬ 
ways. There were Ull questionnaires filled out and returned, largely 
by Personnel Managers, Supervisors of Training, Managers and 
Superintendents • 

Findings 

1 . Three classifications of workers according to the skills 
required are; 

Class I - jobs requiring a high degree of judgment, 
knowledge and dcill. 

Class II - jobs of a mechanical nature requiring 

relatively less judgment, knowledge and skill. 

Class III - jobs requiring only physical exertion or manual 
dexterity in repetitive operations. 

2. Th ere was general agreement that Class I workers should be 
graduates of a secondary school. Eoughly 60 per cent of the employers 
consider secondary school education desirable, if not essential, for 
Class II workers, particularly because promotion to Class I is generally 
from Class II. The Grade 10 level was regarded as sufficient for 
pupils who will seek employment as Class III workers. 

3 . The approximate ratio of the three classes of workers is 

1-2-2. 

U. About 80 per cent of the managers who responded found technical 
school graduates satisfactory for Class II work, and 60 per cent found 
them satisfactory for Class I work. 

5. The employers felt that emphasis in Secondary School must be 
placed on high standards of performance in all work, on fundamentals of

general education, on responsibilities of citizenship. 

6. The greatest deficiency in young employees was found to 
be character. 

7* Specifically the most common deficiencies in young employees 
were: lack of sense of responsibility; inability to think, to analyze 
and to express thoughts clearly; and lack of an occupational goal. 

8. The majority of firms favoured summer employment and conducted 
tours for senior students in special courses; about one-third thought 
cooperative training valuable and feasible. 

9. About one-third of industrial firms had apprenticeship plans 
in their organization. About one-quarter worked with local Technical 
Schools to offer employees related training. A lese fi rms seemed well 
satisfied with the results. One-half of the firms not then working 
with local Technical Schools were interested in establishing some foira 
of cooperative training. 

Evaluation 

Again the sample is too small for valid conclusions so that the 
greatest value of this study lies in its implications for secondary 
education. It must be remembered, however, that these implications 
represent the views of a small cross-section of Canadian business firms, 
and would have to be considered in conjunction with the expressed needs 
of other occupational groups in Canada.

academic history of the 1 9kS Grade IX class in their subsequent high 
school careers. 

Method 

Evans examined the Provincial Department of Education records 
of promotions and failures, the curriculum, and other aspects of 
secondary education. Upon these data the investigator formulated 
certain conclusions and implications. The original sample was made 
up of 1200 grade IX students. 

Findings 

1. Using 3 samples of ItOO students each from each of the 
three Grade IX departmental promotion categories, Evans found that 8l6 
dropped out without completing high school. The following table 
represents a complete record of the length of time the twelve hundred 
students under consideration attended hi^i school.

2* Of the 816 students who dropped out, the largest part, 
ii7*9 per cent, was formed by the C students, 

3. Of the 391 C students who dropped out, 31 «9 per cent did so 
without attempting Grade X. 

k 9 Over half, 62.3 per cent of the original UOO C students had 
dropped out by the end of Grade X. 

5» ^he percentage of B and C drop-outs increased throughout the 
high school program. 

6. The number of B and C students dropping out at the Grade XI 
and XII levels is about the same, but on the basis of those reaching 
these Grades, the percentage of C students is much higher. 

7. Very few A students drop out after reaching Grade XII; in 
this sample, only k dropped out from Grade twelve. 

8. Of the original UOO C students, 58 succeed in reaching Grade XII, 
but only 9 of these were successful in obtaining a High School Diploma, 

as compared to 155 B students attempting Grade XII with 58 obtaining 
High School Diplomas. 

9. Mr. Evans concludes that a school program which loses nearly 
half of its A students, three-quarters of its B students and 391 out of 
1*00 G students cannot be said to aid the weaker students. 

Evaluation 

This investigator feels that a narrow Alberta curriculum is 
a major factor in early school leaving. "Whatever the causes, he has 
presented convincing evidence of a high rate of drop-out in Alberta 
High Schools.

Background 

The article is written to counselors to make them aware of school 
survival rates and to indicate what might be done to increase those 
rates. 

Method

of dropping out, and the preparation of counselors to prevent early 
school leaving.

2* This table shows that for each 1,000 pupils who entered 
the first year of high school in the fall of 19^2, only 526 were 
graduated* A third of the original class dropped out of school during 
the second and third years of high school. 

3* At college level, of every 1,000 students who entered in 
19U2, only 397 were graduated in 19l|6. Sixty per cent dropped out 
before graduation. This period, however, represents war years and 
the first unsettled postwar year when veterans were entering higher 
institutions in large numbers. College graduates of I9U0 would be 
more typicalt Of every 1,000 students who entered College in 1936* 
only 508 were graduated in 19U0. Half dropped out before graduating. 

1;. The authors state that these trends will continue until High 
schools find a means of gearing courses to fit students rather than 
forcing all students to take certain required courses for which they 
may have neither capacity nor use. For example, some schools still 
require algebra of all students for graduation. On the other hand, 
many schools have substituted a more practical course in general 
mathematics designed for those who are unlikely to need algebra. 

5* For the guidance of counselors, the article indicates that 
adolescents who are likely to drop-out of school usually show advance 
symptoms. They list the following: failed in subject matter, poor 
achievement records, poor attendance records, reading difficultde s, 
lack of participation in school activities, and an urge to earn money 
and become independent. Studies show that students drop out also 
because of such personal reasons as: lack of money, having to help the 
family, parental disinterest, illness, feeling that they do not belong,

difficulty with studies, impractical nature of school work, and lack 
of interest* 

6 * In the preparation of counselors, counselor trainers should 
discuss survival rates in schools to acquaint guidance workers with the 
critical years* Counselors will have many occasions to suggest job 
opportunities and practical work projects for those likely to leave school 
permanently and prematurely. 

Evaluation 

Ifois is a well thought out interpretation of the trends indicated 
by the table. The implications noted in terms of these trends are 
logical ones* The list of symptoms of early school leaving was carefully 
selected; all are included in chapter three of this dissertation. 

IX. A STUDY OF SCHOOL HOLDLNG POWER 
Background 

The U.S. Office of Education studied holding power in eight cities 

of over 200,00 population. The cities were Cincinnati, Columbus, 

Indianapolis Louisville, Pittsburgh, Providence, Rochester, and San 

9 

Diego. The stucty- was conducted in 1953* the report issued in January, 
195U. The number of drop-outs in the study is 1;,136 Grade IX and 
Grade X students. 

Method 

Each city school system planned Its own attack of the problem. 

The results were consolidated in work conferences attended by 
representatives of the eight cities.

Evaluation 

These figures do not, of course, represent drop-outs only, as a 
withdrawal is any student -who leaves school for any purpose or under any 
circumstances. It is interesting to note that 5>23 boys and girls left 
High school as soon as they were able to do so 5 these might be regarded 
as drop-outs. It is startling however, to note that 82 boys and girls 
left school from the elementary section at the age of sixteen. There 
are grave implications to education here in terms of curriculum, 
retardation, guidance, and promotion policies.

X. WHY STAY IN SCHOOL? 


Background 

As Assistant Secretary of Research and Publicity for the National 

Child Labor Committee, Florence Taylor has had much opportunity to 

study the problem of student mortality in the High schools. Her 
11 

present report is in the form of a life adjustment booklet issued 
in 1953. 

Method 

The report is a discussion of the problem addressed to High 
school students and designed to encourage them to remain in school 
to graduation. 

Findings 

1. Why Students Drop Out 

Personal troubles: 

(a) Money problems* Clothes, carfare, lunch money, fees for 
laboratory, locker and gym, books and supplies, and school activities 
cost from 90 dollars in grade 9 to 160 dollars in Grade 12. 

(b) Parent trouble. A parent may decide that it is time 
for his son or daughter to earn a living. 

(c) Parental indifference to education. 

School problems: 

(a) Broken homes affect learning ability. 

(b) A long illness may put child too far behind. 

(c) Students may find high school much harder than Grade 
school.

(d) Wrong ideas about relative importance of jobs. 

(e) Frequent transfers lead to dropping out. 

(f) Boring courses. 

(g) Some students think school is for children. 

(h) Girls may leave to marry. 

2. What Happens to School-Leavers ? 

Low Pay: The U.S. Chamber of Commerce reported that of the 
people who had incomes of $5*000 or over in 19^0, 50 per cent had 
some College education; 39 per cent had some High school education; 
and 11 per cent had an eighth grade education or less. The figures 
are nearly reversed for the group earning $1,500 to $2,000 a year. 

Over 50 per cent of them had only an eighth grade education or less; 

3h per cent had some High school education; and only a small number 
had some College education. 

Very few return to study evenings or in regular schools once 
they withdraw* 

With increased specialization, there is a corresponding decrease 
in employment opportunities for young, untrained boys and girls. 

3* Their Own Story 

In Detroit, U00 unemployed boys and girls between the ages of 
16 and 20 told their story. 

(a) Some did not know what they wanted to do. 

(b) Some did not know how to get a job. 

(c) Some drifted from job to job because they were looking 


for a job with a future 









(d) Some could get nothing but unskilled work and they did 
not want that. They wanted jobs as technicians, mechanics, sales 
and office workers, yet -when they left school, they cut off their 
chances for getting training for such jobs. Nearly two-thirds of 
these unemployed boys and girls admitted that they needed more training 
in: commercial, mathematics, draftsmanship, typing, shorthand, auto 
repair, business, mechanics and machine work subjects. 

(e) Many drop-outs felt the lack of a High school diploma in 
their work and in their social life. 

It. Miss Taylor states that the young people who drop out of 
%gh school are very much like those who remain to graduate. They are 
from middle-class families, and usually their parents vdll see them 
through if they are vdlling to remain. Many of these teen-agers have the 
same problems as the drop-outs, but they stick it out and get that 
diploma. 

Evaluation 

This article presents a strong case for continued efforts on 
the part of the youth of today to ccmplete their High school education. 

XC. TOY PUPILS LEAVE SCHOOL 
Background 

Stinebaugh, a retired superintendent of schools, called on his 

rich background of experience with students in Indianapolis to furnish 

12 

materials for this 19$1 treatment of the subject of early school leaving.

Method 

Stinebaugh discussed the topic in the form of an article for 
magazine publication. 

Findings 

1. The author’s basic point of view is expressed in his statement 

that ’’Pupils leave school because the school represents duty, responsibility, 

13 

effort, a challenge, and the discipline of living up to one’s best”. 

2# The early leaver is a liability. Parents, teachers, and 
adult friends must encourage youth: (a) to realize the potential power 
of knowledge and technical skills; (b) to recognize the significance 
of school attendance in achieving this end. In most cases the early 
school leaver must be regarded as a truant, ingrate, a potential liability 
to the community. 

3. School success is determined in a large measure by the pupil's 
attitude toward school, by his relations with his peers and his teachers. 
There must be mutual understanding between schools and pupils; this 
requires proper welcoming and orientation of new pupils during the 
initial stages of a school year. 

lu Stinebaugh outlines the following individual program for 
the individual student: 

(a) Learning activities must be selected according to 
learner's interest, aptitudes, and capacity. 

(b) Voluntary membership in school clubs and organizations 
will enable the pupil to find an outlet for his interests and to

establish himself as an integral part of small social groups within 
the school society. 

(c) The student must be willing to make a real effort and 
to spend time on school tasks to the best of his ability and to the 
limit of his capacity. 

(d) Parents should cooperate with the school staff in 
planning with pupils a program of work, sleep, rest, and recreation 
appropriate for the pupil at his present stage of development so that 
school activities make a proper balance to learning. 

5. The writer feels that the satisfaction of success is 
important in keeping youth in school. 

(a) The pupil’s own satisfaction of accomplishment is a 
factor in withdrawal or attendance. Teachers must recognize 
satisfactory progress; recognition of limitations is also necessary. 

(b) If a pupil is serious about graduation, if he works 
with enthusiasm and determination, if he applies himself to capacity 
and experiences satisfaction of accomplishment, his attendance to 
graduation is assured. 

(c) If there are factors beyond his control which jeopardi: 
his continued schooling, then the home, school, and coninunity should 
assume final responsibility. Health service, wise counselling and 
leadership and economic assistance should be provided as needed so 
that a student can give school work undivided attention. 

6. Completion of High school is the greatest consideration 
for every student and for society.

Evaluation 


Stinebaugh presents a vigorous argument to place the onus of 
school completion upon the student himself. This represents a 
departure from the more common feeling that the individual is forced 
out of school because of circumstances mitigating against his remaining 
thereo Further investigation of this stand -would be worth while. The 
research worker does state that if there are factors beyond the student 1 
control, then the home, school, and community should assume final 
responsibility. In view of the lack of experience of high school 
students in making decisions of as great consequence as staying in, 
or leaving school, this expression of community responsibility would 
be a defensible position to maintain at all times. 

XII. THE POTENTIAL DROP-OUTS 
Background 

The Guidance Division of Nova Scotia’s Department of Education 
wished to have a quick means of identifying the potential drop-outs. 

ia 

Such a device could serve three purposes: 

1. Administrators can estimate future enrolments. 

2. They can predict the number of repeaters. 

3. Counselors and teachers can use this to prevent or delay 
unnecessary and premature withdrawals from school.

Method 

The Guidance Division selected eight leading symptoms of early 
school leaving. 

Findings 

1. These chief symptoms were found to be: 

(a) Repeated failure in one or more subjects or grades. 

(b) A consistently low record of achievement. 

(c) Significant retardation in basic courses. 

(d) Frequent absenteeism, 

(e) Lack of participation in extra-curricular activities. 

(f) Indications of poor economic conditions at home. 

(g) Indifferent or hostile attitude toward school. 

(h) Behavior problems requiring frequent disciplinary 

action. 

Evaluation 

This list is highly comparable with findings of leading studies 
in this dissertation, and would be of positive assistance in identifying 
the potential early school leaver.

XIII. A QUICK METHOD OF PREDICTING DROP-OUTS 
Background 

As guidance director of Depew Public Schools, Stock wished far a 
quick way to identify potential drop-outs. 

Method 

Stock worked out a procedure which he found successful in 
predicting drop-outs. 


12. Stock, Francis J. M A Quick Method of Predicting Drop Outs", 
Personnel and Guidance Journal , Detroit, 1953* 














• . ' . 


, 






























246 


Find! ngs 

1. Since retardation and persistent failure appear to be most 
prominent causes of dropping-out. Stock used age-grade placement and 
low marks to predict drop-outs. His procedure follows: 

(a) List all students in a grade alphabetically. 

(b) List age in years, months, as in September, opposite 
each other. 

(c) List for each an academic average made up of marks in 
English, Social Studies, and Mathematics. 

(d) Rank each frcm high to low average. 

(e) Record rank and average opposite each name. 

(f) Calculate age limits within which a child would be in a 
certain grade were he not retarded. Base this calculation on the student's 
age at entry in Grade 1. 

(g) Underline in red the names of all the students whose age 
is greater than the limits for September for the grade studied. 

(h) Underline in blue the names of students whose rank places 
them in the lowest quarter of their class. 

The result is three groups: 

(i) Those whose names are not underlined and who are least 
likely to leave school before graduation. 

(ii) Those underlined in red or blue (not both). Those are 
possible school leavers but usually can be held if effort is put forth 
to save them. 

(iii) Those whose names have been underlined in both red and 
blue. These are the most probable drop-outs. They can only be saved 
for graduation by a real effort on the part of the counselor, faculty

Evaluation 

Ihile this technique is not foolproof, it gives the counselor 
and faculty something concrete in the way of knowing most of the 
probable drop-outs, often before the student himself is aware that he 
is thinking about dropping out.

XIV. YffTHDRAWALS FROM GRAMMAR SCHOOLS 

Background 

The report of the seventh annual conference of the National 
Association of Divisional Executives for Educationheld at the 
Knightstone Theatre, Weston-Super-Mare in England, includes a discussion 
by the delegates of a resolution regarding withdrawals from grammar 
schools. 

Method 

The discussion was based on the following resolution: "That 
the problem of Grammar School Leavers and the question of the 
imposition of penalty be reconsidered and the Minister of Education 
be again asked to introduce legal measures to enforce attendance at 
Secondary and Grammar Schools until a pupil has finished the required 
course”. 

Findings 

1. One delegate said that there was no evidence that an 
agreement of the kind suggested would in fact have any success in 
retaining children in school if parents were determined to withdraw

them. He maintained that an unhappy child in a secondary school 
was probably a legacy of bad selection at the age of eleven and it 
would be cruel to retain him in school. With parents the problem 
was nearly always one of economics. This member felt that it was 
likely that when the number of school leavers began to increase after 
195>7> the parent faced with greater competition in securing a place 
for his child in industry or commerce would probably realize that it 
was in his own interest to keep the child at school. 

2. A second speaker said he was in agreement with the object 
of the resolution but thought that it attacked the problem in the 
wrong way. 

3. A third delegate felt that it was possible to obtain private 
legislation which would solve the situation. 

U, On being put to the vote, the resolution was defeated. 

Evaluation 

The resolution and its discussion is further evidence of the 
world-wide nature of idle problem and the deep concern with which 
educational authorities regard it. It would, of course, be difficult 
to successfully legislate against early school leaving; rather is it a 
challenge to the school and community to so organize the educational 
offerings as to attract and retain students in school. 

XV. REAL CAUSES OF SCHOOL MORTALITY 
Background 

This discussion of causes of school mortality is part of the 





author^ introduction to his text-book concerning commercial education 
in the High school. 

Findings 

Hi 

1. Mr. Nichols states that for many years there was a 
persistent notion that high school mortality was almost entirely due to 
economic pressure at home. This notion still persists in the face of 
indisputable proof that economic necessity accounts for but approx¬ 
imately 15 per cent of withdrawals. 

2. Approximately 35 per cent of those who enroll in the ninth 
grade of the four-year high schools of the country leave before the 
beginning of the second year. f £he organization of elementary and 
secondary education on the 6-3-3 or 6-6 plan has tended to reduce 
eliminations at the end of the ninth school year. The failure of an 
expanded four-year High school program to reduce the number of ninth 
year drop-outs has to some extent supported the theory that nothing 
short of the improvement of the economic status of American homes can 
be depended upon to keep boys and girls in school longer on the average. 
The success of the junior College or six-year High school in reducing 
mortality tends to deny the potency of economic pressure in causing early 
and excessive High school elimination. 

3. Ifilhat commonly is thought of as economic pressure is social 
pressure. Boys want that freedom from parental restraint -which entrance 
upon full time employment usually accomplishes. They crave the

immediate financial independence -which a wage seems to guarantee. 

They want to dress better than the allowance provided for in the budget 
will permit. They wish to impress their girl friends by spending money 
more freely for the entertainment and service which some girls demard. 

These social causes are easily confounded with true economic causes of 
school elimination. 

k» It is much the same with the girls. Dame Fashion often is 

their master. They covet better and more costly clothing, personal 
adornment and gratification. Parental restraint is irksane. Independence 
of thought and action is essential to their happiness. 

5. In so far as it is shown that greater benefit will accrue to 
a boy or a girl through school attendance than will come through early 
employment, attempts should be made to remedy social conditions that tend 
to force many boys and girls out of school before there is any economic 
or educational reason for their leaving. On the other hand properly organ¬ 
ized commercial courses should appeal to young people bent on leaving 
school soon. Such courses may exert a powerful influence to keep boys 
and girls in school, for a time at least, to secure the wage-earning 
benefits that apparently will flow from the investment of more time in 
preparation for work. Thus it may be urged that, while commercial 
courses cannot be relied upon to solve the problem of High school 
elimination, it can be expected to lengthen the average period of High 
school stacty and to improve the quality of service those who drop out 
will render to society as wage earners.

Nichols concludes by admitting that the recent changes in 
educational theoiy briefly stated above are by no means all that 
could be cited; but they are among the most important from the 
vieyjpoint of commercial education.

CHAPTER XII 


SUMMARY OF FINDINGS AND EVALUATION 

The major findings resulting from this investigation are now 
briefly summarized under the headings of general findings, main 
associated factors, predictive factors, and, what to do to reduce drop¬ 
outs, 

I. GENERAL FINDINGS 

Scope of the Problem 

Correspondence with education officials in the countries listed 
in chapter II indicates that the problem of drop-outs is world-wide* 

Since the problem is so acute in the United States and Canada, it may 
be assumed that it would be even more so in countries where standards of 
living in general are much lower. 

Variation from Place to Place 

There is great disparity in the proportionate number of drop¬ 
outs between states or provinces, between counties or school divisions, 
between communities, and between schools in the same community, 

EnroLtients and Retention 

The enrolments of the nations 1 schools are increasing but this is 
chiefly because of increased birth-rates and not increased retention 
rates. 

Equality of Educational Opportunity 

Per capita costs of education in the various states of the United 
States show that there is no equality of educational opportunity. Hidden

tuition fees in high schools have shown to contribute to early school 
leaving, giving further evidence of a great degree of educational 
inequality* 


II. MIN ASSOCIATED FACTORS 
Economic Status, Occupation of Parent and Drop-Out 
The majority of studies in this investigation use the first two 
terms synonymously as far as the true economic situation is concerned. 
The occupational code of the United States Department of Labor provides 
the best scale and classifications. 

The evidence strongly indicates a relationship between economic 
status and dropping out of school, but a fatalistic view with regard to 
it is not justified. Many children, despite economic handicaps, under 
effective guidance remain in school to improve their talents and win for 
themselves a good start in life. 

Retardation, Becoming Overage, and the Prop-Ait 
"When the standards and policies of the school cause pupils to 
repeat grades and do work which they are hopelessly incapable of doing, 
the school produces extensive retardation which complicates the teaching 
situation. The elementary school must recognize its responsibility, 
for it contributes largely to the retardation which results in withdrawal 
from school. As absence, frequent transfers and health a re related in 
a general way to this problem, an increasing sensitivity to these factors 
on the part of the elementary school is required.

Intelligence and the Drop-^ut 

If this investigation of the drop-out problem has disclosed any¬ 
thing, it is that the intelligence of the drop-out is higher than most 
school administrators suspect and that he has the mental capacity to do 
the work of the average high school* Teachers' marks, however, are a 
different matter; the drop-out fares worse than three-fourths of the 
graduates in this regard® This unfortunate paradox, average intelli¬ 
gence and poor marks, should awaken the schools to the curriculum needs 
and the guidance requirements of these young people* 

It should be evident from the results of the studies investigated 
that low intelligence has been overrated as a primary cause of early 
school leaving. Many pupils did find the courses beyond their mental 
capacities and eliminated themselves or were eliminated by constant 
failures. It would be safe to say, however, that only a small percentage 
of adolescents are so deficient in mental ability that they cannot profit 
from some form of high school work. 

Sex and the Drop-Out 

The evidence is conflicting regarding the proportion, but the boys 
appear to leave school at an earlier age and in greater number than do 
the girls. A notable difference from this trend in North America occurs 
in England and Scotland where the reverse is apparently the case. 

Home Status and the Drop-Out 

The child who has reason to feel insecure or lacks the guidance 
and supervision of both parents is handicapped. He brings his problems

and feelings to school, invariably with detrimental results, A home 
broken by death, divorce, or separation markedly affects the lives of 
those in it. 

Personality Ratings and Drop-Outs 
Personal qualities such as a cooperative attitude, courtesy, 
dependability, ambition, self-confidence, initiative, leadership and 
resourcefulness are possessed by all pupils in some degree. In the few 
studies which attempted to discover whether these were related to the 
drop-out problem, the ratings were of necessity subjective. The evidence, 
therefore, appears to be conflicting. 

Participation in Extra-Curricular Activities 
Inasmuch as the extra-curricular program helps to develop the 
vocational and avocational interests of youth and makes significant 
contributions to the intellectual as well as the social development of 
young people, participation in this phase of the school program is 
regarded as an important factor in the holding power of the high school. 
These activities are the prestige - bearing and the fun phase of school 
life. Those who participate “belong 1 * and are usually well-adjusted and 
happy, while the reverse is also true: the non-participating pupil is 
often unhappy and becomes a potential drop-out. 

Pupil and Parent Attitude Toward Education 
In the absence of a strong positive attitude toward education on 
the part of the pupil and parents the school has a formidable task in 
retaining the young people to graduation.

PREDICTIVE FACTORS 


Dillon, Gragg and Tripensee sought to determine which combination 
of factors notably prevalent in the cases of drop-out studies have 
predictive value. Is it possible to predict with any degree of accuracy 
whether a pupil will remain in school to graduate, or withdraw from 
school because of his rating in respect to certain factors such as age, 
intelligence, economic status and retardation? It was thought that the 
school would be able to institute certain adjustments in its programs 
for those pupils of known vulnerability if it could be determined which 
factors primarily contributed to school withdrawal. 

Predictive Factors: Dillon^ Findings 

(1) Fairly consistent regression in scholarship from elementary 
to junior to senior high school, 

(2) Frequent grade failures in the elementary school, 

(3) High frequency of grade or subject failure in the junior and 
senior high school. 

(U) Marked regression in attendance from elementary to junior to 
senior high school. 

(5) Frequent transfers from one school to another. 

(6) Evidence of a feeling of insecurity, or "lack of belonging” 
in school. 

(7) Marked lack of interest in school work. 

It should be noted that economic need, while recognized as one of 
the causes relating to dropping out, does not have the importance of the 


factors listed above

High School Graduation, 1 ’ submitted to the Faculty of the Graduate School 
at Yale University in 191*8, has sorted the factors contributing to 
dropping out and found five which had high predictive value; 

1. Ninth grade scholarship; school marks were averaged. 

2. Attitude toward graduation; this factor was rated high when

the pupil showed an acceptance of the importance of a high school education 
and a determination to complete high school even in the face of difficulty. 

3* General school adjustment: many items, including personality 
and social adaptibility, were considered. 

U. Age. 

5>. IQ rating: the Otis Group Intelligence Test was used to 
determine rating. This method identified correctly 7 8 — 8 U per cent of 
the drop-outs and 8 lj -90 per cent of the graduates. 

IV. WHAT TO DO TO REDUCE DROP-OUTS 

Various suggestions have been made for keeping pupils of high 
school age in school. The recommendations of many studies are summarized 
here. 

1. Develop a guidance program which is not limited to vocational 
matters but covers all the personal problems of youth. This type of 
program requires the cooperation of the entire staff as well as the 
specialized knowledge of guidance experts. It should include a follow¬ 
up guidance service for those who must leave school. 

2. Adjust the curriculum and methods of instruction to the 
abilities, needs and interests of the individual pupil. For some, this 
may mean a part-time high school program integrated with part-time 
employment•

for rural areas.

age for employment. Provide means of enforcing this law. 

5. Provide student aid for those who would be forced to leave 
school because of economic circumstances. 

6 . Raise the prestige of high school so that everyone will 
consider high school graduation a necessity. 

Dillon also offers several recommendations for reducing the number 
of drop-outs. Listed briefly, they are as follows: 

1. Know the student as an individual. 

2. Obtain the student’s confidence. 

3* Provide an educational program wherein the students can 
experience achievement.

10. Establish a good record system. 

11. Recognize signs of trouble. 

12 . Make use of the record. 

13. Help students select the right courses. 

Ili. Begin counseling early.

p 

The authors of M Improvement of Holding Power 11 state that reduced 
to its simplest form the improvement of the holding power of a given 
school simply means better education. The statement appears to be 
fundamentally sound. If our high schools are to serve better the needs 
of society and of those it now graduates, as well as the needs of those 
who now withdraw before graduation, the authors of this study feel that 
the following changes must take place: 

1. There must be broad acceptance on the part of parents and 
teachers of the need for universal secondary education for all normal 
youth, and a formulation of a philosophy of education which accepts this 
thesis as fundamental to basic improvement. 

2. The establishment of an adequate guidance program in all 
secondary schools must take place without delay. The varied interest 
and abilities of youth now attending high school make necessary a 
thorough study of each individual before the school can plan appropriate 
educational and vocational programs which will meet the needs of the 
individual pupils• 

3. The implications of universal education should be obvioris 

to the classroom teacher. Methods, techniques, materials and equipment 
must be adapted to the differences in individuals at both ends of the 
ability range. The pupil must also be accepted as a person and regarded 
as one possessing a normal yearning for achievement, recognition, 
security and new experiences. There are needless barriers to complete

adjustment in many of the practices existing in our schools today. By 
slavish adherence to tradition, we sacrifice the educational right and 
need of half of our youth. 

U. Our curriculum does not sufficiently reflect socio-economic 
changes nor the purpose of education in a democracy. Youth is practically 
unemployable until he is 18; the school should experiment until it finds 
that combination of general and specialized education which will best 
meet the needs of those who terminate their education in high school. 

5. If democratization of education is to be achieved, then the 
inconsistencies between philosophy and practice must disappear. Diplom a 
requirements, standards, marking systems, promotion policies are all too 
often inconsistent with the school’s professed policy of education, thus 
forcing a pupil out of school. 

Finally, the authors stress that it must be recognized that better 
holding power can only come from leadership - leadership of the entire 
high school faculty. Too many in the profession are not aware how 
low the holding power of the school is. There must be a wide 
dissemination of information regarding the issues involved; then and 
only then, can there exist a retention minded public and a profession 
determined to improve educational opportunities for all youth. Leader¬ 
ship in education has made our schools what they are - the biggest 
investment any society has ever made for its greatest resource - its 
youth. Leadership can make it an even better investment for society and 
the individual as well. This leadership win be found in those schools 
that participate fully in holding power studies.

CHAPTER XIII 


SUMMARY OF METHODS AND EVALUATION 
The studies examined in this dissertation followed four major 
patterns. The methods will now be restated in outline and briefly- 
evaluated. 

Factual Reports of Incidence of Drop-Outs 

Such studies are chiefly concerned with the normative survey 
and the census report. These are counting processes which indicate 
trends in attendance, retention, and population movements at com¬ 
munity, town and city levels. Because of the high degree of accuracy 
of such reports, a careful study of their figures may lead to certain 
hypotheses concerning which experimental data could be gathered. In 
addition, census figures provide norms which may be used as a standard 
of comparison. 

While such reports do not explain the phenomenon of early school 
leaving, they show how many of the total school population do leave 
before completing high school. Thus they emphasize the seriousness 
of the problem, and provide accurate data for individuals or groups 
who are concerned over the situation. 

Study of Factors Related to Drop-Outs 

Leading authorities on school drop-outs like Dillon, Gragg, 

Segel, Dresher, Hollingshead, Allen, and others, emphasize that no 
single reason has been isolated as the sole or major cause for early 
school leaving. In his doctoral dissertation, Gragg was unable to 
find any criterion intimately related to the drop-out - retention 
variable. He concluded that dropping out is a result of several

forces working concomitantly. Hollingshead showed how a constellation 
of factors related to drop-outs, and that these factors are set in 
the background of the individual's community. He does not discuss 
any differential effect of these factors. 

The majority of studies point up the fact that in the study of 
the problem, there must be a strong shift from the traditional approach 
of endeavoring to isolate causes of drop-out to a new one of seeking 
factors which are most closely associated with early school leaving. 

The major aim in factor studies is to establish critical points which 
would differentiate between a majority of the graduates and a majority 
of the drop-outs. Such a development would be of paramount importance 
to school administrators. 

Opinion of Students Who Drop Out 

Opinions of drop-outs are obtained through questionnaires or 
interviews. Both techniques are affected by procedural difficulties 
which influence in varying degrees the final results. 

The major criticism of both devices is that in effect, they 
ask the subjects to do self-analysis, and to develop insights into 
their own attitudes and behavior. The majority of people cannot do 
this with any degree of objectivity, so that basically, the responses 
are rationalizations. If the student takes part in a questionnaire 
or an interview at the time of leaving school, he is painfully aware 
of his feelings. He is oblivious to the scientific causes leading to 
the act of dropping out. On the other hand, when responses are given 
a considerable time after school leaving, they are much influenced by 
the individual's post-school success or failure on the job and his 
general ability to lead a life which, in his mind, is effective in

terms of self and community. 

In either case, the results of questionnaire and interview 
studies cannot be regarded as sufficiently conclusive to justify 
generalization to a population. 

Nevertheless, both techniques continue to be used frequently 
in research, inasmuch as they are comparatively easy and inexpensive 
ways of obtaining general information. They are valuable, however, 
when they are used to develop broad insights into a problem, and will 
certainly continue to be widely employed. 

Opinions of Experts Giving Reasons for Early School Leaving 

Much that has been written on the problem of school retention 
is in the realm of pure opinion. It may be regarded as expert opinion 
because most of it is offered by people in the educational field. 

Some write from sheer interest, others because they are directly or 
indirectly faced with the phenomenon. 

Sound as much of this data may appear to be, it is however, 
purely subjective, and therefore the least reliable of the four 
methods outlined in this chapter.

CHAPTER XIV 


RECOMMENDATIONS FOR RESEARCH 

A model study on early school leaving would begin with a compre¬ 
hensive survey of the communities from which the samples are chosen. 
Hollingshead^- showed how important is the influence of upper classes on 
education, and how upsetting might be the backgrounds of lower class 
children. 

A worthwhile study then would include samples from rural areas, 
from towns, and small and large cities. These samples must be 
proportionate to the number in the total population. 

Step by step procedures in setting up a comprehensive study on 
school retention is outlined in book form by Charles Allen^ of the 
University of Illinois. 

In the area of community studies the main problem is to employ 
sound methods in ascertaining class structures. 

A major Item used in such measurement is socio-economic status. 
Chapin defines it as u the position an individual or family occupied 
with reference to the prevailing average standards of cultural possessions, 
effective income, material possessions, and participation in the group 
activities of the community n . 

The principal steps in the construction of sociometric scales 

are?

In 19$0, the Work Conference on Life Adjustment Education met in 
Chicago and drew up cooperative research proposals for schools in large 
cities. Because these proposals^ appear to be based on sound procedures, 
and because they are readily adaptable to communities other than cities, 
those pertaining to school retention are briefly outlined as possible 
courses of action in Alberta. 

Proposal No. 1 : Uniform Pupil Accounting 

What is proposed ? A plan for basic, uniform pupil accounting procedure 
which would make possible the collection of comparable data concerning 
holding power, drop-outs, and school leavers. 

A. Longitudinal Study: Such a study would provide a basis for 
the comparison of data and the evaluation of results of experimental or 
ongoing curricular and administrative programs. 

This type of study can be done in any school, part of school, 
or school system, 

B. Cross-Sectional Study: Since most educational research and 
experimentation is carried out in individual schools, it is proposed 
that pupil accounting records be kept on pupils in grades 9, 10, 11, 
and 12 on a cross-sectional basis. By this procedure information would 
be made available on pupil withdrawal by grade levels. Statistics would 
show how many pupils transfer, are excluded, are excused, or withdraw 
voluntarily from school in grades 9-12, 

A minimum of 5 years would be required to accumulate statistical 
evidence indicative of the school’s holding power and drop-out rate if

the study is carried out on both a cross-sectional and a longitudinal 
basis. 

Representatives of school systems interested in determining the 
holding power and drop-out rate for an individual school or total school 

p 

system will agree upon a uniform system of accounting and report their 
individual findings to a central clearing house. 

Three types of comparison are suggested. 

1. Comparison of drop-out rate in all schools in a single city. 

2. Comparison of total drop-out rates among cities. 

3. Comparison of drop-out rates in schools of similar type among 
cities. 

Proposal No. 2 : Pupil Follow-Up Studies 

What is Proposed ? All schools participating in a study such as this will 
need to reach agreement on pupil characteristics such ass educational 
status, intellectual status, interests, physical status and health, and 
social and personality adjustment, and arrive at methods of recording 
and measurement. From these data, equated groups of graduates and drop¬ 
outs will be studied two or three years after graduation of the class 
group of which all pupils were formerly a part, to determine short-range 
adjustment to work, family living and citizenship. 

A minimum of five years are required for this type of follow-up. 
Researchers will be interested in two types of pupil adjustment: 

1. The adjustment of graduates and non-graduates to in-school 


2 


Ibid., p. 23 








situations 


2. The adjustment of graduates and non-graduates to out-of¬ 
school situations# 

Cooperating schools will need to decide upon the criteria of what 
is to constitute satisfactory adjustment# By studying data on equated 
groups through follow-up questionnairs and interviews, schools will be 
able to arrive at a basis for prognosis of in-school and out-of-school 
adjustment, graduation, and early school leaving. 

Proposal No. 3 » Long-Term Case Study Related to Drop-Outs 

A. The purposes of such a study are: 

1. To determine characteristics which are most significant 
in successful school adjustment and factors which tend to reduce the 
number of school leavers. 

2. To reveal factors in early school history which tend to 
result in leaving school before high school graduation. 

3. To provide techniques of in-service education for groups 
of teachers who work in different cities on common problems on a case 
work basis. 

B. For each superintendent who chooses to participate this will 
involve: 

1. The selection of a number of first and seventh grade 
teachers who will begin the study with the pupils assigned to them in 
September of a given year. There should be a total of at least 100 
pupils selected in each grade group.

2. Training these teachers in the nature, purpose and 


significance of this study. 

3. A form filled out by each teacher which will star each 
pupil as a person who will be followed through school until he drops out 
or graduates from high school. 

U. The assignment of one person in each system who will 
work with the teachers concerned and who may need to meet at intervals 
with similarly assigned personnel in other cooperating cities. 

5. Long-term goals which will tend to reveal the kinds of 
teachers and techniques which affect positively or negatively symptoms 
which may lead to dropping out. 

6. The designation of a central clearing house for this study 

7. At intervals reports by the clearing agency to indicate 
the progress being made by the pupils. 

C. This will, it is hoped, result in: 

1. A new awareness by principals and teachers of factors 
affecting drop-outs which lie beyond the scope of the school but which 
very often can be controlled by the school. 

2. New insights and techniques which will enable teachers to 
be more effective in remedying situations which induce pupils to drop 
out of school, 

3. A final summary of what has happened to all the pupils 
in the study,

desirable to ensure greatest validity, even though this limits the study 
to sampling procedures. In addition to interviewing the pupil, it would 
be desirable wherever possible to secure supplementary data from 
employers, teachers, family, friends, and others. 

3. Questionnaire - this technique, though not as desirable 
as a personal interview, may be profitably employed for more extended 
coverage and where facilities and resources are limited. 

RECOMMENDATIONS 

1. All pupils should be oriented to the follow-up program while 
still in school, with particular emphasis in the exit interview, so 
that they will understand its objectives and be willing to cooperate. 

2. Participating schools should agree on minimum school record 
data which will provide common information on each pupil to be followed 
up. 

From this review of drop-out proposals by the Chicago Conference, 
the following features appear to be necessary to a sound study of early 
school leavers. These features are recommended as the basis of research 
in this field in Alberta. 

1. Earge sample s. 

2* A. Full objective data to include school scholastic reading 
ability, intelligence, attendance, age, grade, retardation, and health. 

B. Employment of the personal interview with pupils and by 
interviews or reports from parents, members of the school staff, 
employers and friends, to attempt to ascertain the following:

c. Education since leaving school 

d. Employment experiences 

e. Personal and family status 

f• Participation in community affairs 

g. Work habits, personality traits, attitudes, goals, 

and values. 

3. As a basis for comparison, there should be a follow-up study 
which would include an equal number of pupils who remained in school. 

It has been shown that these pupils oftentimes make a more significant 
and reliable appraisal of the services rendered to them by the school 
than do those pupils who were early leavers. 

lw The best design would be to include both the longitudinal 
and the cross-sectional aspects. Very often, however, because of such 
considerations as time and finance, a horizontal, one year experiment is 
necessary. 

The following are more exact suggestions for research studies: 

1. A follow-up of pupils one, three and five years out of school. 

Objective: to isolate the stated reasons why drop-outs 
leave school and to compare the factors associated with these reasons in 
an effort to apply remedial methods. 

Methods: a. Control group (graduates) compared with 
experimental group (drop-outs). 

b. Interviews with graduates and drop-outs. 




275 


c. Comparison through case studies 

2. A study of the reliability of reasons which drop-outs give 
for leaving school. 

Objective: to test the consistency of stated reasons. 

Method: free association questions through interview at 2 to 
4 month interval. 

3. A study of interest or motivation as it affects school leaving. 

Objective: to isolate, if possible, what effect achievable, 

discernable goals have upon pupils whd otherwise leave school. 

Method: the study of adolescents vulnerable to school leaving 
who have made rational vocational decisions compared with similar groups 
who have made no vocational choices. 

4* A study of entering high school students maintaining a 
continuous record of graduates and drop-outs using those variables now 
known to be associated with elimination from school, namely, retardation, 
socio-economic status, school learning ability, unusual home conditions, 
age, marks, transiency, as well as others. 

Objective: to maintain a running record of a selected group 
of pupils to determine the exact conditions preceding decision to leave 
school. 

Method: carefully maintained cumulative records. Anecdotal 
material for teachers. Home visits. Use of pupil-personnel services. 

5. A study, continuing for as long a period as possible of a 
group of pupils entering kindergarten. 

Objective: to identify whether vulnerability to school

SUMMARY 

The causes of early elimination from school are complex* Not only 
are there interrelated factors which are associated with school leaving 
but these factors vary in degree and influence at any time in the life 
of a particular student. This interrelationship among variables 
affecting the school drop-out indicates that research must launch a more 
comprehensive attack upon this problem. 

It is recommended that school systems proceed with a cooperative 
study in a high school or a group of high schools in each city in which 
records are carefully maintained. By varied procedures they must isolate 
the real reasons, which may or may not be what the student says, for all 
drop-outs. This research shoU34 also be devoted to a study of the 
factors which have been shown to be associated with the school leaver, 
such as retardation and failure, amount of extra-curricular participation, 
instability of residence, economic level, a feeling of nonacceptance, 
degree of understanding on the part of students and parents of the value 
of education, and others.

The ultimate scope of the follow-up of the status of each include 
as complete knowledge of the status of each individual at each age level 
as it is possible to secure. This can be obtained in part by means of 
the continuing census used in many cities. Another method is the mail 
response inquiry useful in obtaining factual data. 

There must also be more detailed study, through interviews by 
the sampling method, of the qualitative factors not revealed by the 
census or survey type of investigation. 

The characteristics of research on drop-outs as outlined in this 
summary, along with the four features recommended elsewhere in this 
chapter, should set the broad frame-work of a provincial study in 
Alberta. Modifications and adaptations would need to be made in terms 
of the various communities under study.
