CHAPTER I 


INTRODUCTION 


In the history of the world there has never been greater 
need for higher education and educational opportunity than at 
the present time. Organized industry, scientific farming, econ¬ 
omic security, co-operative enterprises, political responsibil¬ 
ities and educational requirements for war-time jobs have made 
it almost imperative that our youth of today receive at least a 
secondary-school education. As the tempo of living increases 
the need for higher education becomes more urgent. 

The problem of secondary education in rural areas seems 
to be best met by the adoption of the Larger Unit of Adminis¬ 
tration. A study of the Miniota experiment, Canada*s first 
experience with the Larger Unit, Manitoba 1925, as well as a 
knowledge of Larger Administrative Units since formed, is con¬ 
vincing proof for this statement. 

The following excerpt, written about rural conditions in 
Manitoba seventeen years ago, is sufficiently applicable to con¬ 
ditions in various provinces of Canada today to be worthy of 
review: 

“Thirty per cent of the farm boys and girls of Manitoba, 
and a larger percentage in Saskatchewan and Alberta, are 
limited in their educational opportunities to the train¬ 
ing afforded by the ungraded one-teacher country school. 

That is their limitation unless their parents are finan¬ 
cially able to send them away to school. There are 1541 
of these one-room rural schools in Manitoba, and accord¬ 
ing to departmental figures, the majority of the pupils 
enrolled never go beyond grade sis. Only a few get any 

high school training and then seldom beyond grade nine. 

The ungraded school does not permit of effective high 
school work. 

"On the other hand, the boys and girls in the cities, 
towns, villages and many consolidated districts have the

"opportunity of a thorough elementary and high school 
training without any special financial burden being 
imposed upon their parents. 

"These facts indicate a fundamental source of dissatis¬ 
faction with rural life. It is a constant source of 
regret to thousands of fathers and mothers on the farm 
that they are not able to provide their boys and girls 
with the advantages of a good educational foundation. 

Many families have left the farm and moved to the towns 
or cities when they would much prefer farm life, solely 
for the purpose of securing educational advantages for 
their children. 1,1 

In the Miniota area 1919, there were 60 pupils in the 
high school grades, or 14.35 per cent of the total enrollment. 
The proportion of girls to boys in the high school grades was 
in the ratio of three to two. After five years under the new 
system the percentage of the total enrollment in the high school 
grades had reached 20.70 per cent, nearly three times the aver¬ 
age for the province. At the same time the number of boys tak¬ 
ing high school work was practically equal to the number of 
girls. This increase in high school enrollment resulted in more 
students registering for post-high school studies and in high 
school instruction being offered in a greater number of schools 
than before the reorganization. In addition to these consider¬ 
ations the Miniota board, to accommodate these students, paid 
up to $50.00 for fees and board. 

These facts demonstrate clearly that this type of 
country-school organization not only provides an opportunity 
for secondary education superior to that provided prior to the

formation of the Larger Unit, but also that parents on the farm 
eagerly seek and take advantage of any opportunity which will 
assist them in giving additional education to their children. 

While the Larger Unit in Canada was originally created 
for the improvement of elementary education, it achieves the 
same purpose for secondary education. This report will attempt 
to reveal the opportunities offered by the Larger Unit for the 
development of elementary education. It will in this way at¬ 
tempt, also, to indicate the advantages offered in furthering 
secondary-school education.

CHAPTER II 


A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE LARGER ADMINISTRATIVE UNIT 


The Report of the Commission on the Larger School Unit, 

Halifax, Nova Scotia, 1939, contains the following quotation 

regarding the early history of the Larger Unit: 

M In looking for a solution to the financial and educa¬ 
tional problems of the rural sections, the Commission 
could not fail to be impressed by the movement taking 
place all over the world toward a larger area of 
school support and administration• Oyer thirty years 
ago England and Wales abandoned the small school dist¬ 
rict and now have only 313 school boards for a popula¬ 
tion of forty-one million people - approximately one 
board to each 125,000 of population. • Scotland carries 
on the educational business of five million people 
through thirty-six boards. 

M 0n this side of the Atlantic, one can see the same 
trend taking place in the United States, where in 
twenty states the school district has been replaced by 
the county as the unit of school finance. A number of 
other states have adopted the "town" or township com¬ 
prising from eight to fifty school districts, as the 
unit for all administration purposes. In one state, 

Delav/are, all the schools outside the city of Wilming¬ 
ton are financed by the state treasury. One is almost 
safe in prophesying that in one decade the Larger Unit 
will be either mandatory or optional in all the states 
of the Union. It is to be noted in the United States 
that in many cases the school district has been re¬ 
tained for administrative purposes. There, as in Can¬ 
ada, the school section is deeply rooted and no change 
in the financial set-up could ignore the great value 
of the school meeting in maintaining the interest of 
the rural community in its local school and in educa¬ 
tion generally. 

M In Canada, the idea of the Larger Unit received its 
first concrete expression in Manitoba over twenty 
years ago. Under optional legislation, a school board 
was established in Miniota municipality to replace the 
boards of trustees in a number of school districts. 
Although the municipal board made a success of the 
work, the time was not ripe for the change and only 
one other municipal school board was established. In 
the 1920*s the idea spread slowly and was advanced in 
reports and public addresses by leading educationists 
and prominent laymen. The rural districts were still 
suspicious, however, and as late as 1925 a Township

"Education Bill introduced in the Ontario Legislature 
by the Uon. George A. Ferguson, then Premier and Min¬ 
ister of Education, met defeat." 

The province of British Columbia made the next progres 
sive step in 1934. The Peace River area was selected for the 
experiment and the municipality was chosen as the most effect¬ 
ive administrative unit. Dr. W.A. Plenderleith, Inspector of 
Schools, surveyed the accomplishments of the unit and issued a 
detailed report in 1936. In July, 1933, there were sixty- 
three local districts in operation, each responsible for the 
administration of affairs within its own boundaries; in Septem 
ber, 1934, the first Larger Unit of rural school administra¬ 
tion was organized and included thirty-nine former school dis¬ 
tricts; in October, 1935, the unit was enlarged to include all 
the land in the inspectoral district. The Matsqui-Sumas- 
Abbotsford Administrative Unit was established later. The pub 
licity resulting from these progressive enterprises revived 
interest in the Larger Unit and investigating committees were 
appointed in a number of provinces. 

In 1934 the Alberta Government appointed an impartial 
committee to make an intensive survey of rural educational 
conditions throughout the province. The report of this com¬ 
mittee to the Legislative Assembly was favorable to the estab¬ 
lishment of the Larger Administrative Unit. In 1935, there¬ 
fore, the Assembly amended The School Act giving the Minister 
of Education authority to constitute two or more school dis¬ 
tricts into a union of school districts under one board. 

Turner Valley and Berry Creek were then established as

experimental units. They were so completely successful that 
the Assembly, 1936, enacted Part XVII of The School Act* 

This new legislation made full provision for the establishment 
of larger Units of Administration. In 1937 there were eleven 
Larger Units comprising a total of 744 rural school districts; 
in November, 1941, the last School Division to be constituted 
under the present programme was formed.^ 

In Ontario the Larger Administrative Unit is gaining in 
favor. The Unit adopted is the township, which in size is mid¬ 
way between the school section and the municipality and just 
large enough to maintain a rural high school with additional 

services. In 1937 there were five such units; in 1941 there 

2 

were 130 Township School Areas. 

Numerous reports describe pioneer work in the estab¬ 
lishment of the Larger Units in Quebec, New Brunswick and Nova 
Scotia. The Report of the Quebec Protestant Educational Sur¬ 
vey, conducted by W.A.F. Hepburn, District Inspector of Educa¬ 
tion for Ayrshire, Scotland, has done much to create interest 
in the Large Administrative U n it through the province of Quebec. 
The Plenderleith Report on Ring’s County Educational Survey 
contains the following quotation: 

"However, little reflection is needed to show that 
the conditions which gave rise to the small school 
district have in many cases disappeared and that 
this method of administering education is adequate

’’except in those parts of the country where pion¬ 
eer conditions still prevail. Adequate equipment 
and instruction in physical training, home econ¬ 
omics, vocational education, together with proper 
medical, dental and library services are necessary 
parts of any adequate educational system. All 
these services, like other services, are quite im¬ 
possible or hopelessly inefficient in the small 
one-teacher school district. . , In addition to 
its greater cost, the present system results in ex¬ 
treme and unfair inequalities of opportunity . . . 
For the above reasons the surveyors have recommend¬ 
ed that New Brunswick adopt the county as the unit 
of school administration, except in cities, muni¬ 
cipal areas and towns.”

CHAPTER III 


ADVANTAGES OF THE LARGER UNIT 


(1) Effects Upon Secondary Education . The following 
quotation 1 summarizes the most important effects upon second¬ 
ary education following the reorganization of the Province of 
Alberta into Larger Administrative Units, called Divisions: 

"All the divisions, without exception, have been 
faced with the problem of providing increased high 
school facilities. Due to the difference in local 
conditions, the problem has been met in various ways. 
However, all the divisions have found it advisable to 
co-operate with the villages, towns and cities in or 
near the division in order to secure the advantages 
of their already well organized systems* Without 
doubt, the presence of pupils from the divisions and 
the prompt payment of their fees enables the schools 
in the villages and towns to give a better type of 
service. Thirty-four divisions pay full statutory 
fees for all pupils, including those in Grade XII, 
attending high schools. They also pay all fees for 
correspondence courses. These are, in some instances, 
conditional upon satisfactory work by the students. 

One division pays fees to a city district to the 
amount of fifty dollars per student. Many divisions 
co-cperate with village and town districts under 
various agreements arrived at after joint conferences. 
Throughout the Province the divisions have set up 
sixty-four rooms for the express purpose of giving 
additional high school services in parts remote from 
existing town and village schools. Returns show that 
the divisions provided for 5,582 pupils in Grades 
from IX to XII in the June term of 1939; in the first 
term of the next school year the number had increased 
to 6,385. Three divisions use vans to take the 
pupils from their homes to high school centres. 

Other divisions provide dormitories for the accommoda¬ 
tion of students while they are attending high school. 

The total number of these being operated is ten. The 
divisions have adopted the general policy of provid¬ 
ing a high school course for every pupil who wishes to

"take advantage of it. If the pupil cannot attend 
a high school, he has the privilege of taking a 
correspondence course, the fees for which are paid 
from the funds of the division." 

(2) Health Services. In many cities dental inspec¬ 
tion and treatment are a part of the school programme. Many 
Divisions in Alberta have provided somewhat similar health 
services which vary in extent from periodic health inspec¬ 
tions to the establishment of well-organized Health Units. 

High school students within the Larger Units are given medical 
inspection as a regular part of this health programme. 

(3) Improved Library Facilities. The library in the 
average rural school of Alberta received scant attention prior 
to the reorganization of the Province into Larger Administra¬ 
tive Units. As a result of the introduction of Progressive 
Education into the Province and the adoption of a new pro¬ 
gramme of studies, adequate libraries had to be provided in 
each operating school. The basic libraries in some of the 
better located Divisions were equipped immediately with refer¬ 
ence books and proper reading material. Divisions also make 
yearly additions to the basic library and have introduced 
travelling libraries. To provide for this accommodation the 
Division is divided into zones with a definite number of 
schools in each. Through the co-operation of the teachers in 
each zone, books are transferred periodically from school to 
school according to a prepared schedule. A complete set of 
Grade IX and Grade X texts (Grade X may be taught in the one- 
roomed rural school under certain conditions) may be trans¬ 
ferred at the beginning of each year to schools where these 








- 10 - 


grades are taught. 

(4) Effective Placement of Teachers . It is quite pos¬ 
sible that the board of a small district might hire a teacher 
who is neither congenial to the community nor qualified to 
teach. This is still possible, though highly improbable, 
where the Divisional Board, on the expert advice of the super¬ 
intendent, does the hiring. However, if it be known that the 
teacher and the community are not in agreement, the teacher 
may be moved to another school in the Division. Teachers with 
inadequate qualifications may be placed in schools where they 
can give the most efficient service. Inexperienced teachers 
may be placed in schools of low enrollment. Where Grade IX 

or higher grades are taught, experienced and qualified teach¬ 
ers may be placed in charge. 

(5) Economy . The adoption of the Larger Unit of Ad¬ 
ministration can result in a programme of saving not possible 
in the smaller unit. The bulk purchase of fuel, supplies and 
equipment; the placing of group fire insurance and the elimin¬ 
ation of multiple banking charges and other costs of adminis¬ 
tration are a few illustrations of the savings effected. In 
some of the Larger Units of British Columbia, as well as in 
those of Alberta, there has been reduction of transportation 
cost through the purchase of buses by the Division. The addi¬ 
tional costs of transportation by vans have been offset by the 
savings resulting from a decrease in the number of teachers 
employed.

(6) Standardization of Schools and Equipment . A sur¬ 
vey of rural schools throughout Canada would reveal that they 
are of varying shapes and sizes and constructed of many dif¬ 
ferent kinds of material. The adoption of the Larger Unit of 
Administration would curtail this variation at least through¬ 
out that area controlled by the unit. Schools and equipment 
might be moved from one district to another according to 
local needs. This is a regular practice adopted in some of 
the Divisions in the south-eastern part of Alberta as the de¬ 
crease in population has necessitated the closing of a number 
of schools. In this area, subject to variations in popula¬ 
tion, one or two Divisions have adopted the policy of tearing 
down outmoded schools and erecting new and smaller schools so 
built that they may be moved from one district to another as 
the needs of that immediate area dictate. 

Some superintendents have so staggered the time 
tables of their divisional high schools that the maximum use 
of science equipment and laboratory supplies may be obtained 
by transferring these materials yearly from school to school. 

(7) Better Attendance . The average attenda.nce of 
pupils in the province of Alberta for 1938 was 89.50$; for 
1939, 90.33$; and for 1940, 90.24$ of the total monthly en¬ 
rollment. There has been a noticeable increase each year in 
the percentage of attendance. The figure for 1939 represents 
the highest percentage of attendance in Alberta's history. 

Much of this improvement in attendance may be attributed to 
the added interest and enthusiasm resulting from the abolition

- 12 - 


of the smaller unit system* 

(8) Improvement In Teacher's Position. The teacher 
in Alberta now enjoys a feeling of security and permanence in 
his position. This was not common under the system of local 
school administration. The Divisional Board has a sympathet¬ 
ic understanding of the teacher*s position in a community and 
is in a position, through the superintendent, to advise and 
encourage the teacher who is at variance with the parents of 
the district in which he works. Moreover, there is a reduc¬ 
tion in the possibility of friction between teachers and 
trustees or ratepayers by the simple expedient of an exchange 
of teachers. 

The unification resulting from Larger Unit Administra¬ 
tion paves the way for the adoption of salary schedules. 
Regulations in The School Act, Alberta, stipulate that all 
school boards prepare and adopt a salary schedule. To initi¬ 
ate this programme, a committee from the Alberta School 
Trustees* Association met with representatives of the A.T.A. 
to draw up a basic salary schedule after which all other 
schedules might be patterned. The statutory minimum salary 
of $840.00, together with qualification and teaching experi¬ 
ence, formed bases for negotiation. All schedules are sub¬ 
mitted to the Department of Education for the approval of the 
minister. There is no doubt that morale and teaching effic¬ 
iency are improved by virtue of the salary schedule. Compar¬ 
ative salary increases, a result of Larger Unit formation, 
may be noted in Table I.

The limited resources of the small unit of administra¬ 
tion often meant that the teacher's salary wasn't always paid 
on time. It was not uncommon for teachers employed by boards 
of smaller units to have several months' back salary due them 
at the end of the term. Now, however, under the Larger Unit 
of Administration,salaries are paid promptly and in full as 
the increased resources of the Divisions make possible bank 
loans and more regular income. 

(9) Board Meetings . There is considerable uniformity 
as to the composition and duties of the boards of Larger Units 
that have been thus formed. Members of these boards represent 
from ten to twenty districts and are usually known for their 
integrity and willingness to give public service. Meetings 
are held once a month and are attended by the superintendent 
who gives the board the benefit of his expert advice. 

(10) Increased Supervision. The reorganization of the 
Province of Alberta into Larger Units resulted in the forma¬ 
tion of Divisions which are smaller in area than the old in¬ 
spectorates. The number of superintendents in the Province 
has, therefore, increased, so that each superintendent is now 
responsible for the supervision of a fewer number of teachers. 
This means that the supervisors may now become more familiar 
with the needs of teachers and give help where it is most 
needed. 

(11) Causes of Local friction Removed . The annual 
meeting of ratepayers under the system of local administration 
was often the outstanding educational feature of the year. It

offered an excellent opportunity to bring community prejudices 
to the fore. There was frequent quarrelling over the control 
of administration and too often the teacher was dragged into 
the bickering, much against his will. The Larger Unit offers 
partial opportunity to avoid this strife as it has been to 
some extent responsible for smoothing over and in some cases 
erasing local causes of friction. With a popular cause of 
strife removed, the people of local districts are, more than 
ever, learning to live in peace and harmony with each other. 

(12) Minor Services of the Larger Unit . Progressive 
Education can be introduced more easily and more quickly where 
a unified service is maintained. In Alberta, because of this 
unification, desks are no longer screwed to the floor in 
schools of the Divisions; sand and work tables have been in¬ 
stalled; pianos, organs, gramophones and records are more 
easily supplied and distributed; text books may be given out 
to pupils on a rental basis; supplies such as chalk, foolscap, 
scissors, art paper etc. are distributed immediately as month¬ 
ly requisition forms are received at the divisional office 
from teachers in charge of schools, 

(13) School Year Increased in Length . Prior to the 
formation of the Larger Units in Alberta, many school boards, 
for financial and other reasons, were unable to keep their 
schools open during the full year. Now, however, that almost 
all rural schools in the Province are under the influence of 
the divisional system, they remain in operation throughout 
the entire school year.

(14) Taxation Equalized . In Alberta, the Divisional 
Board relies for its funds upon a collecting agency which is 
either the municipality or the local improvement district. 
After the budget is laid down for the year the Division requi¬ 
sitions the various collecting agencies within its boundaries 
in direct proportion to the assessment within each area. In 
other words, if the Divisional Board requires a certain sum of 
mon&y for operational expenses during the year which necessi¬ 
tates a levy of ten mills on the entire assessment of the 

Division, the secretary of the Divisional Board notifies the 
various collecting agencies to this effect. 

After due consideration of school debts and reserves, 















- 17 - 


municipalities then levy an educational or school tax suffi¬ 
cient to meet the requisition from the divisional office. 

In time all school debts and reserves carried by municipal¬ 
ities will have been eliminated. When this time comes there 
will be an approximate equalization of school tax rate with¬ 
in the Division. 

The following table 1 illustrates '’the wide variation 
of mill rates in school districts before their inclusion in 
Divisions and the approximate equalization which took place 
in the taxes after the inclusion."

assessment and taxing authorities. With the adoption of the 
Larger Unit there is immediately a simplification in the 
system of levying and collecting taxes. As long as the small 
unit exists, provision can be made for elementary and inter¬ 
mediate school education only. Parents desirous of having 
their children attend high school must purchase accommodation 
from village, town or city schools. With the adoption of the 
Larger Unit of Administration the training of high school 
students within its boundaries becomes the responsibility of 
the Divisional Board. If the Divisional Board cannot provide 
this service, arrangements must be made with village, town or 
city high schools at little or no cost to the parents. 

(15) Social Living . Probably the greatest advantage 
of the Larger Unit is its contribution to social living. Be¬ 
cause of the facilities offered by the Larger Unit for 
secondary education more students are attending school at 
larger centres. Rural children are mingling with urban child¬ 
ren and the social barriers which at one time were quite mani¬ 
fest between these two groups are rapidly breaking down. The 
Larger Administrative Unit offers excellent opportunity for 
the development and maintenance of the democratic spirit 
which is an important aspect of English social life at the 
present time.

CHAPTER IV 


REFUTATION OF WEAKNESSES IN THE LARGER 
ADMINISTRATIVE UNIT 

(l) Increased Cost . It is possible under the Larger 
Administrative Unit to give to the smaller school districts 
the same service which they enjoyed prior to their inclusion 
in the Division or Larger Unit, and at a greatly reduced 
cost. However, as the service offered by the Larger Unit is 
usually better and more varied, an increased cost over that 
involved in the operation of the smaller districts is to be 
expected, literature pertaining to the Peace River Unit of 
British Columbia, a number of Divisions in Alberta, e.g. 
Berry Creek and Turner Valley, and Larger Administrative 
Units of the United States and other countries reveals that 
increased cost accompanies increased service. Reduced ex¬ 
penditure resulting from fewer local board officials, bank 
charges, audit charges etc. does not offset greater disburse 
ment by way of increased supervision, increased salaries of 
teachers, health support, building programmes, high school 
maintenance etc. 

In attempting to establish rural educational condi¬ 
tions comparable with those in town and city schools, sal¬ 
aries were increased proportionate to increased living costs 
increased expenditures were made on the repair and erection 
of buildings and improved facilities, necessary to the new 
educational programme, were immediately made available to 
elementary, intermediate and high school students. Where

high school facilities were lacking in a thickly populated 
communit, a divisional high school had to be provided. In 
more isolated communities high school fees had to be paid and 
where the situation was such to demand it, conveyance or cor¬ 
respondence courses had to be arranged. Upon consideration of 
this added service an increased cost is to be anticipated. 

TABLE IV 1 

INCREASED COST OF EDUCATION WITHIN THE PROVINCE 


Total cost of operation of rural schools, 1936..$3,368,177.00 


Average cost per room (3,436 rooms) . 981.98 

Total cost of operation of rural schools, 1939.. 3,512,618.00 
Average cost per room (3,142 rooms in 44 

Divisions), 1939 . 1,117.95 

Total cost of operation of rural schools, 1940 4,319,483.00 

Average cost per room (3,442 rooms in 48 

Divisions), 1940 . 1,254.93 


“The comparison between the average cost per classroom 
in 1936 and 1940 is unfair to the Divisions in that it 
does not take into account increased operation and 
growth in the enrollment and attendance of pupils as a 
result of the improvements in educational facilities 

brought about by Divisional Boards.As a matter 

of fact, the cost per pupil per year according to aver¬ 
age attendance and the average cost per pupil for each 
day in attendance was less in Divisions in 1937-38 and 
1938-39 than the corresponding costs in rural schools 
not included in Divisions in the same years.”

The figures (Table V) for the years 1937-38 and 1938-39 
are comparable for the important reason that at this time ap¬ 
proximately half the schools in Alberta were in School Divi¬ 
sions and the other half in rural schools not included in 
Divisions . 

The figures from the upper half of the same table for 
the last two years are emphatically not comparable. The 
schools upon which these figures are based are in outlying 
portions of the Province, namely in western and northern 


# First eleven Divisions began operation January, 1937. No 
figures available for school year 1936-37. 






















,

Alberta. Schools in these areas are poorly constructed, the 
teachers* salaries are low and the enrollment heavy. (It is 
not uncommon for a school in the Athabasca Inspectorate and 
not included in a Division, to have an attendance of 40 to 60 
pupils under the direction of one teacher.) That the average 
cost per pupil per attendance day in rural schools not now in¬ 
cluded in a Division is low is not surprising. 

On the other hand, similar costs per pupil in schools 
within Divisions are increasing and will probably continue to 
increase. The indebtedness of many of the smaller units in 
outlying areas recently organized into Divisions is heavy. In¬ 
creased service in these Divisions has also increased the cost 
of operation proportionately. In consideration of these and 
other factors, the figures for the last two years included in 
Table V may now be more readily understood. 

(2) Inequalities in School Tax Load . The criticism 
has been levelled against the Larger Unit that there will 
still continue to exist inequalities in the school tax load 
arising out of differences in the assessed valuation of land 
as between different school taxing units. The school tax in 
Alberta, it has been maintained, varies in the different Divi¬ 
sions from 9 to 16 mills. While this is true, one must not 
neglect to consider two very important factors. In the first 

place the municipal taxing unit is considerably larger than 
the local school district taxing unit and allows an equality 

of tax rate not permitted before. In the second place there 

is in Alberta a progressive step being taken to enlarge the 















'

, 




























- 23 - 


municipal area and make it conform in size and shape with the 
Divisional Unit already established. This step would enlarge 
the taxing area still more and practically eliminate any 
criticism on this point. 

(3) Interference With Democratic Rights . Those in 
opposition to the Larger Unit argue that its adoption is a dir 
ect blow to democratic principles. These persons base their 
argument upon the assumption that in some provinces the unit 
has been forced upon the people and that the central board 
arrangement is less democratic than the local board system. 

No doubt this contention has been exaggerated. It must be con 
ceded that democracy functions most truly where the interests 
of all are best served and where equality of educational privi 
leges is maintained and supported. This was not characterist¬ 
ic of the smaller district unit as progressive farmers were 
the only residents able to send their children to a town or 
city high school. With the adoption of the Larger Unit, how¬ 
ever, educational opportunity approaches equality as all boys 
and girls are assisted in gaining educational opportunity 
beyond the narrow scope of their local district boundaries. 

Larger Units are in realit3r more democratic than the 
smaller units, not only because of the principles mentioned 
above, but also because of what are considered the outward 

marks of democracy. In the Larger Unit the board is still 
elected by the people. Ratepayers can re-elect or dismiss a 
board just as readily as they can under the smaller unit 
system. Moreover, the board of the Larger Unit has many

'

' 





- 24 - 


democratic points of superiority. A democracy wishes those 
in authority chosen by the will of the people. The Larger Unit 
permits choice of board members from a wider area and so allows 
greater freedom of choice. Persons of experience and outstand¬ 
ing ability are elected to office by popular vote. Decidedly, 
the Larger Unit is as democratic in every principle as the 
smaller and costlier local unit. 

(4) Loss of Local Interest . This criticism may be 
best answered by referring directly to Larger Units already 
established. On the whole, there has been little, if any, loss 
of local interest. The prestige of present small boards need 
not disappear as these councils can play an important part in 
contributing to the best administration possible. They can 
give valuable assistance to the central board by: assuming 
responsibility for maintenance and improvement of school prop¬ 
erty, offering advice and direction to the central board, 
initiating interest and promoting scholarships and voicing an 
opinion in the selection of teachers for their schools. The 
more interest the local board displays in the operation of its 
school the more success will the unit have. 

( 5 ) Rights of Minorities . According to the constitu¬ 
tion of the Dominion of Canada, separate schools may exist 
wherever and whenever ratepayers indicate that they are wanted. 
Care must be taken at the time the Larger Unit is established 
to see that minority rights remain inviolate. The area where¬ 
in the separate school is located may decide by popular vote 
whether or not that area will maintain independence or become

an integral part of the Larger Administrative Unit# Because 
of the advantages offered, the separate school often finds it 
beneficial to join with the Larger Unit. Special rights and 
privileges may be granted to give religious and linguistic 
instruction. The board can assist in the observance of these 
rights by appointing to such schools suitable and acceptable 

teachers. Only by the most complete co-operation can a suc- 

1 

cessful and wrothy educational organization be perfected. 

(6) Promised Health Programme. Many people condemn 
the Larger Administrative Unit on the supposition that it is 
not fulfilling the promised health programme. They contend 
that because of the importance of health to the students, 
health maintenance should be the primary service offered by a 
school board. No one can deny that the health of children is 
of primary importance, but from the viewpoint of education it 
must be strictly regarded as an added service. Consequently, 
while educational features are emphasized at first, the 
health programme may eventually become an important aspect of 
Larger Unit service. One can readily understand that all 
desirable services cannot be obtained in the early years of the 
Larger Unit, but must be gradually established. Many Divisions 
in Alberta which have been in operation but for a short time 
only, already have health units, while others have included 
health service as a part of their programme from the beginning. 

(7) Consolidation of Schools. The charge has been made 


that the Larger Unit means consolidation of schools and in¬ 
volves transportation of pupils. This need not be as the

Large r Unit means consolidation of school districts and not 
necessarily consolidation of schools. Such consolidation of 
school districts may mean a re-alinement of local schools, but 
the re-alinement will depend entirely upon meeting the needs 
of the community in the best interests of education. The mod¬ 
ern trend in education tends toward consolidation of schools. 
Dr. Clark M. Frasier, Professor of Education, Washington Col¬ 
lege of Teachers, during his recent educational tour of Al¬ 
berta, made a startling statement to the effect that over 90 % 
of the rural schools in the State of Washington, U.S.A. have 
been closed and the children transported by bus to central 
schools. The trend has been this way because consolidation of 
schools offers the best opportunity for rural school children 
to obtain better training. 

(8) Supervision Cost Increased . Uninformed persons 
while acclaiming the advantages of increased supervision, 
charge that the salary of the supervisor paid by the taxpayer 
of the Larger School Unit is added expense for which at this 
time no funds are available. True enough, increased super¬ 
vision means increased cost. However, in most of the Pro¬ 
vinces of Canada this cost is borne by the province and not by 
the Larger Unit. There are many advantages to the province in 
having a qualified educational representative in each Larger 

Administrative Unit so that not only has the province reserved 
the privilege of appointing the superintendent, but it also 
pays his salary.

CHAPTER V 


THE ALBERTA SURVEY 


During the last five years there has been a noticeable 
increase in high school attendance throughout the Province of 
Alberta, The following table supports this statement: 

TABLE VI 

PERCENTAGE HIGH SCHOOL ATTENDANCE IN ALBERTA

This increase, particularly during the four years 1936- 
1940, may be partially attributed to the formation of Larger 
Units and to the reconstruction of the high school curriculum. 

Table VII represents the percentage attendance in high 
school grades in Divisions during the same five years:

In determining these figures, high school students 
from Divisions who attended high schools elsewhere were not in¬ 
cluded, The higher percentage attendance for the first year, 
1936-1937 may be explained by the fact that high school stu¬ 
dents enrolled in one room rural schools made jip a considerable 
portion of the high school enrollment in the province. In the 
years following, however, high school tuition was not permitted 
in rural schools. During the past four years there has been a 
gradual increase in the number of students attending high 
schools in Divisions as Divisional Boards are making a deter¬ 
mined effort to increase facilities necessary to meet the de¬ 
mands of rural students for high school accommodation. 

Tables VIII, IX, X, XI and XII were charted from fig¬ 
ures obtained from the Department of Education, Edmonton, 
Alberta. Though not entirely conclusive, they are, neverthe¬ 
less, worthy of study.

In an endeavor to ascertain more fully, and to some 
extent more accurately, the specific contribution of the Lar¬ 
ger Unit to the development of secondary education, a ques¬ 
tionnaire, reproduced below, was mailed to each superintendent 
in the province for completion. In the first of two surveys 
48 questionnaires were mailed and 31 returned, so that the 
date compiled from them should be fairly representative of 
the province.

There was, according to figures received from the 
thirty-one superintendents, an increased attendance in Divi¬ 
sions frc*n 2,025 to 2,457 students in Grade IX over a period 
of three years, 1938-1939 to 1940-1941, One explanation for 
this great increase is the fact that Grade IX is no longer a 
high school grade. Other explanations are the curriculum 
reorganization and/or the new administrative system. Similar 
increases in Grade X, Grade XI and Grade XII attendance may 
be explained on the same basis. 

Surprisingly the figures in the above tables reveal 
that in Grade XII attendance shows the greatest increase. 

This is in accordance with figures submitted from the thirty- 
one Divisions. In 1938-1939 the number of Grade XII students 
enrolled was 805, in 1940-1941 there was an attendance of 
1095, or an increase of 36.0$. So large an increase over so 
short a period of time cannot be explained in terms of in¬ 
creased population alone. 

In a second survey, 1941, replies were obtained from 
forty-three divisional superintendents. Prom this survey it 
was learned that the forty-three Divisional Boards have pro¬ 
vided, in addition to those already in operation, a total of 
90 high school rooms. These do not include rooms with mixed 
high and intermediate or elementary grades in two room 

schools which have replaced one room units to provide some 
secondary training in remote areas. 

The average cost per pupil for instruction in Grades 
X, XI and XII varies from Division to Division. Because of

difficulty in securing accurate figures, many superintendents 
failed to answer this question. So few replies were receiv¬ 
ed, in fact, that it would serve no purpose to quote the 
figures• 

An important service rendered by the Larger Unit is 
the ability to institute and equip General Shop and Household 
Economics rooms. The forty-three Divisions have equipped 
forty-one General Shop rooms and forty Household Economics 
rooms. This is no mean undertaking as there is involved the 
maintenance of at least one extra room for each course, the 
hiring of qualified teachers and the expenditure of thousands 
of dollars for tools and equipment. 

The Regulations of the Department of Education permit 
a high school student to obtain Matriculation, Normal Ent¬ 
rance, or a High School Diploma by successfully completing 
the three years of prescribed courses. Certain compulsory 
subjects are required of all students. The number of academic 
electives varies according to the type of diploma desired, 
general electives may then be selected by the student to com¬ 
plete the necessary 100 credits to earn the diploma. Super¬ 
intendents and principals with foresight are successful in 
staggering the high school programme to enable the widest 
choice in these electives. Popular general electives (in ad¬ 
dition to General Shop and Household Economics) enumerated by 
the superintendents in order of preference are: Music, Type¬ 
writing, Stenography, Dramatics, Needlework, Mechanical Draw¬ 
ing and Art•

During the last six years a vast improvement has 
taken place in the qualification of teachers. There appears 
to be a mounting desire on the part of many teachers to ob¬ 
tain improved certificates or university degrees which are 
requisite to the better teaching positions with higher salar¬ 
ies. 

A few Health Units have been organized and are 
functioning so well that in many more Divisions this service 
is being established. A number of Divisions have at present a 
travelling Doctor and a travelling nurse. Some Divisional 
Boards provide periodical medical examinations and medical 
services while others have established health clinics and pro¬ 
vide immunization against smallpox and diphtheria. Fjrrst aid 
kits are placed in every school, a service which the smaller 
unit did not give. In various ways most Divisional Boards are 
providing health services favorably comparing with those of¬ 
fered in urban areas. 

Many superintendents attempted to estimate the per¬ 
centage of students enrolled in matriculation, normal entrance 
and diploma courses. The figures for each of these are as 
follows: The percentage taking matriculation courses varies 
from 2-50 per cent with the average around 21.8 per cent; 
the percentage of students taking the normal entrance course 
varies from 5-75 per cent with the average at 37.7 per cent; 

the percentage taking the diploma course is estimated to vary 
from 10 - 90 percent, the average around 38.9 per cent. The 

last figure is the important one as it indicates, at least in

some measure, the interest that students have in other than 
academic subjects. This type of course provides excellent 
material for the weaker student. 

The enrollment in correspondence courses has increased 
each year since the beginning of the reorganization of second¬ 
ary education in Alberta according to the following table:

There are many reasons for the great increase in cor¬ 
respondence courses. It is impossible for a student to receive 
credit for a high school course unless he has actually been in 
attendance at some school, or unless he has registered for cor¬ 
respondence courses. Divisional Boards have accepted res¬ 
ponsibility for paying part or all of the cost of correspondence 
courses for students within their territory who are unable to 
attend classes, or who cannot afford the expense of boarding 
away from home. Furthermore, many students unable to secure

the required options in their own schools because of the in¬ 
ability of teachers to instruct in these subjects find it 
necessary to obtain qualified instruction in these courses 
elsewhere* Correspondence courses play an important role in 
solving the problem of equalization of educational opportunity 

Ten of the forty-three Divisional Boards pay the total 
cost for correspondence courses; six require a small deposit 
from the student but if the student is entirely successful in 
his work this deposit is refunded; two Divisions pay the total 
cost for the courses but restrict the student in the number he 
may take; eight Divisions pay a limited amount and any cost 
above this stipulated figure must be assumed by the student; 
one Division pays the total cost but pays nothing for subjects 
repeated; one Division requires the parents to pay the fees 
of the students on the guarantee that refunds will be made on 
a basis of every credit actually earned. The remainder of 
the forty-three superintendents made no comment on correspond¬ 
ence work in their Divisions. 

Where it is not possible to accommodate the high 
school pupil in the Division itself, either by high school 
instruction in a rural school or by construction of a divi¬ 
sional high school, Boards will pay the tuition fees of high 
school students if they attend at centres outside the Division 
Divisional Boards are restricted by regulations in The School 
Act as to the amount of money which they may pay out in fees. 
Three Divisions in the province pay more toward grade XII 
tuition fees than The School Act permits, but on the whole the

re main ing Divisions follow government regulations in this 
respect• 

Probably one of the most popular and economical means 
adopted by Divisional Boards for the solution of the high 
school problem is the establishment of dormitories. They are 
not only an economical means of obtaining board and lodging 
for students but they also provide splendid training in co¬ 
operative living. 

There are twenty-three dormitories in operation in 
the 43 Divisions. These accommodate a total of 579 high 
school students at the fees ranging from $7.50 to $12.00 per 
month. The average monthly cost per student in the 23 dormi¬ 
tories is $9.54. The average number of students per dormitory 
is 25.2. (This figure is high because of the influence of two 
dormitories in Red Deer accommodating 121 students and of one 
dormitory in Drumheller accommodating 65 students.) Due to 
the concentration of the students under one roof, to the fur¬ 
nishing of blankets, sheets, quilts and pillows by the pupils, 
and to the contract purchase of meat, bread, milk, butter etc. 
the monthly cost per student is reduced to a minimum. 

The number of dormitories being put into use in Divi¬ 
sions is increasing each year. The experience gained from 
early experiments has been such as to encourage the develop¬ 
ment of the dormitory plan from year to year. Comments re¬ 
ceived from superintendents who have had experience with this 
type of educational enterprise are indeed favorable, so that 
it will not be surprising to see a rapid increase in dormitory

accommodation within the next few years. 

The majority of superintendents commented favorably on 
the effect of the Larger Unit of Administration upon secondary 
education and were enthusiastic about the present and future 
of the secondary school in Alberta. Mention has already been 
made of the numerous advantages that the Larger Unit offers 
for the advancement of secondary education. Other advantages 
mentioned were as follows • the provision of vans to transport 
high school students to convenient centres, the erection of 
better buildings to accommodate high school students, the 
abolition of high school instruction in the rural one-room 
school, the provision for uniform term tests throughout the 
Division, the payment of conveyance to students who travel con¬ 
siderable distances to school, the provision for teacher pro¬ 
motion which the Larger Unit offers, the speed at which high 
school accommodation may be provided, the co-operative agree¬ 
ments which may be made between the divisional and other 
boards and the better selection of matriculation students. 

This survey encourages one to comment that nowhere in 
Canada is the future of secondary education so bright as in the 
Province of Alberta. The foregoing statement is made having in 
mind the fact that the Division in Alberta is still in its in¬ 
fancy. No one can yet foretell in what direction or to what 
extent secondary education will be encouraged to develop. How¬ 
ever that may be, the Division is here to stay, if for no 
other reason than for the advantages it has placed at the door 
of the secondary school.

CHAPTER VI 


A SURVEY OF AN ALBERTA DIVISION 

The Camrose Division #20 was chosen to illustrate the 
advantages of the Larger Unit in regard to secondary educa¬ 
tion because: (1) This Division was centrally located on a 
map of Alberta School Divisions and its outlines were, there¬ 
fore, easily determined. (2) Mr. C.H. Robinson, superintend¬ 
ent of the Division, has done much work In this field, so that 
his willing assistance and co-operation in furnishing material 
was anticipated. 

The geometric centre of this Division is the town of 
Camrose, a thriving and attractive town, with several fine 
educational institutions and favorably situated in a good 
agricultural district. Like many localities in central Alberta, 
this district has never known a crop failure. The grain pro¬ 
duced is of excellent quality and many farmers on land adjacent 
to the town have produced prize-winning wheat and coarse grains. 
Mixed farming has resulted in the establishment of a number of 
creameries in nearby towns and villages. Camrose might be said 
to be ideally located in one of the most prosperous mixed- 
farming areas in Western Canada. 

The town has a population of approximately 4,500. It 
boasts a flour mill, a tannery, several wholesale distributing 
houses, three good hotels, paved streets, water works, garages, 
good homes and a fine class of people, the majority of Nor¬ 
wegian descent. Until five or six years ago one of the three

Provincial Normal Schools was in operation in Camrose, At 
present, however, this fine building serves as the Officers' 
Headquarters for the compulsory military training unit now 
established there. The Norwegian Lutheran College is both 
academic and commercial in character and attracts students 
from all parts of the province. The elementary and inter¬ 
mediate schools, originally practice institutions for the nor¬ 
mal trainees, are excellently staffed and the all but new high 
school with additional wings built in 1941, is particularly 
important from a secondary education point of view. 

From north to south the Camrose Division measures ap¬ 
proximately 50 miles and from east to west the measurement is 
approximately 30 miles. This area comprises eleven municipal¬ 
ities either wholly or in part. Two municipalities are at 
present contained completely within the Division. Approxim¬ 
ately one half of five and a small portion of four others lie 
within the boundaries of the Division. No ambiguity in tax 
collections thus results as each municipality receives a 
requisition from the secretary-treasurer of the Division in 
direct proportion to the assessment of that part of the munici¬ 
pality which lies within the Division. The Camrose Inspector¬ 
ate prior to 1938, was larger in area than the present Divi¬ 
sion. Its boundaries extended farther north and farther east. 

Sixteen school districts to the south, however, were added 
when the Division was foraed. The number of classrooms in the 

old inspectorate was 169 as compared with 122 classrooms in 

the present inspectorate, the latter including those under

direct administration of the Division as well as those of 
villages and towns not integrated with the Larger Unit. 

In establishing the boundaries of the Division, a 
commission appointed by the Department of Education considered 
requests and recommendations submitted by local school commit¬ 
tees, municipalities etc. and investigated other factors such 
as lakes, community centres, railroads, main roads and roads 
tributary to community centres. Every effort was made, in the 
establishment of boundaries, to have due regard for well pop¬ 
ulated centres: for example, to have the village of Bawlf on 
the east side of the Camrose Division, thus leaving Daysland, 
a village of fair size, on the western boundary of the adjoin¬ 
ing KiHam Division. There was no attempt made to have divi¬ 
sional boundaries coincide with municipal boundaries. 

Approximately 17,500 people reside within the Camrose 
Division. Of this number 2,950 are attending school. The 
proportion of female to male teachers is, at present, about 
6 : 2, there being 62 female and 19 male teachers in the Divi¬ 
sion. The School Act stipulates that the school year must 
consist of 200 teaching days. During 1940-1941, schools in 
the Camrose Division operated for 200 days. The average for 
the province during the same period was 190.88 days. 

Nine school districts within the Camrose Inspectorate 
are not integrated with the Division. They administer their 
own assessment, collect their own taxes, build and maintain 
their own schools and hire their own teachers. These village 
and town districts have not yet been convinced of the value

of belonging to the Larger Unit. Camrose, by far the largest 
town in the Division, is one of these. The cost of maintain¬ 
ing secondary education in Camrose is comparatively high. 

While the town itself might desire to become part of the Divi¬ 
sion, the rural areas, realizing that the inclusion of Camrose 
would proportionately increase their own educational tax, 
would probably exert sufficient pressure to prevent this step. 
This pressure would be maintained just so long as rural 
proples can obtain accommodation for their own high school 
students, at less expense, elsewhere. 

Bawlf, on the main line of the C.P.R., has a three- 
room school, one of which accommodates the high school grades 
X to XII. New Norway and Perintosh, two villages on the Cal¬ 
gary -Edmonton C.N.R. through Camrose, have similar three-room 
educational plants. Bashaw, a town situated a few miles south 
of Perintosh on the same railroad, operates a five-room school. 
Edberg, south of Camrose, a small village on a second Calgary- 
Edmonton branch of the C.N.R. through Camrose, operates a two- 
room school accommodating students to grade XI only. Hay 
Lakes, another small village northeast of Camrose on the 
C.N.R., has a similar educational plant# 

There are two one-room schools within the inspectorate 
which, so far, have not joined the Division. These schools 
are located in the villages of Ohaton and Bittern Lake. A 
comparison between these schools and any single on^-room 
school in the Division is convincing proof that these centres 
have erred in neglecting to become a part of the Division.

However, because they fear loss of autonomy In financial 
matters and teacher selection, the two units have remained 
aloof from central control. These two district will be the 
next logical addition to the Camrose Division as the type of 
service common in the larger Unit, together with the adoption 
of salary schedules etc. will be important factors in persuad¬ 
ing them to see the advantages offered by amalgamation. 

The suggestion of amalgamation, at the present time, 
would meet with opposition from people in the Division as well 
as from towns and villages outside the Division. From the 
point of view of the Division, the Larger Unit is not yet 
ready to assume the responsibility of educational facilities 
within the towns and villages, (reference is here made to the 
Camrose Division in particular) for it would be necessary to 
provide at once new high school accommodation within every town 
and village with the possible exception of Camrose and Ferin- 
tosh and those villages already within the Division. On the 
other hand, town and village school boards are loathe to sur¬ 
render the privilege of hiring their teachers, setting their 
own mill rates, collecting their taxes and in general operating 
their own affairs. 

On the whole, the school boards of these to?/ns and 
villages are co-operating in every possible manner for the bet¬ 
terment of education within the Division. The enrollment of 
town and village high schools is usually low so that, as a 
general rule, school boards of these centres are happy to ac¬ 
commodate as many students from the Division as possible.

The fees which they receive for this service are set by agree¬ 
ment between the Divisional Board and the town or village 
board, The School Act being a guide post in the fixing of fees. 
If the village school offers tuition up to and including 
grade XI, a fee of $5.00 per unit or a maximum fee of $30.00 
may be charged. If grade XII tuition is given, the charge may 
be $10.00 for the first unit and $5.00 for each additional 
unit to a total of $40.00 per student per annum. 

higher fees are often charged in many town and city 
schools as the tuition offered in these centres often warrants 
such a step. It might also be the intention of some school 
boards in towns and cities to exclude students from outside 
areas by charging a higher fee. At one time the school board 
at Camrose maintained that a $40.00 fee for a grade XII student 
was too low and resolved to raise the fee to $50.00 per student 
per year. The Divisional Board at once threatened to build a 
dormitory and a three-room high school of its own within the 
town. Both boards have since arranged a satisfactory agree¬ 
ment . 

There are many hamlets within the Division which have 
high school facilities and which are operated entirely by the 
central board. Kingman, north of Camrose, has a two-room 
school and offers grade XII, but with a restricted programme. 

Dinant, on the same railroad and nearer Camrose, has a two-room 
school also, but because of higher enrollment in the elementary 
grades, secondary education is offered in grade X only. Round 
Hill, northeast of Camrose on the C.N.r. from Camrose to

Vegreville, has a three-room school. The senior room accom¬ 
modates grade IX, X and XI students. In the two-room school 
at Duhamel, southwest of Camrose, instruction is given to stu¬ 
dents in Grade XII. This is only possible, however, because 
other high school grades are missing. 

To the east and southeast of Camrose, high school accom¬ 
modation is good. Meeting Creek has a three-room school. The 
two senior rooms have been added by the Divisional Board to ac¬ 
commodate high school students in this area. Good service is 
maintained as instruction is given to students in the two senior 
rooms from grades IX to XII. Rosalind, across the lake, has a 
three-room school also. The senior room is a divisional high 
school and accommodates students in grades X, XI and XII. On 
the southern boundary of the Division lies the consolidated 
district of Donalda to which the Camrose Division sends a num¬ 
ber of high school students. 

As the high school in the village of Hay Lakes could 
not accommodate all the students in the northwestern part of the 
Division, the Divisional Board found it necessary to construct, 
during the summer of 1941, a new two-room school at Armena, at a 
total cost of $7,986.75. Grade XI students receive instruction 
in this school. 

A study of the map of the Camrose Division included 
herein, enables one to determine at a glance that no area with¬ 
in the Division lies at any great distance from a secondary 
school of some sort. This means a great deal to those people 
residing in outlying districts who are interested in giving

their children a secondary education at a reasonable cost. 

Of the many objections to the one-room high school, 
the chief one is that the social background acquired by the 
student in attendance at such schools is of a limited nature. 
Furthermore, the student is restricted by departmental regula¬ 
tion in the number of credits that he may obtain in one year. 
This means that he must take at least one year longer to com¬ 
plete his high school training than a student who attends 
high school at a larger centre. Any student in attendance at 
a one-room high school and who intends going to Normal School 
or to University is strongly advised to take at least grade 
XII in a larger school. Such attendance enables the student 
to choose from a variety of courses and at the same time gives 
him that wider experience which may be obtained only in town 
and city schools. His cultural background is also enriched 
and the social contacts made in the larger school are invalu¬ 
able to the student in contributing to a fuller and wider out¬ 
look on life. Moreover, the course which the student gets at 
a one or two-room high school is often academic in nature. 

The possibility of town, village and divisional high schools 
combining to secure the services of travelling teachers to 
instruct in the optional subjects such as general shop and 
household economics, is limited until road conditions in the 
Division improve . This plan of procedure has been contem¬ 
plated by the Divisional Board as the success of similar pro¬ 
grammes in other Divisions has encouraged investigation. 

The possibility of establishing a central high school

for the entire Division is also somewhat remote, although 
the creation of an educational plant of this nature would be 
ideal from many points of view. The people within the Divi¬ 
sion would object to the maintenance of such an institution 
as the extra cost involved and the lack of appreciation by 
the public of the importance of equalization of educational 
opportunity would result in sufficient objection to rule out 
such a possibility. People also demand that high school ser¬ 
vice shall be in reasonable proximity to their homes. The 
assistance which the student can give in the home or on the 
farm and the problem of student supervision for children away 
from home for the first time are two factors militating 
against the central high school. Equalization of educational 
opportunity can only be attained when the student attends high 
school without additional cost to his parents. The Divisional 
Board can assist in establishing equalization of educational 
opportunity by making available to the parent a stipulated sum 
of money to overcome this additional cost. However, this has 
been done rarely in Alberta as the tax-payer will not pay the 
cost of secondary education for children other than his own* 

We have what is known as the theory of equalization of 
the cost of education up to grade VIII, but the public does 
not yet appreciate equalization of educational opportunity 
beyond this grade. Proof of this statement lies in the fact 
that The School Act stipulates the Divisional Boards shall be 
responsible for the payment of fees for students up to grade 
XI who attend high school outside the Division, but need not

pay fees for grade XII students. However, most, if not all 
Divisional Boards pay the necessary fees for grade XII stu¬ 
dents. 

During the year ending October 31, 1941 (a ten month 
period this year as the Department of Education has now stip¬ 
ulated that the end of the school's financial year shall be 
October 31 and not December 31 as formerly) the Camrose Divi¬ 
sion paid a total of $5,235.60 for correspondence courses and 
tuition fees. While this figure represents the payment of 
fees for the school year ending June, 1941, there were to the 
end of October, 1941, 180 students for whom tuition and cor¬ 
respondence fees were paid. The superintendent of the Camrose 
Division limits to three the number of correspondence courses 
that a student may take and for which the Divisional Board 
shall pay fees. The student must accept financial responsibil¬ 
ity for any additional courses that he might wish to take. 

The last school built in the former inspectorate was 
the two-room school at Duhamel, 1931. However, after the or¬ 
ganization of the Division, 1938, a plan was adopted to re¬ 
place three old school buildings each year with new structures. 
This plan has been rigidly followed. Two schools were erected 
in the Division during the summer of 1941, the two-room school 
at Armena and the one-room school at Dorenlee. The replace¬ 
ment of school buildings at the same rate could never have been 
accomplished under the smaller unit system. The new schools 
are quite modern in every respect, having full basements, hot¬ 
air furnaces, good libraries, work rooms, individual movable

desks and full windows on one side. 

A survey of Table XIV enables one to form a mental 
picture of the Camrose Division. The lowest salary paid to 
teachers is $800 per year. However, this figure increases as 
the teacher improves his qualifications and gains experience. 
The highest salary paid by the Camrose Division is $1,200 and 
is earned by principals of schools within the Division. 

The mill rate varies according to the municipality, 
but is not excessive. The lowest mill rate for school pur¬ 
poses is 8 mills, the highest 12 mills. The total tax collec¬ 
tion of $112,510.43 for the year ending December 31, 1940 
(figures are for the year rather than for the next ten month 
period) excluding government grants amounting to $15,577.84, 
was based on a total assessment of $8,362,864. This makes 11 
mills the average rate on the total assessment within the Divi 
sion. 

In comparison with the figures in Table XIV the quali¬ 
fications of teachers for the December term, 1941, were as fol 
lows: one teacher with a lapsed certificate, 12 teachers with 
second class certificates, 47 teachers with elementary and 
intermediate certificates, 18 teachers with first class certi¬ 
ficates and 3 teachers with university degrees. Each teacher 
acting in the capacity of principal of a divisional high 

school has a degree or is working toward the attainment of his 
degree. 

The number of library books in each school of the Divi 
sion is high. Not a single room has less than 100 and many

have more than 400 books. The favored special subjects taught 
are Commercial, Music and Art, although if road conditions 
could be improved, arrangements would be made to employ tra¬ 
velling teachers to work between town and village schools in¬

CHAPTER VII 


A DOMINION SURVEY 

In order that an analysis of secondary educational 
conditions in Canadian provinces might be determined with some 
degree of consistency, a questionnaire (page 58) and form out¬ 
lines similar to those of Table XIV were sent to represent¬ 
atives of the C.T.F. in each province. A map of the Camrose 
Division was also enclosed, together with a request that each 
representative complete the form and tables and submit a map 
of the inspectorate upon which the figures for the tables were 
based. Additional information considered of value in tabulat¬ 
ing a report upon secondary education and the Larger Unit was 
also requested. 

British Columbia. 

The representative from British Columbia failed to 
respond to the appeal for completion of the forms. However, 
The Plenderleith Report, referred to previously, includes a 
comprehensive survey of the Pouce Coupe Administrative Area 
and a brief reference to the Matsaui-Sumas-Abbotsford Educa¬ 
tional Administrative Area. These are the only experiments at 
tempted in British Columbia to date. 

The Larger Units in British Columbia are called "Admin 
istrative Areas.*' In 1935 the Matsqui municipal school system 
broke down, after a most difficult period, through lack of 
money to supply the needs of the schools. The provincial gov¬ 
ernment had to come to the rescue- and after much negotiating

a merger was arranged to include Matsqui, the neighboring 
municipality of Suraas and the village of Abbotsford. (This 
accounts for the awkward name of the Administrative Area.) 

Soon after the union the difficulties of organization 
were greatly accentuated by an influx of settlers from the 
prairies resulting in an increase of some 450 pupils in a 
single year. Generous financial aid from the government was 
not sufficient to clear the debts resulting from the provision 
of extra school accommodation in the Area. 

This Administrative Area is geographically small, con¬ 
taining approximately 150 square miles. For this reason it 
has been possible to attain a fairly high degree of centraliz¬ 
ation, since good roads and short distances enable transporta¬ 
tion of pupils in nine modem school buses owned by the Area. 

Only one high school is required. This one, the 
Philipps-Sheffield High School, accommodating about 200 stu¬ 
dents, is located in Abbotsford and has a staff of ten teach¬ 
ers. Since the formation of the Area the plant has been ex¬ 
tended to include a very fine gymnasium-auditorium, extremely 
well equipped home economics rooms, a woodworking shop, a 
metal working room, a forge shop and a drafting room. 

Prior to the organization of the area in 1935, all 
secondary education was handled in three or four small high 
schools, each of which operated under a minimum curriculum 
with academic subjects only.

Saskatchewan. 

The report from Saskatchewan is centered about the 
Outlook Inspectorate, a large area which is approximately 73 
miles from north to south and approximately 64 miles from east 
to west. This inspectorate lies between Saskatoon and Moose 
Jaw and is divided into two almost equal areas by the South 
Saskatchewan River, The land is fairly level but fertile and 
is capable of producing good wheat crops. In recent years, 
however, and as in other parts of the western provinces, 
drought conditions have been common. This climatic condition 
explains the necessity for closing schools, a fact which is 
quite apparent from a study of Table XV. The people are large¬ 
ly of English descent, are industrious and very confident of 
the fertility and productiveness of this part of the province. 

The Outlook Inspectorate comprises one hundred and 
twenty-three school districts. The staff is made up of 149 
teachers (106 female and 43 male) who are responsible for min¬ 
istering to the educational needs of some 2,441 school child¬ 
ren. A great many of the one-room schools accommodate high 
school students as well as public school children. This situ¬ 
ation exists largely because of the fact that if pupils demand 
instruction in grades IX and X, in any particular school, the 
teacher must make provision to accommodate them. Furthermore, 
students who take grade XI by correspondence must attend the 
public school in their district to receive assistance and have 
assignments corrected. 

This may explain the reason why so few rooms (64)

offer instruction in grades I to VIII only. In 70 rooms, 
instruction is given to both elementary and high school grades. 
In 15 rooms instruction is given to high school students above 
grade VIII. 

In at least 18 towns and villages in the inspectorate 
instruction is offered in secondary education. Two districts 
operate vans at a total cost of $4,599.79. 

The figures in Table XV are based on 1939 statements, 
with the exception of the columns, Enrollment of Pupils and 
Certification of Teachers, which relate to 1940. The table is 
incomplete because much of the data requested was not available 
without great effort and much correspondence. Nevertheless, a 
comprehensive picture of the inspectorate may be determined 
from a study of Table XV and the use of the enclosed map of the 
area. 

Teachers in each rural and urban school are required to 
instruct in music, art, agriculture and household economics in 
addition to the academic subjects. The library in each class¬ 
room is exceptionally small, there being less than 25 books, on 
the average, in each operating classroom. There are no pro¬ 
jection lanterns nor moving picture machines provided in the 
inspectorate• 

Five types of teaching certificate are issued to teach¬ 
ers by the Department of Education. In order to obtain the 
collegiate and high school certificate one must have a univer¬ 
sity degree and at least one year's attendance at the College 
of Education. The superior first class certificate demands

two years' university training in addition to Normal. The 
first class certificate required complete high school training 
and Normal School training, while the second class certificate 
is issued to teachers who have a complete grade XI as well as 
Normal. The majority of the teachers in this inspectorate have 
first class certificates. A few have second class certificates. 
Eight teachers have collegiate or high school certificates. 

The standard of certification among the teachers within the 
area is higher than one might expect. 

It is fortunate that the data were given for 1939 as 
there is thus an opportunity to determine what can be done with 
a little government assistance. The salaries in the Outlook 
Inspectorate, 1939, varied from $400 to $1,350 per annum. One 
might expect variation in salary where there is a great range 
in the certification of teachers, yet there is unexpected vari¬ 
ation in salaries as among teachers with the same type of 
teaching certificate. The salary range for first class teach¬ 
ers in this inspectorate varied, in 1939, from $400 to $1,200, 
an $800 spread which cannot be accounted for in terms of effi¬ 
ciency alone • 

In 1940 the minimum salary was put into effect in Sas¬ 
katchewan. In the Outlook Inspectorate there are now but two 
teachers receiving less than the minimum salary of $700 per 
annum. One of these school districts in which less than the 
minimum salary is paid is Bruckton #2222 where the land is so 
poor that part of the district has been given over to govern¬ 
ment pasture.

The assessment of each school district seems to be 
exceptionally high. The mill rate, on the other hand, is 
unusually low so that, on the average, the total tax collec¬ 
tion in each school district compares favorably with that in 
other reports contained in this thesis. The mill rate 
varies from 2 mill to 16 mills - here again the variation is 
great. 

Approximately 65$ of the total cost of operation of 
the schools is supported by local taxation; the remaining 35$ 
comes from provincial support in the form of grants. The 
provincial government grant, in support of education, is 
$1.50 per operating rural room per day. A lesser amount is 
paid for each public school room in cities, towns and vil¬ 
lages. A special grant of $2.00 per day per high school room 
is given in support of secondary education. This means that 
$3.50 per day is made available, in grants, to each rural 
high school room in operation. 

At present, for the purpose of aiding in the develop¬ 
ment of secondary education, there is no grouping or consol¬ 
idation of schools or school districts within the inspectorate. 
This is unfortunate, for there are areas where the grouping of 
rural school districts, with a view to operating a rural high 
school, could be successfully carried out. Then again, con¬ 
solidation of some rural school districts with towns and vil¬ 
lages could result in a decided benefit to secondary education.

recently appointed inspector of schools, suggests that the 
Larger Unit would assist in solving the problem of secondary 
education in Saskatchewan. He suggests too, that the present 
inspectorates are large and unwieldy and should be much re¬ 
duced in size to enable proper supervision. In his opinion, 

60 to 80 Larger Units would be necessary to organize the pro¬ 
vince successfully. His suggestion for the unit system would 
be a grouping of municipalities, much on the same principle as 
that adopted in Alberta. 

On March 16, 1940, “The Act to Provide for School 
Divisions” in Saskatchewan and cited “The School Divisions 
Act, 1940“ received the assent of the Lieutenant-Governor of 
Saskatchewan. However, now that the machinery is in order and 
ready to use, it remains yet for the Saskatchewan Government 
to establish the first School Division in the province. 

Manitoba. 

Mr. J.J. Lysecki, Dauphin, Manitoba, provided informa¬ 
tion on the municipality of Mossy River. One is immediately 
impressed by its peculiar shape. The long projection to the 
north is unusual and suggests many questions from an education 
al point of view. In all probability there are many inspector 
ates in the Dominion equally odd in shape. If so, one can ap¬ 
preciate the need for educational reorganization. In this par 
ticular instance the odd shape of the municipality cannot be 
overcome by redistribution of boundary lines as the projection 
is a peninsula. If the area in the municipality as a whole

were thickly populated, there would be many obstacles to over 
come in offering secondary education. Because of the great 
distance which some children would have to travel in order to 
attend high school, a transportatiion scheme would, no doubt, 
have to be inaugurated. 

This particular municipality measures 18 miles from 
north to south and 24 miles from east to west, disregarding 
the peninsula. It comprises 19 school districts, has a gener 
al population of approximately 2,800 persons and a school pop 
ulation of about 700 children. In five rooms instruction is 
given to both elementary and high school children, while in 
two rooms instruction is devoted exclusively to the high 
school grades. There are 13 female teachers and 13 male 
teachers - an unusual, though highly acceptable distribution. 

The schools are supported largely by local taxation, 
the government bearing but 13/? of the total cost. Secondary 
education is assisted by government grants to the extent of a 
§1.00 per day per teacher as well as a §60.00 grant for each 
science laboratory. 

A study of Table XVI reveals that the number of lib¬ 
rary books per classroom compares quite favorably with the 
number in each classroom in the Camrose Division. One may 
safely assume that the number of books in each classroom in 
the Mossy River Municipality will remain stable as time goes 
on, whereas in the Camrose Division the number increases each 
year by virtue of yearly purchases.

In comparison with figures for the Camrose Division, 
the certification of teachers does not rate so high. Of 26 
teachers in the municipality, 2 are teaching on permit, 15 on 
second class certificates, 7 on first class certificates while 
the remaining two have university degrees. Six students from 
the municipality are attending high school elsewhere, the fees 
being paid by the parents of the children. Sixteen students 
are taking courses by correspondence. In comparison with the 
Camrose Division where the children in each school receive 
health inspections once every four years, only four schools 
in this area receive health service of any kind. 

There is a noticeable variation in the mill rate of 
the Mossy River Municipality from 10 to 54.5 mills. This 
would appear to be too great a variation for so small an area. 
The total assessment in the municipality is $712,414.47, the 
total cost of operating the schools is $26,840.15 and the 
government grant §6,402. If the entire group of schools were 
to form a Larger Unit, and providing the cost of operation, 
assessment and grant were to remain the same, the average mill 
rate necessary to raise the same amount of money would be 28.6 
mills, approximately half the highest mill rate in the area. 

No doubt there are many municipalities in the Dominion that 
can point to a similar disparity of mill rate. 

A study of Table XVI brings to light other interesting 
facts. One school district with an assessment of §5,970 has 

to raise §643.74 for school purposes and has a mill rate of 
54.5. Another school district with an assessment of §18,000

has to raise approximately the same amount of money for 
school purposes, namely $698.30, and has a mill rate of 10. 
Furthermore, the school district with the smaller assessment 
receives a government grant of $176.00, while the district 
with the larger assessment receives a grant of $300.00. 

There is thus no equalization of the cost of education evi¬ 
denced in the table. What better argument could there be for 
the establishment of the Larger Unit? 

The land in this area is sub-marginal. In winter the 
people fish and sell wood. In the summer they farm on the 
better land and pasture cattle on the poorer lands. The maj¬ 
ority of the people are Ukranian, but there are some Iceland¬ 
ers and some Scots. 

A glance at the map discloses that the two high 
schools in the municipality are located at Winnipegosis and 
at Fork River. The total number of high school rooms in the 
area is two which is evidently not sufficient to accommodate 
700 children. °nly those students who can afford to go a con¬ 
siderable distance to a high school or who live on farms ad¬ 
jacent to high school facilities have the privilege of obtain¬ 
ing secondary education. A solution to the secondary school 
problem in this area would be the formation of a Larger Unit 
to include the whole of the municipality of Mossy River. 

A small increase in the tax rate or a greater contri¬ 
bution from the provincial government would enable establish¬ 
ment of secondary schools at other convenient centres in the 
Larger Unit. For example, if a high school room were to be

established at each of the centres marked in green (see map 
page 70) namely at Ford and Fishing River Village where high 
school facilities are at present lacking, no high school 
student would then have more than four or five miles to go to 
school. However, this is merely a proposal and but one of 
the many methods that the Larger Unit offers for solving the 
problem of secondary education in rural areas. It is quite 
possible that local conditions would not make this organiza¬ 
tion a feasible one and that another plan would be more accept¬ 
able • 

In an earlier part of this thesis reference was made 
to the Miniota experiment in Manitoba. Because of its success 
from the point of view of secondary education and also from 
the point of view of elementary education, it is difficult to 
understand why Manitoba has not made more progress in the or¬ 
ganization of Larger Administrative Units throughout the pro¬ 
vince . 

Ontario. 

The following summary based upon material pertaining 
to the Uuron East Inspectorate was submitted by Mr. Donald B. 
Robb, Brantford, Ontario, for the year 1939. This inspector¬ 
ate (see map page 76) is approximately 30 miles from north to 
south and again approximately 36 miles from east to west. It 
comprises 91 school districts and includes two towns, Seaforth 
and Wingham, and two villages, Blyth and Brussels. 

The general population of the inspectorate is 17,770. 
The school population is approximately 2,500. There is a

total of 106 teachers - 83 female and 23 male. In the inspec¬ 
torate are 15 rooms in which instruction is offered to both 
elementary and high school pupils. There are also 2 high 
schools and 2 continuous schools situated in the towns and 
villages. These schools are not under the supervision of the 
public school inspector. 

In the inspectorate the school tax rate varies from 
3.2 to 10.1 mills and the teachers* salaries from $640 to 
$1,800. The library situation is consistently good as the 
average number of books in each of the operating rooms is 300. 
The total assessment of the area is $17,530,661, the total 
cost of operation is $125,816 and the total government grant 
received for school purposes is $17,237.28. Were the whole in¬ 
spectorate to be organized into a Larger Unit the average rate 
necessary to raise the same amount of money would be 6.19 mills. 
This inspectorate does not present the problems in secondary 
education that other less populated inspectorates offer. No 
high school is inaccessible, i.e. the distance that any high 
school student is from a secondary school is not as great as 
in many inspectorates in Western Canada. Roads too, are much 
better. However this may be, the Province of Ontario has made 
some progress with Larger Unit formation. 

"Dr. C.F. Rogers, Deputy Minister of Education, 

Ontario, has stated that up to the present (1940) some 99 town¬ 
ship school areas now direct 513 school sections, but there 
still remain 5,541 rural school boards. Prior to 1938 there

were 15 township school areas that took in 213 school sec¬ 
tions. t<a S t year 26 township areas took in 147 school sec¬ 
tions. 1,1 In 1941 there were formed 31 more Township School 
Areas which involved 153 school sections. Mr. V.K. Greer, 
Chief Inspector of Public and Separate Schools, stated October 
15, 1941, that 130 Township School Sections had been formed to 
date. 

The department of Education has encouraged the forma¬ 
tion of such Township School Areas by paying an additional 
yearly grant of $100.00 to each school section which has be¬ 
come a part of a Larger Unit. 

*n Huron East Inspectorate , the Legislative grant is 
approximately 14.6$, the county grant about 3.4$, the township 
grant about 53.5$ and the school section grant approximately 
28.55? of the total operational cost. Further assistance in 
the form of special grants from the Department of Education is 
given to elementary schools where instruction is given above 
grade VIII. Provincial Government grants are as follows: 

Fixed grants $20.00 (Grades A and B, 

10.00 Grade C) 

On special equipment 10$ of value 

Additional grant on salaries $15.00 to $60.00. 

To qualify for the above grants there must be at least 
an average daily attendance of two in grades above grade VIII 
and there must be at least $200.00 worth of equipment.

All public and separate schools also receive a grant 
from the Provincial Government on the average attendance for 
the next preceding year, according to the relation which the 
average attendance bears to the equalized assessment. That 
is, the equalized assessment divided by the average attend¬ 
ance .

township council on the whole township and divided equally 
among all sections, large or small, rich or poor. This town¬ 
ship grant on an equalized assessment (average) of: 

at least $100,000 or over is $600 for principal and $400 for 
each assistant; 

at least $60,000 but less than $100,000 is $500 for principal

Quebec. 

Mr. C. Howard Aikman, principal Lennoxville High 
School, Lennoxville, Quebec, was the C.T.F. representative 
for the province of Quebec. He chose Inspectoral District #4 
(see map page 86) to describe but failed to include figures 
for the table. 

This inspectorate, a large one, is approximately 70 
miles square. It includes 53 school districts in which are 
located 74 elementary rooms (grades I - VII), 16 intermediate 
schools (grades to IX or X), and 10 high schools (grades to 
XI and infrequently XII). There are 108 lady teachers and 32 
male teachers within the inspectorate. They operate in 104 
rooms giving instruction in grades I - VIII only and in 36 
rooms giving instruction in grades exclusively above grade 
VIII. Five vans are used to transport high school students. 
There are no dormitories. 

The tax rates within the inspectorate show some dis¬ 
crepancy as they vary from two to twelve mills. There is 
equal disparity in the salaries paid to teachers as the range 
is from §360 to §1,030 per annum. 

Quebec has done nothing in the actual formation of 
Larger Administrative Units, although several investigations 
have been carried out. Mr. W.A.F. Hepburn, chairman of a 
special committee, 1937, published “The Report of the Quebec 
Protestant Educational Survey” which was closely followed by 
a bill sponsored by the Department of Education and the Pro¬ 
testant Committee to establish County School Boards. During

the last session, 1941, the bill, "Respecting Protestant 
School Boards in Certain Counties of the Province of Quebec" 
had advanced to the legislative stage. At the last minute it 
was withheld under pressure of objection from a number of 
authorities• 

Quebec has two separate and distinct systems of educa¬ 
tion, one for the Protestants and one for the Roman Catholics. 
An Education Act regulates this organization to some extent, 
supplemented by regulations drafted by the separate committees 
which control the two. Serving the Protestant Committee are 
eight elementary school inspectors, three high school inspect¬ 
ors, three French supervisors and one English supervisor. 

These men report to the Director of Protestant Education, the 
executive officer of the Protestant Committee. 

In Quebec an elementary school may include grades I - 
VII. Permission must be obtained from the Department of Edu¬ 
cation before grade VIII may be taught in these schools as 
grade VIII is recognized as first year high school in Quebec. 
While all high schools provide for junior matriculation, many 
include grade XII. 

In Quebec an important educational problem is the 
scattered English population. Another is that education is 
financed to a very great extent by local real-estate taxation 
which yields barely enough to meet the educational needs of 
certain localities. Lack of co-operation exists between local 
districts and therefore a great measure of equipment duplica¬ 
tion and inequality of educational opportunity for pupils In 


adjacent communities is common.

Provincial grants are made on a sliding scale to non- 
urban schools. Assistance is also given in establishing and 
maintaining household science classes, twelfth grades, science 
laboratories and projection apparatus. Aid is given to local 
boards in building or in extending their plants. Unfortunate¬ 
ly the Protestant and Homan Catholic School grants are passed 
as one at the beginning of each financial year and then 
divided on the basis of enrollment. Consequently the Depart¬ 
ment of Education is able to assist financially, not on the 
basis of needs, but on what it has to dispense. Almost every 
province in Canada is faced with this same acute problem and 
while the Larger Unit helps in some measure to alleviate 
financial distress, further investigation must be made and 
Dominion assistance given before a suitable scheme can be put 
into operation. 

New Brunswick. 

The following outline (1938 figures) concerns Char¬ 
lotte County in southeastern New Brunswick. This county is 
approximately the same size but considerably more populous 
than many Alberta Divisions. It is almost 50 miles square and 
includes 117 school districts. It has a general population of 
21,435, a school population of about 4,069 and has 155 teach¬ 
ers within its boundaries. 

In the county are 18 schools offering instruction in 
the secondary grades. This is favorable in comparison with the 

Camrose Division which has 15 schools offering instruction in 
high school grades. It must be noted, however, that the 











- -

. 

■ 













- 89 - 


school population of this area is approximately twice that of 
the Camrose Division. For this reason there should be approx¬ 
imately twice the accommodation for secondary school students. 
There are 11 rooms devoted solely to high school grades as 
compared with 7 in the Camrose Division. (This does not in¬ 
clude 16 high school rooms within the town of Camrose itself.) 
There are 14 rooms offering part time work in both elementary 
and high school grades as compared with 8 in the Camrose Divi¬ 
sion. One hundred and thirty rooms offer instruction in 
grades I to VIII only. 

The land of this area is fairly rough and rugged. 

Two ranges of hills originate in this county, one following 
the coast line of the Bay of Fundy, the other running diagon¬ 
ally across the province to the northeast. The'St. Croix 
River forms the boundary line between the county and the State 
of Maine and as the Bay of Fundy lies along the east side, the 
county is almost surrounded by water. The Grand Manan Islands 
in the Bay of Fundy form a part of the county. 

The people of this area are mainly of Irish, Scottish 
and English descent, many of whom can trace their ancestry to 
the time of the great exodus from the United States after the 
War of American Independence. There is some lumbering, fish¬ 
ing, fruit-growing and farming done in the district. The 
farms are necessarily small, much after the English style. As 
the people are of industrious intelligent stock, it might be 
expected that secondary education receives favorable attention. 



- 90 - 


Table XXI enables a comprehensive survey of education¬ 
al conditions throughout the county. One notices that grade 
XII is not taught in any high school; that the high school en¬ 
rollment is not high, there being but 425 students in all the 
grades from IX to XI or 10.4$ of the total attendance. There 
are 40 pupils attending school elsewhere, 12 of whom come from 
School 11 in Pennfield Parish. 

The number of library books in most rooms is limited 
and varies in number from room to room. The lowest number of 
books in any school is 0, the highest number is 600. 

There is apparent disparity in the certification of 
teachers as well. There are four classifications in all. One 
might expect from the fact that grade XII is not taught, there 
would be a predominance of second class teachers. Such an ex¬ 
pectation is correct. Altogether there are 14 grammar certi¬ 
ficates, 27 superior certificates, 47 first class certificates, 
54 second class certificates and 1 third class certificate 
listed. 

Certification naturally brings up the question of sal¬ 
aries which, on the whole, are low in comparison with the 
Alberta scale. New Brunswick teachers receive, in addition to 
the salary paid by the district, a grant from the Department 
of Education in direct proportion to the type of teaching 
certificate and the amount of teaching experience. Table XX 
illustrates the scale.

Based on figures from the Table and using the above 
scale, the lowest salary paid in this inspectorate is about 
$370 and the highest salary approximately $2,400 per annum. 
When one considers each of these two school districts, the 
annual cost of educating one pupil in each district is $79.66 
and $49.25 and the mill rates are 5.7 and 10.1 mills respect¬ 
ively. It is quite evident that there should be some adjust¬ 
ment in the lower salary brackets to bring them into alinement 
with the higher salaries. 

Another point noticed immediately from the Table is 
the low total cost of operating the school. In Alberta the 
ratio of the total cost of operation to the teacher's salary 
is about 1.6 : 1. As illustrated in Table XXI, the ratio is 
approximately 1 : 1 and in some schools the total cost of oper 
ation of the school (that is, the cost to the district con¬ 
cerned) is actually less than the teacher's salary.

The highest mill rate is 46.8, the lowest 5.7 mills. 
Here again the range is quite great although not so extensive 
as in the M ossy River Municipality, Manitoba. The formation 
of a Larger Unit would eliminate this extreme variation. The 
average mill rate necessary to raise the same amount of money 
on the same assessment would be 14.9 mills, which is not ex¬ 
cessive when compared with the Mossy River Municipality where 
the average is 28.6 mills. 

Most of the money obtained for school purposes comes 
from local taxation. In this county 83. 8% of all moneys 
raised comes from this source, while 16*2% is contributed by 
the provincial government in the form of grants. 

No consolidation has been attempted to date. This 
does not mean, however, that consolidation of schools within 
one or more parishes would not prove of value to the develop¬ 
ment of secondary education. The school districts of West 
Isles Parish could easily br grouped, not only to the advantage 
of secondary education, but to the advantage of elementary edu¬ 
cation as well. Most of the schools of this parish are on Deer 
Island which is about nine miles long and three miles wide (see 
map page 98). In this area one hundred and eighty eight pupils 
attend school in ten different school districts. Two of these 
schools have one high school student each. (School III has one 
pupil in grade XI and School IV has one pupil in grade IX.) 
Three students from this area are attending high school else¬ 
where. It is quite obvious that the maintenance of one high 
school room would be sufficient to accommodate all the high

school students within this parish who are attending at pres¬ 
ent and be an inducement for other students to attend who, at 
present, cannot find it convenient to attend anywhere. Lord 
Cove* conveniently located with respect to Schools III, IV, V, 
Vjg-, VI and Vli, would be the logical place for the establish¬ 
ment of such a high school room. 

It is suggested, in New Brunswick, that for the time 
being the parish be the unit for consolidation. The disadvant 
ages of small size and limited resources as well as the loca¬ 
tion of schools on insular positions are not insurmountable. 

It should eventually be the aim to make the county the basic 
unit. 

Nova Scotia. 

The C.T.P. representative for Nova Scotia did not 
reply to the questionnaire mailed to him. This does not mean, 
however, that I«ova Scotia is not interested in the Larger Unit 
It does mean, on the other hand, that no definite information 
is made available on any single inspectorate in the province, 
so that there can be no comparison made in regard to the need 
for secondary education in rural areas as between Nova Scotia 
and the remaining provinces of Canada. 

A Commission appointed under the Minute of the Council 
of Public Instruction, November 19, 1938, was instructed "To 
examine fully the various types of school administration, with 
a view to the adoption of a unit larger than the present sec¬ 
tional organization prevailing throughout the province and to 



- 102 - 


present their findings and recommendations to the Council of 
Public Instruction•" 1 This Commission, working under the 
chairmanship of Henry F. Munro, presented the "Report of the 
Commission on the Larger School Unit" October 17, 1939. 

The Commission recommended that the province be the 
financial unit and that the present District Boards of School 
Commissioners be replaced by municipal school boards. As an 
alternative recommendation, the Commission suggested that the 
municipality be the unit for school finance and certain admin¬ 
istrative functions. Many other suggestions were made as well 
as the minimum programme defined. 

In a recent communication^ with Mr. H.P. Moffatt, 
Assistant Superintendent of Education, Nova Scotia, the follow¬ 
ing statement with reference to the Larger Unit was made: "The 
matter in our province has not gone beyond the recommendation 
stage .however, the Government of the province has prom¬ 

ised to introduce legislation this winter to implement the 
recommendations of the Commission for the Municipal Unit. We 
have done a bit of advance work and the school sections of one 
county have almost voted unanimously in favor of the Larger 
Unit. It is expected that the plan will go into effect in this 
county and possibly in one or two others at the beginning of 
the school year 1942-1943."

Prince Edward Island. 

This report concerns Inspectorate Number IV, Prince 
Edward Island. Much consideration has been given to Larger 
Unit formation on the Island as some interest has been dis¬ 
played and a little investigation carried on. The province is 
more interested in the smaller unit made up of from 5 to 10 
school districts for administrative purposes and a Larger Unit, 
preferably the province, as a financial unit. This would 
appear, on the surface at least, to be a suitable arrangement, 
as at present the province contributes approximately 60& toward 
the cost of operation. The remaining 40j£ comes from local tax¬ 
ation. An estimated 70 small units would be sufficient to 
cover the province. 

Inspectorate Number IV is approximately 25 miles 
square and contains 67 school districts. There are 78 teach¬ 
ers, 64 female and 14 male - an evident minority of male teach¬ 
ers. These teachers are required to operate schools 200 days 
per year and as many more days as are legally authorized. 

There are approximately 12,000 people living within 
the boundaries of the inspectorate, 1,789 of whom are school 
children. Of the 67 school districts, 59 operate one-room 
schools in which instruction is offered from grades I to X. 

The remaining 8 schools have from 2 to 4 teachers each, but do 

not include grades beyond grade X. Not a single school within 
the whole inspectorate, village or town, gives instruction in 

grades exclusively above grade 8. Grades IX and X are taught 
in almost every school room.

From the fact that grades IX and X are taught In 
each school, one might conclude that a programme In which 
these grades could be taught in one or more high school 
rooms would not be difficult to arrange. A suggested experi¬ 
ment includes the grouping of 8 school districts in the south¬ 
ern part of the inspectorate. A study of the map (page 104) 
suggests School 39 (Nine Mile Creek) as the most centrally 
located area from which to start consolidation. No school 
within the boundary of the suggested experiment is more than 
5 miles from Nine Mile Creek. A small unit made up of these 
8 districts, to include elementary as well as high school stu¬ 
dents, would permit the operation of a more economical and ef¬ 
ficient educational system. More suitable accommodation for 
high school students than is arranged for at present could be 
planned without difficulty by utilizing the consolidation 
principle . 

The formation of a Larger Unit would not only help 
solve the high school problem in Frince Edward Island, but the 
greater financial resources resulting could be used to improve 
library facilities which are in need of supplement. A general 
increase in teachers 1 salaries as well as a more equitable 
mill rate would also be important results. 

As the province starts educational reorganization, 
teachers could be easily persuaded to fall in line with the 
new scheme by co-operating in an endeavor to improve their 
qualifications. At present there are 36 first class teachers, 



- 108 - 


40 second class teachers and 2 third class teachers (Table 
XXII). Salary Increases, curricular changes and educational 
reorganization would encourage teachers to improve their 
qualifications. 

It is apparent that the time is opportune in Prince 
Edward Island, as it is elsewhere in Canada, for educational 
reorganization. In territorial readjustment, the consolida¬ 
tion of school districts to form Larger Units would be an im¬ 
portant feature. That this unit would be smaller than actual 
or suggested units in other provinces should not prove detri¬ 
mental. On the contrary it would be of particular value to 
the development of secondary education within the province. 



CHAPTER VIII 


CONCLUSION 

Many educators of today are emphasizing the need 
for national standards of education. A survey of educational 
conditions throughout Canada reveals great disparity in tax¬ 
ation, curricula, salaries and qualifications of teachers, as 
well as in other important features pertaining to the educa¬ 
tional programme. It is questionable if this should be. 
According to our Dominion constitution, the province must as¬ 
sume complete responsibility for educational facilities within 
its own boundaries. While education remained a minor social 
service and was restricted in character to a narrow field of 
culture, provincial control was perfectly acceptable. However, 
now that there are more and more demands made for better and 
higher education and with the knowledge that it is now an el¬ 
aborate social service, there is increasing evidence that edu¬ 
cation should be a national responsibility. The added cost of 
providing secondary education and the democratic Spirit of 
**Equality of Education” are further arguments for looking be¬ 
yond the restricted boundaries of the province for national 
assistance . 

We are a long way from having equality of educational 
opportunity in Canada. Unrestricted educational expenditure, 
teachers* salary schedules and provision for free and frequent 
health service for children in one province as against economic 
depression, low salaries and no health service in another, are

not compatible with true democracy and remain a blot upon 
Canada's educational record. 

While such conditions, as mentioned above, prevail as 
betv/een provinces and cannot be vastly improved until the 
Dominion government intervenes, nevertheless there is much 
that can be done within the province to alleviate similar dif¬ 
ferences that exist between rural and urban centres. The Lar¬ 
ger Administrative Unit offers one solution. Disparity of 
assessment and of tax rates as between adjoining school dist¬ 
ricts indicate that the old system of taxation is now outmoded. 
The favorable comparison betv/een aecondary-school education of¬ 
fered in the Larger Unit and in the town school is but further 
evidence revealing the antiquity of the smaller unit of educa¬ 
tion. The cost of maintaining the smaller unit as well as the 
difficulty encountered in securing and maintaining the services 
of good teachers is an inducement to find a more suitable solu¬ 
tion to the problem of elementary education. 

The Larger Administrative Unit offers at the present 
time the best solution to a few of the common educati onal ills 
besetting our society. While it is, as yet, neither perfect 
in organization nor in development, the contribution that it 
makes to secondary-school education and to equality of educa¬ 
tional opportunity merits more attention from a national point 

of view. 

It is to be hoped that the above analysis, incomplete 
and inconclusive in many respects, will recreate interest in 



- 111 - 


the merits of the Larger Unit throughout Canada. It is to be 
hoped, also, that there will result an increased study of the 
opportunities which the Larger Unit offers to the solution of 
the secondary-school problem. Finally, it is to be desired 
that educational authorities throughout Canada can be persuad¬ 
ed that the Larger Unit is an important factor in the fulfill¬ 
ment of that larger vision - SECONDARY SCHOOL OPPORTUNITY FOR 
ALL.
