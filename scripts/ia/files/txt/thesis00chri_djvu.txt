PART I 

COLCHICINE LIKE COMPOUNDS 
INTRODUCTION 


Colchicine is an extremely poisonous alkaloid first isolated from the 
autumn crocus. Investigations on colchicine were started by an incidental 
observation that cancer patients, who suffered from gout and who received 
colchicine as an adequate remedy, seemed to benefit also in respect to their 
tumors (l). 

Even, in very low concentrations it arrests the process of cell divisions 
(mitosis) in plant or animal cells (2). Colchicine also is a growth promoter; 
monstrous embryos have been obtained by treating chick embryos with colchicine 
during the first few days of incubation. 

The effect which colchicine exerts in arresting mitosis suggested that 
it might be useful as a chemotherapeutic agent for cancer. However, when 
it is administered at dose levels just sufficient to arrest mitosis, little 
effect upon the growth of the tumor is discerned (3). Only when the drug is 
administered in very large doses, just below the minimum lethal dose, is it 
possible to produce a partial and a temporary regression of certain kinds 
of tumors (3> 4)* However, at such high dose levels, hemorrhage is induced 
in tumors and thus, regression probably occurs not directly as a result of 
mitotic arrest but as a result of the destruction of the newly formed capil¬ 
lary endothelium in the .tumors. 

The disadvantages in the use of colchicine as a chemotherapeutic agent 
are due to two reasons: (1) the lack of cytological specificity in its

action, i.e., it is impossible to administer doses lethal to all the cells of 
a tumor without destroying essential dividing cells elsewhere in the body, 

(2) the general toxicity, especially to the central nervous system. 

Fundamental work on the structure of colchicine was done by Windaus (5) 
who proposed formula A for it.

Some of the key degradation products of colchicine are illustrated by 
formulas B, C, D and E. Some of these compounds have been tried in the treat¬ 
ment of cancer but despite the fact that they are less toxic than colchicine 
and consequently can be used in higher doses, their effect upon the arresting 
of mitosis is not as great.

Recently Cohen, Cook and Roe (6) suggested that ring B in colchicine 
might be 7- membered rather than 6- membered. Later, evidence in favor of 
this idea appeared in a series of articles by Cook (7)(a, b, c, d) and also 
by Tarbell, Frank and Fanta (8). They showed conclusively that deaminocol- 
chinol methyl ether could not be structure E as suggested by Windaus• It 
must be 9, 12, 13 > 14 - tetramethdfijV- 3 , 4> 5, 6 - dibenz - 5 

cycloheptatriene as illustrated by formula F. Accordingly colchinol methyl 
ether probably is best represented by formula G. 


tfx H: z. 



Recently Lettre and co-workers (1,9) reported that 1, 2 - diphenyl- 
ethylamines substituted in one of the phenyl groups by at least one methoxyl 
group possess the ability to inhibit the mitosis of certain cells in tissue 
culture. 

This work prompted Hartwell and Kornberg (10) to synthesize other 1, 2 
- diphenyl-ethylamines containing methoxyl groups substituted in various 
positions in both phenyl groups. 

These compounds may be regarded as open-chain analogues of the Windaus 
structure for colchinol methyl ether. Because of the new idea of a 7-niembered 
ring in colchinol methyl ether, the best analogue should be a derivative of 
1, 3-diphenyl-propylamine and not of 1, 2-diphenyl-ethylamine. 

The primary object of Part I of this thesis was to prepare derivatives 
of 1, 3- diphenylpropylamine in which methoxyl groups were substituted in

either or both phenyl groups* The closest structural analogue would be 
l-(m-methoxyphenyl)-3-(3j4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)~propylamine. It has not been 
synthesized as yet although an isomer of it has been isolated as the hydro¬ 
chloride*

There were two possible routes available to synthesize the key "hydro- 
chalcone" which could be changed into an amine by two methods. 

Routes A and B were both successfully employed in the synthesis of 
2,3j4-trimethoxyhydrochalcone. As route B was not as long and since yields 
were better, method A was not used for other compounds. 

The usual procedure to go from the hydrochalcone to the corresponding 
amine was by route C. The oximes were readily made and could be reduced to 
amines by either sodium amalgam and acetic acid or by sodium and ethanol* 

Route D utilized the Leukart reaction using formic acid and ammonia. 
Although this reaction gave excellent yields for unsubstituted hydrochalcone, 
it gave no amine in the case of 3,4,4%5-tetramethoxyhydrochalcone and only 
a small yield in the case of 2,3,V~trimethoxyhydrochalcone. 

None of the amines were obtained crystalline and only poor yields of 
the acyl-amine were obtained by refluxing with acetic anhydrides. These 
acyl derivatives were difficult to purify and they had a great tendency to 
supercool• 

Aldehydes and Ketones 2,3-dimethoxybenzaldehyde, anisaldehyde, aceto¬ 
phenone and p-methoxyacetophenone were purchased from a commercial source. 
Verataldehyde was made by a method outlined in Org. Syn. Coll. Vol. II, 

1943* 620. Great difficulty was encountered in the synthesis of 3>4,5- 
trimethoxybenzaldehyde. The Rosenmund reduction of the acid chloride gave 
very poor yields of the aldehyde. The method of Sonn and Muller, suggested 
as an alternative method by Cook (7*b) was likewise found to be unsuitable. 
The most successful method was the method of McFadyen and Stephans as out¬ 
lined by Buchanan, Cook and Loudon (7,c).

The parent compound chalcone is shown above, together with the system 
of numbering* Chalcones were produced in high yields by the condensation of 
equimolar amounts of aldehydes and ketones using sodium methoxide as a 
catalyst* This condensation took place best in the cold. If the temperature 
was allowed to rise, uncrystallizable oils were produced. They undoubtedly 
were produced by the 1,4- addition of the ketone to the chalcone. The chal¬ 
cones were all beautiful yellow compounds easily purified. 

Hydro chalcones 

Hi H* 

_ -<-K 

In most cases the hydrochalcones were produced by the low-pressure 
hydrogenation of the chalcones dissolved in acetic acid using Adam*s platinum 
oxide as a catalyst. The color changed from the bright yellow of the chalcone 
to colorless for the hydrochalcone. The chalcone was shaken with hydrogen 
under 2-3 atmospheres until the pressure became constant. The drop in pressure 
was always more than the theoretical indicating that hydrogenation had gone 
too far and the carbonyl group had been attacked. After filtering off the 
catalyst and evaporating off the acetic acid, uncrystallizable oils usually 
were produced. They were used directly without purification to make the

an impurity.

\ 

This would account for the fact that more than the theoretical amount of 
hydrogen was used. Later it was found that the chalcones could be reduced 
to hydrochalcones using ethyl acetate as the solvent. Here, only the 
theoretical amount of hydrogen was absorbed and the hydrochalcones could 
easily be purified. 

One other method was used to synthesize 2,3,4*-trimethoxyhydrochalcone. 
2,3-Dimethoxybenzaldehyde was converted (with high yields) into 2,3-dimethoxy- 
cinnamic by the use of malonic acid. The 2,3“dimethoxycirmamic acid was re¬ 
duced to 2,3-dimethoxyhydrocinnamic acid by k% sodium amalgam. The 2,3-di- 
methoxyhydrocinnamic acid was converted to the corresponding acid chloride 
by means of thionyl chloride and the acid chloride condensed with anisole by 
means of a Friedal and Crafts reaction. The 2,3,4-trimethoxyhydrochalcone 
produced would not solidify but gave an oxime identical with that made from 
2,3,4-trimethoxyhydrodhalcone, made from the corresponding chalcone. 

Oximes 

The general procedure was to reflux the hydrochalcone (dissolved in 
pyridine and ethyl alcohol) with hydroxylamine hydrochloride for five hours. 
The oxime usually crystallized when the mixture was poured into ice and water. 
3,4,4*-trimethoxyhydrochalcone oxime did not crystallize so the crude oxime 
was reduced to the amine. The fact that the oxime did not crystallize sug¬ 
gests that a mixture of geometrical isomers of the oxime were produced.

Hartwell and Kornberg (10) suggest that they obtained a mixture of geometrical 
isomers when they prepared 2,3,2',3’-tetramethoxydesoxybenzoin oxime. 

Amines 

The procedure generally followed for the reduction of the oxime was that 
of Allen and Buck (11), In all cases the free bases were not obtained crys¬ 
talline, The hydrochlorides of the amines were found to be soluble in water, 
ethanol and even benzene. Reduction of the oxime could also be effected by 
sodium on a boiling solution of the oxime in absolute ethanol. It was found 
that a benzene extraction of an aqueous hydrochloride solution seemed to ex¬ 
tract much of the hydrochloride which later separated from the benzene solu¬ 
tion, l-(p-methoxyphenyl)-3-(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)-propylamine could be 
recrystallized from benzene. The amines could not be purified by vacuum 
distillation, the distillate gave negligible amounts of nitrogen by micro- 
kjeldahl analysis and gave an odor of ammonia suggesting the amine had lost 
ammonia giving an unsaturated compound. 

Acylated-Amines 

Poor yields of aeylated-amines were obtained by refluxing the amines 
with acetic anhydride and subsequent dilution with water. The acyl deriva¬ 
tives had a great tendency to supercool, 

Leukart Reaction on Hydrochalcones 

The general procedure as outlined by Crossley and Moore (12) was fol¬ 
lowed, The hydrochalcone was treated with a mixture of formic acid and 
ammonia at 160-190° for ten hours. The formyl derivative was hydrolysed by 
means of concentrated hydrochloric acid giving the amine hydrochloride. 

This procedure gave excellent yields in the case of hydrochalcone but 
for derivatives of hydrochalcone the yields were very poor. Possibly the

operating conditions could be modified to give good yields of amines. The 
reaction has not been explored sufficiently to arrive at any definite con¬ 
clusion on its applicability in synthesizing the required amines.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE 

All melting points and boiling*are uncorrected, 

2,3,4*-Trimethoxychalcone . To a cooled solution of 16,5 g. (0,1 mole) 
of 2,3-dimethoxybenzaldehyde and 15.0 g. (0.1 mole) of p-methoxyacetophenone 
dissolved in 100 cc. of methyl alcohol was added 2.0 g. of sodium dissolved 
in 50 cc. of methyl alcohol. The mixture was allowed to stand at room tem¬ 
perature overnight and the beautiful yellow crystalswere filtered and washed 
with ice cold methyl alcohol. The yield was 29.0^(96$). After recrystalliza¬ 
tion from ethyl alcohol the compound melted at 102-103° (reported 102-103°)(13)• 

2,3.4*-Trimet hoxyhydrochalcone . To 43 g. of 2,3,4*-trimethoxychalcone, 
dissolved in 200 cc. of glacial acetic acid was added 0.1 g. of Adam's plati¬ 
num oxide catalyst. The solution was shaken with hydrogen under a pressure 
of 2-3 atmospheres (in a low pressure catalytic hydrogenation apparatus) 
until the hydrogen pressure became constant. The catalyst was removed by 
filtration and the solvent evaporated off leaving an uncrystallizable oil. 

The solution which was bright yellow before the hydrogenation was colorless 
when the hydrogenation was over. The oil was assumed to be the required 
hydrochalcone and was used directly without further purification. 

2,3~Dimethoxycinnamic Acid . Twenty grams of 2,3-dimethoxybenzaldehyde, 

26 g. of malonic acid, 50 cc. pyridine were heated for two hours on a water 
bath and then boiled for fifteen minute, and poured into dilute hydrochloric 
acid giving 23.7 g# (92$) of crude material which melted at 173-179° (re¬ 
ported ieo-iai°)(i5)* 










11 


2.3- Dimethoxyhydrocinnamic Acid . Twenty-four grams of 2,3-dimethoxy- 
cinnamic acid was dissolved in 20$ sodium hydroxide solution, heated to 80° 
and reduced with 400 g. of k% sodium amalgam. The mixture after being fil¬ 
tered and acidified yielded 19*5 g* (30$) of material whose m.p. was 62-63° 
(reported 63°)(14). 

2.3- Dimethoxyhydrocinnamoyl Chloride . Ten grams of crude 2,3-dimethoxy- 
hydrocinnamic acid dissolved in 20 cc. of chloroform was allowed to react at 
room temperature for three hours with 6cc. of thionyl chloride. The solvents 
were removed on a water bath and the residue vacuum distilled giving 8,5 g* 
(75$) of 2,3-dimethoxyhydrocinnamoyl chloride, b.p. 173-174° (35 mm.) (re¬ 
ported 165-166°/15 mm.)(15). 

2,3*4*-Trimethoxyhydrochalcone . To a well-cooled solution of 8 g. of 
anisole dissolved in 50 cc. of carbon disulphide was added 10 g. of anhydrous 
aluminum chloride. Eight and one-half grams of 2,3-dimethoxyhydrocinnamoyl 
chloride was added and the mixture was allowed to sit at room temperature for 
several hours. The mixture was then refluxed for thirty minutes and the 
aluminum chloride complex was hydrolysed by pouring into a mixture of ice 
and hydrochloric acid. The mixture was steam distilled and the residue ex¬ 
tracted with benzene. The benzene solution was washed with dilute sodium 
hydroxide, then twice with water and dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate. 

The benzene was evaporated leaving an oil which did not solidify. It gave 

the same oxime as did the oil produced from the reduction of 2,3*4*-trimethoxy- 

chalcone. 

2,3.4*-Trimethoxyhydrochalcone Oxime . The viscous oil produced from 
48 g. of 2,3*4*-trimethoxychalcone and 12.5 g. of hydroxylamine hydrochloride, 
dissolved in a mixture of 100 cc. of pyridine and 100 cc. of absolute ethyl 
alcohol, were refluxed for five hours. The mixture was then poured into ice 









IE 


and water giving an oil which solidified on standing* The yield of crude 
product was 27 g. After several recrystallizations from dilute ethyl alcohol 
the yield was 23 g. of material melting at 127-128° (reported 128°) (13). 

l-(p-Methoxyphenyl)-3-(2.3-dimethoxyphenyl)-propylamine . Seventeen and 
one-half grams of 2,3>4 , -trimethoxyhydrochalcone oxime, dissolved in 200 cc. 
of ethyl alcohol was treated while hot with 860 g. of 3% sodium amalgam, 
which was added in small portions* One hundred cubic centimetres of glacial 
acetic acid was added from time to time to keep the solution just acid. Suf¬ 
ficient water was added when needed to keep the sodium acetate formed in solu¬ 
tion. The mixture was diluted with water and allowed to stand overnight to 
permit any unreduced oxime to separate out. The mercury was separated by means 
of a sepdratory funnel and the unreduced oxime was filtered off. On the 
addition of an excess of ammonium hydroxide an oil separated out. The solu¬ 
tion was extracted with benzene and the benzene solution washed with water 
and dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate. After the benzene was removed by 
distillation, 12 g. of an uncrystallizable oil remained. 

Some of this oil, dissolved in absolute ethanol, was treated with dry 
hydrogen chloride. No hydrochloride separated from the solution. Also this 
oil when dissolved in benzene and treated with dry hydrogen chloride gave no 
precipitate. This oil on being vacuum distilled came over at 260° at 6 mm. 
giving 8.0 g. of a viscous oil. A microkjeldahl analysis indicated no nitrogen 
was present and since the distillate had an ammonia odor, it was suspected 
that the amine broke down on being subjected to heat. 

One-half a gram of the oil, dissolved in 95% ethyl alcohol, was added 
to 10 cc. of a saturated solution of picric acid dissolved in 95% ethyl 
alcohol. On heating to boiling and subsequent cooling, no picrate separated 


out

luted with water and made alkaline with sodium hydroxide* An oil separated 
and gradually became solid on standing* After numerous recrystallizations 
from dilute acetic acid there remained 2.5 g. of small glistening white crys¬

Veratraldehyde . The procedure of Silberschmidt (18) was followed* 
Seventy-six grams of vanillin yield 76 g. of veratraldehyde* 

3,4*4 1 -Trimethoxychalcone . Eighty grams (86$) of this chalcone was

Leukart Reaction on Hydrochalcone . The method outlined by Crossley and 
Moore (12) was folloived. 

To a three-necked ilask equipped with a dropping funnel, a down directed 
condenser was added &3 cc. (1.25 moles) of concentrated ammonium hydroxide 
and 64 g. of 90% formic acid. The temperature was raised to 160° by distil¬ 
ling out water and 52.5 g. (0.25 moles) of hydrochalcone was added. The 
temperature was kept between 170-190° for fifteen hours, after which the 
formyl derivative was hydrolysed by boiling with 100 cc. of concentrated 
hydrochloric acid. After standing overnight, the mixture was diluted with 
water and extracted with benzene. Forty-six grams of 1,3-diphenylpropylamine 
hydrochloride gradually settled from the benzene solution. The melting point 
of the hydrochloride after being recrystallized from dilute hydrochloric acid 
was 195° (reported 195°) ( 19 ).

PART II 

Derivatives of Dibenzothiophene 

Introduction 

Recently Boyland (l) found that some aromatic sulphur compounds retarded 
the growth of spontaneous mammary cancers in mice* This retardation ceased 
after the cessation of the administration of the drug being tested* 

The AjV-diaminodiphenyl—and the 4,4’-dinitrodiphenyl—sulphides,— 
sulfoxides and—sulphones all showed some action, but the most effective 
compounds were the sulphoxides, particularity 4,4 , -diaminodiphenyl-sulphoxide. 
4,4 , -Diaminodiphenyl-sulphone was later shown to inhibit the growth of the 
tubercle bacilli in vitro. 



may be considered to be derived from 4,4 1 -diaminodiphenylsulfoxide (repre¬ 
sented by structure A), by direct union of the 2,2*- positions.

It was thought that this modification of the open-chain compounds A 
and C in structures B and D might modify the properties sufficiently so that 
they might be useful in the chemotherapy of cancer and tuberculosis. Accord¬ 
ingly the object of part II of this thesis was to synthesize 2,8-diaminodi- 
benzothiophene-5-oxide, and 2,8-diaminodibenzothiophene-5*-dioxide. 

Recently 2,8-diarainodibenzothiophene-5-dioxide was synthesized by Neumoyer 
and Amstutz (2), so efforts along that line were abandoned. All attempts to 
synthesize the corresponding sulphoxide have so far failed. 


Discussion 



The system of numbering of dibenzothiophene is shown above. In most of 
its reactions dibenzothiophene is attacked at the 2- position. Using more 
strenuous conditions further reactions involves the 8- position. Thus it is 
known that the product of mono-nitration is the 2-nitro derivative, and in 
dinitration the product is the 2,8- compound (3). Similarity dibromination 
occurs in the 2,8- positions (4). 

Two routes to synthesize the required compounds were tried. A flow 
sheet illustrating the two methods tried are shown below. Both methods were 
unsuccessful.

In route B, 2,8-dibromodibenzthiophene-5-oxide was readily made by 
chlorinating and subsequent hydrolysis of the chlorine addition-product. 
Diamination of the dibromo-sulfoxide was tried with sodamide in liquid 
ammonia and also with ammonium hydroxide in a Carius bomb-tube. The first 
method gave a small yield of 2,8-diaminodibenzothiophene whereas the second 
method gave the same product, together with much tarjor. else unchanged di¬ 
bromo-sulf oxide depending on the conditions used. Evidently the oxygen in 
the sulfoxide is very loosely held and is readily split off by reducing 
agents such as sodium amide and copper. 

The 2,8-dibromo-sulphone gave a good yield of the 2,8-diamino-sulphone 
when treated with concentrated ammonia in a Carius bomb-tube. When treated 
with sodamide in liquid ammonia the dibromo-sulphone gave no indentifiable 
products. 

The 2,8-dibromo-sulphide gave a small yield of 2,8-diamino-sulphide when 
it was treated with sodamide in liquid ammonia. Neumoyer and Amstutz (2) 
report that the 2,8-dibromo-sulphide gives a good yield of the 2,8-diamino- 
sulphide on treatment with concentrated ammonium hydroxide and copper in a 
Carius bomb-tube. 

Experimental 

All melting points are uncorrected. 

2.8-Dibromodibenzothiophene . The procedure suggested by Courtot (4) 
was utilized. To a solution of 18.4 g* (0.1 mole) of dibenzothiophene dis¬ 
solved in 200 cc. of chloroform, 11 cc. of bromine was added dropwise from a 
dropping funnel. The mixture was allowed to sit overnight after which the 
solvent was removed and 50 cc. of 95$ ethyl alcohol was added and the product 
was filtered. Recrystallization from benzene yielded 13*0 g. (38$) of 
material melting at 220-221° (reported 229°) (4).

2,8-Dibromodibenzothiophene-5-oxide . An excess of chlorine was bubbled 
through 6,0 g. of 2,8-dibroinodibenzothiophene, dissolved in 600 cc. of anhy¬ 
drous benzene. The mixture was then poured into ice and water and shaken 
vigorously. The crude yield of sulfoxide that separated was 4.6 g. After 
several recrystallizations from benzene the melting point was 298-299°.

Diamination of 2,8-Dibromodibenzothiophene-5-oxide A. A mixture of 
2,8-dibromodibenzothiophene~5-oxide, 7*5 cc. of concentrated aqueous ammonia 
and a pinch of copper bronze was heated approximately ten hours at 200-230° 
in a carius bomb-tube. The material from the tube was filtered and the solid 
dissolved in dilute hydrochloric acid. This solution when made alkaline gave 
a precipitate which was filtered and washed with water. The solid melted at 
191-192°. On admixture with an authentic sample prepared by Courtot f s method 
(3), the substance showed no depression of the melting point. Similar amina- 
tions were tried using the same conditions except the catalyst was different. 
When cuprous chloride or cupric chloride were used* small yields of 2,8- 
diaminodibenzothiophene were obtained. t When no catalyst was used only un- 
changed 2,8-dibromodibenzothiophene^was recovered. 

B. Sodamide was prepared by the directions of Vaughn, Vogt and Niewland 
(5) from 2 g, of sodium and 0.1 g. of hydrated ferric nitrate in 200 cc. of 
liquid ammonia. Five grams of 2,8-dibromodibenzothiophenetwas added and the 
mixture allowed to stand overnight. After allowing the ammonia to evaporate 
the solid remaining was extracted with dilute hydrochloric acid. On render¬ 
ing the hydrochloric acid solution alkaline, a small yield of material melt¬ 
ing at 191-192° was obtained. This compound gave no depression of the melt¬ 
ing point when admixture^ with an authentic sample of 2,8-diaminodibenzothio- 
phene (3).

2,8-Dibromodibenzothiophene-5-dioxide * Eight grams of 2,8-dibromodi¬ 
benzothiophene, 10 cc. of concentrated sulfuric acid, 10 cc. of water and 10 
g. of sodium dichromate were refluxed for two hours. After cooling, filter¬ 
ing and washing with water a yield of 8.5 g. of material melting 345° 

(reported 341°) (2) was obtained. 

Diamination of 2,8-Dibromodibenzothiophene-5-dioxide A. A mixture of 
1 g,2,8-dibromodibenzothiophene-5-dioxide, 0.2 g. of copper bronze and 20 cc. 
of concentrated aqueous ammonium hydroxide was heated for ten hours at 200- 
230° in a Carius bomb-tube. The contents of the tube were filtered and the 
solid dissolved in dilute hydrochloric acid. This hydrochloric acid solution 
was treated with norite, filtered and the filtrate made alkaline. One gram 
of pinkish material was obtained melting at 310°. Neumoyer and Amstutz re¬ 
port the melting point 329-331° (corrected) (2). 

B. When 2,8-dibromodibenzothiophene-5-dioxide was treated with sodamide 
in liquid ammonia under the same conditions as used for 2,8-dibromodibenzo- 
thiophene-5-oxide, no known products could be isolated. 

Diamination of 2.8-Pibromodibenzothiophene A. 2,8-dibromodibenzothiophene 
when treated with concentrated ammonium hydroxide under conditions analogous 
to those for the corresponding 5-oxide, gave 2,8-diaminodibenzothiophene 
melting at 192°. This diamine gave no depression of the melting point with 
an admixture of an authentic sample. 

B. 2,8-Dibromodibenzothiophene when treated with sodamide using the 
same conditions as those for the 5-oxide, gave a small yield of 2,8-diamino¬ 
dibenzothiophene along with unreacted 2,8-dibromodibenzothiophene.

PART III 

The Rates of Dissociation of 1,1,1,2-Tetraphenyl-2-(5-tetralyl)-ethane 
and 1,1,1,2-Tetraphenyl-2-(4-hydrindenyl)-ethane. 


INTRODUCTION 

\ 



In their original paper. Mills and Nixon (l) pointed out that in 
hydrindene (i), the two bonds linking the trimethylene group to the benzenoid 
ring are probably distorted towards one another. A very important result that 
must accompany such a deflection of these valence bonds is a reduction in the 
steric influence of the methylene groups adjacent to the benzene ring. It 
follows that the steric effect of a five-membered ring should be smaller than 
that of a corresponding six-membered ring such as in tetralin (II). 

Experimental support for this view was found by Arnold and Rondestvedt (2)

They found that 4-acetylhydrindacene (III) undergoes a normal haloform 
reaction whereas 9-acetyloctahydroanthracene (IV"), acts like a highly hindered 
ketone and forms a relatively stable trichloro ketone. The mechanism of the 
haloform reaction can be described by the following equations (2).

If the ortho substituent "X n is sufficiently small, the haloform re¬ 
action proceeds rapidly to give chloroform and either an acid or its ester. 
When the group ,, X n is large enough (even methyl) the last step in the halo¬ 
form reaction is sterically inhibited and the trichloro-ketone (VX) is iso¬ 
lated as the reaction product. 

Arnold and Rondestvedt found that 4-acetylhydrindacene gave an acid 
and its methyl ester whereas 9-acetyloctahydroanthracene gave a stable tri¬ 
chloro ketone. In a later publication, Arnold and Rondestvedt (3), brought 
further evidence to support the view that the steric influence of an ortho 
methylene group in a six-membered ring is greater than in a five-membered 
ring. 


Another possible way of testing for this steric difference should be 
by the comparison of the half-life periods of pentaaryl ethanes containing 
either a hydrindenyl group or a tetralyl group, attached to the ethane car¬ 
bon in a position ortho to the methylene groups.

It was thought that it should be profitable to synthesize these two hyd¬ 
rocarbons and to determine their half-life periods. 

The greater steric effect of a six-membered ring should mean that the 
tetralin hydrocarbon should dissociate much faster than the corresponding 
hydrindene hydrocarbon. This would mean the tetralin hydrocarbon should 
have a shorter half-life period.

& E 


Another benefit of knowing the half-life periods of these hydrocarbons, 
would be that this knowledge should be applicable in determining qualitatively 
the relative stability of the three anthracene derivatives shown above.

The hydrocarbon 1,2,9,10-tetramethylanthracene (C) was synthesized in 
1943 by Sandin, Kitchen and Fieser (4). This hydrocarbon was highly sensi¬ 
tive to air and became oxygenated after brief periods of storage. The most 
plausible explanation of this sensitivity to air is that this hydrocarbon 
exists partly as an unstable biradical (F) which tends to pick up oxygen 
forming a peroxide (g). 



The steric effect of a 1,2-dimethyl group might tend to reduce the 
coplanarity of the benzene rings and tend^to stabilize structure F. 

Grunert, Nichol and Sandin (5) studied the effect of a 1,2-dimethyl 
group by measuring the half-life period of l,l,l,2-tetraphenyl-2-(3-o- 
xylyl)-ethane* 



This hydrocarbon upon dissociation gives a structure similar to the 
biradical structure (F). As was expected the half-life period was found to 
be very short (13*4 minutes) indicating the 1,2-dimethyl group has a large

steric effect. By analogy the 1,2,9,10-tetramethylanthracene should likewise 
contribute to the great reactivity of this compound. 

By a comparison of the half-life periods of 1,1,1,2-tetraphenyl-2-(3-o- 
xylyl) -ethane, 1,1,1,2-tetraphenyl-2-(5-tetralyl)-ethane and 1,1,1,2-tetra- 
phenyl-2-(4-hydrindenyl)-ethane, one should gain information concerning the 
relative stability of hydrocarbons C. D and E. If the half-life period of 
either the tetralyl or hydrindenyl hydrocarbon is less than that of the 
3-o-xylyl hydrocarbon, the corresponding anthracene derivative should be 
more unstable than l,2,9>10-tetramethylanthracene and consequently its syn¬ 
thesis would likely be impossible. If the half-life period of either hydro¬ 
carbon were greater than the 3-o-xylyl hydrocarbon, the corresponding anthra¬ 
cene derivative should be more stable than 1,2,9*10-tetramethyl-anthracene 
and consequently should be easier to make than 1,2,9,10-tetramethylanthracene. 

The object of Part III of this thesis was to prepare 1,1,1,2-tetraphenyl- 
2-(5-tetralyl)-ethane and 1,1,1,2-tetraphenyl-2-(4-hydrindenyl)-ethane and to 
measure their half-life periods*

Theory of Pentaaryl Ethanes 

The pentaarylethanes are colorless.solids giving colorless solutions at 
room temperature. When the solution is heated to 80-100° a yellow color ap¬ 
pears indicating that dissociation into free radicals has taken place. At 
100° pentaaryl ethanes absorb oxygen, bromine and iodine very rapidly. The 
pentaphenylethanes are much more stable than the hexaphenylethanes which dis¬ 
sociate at room temperature. 

From a study of the rate of oxygen absorption at 80-100°, it was estab¬ 
lished that pentaphenylethane undergoes dissociation in solution into diphenyl- 
methyl and triphenylmethyl radicals (6) 

Even in a colorless solution of pentaphenylethane this equilibrium exists. 

There is a rapid dissociation into free radicals which recombine, as quickly 

as they are formed, into pentaphenylethane. 

The treatment of pentaarylethanes at 80-100° with oxygen results in the 

formation of unsymmetrieal peroxides. This oxidation process was shown by 

Bachman and Wiselogle (6) to be a measure of the degree of dissociation of 

the pentaarylethane, i.e., the oxidation involves a slow dissociation of the 

pentaarylethane into free radicals, followed by a rapid conversion to the 

peroxide. The dissociation accordingly is the rate-controlling process.

Bachman and Osborne (7) developed a good method for determining the rates 
of dissociation of pentaarylethanes. Instead of using oxygen, they allowed 
the pentaarylethane to react with iodine. The iodine was used in a solution 
of pyridine, o-dichlorobenzene and ethanol. The o-dichlorobenzene acted as 
an inert solvent. The ethanol converted the triphenylmethyl iodide to tri- 
phonylmcthyl - iodido - to triphenylmethyl ether as fast as it was formed. This 
was essential as the reaction of triphenylmethyl and iodine to give triphenyl¬ 
methyl iodide is reversible. The pyridine was present to tie up with the 
hydrogeniodide (produced in the triphenylmethyl ether formation) in order to 
prevent it reacting with the free radicals. The diphenylmethyl iodide tied 
up with pyridine to give a quaternary salt in preference to forming an ether 
by a reaction with ethanol. The following equations illustrate the method.

Using this procedure Bachman and Osborn (7) found that the dissociation 
into free radicals was again the rate-controlling process, being first order 
and unimolecular. Hence we can apply the formula derived previously, 
k o -2.3/t log(l-z) 

Where z « fraction of pentaaryl dissociated « ratio of the amount of iodine 
adsorbed at time t to the theoretical absorption. 

By plotting t against -log(l-z) and drawing the best-fitting straight 
line and calculating the slope, we can find k and also the half-life period, 
slope - k/2.3 
. . k = 2.3 x slope 
t\ * log 2/slope 
« 0.3010/slope 

Using this method Bachman and coworkers ( 7 , 8 ) determined the half-life 
period of a great number of pentaarylethanes. These workers found the effect 
of replacing one or more phenyl groups in pentaphenylethane by other groups. 
Grunert, Nichol and Sandin ( 4 ) studied the effect of xylylgroups on the degree 


of dissociation

DISCUSSION 


Half-life periods of pentaphenylethane were run until a value close to 
that determined by Bachman (7) was obtained. This was thought necessary in 
order to be sure the technique used was accurate enough.

tetraphenyl-2-(5-tetralyl)-ethane.

latter compound was also made by the action of the Grignard from 5-bromotetralin

This ketone was converted to phenyl-5-tetralylcarbinol by the action of 
aluminum isopropoxide (10,11)* This carbinol could not be obtained by the 
action of the Grignard reagent made from 5-bromotetralin on benzaldehyde. The 
oil produced by this reaction gave low carbon-hydrogen analytical results* 

Phenyl-5-tetralylmethyl bromide was made by the action of acetyl bromide 
on the carbinol. It was coupled immediately with sodium triphenylmethyl to 
give a good yield of the pentaarylethane. When the carbinol was treated with 
30 % hydrogen bromide in acetic acid,. followed by acetyl bromide and then 
vacuum distilled and coupled with sodium triphenylmethyl, no pentaarylethane 
was obtained. The only explanation possible was the loss of hydrogen bromide 
at some stage. This would most likely have occured during the vacuum dis¬ 
tillation. Bachman, Hoffman and Whitehead (8) reported that some of their 
diarylmethyl bromides were tocmnstable to be distilled. They used the bromides 
without purification or analysis. 

A flow sheet illustrating the series of reactions used in the synthesis 
of 1,1,1,2-tetraphenyl-2-(4-hydrindenyl)-ethane is illustrated below.

4-cyanohydrindine was prepared according to the direction of Fieser and 
Hershberg (12). A good yield of 4-benzoylhydrindene was obtained by the re¬ 
action of phenyl magnesium bromide on 4-cyanohydrindene. The ketone was read¬ 
ily reduced to phenyl-4-hydrindenyl carbinol by means of aluminum isopropoxide 
(10,11). The carbinol when treated with acetyl bromide and then coupled with 
sodium triphenylmethyl, gave a good yield of l,l,l,2-tetraphenyl-2-(4~hydrin-

in the hot acid. The acid was cooled, and 1 g. of basic copper carbonate was 
added. The mixture was heated rapidly to 265° by means of a salt bath and 
kept at this temperature until no more carbon dioxide was evolved. The 5-ben¬ 
zoyl tetralin was then vacuum distilled giving 30 g. (60$) of a viscous oil

B. From reaction of Grignard reagent from 5-bromotetralin on benzonitrile . 
The Grignard reagent prepared from 30.0 g. of 5-bromotetralin, dissolved in 
ether and benzene was added to freshly distilled benzonitrile. The mixture was 
refluxed for several hours. The precipitate that formed did not go into solu¬ 
tion. The benzene and ether were evaporated and hydrochloric acid added to 
the residue. The mixture was refluxed for five hours, then extracted with ether. 
After removing the ether, the residue was vacuum distilled giving 14 g# (41$) 
of a viscous oil identical-with that obtained by decarboxylating 2-(5-tetraloyl)-

Phenyl-5-tetralylcarbinol . Eight grams of aluminum wire cleaned by 
emery paper, was placed in a 500 cc. florence flask to which was attached 
a Tamworth condenser fitted with a calcium chloride drying tube. The flask 
was heated with a free flame to drive off any moisture. A pinch of mercuric 
chloride, 1 cc. of carbontetrachloride and 200 cc. of dry isopropyl alcohol 
was then added and the mixture refluxed for eight hours. The mixture was 
filtered through a cotton plug into a 500 cc. clean dry florence flask. The 
isopropyl alcohol was distilled off and 30 g. of 5-benzoyltetralin dissolved 
in 250 cc. of dry toluene was added and the mixture was refluxed for seven 
hours. A Snyder column was now attached in place of the condenser and 100 cc. 
of dry isopropyl alcohol was added and fractionally distilled over a period 
of several hours. Another 100 cc. of dry isopropyl alcohol was added and 
fractionally distilled. The solution was hydrolysed by cold 10$ sulfuric 
acid and the toluene layer dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate. The toluene 
was distilled off and the residue vacuum distilled giving 20 g. (66$) of a 
yellow viscous oil. b.p. 225-229° (12 mm.), 174-175° (1*5 mm.)

a pin-point hole in a filter-paper. The amalgam was pipetted out and placed 
under dry benzene in a glass-stoppered bottle. 

To this amalgam, contained in a 500 cc. glass-stoppered bottle was added 
10.0 g. of triphenylchloromethane dissolved in 50 cc* of benzene and 50 cc. 
of ether. The bottle was sealed with a special stop-cock grease (13), cooled 
in an ice-bath and shaken by hand. After several hours of intermittent shak¬ 
ing the amalgam was frozen by immersing in an ice bath. The unpurified phenyl- 
5-tetralylmethyl bromide was quickly added and the glass-stoppered bottle was 
shaken. The solution was transferred to a separatory funnel by decantation 
and ethanol cautiously added to destroy any unreacted amalgam. The benzene 
layer was washed with water and dried for a short time over anhydrous sodium 
sulphate. Methanol was added to the benzene causing the hydrocarbon to pre¬ 
cipitate. A yield of 11 g. was obtained. On recrystallizing from benzene 
and methanol 6.5 g. of material melting at 190-194° was obtained. The crystals 
were dried in vacuo for three hours before a carbon-hydrogen analysis was run.

Phenyl-4-hydrindenylmethyl Bromide . This compound was made from the 
above carbinol by means of acetyl bromide in a similar manner to the prepara¬ 
tion of phenyl-5-tetralylmethyl bromide. 

1,1.1,2-Tetraphenyl-2-(4-hydrindenyl)-ethane . The procedure followed 
was the same as for 1,1,1,2-tetraphenyl-2-(5-tetralyl)-ethane. A yield of

carbon was recrystallized from benzene and methanol it melted at 185 - 190 °.

Half-life Period of Pentaphenylethane . For standardizing technique 
check runs were made on the half-life of pentaphenylethane prepared by the 
procedure of Bachman (14). Results obtained were 53.1 minutes, 37*3 minutes 
and 55*3 minutes. The second half-life is distinctly in error. The reason 
for this discrepancy is most likely due to poor distilled water. It was 
found that the distilled water system was being contaminated by improper 
joints. The 14s t value (55*3) is in good agreement with the value (56.0 
min.) determined by Bachman (7). 

Half-life Period of 1,1,1,2-Tetraphenyl-2-(5-tetralyl)-ethane . 

Rate Measurements . The iodine solution was made up by adding o-dichloro¬ 
benzene to a solution fo 6.5 g. of iodine in 32.5 cc. of pyridine until the 
total volume was 500 cc. The sodium thiosulphate was made slightly stronger 
than 0.1N so that it would be strong enough to react with all the iodine 
originally present in the organic iodine solution. The aqueous iodine solu¬ 
tion was 0.1N in strength and was standardized against arsenious oxide. 

The samples (0.1162 g. each) were weighed into glass vials about 12 ram. 
deep and 8 mm. in diameter, with flat bottoms. Ten cubic centimeters of

organic iodine solution and 1 cc. of absolute methanol were placed in a 
125 cc. glass-stoppered Erlenmeyer flask. The flask was suspended in a water 
bath (with a coating of oil to prevent excessive evaporation) kept at 80° to 
within 0.1°. The vial containing the sample of pentaphen3^1ethane was then 
lowered in an upright position into the Erlenmeyer flask by means of forceps 
and allowed to float on the surface of the organic solution of iodine. The 
flask after being stoppered loosely was allowed to reach the temperature of 
the bath by allowing it to sit for ten minutes. The vial was then tipped over 
by swirling the flask, a stop-watch being started at this time. When the 
desired interval of time had elapsed, the flask was removed from the bath and 
immersed in ice-water, the watch being stopped at this point. 

The flask was kept in ice water for one minute and then 10 cc. of sodium 
thiosulphate solution was .added. The solution was well mixed for half a 
minute, the sides of the flask washed down with 50 cc. of water and the excess 
sodium thiosulphate titrated with the standardized o.lN solution of iodine. 
From the volume of this standard iodine solution needed to give the end-poirit 
with starch (3 cc. of a 1% solution) was subtracted the volume of iodine solu¬ 
tion required to give the end-point to a blank. The latter was run with all 
the reagents except the pentaarylethane in exactly the same manner as a regu¬ 
lar run. The difference was the volume of o.lN iodine which reacted with the 
free radicals formed by dissociation of the 1,1,1,2-tetraphenyl-2-(5-tetralyl)- 
ethane. 

Knowing the concentration of the standardized iodine solution, the volume 
theoretically absorbed by 0.1162 g. of the tetralyl-ethane was calculated. 
Calculations were then carried out and values for t were plotted against 
-log(l-^.). The best fitting straight line was drawn, its slope determine^, 
and the half-life period was calculated.

It was found that the presence of an appreciable amount of phenyl-5- 
tetralyl-methyl-pyridiniurn iodide in the aqueous solution interfered with the 
end point. For this reason only short time intervals were taken. For some 
reason the best-fitting straight line did not go through the origin, the rea¬ 
son for this is not known. 

The tabulated results together with their respective graphs of two runs

SUMMARY 


The two hydrocarbons l,l,l,2-tetraphenyl-2-(5~tetralyl)-ethane and 
1,1,1,2-tetraphenyl-2-(4-hydrindenyl)-ethane have been synthesized and their 
half-life period has been determined. 

The half-life period of 1,1,1,2-tetraphenyl-2-(5-tetralyl)-ethane is 
much shorter than that of l,l,l,2-tetraphenyl-2-(4~hydrindenyl)-ethane. This 
agrees well with the supposition that the steric effect of a five-membered 
ring should be much less than that of a six-membered ring*
