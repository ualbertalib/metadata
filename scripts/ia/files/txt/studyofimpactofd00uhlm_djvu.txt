ABSTRACT 


THESIS - H A Study of the Dnpact of Demographic and Economic Changes 

in Rural Alberta on the Financing of Education * 11 

Alberta, during its short history as a province, has expert 
ienced major demographic and economic changes*. These changes have 
modified the forces shaping rural life: their effects have been, 
or will be, far reaching* The problem in this dissertation is 
concerned with the impact of change upon educational finance* The 
question was: l, ¥hat has been the impact of recent demographic and 
economic trends in rural Alberta upon the financing of education?” 

Pertinent historical data on the development of local 
units of administration in rural Alberta were assembled* These 

provided a frame of reference for the interpretation of the quan¬ 
titative data which were gathered from census reports, annual 

reports of Alberta government departments, national and provin¬ 
cial accounts, and numerous statistical reports* Supplementary 
data were obtained through interviews with provincial depart¬ 
mental personnel. 

Specific data were assembled in the following sub-problem 
areas: population and labour force changes in rural Alberta; mod¬ 
ifications in the organizational pattern of fanning; economic 
trends within the farming industry; educational needs in the 
light of demographic and economic changes; and, trends in the 
financing and organization of rural education. Data were then 






iv 

tabulated and analyzed to show the nature and extent of trends. 
Finally, the data were interpreted to indicate the collective 

financial impact upon rural education. 

The study supports the following tentative conclusions: 

1. The traditional rural-urban differentiation, as sep¬ 
arate and discrete parts of society in Alberta, must be aban¬ 
doned, particularly with regard to education. 

2. The education of rural youth must be upgraded, whether 
these young people are being prepared for either rural or urban 
occupations# 

3. The possibilities of meeting the educational needs of 
youth within the present organization, curriculum, and finan¬ 
cial structure of rural education are slight* Their achievement 
within the present organizational pattern could well be finan¬ 
cially prohibitive* 

4# New ways and means of improving the quality and scope 
of rural education must be sought within the clearly defined 
demographic qualities of rural Alberta* 

5* Financial schemes of the future must distribute the 
costs of education, even more fully than at present, beyond ary 


locale^

CHAPTER I 


THE PROBLEM DEFINED AND DELIMITED 

Alberta, during its short history as a province, has experienced 
far-reaching demographic and economic changes* One of the results has 
been a broadening of the needs of education throughout the province. In 
rural areas this called for a complete reorganization of educational 
facilities and of educational fare, since the one-room school proved 
inadequate to meet the educational requirements of rural children; and 
there were problems of finance that made reorganization inevitable. 

Rural reorganization has produced many changes* It has involved 
larger administrative units and attendance areas, school conveyance, a 
complex system of grants, and other measures designed to improve the 
quality of instruction and to equalize the financial burden* The whole 
process has solved many problems, but it has created some new ones. 

I* THE PROBLEM 

The effectiveness of a public service depends to a considerable 
degree upon organization, but the ultimate criterion of success is the 
degree to which it accomplishes its basic purposes* The purposes of 
education arise out of a basic philosophy, which is quite permanent, and 
out of social and economic demands, which are continually changing. The 
development of new organizational patterns in education in the light of 
changing demands created the need for a modified financial structure*

It was the purpose of this study to examine the structure of 
rural education in Alberta as affected by various demographic and 
economic forces acting through time, and to assess the financial 
implications* 

Statement of the Problem 

The problem was stated thus in question form: What has been 
the impact of recent demographic and economic trends in rural Alberta 
upon the financing of education? 

Specific Problem Areas 

The problem was approached through an investigation of the 
following sub-problems: 

1* What has been the significance to education of the deve¬ 
lopmental pattern of rural local government in Alberta? 

2* What have been the demographic changes of import to 
education in rural Alberta during the past twenty-five years? 

3* What changes in the organizational pattern of farming 
during the past twenty-five years have been significant to edu¬ 
cation? 

4o What economic influences of the past twenty-five year 
period have been significant to education? 

5* What have been the significant trends in the financial 
support of education in Alberta during the past twenty-five years? 

6* What has been the significance of trends in the finan¬ 
cing of rural education in Alberta during the past twenty-five years?

7. Of what significance for the future is the changing 
pattern of rural education in Alberta? 

8 * What is the impact of present economic and demographic 
trends in rural Alberta upon the financing of education in the 
decade ahead? 


Approach to the Problem 

Each of the several sub-problem areas could very well con¬ 
stitute a major research project; however, the nature of the problem 
suggested a general investigation of the several aspects as a prelim¬ 
inary to further research within narrower limits. Current thinking on 
the problem would appear to support this approach. 

II. THE NEED FOR THE STUDY 


Ev idence of Need 

The general need for the type of study undertaken here has 
recently been voiced in publications in Canada and in the United States. 
The Royal Commission on Agriculture and Rural Life for the Province 
of Saskatchewan stated in its report: 

Rural education must be considered in its integral relationship 
with the total rural social and economic system. Changes in farm 
economy and associated social adjustments have vital implications 
for the provision of education in rural areas. They have created 
new problems in the organization, administration, and financing of 
education and, as well, have created new needs to be met by 
education.1 

Dr. M.Eo LaZerte, who made a careful study of educational finance 
in Canada, stated the problem thus: 

In rural areas the total assessable property on which taxes may 
be levied varies slowly and within narrow limits and the proportion

of total revenue obtained from taxes is rather constant .... It 
is a problem to finance the increasingly wide range of services 
in good times because of high costs and the virtual impossibility 
of raising assessments or tax rates to parallel increases in 
price indexes; in times of depression land values are depressed, 
incomes from . . . farm property are low, taxes fall in arrears 
and monies are not available to municipal bodies.^ 

The 1945 Yearbook of the National Education Association of the 
United States carried an analysis which emphasized the nature of the 
problem and indicated the need for careful study. It stated the need 
thus: 

Education finds its roots in the social and economic lives of 
the people it serves. It is necessary then to identify the prin¬ 
ciple problems of rural people if the foundations of an adequate 
educational program are to be laid.3 

The need to examine the shifts that are taking place in the 
expenditure pattern of funds devoted to education was stressed by Paul 
R. Mort in the following terms: 

It is rather amazing that no extensive studies . . . have come 
to light bearing on the shifting of the expenditure pattern among 
budgetary items as the expenditure level varies. The tendency to 
refer to averages covering a wide range of expenditure items would 
seem to be extremely misleading.4 

The above illustrations indicate a recognition of the need for 
a study of education within the rural setting if the basic problem of 
educational finance is to be solved. 


The Need in Alberta 

While many of the problems of rural education are quite common 
throughout Canada and the United States, others are quite different; 
furthermore, some provinces and states have gone farther than others in 
the development of plans designed to effect a satisfactory solution to

these problems*. Alberta has made much progress, possibly more than any 
other province in Canada or many of the states in the United States* 
However, there is evidence that serious problems still remain unsolved 
and that these problems are largely financial in nature*. 

The larger units of administration in Alberta had made possible 
the placing of rural education on a much stronger financial basis and the 
extention of educational opportunities* But problems still remained. 

In a recent study (1958) which involved interviews with school superin¬ 
tendents the following conclusion appeared: 

None of the senior directors interviewed in the three provinces 
in the western zone (Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta as defined 
in the study) was prepared to say that the structure as it exists 
now is entirely satisfactory* 5 

Xt is conceded that, regardless of the excellence of a system of 
local administration of education, there are always voices raised con¬ 
cerning inadequacies ; there are always "prophets of doom*" Xt was ever 
thus* But in Alberta there are voices in circles outside of local confines 
which echo the need for a careful analysis of rural educational finance* 

The Honourable £*W* Hinman, Provincial Treasurer, recently 
(November, 1957) stressed the seriousness of the financial problem in 
the following manner: 

Rural municipalities, different in nature from our cities, cannot 
provide their people with comparable services, particularly in 
education, at comparable costs * * * • The grants system has become 
complex and largely conditional and has failed to make possible 
somewhat similar standards of service throughout the province at 
comparable tax rates.^ 


A few years earlier another official of the provincial government 






6 


publicly defined the main problem of rural education as one of dollars 
and cents. He indicated also that **in very many cases the problem 
cannot be solved ty increasing the local taxes because the taxable 
values are just not there. 

Two very important aspects of the general problem of rural edu¬ 
cation were emphasized recently (March, 1958) by two staff members of 
the University of Alberta, both of whom are experienced educational 
administrators. In a consideration of the need to develop to the utmost 
the human resources of Alberta they concluded: 

It is contended that the system whereby education is financed 
is the strongest single agent affecting the nature and quality of 
the school. ‘When we view every community as being a potential 
source of talents we seek, then the contention has meaning. A 
system of financing schools must guarantee sufficient funds to 
pay for the quality of services and goods required by the job.8 

In pinpointing the critical issue in educational finance the same 
two writers stated: 

Unless the system of provincial aid takes note of these dis¬ 
crepancies (financial strength and total need for services), there 
are but two alternatives open to financially weak areas: abandon 
the basic program or bear an excessive burden of property tax.9 

These statements underline the need for adequate educational 
services throughout Alberta and a sharing of costs that responds 
readily to the financial strengths and weaknesses of the local units. 
This is essentially the problem of rural education. 

Constant reference to the inadequacies still existing in the 
rural areas of Alberta are made in the annual reports of the Depart¬ 
ment of Education. The following comment is typical:

In the large urban schools and the large centralized rural high 
schools the teaching staffs consist mainly of well-trained teachers 
of long experience who have become specialists in their fields of 
instruction* Naturally the teaching results achieved by these 
teachers are, on the whole, quite commendable* In the smaller 
schools, especially the non-standard-instruction schools, the 
teaching results have been quite disappointing • 0 • • One 
reason for this is that the small schools have difficulty in 
retaining good teachers, hence stabilized instruction in them is 
becoming quite rare * 10 

The implications of the above illustrations suggest the need for 
a careful examination of factors affecting educational finance in rural 
Alberta, a study which cannot be entirely divorced from the general 
problem of municipal finance; neither can it be divorced from the demo¬ 
graphic and economic setting within which it operates* 


III. DELIMITATION OF THE STUDY 

Geographical delimitation * Ideally, it would have been very 
desirable to deal with the problem for all of the Canadian provinces. 
However, because of the differences that exist among provinces, and 
in consideration of the availability of detailed data, the study was 
limited to rural Alberta* As a result, all findings apply specifi¬ 
cally to Alberta and only indirectly to the total Canadian pattern. 

Delimitation of the educational task * Only that portion of 
the educational task that falls within the sphere of public school 
education was included in this investigation* Provision for univer¬ 
sity and other post-school training has always presented a serious 
problem in rural areas* Students living in or near urban centres 
where most such facilities are located have a decided advantage

over rural young people. Although this phase of the problem was 
recognized, it was excluded from the study, as was the financial 
problem involved in providing educational services for handicapped 
children# 

Delimitation as to financial responsibility . Despite its 
importance, no treatment was given in the study to the question 
of federal financing of education# Various geographical, economic, 
and demographic factors have caused grave inequities in educational 
opportunity across Canada# However, it was considered advisable to 
keep the investigation within its present constitutional setting# 

Delimitation of time-period # Except for brief treatment of 
certain historical data, the study was concerned with the quarter 
century of time extending from 1931 to 1956# Some consideration 

was given to certain pertinent data that were available for the 
years 1957 and 195 B* 

Delimitation of data # Since rather detailed data were avail¬ 
able from census returns and departmental reports, these constitute 
the major source of information for the study# The data selected 
were those which contributed directly to an analysis of educational 
costs# 

IV# DEFINITION OF TERMS 

Since data for this study were gathered from several different 
types of sources, a problem was encountered with reference to the

interrelationship of statistical information. This was particularly 
true of data on school population and school finances as found in 
annual reports in relation to population figures and financial data 
from census reports; also, some difficulty was encountered in apply¬ 
ing certain economic and sociological terms to the concepts used in 
the study. In adopting specific definitions for certain terms 
efforts were made to insure facility in comparing data without dis¬ 
torting unduly the generally accepted connotations of the terms* 

Demographic trends * The definition of demography as "the sta¬ 
tistical analysis and description of population aggregates, with ref¬ 
erence to distribution, vital statistics, age, sex, and civil status, 
either at a given time or over time" was the one accepted for this 
study.H ¥ith very slight "stretching” it encompassed all sociolog¬ 
ical trends under investigation. This avoided the use of the term 
”sociological” which connotes a broader coverage than that included 
here®. 

Economic trends . In view of the fact that this investigation 
was concerned with social as well as economic features of rural life 
a conception of economics stressing this relationship was desirable. 
Economics was defined as "the science of men’s activities in get¬ 
ting and using wealth, and has for its purpose the better under¬ 
standing of various social arrangements that have been developed to 
further the production and use of wealth, as well as the forces and 
controls that operate within the economic system.”*^ 

Economic trends as developed here involved a consideration of

•‘activities in getting and using wealth”,“social arrangements that 
have been developed”, and “forces and controls that operate” within 
the rural economic system. 

The educational task # It is relatively simple to define the 
educational task in terms of the ideals of modem philosophies of 
education. But such an ethereal definition, while forming a wor¬ 
thy goal toward which to strive, is not subject to quantitative 

measurement, and so would not have met the needs of the short term 
evaluation attempted in this study. The reality of the practical 
situation necessitated a “setting of sights” on a goal that was 
somewhat removed from the ideal. For purposes of this investi¬ 
gation the task of rural education was recognized as that defined 
by society and government, through an interaction of economic, 
social, and other forces within the framework of a basic philosophy 
of education embracing equity in educational opportunity as a goal.-**3 

It was assumed that education in Alberta is moving in the 
direction of the ideal goal, and that greater progress toward the 
goal has been made in urban centres than in rural centres. This was 
accepted as a basic premise for the study. The short term task of 
rural education was defined as that of raising the level of edu¬ 
cational opportunity in rural areas to the level already attained 
in larger urban centres. This definition made possible certain com¬ 
parisons and contrasts that could hardly have been made in terms of 
an “ideal” definition of the task.

as “the perception of a task held at a given time by significant mem¬ 
bers of an organization.**^ The present problem in rural education was 
perceived not primarily as one of interpreting the task of the school 
in terms of facilities, services, and programs of studies, but one of 
providing the funds necessary to maintain the present level of pro¬ 
gress and to move toward a further closing of the gap in educational 
opportunity between rural and urban Alberta. This interpretation of 
the problem seemed to be in line with “the perception of the task” 
held at the time of this study by “significant members” of local and 
provincial administrative agencies. 

Educational load . There is no single and commonly accepted 
definition of educational load; rather, it is a multi-purpose term 
that can be expressed in various ways according to the point of empha¬ 
sis that is desired. Perhaps in its simplest form it is “the relative 
number of children who must be given an education. “3-5 This stresses 
the demographic factor. An analysis of the number of children 
to be educated in relation to the labour force places emphasis on 
the economic load, while a similar analysis in relation to income 
expresses the financial load. 

Since it was the purpose of this study to examine a concom¬ 
itant of several factors which have influenced the cost of rural 
education, an almost all-inclusive definition was required. A. mod¬ 
ification of the above definition was accepted. Educational load 
was conceived as the number of children to be educated relative to 
selected demographic, economic, and financial factors. This made

possible the use of a common denominator for the reduction of data 

to meaningful terms which could be evaluated in terms of dollars 
and cents. 

Ability to support education . Pupil costs, teachers* sal¬ 
aries, and other educational expenditures may be a rough indicator 
of the ability of an administrative unit to support education^ on 
the other hand, these expenditures may indicate effort and not act¬ 
ual ability. By very great effort a poor unit can supply high 
priced services, while a wealthy unit through lack of effort may 
provide mediocre services. Valid conclusions cannot be drawn with¬ 
out regard to the wealth of the unit or units under study.^ 

Ability as here defined arises out of a comparison between 
the wealth of rural Alberta and the number of children that must be 
provided an education. Since the property tax is the main source 
of local revenue for rural education, farm income has been used as 
a measure of wealth. Ability to pay is thus influenced by two var¬ 
iables. 

Rural population . The census classification of the United 
States includes under rural population "inhabitants of incorporated 
places of less than 2,500 and residents in the open country of unin¬ 
corporated territory. 

In Canada the classification adopted in 1951 and used for 
census purposes since that date includes under rural population 
"the population residing outside cities, towns and villages of 
1,000 or more whether or not incorporated and exclusive of census 
metropolitan areas.

Since some incorporated places of more than 1,000 residents 
are included within school divisions in Alberta, a difficulty arose 
in correlating school population figures with census figures* As 
it was hardly possible to adjust the school population data, certain 
places with a population of more than 1,000 and forming a part of 
rural school administrative units were considered as rural* This 
procedure tended slightly to inflate both rural population figures 
and school population data*. This distortion, however, was largely 
counteracted by the inclusion of a considerable number of persons 
living in census metropolitan areas in urban census data by the 
Bureau of Statistics, while their children are included in the 
rural school population in the annual reports of the Department of 
Education* 

Places up to 2,500 in population have certain rural char¬ 
acteristics, particularly in aggregate of pupils, available course 
offerings, and instructional services within the school system® For 
these reasons and because of the administrative uniformity effected 
by their inclusion in school divisions, it is suggested that the 
definition of convenience 0 adopted here is not too unrealistic® 

Rural non-farm population . All persons living in incorpor¬ 
ated places of 1,000 or less, and all persons living in the open 
country on tracts of land not definable as farms are categorized as 
the rural non-farm population of Alberta in this study® In addition, 
the population of a few places with more than 1,000 residents, and

mentioned previously under the definition of rural population was inclu¬ 
ded in the rural non-farm population©^ 

V© SOURCES OF DATA 

Data on population changes, number and size of farms, farm 
income and expenditure, and farm mechanization were drawn from cen¬ 
sus returns published t?y the Bureau of Statistics, Ottawa© These 
reports were available for the years 1931* 193&, 1941* 1946, 1951* 
and 1956. 

Annual data on general expenditures for education and other 
services, school enrolments, taxation assessment figures, provincial 
grants, operational, instructional, conveyance, and capital costs, 
along with debt charges and debenture purchases were available 
from departmental reports of the Government of Alberta and from fed¬ 
eral government statistics© 

General data on school reorganization, types of units, attend¬ 
ance areas, conveyance, and school building programs were drawn from 
reports and published materials© 

VI. TREATMENT OF DATA 

Pertinent historical data on the evolution of the structure 
of local government and the development of the educational system 
in rural Alberta were provided as a framework within which to inter¬ 
pret quantitative data© Brief treatment was also given to the growth 
of the rural tax structure and provincial grants as an aid for the

interpretation of the present provincial-municipal relationship* 

Statistical and descriptive data were organized under the 
various sub-problem areas mentioned heretofore. The analysis of 
sets of data was directed toward indicating the impact of each trend 
upon the financial structure of rural education. 

For purposes of cost comparisons it was necessary to select a 
"base year 11 and relate succeeding data to data for that year. This 
translated actual cost changes into relative changes. 

Finally, all findings were assessed, interpreted and coordin¬ 
ated so as to indicate the effects of the convergence of the several 
trends upon the general problem of financing an adequate educational 
program in rural Alberta. 

VII. OUTLINE OF PROCEDURE FOLLOWED 

A study of the impact of change upon the financing of edu¬ 
cation in rural Alberta could not be divorced entirely from the gen¬ 
eral problem of educational finance for the province; neither could 
it be divorced from the administrative and financial framework which 
has developed in the past, or from the general pattern of municipal 
services, of which education is a part. 

Chapter II provides a sketch of the development of rural munic¬ 
ipal and school administration units in Alberta, together with brief 
treatment of the rural tax base and an analysis of the development of 
provincial aid. Since wide variations exist in administrative and 
financial structures at the local level among the Canadian provinces.

this treatment will lend meaning to analyses included in later chapters 

Chapter III treats the nature and extent of general population 
and school population trends, as well as shifts in the number and dis¬ 
tribution of the labour force* These trends are interpreted in the 
light of their impact upon the educational load and upon the needs 
of education® 

Chapter IV analyses the development of farm mechanization and 
its effect upon farm size, pattern of residence, and land usage: it 
interprets the impact of the change upon educational services and 
needs* 

Chapter V evaluates the buoyancy of the farm economy of Alberta 
in terms of production, prices, and income. General trends and peri¬ 
odical fluctuations are analyzed in the light of their impact upon 
the financing of education. 

Chapter VI gives a brief treatment of provincial and local 
financing of education in Alberta; this provides comparative data 
for an analysis of the financing of rural education. 

Chapter VII provides an analysis of trends in revenue and expen¬ 
ditures of municipal districts and of rural school divisions (counties) 
according to their distribution among various services and among the 
major areas of school costs. 

Chapter VIII deals with the changing needs of education and 
provides an analysis of school accommodations, availability of courses 
and of instructional personnel at the high school level in rural 


Alberta

Chapter IX focuses attention upon the financial impact of the 
demographic, economic, and financial trends which were analyzed in 
earlier chapters, and projects these trends into the future so as to 
show the probable nature and extent of expenditures for education in 
rural Alberta in the decade ahead. 

Chapter X provides a summary of findings, conclusions arrived 
at, and suggested areas for further research.

CHAPTER II 


RURAL LOCAL GOVERNMENT IN ALBERTA 


Problem 

The major question treated in this chapter is: What has been 
the developmental pattern of rural local government in Alberta? 

Sub - Problems 

This involved an examination of trends in the following sub¬ 
problem areas: 

1 . the development of adequate municipal districts; 

2 . the development of adequate units of school administration; 

3 * the process of uniting school and other municipal functions 

4 o the support of rural municipal functions; 

5 . the financing of rural education; 

6 * the sharing of the costs of rural education* 

I. RURAL MUNICIPAL ADMINISTRATIVE UNITS 
The Pre - Natal Years 

The territory which now comprises the Province of Alberta was 
formerly a part of the domain of the Hudson*s Bay Company. In 1870 
this tract of land was purchased by the Dominion of Canada and became 
a part of the Northwest Territories.^ 

In 1875 the Northwest Territories Act was passed. It provided 
for the government of the area by ordinances of the Lieutenant 
Governor who was to be assisted by a council of five members. Among 










21 


the powers delegated to the Council was that of framing ordinances 

for the establishment of municipalities. Such municipalities as 

might be set up were to be granted full power of taxation for local 

purposes. The territorial department of public works was to admin- 

2 

ister municipal affairs. The "full power of taxation clause n dis¬ 
couraged the formation of municipalities, the word ’’tax 11 having been 

3 

even more odious than it is today. 

However, as the population was augmented by a considerable 
influx of settlers from Ontario, there was considerable agitation 
for municipal government, as well as for some voice on the North¬ 
west Territories Council.^ Eventually the Dominion government made 

provision for elected representatives on the Council.^ The elected 

6 

members strongly championed the cause of local self-government. 

In 1883 an ordinance of the Council provided for the organ¬ 
ization of single township rural municipalities and set up a com¬ 
mittee appointed from the department of municipal affairs to deal 

7 

with applications for incorporation. Governmental agencies soon 
learned that a superimposed structure of local government modelled 
on the pattern in Ontario would not function well in the broad expan¬ 
ses of the prairies where development was still in the pioneer stage. 
The ordinance was unrealistic as it provided for: 

a system of local government for the rural areas which was 
too elaborate and too expensive for the stage of the coun¬ 
try^ development and no additional municipalities were 

organized.8

the legislation commented: 

It was another attempt to transplant Ontario institutions, 
at least in part, into a more sparsely settled territory 
where local conditions differed greatly from those in older 

Canada*9 

The problems growing out of the vast distances of the prairies 
and the system of landholding which necessitated widely scattered 
homesteads were difficult indeed* Municipal development moved but 
slowly* The government, recognizing the need for some form of local 
organization to look after road improvement and fire protection, 
devised a system of special districts* An ordinance passed in 1887 
provided for the establishment of statute labour and fire districts 
in territorial areas not organized as rural municipalities* An 
overseer elected by the residents of occupied land was placed in 
charge of each such district* These were one township units. 

In 1896 the organization of statute labour districts was 
made compulsory and the name was changed to n local improvement 
districts.^ 

A major step forward was taken in 1897 when the inhabitants 

of the Northwest Territories won the rights of responsible govern- 
12 

ment* This meant a democratically elected assembly with a respon¬ 
sible cabinet* Local participation was provided by committees 
which administered the local improvement districts* Again, it was 
found that the administrative area was too small, and, as a result, all 

improvement districts were in 1903 reorganized into units of four 
13 

townships each. Each township was represented by an elected coun-

cillor at such time as the improvement district requested municipal 
status* The local council had oversight over statute labour and 
administered the expenditure of the funds allocated to its districts<,^ 

Alberta is Born 

By 1905 immigration to the Northwest Territories had increased 

the population to the extent that the Dominion government saw fit to 

15 

create two new provinces, one of which was Alberta* It should be 
observed that when Alberta became a province the problem of the organ¬ 
ization of adequate rural administrative units was still far from 

, , 16 

solved. 

The Formative Years 

No basic policy in local administrative machinery was developed 

17 

during the first few years of the existence of the nex/ province. 

However, in 1912 a minister of municipal affairs was appointed and the 

problem of municipal government was attacked in earnest* The rural 

areas of the province were divided into larger local improvement dis- 

18 

tricts, each including about nine of the former townships. Provision 

was ras.de for the conversion of these districts into rural municipalities 

(later to be known as municipal districts) as soon as the population

reached three hundred twenty four. 

The rural municipalities had an elected council which carried 
on local government functions; however, the local improvement dis¬

ted council. 

No major changes took place either in the size of local admin¬ 
istrative units or in the structure of local government machinery 
during the next thirty years. However, a large number of local improve¬ 
ment districts achieved municipal district status, while a number were

II, SCHOOL ADMINISTRATIVE UNITS IN RURAL ALBERTA 

Rural Education in its Infancy 

The first schools in the territory which later became the pro¬ 
vince of Alberta were operated by Roman Catholic missionaries for the 

benefit of Metis children. Some of these M temporary” schools existed 

22 

as early as the 1840*s,~~ 

It appears quite definite from historical research that Father 
Lacombe established the first ’’permanent” school near the site of the 
present city of Edmonton in 1862, During the next few years a con¬ 
siderable number of such mission schools were established by Pro- 

23 

testant and Roman Catholic missionaries. 

In 1870 when the government of Rupert*s Land and the Northwest 
Territories was transferred from the Hudson*s Bay Company to the 
Dominion of Canada, the Lieutenant Governor of Manitoba had jurisdiction 
over the new region as well, A council comprised chiefly of residents 
of Manitoba was appointed to advise the Lieutenant Governor, Lack of 
interest on the part of council members, together with the serious

obstacles of distance and lack of facilities for communication, guar¬ 
anteed little interference in the control of education that had been 

2/ 

enjoyed for a number of years by church groups. * 

An educational clause in the Northwest Territories Act of 
1375 made provision for separate schools, thus lending support to 
the type of school system set up in Ontario. The clause, however, was 
rendered ineffective by the fact that no machinery was created either 
for the establishment of or the support of such schools. Indeed, it 
would have been next to impossible to devise machinery for the ade¬ 
quate support of separate schools under the pattern of settlement 

25 

that prevailed at the time. The sparsity factor thus early became 
one of the most perplexing and widespread problems of rural education 
in the Canadian prairies. 

The Northwest Territories Act of 1884 made provision for a 
territorial council which had the power to pass school ordinances. 
Thus, the source of local government was placed nearer to those being 
governed. These provisions meant more control from formally con- 

26 

stituted government agencies and less control by religious groups. 

The authority to organize new school districts was placed with 
the newly appointed Territorial Council. As soon as there were ten 
children of school age in any settlement which petitioned for a 
school, authority could be granted for the establishment of a public 
or separate school. A degree of financial assistance was given by 
the federal government; however, most of the money for the support of 
a local school was raised through a levy on the rateable property in

the school district. 

28 

Four school districts were set up in 1884« This is of signif¬ 
icance since it indicates that the first local administrative units 
in the territories were for school purposes. 

Beginning in 1885 a standing committee on education was appointed 
at every session of the council. In addition, a board of education was 

set up for ‘‘the control and management of educational interests in the 

29 

Northwest Territories.” The board was made up of an equal number of 

Protestant and Roman Catholic members with the Lieutenant Governor as 
30 

chairman. This was very similar to the system of educational admin¬ 
istration which prevailed in Quebec. For a few years it seemed as if 
this was to be the accepted pattern of development for the territories. 
However, the great influx of settlers from Ontario caused a swing toward 

the system that prevailed in that province. The ordinance of 1892 

31 

confirmed the permanent pattern of development. 

The problem of too few pupils within a local school district 
led to financial difficulties. Even though teachers were grossly under¬ 
paid, costs of instruction per pupil were relatively high for a very 

meagre educational fare. Early efforts to counteract the problem of 

32 

”scatter” were not too successful. Although provision had been 
made for the consolidation of two or more school districts, there was 
but little enthusiasm among the pioneers for such an arrangement; 
rather there was a tendency to press demands for smaller districts, 
particularly in areas where the density of population had made neces¬ 
sary a consideration of additional classroom space.^3 Distance from

school was of great concern to parents 0 It still is today® 

The trend away from consolidation was partially counteracted 
in 1901 when a provision was made (by school ordinance) empowering 
trustees to arrange for the conveyance of children within the bounds 

3/ 

of a school district. However, the people concerned had not yet 
developed a working concept of school conveyance and very little pro¬ 
gress was made either in the way of enlarged districts or of the con- 

35 

solidation of existing districts. 

Years of Evolution 

At the time of its creation (September, 1905) the Province of 
Alberta was not called upon to create a school system. Under the 
various territorial ordinances previously mentioned, the organization 
of school administrative units had progressed to the extent of 602 
organized school districts. Few changes were made in the structural 
machinery, but authority was transferred to a department of education 
under a responsible minister. 

The Minister of Education had among his duties "the creation 
of new school districts, to alter existing boundaries, to arrange for 
the training of teachers, the inspection of schools, and the exam¬ 
ination and promotion of pupils. 1 * School boards were authorized to 
"erect new schools, issue debentures as security for loans, to levy 

and collect taxes, to engage teachers, and generally to manage the 

37 

affairs of school districts.” This was in line with the "interna” 

and "externa” functions of school authorities as perceived by Ryerson 
38 

in Upper Canada. 










28 


Much of the work of both provincial and local education author¬ 
ities during the early years was in connection with the organization 
of new districts# Although the initative rested with the local 
residents, a new district could not be formed until its boundaries 
were approved by the department of education# The basic requirements 

were eight or more children of school age and four or more resident 

39 

ratepayers within the proposed district* 

It might be assumed that with the final authority for the bound¬ 
aries of school and municipal districts resting with the central 
authority that there would be considerable uniformity, but such was not 
the case* The growth of municipal districts was quite independent of 
school district development# It was not unusual for a school district 
to contain parts of two or more municipal or local improvement dis¬ 
tricts* The overlapping of boundaries thus began with the creation 
of the very first local administrative units# 

Few extensive changes took place in the administration of rural 
education during Alberta*s first quarter-century as a province# However, 
the number of small school districts increased rapidly to reach over 
3>200 by 1921#^ The problems connected with the administration of 
a school system comprised of many small units were numerous indeed* 

Since there was little or no diversification of crops within a small 
school district, a crop failure was a real disaster# In addition, land 
values varied widely from district to district, as did total assessment 
and tax burdens*^ 

It was evident long before the depression years that all was

not Well with the system of school administration in rural Alberta. 
During the 1920 f s some progress was made with the organization of 
consolidated school districts, but this did but little to improve the 
situation. Although larger than the small school district, the con¬ 
solidated district was still too small to improve appreciably school 
finance. And consolidation, being entirely voluntary, moved very 
slowly. 

In a few instances the development of rural high school facil¬ 
ities made advanced instruction available to considerable numbers of 
rural students, but this was a very small step toward a solution to 
the major problems plaguing rural education. 

Years of Revolution 

In 1936 the legislature of Alberta authorized the Department 
of Education to adopt a policy of combining numbers of small school 
districts to form larger units to be known as divisions. This policy 
revolutionized the administrative machinery of rural education. The 
intent of the legislation was clear and decisive. The new plan was 
explained to the public and possible boundaries were discussed, but 
no plebiscites were held to assess public opinion. The divisions were 
established by ministerial orders. Eleven divisions were formed in 
1936;^ by 1941 the number had risen to fifty.^ 

There were several reasons for the rapidity with which reorgan¬ 
ization was carried out. The need was urgent. Many small districts 
in drought stricken areas were bankrupt and many others were having

serious financial problems* Furthermore, two former experiences 
with larger units of administration had indicated the advantages of 
reorganization.^ 

It was not found possible to permit a choice of the school 
division in which a school district would be included, because of 

i / 

the need to maintain a degree of uniformity in the size of divisions* 4 

However, care was taken when fixing boundaries to include a number of 

47 

school districts comprising a M geographical unit*” 

The legislation providing for the establishment of school 

divisions applied only to rural school districts, but provision was 

made for the inclusion of town, village, consolidated, and separate 

school districts upon request* Once a division was erected its board 

could negotiate with other local boards within its bounds regarding 

inclusion agreements*” Thus a division ordinarily included forty or 

49 

more rural districts, plus a few towns and villages* 

The erection of a school division did not necessarily imply 
an actual consolidation of school plants; rather, it implied finan¬ 
cial consolidation and a shifting of responsibility from the local 
board of trustees to the board of the enlarged unit. However, the new 
arrangement definitely encouraged consolidation through opening up an 
avenue of concerted effort on the part of local districts. 

The local districts comprising a division were grouped into 
three to five sub-divisions, each of which elected a trustee to the 
divisional board. Educational services were administered from a

central office by the executive officers of the board—the superintendent 

50 

(provincially appointed) and secretary-treasurer. From the first, the 

divisional boards were quite independent of municipal councils, having 
been made fiscally independent through legislation permitting them to 
requisition councils for sums sufficient to meet their annual budgets,, 
This situation resulted from the view that education was of sufficient 
importance to be placed in a preferred position. Only recently has 
this relationship been questioned. It has now become a rather important 
aspect of the whole question of rural municipal finance. 

III. TOWARD A UNION OF RURAL ADMINISTRATIVE UNITS 

While the small school districts were undergoing trying times 
in the 30*s a similar struggle was taking place within many munic¬ 
ipal districts. Hard hit by drought and loss of markets, some of 
them succumbed. In their places special municipal areas administered 
by the Department of Municipal Affairs were set up. The situation 
clearly indicated the need for reorganization on the basis of larger 
municipal units*^ 

The organization of school divisions pointed the way for 
municipal reorganization. This provided the seed that later was to 
produce a union of school and municipal functions in the county 
system.

been several times larger than the small school districts, were sev¬ 
eral times smaller than the new divisions* Furthermore, the large 
school units soon proved to be much more efficient than the small units 
had been* These facts were not overlooked by the Department of Municipal 
Affairs which was struggling with the problems of municipal finance* 

Finally, in 1941 legislation was enacted which provided for 

52 

larger municipal districts® The legislation was not compulsory as 
that for school reorganization had been, no doubt because the sit¬ 
uation in 1941 was somewhat less acute* Nevertheless, the dissolution 
of the old and the creation of the new moved rapidly. In the short 
space of three years reorganization was practically complete (inclu¬ 
ding the reorganization of local improvement districts). The number 
of municipalities was thus reduced from 143 in 1942 to 60 in 1944? 

53 

with 42 being large districts and the balance comparatively small ones. 

The new municipal districts were organized into wards, from 

54 

each of which one councillor was elected* The only remnant of the 
old organization that remained was the transfer of many former secre¬ 
tary-treasurers to the office staffs of the new units® Administrative 

offices were usually set up in a town or village that was centrally 
55 

located. 

Although the trend in both municipal and school organization 
was toward larger units of administration, there had been no attempt 
to synchronize the two changes or to provide for co-terminous boundaries. 
Five years elapsed between the legislation providing for school divisions 
and that providing for enlarged municipal districts; and, when the latter

were erected, township and range lines often defined the boundaries® 
Thus there still remained the problem of overlapping boundaries among 
the various units of local administration* This led to confusion in 
the allocation of financial responsibility for local services. As 
early as 1946 legislation was enacted which ma.de provision for a 
non-voting member from each local body (school board and municipal 
council) to attend the meetings of the other and to participate in 
pertinent discussions.^ This improved relations somewhat but did 
little to solve the basic problems. 

Permissive Union 

Problem solving had been the keynote of administrative changes 
in Alberta from the time of its birth as a province. The solutions 
to some problems had created new problems. Some of them were major 
problems. But Alberta had never become reconciled to living perman¬ 
ently with problems by accepting them as inevitable. As a result, 
more changes have taken place here than in any other province with 
respect to municipal reorganization and greater progress has been 
ms.de o 

As a result of serious probings for a solution to the most 
pressing problems in local government, the idea of the Alberta county 
was conceived. It differed from the county system in any other pro¬ 
vince in Canada by virtue of the fact that it purported to combine 

57 

all local services in rural areas under single councils. 

The County Act was passed in 1950. It provided permissive 
legislation whereby counties could be created by the Lieutenant

Governor in Council upon receipt of a resolution from the board of a 
school division or from a municipal council comprising a major portion 
of the area included in the contemplated reorganization. 5 The legis¬ 
lation provided for the appointment of three major committees, namely, 

59 

a municipal committee, a school committee, and a health committee. 
Certain provisions for the co-opting of additional members to commit¬ 
tees were included in the new act, but all major decisions and com¬ 
plete administrative and financial responsibility were placed with 
the council (made up of not more than eleven councillors elected, one 
each, from electoral divisions).^ 

County organization, being of an experimental nature, was lim¬ 
ited initially to four units. Provisions were made for the calling 
of a plebiscite after four years of operation to determine if the 
electors concerned wished to retain county status or revert to their 
previous form of local government. In spite of the controversy that 
had raged prior to and during the passage of the act, there was no 
delay in the setting up of counties. The first two were established 
in 1951, and by 1958 ten such units were in existence.In no instance 
has a county been voted out of existence. This should not be inter¬ 
preted to mean that the county system provided an "open sesame” to 
financial bliss for rural municipalities, but it does mean a reason¬ 
able degree of success for the county form of local administration. 

The complex problems arising out of the ox^erlapping of the 
boundaries of various types of local administrative units have been 
noted earlier. These same problems rose up to plague local

administrators interested in county development. Finally, in 1953 

a commission was appointed to lay out boundaries common to school 

divisions and municipal districts. The reallocation of boundaries 

which was completed in 1955 removed most of the confusion resulting 

from overlapping boundaries* The work of the Goteminous Boundary 

Commission prepared the way for future county development. The 

present indications are that the county may eventually become the 

63 

unit of rural local government throughout Alberta. 

IV. THE RURAL TAX BASE 

During the period that local units of administration were 
being created, the need for more and better local services was 
acute. This was particularly true of schools, roads and bridges. 

The province, suffering from insufficient revenue, was anxious to 
turn over these responsibilities to the local residents; thus the 
urgency for transforming local improvement districts into full- 
fledged municipal districts. However, the local people early recog¬ 
nized the ”sugar coating” covering the ”bitter pill of increased 
taxes” and stoutly resisted Administrative responsibility was 
opposed because of implied financial responsibility. The proper 
relationship between the two has been a source of continuing pro¬ 
blems in provincial-municipal relationships. 

The Land Tax 


The tax on land, the major source of revenue of rural munici¬ 
palities, was instituted at a time when the population of Alberta was 





36 


predominantly rural and the economy was largely agricultural* At 
that time land was a reasonably reliable index of ability to pay; also, 
the land tax was easily administered and collected. The provincial 
government could more readily administer newer forms of taxes on more 
intangible forms of wealth than could the local agencies of administra¬ 
tion. It was, therefore, quite natural that the tax base for the 
municipalities should be a levy on land. 

Through the years there has been but slight broadening of the 
tax base in rural Alberta. Farmers became accustomed to land as the 
yardstick of ability to pay taxes and had little enthusiasm for the 
inclusion of buildings and improvements as assessable property. During 
the land boom period of the early 1900®s there was little cause for 
anxiety 0 Land assessments moved steadily upward and the mill rate 
limit was removed as a result of the demand for increased services. 

But farmers were prosperous and could afford to pay. The most buoy- 

65 

ant sector of Alberta*s economy was agriculture. 

Then came the depression days of the 1920*3. Many farmers 

were unable to pay their taxes, particularly in areas that had been 

hard hit by drought. Some municipalities were forced into bankruptcy 

and reverted in status to special districts under the supervision of 

66 

the Department of Municipal Affairs. 

It is worthy of note that as a result of legislation passed 
in 1916 towns and villages were permitted to levy taxes on buildings 
and improvements and to initiate a business tax©^ This broadened tax 
base stabilized revenues and did much to strengthen urban municipal

finance. But there was no corresponding change in the tax base in 
rural areas, and, consequently, no increase in revenue stability. 


37 


The increasing demand for most agricultural products during 
and immediately following World War II, accompanied by high prices, 
placed Alberta farmers in a much better position to meet their tax 
obligations. Farm assessments again increased rapidly in response 
to the demand for more and better local services. These new obli¬ 
gations had to be met at the local level largely out of the rev¬ 
enue producing ability of the narrow land tax base. 

The Tax Load 

Meanwhile Alberta had been undergoing a metamorphosis: she 

was rapidly changing from an agricultural to an industrial economy. 

This meant a rural to urban shift in population and a decrease in the 

relative importance of agriculture in the provincial economy; also, 

68 

as industrialization developed, self-sufficiency waned. Special¬ 
ization, mass production, technological advances, and concentration 
of industries in urban centres were impinged on an agricultural econ¬ 
omy. And urbanization was not the only result. Farming itself was 

69 

transformed from a !, way of life” to the realms of big business. 

Problems of local government increased both in degree and in 
kind. There were pressing demands made of education and other 
services already in existence, and new demands were made. The decline 
in individual self-sufficiency caused the citizens to rely more and 
more upon the institution of government for protection against new

forces that could not be individually resisted* Government, even at 
the local level, ceased to be looked upon primarily as a supplier of 
a few essential services. The new demands were centred largely in 
the sphere of health and welfare. But along with the expansion of 
old services and the creation of new ones, there were no additional 
sources of revenue made available to rural municipalities. 

Inadequacy of the Land Tax 

It has often been suggested that land is no longer a reliable 
yardstick of ability to pay taxes. It would appear that there is some 
foundation for such a statement. Land owners as a class and building 
owners as a class, although at one time almost identical, gradually 
diverged. In the early days when grain farming was all-important in 
Alberta, acreage was a reasonable measure for assessed valuation. 

With the change to other types of farming, particularly dairying, hog 
production, and mixed farming operations, emphasis was shifted from 
extent of acreage. Portions of formerly high assessed land became 
low assessed pasture land, while ability to pay may have actually inc¬ 
reased. Also, many farms of small acreage had well constructed and 
well equipped buildings. The owners enjoyed a very modest land tax 
levy, while their off-the-farm earnings greatly enhanced their ability 
to pay. However, the assessment of farm buildings and improvements has 
remained unpopular with farmers. 

As early as 1936 a Saskatchewan commission of inquiry presented 
findings to support a broadening of the rural tax base;

The Commission believes that buildings and improvements 
should be assessed at 100 per cent value... .Exclusion of the 
value of buildings or improvements from assessment represents 
a departure from the theory under lying the ad valorem taxation 
of property. By excluding almost entirely the value of buildings 
and improvements from the assessment base in rural municipalities 
...the burden of taxation has been thrust inordinately upon land 
owners. This has reduced the desirability of investment in land, 
and the security of tenure of land holders. Assessment of build¬ 
ings at 100 per cent of fair, actual value could remove the present 
tax discrimination against the land owner, a factor that has 
driven thousands of parcels of land into tax sales and the hands 
of municipalities and further narrowed the tax base. 70 

Goldenberg in his report on provincial-municipal relations in 

British Columbia indicated that 

land has proved to be an unstable basis for taxation since it 
is subject to a high degree of inflation and deflation and that, 
while the argument that the exemptions of improvements stim¬ 
ulates building and penalizes the land speculator may have merit 
in the period of early development of a community, it is not as 
applicable to the later period when the community has been dev¬ 
eloped. The results...were to restrict taxation to a narrow and 
unstable base which could not satisfy the requirements in the 
developed stage of community growth, and to subsidize the holders 
of large improved properties whose properties require extensive 
municipal services and who in most instances have greater tax 
paying capacity than the owners of small properties and vacant 
lands.71 

Goldenberg suggested a 75 per cent assessment of buildings 
and improvements, but added that such inclusion would serve to redis¬ 
tribute the tax burden rather than increase appreciably the current 
revenue from taxation. 

There is yet another factor which has tended to increase the 
tax burden on assessable land. Several kinds of property are com¬ 
pletely exempt from taxation, including churches, schools, proper¬ 
ties of charitable institutions, and certain federal and provincial 
government properties. Exemptions such as these become steadily more 





40 

valuable to their owners as the costs of local government push the 
tax rate and assessment upward; or, from the standpoint of the local 
taxpayers, these exemptions become steadily more expensive» 

Land Taxation Assessments 

During the years that municipal authorities were raising a major 
portion of their revenue from the land tax with little aid from the 
provincial government, and when such aid was not based on property 
assessment, the need for a province-wide equalization of assessment 
was not readily apparent. However, as early as 1918, because of inade¬ 
quacies in local assessment procedures, and more particularly because 

of the existence of a provincial land tax, a provincial director of 

72 

assessments was appointed. 

As a result of recommendations made by the Judge Commission on 
Taxation (1948), the province made assessment services available to the 
municipalities and agreed to participate in the cost of the services. 
Participation was on a voluntary basis and so did not become province- 
wide. 73 

At present the director of assessments is assisted by inspectors 
in the establishment of equalized assessments for all municipalities. 
The assessment on an;/ parcel of land can be cancelled and a new one 
made. The secretary-treasurer of each municipality submits an assess¬ 
ment roll annually to the director, who compares all such rolls so 
that the assessment of rateable property in all districts will be 
’•fair and equitable” as between one another. The approved evaluation

becomes the equalized assessment to be used for determining the land 
tax for each taxpayer* This assessment is also used as a basis for 
determining all provincial grants that are based on property valu¬ 
ations* 

Although this concerted action has been instrumental in guar¬ 
anteeing a degree of uniformity in assessment throughout Alberta, 
there still remain problems arising out of fertility, location, land 
use, and other factors which make a fair assessment of all parcels 
of land a difficult task* 

Provincial vs* Local Taxation 

It has been recognized that the failure of local authorities 
in the past to raise the level of their educational and other services, 
resulted to a minor degree from their lack of appreciation of the need 
for more and better services, and to a major degree from the inadequate 
revenue producing ability of a narrow tax base. The freedom of choice 
possessed by a small local unit was confined to the limits imposed by 
the taxpayers® ability to bear the financial burden. In many munici¬ 
palities the freedom to decide was more theoretical than real. This 
situation suggested the possibility of turning over certain tax fields 
to the municipalities. However, apart from the administrative problems 
involved, there were more obvious reasons why the newer forms of tax¬ 
ation were not suited to local collection: under local administration 
some municipalities would become tax-rich while others would reap but 
little or no benefit. The alternative was increased grants from the

V* EDUCATION GRANTS 

Early School Gr ants 

The payment of monies by the senior government to local educa¬ 
tion authorities in Alberta is not a recent innovation. Actually 
provisions were made for this method of financing education as early 
as 1878 when the province was still a part of the Northwest Territories* 
and a small grant was paid on an annual basis. This was the first 
step toward state aided schools in the Territories. In 1879 the Lieu¬ 
tenant Governor requested aid from the federal treasury to the extent 
of one-half the salaries paid to teachers. No action was taken at the 
time* but the request established the basis upon which federal grants 
were paid in 1881. Thus direct assistance to local school boards in 
the area now comprising Alberta began almost eighty years ago.^ y 

The ordinance of 1884 which provided for the organization of 
schools in the Northwest Territories* besides authorizing direct 
property taxation for the support of schools* made available direct 
financial support from the federal treasury in the form of cond.it- 
ional grants.' Beginning in 1885 grants were no longer paid entirely 

on the basis of teachers* salaries, but took into consideration the 

77 

qualifications of teachers. Steps were also taken to encourage reg- 
78 79 

ular attendance* efficient instruction, and manageable class sizes 

8o 

through the payment of incentive grants. 

The value placed upon the proper qualification of teachers was

indicated in the ordinance of 1888 by the inclusion of an incentive 

grant equal to seventy-five per cent of the salary of each teacher 

holding a first-class certificate. The same ordinance provided a 

stimulation grant designed to improve attendance in scattered rural 

areas by a special payment to all schools which achieved a stated 

percentage of attendance. The early pattern of school aid clearly 

indicates the manipulation of grants so as to encourage preconceived 

ends on the pant of the parent government. 

The provision for the support of separate high school rooms was 

first initiated in 1890 when a special grant for each such room with 

fifteen or more pupils in attendance was provided when instruction was 

8"1 

given by a duly accredited high school teacher. u This marks the 
beginning of a system of grants that was to become steadily, more com¬ 
plicated. However, measured by pioneer standards, the grants from 

82 

the federal treasury were very generous and were much appreciated.° 

The complexity of the grants system was increased in 1892 by 
a formula which included teachers 1 salaries, qualifications, average 
daily attendance of pupils, enrolments in excess of ten pupils, and 

go 

enrolments in grades above standard three. ^ Regular grants could 
amount to a maximum of seventy per cent of teachers 1 salaries. A 

favourable inspector*s report could raise the grant above the usual 
84 

maximum. 

¥hile the early system of grants encouraged the lengthening 
of the school year, regu3.ar attendance, and improvements in the 
qualifications of teachers, there were no equalization factors. 



44 


Practically the same aid went to all districts regardless of location, 

35 

population or wealth. No further major changes took place in the 

school grants structure until after the turn of the century. 

The School Grants Ordinance of 1901 was the first to provide 

a differentiation between rural or village and town school districts 

for grants purposes. A rather ingenious device based on acreage was 

applied to rural school districts in an effort to keep the area served 

86 

by a school small enough to provide easy access by all pupils; also, 

there was a special grant for all schools that were open for more 

37 

than 160 days. However, the grant formerly paid for the employ- 

38 

ment of a first class teacher practically disappeared. 

The provisions of 1901 constitute the first attempt to give 
recognition to the special problems of rural education in what is 
now the Province of Alberta. In addition to the grants based on the 
area of the school district and days in session, a graduated grant 
based on school attendance was provided. It could amount to as high 
as twenty-five cents per day if attendance reached over eighty per 


cent. 


39 


Town and village schools did not fare as well as rural districts, 

except in the case of grants based on teachers® salaries and inspec- 
90 

tion reports. 7 Another feature of significance to rural education was 

introduced in 1901. Conveyance of school children was recognized as 

a problem. In cases of school consolidation where conveyance of 

pupils was involved, the district supplying the conveyance received 
91 

a special grant. 7 However, rapid growth in school population so

increased the strain on territorial finances that in 1904 the prefer- 

92 

ential treatment accorded rural schools was largely wiped out. All 

in all the total amount expended on education by the Territorial 

Council increased considerably, but the amount per pupil dropped off 

93 

sharply as the school population grew* This meant that the proportion 
of educational expenditures borne by the land tax moved steadily up¬ 
ward o Such was the trend in educational finance when Alberta was 
created in 1905o 

Provincial Aid to Education 

For the first few years of the existence of Alberta few changes 
were made in the grants* structure as inherited from the territorial 
administration. When revisions were made in 1913? the distinction 
between rural and urban schools was retained, with the former receiving 
preferential treatmentIn spite of this, rural education suffered 
from the effects of poorly built and ill-equipped buildings, poorly 
qualified and transient teachers, and poor attendance by pupils,. 

Indirect assistance was provided rural pupils under the reg¬ 
ulations governing the payment of high school grants. No grant was 
payable to any district which collected tuition fees, regardless of 

the place of residence of any pupil seeking admission. Thus rural 

95 

pupils could attend urban high schools tuition free. 

The payment of conveyance grants was carried a step further in 
1913. Not only were conveyance grants increased, but in consolidated 
districts the total grants available equalled the amounts that would

have been paid if each district had operated its own school,. This 
evidence indicates an effort to overcome the disadvantages inherent in 
the small school district. The future importance of the original idea 
of consolidation has been expressed thus: 

The consolidated districts were...the forerunners of the 
present large school units and it is of interest to see such 
early encouragement of that advanced idea.97 

In the legislation of 1913 no provision was made for grants 
on the basis of the smallness of the area served by the school. This 
change, together with the increase in conveyance grants, suggests that 
the idea of school districts conveniently small for all children to 
be within easy walking distance was giving way to the idea of larger 
attendance areas with conveyance provided for all children beyond a 
reasonable walking distance from the school. 

It was also in 1913 that provisions were made for the payment 

of special grants for agricultural and gardening courses in rural 

schools, and industrial arts, household economics, and physical edu- 

98 

cation in urban schools. This was clearly an attempt to encourage 
the development of curricula to meet the needs of rural and urban 
pupils by the provision of pre-vocational training. 

Legislation passed in 1919 indicated a willingness on the part 
of the provincial government to assume a larger share of the cost of 
providing high school facilities for rural pupils. The daily grant 
per room was doubled in two-room rural schools, if six or more pupils 
were enrolled in grades above the eighth, and providing the senior 
teacher met the prescribed qualifications standard. The grant was 




47 


not payable if fees were charged for non-resident pupils® 

As a further incentive to higher standards in education, con¬ 
veyance grants were again increased,and considerable financial 
assistance was available for the construction of teacherages.’^'*" It 
was felt that proper accommodation would enable rural boards to obtain 
and to hold better qualified teachers* 

There were few significant changes in the school grants struc¬ 
ture in Alberta during the 1920®s, although rural consolidations were 
further encouraged through increases in the daily rate per room; also, 
in 1926 the principle of equalization was introduced in school grants 
designed to encourage districts with low assessments to keep their 
schools open for the minimum desirable number of days (160 days per 

■J Qp 

year). A special daily grant was paid to each section in which the 

103 

assessment fell below $25,000® This lightening of the tax load 
enabled many boards to operate their schools for more days than were 
previously possible* This grant was particularly effective during 
the depression years of the 1930*s/^ 

Changes in the school grant structure in Alberta during the 
mid 1930*s were not representative of the best in educational think¬ 
ing in Alberta but rather were prompted by dire necessity. By 1934 
the financial picture had worsened to the extent that the former 
procedure of basing school grants on teachers* salaries was again 
resorted to. Grants could not be earned in excess of 75 per cent of 
salaries paid.'*' 0 '’ 

All sorts of temporary measures were taken by the legislators

of Alberta in an attempt to keep schools open. As the depression 
deepened, however, the number of schools operating part time or not 
at all steadily increased. However, with the formation of school 
divisions and the economic prosperity that accompanied the war the 
financing of education was re-established on a sounder basis. 

In 194^ a new formula was used for the computation of school 

grants, one of the basic features of which was a grant based on 

assessed valuation per weighted classroom; also, the grant was 

graded according to the level of instruction carried on in each 
107 

classroom,, The new formula largely eliminated the many special 
grants of former years. 

With the general prosperity of the war and post-war years, and 
the rapid development of motor transport, school conveyance became 
one of the major items of expense in rural areas. Consolidation had 
become widely accepted throughout rural Alberta. This was due in 
part to the teacher shortage which left many small schools with an 
inadequately qualified teacher or, in many cases, none at all. The 
province came to the aid of school divisions in this rapidly growing 
expenditure. The old daily grant per conveyance was replaced by a 

10g 

rather complicated formula involving a number of variables. 

There were numerous other features in the 1946 grants regu¬ 
lations such as grants to unorganized territories, grants for 
specialist teachers and equipment, and bonuses for isolated tea¬ 
chers, all of which had existed previously. Thus, although there 
was little that was basically new in the grants structure, the 





49 


equalization factor received greater emphasis® Districts with low 

assessment received more; others received less® The principle that 

all units should make some contribution to educational expenditures 

was enforced by the provision that ”the total grants to be paid to 

any division or district were not to be in excess of eighty per cent 

109 

of current expenditure.” 

During the decade between 1946 and 1956 the basic structure of 
school grants remained much the same as that introduced in 1946. How¬ 
ever, as costs moved steadily upward in the post-war years, practically 
all of the major grants were greatly increased® This meant that the 
provincial government was assuming annually a growing proportion of 
the total costs of education® It should be observed, however, that 
there was a decrease in emphasis on equalization. 

In 194^ assessments were revised upward. This meant that the 
amount paid by the province as equalization grants was considerably 
reduced.The reductions were offset by increases in other forms of 
grants. In 1949 and 1950 equalization grants were again reduced, 
while transportation grants were considerably increased, as were 
classroom grants.The apparent reason for the shift in emphasis 
was that the rapidly increasing costs of education had placed a con¬ 
siderable financial burden on all local authorities. The adjustment 

benefited all units more or less equally, while some units benefited 

112 

but little from the system of equalization grants in effect. 

In 1950 and thereafter there were very large annual increases 
in school enrolment in Alberta, particularly in urban centres, and

classroom space became a serious problem. As a result the School 

Borrowing Assistance Act was passed. It was designed to provide cap- 

113 

ital funds to local authorities at low interest rates. But the 
provision of additional classroom space was only a part of the pro¬ 
blem. More equipment, supplies, teaching and other services were 
required. To meet this situation the Abnormal Enrolment Grant was 
devised. This grant was payable if the percentage increase in 
enrolment in any school unit was greater than the average increase 
for Alberta* 1 ^ 

By 1954 the provincial government was paying over forty per 
cent of the costs of transportation incurred by school divisions. 

In the same year greater emphasis was placed on equalization. This 
directly benefited many rural areas which were suffering from the 
effects of low assessments.A revised method of computing class¬ 
room grants had the effect of increasing further the proportion of 
conveyance costs met by the province. Categories were set up for the 
number of pupils conveyed and these were assigned a classroom equiv¬ 
alent for grants purposes.Of further assistance to rural areas 
was the provision of a grant of $5000.00 to each newly organized 
school district toward the cost of providing a school plant. 

VI. EDUCATIONAL SIGNIFICANCE 

Many of the problems that have beset rural local government 
in Alberta have their origins in the past--even before the creation 
of the province in 1905. "Government from a distance" is not too

effective at any time* It was particularly ineffective in the pioneer 
days when space presented so serious a problem in transportation and 
communication that the territorial council had little or no practical 
knowledge of the territory it governed. 

The vast prairie lands required an organizational structure ,, all 
their own”; instead, they received a superimposed structure borrowed 
from Ontario, It did not fit well. The story of municipal district 
development has been one of constant alteration of a "garment” that was 
a misfit in the beginning. 

The system of land survey produced no better results. The assum¬ 
ption that quarter-section holdings constituted adequate farm acreages 
was faulty indeed. Soil fertility and productivity were given little 
consideration. The reorganization of patterns of settlement became a 
necessity almost from the beginning, but particularly so during the 
depression years of the 1930®s. Tillers of sub-marginal lands were 
forced into bankruptcy. Eventually resettlement, with government assist¬ 
ance, became necessary. The reorganization of the pattern of farm hold¬ 
ings is still going on. The problem of supplying educational facilities 
for a scattered rural population has thus been complicated by a continual 
shifting of the pattern of settlement. 

Separate provisions for the incorporation of small settlements 
gave to each town and village its own structure of local government. 

These places, although having many rural characteristics, operated as 
independent units within the rural setting. The administrative pro¬ 
visions, while keeping local government close to the people, created

difficulties for succeeding generations of Albertans in the develop¬ 
ment of local government services. Particularly has this been true of 
education. 

The erection of small school districts as H separate units”, divor¬ 
ced entirely from other local government functions, placed education 
in a unique position and kept administrative control localized. These 
units very early, however, proved inadequate to do an efficient job of 
providing effective schooling for .Alberta*s youth. The ineffectiveness 
of the small local school district, was further aggravated by the 
imposition of separate schools. The virtues of the system are not under 
scrutiny here; however, the administrative difficulties which very early 
became apparent are still present. 

The problem of too few people plagued early municipal develop¬ 
ment: the problem of too few pupils placed educational development in 
a similar **strait-jacket.” The enlargement of school districts accent¬ 
uated the problem of distance; contraction of boundaries accentuated 
the sparsity factor. Conveyance, when it became acceptable to parents, 
provided a partial solution to the problem of obtaining an effective 
school enrolment; but, it was costly, as it involved not only the 
physical movement of children for considerable distances, but a reorgan¬ 
ization of school plants and equipment. Furthermore, reorganization 
could not function effectively within the restrictive administrative 
framework of the small school district. 

The organization of school divisions provided a large operat¬ 
ional framework. However, reorganization was costly. Local responsi¬ 
bility (including financial responsibility) for local services had a

restrictive influence upon educational development. The land tax had 
traditionally been the major source of revenue for all local services 
in rural Alberta. In the day when land constituted the chief form 
of wealth, it was a reasonable gauge of ability to pay; furthermore, 
the land tax was easily administered and collected. But it could not 
be hidden: it has been direct and painful. From the first, the problem 
was a matter of willingness to pay as well as of ability to pay; the 
same problem still exists. 

Federal, and later, provincial assistance in the form of edu¬ 
cation grants gave some relief to the local burden of taxation. As 
costs increased, these grants increased accordingly. Substantial 
increases in grants and their manipulation in such a way as to achieve 
preconceived goals have done much to improve both the quality and the 
quantity of education provided in rural Alberta; but, at the same time, 
the relationship between the parent government and its “creatures” has 
become much more complex. 

This “heritage from the past 11 has provided the reasons for recent 
major innovations in the administration of education in rural Alberta— 
consolidations, rural high school areas, and school divisions constituted 
an attack upon a problem which originated with the creation of large 
numbers of small school districts; inclusion agreements were devised 
to overcome the disadvantage resulting from the independent operation 
of many small town and village school districts; the periodic enlarge¬ 
ment of municipal districts has come as a result of inadequacies in 
the size of the initial structure; and, the Alberta County was conceived

CHAPTER III 


DEMOGRAPHIC TRENDS IN RURAL ALBERTA 


Problem 

The major question treated in this chapter is: ¥hat have been 
the demographic changes of import to education in rural Alberta 
during the past twenty-five years? 

Sub-Problems 

This involved an examination of trends in the following sub¬ 
problem areas: 

1 * the changes in the rural population in relation to the 
total population of Alberta; 

2 * the numerical growth and distribution of the population 
of Alberta included in rural school units; 

3 * the distribution of the rural population among the several 
types of school units; 

4 * the geographical (north-south) distribution of the rural 
population of Alberta; 

5. the distribution of the school population of Alberta by 
types of school units and by years of schooling; 

6 . the potential increase in the rural school population; 

7. the nature and extent of population movement away from 
the farm; 

8 . the labour force of Alberta in relation to educational load

I. GENERAL POPULATION TRENDS 


Total Population 

Tha population of Alberta has increased substantially during 
all periods of her history as a province, except during the depres¬ 
sion years of the 1930*s. The slow growth during that period was 
due to a drop in the rate of natural increase and to out-migration. 
After World War II a rising rate of natural increase, together with 
the in-migration which accompanied Alberta*s economic revolution, 
caused a very rapid increase in population. Table I provides details. 

By 1931 the population of Alberta had reached 731? 600. During 
the next fifteen years the average annual gain was approximately 
5,000 persons. This boosted the total population to slightly over 
800,000 in 194&. However, during the next decade the population 
increased by more than 50 per cent, and the indications are that this 
growth has been even more rapid since 1956.^ The distribution of the 
remarkable increase has had a vital bearing upon the extent and the 
distribution of educational services and facilities, with conseo x uent 
effects upon educational finance both at the local and provincial 
level. 

Rural Population 

Numerically the population of rural Alberta changed but little

during the past quarter-century. It numbered slightly over 453,000 
in 1931? hut less than 444?000 in 1956—not a significant change. 
However, its relative size changed markedly: in 1931 it represented 
61.9 per cent of the population of the province, but only 39.6 per 
cent in 1956, as shown in Table II. The proportion of rural to 
urban population was practically reversed in the short space of 
twenty-five years. This analysis affords a crude measure of the 
total rural to urban movement of population. Estimates of future 
population growth in Alberta, although showing considerable vari¬ 
ation, all indicate a moderate decrease in the rural population and 

a very rapid increase in the urban population, particularly in the 

2 

cities of Edmonton and Calgary,, 

An examination of population density would have contributed 
very little to the problem at hand. Such data could actually be 
misleading in a province such as Alberta where large areas have vir¬ 
tually no population. Even among units with similar densities of pop¬ 
ulation, indices could mean a rather uniform scatter of population 
in one unit, and a concentrated population in one or more locations 
in another unit. A consideration of such items as conveyance needs, 
school facilities, and the other general problems involved in get¬ 
ting together a sufficiently large group of pupils for an effective 
school unit required a measure other than the density factor. 

A rather crude measure of population 11 scatter” was afforded 
by an analysis of rural farm and rural non-farm population trends.

Since all persons living on farms, regardless of their occupational 
status, have in past censuses been classified as rural farm popu¬ 
lation, any increases in the rural non-farm population were inter¬ 
preted as a further concentration of rural population in hamlets, 
some of them unincorporated places of considerable size. Table I 
records the farm to rural non-farm movement of the population. In 
1931 the farm population of Alberta was over three times the rural 
non-farm population, while by 1956 the farm population was only 
slightly more than double the non-farm population. This analysis 
indicated an increasing degree of concentration of rural population 
(30,000 additional persons) in unincorporated non-farm centres. 

Since one means of attacking the problem of rural education 
in Alberta has been the provision for the inclusion of incorporated 
towns and villages in large rural units for educational purposes, an 
examination of the rural population trends did not tell the whole 
story. An analysis of the total population served in various types 
of administrative units was much more significant. 

Population of Rural School Units 

Prior to 1936, there was little interaction among rural and 
urban units in the solution of educational problems. However, the 
admission of towns and villages to school divisions through the 
avenue of "inclusion agreements" brought about a growing degree of 
joint efforts. An examination of population changes resulting from 
inclusion agreements, as well as of the places involved, provided a

measure of the extent of the movement. 

The data in Table III indicate that in 1931 the population of 
towns and of villages contained in rural administrative units num¬ 
bered 2,300 and 33>600, respectively* No great change occurred until 
the 1940*s. Between 1941 and 1946 the population of town centres 
included in school divisions increased to almost 30,000, while by 
1956 it had reached 81,200, considerably more than one-half the 
total town population of Alberta* Meanwhile, the village population 
contained in rural units reached almost 50,000 by 1956 to represent 
practically the entire village population of the province* Thus 
the rural population was increased by more than 130,000 for school 
purposes. This did much toward neutralizing the problem of pop¬ 
ulation scatter in rural Alberta, and made possible a concentrated 
approach to educational problems by local authorities* It also implied 
acceptance of the fact that the educational needs of young people 
were quite common regardless of the place of residence. Urban centres 
rapidly became the educational centres of many rural areas* 

The tt pooling of population 1 * was a boon to the organization of 
more effective educational facilities and services in rural Alberta* 

The extent of further possibilities along similar lines were given 
some attention* Table IV indicates the progress in the development 
of inclusion agreements and the number of village and town units 
operating independently in 1956. In 1931 there were 3,409 rural 
and village school districts operating independently in Alberta,

51 town districts, 64 consolidated districts, and 11 ‘’separate* school 
districts: in 1956 there were only 21 towns, 4 villages, 27 rural 
school districts, 11 consolidated school districts, and 45 “separate” 
school districts operating independently* 

Of the 22 towns operating as independent school districts, 
several such as Beverly and Jasper Place (population 22,000) appear 
to be destined for amalgamation with city units. The analysis indi¬ 
cated a total town population of not more than 35>000 that could be 
considered as potential divisional or county population for school 
purposes* In 1956 only 4 villages were operating as independent school 
districts and represented an insignificant factor in relation to 
inclusion agreements. Less than 20 “separate 11 school districts were 
located outside non-divisional cities and towns; the 27 rural school 
districts that were in existence in 1956 were mostly located outside 
areas that could conveniently be included in divisional units; and, 
the 11 consolidated school districts represented a total population 
of about 10,000. The analysis indicated that there was in Alberta 
in 1956 a population of less than 50,000 that might conceivably be 
included in larger school units in the future. Population growth 
from year to year, particularly in the independent town units, 
would somewhat increase the potential total, but, even with due 
allowances for this increase, it is quite apparent that additions 
to the population of divisions and counties through inclusion agree¬ 
ments are no longer a major consideration.

Population Shifts by Census Divisions 

As might be expected, the rural to urban population shift has 
not been uniform throughout Alberta. From the standpoint of assessing 
educational need according to areas, some attention was given the 
distribution of the rural population by census divisions. As indicated 
in Table V, the rural population of Southern Alberta decreased slowly 
from 178,800 in 1931 to 156,600 in 1956—a total decrease of 22,000 
during the period. On the other hand, the rural population of 
Northern Alberta increased steadily from 274*300 in 1931 to 320,700 
in 1941 and then decreased to 287,100 by 1956'—a net gain of 13,000 
during the quarter century. 

In Southern Alberta the only census division to gain in 
rural population was number six, which includes the city of Calgary, 
and here the gain was only 6,000 persons. All other six divisions 
lost by varying degrees, ranging from 200 in division number two to 
almost 12,000 in number five. The latter division lost more than 
50 per cent of its rural population during the twenty-five year 
period from 1931 to 1956. 

In Northern Alberta six of the ten census divisions gained 
in population, the greatest gain being in division number eleven 
which contains the city of Edmonton (6,000 for the period). Four 
of the five most northerly divisions made substantial gains in rural 
population during the period. 

It is of significance to note that, while Southern Alberta

suffered a steady decline in rural population throughout the period, 
the trend in Northern Alberta was quite different. During the 
1931-1941 decade the northern divisions, with one exception, made 
considerable gains in rural population. Between 1946 and 1951 
seven southern divisions lost slightly, while two others made gains 
of less than 200 persons. However, between 1951 and 1956 five of the 
northern divisions made considerable gains, and two others lost by 
less than 800 persons. 

II. SCHOOL POPULATION TRENDS 

It has been observed that there has been, since 1936, an amal¬ 
gamation of many town, village, and rural units for school purposes. 

As a result there is now no clearly defined rural school population 
in Alberta. In this study all elements of the school population out¬ 
side independent town and city school districts has been included in 
the rural classification. 

Distribution of the School Population 

An examination of data as summarized in Table VI reveals the 
changes that have taken place in the organizational pattern of edu¬ 
cational services during the past twenty-five years. In 1931 more 
than 100,000 pupils were attending small independent rural and vil¬ 
lage schools. Except for a small increase in school population little 
change had taken place by 1936. However, following the provisions for 
larger units of school administration, a decided change took place,

and by 1941 almost 80,000 pupils were included within the organi¬ 
zational pattern of school divisions* Independent village school 
population dropped from 23,000 in 1931 to less than 15,000 in 1941, 
while the number of pupils attending consolidated schools dropped to 
less than 6,000* Fifteen years later (1956) the school population 
of divisions and counties numbered over 111,000, while village and 
consolidated school populations were reduced to 1,300 and 2,000, 
respectively* In the meantime, the population of small rural school 
districts almost doubled between 1951 and 1956 to reach 5,800 in the 
latter year* This resulted from the formation of new school districts 
in areas remote from organized divisions and counties* This segment 
of the rural school population was not considered as potential divis¬ 
ional population in the immediate future* It constitutes a special 
problem in rural education in Alberta. 

Potential Increase in the Rural School Population 

The 1,100 children attending school in Roman Catholic separate 
schools outside independent urban school districts in 1956 were not 
considered to be potential additions to the divisional school popu¬ 
lation of Alberta. However, the 3,500 pupils in village schools and 
in consolidated schools, along with some 10,000 in independent town 
districts were considered as potential additions to larger units. It 
was concluded that the school population will be augmented somewhat 
in the immediate future through the avenue of inclusion agreements, 
but that the additions will be of far less significance than in the

past* Any major increases must come from the natural increase in the 
various segments of the population now included in divisions and 
counties* 

Relative Growth of the Rural School Population 

Some indication of the nature of the changes that have taken 
place in the rural school population of Alberta was arrived at through 
a comparison of increases in the total population contained in larger 
units with the number of school children included therein. Table VII 
records the trends that have taken place over the past quarter-century 
and indicates the educational load in terms of the total population. 

The period from 1931 to 1936 was characterized by unemployment 
and a movement back to the farm of a considerable segment of the 
urban population. This had but little effect upon the school popu¬ 
lation, as attendance dropped off sharply during the period of lean 
years when the birthrate was down, and out-migration exceeded in- 
migration in Alberta. The 1936-1941 period was characterized by 
similar trends. 

With the formation of school divisions, and the inclusion 
therein of numbers of urban people, considerable changes took place. 

In the decade between 1946 and 1956 the rural population increased 
by 60,000 and the school population by 22,000. This constituted a 
large increase in the number of school children relative to the 
increase in the total population. The trend from 1951 to 1956 was 
even more significant, since the total increase in the population

was only 7,000 greater than the increase in the school population* 
This can be explained in part by a sharp increase in the birthrate 
following World War II, and by more pupils staying on in school for 
longer periods of time, but a part of the increase must be attributed 
to the movement cityward of large numbers of post-school-age persons. 

Rural and Urban School Population 

Data were available only for the year 1951 for rural and urban 
school-age groups according to years of schooling. This provides the 
only readily available means of comparing the distribution of pupils 
according to age groups and of assessing retention in school of rural 
and urban pupils. 

In 1951 almost 30 per cent of the rural population of Alberta 
was of school age (5-19 years), while less than 22 per cent of the 
urban population fell in this category. Almost 21 per cent of the 
rural population was actually in school; the corresponding proportion 
for the urban population was 15 per cent (Table VIII). Thus the 
educational load, in relation to the total population, was almost 
half as great again in rural as in urban Alberta. 

Slightly over 45 per cent of the rural and 44 per cent of the 
urban school population had one to four years of schooling. The 
number with five to eight years of schooling comprised 37.6 per cent 
of the rural school population but only 32 per cent of the urban. 

The proportion was quite the reverse for pupils with nine to twelve 
years of schooling, being only 17 per cent for rural and 24 per cent

for urban pupils* This affords a rough measure of retention in school. 
If it can be assumed that retardation and acceleration tend to balance 
out, the group with nine to twelve years of schooling represents a 
group equivalent in number to the Grade IX to XII group in Alberta. 

Thus in 1951 while the educational load was in the ratio of three to 
two between rural and urban Alberta, the ratio was reversed (2 to 3) 
for high school pupils* 

III. TRENDS IN THE RURAL LABOUR FORCE 

In the past, there has been a general tendency for the proportion 
of a country*s labour force engaged in agriculture to fall as living 
standards for the group have moved upward.-^ The tendency is reflected 
in the fact that a much larger proportion of the working population 
is currently engaged in agriculture in the under-developed and low 
income countries of the world than in the higher income countries. 
Conversely, the proportion of the population occupied in agriculture 
in the countries of the western world has tended to decline for gen¬ 
erations* This relationship seems to be an essential part of the pro¬ 
gress of economic growth.^ The reasons for this development are now 
generally understood* One major factor in the situation is the low 
income elasticity for farm products. A large part of farm output is 
used as food, and food consumption does not increase in step with total 
real income. Food consumption per capita is little different now 
than it was two decades ago, although per capita real incomes have

increased greatly. Thus, as improved technology occurs in the econ¬ 
omy, the prevailing pattern of consumer tastes causes a relative 
decline in the proportion of labour and capital absorbed in agri¬ 
culture. This has caused a movement of -workers out of agricultural 
5 

pursuits. 

The whole problem of providing educational opportunity in 
rural areas has been somewhat complicated by those persons who deplore 
the exodus of young people from the country. This fear of Educating 
away from the farm” has been reflected in the efforts of local edu¬ 
cation authorities to magnify the distinction between the needs of 
rural education and education in general far beyond the degree to 
which it exists today. Yet the fears of those concerned are quite 
understandable. Labour migration from rural to urban areas or from 
agricultural to other pursuits has been one of the most marked changes 
involved in the industrialization of Alberta. Before analyzing the 
numerical changes that have taken place in the farm labour force, 
some treatment has been given to the general nature and effects of 
the trend 11 away from the farm”. 

The Rural Surplus Population 

Birthrates have always been higher in rural than in urban 
areas. Without a rural-to-urban flow of population, towns and cities 
would rapidly decline relative to the total population and larger 
numbers of farm youth would annually be thrown into the farm labour 
force. This would mean a great reduction in the productivity for

each hour spent in farm labour, because of the working of the law of 
supply and demand, but a large increase in the food and fibre produced. 
Resultant reductions in the market prices of food products in relation 
to other commodities would further depress the agricultural economy. 

Mechanization has recently caused a marked contraction in the 
number of workers that can be absorbed in agriculture. Ordinarily as 
machines are introduced, prices of commodities are reduced, the demand 
for such commodities increases, and an additional number of hands is 
employed to supply the increased demand. However, if the demand for 
a commodity or commodities is inelastic, a reduction in price is not 
followed by a relative increase in the quantity demanded. This has 
been the case with regard to agricultural products. Rapidly expanding 
markets could not be located to keep pace with farm mechanization? the 
only alternative was a reduction in the farm labour force. This was 
consistent with the increased individual potential for production 
created by machines. 

On the other hand, except in periods of severe recession, the 
very life of urban industries has depended upon an adequate supply 
of labour. Alberta 1 s rapid economic development, particularly during 
the past decade, has required a growing army of workers, many of whom 
have been supplied by rural communities. This situation suggests the 
need for a kind of balance between the “push 11 of labour force personnel 
from the farm and the corresponding n pull t5 toward the city.

The Push and Pull Exerted on the Farm Labour Force 

Black indicated that the excess labour force, in the past, 
has been drawn to the eity by a process which involved two patterns 
of reaction to which he attached the terms “push* 1 and a pull lt ®^ 

During normal years a considerable number of young people has been 
drawn from rural communities in Alberta to urban centres by the 
magnetic attraction of higher income, better living conditions, and 
more variety in social life. The pull has been stronger in good 
times than in bad* In periods of depression it has disappeared 
altogether. In the past the push has operated when numbers of workers 
were no longer able to make a satisfactory living on the farm* The 
push was accelerated when machines became more effective in their 
man-hour savings of labour* 

The two forces—push and pull—have always been present, but 
it is not easy to evaluate the effects of each. But the results of 
imbalance have been readily apparent in periods of depression and of 
rapid expansion. In the former instance, the farm labour force has 
been too large for ready absorption in profitable pursuits, and in 
the latter, the result has been an actual shortage in the farm labour 
force* 

This movement of workers from farm to city has constituted a 
shifting of a factor of production (labour) from one area of product¬ 
ion to another. The degree of movement has depended upon the dif¬ 
ference in the value of labour in the two markets in the light of the

quantity that can be absorbed. In the past, the transfer has been 
motivated by a higher wage in urban than in rural areas. The fact 
that the difference in real wage may be slight, owing to higher 
costs of living in the city, has been a far less important consider¬ 
ation than money wage* 

There have been non-economic factors in operation as well, 
involving educational and other opportunities. The combination of 
economic and other factors has ruled that the young people from 
farm homes have constituted a major proportion of the labour force 
moving to urban centres. 

The Labour Force and Educational Load 

An examination of trends in rural school population in relation 
to the labour force was considered in some detail in an effort to est¬ 
ablish the general pattern of development. Since data were not 
available over a period of time on a general division of the labour 
force of Alberta according to rural and urban workers, it was not 
possible to establish a trend in the rural educational load in terms 
of the rural labour force. Because of this, there was some signif¬ 
icance attached to an examination of such data for the whole of the 
province. Table U indicates that in 1931 the proportion of the 
school population to the labour force was 58.9 P er cent. This high 
proportion resulted from the high birth rate in what was then a pre¬ 
dominantly rural province and from the fact that very few women were 


other than housewives

a Per cent school population of labour force. 
















88 


The proportion of school population to the labour force dropped 
annually until by 1951 it had reached 49 per cent. This meant that 
there were about two wage earners for every child in school. However, 
between 1951 and 1956 the labour force increased by only 42,700, while 
the school population expanded by 50,000, to shift the proportion to 
56.2 per cent by 1956. This was approaching very closely the 1931 
ratio and indicated a substantial increase in the educational load. 

The Potential Educational Load 

Table X was designed to emphasize the change that has taken 
place in the relationship between the actual pupils in school and the 
number of children in the five to nineteen age group—potential school 
enrolment—in Alberta. The change in the ratio was used as an indi¬ 
cator of pupil retention. The last column of Table X shows for the 
past twenty-five years, the proportions of school age children who 
were pupils. Almost 76 per cent of the school age population was in 
attendance in school in 1956 as compared with slightly under 72 per 
cent in 1931* Considering the high premium being placed upon edu¬ 
cation by employers, and the growing demand for skills and semi-skills, 
the trend may be even more pronounced in the future. 

The educational load in relation to the labour force is thus 
being increased by the interaction of two rather pronounced trends: a 
rapid increase in the number of children that are coming of school 
age annually; and, a significant upward trend in the proportion of 
children (5-19 years of age) in school. As the labour force has not

kept pace with the increase in school enrolment, it follows that 
relatively fewer people must pay for a growing 11 quantity of education.” 

Educational Load and Farm Labour Force 

The ratio of school age children in the farm population of 
Alberta in relation to the farm labour force has always been high# 

This has resulted from, the high birth rate in rural areas and the 
limited employment opportunities for women workers*. The ratio has 
been forced further upward by a movement of rural young people of 
school age to urban centres* 

Table XI records the decline that has taken place in the farm 
labour force since 1931. Only during the 1931-36 period,when depres¬ 
sion conditions caused a movement back to the farm, was there an actual 
increase* The decline of 42,700-from 145,BOO in 1931 to 103,000 in 
1956—represented a loss of almost 30 per cent* Potential school 
population likewise declined during the period 1931-1946, but at a 
slower rate; after 1946 there was a slow increase. The actual loss 
for the period, however, was slightly less than 10 per cent, only 
one-third of the labour force loss* 

The last column of Table XI records the proportional change 
of the potential school population in relation to the labour force® 

This data indicate that between 1931 and 1956 the proportion had 
increased by more than 20 per cent to come within two percentage 
points of equalling the 1956 farm labour force. The information pre¬ 
sented in Table XI does not Include the non-farm labour force or that

of towns and villages included in rural school units* The data give 
a partial picture of the increase in educational load, since they also 
exclude the school population of these centres* Expressed in terms of 
the farm labour force, the potential educational load in rural Alberta 
has increased considerably since 1931* 

The Labour Force and Educational Load , Rural and Urban , 1951 

Detailed data were assembled in census reports for 1951 relating 
to the labour force and school population, rural farm, rural non-farm, 
and urban* Since supporting data were not available for any other 
census years, it was not possible to establish a pattern of trends; 
however, the analysis of data as provided in Table XII discloses some 
significant features of the rural-urban pattern in 1951* 

The rural labour force which comprised only 34*8 per cent of 
the rural population was well below the 40.1 per cent for urban cen¬ 
tres or the 37*7 per cent for Alberta as a whole* On the other hand, 
the farm school population constituted a larger proportion of the 
total farm population than was the case in any other segment of the 
population (22 per cent)* This was half as high again as the urban 
proportion of 15 per cent, and appreciably greater than the IB.7 per 
cent recorded for the rural non-farm school population. 

Turning now to the proportion of school age children to the 
labour force, it is of significance to note that in 1951 the farm 
school population was approaching 90 per cent of the farm labour 
force, while the proportion for Alberta was less than 70 per cent.

and that for urban centres only 53 per cent. On the basis of the 
labour force in each segment of the population, the educational load 
was, in 1951, almost 33 per cent greater in rural than in urban 
Alberta. The difference between rural farm and urban educational loads 
was even greater. This interpretation of educational load makes no 
distinction between differences in educational costs per pupil or 
differences in ability to support education that exist throughout 
Alberta. The analysis of per pupil costs and net incomes which are 
made later in the investigation somewhat refine this crude measure of 
educational load. 

School Age Groups and the Labour Force 

The comparison of rural and urban educational load as a pro¬ 
portion of the labour force gave no treatment of the potential school 
population. Equality of educational opportunity was achieved to a 
growing degree as the organization of school facilities and improved 
educational fare retained in school larger numbers of rural pupils for 
longer periods of time. Without doubt the ’’gap in opportunity” between 
rural and urban Alberta has closed somewhat since 1931, but the data 
provided in the fourth column of Table XII, suggest that significant 
differences still existed as late as 1951. In urban Alberta 31.2 per 
cent of the school population was in that year (1953) 14 years of age 
and over, while 28.4 per cent of the farm and 27.0 per cent of the rural 
non-farm school population fell in that category. This indicates a con¬ 
siderably higher ”drop-out” for rural than for urban Alberta. Keeping 










95 


in mind the fact that considerable numbers of rural pupils over 16 
years of age had discontinued school to join the urban labour force, 
thus decreasing the proportion of urban children between 14 and 19 
years of age in school attendance, it is obvious that the actual 
“gap 11 was much wider than the above analysis indicates* A further 
consideration of data was made in order to assess the general trend. 

Urban Movement of Rural School-Age Population 

While a part of the decrease in the rural population of Alberta 
resulted from migration from the province, by far the major portion of 
the decrease resulted from rural to urban migration within Alberta 0 
Table XI provides a picture of the general movement of labour force 
personnel away from the farm during the 1931-56 period. A reversal of 
the trend took place between 1931 and 1936, but thereafter a progres¬ 
sively rapid movement took place, particularly during the 1946-56 
decade. Table XIII Illustrates in some detail the urban shift of the 
rural population of school age during the past decade (1946-56)• 

After allowing for the limitations of this rough calculation, 
it is apparent that Alberta*s rural population under twenty-four 
years of age has declined steadily, particularly in respect of young 
people of labour force age. Following one age group through the 
1946-56 decade, it is evident that those in the 10-14 age group in 
1946 had declined by 11,000 in 1956 (the 20-24 age group in that year). 
During the same period the corresponding urban group more than doubled 
(23,400 in 1946 and 52,100 in 1956).

Since, by definition (1951 census definition) the rural pop¬ 
ulation included all population outside centres of 1,000 or more people, 
it is apparent that all of the village population and much of the town 
population was, in the above analysis, included in the rural age groups. 
Considering the fact that villages and towns gained appreciably in 
population between 1946 and 1956, the movement of young people of 
labour force age away from the farm was even greater than that indi¬ 
cated in Table XIII, While a number of those in the 15-19 age group 
undoubtedly continued their education after moving to an urban cen¬ 
tre, indications are that the great majority joined the urban labour 
force. This conclusion is buttressed by the observation that the urban 
movement was much greater in the older school-age-group than was the 
case for the group under fourteen years of age. This indicates a 
considerable movement of individuals in addition to ’’family moves,” 

In comparatively few instances would individuals be enrolled in urban 
public schools; however, a considerable number would have pursued some 
form of post-school training before joining the urban labour force. 

IV. EDUCATIONAL SIGNIFICANCE 

The demographic trends developed in this chapter present, col¬ 
lectively, a picture of significant forces impinging upon rural education. 
The characteristics assumed by rural education, during the period 
1931-1956, were distinctly related to one major factor—the scatter 
of rural population. Underlying the organizational changes were certain 
dynamics of rural population. 






98 


While major growth took place in the total population of Alberta 
during the period, particularly during the 1946-1956 decade (Table l), 
the rural population decreased,. The farm population declined also 
in relation to the rural non-farm population. While the rural farm 
population was declining, both numerically and as a segment of the total 
population, the improved acreage of occupied farms was increasing 
(Chapter IV, Table XXIII). Thus the entire period (1931-1956) was 
characterized by an accentuation of population scatter. 

Rural education responded to these forces and took on new char¬ 
acteristics. Small school districts were grouped to form school divis¬ 
ions which were administered from central offices® This made possible 
a concerted program of centralisation of school facilities. Large 
attendance areas necessitated the re-location of school facilities. 

This involved major building programs. Provisions for the inclusion 
of towns and villages in school divisions led to a considerable increase 
in divisional school population during the 1936-1956 period (Table III)*. 

Geographically the decline in rural population has not been 
uniform. Southern Alberta lost heavily during the period, while the 
northern areas experienced a substantial increase (Table V). In 
Southern Alberta it became increasingly difficult to organize attendance 
areas with an effective school population; conveyance routes were exten¬ 
ded as wider areas were included in centralizations. The increasing 
rural population in Northern Alberta created a need for larger quantities 
of school facilities. This was in addition to the need for the relocation■ 
of facilities as centralization progressed. In Northern Alberta

unimproved roads and weather conditions added to the complexity of 
conveyance and attendance problems* 

At the same time certain distinct changes took place in the com¬ 
position of the rural population* Between 1931 and 1946 there was a 
continual decrease in the ratio of the school population to the total 
population (Table VII), while during the 1946-1956 decade the ratio 
moved steadily upward. Until the year 1946, the sharp decline in the 
farm labour force was accompanied by a decline in the potential school 
population (5-19 years of age) but thereafter the trend was upward 
(Table Xl). By 1956 the potential school population almost equalled 
the entire farm labour force* The upward trend in the ratio resulted 
from the increased birthrate that accompanied World War II and the 
movement of young workers to urban employment* This caused a substan¬ 
tial increase in the potential educational load in terms of the labour 
force* 

Further conclusions may be drawn from an examination of the sim¬ 
ultaneous but opposite trends in rural and urban labour forces respect¬ 
ively* Throughout the period there was a substantial migration of 
rural youth to urban areas, particularly among young wage-earners 
(Table XIII). This movement is reflected in the higher proportion of 
rural children of school age (5-19 years) actually in school in 1951 
(Table VTII); however, the proportion of rural school children (actually 
in school) with 9 to 12 years of schooling was substantially less in 
rural areas (Table VIII). This implies a lower level of education for 
rural youths* 




100 

If the products of the whole school system are to be inter¬ 
changeable, in line with the rural-urban movement, the implications 
are—more and better education for larger numbers of rural young 
people* The fear of "educating away from the farm" is apparent rather 
than real* Farmers have not been able to absorb the "surplus" rural 
population, which has been forced to migrate* A proper balance between 
the pull of young people to the city and the push away from the farm 
depends upon the development of a more satisfying social and a more 
adequate economic life for rural workers* More and better educational 
services will contribute to the better use of abilities and skills for 
all rural young people, regardless of where they are employed* Many 
workers who received their basic education in rural communities will 
transfer their wage earning ability elsewhere. This is an important 
point* Equally important is the fact that those who have made the 
greatest contribution to industrial and social life in the city are 
those who have progressed farthest in school, because of the wider var¬ 
iety of work opportunities open to them; their contribution to the 
labour factor of production has been far greater than for less well 
qualified workers. The problem of rural education then is no longer 
a local one, since the quality of training received affects to no 
small degree the future progress of the province and of Canada. 

The demographic trends in rural Alberta supports two conclu¬ 
sions, namely; population scatter in rural areas will continue to 
create problems in education; and, the significance of these problems 
goes much beyond rural areas, since an increasingly large number of 


no:

rural young people migrate to urban centres* 

It is no longer realistic to retain the rural-urban distinction 
within our society, particularly with regard to education. The early 
recognition of a degree of interdependence as between the strictly rural 
(farm) and the near-rural (town and village), shown by their cooperation 
in the administration of school affairs was, perhaps, born of their 
respective ph 2 'sical limitations (sparsity of pupils). However, the 
potential of providing better school opportunities purely through inclu¬ 
sions and combining the pupil populations of schools is largely exhausted 
(Tables IV and Vl)$ at best, the remaining potential is inadequate to 
the needs of rural education.

CHAPTER IV 


FARM CHANGES AND EDUCATIONAL NEED 

Problem 

The major question treated in this chapter is: What changes 
in the organizational pattern of farming during the past twenty- 
five years have been significant to education? 

Sub-Problems 

This involved an examination of trends in the following sub¬ 
problem areas: 

1 . the developmental pattern of farm holdings in Alberta; 

2. the geographical distribution of farm holdings; 

3* the mechanization of agriculture; 

4. the number and size of farms; 

5. farm ownership and farm tenure; 

6 0 the residence pattern of farm families; 

7o the age of farm operators; 

8. farm mechanization and land usage. 

I. THE PATTERN OF AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT IN ALBERTA 

Although farming began in what is now the province of Alberta 
as early as 1779 when North-West Fur Trading Company officials plan¬ 
ted "kitchen gardens", extensive development had to await the coming 
of the railway.**- Distant markets could mean little until an avenue

for reaching them was made available to prairie farmers. 

The Railway and Land Settlement 

Railway lines established the general pattern of early settle¬ 
ment in Alberta, with the most densely settled communities growing up 
in the more fertile areas that were adjacent to rail facilities* The 
Canadian Pacific Railway was built through Alberta in 1883, and in the 
same year a branch line was built from Medicine Hat to Lethbridge* In 
1891 the Calgary to Edmonton line was opened, while in 1905 the Can¬ 
adian National inter-provincial line joined Edmonton and Lloydminster, 
and branch lines were built eastward from Lacombe and ¥etaskiwin. 

Many of the early homesteaders located in a narrow strip of 
territory between Calgary and Edmonton, usually on quarter-section 
plots. They produced oats and hay, as well as cattle and cattle pro¬ 
ducts. However, the development of substantial markets was a slow 

process, and there was much “coming and going 51 of homesteaders during 
2 

the early nineties. 

Morld economic conditions at the turn of the twentieth cen¬ 
tury favored more extensive agricultural developments in Alberta by 
assuring ready markets for farm products. Between 1900 and 1906 the 
number of farmers in Alberta increased from 9,433 to 30,286 ; the 
cattle population numbered almost a million head in the latter year; 

3 

and, over 900,000 acres were seeded to field crops. 

The introduction of Marquis wheat in 1910 resulted in a remar¬ 
kable expansion in wheat production, particularly in the more arid 
regions of Southern Alberta. The population, number of farms, and

improved acreage all doubled between 1906 and 1916, However, there 
was a darker side to the agricultural “boom 11 , since the volume of 
production increased more rapidly than markets became available. 
Abundant crops were net an accurate gauge of the financial status of 
agriculture. The ll ups and downs 11 of the farm economy left their 
imprints upon the development of essential local services in rural 
Alberta even in the pioneer days. 

World War I, accompanied as it was by a demand for agricul¬ 
tural products, brought unprecedented prosperity to Alberta farmers* 
The area under field crops increased from 5>500,000 acres in 1916 to 
8,500,000 acres in 1921. However, even during this period of ade¬ 
quate markets and high prices, dry years, small crops, early frosts 
and other climatic disturbances, tended to place many farmers in 
financial difficulties. In addition, an economic recession which 
began in 1920, together with an increase in tariffs by the United 
States on Canadian, cattle and cattle products, further jeopardized 
the farm economy of Alberta,^ 

Power Equipment and Land Use 

By 1926 good crop years and buoyant world markets for agri¬ 
cultural products set the stage for further expansions in farming 
operations. This expansion was facilitated by the introduction of 
motor vehicles and improved farm tractors which made possible more 
extensive farm operations in vast areas of fertile farm land not 
readily accessible to existing railway services. The number of 







farms doubled between 1926 and 1931> while the area of improved farm 
land reached 17,700,000 acres in the latter year.^ 

Economic depression in the early 1930*s brought a sudden halt 
to farm expansion in Alberta,, Many farmers who occupied sub-marginal 
lands became financially insolvent and special government assistance 
became necessary# Farmers who were located in average or above aver¬ 
age areas were able to survive financially,, It was during the ”hungry 
thirties” that the adjustment of agriculture to Alberta*s physical 
and climatic environment was commenced. 

Government assistance, both at the provincial and municipal 
level, had been at first temporary in nature: it consisted of the 
supplying of seed and feed or of direct financial relief# However, 
in some areas, particularly in the dry south, the problem was not 
a temporary one. Eventually, resettlement with government assist¬ 
ance was resorted to, and special areas were set up in which further 
settlement was restricted. In later years irrigation projects were 
to aid farmers in Southern Alberta in their struggle against the loss 
of crops by drought.^ 

The late 1930*s saw a gradual improvement in agriculture in 
Alberta, which was followed during the course of World War II by the 
”boom” conditions that usually accompany war. Further mechanization 
which led to increases in farm size and decreases in the farm labour 
force created problems from within, while the industrialization of 
Alberta affected farming from without. 




107 


II. AGRICULTURE AND CHANGE 

During the period from 1931 to 1956 the concept of farming 
changed from ll a way of life 11 to “farming as a business.* 1 The reor¬ 
ganization of farms, in size and in numbers, upset the status quo 
of the small rural community with its subsistence farmers and local 
services, thus creating new problems and new demands. The prime 
mover in this change was the shift from horses to gasoline engines 
and electric power as sources of energy on Alberta farms. 

The Mechanization of Agriculture 

There has always been a wide diversity of opinion as to whet¬ 
her a shortage of labour on farms induced mechanization, or whether 
farm mechanization pushed labourers out of agriculture. Doubtless 
the shortage of labour during two world wars speeded up mechan¬ 
ization, but even before World War I, and in the interval between 
the two wars, the process continued, as evidenced by sizeable reduc¬ 
tions both in the number of farm labourers and farm operators. 
Regardless of the reasons, the mechanization of agriculture has 
proceeded apace in Alberta, as it has throughout the Great Plains 
region of Canada and the United States; and the end is not yet in 
view. 

T rends in Farm Machines 

The degree of mechanization that has taken place on Alberta’s 
farms is evident from the growth in the number of power machines.

Table XIV supplies a summary of the change in the numbers of selected 
farm machines found on Alberta f s farms during the period 1931-1956. 

The difficult financial circumstances in which farmers found themselves 
during the depression years of the 1930*s were reflected in the restricted 
advance in farm mechanization during those years. Some progress was 
made between 1936 and 1941* but wartime conditions seriously restricted 
the availability of farm machinery after 1939. However, with the ces¬ 
sation of hostilities, a return to normal production, combined with a 
buoyant economy, caused farm mechanization in Alberta to increase 
rapidly. Tractors on farms increased in number by over 60 per cent 
during the 1946-1951 period, while motor trucks and grain combines more 
than doubled during the same five year period. Although there was a 
levelling off during the 1951-1956 period, the increases were substantial. 
In the latter year, there were, on the average, almost three items of 
heavy power equipment for each member of the farm labour force.

A further measure of the extent of farm mechanization in 
Alberta is provided in Table XV which indicates the change in the 
number of farms reporting tractors. In 1931 only 22 per cent of the 
farms in Alberta reported tractors as a source of power, while by 
1956 the proportion had risen to 86 per cent. Of the 79>400 farm 
units in 1956 a total of 68,400 were tractor operated. Thus there 
remained in Alberta in that year only 11,000 farms without tractors, 
and these were almost all very small holdings. 

Putting it another way, almost 90 per cent of the entire farm 
labour force in 1956 required the M know how” to operate and to main¬ 
tain tractors and accompanying farm implements, as compared with 16 
per cent in 1931* The increase in farm tractors in relation to the 
labour force is indicated in Table XVI.

The changes in farm size and the large capital outlays that 
accompanied the mechanization of agriculture in Alberta, caused a 
pronounced change in the nature of farm operations between 1931 and 1956. 
More and more were the characteristics of big business invading the 
agricultural scene. The total investment by farmers in major items 
of farm machinery moved from $116 million in 1931 to $688 million in 
1956 , for a six-fold increase in a twenty-five year period, as recorded 
in Table XIV; and these figures do not include expenditures for many 
types of minor farm implements and electrical appliances. Further 
treatment of the financial implications of this investment were given 
under a later analysis of farm income and expenditure. 

The Number and Size of Farms 

Mechanization has made possible significant changes in the 
number and size of farms in Alberta. As has been indicated, the quarter 
and half section farms of the early settlement era, in many instances, 
proved inadequate. The cultivation of marginal and sub-marginal land 
on a small scale, in the face of low and uncertain yields and prices, 
was extremely hazardous. Larger acreages were needed for an effective 
economic unit; mechanization made this possible. 

Table XVII was designed to illustrate the trend toward larger 
farms in Alberta. In 1931 over 45 per cent of the farms did not 
exceed 200 acres in size, the majority being quarter section plots. 

This meant that in many instances there were four families on a 
single section of land. The above proportion, however, steadily

declined until by 1956 it had reached 26 per cent* The extent of the 
decrease is further emphasized by the fact that in 1931 the number 
of such farms (less than 200 acres) was 40,000 while in 1956 it was 
only 17,500* In 1931 only 15 per cent of Alberta 1 s farms had acreages 
of more than one section, while in 1956 the proportion had reached 25 
per cent. 

Trends in farm size have not been uniform throughout Alberta* 

The general tendency has been toward much larger farms in the prairie 
regions of southern Alberta than in the mixed farming areas of north¬ 
ern Alberta* As indicated in Table XVIII only about 20 per cent of the 
farms in southern Alberta were in 1956 under 240 acres in size, while 
the proportion for the northern part of the province was over 33 per 
cent* On the other hand, over 36 per cent of the former was over 
759 acres in size, while less than 13 per cent of the latter fell in 
this category. Of the very large farms (over 1600 acres) more than 
3,000 were located in the seven southern divisions (1956) while only 
about 300 were found in the eight northern census divisions* Not 
only is the number of farm families decreasing much more rapidly 
in southern Alberta, but those remaining are much more widely scat¬ 
tered over the countryside than in northern Alberta. This trend 
appears likely to continue. There will remain the problS*m of pro¬ 
viding adequate educational facilities, as well as that of insuring 
properly trained personnel to manage rapidly expanding farm units.

Mechanization and Residenc e Patterns 

An examination of trends in the number and size of farms does 
not tell the whole story of what is happening to farm communities in 
Alberta# The fact is that more and more farm operators and owners no 
longer reside on the farms they operate# This trend has been in 
progress throughout Canada in recent years, but has been particularly 
pronounced in those areas of the prairie region where grain growing 
has been the chief agricultural activity# In 1951 the number of 
non-resident farm operators in Canada amounted to about 8 per cent 
of the total, while the proportions for Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and 
Alberta, as recorded in Table XIX, were 8.6, 16.2, and 9.9 per cent 
respectively# By 1956 there had been a change of less than one per 
cenu for Canada, while in Saskatchewan there was an 8 per cent increase, 
and in Manitoba and Alberta an increase of over 2 per cent. This 
appears to be a trend that is much more pronounced in the Prairie 
Provinces than elsewhere in Canada# 

In 1956 a total of 9*366 Alberta farms had non-resident 
operators. Thus to the reduction of 20,000 in the number of farms 
between 1931 and 1956 must be added the above figure, if an accurate 
assessment of the number of farm owners who are residing on farms is 
to be made. The movement away from the farm is more than half as 
large again as data on the number of farms would indicate# 

While the increase in the number of non-resident farm operators 
has been considerable throughout Alberta, it has been much more pro¬ 
nounced in southern Alberta, as indicated by the data provided in

Table XX. The mechanization of grain farms, with the consequent 
disappearance of the horse as a means of power, has made it pos¬ 
sible for farmers to be away from their farms for long periods of 
time. On the other hand, many mixed farming operations make all- 
year residence on the farm a necessity, except in instances where 
farms are within easy travelling distance of larger centres of 
population. 

Mechanization and Farm Tenure 

In 1931 more than 70,000 of the farms were owner operated. 

This was almost 75 per cent of the total at that time, and was very 
nearly equal to the total farms in operation in 1956. There were 
fewer farms operated by tenants in 1956 than in 1931, but the pro¬ 
portion remained rather constant. However, as early as 1931 a con¬ 
siderable number of farmers leased or rented additional land in order 
to expand their farming operations, as mechanization made such 
expansion desirable. 

In 1931 less than 15 per cent of Alberta*s farmers fell in 
the owner-tenant category (14,540 farmers), while in 1956 over 27 
per cent was so classified (a total of almost 22,000). This was 
more than 25 per cent of the total farm operators in that year. The 
details provided in Table XXI indicate that while the owner and 
tenant operated farms decreased considerably in numbers between 1931 
and 1956, the owner-tenant operated farms increased substantially. 

The growing importance of farming as a business is indicated 
by the increase in the number of farms in Alberta operated by managers.

in 1931 there were only 309 farms so operated; by 1956 the number had 
more than doubled to reach 756* Although numerically the group was 
not large in 1956, the relative change for the period was great. If 
the trend continues, and there seems to be no reason to doubt this, 
a growing number of specially trained people will be required for 
these managerial positions. 

Mechanization and the Age of Farm Operators 

The change from subsistence farming to farming as a business 
has effected a change in the distribution of farmers by age groups. 
Farmers as a group, were considerably younger in 1931 than in 1941* 
but the trend was reversed between 1941 and 1951* After making allow¬ 
ances for the enlistment of a number of young farmers between 1939 
and 1941> it is still apparent that a general trend was in progress. 

Table XXII indicates, that, while in 1941 slightly over 42 per 
cent of Alberta 1 s farmers were over fifty years of age, the proportion 
was reduced to 38 per cent by 1951; the corresponding proportion in 
1931 was 32 per cent. Also, there were relative increases in 1951 in 
the number of farmers in each of the younger age groups. It would 
appear that this change can be attributed in part to the tendency for 
more farmers to retire to urban centres in later life, and, in part, 
to the mechanization of farming which has made agriculture a more 
attractive calling both from the standpoint of operation and of 


renumeration,

Mechanization and Lan d Usage 

Mechanization, as already indicated, has made possible more 
extensive farming operations in Alberta. Since 1931 almost seven 
million acres have been added to the total area included in farms. 

Heavy machinery has facilitated the breaking of new land, land drain¬ 
age, irrigation, the extensive cultivation of marginal land, and has 
helped in making land more accessible. However, it can be noted from 
Table XXIII that the acreage under crops was only greater by two mil¬ 
lion acres in 1956 than in 1931, while the acreage under summer fallow 
was almost double the 1931 figure. Thus the taxable acreage increased 
considerably during the period, but the revenue producing acreage 
(under crops) increased but slightly. 

In 1931 almost 525*000 acres of improved land were used for 
pasture; by 1956 more than 1,280,000 acres were so used. This affected 
the tax producing capacity of more than a million acres of farm land* 
The problem resulting from changes in land usage was given further 
consideration when assessments and tax revenues were examined. 

III. EDUCATIONAL SIGNIFICANCE 

The most serious deterrent to the effective reorganization of 
rural education in Alberta has been sparsity of population. Increases 
in farm size('Table XVII)have caused an even v/ider scatter of farm pop¬ 
ulation, as has the reduction in the labour force resulting from mech¬ 
anization (Table XVI). The situation has been further aggravated by 
the movement of considerable numbers of farm owners to urban residences.

This changing pattern of rural residence at a time when the program 
of studies is being continually broadened has made it increasingly 
more difficult to provide adequate educational opportunities for rural 
children. 

The dependence of the rural economy upon the industrial economy 
in Alberta has increased directly in proportion to the decrease in 
the farm labour force and the increased use of power machines (Tables 
XIV & XV). More and more is the farmer becoming a specialized producer: 
the days of self-sufficiency are past. As a user of manufactured pro¬ 
ducts he is becoming a consumer in the urban sense. The farmer requires 
special repair services for his farm machines and special facilities 
for the processing of his farm products. Skills such as bread, butter, 
and cheese making are becoming lost arts on the farm, as have meat 
curing and processing, blacksmithing, and woodworking. But with the 
abandonment of old skills came the need for the development of new ones; 
and these could not be passed from father to son, and from mother to 
daughter, as had been the case in the past. Training in the operation 
and maintenance of complicated machines required a broader and deeper 
basic knowledge than was required in the past when machines were much 
simpler. In addition, on the highly mechanized farm, the operator 
may be the only person within miles of the job. Unless he is able to 
carry out machine maintenance, adjustment, and simple repairs, much 
valuable "machine time" may be lost. Each worker requires a type of 
mechanical "know how" that formerly was possessed by a few specialists. 

In some aspects farm management has become simpler. For example,

it is simpler to plan a daily work schedule for one or more machine 
operators than for a larger number of hired labourers; but, on the 
other hand, money management has become far more complicated. Costly 
repairs, although bearable in good times, may be the “last straw” in 
lean times. Not only are the services of specialists costly, but 
lost “machine time” during the planting and harvesting season may be 
disastrous indeed. 

Many of the present farm operators in Alberta have had to do 
considerable unlearning in order to make a successful adjustment to 
the changing pattern of farming. The young farm operators of to- 
morrow will be spared the learning of two sets of skills, and will 
gain considerable practical “know how” from having grown up in a 
“machine” environment. Nevertheless, the keen competition in com¬ 
mercial agriculture makes it imperative that the coming generation 
of farmers be long on managerial and mechanical knowledge. 

Farming today, particularly grain farming, requires the 
farmer to be on the job fewer months of the year. During busy periods 
he may operate his machines twenty or more hours per day, but for 
several months during the winter he has but little to do. This has 
led to a movement to town by a growing number of farmers and their 
families (Table XIX). This movement has further depopulated the coun¬ 
tryside, particularly in Southern Alberta (Table XX), and has removed 
a growing number of farm youths from direct contact with the farm. 

This is further evidence of the transition of farming from a “way of 
life” to a business venture. Although practical experience is of great

value to farm owners, a growing number of Alberta*s farms are being 
operated by non-resident owners, some of whom do not possess a farm 
background, and a growing proportion of whom employ a farm manager 
(Table XXl)« Thus, there are growing opportunities in agriculture 
for persons with specialized mechanical and managerial skills 0 The 
foundation must be laid in the public school* This need constitutes 
a real challenge to rural education in Alberta.

in status from a "self-contained economy to an interdependent sector 
of a vast and complicated economic system.As a result, agricul¬ 
tural problems have become more closely allied to economic problems 
in other sectors of the economy. Many of these problems have centred 
around the marketing of a rapidly increasing output of farm products. 
Samuelson has succinctly emphasized the growing dependence of agri- 
on other phases of the economy: 

Its growing dependence on the exchange system makes agri¬ 
culture increasingly vulnerable to business fluctuations. In 
an industrial economy, this dependence may well be the Achil¬ 
lea heel of agriculture. Such vulnerability has already given 
rise to a host of price and income problems in agriculture®^ 

Attention was given in this investigation to some of these 
“price and income problems" in an effort to determine the buoyancy 
of the agricultural economy of Alberta. Special consideration was 
given to the interrelationship of production, price and income as 
it influences financial stability within agriculture. 

It was necessary to make a distinction between efficient and 
well-managed commercial farms and the smaller and relatively unpro¬ 
ductive farm units. Since most of the farms in Alberta fall in the 
latter category (Table XXXII), the general stability of the agri¬ 
cultural economy still rests largely upon these smaller units. The 
analyses which follow do not apply particularly to the economic 
status of the highly productive commercial farms, which, while few 
in number, absorb a considerable percentage of the gross value of 
farm products sold annually (Table XXXII).

The Control of Production 

Success in the management of any economic enterprise depends 
to no small degree upon the control of production. If production is 
not controlled, or is uncontrollable, serious maladjustments peri¬ 
odically occur. Agricultural production is largely uncontrollable. 
As a result, more products are grown in many years than can be sold 
profitably, while at other times not enough products are available 
to meet market demands. If the price of a certain crop is high at 
planting time, the acreage is increased; if the price is low, the 
acreage is reduced. The sale of large outputs tends to depress 
prices; when production is curtailed, prices tend to rise*^ It is 
apparent, however, that even if farmers could anticipate prices and 
curtail or expand their acreages accordingly, they could not control 
the volume of production, because of uncontrollable factors such as 
weather conditions. If conditions are very favourable, there may be 
over-production even with a curtailment of the area under crop; if 
weather conditions are unfavorable, under-production results. 

Table XXIV illustrates the difficulty of regulating pro¬ 
duction through variations in acreage. In 1955 > for example, the 
acreage devoted to wheat production was approximately 1,000,000 
acres less than in 1946, yet production was 6,000,000 bushels 
higher. The acreages in 1941 and 1953 were almost identical; how¬ 
ever, the crop in 1953 was one and two-thirds times as great as in 
1941o

indicates the wide variation that existed during the period 1941-55. 
Between 1953 and 1954 there was a drop of almost ten bushels per acre, 
while between 1954 and 1955 there was an increase of seven bushels per 
acre. The difficulties encountered in attempts to control wheat pro¬ 
duction are readily apparent.

a Specific data not available before 1941. 


Wheat, being the major field crop in Alberta, has been used 
for illustrative purposes; however, similar difficulties pertain to 
the production of other field crops. Over-production means reduced 
prices and growing stock piles; under-production often leads to inad- 
ea_uate returns at a time when prices are likely to be high. This 
causes serious instability in farm incomes; and this instability may 
occur in agriculture in periods of general prosperity in other parts 

























132 


of the economy* For this reason the problem of financing essential 
services is particularly acute in rural areas. 

The Nature of the Demand for Farm Products 

The demand for farm products is very inelastic. This results 
from the fact that most such products are necessities: as a result, 
there is no great tendency for consumers to increase or to decrease 
their purchases in response to price changes. Drastically reduced 
prices in the face of an over-supply of a product may result in 
very little more being taken off the market. Producers are thus 
hard hit by the reduced price at the time it is introduced, and the 
piling up of surpluses further jeopardizes future prices.^ 

Because of the 11 low income elasticity 11 of the demand for 
food, a rising standard of living as industrialization progresses, 
means a relative decline in agriculture in relation to other indus¬ 
tries. Up to a point, the demand for food increases as incomes move 
upward, but after that the demand decreases relative to the demand 
for other goods and services. Total expenditures increase as incomes 
increase, but at a retarded rate. ¥hen this occurs, the proportion 
spent for food is even more retarded in growth. This falling off in 
the demand for food products as incomes rise does not mean that agri¬ 
culture in Alberta will actually decline: it does mean that the rel¬ 
ative share of agriculture in terms of provincial output will tend to 

decrease, even though the absolute amount of production may enjoy 

5 

considerable expansion. 









133 


During the early stages of industrialization in the western 
world the demand for food products by the lower income groups was 
sufficient to absorb a large proportion of expanding agricultural 
production: chronic over-production occurred only in periods of ser¬ 
ious recession when incomes were drastically reduced. As incomes rose, 
there came a shift in demand for food from cereal to animal products. 
Although the market for cereal products in the underdeveloped countries 
of the world has tended to counteract the shift in demand in the western 
world, tariff and exchange restrictions have seriously curtailed for¬ 
eign marketing: furthermore, western farmers are in keen competition 
with other producers for the disposal of agricultural products on the 
world markets* 

A reorganization of production to conform to the changing 
pattern of demand has had to be faced by Alberta farmers. The Hheat 
Acreage Reduction Act of 1941-43 illustrates the serious situation 
that developed in agriculture during years of general prosperity with¬ 
in the economy as a whole®^ 

Production and Farm Price Stability 

Some attention has been given to the serious problems facing 
Alberta farmers in the matter of regulating production in the light 
of market demand. A proper balance between supply and demand would 
lead to greater price stability. But farmers sell their products in 
highly competitive markets where prices can change almost momentarily* 
Thus, added to uncontrollable production and inelastic demand, is an

unstable price structure. 

Menzies described this instability in relation to wheat prices 

thus: 


The problem of the instability of wheat prices is continually 
before the western farmer. In a free economy relative prices are 
the means whereby adjustments are made in relations between sup¬ 
ply and demand. This allocative function of price changes gives 
rise to proportional income transfers between buyers and sellers. 
The income transfer is not a matter of concern as long as the 
price mechanism works relatively efficiently, as it does when 
responses to price changes are large and occur with promptness. 

In these circumstances market adjustments of considerable mag¬ 
nitude can be secured with relatively small disturbances to gen¬ 
eral economic and social relations. Eut the demand for wheat 
for human consumption is notoriously inelastic. So also is the 
producers supply curve, due in part to the immobility of 
resources. But even if acreage were reduced, great variations 
in yield may nullify his best intentions.^ 


Table XXV records the relationship between production and 
crop value of the four major grain crops of Alberta for the years 

1952 and 1954* The acreage planted to wheat was somewhat less in 


1954 than in 1952, but the total yield was almost 50 per cent lower; 


a similar decrease was apparent for other grain crops. However, the 
value per bushel for wheat, barley and rye was considerably less in 


1954 * and on the basis of total value the 1954 crop was only 50 per 


cent of the 1952 total. The above analysis, while not talcing into 
consideration the stored grain that had piled up from previous years, 
indicates the precarious position of Alberta grain growers. Yields 
were less in 1954 because of poor growing conditions; in addition, 
the situation was aggravated by falling prices. The inelasticity of 
supply and demand, uncertain volume of production, surpluses from 
previous years, and uncertain markets all contribute to unstable

conditions in the marketing of grain crops* 

Although grain prices are more unstable than the prices of 
many other farm products, the farmer is faced with similar hazards, 
in varying degrees, regardless of what he produces*. Some relief has 
been gained through crop diversification, but it is not simple in an 
age of mechanization to move from one line of farming to another*. 

Fixed and Variable Production Costs 

A large proportion of the total cost structure in farming does 
not vary with the quantity of production. Items such as rent for 
land and buildings, interest and amortization of mortgages, interest 
on investments in equipment and livestock, depreciation on property 
and equipment that does not depend upon use, insurance on buildings, 
equipment and livestock, taxes on real property, and the cost of 
family labour must be met regardless of the level of production. The 
vulnerability of the farmer*s position, serious as it may be on account 
of fixed cost, is even more serious, if, after committing himself to 
considerable financial outlays for variable costs—seed, fertilizer, 
hired labour, repair and other services—there is a crop failure or 
the bottom falls out of the market for the products he has for sale* 
Data on fixed costs to Alberta farmers were arranged in Table 
XXVI so as to indicate general trends; the ratio of fixed costs to 
total operational costs was also recorded. Although fixed costs 
increased threefold between 1941 and 1955, there was very little 
change in the ratio to variable costs, since total operational costs

increased in almost the same proportion as fixed costs. Thus Alberta 
farmers, during the past fifteen years, could have reduced annual 
expenditures by little less than one-half, even if they produced not¬ 
hing* Items such as annual payment of taxes, rent, and interest can 
be postponed only temporarily, and, if postponed, serve further to 
jeopardize the financial stability of the farm economy. 

Fixed costs tend to make adjustments in production much more 
difficult than do variable costs. fallen the farmer has made heavy 
financial outlays in a particular line of production, it is not easy 
for him to change quickly to other lines. Thus a serious decline in 
market prices may mean heavy financial losses until a n change over 11 
of operations can be made. Meanwhile, contractual obligations must 
be met. Hence, even during periods of "rock bottom 51 prices the 
farmer attempts to produce and to sell enough products to recover 
his cash outlay for the crop and to meet his annual fixed costs, 
even though this action tends further to depress the market by the 
creation of an over-supply of produce. 

The Relative Position of Agricultural Production 

Agriculture in Alberta has not only lost ground as an emp¬ 
loyer of persons in relation to other sectors of the economy, but It 
has declined in its contribution to the total net value of production. 
Table X&VXI shows the dollar and percentage shares of agriculture, 
other primary industries, and secondary industries in the total net 
value of production in Alberta. It is evident that during the past

twenty-five years, while the percentage for other industries has 
moved steadily upward, the relative importance of agriculture has 
decreased from a high of almost 55 per cent in 1936 to less than 
25 per cent in 1956* The period of most rapid decline began in 
1951s this marked the beginning of the most remarkable process of 
economic transformation in Alberta 1 s history. 

A boomimg oil industry caused the dollar value of production 
in primary industries, other than agriculture, to more than double 
in a five-year period—$181 million in 1951 to $429 million in 1956® 
Meanwhile, unprecedented expansion in construction, accompanied by 
a steady rise in manufacturing, caused a similar increase in the net 
value of production in Alberta*s secondary industries—$321 million 
in 1951 to $687 million in 1956. During the same interval agri- 

q 

cultural production dropped in value by almost 30 per cent. 7 

Table XXVH also illustrates the violent year to year fluct¬ 
uations that have taken place in the net value of agricultural pro¬ 
duction, as compared with the rather uniform year to year increases 
in other primary and secondary industries* The data label agri¬ 
culture as the least buoyant sector of the provincial economy as 
well as the most unpredictable. 

The Financing of Agricultural Production 

The farmer is largely at the mercy of the elements and other 
"quirks of nature" such as excessive rainfall, drought, insect pests: 
and disease. Some risks—fire and hail—are insurable, but it has

been found exceedingly difficult to provide adequate protection 
against other hazards at reasonable costs. Because of the risk 
involved, agricultural production has been difficult to finance. 
Loans secured by anticipated crops are hazardous; as a result, they 
command a high interest rate. In the case of livestock the period 
of credit must be sufficient for the stock to mature. Land is more 
stable and is the farmer's best security for credit, but there is no 
way for him to avoid rather high interest rates. The farmer cannot 
sell common or preferred stock, as can many other businessmen, nor 
can he readily secure short-term loans at low rates of interest. 
However, some relief has been given in the form of farm loan credit 
backed by government guarantees. 

Some of the problems of agricultural production have been 
briefly reviewed. Vthile they do not bear directly on educational 
finance, they do influence farm income, which in turn influences 
the farmer's ability to pay for all essential services. 

H. FARM INCOME 

A few decades ago the ownership of land constituted a fair 
measure of wealth in Alberta, a province which was largely agri¬ 
cultural. Cash incomes were not large, but quantities of money 
involved in business transactions were small, too. In times of 
depression, while some farmers went bankrupt, many were able to 
survive financially because of a self-sufficiency which, to a degree 
at least, insulated them against financial disasters in other sectors

of the economy. But to-day farm finance is subject to the same influ¬ 
ences as business finance in general, and to others as well, which 
arise out of close contact with natural phenomena. In addition, the 
farm economy has lost its insular position. This has placed the far¬ 
mer in the position of requiring a much larger income than formerly, 
and has made his position much more vulnerable to forces acting 
within the total economy. The general level of farm income, its dis¬ 
tribution among farm operators, and the nature and extent of recent 
fluctuations in farm prices all influence the financing of essential 
services. 

Trends in Farm Income 

It has been observed that Alberta farmers were hard hit by 
the serious recession of the early thirties. Table XXVIII records 
a total net income to farmers of slightly over $10 million in the 
year 1931* In the same year operation and depreciation charges amoun¬ 
ted to more than the total cash income from the sale of farm pro¬ 
ducts—$81 million as opposed to $74 million. This is a clear 
indication of the disastrous effects of high fixed costs upon the 
financial position of fanners in years of small yields or of low 
prices. 

From the very low level of 'the depression years net farm 
income in Alberta moved sharply upward during the war years to 
reach a high of more than $390 million in 1951? this was almost 
forty times the 1931 total. During the years since 1951 farm income 
has shown considerable instability. There was a sharp downward

trend until 1954s since that year there has been a moderate annual 
upward trend. The instability of farm income is even more apparent 
when it is observed that there was no reduction in operating and 
depreciation charges to accompany the drop-off in income. 

In 1954 net farm income was just slightly higher than in 
1946, but in the meantime the cost of living index had moved from 
77.5 in 1946 to 116.2 in 1954> for an increase of almost 55 per cent. 
Thus in terms of purchasing power farm incomes were even more sharply 
reduced. Moderate increases since 1954 have been partially offset 
by further rises in the cost of living index. In relative terms 
Alberta farmers were in a less favorable financial position in 1956 
than in 1946, but were in a relatively better position than they were 
in 1931. 

The Components of Farm Income 

The data provided in Table XXVIII indicate the general trends 
in the several components of farm income. During tte past decade 
income-in-kind has remained relatively constant. This has been due 
to the relatively small increase in farm population during the period 
and to the general tendency for farm families to consume more factory 
processed and packaged goods and less farm-prepared products. Th& 
farmer 1 s self-sufficiency has suffered accordingly^ this places him 
in a much more vulnerable position in times of falling cash income. 

Inventory changes have fluctuated greatly during the past two 
decades, and, for the most part, have represented changes in grain 
carry-over on farms. During the war years there was no surplus

were disposed of by 1954; however, in 1955 inventory changes amounted 
to approximately ^50 million to represent 25 per cent of net farm 
income® Since then the wheat carry-over has continued to rise rat¬ 
her sharply to place prairie wheat farmers in a rather vulnerable 
position. 

Operation and depreciation charges, while increasing mar¬ 
kedly between 1931 and 1952, did so at a slower rate than the rise 
in receipts; however, the sharp decline in net farm income since 
1952 has not been accompanied by a decrease in operating expenses 
and depreciation charges. 

Table SXIK was designed to illustrate the percentage changes 
in income components for 1941 and 1955• The percentage increase in 
the 1955 over the 1941 cash income was quite similar to the pro¬ 
portionate increase in net farm income; but, there were significant 
changes in the various income components. Inventory changes, for 
example, were increased by more than 350 per cent by 1955? while 
operation and depreciation charges were almost three times as high. 

If the value of the large carry-over of wheat is deducted from net 
farm income, net receipts to farmers were only about twice as great 
in 1955 as in 1941* The upward trend in the cost of living index 
reduced the relative increase still more* 

An analysis of the percentage composition of farm income for 
the two years—1941 and 1951—indicates that inventory changes were 
27 per cent higher in 1955? while operation and depreciation charges

were 13 per cent higher. The farmer thus appears to be on the horns 
of a dilemma: as production is stepped up appreciably, inventory chan¬ 
ges which are non-cash items of income for the current year, create 
problems for the future; as production is drastically curtailed, oper¬ 
ational and depreciation charges drain away a larger proportion of 
farm income. 


Average Net Farm Income 

The general instability of net farm income, particularly dur¬ 
ing the past five-year period, has caused much concern. Table XXX 
indicates a steady upward trend in net farm income from 1931 to 1951, 
but thereafter considerable instability. Although net farm income 
per farm operator has but little real meaning, because of the wide 
range in incomes among farm operators, it does serve to illustrate 
the recent instability in the purchasing power of many farmers. In 
terms of 1956 dollars the individual farmer in Alberta was less well 
off in 1956 than in 1946; also, his net income in 1956 was but little 
more than one-half his 1951 income. 

Drummond and Mackenzie summarized the effects of farm income 
variability thus: 

Immoderate variations in farm income adversely affect the 
production and capital expansion and improvement programmes 
of farmers, but the extent to which they do so is not measur¬ 
able. Income variability also has adverse effects upon the 
credit position of the individual farmer and agriculture gen¬ 
erally. It increases costs of credit and makes private plan¬ 
ning and credit arrangements of Individual farmers difficult 
and hazardous. Income variations have serious social effects 
upon the farm family*s scale of living, affecting such per¬ 
sonal matters as plans for education and health, and other 
items of the family budget.10

Table XXXI provides data for a comparison between the average 
net income per farm operator in Alberta and the average earnings per 
member of the labour force. Until 1941 the farm operator suffered a 
pronounced financial disadvantage; by 1946 be was relatively better 
off than the average Canadian worker, and by 1951 his income was 
approximately double that of the average worker; however, by 1956 his 
average net earnings had again fallen well below the national average 
per member of the labour force. Furthermore, while the earnings per 
member of the labour force followed a steady progression upward during 
the past twenty-five years, there were marked variations both in the 
nature and direction of trends in the average earnings of farm oper¬ 
ators in Alberta, as well as elsewhere in Canada. 

The Distribution of Farm Income 

It has been observed that average net farm income does not 
give a true picture of the financial position of most farmers. Since 
data on the range of farm income for Alberta were not available, an 
analysis of the distribution of farms according to the gross value of 
products sold was attempted. Table XXXII was designed to indicate 
the distribution among selected categories for the years 1946 and 1950. 
In 1946 the average income per wage-earner in Canada was roughly 
$2500.00 (Table XXX), while in the same year 67 per cent of the farm¬ 
ers in Alberta received less than this amount in total value of pro¬ 
ducts sold. I4hen it is considered that operation and depreciation 
charges amounted to more than 50 per cent of the value of products 
sold (Table XX.VII), it is obvious that the net income of 86 per cent

of the farmers in Alberta fell below $2,500*00. On the basis of gross 
value of products sold approximately 50 per cent of Alberta farmers 
fell below the $2,500.00 level in 1950, and, after a 50 per cent 
reduction for operational and depreciation charges, almost 75 per 
cent fell in that category. This was only a mild improvement over 
the situation that prevailed in 1946® These statistics are somewhat 
distorted by the fact that no consideration was given to the supple¬ 
mentary income of farmers arising from off-the-farm employment; also, 
it seems probable that the situation was somewhat improved for the 
prosperous years following 1950 for which data were not available® 
However, an examination of the number of farmers falling in cate¬ 
gories above #5,000*00 in gross value of products sold—8 per cent 
in 1946 and 19 per cent in 1950—reveals a relative improvement over 
the period, but a comparatively small number of high-income farmers 
in 1950. On the basis of data appearing in Table XXVIII it is evi¬ 
dent that in 1951 approximately one-third of the total receipts of 
$460 million was distributed among 19 per cent of Alberta farmers® 
There are factors other than farm size which affect the dis¬ 
tribution of income among farmers. One of these is the type of 
farming operations carried on—grain growing, stock raising, and 
mixed farming* Some attention was given to the distribution of farm 
income by sources®

of the income of Alberta farmers among types of products sold. In 1952 
field crops accounted for more than 63 per cent of the value of pro¬ 
ducts sold by farmers; by 1955 the proportion had dropped to approx¬ 
imately 43 .per cent. While a part of the reduction was due to a 
steadily mounting surplus of unsold wheat and to declining market 
prices, a considerable proportion resulted from a change over from 
grain growing to livestock production. The sale of livestock incre¬ 
ased from 26 per cent of sales in 1952 to almost 40 per cent in 1955 » 
the corresponding proportions for dairy products were 5 per cent and 
8 per cent, respectively. 

The shift from the production of field crops to livestock has 
afforded the individual farmer considerable control of output. How¬ 
ever, collective output, providing the demand remains stable, is the 
major cause of price variability, and over this the individual farmer 
has no control, livestock production also depends upon the available 
supply of course grains and fodder. Thus lean years in the yield of 
field crops are apt to be followed by a downward trend in marketable 
livestock; thus the farmer remains in a somewhat vulnerable position. 
This vulnerability has been somewhat mitigated by diversified mixed 
farming operations: in this way the risks connected with output and 
price variability are spread over a number of enterprises. However, 
mixed farming practices increase somewhat operational costs and limit 
the possibilities of increasing net farm income through large-scale 
production: this leaves the farmer more at the mercy of the cost- 
price squeeze in periods of declining market prices for agricul¬ 
tural products in general.

At the present time—1959—a rather buoyant market for live¬ 
stock and livestock products has tended to offset the rather static 
condition in the wheat market. This could very well produce a much 
more pronounced trend in the change-over from field crops to live¬ 
stock production and mixed farming operations in Alberta. In this 
event, the whole pattern of farming and of rural living would be 
affected. 

III. EDUCATIONAL SIGNIFICANCE 

The financing of education by local authorities in rural 
Alberta is quite firmly anchored to the land tax. As a result, 
economic conditions within agriculture have vital implications for 
education. In the past, rapid progress has been made in the exten¬ 
sion of educational and other services during periods of prosper¬ 
ity within the farm economy: in periods of !t economic drought 1 * very 
little progress has been made. 

One of the major problems in agriculture arises out of the 
nature of the demand for farm products; it is notoriously inelas¬ 
tic. Closely allied with this is the hazard of uncontrollable pro¬ 
duction (Table XXIV). Deflated prices are no guarantee of the dis¬ 
posal of farm products (Table IXV). If inventories pile up, a finan¬ 
cial crisis may occur in agriculture even during a period of increas¬ 
ing prosperity in other sectors of the economy. As a result, the 
hazard of falling incomes and the consequent inability of farmers to 
meet fully the financial needs of education and other local services 







156 


is not confined entirely to periods of widespread depression* 

A high level of total operational costs (Table XXVI) has 
greatly increased the vulnerability of the farm economy* Farmers 
are caught in a cost-price squeeze* As the market price per unit- 
of product hovers too close to the cost of production, profits tend 
to disappear; if it falls below the cost of production, as is not 
uncommon, an actual loss ensues* On the other hand, In periods of 
falling prices farmers have high fixed costs to meet even if they 
produce nothing. 

Highly efficient commercial farmers, who produce on a large 
scale, can operate successfully on a very narrow margin of profit. 
However, most Alberta farmers are not in this classification (Table 
XXXII), and the cost-price squeeze, in a very real sense, limits 
their ability to provide the cash outlays required for the main¬ 
tenance of existing educational services and the creation of new ones* 

At the time that the property tax was made the base for the 
local support of education, agriculture was the major and most buoy¬ 
ant sector of the economy of Alberta; but, during the past two dec¬ 
ades it has lost ground relative to other primary and secondary 
industries* In addition, the net value of agricultural production 
has fluctuated violently from year to year, while other sectors of 
the economy have enjoyed a steadily increasing upward trend (Table 

xxvn). 

The general upward trend in net farm income between 1931 and 
1951 occasioned a growing demand for improved local services (Table

XXVIII). Particularly during the second decade of the period, much 
progress was made. However, the sharp downward trend in net farm 
income between 1951 and 1954 affected adversely the farmers 1 ability 
to support continually expanding services; although the trend has been 
upward since 1954> the level is far below that achieved in 1951. 

There have been marked fluctuations in the average net income 
of farm operators in Alberta (Table XXX), as well as in the value of 
gross products sold (Table XXXII), and in the ratio of average net 
farm income to the average earnings per member of the labour force 
(Table XXXI). But averages are not too meaningful, since a rela¬ 
tively small number of commercial farmers absorb a considerable pro¬ 
portion of the income received by Alberta farmers through the sale 
of farm products (Table XXXII). It would appear that the high- 
income commercial farmers are well able to extend their financial 
support to education and other local services; however, there is 
some doubt as to the ability of many low-income farmers to expand 
appreciably their present level of support. 

There has been a tendency in recent years for a growing num¬ 
ber of Alberta farmers to 11 switch” to mixed farming operations and 
to stock raising (Table XXXIII). A continuance of this trend will 
affect appreciably the number of farms, the resident farm population, 
and the labour force employed on farms; these, in turn, will affect 
the nature of training required by farm workers, the total school 
population, and the ^quantity” and location of school facilities. If 
the change to mixed production results in greater stability of farm

income, Alberta farmers might well be in a much better position to 
give financial support to local services. However, unless greater 
buoyancy is experienced in the farm economy as a whole, there is some 
doubt as to the wisdom of continuing to anchor rural education to a 
sector of the provincial economy which not only has lost its buoy¬ 
ancy, but, in addition, is beset with violent year to year fluctu¬ 
ations which result in financial uncertainities*

CHAPTER VI 


THE FINANCING OF EDUCATION IN ALBERTA 


Problem 

The major question treated in this chapter is: ¥hat has been 
the significance of trends in the financial support of education in 
Alberta during the past twenty-five years? 

Sub-Problems 

This involved an examination of trends in the following sub¬ 
problem areas: 

1. the relationship between educational and total provincial 
expenditures; 

2* the per capita provincial expenditure for education; 

3o the relationship between per capita income and per capita 
expenditures for education; 

4* the revenues and expenditures of school units; 

5. the distribution of educational expenditures among facil¬ 
ities and services; 

6, the capital indebtedness of school units in Alberta* 

I 0 PROVINCIAL PARTICIPATION IN EDUCATIONAL FINANCE 

In the province of Alberta the development of more effec¬ 
tive organization and operation of schools has been accompanied by 
increasing expenditures both at the local and at the provincial level*

Since 1939 school enrolment has increased by one-half, provincial 
revenue has increased tenfold, and school expenditures have multi¬ 
plied twentyfold. This would indicate that Albertans have taken 
seriously their financial responsibilities for education,, 

In Alberta, as elsewhere, there has been a vigorous exam¬ 
ination of educational standards at all levels, but particularly 
at the public school level. The charge that 11 the watering down of 
the curriculum and the erosion of standards in the elementary and 
secondary schools are responsible for the absolute and relative 
decline in the educational level of our youth 11 has been made by- 
persons in many walks of life. Others, particularly school admin¬ 
istrators, teachers, and lay groups which are closely associated 
with the process of education have denied these charges and point 
to inadequate financing of education as the deterrent to maximum 
progress in the quality of education being made available to our 
youth .^ 


The Educational Policies Commission of the National Edu¬ 
cation Association recently stated: 

Every major study of the status of American education 
tells the same story of neglect. It is a story of crises 
in education, of teachers poorly paid and in inadequate 
numbers, of poor communities struggling to pay mounting 
school bills, of classroom shortages .... These prob¬ 
lems are not entirely monetary, but lack of money is the 
major element 0 • • • at a minimum, expend!tures^for edu¬ 
cation should be doubled within a decade . • . • 

Speaking on the same topic, William G. Carr, executive sec¬ 
retary of the National Education Association, remarked: 







162 


We could make rapid and substantial improvements in the 
quality of our schools right now if we had the financial 
resources to do as well as we already know how to do.^ 

It was not the purpose of this dissertation to derive evi¬ 
dence to support either of the rival claims; whichever may be true, 
expenditures in education may reflect the impact of certain econ¬ 
omic problems. Since rural education is an integral part of public 
education in general, some attention was given to the total pattern 
of educational finance in Alberta; the analysis provided a frame¬ 
work within which to examine and to evaluate developments in the 
financing of rural education. 


Provincial Expenditures for Education 

During its entire history as a province, Alberta has received 
considerable aid for education from its provincial treasury* partic¬ 
ularly has this been true during the past two decades. In 1939 the 
total of provincial expenditures for education was approximately 
#3 millions by 195V the total had reached more than $50 million* 
Table XXXIV records the steady upward progression in educational 
expenditures per year; by 1954 the annual increase had reached very 
nearly $13 million, and between 1954 and 1957 total expenditures 
actually doubled® On a per capita basis—total population—educa¬ 
tional costs were fourteen times as great in 1957 as in 1939* 

Not only have the total and per capita expenditures for edu¬ 
cation by the government of Alberta increased, but the increase has 
been relatively greater than for other departments of government.

Total provincial net disbursements increased about twelvefold between 
1939 and 1957, while educational expenditures were increasing by 
almost twentyfold (Table XXXIV). 

In 1939 educational expenditures represented 13 per cent of 
the provincial total; by 1957 the ratio was 30 per cent. Following 
World War II Alberta enjoyed a record flow of monies into the pro¬ 
vincial treasury, and revenues far exceeded expenditures. Educa¬ 
tion received 11.8 per cent of total revenue in 1939; by 1957 the 
proportion was 19.4 per cent. On a per capita basis education also 
enjoyed a decided advantage, representing one-seventh of total per 
capita expenditures in 1939 and approximately one-third in 1957. 

Personal Income and Educational Expenditure 

General prosperity in Alberta has meant a steadily rising 
level of personal incomes this has increased the financial ability 
of Albertans to support educational and other services. Table XXXV 
records comparative data on per capita personal income and per capita 
expenditures—total population—for public school education from 1931 
to 1956. During the early 1930*s earnings were at a very low ebb, and, 
as a result, educational expenditures consumed only 6 per cent of 
total personal income; with the return of prosperity the proportion 
fell to 2.8 per cent in 1951; however, by 1954? because of a level¬ 
ling off in the rate of increase in personal income in the inter¬ 
vening years and a continual upward swing in educational expenditures 
the proportion approached 4*1 P er cent. By 1956 it had dropped to

3*7 per cent. Thus the educational load, incomewise, was considerably 
heavier in 1956 than in 1951* but was considerably lighter than in 
1931» The disproportion is underlined by the observation that while 
educational expenditures per capita were increasing by approximately 
50 per cent between 1951 and 1956 the corresponding increase in per¬ 
sonal income was only 13 per cent. Thus between 1931 and 1951 there 
was a considerable decrease in educational costs relative to per capita 
income, but since 1951 the trend has been upward. 

Educational Expenditure Per Pupil 

Previous treatment was given to the increase in the pro¬ 
portion of the school population of Alberta to the total population 
and to the labour force. This alone would increase the educational 
load even if the average cost per pupil were to remain stationary or 
even to decrease. However, the average cost per pupil has increased 
annually in Alberta. Table Uffll shows the amount of the increase 
for selected years during the past quarter-century. Mhile total 
expenditures for education increased fivefold, there was less than a 
50 per cent increase in school enrolments; thus a.major portion of 
the increased educational cost was absorbed in the increase in the 
cost per pupil educated. The expenditure per pupil was more than 
three times as great in 1956 as in 1931* 

It would normally be expected that the cost per pupil in act¬ 
ual dollars would be much greater in the prosperous years of the 50*s 
than in the lean years of the 30*s, particularly in view of the

decreased purchasing power of the dollar* The cost per pupil almost 
doubled between 1946 and 1951 as a result of the higher costs of 
existing services and of substantial increases in the type of services 
provided* The centralization of school plants, the institution of new 
courses, the installation of modern equipment, greatly increased con¬ 
veyance facilities, and a lowering of the teacher-pupil ratio, all 
pushed both operational and capital costs steadily upward. 

During the same period personal income was moving upward also 
but at a lesser rate than the average cost per pupil in school. Per¬ 
sonal income per capita increased by 13 per cent between 1951 and 1956 
(Table XXXV); during the same period the average cost per pupil increased 
by 33 per cent* This represents a considerable increase in the educa¬ 
tional load relative to personal income per capita. The cost per pupil 
educated represented slightly over 14 per cent of income per capita in 
1951 as compared with 17 per cent in 1956 and 27 per cent in 1931* 

Thus the ratio in 1956 was more favorable than in 1931 but less favor¬ 
able than in 1951. Furthermore, the indications are that the cost of 
education per pupil in Alberta has by no means reached its peak.^ 

II. SCHOOL UNITS AND EDUCATIONAL FINANCE 

From its early beginnings education in Alberta has been a finan¬ 
cial responsibility of local units of school administration, although 
ultimate responsibility has legally rested with the provincial govern¬ 
ment* Through the years a growing proportion of educational costs has 
been met from the provincial treasury* This situation has caused some

concern for the preservation of local autonomy in education. The 
allocation of additional tax fields to local education authorities has 
been advocated as a supplementary source of local revenue that would 
solve the financial problems of local units, and, at the same, time, pre¬ 
serve local autonomy. The pros and c ons of this proposal were treated 
elsewhere in this dissertation; the immediate concern was with trends 

in the extent of provincial and local participation in the financing 

5 

of education in Alberta* 

Sources of Revenue of School Units in Alberta 

Provincial grants have always formed a part of the revenue of 
local school units in Alberta. Even before provincial status was achie 
ved, the territorial legislature made rather generous grants not only 
for the support of existing schools, but as an encouragement to the for 
mation of new schools. Before this the federal government provided 
limited financial aid for education in the Northwest Territories. Thus 
the question has never been one of determining whether or not the 
central authority should supplement the revenue of local education 
authorities, but rather one of how much it should contribute. 

Table XXXVII summarizes the composition of total revenue to 
school units in Alberta from 1931 to 1956, with an estimate for 1957* 

It has been observed previously that total expenditures for public 
school education in Alberta have increased almost fivefold during 
the past twenty-five years; this has meant that the revenue to local 
administrative authorities must increase accordingly. It is, therefore, 
not at all surprising that the tax on property proved inadequate to

finance sharply increasing educational costs* 

In 1931 provincial grants to local education authorities 
amounted to approximately one and one-half million dollars; this 
was slightly over 10 per cent of the total local revenue for edu¬ 
cation* Board requisitions comprised the major source of revenue, 
with tuition fees, property sales and miscellaneous receipts making 
up about 20 per cent of local receipts* By 1956 provincial grants 
to local education authorities, including capital grants, had 
reached almost $32 million to comprise almost one-half the local 
revenues for education. Preliminary figures for 1957 indicate that 

the provincial government has now become the major contributor to 

6 

local revenue for the support of education* 

Before 1951 capital costs for school construction were, to 
a very large extent, a local responsibility* However, it soon 
became apparent that success in the reorganization of school facil¬ 
ities in rural areas and the provision of adequate facilities in 
rapidly expanding urban centres would require substantial finan¬ 
cial support from the provincial treasury. In 1951 construction 
grants amounted to slightly under two million dollars; by 1956 the 
total had reached well over $7 million* This sum was well over 50 
per cent of total provincial grants for education in 1951* The pro¬ 
vincial government has participated liberally in the financing of 
school construction in Alberta in recent years* 

The decline in the proportion of total revenue to school 
authorities from local taxation underlines the growing importance of

provincial grants to education. It is equally indicative of the shift 
in financial responsibility that from 1951 to 1956 board requisitions 
on municipal authorities increased by 50 per cent while government grants 
increased by more than 200 per cent. 

Components of Expenditures of School Units 

There was but slight variation in the total expenditures of all 
school units in Alberta during the decade 1931-1941* and very little 
change in the percentage distribution of monies from local and pro¬ 
vincial funds. After 1946 total expenditures for education rose 
sharply, as did the percentage of expenditures derived from govern¬ 
ment grants. 

Table XXXVTII shows the components of school expenditures in 
Alberta for the past twenty-five years. From 1931 to 1946 capital 
expenditures were financed largely out of current revenue; further¬ 
more, such expenditures were comparatively small. By 1951* however, 
the annual expenditure for the repayment of interest and principal on 
debenture borrowings amounted to $2 million; by 1956 it had reached 
$6 million to represent more than 10 per cent of the total expenditures 
for education. 

The index of current expenditures provided in Table XXXVIII 
(1946=100)indicates a 22 per cent increase from 1931 to 1946, a 
period of fifteen years; a doubling of expenditures took place between 
1946 and 1951. This is indicative of the scale of growth in educational 
developments in Alberta immediately following ¥orld War II. Between 
1951 and 1956 the growth in current expenditures amounted to 176 per cent.

Disbursements from local funds, however, while following the same 
general pattern, increased at a much slower rate, being only 20 per 
cent higher in 194& than in 1941* The ratio for the 1946-1951 
period was SO per cent as compared to only 40 per cent for the 
1951-1956 period* The wide margin between increases in current 
expenditures for education and the expenditures of local funds for 
education underlines the extent of participation by the provincial 
government in educational finances government grants were almost 
three times as large in 1956 as in 195 !• 

Distribution of Current Expenditures by All School Units 

An analysis of current expenditures according to their dis¬ 
tribution among operating payments, non-operating payments, and cap¬ 
ital payments from current revenue, gives an insight into the nature 
of the large increases in expenditures for education in recent years* 
Summaries of total expenditures by all school units in Alberta were 
recorded in operating and non-operating categories. Operating expen¬ 
ditures refer to those incurred in the actual operation and main¬ 
tenance of schools; non-operating expenditures include the repayment 
of loans, debentures n due n , and sundry expenses* Local education 
authorities are permitted, when possible, to finance capital costs 
out of operating receipts* In Table XXX3X, in order to underline the 
trend in expenditures for actual operation and maintenance of schools, 
capital expenditures out of current revenue were deducted from oper¬ 
ating payments and added to non-operating payments*

Although, as might be expected, there were sizeable increases 
in all sectors of educational expenditures in Alberta in recent years, 
there were significant shifts in the proportions. Although operat¬ 
ing costs increased almost fourfold between 1946 and 1956, the pro¬ 
portion declined by almost 8 per cent. The general trend was upward 
between 1931 and 1946? reaching a high of 89 per cent in the latter 
year. This was followed by a sharp downward trend to 81 per cent in 
1956. Thus while operating expenditures increased from $14 million 
in 1946 to $47 million in 1956, non-operating costs absorbed a lar¬ 
ger proportion of expenditures in 1956 than in 1946. 

Non-operating payments represented more than 22 per cent of 
total expenditures in 1931? but only 5 per cent in 1946. This can 
be explained by reference to the school debts which accumulated dur¬ 
ing the depression years and which were paid off in later years in 
annual instalments. Not only was it necessary to pay off debts, but 
buildings and equipment had deteriorated during the depression years; 
this made substantial improvements necessary in years of rapidly 
rising costs. On top of all this came the school construction boom 
arising out of steeply increasing enrolments and the consolidation 
of school facilities that came during, and following, World War II. 

As a result, the actual expenditure out of current revenue for non¬ 
operating costs was almost four times as great in 1956 as in 1931* 

In an effort to avoid the high interest charges and annual 
repayment of principal connected with long-term borrowing, some local 
education authorities in Alberta have met capital costs out of current

revenue,. In the pre-war years large annual payments on previous debts 
reduced the proportion of new capital payments emanating from current 
revenue to slightly less than 4 per cent of total expenditures* There¬ 
after, the general trend was upward, reaching a high of 7*4 per cent 
in 1954> after which the proportion dropped sharply to 3.7 per cent 
in 1955# The reason for the decrease is obvious: current revenue 
became a shrinking source of capital expenditures, as other costs rose 
sharply. Debenture and other long-term borrowings were resorted to, 
and, as a result, more of the funds that formerly would have gone into 
capital payments were directed into annual payments on previously con¬ 
tracted debenture borrowings. This procedure has “frozen 11 a growing 
percentage of future school revenue. 

Capital Indebtedness of School Units 

By 1946 local education authorities in .Alberta had been able 
to liquidate most of the indebtedness that had accrued during the 
depression years, and, at the same time, were able to devote size¬ 
able proportions of current revenue to capital expenditures. Even 
though the proportion of funds so used continued to move upward 
until 1952 (Table XXXIX), the total of “not due n debenture borrow¬ 
ings moved sharply upward also. Table XL shows the extent of the 
increase for the various types of local administrative units in 
Alberta, as well as the total of “not due“ debenture and long-term 
loan balances for the period 1951-1956. The trend has been sharply 
upward from a total of §28 million in 1951 to over §67 million in

1956; this was considerably over a twofold increase in a five-year 
period. The annual increase has been roughly 30 per cent since 1952, 
and there appears to be little likelihood of any substantial drop in 
the rate of increase in the immediate future. The repayment of most 
monies borrowed since 1946 has been spread over a twenty-year period: 
this means that another ten-year period will elapse before the final 
liquidation of many 1946 borrowings. In the meantime, new obli¬ 
gations are being contracted annually at a progressively increasing 
rate. There is every indication that increasing sums of money will 
be required annually to finance Alberta’s expanding building program 
as the school population expands. 

III. EDUCATIONAL SIGNIFICANCE 

The transformation of the system of rural education in Alberta, 
the rapidly increasing needs for expanded facilities in urban centres, 
and means of providing a wide range of educational experiences for a 
rapidly growing school population, have contributed to steeply rising 
educational costs. One result has been a growing dependence upon 
grants from the provincial government as a means of financing public 
education. Not only have provincial government expenditures for 
education increased rapidly during the past two decades, but such 
expenditures have constituted a steadily growing proportion of total 
provincial expenditures for all services (Table XKKI?). The trends 
indicate a growing realization of the importance of education, and 
an acceptance of the principle that the responsibility for its support

is “wider than local.® On a comparative basis, it would appear that 
education has received preferential treatment as a department of govern¬ 
ment. This does not mean that the present level of provincial support 
is necessarily adequate, but that it is moving in the right direction. 

Albertans have assumed a steadily increasing educational load 
per capita, but this has been more than offset by a rapidly rising 
income per capita (Table XXXV): as a result, the actual financial 
load was somewhat lighter in 1951 than during the depression years 
of the thirties. However, in 1956 it was somewhat heavier than in 
195 lo A levelling off in personal income per capita in the face of 
rapidly increasing educational costs indicates the probability of a 
continuing increase in the financial load per capita—total popu¬ 
lation—for education. 

During the past twenty-five years current expenditures for 
education increased fivefold, while the number of pupils in school 
increased by only 50 per cent (Table XXXVI). This indicates that a 
major proportion of the increase resulted from an upward trend in the 
actual cost per pupil. Thus Albertans are not only faced with a 
rapidly growing number of children to be educated but by a growing 
cost per pupil in school. The cost per pupil was three times as high 
in 1956 as in 1931s the upward trend appears likely to continue. 

Provincial grants have formed a steadily growing proportion 
of the revenue of school units in Alberta (Table XXXVII). Prior to 
1951* these were largely in the form of operational grants, but, 
since that date capital grants have formed a rapidly expanding item 




181 


of provincial assistance to education. More than one-half of the 
total revenue of all school units in Alberta now comes from the pro¬ 
vincial treasury. This raises the age-old issue of the preservation 
of local autonomy in education. 

The rather rapid growth in the proportion of current expen¬ 
ditures being used for debenture payments is of some significance 
(Table XXXVIII); it indicates the inability of school units to 
finance building programs out of current revenue, and represents a 
“freezing* 1 of increasing proportions of future expenditures. While 
this appears to be a necessary accompaniment of rapidly expanding 
educational facilities, its restrictive influences are apparent. 

While operating payments continued to increase substantially through¬ 
out the period under study (1931-1956), there was, after 1946, an 
annual decrease in the ratio they bore to total expenditures (Table 
XXXIX). Future increases in operational expenditures, together with 
annual payments on long-term borrowings, will tend to increase sub¬ 
stantially the educational load in Alberta. The annual increases in 
debenture borrowings (Table XL) represent, in effect, “fixed charges 11 
which must be met annually; and, these expenditures do not contribute 
directly to the adequacy of the instructional program. It is obvious 
that the repayment of loans must be made even in periods of finan¬ 
cial drought; this could very well affect adversely instructional 
expenditures and thus the quality of instruction, unless an even 
greater financial effort were put forth.

CHAPTER VII 


FEATURES OF EDUCATIONAL FINANCE IN RURAL ALBERTA 

Problem 

The major question treated in this chapter is: What is the 
significance of trends in the financing of rural education in Alberta 
during the past twenty-five years? 

Sub-Problems 

This involved an examination of trends in the following sub¬ 
problem areas: 

1* the sources of funds for the financing of all municipal 
services; 

2. the relationship between total municipal levies and assess¬ 
ments ; 

3* the relationship between revenue from taxation and the total 
revenue of rural municipalities; 

4. the ratio of school levies to total municipal levies; 

5. the nature of changes in the education mill rate in munic¬ 
ipal districts; 

6. the relationship between school tax levies and net farm 

income; 

7. the sources of revenue of Alberta school divisions; 

8. the variations in the mill rate for education through time 
and among divisions and counties; 

9. the increase in educational expenditures of municipal districts

10* the distribution of current expenditures in Alberta school 
divisions; 

lie the distribution and extent of debenture borrowings; 

12. the growth in the quantity and costs of school conveyance. 

I. GENERAL REVENUE OF MUNICIPAL DISTRICTS 

Since a large number of towns and villages have signed inclu¬ 
sion agreements with school divisions for school purposes* problems 
in the financing of rural education involve these urban units. It 
was not possible in all instances to separate composite data tabu¬ 
lated for divisions and counties among the rural and urban units 
involved. However* this did not constitute a serious problem; not 
only do the urban units concerned have many rural characteristics? 
but they have become a part of the fl warp tl and a woof u of rural edu¬ 
cation. However, since education is but one of the several local 
services to be financed, it was necessary to view it as a part of the 
general problem of municipal finance. For this reason* some attention 
was given to general trends in total municipal revenue. 

Sources of Municipal Revenue 

The major sources of municipal revenue are taxes and grants;, 
revenue for capital expenditures is derived largely from the sale of 
debentures and from provincial grants. Debenture sales were treated 
apart from current revenue. Table XLI supplies comparative data on 
the general revenue of municipal districts for the years 194V and

1956; corresponding data for other municipalities were included. Of 
a total revenue of approximately $15 million in 1947 rural munic¬ 
ipalities levied almost four-fifths by local taxation; the chief 
source was the land tax 0 By 1956 the total revenue of rural munic¬ 
ipalities had reached $37 million, while the local revenue from tax¬ 
ation was almost $25 million. However, government grants accounted 
for 29 per cent of the total rural revenue in 1956; this compared 
very favourably with the corresponding 22 per cent for city munic¬ 
ipalities. Thus rural municipalities were relatively better off in 
1956 than in 194V as far as revenue from grants was concerned. But 
this does not tell the whole story: ability to pay requires careful 
consideration. 

Attention has been given to income and population trends in 
the rural areas of Alberta as compared with urban centres* During 
the 194V-1956 decade rural population growth was largely static while 
urban growth was dynamic; average personal income for Alberta moved 
steadily upward during the same decade (194V-1956), while net farm in¬ 
come exhibited considerable instability. This meant that fewer people 
were paying a tax bill that had more than doubled since 194V, out of 
a net income that had increased but little. The variations in the per 
capita dollars of general revenue from taxation in Alberta municipal¬ 
ities from 194V to 1956 are shown in Table XLII. Relatively speak¬ 
ing a per capita tax bill of $V6.00 in rural municipalities, as com¬ 
pared with $72.00 in cities, on the basis of net income, consti¬ 
tuted a much greater divergence than actual numerical differences

would indicate. In spite of an eightfold increase in provincial 
grants, rural municipalities were in 1956 carrying a relatively 
greater tax load than in 1947; also, the tax load per capita was 
greater for rural than for urban municipalities* 

Total Municipal Levi es Related to Assessment 

It is somewhat misleading to attempt to compare tax loads 
based upon assessment, or upon current mill rates, either over time, 
or between two taxing units at a given point in time. However, since 
machinery for the equalization of assessment has been in existence in 
Alberta for a number of years, and, since several grants are paid on 
that basis, some validity can be attached to the relative revenue- 
producing ability of taxing units based upon assessment. Table XLIII 
supplies comparative data on the net total assessment and the total 
tax levy for various taxing units in Alberta for the years 1946 and 
1956. 

Total net assessment in rural municipalities was roughly 50 
per cent higher in 1956 than in 1946, while the total tax levy in 
1956 was more than double the 1947 figure—122 per cent higher. In 
the meantime, city assessment had more than tripled, town assessment 
had increased fourfold, and village assessment had increased by BO per 
cent: the corresponding increases in total levies were 274 per cent, 
31B per cent, and 126 per cent, respectively. It would appear on the 
surface that the total tax burden was, in 1956, substantially greater 
in cities, towns, and villages than in rural municipalities; however.

dynamic population growth accompanied by industrial expansion greatly 
increased assessments in urban taxing units. This broadened tax base 
tended to offset the substantial advances in total levies. 

It is quite evident that much the same quantity of land in 
rural municipalities was assessed 50 per cent higher in 1956 than 
in 1946 and produced more than double the 194& revenue. Thus the 
total levy represented a considerably higher proportion of the total 
assessment than was the case in urban municipalities. Data on quan¬ 
tities of improved farm land, assessment on personal property and 
improvements, and industrial taxation, although not subjected to pre¬ 
cise analysis in this investigation, would appear to bear out the 
above assertion.^ 

Proportion of Revenue from Taxation 

Direct levies on property assessments have always formed the 
major portion of local revenue available to rural municipalities; 
urban municipalities, on the other hand, have had other sources of 
revenue stemming from public utilities, rents and leases, licenses, 
fines, parking fees, and other minor sources. As a result, the pro¬ 
portion of total revenue from taxation has been particularly high in 
rural and village municipalities. Table XLIV indicates the propor¬ 
tions for the various types of taxing units in Alberta for the 1947- 
1956 decade. 

It has been noted that municipal districts and villages in 
Alberta have depended very heavily upon the land tax for a supply of

local funds, while town and city units have been able to tap less 
painful sources of revenue. Thus, while provincial grants have 
contributed a smaller proportion of total revenue in the latter 
units (Table XLI), there has been considerably less dependence 
upon the property tax. The advantages of this broader base for 
local revenue, particularly in periods of recession, are readily 
apparent. 


II. SCHOOL LEVY OF MUNICIPAL DISTRICTS 

There has been considerable concern from time to time in 
regard to the relative position of education. Increased grants, as 
well as greatly increased tax levies, have boosted the revenue of all 
municipal authorities. The education lew has moved steadily upward 
in response to the demand for increased services; but, the need for 
increased revenue for other services has been considerable also. An 
examination of data was made in order to determine the position of 
educational expenditures in relation to total municipal outlays of 
monies. 

Education Levy and Total Municipal District Levy 

A demand for more extensive local services accompanied the 
industrialization of Alberta. As a result, the education levy for¬ 
med a relatively smaller proportion of the total tax levy in rural 
municipalities in 1956 than it did two decades previously. Table 
XLV provides data to support this statement. 

In 1936 the education levy of municipal districts in Alberta

amounted to approximately $2 million out of a total levy of $2.8 
million; the proportion was 71 per cent. During the years the education 
levy moved steadily upward to reach $14 million in 1956, for a seven¬ 
fold increase; however, during the same period the total tax levy 
moved to $26.5 million, for more than a ninefold increase. By 1956 the 
education levy represented but 54 per cent of the total levy; this 
was a drop of 16 per cent over a period of twenty years. Thus while 
education received a rather rapidly increasing number of dollars from 
local taxation, it lost ground relative to the total number of dol¬ 
lars being raised by taxation for all purposes. This indicates the 
extensive development of other local services which compete with edu¬ 
cation for tax dollars. 

The Education Mill Rate in Rural Municipalities 

Variations in the mill rate among municipal units have been 
somewhat reduced in recent years through the avenue of equalization 
grants, but considerable differences still remain. As a result, 
analyses based upon either the median or average mill rate suffer 
somewhat in validity. Nevertheless, they do provide a crude measure 
of trends in the mill rate. 

Table XLVI records the median mill rate for the various taxing 
units in Alberta for the years 1946 and 1956. One very noticeable 
characteristic of the situation that existed in 1956 was the uni¬ 
formity that existed in the mill rate among all units—a variation of 
only 2.5 mills—as compared to a rather wide discrepancy of 7.2 mills 
for 1946. The data provided in Table XLVI indicate that the tax load

for education was considerably lighter in municipal districts in 
1946 than in other types of taxing units, while in 1956 it was 
slightly heavier. However, the education mill rate was 66 per cent 
higher in municipal districts in 1956 than in 1946 . This signifies 
a considerable increase in the tax load for education in rural areas. 

School Tax Levy and Net Farm Income 

The above analysis indicated an increase in the tax load for 
education between 1946 and 1956$ however, it did not take into con¬ 
sideration the ability to pay on the part of rural taxpayers. Since 
farm land constitutes the major proportion of the assessment of munic¬ 
ipal districts in Alberta, net farm income was used as a measure of 
ability to pay taxes. 

Table XLVII indicates the ratio of school levies to total net 
farm income for the two decades 1936-1956, The proportion was 11,3 
per cent in 1936$ by 1951 it had fallen to 2,6 per cent$ and, after 
continuing upward to 6.6 per cent in 1954? it levelled off to 5*4 per 
cent in 1956. The analysis indicates that, in terms of net farm 
income, the educational tax was twice as great in 1936 as in 1956. 

This measure disregards off-the-farm earnings of farm operators, as 
well as the earnings of non-farm wage earners$ however, if it can 
be assumed that these bore about the same proportion to net farm 
income for all years under review, the conclusions are not unduly 
distorted.. 

Table XLVIII provides comparable data on the ratio of total

school requisitions in Alberta to total personal income* In 1936 the 
school levy in rural municipalities represented 11 0 3 per cent of farm 
income (Table XLVII); the proportion for Alberta was 5*4 per cent. 
However, by 1941 the rural proportion had dropped to 4,4 per cent to 
approximate the ratio for the province as a whole. By 1956 the levy 
in municipal districts represented 5«4 per cent of net farm income; 
the corresponding proportion for Alberta was 4<>7 per cent. Thus in 
1956 the tax levy in municipal districts represented a somewhat lar¬ 
ger proportion of net farm income than the total tax levy bore to the 
total personal income for Alberta, 

III. THE REVENUE OF RURAL SCHOOL UNITS 

Consideration has been given to the sources and amount of 
annual revenue to municipal districts in Alberta, and to the shifts 
in the proportion of the total tax levy going to education. However, 
insofar as school revenue is concerned, the school unit, rather than 
the municipal unit, provides a more realistic basis for discussion; 
it was thus possible to view the composite revenue of all districts 
that operate within divisional and county units for school purposes. 

Sources of Revenue of School Divisions 

Total revenue to Alberta school divisions (counties) increased 
from $20 million in 1951 to almost $37 million in 1956 for an increase 
of 85 per cent. This was a sizeable amount; therefore, an analysis 
of its distribution has some significance. Table XLIX provides data

which indicate the distribution of revenue between local and pro¬ 
vincial sources* By 1951 provincial grants contributed million 
to the revenue of school divisions in Alberta; this was approx¬ 
imately one-third of the total* Requisitions provided fll # 5 million, 
or almost two-thirds of the total revenue. However, between 1951 
and 1956 provincial grants moved upward at a more rapid rate than 
did the total amount received by divisional boards from requi¬ 
sitions on municipalities. By 1955 slightly over one-half of the 
education revenue to divisional boards came in the form of provin¬ 
cial grants; and the following year the proportion was slightly 
higher. 

The data of Table XLIK suggest a recognition of the fact that 
the tax on land may have very nearly reached its limit as a source 
of revenue to rural school units of administration. In the first 
place, provincial grants to Alberta school divisions considerably 
more than doubled between 1951 and 1956, while local requisitions 
increased by only 30 per cent during the same period. Secondly, the 
yearly increase in provincial grants was not uniform* It was 
sharply accelerated during the period (1951-1956), particularly 
after 1953. The province, during this period, assumed much greater 
responsibility for building costs and excess enrolments; it also 
initiated a new type of assistance in the form of a $, tax reduction 11 
subsidy. The latter action was intended to stabilize requisition 
rates for school boards at 25 mills. This suggests that a 25 mill 
levy for school purposes was considered to be tt all the traffic \jould

bear.” The tax reduction subsidy amounted to more than $3 million 
in both 1955 and 1956* 


Average Basic Requisition Rates 

The tax reduction subsidy of 1955 did not meet the needs of 
all taxing authorities; as a result, it became necessary to ma.ke 
some provision for further assistance to those local units which 


could not meet the qualifying mill rate requirements* Therefore, 
a rider was attached which stipulated that: 


Any district or division that was unable or did not wish to 
qualify for the subsidy (tax reduction subsidy) was paid a grant 
equal to 30 per cent of any increase not exceeding 5 mills in 
the 1955 basic requisition rate over the 1954 rate. No limita¬ 
tion was placed on the overall mill rate increase in order to 
qualify for the grant* 2

year 1955o 

In 1953 the average basic requisition rate in divisions and 
counties was 28.6 mills: the following year it had reached 31.1 mills 
(30.7 for divisions and 34.5 for counties). The tax reduction regu¬ 
lation forced the rate downward to 23.9 mills in 1955. However, 
increasing costs to many local boards made it impossible for them to 
keep within the regulatory framework of the tax reduction provisions 

of 1955; rather, they chose to qualify under the supplementary pro- 

3 

viso previously referred to. As a result, the average basic requi¬ 
sition rate for divisions and counties was increased to 26.3 mills in 
1956. By I .957 the average rate for divisions was 28.5 mills, while 
that for counties was 30.2 mills. Thus the trend in the mill rate 
has continued sharply upward in spite of efforts toward stabilization.^ 

Divisional Mill Bates and Assessments 

It has been suggested that average mill rates do not have too 
much meaning because of the wide range betvreen upper and lower limits. 
Table LI provides more adequate data on trends in the mill rate for 
the latest three years for which information was available. In 1955> 
the year the tax reduction subsidy was introduced, only one divis¬ 
ion had a mill rate in excess of 26 mills, and all but four divisions 
ranged between 22 and 26 mills. By 1956 the picture had changed con¬ 
siderably: only 9 units fell in the 24-26 mill category, 7 fell below 
it, while 43 were above it—some well above it 0 A total of 12 units 
had an education levy above 30 mills in 1956; by 1957 a total of 29 
units fell in that category. Only 5 divisions had mill rates below

25 in 1957. Except for 5 divisions, the range in the rate was from 

26 to 3 S mills* 

The above analysis not only indicates the wide divergence in 
the mill rate among divisions, but underlines the sharp upward trend. 
In 1955 almost SO per cent of the total assessment in school divis¬ 
ions in Alberta fell in the 24 to 26 mill rate range; in 1956 almost 
one-half fell in the 26-30 range; and, by 1957, one-half the assess¬ 
ment fell in the 28-32 mill rate range. The relatively small in¬ 
crease in total assessment in rural areas in the face of sharp 
upward trends in educational expenditures has continued to force the 
mill rate upward. Generous increases in provincial grants have 
slowed the rate of increase in the mill rate, and have thus provided 
a partial solution to the problem. 

IV* EXPEKDITUBES OF MUNICIPAL DISTRICTS IN ALBERTA 

Rural municipal authorities in Alberta are directly respon¬ 
sible for a large number of local services, and, in addition, are 

required to meet the annual requisition for education, as submitted 

5 

by the divisional school boards* Expenditures for all types of local 
services have increased appreciably during the past twenty-five years 
in Alberta, and particularly so during the past decade. The two 
major items of expenditure have been education and roads* Until the 
advent of counties in Alberta, education enjoyed a preferred position 
among local services. Local school boards requisitioned municipal 
councils for their budgeted expenditures for education, and, except

in special circumstances, municipal councils had no choice but to 
pay the amount requisitioned by the board. Under the county system 
education was thrown into the "melting pot 11 along with other munic¬ 
ipal expenditures. Except for provincial grants "earmarked" for 
education, county funds are expended at the discretion of the coun¬ 
cil. The education committee, or any other committee of the council, 
has no assurance that all of the funds it requests will be provided. 

It is of significance to examine the trend in educational expen¬ 
ditures in relation to total expenditures in rural municipalities, 
and to observe the trends among the various types of rural and urban 
units. 

Education Expenditures and Total Municipal Expenditures 

The increasing costs of existing services, together with the 
provision of new services, have pushed municipal expenditures sharply 
upward in recent year's. Table LII summarizes the distribution of 
municipal district expenditures among education, public works, and 
"other" expenditures for the years 194? to 1956. Education represented 
approximately 38 per cent of total rural municipal expenditures in 
1947. By 1949 the proportion was 40.6 per cent: this was its high¬ 
est peak. From then on the proportion moved slowly but steadily 
downward to reach 36.4 per cent in 1956. Relatively speaking, edu¬ 
cational expenditures declined somewhat during the period. On the 
other hand, expenditures for public works, after a slight downward 
trend in the early years of the decade, moved steadily upward after 
1952 to reach 33.2 per cent of total expenditures. Other items of

expenditure amounted to a slightly smaller proportion of the total 
in 1956 than in 1947. Thus, while education received a growing expen¬ 
diture of funds, the relative proportion decreased somewhat after 1949. 

Relative Expenditures for Education Among Municipal Units 

It has been observed that the proportion of total expen¬ 
ditures going to education in rural municipalities has declined 
slightly during the past decade. In an effort to establish the gen¬ 
erality of the trend, an analysis was made of the expenditure pattern 
for the several types of municipalities in Alberta. 

Table LIII shows the proportion of total expenditures being 
used for education in city, town, village, and rural municipalities. 
Because of the multiplicity of services provided by cities, expen¬ 
ditures for education have always been relatively lower than in the 
other municipalities; on the other hand, small incorporated places, 
because of their compactness, have, in the past, spent a larger pro¬ 
portion of total expenditures on education than have rural or large 
urban units. This was the situation in 1947; the relative position 
was quite similar in 1956, except that counties surpassed villages 
in the proportion spent for education and municipal districts very 
nearly equalled the village ratio. The city proportion fell by 
almost 8 per cent during the interval (1947-1956); the proportion 
for towns lowered by 6 per cent, for villages 13 per cent, while the 
proportion of total expenditures used for education in municipal dis¬ 
tricts dropped by less than 5 per cent; and, in the space of six 
years the proportion of county expenditures used for education moved

upward by almost 5 per cent to reach 47 per cent in 1956. This was 
more than 12 per cent higher than for any other type of municipality. 

The above analysis suggests that relatively speaking the pro¬ 
portion of expenditures devoted to education has decreased less in 
rural municipalities than in urban units. Nevertheless, the fact 
remains that, except for county units, there has been a steady down¬ 
ward movement during the past five years in the proportions of expen¬ 
ditures for education. This indicates the effects of the institu¬ 
tion of new services, particularly in cities, which compete with 
education for tax dollars. 

Per Capita Expenditures of Municipal Units 

The problem of population scatter in rural Alberta has been 
emphasized throughout this dissertation; it has been intimated that 
the “quantity 11 of educational and other services required at a given 
time depends to a far less extent upon total population than is the 
case in more densely settled urban centres. Table LIV indicates, for 
the years 1947 and 1956, the distribution of expenditures among the 
various services provided and the per capita expenditures for munic¬ 
ipal units in Alberta. 

In response to the rapid increase in the need for larger 
quantities of services, resulting from rapid population growth, and 
to the demand for new types of services, total current expenditures 
by city and town municipalities increased fourfold between 1947 and 
I 956 —from #18 million to $70 million. During the same period the 
population of Alberta 1 s cities and towns almost doubled—322,000 in

194V and 635,000 in 1956. In the same interval current expenditures 
by municipal districts increased considerably more than twofold, even 
though the population increased by less than 10 per cento 

Between 194V and 1956 a major increase took place in the cap¬ 
ital borrowings of municipalities (Table LV). The inclusion in annual 
expenditures of these capital outlays financed out of debenture pur¬ 
chases makes a considerable change in the per capita expenditures for 
all services. It raises the per capita expenditures of cities from 
$119.00 to $17V.OO in 1956s on the other hand, the comparative figures 
for rural municipalities stood at $113.00 and #124.00, respectively. 
This indicates the magnitude of debenture borrowings in Alberta*s 
cities; in 1956 debenture borrowings amounted to approximately one- 
third of their total expenditures. 

Per Capita Expenditures for Education 

The per capita—total population—expenditures for education 
have, since 194V* been greater in rural than in urban municipalities. 
Table LV indicates the trends for the 194V-1956 decade. In 194V the 
difference was slight: by 1956 the per capita current expenditure for 
education was more than half as high again in municipal districts as 
in urban municipalities, and in county units it was more than twice 
as high. However, since provincial grants are included in the total 
current expenditures of municipalities, the actual per capita dollars 
going to education gives but a crude measure of the financial burden 
borne by the average taxpayer in each type of unit; however, it does 
underline the rapid increase in the per capita costs of education.

V. EXPENDITURES OF SCHOOL DIVISIONS AND COUNTIES 

The financing of rural education is but one of several aspects 
of rural municipal finance. For this reason, up to this point, edu¬ 
cational expenditures have been analyzed as a segment of total munic¬ 
ipal expenditures. The relative proportion of the total annual out¬ 
lays going to education has been given some attention, as have the 
trends in per capita expenditures for all services including edu¬ 
cation. This analysis took place within the financial framework of 
municipal district organization. The administration of schools and 
the annual expenditure of funds for education, however, transcend the 
bounds of municipalities, and the school division, school district, 
and county provide the framework within which to examine trends in 
educations,! finance. 

Trends in School Expenditures 

The increase in current expenditures for education in Alberta 
during the past decade has been great, as has been the program of 
reorganization that has accompanied the upsweep in spending for edu¬ 
cation. School divisions and counties have participated extensively 
in this educational revolution; and the end is not yet in sight. 

Table LVI supplies data on current expenditures for education 
and its distribution for school divisions and counties in Alberta for 
the past decade. In 1946 these rural units spent approximately #8.8 
million for all locally administered educational services: in 1956 
the amount was $33*9 million, or four times the 1946 expenditure.

Between 1952 and 1954 the increase amounted to more than $7 million, 
an amount almost equal to the total of current expenditures in 1946; 
although a slowing down in the rate of increase took place after 1954, 
the actual increase amounted to §4 million between 1954 and 1956* 

This analysis makes no allowance for large expenditures for new con¬ 
struction which added large sums to the debenture indebtedness of 
school divisions* 

The Distribution of School Expenditures 

Mhile the trends in current expenditures for education form 
a valuable yardstick of future trends, of even greater significance 
are the trends in the distribution of funds among the various major 
items of expense* The reversal of a relative downward trend means 
sharply increasing expenditures^ as long as the general trend con¬ 
tinues upward; the operation of relative upward trends for certain 
categories of expenditures results in a “freezing 51 of a larger pro¬ 
portion of future expenditures for education* Table LVII sets out 
the percentage distribution of school expenditures in divisions and 
counties in Alberta during the past decade* 

The advent of the larger unit of school administration in- 
Alberta in 1936 made possible a relative reduction in administrative 
costs* By 1946 this item amounted to only 3*4 per cent of total 
current expenditures; by 1952 the proportion was 2.5 per cent. The 
trend continued downward until 1954> after which it again moved upward 
to reach 2.5 per cent in 1956. The actual year to year increase in 
dollars spent was caused largely by the movement downward in the

purchasing power of the dollar. Administration is a relatively sta¬ 
tic item of educational expenditures in rural Alberta. 

Table LVII indicates that,although instructional costs increased 
threefold between 1946 and 1956, there was a relative decrease of 
more than 10 per cent. This merely means that teachers were receiving 
a smaller proportion of current expenditures for education in 1956 
than they were ten years earlier. It underlines the keen competition 
among educational services for a growing share of the tax dollar. 

The proportion of expenditures devoted to plant operation and 
maintenance was reduced from 15 per cent in 1946 to 12.8 per cent in 
1952 and then remained relatively constant for the balance'cf the dec¬ 
ade. This suggests a modest movement upward in dollars spent on 
operational costs, but a relatively constant ratio in relation to 
total expenditures. 

The costs of pupil conveyance doubled betvreen 1952 and 1956; 
during the same period, the relative proportion increased by 3*4 per 
cent. Perhaps even more significant was the 2.6 per cent increase 
between 1955 and 1956. Conveyance is a rapidly increasing expen¬ 
diture which in 1956 absorbed approximately one-fifth of the total 
current expenditures for education in Alberta*s school divisions and 
counties, and which, although necessary to the effective regrouping 
of educational services, by itself adds nothing to the quality of 
instruction. Conveyance costs, during the same period, were almost 
non-existent in urban school units. 

It was intimated earlier that local education authorities in

Alberta are permitted to finance capital costs out of current rev¬ 
enue: roughly 8 per cent of current expenditures had been spent in this 
way in 1946: in 1954 the proportion was approximately 10 per cent, and 
by 1956 it had been reduced to 5 per cent. The actual monetary 
decline was $1 million between 1954 and 1956. This does not signify 
a decrease in capital expenditures, by any means, but a drying up of 
the source through a diversion of funds to other items of current 
expenditure. The result was that a growing proportion of capital 
expenditures was financed through borrowings and the purchase of 
debentures. In 1956 capital borrowings in school divisions and coun¬ 
ties amounted to $3.7 million as compared to $1.7 million in cap¬ 
ital expenditures out of current revenue. Further treatment of the 
trends in capital loans is given later (Table LK). 

Annual payments on debt charges were largely non-existent in 
1946, comprising only 1 per cent of current expenditures. By 1956 
the proportion had grown to almost 8 per cent, and as an item of 
expenditure amounted to $2.6 million; however, this amount repre¬ 
sented a very small percentage of the actual indebtedness involved. 

This constitutes another instance of the H freezing M of a sizeable pro¬ 
portion of educational funds for the next two decades; meanwhile, the 
annual payments are being augmented by debenture purchases required 
to finance current building programs. 

Trends in Per Pupil Expenditures for Education 

Attention has been given in this dissertation to the general 
trends in school population in rural Alberta and to the general costs

of education* The relatively small increase in the enrolment of 
rural children has been somewhat supplemented by the inclusion of 
growing numbers of urban children in the divisional school pop¬ 
ulation. However, the sharp increase in annual expenditures 
suggests a high per pupil expenditure for education* 

Table LVIII provides data on per pupil current expenditures 
by local authorities in Alberta during the period 1941 to 1946, and 
for the years 1954> 1955 and 1956. The cost per year per pupil enrol¬ 
led in Alberta*s schools has risen fourfold over the past fifteen 
years; the relative increase, based upon average attendance, has 
been somewhat less. However, on both counts, the increase was sub¬ 
stantial. 

In 1941-42 it cost considerably less per year on the average 
to educate a pupil in a divisional school in Alberta than in a city 
school, and slightly less than in a town or a village school. By 
1946 there were but slight differences in the average cost per pupil 
in all types of schools; however, by 1954 the cost was 20 per cent 
greater in divisional than in city schools, and 50 per cent higher 
than in town and village units; by 1956 the ratios were 30 per cent 
and 55 per cent respectively* 

It must be kept in mind that in 1956 it would have cost a 
great deal more to provide the same educational services that were 
being provided in 1941; therefore, the entire increase in the cost 
per pupil in school divisions cannot be attributed to reorganization* 
However, the relative increase as between school divisions and

other types of school units can be attributed largely to the costs 
of more effective facilities and services that accompanied reorgan¬ 
ization. The growing burden of conveyance costs that accompanied 
the erection of larger attendance areas was partly responsible for 
the rapid rise in per pupil expenditure for education in Alberta 
school divisions ; also, larger attendance areas meant the scrapping 
of many existing classrooms and the erection of new ones. This 
further inflated the cost per pupil, as capital repayments became 
a steadily growing proportion of annual expenditures. In addition, 
teacher-pupil ratios remained lower in rural areas because of the 
difficulty of mustering sufficient pupils within a grade, or grade 
range, to seat an average classroom. This appreciably increased the 
cost of instruction per pupil, even though teachers* salaries were, 
on the whole, lower in rural areas than in large town and city 
schools. That reorganization has improved educational opportunity 
in rural areas is trues that it has significantly increased the cost 
per pupil educated is equally true. 

Since, in 1956, conveyance costs accounted for almost one-fifth 
of current educational expenditures in school divisions and counties 
in Alberta, some attention was given to the nature of the trends in 
conveyance services . 

Pupil Conveyance in Division s and Counties 

Some indication of the scope of the conveyance program in 
Alberta school divisions can be derived from an examination of its 
physical aspects. These data are provided in Table L1X.

Between 1952 and 1956 the daily run made by school busses 
increased by 50 per cent, as did the maximum number of pupils con¬ 
veyed and the total number of busses in operation. The added ser¬ 
vices increased actual costs from $3*6 million in 1952 to $6*5 
million in 1956 for an increase of almost 90 per cent. Contrib¬ 
uting fa.ctors to the sharp upward trend, in addition to the gen¬ 
eral expansion in services, were the provision of more adequate 
vehicles, more stops per route, additional feeder lines, and the 
drop in the purchasing power of the dollar. Ill of the trends 
analyzed point sharply upward and appear likely to remain in oper¬ 
ation for the immediate future® 

Fortunately for local education authorities in school divis¬ 
ions provincial grant schedules are so constructed that, from dir¬ 
ect conveyance grants and other grants based upon ^pupils conveyed 11 , 
the monies received amounted to a major proportion of total convey¬ 
ance costs. More detailed treatment is given this topic when pro¬ 
vincial grants are examined. 

The increase in the magnitude of conveyance services? toget¬ 
her with the extensive program of construction that has taken place 
in Alberta school divisions, have collectively been responsible for 
major increases in debenture indebtedness in recent years. Mention 
has been made of the dearth of funds for the financing of capital 
costs out of current revenue and of the mounting annual outlay of 
funds required to meet the Mue 11 payments of principal and interest 
on debentures and long term loans. Brief treatment was given to an 




225 


analysis of trends in debenture indebtedness l, not due" by divisional 
and other school units in Alberta; this item of expenditure is of 
major significance, since it constitutes a H fixed cost” in annual 
expenditures for education in the future* 

Trends in Not Due Debenture Indebtedness 

Although the total debenture debt of all school units in 
Alberta was considerable even before 1951* the annual increase since 
that year has caused a pronounced upward trend in the long-term 
indebtedness* Table IX indicates that the total in 1956 was almost 
two and one-half times that of five yeras earlier. In 1951* deben¬ 
ture borrowings by city units were almost double the total for all 
school divisions; also, the rate of increase was considerably 
greater for cities during the early years of the period. However, 
the annual increase for 1953-54 was very nearly $5 million in school 
divisions and only slightly over that amount in city units; between 
1954 and 1956 the increase in divisions was approximately $6 million 
as compared to $8 million in city districts. It is obvious that the 
purchase of debentures as a means of financing new-building programs 
has become a permanent part of the financial structure of rural edu¬ 
cation in Alberta, and that each year a growing proportion of future 
school expenditures is being Mortgaged 11 to meet annual repayments* 

VI* EDUCATIONAL SIGNIFICANCE 

The financing of rural education is but one part of the gen¬ 
eral problem of municipal finance. Major developments in other local

services, notably public welfare and rural roads, now offer keen com¬ 
petition to education in bids for tax dollars (Table LIV). Since 
rural municipalities have but minor sources of local revenue other 
than the tax on real property, there has been a steady upward trend 
in annual levies; however, large increases in grants from the pro¬ 
vincial treasury have formed an increasingly large proportion of 
total municipal revenue (Table XLI). All of this has taken place 
during a period of rather slow growth in tie total rural populat¬ 
ion of Alberta. The implication is that there is little direct 
relationship between population and expenditures for local services; 
a declining rural population could not be interpreted to mean a 
reduction in the 11 quantities' n of local services required (Table LIV). 

The per capita revenue derived from taxation was not signif¬ 
icantly higher in 1956 in municipal districts in Alberta than in the 
other municipalities (table XLII), However, ability to pay, as based 
upon trends in personal income, was lower in municipal districts, and 
increases in taxable assessment resulted to a much greater degree from 
higher valuations of existing property than was the case in towns and 
cities where much new assessment was created through business and 
industrial expansion (Table XLIII). The small amount of 11 newly cre¬ 
ated assessment” in rural areas poses a very real problem as tax 
levies increase. In recent years, provincial grants have tended to 
lower the proportion of municipal funds derived from taxation (Table 
XLIV) 0 Unless sources of revenue other than increases in the prop¬ 
erty tax can be made available to municipal districts, further increases

in provincial grants will be required to offset the continuing upward 
trend in educational and other local expenditures* 

Two decades ago education was the major item of expenditure of 
municipal districts in Alberta; however, the demand for additional ser¬ 
vices that accompanied mechanical and technological inventions soon 
made itself felt* As a result, educational expenditures, while rap¬ 
idly increasing, formed a much smaller percentage of total expen¬ 
ditures in 1956 than in 1936 (Tables Tables XLV and LIl)* This implies 
large increases in annual current expenditures resulting from a col¬ 
lective demand for a variety of services, and much keener competition 
among the several local services for a larger share of revenue dollars 
(Table LIIl). 

The median mill rate for urban school units has changed but 
little during the past decade, while that for municipal districts has 
moved sharply upward to become larger than that for any other type of 
taxing unit (Table XLVl). This sharp upward trend underlines the need 
for a close examination of the tax-paying ability of rural land owners. 

The ability of farmers to pay taxes depends upon the revenue- 
producing ability of land; net farm income expresses the financial pro¬ 
ductivity of land. By this yardstick the tax load for education 
declined significantly between 1936 and 1951, but then moved sharply 
upward (Table LVIl). The rather sporadic growth of farm income in the 
face of a steady upward trend in the annual school levy implies the 
need to give consideration to what constitutes a reasonable tax load 
in rural school units* The total education levy for Alberta forms

a somewhat smaller percentage of total personal income than the rural 
levy does of net farm income (Table XLVIII); this condition emphasizes 
the need for an examination of the ability of Alberta farmers to sup¬ 
port education and other local services. 

The rapidly expanding contribution by the provincial govern¬ 
ment in the form of grants suggests some concern for the revenue- 
producing ability of the rural economy: furthermore, it constitutes 
evidence of the fact that Albertans, through their elected repre¬ 
sentatives, are solidly committed to a program of extended support 
to education from provincial funds. Although the establishment of a 
qualifying mill rate in 1955 was probably not intended to suggest a 
maximum tax load for education, it was used to stabilize the local 
burden in some local authorities. Nevertheless, since 1955 the mill 
rate in many divisions and counties has again moved sharply upward 
(Table LI). The wide range in the mill rate among rural taxing units 
presents a very real problem in educational finance in Alberta. 

The distribution of educational expenditures among the services 
performed has shown considerable change during the past decade (Tables 
LVI and LVII). The general trend has been one which has annually rel¬ 
egated to the category of “constant 11 or “fixed* 1 costs a growing pro¬ 
portion of educational expenditures; and, “non-instruetional" costs 
have absorbed a growing proportion of operational costs* Debenture 
purchases constitute a sound business practice that has made possible 
rapid expansion in the provision of school buildings and equipment 
(Table XL); and conveyance is a necessary adjunct to reorganization

(Table LIX)<> However, the fact remains that these ’•fixed" annual 
expenditures have placed rural education in a very vulnerable finan¬ 
cial position in the event of a depression or a period of rapidly- 
falling farm income. This could very well result in the instruct¬ 
ional program receiving a decreasing proportion of educational expen¬ 
ditures. Such a condition would affect adversely the ’’quality” of 
rural education in Alberta. 

There is another significant aspect of long-term borrowing by 
local education authorities. The purchase of debentures represents 
delayed payments for accommodation and services already in use. This 
procedure ’’mortgages” future school expenditures by a rapidly increas¬ 
ing amount each year (Table XL). Pupils now in school, will, as tax¬ 
payers in the future, help to pay for schools in which they are being 
educated. This is only partially true in rural areas from which large 
numbers of young people migrate cityward for employment. Their earn¬ 
ing power and taxpaying ability are thereby transferred elsewhere. 

Also, their contribution to the economic and social life of the city 
to which they migrate is largely determined by the quality of instruct¬ 
ion they receive in rural schools. This underlines the ’’wider than 
local aspects” of rural education.

CHAPTER VIII 


RURAL EDUCATION AND CHANGE 

Problem 

The major question treated in this chapter is: Of what sig¬ 
nificance for the future is the changing pattern of rural education 
in Alberta? 

Sub-Problems 

This involved an examination of trends in the following sub¬ 
problem areas: 

1. the scope of academic course offerings; 

2. the scope of general electives, specialized commercial, 
and practical education courses; 

3. the enrolment of rural pupils in correspondence courses 
and their achievement therein; 

4. the operational pattern of high school instruction in rural 
Alberta; 

5* the nature and extent of the school building program; 

6. the distribution and qualifications of instructional per¬ 
sonnel; 

7* the effectiveness of the present instructional program. 

I. THE PROGRAM OF STUDIES 

In recent years a great diversification in school subjects has 
been introduced in Alberta schools. In addition to the traditional

academic subjects a variety of general and practical courses appear 
in the program of studies. Many of these courses are semi-vocational 
in nature and are intended for that segment of the school population 
which is not ‘'university bound," It is of some significance to an 
evaluation of the quantity of education provided in rural Alberta to 
examine the prevalence of such courses in schools attended by rural 
pupils,^ 

Choice of Academic Electives 

In all schools in Alberta in which high school training is pro¬ 
vided there are certain subjects (constants) which are compulsory: 

the balance of the academic program is selected from among the elec- 

2 

tives offered in a given school. Table IXI shows the rather limited 
choice available in non-urban high schools, particularly beyond the 
Grade X level; it indicates also the relative change in course offer¬ 
ings from 1954-55 to 1956-57, There were no appreciable gains during 
the period, and in several instances there was a moderate loss. Thus 
the variety of academic electives was slightly more restricted in 
1956-57 than in either of the two immediately preceding years. Data 
were not available except for the immediate past; however, the course 
offerings in 1954-55 suggest considerable improvement in the past 
decade, particularly since the large-scale reorganization of high 
school facilities. 

In 1954-55 there were 297 non-urban schools offering high 
school programs: by 1956-57 there were 355 such schools. The lack of

suitably trained teachers in language and science would appear to be 
the cause for the limited choice of academic electives being offered 
in non-urban high schools; the increase in teacher-supply did not 
keep pace with the increase in the number of schools offering high- 
school instruction*. 

Genera l Electives in Non-U rban Schools 

An examination of the variety of general electives being 
offered in non-urban schools reveals a very restricted program. It 
should be noted in this connection, however, that courses for which 
there were no requests are listed among those ”not offered” in a 
given year* This has been particularly true of courses in agri¬ 
culture: even those who advocate such courses apparently do so ”for 
the benefit of other people*s children.” 

Table LXII shows the numerical and percentage distribution 
of general electives among non-urban schools in Alberta. In only 
one instance--14athematics 11—was there a percentage increase in the 
number of schools offering the program, and in only three other cases 
was there a numerical increase between 1954-55 and 1956-57; these 
were Bookkeeping 10, Art 10, and Law 20. The short-term trend indi¬ 
cates a decrease in the demand for general electives or a shortage of 
instructional services and facilities. In many instances the latter 
condition would appear to be the deciding factor* It should not be 
assumed, however, that all electives should be offered in every school. 
Nevertheless, the present program appears unduly restrictive.

Choice of Electives in Specialized Commercial Courses 


The position of general electives is still not firmly estab¬ 
lished in the thinking of many parents, children, and some educators; 
commercial courses, on the other hand, have achieved wider acceptance 
and enjoy considerable prestige. 

The need for vocational training, particularly in business prac¬ 
tices, has previously been discussed at some length. Prospective far¬ 
mers, in order to be efficient in modern-day farming operations, 
require some elementary business training; farm wives with training 
in typewriting, bookkeeping, and secretarial duties are a decided 
asset to farm households; and, many office opportunities are avail¬ 
able to those young people with commercial training when they migrate 
to urban centres. 

In the light of the above need, it is of significance to note 
from Table LXIII that, with the exception of Typewriting 10, there are 
no commercial courses being offered widely among non-urban high schools. 
The proportion, in a few instances, improved somewhat bet\>reen 1954 and 
1957 ; however, in the latter year, there was, on the average, only one 
such course being offered per year per school. 

Practical Education Courses in Non - Urban Schools 

Home economics and "shops” courses have found wide acceptance 
in urban high schools in Alberta. At one time the need was greater 
in urban centres, since father ! s job was away from the home and mother 
spent less time in the home than her counterpart on the farm; to-day, 
however, few farm boys learn the ’'crafts’ 1 from father, and many farm

girls, because of preoccupations, receive but little training in house¬ 
hold management from mother. Furthermore, the mechanization of agri¬ 
culture calls for mechanically minded operators, as does a host of job 
opportunities in industry. 

Table LXIV sets out the numerical and percentage distribution 
of practical education courses in non-urban schools in Alberta which 
offer high school training. In most instances there was a proportionate 
and a numerical increase between 1955 and 1956 followed by a decline 
between 1956 and 1957. When it is observed that the number of non- 
urban high schools increased by twenty-four in the former period and 
by thirty-four during the latter period, it is apparent that the pro¬ 
blem of a supply of specialist teachers was considerably aggravated. 

The dearth of specialized training in elective academic and 
non-academic subjects provided in non-urban high schools in Alberta 
has been assessed; however, this does not complete the picture. There 
is annually a shortage of instructional services in all subjects in 
a number of schools. As a result, correspondence courses have been 
resorted to. 

Supervised Correspondence Study Centres 

A number of years ago there were numerous correspondence study 
centres in Alberta; by 1953-54 the number had shrunk to 163, of which 
only 67 were operating at the end of the term. This meant that during 
the year 96 teachers were placed in classrooms that had operated as 
study centres for a part of the year.

Table LXV provides data on correspondence study centres for 
the 1953-57 period* Only 23 centres were operating in June 1955; a 
year later only 13 centres were in operation* However, in September, 
1956, the number had risen to 55 of which 35 remained in operation all 
year* While the problem involves, ordinarily, small and isolated com¬ 
munities, a considerable number of school children is involved annually* 

Enrolment in Correspondence Courses 

It cannot be assumed that all persons enrolled for correspond¬ 
ence study are children; some are adults* Neither can it be assumed 
that all could conceivably be in school. In numerous instances iso¬ 
lation is an insurmountable factor, unless boarding accommodation 
away from home is acceptable to the parents concerned* 

Table LXVI indicates a considerable decline between 1953 and 
1956 in the number of elementary children enrolled for correspondence 
study, a more moderate decline in junior high school pupils during the 
same period, but a large increase in high school students so enrolled; 
this amounted to a 72 per cent increase during a four-year period* 

While some members of this latter group were adults who returned to 
high school study, the majority was made up of students in areas where 
school facilities were not available, or if available, not sufficient 
instructional services were provided for a complete high school pro¬ 
gram. It would appear that correspondence enrolments serve as a 
crude measure of the teacher shortage and of the unwillingness of 
teachers to accept positions in isolated areas.

244 


Pupil Achievement by Correspondence Study 

While some children do exceedingly well with correspondence 
study, the results, on the whole, have not been too impressive. Of 
the elementary pupils registered for correspondence study in 1955-56 
(Table LXVII), about 35 per cent was promoted, 20 per cent did not 
complete the program, and 45 per cent discontinued the courses to return 
to school; in the following year the ratios were quite similar* Thus 
while correspondence study has brought a certain degree of relief to 
a considerable number of elementary pupils, it has only partially 
solved the problem* 

Table LXVTII indicates the distribution of the enrolment of 
high school students in correspondence courses between 1953 and 1956* 

The number of ’’drop-outs" each year was considerable, amounting to 
about 15 per cent of the total enrolled in 1953-54 and slightly over 
20 per cent in 1956-57; and many of those who continued the courses 
throughout a given year did not re-enrol. On the other hand, some 
highly intelligent and ambitious children have taken their entire school 
training through the avenue of correspondence courses* 

II. CHANGING NEED AND SCHOOL ACCOMMODATION 

Considerable attention has been given to the nature of edu¬ 
cational reorganization in rural areas in Alberta during the past 
quarter of a century. The extent of the change provides a clue to its 
possible duration* If reorganization is very nearly complete, the 
financial future of rural education could change considerably* An

analysis of high schools by size and classroom use was selected as 
a rough yardstick of the extent of progress in reorganization. 

Number and Distribution of High School Classrooms 

Since 1950 the number of high-school classrooms in Alberta*s 
school system has increased by 40 per cent to move from 1,031 to 
1,470. Table LXIX records the distribution of high school rooms 
according to the sizes of schools, "Other high schools" include all 
except city schools: this inflates the divisional high schools to the 
extent of the total number of rooms in high schools in independent 
town and village districts. 

In spite of the development of central high schools in rural 
Alberta in recent years the number of one-room high school depart¬ 
ments has not been reduced. The number of such schools dropped from 
95 in 1950-51 to 60 in 1954-55? and then moved sharply upward to 107 
in 1956-57, Two-room high school departments decreased in number 
from 83 to 76 during the period; three-room departments increased 
from 47 to 74; and schools with four or more high school rooms moved 
in total classrooms from 282 to 451 for a 60 per cent increase. 

The increase in the number of small high school departments 
during the past decade has resulted from the extension of the high 
school program to the more scattered centres of population in rural 
Alberta; previously high school opportunities were available only to 
those pupils who undertook studies in multi-grade classrooms or who 
attended urban high schools by boarding away from home or by special 
transportation arrangements. The increase in the number of larger 
high schools resulted from the recent reorganization program^

In contemplating the degree of reorganization already attained 

3 

the question arises: ”How small is too small?’ 1 It appears that in 
low density areas in Alberta that a four-room high school is the 
upper limit of growth; and in some areas it will not be possible to 
eliminate even smaller high schools unless dormitory accommodation 
is resorted to, and that does not seem desirable ^ If schools of 
four or more classrooms are considered adequate, then reorganization 
of high school facilities was in 1956-57 about the halfway mark. 

In 1956-57 there were 512 one-room schools in operation in 
rural areas.** Many of these were in isolated communities far removed 
from centralized school facilities. The task of closing out one- 
room schools would appear to be drawing to a close. However, there 
is still a large amount of consolidation going on at the elementary 
level, with numerous small schools being discarded in favor of larger 
units. 

The Present Building Program 

The problem of supplying the actual physical accommodation 
required to house a growing school population has been most acute in 
Alberta during the past decade. Although the greatest population growth 
has taken place in urban centres, particularly in the larger towns and 
cities, the problem has been no less acute in rural areas. In the former 
centres it was possible to make use of existing facilities in the pro¬ 
gram of expansion and reorganization, while in rural areas it was often 
necessary to scrap existing facilities as reorganization progressed. 





250 


Table LXX provides data on new school accommodation since 
1950 for school divisions and counties in Alberta. The total building 
program has remained relatively steady during most of the period 
with a sharp trend upward in 1955, particularly with reference to 
gymnasia. The number constructed in 1956 more than doubled the number 
in any other year during the period; also, the number of general class¬ 
rooms was 20 per cent greater in both 1955 and 1956 than at any 
other time during the period. 

Evidence that the building boom in school construction in 
divisions and counties in Alberta has not subsided is provided by 
data on the amount of new construction underway. During the January- 
September period, 1957, there were 887 classrooms (Table LXX), 109 
gymnasia, and a total of 153 special rooms under construction in 
Alberta*s school divisions and counties. There is no evidence to 
suggest a tapering off in the school building program in rural 
Alberta within the immediate future. 

The Distribution of Grades by Classrooms 

Two decades ago it was not uncommon to find eleven or twelve 
grades of pupils being taught in a single classroom; ten grades were 
quite customary. The task of the teacher in the one-room school was 
difficult indeed, even in the days of the three R*s: the broadened 
curriculum of today makes it next to impossible. 

Table LXXI provides data on the distribution by grades of 
the operating classrooms in counties and divisions in Alberta during

the period 1950-51 to 1956-57, The number of classrooms in which 
only elementary grades were taught almost doubled during the period. 
In 1951 elementary classrooms made up one-third of the total; in 
1956 such classrooms made up more than one-half the total. During 
the same period the number of classrooms in which elementary and 
junior high school (grades I to IX) pupils were accommodated was 
reduced by two-thirds. This group represented one-third of all 
classrooms in divisions and counties in 1951 but only one-eighth 
in 1956. All-grade classrooms were largely eliminated in Alberta 
prior to 1950, The fourteen which remained in operation in 1956 
were in isolated areas where the school enrolment was small; their 
continuance appears inevitable. 

Junior high school rooms more than doubled between 1951 
and 1956 to reach a total of 881 in the latter year; junior-senior 
high school rooms were reduced by 40 per cent; and senior high school 
rooms almost doubled. This trend toward fewer grades per classroom 
was a result of the reorganization of attendance areas in rural 
Alberta, 

In light of the data (Table LXX) relating to the construction 
of classrooms, it is rather surprising to note from Table LXXI that 
there were only 500 more classrooms operating in 1956-57 than in 
1950-51, This means that of the 1,860 new classrooms constructed 
during the period, 1,360 were replacements for closed out classrooms.

III. INSTRUCTIONAL NEEDS IN RURAL EDUCATION 

The staffing of rural schools has always presented a problem. 

In times of economic depression the problem has been somewhat reduced; 
in good times it has been severely aggravated. The movement of personnel 
out of teaching which accompanied World War II continued during the 
prosperous years that followed. Particularly hard hit were rural 
areas, since many teachers shifted from rural to urban schools to 
meet the instructional needs in rapidly growing urban centres. 

The Distribution of Teachers in Alberta 

The changes that have taken place in the number of teachers in 
various types of school units in Alberta during the past two decades 
are recorded in Table LXXII. The total number of teachers employed 
increased by 50 per cent during the period to reach 9,273 in 1956-57: 
during the same period the total for cities and towns doubled, while 
the total of teachers employed in divisions and counties increased 
by only 50 per cent. It must also be kept in mind that, during the 
period, considerable numbers of teachers were shifted from town and 
village to divisional classification through the avenue of inclusion 
agreements; otherwise the relative increases would have shown still 
more divergent trends. 

Between 1954 and 1956 the total number of teachers in Alberta 
increased by 1,000. Well over half of the increase took place in 
city and town units; the increase in divisions was less than two 
hundred. However, the relatively light demand for an overall in-

crease in the total number of teachers required in rural areas was 
considerably aggravated by a flow of teachers toward the larger centres. 

The Qualifications of High School Teachers 

The instructional program being offered within a school system 
determines the excellence of the training required by instructional 
personnel; and the excellence of the training of the personnel avail¬ 
able determines, to no small degree, the quality of the program. 

Although qualifications alone do not guarantee good teaching, the odds 
are sufficiently high that gradations in salaries are largely dependent 
upon "years of training," 

Table LXXIII shows the distribution of high school teachers in 
Alberta according to qualifications for the years 1951-52 and 1956-57. 

In the latter year about 15 per cent of urban teachers (high school) 
held masters* degrees or higher; the ratio for rural schools was 
slightly over 5 per cent. The proportion of teachers with bachelors* 
degrees was in 1956 over 70 per cent for urban schools and slightly 
over 60 per cent for rural schools. Relatively there was but little 
change in the distribution of degree teachers between urban and rural 
schools during the period. Over 80 per cent of non-degree teachers 
engaged in high school teaching were found in rural schools at the 
beginning as well as at the end of the period. This analysis indicates 
a considerable disproportion in the qualifications of instructional 
personnel as between urban and rural districts. 

It was difficult to assess the effects of the quality of instruc¬ 
tion: it involves "drop-outs" during the year at each grade level,

failures at the end of the year, and the standing of students who obtain 
certificates, in addition to restrictions in the non-measurable aspects 
of education* 

Frequency Count for Grad e IX Examinations 

An analysis of the frequency count for Grade IX examinations in 
1957 afforded a crude measure of the accomplishment of rural students* 
Only 2.4 per cent of rural students came in ’’honors’ 1 as compared with 
5»1 per cent of urban students: 14#6 per cent of rural students was 
’’failures” as compared with 9#9 per cent of urban students* The 
proportion of ’’pass” students was 83 per cent for rural and 85 per 
cent for urban* Table LXXIV supplies the data. Since other factors 
also affected the above results, the differences cannot be attached 
entirely to the quality of classroom instruction* It can be said, how¬ 
ever, that at the Grade IX level urban schools functioned considerably 
more effectively than did rural schools* 

IV. EDUCATIONAL SIGNIFICANCE 

There is less difference among the types of employment opportun¬ 
ities open to rural and urban young people in Alberta today than 
there were twenty-five years ago. Increased facilities for population 
movements have made the province one large community as far as 
mobility of workers is concerned* Even those young people who remain 
on the farm have need for a type of training not too unlike that required 
by machine operators, business managers, and supervisory personnel in

other fields of endeavour. All of this has required a much more 
diversified high school program than formerly existed. But the imple¬ 
mentation of this program in rural areas has created a very real 
problem. 

The choice of academic electives is still confined to very 
narrow limits in non-urban high schools (Table LXl); the choice of 
general electives is similarly restricted (Table LXII); and in the 
fields of specialized commercial courses and in practical education 
courses only limited progress has been made (Tables LXIII and LXIV), 

Non-urban high schools in Alberta, in most instances, offer 
a bare minimum of courses. While the extension of even a minimum 
program of high school training to rural areas is a considerable 
accomplishment, the need for further development is apparent. 

Correspondence study has provided a means of extending educ¬ 
ational training to children living in isolated areas where organ¬ 
ized school facilities cannot be provided; however, this form of 
training does not provide an entirely satisfactory substitute. The 
appointment of correspondence study supervisors in school districts 
which would normally provide the services of a teacher indicates an 
actual shortage of teachers or an unwillingness of teachers to accept 
positions in isolated areas (Table LXV). In either event, a solution 
to the problem will involve an expenditure of more dollars for education. 
In the meantime, most of the children involved are rather seriously 
handicapped. 







261 


Correspondence courses, at the high school level, have been 
provided for considerable numbers of students in rural Alberta (Table 
LXVT). In many instances, students in regular attendance at school 
enroll for one or more electives which are not provided in the school 
which they attend,. The procurement of specialist teachers constitutes 
a very real problem in small high schools* In many instances the 
provision of these services will involve the setting up of many more 
•‘circuits.*’ This will mean considerable additions to existing instruc¬ 
tional services and to conveyance and accommodation for ’’circuit” 
teachers. However, the present situation constitutes a considerable 
’’gap” in educational opportunity in the areas concerned. 

While the examination results of pupils undergoing instruction 
by correspondence study have been reasonably satisfactory (Tables 
LXVII and LXVIII), it can hardly be said that this type of schooling 
meets the educational needs of even the most successful candidates 
in departmental examinations. In a period of ever-increasing social 
relationships it is difficult to justify ’’education in isolation.” 

The real need is for adequate instruction, coupled with associations 
with peers, whenever it can be made possible. 

More than half of the non-urban high schools in Alberta are 
of less than four rooms (Table LXIX). In spite of the major program 
of reorganization that has been in progress for more than a decade, 
the number of small units is actually increasing. This suggests that 
under the present pattern of reorganization many rural units must, of 
necessity, be small. In such instances the provision of adequate

instructional services presents a very real problem; it involves high 
teacher costs per pupil and the duplication of expensive facilities 
and equipment. 

The planning of school facilities has, in many ways, been 
more difficult in rural than in urban centres where useable facilities 
are known and new requirements can be projected into the future with 
some degree of accuracy. In rural areas the building program depends 
not so much upon aggregates of children as upon the pattern of reorgan¬ 
ization, Short-term planning has often rendered obselete within a 
few years facilities that might ordinarily be useable for a consider¬ 
able period of time. This duplication has proved expensive and has, 
in many instances, delayed the progress of centralization. 

The changing needs of education have expressed themselves, 
not only in the reorganization of facilities, but in the develop¬ 
ment of facilities for the provision of a more diversified program. 

The number of general classrooms being constructed gives a rough 
measure of reorganization: the number of ancillary rooms forms a 
rough measure of the diversification of the school program (Table LXX). 
There would appear to be little reason to anticipate other than a 
continuing upward trend in the building program in school divisions 
and counties in Alberta during the next decade or so. The moderate 
increase between 1950 and 1956 in the number of operating class¬ 
rooms (Table LXXI), compared with the new classrooms constructed dur¬ 
ing the same period (Table LXX), indicates that more than two-thirds 
of the new construction was for the replacement of discarded classrooms.

rather than to accommodate larger numbers of pupils. It is obvious 
that the school building program in rural Alberta is dependent only 
to a minor degree upon the number of pupils to be educated. 

The number of additional teachers required annually in 
divisions and counties in Alberta has not been large (Table LXXII). 
However, if instruction is to improve in quality (Table LXXIV), and 
in the variety of courses offered (Tables LXI to LXIV), there is 
need, not only for more teachers, but for better qualified ones. In 
1956 the average salary paid in school divisions in Alberta was almost 
as high as in city districts (Tables LX'XVIII), but teachers in city 
high schools were, on the average, much better qualified (Table LXXXIII). 
It appears evident that the quality of instruction available in city 
schools cannot as readily be provided in rural schools. It also 
appears that the problem is largely financial in nature.

CHAPTER DC 


THE FINANCIAL IMPACT OF CHANGE 


Problem 

The major question treated in this chapter is: VJhat has been 
the impact of economic and demographic trends in rural Alberta dur¬ 
ing the past twenty-five years upon the financing of education in 
the decade ahead? 

Sub-Problems 

This involved an evaluation of the combined effects resulting 
from a convergence of trends in the following sub-problem areas: 

1. trends in school enrolments in accordance with projected 
population changes; 

2* trends in the teacher-pupil ratio in school divisions; 

3* trends in the teaching force based upon projected pupil 
enrolments;

I. ASPECTS OF THE RURAL PROBLEM 

Most recent studies in Canada and the United States which 
have been devoted to problems of educational finance have treated 
the total problem for a province, a state, or a nation. In such 
instances the impact of population growth looms large; the number 
of dollars required to provide future "quantities of education" 
sufficient for the needs of a growing multitude of school-age chil¬ 
dren can be assessed on the basis of projected population statistics. 
However, the problem changes when its rural aspects are isolated and 
subjected to individual examination. Here dynamic population growth 
gives way to a relatively static condition; and yet educational costs 
continue to move rapidly upward in rural areas, but from causes that 
are not as readily measurable as the impact of population growth. 

An intimation of the differing nature of the urban and rural 
problems was given in a recent work by Dr. M. E. Lazerte. He had 
this to say; 

Population data tell something about the number of schools 
and the total services to be provided. The rate of growth is

a key to present and probable future classroom needs . . . . 
Density of population determines the number of students that 
will be educated per classroom and tells something of the 
problems to be encountered if schools are to be centralized 
and transportation provided. The size of families and age- 
group populations are positively correlated with the cost of 
education. The vocations of wage earners are likely to 
determine to some degree the age at which children discon¬ 
tinue their schooling and should affect types of curriculum 
provided .... The ratio of rural to urban population 
affects teachers 1 salaries, teachers' certification and the 
extent of the teacher shortage. Teacher shortage tends to 
be aggravated in sparsely settled rural areas .... 1 

Although Lazerte was referring to the general problems of 
education, he very nicely pinpointed the major factors which affect 
the financing of rural education: the number of students per class¬ 
room, centralization, conveyance, school-age population, retention 
in school, the vocations of wage earners, the curricula provided, 
teachers' salaries and certification, and the effects of isolation* 
Each of these has been given some treatment in this dissertation: 
the possible effects of each upon the future costs of rural edu¬ 
cation were then evaluated. 


Ho TEACHER SUPP3Z 

Some indication of the inadequacy of the supply of teachers 
in Alberta school divisions and counties was given earlier in con¬ 
nection with teacher qualifications among different types of school 
units in Alberta; a shortage was intimated, particularly of spec¬ 
ialist teachers, when course offerings were analyzed; and, a review 
of correspondence-study enrolments gave further evidence of the 
shortage. These analyses led to the assumption that there is need

for more and better qualified teachers in rural school units in 
Alberta: they also indicated that the proportion of highly qual¬ 
ified teachers is greater in urban than in rural units, particularly 
at the high school level, and that the quality of instruction has 

affected adversely the attainment of students at the high school 

3 

level in rural schools. 

Teacher-Pupil Ratio 

Class sizes are much more difficult to regulate in rural areas 
than in large urban centres. This was particularly true before 
reorganization; it has proved almost equally true since reorgan¬ 
ization. The density of the rural population in many areas rules 
against the setting up of attendance areas which contain sufficient 
numbers of children for the working out of the most effective class¬ 
room loads from the standpoint of numbers. If there is one grade 
per classroom, the teacher-pupil ratio is low and instruction is 
unduly expensive; if classes are combined, the quality of instruct¬ 
ion is likely to suffer, and particularly so at the high school level. 

The data contained in Table L&XV indicate that there has been 
but little change in the teacher-pupil ratio in Alberta school divis¬ 
ions in recent years in spite of the extensive program of reorgan¬ 
ization that has taken place. The closing of rural schools of small 
enrolments did not have the anticipated effect upon average class 
sizes; however, it did distribute the pupil population more evenly 
and greatly reduced the number of multi-grade classrooms®

The recent increases in the total number of teachers employed 
in school divisions and counties has not been great—slightly over 
1,100 between 1949-50 and 1956-57* During the same period the number 
of pupils enrolled increased by 17,000. This constituted a teacher- 
pupil ratio of 1:17 for the increase, as compared with 1:23 for the 
total enrolment in 1956-57o This is illustrative of the slight down¬ 
ward trend in teacher-pupil ratio. 

Projected School Enrolments in School Divisions 

The task of making school enrolment projections is extremely 
hazardous. It is even more hazardous to attempt to estimate the 
future enrolment of pupils in Alberta divisions and counties, not 
only because of rural to urban migration trends which tend to reduce 
the school population, but also because of the continuing implemen¬ 
tation of inclusion agreements which tend to raise it. Furthermore, 
school enrolments depend upon total population figures; thus, if 
total population estimates are available, it is comparatively simple 
to arrive at an approximation of the school population. Several 
estimates of the total population of Alberta have been made during the 
past few years, but similar estimates of the future rural population 
or of the population included in rural school divisions are not in 
existence.^ 

Table ISXVI provides an estimate of the population of Alberta 
living outside independent urban school districts. The figures for 
1961, 1966, and 1971 were arrived at by projecting trends in the rural

farm and rural non-farm population, as well as those of towns and 
villages, since most of these are now included in school divisions 
and counties. A considerable proportion of the increase in the pop¬ 
ulation of Alberta living outside independent urban school districts, 
particularly for the years from 1946 to 1956, resulted from inclusion 
agreements; however, since there is only a limited number of towns and 
villages operating independent school systems at the present time, a 
modified downward trend in the rate of increase from this source was 
assumed* furthermore, it was assumed that the downward trend in the 
rural population living on farms will tend to be offset by a substan¬ 
tial increase in the non-farm population of rural areas. 

The relatively large proportion of school children in the 
rural population which has resulted from the migration of young wage- 
earners will tend to diminish, since many potential rural parents 
have become city residents during the past decade; thus, while the 
rural population will continue to have a preponderance of school- 
age children, the actual proportion will be somewhat reduced. On 
the other hand, large families among tbs;growing rural non-farm popula¬ 
tion will tend to force the proportion upward. 

On the basis of current population predictions, and, in view 
of the above trends, it was estimated that the school population in 
divisions and counties in Alberta will reach 126,000 by 1961, and 
141,000 by 1971. These were the figures used for determining future 
educational needs and costs.

The Teaching Force Based on Projected Enrolments 

It has been intimated earlier that the teacher-pupil ratio 
has remained relatively constant in school divisions in Alberta, 
but that for the promotion of instructional efficiency a lover ratio 
is desirable if the number of multi-grade classrooms is to be fur¬ 
ther reduced. Consideration vas also given to the possibility that 
through more extensive reorganization the teacher-pupil ratio might 
be raised. In viev of these possibilities, the present ratio (1:23) 
vas used along vith ratios of 1:21 and 1:25 in making estimates. 

Table IXXVII sets out the projected teacher requirements 
resulting from the projected school population by an application of 
the three selected ratios. The indications are that the actual 
numerical increase in teachers will be about one hundred per year. 
Hovever, this amounts to a substantial increase, on the basis of the 
present ratio, for the fifteen year period betveen 1956 and 1971— 
4,800 in 1956 and 6,400 in 1971. It could very veil be considerably 
raised or lowered if the teacher-pupil ratio shifted upward or down¬ 
ward during the period, or if economic conditions caused changes in 
the rate of movement of the rural population to urban places 0 

III. TRENDS IN TEACHERS* SALARIES: 

The Financial Position of Divisional Teachers 

Twenty years ago when the first divisions in Alberta were 
established, there was a wide margin of difference in the salaries 
paid in various types of school units in Alberta. The data recorded

in Table IXXVIII indicate that divisional teachers, in 1938-39, 
received less than one-half the average salary received by city 
teachers, and considerably less than teachers in villages and in 
consolidated school districts* The situation improved rapidly dur¬ 
ing the following decade, and then continued to improve at a more 
moderate rate, until by 1956-57 the average salary of divisional 
teachers reached $3>534»00 to come within less than $500*00 of the 
average for city teachers* Actually, if the salaries of a number 
of highly paid specialists in city systems, which have no parallel 
in divisions, are excluded from the total salaries paid in cities, 
the divisional average approximates the urban average* 

It has been observed that rural areas are not yet attracting 
sufficient numbers of highly qualified teachers and that there is a 
rural to urban movement of teachers* Further salary increases will 
be required as a partial solution to the problem* Before consider¬ 
ing the possible extent of such increases, some attention was given 
to the relationship between teachers* salaries in school divisions 
and the average earnings per member of the labour force in Alberta. 

Table IXX3X indicates the average income per worker and the 
average salary for teachers—in current and constant dollars—for 
the period 1936—1956; it also supplies an index of increase based 
on 1936 salaries. In 1936 teachers enjoyed a preferred position 
salary-wise; this continued, but with a downward trend, until 1941* 
when the rapid wage increases that came with World War II left 
teachers far behind. Measured in 1956 dollars, the average income

per worker more than tripled in the twenty-year period between 1936 
and 1956, while in the latter year teachers 1 salaries were consider¬ 
ably less than the average wages per member of the labour force* 

The mobility of the present-day population makes it readily 
apparent that many young people, who might otherwise choose teaching, 
as a matter of course, will choose more remunerative lines of endeav¬ 
our. There is keen competition for services ; the advantage lies in 
the direction of higher income and urban living. 

Projection of Teachers 1 Average Salaries 

It is apparent from the preceding analyses that, not only 
must the present rate of increase in teachers® salaries be main¬ 
tained, but a sharper upward trend is desirable, if the instruct¬ 
ional needs of rural pupils are to be met. Table LHJ indicates the 
rate of increase for divisional teachers by five-year periods from 
1931 to 1956, with yearly increases from 1951 to 1956. After a modest 
increase of 5 per cent during the 1931-1936 period, there was a slight 
decline during the following period (in 1956 dollars). During the 
next three five-year periods the increases were 24*8 per cent, 20.5 
per cent, and 23.6 per cent respectively. 

It is apparent that increases of more than 20 per cent per 
five-year period will be required to “hold the line 11 , and to counter¬ 
act increases in the consumer-price index; to restore teachers® sal¬ 
aries to the preferred position of the pre-war years will entail a 
somewhat higher initial rate of increase which could later taper off

in line with proportionate increases in the average income for the 
labour force. 

Table L5QCKI projects teachers* annual average salaries on the 
basis of several selected rates of increase. The first two rates— 

5 per cent and 10 per cent—-would be inadequate except in the case 
of a “plateau 11 in the economy and a downward trend in the consumer- 
price index; a 15 per cent increase would fail to keep teachers* 
salaries in line with the average earnings per member of the labour 
force; a 20 per cent increase would serve to close somewhat the gap 
between divisional and urban salaries for teachers; and, a 25 per cent 
increase, per five-year period, would restore teachers* salaries to 
a preferred position well above the average income anticipated for 
the labour force. Although all increases are projected without any 
tapering off, it is assumed that by 1971, or even earlier, a general 
levelling off might well set in. 

Projected Expenditures for Teachers * Salaries 

Table I22XII indicates total annual expenditures for teachers* 
salaries in Alberta school divisions and counties according to selec¬ 
ted percentage increases and according to different teacher-pupil 
ratios. At one end of the scale a “rock-bottom low 18 in periodic per¬ 
centage increases and a high teacher-pupil ratio ( 1 : 25 ) would cost 
$18 million in 1961 as compared with an expenditure of $15.6 million 
in 1956; at the upper end of the scale, the annual expenditure v/ould 
approach $26 million in 1961. The corresponding estimates for 1971

are $22.6 million and $45 million respectively. Whether or not the 
latter figure is unrealistic will depend upon economic conditions 
within Alberta and the emphasis placed upon adequate instructional 
services. Any appreciable improvement in the qualifications of 
teachers would necessitate greatly increased expenditures for tea¬ 
chers* salaries even on the basis of present schedules. 

Projected Current Expenditures in School Divisions 

The percentage composition of the total expenditure pattern 
of school divisions and counties in Alberta is quite different from 
that of cities, towns, or other independent school districts. Con¬ 
veyance costs loom large in the annual cash outlay; the replacement 
of facilities has been very costly, since the disposal value of 
"scrapped buildings" is insignificant; also, the low teacher-pupil 
ratio resulting from population scatter has significantly raised the 
educational cost per pupil in rural areas. In 1956-57 the teacher- 
pupil ratio in city and independent town schools was almost ls28, 
while in school divisions it was 1 ? 23 ; as a result of this, along 
with the other special costs, particularly conveyance, the cost per 
pupil enrolled was #296.00 in school divisions, as compared with 
$ 223.00 in city schools, and $193.00 in town and village schools, 
uhen the quality of instruction is considered, together with the 
nature of school facilities and course offerings, it is apparent that 
school education costs appreciably more for considerably less "quality" 
in rural areas than in the larger urban centres of Alberta. It is

quite obvious that any improvement in the quality of rural education 
is a costly undertaking. In view of this the projections which fol¬ 
low are perhaps not too unrealistic. 

Table IXXXIII portrays the relationship between teachers* sal¬ 
aries and other current expenditures in school divisions in Alberta 
for the years 1941 to 1956. The rapidly falling proportion after 
1946 was due largely to conveyance and capital costs connected with 
reorganization, and to a slowing down in the rate of increase in the 
salaries of teachers. It is estimated that the ratio will be little 
different in 1961 than in 1956, but that in later years, providing 
salaries move upward in line with previous estimates, the propor¬ 
tion will move upward to approach 55 per cent in 1971. This pro¬ 
jection is based on the assumption that there will be a levelling 
off in school construction and in new conveyance after 1966| how¬ 
ever, annual debt charges on. previously constructed buildings will 
continue to be a large item of annual expenditures. Annual payments 
for conveyance and for the replacement of conveyance equipment will 
also tend to keep ^other 1 * operating expenditures at a high level* 

Table LXXKIV sets out various projections for the total 
current expenditures of school divisions and counties in Alberta 
for the years 1961 and 1971. It appears quite probable that there 
will be but little change in the teacher-pupil ratio. If this is 
so, current expenditures in 1961, including repayments of deben¬ 
tures, would range between #43 million and #51 million, depending 
largely upon increases in teachers* salaries; if the teacher-pupil

ratio increases, considerable savings could be effected* 

Projections for 1971 range from $41 million to $81 million. 

It is not assumed that fully "adequate" services will be achieved, 
nor that "education" will be "starved." The provisions of average 
services would range between $57 million and $66 million. This is 
a doubling of the total expenditures for 1956 ($31 million) in a 
space of fifteen years, and represents a yearly increase slightly 
greater than that between 1956 and 1957. 

Projected Cost Per Pupil E ducated in Sc hool Divisions 

In 1956 the cost per pupil in school attendance in school 
divisions was 276 dollars as compared with 208 dollars in city dis¬ 
tricts and 188 dollars in town and village districts. Thus in that 
year five pupils in towns and villages, and four city pupils could be 
kept in school for the same expenditure of funds required for three 
pupils in school divisions. 

Table LXXXV shows projected costs per pupil for 1961 and 1971 
at various levels of expenditure for Alberta school divisions. The 
estimates are in 1956 dollars and make no provision for further 
increases in the consumer price index. The low teacher-pupil ratio 
which exists in school divisions makes the cost per pupil very sen¬ 
sitive to even slight increases in expenditures. On the basis of the 
present rate of increase in annual expenditures and with the same 
teacher-pupil ratio the cost per pupil will approach 400 dollars in 
1961 and 500 in 1971: on the basis of a more favorable teacher-pupil

ratio and a stepped up ratio in the rate of increase in teachers* 
salaries the cost per pupil will approach 450 dollars in 1961 and 600 
dollars in 1971. The latter figure represents an annual increase of 
20 dollars per pupil per year. This is no greater than the increase 
between 1955 and 1956 or of the annual increase during the 1946-56 
decade. Even though there is some levelling off in the rate of inc¬ 
rease of major items of expenditures between 1961 and 1971, it is 
apparent that the total expenditures for education in rural Alberta 
will substantially increase; it appears apparent also that the down¬ 
ward trend in the purchasing power of the dollar will more than offset 
any levelling off in current dollars that may take place. 

IV. LOCAL SUPPORT OF EDUCATION 

Projected Divisional Revenue From Taxation 

Hidden taxes are far less repugnant than direct taxes. The 
land tax, falling in the latter category, has always been painful; 
also, as previously discussed, land is no longer as valid a measure 
of ability to pay as it was in the days that it constituted the major 
form of wealth in a predominantly rural economy. For these and other 
reasons it is not easy to evaluate what constitutes an ’’over burden” 
in taxation. 

Table LXXXVI was designed to illustrate actual trends in the 
total assessment of school divisions in Alberta, as well as trends in 
the mill rate from 1949 to 1956, with projected trends until 1971, Since 
many towns and villages signed inclusion agreements with divisions

between 1936 and 1947, it was not possible to establish a realistic 
pattern of trends in assessment for that period,, 

Between 1949 and 1956 the total assessment upon which divis¬ 
ional requisitions were levied moved upward by $150 million, or at 
about the rate of $20 million per year on the average* Since total 
assessment moved upward by $36 million between 1952 and 1953 as a 
result of adjustments made to establish ,, uniform ,, assessments in 

various taxing units, the actual average annual increase was slightly 

5 

under the $20 million figure mentioned previously*" Total assessments 
for 1961, 1966 and 1971 were arrived at on the assumption that there 
would be little change in the annual rate of increase* An assessment 
of $832 million in 1971 would just double the 1949 assessment of 
$415 million* 

In 1949 an average mill rate had but little meaning* The 
range was from a low of 15 mills in Foothills to a high of 40 mills 
in Wheatland* However, the mill rate required to raise the 1949 
? requisition, on the basis of total assessment, was 22*6 mills* By 
1954 the average rate had climbed to a high of 31 mills, with a range 
from 17 to 60 mills. 

The effort of the provincial government in 1955 to ’’peg” the 
school tax rate at 25 mills through the introduction of a tax 
reduction subsidy has previously been discussed. It had the effect 
of stabilizing the mill rate for most school divisions and counties 
for the year 1955, but by the following year seventeen divisions and 
counties had school tax rates of more than 29 mills. Since a rate

of 25 mills for school purposes was considered by competent authorities 
to be a reasonable burden, it was assumed that an average of 30 mills 
would not be too unrealistic for the immediate future <> In that event 
basic requisitions would amount to almost $25 million, which amounts 
to a doubling within the twenty-year period 1951 to 1971* 

Revenue Required by Alberta School Divisions 

In 1956 the main sources of revenue to school divisions were 
basic requisitions and provincial grants; supplementary requisitions 
levied on towns and villages which had signed inclusion agreements, and 
’’other” revenue accruing from tuition payments and sale of property, 
were a very minor source of revenue. 

The distribution of revenue according to sources, as provided 
in Table LXXXVTI assumes a required revenue equal to expenditures, 
as previously projected for 1961, 1966 and 1971; also, the basic 
requisitions used are those previously projected* On these bases 
sizeable increases in revenue would need to come from outside sources, 
namely provincial grants* Actual grants in 1956 amounted to $17 
million (exclusive of capital grants) as compared with $7 million 
in 1951* In the light of this comparison, grants amounting to $30 
million in 1961 and $48 million in 1971 are perhaps not too unreal¬ 
istic. Further decreases in the purchasing power of the dollar would 
push the figure still higher. In addition, capital grants in excess 
of $6 million per year would be required to maintain the present level 
of support to the school construction program* It was not possible

to project actual classroom needs, since new buildings depend upon 
reorganization to a greater degree than upon total enrolment* How¬ 
ever, a previous analysis of new construction and planned construction 
indicated future expenditures on a scale at least equal to the present 
outlays for classrooms and ancillary rooms* 

The School Grant Structure 

At the present time an estimated 70 per cent of the total pro¬ 
vincial grants to school divisions in Alberta falls in the category of 
equalization grants* This has had the effect of "levelling off" the 
mill rate in order to obtain a more uniform distribution of the tax 
burden* Building grants and low interest rates on loans have done much 
to ease the burden of financing construction, and, as a result, have 
done much to encourage reorganization. Conveyance grants have been a 
"boon" to rural school divisions: in actual dollars these grants 
amount to far more than the 40 per cent of costs as provided in actual 
conveyance grants, since other classroom grants involve a consideration 
of the number of pupils conveyed. In several instances the provincial 
government has assumed the equivalent of the entire cost of conveyance. 

While a considerable degree of equalization has been achieved, 

there are still grave inequalities among various taxing units; some 

divisions of high assessment are able to provide a high standard of 

service out of a very modest tax load while for others the burden 

£ 

is greater for lesser services*

of high assessment in Alberta in 1956 and the potential revenue at 
a rate of thirty mills. In the case of Clover Bar the potential 
levy of $1,180,000.00, is almost $300,000.00 greater than total expend¬ 
itures of $907,000.00 for education in 1956. In the other three 

divisions listed, as well as in several others, sizeable portions of 

7 

potential tax are being lost. 

Table LXXXIX provides data on the projected expansion in net 
value of production in Alberta in 1975* These provide a crude measure 
of the expected physical expansion of various segements of the economy. 
The estimate for agriculture ($450 million) is only $90 million higher 
than in 1951: in terms of 1956 dollars the difference is still less 
($40 million). If the consumer price index continues its upward 
trend, the net value of production in agriculture in 1971 on the 
basis of the above estimate, and, in terms of constant dollars, could 
be well below the 1951 total and not too much above the 1956 total. 

In terms of proportions the estimated 1955-75 ratio for agriculture 
is the lowest for the major industries of Alberta, and is considerably 
less than one-half the average ratio for all industries. It is not a 
promising source of extensive increases in revenue for education and 
other services. 

The Total Tax P icture in Municipal Districts 

It is unrealistic to consider the school tax load entirely 
apart from the general tax load, since the local contribution toward 
the cost of all local services comes from the same source.

Table XC reviews net farm income, total tax levy and school 
tax levy (in terms of 1956 dollars) for the past two decades,, While 
net farm income was considerably less (33 per cent) in 1956 than in 
1951, it was seven times as great as in 1936; on the other hand the 
total tax levy was only five times as great, and the school tax 
levy was slightly under four times as great. Although the tax burden 
was doubtlessly excessive in 1936, it appears that, on the basis of 
net farm income, the agricultural economy is capable of producing 
a somewhat higher revenue from taxation. 

Considering anticipated increases in the revenue required 
for all local services, it would seem that an educational tax rate 
of 30 mills applied to total municipal assessment would not be out 
of line with the situation prevailing in 1953 when the index was 171, 
as compared with 132 in 1956. Although there is no available gauge 
of ability to pay taxes, there would seem to be a limit above which 
it is not expedient to go. It would appear that this limit was 
approached in 1953, and created the need for ”tax reduction" measures. 

V. EDUCATIONAL SIGNIFICANCE 

Of the several factors which collectively make up educational 
expenditures the number of teachers employed is the most significant. 

It determines the quantity of classrooms needed, maintenance services, 
and sets the pattern for total instructional costs. The teaching 
force is determined by the number of pupils to be provided an education 
(Table LXXVI), and by the teacher-pupil ratio that prevails (Table LXXV)

Reorganization has not reduced the ratio appreciably nor does such 
reduction appear educationally desirable, particularly at the high 
school level; rather, in view of the number of comparatively small 
schools still in existence, it will be desirable, from the stand¬ 
point of adequacy of instruction, to make further reductions in 
grades per classroom. This will further reduce the teacher-pupil 
ratio, but will create greater opportunities in terms of pupil pro¬ 
gress: it will also increase substantially the number of teachers 
required (Table LXXVTI). 

The other component of total instructional cost is the average 
salary per teacher. In 1956 the average in school divisions and 
counties was somewhat below the average for Alberta and was consider¬ 
ably below that for cities (Table LXXVTII); it was also below the 
average income per worker in the labour force (Table LXXIX). Since 
the types of positions available, the working and living conditions, 
and the M work load” in terms of grades per classroom, are often less 
attractive in rural than in urban areas, quite substantial salary 
increases will be necessary in order to secure and to retain more and 
better-qualified teachers in divisional schools (Table LXXXI). 

It is apparent that a sizeable increase in the number of 
teachers employed, together with substantial increases in salaries, 
will result in steeply rising instructional costs (Table LXXXII). 

This will be unavoidable if more and better qualified teachers are to 
be obtained. 

Although total current costs of education do not vary directly

with total costs of teachers* salaries, there is a reasonably reliable 
relationship (Table LXXXIIl). Projections based upon this relation¬ 
ship indicate an approximate doubling in current expenditures during 
the next fifteen years (Table LXXXIV). The provision of services 
sufficient to insure a greater degree of "equality of educational oppor¬ 
tunity" in rural areas appear indispensable to the welfare of Alberta. 
However, it is quite apparent that at whatever level of effectiveness 
public school education operates in school divisions and counties 
total expenditures will advance appreciably in the immediate future* 

No one has yet evolved an adequate measure of ability to 
pay taxes* In the case of a direct tax, such as the tax on land, 
effort is determined to a large degree by the value placed upon the 
service in question. As a result, effort is not a reliable gauge of 
ability to pay. In the light of rapidly increasing costs for all 
services (Table XC), it would appear that the educational mill rate 
may be approaching the upper limit of expansion (Table LXXXVII). 

Some further revenue from taxation could be made available by the 
application of a basic mill rate to all taxing units (Table LXXXVTII). 

The distribution of future expansions in industries other than 
agriculture will be concentrated in areas that are readily accessible 
to lines of transportation, labour force supply, power facilities, and 
natural resources* As a result, there will be a "clustering" of 
assessment as the industrial expansion anticipated for Alberta pro¬ 
gresses (Table LXXXIX). This suggests taxing methods that will provide 
for a redistribution of tax revenue among the various municipal units*

An industrial tax levied by the provincial government and redistributed 
in the form of grants would satisfy this requirement. 

In the light of an examination of the interaction of demographic 
and economic trends in rural Alberta during the past twenty-five 
years, and in the light of the financial impact of those trends upon 
the rural economy in the future, there is considerable doubt as to the 
wisdom of ’'tying*’ rural education to the least buoyant sector of the 
provincial economy (Table LXXXIX). The analyses suggest that increas¬ 
ingly large proportions of funds for education must come from sources 
other than the land tax. On the other hand, it is desirable for local 
authorities to make some financial contribution to the costs of 
education and other services; and the tax on real property constitutes 
the most satisfactory and universal means of providing a degree of 
local financial participation. The evidence suggests a basic mill 
rate on approved assessment as the determinant of the local contri¬ 
bution toward total educational costs; the balance would come from other 
sources of revenue emanating from the more buoyant sectors of the 
provincial economy. Doubtlessly there is some "stretch" left in the 
land tax but major increases in the mill rate do not appear too 
"realistic." 

One Canadian educationist has summed up the merits of the 
property tax thus: 

Almost without exception, students of public finance reject 
the property tax in principle and accept it as inevitable. It 
has the benefits of directness and certainty, but is only indi¬ 
rectly related to the basic principle of ability to pay. Some 
writers have attempted to justify it on the theory that the

expenditure of sums derived from the property tax confers 
specific benefits on the owners of property* Even that 
has been rejected by most economists.... I think we must 
accept the fact that the property tax is simply a method 
of collecting revenues for local government purposes. Its 
chief and perhaps only justification rests on the principle 
that local governments, to be efficient and responsible, 
must raise some money from their own taxation sources.8 

The same note has been sounded by a prominent Canadian econ¬ 
omist in an address before the Canadian Education Association: 

...all governments should raise some money for their own 
purposes. In my view this is about the only justification 
for the property tax...• When you have gone over the whole 
field of taxation there is perhaps not much left to the 
municipalities other than the property tax.... Most other 
taxes can be collected better and more effictively by the 
provincial or the federal government.9 

In the final analysis education must be regarded as a prov¬ 
incial and even a national service: financial responsibility must 
be given the same breadth of vision.^ 0 While local participation in 
the management of our schools is essential to democracy, and while 
some degree of financial participation by local authorities is 
desirable, there should be no restriction of educational development 
in any area because of the inadequacies of local sources of revenue."

CHAPTER X 


IMPLICATIONS AND FURTHER RESEARCH 
I. IMPLICATIONS 

The early patterns of settlement and of school organization 
in Alberta encompassed typical pioneer conditions—small farms, 
restricted communication and travel, and the relatively simple edu¬ 
cational demands of people who were entrenching themselves in a land 
of untested agricultural potential# The small school flourished in 
small and vigorous communities whose citizens were developing a "way 
of life'* in relative isolation. 

Financial problems were perhaps less complex than they are 
today# The pioneer farmers of Alberta were largely self-sufficient, 
and uncertain markets were minimized by.low overhead and limited cap¬ 
italization# Farming communities, depending as they did upon much 
hand labour, needed and readily absorbed their own increase of unskilled 
workers# Many farms were "family farms" which were owned and operated 
by members of the family. This further reduced the flow of dollars 
away from the farm and so increased the self-sufficiency of the farm 
unit# 

Farming operations were carried out with a minimum of specialized 
equipment# A "strong back" was one of the requirements of farm labourers. 
The need for extensive academic or vocational training was not as appar¬ 
ent as it is today* The small school district and the one-room school 
were quite adequate for the job at hand—instruction in the three R*s.

Although size presented a problem from the first, the small 
municipal district provided a reasonably effective unit for the adm¬ 
inistration of local services. Land, being the principal form of 
wealth, was the logical source of local revenue. The land tax was 
relatively adequate to the needs of local authorities particularly 
because it had the virtue of being readily administered. All local 
expenditures involved only the local community and its residents, 
most of whom depended upon land as a source of income. Ability to 
pay was directly related to ownership of land. 

Even while early settlement was assuming its first character¬ 
istics, demographic and economic forces were in operation in a man¬ 
ner which would substantially modify the goals toward which the 
pioneers worked. There was evidence even before the birth of Alberta 
in 1905 that the ’’way of life” was not to be untroubled. It was 
learned early that quarter-sections of land were not all equal in 
productivity; sub-marginal units failed to provide sufficient returns 
to support the modest financial demands of the pioneer economy. The 
early need to abandon the quarter-section system of landholding in 
many parts of Alberta brought with it the first accentuation of school 
population scatter. The story is told by dwindling enrolments in 
rural schools, and by non-operating ’’tombstone” districts. 

For the past four decades trends have been at work changing 
every aspect of rural living. Prominent among these trends have been 
farm mechanization, reductions in the labour force, increased farm 
acreages, capitalization, and commercial farming. The accentuation

of scatter which resulted was paralleled by an increasing need for 
more and better education. 

Pressing financial problems have resulted. Rural birth rates, 
although subject to periodic national influences, remained relatively 
high. The rural economy was unable to absorb the surplus population. 
Large numbers of rural youth were forced to migrate. For economic 
reasons, many farmers who adhered to the early plan of farming became 
subsistence farmers, and were financially unable to meet the demands 
placed upon them. The three R*s failed to meet the educational needs 
of either the young people who remained on the farm or those who mig¬ 
rated to urban areas, where semi-skills and skills were the keys to 
satisfying employment. It early became apparent that financial out¬ 
lays far greater than those required to operate the one-room school 
would be required, if the changing needs of rural education were to 
be met. 

Paralleling the general trends which were operative through¬ 
out rural Alberta was the further accentuation of population scatter 
in the southern areas of the province. This was accompanied by popu¬ 
lation expansion in the north. Efforts on the part of local and 
provincial authorities to meet the new demands for education and to 
offset the problem of scatter expressed themselves in the form of 
expanded administrative units, larger attendance areas, and inclusion 
agreements. The problem was one of combining adequate instruction 
with economy of operation. 

Financially the trend became progressively clear—a growing

feeling of the inadequacy of the land tax. Changes in land usage, 
not necessarily related to income, engendered inequalities in the 
burden of educational load. Accompanying this was a continuing upward 
trend in educational costs, as local administrative units attempted 
to formulate and to carry out effective programs of reorganization. 
Increasing expenditures for conveyance and annual debt charges con¬ 
stituted a kind of "operational overhead" that directed dollars away 
from the instructional program. Often there was little relationship 
between the operational overhead resulting from reorganization and the 
tax-paying ability of the local administrative units concerned. It is 
noteworthy, however, that in spite of vastly increased educational 
costs, there was a decline in the proportion of the total local tax 
revenue being expended for education. This resulted from the increas¬ 
ing demands for additional services, as the standard of living improved 
It expressed itself in keen competition for tax dollars among the 
various local services. 

While expenditures for education and other local services were 
being increased annually, agriculture was losing its buoyancy, and 
soon was no longer the major sector of the provincial economy. Thus, 
in addition to inequalities in ability to pay among rural taxing units, 
there was a general downward trend in the proportion of the net value 
of production for Alberta emanating from agriculture. 

The unequal distribution of educational costs, in relation to 
ability to pay, necessitated the development of a system of provincial 
grants to education which emphasized the "equalization" factor. The

redistribution of provincial monies among local education authorities 
has been accompanied by a marked upward trend in the total amount of 
education grants. One of the results has been a steadily increasing 
proportion of provincial expenditures being devoted to education and 
a decreasing proportion of local expenditures being so used. While 
the provincial authorities assumed a greater share of educational 
costs, local authorities directed larger proportions of their funds 
elsewhere. To a degree at least, the increased provincial grants to 
education represented a substitution of provincial expenditures for 
local expenditures. 

In view of the developments which have taken place, one must 
conclude that the major changes to date—1959—in the organization, 
curriculum, and financing of rural education have been inevitable 
with regard to forces at work. Changes in the pattern of rural edu¬ 
cation have resulted from efforts to find a satisfactory replacement 
for a system which proved inadequate. The sheer cost of reorganizing 
the physical aspects of rural education to keep the system operating 
in the face of demographic and economic change accounted for a major 
portion of increased educational expenditure in the past several 
decades. The gravity of these problems may have caused rural society 
to concentrate upon quantitative aspects of rural education, and con¬ 
sequently to fail to appreciate fully the task of education in modern 
society. 

With this thought in mind one is forced to assess the quality 
of the present provisions for education and to analyze certain

attitudes toward education which are common in rural communities. 

The present pattern of rural centralizations undoubtedly 
extends opportunities for rural children far beyond those available 
in the one-room school. There are some variations in programs, but 
these are seriously restricted both in clientele and in scope. The 
achievement of matriculation has been a boon to the academically inc¬ 
lined. However, all young people who will be absorbed in rural life 
need greater access to semi-skills, skills, and pre-vocational edu¬ 
cation in general, as do many of those who migrate cityward. 

The obvious means of providing this expanded program would be 
through further centralization and pooling of student bodies. The 
limitations of this approach are readily apparent. The restricted 
potential of further ’•inclusions”, the relatively static total, and 
the continued scatter of the rural population make major extensions 
of the present pattern impractical. The implication is that we must 
face almost prohibitive costs or evolve new forms of organization. 

In this regard, negative attitudes toward conveyance, dorm¬ 
itory accommodation, and other special arrangements which involve 
some ‘’personal sacrifice” to the cause of better education loom 
large. These are real obstacles. It is quite possible that a more 
satisfactory approach to rural education must await the development 
of a more understanding attitude toward the real problems involved. 

In this respect a program of public relations through adult education 
which has as its goal an appreciation of the vital needs of rural 
education would constitute a constructive approach.

Equally as critical, educationally, is the attitude that 
deplores the exodus of rural youth from the farm. The "education of 
young people away from the farm" is not economically "bad", unless 
the "pull" to the city becomes radically greater than the "push" away 
from the farm. If it is argued that this condition already exists, 
the solution lies perhaps in providing a more satisfying economic life 
for rural communities. In the final analysis, the quality of rural 
education will be an important factor in achieving this end. 

The "balance" between urban "pull" and rural "push" depends 
predominantly upon this economic factor. Farm income depends upon 
the degree of efficiency with which the factors of production are 
managed. As land, capital, and management are more effectively organ¬ 
ized, the share of production going into the labour can be increased. 
Greater efficiency would appear to be the most effective means of 
balancing the "push" and the "pull," This is largely a matter of more 
and better education. 

The responsibilities of rural communities, however, are broader 
than the provision of an adequate education for young people who 
return to the farm. Mobility, surpluses in the rural population, 
decreases in the employment opportunities for unskilled workers, and 
the growth of employment opportunities in urban areas all underscore 
the desirability of upgrading rural education. If surplus rural 
youth are to be employable, they must have access to a kind of edu¬ 
cation which is adequate for urban society. There can no longer be 
a rural-urban distinction; the products of the school must be inter¬ 
changeable .

Finally, public attitudes toward education must be scrutinized. 
There is need for a shift in the purpose of financing away from "who 
is going to pay for what we have" to "what will we need to spend to 
achieve the desired end.” In this regard there is need for almost 
a visionary statement of what we need in education and how we are going 
to pay for it 0 

There are not many rural communities which will have either 
the student base or the financial resources to diversify and extend 
the local program of education to the degree required# We now have 
"free" public education, within the rather restricted limits imposed 
by place of residence and within the confines of the grades and sub¬ 
jects taught in particular schools# New organizational patterns may 
require a great extension of "free" education# 

The indications are that, while local participation in the 
financing of education will probably continue, the almost universal 
significance of education, as borne out by this study, means that the 
state must shoulder greater financial responsibility. 

One of the Shocking” financial implications of this study 
is that we may have reconstructed an educational system which is 
inadequate to the needs, and, furthermore, is not entirely susceptible 
to the modifications that may be required# 

A realistic approach to the problems of rural education must 
be based upon state responsibility sufficient to provide a financial 
guarantee of a sound basic education for all# Financial schemes of 
the future must distribute the costs of education, even more fully 
than now, beyond any locale 0

II. FURTHER RESE ARCH 

There are three rather clearly defined areas for further 
research suggested by this study—the administration of rural edu¬ 
cation, public relations, and finance. The following are indicative 
of the types of problems requiring answers: 

1„ Administration—-What administrative arrangements will 
make more effective the present program of rural education? What is 
the nature and extent of state participation required to achieve the 
goals of rural education? How can the rigidity that is inherent in 
state planning be minimized? Under what conditions should the state 
assume greater responsibility for education? 

2, Public Relations-What are the basic qualities of effect¬ 

ive education for rural Alberta? How can public understandings of 
these qualities be achieved? What are effective means of securing 
active and constructive participation by the public in educational 
planning? 

3. Educational Finance—What financial arrangements will 
facilitate the extension of educational services to rural areas? How 
can the costs of rural education be most effectively shared? What 
additional sources of revenue could be made available to rural munici¬ 
palities? What are effective means of securing for education maximum 
benefits from the land tax? The industrial tax? What is the relat¬ 
ionship between the division of costs for education and the sharing 
of administrative responsibility?
