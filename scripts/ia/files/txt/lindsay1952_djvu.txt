ABSTRACT 


A study of the late embryological development in the 
egg of Agrotis orthogonia Morr. is described. From the 
order of morphological development, as viewed through a 
binocular dissecting microscope, a key to the rate of 
incubation at 30° C. has been composed. It is shown that 
the eggs of this species will incubate and hatch at 10° C., 
1^° C., 20° C., 25 ° C., and 30° C. At 35° C. and 40° C. 
normal hatch fails to occur. 

Information is included on the partial development 
which occurs at 2° C. and 5° C. The effects of transferring 
these partially incubated eggs to the median temperatures 
after diverse periods of exposure are also shown. The 
results of storing freshly deposited eggs at 0° C., -5° C., 
-10° C., -15° G., and -20° C. for various lengths of time 
are illustrated by the data. 

The discussion includes some possible reasons why the 
material reacted in the observed manner. Some practical 
applications of the data are mentioned. 








SOME EFFECTS OF TEMPERATURE 


ON THE RATE OF INCUBATION OF EGOS OF 
THE RALE WESTERN CUTWORM 
( AGROTXS ORTHQGONIA MORE.) 


INTRODUCTION 

One of the most serious pests of grain crops in 
Saskatchewan and Alberta is the pale western cutworm, 

Agrotis orthogonia Morr. This insect is a native of the 
prairie regions, but it was not until 1911 that damage of 
economic importance was reported by Gibson (13, 14-) . The 
species was first described by H. K. Morrison (26) in 
1077, although Gibson (16) later gave it the common name 
of the pale western cutworm. Since 1911 periodic outbreaks 
have caused severe losses to farmers of Saskatchewan and 
Alberta, as well as the northern prairie areas of the 
United States. 

Each year a forecast of the expected pale western cut¬ 
worm infestation is made. This forecast is based on several 
of the previous years data and observations:-

1. The number of wet days occurring during the larval 
feeding period. 

2. A survey of larval damage. 

3. The state of the soil surface at the time of the 
moth flight. 

4. The moth survey. 

On several occasions all these factors have favoured an 
increase in cutworm population for the following spring, and 
yet the expected outbreak has failed to materialize. It is 
possible that this is due to one or more field conditions 
affecting embryological development. For this reason it was 
decided that it would be desirable to know something of the 
developmental stages of the pals western cutworm egg. 

There are several other reasons why this project was 
undertaken. Pi eld deposited eggs are quite often examined. 
Providing the approximate incubation temperature is known, 
an estimate of the time of oviposition may be made if the 
developmental stage can be recognized. An idea of the 
time of larval emergence might also be given. Eg g storage 
in the laboratory is essential if off-season ’work is to be 
carried on normally. The most recent data indicate that 
eggs at some stages of development store more successfully 
than at others. Certain temperatures are also more favour-

able to egg storage, Egg dissections in tiie laboratory and 
the field will enable workers to give early and accurate 
estimates of egg fertility. 

Although this is primarily a study of the ambryo, no 
attempt is made to study the early development or organogeny 
of the embryo. The incubation observations are based on the 
identification of various morphological characteristics in 
the order of their appearance. A detailed eytological study 
of embryological development has not been attempted. 

Some effects of temperature on the rate of development 
of the embryo have been studied. From these an indication 
of egg reaction in the field might be determined. 

REVIEW OF LITERATURE 


This review will not attempt to outline all the work 
that has been done on insect embryology. Only those 
publications which help to give a sound basis for a study 
of the morphological development of an insect embryo, 
together with some of those which discuss the effects of 
temperature and humidity on the rate of that development, 
will be mentioned. The review will therefore be divided 
into two categories, one dealing with insect embryology,

and the other with temperature and humidity effects on rate 
of development. Exceptional types of egg development will 
not be discussed. 

INSECT E. ..B& YQLGG-Y 

Embryology has been defined as the study of the embryo, 
its formation and development. The structural unit of the 
animal or plant embryo is the cell (23). It is with the cell, 
ie. the ovum, that most papers on insect embryology begin. 

The fertilization of the ovum nucleus by the nucleus of the 
spermatozoon gives rise to the zygote which in turn becomes 
the embryo. In Prodenia eridania Cram., Gross and HowfLand 
( 17 ) found that fertilization occurred within the yolk just 
beneath the micropyle. 

This act of fertilization usually occurs in insects just 
prior to the deposition of the egg ( 23 ). hempel (28) states 
that in Mainestra configurata (Walker) fertilization is 
accomplished within the second half-hour following oviposition. 
Gambrell (12) found that the nucleus of some eggs of 
Simulium pictipe s Hagen was at the stage of polar body 
formation at the time of deposition, while in others early 
cleavage had begun.

Cleavage and blastoderm formation now occurs, Auten 
(1) observed that in Phormia regina (Meig.) cleavage was 
under way within two hours of oviposition. Jeffrey (21) was 
able to identify the blastoderm in the embiyo of Botys 
hyalinalis Hb. (Microstega hyalinalis (Hb.)) as an extremely 
fine marginal line eight hours after the egg had been laid. 
Woodsworth (33) noted that the blastoderm of the embryo of 
Buvanessa antiopa L. ( Nymphalis antiopa (L.)) was complete 
24 hours after oviposition. He mentions no developmental 
temperature. 

The germ band develops next, followed by the embryonic 
envelopes, the amnion and serosa. These processes were found 
to occur between the sixteenth and twenty-eighth hours after 
oviposition in Diacrisia virginica Babr. by Johannsen (22). 
However, Butt (3) showed that in Bciara coprophila Lint, the 
embryo is entirely covered over and protected by the two 
embryonic envelopes at the fifteenth hour following oviposition. 

As the embryonic envelopes are forming, gastrulation of 
the germ band takes place. Butt (4) observed that the 
gastrular groove in Brachyrhinus iigustici L. was complete by 
the third day. After the lateral and anterior amniotic folds 
have formed blastokinesis takes place. Miller (23) says that 
in Pteronarcys proteus Newman a shortening accompanies

consolidation of the body regions, and in order that further 
growth may occur, blastokinesis must take place* Bempel (28) 
showed that blastokinesis occurred in the embryo of Mamestra 
configurata (Walker) at the seventieth hour of development 
at room temperature, ie., 68 °- 72 ° F. 

During blastokinesis segmentation and appendage formation 
takes place. 'The abdomen of some primitive insects such as 
Lepisma spp. may consist of 12 segments (23). However, most 
insects normally have eleven segments. Johannsen (22) states 
that segmentation of Diacrisi a virginica Fabr. begins soon 
after the fourtieth hour. Indication of legs budding on some 
segments of Botys hyalinalis Hb. was observed by Jeffrey (21) 
on the fifth day of development, Lastham (9) says that the 
appendages develop as paired outgrowths of the body wall on all 
segments of the body of the embryo of Pieris rapae L. 

After differentiation of the mesoderm, ie., segmentation, 
coelomic sac formation, etc., the development of the 
alimentary canal begins. Invaginations at the anterior and 
posterior ends of the embryo indicate the beginnings of the 
stomodaeum and proctodaeum. In the embryo of Sciara coprophila 
Lint. Butt (3) noted that the stomodaeum appeared as a shallow 
depression in the anterior region of the embryo at the twenty- 
fifth hour. However, he was not able to discern the 
proctodaeum until the fiftieth hour.

When closure of the dorsal wall is complete, which 
Johannsen (22) says occurs at about 95 hours in ijacrisia 
virginica Babr., formation of the heart begins. Jeffrey 
(21) noted the first pulsations of the dorsal vessel in 
Botys hyalinalis Hb. on the ninth day of embryonic devel¬ 
opment * 

The nervous system has its origin in the neural groove 
according to Johannsen and Butt ()• Butt (3), in his 
investigations of Sciara coprophila Lint., found that the 
neural groove begins forming at the twenty-fifth hour. 

Working with Simuliun pictipes Hagen, G-ambrell (12) showed 
that the neural groove was developing soon after the twenty- 
fourth hour following oviposition. 

Shortly after the outer neural ridges have become 
segmented the stigmata of the tracheal system appear. Last- 
ham (9) , in his paper on the embryology of Pieris rapae L., 
says that the respiratory system develops from spiracular 
invaginations. 

With the formation and disappearance of the dorsal organ 
(Snodgrass 32 ), and the advent of dorsal closure, the body 
of the embryo has become an elongate sac with continuous 
walls. Grambrell (12) says the dorsal wall closes early on 
the fourth day of development in Simulium pictipes Hagen.

Salt (29) states that in several Helanoplus spp. dorsal 
closure is complete by the nineteenth day when development 
is at 23° 0. According to Eempel (28), the embryoof 
Mamestra configurate (Walker) is about 130 hours old vmen it 
sets itself free by rupturing the serosa, vitelline membrane, 
and the egg chorion. 

rlMPkRATUE.ii; AMD HUMIDITY 


Wigglesworth (34) says that tne most important factor 
controlling the rate of embryological development is 
temperature, within the vital limits of each species. 
G-enerally speaking, development is accelerated by high 
temperatures and retarded by low. 

Avans’ (11) data on the eggs of Lucilia sericata Meig. 
indicate that 100 per cent hatch will occur when the eggs 
develop anywhere between 14° C. and 35° C. Beyond these 
limits he observed that mortality increases rapidly with a 
comparatively small increase or decrease in temperature. He 
found that the limiting temperatures for the development of 
eggs of Lucilia sericata Meig. were about 10° C. and 40° C.

Bo&ine (2) concluded tiiat it is possible to calculate the 
time of hatching of insect eggs if previous temperature 
history is knov/n. 

Temperature is an important factor in ensuring the 
fertility of deposited insect eggs. Wigglesworth (^4) says 
that although the temperature limits for oviposition may be 
wide, the limits between which mating may occur are often 
much narrower. Wigglesworth also says that males seem to 
be more sensitive to abnormal temperatures than females. 
Hanna (18) showed that when the chalcid, Suchalcidia was 
exposed to 16° C. for 10 days, females still laid normal 
complements of eggs, but 70 per cent of the males were 
sterile. 

Actually very few quantitative data on the effect of 
temperature on the duration of the incubation period are 
available. Of the many embryologieal papers which give 
very concise information on time of embryo development, very 
few mention a specific temperature at which the egg was 
incubated. Several mention room temperatures, others speak 
of normal seasonal temperatures, while some, either make no 
mention of temperature, or they give a probable range of 
temperatures that may have occurred during the incubation 
period. Melvin (24) showed from his observations on muscoid

flies that high as well as low temperatures prolong the 
developmental period of the eggs. 

Buxton (5>), working with eggs of Helanoplus atlanis 
Sauss. ( Melanoplus mexicanus mexicanus (Sauss.)) found that 
over a wide range of temperatures, mortality was governed by 
humidity. Evans (11) says that the important factor governing 
mortality is loss of water and not temperature directly. He 
observed that eggs of Lucilia sericata Meig. are killed by 
relatively low saturation deficiencies at high or low 
temperatures, but at median temperatures, higher saturation 
deficiencies are tolerated. 

According to Evans (11), Holdaway (19) showed that 
humidity had very little effect on the duration of the egg 
stage in Tribodium confusum h uva i when incubated at 27° C. 

On the other hand Evans says that Janisch (20) found, when 
studying the egg of Prodenia littoralis On., that the duration 
of development, percentage of eggs completing development, and 
mortality were profoundly affected by the humidity of the 
surrounding air. Schipper [J>Q) noted that retardation of 
development in eggs of melanoplus spp. occurred when the eggs 
became dehydrated, development continued nevertheless, as 
long as the eggs contained enough water to sustain growth. 

The stage of development of the embryo is often a 


determining factor in its ability to resist desiccation.

Buxton (6) says that an egg ready to hatch contains an embryo 
that is tracheats and covered with chitin and that such an 
egg is capable of resisting conditions that would have been 
fatal earlier in development. Buxton also says that 
Zwolfer (3&) was able to show that eggs of Panel!s flammea 
Neum, ( Apantesis flairsmea (Meum.)) tolerate a wide range of 
humidities but total mortality occurs in saturated air. 
Conversely, Janisch (20) found that eggs of Prodenia 
littoralis On. require a very high degree of humidity and 
are not harmed by the air being saturated. However, Buxton 
(6) concluded that in almost every example, a larger number 
of eggs hatched in air which was at or near saturation, than 
in air which was dry. 

LIFE HISTORY PIT THE PALE WESTERN CUT!OHM 


Oibson (16) contributed the first paper on the life 
history of the pale wistera cutworm. This report included 
field observations made by Strickland in 1913* A more 
detailed report on the life cycle was published by Parker, 
Strand, and Seamans (27) in 1921. In 1930 Cook (8) 
enlarged on this latter paper.

The female adult deposits her eggs in the soil in the 
fall of the year, usually between August 15 and September 15* 
According to Seamans (31)* these eggs appear to have 
completed the period of incubation before freeze-up* The 
winter is usually passed in this state although there have 
been reports of fall hatching by Parker, Strand, and Seamans 
(27), and by Cook (7). 

The larvae normally emerge from the egg early the 
following May* Hatching, or eclosion from the egg, is 
accomplished by the larva chewing a hole through the chorion 
with its mandibles (32). 

The larval stage, at which time the cutworm does its 
crop damage, is usually completed by the end of June. 
Temperature and moisture are two of the factors which cause 
variation in the length of the feeding period. 

The pupal stage is also spent in the soil. Th6 insect 
remains in this state for a period of three to six weeks. 
Normally, the adult moths emerge from the soil shortly after 
the middle of August and mating and oviposition begin soon 


afterwards

DESCRIPTION Off THE EGG 


According to Seamans (31)> pale western cutworm eggs are 
larger than those of most cutworms. They are about one mm. 
in diameter. 

Newly laid eggs are milky white, but as they develop 
their colour becomes bluish with a pearly lustre. Fully 
developed eggs are dark gray-purple. Since the eggs are laid 
in the soil and when fresh the chorion is sticky, a layer of 
soil particles usually adheres to them (Fig. 1). 

The egg is sub-spherical in form with the micropyiar 
area, and its opposite pole, somewhat flattened. The chorion 
shows a series of reticulations radiating from the micropyle 
(Fig. 2). 

The eggs are usually laid in masses in the soil, each 
egg cemented to its neighbor by the sticky substance covering 
the chorion. A cluster of eggs may vary from a few to well 
over one hundred. 


flATElilAi-iE AND -.iilTiiQDS 


The female moth emerges from the pupal state almost 
sexually mature. Eidmann (10) says that most Lepidoptera on

emergence from the pupa have nearly always a great number of 
undeveloped eggs in their ovaries, and that such eggs are 
developed post-metabolically, so becoming suitable for 
deposition. 

Dissection of female moths indicated that this does apply 
to Agrotis orthogonia Morr., but the fact that the female 
usually begins ovlpositing two or three days after emergence 
from the pupa shows that many of her eggs are very close to 
being mature. 

In the laboratory moths were kept in large glass jars 
containing two or trose inches of fine, dry soil. A honey 
and water solution was provided. Four or five pairs of moths 
were usually kept in each jar although fertile eggs were 
recovered from single pairs of males and females. 

High percentages of fertile eggs resulted when the moths 
were kept in an environment which included light and a 
temperature of 30 ° 0. for eight hours, and 3° 0. in darkness 
for a sixteen hour period. Mating and some oviposition 
occurred during the 3° C. period. Copulation was observed 
on one occasion. 

When a female had begun to cl^osit fertile eggs she could 
be removed from possible contact with male moths and continue 
to lay fertile eggs for almost three weeks.

At the end of each sixteen hour, 3° C. period, the soil 
was removed from the jars and sifted through a fine wire mesh 
screen which retained the deposited eggs. These eggs had 
been at a temperature of 3° C. for the few hours that they 
may have been laid, so that a minimum of development could 
have occurred. They could then be utilized in the various 
incubation trials. Eggs from both field-collected and 
laboratory-reared moths were obtained in this manner. 

The tests were carried out in controlled temperature 
rooms. The temperature in each room varied within -0.23° C. 
Freshly deposited eggs were incubated at the various 
temperatures. After it had been established that 30° C. was 
the optimum temperature for egg development, it was used as 
a check temperature for all tests. Fifty eggs of every 
collection were allowed to develop at 30° C. in order to 
ensure that the majority were fertile. Fifty eggs were 
incubated at each temperature in each replicate. Small 
petri dishes were used to contain the eggs. 

When eggs were removed for examination they were gently 
washed, using a moist camel hair brush to remove excess dirt, 
before being dissected. A binocular dissecting microscope 
was used and the egg chorion was ruptured with a pair of 
dissecting needles. The egg contents flowed or were squeezed

on to a glass slide where a drop of glycerol was added to 
prevent desiccation of the embryo before it could be 
examined. Some dissections were made under water. 

Most egg dissections were made using a magnification of 
160X but some examinations required 230X or 400X. Daily 
dissections were made of eggs from each trial. 

When observations indicated that the embryo had absorbed 
the surrounding yolk, moist blotting paper was added to the 
egg container. This moisture kept the chorion soft enough 
that the fully developed embryo had no difficulty in 
escaping from the egg. 

Tests on the effect of varying relative humidity were 
conducted at 35° C. and 40° C. The test eggs were put into 
desiccators in which the desired relative humidity was 
maintained by solutions of sulphuric acid as described by 
Solomon (33). 

When eggs were removed from the desiccators in the 
relative humidity tests, the lid of the desiccator was 
removed and replaced as quickly as possible in order that 
the equilibrium would be disturbed as little as possible. 
Equilibrium would probably be established within one hour 
of being disturbed so that the incubating eggs were subject 
to the desired relative humidity a minimum of 23 hours out of 
every 24.

When freshly deposited eggs are dissected they are found 
to contain a homogeneous, creamy fluid, The first indication 
that embryological development is underway is when a few small 
droplets of clear matter are noted in the yolk fluid. As 
development progresses these masses become larger. 

A cellular, colourless membrane, presumably the serosa, 
soon completes its formation. This membrane is underneath the 
chorion and completely envelopes the egg yolk and embryo. The 
egg shell may be dissected away leaving this membrane and its 
contents intact if extreme care is taken. This membrane 
usually, but not always, develops a few cream or rust coloured 
strands or masses. These strands are incorporated into the 
membrane itself and are not included in the egg yolk or embryo. 
If the chorion of an egg is cleaned of soil particles at this 
stage, the rust coloured matter is easily seen through it. 

One of the clear masses in the yolk becomes larger than 
the others and this can soon be identified as the developing 
embryo. It is a rather shapeless mass of clear matter before

assuming its definite, elongate form. The fluid surrounding 
the embryo remains a creamy-gray colour. 

The embryo can soon be seen to be a definite, segmented, 
fora, approximately 2 mas. long and 0.9 mms. in width. 

The pigmentation of the larval eyes is the next notable 
step in development of the embryo. They appear at first as 
two very small, light tan coloured spots. They serve to 
identify the anterior end of the embryo. As they grow they 
become darker brown in colour. It can now be seen that 
there are three pairs of eyes on each side of the head. 

They become a dark red-brown and finally black as the embryo 
develops. When they have acquired the dark brown colour they 
are clearly visible through the washed chorion of a complete 
egg. 

At the same time as the larval eyes are acquiring their 
first pigmentation, the outlines of the mandibles may be 
observed but they are completely lacking in pigment. If the 
embryo is dissected in water the rudiments of the thoracic 
legs, also unpigmented, can be seen. 

As the eyespots darken, a faint amber area appears in the 
embryo just behind the head. It is best viewed dorsally. 

As this amber area darkens to brown, it will be seen that a 
smaller amber area is present in most of the abdominal

segments. These areas are the ganglia of the embryonic 
nervous system. 

Shortly after the first of these amber areas appears 
mandibular pigmentation begins. An embryo dissected under 
water at this stage shows movement of the unpigmented 
thoracic legs. Also present are short unpigmented setae 
on the thorax and abdomen of the embryo. Spiracles lacking 
in pigment may also be seen. 

The pigmentation of the mandibles begins with the biting 
edges. As this region darkens from a yellow r to. a red-brown 
colour the remainder of the mandibles becomes lightly 
pigmented. During this period the other mouthparts begin 
to acquire pigment. Occasionally at this stage gas bubbles 
may be present in the egg fluid. 

When the mandibles have reached a state of moderate red- 
brown pigmentation, the head capsule and the dorsal thoracic 
plate both begin to show a slight gray colouration. By this 
time the spiracles, setae, and thoracic legs are usually 
darkly pigmented. The gray pigmentation of the head capsule 
gradually darkens until it finally becomes a shiny, dark 
brown colour. When the mandibles and head capsule have 
acquired partial pigmentation they are visible through the 
washed chorion of the complete egg.

As tile head capsule becomes pigmented the chorion of the 
complete egg begins to show a bluish-purple tinge. This tinge 
deepens until by the time the head capsule (Fig. J>) is fully 
pigmented, the chorion is a deep blue-purple. This is the 
colour often associated with fully developed pale vvestern cut¬ 
worm eggs. 

When the head capsule is still a dark gray colour the 
embryo ingests the yolk. Dissections of the embryo*s digestive 
tract were made prior to, and immediately after, the ingestion 
of the yolk. These dissections show definitely that the yolk 
is ingested by the embryo (Figs. 4, 5). 

Shortly before the yolk is ingested the embryo becomes 
much more resistant to desiccation in air. This would imply 
that the epicuticle of the embryo was functioning normally. 

Sven though the head capsule is now fully pigmented a 
dissected embryo shows the abdomen to be a pearly-white colour. 
The abdomen slowly becomes pigmented until it is a definite tan 
or buff colour. This is the state of the larva when it finally 
emerges from the egg. 

Although the embryo may now be fully developed 
morphologically, it does not hatch immediately even at optimum 
developmental temperatures. Embryos incubated at 2^° C. or 
^0° C. require a period of two or three days before they will 
hatch naturally, even though contact moisture is provided.

The more outstanding aspects of morphological development 
have been described in a hey that relates them to the duration 


of incubation at JQ 0 C. This key is intended as a convenient 


practical means of reference to embryonic development, so the 
time is given in days. The relationship between development 
ana time, as given in the hey, should be interpreted as not 
being too rigid, but rather as an optimum. Occasional embryos 
fell slightly behind or were slightly ahead of the described 
character. Only those characters observable under a binocular 
dissecting microscope have been described.

Tlie trials at 30° C. were conducted in a constant 
temperature room in ■which the relative humidity was maintained 
at 4-5-2 per cent. When the eggs had become fully developed 
moist blotting paper was added to the petri dish to ensure that 
the chorion was soft enough for the larva to escape from the 


egg.

Three series of 30 eggs each were incubated at this 
temperature. When the eggs had completed development no 
direct moisture was added to the eggs as in the other 
30° C. tests. In all three series larvae still managed to 
escape from the egg although no contact moisture was 
provided. When the eggs are moistened directly larval 
emergence begins on the eleventh day and is usually complete 
about the thirteenth. In the three test groups two series 
began to hatch on the thirteenth day and completed it on the 
nineteenth. The third group commenced hatching on the 
fourteenth day and concluded on the nineteenth. 

The three check groups averaged a hatch of 84 per cent. 

The three test series averaged 39 per cent hatch. The 
unhatched eggs were dissected on the twenty-first day and the 
majority of them contained fully developed but dead, 
desiccating embryos. 

A single test series of 30 eggs was incubated at 30° 0. 
and a relative humidity of 10 per cent. The check eggs were 
incubated as usual at 30° C. and a relative humidity of 43 
per cent. Ninety per cent of the check series hatched normally. 
The 30 eggs in the test group developed normally. Contact 
moisture was added on the ninth day and the larvae began 
emerging on the eleventh. Seventy-eight per cent of these 
eggs hatched.

Several clutches of eggs from field reared moths in 
captivity were obtained in the fall of 1951* Three groups 
of 50 field eggs each were incubated at 30° C. Daily 
dissections showed that the embryos developed at the same 
rate as those in the eggs from the laboratory reared material. 
Larval emergence began on the eleventh day in two groups and 
on the twelfth day in the third. These results corresponded 
very closely with those of the laboratory reared eggs. 

Several moths were observed ovipositing in the field 
during the fall of 1951 a nd several egg masses were recovered 
from the soil. A cluster of 40 of these eggs was incubated at 
30° C. Their rate of development coincided with that of the 
laboratory reared material. In view of these results it was 
not considered necessary to repeat the developmental tests at 
other temperatures with eggs from field reared moths. 

The results show that when pale western cutworm eggs 
are incubated at 30 ° 0. and a relative humidity of approxi¬ 
mately 45 per cent, they will hatch without the addition of 
contact moisture. However, when moisture is added directly 
to fully developed eggs they will begin hatching sooner and 
a greater percentage of larval eraergence will result. 

If moisture is added to fully developed eggs which have 
been incubated at 30 ° 0. with a relative humidity of 10 per 
cent they will hatch normally and in the usual time.

Eggs from field reared pale western cutworm moths 
develop at the same rate as eggs from laboratory reared 
material* 


THE EFFECT Off MEDIAN TEMPERATURES ON THE RATE OF DEVELOPMENT 


The developmental rate of pale western cutworm eggs at 
30 ° C. has already been recorded in a key. The rates have 
also been determined using temperatures of 10° C., 13° C., 

20° C*, and 23° C* The development of the embryo at these 
temperatures was traced using the same criteria of 
development as in the 30° C. tests. 

Three replicates were completed at each temperature and 
the results graphed. Each replicate was plotted on a graph 
(Tig. 6) but in several instances the results at particular 
stages agreed, so that these points overlap on the graph. The 
mean of the three replicates has been shown by a straight line 
graph for each test temperature. 

The criteria of development vhiehwere used in preparing 
the 30 ° C. key have been used in graphing the incubation rates 
at the other temperatures. These criteria may be identified 
on the vertical axis of the graph by letters which correspond 
with the various stages of the 30° C. key.

Fig. 7 shows the result of plotting temperature against 
the developmental time in days. “This graph illustrates that 
there is an increase in rate of development when the 
developmental temperature is increased, ie., there is a 
positive correlation between temperature and rate of devel¬ 
opment, at least within the limits 10° C. and 30° C. 

Also shown on Fig. 7 is a graph of linear regression 
derived by plotting the temperature in degrees centigrade 
against' the reciprocal of the incubation time in days. 

The regression line indicates that the theoretical 
threshhold of development is approximately 8° C. This agrees 
with the incubation results. Eggs would not complete devel¬ 
opment at 3 ° C. but they incubated successfully at 10° C. 

This graph also shows that with an increase in temperature 
there is an increase in rate of development. 

Using these data it is possible to calculate the approxi¬ 
mate time of hatching of eggs of the pale western cutworm, 
provided the previous temperature history of the eggs is known. 
It has also been shown that freshly deposited eggs will 
successfully complete development and hatch normally at 
temperatures within a range of 10° C. and 30° C.

TBSTS COaDliCTBP AT 33° C. and 40° C. 

When 30 eggs were incubated at a relative humidity of 

10 per cent and 33° C. development at first seemed to proceed 

quite normally. The larval eysspots were first observed on 

the fourth day of incubation. This agreed with the develop¬ 
er 

mental rate for 30 C. as shown in the key. 

As development continued it became evident that it was 
abnormal in some respects. The amber coloured areas of each 
segment, which were the ganglia of the nervous system, had 
become a much darker brown than was usual at the median tem¬ 
peratures. The integument of the embryo was a yellow colour 
rather than the pearly-white observed in the lower tempera¬ 
tures . 

By the ninth day most of the embryos had black head cap¬ 
sules but the yolk fluid had not been absorbed. Many of these 
embryos showed slight movements of the thoracic legs. 

At this time moist blotting paper was added to the egg 
container. Ho larvae had hatched by the fourteenth day so 
several embryos were dissected out of the eggs. Very few of 
these embryos showed any movement. It was noted that most of 
the head capsules were becoming distinctly wrinkled. Ho larval

emergence had occurred by the twentieth day so more embryos 
were dissected out of the eggs. All eggs contained dead 
embryos. 

Although embryos would not complete normal development 
at 33° C. and a relative humidity of 10 per cent it was thought 
that there might be a humidity level at which development would 
proceed normally to completion at this temperature. A test was 
carried out at 33° C. which provided the undeveloped groups of 
eggs with various levels of relative humidity, ie., 23 per cent, 
30 per cent, and 90 per cent. Another group of freshly 
deposited eggs had contact moisture added throughout the test 
period. 

As in the 10 per cent relative humidity trial, development 
seemed to progress normally in all tests until about the eighth 
day. At this time the excessive yellowing of the abdomen and 
browning of the nerve ganglia was. observed at all levels of 
relative humidity. No larvae hatched naturally in any of the 
tests. It was noted that in only a few instances was the egg 
yolk absorbed by the embryo. Soon after the head capsules had 
become fully pigmented they began to wrinkle. All dissected 
embryos were dead by the fifteenth day. Sven in the test where 
direct moisture was provided, or where a relative humidity of 
90 per cent was maintained, no larval hatch occurred.

Attempts were now made to determine whether incubating 
eggs could withstand a period of exposure to 35° C. One 
hundred and fifty unincubated eggs were exposed at 33° 0* 
Blotting paper in the egg container was kept moist. Three 
groups of 30 eggs each were transferred to a temperature of 
30° 0. after three and one-half, seven and 14 days respectively. 

Larvae of the three and one-half day group began hatching 
on the eleventh day of incubation. After four days 82 per¬ 
cent of the eggs had hatched. The check series shov* T ed a hatch 
of 88 per cent. 

No natural hatch took place in either the seven or 14 
day groups. After 21 days these eggs were dissected. They 
contained dead, desiccated embryos. 

Two groups of 30 undeveloped eggs were allowed to 
incubate at a temperature of 40° C. One group was kept at a 
relative humidity of 10 per cent and the other at 90 per cent. 

After four days the eggs at 10 per cent relative humidity 
were completely desiccated. The eggs incubating at 90 per 
cent relative humidity were not desiccated at this time but 
the embryos were distorted. On the sixth day, even though the 
yolk was fluid, the embryos were all dead. None of them had 
acquired any pigmentation. 

Twenty-five unincubated eggs were put into 30° 0. until 
examination of the embryos showed that the eyespots were

lightly pigmented. 'The remaining eggs were then transferred 
to 40° C. where they were placed on constantly moist blotting 
paper. 

After a period of three days in this environment the 
embryonic masses had become quite fluid. They were soon 
completely desiccated. 

The results indicate that freshly deposited pale western 
cutworm eggs will not complete incubation and hatch at 33° C. 
regardless of the level of relative humidity. The non-absorp¬ 
tion of the egg yolk indicates that most of the embryos were 
probably dead prior to stage H of the 30° C. key. The fact 
that the embryonic head capsules showed wrinkling at this 
same time also indicated that the death of the embryo had 
taken place. 

The results of the succeeding test show that eggs will 
hatch normally at 30° 0. after a period of three and one-half 
days at 35° C. However, embryos which have been exposed to 
this temperature for a period of seven days or more are not 
likely to hatch normally. 

As expected eggs develop at 35° C. at a rate very close 
to that for 30° C. up to the point where the embryo begins to 
deteriorate. The embryo completes morphological development 
at 33° C. but there seems to be some interference with a

physiological process. This interference must occur sometime 
between three and one-half and seven days. It is doubtful if 
the embryo deteriorated as a result of desiccation because 
the yolk was still in a fluid state at the time of death* 

Eggs will not develop at 40° C., nor will partially 
developed embryos complete development at this temperature. 

SOME EFFECTS Off INCUBATING- EGGS AT 2° C. AND 5 ° C. 

Three different tests were conducted at both 2° C. and 
5° C. with freshly deposited pale western cutworm eggs. These 
tests were carried out at temperatures of 2-1° C. and 5-0.2^° C 
Check groups of eggs for both tests incubated normally at 30 ° C 
and showed an average hatch of 86 per cent. 

In the first test three groups of eggs each were 
exposed to 2° C. and a similar three groups were stored at 
5 ° C* This test was an attempt to determine whether undevel¬ 
oped eggs ’would partially or completely develop at these 
temperatures* Periodic egg dissections were made. The 
observations are recorded in Table I.

An attempt was made to determine if there was any period 
of time that newly laid eggs could be exposed to either 2° C. 
or 5° 0. and still complete development after being transfer¬ 
red to a more favourable temperature. 

Five groups of 50 freshly deposited eggs were exposed to 
2° C. for periods of one, two, four, eight, and 16 days 
respectively. Five similar groups were subjected to 5° C. for 
the same periods of time. At the end of the exposure period 
each group was transferred to 30° C. where observations were 
taken and recorded as in Table II. Control groups of eggs 
developed normally at 30° C.

The third group of tests at 2° C. ana 3 ° C. utilized 
partially developed eggs. Two series of 200 eggs each were 
incubated at 30° C* for five days. The embryos then showed 
slight pigmentation of the mandibles but no colouration of 
the head capsule. One group of 200 eggs was now moved to 
2° C. and the other to 3° C. Observations were made on both 
series to determine whether partially developed eggs will 
complete development at 2° C. or at 3 ° C. The observations 
made from periodic egg dissections are recorded in Table 
III.

When the 30 per cent hatch level had been reached in each 
test series, 30 of the remaining eggs in each test were moved 
to 23° C. Of the eggs which had completed development at 
2° C., 7 6 per cent hatched. The 3° 0. test eggs showed a 
hatching percentage of 88 per cent after removal to 23° C. 
Contact moisture was provided the eggs on being transferred to 
the higher temperature. The test eggs had previously been 
stored without the addition of contact moisture. 

Although the data shows that freshly deposited pale 
western cutworm eggs will not completely develop at either 
2° C. or 3° C. the indications are that embryological devel¬ 
opment will progress further at 3° C. than it w T ill at the 
lower temperature. Once development has reached its limit 
in either temperature, the eggs will not complete development 
at temperatures which normally favour incubation. The eggs 
deteriorate quickly after being transferred to the higher 
temperature. 

Eggs which have developed to the five-day stage at 30 ° C. 
will complete development, and at least 30 per cent of them 
will hatch, at a temperature of either 2° C. or 3° 0. These 
eggs require a longer period to complete development at 2° C. 
than they do at 3° C. 

Of the unhatched eggs in 2° C. and 3° 0. when the 30 per 
cent larval emergence point had been reached, very high

percentages hatched, when the eggs were removed to 25° C. 

The tests show that fully developed pale western cutworm 
eggs will hatch without the addition of contact moisture at 
2° C. or 3° C. 

Indications are that undeveloped eggs may he stored at 
both 2° C• and 5° C. for periods of one, two or four days and 
still successfully complete development when removed to 30° C. 
After an eight-day period at 2° C. the percentage of eggs that 
develop normally in the higher temperature is very low. No 
eggs were able to withstand a l6-day exposure to 2° C. and 
develop normally. 

However, the eggs which were exposed to 5° C. for eight 
days showed no unusual effect when transferred to 30° C. A 
small percentage of eggs withstood a lo-day exposure at 5° C. 
and developed normally at the higher temperature.

SOUfl EFFECTS OF 3 ALOW FREEZES Tm lo_^.TUi.A3 03 33^33 Oh EAT 

A single series of groups of undeveloped eggs was exposed 
to temperatures of -J?° C., -10° C., -15° G., and -20° C. for 
periods of one, two, four, eight and 16 days. The various 
groups were then moved to the 30° C. room. Check eggs were 
incubated at J>0° C. and showed an average hatch of 84 per cent. 

The results are recorded in Table V. 

Freshly deposited pale western cutworm eggs may be stored 
for a period of at least two days at -5° C. and successfully 
complete development after being removed to 30° C. When eggs 
remain at -j?° C. for a period of four days prior to incubation 
at 30° C., the percentage of eggs which hatch normally is 
reduced by approximately per cent. Most of the eggs which 
fail to hatch deteriorate soon after being transferred to 
30° C. At the same time a few of these eggs showed embryos 
which became distorted from the normal as the developmental 
period progressed. The proportion of distorted embryos is 
much larger in eggs which were exposed to -5° C. for an eight- 
day period. This period also showed a greatly decreased 
percentage of hatch. 

When eggs are stored at -10° C. a low percentage hatches 
even if the storage period is only one day. After four days

or more at -10° C. the number of eggs developing successfully 
at 30° C. approaches zero. Any period between one and eight 
days at -10° C. results in a large number of distorted 
embryos. However, the majority of these eggs deteriorate 
before an identifiable embryo has developed. 

Exposure to -13° C. for one day prior to incubation at 
30 ° C. results in a very low percentage hatch and a high 
proportion of distorted embryos. When this storage period 
is increased to two or more days both the percentage of 
hatch and the number of distorted embryos decreases. After 
an eight-day exposure to -13° C. the majority of the eggs 
deteriorate at 30 ° C. 

No eggs completed development after exposure to -20° C. 
for one or more days. A few distorted embryos resulted when 
the period at -20° G. was one day, but when the exposure 
period was increased to tv^o or more days, only deteriorated 
eggs were observed.

DISTORTED UiBKYOS 

Fig. 8 shows two of the distorted embryos caused by 
exposing undeveloped eggs to 2° C. for eight days before 
moving them to 30° C. A normal fully developed embryo is 
also shown. A large variety of distortions have been 
observed in these embryos. Mouth parts, larval eyes, head 
capsule, thoracic legs and abdomen are all subject to malfor¬ 
mation. 

Although most of these embiyos are dead when dissected 
out of the egg the individual structures have usually completed 
development, even though they may have been subject to distor¬ 
tion. The mandibles may be located well apart but they will 
usually be fully pigmented. Malformed abdomens are always 
pigmented and possessed of setae and spiracles. Many of these 
embryos are completely lacking in one or more anatomical 
characters. 

It is possible that certain essential enzymes or hormones 
are inhibited wholly or partially by the influence of 2° C. 
and other low temperatures. These compounds may be responsible 
for the cell differentiation which, if not carried out correctly

in tli© early embryo, results in the monsters and distortions 
observed in the tests. 

Possibly the cause of embryo distortion at 2° C. and 
5° 0. differs from that of embryos at sub-zero temperatures. 

The monsters caused by exposure to the above freezing temper¬ 
atures may be caused by differential development, ie., 
certain cells in the early embryo are able to develop in the 
usual manner while others fail to function normally at these 
low temperatures. This differential development probably 
occurs during the exposure period and then continues when the 
eggs are transferred to the higher temperature. 

The distorted embryos caused by exposure to below freezing 
temperatures may be caused by a different influence. Although 
eggs may not freeze in a particular below zero temperature, 
there would be a chilling effect on the embryo. The lower the 
temperature the eggs were exposed to, or the longer the eggs 
were exposed at a specific temperature, the greater the 
influence of the chilling effect on the embryo. It is unlikely 
that any ernbryological development took place in the below 
freezing temperature but the chilling might be sufficient to 
cause distortion of the embiy o after it is renoved to the 
warmer temperature and has begun to develop. If the undevel¬ 
oped eggs suffered sufficient chilling, either because of a

prolonged spell in a mildly freezing temperature, or a short 
spell in a very cold environment, the embryo would no doubt 
be killed and deteriorated eggs would result* 

Eggs which were exposed to 0° C* for a prolonged period 
still produced a high percentage of normal larvae after being 
transferred to 30° C. The reason for this normal development 
may be that the 0° C. temperature is too low for any differ- 
ential development to take place but at the same time it is 
too high for the chilling effect to be sufficient to influence 
the embryo, at least over a period of 63 days. This may be 
the reason why high percentage hatch and no distorted embryos 
resulted from exposure of eggs to this temperature* 

INFERTILE EGOS 


Some female moths deposited large numbers of eggs which 
were 100 per cent infertile even though males had had access 
to the females* These moths had been kept at the same envi¬ 
ronmental temperatures 24 hours a day* As previously described, 
an eight hour period at 30° C. followed by a 16 hour period at 
3° C. was sufficient to stimulate copulation. This resulted 
in almost 90 per cent fertile eggs being deposited*

In tiie field it is very unlikely that females would 
lay large percentages of infertile eggs because of a similar 
lack of copulation stimulation. There are bound to be 
sufficient fluctuations in temperature to ensure the deposi¬ 
tion of fertile eggs. 


THE CRITERION OF FULLY DEVELOPED EGGS 


The usually accepted criterion of fully developed pale 
western cutworm eggs has been the deep blue-purple colour 
which the eggs acquire during the period of development. Eggs 
in this condition are generally thought to be in condition to 
hatch. In the course of the experiments it was found that 
even at 30 ° 0. blue-purple eggs would not hatch for a day or 
two. As the developmental temperature is lowered this period 
between the acquiring of the colour and the time of hatching 
lengthens. When eggs were incubated at 20° C. this period 
was found to be eight or nine days, and at 15° C. the inter¬ 
val became approximately 20 days. Therefore it would seem 
that blue-purple eggs may or may not be ready to hatch.

FUTURE I1W3STIGATI0NS 


Several tests, especially those dealing with emhryological 
development at the below freezing and slightly above freezing 
temperatures, will be repeated 'when additional eggs become 
available. Some work on the effect of these low temperatures 
on morphologically developed eggs is under way at the present 
time. 

Additional work will be undertaken to determine the 
reasons for distortion of embryos by temporary egg storage at 
low temperatures. ‘This will entail a detailed cytological 
study of the embryo. It may be possible to establish the 
exact periods at various temperatures which will affect cell 
differentiation at the time organogeny is taking place. 

A single combination of temperatures within a 24 hour 
period which is favourable to the deposition of fertile eggs 
in the laboratory has been established. Other combinations 
will be investigated. The effect of the various temperature 
combinations on fecundity will also be studied* 

Arbitrary criteria of embryologieal development have 
been established. Attempts mil be made to apply these data 
in field studies. The failure of forecast outbreaks to 
materialize may be partially explained by the fact that undevel¬ 
oped eggs will not complete development after fairly short 
periods of e:xposure to 2° C. or below freezing temperatures.

SmVMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 


The late development of the embryo of the pale western 
cutworm, A&rotis orthogonia Morr., as viewed through a 
binocular dissecting microscope is described. The effect 
of median temperatures on the rate of development is reported. 

A descriptive key to the rate of development at 30 ° C. has 
been proposed. This temperature is shown to be the optimum 
for incubation of pale western cutworm eggs. The various 
effects of temperature may prove useful in determining the 
reasons w T hy forecast outbreaks have sometimes failed to mate¬ 
rialize. 

The effect of temporary egg storage at temperatures from 
3 ° 0 , to -20° C. on future development are shovm. Several of 
these temperatures have proven unsuitable for egg storage. 

Eggs from both laboratory reared and field collected moths 
are used in the experiments. It is shown that eggs from both 
sources will develop at the same rates. It may be concluded 
from these tests that no period of diapause is required by 
embryos of the pale western cutworm.
