STATSI4ENT OF PROBLEM 

An occupation which sooks professional status ’ijust have ct^rtain 
characteristics not co?a<son to all types of work. A profession is 
a calling in which one professes to ha^s acquired so'i© special 
knowledge used to instruct, guide, or ad-'/iso others^or to serve 
thorn in so ie way. This bo iy of specialised Icnowledi^o and skill is 
not possessed by parsons outside of the profession. V/hile 
professional people desire economic and social security, thoir uain 
emphasis should bo on public service. Professional grovrth while in 
sorvice is necessary to the maintenance of high prof ssional status. 
Following are listed the characteristics of a profession as 
discussed by Heavia and Judd in The Teacher and Educational 
Administration 

Fi'etraiviiiig Selection 
adecpiate specialized training 
Fernianenc© of membership 
Ki’fective professional organization 

Sufficient remuneration to provide social and econolic security 
Practices governed by ethical principles 
Profeselonal organ of coKEiunication 

Profeesional meetings for the discusoion of common problems 
It is obvious from glancing at this list of characteristics that 
all problems related to Canada*s teaching personnel affect either 
directly or irjdiroctly the professional status of teachers. )nly brief

roforencea will be made in this thesis to adequate teacher 
selection and training, although high standards of both selection 
and training are the first ossontialQ to the 'laintenanco of a 
high professional status* Tlie reader is ref or r id to the thesis 
by R.E* Pettifor on Selection and Tralrdng, which was vjritten 
imder the same 0*H:.A. Study. SliiiarXy little wSJl b© said in 
this thesis about the remuneration necessary for the economic and 
social secsirlty of Oanadiau teachers* 'i?he reader vmy refer to the 
thesis by T.D* Baker on the Social and Economic Statens of Teachers. 

The purpose of this thosis is to consider the prestige and 
professional groirrth of Canadian teachers as shown in the G.S.A, 

SttAdy questiomiairos* ^drst, an analysis will be '^aade of the 
qaestioraiaire ansvrers which ©zpress opinions on the teaching 
profession held by various groups of people. Then, suggestions 
for raising the prostige of the profession will be disd-^ssed. Tliis 
will bo followed by ait aitialyeis of the reasons giv^n by stidenta 
and teachers for entering the toaching profession, and a brief 
consideration of significant criticisms of the profession. Having 
dealt with public and sti-sdcnt opinion of the teaching profession 

will turn froH prestige to the professional activities of teachers 
in service. Next we will discuss permanence of membership in the 
teaching profuesion* Prestige and professional growth are to a 
profession intangible essentials, difficult to raeasure and t*o 
evaluate. It is hoped that this thesis will give sole indication 
of the professional status enjoyed by toiadian teachers and offer 
some suggestions for its improvement*

mmioua studies 

i^estig© and professional grovmi of teachers do not soom to have 
been popular topic® for adtieational roseareh* Most t@3dibooks on 
©^(cation, lio^r©ver, devote at least on© ©haoter to pions 'loralizing 
on dosirable attitudes and actions of teachers within the profession, 
and on desirable attits*?d©a of the public to the professian* Prestige, 
dapondont on rgany factors, is a difficjult thing to ♦ioasure obJectlv©l,y. 
Professional grotrth is equally difficult to evaluate, and yet it is 
©Dsential to a high level of professional states* Several Investigations 
have been conducted on in-s;Tvice teacher training• However professional 
growth should nmilt trem professional activities not necessarily 
included in an in-eervic© training prograa. There so©^ to b© relatively 
fevr Canadian stiidies on prestige eind professional grovrth, 

Iji an article ^Social Status of Occupations in Ofemada’"* in 
C?a:iadlan Journal of Faycholo^gr, June IpUj, Jacob Tucksan describes 
Deog a^id Paterson*s 1946 study of the Svoolal ranlc of twonty-fiv© 
occupations in Minneapolis and hia own 194? repetition of thc^ study 
in Montreal* In both Minrioapolis and Montreal the elcfientary school 
teacher was ratc.*d in eighth place from the top, end th© superintendent 
of schools was rated fourth in Montreal and fifth in Min?ieapolis* 

Those occupations rating higher than the elesuontary school teacher in 
Canada wore physioiasi, banker, lawyer, superintondont of schools, civil 
engineer, captain, foreign missionary* Those rating lower wore 

machinist. Insurance agont, electrician, farmer, grocer, mail carrier, 
carpenter, travelling salesman, pluraber, motorman, soldier, barber.

Dr. Staplfis states that the average rural teacher reads less than 

tvso professional books per yeari and what little reading she does 

is usually the reaiilt of the personal, spesific recommendatiQn of 

the inspoctcir. A lasting result of reading rxiust grow out of the 

thi"oklng, diswssion and aotion which it inspires, and this does not 

occur where teacher's are isolated. Nearly all the t achers subscribed 

to one or iiiore professional journals* These ishould contribute to 

profoasioTial grovrth, although aova© teachers leaned too heavily on the 

educational devices contained iti tlieu. licmibarship in the Teachers* 

Federation was iiade compulsory in 1^44 and Dr. Staples says, ‘*The 

position of tlio individual hi the profession should bo groatiy

pov/ers over its Houbers and ample fitnds for maintaining high standards

Dr* staples finds the Ontario iu-aervio© program of training 
inadequate bv^oause of such difficulties as the narrow conception of 
the rural teac/jer^s job, low salaries, rapid cliange in teaching 
personnel, geographical difficulties, lack of means for msasRoring 
teacher success, lack of offlciai aiid public rocogyiition, indifference 
or opposition of iiispeotora, and siiiaiX rural administrative usiits* An 
in-service training program for n?ral taachcre ohould bo volimtary,

rise to a sense of significance and responsibility in i#iieh every

Dr^ Staples lists basic conditions necessary for effective 
in-servie*- rural training as (1) stable tntarosted teaching personnel 
(2) a IJorraal School willing and able to asaiiiae loadcrahip in rural 
education ovor a lid-d® area and (^) field workers or Inspectors free 
to devote their energy to understanding and co-ordinstir'g the efforts 
of teachers and other agonciea which ;my eontri'bi^ta to ©djicatlon for 
effective rural living. 

Lookii'ig to tho future he sayss 

Tm closing of or^all schools, the ©mploynent of narried 
women, tho >iiore liberal courses of study, the tendency toward 
eqiml oay for e<n;ial work, the eaphasi© on th® iniportano© of 
education which has arisen throagh the v;ar, th© increasing 
disf??.i9slon of educational proble»a© through tho radio and 
press -—all giving riji© to an iuproveieiit in the 
position of th© profession In the eyos of the public and 
the eyes of its own members, 5 

jJr. Staples finds that in-service training for Ontario n^al teachers 
is inadequate, but he looics forward to Improvement in in-iSc-Tvic© 
education and of the prestige of th© teaching profession. 

^ A ihnctlQnal Frograatue of Teacher Education, as developed in 
the %racu6© Study, provision was mads for definite courses for ac3nior 
education students on the profoeslonal rooponsibilities cf tli© 
secondary seliool toacher and on education as a profession. Under the 
heading ^Vl'^rofossionai :;?espei:3sibiliti©s of tlie Teacher in th© Modem 
Secoridai'y School** wc‘r® eoiisidered such topics as the teacher'e admini¬ 
strative rolationships, accepted principles of administration and 
supervision, V-ie mea»iing of democracy in adniinistratlon, the teacho# *3

problems as the nature of a profession, the professional status of 
teaching, tsimovor and tenure of teachers, teachers* salaries and 
living atatidarils, teachers* retireLient and p^sion systems, professional 
organimtions, and ethics of th© profession, ^ich courses in pre- 
oervico teacher training should provide a good foundation of knowledge 
and att5,tudes con duel vo to mora professional activities and growth when 
teachers are actually in service. Too frequently teacher training 
institutions do not give sta-Jdents this foundation. 

In The Ii^ducation of Teachers, a report of the Jlichigan Cooperative 
Teacher ?5ducation Study edited by David Trout, the professional 
grovrth of teachers 5.8 consldcrod. Factors essential to such growth 
are glv^ as faith in the values of ©dacatlon in a democratic society, 
self-confidence, the habit of analysS^s atid synthesis, democratic 
administration, and a challenge-problem situation. Activities within 
the school wh.lch oontribAte to profeoaional gro^fth of teachers are 
faculty meetings, post-school conferences, school visitation, cooperative 
teaching, use of professional libraries, pre-school conferences, 
©icperlmentation, exchaxige teaching, home visits, supervision, and the 
use of eonsuitents. '.Che report discusses the us© made of these 
activities in Michigan• Various tynea of interschool conferences 
contrlbi:ite to professional growth as well. Profossional literature and 
the Irnportance of administrative officers in the professional development 
of teachers ar© also discussed. 

A survey is made of the means used by Michigan teacher training 
institutions to evaluate teachers in training and teacher graduates. 
Professional growth is considered part of the responsibility of the 
toaohor training insti'fcution. Tli© Michigan Report recommends tliat 
visitation of teachers be encouraged. Teachers* clinloa or campus

Personnel**, and the diffici^.lties of the general survey apply also 
to the individual theses* In spite of th© fact that this thesis 
deals T'dth opinion »iata, that subjective factors were not entirely 
absent from the tabulation of replies, that the groups epestionod 
eere not necessarily repressntativo, there are definite conclusions 
which appear over and over again. Their frequent repetition indicates 
reliability Just as s*arely as a statistically determined index. 

In. this thesis tliere are more questions used from th© Series G

age, Svjx, marital sta-his of those teachers answering it. Tlie Education

PUBLIC OPINION OF THE ’fmmim PROFESSION 

The prestige of any profession is determined by the opinions 
of that profession held by two groups of people^ the public and the 
members of the profession itself. This chapter will consider the 
opinion of the Cfeinadian public of the teaching profession, as 
Indlcatod in the O.L.A. queetlomiali’es. 

Let ua consider first the significant dalia in Tables II, III, 

IV and V. Three different groups of people v/ere asked to rank farmers, 
dentists, banicere, teachers, lawyers, dry goods merchants, electrical 
engineers and hotel managers with respect to eight given traits. This 
question vjas answered by 475 high school sfeidonts, 6 B 5 teachers in 
training, and by ^ student veterans who were formerly tee chars. 
Unfortunately the percentage ©f retimed c^iestionnaires from stud^t 
veterans was low, and those who Mid reply may have been biased in their 
opinions* The returns from high school students were good, except 
for the provinces of Ontario, Nova Scot5.a, and Hew Brunswick, from 
which there were no returns. The high school opinion should bo repre¬ 
sentative inasimoh as the qaestionnaires were distributed and collected 
by the principals of schools. The opinions of the teachers In training 
should also be fairly representative, beesause these people were 
presumably all interested in teaching and the questionnaires were 
probably distributed by instructors through regular classes. However, 
the opinions of high school students and teachers in training sometimes 
seem to be lacking In maturity and good judgment! and certainly the

tdachers in training appear extremely idealistic regarding their 
prospective profession* IVhll© the wording of the question itself 
did not indicate a prime interest in the teaching profession, the 
entire questionnaire did, and this may have biased some of those 
answering the question* 

The average rank given to teachers was relatively high on all 
the traits given* All three groups, high school students, teachers 
in training, and student veterans, place teaching in the position 
of greatest usefulness in the community, although, of the eight 
characteristics, the yearly income which a teacher should receive 
is given lowest rating by the high school students, second lowest 
by the teachers in training, and third lowest by the student veterans* 
The good character of the teacher receives the second highest rating 
by all throe groups, and personality is rated high* Yet the respect 
received from the comnojinity is given a lower rating, ©specially by 
experienced teachers* It appears that either those answering were 
prejudiced, or that usefulness in the coimmjinity, good character and 
personality do not determine public respect* The idealism of the 
teachers in training may be seen in the fact that in every quality 
more than forty percent of the answers placed teaching in first or 
second place* The student veterans show less enthusiasm in their 
judgments* Over one third of the high school students placed their 
interest in teaching as first or second place*

TABLE IX SCHOOL TRUSTEES OH TEAOHHRS* SALARIES 















What, in dollars and cents, does the Canadian public think 
teachers are worth? The median annual salary of the Canadian 
teacher (excepting Ontario and Quebec) in 1959 was ^^4, in 194^ 
was $1057# and in 1946 was II 5 O 8 . Let us compare this with what 
teachers and business men think teachers* salaries shoi:ild be. 

Table VI shows what teachers in service think the median salary 
should have been in 1945, and what the minimum salary should bo 
when the coat of living index is 100, Almost on© half, h&f^ of 
those answering, thought that in 1945 the median salary should 
have been betv/een |1,000 and $l,p30. The same number thought it 
should have been hetimen ^1,600 and |2,000, This leaves 8^ v^ho 
thought the median salary should have been over 12000, The opinions 
of business men are summarized in Table VIII, Thor® are a smaller 
number of business men answering, and the question was differently 
v^orded. The business men were asked vihat they thought the average 
teacher’s salary should be when the cost of living is to 60 ^ 
above normal. About ^2% of them said between II 5 OO and §2000, 

Almost one-fifth indicated a salary above $2000 for ©lementarjr 
teachers. About ^2% indicated salaries betvyeen $2000 and 0000 
for secondary school teachers. Table IX summarizes the opinions 
of school trustees. Almost all of them advocated a minimm salary 
of not more than $1500 for an elementary school teacher when the 
cost of living is 100, Most of them stated $2000 as the maximuia, 
V/hen the increased cost of living is considered, it appears that 
the business men, the school trustees, and the teachers are in

fairly close agreement on what teachers* salaries should be. 

A large percentage of the replying teachers, 84^, believe that 
the mini&aAm salary isdien the cost of living is 100 should be 
$1500 or less. Another 15^ would place it between $l600 and 
§2000. Slightly over fifty per cent believe that #100 or less 
should be the salary increment for each year of University training 
beyond grade tvrelvo. About 15^ believe that it should be over 
1200. 

The salaries of teachers are a partial indication of their 
prestige. All grosAps expressing opinions seemed to think that 
teachers should be more poorly paid than members of many other 
professions. Teachers need to be convinced of their own value 
and they need to have confidence in their ovm. abilities before 
the public will give recognition in the form of high salaries 
and good pi?blic opinion. Teachers need also to be prepared to 
give service worthy of professional salaries and high professional 
status. 

Table X indicates the opinion of high school students on 
the interest of their community in the school. Because this 
question is very subjective it is surprising to find clear-cut 
opinion expressed. Only 5.7^ of the 4^2 students felt that the 
people in their cormawnity co-operated fully with the school or 
looked for opportunities to bring about improvements, while 67% 
believed that the cormaunity had no interest or only casual interest

TABLE xvn HOW TO ihprovr; 0MJADA*S TEAOHIHO PttaSOm^lEL 







I 










Tables XI, XII, XIII, and XIY express the opinions of various 
groups of people on how the prestige of the teaching profession 
might be increased. Tables XI, XII, and XIII are siiraiaries of 
open questions from which the person sumtmrizing attempted to 
obtain some uniformity of answers. Out of 69 replies from baainess 
men 71 said definitely that the teaching profession lacked prestige. 

It is significant that teachers in service, student veterans and 
business men believed that higher salaries, graator sconomic 
security, emd higher standards of both selection and training 
were of first importance in increasing the prestige of the profession. 
This is sound inasmuch as special skill and Icnowladge are essential 
for professional status. Other suggestions of importance for 
increasing prestige are to organize stronger profeasional organizations, 
improve publicity, and oriforce a professional cod© of ethics. In 
Chapter VX w© shall consider tli© professional growth of teachers 
and their ideas of ethical condict, 

j^bles X¥ and X?1 give the causes suggested bjr student veterems, 
business men, and toaoliers for the teacher shortage* Low salaries 
are giv®i first place, • Business men and teachers indicate that 
there should be better standards of selection and training. 

High on the list of cause is the low prestige of the profesf3ion 
and the need for bett ;r public relations. 

Table XVII Is a nummary of answers to mi open qitestion to 
business men on what is wrong % 7 ith the teaching profession. Salaries, 
teacher selection and training are again in first position. Poor

publicity and low professional spirit were among many other weak¬ 
nesses mentioned* 

Tlie following qaotations will help give the spirit of many 

of the remarks on the questionnaires* 

‘^Teaching status must be raised so thao only fully qualified 
teachers are permitted to toach. Eventual aim should b© a 
university degree for every teacher* All other professions 
require it* not for one of the most important professions?** 

fTeaching is the lowest paid profession, tharfor© teaching 
standards had to be greatly reduced to keep the required number 
of teachers** 

*1 believe that the toaching profession should pay more 
attention to its public relations* **,*•members of the teach¬ 
ing profession have a story to tell ifhieh is just as good 
as any story which can be told by any other profession* 

V^liy don’t they get out and t©ll it? Instead of that they 
labor their own shortoominga and encourage averyone else 
to do the saae tiling** 

*A person has to ha^e tlie ability of the gods manage 
children of many of our modern hemas.^ 

Salairias are such that In general an ambitious man coimits 
hia family to a life of genteel poverty if he embraces teach¬ 
ing as a life work** 

^Kick out and keep out the drones and the duds.* 

*If the pres^rjt practice could be reversed and have the 
Kor'ual School graduates toach under supervision for at least 
the first year it would save a good many heartbreaks and 
perhaps some who would make good teachers from quitting** 

^Teachers as a group are too sensitive to oritioiam** 

*As a profession it seems as if education folk get into a 
deep rut* dany lose their broad point of view and lapse into 
a sort of mental coma* To overcome this travel should be 
encouraged and posaibly exchanges arranged with teachers of 
otVier countrios* Teachers sliould be encouraged to move from 
on© province to another and for this a standard examination 
should be set v;hich would qualify those passing it to do so* 

A Federal Department of Education would get an ali-over-Ctoada 
approach * ** 









•57- 


**A1i‘trac'fc people who will malco ili a 111*01111110 profossiori and 
make it worthifhile for them to improve their quallfioationa*” 

^Tlia solution, it seoma to me, is for the teachers to got 
avnay from their trade union ideas, their inaittenco that 
all teachers with the same length of service ohould be considered 
the sa:iQ, their Jealous efforts to keep evorybody in the saae 
mould of mssdioority. fliere should b© much greator attention 
paid to merit, with really attractive sfilfcljaries paid to teachers 
who oan demonstrate their fitness for the work#’* 

’*A shortcoming of the teaching profession is the lack of 
professional ressponsibility after getting professional 
recognition as bo negotiating salaries and bettor working 
conditions*” 

‘^Educate the public not look upon a teacher as a transient 
but make him to feel social equal to a doctor, lawyer, lainister 
or dentist#** 


Qonolualon 

The Oanadiaui public offered suggestions and oritioiems but 
generally thejr praised the teachers# Both teachers and the public 
believe that teaching is on© of the most ueaftil of public cervices, 
and also that teaching 5-3 low In prestige* fhey boliav© that 
salaries should be higher and standards of teacher selection and 
training should be raised* There is a feeling that professional 
organizations, professional pride and publicity are not as effective 
as they should be# ^fhil© sumraaries of questions do not indicate 
this directly, it seams raasonabla that the vagueness of public 
opinion and evidence of low prestige may be partly due to the great 
variety of performance of teachers themselves# There B.r@ no uniform 
standards of selection or training across CJanada or often much 
uniformity within a single province# Teachers of little fznowladge, 
skill and professional Judgment imay be more effective in pulling 
down the prestige of the profession than the fully qualified are 
in raising Perhaps an effective teachers* organization on a

national scale could help raise the prestige of the profession In 
the eyes of the public by maintaining high standards of public 
service* So long as teachers meet only barest minimum of standards 
set by provincial departments of edu.oation they cannot have the 
prestige, and respect from the public which is owing to a group 
of highly trained people.

OHAPTER V 


STODIS-'T OPINION OF THE TEAORINO PROFESSION 
Th« prestige of th© tsaching profession is partially shown 
in the attitudes of high school students and of teachers in training* 
Xhe high school students are in daily contact with teachers, and 
while their Judgment saay not always b® sound, they have a first hand 
opportunity to evaluate their teachers* professional knowledge and 
skill* Th® ability and attitudes of those high school students 
who urill themseivea become teachiers, and of those students now 
receiving teacher training, will be an important factor in raising 
or lowering the future professional status of toaohers* Their 
reasons for choosing teaching as their ooeupatlon, whether from 
ideals of social service or ideas of easy personal gain, are indicative 
of the prestige of the profession at the r)r©sent time* 

Table XVIII gives a suraiaary of reasons offered by teachers 
in training for selecting teaching as a vocation* always liked 
working with young poopie’* or ’^The job demands abilities, apti-tudes 
and interests that I possess** includes 62^ of the atis’^ers given* 

The other include such ramsons as acting on the advice of 

others, war-ting an easy lob, wanting a temporary position bofor© 
doing something else* It ia interesting to note that from Table XIX 
64^ of the answers from student veterans who are ro-entoring the 
teaching profession indicate Interest or ability or hariianltarlan 
ideals, while indicate a desire for easy work with gcjod financial 
returns* It is significant that lack of prestige is one of th© 
reasons listed for not re-entering the teaching profession* 

Among the teachers in training there seam to be two groups of

thinking, one ©xtreriely idealistic about the value of teaching, and 
one setiking as good a living as possible with as little effort as 
possible* Although the students veterans may be interested in the 
social service nature of teaching they seem much less idealistic 
than do the teachers in training* It is noted that in both groups 
there is a large number who are not interested in teaching as a 
public service* 

Table XXII shows tho reasons offered by teachers in service 
for selecting teaching as a vocation* The percentage who entered 
because of fondness for childresi, susposed teaching ability, or 
desire to serve humanity is 68^, which is only slightly higher than 
the corresponding percentages for teachers in training and for 
student veterans* Tlie remainder of the answers did not indicate 
ideals of public service* The fondness for children is mentioned 
so frequently that on© wonders if sometimes it is a conventional 
answer without laucli meaning* 

Table XXfll sinamariaes the reasons offered by high school 
st-idents for wanting to enter the teaching profession* Answers 
1 and 4, those indicating a desire to use abilities for public 
service represent 47 % of the answers* Another 475^ include ansifers 
2,5,5,6,9,10, and 11, which indicate a more selfish interest* 

A similar situation is seen in the evidence in the latter part of 
Tabl e XXIV^ * 

Many persona enterirzg the teaching profession state that 
they are doing so because qualifications are low or easy to obtain, 
because they are interested in long holidays and easy work, or because

it offers te^nporary enployriient. This is not good enough for a 
profession wiiioh la interoated in maintaining the good opinion of 
the public and ©njo/ing the prestige due professional people* 

Many mention as reasons for not entering the profession, low 
prestige, lack of social status, lack of freedom, arid little 
recognition* People seem to think that teaching should be the most 
inportant work in the community, but actually they do not a©^ 
to believe that It is. One m.y be idealistic about the service 
performed by teachers, but teaching is atill lacking in prestige. 

Teachers In training, as shown in Table XXV, mention short 
hours and long holidays m an advantage of teaching almost as often 
as the opportunity to be of use in society. Of signifieanoe in 
the disadvantages named is the lack of appreciation by the general 
public and by paramts. 

Tables IDCVI and XJCVil 3u.nii7iariz© the opinions of high school 
students on tuaohore and schools, humber one weak point of teachers 
Is that they lack teaching ability, and number one suggestion 
regarding teachers is that they be better trained# With the exception 
of unpleasant personality and lack of interest in young people, 
lack of skill and knowledge are the main criticisms made of teachers. 
And yet these are the first characteristics of a profession. 

High school students have not the training and experience necessary 
to Tsake sound evaluations of teachers, but their opinions of 
teachers cannot be under-rated in their effect on the thinking 
of the general public.

Ooncl’aaion 


The evsluatlon of teaching skill, whether in training or in 
service, is one of the most difficult and moat iraportant problem* 
facing educator* today* There is little agreement or objectivity 
on teacher ©valuation even among men with the experience and 
training of inspectors and suparintandent* of schools* Because 
there are no adequate objective standards for evaluating teaching 
skill, and bocauso entrance and training qualifications for certifi¬ 
cation are frequently low, the opinions of various people on 
evatuation mast be considered, and the opinions of presumably less 
Informed people cannot bo assumed to be erroneous* The prestige 
of the teaching profession depends on ffjibjective factors. It 
cannot b© measured in dollars and cents, or in years of training, 
or in percentages of examination passes. Sjich objective conditions 
may contribute to tho efficiency of teachers, but prestige seems 
to bo determined by the opinion of the general public of the ’ 
vjorth of the job or service which teachers are actually performing*

PROFESSIONAL GROWTH OF TEACHERS IN SERVICE 
Professional stagnation is the worst sin of professional men 
and women* Not only must they perform their work efficiently, 
but they must be continually Improving their skill, knowledge and 
judgment in order to give bettor service* They have a important 
responsibility to the community and as such should be professionally 
organized with standards of ethioal conduct and means for the inter¬ 
change of knowledge and ideas* Professional growth may be achieved 
by means of teachers* meetings, reading, travelling, attending 
summer schools and special olassess, emd by contributing to the 
activities of professional organizations* Let us consider the 
evidence in the 19^ 0*E*A* questionnaires of the professional 
activities end growth of Canadian teachers* 

Over 95% ^ teachers in service who answered questionnaires 
stated that they belong to a professional organization* Although 
in some provinces membership is not compulsory, only a very small 
number failed to belong* This percentage of membership may not be 
representative inasmuch as professional organizations were largely 
responsible for the distribution of these questionnaires, and they 
may have sent them to their own members* Membership does not imply 
active participation* Twenty percent of those ansi*rering thought 
that professional membership should not be compulsory. This may 
be a reaction against compulsion, or it may indicate the lack of 
recognition that in the interests of both teachers and the public 
a professional organization requires one hundred per cent membership*

Qaastion 20 of Sorias G, suramarized In Table rai , asked 
teachers in service to mark as ethical or unethical five practices 
which wore definitely considered unethical in the National Code 
of Ethics adopted in 19^7 by the Canadian Teachers* Federation* 

Over eight per cent did not consider it unethical to underbid a 
fellow teacher in order to obtain a job| ^7^ did not cons5,der 
it necessary to adhere to a salary sohedulei 21^ saw nothing wrong 
in breaking a contract to accept a better positionj 11^ believed it 
ethical to criticize a fellow teacher who was not present; and 
55 ^ thought it ethical to accept money for tutorir^ or coaching 
a pupil in a subject taught by another member of their school staff. 
What is the significance of these repltasf. There may have been 
some error in summariaing replies inasmuch as an answer left blank 
was considered a negative reply* This procedure may not have been 
justified in all instances* While teachers indicated strongly 
that there should bo a recognized code of ethics for teachers, 
it appears that either they were unacquainted with the National 
Code of Ethics adopted by the Canadian Teachers Federation, or 
they were not in agreement with all items in it* Probably they 
were not acquainted with local or provincial codes of ethics, 
for there is repetition of principles in most teachers* codes of 
ethics. The fact that over one third of the teachers believed it 
ethical to ignore salary schedules may be due to lack of any feeling 
of professional unity, or because many teachers have had no experience 
with salary schedules* There sefras little doubt that teachers 
not only need to be make aware of ethical procedures, but that

profeseional organizations must find some way of enforcing ethical 
practices if they are to maintain professional status in the eyes 
of the public* Teachers today tend to be too individualistic to 
offer as a group either the best service or to warrant the highest 
level of prestige* 

Table XXXII indicates the number of teachers* or professional 
meetings attended by teachers in service during a school year* 

The question was poorly answered by teachers* Of 520 questionnaires 
returned^ between 72 and 199 answered the various parts of the 
question® Teachers* conventions received the heaviest rating* 
fhe **none** rating is low* It appears that those teachers who did 
not attend any teachers* meetings during the year neglected to 
answer the question* This avipposition must be considered in evaluating 
the significance of the answers given* 

It seems reasonable that during the school year there should 
be a minimum of ten staff meetings* Approximately kofa of those 
answering attended fewer than nine sts-ff meetings during the year* 
Abouti4li|llf the teachers answering attended one or two meetings 
with superintendents or inspectors* It seems reasonable that a 
local teachers* association meet at least ten times during the school 
year* Approximately 85% ‘^h® teachers answering attended fewer t

ioolation, or they are not professionally minded, and tend to 
consider teaching merely a job to done in their own individtml manner* 

By far the greatest frequency of meetings attended is the one or 
two level and there is reason to believe that no meetings at all 
merits a still higher frequency* 

Table KXXIII is an attempt to indicate how much professional 
reading is done by Oanadian teachers In a twelve month nariod. About 
one half the answers indicated 5 OO pages or less and about half 
indicated over 500* The magazine of a provincial teachers* association 
is roughly 5^0 pages per year* It is doiibtfhl If teachers read 
much more than the e^xulvalent of their own magazine during the 
year* Approximately one half of the responses indicate that teachers 
read 1000 or more pages of 0 d,ucational boimd books during the 
year* This would be about three or four books* Several of the 
answers indicate that this reading was required for special courses 
or summer session preparation* Regardless of the motivation, 
there Is indication of some professional reading* It must b© noted 
that 2 ^ out of the ^20 teachers failed to answer this question 
at all* 

Tables XXXI? and XXX? give an eatlmat© of the amoimts of money 
spent by teachers on travel and on educational courses In one year* 

In 19^5 three quarters of the teachers replying spent one hundred 
dollars or less on travel* In 19^6 and 19 ^J this number went dom 
to 6 l %0 indicating that teachers spent slightly more on travel. 

Inasmuch as teachers generally go home for Christmas, Master and 
pajpt of the sutamer holidays, and a limited amount of travelling can 
be done on one hundred dollars. It seems doubtful if travel contributes 
lauch to the professional growth of Oanadian teachers* From comparing

the Information in Tabloa XXXIV and XXXV It appears that Canadian 
toaohars spend more money on aammor schools and educational ooursea 
than on travel. In many oases attendance at summer school la a 
prerequisite for special or permanent certification, and is not 
necessarily evidence of a desire for or interest in professional 
growth on the part of the individual teacher. Between and 64^ 
of the teachers replying spent one hundred dollars or less during 
the year on educational courses. Less than one third spent two 
hundred and fifty dollars or more. The majority of teachers neglected 
to answer this question at all, possibly because it did not affect 
them personally* Table XXXVI indicates how many summer sessions 
have been attended by those teachers answering the questionnaires. 

Over have attended four or fewer sessions* Almost ZBfo have 
attended five or more sessions. Those attending more than five 
probably did so because of their own interest rathor than because 
•they thought it necessary for permanent certification or to hold 
a position. It is also significant that about 240 out of ^20 did 
not answer this question. It Is well to remember, too, that the 
sampling of teachers used was probably slightly older and more 
experienced and professionally minded than the ^average** Canadian 
teacher, and that it contained a larger number of men. 

Oonclusion 

Tables XXX to XXXVI, inclusive, give a limited picture of the 
professional activities of Canadian teachers. Research data is 
incomplete and generally quantitative rather than qualitative. 

It la impossible therefore to give an accurate estimate of professional 
growth of Oanadisun teachers. However, the a'feailable evidence 
indicates that Canadian teachers are probably not verj professionally

Pamanonc© of mombershxp is nacassary to a profession* It is 
necessary to any unified group of people if they are to maintain 
high levels of professional skill and Imowledge and standards of 
professional judgment* There are relatively few changes of member¬ 
ship in established profesaionas and the high median age of professional 
people indicates holding power* This is not true of the teaching 
profession* where turnover of personnel is great and the medlein age 
is low. The figures from the files of the Alberta Teachers’ Association 
give the median age of Alberta teachers in 1959 27*5 y®£^Bs* 

Teachers’ Salaries and Quallfloatlons in Eight Provinces gives the 
median exparience of city teachers in 1959 sis 15*-? years, of one- 
room rural school teachers as 4*7 years, and the median for all schools 
as 7*7 years. Similar figures for 1946 are 17*7 years, 5*5 years, 
and 7*9 years respectively. Mr. W.T. Mel Fowler in hie 1948 
dissertation. Teacher Demand and Supply in Panada* states that in 
1947 , 8,215 teaching certificates iwere Issued. He estimates that 
because this is approximately ten per cent of th© total te?aohing 
population that there Is an annual turnover of ten per cent. Other 
provincial studios indicate a turnover of betvieen ten and twenty per 
cent* 

Many persona enter the teaching profcission with no intention of 
becoming permanent members* Table XiCXVII indicates that over one 
third of th© teachers in training answering questionnaires stated 
thoir Intention to teach five years or lees, v/hlle over one half intended 
to teach either permanently or for an indefinite period of time.

No distinotlon la laade in the table between the anawera of men and 
of women* Buoiriesa men were aaked if it waa in the Intereat of publio 
education to train teachers who intended teaching only a few yeara*. 

One half of those answering said one half said ''no*** Those 

who said ''yes" seemed to thinlc that there was no alternative so long 
as there was a shortage of teachers and it was desirable to have women 
in the profession* Those who said seaaed to think tliat men 

left as well as women, and that there was an alternative in increased 
salaries and better seleotlon and vocational guidance* A high rate of 
turnover lowers the prestige of the profession* It seems reasonable 
that with high standards of selection and laralning and good salaries 
not only the level of public service, but the holding power and the 
prestige of the profession would be Increased* Those business men 
indicating that nothing can be done to increase the holding power of 
the teaching profession are taking a short-term view of the situation* 

In order to Increase the prestige of the profession through achieving 
greater permanence of membership, w® must consider causes for withdrawal, 
and consider to what extent these causes may be removed* 

fable XXXIX summarises the causes for withdrawal from city t 
teaching staffs reported by superintendents of city schools* Unspecified 
reasons form the largest group* Itoriag® makes up of the total 
number of vdthdrawals in 19^7, or almost one third of those with 
reasons specified* This group is presumably made up of women* The 
second most important reason is retirement, and the third is leave 
of absence granted for study purposes* Over one tenth of the withdrawing 
teachers give the desire to enter another occupation as their reason

for leaving. 01 ty toaohors are generalIJr more highly selected than the 
other teachers, inasmuch as cities usually require higher standards 
of training and avideno© of succaosf’.J.l teaching experience. There¬ 
fore they cannot be considered repraaentative of all Canadian toaohere. 

Let us coneidar the extent to which these csu’ses for withdrawal 
can be removed or modified for the benefit of the teaching profession. 

Death is inevitable. Vdth certain exceptions, retirement at a certain 
age is desirable for both the teacher concerned and for the children. 

Leave for study purposes should be but a tauporar 3 r loss to the individual 
school system, more than compensated for later by the improved 
qualifications of the re”^rning teacher. Leave for illness is 
inevitable and in most instances temporary. Reasons for teachers 
desiring to enter other occupations should be given careful consideration.. 
The reason may be economic. Salaries should oertainljr be mads com¬ 
mensurate With a teacher*a training and ability, and they should be 
on a level with other professional services. OpportiAnities should 
also be provided for promotion and added re^ponaibiiity within the 
educational system. With a broadening idea of the role of education 
in modern society and its growing importance in the eyes of the 
public there is a need for many other positions than classroom, teaching. 

If the teacher seeks other employment because he is not suited to 
teaching, or he is definitely iminterested in it, it is probably 
beneficial to the profession to lose Mm. ^iMo reasons^W© specified 
in Table XXXIX for a large number of those leaving. An attempt 
should be mad® to discover what these reasons are so that ovary effort 
may be mad© to hold those people who are a credit to the profession.

The moat important specif5.ad reason for withdravral, mrriaga, v/ill 
bo conaiderod bolow* 

■ The criticism is frequently made that teaching can never have 
a high professional status or a low rate of turnover so long as its 
membership is composed largely of women whose professional interests 
are more temporary than those of men, and who automatically leave the 
profession when they marry# Teaching does have a larger percentage 
of youthful members than any other preofesslon, but the men do not 
seem much readier to stay with teaching than do the women^. The report 
Education^^Personnal Problems In Alberta* December 19^^, of the Alberta 
Po8t-¥ar Reconstruction Oomiiiitteo indicates (P# l4 ) that in 1939 
the typical (median) female teacher ms reaaining in the profession 
for %9 years and the typical nal© teacher for 7*9 years, which ia 
& difference of one and one half years* Table XbVI indicate© that 
there were about two and a fifth times as many feraale teacliers as 
male in Oaiiadian cities in 19^17# 19^0 there were over tliro® times 

as many* fh® Education Bulletin He* 3$ 1947# Teachers* Salaries and 
Qualifications in Eiglit Froyinoea form the Dominion Buromx of Statistics 
for 1946 lists women teachers t© 11#S4 men, or appro^lmiately 

three and one third times as many* In the two years previous the 
ration was about four to one* Th© ratios in Table XL¥I show an 
increase in the number of men* Table XLTII shows an increase in the 
number of ■■aarriad women teachers in 33 selected cities, from 1^0 in 
1950 to 116 In 1940, to 330 in 1947# ¥hil© tills shows a sharp increase 
during war years, it is still a small fraction of the total number 
of teachers* Similar inoreases in the number of married women teachers

are seen in Table XLVI. Provided that the wiftifare of the family is 
aBS’jrodjj, it eeS'iis a desirable trend to keep qualified exoerienoed 
women in the profession after they marry. Investigations in the 
United States have shown that married women are just as efficient, 
if not better, than single women in the classroomi and that they 
can contribute to the improvement of the profession through continued! 
interest, more permanent membership and greater raaturlty. 

het ws consider the attitudes of teachers and the 'Tublic toward 
’married women teaching. Table XL indioa-e® that about 85 ^ of the 
sampling of teachers in service believe tJiat a married woman teacher 
who is able to devote fall time to teaching duties should be allowed 
to practice her profession on eqrml terms with any other teacher. 
There were approximately 62 Berried women and I 65 single women in the 
group of 562 answering this questions. From Table XLI it appears 
that only one third of the business men would say *’yea*^ to the same 
question* Table XLII Indicates the? attitudes of city superintendents 
towards employing of married women teachers* Most women who marry 
during the school year retmain on the staff until the end of the year. 
Most appear to leave at the end of the year whether boluntarily or 
by request. Mora than half of the replies indicate that married 
women are not considered as applicants whan new appointments are being 
mads. About half Indicate that married raen are given preference 
over all other applicants. Maternity leave is granted to married 
women in ono third of the cities wfiere the question had arisen. 
Teachers in service were asked ’-diether they thought that the belief 
that a married woman should not teach, has had a detrimental effect

on the teaching profession* Table XL shows that over the DoTninion 
teachers are fairly evenly divided in their ooinion, although individual 
provinces were often weighted one way or the other• Because of the 
small number of replies from each province these differ emcee may not 
be significant* The discrepancy between ‘*y®8*’ answers in 

parts (a) and (b) of this question seems to iaaply that many teachers 
believe that marriage usually prevents women from devoting full time 
to teaching duties, or that at least nothing has been lost by not 
having their services* 

There seems to be a definite lack of agreeaent on the position 
of women in the teaching profession* Women are expected to become 
teachers and they are expected to marryi they are generally expected 
to ie ve tVie profession udien they do marry and yet they are frequently 
credited with the responsibility for high rat© of turnover, for low 
prestige and low professional status* It seems reasonable that if, 
where home duties do not interfere, qualified and experienced married 
women wore accepted as teachers the profession would benefit through 
their service and continued professional activities* It would also 
benefit from higher standards of seiGction and training and from 
improved economic conditions for both men and women* 

fables XLXII to XLfll Incluaivei give some interesting information 
on the age, sex, and marital status of members and prospective members 
of the teaching profession in Canada* It appears that in the sampling 
of teachers In training used, on® and on© half times as many women 
are being trained as men* ‘The women predominate in the age range 
twenty-one to thirty* The median age of the women is nineteen, while 
the median Age of the men is about twenty-one* Table XL I? shows the

age groupings of the aaispling of teachers in service who answered 
questionnaires. It is Interesting that here, too, there are one and 
one half ti:iies as many women as men. On® qiJiartsr of the teachers, 
whether male or female, whether single or married, are over forty- 
two years of age. The median age for all but single females is in 
the mid-thirties. Their median age is 27.6 years. We have no data 
on the ages.cf teachers in the cities, although It is assumed that 
they v/ould be higher than the average for tho general teaching 
personnel. 

V/e do not Icnow how representatvle ware our samplings of teachers, 
in training and teachers in service. In both instances one and one 
half times as many women were shown as men. The analysis of the 

questionnaire to the Departments of Education Indicates that in the 

« 

four provinces reporting there are almost equal numbers of men 
and v?omen training for teaching. Tho men exceed th© v^omen in British 
Columbia and Alberta.

TABLE XLVII MARRIED FEMALE TEAOHFRS IN 5^ CITIES 







































Bolow are soma sample quotations on the question of married 
women teaching. 

Women teachers should be used only for the very young and 
the vary old. Ho boy should have a woman teaohar after the 
age of nine j/'oars#*’ 

^‘Qualifications and past experience should bo the deciding 
factor* A mrriod \ifoman who !ias a child of her own camot 
help but understand child relations bettor than one who 
hasn*t.” 

'‘l think if a woman who is married returriB to teaching, it 
is due mostly to lack of finance, and not due to a desire 
to teach, which ia not a healthy condition for the classroom.** 

’‘If a survey were made, I believe it would disclose that where 
married women, reti^.rnad to the orofesaian due to the shortage 
of teaohora during World War XI they, were good teachers.** 

’‘There should be a much larger proportion of males in the 
profession. It is the females who are always getting married 
that di3tabili2SQs the profession, ruins the pension schemes, 
and keeps the profession in a turmoil.** 

“!?hat has marriage to do with ability or lack of ability to 
eduoata youngsters? Bpinaterhood as a qualification for 
employment misses the point* 

Cfonclueioa 

The teaching profession suffers from relative impermanence of 
membership* This is shown In the low median age of teachers. In 
the low median years of experience of teachers, and the expressed 
intentions of teachers in training to leave the profession after a 
very short period of service. Probably the two most important 
reasons are the low economic status and the preponderance of women 
who leave through marriage. The economic status should be improved 
eind provision should be mad© for more married women to eontirRie 
their professional work after marriage* There seems to be a tendency

for more men to enter the teaching profession than formerly. In soite 
of the fact that the number of married men teaching in 45 cities in 
1947 was twenty-five per cent lower than the number of married men 
teaching in 4l cities in 1946, This shown in Table XLVI. Low 
salaries may have been an importsint reason for this apparent exodus 
of married men, while increasing salaries, more emphasis on university 
training, and the teacher shortage may be contributing causes for the 
increased numbers of male trainees. Since 1940 there has also been 
a tendency for more married women to remain in the professions. 

The holding power of the teaching profession must be increased if teachers 
are to enjoy the professional status and prestige of other professions. 
Certainly higher salaries, more university training, and a larger 
number of male teachers will help to improve the status of the 
teaching profession. The ability and the professional interest of 
members is a more important consideration in giving public service 
and in receiving public recognition than age, sex, or marital status, 
and everything possible should be done to keep highly qualified 
personnel in the teaching profession.
