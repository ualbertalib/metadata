Abstract 


The development of pre-stressed concrete has received little 
attention on this continent until very recently* lost of the advancement 
in this subject can be attributed to English and European engineers* 

Such names as Freyssinet (France), Magnel (Belgium), Evans (England) are 
outstanding in this work. 

Insofar as Western Canada is concerned no known projects of any 
consequence have been undertaken and little research has been carried out. 
In this investigation an attempt has been made to extend the general 
knowledge on the subject and perhaps create an interest in practical 
application. Specific attention was directed to the reliability of 
maintaining the tension in the reinforcing steel by bond alone* The 
results of the investigation indicate that for the form of reinforcing 
used (0.162 ins. diameter high tensile strength wire) mechanical anchor¬ 
age devices must be provided in order to provide an acceptable factor of 
safety.

Introduction 


The purpose of this investigation is to extend the field of 
general knowledge in pre-stressed concrete, and to lay the foundations for 
further research in this subject to be carried out by the Department of 
Civil Engineering at the University of Alberta. 

Specifically, the purpose is to reveal the nature of bond between 
concrete and the highly stressed reinforcing steel in a pre-stressed con¬ 
crete beam. Moreover it is hoped to be able to determine whether bond alone 
is sufficient to maintain the tension in the reinforcing steel, or whether 
the specially designed (and usually patented) anchorage devices must be 
left in place. 

It is intended to do this by testing two identical beams, one 
with the anchorages removed, the other with them retained, and to draw 
comparisons therefrom. 

Observations pertaining to 

(a) Effect of time on tension in the steel 

(b) Load-deflection characteristics 

(c) Behavior of the steel stresses under loading 

(d) Occurrence and causes of failure 

(e) Factors of safety 

are to be recorded and reported upon. 

The undertaking is also to contribute information of such 
practicable value as to promote the introduction of this type of con¬ 
struction to Western Canada.

Brief History of the Development of Pre-Stressed Concrete 


2 


The successful and comparatively recent applications of pre¬ 
stressed concrete, together with its current state of development, represents 
but one example of a desire on the part of engineers to use more efficiently 
and economically, the materials of construction. To this end therefore, 
the approach has been to exploit to the utmost their inherent strength 
characteristics. 

It is common knoisrledge, of course, that plain concrete, while 
capable of withstanding large compressive stresses, can resist only very 
small tensile stresses in comparison. Thus it was that the use of con¬ 
crete as a structural material was limited by its inherent weakness in 
tension. This limitation existed until designers realized the possibilities 
of reinforcing concrete with steel rods suitably placed to resist tensile 
stresses. This is made possible by the adhesion or bonding of concrete 
to the steel, thereby preventing any slipping of the rods. Hence this 
composite member acts as a single unit as it deforms under load. Carrying 
this process of thinking even further, the idea was postulated of imparting 
an initial compressive stress to composite feri’o-concrete members. The 
fundamental purpose of pre-stress then, was to produce within the member 
an internal compressive stress which must be reduced to zero before any 
tensile stress can exist. 

Pioneer attempts at pre-stressing — Surprisingly enough, the 
idea of applying an initial tensile stress in the reinforcing steel was 
considered as early as 1S86 by a German, C.F.W. Doehring. Patents were 
issued to him covering the manufacture of mortar slabs containing steel 
wire reinforcement which was tensioned before casting the mortar, and re¬ 
leased after it had set up. He reasoned that this would produce a material 
whose components would fail more or less simultaneously and therefore in¬ 
crease the ultimate strength. Apparently he did not recognize the

fundamental purpose of pre-stressing — viz, to produce an internal 
compressive stress that reduces or eliminates tensile stresses when the 
structure is loaded. However, this is not to be wondered at, since the 
theoretical principles and basic properties of ordinary reinforced 
concrete had still to be discovered. 

It was in the period following that many early experiments in 
pre-stressed concrete were conducted and by about 1910 the basic principles 
appear to have been reasonably well established. In spite of the fact that 
the theoretical advantages of pre-stressing were then appreciated, the 
results of practical applications left much to be desired. 

Failure of these pioneer attempts in arriving at a practicable 
system of pre-stressing may be attributed to two main reasons: 

1. Inadequacy of the materials they had to ?/ork with. For ex¬ 
ample Doehrings pre-stressed slabs were unsuccessful because the quality 
of his cement mortar was so poor that the bond strength was insufficient 
to maintain the tension in the wires after they had been released. 

Other German attempts failed because the permissible stress to 
which the steel could be tensioned at that time, was so low that the pre¬ 
stress disappeared because the elongation of the steel under load was smaller 
that the average shrinkage and contraction of the concrete. 

2. Failure to appreciate the limitations inherent in the two 
materials — this was particularly true in regard to shrinkage and plastic 
behavior of the concrete. (A good deal is still to be learned about this 
latter subject). In addition to this, the creep on the part of the steel 
tended to reduce if not eliminate the pre-stress. 

Development of Successfu l Methods — It was perhaps, S. Freyssinet 
who made the greatest single contribution toY/ards making pre-stressed con¬ 
crete f1 an economically and technically competitive structural engineering-

It was he who discovered that the path to success was via the use of high 
quality concrete and high tensile strength steel. These are essentials. 

High quality concrete provides the necessary bond strength and 
the desireable low shrinkage, lov/ creep properties. 

High tensile strength steel permits the use of tensile stresses 
of such magnitude that adequate pre-compression remains after losses due 
to shrinkage, contraction, creep, etc., have taken place. 

Arrival at Practical Systems of Applying Pre-Stress — The methods 
of application of pre-stress may be classified under one or other of two 
main systems. 

(a) Pre-tensionlng —■ with this system the steel is placed under 
a tensile stress and anchored in this manner until the concrete has been 
placed and cured. After such time, the tensioning devices holding the steel 
are released thus transferring a compressive load to the concrete. This 
method may rely entirely on bond to hold the tension; or, specially devised 
grips may be placed on the ends of the steel to effect a mechanical anchorage. 

(b) Post-tensioning — this system arose as one of the early 
attempts to overcome the loss of pre-stress due to contraction of the con¬ 
crete by shrinkage. This is accomplished by stressing the steel after all 
shrinkage has taken place. 

In general, recent developments have tended to lie in the 
improvement of mechnical methods of which perhaps a few should be mentioned. 

Notable in this regard is the double acting hydraulic jack in¬ 
vented and patented by E. Freyssinet. It is used in conjunction with a 
specially developed type of anchorage. The jack in tensioning the steel, 
finds its reaction on the face of the concrete, thus applying a compressive 
stress to the concrete as the wire is tensioned. This method is suitable

for post tensioning and is generally used to stress steel in a cable form. 

In England, a method known as- the !, Lee-McGall n system makes use 
of high tensile silicon manganese steel bars with special threads and nuts 
at the ends ,f so designed as to develop practically the full strength of the 
bars without the necessity of upsetting* 1 . The procedure is to attach a 
special hydraulic jack to the bar by means of the threads and apply the 
desired load. This is measured by tapping the hydraulic system with a 
gauge. When this has been done the nut is tightened up against a previously 
provided bearing plate and the anchorage thus effected. A check on the 
stress in the bar can be made by measuring the strain. 

One of the most interesting of the modern innovations is the 
device used in stressing wires around the circumference of a tank. Here a 
special machine has been adapted that travels in a spiral path around the 
circumference of the tank. The desired stress is obtained by passing the 
steel wire through a tight fitting circular orifice, the diameter of which 
must be pre-determined according to the design stress. 

This by no means exhausts the discussion on the systems of applying 
pre-stress but serves to illustrate some of the work in that regard. Co¬ 
incident with the development of stressing devices must go the inventions 
of various anchorages such as the Freyssinet cones, Magnel sandwich plates, 
Gladwin plugs, etc. 

Advantages of Pre-stressed Concrete With the foregoing con¬ 
tributions in mind, then, it is felt that the specific advantages of pre¬ 
stressed concrete which motivated this intensive study, should be set down. 

Paramount, of course, pre-stressing compensates for the missing 
property of concrete — namely tensile strength. In reality it 'does more 
-- for it enables us to use the small tensile strength that concrete does 
have. This -then makes for economical use of both steel and concrete because

it permits the designer to work his steel at stresses near ultimate, 
whereas, formerly this was drastically restricted in order to prevent 
cracking* Additionally the compressive strength of the concrete may be 
fully exploited. 

A very desireable advantage that is apparently overlooked in 
most literature, is the reduction in diagonal tension. In ordinary re¬ 
inforced concrete where the shearing forces are high, an uneconomically 
large beam is necessitated. Pre-stressed concrete permits the use of 
smaller units and in some cases eliminates the need for stirrups. 

In application to bridge design, for example, this means savings 
in dead load can be effected that could never be approached with ordinary 
reinforced concrete. Associated directly with this is the added ft head 
room 11 that becomes available due to the reduced girder size possible. 
Reference here is made to the pedestrian bridge now being constructed in 
Los Angeles under the direction of L.G, Hollister. Comparative designs 
show a gain of 3 , 4 n head room for a pre-stressed structure as compared 
with ordinary reinforced concrete. The span is 110 feet, with an 8 f 0 lt 
clear walk. Savings in materials were computed to be 33 cu. yd. for 
concrete, and 33,000# of reinforcing steel. 

Finally, where occasional overload may cause excessive deflection 
accompanied by inevitable cracking, the effect of pre-stress, like a 
n benevolent guardian tr is to return the member, on removal of the load, to 
an undeflected position, whereupon the cracks are complete closed making 
their detection by eye almost impossible. 

It wpuld be wrong to have conveyed the impression that the 
application of pre-stressed concrete is limited to beam and girder type 
construction. In reality, the scope is wide and varied, for use has been

made of this principle in the design of tanks, reservoirs, railway ties, 
barges, transmission line poles, tunnels, anchorage for additional super¬ 
structure to increase dam heights, and even an experimental ship of about 
500 tons. 

Having thus traced, very briefly, the steps in the development 
of this Knew” method of construction, the author feels that one thing 
becomes rather significant — that pre-stressed concrete is not a competitor 
to ordinary reinforced concrete, but, the natural and evolutionary step in 
the advancement of what is one of our most important structural materials. 

Outline of the Investigation 

Firstly, it must be realized that the term bond, means nothing 
more than the anchorage, without resort to mechanical devices, of steel to 
mortar. It is made up of two components. One is the straight adhesion 
between the steel and the surrounding mortar. The second is a frictional 
or slippage resistance. The latter effect is incipient in nature, that is 
it is not available for use until the first component has been overcome and 
the steel starts to move within the concrete. It is the larger of the two 
components, but unfortunately little advantage can be taken of it in pre¬ 
stressed concrete. This follows, since the very movement by virtue of which 
it arises is generally sufficient to eliminate the tension in the steel 
upon which the principle of pre-stressed concrete depends. 

This, however, suggests a means whereby bond may be investigated. 
The method, obviously, is to measure the stress in the reinforcing steel 
at periods subsequent to pre-stressing and under varying conditions of load 
for a case where bond alone is anchoring the steel. The degree to which 
this stress is retained is therefore a measure of the extent to which bond

Testing was carried out on two pre-stressed concrete beams, 
made in the laboratory, specifically for that purpose. A 10 foot span 
with a 6" x 10" rectangular cross-section was used in each case. Re¬ 
inforcing steel consisted of 24 separate strands of 0.162" diameter 
high tensile strength wire, stressed to approximately 130,000 p.s.i. 

Concrete was of high quality, approximately 5000 p.s.i. based on 
standard 6" x 12" cylinders. 

Four of the wires were selected for special study and accord¬ 
ingly wire-resistance strain gauges were attached at strategic locations 
along their length. 

After curing for 28 days, the beams were subjected to cyclic 
loading in a Riehle Testing Machine. Beam #1 was tested after having the 
mechanical anchorage devices removed, while Beam #2 underwent testing with 
the anchorage left in place. Subsequent to the analysis and interpretation 
of the data recorded during the tests, the following conclusions were drawn t 

1. Anchorage by bond alone did not give what is considered to 
be an adequate safety factor. It was found to be only 1.59 (Beam #1) as 
compared to 2.82 for the case where the anchors were retained (Beam #2). 

2. Beam #1 failed due to loss of bond, that is a slippage of 
the wires. Beam #2 failed due to a compression failure in the concrete. 

3. Recovery characteristics over the design load for Beam #1 
were poor while the opposite was true for Beam #2. 

4. Pre-stressing precluded the possibility of failure by 
diagonal tension and obviated the necessity of stirrups. 

5. Indications are that the transmission length required for 
0.162 inch diameter wire stressed to approximately 130,000 p.s.i. is of 
the order of 108 times the diameter.

The out to out length was chosen as 11 feet, in accordance with the 

existing laboratory testing apparatus which permitted the use of spans up 

to approximately 10 feet center to center of supports, 

A simple rectangular beam was decided upon as a matter of ease in 

forming. This was permissible since the purpose of the test was not to 

investigate any particular cross-sectional shapes. The depth was taken as 

tv;ice the width. This is roughly in agreement with economical design practice.

Note, that here the problem is reversed to what is generally en¬ 
countered in that the dimensions of the beam have been initially decided 
upon and the allowable load is to be computed. In practice, of course, 
the size of the beam is unknown and must be arrived at on the basis of the 
loading conditions.

Arrangement of Wires 

Any convenient arrangement of wires whatsoever, resulting in the 
required eccentricity, may be used. It must be borne in mind, however, that 
this eccentricity was computed for a section at mid-span of the beam, or 
section of maximum bending moment. At the extreme ends of the beam it is 
found desirable to reduce the eccentricity to zero, for this may be accomplished 
in such a manner so as to materially reduce the shearing stress and also 
preclude the possibility of a tensile stress in the top fibre when dead 
load only is acting.

Reduction of Eccentricity 

As sections are considered more and more remote from the mid-point 
of the span, the bending moment arising from dead and live loads decreases 
and becomes zero over either support. Accordingly then it may be essential 
to reduce the amount of pre-stress in this region in order that excessive 
tensile stresses are avoided in the top fibre when the dead load alone is 
acting. The particular design at hand does not illustrate this point ex¬ 
ceedingly well because the dead load is comparatively small. This is, 
nevertheless, an extremely important factor in cases such as bridge girders 
where dead loads are appreciable and spans are abnormally great. 

In any case, the reduction of eccentricity may be utilized to aid 
in reducing the shearing stress. The reduction of eccentricity is best 
accomplished by raising some of the top layers of reinforcing steel near the 
ends of the span. Generally this is carried out such that the eccentricity 
becomes zero over the support. The selection of the point at which this re¬ 
duction should be started is best illustrated by means of a graph of the 
stresses in the extreme fibres. (See Plate III). The various lines indicate 
the different components which go together to make up the net fibre stress. 
(Note that compression and tension, although of opposite sign, are plotted 
on the same side of the datum to facilitate indicating the net stress). 

The values needed to plot such a graph are given in the following tables.

BEAM DESIGN 




















































21 

With reference to Plate III it is noticed that the point of 
commencement of reduction in eccentricity has been chosen at 2 , -6 M from 
the support. Considering the bottom fibre this is permissible, since the 
line XYZ representing fibre stress resulting from pre-stress for this case, 
does not cut the line ABC of fibre stress caused by the loading terms. The 
reduction could not have been started at mid-span, for example, since the 
line X-Z representing this case cuts the line ABC at K and L, thus indicating 
a tensile fibre stress. Furthermore this tensile stress would obviously be 
increased in value and broadened in scope from area BLK to area BNA as the 
anticipated loss of pre-stress materializes. 

Similarly any other choice which permits a tensile fibre stress 
should be discarded. 

On the other hand, consideration of the graph of stress in the 
top fibre shows that the limit has not been exceeded in the opposite 
direction. That is, had the reduction of eccentricity been started at a 
point too far distant from mid span, a tensile stress would have developed 
in the top fibre — for example, the line Xt-B^Z* results in the tensile 
stress indicated by area K*B*L ! when dead and live loads act, and area 
X , B t V t when dead load only acts. 

For the case chosen, indicated by line X*Y ? Z*, it should be 
mentioned that a s!5.ght tensile stress in the top fibre is possible when 
dead load alone is acting. Note, however, that the maximum value (occurring 
at the section at Y f ) is only 19»5 p.s.i. This is thought to be permissible, 
not only because of the small magnitude, but also because, that as pre-stress 
decreases with time, this tensile stress will also decrease and eventually 
will be replaced by a compressive stress.

The actual reduction of eccentricity was effected by placing 
dowels through the form walls (see Figure 3) so that the top three layers 
of steel could be bent upward in such a manner that the eccentricity was 
reduced linearly to zero at the end of the beam, (See Figure 3)

Check on Shearing Force 

While it may be said that the design is being checked against 
failure due to shearing forces, in reality the concern is the associated 
diagonal tension. Generally speaking, pre-stressing concrete provides for 
this without the necessity of stirrups. In any case diagonal tension is 
always appreciably reduced. 

The significance of shear and diagonal tension is best inves¬ 
tigated by drawing the Mohr circle for any particular case.

The cross hatched area of Figure 4 shows the net shearing force 
acting at any particular section. The reduction for the first 2*-6 K from 
either support is due to the vertical component of pre-stress in the 
sloping reinforcing wires. 

This can easily be calculated, since the arrangement of wires 
chosen results in a loss of eccentricity of 2,2 ,! in 3 t -Q n (i,e, 3*-0” from 
the end of the beam). 

Thus 

R = 2^2 x 66,200 ; 4,050# 

4' 36 

This component acts oppositely to the shearing force caused by 
the loading terms, and hence results in a net shearing force of smaller 
magnitude. The critical section, therefore, insofar as shear is concerned 
is the one marked A-A in Figure 4 — that is a section just inside the point 
where the reduction of eccentricity commences.

Forces Involved 


24 


Having thus determined that section A-A is critical for shear. 


it is now necessary to consider elements taken vertically on that section 
and investigate for the combination of horizontal shear and corresponding 
value of normal thrust (due to the pre-stress) which produces the case of 
maximum diagonal tension. In Fig. 5 values are plotted showing the 
variation of these two force components respectively over section A-A. 


Rather than investigating several elements (which is a trial and 


error solution) it may be expedient to take the minimum value of normal 
thrust and combine it with the maximum value of horizontal shear. Although 
these values are for two different and widely separated elements, (viz. the 
top element for the case of normal thrust and middle element for horizontal 
shear) if the resulting diagonal tension is considered permissible then 
since any other possible combination would produce a materially smaller 
value, the design can be considered satisfactory without further investigation. 


If, however, the resulting diagonal tension is found to be ex¬ 


cessive, then it may be deemed wise to investigate elements selected at 
various distances above the center of the cross section.

TEST PROCEDURE 


n rj 

K> i 


A. Construction of the Test Beams 

It was decided to construct two practically identical, pre¬ 
tensioned beams in accordance with the design figures arrived at in the 
preceding section. 

To do this necessitated the design and fabrication of two sets of 
steel forms which could be used in this and subsequent investigations. 

Refer to Appendix f, D u for a discussion on the factors affecting their design, 
and for a set of detailed drawings of the forms. 

Pertinent data on the two materials used in the construction of 
the beams is now given. 

Reinforcing steel : Was in the form of cold drawn, high tensile 
strength wire (supplied by the Steel Company of Canada). 

The diameter of the wire was 0.162 ins. and hence had a cross- 
sectional area of 0.0206 sq. ins. 

A loading test was performed on a sample of the wire from which 
E (Young ! s Modulus) was determined to be 29.6 x 10^ p.s.i. (A discussion 
on this follows later - Page 65 ) # The proportional limit was found to be 
170,000 p.s.i. The stress-strain curve drawn from the results of this test 
is presented on PLATE IV. 

Concrete ; High strength concrete (5000 p.s.i.) was used. Pre¬ 
paratory to the actual construction of the beams, a concrete mix was designed 
and trial cylinders cast. Adjustment of the mix was made on the basis of the 
cylinder strengths. In this regard it is emphasized that the stated strength 
is based on standard 6” x I2 f} cylinders and not on cube strength. The latter 
gives a value of about 128$ of that obtained from cylinders for the same mix.

Initially it was planned to select for study, one wire from each 
of the six layers. To these six wires, wire-resistance strain gauges were 
to have been attached for the purpose of revealing the stress at various 
locations and under differing magnitudes of load. 

This rather over ambitious arrangement of gauges was modified 
when work on the first beam was commenced. Apart from the expense incurred 
by the usage of so many gauges, practical difficulties were also encountered. 

It was found that in certain areas, the number of lead out wires was ex¬ 
cessive and became unwieldly. Secondly, the waterproofing became rather 
bulky, so that with six such gauge housings located close together, a con¬ 
siderable amount of concrete would have been displaced. It was feared that 
the combination of these two factors might produce an abnormally weak section. 

Thus it was finally decided that only four wires should have gauges 
attached to them. (It is now thought that the extra gauges would not have 
contributed much additional information in any case). 

It was desired to know the stress in these wires at 

(a) their extreme ends 

(b) points under each load 

(c) mid-span 

In order to prevent any curvature (inherent from its manf.) in the 
wire from rendering an inaccurate stress evaluation, it was considered 
essential to locate two gauges, end to end and on diametrically opposite 
sides of the wire, at any point where the stress was required. (Such a 
location, with two gauges, will hereinafter be termed a H gauge point**). 

From the average strain recorded at a gauge point, it was thus possible to 
compute the stress.

This procedure is in accordance with normal laboratory practise — 
for example a Huggenberger Extensometer is used to measure strain over two 
gauge lengths on diametrically opposed sides of a specimen. 

The method of attaching and waterproofing the gauges used in this 
investigation is described in detail in Appendix "C”. Photographs of a 
typical gauge point are also shown. 

A code was used to make reference to any particular gauge an easy 
matter. The wires selected for study and their designation, together with 
the location of the gauge points and their designation are shown on PLATE V. 

Thus the gauge points selected for wires U, I & I were 

(1) at a point below each load .... (designation P & W) 

(2) at midspan... (designation C ) 

(3) at either end . (designation N & S) 

For wire Z, gauge points were located as in (1) and (2) above and 

at both ends. Furthermore, wire Z was selected specifically to enable a study 
of bond to be made. For this reason, so-called f, satellite n gauge points were 
selected, in addition to those already mentioned. At these points only one 
gauge was attached. Thus, although the satellite gauge points were not 
considered suitable to give necessarily true stress evaluations they served 
to indicate any sudden occurrences such as might result with a loss of bond. 

Six satellites were used in the case of Beam #1. Since it was to be tested 
without anchors, the investigation of bond was of relatively greater importance, 
than for Beam #2 on which the anchors were to be retained. 

It was found expedient to stretch the wires over a long bench, each 
end being held by a vise, during the gauge attaching and waterproofing processes. 
Upon transferring the wires, with the completed gauge points, to the steel 
forms, care was exercised to avoid damage to the waterproofing. The wire 
had a strong tendency to return to its originally coiled shape, and hence 
had to be kept continually under tension during the transferring procedure.

Once the wires were in place in the appropriate holes of the steel end 
plates, a gripping device was placed loosely over each end. The wire was 
positioned longitudinally in the forms such that all gauge points were in 
their proper positions. At one end, sufficient length of wire was left 
protruding to provide for gripping in the subsequent tensioning process. 

All wires were placed in the forms in this manner, starting with 
the bottom layer and working upwards. The dowels about which the three top 
layers of wire were bent, were placed during this operation. 

When all wires were in place, initial or n zero n readings were re¬ 
corded for the gauges. In this regard H zero H stress in the wires was taken 
as that condition of stress existing when the wires were pulled as straight 
as possible by hand. This should not introduce an appreciable error in view 
of the ma gnitudes of stress eventually realized. 

The stressing of the wires was accomplished by means of an hydraulic 
jack and a section of 5 n pipe arranged as shown in Figure 8. 

The wires were tensioned in pairs — each pair being made up of 
two correspondingly located wires either side of the horizontal centerline 
of the end plate. To ensure equal loads being placed on each wire it was 
essential to locate the jack centrally between the two wires. 

A pressure gauge was attached to the fluid reservoir of the jack 
which provided a means of checking the approximate load on the wires. For 
closer determination, and for wires to which strain gauges had been attached, 
the matter was simply to read the strains recorded by the gauges and convert 
this to stress. The majority of the wires, however, had no gauges, and their 
stresses were determined indirectly by determining their frequency of vibration* 
For a full description of the apparatus and development of necessary theory 
used in this method see Appendix n B n .

Tensioning Apparatus 


End Details 


















As a last step before placing the concrete, all wires were cleaned 
with solvent to remove any grease picked up from the forms. 

Figure 7 shows a general view of the wires in place in the forms 
after tensioning. Figure 9 is a close-up of the end plate and anchors. 

The high strength concrete required meant that a rather dry stiff 
mix had to be handled. Thus it was essential that some method of compaction 
be used. Since the space between wires was limited to approximately one 
inch, the use of a vibrator of the type that works in the concrete was not 
permissible. An ordinary pneumatic jack hammer was used on the sides of the 
forms and the concrete was placed satisfactorily without holes or honeycombing 

B. Method of Testing 

Beam #1 was selected for test without end anchorages. At this stage 
considerable doubt arose over the effectiveness of bond in maintaining pre¬ 
stress, A cautious approach was therefore adopted. Anchors were removed 
firstly from wire n X n • 

Their removal was effected by placing the end of a steel bar 
against the anchor and delivering a sharp blow to the opposite end of the 
bar by means of a sledge hammer. This resulted in a cleanly sheared break 
of the wire with no undesirable bending placed on it which might have 
affected the bond. 

The only loss in stress recorded on wire X was at the end N. 

This loss was anticipated since N was so close to the end of the beam that 
a sufficient length of wire was not available along which bond could develop. 
Accordingly then, it was decided to continue with the removal of the anchor¬ 
ages. Wire U was selected next. The results for it were very disappointing. 
An immediate loss of all useful pre-stress at all gauge points along the 
wire, except at W was recorded. It was decided to dispense with further

removal of the anchorages, lest the beam be rendered incapable of sustaining 
any appreciable load. The plan, then, was to test the beam by loading to 
the design load with the remaining anchors left in place, release the load, 
remove all anchors, and proceed with cyclic loading to failure. The chance 
of an immediate failure with little or no information contributed by a beam 
on which much time and money had been spent was thus avoided. 

Since the beams had been cast one week apart there was ample time 
available for the testing of Beam #1 before the curing period of Beam #2 
was complete. 

Reaction type loading was effected by means of a Riehle Testing 
Machine (capacity 150,000#). The apparatus was arranged to apply two equal 
concentrated loads at the one-third points of the span. A general view of 
this appartus with Beam #2 in place is shown in Figure 10. 

Centerline deflection for both beams was measured by means of an 
Ames dial. Rulers with graduations to the one-hundredth of an inch were 
used to check deflection of points two feet from each reaction. 

Thus by subjecting each beam to identical loads(at least for the 
range of loading withstood by the weaker beam) it was possible to investi¬ 
gate the extent to which bond alone was reliable in maintaining pre-stress.

Presentation. Analysis and Interpretation of Test Data . 


36 


A. General 

Throughout the curing period, a running check was kept on the 
stress in the four selected wires by recording strain gauge readings at 
frequent intervals. This data is presented for Beams 1 & 2 on PLATES VI 
& VII respectively as graphs of Steel Stress vs. Time of Cure . 

During the actual testing period, record was kept of 

(a) total applied load 

(b) strain gauge readings 

(c) deflection at the centerline and at the two 
outer one-fifth points 

(d ) temperature 

at regular increments (and decrements) of applied load. 

The centerline deflection characteristics are indicated for Beams 
1 & 2 on PLATES VIII & H respectively as Load-Deflection curves. The 
deflections of the points two feet from the supports were read to rather a 
poor degree of precision and the data was considered of insufficient con¬ 
sequence to warrant presentation here. 

PLATES X to XVII inclusive, depict the trend of the strain (and 
hence stress) at the different gauge points under varying conditions of load. 
It should be noted that the horizontal scale of these Steel Stress vs. Total 
Applied Load graphs is not a normal constantly increasing scale, but is 
^stretched out 11 as it were, in order to follow the cyclic loading pattern. 

In this way it was hoped that a clearer picture of the stress tendency would 
be revealed. With a normal scale the picture is confused by the crossing 
and recrossing of the curves.

In addition to this data, a special point was made to take strain 
gauge readings before and after (a) the removal of the forms (b) the removal 
of any of the anchorage devices, in order to reveal the effect these 
operations had upon the stress in the wires. These results are incorporated 
with either the tt Steel Stress vs. Time of Cure” or n Steel Stress vs. Total 
Applied Load” graphs, according to the seo A uence of events. 



Interpretation of Results 


Steel Stress vs. Time of Cure 

PLATES VI & VII 


Beam #1 

With one exception (wire l) all of the curves follow the same 
general pattern. Immediately after tensioning, the stress in any particular 
wire is seen to decrease very rapidly. This continues over the first twenty 
hours. The loss in stress can very probably be attributed, for the most 
part, to plastic flow or !1 creep u of the steel wire itself. 

Following this period of loss of stress an ft apparent M recovery 
of stress is indicated. For this early portion of the curing period the 
strain gauges are perhaps none too reliable, due to the shrinkage and thermal 
effects of the newly placed concrete. It is thought that herein lies an 
explanation for the apparent stress recovery. The concrete in shrinking 
would cause pressure, (more or less uniformly distributed by the asphalt 
housing) to bear upon the gauges. Such a pressure would produce the same 
effect on the gauges as that observed for an actual increase in stress. In 
any case this irregular behavior is undoubtedly due In some way to the action 
of the concrete. This is substantiated by results of a test performed on 
a wire stressed in the forms with no concrete placed about it. The trend 
is towards a continual loss in stress at a decreasing rate of loss, with no 
stress recovery indicated. 

After the first three days, with the exception of wire I, the 
gauges indicate that no radical stress changes occurred, and remained for 
the most part practically constant. In view of the steadiness in gauge 
readings for all other wires including those of Beam #2, it is considered

that the erratic nature of those on wire Y was due to one or more faulty 
gauge. In fact, readings of only two of the four gauge points were con¬ 
sidered of sufficient accuracy to warrant use. 

Initial values for wire U are missing due to a broken common 
lead that was not immediately located. 

Beam #2 

The curves for Beam #2 agree in general with the pattern set by 
those for Beam #1 and are exceptionally consistent with one another. No 
explanation is offered for the improvement of results for Beam #2, unless 
the experience gained in fabricating the first is reflected in the results 
of the second. 

PLATE VII shows that a sharp drop in stress occurred during the 
first few hours, followed by a slight recovery (much smaller than the case 
of Beam #1), For the remaining period all wires showed an almost constant 
stress, or perhaps at most a very slight uniform decrease.

Load-Deflect.ion Curves 


PLATES VIII & IX 


Both beams gave rt hysteresis 11 type curves under cyclic loading. 

This would serve to indicate a failure on the part of the beams to recover 
completely from the deflected state as the load was reduced. However, two 
factors greatly affect the degree of recovery. 

Perhaps the most important of the two is the length of time allowed 
between observations of deflection. In other words, at least a portion of 
the remaining deformation is simply due to a lagging effect with respect 
to time. This is illustrated by the recovery made overnight while under 
constant load. 

The second effect results in a permanent deflection experienced 
due to the lack of sufficient energy to provide a restoring force. This 
arises out of a dissipation of some of the energy used in initially causing 
the deflection. The effect is analogous to the hysteresis loss observed 
when a magnetic material is subjected to cyclic reversals of a magnetizing 
force. 

In the case of a pre-stressed beam where the percentage of steel 
is small, this characteristic is considered indicative of the fact that 
concrete is not a perfectly elastic material. 

Beam #1 

From PLATE VIII it will be seen that under the initial loading to 
11,000#, and with all but two of the wires still anchored mechanically by 
means of the gripping devices, a straight line relationship exists between 
load and deflection. Furthermore it appears that this characteristic would

have extended at least as far as the design load, had the initial loading 
been performed on the beam stripped of the anchors. This is suggested by 
the graphical results of the second loading, at which time all the anchors 
had actually been removed. 

Beam #2 

PLATE IX shows the straight line relationship to exist between 
load and deflection to a total load of slightly greater than 13000#. This 
represents an increase of approximately 16$ over Beam #1. It is also apparent 
on comparison of PLATES VIII & IX that Beam #2 exhibited superior recovery 
properties — that is, it behaved more elastically.

Steel Stress Vs. Total Load 

PLATES X to XVII incl. 

These curves show graphically, the stress variation in the re¬ 
inforcing wires during the loading cycles. In interpreting the results of 
these graphs, the location of the particular wire and gauge point under con¬ 
sideration must be kept clearly in mind. PLATE V indicates these locations 
with respect to loading points, reaction points and neutral axis. 

Beam #1 

(a) Wire U (Refer to PLATE X) 

Prior to loading the beam, in fact prior to the removal of the 
steel forms, the end anchorage devices of wire n U B were sheared off. Immed¬ 
iately following this, the strain readings were recorded from the gauges on 
this particular wire. The results indicate a complete loss of useful stress 
throughout most of the length of the wire. Only in the region of gauge point 
W was the tension retained. Gauge points S, P & C reveal the occurrence 
of great losses of stress varying from a complete drop at S to a 50^ drop 
at C. 

Further losses are indicated as having resulted upon removal of 
the forms. This is due largely to the elastic deformation undergone by the 
concrete. Although the loss is noted as being sudden in nature, some further 
loss is indicated as having occurred up to 24 hours later. The latter effect 
is probably attributable to plastic flow by the concrete. 

During the loading cycles that followed, little significance is 
attached to the results recorded at gauge points S, P & C. It is thought 
that perhaps the slippage resistance of the wire, together with the wedging

action of the gauge housings was all that prevented the stress in the wire 
from dropping completely to zero. 

With regard to gauge point W, noteworthy is the fact that for an 
increasing load on the beam, the stress at W drops, whereas for a decreasing 
load the reverse is true. This is not to be wondered at when it is remem¬ 
bered that gauge point W lies well above the neutral axis of the beam. 

(b) Wire X (Refer to PLATE XI) 

As for the case of wire ,, U M , the anchors on tt X M were removed 
before loading was commenced. At gauge point S an immediate loss of almost 
50$ of the stress in the wire was recorded. Gauges at W, P, & C, however, 
indicated no changes whatsoever and hence sufficient bond must have developed 
in order to have maintained the tension over most of the length of the wire. 

As for the case of wire n U w a sharp drop in stress was experienced 
at all points, upon removal of the forms. 

For the case of loading up to the design load, a very slight in¬ 
crease in stress occurred at P, W & C. This increase amounts to about 
5$ of the initial stress. Over the design load, however, appreciably greater 
increases occurred until at a load of 17,400 # (whereupon cracks suddenly 
appeared under loading point P) the stress at gauge point P dropped in¬ 
stantly. The loss sustained was over 50$. This indicates a slipping of 
the wire at the southern end of the beam. 

In general, for increasing loads, stresses at the gauge points 
increased and vice versa (gauge point S excepted). This, of course, is to 
be expected for any point located below the neutral axis. 

(c) Wire I (Refer to PLATS XII) 

End anchors were left in place on this wire until after the 
completion of one loading cycle up to the design load. The load was then 
completely removed to permit the shearing off of the anchorage devices.

As this was done, all useful stress at N was completely lost. No effect 
was revealed at points P, C & W. Very little more can be said of the 
stress tendencies, which were similar in pattern to those of wire X, ex¬ 
cept that the variations were more pronounced due to the fact that the 
gauge points were displaced further from the neutral axis. 

(d) Wire Z (Refer to PLATE XIII) 

The gauge points on this wire recorded the same type of stress 
variations as reported for the two previous wires. Wire Z being located 
farther below the neutral axis than the wires in any other layer, accordingly 
showed slightly more pronounced stress variations. 

Upon removal of the anchorages, loss of stress was recorded at S 
and N only. No effect was noted on satellite gauges SI and S6. These 
gauges were approximately IS inches from S & N respectively. Thus in 
IS inches or less sufficient bond was developed to maintain the full stress 
in the wires. The remaining satellites contributed no additional information 
and it was considered that no purpose would be fulfilled in plotting the results 

Inspection of PLATES XIV to XVII will reveal for the most part, a 
substantiation of the stress characteristics displayed by the wires of Beam #1. 
The explanations offered in the foregoing for the various occurrences apply 
equally well to Beam #2. A rigorous discussion on the behavior of each gauge 
point is therefore not deemed necessary. However, the following special 
points should be noted. 

Because Beam #2 was capable of withstanding substantially greater 
loads, the wires, in all cases,were subjected to much higher stresses than 
their counterparts of Beam #1 This is particularly true for the wires 
designated X I & Z. It should be pointed out therefore that for the 
upper reaches of these curves, the straight line relationship between stress

and strain no longer exists. (See PLATE IV). It is therefore necessary, 
when dealing with magnitudes of stress exceeding 170,000 p.s.i. to use the 
graph of PLATE IV to convert measured strain to stress. 

Rather eratic results were observed for gauge points IX & PZ. 

This can be directly attributed to leaky gauges, as evidenced by the difficulty 
experienced in obtaining a true balance on the strain indicator because of a 
wavering action by the galvanometer needle. However, despite this, the 
resulting curves follow the general trend, expected from the results at 
other gauge points. 

Contrary to the case of Beam #1, no anchorage devices were removed 
and hence no gauge points were rendered ineffective due to this cause. 

Beam #2 therefore presents the only record of stress variations in the 
wires at the ends of the beams. It will be seen from the curves for gauge 
points S & N that the stress there remained practically constant in all 
cases during the loading cycles except for a rapid rise as failure became 


imminent

Discussion 

The consideration of the manner in which each of the beams failed 
is of primary importance. 

For the case of Beam #1, first evidence of impending failure was 
seen with the appearance of a crack on the bottom surface of the beam 
directly below the southern load point (p). This occurred at a total load 
of 17,400#. Loading was continued until 13,000# was sustained* Under this 
load appreciable widening of the crack occurred. (See Fig. 11). The load 
was then reduced to 11,000#, whereupon the crack closed. On subsequent 
reloading the crack reappeared at a lower load (16,000#) than previously. 

Then at approximately 17,500# complete failure took place. Further ^loading 11 
only caused increased deflection while the sustained load dropped. Figure 12 
shows a general view of the condition of the beam at this point. Sub¬ 
sequently the load was completely removed. 

Failure, unquestionably, was caused by a loss of bond occurring 
between the load point P and the nearest end of the beam. During excessive 
loading after failure, the pulling in of the wires at that end of the beam 
was plainly visible. 

It is to be noted that failure occurred at a load less than the 
18,000# once sustained by the beam. This serves to indicate that some of 
the wires must have slipped on the initial loading hence reducing the 
ultimate load attainable on reloading. Indeed, PLATES X, XI, XII & XIII 
indicate that slippage of at least some of the wires must have occurred 
as early as 13,000 - 14,000# on the initial loading. This is manifested 
in the fluctuating stress pattern for these loads. 

During the loading after failure, a maximum centerline deflection 


of 1.67 inches was recorded for a sustained load of 11,000#. Greatest

deflection prior to failure was 0*29 inches* Upon reducing the load to 
zero, a permanent deflection of 1*42 inches was noted* This represents 
a recovery based on the maximum deflection of only 15%* 

The safety factor for the beam with respect to the design load 
of 11,000# was 1.59. 

The twenty-eight day cylinder strength averaged 4750 p.s.i. The 
cube strength obtained from three two-inch cubes cut from an undamaged 
portion of the beam was 6010 p.s.i* or approximately 4700 p.s.i. when con¬ 
verted to standard cylinder strengths. 

The failure of Beam #2 was due to an entirely different cause than 
that for the case of Beam #1* 

First cracks did not appear until a total load of 21,000# was 
applied. At this point a series of hair cracks became evident on the bottom 
surface of the beam, spread at intervals of about ten inches between the two 
loading points. With the application of further load, one crack immediately 
below load point P became greatly widened. This in effect, permitted a 
relaxation along the bottom surface, with the result that the remainder of 
the cracks tended to close up. Loading was continued to 28,000#, then 
dropped to 18,000#. The cracks at this latter load were completely closed. 
On subsequent reloading the cracks reappeared at 20,000#. Finally at approx¬ 
imately 31,000# complete failure took place. Some excess load was applied 
after failure, as for the case of Beam #1, and then all load was completely 
removed. After remaining in the unloaded state overnight, the design load 
was once again placed on the beam. 

Failure in this case was due to a compression failure on the part 
of the concrete. This occurred near the top of the beam and under load 
point P. (See Figure 16).

As for Beam #1, excessive loading past failure caused increased 
deflection with a drop of sustained load. The maximum centerline deflection 
recorded was 1.58 inches, at which time the load had dropped to 14 , 000 #. 

The greatest deflection before failure was 0.91 inches. 

Recovery properties were excellent. On complete removal of the 
load after failure, the deflection was only 0.19 inches, representing a 
notable recovery of 88$ (again based on the maximum deflection). See 
Figures 15, 16, 17 & 18 for pictures of the state of failure under the 
noted loads. 

The factor of safety for the beam was 2.82. 

The twenty-eight day cylinder strength was 5300 p.s.i. while cube 
strength was 8880 p.s 0 i 0 or converted to equivalent cylinder strength, 
approximately 6940 p.s.i. 

It appears, therefore, that for the form of reinforcing steel 
used in this investigation, sufficient pre-stress can be maintained by bond 
alone to permit the sustainance of loads somewhat greater than the design 
figure. However, the factor of safety leaves much to be desired. Con¬ 
sequently it is recommended that in practise the mechanical anchorage 
devices be left in place. This is based upon the added factor of safety 
obtainable (2.82 as compared to 1.59) which is more nearly in agreement 
with the generally accepted value of 2.5 used in the design of ordinary 
reinforced concrete. It must also be borne in mind that the investigation 
has not taken into account the effect of time (say a period of years) on 
the loss of pre-stress. This would probably reduce further the observed 
safety factors. 

The highly desireable recovery characteristics from chance over¬ 
loading also make the retension of the anchorage devices advisable.

Failure of Beam #2 - 31,000# 






















equence of loads noted is same as order of figures 






















As predicted during the design, no tendency to fail by diagonal 
tension was observed for either beam. This is particularly noteworthy in 
view of the fact, that tests conducted at this institution over a period 
of years on ordinary reinforced concrete beams of approximately the same 
size and span, indicate that diagonal tension is a frequent cause of 
failure. It is resistance to this type of failure that constitutes one of 
the main advantages of this method of construction, notwithstanding the 
fact that many writers on the subject make no mention of it. 

It has been shown, not conclusively, that for a wire of the 
diameter used, (0.162 inches) sufficient bond was developed along a length 
of eighteen inches or less, to maintain a stress of 130,000 p.s.i. At most 
this length, known as the transmission length, is 108 times the diameter. 

This is in agreement with the finding of M, ~R. Ros who reported that a 
length of 100 to 120 times the diameter was required for 0,12 inches 
diameter wire under a stress of 152,000 p.s.i. 

For the most part, the gauge readings substantiated the beam theory. 
For gauge points located below the neutral axis and for loading below the 
design load, the change in stress in the wires was slight. Above the design 
load very appreciable changes were recorded depending upon the extent of 
overloading, (i.e. past the design load). Moreover, for any particular 
load, the stress variation was more pronounced for cases further removed 
from the neutral axis. In other words, above the design load the reinforcing 
steel is seen to act more or less in the manner of that in a conventional 
reinforced concrete beam. 

For locations above the neutral axis , the stress decreased with an 
increasing load and vice versa. The exception to this is the increase 
recorded at such points for extremely high overloads and after the appearance 
of cracks. This does not contradict the theory. It simply means that the

neutral axis moved upwards as the effective cross-section of the beam was 
reduced by the upward progression of tension cracks from the bottom fibre# 
Thus eventually these locations found themselves below the neutral axis and 
behaved accordingly. 

Little effect was recorded by gauges near the ends of the beam 
until failure was close at hand. This follows since the bending moment and 
hence fibre stress is negligible at such sections# 

Some controversy arose over the value obtained for the modulus of 
elasticity for the steel wire. This value was obtained using wire-resistance 
strain gauges. Since gauges of exactly the same type were used in the beams, 
correct stresses can be obtained no matter how the value of E varies from 
that found elsewhere. This follows since this factor is used simply as a 
calibration constant for conversion of gauge readings to stress.

Conclusions 


Out of the foregoing rather rigorous analysis, it seems necessary 
to set forth the conslusions as a number of concise statements without 
further discussion. 

1. For the form of reinforcing steel used in this investigation, 
it is essential to provide mechanical anchorage devices in order to 
guarantee a sufficient factor of safety, comparable to that generally 
accepted in conventional reinforced concrete design. 

2. Up to the design load the load-deflection characteristics 
are practically identical regardless of whether or not the anchorage 
devices are retained, whereas above the design load, superior recovery 
properties are exhibited for the case where the anchorages are retained, 
even after appreciable cracking has occurred. 

3. Where ample provision for bond is made, high strength con¬ 
crete is essential to avoid premature failure by crushing. 

4. Pre-stressing precluded the possibility of failure by diagonal 
tension and obviated the necessity of stirrups. 

5. The required transmission length for 0.162” diameter steel 
wire is approximately IB inches, or 108 times the diameter. This was not 
shown conclusively. 

In general, it is felt that the investigation was successful, 
not only with respect to the actual tests themselves, but also from the 
point of view of the several techniques developed. Noteworthy is the method 
arrived at for determining the stress in wires by the tension-frequency 
relationship, and also the method of waterproofing the strain gauges* 

It is realized that the foregoing conclusions have, of course, 
been drawn from the test of only two beams, and hence further investigations 
are required to provide adequate statistical evidence in support of the 


statements made

Critique 

During the course of the investigation, many imperfections 
came to light in the techniques employed and apparatus used that were 
not necessarily apparent at the outset. Accordingly then, means of 
improvement are now suggested in order that future investigators on the 
subject may benefit from the experience gained. 

Perhaps the greatest single improvement that could be made lies 
in the manner of tensioning the wires. It will be recalled that the 
hydraulic jack used to apply the load to the steel wires, found reaction 
on the ends of the forms. On subsequent removal of the forms after the 
curing of the concrete, an 8$ average loss of stress in the wires was re¬ 
corded. This loss can be entirely eliminated by post-tensioning the wires. 

If, however, it is desired to retain the pre-tensioning system, 
abutments could be provided between which the stressing of the wires 
could be effected without placing any load on the forms. By using either 
procedure the problem of having to provide a device for releasing load on 
the forms does not arise. Moreover, formwork could be constructed of 
cheap grade lumber, and cross sections of many varied shapes very easily 
formed. 

It has already been noted that the device arrived at for releasing 
load on the forms in this investigation consisted of too many loose parts. 

If the same system is to be used again, a spot of welding to hold the angle 
struts to the channel web would greatly facilitate the initial assembly 
of the parts. 

With reference to the gauge points, it is felt that more con¬ 
sistent readings would result if the housings were enclosed in metal tubes 
about 5/8 u in diameter. The ends should be fitted with caps in which a 
centrally located hole is drilled to permit the passage of the steel wire 0

Slots in the tube would be necessary through which the lead out wires 
could be brought* The whole tube should be free to slide longitudinally 
along the wire for about l/4 ,! without interference. 

It should be possible to reduce the number of lead out wires 
to two at a gauge point. This could be done by connecting the two gauges 
in parallel. 

During the actual testing of the beam it would be desireable to 
use Ames dials at all points where deflections are to be determined. The 
use of rulers does not permit a tolerable degree of precision. 

Insofar as the actual design of the beam is concerned, it is now 
thought that the wires should be stressed higher (say to the order of 
165,000 p.s.i.) and hence reduce the total number required. This would 
also reduce the number of anchors required as well as cut down the labor 


involved

Suggested Topics for Further Investigations 


69 


1* It would be interesting to conduct a study on combining the advantages 
of pre-stressing with those of a continuous haunched girder, with an 
eye to arriving at the most economical proportions. 

2. Various shaped I sections should be considered. Such beams could 
perhaps be constructed in the laboratory as a number of separate pre¬ 
cast sections held together by post-tensioned wires. 

3. Attempts at measuring the strain on the outside of the concrete should 
be made, perhaps in the manner described in the Engineering News Record, 
March 8/51. 

4* It is essential to know more about the creep of steel, both under 
constant load and under constant length. 

5. Further investigation of bond stress is required. It is felt that the 
only approach here is through the use of very small (l/8 tl ) strain 
gauges which produce as little interference as possible with the 
continuity of the bond surface. 

Also on the subject of bond, it would be interesting to use 
twin twisted wires and conduct tests on their reliability without 
resorting to mechanical anchorages. 

Some thought should be given to an analytical method of computing 
bond stress. See the n Journal of the Institution of Civil Engineer 11 
— February, 1951 — article by Prof. R.H. Evans.

6. Pending the development of some means of successfully measuring the 
stress in concrete, it would be of great value to determine the stress 
distribution over a section,sum integrally to get the total stress and 
compare this value with that computed from the bending moment. 

7. Study should be made of the shear transfer characteristics between 
two precast units when held together by a tensioned cable. 

8. Perhaps a short span could be built where shear becomes an important 
factor. The effectiveness of vertical pre-stressed reinforcing could 
then be studied.

APPENDIX "A 11 

Design of a Statically-Determinate Pre-3tressed Concrete Beam 

The design procedure, outlined in the following pages, is the 
method presented by Gustave Magnel in his book **Prestressed Concrete 1 ** 
Fundamentally, the calculations involve the consideration of certain 
conditions which must be satisfied, but the number of variables is so great 
that a trial and error solution is the most expedient* Magnel, however, has 
shown how these basic relations may be illustrated graphically, from which 
the amount of pre-stress and eccentricity can be deduced once having 
determined the approximate dimensions of the concrete. The method can be 
applied to the design of elements of any shape* 

Notation 

The notation used in this chapter is the following: 

A, cross-sectional area of beam. 

b, breadth of rectangular beam or of flange of tee-beam. 

C, Gp constants relating to the ratio of stresses. 

c, permissible compressive stress in the concrete, 

c ab , c a £, calculated stresses in the bottom and top fibres respectively due 

to w .

Fun dam ent al F ormulae 

A prestressed concrete member subjected to bending only must in 
general resist a bending moment produced by the loads present Yffhen the 

prestress is being established and to another bending moment produced by 
the loads w a which can be applied after prestressing. Assume that the 
bending moments are such that compressive sttess is induced in the top 
fibre of the concrete. The additional stress in the stretched wires due to 
the loads w a will be neglected because this does not exceed 3 per cent, 
to 4 per cent, of the total stress in the wires, also because the stress 
induced in the wires during stretching decreases in time by an amount vary¬ 
ing from 10 per cent, to 15 per cent, due to creep of the steel and concrete 
and shrinking of the concrete. At least 4 per cent, of the reduction in the 
stretching force occurs during the first few hours after the stretching is 
completed and is mainly due to the creep of the steel. Therefore, if the 
stress in the steel is not excessive at the moment the stretching is completed, 
it will never be so under the working load. 

The section of the beam at mid-span must satisfy the following 
conditions. 

Top fibre . (1) Immediately the prestress is established the tensile 
stress in the concrete under load w^ must not exceed the permissible tensile 
stress c, in the concrete. This condition does not apply when the cable is 
within the core of the section, since the top fibre is then always in compression. 

(2) After a time (say, one year), under loads w^ and 

w combined, the compressive stress in the concrete must not exceed the per- 
a 

missible compressive stress c in the concrete if the Gable is below the core.

If the cable is within the core of the section, this condition must be 
fulfilled at the time the prestress is established, (In the foregoing the 
term ’’core” defines that zone of the beam, corresponding to the middle-third 
of a rectangular beam, within which the cable must be if tensile stresses in 
the concrete due to prestressing alone are to be avoided,) 

B ottom fibre . (3) Immediately the prestress is established the 
compressive stress in the concrete under w^ must not exceed c . 

(4) After a time, under the loads w, and w o 
combined, the tensile stress in the concrete must not exceed c + . 

These conditions can be expressed mathematically as in the follow¬ 
ing in which the symbols have the signification shown in Figure 1.

the size computed from (7). Should this be so the depth of the beam must 
be increased. In cases where e is satisfactory, which is generally the 
case, the beam must be designed only for w^ , the load , which is 
generally the dead load, being neglected. Thus an explanation is given of 
what is meant by saying that the weight of a prestressed beam 

n carries itself 11 . Even if there are losses of prestress, that is if 
is less than 1, this statement is still nearly correct. In ordinary re~ 
inforeed concrete the depth required at the middle of the span of a beam 
supported at both ends can be reduced by adding cantilevers at each end, 
thereby decreasing the total bending moment at the middle since the bending 
moment due to the dead load is decreased. In prestressed concrete, however, 
this is not the case, since the size of the beam at the middle is determined 
by considering only the bending moments due to loads that are imposed after 
prestressing, and these bending moments are not affected by the cantilevers, 
which might not be loaded. 


First Calculation of the Dimensions

It should be remembered that the evaluation of a secondary term can b© done 
with a rather large error without appreciably affecting the final results. 
Hence the two terms referred to are approximately equal to 0.225c and 
0,075c respectively, and formulae (5) and (6) now respectively become

Practical C alcu lations 

A section satisfying formulae (8) and (9) is chosen. The 
stresses c^ , c^ , and c^ are then computed. Next e^ is 

computed from (19) if c is greater than 4 c^ , or from (21) if 

c is less than c^ 4 o ^ • If the greatest eccentricity obtainable 

with the wires within the chosen section is less than e. . then the 

A * 

depth of the section must be increased. If the greatest eccentricity 
obtainable is greater than e , a diagram such as that in Figs. 6(a) 
and (b) is drawn. 

If the greatest, eccentricity obtainable exceeds e , the 

B 

eccentricity corresponding to point B in either Figs. 6(a) or (b), e 

B 

is adopted with the corresponding initial prestress indicated by the diagram; 

that is, P^ is determined from the ordinate of B . If the greatest 

eccentricity obtainable is less than e in either Figs. 6(a) or (b), the 

B 

greatest eccentricity available is adopted, and the value of P^ is deter¬ 
mined from the ordinate to the point on the upper boundary of the hatched 
area, the abscissa of the point being the value of the greatest eccentricity 

obtainable. (Note that the greatest value of corresponds to the smallest 

P i 

value of P^). The examples given later make this method clear. 

Effect of Dead Load at the Time the Prestress is Established 

To simplify the explanation of the statement previously made that 
H the dead load carries itself 8 , the loss of prestress will be neglected 
(that is ^ = 1), and a symmetrical section (ji r y,, r y) will be assumed. 
Formula (7), which results from combining (l) 4 (2) and (3) 4 (4), having 
been satisfied, (1) and (3) remain to be complied with in order that the 
four fundamental conditions, now equalities, be fulfilled. Combining (1) 
and (3) for a symmetrical section, and with c^ - c^-j.

APPENDIX "B" 



The Frequency Method for Checking Stress in Wires 


One of the problems encountered in the course of the investigation 
was that of determining the stress in the wires after they had been tensioned. 

By tapping the fluid reservoir of the jack used to apply the 
tensioning load and introducing a hydraulic gauge into the line, a reasonable 
value of the applied load may be obtained. However, even if the gauge is 
reliable, the load thus obtained is not the true load to which the wires 
are subjected after the jack has been removed. This follows, since in the 
transfer of the load from the jack to the gripping devices a considerable 
relaxation of load is permitted. 

Another solution is the installation of wire-resistance strain 
gauges on every wire, or perhaps on one of every pair of wires which are 
to be tensioned simultaneously. However, this entails a good deal of prep¬ 
aration and is also a very expensive process. 

The method finally adopted made use of the tension-frequency 
relationship for a vibrating uniform string. The theory for arriving at 
this relationship is now given. 

Consider a string, vibrating between two fixed points A and B 
as in Figure 1 (a). The equation of motion is derived by writing Newtons 
law for a small element dx of the string. The tension T is assumed to 
be constant. 

The deflection curve during the vibration will be represented by 
some function y(x, t). That is, the ordinate varies with both the 
location along the string and with time.

The vertical component of the tension T pulling to the left

partial derivative is taken because the string is considered at a certain 
instant, i.e. t is constant in the differentiation.

which is the differential equation of motion for a vibrating uniform string. 

Assuming that the string vibrates harmonically at some natural

Thus, if the frequency of vibration is known, the remaining 
factors given, then the computation of the tension is a simple matter. 

The highly desirable feature of this method is that it permits 
the determination of the actual tension in the wire as it rests in its . 
final position stretched between the form ends. Furthermore the tension 
can be checked at any time up until the actual placing of the concrete 
commences. 

The apparatus used was relatively simple as the photograph 
Figure 2 will reveal. 

It consists of: 

(a) a magnetic pick-up 

(b) an audio oscillator 

(c) an oscilloscope 

(a) an amplifier

The amplifier may or may not be necessary depending upon local 
conditions of interference and the type of accompanying apparatus* The 
magnetic pick-up used in this investigation was constructed from the 
permanent magnet and windings of a discarded earphone, 

A schematic diagram is given (PLATE XVIH) for the hook-up used. 

The operation of the equipment is as follows: the magnetic 

pick-up is placed as close as possible to, but without at any instant 
touching, the wire whose tension it is desired to know* The wire is then 
dealt a sharp blow setting it into vibration* The audio oscillator is then 
adjusted until the screen of the oscilloscope indicates a slowly revolving 
single trace circle (or ellipse)* Finer adjustment will result in complete 
stoppage of the revolutionary motion* At this point, then, the frequency 
may be read from the dial of the audio oscillator* 

This frequency is equal to the frequency of vibration of the wire 
under study* A pre-computation of the frequency facilitates finding the 
approximate setting on the oscillator initially* 

Some interference was at first experienced from 60 cycle power 
generating installations located very near by. This problem was overcome 
by introducing a special choke circuit into the amplifier. 

It is the author*s opinion that this apparatus could be refined 
and consolidated into one self-contained unit which would be extremely 
suitable for commercial adaptation. In this regard it is suggested that 
some bridging device be designed to permit the frequency determination to 
be made constantly over some one convenient length. With this quantity 
fixed, and the range of desired stresses known, a special audio oscillator 
(or other device) could be designed to operate over a small range of 
frequencies, but calibrated to permit greater precision in reading, than 

is possible with normal laboratory equipment. 

It should be noted, of course, that this method of checking 

stress is limited to the pre-tensioning type of systems.

Method of Attaching & Waterproofing 

Wire-Resistance Strain Gauges 

A e Application of gauges to small diameter reinfor ci ng steel 

1. Using fine grade emery cloth, clean the surface of the steel wire 
in the area where the gauge is to be attached. 

2m Ensure cleanliness of this area by polishing with a piece of white 
cloth saturated in acetone. Gontinue this until no smudge is left 
on a clean piece of cloth. 

3* Apply Duco Household Cement (or Dupont No. 5458) to the back of a 
gauge from which the excess paper has been trimmed from the sides. 

Do not wait for this cement to become tacky as per some instructions. 

4« Apply the gauge to the steel wire and gently but firmly bind with a 
heavy grade cotton thread. This must be very carefully done in 
order to avoid damaging the fine wires within the gauge. At the 
completion of this step, and while the cement is still wet, check 
the alignment of the gauge. It should, of course, have its long 
axis in line with the length of the wire. 

Fig. A shows a typical gauge point at this stage of the procedure. 
Note that two gauges are required for a single gauge point, the gauges 
being placed end to end and on opposite sides of the wire. This is 
to ensure determination of a correct value of stress even if the wire 
is not straight at the time of taking the ^zero 1 * readings on the gauges.

B• Attaching lead out wires 

1. Solder lead out wires to the fine leads of the gauges. It is 
essential that the lead out wires have a waterproof insulation. 

G.E. Flamenol No. 18 has been used successfully for this. 

2. Using cotton thread, bind the soldered joint to the steel wire 
making sure that all uninsulated wire bears on the felt covering 
of the gauge. Coat liberally with Duco cement. 

3# At a point about 1" away from the end of the gauge, anchor the 
lead outs to the steel by means of a wire binding. This should 
be firm enough to take any pull that may come on the leads. This 
is extremely important, for any movement transmitted to the gauges 
in this manner can render extremely inaccurate readings. 

4* Trim off excess ends of thread and wire. See Fig. B for this step. 

C. Waterproofing the gauges 

1. Using a -§** paint brush, apply an even coat of molten "Petrolastic" 
asphalt to the gauges, the surrounding steel wire, and lead out wires. 

2. Repeat step 1 taking care to fill any holes in the first coat. A 
third coat may even be necessary. In this regard, it is better to 
use several thin layers of asphalt rather than one thick coat. 

This procedure permits the heat to dissipate more rapidly into 

the air, rather than w going in 1 ’ to the gauge. If the latter occurs 
there is a danger of the cement being scorched to the extent that 
the gauge becomes loosened from the steel. 

3. If the coating has become overly bulky In some areas, a heated 
soldering iron is useful for smoothing this out. This method also 
works well for "feathering* 1 out and sealing the edges. 

Fig. C illustrates the appearance at this point.

C. Waterproofing the gauges (contd) 

4* Finally paint on a sealing coat of pigmented aircraft dope* The 
action of the dope is twofold* 

(a) Its fluidity makes it easy to apply and thus ensures a perfect 
seal. 

(b) It has a tendency to go into solution with the other layers 
of asphalt and form a pliable substance that does not crack 
when the lead out wires are handled. 

A completed gauge point is shown in Fig* D.

Design of the Forms 

The forms used in the construction of the beams were designed to 
the following requisites• 

1. The forms were to be capable of withstanding the pre-stressing 
load without appreciable deformation, since a pre-tensioning system was to 
be used to stress the wires where the forms were to provide reaction to the 
loading jack. 

2. Some device was required to release the load on the forms to 
permit their removal from the concrete at the end of the curing period. 

3. Provision was to be made to enable beams of varying depth-width 
ratios to be constructed, 

4. They were to be durable enough to withstand continued reuse in 
future inves tigations, 

With the above points in mind it was decided that the forms should 
be constructed from structural steel. This choice is almost dictated by 
requirement (1) above. In the course of an earlier investigation of pre¬ 
stressed concrete at this University, wooden forms were used. These proved 
unsatisfactory in that an appreciable percentage of the initial prestress 
was lost due to the crushing of the wood. Moreover, this crushing effect 
was not uniform and some of the wires were materially more affected than 
others. The reuse of these forms was also not a feasible proposition. 

For the main members (i.e. the form sides) 2 - 12 H channels @ 

20*7# were selected. The bottom plates were cut from l/8 M sheet steel 
with holes provided to permit their bolting to the bottom flanges of the

channels, A pattern of holes was designed for the plates such that the 
channel spacing could be changed to permit the construction of beams vary¬ 
ing in width from 6 to 12 inches inclusive in increments of whole inches. 

Five pieces of l/4 M strap were provided to tie the top flanges 
of the channels together. 

The end plates were specified as 3/4 11 stock. Even with material 
of this thickness, a considerable loss of pre-stress was attributable to the 
deformation of the plate under load. However it must be remembered that a 
good deal of man-handling of this plate is necessary and hence material 
sufficiently thick to resist appreciable deformation becomes impractical. 

Perhaps a short length of section could be utilized to better advantage 
A copy of the detailed drawings used in ordering the forms may be found at 
the end of the report. 

The provision of a device for releasing the load placed on the 
forms during the tensioning operation, gave some difficulty. Many schemes 
were arrived at and subsequently discarded because of their complexity and/or 
cost of fabrication. The system finally adopted worked satisfactorily 
insofar as the releasing of the load was concerned. In the light of practical 
usage, it is now criticized as being comprised of too many loose parts. 

This is particularly annoying during the initial assembly stages before any 
load is present to hold the parts in place. Suggestions for improvement 
have been set forth under a general critique covering the entire investi¬ 
gation. 

The device consisted of 

2 stop plates - 10” x 9 1 * x l/2 tt 
4 L*s - 3 n x 2 W x l/2« x 9 1/8*

Reference is made at this point to the Jacking End Detail of 
the main blueprint for an assembly view of the device. 

The stop plates were welded to the outside of the channels such 
that one edge was exactly 9 M from, and parallel to, the end of the channel. 
The pieces of angle 9 1/8* in length acted as struts between the stop plates 
and the end plates. Thus a gap of l/8 M existed at all points between the 
ends of the channel and the end plates. This was sealed off inside to 
prevent the concrete mortar from filling the gap. 

The leg of the channel adjacent to the web of the channel was 
tapped at two places to receive two 5/8” diameter bolts. 

When it was desired to release the load on the forms, these bolts 
were tightened. As their ends made contact with the channel web, the angles 
were gradually forced outwards and away from the forms until they were clear 
of the stop plates and hence fell away. All bearing surfaces were machine 
finished and well greased. By using a suitable socket wrench no difficulty 
was experienced in tightening the bolts. 

Because of the l/8* gap between the channels and the end plates, 
reaction to the load must under these conditions be provided by the end of 
the concrete beam. The forms thus relieved of their load were removed with 
comparatively little difficulty. The forms appear in several of the photo¬ 
graphs of the section tt Test Procedure”.
