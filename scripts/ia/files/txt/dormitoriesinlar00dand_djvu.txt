CHAPTER I 


INTRODUCTION 

In rural communities, where the population is scattered, 

provision for high school education has long been a difficult problem. 

Before the introduction of the new high school curriculum into Alberta, 

a really energetic student could study the courses by himself and 

write the departmental examinations. This, however, is no longer possible 

since instruction under a qualified teacher is now required.^ As a 

result the facilities for giving instruction by correspondence have been 

2 

expanded and perfected. The only other alternative is for the student 
to attend some high school. For the great majority of rural children 
this is impossible because of the expense involved. Occasionally, a student 
overcomes the handicap by working for his board and room, but this 
arrangement is not ideal for study. The establishment of dormitories, 
providing cheaper lodging, brings high school education within the range 
of more rural pupils. 

The introduction of the large school unit in Alberta with its 
centralization of power made it practical to have uniformity of action 
over a large area. As has already been stated, adequate high school 
accommodation for rural students had never existed. Something now 

could b© done. 


^ExcepMon—School teachers and students twenty one years and over can 
study and write subjects is which departmental examinations are 
9 still set. 

There are approximately 3,500 students enrolled in 10,000 individual 
courses in 1341=*42.

The difficulty could be overcome in one of two ways. The divisional 
boards could build a number of rural high schools, or they could make 
use of the facilities which already existed, chiefly in towns* As 
yet all of the boards have not tackled the problem, but nevertheless 
it remains for them to meet. 

Where the second method is used dormitories have solved the 
problem of residential facilities. This investigation is a summary 
of the efforts which have been made in the province to establish and 
conduct such units. Since the Red Deer Dormitory is the largest of 
those in existence at present a very detailed study of it has been 
made, and for purposes of comparison a more general survey of the 
remainder is being presented.

CHAPTER II 


PURPOSE OF THE INVESTIGATION 


It is hoped that this work may be of value to anyone 
interested in studying the details of the large unit, particularly 
in its administrative aspect, and also to divisional boards faced 
with the situation of meeting the problem of rural high school 
education and to supervisors who might be acting in an advisory 
capacity to these boards. Conditions will vary in different divisions 
but it should be both interesting and instructive to learn, in detail, 
how the largest dormitory to date in Alberta and one of the first 
to be established, was organized and is operated. 

A determined effort is being made in Alberta at the present 
time to educate our pupils to take their place in our democracy. In 
order to carry out this mission equality of educational opportunity 
must be provided, as far as it is possible, for our students. The 
provision of dormitories may be the method of bringing high school 
facilities within the reach of rural pupils. It is hoped that this 
thesis, by surveying the situation in the whole province, will give 
some clue as to the possibilities of wider use of the principles 
involved.

CHAPTER III 


THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE RED DEER DORMITORY 

Several reasons prompted the Red Deer Divisional Board to 
decide upon the establishment of a dormitory at Red Deer. The city 
of Red Deer already had in operation an eight-room high school, and 
the board concluded that the advantages offered by such a school were 
greater than those which could be obtained in rural high schools. 

Each of the members of the teaching staff of this school was a university 
graduate with special training in his or her own subjects. The equip¬ 
ment in the school was superior to anything that could be hoped for in 
a rural high school at present. Transportation to and from rural high 
schools would present a problem in this part of the province, part¬ 
icularly in the winter when country roads are often impassable. 

The town school offered facilities for co-curricular activities. The 
Red Deer City School Board had always held a long range view concerning 
the attendance of outside students in their schools, realizing that the 
slight additional expense to them would be more than offset by the 
extra business brought to the city by the parents making Red Deer their 
trading centre because of the children’s attendance in Red Deer schools. 
Therefore no difficulty in this regard presented itself. The Divisional 
Board is required to pay thirty dollars per pupil per year tuition to 
the Red Deer School Board, but it feels that this expense is small in 
comparison to the cost of operating rural high schools. The only other 
responsibility which the Divisional Board had to assume was to provide 
living accommodation for their students. This was done in the summer 
of 1939 by establishing a dormitory in the city. In organizing the 
service the Divisional Board was very fortunate in having as supervisor

in the division Mr. L. A. Thurber, whose work in connection with the 
establishment of the first large unit in Alberta, the Berry Creek unit, 
is well known, and as their secretary an energetic, efficient and 
interested co-operator in the person of Mr. R. C. Ives. 

The tasks at hand were, first to obtain and equip a suitable 
residence, and second to secure a sufficient number of students to 
make the scheme a successful venture. In the first case the solution 
was simple since the vestry of St. Luke’s Anglican Church at Red Deer 
had at their disposal a church hall which they were willing to rent at 
the comparatively low figure of $300 a year, for one year, with the 
understanding that, should the experiment prove satisfactory, a sale 
of the property might be effected. The hall was equipped with a full 
basement containing kitchen, bathroom facilities, and a dining room 
which also might be used as a study room. With the addition of a single 
partition through the centre, the main floor could provide a boys* and 
a girls’ sleeping quarters. The dormitory was to be self-supporting, 
and an estimated monthly fee of $10 per pupil was set. The problem then 
was to find the boys and girls whose parents were willing and were in 
a financial position to co-operate in the venture. This proved more 
difficult at first. The idea was to establish dormitory facilities for 
the Red Deer Division alone. The extent of this division is shown on 
the map on page 9. An advertisement was put in the Red Deer Advocate, 
the weekly paper serving the district, and letters were sent to the 
secretaries of each rural and village school in the division. As a 
result of these moves, by the middle of August nine applications only 
had been received. At about this time the Rocky Mountain House Division

contacted the Red Deer Divisional Board with the information that 
seven pupils from their districts wished to come to the Red Deer dormitory. 
In order to make the opening of the dormitory possible by the first 
of September the applications of these seven—even though they were 
outside the bounds of the Red Deer Division—were accepted on condition 
that they pay $14.50 per month. They, together with the nine students 
already registered prompted the Board to open the dormitory. A super¬ 
intendent and a matron (a married couple) were engaged, supplies were 
obtained, and when school opened everything was in order. The courage 
and foresight of the instigators was well rewarded, for the attendance 
steadily increased until, before the end of November, it had reached 
forty-seven, near which figure it remained for the year.

Explanation of maps 

The map on page 9 gives a rough idea of the size and location 
of the Red Deer School Division, and the places outside the division 
from which students came to attend the Red Deer dormitory—the number 
of students from each being indicated in black ink for 1939-’40, in 
red ink for 1940-*41 and in green ink for 1941-*42. 

The map on page 10 shows the distribution of students within 
the Red Deer School division attending the dormitory each year the 
same scheme being followed to indicate number of students and year. 

In some cases a decrease may indicate that one or more Grade XII 
students had completed their high school work. In 1940“*41 Sylvan 
Lake school provided facilities for Grade XII education which accounts 
for the absence of those students at the Red Deer dormitory that year. 
It is to be noted however that the number of students from a district 
in most cases remains constant or increases, also that many new centres 


have been added

CHAPTER IV 


THE PLANT 

As already stated, St. Luke’s church hall was secured as a 
dormitory for the year 1939-*40 at a rent of #300 for ten months. 

This hall was free of taxation as is all school property. The main 
floor which was a single room with two small ante-rooms was divided 
down the centre by a partition and provided sleeping quarters for the 
boys and girls. The basement, consisting of a boiler room, a kitchen, 
equipped with stove and cupboards, a large dining room and two lavatories, 
was left intact—the dining room being used for study purposes in the 
evenings. The idea was to carry on with as little expenditure as 
possible for the first year until it might be seen how the experiment 
was working out. Seven hundred and fifty dollars was spent for cots 
and mattresses to equip sleeping quarters for fifty students and on© 
hundred and fifty dollars for dishes and kitchen utensils. The students 
were required to supply their own bedding and cutlery. Medical supplies 
cost fifty dollars. The superintendent and matron received a combined 
salary of eighty dollars per month for ten months. Incidentals such 
as janitor’s supplies, etc*, amounted to two hundred dollars. Books 
and supplies necessary to deal with dormitory affairs in the divisional 
board office cost one hundred dollars. The cost of food varied 
slightly from month to month but the following is fairly representitive 
for a month’s expenses in this regard for 47 students, the maximum 
registration at any one time for the first year.

Fuel cost approximately $1,000 per year, ice $30 per year 
and the Phone $33 per year. 

During the year permission was obtained from the public 
utilities commissioners to allow the supplies for the dormitory 
to be bought at wholesale price, as in hospitals, training schools 
and other public institutions. This was an appreciable aid toward 
lowering the expense* 

The Board aimed to make the dormitory self-supporting with 
the monthly charge to the students. It fell short of achieving this 
aim by $180 the first year, but this was attributed to the fact that 
some of the students withdrew before the end of June when the weather 
became fine enough for them to travel to and from their home daily. 

As a result, instead of getting $10 per month from Red Deer district 
students the average amount over a period of ten months was only $8.97 
per month. To avoid this situation reoccurring, students applying for 
dormitory accommodation for the year 1940-’41 were required to fill 


out the following form,

Due to the increased cost of living the Divisional Board 
found it necessary to increase the charge to students by $1.00 
per month in 1941. This form was altered accordingly.

Highly gratified with the successful operation of the dorm¬ 
itory for the first year, even though it showed a small deficit, the 
Divisional Board believed it advisable and a worthwhile venture to 
buy the building, to alter it extensively and equip it more fully, 
to accommodate 100 students providing they were evenly divided as to 
sex. It was now in a position to estimate the cost of operation with 
greater accuracy and to know what alterations in the building would 
prove most satisfactory. In the summer of 1940 therefore, they 
purchased the hall for $5,000 and expended $5,000 in alterations and 
$202 in renovation. The expense of redecorating was somewhat reduced 
by those interested providing free labor. New equipment to the extent 
of $2,670 was purchased. To cover the cost of the building and to 
take care of the alterations, debenture for th© sum of $10,000 was 
issued, for a term of five years, bearing interest at five and one-half 
per cent. The decorating, furniture and fixtures were bought out of 
current revenue from the Division. This should prove a comparatively 
small item in a large division whose assessment for 1940 $10,441,790. 

The total indebtedness of the Division is $54,000. If conditions 
remain normil this debt should b© practically cleared by 1946. Th© 
actual operating expenses are to be covered by th© charge made to th© 
students for board and room. 

Th© building as it now stands is well adapted to serve the 
needs as a dormitory. It is of solid brick and is steam-heated. The 
chief alterations and additional equipment are as follows: 

(1) A second floor level with the former balcony was built, 
which became the girls 1 Quarters, and complete wash-room facilities, 
toilets and bathroom facilities were provided on this floor. Curtains 
suspended from rods in the ceiling divide the girls 9 dormitory into a 
number of individual rooms giving a measure of privacy. Th© whole first

floor, with the partition which had been put in the year before 
again removed, became the boys* sleeping quarters, 

(2) In order to provide light for the girls* floor six 
dormers, three on each side, were added, 

(3) The entrance was improved and stuccoed on the outside, 

(4) The fifty beds bought the year before were traded in on 
100 new ones of a more suitable and superior type. 

(5) The kitchen was enlarged and a laundry added. 

With the opening of school for the fall term of 1940, the 
dormitory was ready to accommodate 100 students, and by the first of 
September sixty-six pupils were on hand to make use of its facilities. 
This later increased to seventy-six. Of these thirty two were boys. 

In the fall of 1941 an uneven distribution of boys—34 and 
girls—56 necessitated further alterations. The 56 girls who applied 
for admission could not be accommodated on the top floor. It was 
decided to close the stage, drop a staircase from the existing girls* 
quarters, to the stage, thus embodying it in the girls* dormitory. 

Two wash basins were removed from the matron’s private washroom and 
installed in the present girls* washroom. It also was decided to 
build a coal bin at the back of the dormitory to take care of stove 
coal. The plan following and the pictures included in the thesis 


show the building inside and out after being remodelled

Financial Statements 

No financial statement is available for the period, September 
1, 1939 (when the dormitory began to function) to December 31, 1939, 
as the dormitory expenses for these months were included in the 
general divisional expenses. The financial statement from January 1, 
1940 to December 31, 1940 can be found on page 21 and that for the 
first 10 months of 1941 on page 22. It should be noted that from 
January 1, 1940, to June 30, 1940 the number of students involved is 
approximately forty-seven and from September 1, 1940 to December 31, 
1940, seventy-six. In 1941 the school year was changed to end on 
October 31 and consequently the financial report for 1941 is for the 
first ten months of the year only. The report for 1940 which involves 
a whole year shows a balance on hand of $146.56. On October 31, 1941 
the balance had increased to $469.84.

CHAPTER V 


THE CONDUCT AND SUPERVISION OF THE DORMITORY 


The managing of the dormitory falls under the jurisdiction 
of the Red Deer Divisional Board, and it has the final authority in 
regard to any disciplinary measures which may be necessary. It 
engages the services of a superintendent and matron and had made a 
happy choice in securing Mr. and Mrs. Paxton, who had the faculty 
of maintaining sufficient control, discipline, and supervision, and 
of securing at the same time the respect and confidence of the 
students. The superintendent shares the boys* sleeping quarters and 
the matron that of the girls. After a year and a half of excellent 
service in the above capacity Mr. Paxton enlisted in the Canadian Army 
and it became necessary to engage a new superintendent and matron. 

The importance attached to their selection is illustrated by the 
following excerpt from the December 18, 1940 issue of the Red Deer 
Advocate. 


"In view of Dormitory Superintendent I. Paxton having resigned 
to join the Canadian army, the Board of the Red Deer School Division 
had at their regular monthly meeting on Saturday, the task of selecting 
a new superintendent and matron. As the success of this experiment 
depends quite largely on the quality of the supervision, the selection 
was made carefully, four of the five applicants being personally 
interviewed by the Board before a decision was made. To replace Mr. 
and Mrs. J. Paxton the Board selected and appointed Mr. and Mrs. J. 

C. Hubbs. Their home has been at Brooks, but just lately Mr. Hubbs 
has been working at the Penhold Air Training School. The salary was 
set at $80.00 per month." 

A further change in administration took place in the fall of 
1941. Miss Alice Nielson is in charge of the dormitory and is assisted 
by her parents. This arrangement is proving most satisfactory. 

The Divisional Board have drawn up regulations for the supervision 
of their dormitory an exact copy of which is included here.

A word of explanation in regard to some of these rules might be 
in order. 

An examination of rules five and seven indicates that the students 
are required to do only the routine duties that would be expected of 
them in their own homes, and special care is taken to see that they 
are not required to do any work which would detract from or interfere 
with their efficiency at school. To insure this, recently additional 
domestic help has been employed to assist the matron. Yet a certain 
amount of responsibility and co-operation to secure the tidiness of 
the building is placed on the students, which is only good citizenship 
training. In regard to rule twelve, since the Institution comes under 
Public Health rules, the Public Health Physician is called if a contagious 
disease is suspected, otherwise the family physician is called . 

Excuses for absences from school, signed by the superintendent are 
required by the High School Principal. A copy of such an excuse is 
included here.

The study period mentioned is supervised but no help with 
lessons is given. All students must be present at this study period 
on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, unless a valid excuse is 
given. 

The registering and week-end rules provide the students a 
certain amount of freedom, but at the same time enable those in control 
to know the whereabouts of and get in touch with any student at any 
time if necessary, and to make sure that students do not spend more 
than a reasonable number of evenings away from their work. In regard 
to this rule the Board made a slight change at their January 1941 meeting . 

"The Board thought too much late leave was being allowed 
students at night* It was decided definitely that students returning 
after week-ends at home must be in by ten o’clock Sunday night, or not 
to be admitted until after seven o’clock Monday morning."—Red Deer 
Advocate—Jan. 15, 1941. 

There is an elected House Committee, three boys and three girls 
with the superintendent as chairman, to deal with infringements of the 
rules* They sit once a week—Monday—and those who misbehave in a 
small way are brought before this committee. The most common punish¬ 
ment meted out is C. B. (Confined to barracks.) Occasionally kitchen 
duties and scrubbing floors are given, usually for smoking and loitering 
between floors. If the case is too difficult for the House Committee 
it may be referred to the Divisional Board for settlement* 

Ample provision is made for recreation for the dormitory students* 
They have their own sports’ association and have organized three soft 
ball teams, a boys’, a girls’ and a mixed team. Games with outsiders 
are arranged from time to time. The boys* softball team proved to be a

very good one last year. There is one basketball hoop on the dormitory 
grounds, to provide practice for anyone desiring it. In addition to 
their own organizations all dormitory students are privileged of course 
to take part in any high school sports or activities. 

The dormitory is equipped with a piano which students may use 
for sing-songs etc., at specified times. The students arrange and conduct 
their own parties. The Hallowe’en party is a yearly event—planned to 
keep the students at home that evening. Occasionally the students 
entertain their parents and friends at a social evening. The following 
excerpt from the Red Deer Advocate serves to give some idea of the 
nature of these gatherings. 


DORMITORY ENTERTAIN AT ENJOYABLE CONCERT 

Pupils in the School Division Dormitory entertained their parents 
and friends at a concert in the Dormitory on Friday evening. The entire 
program was the wor£ of the pupils, without any outside assistance, and 
was prepared in about ten days. It was greatly enjoyed by the audience 
which included several members of the Divisional Board. Enid Rowan was 
convener of the program, and J. Paxton, superintendent of the Dormitory, 
acted as master of ceremonies. Those taking part in the concert included: 
Phyllis Davidson and Margaret Martin, piano solos; Clifford Sande and 
J ulius Czotter; pearl Kennedy and Bernard Smith in a dialogue; Edward 
Lewis, Dick Shufeldt, Vernon Gordon and Robert Johnson in a quartette; 
Enid and Phyllis Rowan, Phyllis Davidson, Esther McAllister, Mona and 
Heather Steel, in a sextette; Robert Johnson and Patricia Robertson in 
vocal solos; Ethel McAllister in a tap dance, and Jim McKinnon in a 
monologue. A chorus of ten girls, led by Betty Stonhouse, sang part 
songs. 

Refreshments were served by the pupils, and some community 
singing followed with R. C. Ives at the piano. There were about one 
hundred present, and an informal discussion of dormitory affairs and 
an inspection of the building followed. Members of the Board present 
were: A. A. Stonhouse, chairman; P. S. Cull and R. DePauw, and several 
helpful suggestions were made by the visitors for the operation of 
the dormitory.

Last year the Red Deer Rotary Club entertained the dormitory 
students at dinner. The students are free also to go to and take part 
in all High School parties or functions, and such lectures or programs 
in the town as are deemed advisable by those in charge. As a result 
the students obtain as much or more recreation of the right type as 
they would if they were living in their own homes.

CHAPTER VI 


SCHOLASTIC RESULTS 


But most important of all, of course, is the progress in 
school of the dormitory students, since this is the primary aim 
and objective of the dormitory. 

In the first place the diagrams following showing the per¬ 
centage of town and country students for the years 1933-*39, 1939-*40, 
1940- , 41, 1941- , 42 seem to indicate that more rural students are being given 
the opportunity to attend high school, due to a place of residence 
being provided for them with satisfactory supervision and at a reasonable 
charge. As the dormitory grows in size and develops further it may 
be expected that this charge will be still further reduced.

It is difficult at present to find any satisfactory basis for 
a comprehensive analysis of the progress of the dormitory students, 
because of the short period of time that the dormitory has been in 
operation. The problem is still further complicated because we are 
dealing with groups of students of different abilities. For the 
year 1939- f 40 the average I. Q. of the dormitory students is 101.5 
as compared with 104.5 for the other group. The average final mark 
of the dormitory group is 56.6 as against 57 for the other students. 

A difference of .4 marks infavor of the students outside of the 
dormitory is achieved by a difference in I. Q. of 3 points. This 
would seem to suggest that the students in the dormitory apply them¬ 
selves better them the other group. The following correlation tables 
show the relation between the average final mark and the Intelligence 
Quotient for the year 1939-’40, of both dormitory and non-dormitory 
students of Grades X, XI, and XII. The values of r obtained would 
seem to indicate that the marks of the dormitory students do not 
correspond as closely to those which their I. Q*s warrant as do the 
marks of the other group.

The study of the scholastic attainments of the two groups 
for the year 1940-*41 gives a somewhat different picture from the 
analysis for 1939-*40. The average mark for the dormitory student 
is 55.01 with an average I. Q. of 106.61. For non-dormitory 
students the average mark is 56.03 while the average I. Q,. is 106.55. 
The correlation tables following give r a value of .280 for the 
dormitory and .288 for non-dormitory. There is a very slight 
suggestion of superiority of non-dormitory students over dormitory 
but the difference is too small to be significant. It would appear 
that for this year the dormitory students more nearly equal in 
application and progress those of the other group.

It is impossible to estimate how often the dormitory is 
going to give individual students with particular interests or 
aptitudes the opportunity to develop them. At least one case has 
come to our notice this year. A Grade XII dormitory student is 
acting at present as laboratory assistant in Chemistry, at his own 
request. In this capacity he supervises students who have missed 
some of the exercises. This task is carried on during study periods 
when the regular teacher is not available. The work is of special 
importance to students who have been unfortunate in getting a late 
start, and his assistance is much appreciated by them. 

More and more we are coming to realize that the training of 
a high school student to take his place in school activities and later 
in community and business life is equally as important as his academic 
standing, and the inclusion of such subjects as drama, music, physical 
training, general shop, household economics, the commercial subjects, 
etc., in the new course of studies indicates this. Again we have no 
accurate means of knowing how the dormitory students are measuring up 
in this regard, due to the short time the dormitory has been in operation 
The social and recreational organizations already mentioned indicates 
a move in the right direction. It seems reasonable that the very nature 
of the experiment should give these rural students an opportunity to 
live in larger groups, to mingle with town students, to gain wider 
contacts and outlooks than would be possible in more or less isolated 
farm homes, and thus to become better citizens no matter what path of 
life they may choose later on. Moreover each has this chance along 
with others with much the same background and under similar circumstances 
and at a time when he or she is younger and can make adjustments more 
easily than if school days were completed first.

CHAPTER VII 


CONCLUSION FOR RED DEER DORMITORY 

It seems fair then to give a great deal of credit to the 
Red Deer Divisional Board for their courage and foresight in starting 
the Red Deer Dormitory and in maintaining it so successfully to the 
present. They hope that as the venture grows they will conduct it 
for the Red Deer school division a one—although they intend to 
allow those seven outside students who made its opening possible to 
continue to stay at the dormitory until their high school course is 
completed, if they so desire. Between fifty and sixty per cent of 
the students using this residence declare that lack of financial 
resources would have prevented them from attending high school had 
the dormitory plan not been in operation at Red Deer. The arrange¬ 
ment is not yet ideal and some changes will have to be made from time 
to time. One of the most urgent additions required at present is 
that of a study room. 

Perhaps the surrounding divisions will follow the example 
of the Red Deer Division and form their own dormitories. In fact 
the Ponoka Division has already done so, and other dormitories also 
are operating in the province. If the Department of Education can 
see its way clear at some future date to give grants to such 
institutions—as it does at present for transporting students to and 
from rural high schools—this will aid in the growth of the movement. 
The Red Deer Dormitory then will be one of the pioneers in the field 
in developing the dormitory idea to provide High School Rural Education 
in the province.

CHAPTER VIII 


OTHER DORMITORIES IN ALBERTA 


In order to offer a comparison with the Red Deer Dormitory 
and to get a picture of the dormitory situation throughout the 
province, a questionnaire was sent to the superintendents of the 
divisions which have dormitories in operation. The questionnaire 
can be found on the page immediately following this introduction. 

The information gathered in this manner of necessity gave 
only a sketchy picture of the situation which exists in each locality 
contacted. In order to supplement the material other methods had to 
be used. The most satisfactory involved an actual visit to the 
dormitory which was being studied. In other cases superintendents 
supplied extra material which was available and which contained much 
valuable information. A year book edited by the pupils in the Taber 
Dormitory was sent to me by Mr. A. B. Evenson and the book gave a 
very clear picture of the situation there. 

From the accounts of the different set-ups it will be seen 
that the general scheme which has been followed is very similar in 
all cases. For the most part the price charged to students per month 
does not vary greatly over the province. It will be noticed, however, 
that the need for dormitory accommodation is probably greater in the 
southern part of the province which is the most sparsely populated. 
Finally, the advantages and disadvantages involved in the operation 
of dormitories will be found to be much the same in the different 
localities. These, however, will be dealt with more fully in the 
conclusion.

CHAPTER IX 


THE TABER DORMITORIES 

The Taber dormitories began operation in the year 1938-’39 
with 18 students taking advantage of the facilities offered. Since 
then the number accommodated has fluctuated between 20 and 30. The 
boys and girls occupy separate buildings. The girls’ dormitory is 
rented for $22.50 per month, and the building used by the boys has 
been purchased for $1200.00. 

One dining room is used for both boys and girls. A lady is 
in charge of the girls’ dormitory and a male teacher supervises the 
boys. For this service he is given his room and board. The lady 
supervisor receives $30.00 per month. 

The charge to the students for staying at the dormitories 
has varied. In 1938-’39 it was $7.00 per month per student. In 
the following year the cost was changed to $10.00 per month for each 
student. However, the $10.00 includes a $.75 per month fee to a 
local physician and other unspecified charges, while the $7.00 rate 
mentioned does not involve any extras. 

Due to the sparsely populated area which these dormitories 
serve, they fill a real need in the lives of their rural youth. The 
authorities are very well satisfied with the arrangement. They have 
found that the scholastic record of dormitory students compares very 
favorably with that of the other students probably being slightly 
superior, in their opinion. Any difficulties which have arisen in 
the operation of these dormitories have been due to misunderstandings 
between the parties involved. It is the opinion of those in charge that 
special efforts should be made to make all obligations involved as 
definite as possible.

"School Progress"—a Toronto Magazine published an article, 
illustrated by pictures, describing the set-up of the Taber dormitory 
written by Mr. R. V. McCullough who was supervisor of the Taber 
division at the time of the dormitory’s establishment—1938-»39. It 
aptly describes the handicaps which faced the rural population of 
Southern Alberta in regard to high school education and what was done 
to overcome them. With the permission of the writer the article is 
quoted below. 


The handicaps of rural students are disappearing under the 
large unit scheme. School dormitories are solving the problem for 
isolated students. 


For as long as we can remember, the people living in the rural 
areas have had to cope with the problem of obtaining instruction for 
their children, against great disadvantages. Students who have com¬ 
pleted the elementary work in the rural schools, and who wish to 
proceed with secondary education, are faced with two alternatives. 


They may remain in the home school, where they hope to receive 
sufficient of the teacher’s time to gain credits in high school units. 
Such a plan is not without attendant difficulties. The teacher is res¬ 
ponsible for the instruction in the elementary grades, which has the 
first claim on her time. The equipment for rendering senior instruction 
is generally inadequate. Teaching time will not permit the offering of 
any varied programme which is so essential in the revised course of 
studies for Alberta. Obviously, the opportunities available for second¬ 
ary education in the one roomed school cannot be expected to measure 
up to a reasonable standard, and the net result is a discouraged 
disappointed student. 


The other alternative is to obtain tuition at one of the school 
centres. This plan is not devoid of difficulties. Parents are ever 
hesitant in permitting their children to remain away from home unsuper¬ 
vised. It is necessay to obtain suitable living accommodations with a 
reputable family. Suoh accommodations, when found are costly, and, 
when increased by the contributory tax to the local district, takes an 
amount which is often beyond the means of the average family. 


A Receiving a high school education in a one-roomed school has now 
become an impossibility due to changes in Department of Education 
regulations.

Especially is this true of those residents of the drought areas 
where for a series of years, lean crops have brought many parents 
to face the possibility of, and in some cases the necessity of 
abandoning their homes. 

The time has been long overdue when procedures should be 
taken to make the advantages for the rural students comparable 
with those for students of urban centres. To this end, the school 
divisions are concentrating their efforts. 

In the initial year of operation, the Taber Division instituted 
van services to collect the senior students from adjoining districts, 
and carry them to the school centre. Transportation allowances were* 
made available to the isolated students, who looked after their own 
accommodations. The difficulties encountered by the latter group 
were mainly their inability to obtain tuition in a graded high school 
near their homes, the securing of suitable accommodations at a rate 
within their means, and the lack of supervision for the students. 

The difficulty to the division was the cost involved for this group. 

At the close of the term, divisional authorities and parents alike, 
were ready and anxious for a revised plan, which might develop into 
a permanent arrangement. 

The students under consideration are located in no fewer 
than eighteen districts. The average school centre is over twelve 
miles, and the mo3t remote student's home is some thirty-five miles 
distant. From this it is obvious that high schools in this area are 
few and far between. Not only are these pupils drawn from a considerable 
distance, but they are also widely scattered. 

It would be an impossibility to establish a central high 
school for daily attendance by these students. A large part of the 
area from which they are drawn is now extremely thinly populated, as 
a result of many dry years. Other sections of the area are lands 
leased for grazing purposes. The net result of both of these factors 
is that roads, on the whole, are either neglected entirely or have 
little work done on them. Even if they were maintained, the winter 
snows would undoubtedly block them for some part of the winter at 
least. Thus a system of school vans could not possibly operate under 
such conditions with any degree o t success, and even if it were possible, 
the cost would be prohibitive. 

The only plan which appeared capable of meeting the needs of 
this group of students involved the institution of dormitories. 

The history of school dormitories in Alberta dates back to 
1932, when the first establishment developed at Duchess, Alberta. Mr. 
Fred Betton has given long and faithful service to this institution, 
which has become popular among the people of the area. A few years 
later a similar plan was instituted at Big Valley. Expansion of the 
movement ceased at this point, until the introduction of the large unit 
of administration into Alberta in the year 1937.

In 1938, the Sullivan Lake and Berry Creek school divisions 
provided these facilities at Taber and at Armada. The Taber dormitories 
serve eighteen students under the supervision of Mr. and Mrs. W. Van 
Orman and Mr. B. Walker, while twenty more are in residence at Armada 
under the direction of Miss Margaret Davis and Mr. A. T. Elder. 

The dormitory arrangements are as follows: The girls are 
housed in the building under the supervision of a lady teacher. The 
boys live in another house, and are supervised by a male teacher. One 
cook and the one dining table serve all the students and supervisors 
at each plant. The school division assumes the cost of providing 
suitable buildings, permanent equipment, heat, light, water, supervision 
and the cook. The cost for these items to the division is running 
at $3.00 to $4.00 per month. 

Parents of the students attending provide food, beds, bedding, 
and equipment for the rooms. The cost to the parents is approximately 
$7.00 per month, of which not more than $2.00 in cash is required the 
balance being paid by credits obtained from supplying eggs, butter, 
vegetables, meat, and other food materials. All produce which is 
brought in is credited to the account of the person bringing it, at 
the same rate for which it would be purchased elsewhere. The milk 
supply is gained from cows supplied by different parents in turn. 

Credit is given for the value of the milk less the cost of the feed 
supplied to the cow. 


One boy has been able to meet his board bill for the month 
from the net return from his cow. Another student has paid his 
expenses for a week with four pounds of butter and four dogen eggs. 

A parent who paid $21.50 per student per month in the city in the 
previous year has been able to supply a large quantity of vegetables 
on his account. This, he says, is "found money," as he would have 
been unable to realize much for these commodities, had they been 
disposed of elsewhere. The operation of the dormitory is administered 
by the supervisors,who, in conference with the parents and officials 
of the division frafted the governing regulations. Most of the work 
about the dormitory is performed by the students, all of whom take 
their turns as outlined in the schedule. Duties include preparation 
of vegetables, dish washing, waiting tables, cleaning rooms, waxing 
floors, caring for and milking the cows, carrying coal and water, and 
other janitor services, briefly, the type and amount of work the child 
in the average home would do. The following schedule forms the basis 
for the daily routine.

Every Monday evening from 8:00 to 8:30 a devotional period 
is led by Rev. A. L. Elliot. Students are permitted one evening 
each week to go to approved places for amusement or recreation, but 
they must return to the dormitory by 10:00 P.M. An additional 
evening may be devoted to Youth school club meetings. 

The benefits of the dormitory plan are beyond question. I 
would especially mention the case of a student who has spent all of 
the time previously alone in the grade eleven by the one-room school 
type of instruction, supplemented by correspondence courses, and has 
a desire to proceed to university directly the grade twelve is completed. 
The values derived from the association with other students in their 
social experiences will prove to be a great asset to this individual 
in making the necessary adjustments in theinitial year at university. 

The separate letters from students and parents indicate many other 
advantages, and the feelings which exist toward the dormitory plan 
in this school division. 

While problems have arisen from time to time, none have 
proved to be very difficult to solve. In these solutions, the tact, 
good judgment and sincerity of the supervisors indicate the quality 
of these individuals who have been chosen as administrators. Undoubt¬ 
edly much of the success which has been achieved is attributable 
to their untiring efforts and fine qualities of leadership, which are 
so all important in such a venture. The degree of success is reflected 
in the spontaneous response and co-operation of a fine group of students. 
To them, also, credit must be given for their efforts in making this 
initial venture a success. 

The experience of five months of operation proves, beyond a 
doubt, that such an establishment may be operated cheaply and efficiently. 
The possibilities of such a system are as yet unplumbed. The scope 
of the venture is capable of any amount of enlargement. It seems to 
be the answer to the difficult problem of providing a high school 
education for isolated students.

Sorae idea of the attitude of both students and parents toward 
the Taber dormitories can be gathered from the letters which follow. 
These were taken from a year book published by the students. 

The Students* Impressions of the Dormitory 

To-night, when I returned from a refreshing gymnastic class, 

I was asked to give an opinion of the dormitory. My first thought 
was **I have just been taking advantage of one of its benefits—the 
chance to attend the Youth Training programme for physical well being.** 
We now have an equal chance with the town students to keep in condition 
for spring track and field meets. Also, we can play team games, such 
as basketball, hockey and tennis. The participation in athletics is 
one of the most attractive advantages of the dormitory plan. 

We are here to get an education. This comes first, and is 
well arranged for—quiet study hours, tables. Our records at school 
prove that our school work is by no means neglected. We have the ad¬ 
vantages of instruction from teachers who are specialists in their 
departments and have a wider range of subjects to choose from than 
we ever had, or could get in our country schools. 

The dormitory life provides valuable training for later years. 
Selfishness and prejudices are forgotten, and we learn to get along 
with different types of people. We learn that it is necessary to give 
and take in order to obtain a smooth running, happy, group life. An 
example of the co-operative spirit of the students is shown by the 
following incident: one boy accidently broke a large, expensive window 
at the dormitory, and everyone agreed that we should all contribute 
a small amount to pay for it, rather than let the one person stand the 
whole expense. 

We all have duties and daily tasks to do. We soon learned 
that they had to be done, and the easiest way is to do our best, and 
do it pleasantly. We learn to take care of our own possessions and 
to look after our rooms. We hope that our mothers will see a difference 
in this regard when we return home. 

In mentioning the advantages of the dormitory which are 
appreciated by the different members of the resident body, all agree 
that the social opportunities are very appealing. One suggests that 
the necessity of making our own decisions, instead of running to our 
parents with every little problem is giving good training, and is 
developing self confidence. Another said, **I*d hate to be walking 
thre8 miles to school this cold weather, as I had to last year.” One 
student suggested that what she liked about the dormitory wa3 the big 
bathtub. Several students intimated that, without the dormitory plan, 
it would have been impossible for them to have attended school this year. 

We all agree that, ”The dorm*s the thing," and we unite in 
expressing our appreciation to those responsible for its inception.

A Parent’s Letter 


In reply to your letter, asking me to give a parent’s opinion of 
the Taber dormitory, I trust the following remarks will be helpful. 

Much of the success of such institutions depends on the super¬ 
visors, and I feel that we are fortunate in having secured the services of 
Mr. and Mrs. Van Orman, and I am sure they are largely responsible for the 
auspicious start the dormitory has been given. A happy choice was made 
in the selection of Mr. Walker to supervise the boys. 

I found a cheerful, restful, atmosphere at the dormitory and every¬ 
thing seemed to work in a smooth, orderly manner giving indication of 
good household management. I noted particularly, the kindly but firm 
discipline which was being exercised, and which we must persist in as a 
foundation for character stability in young people. 

Having talked with several of the students casually, I found all of 
them well satisfied with their comfortable surroundings, and each spoke of 
the good fellowship existing among them all. It was with added interest 
I noted how each student applied her or himself cheerfully to the alloted 
work. This, in itself, is excellent training for the girls, and a subject 
I would like to see more generally adopted in our school system, as, 
generally speaking, and I think I am conservative when I say, it is the 
ultimate vocation of ninety per cent of our girls, while only about ten 
per cent of them receive adequate training for such a vocation. 

The boys have not been neglected either, as I found work benches 
and trappings of hobbies in the basement. Mr. Van Orman, himself' an 
instructor in manual training, has been generous in passing on his know¬ 
ledge to the boys, and has also interested girls and boys alike in sport. 
This, I feel is necessary for healthy bodies, and as a rest for ambitious 
minds. 


While enjoying dinner with them all, I noticed their meals were 
well cooked and nicely served, and I understand from the students they 
enjoy a pleasing variation at all times in their menu, and what is quite 
important to growing bodies, they have abundance of it. The cost of board 
has been well within the means of each student and is so modest it could 
not be duplicated for any less in their own homes. 

The devotional period of one hour each week fills a very necessary 
need in these turbulent times, strengthening the young people on the road 
to life. 


In closing, I would add my appreciation to all who are responsible 
for the institution of the Taber dormitory. I see in such, great need in 
this large, sparsely populated country, and best of all, for the sadly 
neglected rural child. 

As you must know, in your capacity, we are not developing our best 
talents to-day. It is rather the more fortunate child whose parents have 
financial means to educate him who is able to grasp the opportunities. We 
will go still further when we institute scholarships enabling the students 
of merit to go on to university honors.

CHAPTER X 


E. I. D. AND BOW VALLEY DIVISIONS 

The E. I. D. and Bow Valley divisions have been operated under 
one supervisor, Mr. R. V. McCullough, and since the same type of organ¬ 
ization is used in the four dormitories operated by these divisions 
they will be grouped together. Residences are located at Duchess, Cluny, 
Bassano and Brooks and the account of each which follows will be in 
that order. 

Duchess 

Two buildings are used to accommodate outside students at 
Duchess. One is used by the girls and the other by the boys. The plan 
has been in operation for 11 years under the supervision of the principal 
of the school—Mr. Ered Betton. The progress and results of the operation 
of these dormitories is of special interest as they have functioned 
for a long period under a supervisor who has striven to make the enter¬ 
prise a success. 

The building used by the girls was purchased for $1800.00 and 
that used by the boys cost $450.00. The principal supervises the boys 
and receives free board, a matron does the cooking as well as being in 
charge of the girls and receives a salary of $300.00 per year for her 
services. The charge to the students is $2.00 per month. The arrange¬ 
ment which allows for such a low cost can be understood by referring to 
page 52. Six students took advantage of the facilities offered 11 years 
ago. At that time 18 pupils attended the school at Duchess in grades 8, 
9, 10, and 11. At present 46 pupils are enrolled in grades 9,10, 11, and 
12. The dormitories are unable to accommodate more than the 28 now 
using the facilities and others are anxious to come.

The record of the high school on departmental examinations 
over ten years averages 87 % pass. Most of the failures were among 
day students. The scholastic achievements of the pupils in attendance 
at the dormitories are, therefore, very impressive. 

No student government has been found necessary. Attempts to 
introduce it proved unpopular, as it divided the students into groups. 

The supervisor allots the pupils certain duties according to schedule. 

This has proven very satisfactory. 

Due to Mr. Betton's long experience his criticisms both favor¬ 
able and unfavorable are especially worthy of consideration. They are 
quoted in full below. 

n Over the period of ten years during which I have been in charge 
of a dormitory I have found a great many advantages afforded to the 
student. The orderly system and the individual responsibility placed 
upon the student is of as much value as the subjects on the curriculum. 

The pupil who otherwise would be isolated is brought into contact with 
others his own age and by easy means becomes accustomed to working in 
groups and to realizing his responsibility. A wholesome social attitude 
and an ease among others results. More students attend high school and 
the school becomes much more important in their lives. They are encouraged 
to study and are set in surroundings where study is possible. Honor and 
clean speech are developed in the student and these are essential in the 
moulding of character. 

The dormitory places a heavy load upon the teacher who is willing 
to apply himself and he must make sacrifices and use a great deal of 
diplomacy as well as exercise constant vigilance. There is a chance that 
a teacher might not realize this before matters go beyond his control." 


Cluny 

The Cluny dormitory is in its third year of operation. The 
number of students accommodated each year has been slightly in excess 
of 30. A charge of $8.50 per month has been made to each student but 
the ac-tual cost has often been less than this and refunds have been made 
to students. The work of supervision has been carried on by two high 
school teachers who have received room and board as their compensation. 
Due to the extra supervision which the dormitory students receive their

percentage of subjects passed has been far better than that of the other 
students. 

Bassano 

The dormitory at Bassano is also in its third year of operation. 
The building utilized is rented for $18.00 per month and $370.00 has 
been spent on alterations. Approximately 10 students have used the 
residence each year. The charge per student per month is $5.25. The 
supervision has been in charge of a high school teacher who received 
board and room in return. The scholastic record of the dormitory students 
compares very favorably and perhaps is a little better than that of the 
day students. 

The following criticisms have been offered by the supervisor: 

n Boys and girls should be housed in separate buildings. There 
should be a student government with monitors. Outside the study periods 
sports activities and a few social functions should occupy most of the 
students’ time." 

Financial report of Bassano School Dormitory 

There were nineteen students in the dormitory during the school 
year, the total student months being 164 on the ten month school basis. 

All bills are paid to date and the value of the produce brought in by 
the students was actually greater than the market price; thereby giving 
the students a decided advantage in bringing in such produce. Below is 
a summary of a detailed expense account, for the year 1940-’41.

Brooks 


The dormitory at Brooks is in its second year of operation. 

The cost of the dormitory and equipment to the division was $5,085.00. 
Thirty-one students attended this dormitory in 1940-’41, 17 being girls. 
The charge made to each student per month is |6.00. 

In the past three years, high school attendance has increased 
100$ in the E. I. D. School Division and 74$ in the Bow Valley Division. 
This data gives a clear picture of the manner in which the establishment 
of dormitories has increased the attendance of rural students in high 
schools. 


The rules which the dormitory students are expected to follow 
are the same for all four dormitories and follow immediately. 


Purpose The dormitory is maintained for the convenience of students to 
provide a means of acquiring a high school education at a 
minimum cost of living. It is your school and your dormitory 
supported by the people of the district for your benefit. You 
may make it a success or a failure according to your actions 
and your attitude while you are here. It is your loss or gain 
accordingly. 


Your Always be ready to do that which you are asked to do. Uphold 
Attitude your part in the operation of the dormitory rather than cast 

your duties on others. Don’t look for trouble or try to criticize 
but be broad enough to realize that those in charge are doing 
their best to be fair to everybody. If you have any remarks to 
make, tell them to the supervisors, not to strangers who in many 
cases have no more interest in the institution than to attach 
to it a questionable reputation. Remember, you are a part of 
the dormitory and are criticized along with it. 


Rules 

1, All students unless given special permission must rise at seven 
o’clock A. M. 

2, Duties assigned to each student must be completed to avoid 
delaying others who have work assigned to them, and at the time 
indicated.

CHAPTER XI 


LOYALTY DORMITORY 

Loyalty is the name of a school district in the Red Deer 
Division, The school is approximately 42 miles southeast of Red Deer 
and 8 miles west of Huxley. The people of this district possess a very 
fine co-operative spirit. Their interest in the well being of all the 
members of the community undoubtedly prompted them to become interested 
in the establishment of a dormitory. In this endeavor they have been 
able to add considerably to their educational facilities. Efforts which 
bring fruit not only tend to hold a progressive group to-gether but 
also give encouragement to go forth with renewed vigor. 

Loyalty had a two-roomed school and a teacherage. The divisional 
board purchased an old school in the vicinity and moved it to the grounds. 
A full basement was constructed under the acquired building and a portion 
of it was equipped with the necessary facilities for teaching shop. 

The first floor was remodelled to serve as a dining room for all of the 
dormitory students and also as living quarters for the principal and 
his wife (Mr, and Mrs. Aldrich) who have charge of the enterprise. A 
third floor was added which became the sleeping quarters for the 16 girls 
who were accommodated. The 4 boys who took advantage of the project 
were housed in the old teacherage. 

The operational costs of this dormitory have been kept at a 
minimum. Supplies are purchased at wholesale prices from MacDonald’s 
Consolidated in Calgary and are trucked in. The arrangement which allows 
this to be done has already been referred to in the Red Deer set-up. 

The charge made to students is §10.00 per month for those who spend their 
week-ends at home and §12,00 for ones who stay week-ends as well.

If an individual uses the facilities for a portion of a month only, a 
charge of $.55 per day is made. This privilege is allowed under special 
circumstances. The dormitory is self-supporting. 

In order to facilitate study, the principal supervises a study 
period each evening in the school. This arrangement, although very 
burdensome to the teacher involved, is vastly superior to the scheme 
used in many dormitories of having a number of pupils working at a table. 

A comparison of the scholastic achievements of students staying at the 
dormitory and at home was determined at Loyalty by a close study of the 
difference in results which followed when pupils moved either from or 
to the dormitory. It was found in all cases that when a student left 
the dormitory during the year his scholastic record suffered as a result. 
This is easily understandable when attention is focused on the method 
of study used. 

The high school population in the school increased from 15 in 
1939- f 40 to 25 in 1940-*41. The increase of 10 the year the dormitory 
was opened would indicate that the experiment brought high school facilities 
to those who would otherwise have been deprived of them. The parents 
in this community are quite definite in their view that they prefer to 
have educational facilities and living accommodation expanded at Loyalty 
rather than to send their children to Red Deer. The reasons advanced 
in support of this contention were, not only would their children be 
nearer home, but the older pupils give a certain leadership to others in 
the community and they did not wish to lose that leadership. 

The authorities in charge of the enterprise are well pleased with 
the results of the first year's operation. The one marked defect of 
the scheme is also realized by them—the responsibility of the principal

is too great. Some other method of supervising evening study should be 

devised, even though its effectiveness may be somewhat impaired. 

The rules and regulations used follow. 

1. Furnish the following: 

(a) Plate, knife, fork, apron, spoon, cup, saucer, fruit 
dishes, porridge dish, chair. 

(b) Toilet articles: face towel, face cloth, soap. 

2. Wash in own room. 

3. Keep own bed neat and tidy. 

4. Quiet study hours in the school from 7:00 to 9:30 P. M. 

5. Lights out and quiet after 10:00 P. M. 

6. Permission must be given in order to leave the school premises, 
to attend meetings, dances, clubs, or for any other purpose. 

7. Student will notify those responsible for the running of the 
dormitory, whether or not they intend to stay each week-end. 

8. Meals will be served at the following hours: 

Breakfast 8:00 A* M., Dinner 12:10 P. M., Supper 5:30 P. M. 

9. Each student is responsible for the making of his/her own bed. 
This bed must be made before coming down to breakfast. 

10. Special duties will be assigned to each student, and these tasks 
must be done promptly, and to the best of the student’s ability. 

11. If at any time there are any students who do not wish to do 
certain duties, and who can give a good reason why he/she is 
not able to do the task appointed, it may be possible to get 
tasks arranged so that certain other tasks may be assigned to 
these particular students. 

12. Smoking will not be permitted under any circumstances in any 
building on the school grounds at any time, by students of the 
dormitory. 

13. Dormitory accommodation will be refused to any student breaking 
any of the above rules or regulations. (Sufficient warning will

CHAPTER XII 


WHEATLANDS DIVISION 
KATHRYN DORMITORY 

Kathryn is a village in the Wheatlands division. It has a 
three-roomed school which is divided into elementary, intermediate and 
high. The capacity of the school is being taxed at present and a 
fourth room probably will be added in the near future. 

The dormitory was opened in 1939- f 40, 12 students being acc¬ 
ommodated in a large house. Two weeks before school opened in Sept¬ 
ember 1940, a total of 55 applications were received for admission 
to the dormitory. This large number of applicants caught the divisional 
board wholly unprepared, but by renting a basement, they were able to 
accommodate 9 boys, and 15 girls were kept in the dormitory building. 

It is only natural that rural people who depend on crops for their 
incomes should wait as long as possible before committing themselves 
to a definite expenditure. However, if some planning could possibly 
be done in order to give educational opportunities to their children, 
the divisional authorities would be given an opportunity of pla n ning 
in order to take care of the demand on their facilities from year to 
year. At present there has been a great deal of rushing during the 
last few days in order to meet an unexpected demand. 

During the summer of 1941, the building was moved to the school 
grounds and $4,747.25 was spent on improvements. The division has 
invested a total of $5,947.25 in the project including the purchase 
price of the dormitory. A matron is paid $50.00 per month for super¬ 
vising the girls, while a high school teacher receives board and room 
for his work with the boys. The charge made to the students this year 
is $15.00 and $12.00, the former being the charge made to students who

do not go home week-ends while the latter is made to students who use 
the facilities for five days of the week only. 

The dormitory has been of real assistance to rural pupils who 
are desirous of obtaining a high school education and their scholastic 
records indicate that they have taken advantage of the opportunities 
offered to them. 


For the ten months ending October 31, 1941, the dormitory has 
been self-supporting. The total receipts were $1,175.44, while the 
payments made were $1,175.21 leaving a surplus of $.23. 


The rules and regulations for 1941- f 42 follow. 

1. The matron and supervisor of the boys shall have full 

authority regarding the care and management of the 
dormitory and the conduct of the student boarders, other

CHAPTER XIII 


HOLDEN DORMITORIES 

The Holden Division has established and maintained two 
dormitories, one at Holden established 3 years ago and the other at 
Bruce which has operated for 4 years. The upstairs over a store in 
Holden is utilized for the purpose; in Bruce a house is being used. 

The rent paid by the division for these buildings is $20.00 at Holden 
and $10.00 at Bruce. A young woman is in charge at Holden and is given 
$25.00 per month for her services. The charge made to the students 
is $7.50 per month at Holden while at Bruce the rate is $6.50 per month. 
These costs per pupil are among the lowest of any operating dormitories 
in the province and it can be readily understood that rural pupils are 
given a valuable service at an extraordinarily low price. The number 
of students accommodated was 24 at Holden and 9 at Bruce in 1940- 1 41. 

The scholastic record of these students has been found to compare 
favorably with the others. 

The following criticisms both favorable and unfavorable have 
been given by those in charge of the scheme. 

Favorable—"Cost per pupil is low, food is excellent, the 
menus being prepared by the Home Economic teacher. Brings students 
to better high school facilities and provides high school education 
for many who otherwise would not get it." 

Unfavorable--"Present building accommodations are not 
satisfactory. Evening recreation is a problem—no playground."

CHAPTER XIV 


HANNA DORMITORY 

The Hanna Dormitory was established in 1938 and it has 
accommodated a student population which has fluctuated between 20 
and 30 since then up to the present. The charge made to the students 
is $.45 per day. The building is rented for $35.00 per month and the 
students are supervised by a high school teacher who receives an extra 
$25.00 per month for the services involved. 

The dormitory, though small, has increased the rural population 
attending high school, and the scholastic record of those using the 
facilities compares very favorably with that of the other students. 
Pupils, parents, and trustees are very favorably impressed with the 
scheme and much prefer this method of getting tuition for their grade 
12 students to correspondence courses. The pupils learn the art of 
getting along together and shouldering responsibility, in taking care 
of property and finance. The authorities believe that these advantages 
make the dormitory scheme most worthwhile. One unfavorable criticism 
is also advanced which is worthy of our attention. Some students do 
not like to study in a group and individual rooms are too costly to 
be provided without a marked increase in the charge to the students. 

The problem of overcoming the disadvantages of group study is one 
which many dormitories—especially the larger ones—will be forced 
to face in the future.

CHAPTER XV 


PONOKA DIVISION DORMITORY 


The Ponoka Division opened a dormitory at Lacombe in September 
1940, with 8 boys and 12 girls using the residence. The building was 
purchased for $3,500.00 and a charge of $11.00 per month is made to 
the students. The superintendent receives a salary of $750.00 per year. 
The project was resumed in 1941 with practically the same set-up. The 
rural population attending high school has been increased by the dormitory 
and it has been found that the scholastic standing of the students 
compares very favorably with that of the others. Student government 
and rules for the superintendent and pupils to follow have been put 
in force. 

The following criticisms both favorable and unfavorable have 
been given by those in charge of the enterprise. 

Favorable—"Students have superior supervision during free 
hours. Supervision of homework is reflected in good term marks. 

Pupils are taught home economics." 

Unfavorable—"It is difficult to secure the co-operation of 
parents to have their children do as rules require."

CHAPTER XVI 


DRUMHELLER DORMITORY 


The Drumheller dormitory was opened during the year 1940-*41 
with 22 boys and 21 girls using the facilities. A substantial building 
was purchased for $15,000.00 to provide housing accommodation. A 
charge of $10.00 per month was made to the students. The dormitory 
is supervised by a man and woman. 

The authorities do not believe that the rural population 
attending high school has been increased by the enterprise. They 
have found that the scholastic record of pupils using the dormitory 
compares favorably with other students. 

In 1941-'42 the charge made to the students was increased to 
$12.00. The number of pupils accommodated has increased to 65. 

This dormitory has not been in operation long enough for those 
in charge to give many criticisms on its operation. It will not have 
operated continuously for a whole year until June 1942. At that time 
this dormitory due to its size should make a very interesting study. 

At present the project is referred to as, "A valuable idea."

CHAPTER XVII 


NEW DORMITORIES IN THE LARGE DIVISIONS 

The material available has been gathered concerning dormitories 
established in the fall of 1941. The information may not be quite 
complete but from the accounts which follow it will be apparent that 
the work done in the new dormitories has been of a high order. 

Clover Bar School Division 


The Clover Bar Division opened a dormitory at Leduc at the 
beginning of the school year. A building was purchased by the division 
for $500.00 but after alterations had been made the total investment 
amounted to $2400. A charge of $11.00 per month per student is made 
and a matron who receives $30.00 per month for 11 months supervises 
the residence. The tuition fees paid by the division to the Leduc School 
District amount to $45.00 per student per year. 

The Divisional Board had planned on accommodating only 15 
students but the demand for facilities increased as the opening of the 
school year approached and 25 students are now in attendance. Of this 
number 12 are boys and 13 girls. Most of these students are from scattered 
localities and would not be at school this year but for the establishment 
of the dormitory. The principal at Leduc has referred to these students 
as, n A good group," 

The criticisms of the divisional authorities follow. 

"We are in the trial stage and will be better able to answer 
questions at the end of the year. We strive to establish a, "Home Away 
From Home" atmosphere. The students have to assist in the housekeeping 
and serving meals under the direction of a matron. It is aimed to keep 
the cash outlay to the lowest minimum. Of course ours is still in the 
"Novelty" stage and the reports are most glowing. Easter may bring a 
different story. This year will decide if the undertaking is to be a 
permanent one."

Sangudo Dormitory 


The Lac Ste. Anne Division made a very valuable contribution 
to the educational life of the students of that area by opening an 
exceptionally fine dormitory at Sangudo in the fall of 1941. The 
building used is on the outskirts of the towi and has been modernized 
in every respect. The rent paid is $45.00 per month. The charge 
made to the students is $10.00 per month per student. Thirty-two 
students are in residence. The supervisors are paid $60.00 per month 
for 12 months with two months holiday less the time required to properly 
close the building and re-open for September. The attitude of the 
dormitory students toward their school work has been found most commend¬ 
able. 


The importance attached to the opening of the dormitory by the 
people of the division can be gathered from the following article, taken 
from the Lac Ste, Anne Chronicle. 

The dawn of a better day 

The official opening of the Lac Ste. Anne School dormitory at 
Sangudo is an event which will remain in the minds of those who have 
the pleasure of attending for many years to come. Whilst almost every 
other social effort for the past month or two had been doomed to failure 
on account of the vagaries of the weather, Friday, October 10th, broke 
clear and mild, with roads sufficiently dried to enable guests to come 
from all parts of the Division. 

This event marks a certain stage of progress in the educational 
life of Alberta. In the more prosperous parts of the province high 
school facilities have come to be regarded as a matter of course but 
back in the sticks children have had to be content with what they could 
get at public school with a fortunate few pursuing their course by 
devious methods into the higher branches of learning. It has long been 
recognized that the most practical solution for providing high school 
instruction for our rural children was to be found in centralization. 
First provide the high schools at strategic points and then provide 
living accommodation which the average parent could afford to pay.

-79- 


For the past three years the Board of the Lac Ste. Anne School 
Division has been investigating ways and means. The financial difficulties 
appeared to be insurmountable. It is largely due to the public spirit 
of Dr. A. F. Chisholm, an old-timer in the Sangudo district, that these 
obstacles have been overcome. The doctor owns a large stucco house 
a short distance out of Sangudo, overlooking the Pembina River, which 
he had vacated when moving to Evansburg a couple of years ago. The 
superintendent and his wife, Mr. and Mrs. Earle G. McDonald, were seized 
with the idea that this house would make an excellent dormitory, and 
lost no time in contacting the doctor, who immediately entered into 
the scheme whole-heartedly, and after the various formalities were 
completed, arranged to fit the place up at his own expense, and in a 
style which the Board had not dared to contemplate. Moreover, the rental 
asked was so moderate that it is felt there should be little difficulty 
in operating the establishment on a self-sustaining basis. 

Modern plumbing has been installed, and the bathroom and shower 
facilities would be the envy of many a city home. A delco plant 
provides adequate light as well as pressure for the water system. The 
house plan is admirably suited for accommodating young men and women. 

The full basement provides ample facilities for storage of supplies, 
installation of shower baths, and the housing of the light and power 
plant. The ground floor is occupied with kitchen, study, dining-room, 
and a beautiful sun parlor which serves as an overflow dining-room. 

One striking feature of the large living room is the beautiful open 
fireplace built of natural stone. This room serves as the private 
apartment of the supervisor and his wife, Mr. and Mrs. Melvin K. Pederson, 
but students are free to avail themselves of its comfort for reading, 
and the frequent evening sing-songs which are arranged. The second floor 
is composed of four large, well lighted bedrooms, one of which is occupied 
by Mr. and Mrs. Pederson and the others accommodate the girls. Each 
room is fitted with roomy clothes closets. The top floor is one large 
room capable of holding twenty beds without crowding. The whole house 
is elegantly finished, and provides solid comfort for the residents. The 
reception had been planned primarily to give an opportunity to parents to 
see for themselves under what conditions their children were living. The 
guests began to arrive shortly after two o’clock and Mrs. Pedereson was 
was proud and happy to show them through the premises. A great deal of 
interest was shown in the arrangement of chore groups, which undertake a 
considerable amount of the work involved in the preparation of meals, 
lunches and the usually irksome task of dish-washing. 

There was a general expression of satisfaction with the dormitory, 
with the personnel, and the wonderful spirit of comradeship and co-op¬ 
eration, and guests departed for home prepared to tell others that Lac 
Ste. Anne School Division was getting out of the sticks, and into the 
open spaces where clear vision and far-sightedness will make even greater 
things possible.

CHAPTER XVIII 


CONCLUSION 

The operation of dormitories has passed the experimental 
stage and is now recognized as a method of bringing high school 
education within the reach of rural youth. The value of co-op¬ 
erative enterprise as against individual effort is also clearly 
demonstrated. In the Red Deer Dormitory only 40 to 50 per cent of 
the students would have been able to attend a high school without 
the residence provided, whereas the whole group living to-gether 
was able to take advantage of the cheaper rates offered by the dorm¬ 
itory plan. If the same ratio exists throughout the province and 
judging from reports from other centres the ratio is very conservative, 
a great number of youth will be much better informed and consequently 
better able to take their place in our democracy as a result of the 
plan. Two quotations from "Newlon's Education for Democracy in Our 
Time” describe very clearly this necessity of providing educational 
facilities for all in a democratic society. 

"Equality is a basic ideal of democracy. It is also, as we 
have seen, one of the conditions of the very existence of democracy. 

The division of men into privileged and underprivileged orders on the 
basis of social, cultural, or economic advantages is the antithesis 
of democracy." 

Again—"Neither the individual state nor the nation can be 
indifferent to the quality of education or the scope of the educational 
opportunities provided in the local communities." 

The low cost of living in dormitories is due mainly to the 
fact that individual rooms are not provided. In smaller dormitories 
this works satisfactorily, but in the larger establishments the 
supervision of large groups is difficult. Some division into rooms 
might be effected without too great a cost. Four to six students

per room would allow for more privacy and should make for less 
confusion. Study might be carried on quite satisfactorily under 
such conditions if visiting was prohibited during certain hours. 
The present method which is widely used of studying in the dining 
room involves too much crowding for effective work. The photo¬ 
graph of, "Our Study Period" from the Taber establishment will 
serve to illustrate the difficulties at present encountered. 

Judging from the growth of dormitory enterprises in the 
last few years the principle will be extended until all the large 
divisions in the province will offer to their rural youth the 
privilege of attending a secondary school.
