iiBSTRACT 


The present paper reports the relative incidence 
of protozoan blood parasites in our economically important 
I wild game birds ( and some other species) in the Province 
I of Alberta, during the winter of 1947-1948, Prior to this 
paper, no parasitological investi^tions in this field 
had been made in this Province. A total of 566 blood smears, 
representing 343 birds, comprising 32 species, were 
examined in this survey. The smears v/ere obtained through 
the kind co-operation of the Provincial Game Inspectors, 
Forest Rangers, sportsmen and hunters in 23 localities 
throughout the Province. The smears were air-dried when 
received by the laboratory, and were stained v/ith Wright’s, 
Giemsa’s or Leishman’s Blood Stains. 

I Since two of the protozoan blood parasites are 

but little known, it was deemed advisable to include a 
short review of the life histories of the three protozoan 
blood parasites, Plasmodium , Haemoproteus and Leucocytozoon , 
and to include reports of literature relevant to this 
paper. A comprehensive review has been made of 
Plasmodium , and the other two have been referred to 
only in their essential differences from the Plasmodium . 














i 


The results of the investigation and the 
localities represented in the investigation are 
illustrated by Table 1 and a map. 

Special note has been made of the occurrence of 
what is believed to be the most northerly recorded 
instance of microfilaria in a Northern Sharp-Tailed 
Grouse. A table of some of the characteristics of the 
microfilaria noted in this survey is included (See Table 11). 

In this report is contained a discussion based 
on the effects of temperature and humidity on insect 
vectors in Alberta, the possible role of insects in 
relation to the health of birds, and a report of 
observations recorded at the peak year of 1934. 

The paper concludes with a brief summary of 
my statistical data and the conclusions arrived at 
by me, based on existing knowledge. 









mTRODUCTION 


The numbers of many species of animals and birds 
j are known to fluctuate widely through definite intervals 

j of time. 

j 

I The fact that game birds have gradually increased 

I in numbers plus the knowledge that they will, after a few 
j years of increase, again disappear, has raised the question 
of the possibility of protozoan blood parasites as a 
contributing factor to their sharp decline, indicating 
specifically the crash of the ten-year cycle. 

The preservation of Alberta’s upland game birds 
is of prime economic importance. The present paper was 
planned in view of the fact that very little has been done 
in the way of general bird-blood parasite surveys in 
Canada; it was also planned to see if there could be any 
possible connection between the incidence of blood para¬ 
sites and the rise and fall of bird populations in the 
Province during this dramatic ten-year cycle. This can 
only be made possible by actual statistical records of the 
blood parasites securing in our resident birds. This I 
have attempted to show in the statistical data presented

The study of bird-blood protozoology began in 1885 
with the discovery by Danilewsky of Plasmodium in birds. 
Since then, researchers have found Plasmodium in almost 
all vertebrates, Haemoproteus in reptiles and birds, and 
Leucocytozoon in birds alone. However, the literature 
available on the morphology and physiology of the parasites 
in birds is, at the present moment, scattered, obscure, 
uncorrelated and often contradictory. 

In an effort to examine all the original literature 
on the subject, I have consulted other libraries as well as 
our own. All those relevant to this paper are included and 
indicated thus .... Smith and Smith (1931). (Additional 
papers that have been examined are included only in the 
bibliography). 

This paper consists of two major discussions: 
first, that of the life cycles of parasites observed in 
this survey (including a review of important relevant 
literature) and second, the statistical data obtained 
during the survey.

Life Cycle in the Bird : 

1 The similarity of the avian and human malaria cycle 

i 

I is most strikingly comparable in many respects. The cycle 
in the bird is as follows: Sporozoites present in the 
salivary glands of certain species of mosquitoes ( Culex , 
Aedes , Theobaldia , and Anopheles ) are injected into the blood 
of the bird while the insects are biting. The sporozoites 
now undergo a pre-erythrocytic phase (the pre-patent period). 
Huff and Coulston (1944) using massive doses of sporozoites 
of P. gallinaceum investigated this pre-erythrocytic phase. 
They found that the sporozoites invade the macrophages at 
the site of inoculation and later the capillary walls in 
the spleen. After 36 hours, when this first of cryptozoic 
generation is mature, the parasite is a large multinucleate

organism occupying almost the whole cell. The cell ruptures, 
liberating a large number of merozoites which have the ability 
of infecting other endothelial cells but not the erythrocytes. 
The generations following the cryptozoites are known as the 
metacr 3 /^tozoic generations, the first of which is now found 

! 

in cells of the lymphoid-macrophage system and endothelial 

cells. The metacryptozoites resemble the cryptozoites in their 

morphology and in their maturation in 36 hours. After 60 hours, 

metacryptozoites are observed in the inoculation site, spleen, 

heart, kidney and brain. On reaching maturity, the metacrypt- 

ozoite liberates its merozoites, which may now invade the 

1 erythrocytes initiating the well known trophozoite cycle, or 

i they may parasitize other cells in the spleen, heart, kidney, 

brain, lung, liver, bone-marrow or muscle, perpetuating the 

esoerythrocytic stages of the infection. The first parasite 

in the red blood cells is known as a trophozoite (ring stage), 

I which enlarges within the red cell, displaces the host cell 

1 

nucleus in many cases, and becomes either a segmenter or a 
gametocyte; the former representing the asexual division 
stage, the latter the sexual stage which undergoes further 
development in the insect host. The products of the division 
of each segmenter, known as merozoites, escape and penetrate

new erythrocytes. The haemoglobin within the rea cell is 
apparently digested and pigment granule by-products are 
deposited within the parasite.

Cycle in the Mosquito ; 

The gametocytes are of two types: macrogametocytes 
(female) and'microgametocytes (male). When a mosquito 
ingests blood containing gametocytes further development 
takes place. Each mierogametocyte undergoes exflagellation 
producing 6 to 8 flagellated bodies (male gametes) in the 
stomach of the mosquito while the female gametoeyte undergoes 
a maturation process to become a female gamete. Fertilization 
takes place and the resulting zygote becomes an elongate, 
motile ookinete that penetrates the stomach vjall of the 
mosquito and comes to rest just beneath the outer epithelium, 
where it grows at the expense of the surrounding tissues. 
Within the resulting spherical oocyst large numbers of 
minute elongate cells develop, called sporozoites, which 
eventually escape into the body cavity and find their way 
to the salivary glands. When the mosquito next bites, 
some of the sporozoites are inevitably injected into the 
vertebrate host where the asexual cycle begins anew.

Wenyon (1926) reports that Sargent (1919) carried 
out experiments pertaining to the development of P« praecox 

I 

! C» pipiens ; he found that the optimum temperature lay 
o o 

I between 20 C and 30 C* Mosquitoes after being exposed to 

j 12°C for the first 6 hours following the ♦♦infecting feed»* 

! 

! rarely became infective on being transferred to favorable 
temperatures. If after feeding, mosquitoes were kept at 
a temperature varying between 17.5°C and 24^0, development 
took place very slowly, sporozoites not appearing in the 
salivary glands till after the expiry of 2 months. 

(Wenyon, 1926, obtained complete development, including 
infection of the salivary glands, in less than 5 days 
although 7 to 10 days is the generally accepted time 
today). 

Symptomatology and Pathology ; 

The impression one gets from the availabe litei^ 
ature is that the question as to whether Plasmodium 
infections cause as high a degree of mortality in wild 
game birds as in laboratory birds is nothing more than 
a supposition. Herman (1938) states tha t Plasmodium 
infections probably do not cause a high mortality in 
game birds, the disease tending greatly to lower the 














resistance of the infected individual and thus making it 
vulnerable to other diseases or natural enemies. This 
assumption was based on observations on a Red-wing which 
had sustained an acute infection in nature. The bird did 
not seem to be suffering any noticeable ill effects; the 
only indication of the disease was the great number of 
parasites to be seen in its blood smear. On the other 
hand, canaries inoculated with the infected blood sustained 
high mortality (more than 50^). 

Hewitt (1940) reports observations made by 
Danilewsky (1885-1890) as follows: Out of 300 captured 
birds kept under observation for weeks or months only 
4 or 5 died from what he considered to be the effects of 
the parasite. In describing symptoms, Danilewsky noted 
that the temperature of infected birds rose moderately 
(from 1 to 1.5°C or more). The birds lost their appetite, 
they became apathetic, their plumage became ruffled, they 
suffered convulsions and they lost weight. These symptoms 
were found to occur at the time of sporulation of the 
parasites. In general the sickness gradually subsided 
within 4 to 6 days, after which recovery followed, the 
parasites disappearing eventually from the blood and the

condition of the bird becoming once more normal. The spleen 
and liver v^ere also noted to enlarge and contain enormous 
amounts of pigment. Huff (1939), however, demonstrated that 
there was no rise in temperature even when greatest seg¬ 
mentation of the asexual forms took place. Subsequent 
investigations have largely confirmed these observations. 

Huff and Bloom (1935), Porter (194S), Simpson (1944), 
Coulston, Cantrell and Huff (1945), Taliaferro and Bloom (1945) 
and others, noted in addition that exoerythrocytic stages 
occurred in lung, bone-marrow, brain, heart, kidney, ovary, 
lymph nodes, thymus and inoculation site. Relapses are 
known to occur in experimentally infected canaries, but 
whether they occur in the same frequency in wild birds is 
not known. 

Species and Host Index ; 

Hewitt (1940) compiled a list of birds (taken 
chiefly from the extensive check-lists given by Wenyon (1926), 
Coatney and Roudabush (1936) and Giovannola (1939) in which 
258 species of birds are listed) in which plasmodia have 
been described. Since then supplementary lists have been 
published (the latest of which was by Herman in 1944). 













In 1942, the Committee on Terminology of Strains of Avian 
Malaria recognized 14 species of plasmodia including 38 
strains. 

Hussell and Mohan (1942) published a list of 
mosquito hosts to the avian plasmodia with special 
reference.to P. gallinaceum . They noted that in Florida 
(at 25 to 31 degrees latitude) that 32 species of 
mosquitoes were capable of transmitting P. gallinaceum 
into various bird hosts. Since then several new mosquito 
hosts have been recorded. The evidence from the literature 
suggests that at higher latitudes the range of mosquito 
vectors becomes correspondingly restricted. Herman (1938) 
and Russell and Mohan (1942) noted that mosquitoes are 
specific as transmitters not only for particular ^ecies 
of bird malaria, but also possibly for certain strains of 
the same species or perhaps that there is an immunological 
difference in mosquitoes collected from different localities. 

Results of Current Experimental Work ; 

The fact that Plasmodium passes its asexual stages 
in the circulating blood cells, and as such is easily trans¬ 
mitted from one susceptible host to another, has made the

investigation on the malarial parasite one at the most 
fruitful fields in the study of protozoan diseases* It 
is one characteristic of bird malaria not to be strongly 
host-specific; consequently, most (not all) of the 
malarial parasites found in wild birds can be grown in the 
common laboratory birds — the canary, chick and duck* 

For example, P* lophurae isolated from the Fire-back 
pheasant is inoculable into the canary, duck and chicken. 

On the other hand, Simpson (1944) has noted that P, durae , 
isolated from the ccmimon turkey, is not inoculable into the 
duck, and is, according to present knowledge, a strongly 
host-specific species. Huff and Bloom (1935) found that 
P, elongatum , in contrast to other malarial parasites, is 
capable of living in all circulating blood cells and 
hemopoietic cells of the canary, and is unique in that it 
includes granular leucocytes. Pigment formation, however, was 
confined only to those parasite forms found in cells 
containing haemoglobin, Coulston, Cantrell and Huff (1945), 
in an extremely interesting experim^t, showed that 
infection of the bird takes place in less than one 


minute after the pierce of the infected mosquito. They

j showed that birds with extensive infarcts during acute

I malaria, succumbed in greater numbers than those without 
infarcts. They also showed that the spleen is able to 
recover and regenerate and again become effective in 
combating malaria with its phagocytes. Taliaferro, 

Taliaferro and Simmons (1945), showed that irradiation 
of the bird host by X-rays of sufficiently high magnitude 
caused increased parasitemia and a decrease in the survival 
time of the host. Studies on relapse conditions were made 
by Hegner (1937) and Gajewski and Tatum (1944); relapses 
were produced by the use of insulin, epinephrine, low 
oxygen content of the air, ultra-violet radiation, glucose, 
blocking of the macrophages, and by natural conditions such 
as acute infections of other sorts, extreme cold, exhaustion 
and change from low to high altitudes. Hegner and Hewitt (1937) 
noted that more young red blood cells are susceptible to the 
parasite than are old red blood cells, even though the 
proportion is 6 to 94. They also noted that cells which

were parasitized with more than 1 parasite died in 21 hours. 
They suggested that this would account for most of the 
decrease in the number of parasites that is known to take 
place during an asexual generation. Taliaferro and 
Taliaferro (1940) demonstrated that infections with small , 

I numbers of parasites had a slow development, low intensity 
I and usually no crisis, in contrast to infestations with 
large numbers of parasites in them. They also showed that 
birds show a high degree of immunity to superinfection by 
the same species of parasite. They also noted that young 
chicks suffered heavier mortalities than did adult birds, 
j Gingrich (1941-42) illustrated that phagocytosis is not 
merely an adjunct to acquired immunity but an active 
process and a major factor in the parasiticidal mechanism 
of immunity. He further noted that natural immunity is 
manifested especially during the acute rise of infection 
with P. cathemerium when approximately 2/3 of the parasites 
fail to survive (note Hegner and Hewitt above). He states 
that the mechanism of acquired immunity is primarily 
cellular and consists of an increase in the number of 
macrophages (and the phagocytosis by them of parasitized 
red blood cells) chiefly in the spleen, liver and to a

I FAMILY HAEM)PROTBIDAB 

I Genus Haemoproteus 

Cycle in the Bird 

Haemoproteus , of which there are many species in 
birds, is interesting because its gametocytes closely 
resemble those of some species of malaria, even in having 
the same type of pigment. Although the sexual forms are found 
in red blood cells, the asexual ones are not. The latter, 
however, are morphologically similar to the exoerythroeytic 
forms of the plasmodia and occur in similar locations in the 
host. As in the case of Plasmodium , if more than one itierozoite 

















enters a red blood cell, the excess is either expelled or 
the red cell dies. The gametocyte when fully formed is 
"halter shaped” and is frequently called a Halteridium. 

As increase in size takes place, the organism grows around . 
one side of the host cell nucleus; host cell and nucleus 
retain approximately their normal shape. On the other hand, 
the gametocyte may enclose the host cell nucleus entirely 
or push it to the side, but it does not distort it, and the 
parasite still encloses the nucleus like a halter, as does 
F. circumflexum , P. lophurae (and others). It is difficult 
to distinguish these species o f Plasmodium from Haemoproteus 
if segmenting forms are not present. Haemoproteus is so 
much like Plasmodium that there is but one way of telling 
the difference... this is by subinoculation into a parasite- 
free host. Because gametocytes are incapable of developing 
in the vertebrate body, sub inoculation of the suspected 
parasite, if Haemoproteus , will give no infection; but if it 
is Plasmodium , an infection will result. 

Cycle in the Fly 

Subsequent development of the gametocytes takes place 
in the invertebrate host; in all cases where these are known, 
the hosts are the Hippoboscid blood-sucking flies. It is

not necessary to give a complete outline of the development 


here, since it is similar to the Plasmodium cycle in the 
mosq.uito. Such important factors as effect of temperature 
and humidity on the development of the parasite in the fly 
have yet to be determined. The above cycle takes place 
within 10 to 12 days (Hegner, 1938). 

Check List and Host Index . 

Coatney (1936) published a check-list and host index 
of the genus Haemoproteus in which are listed 45 specific 
names, most of which are descrioed in birds. He also lists 
648 species of birds known to be affected by this parasite. 
Herman (1944) published a supplementary list, in which 
several new ^ecific names are added in new bird hosts. 

The genus occurs widely in the species of birds, including 
the owls, flickers, woodpeckers, ducks and passerine birds. 

As Herman (1944) has noted, "the inability to 
transmit these parasites by simple blood transfusions makes 
it difficult to investigate their host-specificity and thus 
I clarify the validity of named species”. 

Symptomatomatology and Pathology 

Identical to that of Plasmodium . In passing it is 


worth noting that Plasmodium and Haemoproteus are never

transmitted by the same invertebrate host, yet both produce 
the same pathological conditions. 

Results of Current Experiments 

Very little in the way of e 2 perimental work or 
observations has been done with this parasite since no method 
has yet been devised to study latent cases. 

Kerman (1938) records a case where a black duck, 
kept in captivity from September, 1936 until its death in 
May, 1937, was observed to have parasites ( Haemoproteus ) 
in its blood during the entire period. Similar 
persistence of the parasite was found by Huff (1942) to 
be present in mallard ducks. Clarke (1938) found very 
few of the grouse in Ontario to be infected with Haemoproteus , 
the scarcity being possibly due to the fact that Hippoboscid 
flies have not been found commonly on Ontario grouse. 

Huff (1942) suggests that in areas where birds are 
known not to be attacked by Hippoboscid flies, the Simuliid 
fly may serve as the vector of Haemoproteus as well as of 
Leucocytoaoon . He also noted that there is a striking 
parallel between the schizonts of Haemoproteus and Leucocytozoon , 
i.e., the same characteristic clefts and forms of merozoites.

Herman (1938) noted that a number of Chipping 
Sparrows which were examined several times curing the summer 
exhibited a high level of infection in each subsequent 
examination. Thus the maintenance of a high gametocytic 

j 

i level in the blood of infected birds throughout the summer 
and the presence of a low grade infection throughout the 

! 

winter (as compared with the rapid couse of the infection 
with most species of Plasmodium ) may account for the hi^er 
incidence of Haemoproteus reported in most of the literature. 

Only 2 species, H. maccallumi and H. aacharovi , 
found in doves, have been successfully transmitted by 
Huff (1932) to domestic pigeons, the definitive host in both 
cases being the Hippoboscid blood-sucking flies. 

I On the whole, very little has been done in the study 

1 of the parasite, and much is still in doubt.

Plasmodium and Haemoproteus , and it occurs only in birds. 

It is similar to Haemoproteus in its asexual life cycle; 
however, the young gametocytes enter immature red blood cells. 
There is considerable doubt concerning the true nature of 
the host cell, and it may in all probability be a leucocyte 
I or a lymphocyte. The host cells containing adult parasites 
I are so distorted by the infection that their identification 
no longer becomes possible. During growth of the gametocyte, 
the cell is profoundly altered, and in most cases the cell 
becomes an elongate spindle. Leucocytoaoons do not form 
much pigment. Wenyon (1926) working with L« neavei noted 
\ that, whereas in fresh blood preparations all the parasites 
were in spindle-shaped cells, in dried films, especially if 
made some time after the death of the bird, there was a much 
greater diversity of shape, many of the parasites being 
spherical, while the cells appeared to have lost their tail¬ 
like prolongations. 

Cycle in the Fly 

The vectors of Leucocytozoon are apparently flies 
of the genus Simulium, principally the Black Fly. The 
gametocjrtes undergo fertilization and development in the

same manner as the Plasmodium in the mosquito. Observations 
by O’Roke (1934) indicate that the development of L. anatis 

I (=^L. simondi) in the female of the blood sucking black fly, 

I Simulium venustum, can be completed in 5 days or less (although 

! 

I this is not necessarily the case for all species). The 

I 

minimum temperature, the humidity, and the time required for 
the different stages in the sexual cycle of the parasite in 
the fly has not as yet been determined. 

Symptomatology and Pathology 

Birds harboring Leucocytozoa as a rule appear to be 
little affected by the parasite with the exception of certain 
species of birds, in which the Leucocytozoon disease is 
particularly pathogenic, and is the cause of heavy mortality. 
O’Roke (1934) noted mortality of 35 per cent in an outbreak 
among young ducks in Michigan. Mallards and Black Ducks of 
all ages were susceptible, and death usually occurred on the 
twelfth day after infection. L. bonasae Clarke from the 
ruffed grouse has been shown by Clarke (1935) to be associated 
with cyclical mortality in the grouse population and vms con¬ 
sidered by him as a possible cause of the cycle. Oliger (1940) 
noted that young Hazel grouse ?/ere attacked most violently

and produced most losses. Domestic turkeys are very susceptible 
to Leucocytozoon parasites and heavy mortalities in various 
parts of the world have been recorded. Macroscopic lesions 
are as follows: acute swelling of the spleen, the normal color 
changing to a light grey; enlargement of the liver, the surface 
covered with large light areas of degeneration; the kidneys 
enlarged and congested; bilateral edema of the lungs; 
hemorrhagic enteritis throughout the length of the intestine, 
and petechial hemorrhages in the heart and the brain substance. 
In turkeys there appear to be three types of infection: 

(1) the per-acute fom in which apparently healthy birds die 
suddenly following a few convulsive seizures; (2) the less 
acute form with weakness, progressive emaciation, and moderate 
turbidity of the humors of the eye; (3) the chronic form, 
characterized by arthritis, periarthritis, distortion of the 
hock joint, lameness and marked turbidity of the humors of the 
eyes. 

Leucocytozoon infections are noted to be cyclic in 
nature by Clarke (1938), Hui'f (1942) and other investigators. 
Birds surviving an epizootic Leucocytozoon disease show a 
decrease in number of schizonts and gametocytes throughout the 
fall and winter months until April of the following year, at

which time there is a reappearance of the schizonts in the 
tissues followed by an appearance of gametocytes in the 
blood stream again. 

Species and Host-Index 

Leucocytozoon study is a relatively new zoological 
field, and a great deal has yet to be done towards clearing 
up their classification. Leger and Leger (1914) suggested 
that Leucocytozoon has a definite host-specificity, and that 
Morphological characteristics tend to be dependent on the 
order (or group) of hosts infected. Most investigators have 
assumed that these parasites are extremely host-specific and 
many have thus been named on their first discovery in a 
previously unreported host. The inability to transmit these 
parasites by simple blood transfusion makes it difficult to 
investigate the host-specificity, and so to clarify the validity 
of a named species. Coatney (1937) has catalogued and host- 
indexed all species known up to that year. Sixty-eight 
specific names appear in his list, but there may be synonyms 
among these. Of the 68, only 58 were found in birds... the 
other 10 described in animals, and since Leucocytozoon occurs 


only in birds, Coatney claims that they were probably

Hepatoaoons , Haemogregarines and Leishinanias . The host- 
indez list has now been greatly increased, and Herman (1944) 
has published a paper to supplement the check-lists, thus 
bringing up to date the host distribution of blood protozoa 
in the Western Hemisphere. 


Results of Current Experiments 

Very little experimental work (e.g. relapses etc.) 
has been carried out on this genus ( Leucocytozoon ), as most 
investigators have hitherto concentrated on the direct life 
cycle of the parasite. Studies are no?/ being conducted by 
Starr and West (1940) to discover further possible inverteb¬ 
rate host vectors in L. smithi disease of turkeys. This 
work was begun during an outbreak in a turkey flock ?^en 
no Simulium flies could be observed; nor were there any 
local streams suitable for the breeding of these insects, 
whose normal range of dispersal is limited, existed in the 
district. It was noted, however, that lice of the genus 
Mallophaga infested the turkeys, and that, when remedial 
measures were instituted, no further losses were encountered, 
and blood smears failed to reveal any further infection. 
However, the supposition that lice are vectors still remains 
unproved.

The present study has consisted of an examination 
of the blood smears for protozoan blood parasites. Although 
it is desirable to make the microscopic examination as soon 
as possible after death of the host, this ims found to be 
impractical because of the large number of localities 
investigated. The material for this study was received from 
the game inspectors, forest rangers and sportsmen hunters of 
the Province. To avoid sacrifice of the edible birds, the 
collectors were requested to make smears of the peripheral 
blood and of the heart on clean glass slides provided, as 
soon after the death of the bird as possible. Dabs of liver, 
spleen and brain were later also requested. Thus, barring 
unforeseen circumstances, the smears were all made in the 


field. 

On account of the fact that in the collection of the 
material for this study I was dependent, to a great extent, on 
the generosity and opportunity of others, this method of 
collection introduced some difficulties. The collection 7ms, 
therefore, very irregular. 


Blood smears of captive birds in the Zoological Parks 











were made by piercing the brachial vein on the under side of 


the wing with a surgical needle. 

The smears were air dried and stained in the 
laboratory with either Wright’s, Giemsa’s or Leishman’s 
Blood Stains, from one to several days after preparation. 
Diagnosis for the presence or absence of parasites was 
based on a 15 to 20 minute examination of a single blood 
smear: 1-5 minutes with low power (lOX oculars) and 
15 minutes with oil immersion lens (lOX oculars). Tabulation 
of results was made on the basis of individual birds.

Included in the above numbers are 84 adult birds 
from the Edmonton Zoological Park and 37 adult birds from 
the Calgary Zoological Park. 

Mr. Heustis, Fish and Game Commissioner of the 
Province of Alberta, directed his deputies to collect samples 
of blood especially for this investigation, and since this 
was a closed season, the regular shooting season having 
ended, a good number of the specimens were obtained in this 
T^jay. 

All samples were of apparently healthy adult birds. 


OBSERVATIONS 


A total of 566 smears, representing 343 birds, 
comprising 32 species was examined. Of these, 36 birds 
(or 10.5 per cent) were found to be parasitized by one 
or more parasites, a total of 42 infections in all. 








The parasites observed included examples of Plasmodium , 


I

i 


i 


f 


Haemoproteus , Leucocytozoon and microfilaria. The data 
in Table I summarizes the distribution of these parasites 
based on a study of their morphology in the blood films. 

Success in finding parasites readily in smears is 
in some measure dependent upon the quality of the blood 
smears received. Unfortunately, on account of the large area 
represented in this report and the necessity of mailing the 
smears to the laboratory, many of the smears were contaminated 
by artifacts, bacteria or moulds, thus masking the presence 
(if any) of the parasites. In addition, many of the smears 
were made in freezing weather, and this seemed to have a 
destructive effect on the blood cells, particularly the 
monocytes. 

As observed in an earlier part of this paper, the 
parasites disappear from the blood stream in a relatively 
short time and are (in the winter months especially) 
extremely difficult to find or to identify. This fact is 
amply illustrated in this investigation where, for the most 
part, the infections were very light. No attempt was made 
to assign the parasites to species, as too few parasites 
were found to permit average measurements and comparison 
with described species.

PLiiSMODTOI 

Parasites of the genus Plasmodium were found in 
11 birds of 8 species, or 26.2 per cent of the infected 
birds. All were of an undetermined type, showing only a 
few trophozoites which might haTe belonged to any one of 
several species. 

Chronic cases of avian malaria are often impossible 
to detect by peripheral blood smears, or smears from internal 
organs (Huff, 1943) especially in those species in which the 
parasite level is extremely low after the crisis is past. 

To determine more accurately the extent of avian malaria 
in nature, blood inoculations should be made into canaries 
from birds suspected or harboring the malarial organism, or 
better into clean birds of the same species. As this 
procedure was impossible in this survey, these figuj^es for 
Plasmodium infections represent only an estimate of the 
probable infection in the number of birds examined. 

Of the 11 Plasmodium infections found in this 
study, 3 were found in Pigeons, 2 in American Wigeons, and 
one each in Ruffed Grouse, Sharp-tailed Grouse, Hungarian 
Partridge, Pheasant, Mallard and Magpie. It is of interest 














37 


that these samples were obtained in late September and early 
October, just after the disappearance of the mosquito vectors* 


H4EM0PRGTEUS 

Parasites of the genu s Eaemoproteus were found in 
11 birds of 6 species or 26.2 per cent of the infected birds. 

Of the 11 Haemoproteus infections found in this 
study, 3 were from Mallards, 2 from American Wigeons, 3 from 
English Sparrows and one each from Ruffed Grouse, Hungarian 
Partridge and Canada Goose. As with Plasmodium , the infections 
were very light and no attempt ms made to allocate these to 
the species. 


LBUCQQYTQ30QH 

Parasites of the genus Leueocytozoon were found 
in 14 birds of 10 species, or 33.3 per cent of the infected 
birds. 

The basis for classification of the Leueocytozoon 
is the change in the morphology wrought by the parasite in 
the host cell, rather than the morphology of the parasite 
itself. Generally, birds of the large orders are parasitized 
by the type of Leueocytozoon which produces fusiform or

In only one case was positive identification of

ICLCROFILARIA 

These parasites were found in 7 birds of 6 species 
or 14.3 per cent of the infected birds. 

Little is knom of the pathogenicity of the avian 
types. They have been observed in large numbers at autopsy 
but what their relation to the cause of death may be is not 
known. Because some are periodic in appearance, in the 
blood stream, the presence of a large number in a bird 
may be regarded as a periodic *’shower” (Boulton, Byrd and 
Lund, 1938).

occurrence of microfilaria in the Northern Sharp-tailed 
Grouse obtained at Fort Chipewyan is the most northerly- 
case on record.

As is evident from a glance at Table I, on 
comparing numbers infected and total types of parasites 
indicated, one finds that a few birds harboured more than 
one parasite. Where only one infection in a bird was found, 
the table indicates the type of parasite. The organisms 
occurring in mixed infections were Haemoproteus (H), 
Leucocytozoon (1) and microfilaria (M). By using the letters 
indicated above, the complete figures for the birds with 2 or 
more genera of parasites is indicated in this manner: IM in 
1 Nor-thern Sharp-tailed Grouse; ELM in 1 Mallard; HL in 
1 Mallard. 


SAi'^LES OF m^IALIAN BLOOD 
Incidental to the study of protozoan blood parasites 
in birds, smears were received and examined of 9 Snowshoe 
Rabbits, 4 Squirrels, 3 Weasels and 1 Moose. In one

smear from a Bush rabbit microfilaria was found. Four 
sheathed forms were measured. The average measurements 
were 180 microns by 7.2 microns. The microfilaria were 
characterized by blunt ends. 


DISCUSSION 


In closing this paper and drawing conclusions from 
the available printed material and the survey just completed, 
I believe the following represents a reasonable discussion 
I of the controversial points. 

Although Plasmodium malaria is usually classified 
as a tropical disease, it is also widely prevalent in 
temperate regions, such as the Southern United States. 

Many have expressed doubt as to the probability of malaria 
in Alberta because of the teinperature and hpiidity involved 
in the parasite^s sexual cycle in the invertebrate hosts. 

As was noted earlier in this paper, the parasites will 
develop in the invertebrate hosts at temperatures between 
20^0 and 30°C {68°F and 86®F). A drop in temperature 
below 20°C for several hours after ingestion of the 
parasites by the invertebrate host is sufficient to slow

down the rate of development to a very large degree. Concerning 
relative humidity, it may be said that, if the average or 
mean monthly humidity is less than 60 per cent (provided 
the teiiperature is suitable) it is not likely that malaria 
transmission will take place. A glance at Table III would 
seem to indicate that this belief is justifiable. However, 
the fact that Plasmodium was observed in this, a winter survey, 
in some of the slides examined by myself, and also that 
Plasmodium has been observed in Sparrows by Dr. Cockburn (1948) 
at Lamont, Alberta, proves that Plasmodium can and does exist 
in Alberta. As it can only be transmitted in the summer 
time, these winter cases are evidently latent. Concerning 
the presence of Plasmodium in Canadian birds, Pallis (1946) 

I found a strain of P. clrcumflexum in ruffed grouse in Ontario, 

i 

which he describes as apparently non-pathogenie and concludes 
that for this reason this Plasmodium is probably not a factor 
in causing periodic dying-off of the ruffed grouse in Ontario. 

All reports cited as to the pathogenicity of 
Haemoproteus and Leucoeytozoon , though apparently substantiated 
by sufficient evidence, are nevertheless open to doubt. None 
of the reporters appear to take into account the nature of 
the invertebrate vector — not as a carrier of the parasite, 
but for its own sake. Simuliid flies (Black Flies) are known

to have an extremely vicious bite, hanging on by means of 
the short mouth parts for an indefinite period. Reports 
from Saskatchewan show that economic losses in domestic 
animals have run into thousands of dollars as a result of this 
pest. Even if a blood parasite is suspected, the vertebrate 
host dies long before the cycle of a parasite could be 
suspected of completion. No reports were found regarding 
the direct affect of the flies on domestic poultry, but 
one may provisionally infer that a sufficient infestation 
of the fly alone might similarly induce a mortality in 
birds. 

The suggestion set forth by Starr and ?Jest (1940) 
that species of the genus Mallophaga might be implicated in 
the transmission of Leucocytoaoon disease in turkeys is to 
date without factual basis. Turkeys attacked by these lice, 
and showing no signs of the blood parasite, develop a 
nervous diarrhea and finally die. The presence of a high 
Leucocytozoon level in the blood could have been as a result 
of an immediate infection or the result of a relapse of a 
latent infection. Regarding the statement that no suitable 
breeding place for the Simuliid fly could be found within 
their normal flying range, it should be noted that it has

been recorded by Herms (1939) that wind is able to carry the 
fly from its original breeding place for a distance of 
90 miles. 

Rowan (1934) records the fact that the peak year of 
1934 in Hungarian Partridges would often find a female starting 
off with a brood of 20 chicks, but early summer saw a gradual 
dying off of the young birds until perhaps only 2 chicks vjere 
left to each female. Old birds were not affected. The next 
year the birds were scarce—the cycle was complete. Autopsy 
of birds revealed no observable parasites, but at the time 
no blood smear examinations were made. The possibility exists 
that a contributing factor in the sharp decline of the number 
of the young could have been the presence of protozoan blood 
parasites, but it does not rule out the possibility of other 
diseases such as pullorum. There can be no doubt that there 
are some species and strains of blood parasites that are 
extremely pathogenic in their normal bird hosts. On the other 
hand, there are many more species and strains that are non- 
pa thogenic to any bird host. The mere presence of the 
parasites cannot, therefore, be considered a cause for bird 
mortality until their actual pathogenicity in any specific 
bird can be demonstrated.

smamy 

In the present survey, 343 birds of 32 species were 
examined. Thirty-six individuals (or 10.5 per cent) representing 
20 species (or 6.2 per cent) were found to be infected. 

Plasmodium was observed in 11 birds of 8 species. 

Haemoproteus was found in 11 birds of 6 species. 

Leucocyto^oon was found in 14 birds of 10 species. 

Microfilaria were found in 7 birds of 6 species, 
including a possible new host record -- the Northern Sharp¬ 
tailed Grouse. 

Mixed infections were found in 3 birds of 2 species. 


CONCLUSION 

1 believe I am justified in being cautious in 
applying to Canadian and particularly Albertan birds and 
invertebrate host populations the deductions arrived at by 
other workers in other regions. The Department of 
Entomology of the University of Alberta has confinned the 
fact that species of invertebrate hosts known to be 
susceptible in other parts of the world are present in this 














48 


Province, but regarding their ability to transmit the more 
virulent species or strains of parasites at our latitudes 
cannot be taken for granted on the strength of investigations 

carried on elsewhere. 

i 

I On the basis of the results tabulated in this report, 

I 

j nothing definite can be stated as to whether blood parasites 

I 

! could exert a deleterious effect on local bird populations. 

I 

I The fact, however, that these parasites have been demonstrated 
elsewhere to infect young birds, causing fatal infections, 

I indicates that their presence may well be a menace in Alberta. 
The Province harbours tfe vectors, the hosts and the parasites. 
Whether the parasites belong to virulent species (or possibly 
strains) cannot be answered until intensive research is 
conducted in this field, particularly during the summer 
months. 

This winter survey, however, has demonstrated the 
presence of latent infections in avian hosts and justifying 
the assumption that there is a potential resident reservoir, 
independent of migratory species, which might lead to 
widespread summer infections.
