CHAPTER I 


PURPOSE OP THE INVESTIGATION 

How many of our high school students know how to 
study? What do we as teachers know about the study habits 
of our students? What could be done about improving the 
study habits? These and other questions have suggested 
a project on the very important but often neglected phase 
of student training. 

Study is a technique. It must be learned or must 
be acquired through proper study habits. Study is not a 
simple but a complicated process. It does not come natu¬ 
rally. Teaching experience has revealed that many students 
do not go about a lesson systematically but aimlessly start 
reading or studying the first page they lay their eyes on. 
It is felt that the weak student is often weak because he 
does not know how to study and that the gap between high 
and low accomplishments could be narrowed by undertaking 
the needed training for effective study. 

We.shall not try to determine what are good study 
habits. This has been done and there is much literature 
on the subject. The purpose of this investigation is to 
find: 

(a) Have our students good study habits? 

(b) What are their study problems and difficulties? 

(c) What could we as teachers do about it.

A ten page questionnaire has been prepared on the 
various phases of "studying"• It was divided into the 
following sections: 

(1) General information as to age, sex, grade, 
school progress, future plan. 

(the name was not asked for to 
encourage frank and sincere answers) 

(2) On conditions of study. 

(3) On assignments. 

(4) On reading. 

(5) On note-taking. 

(6) On learning and memorizing. 

(7) General questions on marked changes in study 
habits and greatest difficulties. 

The questionnaire was so prepared as to bring to 
light as many of the important factors in study habits 
as possible, such as: 

(a) Have students a definite time and place for 
study. 

(b) Have they the habit of regular preparation. 

(c) The length of study periods -- the best duration 
of study and rest. 

(d) Do students clearly understand the objectives. 

(e) Do they know how to look for material; how to 
use a text-book. 

(f) How many underline, make summaries and outlines 
to fix points in mind. 

(g) How many know how to prepare and to make notes.

(h) How many know how to skim first and read for 
more detailed information after* 

(1) Do students stop occasionally when reading or 
studying to think over the subject and make sure they 
have grasped it. 

(j) Do they know how to memorize and then what to do 
to retain longer what has been learned. 

(k) Do they realize the importance of frequent review 

(l) Do they study at successive intervals rather than 
through excessively prolonged and exhausting periods. 

(m) How many make logical associations to assist 
in learning and how many merely resort to mechanical 
memorization. 

The questionnaire has been distributed among 150 
high school pupils from six schools — two city schools, 
two town schools, and two rural schools. The teachers 
were asked to give the questionnaires to those students 
only who could be depended upon to give sincere and frank 
information. Most of the questionnaires have been re¬ 
turned. The results have been tabulated. I shall attempt 
to show the significance of these results, to suggest 
remedies or solutions of the problems, 

Furthermore, it may be possible to interpret or 
to show: 

(1) Any difference in the study habits of city, town 


and rural pupils

The reasons given by the students give us a clue 
to the larger percentage of rural pupils prefering to 
study at home. In smaller schools the teacher carrying 
on with other classes is a chief source of distraction. 
Many prefer to study at school due to: teacher’s help, 
library facilities, a study atmosphere. 

Obvious conclusions : 

1. A tense atmosphere and a strict teacher is not con¬ 
ducive to study. 

2. Those that haven’t a good place to study at home 'would 
rather study at school.

52% of rural students haven’t a separate room for 
studying as against 38% of the urban students. On the 
average only 40% of our pupils have their own desks at 
home for studying. This is to be regretted. 

A very definite conclusion is that the students 
who haven’t their own room, desk or privacy would rather 
study at school. Also, students who have a definite place 
to study feel that they cannot study as well any other 
place. 

Suggestion : Make the students realize the importance of 
having a definite place to study,

The figures seem to indicate that students reaching 
high school in rural areas or smaller towns are more 
conscientious than those of urban areas. A greater 
percentage of city pupils have no definite time for home 
studying. 

That 78$ of the rural pupils do their home studying 
later in the evening is understandable in view of more 
help required in rural homes. 

Having a time schedule for studying is a factor 
in forming good study habits.

The rural teacher, at least in the past, supervised 
more than he taught. Rural pupils are more used to 
study with the teacher’s supervision and apparently feel 
that better progress could be made with the teacher. 

In the cities the pupils don’t have as much supervised 
study as they have teaching and instruction time.

Too many pupils desire to study alone. This points 
to one fact. The job of supervised study is not well 
done. Just getting after pupils to make them study 
is not supervision. Many pupils go as far as to say 
that the presence of a teacher is confusing and dis¬ 
turbing. This should not be so. The attitude of the 
pupils towards the teacher is important. If they regard 
him as an f overseer T , he will not help them towards real 
study. Pupils develop most in study under the leadership 
of the supervisor they accept. A good supervisor should 
make the environment favorable; minimize distraction; 
create a spirit and tone that is conducive to studying; 
get a working atmosphere; give guidance and help# 

Good students, prefer studying alone. 

Another factor which we wish to analyze is the one 
about rest periods while studying. The question is, 

"how many students stop for rest periods"? These short 
rest periods more than repay for themselves# They must 
not be too long. They can be beneficial or detrimental, 
depending upon how they are used. We are attempting to 
determine whether the students take the kind of rests 
which are necessary to good study habits by analyzing 
the replies to the question, —■—"What do you do during 
these short rests"?

It must be kept in mind that we asked the students 
about short rests not longer rests. The above table shows 
that only a small percentage of pupils realize that they 
are taking such rests and know what they do during these 

































- 9 - 


rests. Replies (2) and (6) indicate proper use of short 
rests. It should he noted that 28 % of the students give 
no answers or trivial answers. 

A further analysis was made of the distribution of 
answers by grades and schools. This revealed: 

(1) Very little difference in the Grades X, XI, XII- 

-the Grade XII students show a little more appreciation 

of the value of short rests in studying. 

(2) Very little difference on the average between 
rural, town and city pupils. There seems to be an indica¬ 
tion, however, that pupils from rural areas and smaller 
toms, take their studying more seriously than urban pupils. 
Suggestion : 

Pupils would benefit by being told about these short 
rests. A little demonstration or practice lessons could 
be undertaken to show how often to take such rests and 
what to do during these pauses. Students should become 
aware of the value of these stops to good studying. The 
mind really works during these rests. The matter "sinks 
in" as it were. Very often these rests are also necessary 
for mental relaxation. 

Proceeding with the questions on the conditions and 
habits of study it was deemed necessary to find out from 
the students what subjects impel them to concentrate most 
easily, what subjects interest them most and on what 
subjects they spend most of their time.*

Qbservations and Conclusions : 

There is some significance in the fact that the 
first three subjects selected in Table VI are, Social 

Studies, Science and Mathematics-although not in that 

order-while the last two, English and French. This is 

so in any of the three kinds of schools. It is also sig¬ 
nificant that Social Studies gets the greatest weighting 
in two of the three schools. That it is placed third in 
one kind of school may be attribulted to different methods 
of teaching or different emphasis placed on certain sub¬ 
jects by some teachers. French and English are evidently 
the most difficult of the five subjects for students to 
st udy. 

Looking at Table VII one thing is evident. Sc&ience 
and Social Studies are the most interesting subjects * 

But, except for French, the order of the other three is 
not the same. This is probably due to different methods, 
different teachers, different emphasis placed by teachers 
on different subjects. Foreign languages apparently do 
not interest students very much; neither do they impel the 
students to concentrate. It is also observed that the 
first five subjects tabulated comprise the greatest per¬ 
centage of rural pupils, smaller percentage of town pupils, 
and still smaller percentage of city pupils. For example, 
in Table VII, the first five subjects give a total percen¬ 
tage of 93 for rural schools, 89 for town schools, and 86 
for city schools. This is no doubt due to the fact that 
city schools offer a wider choice of subjects like

shop-work, household economics, commercial subjects, etc. 
which interest many students. Rural schools are limited 
in their offering and therefore more students select the 
subjects listed. 

Some conclusions : 

(1) Students show much interest today in Science 
and Social Studies. 

(2) Social Studies and science impel the students 
to concentrate as much as mathematics. 

(3) Subjects that are easiest to concentrate on tend 
to be those that are most interesting. 

(4) Students can study best the subjects in which 
they are interested. 

(5) It is the teacher that makes the subject interest¬ 
ing. The teacher has much to do to make any subject inter¬ 
esting and to impel students to study it.

Social Studies apparently take the most time. 

It should be remembered that this subject was chosen 
by a great percentage of pupils as being the most interest¬ 
ing and also as being easy to concentrate upon. This 
would indicate a correlation between interest, ease of 
concentration and time spent. 

The order of the other subjects and the percentage 
weighting varies too much to make anythink conclusive. 
Again, as above, much depends upon the teacher. One 
teacher may demand a lot more work on a subject than 
another teacher. 

What is suggested is that students are inclined 
to spend less time on the subjects they don’t like and 
more time on the subjects they like. 

That 92%o of rural pupils spend most of their time 
on the five subjects listed as against 88% of the town 
pupils and 85 % of the city pupils may be due to the fact 
that the town, and especially the city, offer a greater 
variety of subjects on which the students spend a lot of 


their time 























. 
















? - t

- 14 - 


The answer to the question — What subject you don’t 
like? — reveals that: 

(1) In one school students don’t like one subject 
and in another school another subject. As pointed out 
above much depends on the teacher -- he can make a sub¬ 
ject interesting or dull. 

(£) If the teacher burdens the student with too much 
work on a certain subject the student tends to become 
disgusted with the subject and consequently hate it. 

(3) Students tend to dislike subjects that are diffi¬ 
cult for them and like those that are easy. Many choose 
mathematics as the subject they don’t like. It will be 
noticed above, (TABLE VII), that mathematics doesn’t rank 
high as an interesting subject. It may be that the courses 
in mathematics, at least before the recent changes in our 
curriculum, were too difficult, ?here is no reason for 
mathematics not being a very interesting subject. But the 
subject must not be beyond the students’ power of compre¬ 
hension. 

(4) Many students don’t like physics. Again, as 
above, the content of the subject may be too difficult, 
or the trouble may lie with the teacher and with the 
method of teaching the subject. There is no doubt that 
the old physics course in Grade ZII, Mechanics, was too 
difficult for the average student. I don’t think many 
students enjoyed taking that course. Furthermore, a text¬ 
book method of presenting a science course, i.e. learning 
page after page of theory, will not appeal to students. 
Interest could be enhanced by making the course as

exp e rime ntal as possible. Let the students prove for 
themselves by experimenting. 

(5) Very few students dislike the practical subjects 

-commercial subjects, shop work, household economics. 

Some, however, don T t like bookkeeping. 

(6) Students appreciate the study of present day 
problems and any subject pertaining to those problems. 
Social Studies, therefore, is popular.

-Conclusions: 


(1) More pupils in Grade 2 and Grade XI than in Grade XII 
would rather study in a group. It may be that students in 
Grade XII are more mature and feel more independent, desir¬ 
ing, therefore, to study by themselves. The Departmental 
examinations may have something to do with it. Students 























. 

- 














































- 16 - 


Preparing themselves for such examinations resort to a lot 
of sheer memorizing of the subject matter. This is done 
more effectively by self-study. 

(2) The percentage of students desiring to study in a group, 
especially in Grades X and XI, is surprisingly high. This 
ma 3 ^ be due to the new procedures and methods practiced in 

our schools today. Students work more and more in committees. 
Oral work is stressed more. Several students chose the 
group method for the reason that subjects could be discussed 
orally and opinions exchanged. 

(3) Quite a number of students expressed the opinion that 
having just another one is conducive to study—-one who 
is compatible. 

(4) Good students desire to study by themselves. 

The object of our next question was to see what 
the students do when they get tired while studying. It is 
the most natural thing to get tired during diligent study. 

But what a student does about it reflects upon his study 
habits. We assume here, and agree with the assumption, 
that it is better to rest when tired or to overcome the 
fatigue in some way rather than to work right ahead. 

Successful students make it a practice not to work when 
tired. Alternating tasks prove refreshing.

Percentage distribution by grades shows that 61$ of Grade 
X students gave one of the last three suggestions as against 
39$ of Grade XI students and 34$ of Grade XII students. 

This would seem to indicate that on this count Grade XII 
pupils have better study habits than Grade X pupils. 

(2). 66$ of Grade XII students, 61$ of Grade XI students, 
and only 39$ of Grade X students follow good practices or 
diversions when tired and can’t seem to work. 

3. That Grade XII students have better study habits than 
Grade X students is probably due to the former knowing more 
about the technique of. study through experience. 

4. Too many of our students in the high school show poor 
study habits.

Conclusions : 

Very little correlation could be seem between the 
father’s occupation and study habits of students. Although 
our numbers may be insufficient to establish a conclusion 
we are inclined to think that the father or the parents 
have very little influence over their children in the for¬ 
mation of proper study habits. Yet this could and should 
be the case. The professional or skilled man who himself 
has done some studying should be able to impart to his 
son or daughter some advice about efficient work and study. 
Apparently too few, even among those who have studied them¬ 
selves, look upon studying as a technique that has to be 
learned and mastered.

Observations : 

1. Students from homes where the parents or other members 
of the family do some reading orstudying have better study 
habits than students from homes where very little reading 
is done. It was estimated that 44$ of the former students 
have good study habits as against 20$ of the latter; 29$ 

of the former students have poor study habits as against 
44$ of the latter. In homes where more reading is done 
there is a reading atmosphere and this apparently influences 
the students at work. 

2. More reading is done in city homes than in rural homes. 

3. A correlation is indicated here between home influence 
and studjr habits. 


CHAPTER III 

ANALYSIS OF ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS ON 
ASSIGNMENTS, ON READING AND ON NOTE-TAKING 

Assignment is the starting point of planning. It is 

usually after assignments that the study procedures of the 

student begin. The assignments provide the motivation for 

study. Although we realize that the role of the teacher is 

very important in improving study by means of the assignment 

yet we know also that the student, in order to have good 

study habits, must know how to use the assignments and 

what to do with them. 

The students were first asked to select the best procedure 
after an assignment is given. The three suggestions

werre: 

(a) T Going over’ the whole chapter and memorizing as 
much of it as possible. 

(b) Reading the chapter page after page and making 
notes on everything that is in the chapter. 

(c) Having a clear idea of what is to be accomplished 
in the work and only selecting that material which contri¬ 
butes to the question or problem. 

It was found that the percentage weighting was very 

heavey for suggestion (c), -which is the best procedure. 

To any intelligent student, suggestion (c). would be the 
obvious choice. It is significant that in one school many 
students selected suggestion (b). The only explanation we 
have is that the teacher stressed that kind of work. Students 
usually respond to the teacher’s demands in carrying out 
assignments.

The figures of the table show: 

(a) The city schools definitely fall below the rural 

and town schools in making good suggestions to this question. 

(b) The rural schools rank the highest in making &ood 
suggestions. 

(c) The city schools show the heaviest percentage weigh¬ 
ing in giving indefinite, poor or no answers. The rural 
schools show the least percentage weighing in this respect. 

(d) The Grade XII pupils show no superiority in under¬ 
standing what to do with the assignments. 

(e) On the average the number of poor or no answers is 
heavy. 

Conclusions : 

1. The rural pupil definitely shows a superiority over the 
town and city pupil in proceeding intelligently with an 
assignment. This may be due to several factors. Rural 
pupils carry out more assignments. They do more of the 
work independently of the teacher. The teaching time in 
many rural schools is only 50$ of the standard teaching 
time given in cities. Students in smaller schools have to 
carry out more assignments and thus may be in a better 
position to know how to handle them. 

2. Too many assignments-and this may especially be so in 

larger schools-are just to make pupils work for the sake 

of working. Work is thus made an end in itself and assign¬ 
ments are means to that end. Such assignments are useless. 
There must be a better purpose and motive for an assignment 
than just to make pupils work.

3. Too few of our high school pupils when faced with an 

assignment ask themselves such important questions as- 

What is the purpose of this assignment? What am I trying 
to accomplish? What is the aim of this study? What is it. 
exactly that I am trying to find or determine? 

4. It may be that the younger pupils coming into high school, 
trained in the project or the enterprize method of education, 
are just as capable in carrying out assignments as our 
older high school students.

It is assumed here that the teacher can very greatly 
influence the students 1 study habits by the nature and 
kind of assignments he gives. As we said before, assign¬ 
ment is the starting point of planning and of studying. 

The final measure of an assignment is the effectiveness 
of the preparation by each pupil. 

Conclusions and Su ggestions: 

(a) 14$ of the students could give no answer at all. 
This may point to either very bad study habits or it may 
point to the teacher f s failure to make the kind of assign¬ 
ments that would stimulate the pupils 1 activity. 

(b) As the students generally make preparations accord¬ 
ing to the teacher’s demands, it is fairly safe to say 
that their suggestions as to how the teacher could help 
tallies pretty well with what the teacher actually does. 
Apparently then, the teachers give assignments by- giving 
headings, outlines, references, and by discussing the main 
points with the class. This is all very good but to us it 

would appear that there are one or two elements lacking- 

motivation and interest. Only 1$ suggested that a discu¬ 
ssion of the purpose of the assignment would help; only 2$ 
suggested that the arousing of interest (motivation) would 
help. Too few students, then, are aware of these impor¬ 
tant criteria of a good assignment--it should awaken 

interest; it must have aims and objectives; it should have 
a definite and a worthy purpose. 

(c) Let the pupils ask themselves and be able to 
answer this—"What is the purpose of this assignment"? 

When they realize and appreciate the purpose of the 


































- 25 - 


assignment they will do it. 

TABLE XV 

Students were asked to comment upon an assignment 

consisting merely of-"Study the next five paragraphs”. 

The answers revealed whether the students understand what 
a good assignment is and whether they ask themselves the 
important question -- "What is the aim or purpose of this?" 
What are we looking for?

Conclusions and S ug gestions : 

(a) On the average only slightly over 40$ of the stud¬ 
ents show good understanding. It is almost alarming that 
about 60$ of the students show a lack of understanding in 
what constitutes a good assignment. 

(b) Rural pupils show the best understanding in dealing 
with an assignment, town pupils are next and city pupils 
rank the lowest. Could it be that pupils in smaller schools 
have to do more of the organization and planning themselves 

-due to less instruction time —and thereby become more 

adept in dealing intelligently with assignments? 





































- 26 - 


(c) It is significant that in Grade XII, especially, 
the students of rural school show better understanding than 
pupils of city schools. One reason may be this. Generally 
speaking, in rural schools or schools of small centers 
students in the upper grades of high school are those that 
definitely have ambition and want to ’go ahead’. They 
mean business. In city schools more students are found in 
the higher grades who are attending schools because they 
have nothing else to do. They are not as conscientious 
about their studying. 

(d) Although in rural and tom schools the Grade XI 
students show better understanding than the Grade X students, 
and the Grade XII students show better understanding than 
students of Grade X or Grade XI, yet, in the city school 

the reverse is indicated. 

Further analysis of the suggestions given has shown 
that far too many students in taking and doing an assignment 
are concerned with such questions as: 

(a) Will there be a test on it? 

(b) What will the teacher ask? 

(c) I wonder whether we have to make notes on this, 
or not? 

(d) What does the teacher want? 

(e) Did the teacher really mean it? 

(f) Is it necessary to study this? Why study It? 

These questions are significant because they reveal 

what the students are thinking about. The first five of 
these definitely do not come under the criteria for good 
assignments. Are the students still made to feel and 












' ■

- 27 - 


to think that they are working for the teacher? Question 
(e) indicates that probably the teachers at times are 
unreasonable in their demands — giving too many assign¬ 
ments and giving them just for the sake of making the 
students work. Question (f) is significant. Many stud¬ 
ents apparently want^fknow the reason, the aim, the objective 
of an assignment. Motivation and interest are important 
factors in assignments. 

The assignments should also be clear, definite and 
understood by the pupils. 

Good assignments not only make pupils study but make 
them study the right way.

The majority of students evidently prefer to study 
assignment immediately after it is given. The reasons 
that received the greatest weighting, are, in order of 
weighting: 

(a) Because it is fresh in my mind. 

(b) To get it over with. 

(c) It is harder to get back to studying after a while.

We proceed now to another important phase of study¬ 
ing -- reading. Before a student reads a book he should 
know how to tell quickly whether the book will give him 
the information desired. It is asrsumed here that there 
are several signals or guides which tell that, namely; 
index, contents, title and sub-titles. It is also assumed 
that students who have good study habits know what signals 
to look for and know how to find the information in the 
book.

Conclusions and suggestion : 


Approximately two-thirds of the students know what 
signs or signals to look for but one-third of the students 
do not. This seems surprising to us in view of the fact 
that many high-school subjects to-day require wider and 
freer reading. Ear too many students do not know how to 
look for information. 

The teacher could help the students by simply tell¬ 
ing them how to use the contents and the index of a book; 
by instructing them to pay some attention to the title,

preface and the introductory note. 

How many students mark up the text book? We assume 
that text books could be marked up; that good students 
underline passages or put some markings in the their books; 
that so doing helps to fix points in mind; that it is a 
sign of good studying and industrious work.

Conclusions : 

(a) The above figures indicate that the rural school 
student: marks up his book more than the town or city stu¬ 
dent. The city student marks it up the least. Could it 
be that the pupils in smaller high schools work more 
independently of the teachers and have to resort more to 
self study? 

(b) In both rural and town schools the Grade XI percen¬ 
tage weighting is higher than the Grade X weighting and 























- 30 - 


the Grade XII weighting higher than the Grade XI weighting. 
This we would expect as the older pupils should be more 
adept in knowing how to determine quickly the validity of 
a source of information. But the Grade XII students of 
the city show no such superiority over the students of- the 
two grades. This is difficult to explain. 

(c) The successful high-school students of a smaller 
school seem to show greater initiative and resourcefullness 
in looking for information and studying independently from 
a book. 

(d) Only slightly over 50% of the high school students 
mark up their text book. 

It is interesting to note some of the reasons the 
students give for marking up the text book. We shall give 
the reasons in the order of the greatest weighting each 
reason received: 

(a) To mark important headings or passages. 

(b) Facilitate note-making. 

(c) It makes it easier to review. 

Very few suggested these reasons: 

(a) Helps concentration. 

(b) Fixes points in your mind. 

(c) Makes important ideas stand out. 

These last three reasons are important. 

fwo most important reasons for not marking the book: 

(a) It abuses the book, (apparently lowering the 
resale value has something to do with it) 

(b) What is the use of doing it?.

■Je realize, of course, that the text book is not the 
place to write lengthy notes. But jotting very briefly 
ideas or important points is often a sign of mental acti¬ 
vity. It shows good comprehension and therefore good study¬ 
ing.

Taking the average of the three grades for each 
school 60$ of the rural, 54$ of the city and 50$ of 
the town pupils make outlines. That means that 
approximately 45$ of the high school students who ans¬ 
wered our questionnaires do not make outlines. 

We feel that the practice of making outlines is con¬ 
ducive to and a factor in good studying. Outlines help to 
organize the work, facilitate review, serve as an aid in 
memorizing. Indeed, outlines are guides to more effective 
study. Far too many pupils, then, show poor study habits 
in this respect. 

The better pupils make outlines regularly. But the 
poorer students should be trained to make and keep outlines. 
This improvement in the technique of studying should be 
undertaken by the teachers. 



























• 

■ 










'■ 





















- 34 - 


The students were also asked to give suggestions on 
how to make good outlines. 

-about 45% gave fairly good suggestions. 

-about 20%.gave poor suggestions. 

- 35% gave no suggestion at all. 

The suggestion of making headings and sub-headings 
was by far the most frequent. Only a few indicated the 
very important use of key words and ideas to suggest the 
thought of longer passages. 

Suggestion : 

Making good outlines is a technique that has to be 
learned. It does not come naturally to students. Some 
acquire it through practice and others do not. Knowing 
how to make good outlines facilitates studying and learning. 
Many of our students in the high schools don’t know how to 
make outlines and yet nothing is done about it. The teacher 
can and should train the students to make outlines and make 
them well. Merely putting down headings and sub-headings 
is better than nothing, -^ut putting down key words, ideas 

not sentences, condensing thoughts---these are more 

important. 

Reading for understandingis a slow process. It 
requires frequent stops to analyze and to consider what 
has been read. It involves the use of a pencil to write 
in the book or on a pad, to mark passages and to underline 
words. Kor clear comprehension reading must be deliberate 
in such subjects as Social Studies, science and mathematics. 
It entails mental activity. The most direct sign that the

Conclusions: 


To read slowly for understanding and analysis, as 
should be done in Social Studies and Science, a period of 
much more than one hour to one hour and a half is hardly 
possible. In fact we don’t think that the proper kind of 
reading in these subjects could be done adequately if the 
periods are much over one hour at a sitting. Students 
who suggest periods from 1-J to 2 hours, or more than two 
hours, evidently are not doing the right kind of reading— 
the slow deliberate reading that requires mental activity 
and entails fatigue. They apparently do the one kind of 
reading in all subjects, that is, outline-reading or skim¬ 
ming. In view of this 25%> of the students can’t do the 
right kind of reading in Social Studies and 29% of them 
don’t do it in Science. We even feel that the percentage 
weighting for the suggested period of from 1 to 1^ hours 
is too heavy.

Students who can’t read Social Studies and Science 
for at least half an hour, also show lack of good reading 
habits. About 1 2% of the students are in this class. 

The above information points to one abvious conclu¬ 
sion-^that a large body of our students by suggesting 

too long or too short periods reveal that they are not in 
the habit of employing the method of slow reading for 
understanding, the method that must be associated with good 
study habits. 

It is quite possible to spend more than two hours 
reading a novel. 68% of the students indicate that they 
do it. However, with a certain amount of mental activity, 
two hours at a sitting is tiring. Obviously our students 
are more in the habit of skimming rapidly. They read a 
novel f for the story’ more than for anything else.

We repeat here again as we did above, that reading for 
understanding is a slow process. It is assumed that read¬ 
ing of Social Studies or History requires fairly slow read¬ 
ing. Rapid reading or skimming is not the best kind of 
reading for this subject. The material must sink in and 
be digested, as it were. Frequent stops are necessary to 
think about the content read and to ponder over ideas and 
thoughts. We assume also, of course, that the study of 
Social Studies is not merely the massing together of facts. 
Conclusions : 

(a) £0 to 40 pages an hour received the greatest percen¬ 
tage weighting. This is probably what it should be. But 
talcing the average, only slightly over one-third of the 
students fall into this class. 18% of Grade X students, 

25% of Grade XI and 21% of Grade XII students read history 
too rapidly. As pointed out in the assumption above, such 
material cannot be properly absorbed with rapid reading. 

(b) The figures do not show anything conclusive as to 
the differences in the grades. 

(c) Approximately one-third of the students gave inde¬ 
finite or no replies. 

'(d) We realize that answers given by students here are 
subject to a certain amount of guessing.

(a) Far too-many of our students want too much comfort

body invites a similar attitude of the mind. Only a limi¬ 
ted kind of reading could be done when curled up in an 
easy chair. 

(b) Difficult reading for understanding could not be 
done effectively when reclining in an easy chair or in bed. 
It is best done sitting up by a table or desk. 

(c) A good study hint is to use a pencil and pad while 
reading. The business of jotting notes* marking passages 
and underlining words should accompany reading in all sub¬ 
jects except perhaps, English. Therefore, giost of the read¬ 
ing that the students do should hot be done in an easy 

chair or in bed. 

(d) Good students do most of their reading sitting up 


by a desk.

(e) A great percentage of our students show poor study 
habits by revealing poor reading habits. 

(f) 64$ of the rural students indicated that they do 
their reading sitting up at a desk as against 41$ of the 
town pupils and only 30$ of the city pupils. This may 
point to these facts: 

1. That rural students have better reading habits. 

2. That town and city students lead an easier life 
with more leisure and consequently prefer doing 
their studying in a leisurely manner. 

3. There are more easy chairs and comforts in city 
homes than in country homes. 

(g) There is evidence to support the belief that teachers 
do very little in coaching the students in the best proce¬ 
dures and methods of studying.

as a general policy it is well to get an idea of the con¬ 
tent of the material before proceeding to more careful 
reading. 

The difference in the percentage weighting for diff¬ 
erent schools is not marked enough to comment upon. 

The distribution of the weighting by grades is not 
shown in this table. But it could be mentioned that there 
was not much difference between the grades. This points 
to one significant fact, however, and that is, that the 
students 1 reading habits are not improved very much by 
grades. The students either have good reading habits or 
they have not. What study habits they have, they show 
evidence of them in Grade X. If the Grade XII student 
does not show much superiority over the Grade X student 

we are forced to ask this important question-what is 

the high school doing about training the students "how 
to read"? There is evidence in our investigation to show 
that very little is done to train the students in the 
technique of reading and studying. 


We want to determine next whether students make 
short stops while reading. These stops are characterized 
by mental activity. Associations and applications take 
place. Such pauses give time for the material to ’sink in' 
We stop to concentrate; to think about what has been read. 
The assumption is that good students make such pauses while 
poor students i.e. those with poor study habits, read right 
ahe ad.

We had to distinguish between short stops for concen¬ 
tration and longer stops for rest. This we did by the 
nature of the reasons or explanations given as to what is 
done during these stops. What we want to determine is 
how many stop: 

— to think about what has been read. 

— to let the material sink in. 

-- to make associations. 

— to help grasp the material. 

We assume that such stops are signs of good reading 
and good studying. 

Many students stop but for reasons other than those 
that characterize mental activity. Some such reasons are: 
































• • F ' ' ■ '• 





* 

















- 42 - 


— to rest the eyes. 

— to day-dream for a while. 

— to listen to what is going on around them. 

— to think about something else. 

Conclusions : 

(a) Approximately 40 % of the students make short pauses 
that characterize good study habits. A great body of our 
students, then, do not. 

(b) The senior students show no superiority over 
the junior students. 

(c) The average for the rural and town high schoos is 
a little above the average for the city schools. 

(d) Evidence is again in favour of our contention that 

very little attention is given to study habits. 

* 


To complete this part of the diagnosis of the study 
habits of our high school students we shall consider furth¬ 
er the answers to a few of the questions asked about making 
and taking of notes. 

We attempted to find out whether high school pupils 
classify facts. Again, we tried to determine whether they 
do it adequately or not by their suggestions as to how they 
classify facts. The familiar suggestion of "headings and 

sub-headings" was prominent. "By following outlines"- 

received a high rating. Apparently the giving of outlines 
by teachers is "the order of the <V Many classify their 
facts in the order of importance or in a chronological 
order. Yet, more than 50 % of the students gave no

- 43 - 


suggestion at all. Judging carefully the replies and the 
nature of the question, we are satisfied to say that at 
least 50 % of our high school students have no definite 
plan to classify facts and are not in the habit of doing so. 

It is strongly felt, also, that the teacher could 
help the student to acquire this technique by classifying 
facts now and then for them. The students would learn 
through the force of example set by the teacher.

The dangers are self-explanatory. I think it will 
be agreed that all of these suggestions represent diffi¬ 
culties that our students have. We feel that too many 
of the high school students have those difficulties. 

The only recommendation we have is that the teacher 
by example and by supervision should try to train the 
students to make good notes. It is a technique which 
requires some practice under guidance. 


How many students prefer using a loose-leaf system 
of keeping notes? We find that over 90 jo of the students 
use a loose-leaf system. This is so in every grade of the 
high school and in every kind of school. The reasons are: 

(a) Could insert or take out notes at any time. 

(b) Could put in articles, diagrams, maps, etc. 

(c) More information could be inserted in the proper 
place at a later date. 

(d) It Is convenient to take out exercises to be 
handed in to the teacher. 

(e) You could arrange the notes as you desire. 

(f) More than one subject could be kept in one booki. 
(The above reasons are those suggested by the students) 

In these reasons we can see evidences of the require¬ 
ments and objectives of the new programme of our changed 
curriculum. There is no doubt that the new programme 
makes the loose-leaf book almost a necessity. We definitely 
feel, with the students, that it is all for the better.

Observations : 

(a) There are many students in the high schools who 
never take or make any notes. 

(b) There are many factors that determine whether or 
not the students take notes in class. 

(c) Some teachers demand strict attention and therefore 
students are not allowed to take notes during the time of 
instruction. 

(d) The best time to take notes would be after the 
teacher’s instruction time. 'However, only a few suggested 
that they take notes at the end of a class period. In 
larger schools this is impossible because the students 



























- 46 - 


have another class. Students in smaller schools have more 
time, outside of instruction time, and have the opportunity 
to make notes after the teacher leaves the class. There 
may be some advantage in this. 

(e) So much depends upon the teacher . His ways and 
methods are copied by the pupils. Students study accord¬ 
ing to his demands. The difference in the percentage 
weighting of different schools is due to a large extent 
to the different requirements set by the teacher in the 
respective schools. 

(f) There is very little indication that the Grade XII 
students make more notes than the Grade X or XI students.

Re c oiaiie rid u t i o n : 

Definite training in note taking should be given. The 
method of note taking should strengthen right methods of 
study because it guides the efforts along proper lines and 
preserves the partial results of study. Notes should reflect 
steps in collecting and organizing information. Just copying 
headings from books is not note-taking. 


CHAPTER IV 

ANALYSIS OE ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS ON ’LEARNING- AND MEMORIZING’ 

We proceed now to the last group of questions in our 
analysis. These are on "learning and memorizing". Study¬ 
ing is a complex process. For example, good assignments, 
good methods of note-taking, correct reading habits, all 
are part of good studying. All guide the efforts along the 

proper lines to the final objective - learning. The object 

of all studying is the final analysis, learning and memoriz¬ 
ing. V/e therefore feel s.omewhat justified in considering 
"learning and memorizing" last. Since there is much litera¬ 
ture on this subject our assumptions will be based upon 
established principles of educational psychology.

Generally speaking "learning by wholes" is better than 
"learning by parts". Only 32$ of the students know this. 

The other body of our students are not aware of this fact. 

It seems to us that students who are actually doing the 
business of learning and memorizing should know something 
about the technique of it and something about the established 
rules of good procedures. 

We recommend that our students get some training in 
the psychology of learning. Of course, the teachers must 
have the necessary knowledge of educational psychology first. 


We also asked the students the question - "How could 

you memorize better, when you read a selection rapidly or 
slowly?" Only 18$ of the students indicated that rapid 
reading is better for memorizing. Yet this is actually so.

Assumption : 

Frequent practices are best. Spacing repetitions over 
a longer period of time will more likely produce that "over 
learing" which we should aim for. The danger is more often 
"under learing". This idea of distributing the time in 
practice over a longer period of time is important. A few 
minutes spent daily with systematic regularity is better 
than more prolonged practice. Skill deteriorates rapidly 
unless used with some regularity. A distribution of practice 
and rest periods actually promotes learning. Rest periods 
allow the results of practice to "set". 

Conclusion : 

A greater percentage of students seem to realize that 
shorter practices over a longer period is better. This may 
be the result of experience or it may be that "short practices" 
appeal to students. Longer periods are distracting. We are 
not satisfied that this increace in percentage weighting here 
over the two questions above, indicates a knowledge by the 
students of the learing process.

a better way of learning material than merely "going over

(b) Of course all students do not have the same methods 
or habits of learning. Some suggestion may help one student 
but not another. All of the suggestions given by the students 
are, in some measure, aids to learning. 

(c) It is felt that the last four suggestions, 4,5,6, 
and 7, are better than the first three. We would like to 

see more students giving any one or more of these suggestions. 

(d) Writing the material out is apparently a common way 
of learning a body of material.

students are ignorant of this simple device, if we may call 
it so, which aids in learning and memorizing. This is 
further proof that high school students know very little 
about the learning process. Yet we force them and require 
them to learn all the time. It seems to us that they 
should know more about the business they are at.

(c) 20$ of the students learn or memorize by writing 
the material out. 

(d) A small percentage of the students indicate that 
they learn the meanings first. It is easier to memorize 
meaningful than nonsensical material. 

It is felt that a great body of our students resort 
too much to mechanical memorizing of material that they 
don’t understand. Better and clearer understanding should 
be stressed before memorization. 

(e) The last four suggestions receiving the least percen¬ 
tage weighting are good suggestions. It is felt that formulas 
should not be div orced from their application. ke believe 
that all material, if it is to be worth learning or committ¬ 
ing to memory, must be functional and have definite meaning 
and significance in student’s experience and life. 

(f) One of the difficulties that our high school students 
have in their important job of learning is the learning of 
abstract and meaningless stuff. Such learning is therefore 
difficult and distasteful. 


Fixing points in mind is another important factor in 
good studying. Good students have ways and means for fixing 
important points in their minds. We assume that points are 
usually fixed in mind by: 

T. Underlining them in the text book. 

2. Jotting them down on a pad or in a note-book. 

3. Going over them mentally several times with rest 
periods in between.

you already know. 

5. By frequent review.

the suggestions given by high school students.

Observations and Recommendations : 

1. Many good suggestions were given by some students. 

2. Some of the good suggestions received very light 
percentage weighting — like suggestions 2,3,4,6. 

3. Too few of the students gave good suggestions. 45$ 
of the students gave no suggestion or very poor suggestions. 

It seems incredible that so many of the students who 
presumably are doing the business of studying cannot suggest 
how they fix certain points in mind. 45$ of the students 
who answered our questionnaire have no plan or system to 
fix points in mind. Yet, as we said before, this is an 
important factor in studying. 

4. Of the suggestions given, No.l, i.e. by making out¬ 
lines or notes, was selected more than all the other sugges¬ 
tions put together. This does show, we think, that outside 
of this procedure our students do not know enough about 
fixing points in mind. 

5. Suggestions "2" and "4" are important. .fe feel that 
the majority of our high school students do not practice 
very much that which is termed in educational psychology, 
"over-learning." Many pupils are unable to produce results 
because they stop after getting the needed information; stop 
while it is so beffogged as to be unreliable. They stop on 
the threshhold of real learning. There is a lot of waste 

in "under-learning." It is the completing effort that counts.' 

6. Students should be taught to take the last few minutes 

of study for a final try-out - a mental checking over of the 

points. It is a very good study habit to spend the remaining 

few moments of a lesson rapidly checking the highlights of the 

lesson.

42 % of the students review only before examinations. 

A great body of our students may still have the notion that 
they study merely to pass examinations. There should be a 
higher motive than that prompting them to work. We must 
get rid of the idea that students study for the teacher or 
to pass examinations. The new programme vith fewer final 
exams, with recommendations based upon class work and class

- 57 - 


performance as well as teats, should have the effect of 
dispelling this idea of "studying just before examinations." 
Frequent and unannounced tests should get the students to 
review more regularly and more frequently. 

The general conclusion is that a very small percentage 
of high school students practice regular and frequent review¬ 
ing. Only 10% review shortly after the work has been taken 
up in class. Yet this practice is essential for "retention." 
Students find it difficult to recall material that has been 
learned because there is nothing to recall. It has gone. 
Frequent and regular reviewing is a marked characteristic 
of good study habits. Such review provides the re-learning 
and "over-learning" that is so necessary for "retention." 
Since forgetting occurs mostly within twenty-four hours 
after learning the material, a daily review is necessary. 
Teachers should realize that a quick review of each day’s 
work before new work is taken up is a good procedure. Also, 
more extensive review at intervals of a week or so is good 
practice. 

But the point that we wish to emphasize — and we can¬ 
not do it too strongly - is that the students don’t seem 

to be aware of these fac ts. They are doing the business of 
learning without knowing how to learn. They are studying 
but they show poor study habits. Should students not know 
the importance of reviewing the material frequently? Should 
they not develop the habit of short, quick reviews? If the 
answer is in the affirmative, what than is being done about 


it?

- 58 - 


The kind of reviewing that the majority of our students 
are in the habit of doing, is the long, intensive kind, 

committing to memory large bodies of material - as a rule 

before tests. This results in cramming. It explains the 
rapid forgetting of great bulks of the material by the high 
school student as he progresses from subject to subject 
and from grade to grade. 

Another feature that should characterize reviewing is 
the condensing of the material and reviewing for main points . 
Too often students review in detail . Although many students 
have indicated previously and at this point that they con¬ 
dense the work as they review, we feel that the poorer 
students, especially, are not in the habit of doing it. 
Condensing and jotting things down while reviewing is a 
good study habit. 

Very little difference is shown in review habits 
between the three high school grades.

We conclude our analysis with some general questions 
designed to determine still further the difficulties and 
problems the students have in studying.

Some suggestions, in order of prominence. 

1. A greater challenge in the high school grades. 

2. New type of programme and different methods of teaching. 

3. Realizing the importance of an education. 

4. A desire to get ahead. 

5. A good teacher. 

6. The new type of Grade IX 

7. Coming to a different school which had better methods. 

8. A more interesting course; variety and choice of subjects-

5. Had to cover in Grade IX large topics in a short while. 

6. A knowledge that these days you have to have an 
education to advance. 

7. Parents got after me. 

8. Large libraries and more references. 

9. Being out of school for a while - I had to make up for 

lost time and therefore got down to serious studying. 

Only suggestions selected by several students are 
given. All of the suggestions are interesting, each throw¬ 
ing some light upon our analysis. It is significant that 
"New programme and newer methods of teaching 1 2 3 4 5 ' is found 
third in one table and second in the other table. Also, 
it is significant that "The teacher” is first in the latter 
table and fifth in the former table. The new type of Grade 
IX is found fairly high up in both tables. 

Our conclusion is that the teacher and his methods of 
teaching are the two greatest factors in making students 
study more effectively; in moulding their study habits. 

TABLE XXXIX 

7/HAT APE YOUR GREATEST DIFFICULTIES IN STUDYING? 


1. Can't concentrate on my work. 

2. Not interested; studying things I don't like. 

3. Getting down to it; to start. 

4. Don't understand the work. 

5. Not enough time to spend on each subject; too many 
assignments.

6. Noisy surroundings. 

7. A wandering mind. 

8. I don’t like the teacher. 

9. A poor memory. 


The difficulties mentioned here need very little 
comment. Most of these have been dealt with in various 
questions above. However, some of these suggestions by 
the students attest to some of our previous conclusions, 
for example, that; 

(a) Students have to learn a lot of abstract material 
which they don’t understand and consequently don’t like, 

(b) Getting the pupils interested is the first step 
in making them study. 

(c) Comprehension and application should be stressed 
before learning and memorizing. 

(d) If the students don’t like a teacher or his methods 
they do not study as well. The teacher is a very important 
factor in developing study habits. 

(e) Many of our students haven’t got a good place to study. 

Many of the city pupils gave ”5” ( bottom, of page 60) 

as a difficulty. ,/e have mentioned above, under ’’assigments, ” 
that too many assignments sometimes distracts and disgusts 
the pupil to the extent that he does not study. 

” Getting down to it” or starting to work seems to be 
a study problem of our students. He all know how easy it is 
to be a prey to this habit. Students should be told about 
the importance of having a definite time for studying and

to make a vigorous beginning at that time. The ’flying staff 
habit is an important one. A delayed beginning, often 
accompanied by flustrations, worry, 1 etc., wastes time and 
energy. Teachers should practice vigorous beginnings in 
lessons at school. This habit and attitude will transfer 
to the pupils. 


CHAPTER VI 

GENERAL CONCLUSIONS AMD RECOMMENDATIONS 
V.'e have been making conclusions and recommendations as 
we went along. It would therefore be unnecessary repetition 
to enumerate all of them again. However, we shall give now 
some of the summaries of our findings, enumerate the obvious 
impressions or important conclusions and make suggestions as 
to improving the study habits of our students. 

One most obvious conclusion is that only about one- 
third of our high school students have good study habits. 
Answers to questions and students’ suggestions reveal that 
many students know little about and do not practice good 
study procedures. Figure 1 (page 63) will reveal that about 
one third show only fair understanding of good study proce¬ 
dures and the other one third (approximately) have very poor 
'study habits. One great difficulty that our students have, 
then, is not knowing how to study. What is to be done about 
it? YJe take the view that the process of pupil training 
should emphasize the training of pupils to organize their 
study procedures in an effective manner. ..'e as teachers

teach subjects but not how to study subjects. 

What have we as teachers done so far about the study 
habits of our high school students? I feel that generally 
•speaking we didn’t give it much thought and a* . L that the 

technique which we call ’studying 1 will take care of itself. 

I am afraid that the part of the programme known as studying 
has been left very much undirected and unguided. The respon¬ 
sibility has been thrown upon the pupils to find their way 
by trial and error. Many of us must feel that study habits 
come naturally and therefore do not look upon it as a tech¬ 
nique that must be learned or acquired through proper direc¬ 
tion of working habits. The teacher should direct his stu¬ 
dents in study habits and thus emancipate them from a 
dependence on both textbooks and teachers. The teacher must 
look after the preparation of the conditions of study, direct 
pupils as to what they are to do, properly motivate the work 
to be done, cause the pupils to set standards for their work, 
develop in them effective methods of attacking and solving 
problems, and thus train pupils to think for themselves. 

The emphasis should shift from recitation to the preparation 
for the recitation, from accumulation of knowledge to learn¬ 
ing how to find and use knowledge, from the gathering of 
information to learning how to use it. The help that pupils 
could derive from rules of study formulated for them by 
teachers is analogous to the help which an amateur receives 
from the instructions of an expert coach who has fully 
mastered some skill. The amateur does not know how to 
proceed because he lacks experience. Of course one may say

here that the students should know how to study when they 
come to high school. The pupils should have acquired the 
technique in the public and the intermediate schools. But 
obviously many of them have not. 

There is a redeeming feature that we have noticed, 
however. Our new programme and new methods of teaching with 
emphasis on finding information, making and giving reports, 

wider reading of material, etc. - student activity - 

will develop better study habits in the students. Many 
pupils have given the above factor as responsible for the 
improvement in their study habits. 


Another general conclusion is that students of small 
schools study just as well if not better than students of 
large schools. Table 1 showing the distribution of stu¬ 
dents in the three kinds of schools reveals that more rural 
high school students show good study habits. The percentage 
distribution falls slightly from rural to city schools for 
good study habits and rises slightly from rural to city 
schools for poor study habits. Ne have pointed out before 
that fewer high school students are found in smaller schools 
—-- in proportion to the public school population. Those 
who are there are the better students who "mean business". 
Also, students in smaller schools do much of their work 
independently of the teacher. They have to do much of the 
work themselves and therefore are forced to adopt some good 
study habits to get results.

Figure 11 (page 64) shows the percentage distribution 
between the grades. We notice that the percentage rises 
for good study habits from Grade X to Grade XII and falls 
for poor study habits from the former grade to the latter. 
This would indicate a slight superiority on the part of 
senior students. However the difference is not great and we 
have found many cases in our investigation where the senior 
pupils show little superiority over the junior pupils. 


Diagnosis in any field is of little value unless it 
is followed by a sound remedial procedure. Ve have already 
stressed the important role the teacher pkays and recommend 
that teachers adopt the attitude towards the technique of 
studying as outlined above. We further recommend that 
teachers take time off to actually instruct the pupils on 

the various phases of studying - reading, analyzing, 

note-making, memorizing, etc. We would like to see an 
elementary course put into the high school curriculum on 
the "Psychology of learning", ^his could be made part of 
the course in "Psychology" which is already on as an option, 
or it could be part of the course of "Vocations and Guidance". 

We.assume that this needed training for effective 
study should be undertaken and therefore conclude by giving 
various methods and rules for teaching the students "How to 
Study". 

(a) Give a definite course on methods of study. Give 
training in addition to advice. Merely telling students how 
to study is not enough. They must be given actual practice 
in studying. Give directions and demonstrations for doing 
actual tasks, _

(b) The students should know what physical and mechanical 

conditions are favorable to studying - good physical 

condition; paying attention to light, ventilation, tempera¬ 
ture, etc.; removing handicaps like impaired vision; wearing 
comfortable and appropriate clothes. 

(c) Stress the need for having a definite time and place 
for studying. Make the environment conducive to study. 

When the time comes for study let the students start promptly. 

(d) The students must know how long to study - rest 

when tired; do not force yourself unduly; short pauses to 
allow the material to "sink in". 

(e) Motivate the pupils. There must be an interest; 
pupils never learn without it. Show that the material is 
worthy of being studied. Make lessons life-like. Get the 
right attitude towards studying. 

(f) Teach in the way you expect your students to study. 

If you want the students to stress main points, stress them 
yourself. If you want them to organize their ideas, organize 
your own before you present them. Discuss in the class the 
possible ways of attacking a given lesson or task. 

(g) How to study is closely related to what is studied. 

(h) Improve study by means of assignments. Give more 
assignments which require original investigation. Some 

other criteria of assignments - having a worthy purpose, 

being clear and definite, awakening interest, having aims 
and objectives, not too difficult nor too heavy. 

(i) Students should know how to concentrate attention. 
Stress should be laid on starting promptly, on developing

proper attitude of persistance, of interest to learn, of 
the avoidance of worry and excitement, of avoiding distrac¬ 
tions from without and within, 

(j) Check the pupils’ reading habits. Reading is an 
art. Students should be able to skim for important facts 

and to read slowly for understanding. Underlining and jotting 
things down while reading helps to fix points in mind. Read¬ 
ing is done best sitting up at a desk. Make outlines of your 
readings. 

(k) Students should have the habitsof making notes - 

analyzing, condensing, using ’key-words’, using a loose- 

leaf system. Review all notes at least once after writing them. 

(l) Knowing what to commit to memory and how to do it 
economically is important. Instructions in committing to 
memory should aim to show what sort of matter should be 
memorized and what afe some common rules of committing to 

memory economically-read aloud, read rapidly, learn as 

a whole, practice associations, review often, etc. 

(m) Students should know how to learn economically. 

Some rules - group related facts, associate one thing 

with another, think over what has been learned, have rest 
periods between practice periods, practice frequently over 
a long period of time, make short reviews often, have a 
system of fixing points in mind, apply what has been learned. 

These suggestions will serve to show in a sketchy way 
the details that might be used in teaching students how to 
study effectively. Let me close by saying once more that 
such instruction is needed, that it is welcomed by the 

students, that it ought to be done in the secondary schools 
but is not.
