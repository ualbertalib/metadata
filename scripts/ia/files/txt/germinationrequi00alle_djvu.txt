GERMINATION RKQUIRElvlKMtE OF SERBS OF 
TREES AND SHRUBS

INTRODUCTION 

Nursery, forestry, and plant breeding work on 
the prairies has reached great proportions in recent years. 
Confronting the workers in these fields are many problems, 
the major on© being the proper treatments necessary to 
prepare seeds for gemination* 

The eg© old practice of planting seed when ripe 
and waiting one, two,or more seasons for it to germinate, 
not only offers many disadvantages but is unnecessary end 
in many cases i practical. Practical and efficient propa¬ 
gation by seed requires exact Information as to the proper 
method of handling. Whereas the n urseryman end layman 
often are willing to chance slow and incomplete gemina¬ 
tion, exactness becomes a necessity with the plant breeder. 
A knowledge of the conditions required to prepare seeus for 
germination, enables the pinduction of seedlings ©t the

most favorable period, when they ere wanted, as when condi- 
tions are favorable for continued development. 

In many instances vegetative propagation has re¬ 
placed propagation by seeds not only because the former 
method is easier and quicker in many instances, but many 
plants do not breed true when raised from seed. Characters 
of the .majority of trees and shrubs however, ere reasonably 
fixed and these propagate true enough from seed for orna¬ 
mental purposes. The production of such plants on e large 
scale, as well as the creation of new end better types, are 
factors that combine to make propagation by seed an invalu¬ 
able practice. 

Investigators have shown that vai ieties es well as 
species and genera vary considerably in treatments necessary 
to prepare seed for germination, lot only are there these 
differences, but variations occur among the same types under 
different environmental conditions, Emphasis is placed upon 
the fact that treatments for seed germination are specific 
and although they may be the same for different localities 
in a general way, for best results individual methods depend¬ 
ing upon the type of seed, geographical location, and avail¬ 
able facilities, should b© practiced. 

The present study is mainly concerned with a prac¬ 
tical and easy method, for preparing seeds for germination. 
Although some side problems arose, the germination require-

trees and shrubs i ve been establish® j, under the co?idi-

Types of Seeds 

Laurie and Chadwick (45) classify seeds into four 
general groups as far as their germine live power 1 s concern¬ 
ed* 

1. Seeds that germinate immediately after ripening 
when given favorable conditions. 

2 . heeds that possess incompletely organized and im¬ 
mature embryos. 

5. Seeds that fail to germinate because of their 

hard seed coats* 

4. Seeds that require a rest period during which 
chemical changes take place before germination 

will occur. 

The same authors classify seeds according to their 

physical characters. 

1. Dustlike or fine 

2. Fleshy, oily and mucilaginous < r; ,.^sculus . J .urebla ,

5. Hard coated seeds: Berberis , Care gens . Cerye t 
Celastrus , Cornua , Cotonesster , Cr t taegus * 

UL&eagnus , J unlperus . Juglans . honlcera * fob1us t 
Pyrus * ;Tunus , Bhemnus . Boss . Tilis end 
Viburnum , The majority of the plants mentioned 
constitute the group defined by most nurserymen 
es two-yesr seeds and are the most common in 
the nursery trade, 

Crocker (17) describes two types of two-year seeds. 
In the first type bacteria and fungi partially eat away the 
thick coats during the warm weather of summer so that the 
embryos obtain an adequate supply of water and oxygen for 
after-ripening during the cold winter* Among plants with 
such seeds ere the common snowberry, silver bell tree, haw¬ 
thorns 9 basswood and most cotonesstars. 

In another type of two-year seed the root grows 
during the first summer but shoot growth will not start un¬ 
til the epieotyi or bud that forms it, has been exposed to 
a low temperature for a while* Among plants that produce 
such seeds are peonies (©specially tree peonies), and cold¬ 
er temperate zone viburnums. 

Seeds that will not germinate for considerable 
periods although mature, even when placed under conditions 
favorable to germination are said to be "dormant", "rest¬ 
ing", or having an "after-ripening" development (46).

xfter-Ripening 

Kains end Mc^uesten (46) define "after-ripening" 
as the term applied to the period between the maturing of 
the fruit of certain plants and the time ?h©n the seeds will 
germinate. Kckerson (27) recognized that some changes with¬ 
in the embryo of certain seeds are necessary before germina¬ 
tion, or lengthening of the hypocotyl, can trke place. 

Jones (44) uses "after-ripening" as referring to the series 
of chemical end physical changes occurring within the embryo 
or associated structures, which bring to a close the 
dormant period and make germination possible. 


Dormancy 

The rest or dormant period in plants according to 
filler (50) is a period when the plants or plant .parts to 
all appearances do not grow. The rest period is considered 
by some to be a direct response to the changing external 
conditions, while others consider it to be the result of 
fixed heredity. It seems reasonable to consider it a result 
of a combination of these two factors. 

Concluding from experiments with Tilia amerlcans « 
Rose (56) believes that dormancy is to be looked upon as a 
condition of equilibrium in e series of complex chemical 
reactions; after-ripening as e displacement of this condi¬ 
tion.

Methods of Securing Dormancy 


Crocker (15) lists seven ways by which dormancy 
may be induced in seeds: (1) rudimentary embryos that 
must mature before germination can begin; (2) complete 
inhibition of water absorption; (5) mechanical resistance 
to the expansion of the embryo and seed contents by endos- 
in structures; (4) encasing structures interfering with 
oxygen absorption by the embryo and perhaps carbon dioxide 
elimination from It, resulting in the limitation of the 
processes dependent upon these; (5) © state of dormancy 
in the embryo itself or some organ of it; (6) combination 
of two or more of these; (7) assumption of secondary 
dormancy. 

As reviewed by Crocker.(17), Dr. Ohga, a Japanese 
worker, discovered old Indian lotus, Melumbo nueifera . seeds 
in a layer of peat about five feet below the surface of 
s naturally drained lake bed in Manchuria. Dr. Ohga con¬ 
cluded that these seeds war© several centuries old, but 
when the seed coots were broken and the seeds pie cad in 
water one hundred percent germination resulted. The seed 
coats were impervious to water so that the seeds remained 
dry and in such a condition the protoplasm of the embryo 
was stable enough to endure for centuries. 

Experiment© showed that the outer one-fifth of 
the thick seed coats were impervious to water. This 
































■

impervious layer was made up of the outer layer of cells 
(epidermis) and the outer half of the second or palisade 

layer. 

In Gymnoclsdus cllolce insoluble pectic aterials 
of the Malphigien layer of the seed coat were largely 
responsible for water exclusion (55). 

For small seeds Crocker (15) believes that the 
resistance to water absorption is due to the cuticle, and 
for larger seeds to the "light zone" of modified cellu¬ 
lose of the palisade layer. 

Hose (56) found that seeds of Bubus idaeus fail¬ 
ed to germinate when placed on a moist substratum. This 
was not due to ©n immature embryo, but by the high breaking 
strength of the endocerp. 

Miller (50) lists Tilis and Co toneester as seen a 
with a dormancy due to an immature embryo. An impervious 
seed coat and a dormant embryo were found to cause delayed 
gemination with Cotoneester ( 35). The results of experi¬ 
ments with Tills (56) showed that dormancy wasnot due to 
any property of the seed coat, although that structure may 
serve to lengthen the dormant period, but is to be ascrib¬ 
ed to conditions obtaining within the endosperm or the 
embryo or both. Barton (6) however, found that dormancy 
in Tills was due to an impervious seed coat and a dormant 
embryo. Spaeth (63) concluded that the effect of the 
nucellar membrane on oxygen intake was an important factor

in the dormancy of Til ie end the impermeability of the 
teste to moisture wee a factor in prolonging this dormancy, 

Crocker (16) noted that seeds of Cro tc egus 
mollis that ley in the soil for a year or more, germinated 
to some extent; while seeds stored in the dry for a 
similar period did not germinate at ell, although the tests 
were made with naked embryos as well as with seeds bearing 
the coats. He concluded that the necessary chan as to 
precede germination wore in the embryo itself rather than 
in the seed coat. Davis and Bose {£&)■ found that the 
cause of delay in Crataegus rollis was largely in the hypo- 
cotyl rather than in the cotyledons or any of the external 
structures* 

While the coat aax*vas as a protection against 
fungal attack end prevents water-imbibed seeds from ex¬ 
panding and rupturing the tissues before after-ripening is 
accomplished, it takes little or no part in the dormancy 
or after-ripening of the seed of Juniperns (64). 

Dormancy due to dormant embryos has been found 
in apple ( l , 57), Benzoin aestiyale (57), Cra t&eg/ua (16, 

£5, £7), Juniperus (54), Cornua , kambucus and Herberts (£0), 
and Tilia (56)• 

Although the seed coat may play a part in the 
dormancy of some of these seeds, a combination of an im¬ 
pervious seed coat and dormant embryo has been found to 
cause the dormancy of Cere.is canadensis (£}, Cotonesstar

(33), ithoaoty,>os knrrloldes (32 ) , Morbus aucaparla ( 29 ), 
by mphoricarpos racemosus (31), Tilts (6), and Wile plum l35)# 

It is rather generally observed that some seeds 
capable of immediate germination can be thrown into a 
secondary dormancy by a period in a gamine tor lacking 
some one condition necessary for germination, or involving 
a substance inhibiting gemination, or one hardening the 
colloids of the coat (15). 

In experiments with seeds of Borbus aucuparie , 
Fiemion (29) found that partially after-ripened seeds at 
1°C. end transferred to higher temperalures favorable for 
germination but not for after-ripening, developed a second¬ 
ary dormancy requiring a second after-ripening period 
usually longer then the original stratification period# 
Similar results have been reported with apple (3? j, Cornua 
florida (20), and Khodotypos karri aides (32)#. 


Breaking Dormancy 


The treatments that have been used to hasten the 
gemination of seeds are; stratification or placing seeds 
under favorable conditions for after-ripening, freezing 
and thawing, alternating temperatures, treatment with chemi¬ 
cals, scarification end removal of seed coats.

Stratification 

The term "stratification* (46) formerly applied 
to storing seeds in alternate layers with moist sand and 
subjecting them to cold, or more generally, freezing temper¬ 
atures. fiectsnt investigators have been mixing the seed 
thoroughly with the medium but the former term is still 
being used. 

Stratification (in the mixing way) (46) gives 
best results when moisture and air are properly regulated, 
no part of the medium being water logged or too dry. 

The best stratification temperature varies for 
different kinds of seeds, from, 53° f# to 50° F. or 55° F. 
end the time, from a month to nearly a. year. 

Kleinian, (29) when comparing peat moss, sand and 
muck as media for stratification of Sorbus aucuperle 1 seeds, 
found that peat moss gave the best results. Commercial 
granulated peat moss of pH about 4 proved to be superior 
to any other lots adjusted to other pH values. Feat moss 
has been used extensively by'other worker® as a stratifi¬ 
cation medium (5, 7, 18, 20, 31, 33, 57). 

The value of peat moss lies in the fact that it 
gives a. good air supply and at the same time holds a large 
reserve jf water (51)* 

For Tilis , Barton (6) found that acid and neutral 
granulated peat were equally effective as a stratification 

medium. 

In working with seeds of bayberry, Barton (7)

found that e mixture of one-third Boil, one-third sand, 
and one-third peat moss was an effective stratification 

medium* 

Joseph (45) used moist send, granulated peat, 
blotting paper end filter paper as media for after-ripen¬ 
ing birch seeds with equal effectiveness* 

Tem o era ture hffects 

For general nursery practice nngstrom and. 
Stoekler (28) recommend a stratification temperature of 
40°r. to be the best^? r fter-ripening. Davis (20) after 
extensive studies with Cornus fieri de found the best 
stratification temperature to be 40° F. Giersbach and 
Crocker (55) found 5° C. the best stratification tempera¬ 
ture for wild plums, as did Crocker and Barton (18) 
for apple, Jones (44) for the sugar maple, Joseph (45) 
for birch, end Pack (54) for junipers* 

Barton (7) found e stratification temperature 
of 10° C* best for bayberry as did Giersbach (55) for 
some species of Cotonesater * 

Du Preez (16) working with peach in South , friee 
found that a stratifleetion temperature of 40° F* for 45 
days was necessary for after-ripening. In Maryland, Haut 
(59) found that a temperature of 5° C* for 75 days was 
necessary to after-ripen peach, seeds* 

Haut (59) also found a temperature of 5° C. to 


be favorable for apple, cherry end pear, but a temperature 





















.

of l°to 8 ° C. was equally as good except that the time 
required v.es usually longer, however, germination some- 
times occurred in stratification at 8° G. which made it 
difficult to remove germinated seeds. 

Freezing and Thawing 

Dovis (20) concluded after experimenting with 
Cornus florida , that dry seeds are apparently uninjured, 
but ere not after-ripened at freezing temperatures.. Mois¬ 
ture is essential to after-ripening. Whenever Imbibed 
seeds of the species studied are exposed to temperatures 
below freezing long enough to freeze through,killing re¬ 
sults. Undercooling may occur In some cases, or the 
moisture content of the seed may fee so low that total kill¬ 
ing does not result when the sand or soil about the seed 
is frozen. Since the power of the seed colloids to hold 
water is tremendous, ice does not form .in the seed unless 
s relatively high moisture content has been attained. 

Freezing, or freezing and thawing are is®an® of 
forcing in nature and are of very great significance. 

With Crataegus , Crocker (15) found that low temperature 
but not freezing or freezing and thawing, hastens the 
after-ripening of the embryo. Evidence indicated that the 
beneficial effects of freezing are often through seed 
coat changes. 


Pack (54) states that freezing and thawing has

- is 


no forcing action on the germination of Juniper seeds, 
neither, does it hasten after-ripening. Exposure to 
-5° C. after seeds are ready to germinate will kill the 
seeds. This vas also found to be true by Davis (21). 

Although 7.5 per cent germination occurred 
with wild plum (55) when given weekly alternating temper¬ 
ature treatments of -15° and 5° C., ell non-germinating 
seeds decayed. 

Al te rne t i. n r Temp era ture s 

Seeds of Sorbus aucuparie (29) geminated equal¬ 
ly as veil when after-ripened ©t 1° or ©t weekly alternat¬ 
ing temperatures of 1° to -5° C. Apple seeds (18) behav¬ 
ed similarly except that an alternating temperature of 
5° to -10° c* was better. 

Marine g© (52) found that Berber!s seeds gave 
best results if pretreated at 5° C. before given an alter¬ 
nating temperature of 10° to 20° C. More varied require¬ 
ments were found necessary for the elderberry (21) which 
needed cold treatment for 100 days followed byylow alter¬ 
nating temperature of 48° to 58° F* for 17 hours per day, 
end a high alternating temperature of 70° to 85° JF. for 
7 hours. 

FI ©mi on (52) found that seeds of Khodotypoa 
kerrioides gave better results if a low temperature treat¬ 
ment was preceded by a high temperature of 25° or 50° C. 
for one month than if daily or weekly alternating tempera-

tures wore used* 

In working with Tllie seeds Bert on (6) found that 
two distinct treatments were essential for germination. 

The first was to treat the seeds et #0° C. in moist peat 
for four months which served to soften the seed coat; follow 
ed by a low temperature of 1° or 5° C. for five months. 
Similar effects of high and low temperature treatments have 
been recorded for Hale sis Carolina ^mclanehler 

canadensis (18), and some species of Cotonesster (55). In 
most oases it is not known whether sail organisms play a 
part or whether physical and chemical changes in the coats 
quite independent of the action of soil organisms prove 
effective. 

For root development a period at high temperatures 
is required by seed© of the Tree Peony (9) and Viburnum (SI) 
A followin * low temperature period is then necessary to 
efter-ripen the epicotyl before the ©hoot will develop. 

Giersbach and .Barton (.£4) .have shown that seeds 
of the silver bell llalesis Carolina after-ripened at low 
stratification temperatures and also at high temperatures* 
15°, fo° end £5° followed by low l°or 5° C. This latter 
condition paralleled outside condition© where seed©were 
given a high temperature period of one to three months at 
lh° to £7° o. prior to planting in mulched or board-cover¬ 
ed coldframes during the winter months.

of coldframes in Hover ber gave 56.5 per cent seedling pro¬ 
duction the following spring from the mulched frame as 
against 59 per cent from the board-covered frame and 5.5 
oer cent from the open frame. The open frame -eve a 
relatively short period of good after-ripening temperature 
end the board-covered frame stood intermediate, however, 
in the September planting, the mulched frame only pro¬ 
duced 4 per cent of seedling®, the reason being the 
period wan so lorn that many of the seeds geminated and 
the resulting seedlings were killed, under the mulch. 

£ ynphoricar p o s r& c eraosus seeds responded to a 
period at high temperature followed by low temperature 
(51). Thin was best brought about by planting in flats in 
the spring end pieced in coldframes with board covers the 
following fall* The high temperature during the summer was 
conducive to the decomposition of the seed coat by fungi 
and the subsequent cold winter months a ft er-ripened the 
embryos sufficiently so that germination occurred the 
following spring. 

Gclvroeder (57) and Barton (7) found /railchad or 
boa rd-covered coldframes to be equally effective while 
Barton (6) found mulched frames to give best results. 

W1th sem& thet reapond to low temporature 
stratification, fall planting in cold frames, mulched or 
otherwise, is a poor substitute for proper stratification 
in e cold cellar or refrigerator room (46 )»

Chemical ;ffects 

In testing Cotonet- ster divurice ta and C. hori¬ 
zontal is with concentrated sulfuric acid for Tj hours 
Giersbach (So) found that the need of the initial high 
temperature period in the soil for softening the seed 
coat was entirely displaced. Barton (6) found the same to 
be true for Tills emericana aa did Flemion (si) for 
Byipphoricarpos racemesus . 

The dormancy of hub us idaeus seeds (b6) visa can¬ 
to the high breaking strength of the endoeerp* the effect 
of which could be overcome by treating with concentrated 
sulfuric acid for 2 hours. 

Tukey and Carlson (68) overcame the dormancy in 
peach seeds by treatment with thiourea but dwarf seedlings 
resulted. 

Deuber (24) found that dormant seeds of the sugar 
end Norway maple could be best stimulated into gemination 
by using thiourea, and seeds of black and reel oak by using 

ethylene chlorohydrin. 

The after-ripening period can be greatly shorten¬ 
ed, the water-holding power, the acidity, and the amount 
of peroxidase increased, more rapidly, ©rid the oxidase ap¬ 
pears much earlier in seeds of Crataegus mollis (27) if the 
embryos are treated with dilute acids, HCh, butyric and 
acetic. 

A slight forcing effect ms observed of several 
acids, bases, end salts on air-dry seeds of hambucus (56). 





















’

Many fruits (46) soften their seeds by their own 
acids, also acids in the stomachs of birds end animals 
thet eat these fruits act similarly such as for barberry, 
cedar, cherry, mulberry. Vinegar aids the seeds of bramble 
fruits (blackberry and raspberry). 

After using several chemicals of different con- 
centrations for various periods, Fleaion concluded that no 
chemical could be found which would be effective in break- 
inf- the dormancy of Borbus 8ncuparla seeds (£9)• 

Hydrogen peroxide, mercuric chloride, ether, 
carbon dioxide, oxygen, light soil, dilute acids, dilute 
bases, .nitrates, sulfates, or strong acids had no effect 
on the germination of juniper seeds (54). 

Immersion in war® water and acid treatment© prov¬ 
ed unsuccessful for apple and pear seen© (S9). 

P o t a s s ium-na phtha 1 en©acetate had no effect with 
domestic apple and dyrus malus var . nl e d s w e t zkyana (10). 

The after-ripening period of Cereis canadensis 
was not influenced by treatment with Vit. (2). 

Effects of r.eniovlnp Fruit and Seed Coats 

Harrington and Hite (b7) found that the removal 
of the seed coat was of no benefit in after-ripening 

apple seeds. 

Seeds of wild plum (55) with the pericarps re¬ 
moved after-ripened and germinated more quickly at low 
temperatures than those with pericarp© intact, but the is ck

of the protection of the pericarp led to the decay of about 
half of the seeds. 

Excised embryos of Khodotypoa Kerrioldes (52) 
showed considerable development of the hypocotyl and ©pi- 
cot yl after 14 days on moist filter paper. When trans¬ 
ferred to soil these seedlings grew very slowly. Excised 
embryos after-ripen in eight weeks at low temperatures 
while germination of intact seeds does not occur until 
much later. In the experiments, a higher percentage of 
seedlings resulted when the coat was removed end germina¬ 
tion took place over a w ider temperature range. 

Seedlings can be obtained from freshly harvest¬ 
ed seeds of peach, apple, and hawthorn, which, normally re¬ 
require an after-ripening period of several months at low 
temperatures , by removing the outer hard coat and inner 
seed coat end placing the embryos under germination condi¬ 
tions. Such seedlings exhibit a very abnormal growth 
which may be described as dwarf-like in character. After 
some months, apparent normal growth begins. Experiments 
have shown that light is not the determining factor (50). 

Tukey (65) in experimenting with excised embryos 
of cherry, plum, peach, apricot, and apple has shown that 
embryos in culture do not pass through the embryonic 
stages characteristic of embryop on the mother plant. In¬ 
stead they enter at once into an independent development 
characteristic of the age of the embryo when excised. With

poach embryos, he obtained no development earlier then SI 
days of ere after full bloom, i* t 51 days he obtained 
spreading and greening of the cotyledons and small white 
epieotyiedonary leaves with progressive stages of develop¬ 
ment until et 116 days vigorous root end shoot growth was 
obtained but the plants were dwarfish. 

Dwarf plants when placed in subdued light at a 
low temperature developed normally after 50 days, 

Excised embryos of Ootoneester divaricate and 
C, horizon tails (55) v ere put in soil after two weeks on 
filter paper but growth was slow and stunted, and most of 
the seedlings were deed after 10 days, 

EL eraion (£9) had similar results with Sorbus 

aucuparis . 

Other Methods 

Dorsey (25) reports that Crook or found peach 
seeds to after-ripen best at about 41° f, when cracked, and 
41° to 50° f. with the stone intact. The after-ripening 
was found to take place in 55 to 60 days in the former, and 
in 60 to 100 days in the latter. 

For good results with peach seed Upshall (69) 
recommends planting the pits in the fall and cracking 
these in the following spring. 

Dormancy that .is due to hard or thickened coats

be absorbed (50). 

With Sorbus eucumi r 1 e, Flemion (29) found that 
subjecting seeds to high pressure, ultra-violet rays and 
electro-magnetic waves did not indue© germination. 

Chemical Changes During After-Ripening 


Pack (54) noted numerous changes during the after¬ 
ripening of yuniperns seeds. There was {1} a rather rapid 
and complete inhibition, followed by a steady slow decrease 
in water content until near germination; ( P.) increased II* 
ion concentration, ©specially of the embryo; (5) an 
increment of titrable acid; (4) a steady and. enormous in¬ 
crease in the degree of dispersion of the stored fat; 

(5) decrease in the amount of stored fat and protein, with 
an increase in eager content end the first appearance of 
starch; (6) the translocation of food in the form of 
fet or fatty acids from endosperm to embryo; (7) a 
seven-fold increase in the amino acid content, and a com¬ 
plete disappearance of histidine from the embryo; (8) a 
seven-fold increase in the respiratory rote; (9) and an 
increase in the respiratory quotient; (10) a decrease in 
intramolecular respiration; (11) e two-fold increase in 
catalase activity; (12) a slight growth of the embryo; 
end (15) » rise in vigor of the seeds as Indicated by 
their resistance to fungous attacks.

Eckerson (£7) observed increased acidity, water- 
holding power, and an increase in catalase a ad peroxidase 
in the after-ripening of Crataegus * lie believes that 
there was a correlation between acidity of the hypoootyl, 
its water-absorbing power, production of enzymes, and 
germinating power. 

Similar changes during after-ripening have been 
noted by Crocker end Harrington (19), ifevls (£0), XIamion 
(52), and Jones (44). 

Increased enzyme activity has been the most fre¬ 
quently observed change during after-ripening. Increased 
catalase activity has been noted by Afanasiev (2), Barton 
(6), Crocker and Harrington (19), Davis (£0), Heut (38), 

Ibarmen (43), Jones (44), and Loustalot (49), and in addi¬ 
tion mention (£9* 51, 52), has noted increased peroxidase 
activity, mention (29, 52) also has observed that at 
hi her temperatures which are unfavorable for after-ripen¬ 
ing, there is a slight reduction in enzyme activity. 

. There is some controversy over the relationship 
between catales© activity and after-ripening. Barton 
(6) and Flemlon (29) found ho absolute correlation between 
the. degree of catalase activity and the completion of 
after-ripening. Herat (38) reported that catalase activity 
of fruit seeds increased progressively until after-ripen¬ 
ing was complete . Davis (£0) and Xbeman (43) reported 
a similar relationship for seeds of dogwood, elder, bar-

berry end redbud. houstelot (49) observed a striking 
correlation between catalase activity and after-ripening 
of apple seeds, for with each increase in catalase 
activity there was a distinct rise in the percentage 
germination. 


Viability and Storage 


The capacity of the dry seed to retain vitality 
may be taken as an expression of its power to resist ex¬ 
treme conditions. Perfectly dry seeds can withstand not 
only the implied drought but also remarkable extremes in 
temperature (62). 

Since stored foods and enzymes are present al¬ 
most unchanged for some years after viability is lost, 
Crocker (15) suggests that loss of viability in seeds ap¬ 
proaching the air-dry condition is due to the slow denatur¬ 
ing, or coagulation, of certain protoplasmic proteins of 
the embryo. 

Seed© .of the river maple, hcer se c c h a r i mm (44) 
lose their viability when the water content is reduced to 
SO to £4 per cent. Temperature seems to play no part in 
determining the critical point of water loss. Higher 
temperatures only hasten the rate at which the point of 
desiccation is attained.

Seeds that will withstand thorough air drying or 
more excessive drying, ere improved in their retention of 

i 

vitality by lowering the water content to, or below, a 
certain critical point, by lowering the temperature of 
storage end by hermetically sealing if it is accompanied 
by sufficient drying (55). 

Steinbeuer end stoinbauer (64) in experimenting 
with elm seeds found that the more seeds vere desiccated, 
the higher wee the percentage of germination at any time, 
end the longer viability was retained. Barton (11) show¬ 
ed that elm seeds with a Bioisture content of seven per 
cent proved superior in germination capacity to those with 
eight per cent after storage in sealed containers at room 
temperature. 

Fiemion (29) found that seeds of £orbus aucu.pa.ria 
partially efter-ripen under ordinary dry.storage condi¬ 
tions so that the after-ripening and germination period 
required at 1° C. was somewhat shortened# 

Dry storage has ©Iso been found to be beneficial 
for Amelenchier canadensis and Rosa rugose (18), Symnhorl - 
cam os rocemosus (51), Betule. lent© (45), and i-yrion 
cerolinensis (7). On the other hand, loss of viability 
with air dry storage has been reported for ..,-etula Xu tea 
and B. papyrifere (45), apple (5), Rosa fault if lore and B» 
seti&ra (18), Serabuous canadensis (20) f ' op ulus (58), elm., 
river maple ©nd birch (44).

The cottonwood and willow (44) are usually 
cited as the classic examples of death due to desicca¬ 
tion shortly after seed fall* The cottonwood gives 
low percentage of germination and low seedling vigor 
after two weeks of desiccation in laboratory air, while 
after three weeks t fails to germinate when placed in the 
most favorable germ inative conditions. Moss (53) obtain¬ 
ed 100 per cent germination at the end of four weeks in 
the laboratory with seeds of aspen end balsam poplar. 

When stored over calcium chloride et -5° C# seeds of 
Russian poplar gave 70 per cent germination after two 
years. The optimum relative humidity for storage was 10 
per cent with a reduction in viability after an increase 
in relative humidity. 

Conditions above and below 25 per cant relative 

humidity were injurious to Symphor 1 carp os racemosus 

seeds (51). 

After two years of storage, seeds of lorbus 
aucuparia are just as viable as the freshly harvested 
seeds, whether stored sealed, unsealed, or in vacuum at 
temperatores from -8° C. to room temperature (29). stor¬ 
ed clean seeds and seeus from intact berries stored at 
low temperatures gave much better germination percent¬ 
ages than seeds from intact berries stored at high temper¬ 
atures.

content of th© seed (in sealed containers) ere more im~ 
portent then temperature, with most species# The opti¬ 
mum type of storage for ell seeds is a seeled container 
at q temperature below 5° C. The moisture content of the 
seed should be reduced to 5 to 8 par cent for best re¬ 
sults# 

Testing; Viability 

Tukey (66) has used the excised embryo m thod 
for determining the viability of peach seed# He found a 
close agreement between the excised erabryo method and fhe 
efter-ripening method* When all embryos were included 
which showed even minor degrees of response, the 
figures were comparable, indicating that all degrees of 
response must be included in determining percentage 
germinability. 

For testing viability of coniferous seen, Kelt 
and Eliason (40) recommend the cutting test in conjunc¬ 
tion with s germination test. 

Davis (22) sites examples of testing viability 
as; the electrical current method, conductivity, tempera¬ 
ture and discoloration of potassium carbonate methods# In 
using catalase as a means for determining viability, 

Davis found that catalase activity of dead seeds was 
sufficiently high at times to indicate fair germination.

However, a comparison between the catalase activity of dry 
end soaked seed was a reliable method as e considerable 
reduction in catalase activity of soaked seed indicated 
poor quality. 


Seed Injury and Variability 

Durin the extraction of coniferous seed,! njury 
or death may result from excessive heat, humidity, or 
mechanical action (40). 

Devis (21) experienced a high percentage of kill 
in, due to bacterial end fungal infection when seeds were 
stored in the pulp in a moist condition. Iain® and 
iVicQuesten (46) report similar results when fossceous seeds 
are handled end shipped in the fruits. 

Peach seed was injured if allowed to remain in 
fermented juice for 7 days or in rotting pulp for 10 
days (59). Apple seed taken from the pomace at a cider 
mill after going through th© cutters and ores® showed 
visible injury and gave poor* germination (18). 

Barton (8) found that different seed lots vary 
both, in initial germination capacity end in keeping 
quality, under various conditions. 

Isolated trees of Corpus floride frequently 
had 90 to 100 per cent empty seeds (21).

Carlson end Tukey (12) and DuPreez (26) found 
various varieties of peaches to behave differently to 
e f t e r-r i pen ing tree tment s . 

Differences in the behavior of various species 
to treatments have been reported by several workers (11, 
, 45 , 55 ) • 


Germination 


Water and oxygen supply, and temperature are 
most important for subsequent germination when the seed 
is finally conditioned for germination (62). In addi¬ 
tion, lieit and li* son (40) list light, as an important 
factor in the germination of some conifers. 

The optimum germination temperature varies 
with the type of seed. Barrington and Bite (&?) found 
10° to 20° C. beet for apple, while the optimum tempera¬ 
ture for. junioerus (54) and peach (59) is 5°C. High 
germination temperatures forced seed© of 5ambucus into 
secondary dormancy (20). 

While daylight is essential for complete 
germination with so • • elec inus (40), Crocker (14) 

reports that in no other field of plant physiology is 
there es much disagreement in results as in the effect 
of light upon germination.

Afanasiev (2) obtained increased germination 
with n ercis cam, be ns Is by holding after-ripanad seed in 
pure oxygen for £4 to 48 hour© prior to planting. 

Barton (10) obtained increased germination 
with elm seed by pre-treating with potassium-naphthalene- 
acetate but pre-soaking and cold temperature treatments 
were more effective. 

Scott and Waugh (58) associated slow seedling 
emergence with incomplete after-ripening. They used a 
sand-muck mixture for best results with after-ripening 

end germination. 

Successful practical germination -of seed fre¬ 
quently depends upon security of a proper balance between 
(a) maintenance of adequate moisture and (b) avoidance 
of fungal diseases. To obtain the desired results Close 
(15) recommends live sphagnum, the springiness of which 
is more beneficial to germination than the lack of this 
characteristic in dead sphagnum.or peat. 

Judged purely from thj standpoint of damping- 
off, sphagnum ms greatly superior to el ther soil or 
sand (41).

MATERIALS MW METHODS' 


Seeds used in the experiments ware Tor the most 
part ra< from specimens of nu live, and other har4y 

ornamental trees and shrubs in Edmontoit and vicinity, al¬ 
though in 1945 nineteen lots of seeds were purchased from 
Herbst Brothers, New York* Samples of hrunus jeponies 
8nd .. . sinioni were obtained from Strathmore. In 1946, 
several lots of seeds were gathered from cultivated speci¬ 
mens a t the La comb e nape r irnentel Station, op 

Nurseries and Stettier, Alberta*. All material® used in 
this study, together with such pertinent data as source, 
dates of gathering, and type of fruit, are listed in the 
Appendix* 

Immediately upon gathering, fleshy fruits were 
crushed and vigorously stirred in water. This process 
separates the seed and pulp and is also an excellent 
method for quickly testing seed viability. The pulp and 
non-viable seed which is largely made up of empty seed 
coats will float, while the plump, viable seed will sink 
to the bottom of the vessel. This process was repeated 
three or four times to ensure as large a quantity of good 
seed as possible. 

After separation and cleaning were completed, 
the seeds were spread out on newspapers and dried at room 
temperature. Kon-fleshy materiel was also dried in the 


























/ 









' 

. 







above menner end seeds were seperatea from the fruits, 
where feasible. V hen drying was completed, the seeds 
were placed in closed glass viols or paper corit iners, 
depending upon the quantity of seed. They were then 
•stored at room temperature (approximately 65° to 70°F.) 
until the experiments were begun. 

Before subjecting seeds to the various treat¬ 
ments employed, they were tested for germlnebiiity, by 
sowing in © 50-50 sand and peat mixture, in flats in a 
cool greenhouse. Control lots of seeds treated for expert 
mental purposes were also sown in flats in the cool green¬ 
house, By beginning the experiments before results of 
the preliminary germination tests were known, it wea 
possible to note adverse effects of stratification, if 
any, upon seeds thatnorra&lly will -germinate without pre- 
trea tment. 

For stratification purposes, peat moss of pH 
about 5.5 was obtained locally, granulated, and soaked in 
water with excess water being squeezed out by hand before 
using* Preliminary stratification tests involved m ixing 
the seed thoroughly with the peat, packing loosely in 
open vials, and watering at weekly intervals if found 
necessary. The same method was used in later tests, ex¬ 
cept that larger, open-mouthed 4 ounce jars were employ¬ 
ed* Tests were carried out in a root cellar at a fairly 
constant temperature 58°F«, end in a refrigerator which 






.

' 









maintained a fluctuating temperature of i>o° to 59° F., 
with the lower temperature predominating* 

For scarification teats, seed costs were cither 
filed or nicked with e sharp knife point, care being 
taken not to file or cut too deeply, ao as to cause in¬ 
jury to the embryo* where acids were used, seeds were 
soaked in the acids for the time allotted, removed and 
thoroughly we sired in running water, but were not dried 
before stratifying or sowing in flats. 

Gemination tests were undertaken at periodic 
intervals, the methods employed for the 1945 tests be¬ 
ing similar to those previously described. In the 1946 
tests, seeds were germinated on moist filter paper in 
petri dishes in a warm greenhouse. The latter m thod was 
found to be more convenient and gave much quicker results 
than the former. Seeds being tasted for gemination in 
petri dishes war© more subject to fungus growth, but 
damage was usually negligible since all tests were dis¬ 
carded after two weeks if there was no indication of 
germination by that time* 

Ho attempt was made to find the effects of 
light, if sny, on germination, and while cleanliness wae 
practised es much as possible, no specific attempt was 
made to maintain sterile conditions. However, where 
fungus growth was noticed upon seeds in the stratifica¬ 
tion medium, they were often removed from the medium, 
cleaned and replaced in fresh material.

TESTS VvITH 1945 t'KBBB 


Test 1 

-after © period of dry storage at room tempera¬ 
ture, thirty-one species were used in order to determine 
(1) the after-ripening period of these seeds; and (2) 
tempareture affects upon the after-ripening period. The 
effects of scarification upon the ©fter-ripening period 
of twenty-five of these species also ms studied. 

Seeds were stratified in open glass vials et a 
temperature of 51° to 59° F. in the refrigerator and a 
constant temperature of 56° ?. in the root cellar, fifty 
seeds were used in each lot, ten seeds being tested for 
germination et intervals of 0, 50, 60, 100 and 140 days. 

The file and knife methods mere used for scarification. 

At no time were the seeds allowed to 'become dry. 

Results 

The results of this test ©re reported in Tables 

I end II. 

Bata for the after-ripening requirementa of 28 

species has been obtained. 

Three species, Crataegus so .. Jun1aerun vliginiana . 
end Prunus pensylvanica » failed to respond to any of the 
treatments even after nearly five months of stratification.

ed to soarific&tion treatment while I£ of the control lota

under referi orator conditions, 10 lots responds to scari¬ 
fication as against 15 of the controls. Also In the 
refrigerator, 7 of the control lots after-ripened sooner 
then the scarified seeds, except in 5 cases when the scari¬ 
fied lots responded more quickly. 

It was generally observed, throughout the experi¬ 
ment, that when fungus growth occurred, it was invariably 
the scarified seeds that were affected. Although geruina¬ 
tion percentages ware not noticeably Influenced, this 
could be a factor in the failure of scarification to bene¬ 
fit seeds requiring fairly long after-ripening periods* 

Refrigerator temperatures ner® favorable for the 
after-ripening of 14 species end 6 of these responded to 
a shorter stratification period than did those in the root 
cellar. On the other hand, 17 species after-ripened in 
the root cellar with § of there requiring a shorter period 
than those in the refrigerator. The scarified lots of 
Cotoneaster acutlfolla and C» lntegerrina . and the check lot of 
Symph or 1 cargos extras p&uciflorus after-ripened in the root 
cellar in 140 days, while the earn® lota in the refrigerator 
failed to respond to any treatment* While still In strati¬ 
fication in the root cellar, -9 lota of seeds gave some 
germination, while only I lot geminated in the refrigerator*

Results 

No seeds germinated in the check teat, but all lots 
responded to refrigerator conditions after 50 days. Only 
Betula papyrifers and ■ hysocarpus opulifolius seeds germinat¬ 
ed after 50 days in the root cellar. No germination was ob¬ 
tained after 60 or 80 days stratification.

Test 2 


After a pcriod of dry storage at room temperature 
for 6 to 8 months, the same species as In Test 1 were 
used to find: (1) the effect of dry storage on the germin- 
ability of these seeds; (2) the effect of £0 days low 
temperature stratification; (b) the effect of an extended 
period of warm moist conditions following the low tempera¬ 
ture treatment; and (4) the effect of scarification. 

Forty seeds of each species were used, twenty be¬ 
ing scarified - employing the same methods as before. Ten 
seeds of each lot ?*ere used in a preliminary germination 
test and the remainder planted in flats in the greenhouse 
after the 50 day low temperature treatment# Since this 
test was run in the spring of 1946, the root cellar temper¬ 
ature was too high for after ripening purposes, so that 
the refrigerator supplied the only condition. Seeds were 
stratified in open glass vials as before. 

Unfortunately, the flats containing the scarified 
seeds, which had been stratified, were accidently discarded 
sometime during the fall so that final results involve the 
control lots only. 

Besults 

The results of this test are reported in Table 
III, and these indicate that the prolonged period of dry 
storage had little effect upon the viability of Gsraga-ns

effective as an after-ripening procedure. Presumably 
those that did not germinate immediately after dry storage 
had not completed the cycle necessary for aftor-ripening. 

It appears that seeds of rix .urloina lose 
their viability after long periods of dry storage, since 
no germination was obtained in any-of the tests. 

The 50 day stratification period was more than 
that required by eleven species as indicated by lest 1. 

In Test 2, six of these gave lower percentages of germina¬ 
tion, in comparison with the earlier test, while two gave 
higher percentages and three remained approximately the 
seme.

tion in Test 1 end after 50 days in Test 2* These r@sul.ts 
indicate that after-ripening was partially completed during 
the additional period of dry storage with a few seeds of 

these species# 

Five species, ( Fear ginnala . Fraxinus pennsylvanica 
lanceolate , ices mariena , Pru ; *us pe ns y i vs nice and 
tom ntosa ) f germinated to some extent after GO days strati¬ 
fication in Test 1 and after 50 days in Test 2. Apparently

It is of interest to note that scarification 
was again specific as to the species benefitted, and that 
the responses to this treatment were the seme in both 

tests. 

Of the species that gave some germination after 
the 50 days of stratification, only five, ( /oaelanchler 
clnifolia , Lonicera tatarica , /runus pumlla * h* tomentosa 
and Hibes nigrum ). gave increased germination by the time 
the test was concluded* The results of Test 1 indicated 
that the necessary stratification period' was 00 days or 
more for all except Lonlcera tatarica * 

Five species, ( Coton©aster teutifolia » C* integer- * 
ri. yji » Crataegus sp *, Sorb us aucupferle and Symphoricerpos 
albus paucifloras ). failed to show signs of germination 
after the 50 days stratification, or after the summer 
period* They did however germinate to some extant after 
the winter period in the cool greenhouse* 

Test 5 

Lfter a period of dry storage at room tempera¬ 
ture for nine to twelve months, twenty-seven species were 
subjected to trials designed to determine: (1) the effect 

an 

of/extended period of dry storage on the genuinetion re¬ 
quirements of these seeds; and { 2) the effects of scarifi¬ 
cation. The seme species as in Test 1 were used except

and Prunus pensylvan1ca were discontinued because of 
an insufficient number of seeds* The methods employed 
were the same as in Test 1, except that the root cellar 
temperature was too high for after•ripening purposes 
and was not used* Germination tests were conducted 
after 0, 30, 60, 100 and 180 days of low temperature 
stra tifice tion* 

Results 

The results of this tost are summarized in 
Table IV, wherein it will be noted that no gemination 
was obtained from seed© of Creteeras sp* * Juniperus 
vir is ns * L&rix lericina * Lamb uc u s re c exaosus * Sorbsr la 
sorbifoXie and £ymphoriearpos a lb us nsuciflorae * Control

end control and scarified lots of i,cer nepundo and 
Rhemnus cathartics v. pubescens germinated without 
stratification* 

Scarification w be of no benefit in breaking 
the seed dormancy of ^cnr ginnsls , Fraxinus peanaylVenice 
lanceolate , rices iiariana , . run us numila * K ibes nigrum 
or Lor bus eucuparle * and although there was ten per cent 
germination with scarified seeds of ^.cer nap undo with no 
stratification, no gemination was obtained after periods 
of 30, 60 end 100 days stratification, at which time the 
tests for Acer ©pp# were terminated*

The only seeds which were favored, by scarifi- 
tion were those of Cot oneasier a c a tifolla end £• 
inter errlir.e , end with these 100 per cent gemination was 
obtained after 180 days stratification* At this time some 
seeds had germinated while in stratification indicating 
that after-ripening had been completed before the termina¬ 
tion of this period. The control seed lots of Acer glnraala 
end mnelanchier elnifolia gave some germination in the 
refrigerator, es also did scarified seed of Cotonesster spp. 
Germination was not obtained with .rices mar lane seeds with¬ 
out a period of low temperature treatment, but in general, 
results indicate that after-ripening was completed sooner 
than in Test 1, and although gemination was obtained 
without protreatment in Test B, this effect was not observ¬ 
ed in Test 5. 

Fungus growth was quite prevalent among the 
seeds of this experiment and especially so with the scari¬ 
fied lots. Severe! seeds of Acer ginnela . Fraxinus pennsyl - 
vanica lanceolate , harix Is r joint* . lioea mar lane and Hhamnus 
cethertica v. du deepens had rotted after SO days stratifi¬ 
cation while the other species were riot so noticeably 
effected. 

The extended period of dry storage generally re¬ 
sulted in longer stratification periods necessary to com¬ 
plete after-ripening and to bring about germination*

obtained with l>oD.ulus._i?etro.B.^yan£ . **n& jjte, 

americ&ns f which were subjected to tests as soon a© gathered. 
Sees 3 of these three species were divided into two lots, one 
of which was held at room temperature and the other stored 
in the refrigerator, with germination tests being made on 
moist blotters at periodic intervals. 

3 - 

Populus seeds germinated 100 per cent at one and 
nine days after collecting, but after 14 days in dry stor¬ 
age at room temperature, these seeds began to lose viability 
and at 5£ days no germination was obtained. On the other 
hand., seeds from the same lot that were stored in the re¬ 
frigerator germinated 84 per cent after 98 days, when tests 
were concluded because of a shortage of seed supply. Similar 
•results were ootsined with seeds of Sallx bebhis ms except 
that Nfter 55 days no germination was obtained with seeds 
stored at room temperature, while seeds from the refrigerator 
gave 50 per cent germination. No germination- was obtained 
after 45 days cold temperature storage. 

Seeds of Ulmus emeriesn& were tested for germina¬ 
tion at weekly intervals for two months after gathering, 
rood germination was obtained in all tests with little differ 
once between seeds stored in the refrigerator and at room 
temperature. Further tests with this genus were not conduct¬ 
ed*

TESTS iv I TO 1946 SEEDS 

Test 4 

Eighty-five species end varieties, including seeds 
purchased front Herbst Brothers, were used to determine the 
optimum stratification period, if ©ny were necessary, to 
complete the after-ripening of these seed© and to bring ©- 
bout germination. Five species of Prunus were used to com¬ 
pare the effects of low temperature stratification on seed© 
witi endocarps intact, endocarps scarified, and andooerps 
removed* 

In addition to the low temperature treatment, 
seeds of three species of Viburnum were storea in a moist 
medium for 80 days at high temperatures, before being 
subjected to refrigerator conditions* 

All seeds were stratified in the refrigerator 
in open, wide-mouthed, 4 ounce jars. Tests for germina¬ 
tion were made at 0, 50, and successive 10 day intervals 
until germination occurred, or until the teste were dis¬ 
continued. The seeds were said to be after-ripened when 
50 per cent or more germination was obtained, or until two 
or three subsequent teats showed no marked increase in 
germination. Each germination test was conducted with 
five or ten seeds, depending upon-the quantity, on moist 
filter paper in .petri dishes in a w#rm ■ reenhouse, and. 
the germination tests for seeds without pretreatment were 
were made by sowing 10 seeds of each species in soil in

the warm greenhouse# 

Seeds of lots which germinated in the SO day 
test were restratified end tested for germination at five 
day intervals, end successful germination tests were 
verified by sowing the remaining seeds in flats in the 
cooL greenhouse* 

Results 

The results of this test are reported in Tables 
V and VI# The former table indicates those seeds that 
. emine ted while being stratified, and also those lota 
that were discontinued because of rotting, lack of seed®, 
lack of time, and the nature of germination obtained in 
the verification tests* 

Thirty-one species and varieties germinated after 
SO days stratification* Of these, seven gave some germin¬ 
ation without the low temperature treatment and £1 species 
showed no signs of gemination at the conclusion of the 
tests in March 1947* Several lots of seeds rotted before 
showing sign® of germination, and it is of interest to 
not© that all lots of this group were seeds purchased from 
a commercial source and which had been kept in dry storage 
for eight to ten months* 

Of the seeds that germinated without pretreat¬ 
ment, only two, Kha mnus c a t i a r t i ca and r 1 ns © p i a si nan sis * 
were adversely affected by stratification* Khamnus

systems, but there w©s no sign of shoot growth. There 
were many seeds which had Just begun to develop roots 
ufter ISO days and many more which showed uo development of 
eny nature. Seeds removed to the refrigerator after 60 
days of high temperatures showed no further growth until 
after 60 deys of low temperatures when the first signs 
of shoot development appeared. Seeds subjected only to 
the low temperatures, remained unchanged after 140 days 
of stratification. ? 1 burn uni 1 a n ta m and V. trllobum did 

not respond to any of the treatments. 

Figures £ and 5 show the effect© of scarifica¬ 
tion end removal of the endocarp© of i : runus rlandalosa and 
P. jroonica respectively after 80 days stratification. 

From table V it is seen that seed© o f ?. glenflu- 
Xo©£ began to germinate after 50 deys a treti.fi cat ion, 
scarified pits after 40 days and the control lots after 80 
deys. The germination percentages of scarified fruits at 
60, 60, 70 and 80 deys closely parallel that of the seeds 
for those periods. P. pumlla seeds (endocarps removed) 
germinated after 40 days, scarified pita after 60 days and 
intact pits after 60 day© of stratification* Both seeds 
end scarified pits of P. tomentose germinated after 80 day® 
and intact pits after 60 days of stratification. All lots 
of r . japonic© geminated after 60 days stratification.

decay of seeds end scarified pits was obtained before 
germination was satisfactory. Pembina plum gave no re¬ 
sults with any lots even after 100 days stratification. 

One pf the serious drawbacks of stratifying 
naked seeds is shown by the amount of fungus growth on 
the cotyledons of one of the seeds in Figure 2, and in 
this figure, the letter T, C’* indicates the unevenness 
with which individual seeds of a ©ingle species respond, 
to treatment. 

Tests 

Previous results showed that a long period of 
warn moist conditions followed by a period at low tempera¬ 
ture, was influential in bringing about gemination of 
Got o net - ster a cut! folia and Crataegus ap, seeds. An attempt 
was made in this teat to replace the warm temperature 
period by treating Beads with concentrated sulfuric acid. 

Besides two spades of Cotoneaster ; C. aoatifoiia 
and C. integerrima « and one of Crataegus (species unknown), 

■ ■rinsania sinensis and nretostanhylos uvs-urs 1 were used, 
and seeds of these plants v ere soaked in concentre tad 
sulfuric acid for periods of 1, 2, & and 4 hours. They 
were then washed thoroughly and stratified with control lots 
in 4 oz. jars in the reTrip eretor.

Germination tests ere made at 40, 60, BO arid 
100 days. Time did not allow further tests to be made. 

Results 

Only one species, Cotstar I n teperrime re¬ 
sponded to the acid treatments. After 60 days of strati¬ 
fication germination was obtained with the 2 and 4 hour 
lots. After BO days all lots except those that were not 
treated with acid gave some germination, and this is 
illustrated in Figure 4. The 2 hour acid treatment gave 
the best results with the 1 end 5 hour treatments about 
equal* Although the 4 hour treatment gave 40 per cent 
germination after 60 days, only 10 per cent was obtained 
after 80 days. 

The results of Test 4 show that 130 days of low 
temperature stratification was insufficient to bring 
about germination of 0, integerrime . while acid treatment 
brought about gemination after 60 days stratification. 
This is an interesting indication that chemical treatment 
of seeds can be used to shorten the after-ripening 
period with at least one valuebid ornamental shrub.

means of their catalase activity* The prime object was to 
find a vmy in which this method could be used to determine 
the time at which any riven lot of seed was ready for 
germination* 

Catalase activity was estimated by the amount of 
oxygen produced from a given amount of hydrogen peroxide 
with a given amount of material after a definite period 
of time, and the apparatus is illustrated in f igure 5. It 
is in principle a modification of that described by 
jppieman (5). 

The species used in the tests were ^eer no gun do , 

/-•m or chs f r ,it.i co m. , ha Ins va r. Columbia, Inus mngo m ugh us 
and Ryrus ussuriensig . The fruits of Amorpha fruiticosa 
were le ft intact but in all other cases seeds only were 
used. The chemical used was the 20 volume commercial 
hydrogen peroxide of the Toronto Pharmacal Company Limited. 

In all cases 1.5 grams of material was ground 
to e fine mash in a mortar and washed into the flask 1 
(Fig. 5) with 10 c.c. of water in which was a suspension 
of CeCO^ . A five c.c. volume of H^Og was neutralized 
with K&GE, using phenolphthelein as the indicator, and 
this was placed in the separatory funnel E. The water 
levels of tubes a and B were equalized at the zero me rk and 
the apparatus closed. The H o 0r> was passed into the flask 
which was then agitated by hand. Readings ?>8re taken in the gas

4, 5 and 10 minute periods* At all times the room 
temperature was maintained at 64° F* 

The seeds used for testing were stratified in 
the refrigerator, the tests being made at five day inter* 
mis beginning with non-stratilled material* Correspond¬

The results are reported in Tables VI l to II 
inclusive. Bar diagrams drawn for the ten minute 

results and are reported in Figures 7 to 11 inclusive, the 
results obtained with Aoer neaundo are depicted graphical¬ 
ly in Figure 6. 

H© close correlation between aftar-ripening 
end ©atalas© activity was found for thee® seeds. 

Marked increases in catalase activity were ob¬ 
tained after 55 days stratification with Amorpha fruit1- 
cose and Uslua v., ©rid after 50 days with inus iaugro mughus 
and yrus ussuriensig . Seeds of all four had begun to 
germinate while in the stratification conditions, and 
germination results indicated that after-ripening had 
been completed before these last tests were made.

than were the previous results, no gemination wa& obtain¬ 
ed in either case. In doth cases the activity for these 
periods was nearly as- great as nhen 100 per cent germina¬ 
tion was obtained. 

With Firms mugo zaughus and . yrus ussuriensis there 
was an initial decrease in activity followed by varying 
increases. With the other species there were initial in¬ 
creases followed by more widely fluctuating catalase activ¬ 
ity. 

From the bar diagrams, it is seen that there are 
trends towards increased catalase activity and completeness

of after-ripening. Species \ory tremendously in their

Dry storage at room temperature for substantial 
periods was found to be of no harm to seed viability# 

The results with lanbucus racemosus offer the only ex¬ 
ception to this statement and even here, it la a ease of 
forced dormancy rather than loss of viability. After 87 
days of storage, gemination was obtained only when the 
seeds were subjected^240 days of low temperature stratifi¬ 
cation# o germination ms obtained after longer periods 
of dry storage. Bose (56) obtained fair gemination with 
freshly harvested seeds, but even after 2 days of drying, 
germination was delayed two weeks. Davis { 20 ) observed 
that any lot of Gambucufc racemosus seed contained some 
dormant seeds which required 100 days stratification to 
efter-ripen, and others which would geminate immediately.

by fungus after more than a yt i.r of dry storage. It is 
possible that susceptibility to fungus growth, Inc eased 
v. ith a decrease in viability during this excessive 
period in dry storage* 

The tests in 194b showed that dry storage of 
iunelanc 1er alnifolia seeds greatly decreased the period 
of stratification necessary to bring about germination. 
After 95 days of dry storage, the required stratifica¬ 
tion period was'60 days. The 1946 tests verified these 
results. On the other hand, Hargrave (56) recommended 
a stratification period of POO days for fresh seeds of 
the same species* Crocker and Barton (18) reoow@ad, 
four months of stratification for fresh seeds of /:.* 
canadensis * It is obvious from these results that not only 
do variations occur within and between species, and perhaps 
with environment, but great variations may occur when the 
methods of handling the seed differ to any marked extent. 

The after-ripening process must take piece with 
Amelanchier slnifolla seeds evert in dry storage* Since 
155 days elapsed between the time of gathering and germin** 
ation, and since Hargrave found 200 days necessary for 
the same period, it can be concluded that a ft ex-ripening 
takes place more quickly,during the period immediately 
following harvesting,In dry storage, than it does in 
stratification. The results of Tests .1 and 5, however, 
show that prolonged periods of dry storage may have a re- 











































. 


























, 


. 











terding effect on the after-ripening process, since 100 
days of stratification jfter ICO days storage were re¬ 
quired for germination to take place, as compared to 60 
days stratification after 95 days storage. 

The best treatment for Cotoneaster a cut!folia . 
Crataegu s Bp* and 6ymph or 1 carnos a 1 bus paucif 1 o rus seed 
was found to be a long period of warm moist conditions 
followed by a period of cold moist conditions. Ciersboch 
(16) obtained similar results with Dotonaestar horizon ** 
tails . The initial period of high temperatures serves 
to disintegrate the seed coats sufficiently to allow 
adequate moisture to be absorbed by the embryo and this 
condition, together with low temperature and adequate sera 
tion, is sufficient to bring about after-ripening. She 
also obtained good results by tree ting seeds i th sulfuric 
acid for 1.5 hours, followed by 100 days stratification. 

The results reported herein substantiate those of 
Giersbech. However, she found that six months of stretif1 
cation was necessary to after-ripen the embryo of Coton ¬ 
es star , canadensis T whereas the 1945 results show a maximum 
low temperature period of < months for C» a cut!folia . 
Dormancy in these seeds is due to e dormant embryo and a 
hard impermeable seed coat which must be softened or in 
some way be made permeable before low temperature strati¬ 
fication will be effective in bringing about gemination.

The induced continuation of dormancy by the hard seed coat, 
appears to be a physical effect that is independent of the 
true "after-ripening" period. 

Three species of Oornus required from 50 to 70 
days stratification for good gemination. Davis (£1) re- 
orte 1£0 days necessary for Cornus fierida . This differ¬ 
ence in results is probably due more to a difference in 
species then treatments or environment, since Cornua IIorIda 
is native to eastern and southern United States and 
Mexico (4). 

The 1946 results showed rather conclusively, 
that seeds of Khamnus c athar11 ca and Prinsspia sinensis 
were forced into dormancy by stratification. Vo other 
such cases were found. In 1945, however, Bheamus ,ee.thar- 
tica v. pubescens gave varying results depending upon the 
treatment. A reasonable explanation for this behavior 
with species of Bhcmnus cannot be made without further 
study* 

The results with apple seeds indicated that a 
stratification period of 50 days for all varieties was 
necessary after the fruits had been stored at 56° F* for 
approximately one month, followed by 50 days dry storage. 

A later test with unstratified Patten Greening seeds (not 
shown in results) gave 50 per cent germination after the 
fruits had been stored 4^ months. That a proportion of 
seeds may partially, or wholly, efter-ripen while in the

fruits in cold storage is apparent, lost authors (18 f SB, 
57, 42, 46) recommend 60 to 76 days stratification for 
apple seeds. Columbia crabapple seeds used in the catal¬ 
ase determinations still geminated vigorously after 50 
days dry storage. It seems therefore, that dry storage 
does not influence the after-ripening period of apple seeds, 
as much as cold storage in the fruits. In order to have 
after-ripened 50 to 40 days prior to stratification, the 
apple seeds tested must have partially after-ripened; 

(1) in the fruits in cold storage, (2) in the fruits while 
on the trees during September and October, (5) while in 
dry storage, or (4) there may be an unexplained environ¬ 
mental effect. It is possible that a combination of these 
factors is influential. This problem is worthy of further 
investigation* 

Although Viburnum lent a go responded to treat¬ 
ment, no results were obtained with V. Ian tana, or V, 
trilobum . Hargrave (56) recommends the 60 day high and 
60 day low temperature treatment for Viburnum , but mention© 
no species, Davis (21) had success with V. op ulus . It is 
obvious from these results that species of this genus vary 
considerably in their response to treatment. 

The results of Test 4 with Prunus glanduloea 
show that the embryo is dormant and requires approximately 
60 days of low temperature stratification to after-rlpen. 

The endocerp by means of mechanical resistance is re-

sponsible for delaying dormancy 10 days* end by exclusion 
of moisture and air, is responsible for an additional de¬ 
lay of 40 deys before dormancy is broken* The embryo of 
P, pumila is also dormant and requires 40 deys to after- 
ripen* The endocarp adds 20 days to th© dormant period, 

10 by mechanical resistance and 10 due to its impermeable 
nature. The embryo of P. t orient os© requires 50 day© to 
after-ripen but the only role played in dormancy by the 
endocarp appears to be a mechanical resistance to the 
extension of the embryo, for a 10-day period. P. japonic© 
embryos require 50 deys to after-ripen, but the seed endo¬ 
carp plays no role in dormancy* In relation to the cases 
previously mentioned, the embryo of Pembina plum is 
dormant for an exceptionally long period, but what after¬ 
ripening period is required, or what role the endocarp 
plays in dormancy has not as yet been determined. It is 
apparent from the result© obtained with genus Prunus that 
the dormancy of the embryo and the endocarp characteristics, 
vary with the species. 

The results with eetaleee tests showed no clear 
correlation between its activity and the stage of after- 
ripening. There were however, consistent and consider¬ 
able increases between non-after-ripened seed© end after- 
ripened seeds. Once a value for dry seed© of a given 
species had been established, catalase might mil be used

es a measure of viability. There ere several sources for 
error in determining catalase activity in seeds. These 
may be; acidity of material, rate of agitation, tempera¬ 
ture, and decree of fineness of material, although all 
these factors were under control to a certain extent, 
nevertheless, the fineness of the ground material may be 
a large source of error, as this was the most difficult 
to control with the methods employed. Crocker and 
Herrington (19), in working with Johnson grass seed, ob¬ 
tained a difference in catalase activity after 10 minutes, 
of 6.9 c.c. oxygen between 200-mesh and 70-mesh ground 
me terial. 

There is considerable biological significance 
in the behavior of seeds towards various treatments* By 
having protective seed coats end dormant embryos which 
respond only to specific treatments, the perpetuation of 
each individual species is ensured. It is therefore 
necessary even under controlled conditions to subject 
each individual species to specific treatments in order 
to obtain good results. This fact eaanot be overman- 
phasized in reporting results and making recommendations*

1* Kesults for the gemination requirement© of 
eighty suedes end varieties of trees and shrubs have been 
obtained# 

2* Eighty-four per cent of these species and 
varieties responded readily to low temperature stratifica¬ 
tion# 

5# Stratification in open mouthed bottles in 
a refrigerator is a convenient method for after-ripening 

most seeds. 

4. If physical characters of fruits are taken 
as a criterion for seed maturity, the time of seed 
gathering has little influence on subsequent germination# 

5# Geographic origin and variety differences 
play little pert in seed germination. 

6. Methods of handling and seed treatments are 
very important in seed germination requirements# 

7# The shorter the necessary period of strati¬ 
fication is, for after-ripening, the more practical is 
the method# 

8# Variations among species and genera are 

very important in seed germination requirements.

9* Different stretification temperatures are 
influential only in specific cases. 

10. Scarification is of benefit only in specific 
cases, particularly in hard-coated seeds such as are 
found in irunus . Crataegue . and Cotoneaster . 

11. There is no apparent correlation between 
catalase activity and after-ripening* 

18. Catalase activity offers some value as a 
measure of viability.
