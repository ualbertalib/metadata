CHAPTER 1 


THE PURPOSES OF THE INVESTIGATION 

To use the results of the annual Departmental 
examinations in Grade Twelve solely as a basis of 
selection recognizes hut one of the several uses of 
examinations. If the other uses of examinations are 
to he served a more extensive investigation into the 
results of the answer papers, or samplings of ans¬ 
wer papers,, is necessary. Such investigations 
might well become a regular part of examination pro¬ 
cedure, and might serve, not only as topics of re¬ 
search, hut as a constant check on how well the ex¬ 
amination served the use for which it was intended, 
and as a guide to further improvement. 

This investigation proposes to deal with a 
sampling of three hundred and thirty answer papers 
of the final examination set by the Department of 
Education, Alberta, in Physics 2 for June 1942. The 
investigation consists of two parts. In the first 
part it is intended to examine in general the bases 
on which an achievement test such as the June, 1942 
Departmental Examination in Physics 2 could be 
judged. This necessitates consideration of the 






general uses of examinations, and in how far these 
uses are applicable to this particular test paper. 

It will be necessary also to examine the ob¬ 
jectives of teaching to find out how well the test 
paper tested these objectives. It is assumed that 
the objectives to be tested by a final examination 
are identical with the objectives of teaching, and, 
although it may be neither practicable nor possible 
to test all the objectives with this type of written 
test, it is at least desirable that the test items 
be so selected that as many objectives as possible 
be tested. 

The investigation is concerned also, as a 
further basis on which to judge the test paper and 
its results, with a survey of types of test items 
best suited to each objective and the situations 
to which each type is most applicable. However, for 
the purpose of this investigation it is not impera¬ 
tive to go too fully into the theory of test cons¬ 
truction— a more or less superficial study will 
serve as a basis on which to conduct the enquiry, 
for it is more with the results of the test than test

items themselves that the enquiry is concerned. 

Another point concerned in the investigation 
is the source of the test items. The questions 
here are: whether it is necessary or desirable to 
follow in parallel the course outline of subject 
matter in selecting the items, and whether items 
from material outside the course outline of subject 
matter are desirable or not. 

In Alberta a peculiar situation seems now to 
exist with regard to the difficulty of test items. 
Since the trend toward a more "progressive 11 educa¬ 
tional policy there has been the demand that the 
students of not so superior intelligence, that is, 
the n B n * s and n C ,!I s, be given equal opportunity and 
care to that given the students of superior ability. 
On the other hand those who set the test papers 
frequently include items of such an involved nature 
and so ingeniously worded that only a student of 
definitely superior ability can comprehend the ques¬ 
tion let alone master the processes and information 
necessary to obtain the correct response. 

There are items included of a purely intelli- 






-4- 


gence type, the correct response to which can be de¬ 
termined not so much by a year ! s education in Physics 
but by sheer native intelligence, even without the 
mastery of Physics. It is of interest to know 
whether to include both types of test items so that 
the Physics 2 test paper shall select on a basis of 
intelligence as well as on a basis of the mastery 
of Physics, which two factors are not entirely syn¬ 
onymous, since the factor of diligence, or appli¬ 
cation of intelligence, has a bearing on the matter. 
In as far as possible, by examination of the test 
paper and the answer papers, the answer to this 
question will be attempted. 

Finally, some study of the theory underlying 
the discriminating power of individual test items 
must be undertaken so that the test items may be 
evaluated on this basis. The discriminating power 
indicates to what extent success or failure on one 
particular test item measures possession of the 
ability being measured. A method of finding the dis¬ 
criminating power of test items, which is applicable 
to - this sampling of answer papers will have to be 







-5- 


discovered. 

The second part of this investigation is con¬ 
cerned with a study of first, the test paper; and 
second, the answer papers. In the study of the test 
paper will he undertaken the analysis of the paper 
for types of items with the number of items and the 
value assigned to each. The paper will be studied 
for the sources of the items, the text book being 
used as the source reference. The paper will also 
be examined for the objectives tested by each item. 
In this section also the test paper will be given 
in detail. 

The answer papers will be examined for 
number of correct responses to each item, average 
mark on each item, etc. ^ata arising from the 
responses on the answer papers will be grouped and 
tabled to study difficulty, discriminating power, 
statistical measurements, etc. 

The information from these tabulations and 
the results of the investigation will serve as the 
basis for certain general conclusions concerning 
the test. 






CHAPTER 2 

SOME THEORETICAL CONSIDERATIONS UNDERLYING 
THE CONSTRUCTION OF ACHIEVEMENT TESTS 

The Uses of Tests. 

The uses of tests and examinations will de¬ 
pend^ of course, upon such factors as: the examining 
body, the type of examination convenient and practi¬ 
cable in view of existing conditions, and the parti¬ 
cular time in the educative process at which the ex¬ 
amination is given; but a list of uses, of fairly 
comprehensive range, is given as follows^: 

(1) Selection (or rejection) 

(2) Maintenance of Standards, which presup¬ 
poses either the imposition and enforcement of a pre¬ 
scribed curriculum, or the enforcement of some mini¬ 
mum degree of attainment, or both. 

(3) The provision of a powerful incentive 
to study.

(4) To stimulate, or even enforce, improve¬ 
ment in teaching. 

(5) To afford a basis for the appraisal of 
teachers and departments. 

(6) To furnish data for educational guidance. 

(7) To constitute a method of instruction. 

(8) To be of assistance for the accrediting 
of schools and colleges. 

(9) To accumulate materials for research. 

According to at least one authority^the most 

vital and, from a true educational standpoint, the 
most important use of tests as listed above, is to 
furnish data for educational guidance. Despite its 
potential possibilities, however, this use is seldom 
taken advantage of, at least on the grade twelve 
level. In Alberta, the grade nine examinations serve 
this use in that promotions are classified and fur¬ 
ther education is controlled on a basis of this 
classification, but there has been no move in this 
direction in grade twelve.

and Use of Achievement Examinations 11 .

In at least two ways, however, examinations 
may serve indirectly, and more or less unintention¬ 
ally on the part of examining bodies, as data for 
educational guidance. Examination results may in¬ 
fluence the student in his selection of courses at 
an educational institution of higher learning, or 
they may influence the authorities of such institut¬ 
ion in allowing the student courses. Or, the results 
may have a subtle influence on the vocation chosen 
by the student. 

The most general use of examinations is the 
selection of students. In this use the type of test 
item and the teaching objective tested are of great 
importance, for depending on these factors the 
students might be selected on a basis of ability to 
memorize factual material from text books, or on a 
basis of understanding and interpretation and appli¬ 
cation of these facts, or upon best use of intelli¬ 
gence in the field of study, or upon a basis of 
native ability in any field; in each of these cases 
the selection would be determined by a different 
factor, depending on the type of test item used. 





9 - 


The necessity, on the part of the Department 
of Education, for giving recognition, in the form 
of a diploma or certificate, for acceptable attain¬ 
ment in the High School courses, and the necessity, 
due to lack of facilities, of selecting the better 
students by University and Normal School authorities, 
require that examinations will be used for selection 
as long as existing educational policies survive. It 
is to be noted that a recent improvement in Aiherta 
is the placing of selection on a competitive basis 
rather than on a basis of an arbitrary f! pass” mark. 

The time may come when selection and guidance 
as uses of examinations will be merged so that exam¬ 
ination results will classify students in such a way 
that definite guidance for future educational endeavor 
is given at the same time as the selection is made. 

Since in Alberta there is a prescribed course 
in Physics 2, and since it seems necessary for Uni¬ 
versity entrance purposes to have a certain amount of 
uniformity and something in the way of minimum 
attainment, maintenance of standards is another im¬ 
portant use of examinations in this province. 







- 10 - 


The tendency to use examinations for mainten¬ 
ance of standards grows less in Alberta as each 
change in educational policy appears. The dropping 
of an arbitrary pass mark, the provision for, and 
emphasis on, courses other than matriculation for 
University and Normal School, the widening of the 
course of studies, to give scope for individual teach¬ 
ing techniques, all suggest that use of examinations 
for this purpose is declining. 

Some uses of examinations are entirely unin¬ 
tentional on the part of the examining bodies. For 
example, the Department probably does not intend to 
use examinations as incentives to study, neverthe¬ 
less the motivating force of an approaching exam¬ 
ination is undoubtedly powerful. In some cases it 
is the most powerful, and sometimes the only, effect¬ 
ive incentive. In the same way, although the 
Department does not intentionally use examinations 
as a club to enforce improvement of teaching tech¬ 
niques, the examinations in themselves produce the 
required result in the teachers. A change in policy 
with regard to examinations, types of test items,

types of teaching objectives to be tested, etc., is 
usually quickly followed by a change or improvement 
in teaching techniques to suit new conditions. This 
fact is illustrated in the recent changes introduced 
into the High School course in Alberta. Conversion 
of the majority of teachers to newer and more desir¬ 
able teaching techniques would have taken a longer 
time perhaps, much propaganda, greater effort on the 
part of educational authorities, if it had not been 
for the change, at the same time, in the construction 
of test papers, and the introduction of new types of 
test items. The fact that taxpayers and school boards 
use examinations to afford a basis for the appraisal 
of teachers and departments causes teachers to adapt 
teaching techniques to new types of examinations. 

The use of examinations to provide materials 
for research provides valuable data for the education 
and improvement of teachers and student-teachers, and 
at the same time furnishes valuable data so that 
examining bodies may keep examinations progressively 
in tune with educational policy.

ations have been found, whether intentional on the 
part of examining bodies or not, to be applicable 
to Departmental examinations in Alberta and hence 
to the Physics 2 examination. It is unlikely that 
the Departmental examinations can be used to con¬ 
stitute a method of instruction, or that it is nec¬ 
essary that they be used to be of assistance in the 
accrediting of schools and colleges. 

The Objectives of Testing. 

11 A satisfactory test or examination in any 
subject is an instrument which gives evidence of the 
degree to which students are reaching the objectives 
of teaching. In order to examine the objectives of 
testing, then, it is necessary to examine the object¬ 
ives of teaching. The number of objectives of teach¬ 
ing involved, the distribution of emphasis among 
these objectives, will vary from country to country, 
from province to province, according to the edu¬ 
cational policy of elected members to legislatures.

struction and Use of Achievement Examinations.”

according to financial capacities of districts, from 
one teacher to another, according to the type of 
test paper set and the methods of correcting it, etc. 
The objectives of testing often serve to emphasize 
certain desirable objectives of teaching. Recently 
in Alberta the shift in emphasis to certain object¬ 
ives of teaching as evidenced in test papers has 
brought about a simultaneous shift in techniques 
in teaching. Thus, carefully selected objectives 
of testing are closely linked with objectives of 
teaching. 

The objectives of teaching courses in natural 
science have been listed as:"*" 

(A) The acquisition on the part of the 
students, of a knowledge of the principles and facts 
of the subject. 

(B) The ability to draw reasonable general¬ 
izations from experimental data. 

(C) The ability to plan experiments to test 
hypotheses. 

(D) The ability to apply scientific principles 
to new situations.

struction and Use of Achievement Examinations”

(E) Skill in laboratory techniques. 

(F) The understanding of important technical 
terminology and symbols. 

(G) The ability to identify structures and 
processes and their uses. 

(H) A familiarity with reliable sources of 
information on science problems. 

(i) An interest in natural phenomena, an in¬ 
terest in solving problems in natural science. 

(J) The ability to prepare' effective reports, 
both oral and written. 

(K) Habits of carrying science attitudes and 
abilities into other courses. 

(L) The habit of tolerance towards new ideas. 

(M) The habit of co-operation with others. 

It is difficult, if not impossible, to test 

some of these objectives by the ordinary written 
test. And whereas there are other methods of testing, 
for Departmental purposes the written test is 
undoubtedly most convenient and inexpensive. However 
the test items should be so chosen that as many ob¬ 
jectives as possible are tested, and there should be 






- 15 - 


enough variety among the test items so that there will 
he a fair distribution among the various objectives. 

The Types Of Test Items. 

The older essay-type examination was useful 
for testing a limited number of objectives, wherein 
lay its chief fault. As they have been used, the 
principal, and often the only, objective tested was 
the acquisition of a knowledge of the principles and 
facts of the subject in question. 

The newer type (objective-type) of achievement 
test provides more variety of test items and allows 
a greater number of teaching objectives to be tested. 
The types of test items on such a test paper might 
be classified as follows: 

Type I The simple recall question. A direct 
question answerable by a single word or phrase, for 
example: n When a room is heated by an open fireplace 
heat is transferred from the fire to the room 
principally by the process of _____. f! 

Type II. Sentence or paragraph completion, 
for example: ”Two general phases of metabolism are 
_which is the __process, and 














- 16 - 


_which is the_process." 

Type III. The multiple choice question, for 
example: "When the distance between the metal plates 
of a condenser is increased, the capacity of that 
condenser is (l) increased, (2) decreased, (5) un¬ 
changed. 

Type IV. Matching exercises, for example: 
"Select the term in column 2 which, best fits each 
description in column 1: 

Column 1. Column 2. 

1. Contain chromatin. chloroplastids 

2. Contain chlorophyll, nuclei 

3. Contain cellulose. cell walls of plants 

contractile vacuoles 
pyrenoids 

1 ._ __ 

2 . 

5. 

Type V. True-false type or Alternate response 
for example: 

" After each statement put the letter T or F to 
indicate whether the statement is true or false. 

1. All veins carry venous blood _____ 

2. All arteries carry blood away from 

the heart _____ 

3. White blood corpuscles are found 

only in the lymph vessels _____ 

4. Haemoglobin is a compound contain¬ 
ing iron ___ 

5. The circulation of the blood was 

demonstrated by Aristotle. ___

Type I has in its favor that it is easy to 
construct and easy to mark objectively. But on these 
counts it is frequently overworked. It is adapted to 
testing for knowledge of the factual or descriptive 
type and depends on a verbal association of the ”who- 
what-when-where” type. Overuse of this type emphas¬ 
izes unduly the teaching objective A — the acquisi¬ 
tion of knowledge of principles and facts of the sub¬ 
ject, and does not test for the understanding of 
complicated concepts, ability for inferential reason¬ 
ing, or interpretative ability. 

Type II is subject to much the same limitations 
as Type I and offers the same advantages. 

Type III—Multiple choice— if skilfully con¬ 
structed, offers the greatest possibilities to test 
understanding of involved concepts, ability for in¬ 
ferential reasoning, power of discrimination, and 
ability to interpret facts and principles rather 
than remember them. It is harder to construct in such 
a way as to be effective, however, and is open to 
more faults of construction. Its inclusion in tests 
insures of greater variety of teaching objectives

being tested. 

Type IV allov/s of greater simplicity of phras¬ 
ing and hence is easier to construct than type III, 
although it is essentially a multiple choice type. 

If properly constructed, so that there are a large 
number of responses, the guessing element can be 
largely eliminated. It is rather limited in that it 
is best adapted to test descriptive facts rather 
than interpretative ideas and inferential reasoning. 

Type V is most popular on tests used outside 
educational institutions, probably on account of its 
ease of construction. However, for educational pur¬ 
poses, it is one of the least satisfactory types of 
test items and in the more informed educational 
circles its use is declining. One of its most ser¬ 
ious disadvantages, and one which is almost unavoid¬ 
able, since the student has an even chance of success, 
is the prominence of the guessing element. Another 
disadvantage is that it has to be very carefully 
worded to avoid ambiguities and tell-tale clues. 

It is useful, however, in testing for wrong be¬ 
liefs and superstitions, or in cases where there are

only two possible answers. 

The prevention of the use of rote memory in 
answering test items depends a great deal upon the 
type of test item and the wording of the test item. 
Types I, II, and V are especially liable to encour¬ 
age rote memory if there is any tendency of the 
test maker to use text book or familiar phraseology. 
Hawked, Lindquist and Mann' 1 ' cite a very interesting 
case where five different types of items on the same 
topic were given, among a number of test items, to 
a group of students. The items and results are as 
follows: 

1. What is the heat of fusion of ice in 
calories? 

This item requires only a verbal association 
between ,! heat of fusion 11 and ”80 calories”. 75$ of 
students answered correctly, only 16$ of these gave 
correct responses to all the remaining items. 

2. How much heat is required to melt 1 gram 
of ice at 0 degrees C.? 

This item is of the association type but the

phrasing is not of the f, pat n type. 70% of students 
responded correctly. 

3. Write a definition of the heat of fusion. 

50% of students answered correctly; some stu¬ 
dents could make the verbal association called for 
in 1 and 2 but had no adequate understanding of 
meaning. 

4. The water in a certain container would 
give off 800 calories of heat in cooling to 0 de¬ 
grees C.; if 800 grams of ice are placed in the water, 
the heat from the water will melt 

(a) All the ice. 

(b) About 10 grams of ice. 

(c) Nearly all the ice. 

(d) Between 1 and 2 grams of ice. 

35% of students answered correctly. 

5. In which of the following situations has 
the number of calories exactly equal to the heat of 
fusion of the substance in question been applied? 

(a) Ice at 0 degrees C. is changed to water 
at 10 degrees C. 

(b) Water at 100 degrees C. is changed to 
steam at 100 degrees C.

(c) Steam at 100 degrees C. is changed to 
water at 100 degrees C. 

(d) Frozen alcohol at -130 degrees C. is 
changed to liquid alcohol at -130 degrees C. 

34 % of students answered correctly. 

The conclusion drawn from this experiment is 
that test items 1, 2, and 3 were inadequate to test 
real understanding; that 4 was better and 5 best. 

n It should be the teacher 1 s objective in test 
construction so to phrase or present the questions 
and responses that only a genuine understanding of 
the concepts involved will enable the student to 
respond correctly. ... Nev^r approaches, novel appli¬ 
cations and illustrations and unfamiliar phraseology 
should be employed whenever possible; and they will 
and should confuse only the student whose achievement 
is only superficial. ... The test items must test 
the students* reasoned understanding of, and ability 
to use, that which they have learned. 15 ^

Careless wording of test items will frequent¬ 
ly serve as a clue to the correct response. Grammat¬ 
ical structure will often give the correct response 
away where tenses of verbs, number of verbs and nouns, 
indicate only one response can be correct grammati¬ 
cally, 

A number of commonly used words or phases 
will act as specific determiners for students who 
are familiar with objective-type tests. Data given 
by Hawkes, Lidquist and Mann suggest that 

four out of five statements containing "all” 
were false, 

four out of five statements containing "none” 
were false, 

nine out of ten statements containing "only" 
were false. 

Other such specific determiners were: "gen¬ 
erally", "reason" or "because", "always", length of 
statements and enumeration statements. 

The responses given to multiple choice items 
should be selected with care that the correct re¬ 
sponse does not stand out principally because the 

















.

other responses are obviously incorrect. The follow¬ 
ing question was given to a class of twenty-five 
grade nine students: 

A falling barometer forecasts a storm because 
(l) the pressure is increasing; (2) Cold weather may 
come; (3) Toricelli said so; (4) moist air is 
lighter than dry air. 

Nineteen students selected the correct response 
but of these, fifteen students did not know, it was 
revealed by oral questions later, whether moist air 
was really lighter than dry air or not (in fact, the 
concensus of opinion was that it was not), but they 
chose the correct response because the others were 
obviously incorrect; and as the students remarked, 
some bordered on the rediculous. 

It is evident, then, that extreme care must 
go into the construction of these ne\Y objective- 
type test items so that they may actually measure 
what they are intended to measure, and that correct 
response is actually determined by an understanding 
of the material tested for and not by some factor 
unknown to the author of the test.

The Difficulty Of Test Items. 

In order that the test may he a good measur¬ 
ing instrument, it is essential that the test items 
he distributed over a wide range of difficulty. A 
rectangular distribution of items on the difficulty 
scale would have approximately the same number of 
test items on each stage of difficulty; while an¬ 
other distribution would have comparatively few easy 
or hard items and most of the items of about 50$ 
difficulty. In either case it is well to have both 
easy and difficult items on the test. 

However, in securing the desired range of 
difficulty it is a poor practice to include trivial 
or irrelevant material; though, at the same time, it 
is not necessary, or even desirable, to parallel the 
course of study in selecting the test items, or to 
base the test items upon material deemed most impor¬ 
tant because it embraces the fundamental principles 
of the course. 

It is desirable also that the average score 
on the test shall be approximately one half the 
total score possible.

The Discriminating power of Test Items• 

11 Discriminating power may be defined as the 
accuracy with which a pupil can be placed along 
the scale of general achievement on the basis of 
his success or failure on a given item. Items with 
high discriminating power, apart from their 
desirability or difficulty, represent far more 
crucial tests or indicators of pupils’ levels 
of general achievement than others.”^ 

If general achievement is taken to mean 
the whole field of the pupil’s studies, the a 
separate criterion test, a standardized achieve¬ 
ment test (sometimes called 11 intelligence” test) 
must be used to obtain the rank on the general 
achievement scale. If an item have high discrim¬ 
inating power then those students who rank high 
on the criterion test will succeed on this item, 
whereas those who rank low on the criterion test 
will not show success on this item.

and Use of Achievement Examinations.”

If the item have low discriminating power, success 
or failure on this item will not be any indication 
of ranking on the criterion test: that is, the 
high scores on the criterion test will show no 
greater degree of success or failure on this item 
than the low scores. 

If the term general achievement is limited 
to the one subject being tested, then success or 
failure on an item with high discriminating power 
will indicate ranking on the total mark for this 
test. With this interpretation the total scores 
on the test itself may be used instead of a 
criterion test to indicate general achievement in 
the subject. 

Smith and Wright 1 suggest that one method 
of arriving at discriminating power of any item 
is to select a group of high-score papers and a 
group of low-score papers, and to make a comparison 
1 Smith and Wright: “Tests and Measurements.” ~

of success or failure on any given item between 
these two groups. A large difference between the 
average mark made by the high-scoring group and 
that made by the low-scoring group on any given 
item would indicate high discriminating power 
of that item. A small difference in average marks 
could mean that each group did equally well, or 
poorly,and hence indicates low discriminating 
power. 

For Departmental examinations it is very 
desirable that a good percentage of items on the 
test paper have high discriminating power, for the 
whole purpose of the test is to rank candidates 
according to general achievement in the subject. 
Items, then, on which all candidates do equally 
well or poorly are useless for this ranking process. 
Discriminating power is an important quality to 
consider in the analysis of a test paper. 

























, 




































- 28 - 


It is desirable also for examiners to know 
how discriminating power is related to difficulty. 
Whether discriminating power is directly propor¬ 
tional to difficulty, or whether discriminating 
power diminishes after a certain degree of diff¬ 
iculty is reached, and if so, what degree of 
difficulty this is, will determine the attitude 
of examiners as to the distribution of items on 
the difficulty scale— whether it shall be rect¬ 
angular or not. 

Discriminating power of items, as determined 
in the manner outlined above, and applied to the 
physics 2 examination under analysis, is presented 
in a later schapter.

CHAPTER FOUR 


Analysis of the Test Paper. 

1. Types of Test Items. 

In making an analysis of the test items them¬ 
selves two classifications were used. The first one 
distinguished between items on a basis of form— the 
phrasing of the question and that of the answer 
required. This classification consists of four 
groups: 

(a) Recall Items— involving the completion 
of a sentence by a word, phrase or number. 

(b) Multiple Choice Items-— involving the 
selection of the correct one of several given re¬ 
sponses. 

(c) Numerical Problems— mathematical pro¬ 
blems based on the physical principles in the course. 

t ^ 

(d) Essay-type Items— involving an explan¬ 
ation or description of some principle or device. 

Examples of each of these types are: 

Recall: '’The Centigrade Temperature at which a gram of 

water occupies the least volume is____. ” 

Multiple Choice: !r $hen the distance between the 
metal plates of a condenser is increased, the 
capacity of that condenser is-- 












-48- 

(1) increased 

(2) decreased 

(3) unchanged (_) 

Numerical Problem: M A motor using a current of two 
amperes at 120 vdlts, lifts a weight of 22 pounds 
to a height of 150 feet in half a minute* Find the 
efficiency of the motor. (746 watts equal 1 horse¬ 
power) M . 

Essay-type Item: “Describe by the aid of a diagram 
the construction of a simple type of electric 
motor. Explain the principle of its operation. 

What is meant by the back electromotive force of a 
motor? Under what circumstances is it (1) greatest, 
(2) least? What is its effect upon the operation 
of the motor?” 

A second classification groups the items 
according to content, -ana the type of mental 
activity necessary on the part of the student in 
order to obtain a satisfactory answer. Six groups 
separate the items roughly into increasingly 
complex types of mental activity: 
























• - 
















































-49- 


Type I: Items requiring a simple, direct answer 
involving factual knowledge. 

Type II: items requiring an answer involving 

factual knowledge but with some inferential 
reasoning necessary. 

Type III: Items requiring an answer involving 
mainly inferential reasoning. 

Type IV: Items requiring an answer involving 

self expression on a principle, process, 
or technique pertaining to Physics. 

Type V: Items requiring an answer involving 

reasoning of a mathematical type, and a 
knowledge of the application of mathematical 
principles to problem situations. 

Type VI: Items requiring a high degree of reading 
comprehension and reasoning ability. 

To illustrate these types the following 
examples are chosen from the test paper. 

Type I—Simple,direct factual ans?/er required. 

"The Centigrade temperature at which a gram 
of water occupies the least volume is _ ,y 


Type II— Factual, with some inferential reasoning:

"When 50 grams of water at 32°F are frozen, 
the number of calories of heat given off by the 

water is_ M 

Type III— Mainly inferential reasoning: 

M A student, in charging an uncharged electro¬ 
scope, rubbed a glass rod briskly with a piece of 
silk and touched the glass rod to the knob of the 
electroscope. The sign of the charge then on the 

electroscope was ___. " 

Type IV— Self expression on a principle etc,: 

Describe, by aid of a diagram, the constr¬ 
uction of a simple type of electric motor. Explain 
the principle of its operation. What is meant by the 
back electromotive force of a motor? Upon what 
circumstances is it (1) greatest? (2) least? What 
is the effect on the operation of the motor? 

Type V— Mathematical reasoning: 

Four copper wires of exactly the same 
dimensionshave, when connected in parallel, the same 
resistance as one copper wire of the same length but 
with a diameter-

(1) V2“ times as large 

(2) 4 times as large 

(3) as large 

(4) \ as large 

(5) twice as large, ( _) 

Type VI—High degree of comprehension etc.: 

" A metal ball of specific heat 0.1 falls 
to the ground from a certain height and its temperature 
is observed to rise 1°F. If it is assumed that all the 
energy of all the fall goes into heating the ball, 
this height would have to be: 

(778 ft.-pds = 1 B.T.U.) (____feet) 

The following table indicates the number 
of each type of item, the percentage this number 
was of the total number of items; the value allotted 
to each type and the percentage this value was of 
the total value allotted to the paper. A more 
complete analysis of each item and its classification, 
value etc is given in the appendix at the end of 
this work.

It is to be noted that the test paper in 
Physics 2, June 1942, consisted of sixty-eight 
separate questions, some of which had one or more 
parts which, in this analysis, are treated as 
separate items, thus there are seventy-eight items 
considered in these classifications. The paper 
was in two sections: section A contained fifty- 
four objective, or short-answer, items, and 
section B contained twenty-four items, six of 
which were short-answer type, two of which were 
essay-type, and sixteen of which are numerical 
problems. 

There were one hundred seventy-seven marks 
allotted to the paper as a whole, ninety-four to 
section A, and eighty-three to section B. 

From the table it is seen that there were 
twice as many Recall items as any other type, and that 
the numerical problems were heavily weighted as 
to marks. In the second classification, whereas 
Type I and Type III are highest as to numbers, 

Type V (mathematical reasoning) is highest as to 


marks allotted

It will be seen, after other factors in 
the analysis have been considered, whether this 
distribution of types and weighting of values is 
justifiable. 

2. Sources of the Test Items and Coverage of the 
Course. 

In the measurement of the extent of the 
prescribed course and of the coverage of this 
course by the test paper, the unit of measurement 
chosen was the numbered subsection in the prescrib¬ 
ed text. These sub-sections were considered to be 
similar in difficulty and scope. 

The following table sets forth the units 
prescribed and the units tested.

From the above table the following conclu¬

39% of the units tested were from the part on Heat* 
which made up 40% of the prescribed course 
and was allotted 39% of the total marks 
47% of the units tested were based on Electricity 
and Magnetism, which made up 60% of the 
prescribed course and was allotted 51% of 
the total marks.

14% of the units tested were based on material not 
prescribed which was allotted 10% of the 
total marks. 

Recall and Multiple Choice items represent 
what is new in the technique of testing whereas 
Numerical problems and Essay-type items represent 
the older and more conventional type of testing 
item. It is interesting, then, to compare these 
different types as to the number of source units 
covered or involved by each in relation to 
number of items required and value allotted. 

The ratio of t&e percentage of total value all¬ 
otted to the percentage of the prescribed course 
involved by any type of item might be said to 
represent the'economy of testing'of that type of 
item. 'Economy of testing' would be one of the several 
factors to be considered in measuring the effic¬ 
iency of any test paper. 

The following table indicates the amount 
of source material involved by various types.

It is to be noted from the above table that: 
Recall items cover 14% of thencourse with 53% of the 
items and 35% of the total value. 

Multiple Choice items cover 8% of the course with 
24% of items and 21% of the value. 

Numerical Problems cover 6% of the course with 
21% of items and 36% of value. 

Essay-type items cover 1% of the course with 3% of 






































































































































- 58 - 

items and 8% of total value* 

It is seen that Recall and Multiple Choice 
cover the course most economically of value, whereas 
Essay-type items cover the course least economically 
of value. Other factors, however, must be taken 
into account in considering the total efficiency 
of types of test items, so that what the Numerical 
problem and the Essay-type items lose in econ¬ 
omy of testing may be made up by some other quality* 

3* The Objectives fested byothe faper* 

There are certain objectives to be attained 
in the teaching of any subject and it should be the 
purpose of a good test paper to test as many of 
these teaching' objectives as may be practicable* 

A list of desirable objectives in the teaching of 
physics 2 is set forth roughly in order of prefer¬ 
ence, and preceded by a code letter which is used 
in tabulation. 

A. The acquisition of a knowledge of the 
principles and facts of Physics. 

B. The ability to draw reasonable gener¬ 
alizations from experimental data.

C. The ability to plan experiments to test 
hypotheses. 

D. The ability to apply scientific prin¬ 
ciples to new situations. 

E. Skill in laboratory techniques. 

F. The understanding of important tech¬ 
nical terminology and symbols. 

G. The ability to identify structures and 
processes and their functions. 

H. Familiarity with reliable sources of infor¬ 
mation on science problems. 

The following table lists the objectives 
which have been found to have been tested by the 
test paper, together with the number of itrnes and 
the value allotted to the testing of each objective.

This table indicates a decided weighting 
towards the testing of but one of the many- 
obectives of teaching. Although it is recognized 
amongst the more progressive minded educationists 
that the foregoing list of objectives are all 
nearly equally important, it is shown that the 
test throws the emphasis on the acquisition of 
facts and principles of Physics. 

This weighting on examinations will be 
reflected in teaching procedures throughout the 
province; thus modern trends and aims in teaching 
are being defeated, "stabbed in the back", by 
examinations which are not in harmony with sug¬ 
gested teaching outlines and techniques. 

From the students’ standpoint objective A, 
the acquisition of the facts and principles of 
Physics, is most valid for the students who wish to 
go to University and so need a solid background 
of facts and principles. But this type of student 
makes up only a small percentage of the total 
number. Objectives B, C, D, E, are those which 











. : 





















. ' 










■ 

































- 62 - 


educate for general citizenship, and therefore 
should receive equal emphasis on an examination. 

This examination may well be criticized on the 
grounds that the items do not test a wide enough 
range of the objectives of teaching in such a 
subject as Physics. 

4. The Difficulty of the Test Items. 

The possible reasons for the difficulty of 
test items may be classified and analysed as follows* 
A. Those arising from the nature of the item. 
1. The wording of the item. 

— Ambiguous words. 

— Deliberately misleading, trick and 
catch questions. 

--Obscure and devious wording. 

—Involved beyond the comprehension 
of a student of that age level and 
experience 

2. The problem situation: 

—Unusually involved 
—Unusual and unfamiliar approach. 











- 63 - 


3. Source materials 

-Involving subject material not prescribed, 
-Difficulty beyond that of the text pres¬ 
entation, 

-Source material not extensive enough in 
range to be properly tested.(i,e. items 
on unimportant, minor and not too rele¬ 
vant details.) 

B. Arising out of the preparation and intell¬ 
igence of the candidate: 

1. The capacity of the candidate: 
-Incompletely developed (or exercised) 

reasoning ability. 

-Inferior reading comprehension. 

Lack of imagery—mechanical or math¬ 
ematical. 

-Lack of ability to transfer knowledge 
to an unfamiliar situation. 

2. previous experience, or, learning 
achievement: 

-Lack of knowledge of the subject 
material 

-Mechanical errors in the mathematical 









- 64 - 


processes. 

-Incomplete understanding of the applicat¬ 
ion of such fundemental concepts as 
ratio and proportion, variation, etc. 

It is apparent that because of the large 
variety of factors entering into the reason for the 
difficulty of any single test item, that any 
analysis to find such reason will be very difficult. 

It was not considered practical to examine each of 
seventy-eight test items on three hundred thirty 
answer papers to trace reasons for difficulty. 

Instead those groups of items on the same source 
units were examined as to possible causes of diff¬ 
iculty, especially where a wide difference in the 
average mark indicated that some reason other than 
ignorance of the source material was responsible. 

A sampling of ten answer papers chosen at random 
was examined in an attempt to learn from the 
answers the nature of the difficulty. 

In a second attempt to trace the reason 
for difficulty, and to link difficulty to source 
units responsible, if possible, the twenty-five 
most difficult items, as indicated by average 
mark, were examined on a sampling of answer papers

and an attest was made to locate the source of 
difficulty.

From these tables it is seen that, aside from 
ignorance of source material, which remains a const¬ 
ant factor, three reasons for difficulty of source 
items are apparent: 

1. Lack of ability to apply principles of 
physics in a problem situation—i.e. to use mathe¬ 
matical reasoning in relation to Physics. 

2. Lack of understanding of mathematical 
principles themselves. 

3. Lack of ability to transfer knowledge to 
an unfamiliar problem situation. 

In the attempt to link reason for difficulty 
and source material, the twenty-five most difficult 
items, as indicated by average mark, were examined. 
The following tabulations indicate the results of 
the investigation:

Prom tables VII, VIII, and IX it may be con¬ 
cluded that 62% of all Numerical problems and 100% 
of all Essay type items were included in the twenty- 
five most difficult items. It would seem that the 
difficulty in physics is mathematics, for the Numeri¬ 
cal problems make up the largest percentage of the 
twenty-five most difficult items. 

Table IX lists the sources which apparently 
gave the most difficulty. This list indicates also 
that those sections of the work prescribed where 
mathematical reasoning is most applicable, or most 
necessary for a complete understanding of the work, 
present most difficulty to the student. The failure 
of quite a number of grade twelve students to app¬ 
reciate even the most necessary mathematical rela¬ 
tionships and to be able to reason mathematically 
is reflected by the fact that Numerical problems 
present such great difficulty. 

Difficulty Distribution. 

There are two types of difficulty distri¬ 
butions: the first, the "rectangular", places 
approximately the 















■ 


-73- 


same number of items in each difficulty level, whereas 
the second, which may be called a triangular* one, 
places most of the items at the medium difficulty 
level and relatively few at either the least or 
most difficult level. The table following indicates 
the distribution of items as to difficulty. In this 
table difficulty is determined by average mark 
expressed as a percentage. Thus the difficulty level 
indicated by 90-100 means that the average mark of 
these items lay between 90% and 100%, i.e. this is 
the least difficult level. Thus the difficulty level 
indicated by the figures 0-9 is the most difficult 
level, in later tables it was considered necessary, 
in the interests of simplicity, to reduce the number 
of difficulty levels to three. The ~Easy level 
consists of the three levels from 70-79 to 90-100. 

The Medium level consists of the four levels from 
30-39 to 60-69. The Difficult level consists of 
the three levels 0-9 to 20-29.

From the table it is to be noted that the 
items are grouped towards the lower difficulty 
levels. The distribution is not "triangular" since 
there are relatively few items towards the medium 
difficulty levels, neither does the distribution 
closely follow the rectangular distribution. The 
accompanying diagram on this page indicates by a 
histogram the difficulty distribution, and for 
purposes of comparison lines representing a rect¬ 
angular and a triangular distribution are super¬ 
imposed on it.

Difficulty and Type of Item. 

In order to compare the various types of 
items as to difficulty the condensed scale of diff¬ 
iculty levels was used. The tables below make this 
comparison with both classifications of the items

From this table it is concluded that the 
Numerical problems offer most difficulty, and that 
Recall items offer little difficulty. The Multiple 
Choice type are fairly evenly distributed among the 
difficulty levels— a point in favor of this type 
of item. It is to be noted too that the majority 
of items which gave the greatest difficulty were 
Multiple Choice items.

Type III— Mainly inferential reasoning. 

Type IV—Self expression of a principle, device etc. 
Type V—Involving mathematical reasoning. 

Type VI— Involving a high degree of comprehension etc. 


Again it is seen that those problems which 
involve mathematical reasoning are bunched more 
towards the difficult level than any other type. 
Problems which involve inferential reasoning offered 
more difficulty than those which did not. Problems 
which involve self expression in the explanation 
of a process, principle or device offer more than 
moderate difficulty.

Difficulty and Objective Tested.

items testing each objective as to which difficulty 
level it belongs:

Conclusions: Items testing objective A are 
more or less evenly spaced along the difficulty scale. 
The items testing objectives F and G are grouped 
towards the Easy level. A more even distibution 
in this respect is desirable in order that this 
objective be tested thoroughly. 




















- 79 - 


The Discriminating Power of Test Items. 

To evaluate the discriminating power of the 
test items the ten answer papers with the highest 
total scores were selected as the high-score group 
and the ten answer papers with the lowest total 
scores as the low-score group. The average mark, 
expressed in percent, made on a given item by the 
high-score group less the average made on that 
item by the low-score group gives a difference 
indicating the discriminating power of that item. 
These differences are classified into ten groups 
with index numbers from zero to nine. A difference 
from 90% to 100% would have an index number of 9, 
and would indicate high discriminating power. 

A difference of 80% to 89% would have a discri¬ 
minating index of 8, and so on down to a diff¬ 
erence of 0% to 9% with a discriminating index 
of 0. Thus discriminating power is indicated in 
ten gradations. The following table deals with 
discriminating power of test items.

From this table it may be seen that a large 
proportion of items had high discriminating power 
since 60% of items have a discriminating index of 
6 or better. Relatively few items have very low 
discriminating power since only 14% have an index 
of 2 or lower.

It may be concluded from the above table 
that Numerical Problems have the highest discri¬ 
minating power—about 70% of these items have a 
discriminating index of 7 or better. In spite of 
other defects, such as poor economy of testing, 
the use of this type of item is justified on the 


























- 82 - 


basis of discriminating power. Recall items were 
well scattered along the discriminating power scale, 
a good proportion, however, had high discriminating 
power. As fourteen out of nineteen Multiple Choice 
items have an index from three to six, inclusive, 
the discriminating power of these items is medium.

If any generalization may be drawn from 
this table, it is that items of medium difficulty 
had highest discriminating power, while the very 
easy or very difficult items had low discrimi¬ 
nating power. This conclusion argues strongly for 
the ’triangular 1 type of difficulty distribution. 
































CHAPTER FIVE 


Summary of Conclusions. 

The following conclusions can be drawn with 
respect to the relative merits of the different 
types of items used on the test paper: 

(1) Multiple Choice items demand more infer¬ 
ential reasoning on the part of the candidate than 
do Recall type items. 

(2) Multiple Choice and Recall items cover the 
course equally well with respect to value allotted. 
Numerical problems and Essay types show less cover¬ 
age for value allotted. 

(3) Recall items were grouped at the least 
difficult levels of the difficulty scale; Multiple 
Choice items were well distributed over the diffi¬ 
culty scale; Numerical Problems were grouped at the 
medium and difficult levels of the difficulty scale. 

(4) Numerical Problems had the highest 
discriminating power; Multiple Choice items had medium 
discriminating power; Recall items had varying 
discriminating power.

Although Multiple Choice items are thus 
shown to be superior to Recall items in several 
respects, the number and value of the Multiple 
Choice items were lower than those of the Recall 
items. The reason for this may be that a satis¬ 
factory Recall type item is more easily constructed 
and more economical of space than a satisfactory 
Multiple Choice item. This, however, should not 
be allowed to overweigh its obvious defects. 

The Value of the test paper was distributed 
very fairly according to the amount of source 
material prescribed. It is not only unnecessary but 
undesirable to use items based on source material 
not prescribed, since such items will not test 
education in physics, but rather, will test native 
intelligence. A test paper in a single subject,such 
as physics, shouldube an instrument to test the degree 
to which the various objectives of teaching have 
been reached rather than an intelligence test, for there 
are much better tests for this purpose. 

The test paper weighted one objective of 
teaching, the acquisition of a knowledge of the 
facts and principles of physics, far in excess of 




























A 








' 








♦ 












■ 










; 



























- 86 - 


all others with ... espect to number and value of items. 

In view of the moderns aims and teaching techniques 
this is extremely undesirable. In addition, the items 
testing the other objectives were poorly distributed 
along the difficulty scale. 

On the whole the test paper was not too diffi¬ 
cult. Although the difficulty distribution does not 
conform to either the "rectangular" or the ’’triangular' 1 
distribution, the grouping is towards the less diffi¬ 
cult levels rather than the more difficult levels. 

The majotity of items had medium to high 
discriminating power and relatively few items had 
low discriminating power. The paper was therefore 
good in this respect. In view of the fact that the 
very easy and the very difficultitems had low discri¬ 
minating power, whereas the items of medium difficulty- 
bad highest discriminating power, it is probably 
desirable that the difficulty distribution be of the 
’’triangular" type. 

Ignorance of source material did not seem to 
be as important a factor in cause of difficulty as 
the type of reasoning demanded in the response. The 
















' 












. 
















- 

* 








■ • 










■ 


■ 






. 









-87- 


type of item with lowest number of correct responses 
was that involving mathematical reasoning. It would 
seem that ignorance of the simple mathematical prin¬ 
ciples and their operation proved the greatest 
stumbling block. Those sections of source material 
singled out as being most difficult were almost 
without exception the ones where mathematical reas¬ 
oning was most necessary. 

The -most important question to be settled by 
an investigation of this nature is: "Was the test 
paper a "fair" one?". In order to answer this 
question it is necessary that the term "fairness" 
be defined. Three parties are to be satisfied in 
stating the attributes of a "fair" paper. These are: 
(1) the candidate, (2) the examining bodies, (3) the 
teachers. 

Of primary interest to candidates is the 
difficulty of test items. From his standpoint the 
desirable qualities in this respect might be: 
simplicity of wording; straightforwardness of 
approach, that is, absence of "catches" for the 
unwary; the matching of the difficulty to the age 



















■

. 






, 





























- 88 - 


level and experience of the student; a reasonable 
limit to the number of steps or operations nece¬ 
ssary in the solution of a problem; an even distri¬ 
bution along the difficulty scale. 

The candidate is also greatly concerned 
with the source of items. He would doubtless app¬ 
reciate such qualities as: the basing of items on 
'‘familiar' 1 source material; the use of a wide range 
of source material; the distribution of value and 
number of items among the important and vital prin¬ 
ciples of the course in proportion to their impor¬ 
tance* 

The examining bodies interested in Depart¬ 
mental Examinations fall into two groups: insti¬ 
tutions of more advanced instruction, such as 
universities and normal schools, and the certify¬ 
ing body—the Department of Education. 

The University is primarily concerned with 
(a) the extent to which candidates have mastered 
the basic and fundamental information, (b) the 
extent to which the candidates have mastered basic 














-89- 

techniques, and (c) the ability of the candidates 
to apply information to problem situations. They are 
therefore interested in (1) the coverage of the 
prescribed source material,*(2) the discriminating 
powers of items, (3) the type of item used. 

Normal Schools are also interested in the 
extent to which the basic, fundamental principles 
have been mastered, and also in the extent to which 
the course studied can fit the candidate to be an 
efficient teacher and a desirable citizen. They are, 
therefore,concerned with the range of objectives 
tested, the discriminating power of items, and type 
of item (second classification). 

The Department of Education is primarily 
interested in classifying candidates in order of 
merit so that the successful can be separated from 
the unsuccessful; and secondly in the extent to 
which the course has benefitted the candidate in 
training for useful citizenship. Thus the discri¬ 
minating power of items and the range of objec¬ 
tives tested are of major interest. In the marking 


























' 



















































-90- 


of the answer papers, type of item in relation to 
ease of reading the answer and amount of source 
material covered are also to be considered* 

To a progressive, foresighted and broad¬ 
minded teacher the range of objectives tested is of 
primary interest, since his aim is to instil a 
broader understanding of the physical surroundings 
to fit the candidate for more intelligent citizen¬ 
ship and a completer life. The teacher is also concerned 
withthe coverage of the source material and the distr¬ 
ibution of values and number of items among the 
important and fundamental principles in relation 
to their importance. In this regard the type of 
item is important. 

As to the fairness of the test paper it may 
be said that with the exception of the placing of 
undue emphasis on the acquisition of a knowledge 
of the facts and principles of Physics, and the 
basing of some of the items on source material not 
prescribed, the paper was fair to the candidate.

-91- 


From the standpoint of the examining bodies 
the paper might be criticised chiefly because of the 
narrow range of objectives tested. Although satis¬ 
factory, perhaps, in this respect to an institution 
of more advanced instruction, the test paper does 
not satisfy a broader purpose of education. With 
respect to discriminating power of the items, 
coverage of the prescribed course and difficulty range 
the paper was satisfactory. 

The use of numerical problems, sometimes 
considered as 'old-fashioned', is justified on the 
grounds that they had very high discriminating 
power even though they covered less source material 
for value allotted than other types. 

To the teacher the paper was fair from a 
standpoint of proportion of value allotted to sections 
of source material, and difficulty of items. It was 
not satisfactory in that it was not in harmony with 
recent policies with respect to objectives of teaching 
because of the narrow range of objective tested. 

The teacher would also find it unnecessary to include 






\ 












■ ; 

, 





























-92- 


items on source material not prescribed. 

In conclusion, it has been found that the chief 
defects of the paper lie in the undue weighting of 
the number and value of recall items over multiple 
choice items, and in the narrowness of range of 
objectives tested. The paper, however was very- 
fair with respect to coverage of source materials, 
allottment of number and value of items to sections 
of source material, discriminating power of test 
items, difficulty distribution and type of item used.
