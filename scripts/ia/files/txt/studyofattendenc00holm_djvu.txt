SYNOPSIS 


The main aim of this study was to investigate the effects of 
vanning on the achievement of grade two, four and six pupils in 
arithmetic, reading and language. 

Using two forms of the Stanford Achievement Test as measuring 
instruments, tests were administered at appropriate grade levels to a 
number of pupils who were vanned to school and to a comparable number 
who were not. 

Since the two groups could not be equated at the beginning of 
the experiment, the data were treated statistically using the analysis 
of covariance technique. The assumptions necessary for the validity 
of the covariance analysis were also tested. 

The findings indicated that there was a significant difference 
in achievement in arithmetic and reading in favor of the unvanned grade 
two pupils and a significant difference in arithmetic achievement 
favoring the vanned grade four pupils. There appeared to be no 
differences between the two groups in grade four reading achievement. 

At the grade six level there were no significant differences in 
arithmetic, reading and language achievement of the two groups. 

Since all the prerequisite assumptions for analysis of 
covariance could not be fully satisfied, the findings were treated with 
some reservation. 

The computation for the comparison of attendance was based on 
a critical ratio. To justify this analysis the homogeneity of variance

was tested and confirmed. The findings indicated that there was a 
significant difference in attendance in favor of the grade six unvanned 
group.

CHAPTER I 


INTRODUCTION 

During the past twenty years the pattern of school organization 
in Alberta has kept pace with the province's growth and development. 

Small ungraded schools have been closed and the pupils transported to 
larger schools at central points. This consolidation or centralization 
of schools has been accelerated by such factors as the teacher shortage, 
unwillingness of teachers to work in isolated areas and the public demand 
for a level of rural education comparable to that found in city systems. 

Consolidation of schools and services has permitted a more complete 
educational program for rural areas. It has also made possible increased 
provision for courses leading to graduation from grade twelve with a high 
school diploma or senior matriculation standing. 

To transport rural children to centralized schools it has become 
the accepted practice for school authorities to operate fleets of school 
vans. In the school year ending in 1957 the school divisions and counties 
of this province transported 66,823 pupils over a distance of 113,056 
miles per day at an annual cost of $6,473,981.48.^ 

Operating under this centralized organization divisional boards 
have striven to equalize the educational opportunities of rural pupils 
and pupils in cities and towns. To avail themselves of extended

Annual Report , 1956, Table No. 32.

opportunities rural pupils must daily spend varying periods of time in 
school vans in addition to time spent during regular hours of school. 

This lengthening of the school day might be expected to have an adverse 
effect upon the achievement of rural pupils. Since vanning has become 
an accepted practice for the majority of rural students, it would appear 
desirable to obtain some reliable information on the effects of vanning 
upon scholastic achievement. 

THE PROBLEM 

Is the vanning of pupils to centralized schools prejudicial to 
their achievement, health or attendance? The answer to this problem is 
of vital concern to parents, teachers and boards of trustees. Educational 
literature does not give us too clear an answer to the question. As a 
consequence it was decided to conduct a rather extensive study of the 
problem in four rural divisions in order to arrive at a definite finding 
which might guide the thinking of those responsible for the establishment 
and maintenance of van routes in centralized school areas.

relating transportation of pupils to educational achievement. Most of 

the studies listed pertain to various phases of transportation such as 

driver selection, safety standards, bus routes and finance.

Andrews, reporting in the Alberta School Trustee, states that 
during a four-year period following the consolidation of schools in the 
Lamont School Division the number of grade nine failures was reduced by 
thirty-seven per cent. Since these comparisons are more directly related 
to the advantages of consolidation of schools than to the effects of 
transportation on academic achievement their value is limited. 

A study by Lambert"* indicates that the length of the school day 
is increased for children who are transported to school, but gives no 
indication of the effect of vanning upon educational achievement. 

Lee f s^ English study revealed a greater incidence of maladjustment 
in transported children than in those who were not transported, and that 
adjustment became increasingly poorer with increase in age. Poor adjust¬ 
ment at school usually has an adverse effect upon educational achievement; 
however, Lee's study did not attempt to measure the educational achieve¬ 
ment of the two groups.

In our own province a recent study conducted in four school 
divisions adjacent to Calgary compared achievement of vanned and unvanned 
pupils at the grade two, four and six levels using the appropriate forms 
of the Stanford Achievement Test as measuring instruments. From this study 
Hunka' found that there was a significant difference in educational 
achievement over a fourteen month period between vanned and unvanned grade 
two children with the results favoring the unvanned group. At the grade 
four and six levels there was no significant difference in achievement 
between the vanned and the unvanned groups. 

This study compares the achievement of vanned and unvanned pupils 
in arithmetic, reading and language at three grade levels. It also attempts 
to determine if there is a significant difference in school attendance 
between the two groups.

CHAPTER II 


EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN 

An investigation of the school achievement of rural pupils in 
four school divisions of the Calgary area was conducted between January 1956 
and April 1957* by The Committee on Educational Research, Faculty of 
Education, University of Alberta. The main study called for the testing 
of two hundred pupils (in each of grades two, four and six) who were 
vanned to school daily, and an equivalent number of pupils (at the same 
grade levels) who did not require transportation. Division of the pupils 
in each grade into control and experimental groups was determined by the 
transportation factor. 

The Stanford Achievement Tests and Otis Quick Scoring Tests of 
Mental Ability were used to give quantitative measures of educational 
achievement and intelligence for the control and experimental groups. 
Information regarding attendance was obtained from personal data sheets 
compiled by the teachers. 


THE TESTS 

To determine the gains in educational achievement forms K and J 
of the Primary, Elementary, Intermediate Partial and Advanced partial 
batteries of the Stanford Achievement Tests were administered at the 
appropriate grade levels. To assure uniformity the scoring of the papers 
and tabulation of results were carried out at the Faculty of Education. 

The Primary battery of the Stanford Achievement Test consists of

five subtests: Paragraph Meaning, Word Meaning, Spelling, Arithmetic 
Computation and Arithmetic Reasoning. A subtest in Language is added to 
the Elementary, Intermediate Partial and Advanced Partial batteries. 

Grade scores for each subtest were obtained from the raw scores 
of the Stanford Achievement Test and the scores from the respective 
subtests were combined to give average scores in reading and arithmetic 
in grades two and four, and in reading, arithmetic and language in grade 
six. These scores, multiplied by ten to facilitate calculation, were 
used for the statistical analysis in this study. 

The designers of the Stanford Achievement Test state that the test 
is a good measure of pupil achievement in commonly accepted basic skills 
and understandings. Hanna and Norcross^ agree that the spelling, word 
usage and arithmetic content of the Stanford Achievement Test are quite 
adequate; however, they also indicate that the reading section of the test 
could be improved by better selection of content. 

Reliability coefficients for the various subtests within the

THE SAMPLE 

Two groups of children of approximately two hundred in each group 
at the grade two, four and six levels were obtained from the population 
of four school divisions in the Calgary area. One of the groups at each 
grade level was conveyed to school by vans; the other was not.

The children in the vanned group resided on farms and in hamlets. 
The unvanned group resided in towns and small villages in which centralized 
schools were operating. 

Initially the plan called for the testing of two hundred children 
in each grade and group. To obtain this number all the children at the 
grade two, four and six levels were tested in January 1956 and again in 
April 1957* During the fourteen month period it was found that some 
children had moved away and that for many others there were incomplete 
sets of scores. Consequently it was not possible to retain the original 
sample size.

experimental groups with scores sufficiently complete for inclusion in

The main study was concerned with an analysis of the differences 
in educational achievement between the vanned and unvanned groups at the 
three grade levels. 

This study is concerned with an analysis of the differences in 
educational achievement of the same groups for each subject tested. The 
subjects are arithmetic and reading in grades two and four, and arithmetic, 
reading and language in grade six. It also attempts to determine if there 
is a significant difference in school attendance between the control and 
the experimental groups. 

The null hypotheses to be tested by this study are: 

1. There is no significant difference in educational 
achievement in arithmetic and reading in grades two and 
four, and In arithmetic, reading and language in grade 
six over a fourteen month period as measured by the 
Stanford Achievement Test as between children who 
travel to school on vans and those who do not. 

2. There is no significant difference in the number of days 
of school attendance by pupils of grades two, four and 
six whether they travel by school van or not. 






CHAPTER III 


STATISTICAL TREATMENT 


In the first study the analysis of covariance technique was used 
to compare the achievement of the experimental and control groups. This 
method was employed because it made possible comparisons which could not 
otherwise be made because of unequal groups. 

In this study the January 1956 and April 1957 grade scores in 
arithmetic, reading and language, for both groups were used as the data 
for further analysis using the same technique. 

The assumptions necessary for the validity of analysis of 
covariance procedure have been discussed by Hunka^ and are listed below: 

1. The measurements obtained are observed values (of random 
variables) distributed about three mean values. 

2. The effects which contribute to the observed measurements 
are additive. 

3. The observed measurements in each group have a common 
variance. 

4. The observed values are normally distributed. 

5. Scores distribute themselves with equal variance within the 
columns of a regression table when initial and final grade 
scores are correlated. 

6. A linear relationship between initial and final grade scores 
is necessary.

In practice it is extremely difficult to be assured that all the 
assumptions have been adequately met. However, the results of an 
experiment which does not fulfill all these conditions are not completely 
invalidated. 

Failure of any assumption will impair to some extent the standard 
properties on which the widespread utility of the technique depends. 
Since an experimenter could rarely, if ever, convince himself that all 
the assumptions were exactly satisfied in his data, the technique 
must be regarded as approximative rather than exact. 

The assumptions of normality of distribution were tested for both 
experimental and control groups at each grade level. The effects of 
non-normal populations upon the analysis of covariance appear to be 
relatively small but necessitate greater caution in interpreting the 
final results. 

The remaining assumptions of homogeneity of variance, linearity 
of regression between initial and final scores and homoscedasticity also 
received statistical validation in this study. 

TEST OF LINEARITY 

A correlation table was constructed to determine whether there 
was a linear relationship between the initial and final grade scores. 

The correlation coefficient and correlation ratio were calculated, and 
from these sums of squares due to regression and about the regression 
line were computed. The ratio of the sums of squares was then compared

Analysis of Variance are not Satisfied.' 1 Biometrics , March 19^7» Vol. 3, 
No. 1, p. 37*

to the F distribution. A sample calculation is given in Appendix A. 

The results of the tests for linearity, homoscedasticity, homogeneity, 
normality and covariance appear in table form in Chapter VIII. 

TEST OF HOMOSCEDASTICITY 

Homoscedasticity is obtained when groups of observed scores are 
distributed with equal variance about a common regression line. This is 
evidenced by equal variance of test scores on the second testing of 
students who on the original testing had similar scores. The final 
analysis was made using Bartlett’s Test and the chi-square distribution.^ 

A sample calculation is given in Appendix B. 

TEST OF HOMOGENEITY 

The test of homogeneity of variance was made to determine whether 
there were any significant differences in the variability of grade scores 
about their group means. The variance of the final test scores of control 
and experimental groups were compared using Bartlett's Test and the chi- 
square distribution.^The importance of this test cannot be underestimated 
since significant differences in variability might lead to too frequent 
rejection of the null hypothesis. A sample calculation appears in 
Appendix C.

TEST OF NORMALITY 


13 


The distribution of the final grade scores for the experimental 
and control groups were tested for normality. Frequencies were tabulated 
for selected class intervals and compared with theoretical expected 
frequencies using the chi-square distribution. A sample calculation 
appears in Appendix D. 


ANALYSIS OF COVARIANCE 


The analysis consists of estimating the variances of scores from 
the April 1957 testing of both groups, correcting these for the initial 
January 1956 scores, and then comparing the unbiased variance estimates 
by using the F. Test. 

The steps followed in the computation of covariance analysis are 
listed below: 

1. Sums of squares for control and experimental groups first 
and second testing were determined. 

2. Sums of squares for control and experimental groups first 
and second testing respectively were combined. 

3. Sums of squares between sample means were calculated. Since 
two means are necessary to establish the regression line of 
the means and since only two means were available, nothing 
remained to account for any sums of squares. The result of 
this calculation comes to zero and consequently was used as 
a check only. 

4. Covariance between first and second testing of vanned and 
unvanned pupils was computed. 

5. The sums of squares were calculated on the basis of a mean 
obtained from pooled first testing grade scores and pooled 
second testing grade scores.

6. Regression coefficients based on sums of squares in each 
group, combined sums of squares and pooled samples were 
calculated and used to modify the sums of squares determined 
by the second testing. 

7. In the final analysis the following calculations were made: 

(a) Difference between control and experimental groups 
when group means were corrected by the use of group 
regression coefficients. 

(b) Differences between control and experimental groups 
when the group means were corrected on the basis of a 
combined or average regression coefficient. 

(c) Difference between group regression. 

When 7(c) shows that there is a significant difference between 
individual regression lines, the combination of regression lines as used 
in 7(b) is not justified. When such occasions arise the results of 7(«0 
are to be considered more valid. The results in each case were tested 
with reference to the F distribution. A sample calculation is given in 
Appendix S.

Results of the tests of linearity indicate that: 

1. Linear relationships were evident between the initial and final 
scores on the Stanford Achievement Tests in arithmetic and 
reading for 171 vanned grade two pupils. The null hypothesis 
of linearity was accepted since F values of 0.242 and 1.539 
could have occurred through chance error more frequently than 
five times out of one hundred.

2. Linear relationships were evident between the initial and 

final scores on the Stanford Achievement Tests in arithmetic 
and reading for 144 unvanned grade two pupils. The null 
hypothesis of linearity was accepted since F values of 0.9 76 
and 0.295 could have occurred through ch a nce error more 
frequently than five out of one hundred times. 

On the basis of these results the assumption of linearity of grade 
scores for the vanned and unvanned groups in arithmetic and reading at the 
grade two level was accepted. 

The test for homoscedasticity of the arithmetic and reading scores 
for the vanned group indicated that the chi-square values of 13.32 and 20.20 
respectively were beyond the 5$ level but not the 1 $ level of significance. 

The test for homoscedasticity of the arithmetic and reading scores 
for the unvanned group indicated that the chi-square values of 31.9^ end 
29.91 respectively were well within the 1$ level of significance. 

The above tests would indicate that the variance of the scores 
obtained in the second testing of pupils who had similar scores on the first 
testing, was not consistent over a selected portion of the class intervals 
used in the correlation tabHe. On this basis it was concluded that the 
grade scores in arithmetic and reading of the vanned and unvanned pupils 
were not distributed with consistency about their common regression line. 

The tests of normality, which compared the observed distributions 
in arithmetic and reading in both the vanned and unvanned groups with a 
theoretical normal distribution, indicated that there was no reason to 
suspect that the frequencies observed were not normally distributed. Since 
none of the chi-square values reached the 5$ level of significance, the 
observed distributions could have occurred because of errors of chance in

normality for covariance analysis was not seriously weakened.

Since the slopes of the regression lines were found to be

Results of the tests of linearity indicate that: 

1. Linear relationships were evident between the initial and 
final scores on the Stanford Achievement Tests in arithmetic 
and reading for 188 vanned grade four pupils. The null 
hypothesis of linearity was accepted since F values of 0.552 
and 0.801 could have occurred through chance error more 
frequently than five times out of one hundred. 

2. Linear relationships were evident between the initial and 





























• • .v

final scores on the Stanford Achievement tests in arithmetic 
and reading for 160 unvanned grade four pupils. The null 
hypothesis of linearity was accepted since F values of 0.272 
and 0.649 could have occurred through chance errors more 
frequently than five out of one hundred times. 

The assumption of linearity, based on the results of these tests 
was considered tenable at the grade four level for the vanned and unvanned 
groups in arithmetic and reading. 

The tests for homoscedasticity for reading of the unvanned group 
and for arithmetic of the vanned group Indicated that the performance 
variability between the test and retest did differ significantly. For the 
other two groups it was concluded that such deviations from the hypothesis 
of perfect homoscedasticity as did occur could be attributed to chance 
factors in sampling. Further analysis and conclusions from these data 
must then recognize the failure of the sample concerned to meet the test 
of comparability. 

The test of normality comparing the observed distributions in 
arithmetic and reading in both vanned and unvanned groups with a theoretical 
normal distribution, indicated that there was no reason to suspect that 
the frequencies observed were not normally distributed, and that the 
differences that were noted could be attributed to chance factors in 
sampling. Therefore, the assumption of normality necessary for covariance 
analysis was considered tenable.

and reading for both vanned and unvanned pupils appear in tables XV

An analysis of table XVIII indicates that there was no significant

reading achievement as measured by the Stanford Achievement Test over a 
fourteen month period. 

The superior achievement in arithmetic of the vanned grade four 

14 

group is not too disturbing when compared with Hunka's findings. His 
study indicated a near significant difference in total achievement at 
the grade four level in favor of the vanned group. It may be reasonable to 
attribute a large measure of this almost significant difference in total 
achievement to the arithmetic sub-test of the total battery.

Results of the tests of linearity indicate that: 

Linear relationships were evident between the initial and 
final scores on the Stanford Achievement Test in arithmetic 
for the vanned and unvanned group,in reading and language 
for the unvanned group. On the basis of these test results 
the null hypothesis that there exists a linear relationship 
was accepted.

• "... ;; ' ,j. V

Non-linear relationships were evidenced between the initial 
and final scores in reading and language for the vanned group. 
The null hypothesis was rejected at the 5$ level of significance 
for reading and at the 1 fo level for language. The results of 
the tests indicating non-linearity for the reading and language 
subjects in the vanned groups places some doubt upon the 
validity of using the assumption of linear regression as the 
basis for equating these groups for their initial test scores. 

Results of tests measuring the degree of homoscedasticity for reading 
and language in the unvanned group indicated that there was no reason to 
suspect significantly different variances of second testing scores for 
pupils who had similar scores on the initial testing. However, the 
contrary was observed for reading and language scores for the vanned group 
and for arithmetic scores in both the vanned and unvanned groups. 


The tests of normality which compared the observed distributions in 


arithmetic, reading and language in both vanned and unvanned groups to a 

theoretical normal distribution indicated the following results: 

1. There was no reason to suspect that the distribution of grade 
scores in arithmetic for the vanned and unvanned groups and 
the reading scores in the vanned group was not normal. 


2. There were definite indications that the reading grade scores 
for the unvanned group and the language grade scores for both 
vanned and unvanned groups, were not normally distributed. 

The results of tests of homogeneity of variance of grade scores in 


arithmetic, reading and language for both vanned and unvanned pupils appear

CHAPTER VII 


ATTENDANCE OF VANNED AND UNVANNED PUPILS 


One of the factors affecting pupil achievement is attendance. To 
determine whether there was any significant difference in attendance 
between the vanned and the unvanned groups at the grade two, four, and 
six levels, a study of attendance was carried out. 

The computation for comparing differences between means was based 
on that of a critical ratio as outlined by Garrett.^ In order that the 
analysis involving critical ratios be justified, a test of homogeneity of 
variances was made. This test was made according to the method outlined 
by Kenney and Keeping.^ A summary of computations is contained in 
Table XXXI.

On the basis of these results the null hypothesis, that vanned 
and unvanned pupils could have come from populations of equal variance 
in attendance, was accepted. Therefore,the use of the critical ratio 
test for differences between attendance means was justified. 

A summary of the results of the differences between mean 
attendance of vanned and unvanned groups for grades two, four, and six 
is given in Table XXXII.

On the basis of these results it can be concluded that there was 
a significant difference in mean attendance favoring the unvanned group 
at the grade six level. 

The fact that the vanned grade six pupils attended fewer days 
may be partly accounted for by the practice of keeping farm boys at 
home to assist with the seeding and harvesting operations. The con¬ 
clusion that there were no significant differences in attendance 
between vanned and unvanned grade two and four groups is partial justifi¬ 
cation of vanning of rural pupils and the centralization of rural schools.

CHAPTER VIII 


CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FURTHER STUDY 

The results of the analysis of covariance have been summarized in 
a series of tables given below. A study of these tables will indicate the 
result of the covariance tests and also the degree to which the data 
satisfy the basic assumptions on which the analysis is based.

linearity, normality and homogeneity of the data for grade two in

groups in reading and arithmetic could not be considered to have been met. 
Since all conditions prerequisite to an analysis of covariance design had 
not been fully satisfied the results of the final analysis must be 
interpreted with some caution. 

The results of the analysis of covariance indicated that there 
was a significant difference in pupil achievement at the grade two level 
in arithmetic and reading over the fourteen month period in favor of the 
unvanned group.

that the results of the final analysis are to be interpreted with some 
reservation. 

The covariance analysis indicated that there was a significant 
difference in arithmetic achievement at the grade four level favoring the 
vanned group as measured by the Stanford Achievement Test over a fourteen 
month period. However, for the same groups there was no significant 
difference in reading achievement.

It would appear that the distributions of grade scores in 
arithmetic, reading and language for grade six do not meet the 
assumptions of linearity, nomality, and homoscedasticity as adequately 
as did the distributions for grades two and four. 

The results of the grade six analysis of covariance test 
indicated that there were no significant differences in arithmetic, 
reading and language achievement as measured by the Stanford Achieve¬ 
ment Test over a fourteen month period. 

ATTENDANCE 

The results of the tests measuring the difference of mean 
attendance between vanned and unvanned groups indicated that there was 
a significant difference between means of the control and experimental 
groups in grade six. No significant difference in mean attendance was 
evident for groups in grades two and four. The assumption of homogeneity 
of variance was considered valid on the basis of the test used. 

DISCUSSION 

The results of the covariance analysis at the grade two level 
indicated that there was a significant difference in arithmetic and 
reading achievement between 171 vanned and 144 unvanned pupils as 
measured by the arithmetic and reading sub-tests of the Stanford Achieve¬ 
ment Test over a fourteen month interval. The results in both instances 
were in favor of the unvanned groups. The results were considered 
significant since the null hypothesis was rejected at the .01 level of 





significance. 


41 


These results should be interpreted cautiously since the assumption 
of homoscedasticity was not fully met. The results indicated that the 
range of variability of the pupils’ second testing scores was dependent 
upon the value of their initial test scores, and that this variability was 
not constant. 

The following factors in varying degrees could have affected the 
results of the test of homoscedasticity: 

1. The nature of the test. 

2. The effects of increasing individual differences. 

3. The effects of differentiated teaching. 

4. The degree of teaching at home by the parents. 

Since a pupil’s achievement in arithmetic and reading might also 
be affected by intelligence and school attendance, it was found necessary 
to take these factors into consideration. It has been shown in this study 
that there were no significant differences in mean attendance between the 
vanned and unvanned groups. A separate study conducted by Dunlop, Harper 
and Hunka*^ indicated that there were no significant differences in 
intelligence between the two groups as measured by the Otis Quick Scoring 
Test of Mental Ability. The results of the covariance analysis therefore 
cannot be attributed to the factors of attendance and intelligence.

Assuming that the experimental design held constant all the 
important variables but that of vanning, it can only be concluded that 
the act of vanning and factors associated with vanning appear to be 
responsible for the differences observed. However, it is not possible 
to determine whether fatigue due to time on the van or lengthening of 
the school day, or psychological isolation from the home would have the 
greatest impact. 

The results of the analysis of covariance at the grade four level 
indicated that there was a significant difference in arithmetic achieve¬ 
ment between the vanned and unvanned groups as measured by the arithmetic 
sub-test of the Stanford Achievement Test. The results were in favor of 
the vanned group. However, there was no significant difference in reading 
achievement as measured by the reading sub-test of the Stanford Achieve¬ 
ment Test. 

Non-homoscedasticity in the distribution of the arithmetic scores 
of the vanned group and the reading scores of the unvanned group was 
observed. The caution necessary in the interpretation of the covariance 
analysis as mentioned in the case of grade two also applies here. 

The superiority of the vanned group in arithmetic achievement 
cannot be attributed to a higher level of competence prior to the initial 
testing since the analysis of covariance, in effect, equated both groups 
to a common level of competency on the basis of the initial test results. 
Nor can the differences observed be attributed to differences in 
intelligence and attendance since it has already been indicated that 
these two factors were not operative at the grade four level in the

sample. However, this superior achievement in arithmetic may be 
attributed in part to the greater opportunities for children of this age 
group who live on farms to obtain a practical knowledge of arithmetic 
through their experiences. In this connection the difference between 
group means for total achievement, as reported by Hunka, was almost 
significant at the 5$ level in favor of the vanned group. It would 
seem tenable that a large portion of the almost significant difference 
could have been contributed by the arithmetic sub-test of the total 
battery. 

There appears to be no significant difference in the reading 
achievement of vanned and unvanned pupils as measured by the reading 
sub-test of the Stanford Achievement Test. Consequently, it may be 
concluded with reasonable assurance that vanning does not have any 
recognizable affect on reading achievement at the grade four level. 

On the basis of the analysis of covariance results of the 
arithmetic, reading and language sub-tests of the Stanford Achievement 
Test in grade six, there was little evidence to suggest that vanning had 
a deleterious affect upon achievement. This hypothesis is enhanced by 
the fact that there was a significant difference in mean attendance 
favoring the unvanned group. The fact that the vanned group generally 
speaking attended fewer days but obtained a level of achievement compar¬ 
able to that of the unvanned is significant in itself. 

In view of the fact that the distributions of scores in reading

44 

and language could not completely satisfy the basic assumptions necessary 
for the analysis of covariance, it would appear that these sub-tests do 
not effectively measure achievement in Alberta schools at the grade six 
level. Part of the inadequacies observed in the distributions of grade 
scores in reading and arithmetic may be attributed to differences in 
curriculum between the Alberta sample and the group from which the norms 
were obtained. 

On the basis of these results it can be concluded that transpor¬ 
tation of pupils by bus from rural areas to consolidated schools does not 
adversely affect their achievement in arithmetic, reading and language 
at the grade six level when compared to the results of similar students 
who are not transported. 

The results of this study indicated that transportation of grade 
two pupils produced a lowering effect upon their achievement in 
arithmetic and reading. It may be safe to assume that these same effects 
would be present to some degree at the grade one and possibly at the 
grade three level. 

Although the results showed that vanning had a lowering effect 
upon achievement in the subjects tested at the grade two level, it was 
also shown that this situation was not evident at the grade four and 
six levels. It may be safely assumed that the disadvantages of vanning 
upon achievement appear to be present only during the lower elementary 
school years. The findings of this study would tend to endorse, in part, 
the practice of transporting pupils to centralized schools as followed 
by divisional boards in the Province of Alberta during the past twenty

years. 


45 


It is recommended that further research in the area of school 
vanning should attempt to determine the extent to which vanning affects 
pupils at the other grade levels and to isolate the factors responsible 
for lowering the level of achievement at the grade two level. Additional 
information could be obtained by tests measuring the degree of fatigue 
and the quality of adjustment of vanned pupils. Future studies related 
to achievement of vanned pupils should attempt to collect data regarding 
factors contributing to the lengthening of the school day. Measuring 
instruments, particularly in the fields of reading and language beyond 
the elementary grade level should be carefully selected with due regard 
to validity and statistical reliability.

NORMAL 


To calculate the theoretical normal distribution which is used 


for the goodness of fit test the following steps were taken: 









































(i) Calculation of the t values 
t = y - y where 

Sy 

y - the mid-values of the score taken from a 
frequency distribution table, 
y— _ the mean of the y values 
S y - the standard deviation of the y variable. 

(ii) The theoretical probability of the number of cases falling 
between successive t values was then calculated. 

(iii) The ^ test was then used to describe the goodness of fit 

between the observed values (f Q ) and the theoretical value (f e ). 
The tabulated 5% value of the ^ 2 distribution for 8 degrees 
of freedom is 15•507* Since the observed value of ~ is 
below the 15*50? there is no evidence to support the thesis 


that the observed distribution is not normal. 





APPENDIX E 


57 


SAMPLE CALCULATION OF THE ANALYSIS OF COVARIANCE 
Before the actual steps in the analysis of covariance were 
undertaken the sums of squares, cross products and means of the grade 
scores for the vanned and unvanned groups were computed. These values 
are tabulated in Table XXXVI.

The information from the above table was then used to calculate 


the variances and covariances within each group and the regression 
coefficients needed for equating both groups for initial test scores. 
The steps were as follows:
