PREFACE 

This thesis contains a description of an upper Cretaceous 
flora from the upper part of the Edmonton formation ( Lance 
equivalent in part ?) of Maestrichtian (?) age, found along the 
banks of the North Saskatchewan River near Genesee, Alberta, 
about 40 miles upstream, from Edmonton, 

The subject material for this thesis had already been 
collected by the University of Alberta and afforded an excellent 
opportunity to describe species from one horizon in the upper 
Edmonton formation. W.A. Bell ( Geol. Surv, Bull., No. 13> 1949#) 
has done a study on both Cretaceous and Paleocene flora of Western 
Canada, and this study brackets the Genesee floral horizon. The 
Genesee flora^. however, contains additional important genera and 
species worthy of description. 

Both flora and floral micro-structures such as spore cases, 
spores, pollen grains and cuticles are relatively abundant in the 
continental upper Cretaceous deposits of Western Canada. Hence 
there is an opportunity for an extensive paleobotanical study of 
Cretaceous and eventually other flora with the ultimate goal of 
figured specimens for correlative work.

CHAPTER 1 


STRATIGRAPHIC RELATIONS OF THE GENESEE FLORA 
1. THE EDMONTON FORMATION 


The flora from Genesee, Alberta occurs in the Edmonton form¬ 
ation. Tyrrell described and named the Edmonton formation as "soft 
whitish sandstones and white or grey, often arenaceous clays, with 
bands and nodules of clay ironstone and numerous seams of lignites”. 

( Tyrrell 1887, p. 127 E). 

” The top of the formation is marked by an extensive coal 
deposit.... The bottom of the series lies conformably on the Pierre 
shales, without any sharp line of demarcation between the two” (idid, 
p. 132 1 ) The Pierre shales referred to belong to the Bearpaw 
formation, and the upper most coal deposit is known as the Ardley 
seam. Williams and Dyer ( 1930, p.44) amplify the above descriptions 
from southern Alberta as follows: ”The composition of the Edmonton 
beds varies greatly both laterally and vertically. The formation 
consists of thin alternating beds of white and pale grey, argillaceous 
sands, arenaceous shales, carbonaceous shales and coal. There are 
thin pure beds of bentonite as well as bentonitic shales and sand¬ 
stones”. 

In the Plains region, the Edmonton has been assigned a maximum 
thickness of 1,225 feet ( Allan, J.A., 1924* p* 38 ), and a mean of 
about 1,000 feet. From wells drilled, the thickness of the Edmonton 


CO-lcu/ccted to be 

in the vicinity of the outcrop area near Genesee, Alberta^is A approx¬ 
imately 1,500 feet. 

The Edmonton formation has been divided into an upper, middle 
and lower portion,* The dividing line between upper and middle member 


is determined by a lithologic marker bed known as the Kneehills tuff,

2. THE KNEEHILLS TUFF 

This volcanic tuff horizon was outlined by J.O. Sanderson in 
the Drumheller area in 1924* The tuff in this area forms a conven¬ 
ient and widespread boundary plane separating the Upper and Middle 
members of the Edmonton formation. The Middle Edmonton member is 
composed of all the beds from the top of the Drumheller marine 
tongue up to the top of the bentonitic shale containing the tuff beds. 
The uppermost bed of the Middle member is a dark grey to mauve- black 
shale, which included near its base the thin persistant tuff layer. 

It is underlain by a prominent white bentonitic sandstone. The tuff 
bed occuring in the upper mauve shale is her e named the Kneehills 
tuff because of its numerous outcrops on Kneehills Creek and its 
branches. 

« X 

The tuff is a pale grey, massive rock of very fine grain; seldom 

(taU) 

over 8 inches in thickness. The ask/bed is not entirely continuous, 
but it is nearly so. The rock is hard and can be trimmed like an 
igneous rock; when struck with the hammer it rings. The ash layer does 
not weather readily but breaks into sharp edged, angular fragments 
and forms a surface talus. The ash was deposited underwater and in 
some cases shows a roughly horizontal fracture, but more usually is 
without sign of any structure or bedding. The appearance and proper¬ 
ties of the ash are uniform wherever it has been observed. A similar 
thin stratum of ash was discovered by Sanderson in the Cypress Hills, 

in rocks which are apparently of the same age as those enclosing the 
u 

Kneehills tuff. 

The volcanic ash of the Red Deer region and that from Cypress 
Hills has been analysed for the various oxides and have proved to be 

A loop. 5’2 < '2S'Q.( S/

( Analysed by Win* Gerrie, Toronto University, 1927*) 

The remarkably high percentage of silica in this rock is difficult to 
explain* No unaltered extrusive rock contains so much silica and so 
little alumina* The maximum percentage of silica observed in 5 
analysis of pumicites by H.S. Washington, ( U.S. Geol* Surv., Prof. 
Paper 14, 1903) is 79.48, while the minimum percentage of alumina in 
pumicate was found to be 11*60. The suggestion is made here that the 
ash was high in silica as deposited and very porous, and that since 
deposition the pore space has been taken up by secondary silica in the 
form of chalcedony or opal, leached from the adjacent beds. 

Microscopically, the Kneehills tuff is seen to be made up of 
minute, fresh mineral fragments, apiartz and feldspar mainly, with 
varying proportions of altered glass all set in a felty groundmass 
which is isotropic to dimly anisotropic* It is thought that the 
ground mass is made up essentially of devitrified glass along with 
minute masses of fibres of redeposited chalcedonic or opaline silica. 
The characteristic shape of glass n shards”; long, stringy fragments, 
crescentic bits of angular particles showing reenterant angles; may 
be noted among the grains that remain isotropic under cross nicols* 










-4- 


The rock is commonly vuggy, the vugs being either filled or 

S 

lined with chalcedony, or lined with chalcedony and filled with 
r- 

bentonite. Occurrences of the latter kind, suggest the derivation 
of the colloidal clay bentonite from decomposed volcanic glass. 

The origin of the Kneehills ash is not as yet known. Its fine 
size makes it possible that the volcanoesfrom which it was ejected may 
have been hundreds of miles away. J. Udden ( n The Mechanical Compos¬ 
ition of Wind Deposits* 1 , Augustana Library Publication Wo. 1, p. 65, 
1893) has shown experimentally that dust particles from I /64 to l/36 
mm. diameter may be carried 1000 miles by moderately strong winds. 

The larger particles of the Edmonton ash are from l/20 to 1/36 mm. 
diameter. Volcanos which were active during Edmonton time are known 
in Montana and possibly west of the Rocky Mountains. 

The Kneehills tuff correlative has been found in various other 
localities besides the two above mentioned areas. This tuff bed is 
known from the vicinity of Whitecourt on the Athabaska River. In the 
latitude of Genesee the Kneehills tuff outcrops 25 miles east of 
Genesee, on Strawberry Creek a tributary of the Worth Saskatchewan 
River about 140 miles northwest of Drumheller, 

3. LOCAL ASPECTS OF THE F0SSILIFSR0US BEDS OF GENESEE 

In as much as the Kneehills tuff outcrops to the east of 
Genesee and the Paleocene contact lies to the west of Genesee it may 
be assumed that the Genesee flora belongs to the upper member of the 
Edmonton formation. 

Professor E.W. Berry, ( Trans, Roy. Soc. Gan., Vol. 20, Sec. IV, 
p, 189, 1926) has determined a number of fossil plants from the 
upper part of the Edmonton, collected from various parts of Alberta,

which are in collections at the University of Alberta. One of these 
collections include the following from the Pembina River at Evansburg, 
30 miles northwest of Genesee.

The above flora is less than 50 feet below the top of the Edmonton. 

In the Drumheller area, the Ardley coal seam occurs near the top 
of the Edmonton formation and lies in the upper Edmonton member. The 
coal seam lies about 150-240 feet above the Kneehills tuff bed and 
50-140 feet below the top of the Edmonton. Correlatives of the Ardley 
seam outcrop on the North Saskatchewan river, west of Genesee, Alberta, 
where it is termed the n Big Seam”. Other terminology is used for the 
Ardley correlative such as .the n Pembina n seam near Evansburgj and the 
n Wabamum" seam which outcrops in the vicinity of Lake Wabamum, west 
of Edmonton. The Big Seam also outcrops just downstream from the 
Genesee floral locality in a local flexure ( Slump?) known as the coal 
arch. This places the Genesee in subjacent proximity to the Ardley 
seam. During the 194& field season C.M. Sternberg, ( Geological 

i 

Survey, Paper 47-1) found the rep&t'le Trice rat ops in the upper Edmonton 
member, below the Ardley seam and above the Kneehills tuff. This 
showed Sanderson's division between Middle and Upper Edmonton members

to represent a distinct faunal break. The Qrnithischia . especially 
the Ceratopsia , evolved very rapidly and, therefore, are splendid 
horizon markers, Triceratops is a well known genus from the Lance 
formation of Wyoming, and its presence in the Upper Edmonton beds 
shows that this member must be considered a Lance equivalent. Parts 
of three skulls of Triceratops were collected between the tuff bed 
and the Ardley coal seam. One specimen of Triceratops was collected 
approximately 55 feet above the tuff bed. Teeth of Leptoceratops , 

vertebrae and limb bones of Theseelosauras * phalanges of Ornithominus , 

n 

and a skeleton of T yranosaura s? were collected or observed. Tyranno ¬ 
saurus lay 45 feet below the Ardley seam. Hadrosaurus appear to be 
very scarce, no remains were seen in the Upper Edmonton member, whereas 
in all lower beds Hadrosaurs are by far the most common forms. Thescel - 
osaurus edmontonensis has been determined to have come from the Upper 
Edmonton member near the base of the thick sandstone bed just above 
the tuff. Wo bones of Thescelosaurus have ever been observed below 
this tuff bed, A skull of the Lance genus Ankylosaurus and a fragment¬ 
ary skeleton of Leptoceratops gracilis have both come from above the 
tuff bed. Only one known Middle Edmonton OAthischian genus, that is, 
Anatosauras continued to Lance time. 

The presence of Triceratops, Tyranosaurus , Thescelosaurus, and 
Ankylosaurus in the Upper Edmonton shows conclusively that these beds 
are of Lance age, 

4. THE LANCS FORMATION 

The Lance Creek area was first brought into scientific literature 
by J.B. Hatcher, ( American Journal of Science, 3rd. ser., Vol. 45,

135-144* 1893)* who had collected a large suite of dinosaur remains 
there between 1889 and 1895. Before the publication of Hatcher f s 
paper, O.G. Marsh, ( American Journal of Science, 3a series, Vol. 37, 

334, 1889-) had described several species of Triceratops 

( originally called Ceratops ) and other vertebrates from Hatcher’s 
collections; he had failed, however, to specify the locality from 
which these specimens had been obtained, other than they were, ’’from 
the Geratops beds in Wyoming.” It remained for Hatcher to locate the 
area, and to describe in detail the lithological characters and sketch 
the areal boundaries of the beds which had yielded dinosaur remains* 
Regarding the stratigraphic position of the ” Geratops beds”, Hatcher 
stated: ” All the beds of the entire section are conformable, and 
bear evidence of continuous deposition, from the Fort Pierre shales 
up through the Fox Hills sandstones and the overlying freshwater 
Ceratops beds”. 

T.W. Stanton and F.H. Knowlton visited the area and made 
collections of invertebrates and plants from both the ” Geratops 
beds” and adjacent strata. The reports on this visit were published 
in 1897. ( Geol. Soc. Amer. Vol. 8, 127-156, 1897) At this time 
Knowlton regarded the plants as indicative of the ” tru© Laramie” 
age of the ” Geratops beds”, that is, equivalent to the Upper 
Cretaceous Laramie formation of the Denver basin, and of the same 
age as the plant-bearing ” Black Buttes beds” of southwestern 
Wyoming. The stratigraphic section, as observed by Stanton and 
Knowlton, showed a conformable sequence from the Pierre shales up 
through the Fox Hills sandstone, the ” Ceratops beds” and finally

the " Fort Union group 1 '. The 11 Fort Union" age of the beds over- 
lying the " Ceratops beds" was determined through plant evidence and 
on the absence of dinosaur remains. 

In 1909,F.H. Knowlton changed his opinion concerning both the 
stratigraphic relations and age of the Lance beds. He concluded.... 

" 'Lance Greek beds' of Wyoming, their stratigraphic and paleontologic 
equivalents elsewhere, are to be regarded as constituting the lower 
member of the Fort Union formation and are Eocene in age", from 
later investigations it was discovered that there was a mixing of 

A 

floras. Although the obviously mixed collection of Lance Creek 
specimens did not add any appreciable weight to his argument, Knowlton 
was by this time thoroughly convinced by accumulated evidence from 
elsewhere that the flora of the " Ceratops beds" and their supposed 
equivalents elsewhere could not be distinguished from the Fort Union 
flora. 

In 1910, T.W. Stanton first applied the name Lance formation to 

a 

the " Ceratops beds". At this time he also estimated the thickness 
of the Lance formation at 2,100 to 2,200 feet. 

Within the next few years the controversy concerning the 
Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary in the western interior reached its 
climax. 

In the summer of 1914* R.S. Lull visited the Lance Creek area, 
and subsequently published an excellent summary of the known vertebrate 
remains, ( Amer. Jour. Sci., 4th series, Vol. 40, 319-348* 1915.) both 
mammalian and dinosaurian which had been collected from the Lance 
formation of the region. The chief contribution of this report was

the observation that the mammalian remains had been collected from 
the same zone that had yielded the dinosaur remains, and were 
uniformly distributed throughout the entire Lance formation. Emphas¬ 
izing the relationship of the mammals, Lull regarded these as sub¬ 
stantiating the testimony of the dinosaurs for the Mesozoic age of 
the beds. 

The Lance mammalian fauna is regarded by G.G, Simpson, ( Mem, 
Peabody Mas, Nat, Hist,, Vol. 3, part 1, 97-139, 14o> 149, 150, 1929.) 
as of latest Cretaceous age. The dinosaurs of the area were again 
discussed in 1930 by L, Russell, ( Proc. Amer. Philos. Soc., Vol. 69 , 
139 - 141 , 1930.) who listed the 19 species known and discussed their 
relation to other faunas. He concluded that the Lance formation, as 
originally defined in the Lance Greek area, is equivalent in Montana 
and Dakotas to only the Hell Greek beds, and that the Tullock and 
Cannonball should be provisionally included in the Paleocene. That 
the Tullock and Ludlow beds, generally regarded as the upper member 
of the Lance formation in regions to the north of the Lance Greek area, 
are of early Paleocene age has recently been substantiated by foramin- 
iferal studies of the marine Cannonball beds, which interfinger west¬ 
ward into the Ludlow. 

The systematic position of the Lance species, in so far as it 
is believed to be determined, is shown in the following lists ( E, 

Dorf, Contributions to Paleontology, 97-98, 1942.)

The flora listed above is apparently from an aggregate collected 
from both above and below the Kneehills tuff. 

However, Bell claims that the Edmonton formation carries two 
floras, which lie respectively below and above the Kneehills tuff 
member which has been correlated lithologically with the Battle 
( Blackmud) formation of southeastern Alberta. The lower flora 
indicates an age approximately that of the Fox Hills formation of 
Montana, whereas the Upper Edmonton flora is correlated with the 
flora of the Lance formation of Wyoming. Composite lists taken from 
Bell, from several localities reveals this postulated division of 
the Edmonton flora. 

The known flora is limited to about 24 species, distributed 
among 14 families and 20 genera. Equisitae are represented by 1 
species, ferns by 2, cycadophytes by 3, ginkgophytes by 3 ? conifers 
by b, and dicotyledons by 10. Of the conifers, gequoiites and 
Elatojrfcladus intemedius are particularly abundant in the lower part 
of the formation. Among dictyledonous trees Platanus is a common

genus in the upper part of the formation. Dombeypsis and Vitis 
are plentiful and widespread in the lower part, but, if the species 
concerned are correctly referred to these genera, they are presumably 
climbing plants and not arboreous. 

The flora of the lower part of the Edmonton has 18 species, 
namely: 

Equisetum perlaevigatum Cockerell 
Nilssonia sp. 

Nilssonia serotina Heer 
Ginkgoites sp. 

Carpolithus ( Ginkgoites?) fultoni Bell 
Garpolithus ( Ginkgoites?) kneehillensis Bell 
Torreyites tyrrellii Dawson 
Cunning hamiostrobus ? sp.

Sequoiites dakotensis Brown 
Elatocladus internedius Hollick 
Thuites interruptus Newberry 
Juniper!tes gracilis 
Trochodendroides arctica Heer 
Jenkinselia arctica Heer 
Dombeyopsis nebrascensis Newberry 
Nymphaeites angulatus Newberry 
Vitis stantoni Brown 

Although none of these species if taken singly, is of value for 
precise age determination, the assemblage as a whole is most 
characteristic of formations having an age approximately that of 
the Fox Hills of the United States. Some of the species are of 
value for correlating other formations, as, for example, the 
Brazeau within the province. The most important species for this 
purpose are: Equisetum perlaevigatum . Nillsonia serotina . Sequoiites 
artus , Elatocladus internediu s, and Dombeyopsis nebrascensis . The 
age of the lower Edmonton is fixed by that of the Lance equivalent 
above and of the marine Bearpaw below. 

The upper Edmonton ( Lance equivalent) flora comprises:

Platanus raynoldsii intejferifolia Lesq. 

Platonaphyllum sp. 

Anona robusta Lesq.

Of these 9 species, 3, namely, Seguoiites dakotensis . Nymphafetes 
angulatus , and Vitis stantoni, occur in the lower Edmonton. Platanus 
raynoldsii intejfe rifo lia is probably also too long-ranging to be of 
much value for refined age correlation. There remain only four 
diagnostic species, viz.: Filicites knowltoni , Garpolithus ceratops, 

Anona robusta . and Fraxinus leii . These are all characteristic forms 
in the Lance formation, and two of the most diagnostic forms, Garpolithus 
ceratops and Fraxinus leii occur in the Frenchman formation. It is 
concluded therefore that the upper part of the Edmonton formation is 
equivalent in age to the Frenchman formation of Saskatchewan and to 

the Lance formation of Wyoming. 

5. THE POSITION OF THE GENESEE FLORA 

The Genesee floral collection studied was collected from one 

horizon in the upper Edmonton formation. This horizon is bracketed 

by the n Big Seam” above and the Kneehills tuff below; thus the 

Genesee floral horizon occurs within the limits of the upper Edmonton 

formation as defined at Drumheller by Sanderson. The ” Big Seam” is 

approximately 120 feet below the Paleocene-Cretaceous contact on the 
of 

basis^assumed regional dip of 20 feet/nile and the Genesee floral 
horizon is around 160 feet below the Paleocene-Cretaceous contact. 
Therefore the Genesee floral horizon occurs approximately 40 feet 
below the " Big Seam n , and around ISO feet above the Kneehills tuff 0 
























































-16- 


The stratigraphic position of Triceratops , in the Drumheller area, 
is from about 70 feet below the Ardley seam to about 55 feet above 
the Kneehills tuff, at Gofi e oo e y Albort a» The equivalent interval 
( Triceratops zone) of the upper Edmonton formation in the Genesee 
area would include the Genesee floral horizon. Dinosaur tracks occur 
above the"Pembina”coal seam to the northwest; therefore the flora 
would not belong to the latest portion of the Triceratops zone, but 
should be assigned a position about midway in the Triceratops 
zone r as preserved from erosion in the Genesee area*

CHAPTER 2 


1. THE GENESEE ASSEMBLAGE 

The collected flora from Genesee, Alberta present in the 
Geological Museum at the University of Alberta consists of around 
400 specimens. Many species of the Genesee flora are known else¬ 
where in the late Cretaceous and even the early Tertiary deposits 
of North America, from the Rocky Mountain region and Alaska areas, 
Sequoiites 'langsdorfii (Brongniart) Heer is the most prevalent 
species constituting more than l/3 of the collection. There are 63 

specimens of Populus elliptica Newberry amounting to l/5 of the 
th/s 

collection and*was the most prevalent of the Ahgiosperms. The genus 
Trochodendroides ’is represented by 34 specimens and is the next most 
abundant Angiosperm, It is interesting to note that of the Angiosperns, 
the two most prevalent species are very closely related in regard to 
leaf form, venation and other leaf characters. The following species 
which accounted for the remainder, with the number of collected 
specimens bracketed ( under -§■ of the collection ) are listed as 
follows: 

T ypha sp. Dorf (11) 

Slatocladus intermedius Hollick (10) 

Gercidiphvllum ellipticum Newberry (10)

Of the species of Angiospems listed above by far an over¬ 
whelming majority show palmate venation and campt6~~cLromu3 pattern. 
However this writer hesitates to assume this distribution for 
natural statistics as the postulate immediately arises H Do the 
palmate species tend to preserve better than the pinnate forms?" 

The collection dealt with was made for museum purposes and it is 
known that hundreds of specimens were left at the collecting 
locality without further assessment other than that of state of 
preservation, 

2, EVIDENCE OF LANCE’ AGE FROM THE FLORA ITSELF 

Most of the identifiable species from Genesee flora have 

been reported from the Upper Cretaceous of North America, Although 

the Genesee flora contains species which are also present in the 

Paleocene, there are characteristic species-which are considered 

restricted to Lance age elsewhere in North America, The short 

ranging species, which are considered most reliable for correlation 

purposes ( i.e, found in the Lance formation and formations that are 

definitely Lance in age for example Colgate, Hell Creek, Medicine Bow, 

Laramie (part) and Frenchman) and are present in Genesee floral 

assemblage, are listed below: 

Anona ? robusta Lesq, 

Dombeyopsi s colgatensis Brown 

Cercidiphyllum arcticum » Trochodendroides arctica Heer is found in 
the type Lance formation but is restricted elsewhere to Paleocene age.

Vitis stantoni Knowlton is found in beds which overlie the Laramie 
part such as the Arapahoe- Denver and Dawson formations, the Lance 
age of which has been established for a least their lower parts on 
the basis of Triceratops dinosaurs, ( R.3. Lull op. cit., 3/7, 1933.) 
Correlations with the upper Cretaceous beds of Alaska may be made 
by the following species; Menispermites cf. s eptentrionalis : Grew io- 
psis yukonensis Hollick, Protophvllum sp. Martin, and Betulites sp. 
Species which have not yet been reported from Tertiary strata are as 
follows: ( Geol. Soc, of Am., Mem. 51, 1952.) 

.Blatocladus internedius Hollick 

Sequoiites artus n. sp. Bell 

Viburnum si mile Knowlton 

The flora of the Genesee horizon comprises only S species 
which are considered diagnostic for correlation purposes. This 
analysis is, of course, very suggestive of Lance age, but cannot be 
considered conclusive, because of the small number of species in the 
assemblage. However, the number of species of Lance age might have 
been larger had the collection been made with Lance forms as the 
primary objective. Fortunately the pre-Tertiary position of the 
floral suite is well established by the occurrance of Dinosaur tracks 
( University of Alberta, Museum specimen, No. 4&7) above the ** Pembina 
seam” on the Pembina river, and the Pembina floral suite carries 
almost identical element with those found in the Genesee floral suite. 
This would appear indicative that the Genesee floral suite was of 
latest upper Cretaceous age. The suggestion of latest upper Cret¬ 
aceous age would seem to be supported by floral evidence also, as 
the number of species found of Paleocene age (elsewhere) is relatively 
high ( 17 species.) It is interesting to note also that Sequoiites

Cretaceous strata elsewhere. 

In summation the Genesee species which are the best direct 

index of Lance age of the Genesee suite area follows: (2. Dorf, 

Contrib, to Paleontology 122, 1942.) 

Anona? robusta Lesq, 

Dombeyopsis colgatensis Brown 

In addition to these restricted species, there are others 

of wider stratigraphic range so far known in abundance only in 

floras of Lance age in Cretaceous beds, 

Trochodendroides arctica Heer 
Vitis stantoni ( Khowlton) Brown 

3a CLIMATIC CONDITIONS INDICATED BY THE GENESES FLORA 

There are two methods of employing fossil plants as indicators 
of climatic conditions of the past, both methods apply only to 
floras of late Mesozoic or Cenozoic time. These are (1) an 
analysis of the structural characters of the dicotyledonous leaves 
( chiefly size, venation, texture, and marginal characters) as 
compared with modern leaves against known climatic requirements! and 
(2) a generic and specific comparison of fossil species with living 
forms whose climatic requirements are known, on the assumption that 
the past conditions were analagous to those under which the 
majority of the closely related living species grow.

of the

flora with

to marginal 


characters with other floras in the table would seem to indicate a 


warm temperate climate. Indications based on length show a distinct 
lack of specimens over 10 cm, in length and fits closest to the 
Muir Woods condition which is a cool climatic condition. The very 
high percentage of palmate specimens can only be attributed to the 
fact that the flora was intended as a museum collection; however a 
relatively high percentage ( 44 - 46 ) in the table indicates a warn 
temperate condition. The preponderance of Sequoiit es langsdorfii 
( Brongniart) Heer would seem to indicate a cool temperate 
condition to have existed. 

The use of modern correlatives in attempting to determine 
the climatic conditions of Lance time is indicated as follows:

It may be at once observed from the totals of the above list 


that the floral assemblage is cool temperate to warn temperate. 


From the above table only 7 specues of the modern correlatives also 
grow in subtropical regions and only 3 species grow in the tropic 
region. The great preponderance of Sequoiites langsdorfii , Populus 
cf. elliptica , and Trochodendroides are seemingly indicative of 
cool to warn climatic conditions at that time. 


In summary it may be stated that the leaf characters and the 
distribution of modern correlatives of the Genesee species as well 
as the absence or scarcity of typically tropcal and subtropical 
genera, point to cool to warn climatic conditions of growth, more 
nearly approaching the former. That is, the overall climatic 
indication would be that of the latitude of about Southern Ontario.

chapter 3 

1. FORMAL DESCRIPTION OF FLORA 
INTRODUCTORY STATEMENT 

Fossil leaves, stems and cones in the continental upper 
Cretaceous strata of Western Canada are relatively abundant. An 
examination of the upper Cretaceous from Genesee has revealed that 
the available descriptive literature of this flora is still 
incomplete and for this reason the writer has no apology for 
describing this excellent flora from Genesee in considerable detail. 

This chapter deals with the formal description of some of the 
upper Cretaceous forms ( Lance age) collected from one horizon in 
the upper Edmonton, near Genesee, Alberta. The species of flora 
figured and described in this paper, represent only a portion of 
the species present in the Genesee floral horizon and probably do 
not include some of the species which have been figured as 
typical Lance flora elsewhere. 

Recently, Dr, Adriance Foster of the University of California 
has studied the minute details of living leaves by rendering them 
transparent and mounting them in plastic on glass slides. Dr. 

Arthur A. Meyerhoff ( Abstract 1953? Offical Program of the Geolog¬ 
ical Society of America Cordilleran Section.) (Palo .Alto, California) 
utilizing this method, recently completed a study of the leaves of 
90 taxa of living representative of the Betulaceae ( birch family) 
from all parts of the world. 

Of 350 specimens studied, Meyerhoff studied 150 characters 
microscopically and macroscopically. Sight of the 150 characters 
were found very important in leaf identification in the 
Betulaceae . These characters ares nature of the midrib, the leaf

margin, the lowest secondary veins, secondary vein endings, the 
leaf base, the pattern of the tertiary veins, the angle of 
departure of tertiary veins from larger veins, and the distrib¬ 
ution and appearance of the minor or net vein endings. Certain 
measurement ratios were also found helpful. 

Use of the characters mentioned, in combination with lesser 
characters, were applied to five fossil leaf taxa and tentative 
conclusions regarding the usefulness of Foster’s methods were 
drawn. Meyerhoff was able to identify accurately the five fossil 
taxa, of which some had been misidentified. This study showed 
that the comparison of fossils with transparent slides of living 
taxa is a much more accurate method of identification than compar¬ 
ison with leaves on herbarium sheets. Future studies should employ 
extensive use of these slides to insure reliable determinations of 
fossil leaf genera and species. 

The present study of the Genesee flora indicates that 
Foster and Meyerhoffs’ methods may be used successfully in paleo- 
botanical studies of other genera such as those contained in the 
upper Cretaceous floras.

Leaf, sub-orbicular, lobed, undulate-crenate margin. The 
marginal crenae, when well preserved, are capped by a minute 
mucro at the ends of the veins. The primary laterals are opposite 
and arise well above the top of the petiole. There is a variable 
number of basilar, tertiary, camptodromus veins below the primary 
laterals. The blade of the leaf would be about 20 cm. long and 
about the same in width. The primary laterals rise at an angle 
of 35 degrees to the midrib. The leaf is decurrent on the petiole; 
the petiole is missing. The quaternaries form a loose network of 
polygonal cells and the smaller veinlets a finer pattern of poly¬ 
gonal cells.

Leaf petiolate, slightly inequilateral, elliptical, with 

acute apex and cuneate base, some slightly decurrent on petiole, 

entire for variable distance from petiole, rather irregularly 

toothed above; teeth crenulate to acute, separated by shallow 

asymmetric furrows or almost straight, entire intermargins. Mid- 

vein, stout, lmm. broad, straight, gradually thinning to apex. 

Secondaries, 6 to 7 pairs, alternate to subopposite, slightly

flexuous, craspz'dodromus, 20-33 degrees to midribs; lowest pair of 
secondaries provided with 6 or 7 pairs of abaxial branches, ( may 
give a pseudo-trinerved appearance), the lowest branches, where 
margin of leaf is entire being camptodromus; one or two basal, 
camptodromus veins present below these branched secondaries; 
remaining secondaries with fewer and distal branches, tertiaries, 
transverse, mainly percurrent, a few once divided; quaternaries 
form a network of polygonal cells,generally irregular quadrangular 
cells.

GLOSSARY OF BOTANICAL TERMS 


abaxial- the side away from the axis, 

acrodromus- venation strands uniting at the apex of the leaf, 
acuminate- having a gradually diminishing point, 
adaxial- the side next to the axis, 
anustomise- the union of one vein with another, 
attenuate- narrowed, tapered, 

camptodromus- venation in which the secondary veins curve towards 
the margins, but do not form loops. 

cordate- heart shaped, applied to leaves haying petiole at the 

broader and notched end, 

crenate- a rounded tooth or notch. 

crenulate- crenate, but the toothings themselves small, 
crotspedodromus- when the lateral veins of a leaf run from midrib 
to margin without dividing. 

decurrent- when leaves are prolonged beyond their insertion, and thus 
run down into the stem. 

dentate-toothed, especially when salient teeth directed outward. 

distal- remote from the place of attachment, 

distichously- disposed in two vertical rows. 

inosculating- anastomising, joining. 

lofnceolate- narrow, tapering to a point. 

orbicular- with a circular outline. 

palmate- the veins all start at or near the top of the petiole, 
percurrent- extending throughout the entire length, 
petiolate- leaf having a petiole, 

pinnate- with veins arranged each side a common midrib.
