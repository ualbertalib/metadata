the data upon which this study is based* were obtained 
by means oi a survey which was conducted by the Dominion bureau of' 
Agricultural Economics Branch at Ottawa* in co-operation with the Un¬ 
iversity of Alberta and the Provincial Department of Agriculture 
during the summer months of 195b* Tim bulk of the funds which enabled 
the work to be carried out was supplied under the Prairie fans Re¬ 
habilitation Vote in connection with the rehabilitating of the draught 
areas oi the Prairie Provinces* 

1 ample farmers were interviewed in both the Vulcan and the 
Boaond districts by enumerators* Information pertaining to physical

The data were then calculated to obtain the present net

then coded and transferred onto cards for the punched card method 
of analysis. The punched, cards and the Hollrith sorting and b&bul-

2. plze o£. fetuiijila 

The choice of the farm operator from whom the records were 
obtained was at random* Over live hundred such opera'tors were inter¬ 
viewed# A number of schedules however, had to be discarded because 
of incompleteness or evident inaccuracy. Of the total number secured, 
495 records were deemed to be accurate enough for analysis, made up 
of iSJd records fox' the Vulcan district end &61 for the Lomond district. 
The total number of records secured represents 40 to 45 percent of the 
total number of operators in the area, and from Z& to 75 percent of 
farmers on the various dominating classes of soil* In general, the 

number of records for this analysis is therefore adequate and the 
results of the analysis are representative of 'the districts*

for uomond district arid Lethbridge for toe Vulcan district. This in¬ 
formation is presented in Table 11 in toe Appendix* In addition 
the annual precipitation for Edmonton is included for comparison. 

The long-time precipitation figure© are Indicative that 

tne area adjacent to Medicine Hat has experienced a lower average 

' • ’ 

rainfall than the points of Edmonton or Lethbridge. The index of the 
long-time precipitation is found in the soil that surround© these 
points. Lethbridge is found to be in the Bark brown §@11, Medicine 
Hat in the Light Brown and Edmonton in toe Black Boil type. 

The total average precipitation for Edmonton for 55 year© is 
17.7k inches, the 24-year average for Lethbridge is 15.35 inches 
and to® 5&*year average for Medicine Hat is 1£«89 inches. This is 
indicative that the Lomond district lies within m area which is 
normally relatively dry. 

For the growing month© of April, May, June and duly, Leth¬ 
bridge has on the average had 7*45 inches of rainfall based on a 
55-year average, as compared to 8.13 inches for Medicine Hat for a 

corresponding period*

■ 

The B-ye&r moving average is indicative of a decline in 

the amount of precipitation for toe Medicine Hat point, and there 

is an indication that no appreciable increase in the amount of pre- 

. 

cipitation in the near future can be expected. The graphical picture

(Chart 1) also indicates that in the future, at odd periods, mor© 
than an adequate amount of rainfall may be expected, i.e. if past 
experience in this regard is any indication of what may be expected 
in the future* The gra.h also illustrates that climatic variations 
arc broadly amllar in ail parte of the province* The rhythmical 
fluctuation of precipitation of the three points at different locations, 
viz. Moon ton, Lethbridge and Medicine Hat tends to support this arg«* 
ument. However, the 5-year moving average of the total amount of 
precipitation has tended to move down since 1900, although it may¬ 
be noted that the driest period was experienced between i888 and 
1890. This would tend to indicate that under normal conditions 
low precipitation is expected in what is now known as the drought area. 

(c) Boils - The Vulcan and the Lomond districts are contiguous with 
one another and therefore the precipitation belts into which they 
fall are not mutually exclusive, the Vulcan district ales within 
the Dark Brown soil bolt mid the Lomond district within the Brown 
soil baft of Alberta. The lighter nature of the ©oil on the Lomond 
side of make McGregor is sufficient evidence of smaller amounts of 
precipitation over the years than the Vulcan district has experienced# 

In other words, the record of past precipitation is written into 
the soil. It must be remembered, however, that the Lomond district 
is on the edge of the Brown Boil zone.

The area under study is characterised by a threat variety 
of soils’*’** The clay loams, silt loam®, loams, fine sandy loams 

and fine sands are to be found in bath district# *. In addition 
there ars areas widen are denoted as eroded areas, a considerable 

amount oi damage has been done by soil drifting in both districts* 
Wind erosion is most evident in the sandy loans and fine sands* 

The severity of the damage is more evident, however, in the Vulcan 
district, especially around Garmang&y and Baron#* 

The soils within the area studied were classified as 

follows? 


Yule an Pmto&j*

£» Vulcan Loam 
5* Vulcan Silt Loam 
4* Blackspring Slit Loam

X* Armada Clay Loam

4. Sundial Sil t Clay Loam 
d* Lomond fine Sandy Loam 
6* Lomond i?ine Sand 


(1) A soil survey has been carried out in the MacLeod Sheet, but 
not in the Blackfoot# Since only a very limited area lies 
within the Blackfoot Sheet, the soil classification used in 
this study is based entirely on the soil survey of the MacLeod 

Sheet* 

(*.j See figure k page 9. 













u - 


The basis used in this classification was the soil map 1 * 
and the description of the various soils (see appendix ior a general 

description of the broad classes)• However, it seemed advisable to 
make further classifications for this study. Thus the silt loam in 
the Vulcan district was divided into two classes, via. the Vulcan 
silt loam and the Blackspring silt loam, the latter because it is 
more typically a silt loam and the former because it is heavier and 
contains a bit more clay* 

In the Lomond district the Clay loam was divided into 
two categories, vis#, Armada Clay Loam and mast Clay Loam, the former 
because it is a darker and heavier soil type with rougher topography 
and is strewn with boulders and gravelly spots. 

Generally speaking, the soil in the Vulcan district is 
superior to that in the Lomond district. However, some of the soil 
types within the inferior district are of a. superior quality to same 
of the soils within the Vulcan district. Hence, we find that the 
Sundial Silt Olay Loam is superior to that of Carmangey Fine ^and, 
Vulcan Fine &&ndy Loam, etc* In fact in some phases, it surpasses 
in productivity my soil class within the Vulcan district* It may 

be inferred from these last statements that the productivity of the 
soil classes must of necessity be interpreted carefuliy and whereas

a general!lation does apply to the whole district, the reverse conclusion 


may hold for the various soil classes within each district* 

(d) Tonography * The highest point of elevation within the area is 
the Blackspring Bidge, which jJ.ee east of Canoangay and Barons* 

The lowest points are those occupied by temporary lakes between G&r- 
m&ngay ©rid Barone, south of held Hill and southwest of Champion, Lit¬ 
tle how River, Lake MacGregor and the Little Bow Reservoir* The 
whole area is 'undulating except lor Borne hilly portions southwest of 
Lomond, immediately west of Lake MacGregor and the area known as the 
Sundial Butte* The level parts of the area are free from stones, 
but the rolling portions contain isolated stones* There are isolated 
areas of stoniness south of Vulcan and southwest of Kirkcaldy, and 
in tii© hilly section southwest of Lomond. There are also some gravel¬ 
ly portions northeast of Lomond* Except within a few isolated sections, 
topography is no handicap to grain growing, and in fact lends itself 
to the extensive type of farming and the us© of large scale machinery* 

(&) lumbers - The settlement of the „Vulcan district was aore rapid 
and took place much earlier than in the Lomond district* The maximum 
population in the two districts was reached in 1S&U The rural pop¬ 
ulation declined after than year in both districts, whereas the village 

population continued to increase in the Vulcan and decrease in th© 
Lomond district* Taking the density on the per square mile basis,

the density oi population is much greater in the Vulcan than in the 
Lomond district, as the figures in Table 2 indicate (also see Chart IX )« 
The great drop in population since the 1951 census year 
in the Lomond district is due in no small measure to the abandonment 
of xand which has taken place within the district# It is interesting 
to note that the density of population per square mile is below that of 
1911 , when an influx of population took place in no the district*

In tli© Vulcan district 89*7 percent of the total population 
was farm, as compared with 38.5 percent in the Lomond district. 

These figures are much higher than the provincial figures for the 
whole of Alberta. The farm population of the province in 1951 was 51.8 
percent^* of the total population. This 'would seem to indicate that 
the Vulcan district is more mature and the balance between the urban 
and farm population has been established to a greater degree than in 
that of Lomond where the district still has the landmarks of a pioneering 
area. 

v 

(b) Bex Bathos - The ©ex ratios of fee two adjoining districts, also 
give us some indication of the relative maturity and stability of the 
communities within these districts. The more mature and stable 
district of Vulcan had 189 males to lid females In 1908* It dropped 
down to 151 males to iUu females by 1911. By 1951 it nearly reached 
the same proportions as feat fox- the province, vis., in 1951 in Vulcan 
feer© were 128 males to 100 females, as compared with fee whole of 
Alberta, vnich reported a ratio of 121 males bo evexy 100 females. 

The less mature district of Lomond in 1911, had 188 males 
to every IQu females and by 1931 this ratio had changed to 151 males

The figures in the table indicate that the greatest pro¬ 
portion of operators fall in the age gi*oup of 46 - 5u years* 

The range in the average age of farm operators in the two 
major districts and on the individual ©oil belts is not sufficient to 
be of any great significance* It is significant to note however that 
only 7*5 percent of the operators are SO years of age or less, and 
only 11*4 percent are 4u year© or xeas, thus indicating that very few 
young men have been able to* or cared to establish themselves in 
farming operations within this area* In other words# the farm oper¬ 
ators are# in the main, mad© up of the original homesteaders*

It is interesting to note that the greatest percentage 
of the present operators were bom in the United States, A wave of 
potential sutlers migrated from the U.S.A. when this area was opened 
up for homesteading* This was a natural procedure for these settlers 
were nearest the area, from -the geographical point of view. In addition, 
many of these settlers already had had experience in dry farming in 
the Dakotas, Iowa and others of the States which are somewhat similar 
in climatic and physiographic features* This helps to explain the 
higher proportion of the farm operators who had the U.S.A. as their 
country ox bixth* 

The predominating national grou e are British and Boandln- 
avian in both districts as the following tabic indicates*

As the figures in the above table indicate, the size of 

farm has increased from the original holdings of 160 and 520 acres to 

an average of 753 acres in Vulcan and 889 acres in the Lomond district. 

In other words, the average else of farm has increased approximately 

five times in the Vulcan district and six times in the Lomond district. 

The average size of farm for the province of Alberta in 1951 was 400 * 

acres, and the average acreage of improved land per farm for -the prov- 

, JjL 

ince was reported at 181 « 

The average size of farm in this semi-arid area indicates 
that there is no place here for small units arid that probably in the 
future when adjustment becomes more complete the size of farm wi-u. be 

even greater* In other words, it is an area that in all probability 

(1) Seventh Census of" Canada, 1951 - Alberta Census of agriculture, page xi

— «dS — 


will never be ab^e to support a dense population, and if a more desirable 
standard of living is to be forthcoming, large farming plants and & 
sparse population will likely result* 

(b) ^iftnd Tenure - The extension of settlement to new lands, and the 
free land policies, help to explain why there is such & high proportion 
of owners of land among the operators in this area* The figures in Table 
9 indicate that 45 percent of the operator© in Vuican are outright owners 
and 55 percent are part-owners, whereas only percent &r® tenants* 

In the Lomond district the situation is a little different* Here 17 
percent are tenants, 59 percent are owners and 44 percent are part own¬ 
ers* In the area as a whole 81 percent of the operators own ax± their 
land, or gome part of it, and onry 19 percent are tenants* 

The factors which have helped to increase or make the pro¬ 
portion ox tenants as large as it is are unfavorable climatic conditions 
and the original settlement of land which has since become sub-marginal* 
la such cases the owners of land would readily relinquish their holdings 
to othere who were willing to take a chance* likewise a great proportion 
of tenants is likely 'to be found within an area where the original set¬ 
tlers have ceased 'to operate their own farms or have sold them and are 
now quite content to take their income through rent or interest* This 
is likely to b© the case in a stable area where returns are quite certain* 
This in part explains why the proportion of tenants is high in the Vuican 


district*

There Is no doubt that the Vulcan-Lomond area i a mare perm¬ 
anent from the points of view of efficient tend utilisation and maint¬ 
enance of the present institutions than if there were a greater proportion 
of tenants than there is at present* However, the proportion is great enou# 
to give some degree of concern for the stability of these various factors 
especially when 'the area is undergoing or experiencing at present many 
reverses resulting from the presence of untoward climatic conditions, price 
levels and the like* 

(cj .u&nd Use - ^Hiring periods of unstable climatic conditions, pests 
and prices, land use is of no little concern to the governments as well 

as to the respective communities in. which such unstabiiity happens to

The significantt facte in this table are, viz., that there 















is a higher proportion of improved land in the Vulcan district than ia 
the case in the Lomond district and a better balance exists in the 
former district between the proportion in crop and the proportion in 
summer!allow. The inferiority of the latter district from the point of 
view of agronomy is reflected in the average acreage which is left as 
idle cropland. On the average 75 acres was -Left in this condition in 
the Lomond district and only 11 acres in the Vulcan district. Again the 
permanently idle figure is much higher in the Lomond district. This 
figure coupled with idle cropland represents on the average ku percent 
of the acreage that is lying idle on the average Lomond iarm. a larger 
proportion of the total acreage is also devoted to wild pasture in the 
Lomond district* This district being a drier area than Vulcan the ten¬ 
dency has been to devote a greater acreage to livestock and seai-rauchiag 
semi-f&rming combinations of enterprise. 

e 

The relative intensity of lend utilisation for cropping 
purposes is indicative of what the future land use may be for the res¬ 
pective district© especially if the external features of the dry areas 
change little in the future. 

(di Held a - Over the past period of years* the Vulcan district has 
proved to be more productive per acre than the Lomond district. During 
the years of favorable precipitation* yield per acre was at its peak in 
this district* as the figures in the following table indicate.

capital according to soil types* The indications are that the more pro**

that it would be to their advantage to work the better soil types in

Both the Vulcan and homond districts arc served by the 
Canadian Pacific Hallway. In no ca»e is any rare operator further than 
15 miles from the nearest railway station* The whole area is well tra¬ 
versed by graded dirt roads and a gravelled highway passes through, the 
Vulcan district and follows the main towns and the railway line fairly 
closely. The nearest exties are tnose of Calgary, Lethbridge and Med¬ 
icine Hat. 

Many fine schools are to b© found in the Vulcan district, 
facilities for public school education are provided for in the sparsely 
settled farming district and the high school facilities are found in the 
various towns* In the Lomond district, a number of schools have had to 
be closed recently due to the abandonment of farm land, and the migration 
of population to other parts of the province and elsewhere.

The series of rapid periods of expansion into the arid areas 
of Alberta, Manitoba and Saskatchewan was a result of a number of economic 
conditions which existed just previous to, or at the time the expansion 
toox place# It is one of the problems of tills thesis to analyse the var¬ 
ious contributing forces which brought about the invasion agriculturally 
into the areas known as the dry prairie areas* More specifically the an¬ 
alysis will be devoted to the settlement and its ©fleets in one of the 
sections within ^Failiser 1 s fri&ngle*, namely the Yuic&n-hoaond area* 

An endeavor has been made to evaluate the various economic 
forces insofar as they shaped the expansion and encroachment of settle¬ 
ment on the virgin plains of what was then known as the new world* xhe 
focal point has been directed on one ©mall area in order to get the sig¬ 
nificance of the conditions in the area before settlement took place* 
Moreover an attempt has been made to develop & tool of analysis by which 
the various phases of the problem can be examined* 

k, conditions of 

Secondly it is the aim of this thesis to examine the conditions 

under which settlement took place# It is now pointed out by many that 
gradual penetration wouad have given time and experience for the frontier 























settlers to have chosen land with a measure of forethought and with some 
information as to its productivity* it was, settlement took place 
with little knowledge of variations in natural resources and local dif¬ 
ferences in the climatic and other factors* An endeavor is made to 
picture 'under what conditions settlement took place within the Vulcan- 
Loraond area.

It- is also the problem of this thesis to evaluate the various 
conditions which make for the financial progress of settlers within any 
area that has been settled or opened up for settlement. An answer is 
sought to the question: **Under wh&t conditions can settlers be expected 
to make financial progress and 'under mat conditions are they not expected 
to make progress financially ? n

An evaluation of the financial progress of settlers within 
the Vulec-n-Lom-ond area is attempted through the use of various statist¬ 
ical measuring indices* it is hoped that the evaluation of the financial 
progress by this method may throw some light on why certain farmers with¬ 
in this area were able to make financial progress while others were unable 
to do so. Some of the indices that are presented are the present indebted- 

ness, assets, liabilities, average yearly gain, standard of living, farm 
facilities, etc* The statistical material is not treated as if infallible,

fhe expansion of the margin of cultivation into the dry 
areas was followed closely by the influx of population^ capital f and 
credit facilities, h&pid expansion of the municipal and other facilities 
followed on the assumption that the future would be as good as the pre¬ 
sent, and in all probability better. Lit'tie cognisance, if any, sac 


taken of the possible future reduction oi farm incomes because of pos¬ 
sible adverse conditions, father the opposite was expected, that is, 
after the development of the community had taken place, greater farm 
incomes would be experienced and there would be little difficulty, if 
any, in the upkeep of the municipal facilities as well as the mainten¬ 
ance of a fair standard of living* 

Ihe adverse physicaJL conditions of drought, insects, soil 
erosion, and the economic factor of a fair in the ^ilce of farm products, 
however, shattered the hope of many of ever again experiencing farm in¬ 
comes that would meet even the minimum requirements of food, shelter end 
other facilities, fhe present picture is one of tax delinquencies .and 
abandonment of farms. Is this a sign of the recession of the margin of 
cultivation in an area where at one time there had been & too ra,.id 

expansion? Or has there been an permanent change in the physical cond¬ 
itions! 

The relief extended to this area together with subsidised

local improvement® is looked upon as a help in combatting the physical 
forces rather than as an aid toward preventing the recession of the 
margin of cultivation* This marked recession of the margin is due pro¬ 
bably more to the economic and non—economic forces outsiae oi' this area.* 
It Is hoped that the discussion in this thesis, although lim¬ 
ited in nature with respect to the above, will. adduce sufficient evidence 
to make the problem more understandable* The picture at present is one 
of many farmers living side by side, some of taem aie successful finan¬ 
cially or at least are holding their own, whereas others are helped to 
remain by means of the relief that is, in essence, extended to them by 
their more fortunate or astute neighbors. Is this an indication that 
there are farm operators within tne dry prairie areas who were enabled 
to make & living only when wheat was soiling at $£*Uu a bushel, while 
there are others that can make a living no matter whether wheat is sel¬ 
ling at $51*00 e bushel or at $0 .40 a bushel? Hot many have pointed to 
the entrepreneur as a possible source of the difficulty in some instances, 
but ratiler point at the more obvious factors such as a decrease in pre¬ 
cipitation, soil erosion, etc. Or is it on the other hand a fact that 
some individuals can adjust their standards of living so as to be able 
to continue to produce because they are willing to absorb Weir wages 
by accepting this lower standard of living, while others refuse or are 
unable to adjust their standard of living to the farm income* 

It is this movement of land under cultivation from supers 
marginal or marginal to sub-marginal that has given some degree of 
concern to the various governing agencies as to how to grapple with the

In approaching any difficult problem in economics, Marshall 
gives the following suggestion in his principles* 

®By that method ( statical ) w© fix our minds on some central 
point* we suppose it for the time to be reduced to a stationary state* 
and we then study in relation to it the forces that effect toe things by 
which it is surrounded and any tendency there may be to equilibrium of 
these forces* A number of these partial studies may lead the way towards 

i 

a solution oi problems too difficult to b© grasped at to one effort • 
the complexity of toe problem that is to be studied In tills 
thesis can only be treated in a satisfactory manner by such & method as 
Marshall suggests* It is held that the general approach to toe solution 
of this problem is best seen through an equilibrium approach in a static 
state* For convenience the world with respect to agricultural md other 
activities is divided into two distinct economies* The first is to© 
Vulcaa-*ioaond area which we hope to examine to detail, and the other I© 
that area outside of the Vulcan-Lomond area which may be better known as 
toe ‘rest of the world 1 * 

The Vulcan-Lomond area is treated as an economy to general

equilibrium with the economy known us the “rest of the world”, It is held 
that any disturbing i'orce in any one of the two economies would have an 
effect on the other economy and may upset the equilibrium between the two 
economies* However forces would be set in motion, adjustments would take 
place until again a new equi.iib.rium point was reached* 

It is also assumed that any adjustments between the two econ¬ 
omies are passed back to the multitude of smaller setups within each major 
economy* We find, for example, that within the ?UuCan-Lomond economy, 
there exist two adjacent districts which are slightly different with res¬ 
pect to climatic, physiographic and farm organisation practices* These 
ars known as the Vulcan and hue Lomond districts* Under static conditions 
these two districts are in equilibrium with the area as a whole which in 
turn is in equilibrium with the rest of the world. Similarly any iorce 
may upset the equilibrium within each of the districts mentioned and ad¬ 
justments would take place until a new equilibrium point is rescued* 

In & like manner there may be a number of smaller or minute 
areas within each district* These would correspond to the six major soil 

classes within each district. Any maladjustment oi forces would be passed 
back to tliese smaller areas, with the resuit that counteracting forces 

would b® set in motion until a state of equilibrium again was brought 
into existence between the districts arid the smaller areas within them* 
Within each of the smaller area© in each district there are 
smaller units, namely the farmer and his farm* Any disturbing force aris¬ 
ing at any time between the two major economies would affect the individual 







- 59 - 


farmers and, through their react!one, the smaller areas and districts* 
the farmer would be forced to make adjustments, which together with a 
multitude of other adjustments would be passed back through the various 
stages and a new point of equilibrium would be reached* 

IX 

linen we examine the general conditions of life, however, we 
find that they are not in equilibrium and as a result, become a source of 
many difficulties in studying any economic problem* If we examine these 
conditions we find that tine is one of the forces that exerts an influence 
upon economic relationships* At the same time it is very difficult to 
evaluate tills force when contrasting two economies within the same time 
period or in two distinct time periods* Xo overcome this difficulty we 
introduce the concept of the w stationary state 11 in which the influence of 
the disturbing changes would be little felt or completely eliminated* 

The results obtained under the 11 stationary state 3 can then be contracted 
with those of the state that we wish to study* 

Certain conditions which are non-existent with respect to the 
actual conditions of life wila have to be introduced into the static 
state, via*,

of life, and every thing has adjusted itself to everything else. It is 
also conceivable that our "static state" is a progressive one, and at each 
step & new equilibrium would be established,

JSext we proceed to assume that Hie Vulcan—.Lomond area is an 
exchange economy within which you have the individual units which act so 
as to regulate production and consumption arid to obtain the maximum pos¬ 
sible satisfaction with the available resources, At the same time, there 
is also free choice of one’s occupation and the extent and nature of ills 
work. 

Money is regarded as a common scale of reckoning in ala econ¬ 
omic valuations, As soon as this common measure is introduced, values 
are then replaced by prices. Capital goods are regarded mainly from trie 
point of view of the sum of money for which they can be bought or sold. 

The same is held to be true for land. 

The sum of money used need not be used for Hie purchase of a 
material object! it may be lent and put at the disposal of other persons 
on certain conditions* The capital is substantially the same, the owner 
will still possess the same capital, though now it embodies temporarily 
a claim, or a share. The total capital of such an economy may be negative, 
i*e, when liabilities reckoned in money are greater than the positive ca,;—

It is also assumed that the ownership of goouu and rights in 
this money economy yields a certain regular return 10 the owner* out of 
which expenditures are met and savings are maae* 

In a brief summary* it may be restated that the approach to 
the analysis oi' the problem in this thesis is based on three fundaiaentel 
concepts! 

(ij Xhe equilibrium condition* 

(*;) the static state concept* 

(2) the exchange economy concept# 

Vie proceed to analyse the problems with the assumption that 
these three concept© are sufficient tools to deal with the problem and to 
explore its various parts*

Haring stated the general conditlons of equilibrium in section 
III, we will now examine the area under study from that point of view# 

In other words, we will start from the point where we assume the area to 
be in equilibrium* The time chosen is that just preceding the opening 
up of the area to settlement* 

A* CONDI mm3 IK .IHiLABEA, 

1* Distance 

Under conditions of equilibrium it may m assumed that the 
rent being paid for the us© of land is at its maximum* One element of 
cost that enters in'to the determination of rent is Idle cost of trans¬ 
portation* 

Before settlement took place within the Vuie&n-hoaond area the 
land was distant from markets, viewing it from the point of view of grain 
farming or any other form of intensive cultivation. The towns of Glares- 
holm, Granua and Lethbridge were the nearest markets that existed at that 
time* Because of this distance there was no pressure or demand for 
distant land© to be used for grain growing. On the other hand, distant 
land leads itself oo the extensive use which is most successful - namely* 


















44 


ranching* Under condition6 of equilibrium, the extensive and the iiiten¬ 
sive margins tend to be equal find the remuneration at each margin ax so 

tends to be equal* Consequently the ranching organisation is one that 
would yield the maximum returns when land is distant* In Unis case the 

transforation facilities are inadequate for the intensive use of land# 
but are quite adequate for the extensive u m of the land* 

(a) Soil - Under conditions of equilibrium the cover# the soil# uaA 
climate are in equilibrium with one another* The dark brow, soil of the 
Vulcan district is a result of a consistently higher annual precipitation 
and vegetative growth which helped to build up the humus content* The 
light browo soil of Lomond on the other hand is a result of & sarlxer ax- 
mount of precipitation and shorter natural grass growth* 

However# within each of the major districts# there are six 
minor soli regions of various degrees of productivity* These differences 
are in part attributable to the original glacial deposits# and later 
action on them by erosion, sifting of particles by water# climate and the 
vegetative growth* 

It is held that various holdings had had time to adjust them¬ 
selves to the various soil types before the area was thrown open for 
homesteading. 

(b) Cover - The southern part of Aiderta within which the Vulcun-Loaond 
area lies is a great treeless plain of North America, and is known to sup¬ 
port & vegetative covering of grasses only* These grasses in the main ar®

ox' the short or bunch gras© vpo* Xhe amount oX v rainfall which is neces¬ 
sary to support this vegetation is approximately twelve inches on the aver¬ 
age* This amount of rainfall supports a short grass cover whose root® 
normally occupy the soil intensively from a depth of from eighteen inches 
to three feet# The amount of top growth produced each year is smaller 
in the Lomond district when compared with the top growth of the higher 
rainfall district of Vulcan# 

The amount of precipitation which we would term as •dry 11 was 
sufficient to produce a grass cover as was indicated# |f sufficient rain¬ 
fall were forthcoming wheat could be produced in abundance# But it Is 
held that under conditions of equilibrium the area was dry and a grass 
cover was produced which was able to support livestock enterprises without 
overgrazing# 

The rate of evaporation, because of frequent high winds and a 
greater number of hour© of sunshine, experienced within this area is great¬ 
er than in an area where condition© are the opposite# It is also Known 
that during the winter months, the soil is not protected by a snow cover# 
hjace the dry winds have a tendency to dry out the soil even during the 

winter months# 

Having in mind the conditions of climate, it can still be as¬ 
sumed that under conditions of equilibrium a native cover of grass was 
produced which had been adjusted to ail the physical forces as well as to 

tite ranching enterprises# &s Marshall would say *& balance exists be¬ 
tween all forces* 0

5. Ty P « oi- Use a£ the. Area before SetU-eiaent 


We assume in tills section that successful holdings have been 
built up as a result of the demand of the market) enterprises which could 
be developed in a system of grassland husbandry* In other words, when the 
area was in equilibrium a development of a particular type of organis¬ 
ation tooic p^aee, namely, ranching. There was at that particular time 
a concentration on this particular type of enterprise, for axx tne avail¬ 
able factors of production could toe best put to use through this type of 
land utilisation# 

(a) hand ** Laud was abundant, which encouraged extensive use of it* 

Sis© of holdings necessarily must be large to make ranching a paying pro¬ 
position# 

(to) Lover - k natural grass cover was produced with the rainfall that 
•normally* fell# This natural resource was best suited for ranching pur¬ 
poses* Under natural covering the number of acres of pasture and lease- 
land per animal unit at present shows that twice as many acres are neces¬ 
sary to carry one animal unit in the Lomond than in the Vulcan district* 
The climatic differences partly explain this* It gets progressive!y 
drier from west to east or from Vulcan to Lomond district# 

On the whole the Vulcan soil has a much higher nitrogen content 
than that of Lomond and hence would have & better grass cover apart from 
the differences in the climatic factors* There are still further vari¬ 
ations in the soil types within each major district# More acres per an- 









- 47 


imui unit are required on the fine sand eoix than an the silt loam and 
clay soils* Various growth supporting materials react differently to 
equal amounts of pi 4 ecipitatian* 

Under conditions of equilibrium the existence of soils of 
varying carrying capacity would give rise to holdings of different size* 
Thus for the same number of livestock, ranches on the sandy soil would 
be larger, from the point of view of area of land, then those on the clay* 
in other words, adjustment® have been made to the carrying capacity of 
the land* 

(cj Capital - Capital was scarce for m intensive type of lend use, but 
was of sufficient quantity md quality for ranching purposes* The- bir.k 
of the capital was invested in the animals* 

(a) Labour - The population was sparse and labour scarce for an inten¬ 
sive type of enterprise* It was of sufficient quantity however to meet 
the requirements in the ranching enterprises* 

(ej Market - It is assumed that the drnmd for meat was constant and 
that the enterprises within this area had time to adjust their supply 
of meat to the demand for it* In other words, the demand for and supply 
of meat were in equilibrium* 

(f; Profits - It is further assumed that under the then existing cond¬ 
itions of equilibrium all enterprises were making normal profits. They 

had time to adjust their holding a to the best use, with the factors of 
production available, bo meet the demand for the product* 

By way of a review it may b© restated that under conditions of

product would cause the price of land to rise, and the effect of such a 
rise in price would produce one of the following reactions: 

(x) "A fall in the demand for the product” or 

(iij U A substitution of more capital and labour for rand” or 

(iii^ n An expansion of the area under cultivation”* 

To quote him further, he states that "all these are forces 
counteracting the rise in price of land and co-operate in restoring e- 
quilibrium MX *• 

By a fall in demand Cagsei means a reduction in the quantity 
which will be taken by consumers# The extent to which a rise in price 
will effect a. reduction in quantify will depend upon the elasticity of 
demand for the product* Under conditions of elastic demand & given rise 
in price will result in a relatively great reduction in the quantity which 
consumers will take* there the demand is inelastic there will be little 
reaction in the amount purchased due to & rise in price* 

Gassite argument suggests that with increasing population end 
demand for wheat the rent of land used in the production of wheat will 

rise* This implies an increase in producers* costs, and it is this xn- 

\ s 

crease in costs and therefor© prices at which increased quantities will 

be brought forward by producers that act© to reduce the quantities con¬ 
sumers will take* The extent of fills reduction will depend upon the el¬ 
asticity of demand.

Secondly, because of a rise la the price of wheat, there would 
be an increase in the rents which would result in **u substitution of acre 
capital and labour for land"* If we assume that ail of the available ar¬ 
able land in the economy known as "the rest of the world* is in use for 
producing wheat, then the only way to increase production is a more in¬ 
tensive application of capita* ana labour to the land that is already in 
cultivation* 

If this method of increasing the amount of the product is re¬ 
sorted to, any additional application of capital and labour to a given, area 
of land will result in an increase in the absolute amount of the product* 
The rate at which the product will be increased will be an increasing one 
until a point is reached at which any additional application qi labour and 
capital will result in an increase in the product at a decreasing rate* 

The point at which there is & change in the increase of the product from 
n an increasing rate 11 to a "decreasing rate* is known as the point of dim¬ 
inishing returns* 

Assuming that the state of the arts is constant and hence no 
change in the technique of production possible, the individual farmer will 
proceed to add capital and labour till the highest average point of re¬ 
turns is reached* Once that point is reached, it will pay the individual 
producer to take more lend (if it is ireej rather than ap^iy more capital 

and labour* biace ail of the available land is under cultivation, the 
only way that more land could be acquired would be by one of these two

(&/ By bringing into cultivation Land that is still in on "unpreduced* 
state. This would involve draining marshes, and reclaiming other sub- 
marginal land. 

(b) Relinquishment ol parcels of land held by some of the present cult¬ 
ivators wno would be interested in emigration. Then more -and could be 
had by those who wished to remain. But tills would not solve the problem 
oi extending the margin cultivation. 

The latter point brings into question the expansion of the area 
unaer cultivation by immigration. The ex an si on of the area under cult¬ 
ivation wilu be resorted to if the demand for the product is inelastic and 
the point of cultivation has reached or passed the point of the highest 
average returns and there is free land elsewhere. 

How let us examine under what conditions there will be a tend¬ 
ency to expand cultivation into our set-up economy of the Vulcan-hoiaond 
area. The alternative is to pay the higher rents in the old economy, or 
lay out an additional cap!tax expenditure to bring the non-arab-e land into 
arable land. 

Hew land would be taken into cultivation if the cost of pro¬ 
duction on toe new land was less, excluding rent than the cost of product¬ 
ion on the land already under cultivation, including rent as a cost. 

The cost of production on the new land would include the rent which would 
be paid for the alternative use of land for graadng purposes. If this was 

not so, there would be no incentive to bring new land under cultivation, 
but the higher rent would be paid on the old lend and this would continue 
















52 «* 


to be cultivated# 

The incentive not to pay the high rente will be the greater, 
the greater is the difference between the costs of production on the new 
fund and the coats of production on the old land# If the expansion and 
ultimate cultivation of the area is only made possible by the outlay of 
large capital investments the reaction against paying the old rents will 
be slow and the incentive to expand the area under cultivation wiix be 
lessened# The adjustments between expansion into new areas and the more 
intensive cultivation of the old I&ad will continue until the extensive 
and the intensive margins are again in equilibrium# The connecting link 

between the expansion and the intensive cultivation is the difference be- ( 

1 

tween the costs of production on the old and the new land# 

## can conclude from this discussion that the forces which 
would tend to bring the two economies into equilibrium as a result of a 
rise in the demand for wheat ware a sore intensive application of the 
lands already in cultivation ©ad the expansion of the area under cultiv¬ 
ation into the semi-arid area of ViUcan-homond• The rents which had risen, 
and brought about the expansion of the area would tend to fail, if the costs 
of cultivating the new land were less, the amount of the fall in the old 

rents would depend on the difference in the marginal cost of production 
on old lands and the cost on nm lands# Under conditions where expansion 

of cultivation could take place readily, this would tend to prevent any 
considerable initial in the rents of old land# The expansion of the

noted above and the time required to bring the land under cultivation* 

This would hinder the restoring of the equilibrium* 

how let us take our analysis a step farther .'aid see what the 
results are likely to be* For the first lew years the Vuican-hoaond area 
had a comparative advantage in producing wheat. Virgin soil, low capital 
cost of bringing the land under cultivation, abnormal years with respect 
to precipitation, yield, and prices were among the causes contributing to 
this phenomenon* In other words, the farm operators within the area in 
question were receiving unusually high rents during that period of dis¬ 
equilibrium* Thus there was an incentive to expand the area devoted to 
wheat production in the economy known as "the rest of the world 1 *. 

The high rents that were being reaped by farmers for the land 
used in the prairie area (Vuican-Lomond area) encouraged n land production 0 
(in Cassei*s sense) in the. wooded areas of the new world, as well as re¬ 
clamation of land in parts of the old world, in preparation for cultiv¬ 
ation and growing of cereals* 

Once the land was produced* more wheat was produced, but since 
the demand did not increase at the same rate, the wheat produced from this 
new land was thrown into the market la eompetitition with the wheat from 

the prairie belts. The price would falx and the system would again be 

thrown into disequilibrium*

Western Canada* 1 , makes the following statement; 11 In the latter part of 
the nineteenth century great improvements in rail and water transport 
made wheat a possible stupxe for new countries* As a result the worid 
became a single market, for wheat growing moved further and further to¬ 
ward the frontier of settlement**^* • It is held that the improvements of 
transportation and the penetration of railway facilities into the semi- 
arid areas of the prairies were oi sufficient force to change the than 
existing equilibrium in the wheat trade* Once the railway penetrated the 
territory adjacent to the Vulcan,-Lomond area, the choice was offered of 
introducing wheat growing or continuing the then established ranching 
enterprises* 

the incentive to continue with the ranching enterprises would 
have been the greater, the less was the change in the element of cost in 
producing wheat due to the provision of transportation facilities* the 
tendency toward settlement and production of wheat would be all the stronger, 
the greater the lowering of costs of production due to anticipated or 
actual changes in cost of transportation* If we still hold that there 

was a shift in the demand for wheat, then expansion of cultivation would be 
stimulated into the Vulcan—Lomond area* A new equilibrium point would 

be reached with wheat production carried to the point where the costs at 

the intensive and extensive margin were equal* The connecting link between 
these two margins in this case would be the cost of transportation* The 
greater the lowering of cost of transportation, the greater expansion would

be, and tl'ia less the lowering in cost of tr&nsporation, the lees would 
expansion be, assuming that other costs are cons taxit» In this manner land 
that w&s originally sub-marginal for producing wheat would become marginal, 
or supra-m&rgin&l for the time being at least* 

5, A ra for.fc 

the Yulcan-Lomond area was one of the sections qi the New World 
which was yet unsettled* $roi» the point of view of the development oi a 
nation, consideration might be given to the question of bringing in set¬ 
tlers with a view toward development of the natural resources, which would 
be a definite asset to the nation* fhe expansion into this area under 
such conditions might b© justified or unjustified* 

(a) ins tilled Settlement - let us assume that there has been a gradual 
increase oi population in the economy known as the tt rost ox the world”, 
which has resulted in the pressure of population in certain sections* In 
addition it has become very difficult to acquire land* In other words, 
there has been an increase in the demand for land, which could not be met 
satisfactorily in the over-populated, areas of the old economy* This was 
& sufficient force to throw the economy into disetp&iibrlus and temporarily 

at least the desire for land could not be satisfied* 

The attitude towards this situation sight have been that people 

had a right to settle on the land that was still available* an appreciable 
amount of land was available in the Vuican-homond area* The opening of 

this area to settlement would provide a means of acquiring land by home¬ 
steading for those who had a desire to become land owners*

The settlement of this area would have led to the satisfaction 
of the desire for land on the part of those who wished to mi,grate* i'his 
together with the reduction in the pressure o.t population in certain 
sections would have led to the estabiishraent of a new equilibrium* The 


movement towards colonizing this area would have been further Justified 


if there had been a fair degree ol certainty that those who took up land 
within this area would have been able to attain a standard of living which 
was equal to or above that one enjoyed before migration* 

Tills leads to a debatable point* viz., that those who under¬ 
take to colonize should take a measure of responsibility es to the choice 
of settlers with respect to: 

(ij farming experience and ability to adjust themselves to changing con¬ 
ditions* 

(Z) Initial capital* 

(S; Placing of settlers on land suitable for the type of farming that 
they understand and can undertake successfully* 


(b> - Snowing the limitations ox the area with 

respect to agricultural deveiopmeat (©*g* faHiser*s report), the settlers 


were still encouraged to come in. 

This might first lead to a temporary equilibrium, but xater 
would bring the area into disequilibrium condition. This might have been 
the result if the information about the area was withheld from the pros¬ 


pective settlers and in its stead inf ozm&tion as follows was passed along*

"The soil immediately surrounding the town is a light chocol¬

It is quite conceivable that certain agencies which had a def¬ 
inite interest in tills area, e*g*, The Hudson* s Bay Go. an cl the 0*F*B# # 
were inclined to follow a short-sighted but nevertheless from their points 
of view, fruitful policy with regard to land settlement* Obviously it 
was to their gain that this area should be thrown open to settlers as soon 
as possible, for once the land contiguous to that held by these agencies 
was settled the following benefits would inevitably accrue to them# 

(1) A market for their land* 

(&> The value of their land would be increased after the land 
adjoining to theirs had been improved# 

(5) Transportation and other facilities would follow the 
settler# There would be some agencies which would benefit from this trem¬ 
endously*

(4) The revenue received Tram bringing settlers in, capital good© 
as well as revenue received from hauling the farmers’ products. 

4s a result settlement would be based on faith rather than on 
economic considerations even though the conditions were not entirely un¬ 
known vis., Pailiser’s Report. 


4. Speculation 

There is always an element in the population that is ready to 
take a chance. The settler expects to improve the homestead, get a patent 
and then sell out when the increase in land values has become high enough 
to compensate him for the risk and trouble that he tins undergone. Of course, 
he may run the risk that the land on which he settled will turn out to be 
a poor choice and he may have to abandon his improvements at a considerable 
expense and effort* 

The prospective settler will decide to settle on the land if 
he expects that after he has made the necessary Improvements, future income 
wiii more than remunerate him for his labour and irardsiiip involved. He 
will also be influenced by the prospect of the acquisition of valuable 
title deeds. If his expectations are realised he will be content to remain 
on the land, from which he wiii be able to reap a steady incone. 







Under these conditions the area would be settled up to the 
margin at which it is expecteu that it will yield a sufficient sum to re¬ 
munerate the settler for his risk and labour and endurance of hardship, 
but the sum will be insufficient to leave & surplus for rent, w -ea no charge 
is made for the land. If there had been a charge for land, settlement

as well as a sum to cover the aettiers' labour and endurance that has been 
expanded in acquiring new laad^ # * 

5* Change...in the. ,&.tute..„oi:...tirifl-ArAa 

Another force of great importance which might have disturbed 
the conditions of equilibrium between the extensive and the intensive margin 
of cultivation is the change in the state of the arts# The change in the 
agricultural production from primitive hand methods to those of machinery 
affected the agriculture in the older regions# by making it possible to ex¬ 
pand into the semi-arid regions* this new technique in production would 
allow for greater economies in the use of labour and hence larger returns 
per unit of cropland due to increased efficiency of production* 

The expansion due to this cause would be accompanied by a fall 
in the rents in the older regions ox production* There would be a tend¬ 
ency toward contraction of the margin in older areas where agriculture 
has become unprofitable and the expansion into semi-arid regions where 
cultivation has become profitable for tho time being at least* The equil¬ 
ibrating force between the contraction and expansion of the margin would 
be the change in the cost of production due to the change in the state of 
the arts* The greater the change in the cast# the greater would be the 
incentive 'to expand, the smaller the change the smaller would be that 
incentive* The oscillation between expansion and contraction would continue

until again the extensive and intensive margins become equal, and a new 


equilibrium point was reached. 

6. **Q.ttvgg 

(a) Raliuloua Persecution - The religious persecution of certain groups 

within the older regions would be & force in providing an incentive to move 
into area® where religious beliefs would be tolerated, the greater the 
persecution, the greater would be the incentive to move, even to lands which 
for the time being were sub-marginal« The persecuted groups would be pre¬ 
pared to accept a lower standard of living, and also to undergo the hard¬ 
ships of frontier existence in order to attain freedom for their beliefs. 

The non-economic motive might In time turn out to have economic 
consequences, in that the margin of cultivation would be extended# The 
increased production of a product such as wheat might affect the rents in 
the older regions, for under new conditions of production, higher 
yields may be forthcoming due to virgin soil .and a combination of fav¬ 
orable climatic conditions. In addition the religious ethnic groups are 
capable of producing at a lower cost because much of their income is 
psychic derived from the possession of religious freedom* Much of their 
labour costs at the margin would be absorbed by this psychic income* 

(b) Pioneering - There are always individuals who seek the pioneering 
life. The dry prairie areas offered an opportunity of satisfying the 
wanderlust and the pioneering instinct of many who looked forward towards 
invading new frontiers. To this group would also be added social out¬ 
casts and misfits who could find peace and satisfaction only in such areas

as the Yuieaa-boaond area. In time, sumy of the pioneering individuals 
would settle down and become farmers* The outcome of their activities 
in time might turn out to be of economic significance in that they would 
extend the margin of cultivation ana increase the supply o: agricultural 
products. 

As a summary of the conditions giving rise to settlement, it 
may ha noted again that a number of forces were responsible for the dis¬ 
turbance of the then existing conditions of equilibrium between the two eo- 
onoaieo. Such forces as the change in the demand, & orange in tile cost 
of transportation, a desire for imd eettiement, speculation, and noo-eo- 
anomic motives were ell responsible In same degree for the opening up of 
the Vui aan-Lomond area for settlement in order to eeteblieh a new equil¬ 
ibrium point between the two economies* 

bet us as suae a condition where the government has not been in¬ 
fluenced to allow of filing qxi homestead® because it was considered more 
satisfactory to lease the land to ranchers at a nominal price of say two 
cent® an acre. Presumably under the conditions of equilibrium then exist¬ 
ing the cost of two cents an acre is & cost which the rancher® could meet, 
end under conditions of our original equilibrium ranchers would hold on 

until someone wm prepared to pay more than the ranchers* 

It is conceivable that some force or a combination of force®

such as a change in the demand for wheat, a change in the cost of trail ex¬ 
portation, a desire for land settlement, a change in the nature of the arts, 
or some non-eeonomic force such as religious persecution, makes it pos¬ 
sible for & certain group or groups to offer more than the ranchers. Since 
the then existing conditions of equilibrium have been disturbed, the result 
would be that the ranchers, under conditions of competition, would find 
it difficult to meet their payments which would become larger c-s a result 
of the new competition. . fhis situation coupled with the condition that 
the government has been influenced to open up the land for settlement would 
induce bids for the land within the area. Hire© types of bids would b© 
forthcoming, via.* 

(1) & bid for a homestead - a fee of $10*UU a quarter. 

(k) A bid for pre-emption - $480.00 a quarter. 

(5) A bid for land held by the Hudson 1 © bay Company, C. p. R«, 
and school lands. Presumably the bids for the land held by these agencies 
at the time of settlement would not be any greater then $480.ou a quarter 
as long as land for homesteading and' pre-emption was still available.

tlement of the Vulcan district was accomplished between 1904 and 1908. 

Most of the better land was homesteaded before 1906, although large sections 
of C, p, R,, Hudson* s Hay Company and school land ware sold in the raw 







at later da tea. At the time of settlement within tills district, settlers 
were forced to trek across country from towns on the railroad, passing through 
Qkotoks, High River, Han ton, CiareshoXm arid Gr&num, However, the railroad 
followed tlie settlers into the Vulcan district and a new Hue was buixt 
from Black!© to Lethbridge in 1911, passing through tne towns of Vulcan, 
Carm&ngay, and other points within the district* Previously all grain 
had been hauled across country to the High River-MacLeod line* 

The Lomond district was further from a railway and settlement 

of this district took place two or three years later taan that of Vulcan# 

. 

The provision of the Lomoud-Reti&w railroad aiso came at a later date* 

The following is a summary of the settlement process of the two 
districts as indicated by data obtained from the sample farmers*

Private i&tiative in the selection of lend was resorted to 
since it was thought at that time that it was the best method to pursue* 
that is* let everyone exercise his own judgment. However* the problem of 
selecting a piece of land by the settler was complicated by a large degree 
of ignorance of local difference in the quality of the soil as wel* as the 
natural resources# This was in no small degree amplified by .the psychol¬ 
ogical pressure exerted upon the settlers - first come first served - the 
main object was to get land no ms.tter where and what kind. Many of them 
were so intent on getting land that they filed on it blindly and came out 
later to see what they had drawn. 

These conditions of settlement gave an opportunity to individ¬ 
uals to become land owners and establish & home and encouraged the specul¬ 
ator as wall to come in and take a chance, Although many were disappointed 
there were some who fared quite well whether it was due to good judgment or 
a lucky choice# 

The results in the progress of settlers under a situation where 
land was taken up at random rather than by rational selection is a problem 
which will be studied in a later section, 

3. 

The evidence of settlement through purchases of land is indic¬ 
ated by figures in Table 16, The data indicates that most of the purchases 
were due to an increase in the demand for the land by those already in the 
area. However* a number of purchases were made from the various land

people into the art?a to purchase land rather than to homes toad was of smal- 
ier importance than the force that had stimulated those already in the 
area to acquire land#

At the time the Vulcan said Lomond districts were thrown open 
for settlement, it was apparently assumed that the settlers could develop 

their holdings on traditional lines end that in ail probability a 160-acre 
farm was a good*»sised holding to develop* However, it was apparently 
questioned whether the homesteading unit was an economical size of holding 

for these districts, or at least there was a degree of doubt about it. 

It is significant to note that the pre-emption provision was

i&ter acquire capital by working or by means of the credit facilities 
which would follow at a later date, 0tilers cam© well equipped with tools 
of production, as well as ready cash, awaiting an opportunity to expand 
and buy up land around them. 

fable 17 summarises the net worth at start, (that is at the 
time the settlers or purchasers of land cane into this area) in both the 
Vulcan and Lomond districts# the figures indicate that 17 percent of the 
sample farm operators brought |SuO or less with them into the Vulcan dist¬ 
rict as compared to ST percent for the Lomond district# It is interesting 
to note also that no operators brought with them more than fl5 # o0u into the 
Lomond district, while 15 operators in the Vulcan district brought with 
them more than |15,uuu 'as the initial capital for their farming operations# 
In general the figures indicate that Hie Vulcan operators brought more 
cash and producers 5 goods with them ton the Lomond operators# 

Most of the settlers of the Vulcan district owned and farmed 
in the dry areas of to United States before coming to settle or buy up 
land in this district, and consequently had built up quite an equity in 
lives took* machinery, and feed and seed as well as ready cash#

♦ One farmer in each district gave no information 

In a brief summary to the section on conditions of settlement 


it m&y be restated that once the equilibrium had been disturbed between 















































- 70 


the two economies, bids i'or expansion followed* The expansion of the area 
for farming purposes was accomplished by homesteading, pre-emption and pur¬ 
chases# No attempt was made to adjust the method of settlement or to in¬ 
terest the settler in choosing hiss land; choice of land was left to pri¬ 
vate initiative entirely* m opportunity was provided by legislation tar 
those who wished to enlarge the size of the initial unit* Many farmers 
took advantage of this method of acquiring more land, although many thought 
that it was sufficient to start faming operations on a quarter-section. 

The amounts of capital brought into the area by ths settlers varied tre¬ 
mendously but in the aggregate was a substantial sum.

(ft) litsh knowledge of k>. <a>JL BA.fferftaces aaa. r--e»ougce.a - Xet ue assume 
that homesteading takes place with knowledge on the part of the settlement 
body and the settlers of local differences with respect to soil, climatic, 
and physiographic conditions* fills condition implies that both bodies 
are eap&bie of discriminating between the good and the bad mid of passing 

reasonable judgment as to the future potentialities of a particular piece 
of land* Possessing this rationality, the settlement body would then de¬ 
cide whether a certain area should or should not be settled, and if the 
decision had beer* reached to settle the area, the settlement would then 























71 


have proceeded along these lines, via.s 

Land of the same area would be considered, but it would not 
necessarily possess the same qualities with respect to the chemical comp¬ 
osition of the soix, topography, stoniness and ease of cultivation, nor the 
same quantity of precipitation within the same time periods. The settlement 
body then would consider the possibility of compensating the differences 
in toe climatic and physiographic variations through price. The result, 
would b© that lead on the Black spring Silt Loam, because of its superior 
quality would tend to be settled at a higher price per quarter than land 
of the same area but of inferior quality, as the C&rmsng&y Fine band* As¬ 
suming that only one acquisition is possible, the prices o i different 
grades of land would tend to be such as to even out the effect of anticip¬ 
ated increase in land values* Any difference in financial progress due to 
this cause would be wiped out at the time of settlement through the dif¬ 
ference in the cost of acquisition* The only objection to this method 
of settlement is that due to its lower cost the acquisition of poor land 
might be encouraged and the acquiring of good land hindered* 

An alternative to this method would be to apportion different 
acreages but with local differences with respect to quality of soil, degree 

of atoainesa, variations in topography arid subject to varying amounts of 
rainfall, to be settled at the same price* Here it is assumed that the 
adjustment through si2© would be the compensating factor. In homesteading, 
18u acres would be available on the Blackspring Silt Loam for a $10*0u

Under perfect adjustment, equal profits would be &c.de from both farms 
and unearned increment in xuad values would not contribute to difference® 
in the financial progress of settlers* 

In addition to the above two alternative* of settling rand, a 
condition could exist where the settlers having the knowledge of the land 
and the climatic factors would presumably homestead the choice parcels of 
land and refuse to file on 'the poorer land* i’hus there would he little 
difference in the financial progress of settlers attributable to fortunate 
settlement since aim of them would have unde the best possible choice -with 
respect to land* 

Where knowledge was complete, these minor considerations 
would come under inspection and the proper method of settlement made* fhus 
in €u.i probability, the second choice would appear to be the most rogical 
one and on© which would disturb the then existing condition of equilibrium 
the least* Xf the first process was resorted to, that is, that parcels 
of equal area but with variable soil ate* may be obtained at different 
prices, trie settler might pursue agricultural practices which would not be 
suitable and remunerative if practised on a particular soil, vim*, wheat 

growing on sand* It is evident ’that such a settler would have little op¬ 
portunity to progress financially due to his efforts to improve and farm 
a piece of land which definitely should never have been broken up*

agricultural practices, i»e«, on sand the size of holding probably would en- 
courage livestock husbandry, while the silt loam would encourage cereal grow¬ 
ing. 

It may be noted of course tout a combination of all of these 
alternative methods mentioned would bring about the ideal land settlement 
policy and one which would give all settlers the same opportunity of finan¬ 
cial progress if measured in terms of fortunate and uafortuaate location*

ability to discriminate between the good and the bad, even under competitive 
conditions, soil of inferior quality may be taken up first or at the same

to the lack of knowledge or rational judgment as to what is good land and 
what is poor land, md is a condition that existed at the time the prairies 
were settled* this condition is to a large degree responsible for the variance 
in the financial progress of settlers who came into this area.

A large part oi' the land of the Vulcaii-homond area was thrown 
open for homesteading at a nominal price of $lb*uu a quarter without any 
differen tlation being made between the variations in. soli type or physical 
differences. It was only nafcurai. that those settlers who were able to file 
on the better lands reaped the later increase in land value as well &s the 
higher profit-producing capacity of some lends over others* On the other 
hand, many farmers found themselves operating on very umproduchive soils 
and at great distances from trade center© and transportation facilities* 

In some cases when mistakes became evident, land was abandoned, whiie in 
other cases the value of land increased very little* thus some of the set- 
tiers began with decidedly different opportunities of financial progress* 
la many cases the increase in land Value alone has been res¬ 
ponsible for the differences in the financial progress of settlers, for 
after paying the same price for their original holdings at the time of 
first settlement, great variations in land values developed as the pro¬ 
ductivity of the land became known and as the railroads and highway© found 
their way through the area* 

f. 

Purchase of land would take place when some force from the 
outside had upset the equilibrium and was bringing the people into the area* 
would also tend to happen where the people arc already in the area and 
som® force tended to increase the demand for land* liio condition with 
respect to knowledge of the local differences in soil would be a contribute 
ing factor in the financial progress of settlers*

(O atU I.eBQUfCea - Purchusee under 

this condition are iikexy to happen whore the people are already in the area* 
Prices for land would be paid according to the productivity 01 the soil, 
that is, for particular agricultural pursuits* The prospective buyer would 
be in a position to consider and evaluate with a reasonable degree of ac¬ 
curacy tiie present and future potentialities with respect to the composition 
of the soil, and the adaptability of physical differences sucn as topography 
to the particular agricultural pursuit la mind* Tne probable number oX 
crops that could be grown without seriously impairing the physical condition 
of the soir and without seriously depleting the chemical composition of it 
would also be known* He would b© interested in the climatic forces and 
the types of crops that could be successfully produced* Finally he would 

be interested in the accessibility of good roads and market, 

§ 

Under the conditions outlined the price paid arid tine product¬ 
ivity of the land are assumed to be known and already adjusted* Therefore, 
there wouid be no differences in the financial progress ox settlers due to 
a good or a poor purchase since all purchases are rational and the results 
due to the purchase are neither more or less than was anticipated* 

(b; With Absence at ftaomLedge. oi ^ ocO- Pixi^xenma...fe(ja_j^aQuiiaafe - this 
wouid probably be the situation where some force from the outside had up*. 
se, the equilibrium and brought the people Into the area* It is also con¬ 
ceivable that purchases with absence of knowledge of local differences and 

resources are made by people living within the area* 

Under these conditions the same price or even a higher price 
















might be paid for a parcel ©1 land on sand or for a parcel with very rough 
topography or one that ir too stony ior practical farming, purposes, as would 
be paid for a level piece of land free from stones and on slit roam* It 
is not necessary that absolute ignorance exist at the time of purcnase* 

The purchaser might acquire a lev#!, heavily-grassed holding which was to 
all appearances of great fertility, hut yet ha might mater find to his sor¬ 
row that the grass also concealed stones of a sufficient quantity to max© 
p ro f i tab!e , cul tivation. impo ssibl e • 

We know that much of the land within tars area was settled in 
this manner with only partial knowledge of the essential factors, but 
evidence was also obtained in the survey that many purchases were made with 
absolute ignorance of conditions* This type of purchase would decidedly 
reduce the financial progress of a settler who was so unior innate as to 
start his farming practices with a poor purchase. It might also be mentioned 
here that the accident of quality of adjoining x&nd subsequently available 
for purchase makes the market far land m imperfect one waere the settlers 
bid for tills land in order to expand their holdings# 

Of course mistakes would be realised and adjustments made in 
the long run, but in the meantime the financial progress oi individuals who 
exercised poor judgment at time of purchase would be reduced to a consider- 
aid . degree# 

Some evidence has been obtained in this matter from the sample 
farmers in both the Vulcan and Uomomxd districts. Tills information is as-

wambled in fable ib* fhe interesting figures arc the purchases of -©and on 
the Sarmangny iine ^anu in uie anu. ^a^o-lBSc periods - the average 

purchase price per acre paid for Iona on this soil being iib,B5 and 4ib*o£ 
respectively. IShen the above prices are compared with the average prices 
paid for land on the black spring blit Loam for the same period®, which 
were 114*67 and $k$*ib, «re may conclude that the latter purchases of good 
land would favor the financial progress of an individual who chose to make 

Si 

his start at this pi ice and reduce the chance lor the settler who mm® the 

H 

former purchases* I he changes in land values alone would help to explain 
why one individual progresses anu the other rail© to make any progress* 

The data also indicate© that a© time passes mistake© are found 
ana adjustment© are made. It is noted that the i©v©~l£5b average price 
paid for the lowest of all soil classes, i«c* Suxtt&ngay fine ^and, was 
417*11 per acre* Of course there are other factors besides soil which make 
this adjustment, but they are for the time being ignored and will be analysed 
in a later section* 

broad differences wore notec in the productivity of the soil 
as between the two districts* The higher auric brown productive soil of 
Vulcan consistently brought a higher price per acre then the inferior night 

1 

brown sola of the Lomond oi&trici. This is an adjustment which would tend 
to iron out any differences in the financial progress as between the two 
districts and in the long run we would expect that both districts would be 

equally remunerative to the settlers who farm within them*

In a brier summary of settlement by homesteading and purchasing 
of land it may be restated that an individual who exercises any degree of 
rationality with respect to choosing a homestead or purchase has a greater 
opportunity of progressing financially than his more unfortunately located 
neighbor who was not as critical in making his choice* It is hoped to pre¬ 
sent indices of financial progress on the basis of local differences as 
evidence to support this argument*

Although statistics Of prices, yields, and values of iield 
crops for the districts of Vulcan and Lomond covered b;y the economic survey 
are not available, the statistics with regard to the Province of Alberta 
indicate in general the average conditions in the districts making up the 
whole province* The data of course are not considered to be infallible when 
applied to the Vulcan-nomond area. 

the general conditions with respect to the demand for arid supply 
of agricultural products are indicated by Table 19 said Chart 111. The 
index numbers of agricultural price© are indicative of the. demand and supply 
conditions over the period and the indices of yields ar© indicative of the 
supply for the same time. Under static conditions, the conditions of demand 
ana supply would be permanently equated and there would be no oscillation 
of price from year to year. 

In the process of adjustment to an equilibrium point* the 
prices of one year predict fairly accurately whether production will be 
increased or decreased in the next period, other things being equal. Thus 
the high prices of 19X4 led to an increase in production the following year* 
also the rise in prices of 1919 led to an increase in production in 19£0. 

The figures in Table 19 also indicate that from 1909 to 1954* 

annual average price indices fluctuated within the range of 55.5 to 115.7* 
Annual average indices of yields fluctuated from 8.0 to 157.8, and average 

annual indices of crop values ranged from 8.0 to 154.9* 

These general conditions of price* yields* and values would 
have the same reaction on the production in the Vulcan—nomond urea, and in

as - 


general it is expected that the settlers within this area would not react 
differently to the prices than would those outside the economy. This econ¬ 
omy would play its part in restoring the equilibrium, with respect to demand 
and supply, by contracting or expanding its production, depending which way 
the pendulum of price happened to swing. The reaction on the financial 
progress of settlers would, in a large degree, depend on how wide ana swift 
these wings of price happened to be. 

(b) rurcnaaing. Power of..Wheat - The Vulcan Lomond area is almost completely 
restricted to grain growing, and wheat is the source of the greater part 
of the operators 1 cash receipts. The fluctuations of the price of wheat 
are reflected in the purchasing poster represented by this price, especially 
when taken in terns of fixed contracts, such as purchases of land on time. 

A contract made at the beginning of an upward trend in the purchasing power 
of wheat would ±„vour the financial progress of an individual who contracted 
at this particular time. H© would have no difficulty in meeting his ob¬ 
ligations, for he could clear his debt with a Isas number of bushels than 
he had originally contracted for* The situation would be reverse to an 
individual who had contracted a purchase at the beginning of a drop In 
the purchasing power of wheat, and who had failed to take Cognisance of the 

future prices* In order to clear his indebtedness he would have to pay 
more in terms of bushels than he had originally contracted for, while the 

productivity of his farm remained the same or even decreased. 


From 1906 to 195$, it required from 1* to 78 bushels of wheat

of average grad© to meet a cash and/or on time purchase o£ land at #25,uQ 
aii acre. It required from 4 bushels to Si bushels of wheat to fulfill a 
contract purchase price of band at #10,09 an acre, 

Experience shows that farmers in general have not taken suf¬ 
ficient not© of the fluctuations in the purchasing power of wheat. The re¬ 
sults in the financial progress of two settlers, one of whom purchased land 
when the purchasing power of wheat was rising and the other when it was 
failing would be decidedly different. Let us consider the two periods of 
falling and rising prices - the period of rising prices up to 1920 and the 
period of fulling prices after 1920* The figures obtained in the survey 
indicate that of the total land purchased by the sample farmers, 52 per 
cent was purchased before 1920 in the Vulcan district and only 20 percent 
in tile Lomond, In other words, the Vulcan district experienced heavier pur*, 
chases of land before 182w or during the period of rising purchasing power 
of wheat, while Lomond experienced its heaviest purchases after 1920, during 
the period of falling prices* Other things being equal, the farmers in the 
former group would be in a better position to meet their contractual ob¬ 
ligations, while the farmers in the latter group -would have difficulty in 
meeting their original contracts and instead of their obligations being 
decreased, they might actually increase, until the individual farmer might 
find himself with a negative net worth, 

(1) See Table JU- Appendix I, page ^2 /? 


t 

















- 86 


This would be true if the prices were the same in both periods, 
but prices may be different, which is l±&q u factor# fhue if the purch¬ 
ase was made during the year 1915 when the purchasing period oi wheat was 
low, but not distant from the rise in the purchasing power of wheat during 
the subsequent four or five years* In the first place the original pur- 
chase in all likelihood was made at a law price because of the existence 
of the low purchasing power of wheat and secondly the unexpected rise of 
the price of wheat in subsequent year© would enable the purchaser to clear 
off his original agreement with a less number of bushels# fhe reverse 
situation would hold true for & purchase ox land that was made during the 
year 19&9* Under such conditions the former would be placed in a favour¬ 
able position, while the latter would in all probability show an increase 
in land indebtedness and a negative net worth* 

(c) Prices arid r.*r,ri VsI-has _ *h# prices paid for land dapend upon a great 
number of factors* Some of these are the soil type, the prices paid for 
farm products produced on the land at the time of its purchase, access to 
good roads, distance to market, community life, etc* Business cycle iluct- 
uations have also played their part* Again the expansion of the size of 
farm holding has increased the demand at times for land and temporarily 

raised its price# 

1* Period oi Rising Prices - Rising prices reflect an expectation of a 
favourable future purchasing power of various agricultural commodities 
such as wheat* How does this affect the people within an area where the 

greatest source of cash revenue is wheat? 


























87 


In general, when prices of agricultural products rise, there 
is a lag in the costs of labour and other farming expenses* The margin of 
profit at least temporarily increases resulting in increased, incomes for 
farmers* The general tendency ox farmers under such conditions is to ex¬ 
pand the size of their farms and endeavor to increase their earning cap¬ 
acity* 

The price that wixi be bid for the prospective acquisitions 
will depend in some measure on these factors* 

(1) The difference between costs of production and price 
received for the product at present, i*e* the present profit margin* 

(2) The profit margins which have been derived from these 
holdings in the past* 

(5) An estimate of expected future profits based on price 

expectations, etc* 

®fhe farm land prices tend to reflect the margins of profit 
just previous to the time of safe plus the anticipated increases in such 
margins as manifested by the past increases of the proceeding seven to 
ten years**'*"** 

However, not only buyers but sellers of farm land expect 

land incomes to increase especially when prices are rising, end they take 
into account the expected increments when they offer their hand for sa^e* 

Usually during a period of rising prices the capitalized market rents in¬ 
cluding the expected changes in these rents are more than the sale price

of land* Hence more farmers will prefer to buy rather than continue to 
lease* But under such conditions more land owners will want to rent their 
land to others rather than selx, so that equilibrium between capitalized 
market rents and sale pi’ices will be established*''”* The point of equilibrium 
will be reached where it will not make any difference to the producer 
whether he buys land or leases it on the one hand, and on the other it will 
make no difference to the owner of the land whether he ©eixs his land or 
leases it to others* In other words the equilibrium point will be reached 
when the selling price of land is equal to the capitalized market rents, 
i,e*, it wiix be higher than the original price of land* 

.ffr fl.cea - Falling prices reflect an unfavourable fut¬ 
ure purchasing power in terms of commodities. Vhat -would the affect on the 
farmers within an area be where wheat is the greatest source of cash revenue? 

When the prices of agricultural products enter a period of 
declining prices, the costs of production do not fall proportionately to 
the fall in revenue* The result is that the margin of profit between costs 
and revenue narrows, and the farmers mil experience a lull in the profits 
from their farms* The general tendency of farmers under such conditions 
is not to expand their holdings but rather to contract them* They wiix 

also try to maintain the same level of profit previous to that of the fal¬ 
ling prices by cutting down costs. In general the land values wxix decrease 

ana the bids for x&nd wixi be reflected by xow prices paid for purchases*

?. Land Values In the yulcaa-Loawad Areft - Ine land values in general in 
the Vulcan-Bomond area do not show any gains, but rather a decline in land 

values when we compare the present with the past* fable 18, peg© 78, sum¬ 
marizes the price paid per acre of land by five year periods* 

Although there was & drop in the prices of farm products after 
1919, the land values continued ‘to rise in the Vulcan district* An aver¬ 
age of $k9*U9 per aex*e was reached for land sales for the I9ku to 13B4 
period, due chiefly to the 1920 transactions which occurred at relatively 
high prices, and because the purchasers anticipated future increases in 
income, which anticipations were based on the past seven to eight years 1 

experience with an upward trend of profits* Time has shown that these an¬ 
ticipated future incomes were not forthcoming and the result is that the 

u 

financial status of’ many individuals has been affected adversely not only 
through decreased incomes but by a decrease in land values as well*

The prices paid for land in the Lomond district followed the 
index of farm prices quite closely* The highest average price paid per 
acre was for the 1916 to 1919 period, axi average of $17*47 per acre of land* 
There was a decided decline in the next five-year interval, and lend sold 
during this period averaged only $10*86 per acre* 

There was a tremendous drop between the average price paid 
per acre of land in the 1906 to 1919 period end the average for the 1310 
to 1955 period in the Lomond district* first because the second period 
falls in a period of falling prices and secondly because as the lower 
relative productivity of the Lomond soil became known the land value© tended 
to be decreased stilu further# During the former period land was purchased 
at an average price of $16*58, while during the latter it was purchased for 

$8.xa* 

■ ' j 

Only a alight drop was noticed between the two periods in the 
Vulcan district, due to the continued productivity on a comparable basis 
with the previous period, resulting in a future anticipation of farm in¬ 
come at least on a par with past experience# Another force which helped 
to foster this anticipation and keep up the land values was the great pro¬ 
gress in technical methods of production which reduced expenses and left 
the same or increasing margin of profit as a basis for land prices within 
this area* During the 1909 to 1919 period, the average price paid per acre 
was $£5*11 and during the 1910 to 1355 period the average purchase price 
was $14*78* 

Summing up this section it may be mentioned again that the 


















prices, yields and values of agricultural products and the land values ex¬ 
ert a tremendous influence on the financial progress of farmers within any 
district. Other things being equal a farmer who goes into production when 
prices are rising has a greater chance of success than when they are fctU 
ling. Of course in the long run the fluctuations in price will be ironed 
out and an individual who has been longer on his farm 1ms an opportunity 
of evening out his profits and losses* 

(iiii CAPlTAL..Ag.SlAKL 

As' a result of m increase in the demand for wheat, settlers 
uid purchasers ware brought Into the area* What results can be expected 
in the financial progress of settlers who homestead and settlers who are 
purchasers when they come in with (a.) adequate capital (b) inadequate 
capital (c) borrowed capital? 

(a) iflith Adequate C^oitsf - A homesteader who comes in with an adequate 
amount of capital is in a position to make improvements very quickly and 
increase his production to the maximum amount* the immediate result will 
be that he not only benefits from the increase in land values because of the 

improvements that he has put on his farm, but he is also in a position to 
reap the profits which are a result of the increase in the price of wheat* 

Other things being equal a homesteader who had an adequate amount of capital 
would be in a position to make favourable financial progress and would out¬ 
strip the settler who cam© in without an adequate amount of capital*

(bj With Inadequate (huitai - A settler coming in without an adequate amou 
of capital for immediate development of the holding need ol necessity 
prosper at a slower rate than those settlers possessed of adequate capital* 
he would anticipate a sufficient amount of employment during part of the 
year which would net him enough to improve his homestead by degrees* His 
savings would mainly be due to the efforts of his own. labour. If he lias 
chosen a piece of land wisely there is no reason why h© should not succeed 
for his savings through his own labour would be enhanced greatly by the in¬ 
crease in land value which comes about through the gruduaj. improvement of 
the land itself and the penetration and establishment of markets* railway* 
sind otlier facilities* He 'would have the opportunity of realising on his 
increase in land value by selling out at a profit or by remaining and reap¬ 
ing tlie increase in the farm income which came about due to the development 
of the farm* 

A settler who had not chosen so wisely* might lose ail the lab¬ 
our that he has put into the farm* If he stays he will only enjoy a de¬ 
creasing income or no income at all* for if it is a poor piece of land his 
neighbors will not bid for it* end he will have the alternative of abandon¬ 
ing it or remaining to suffer repeated losses* The financial progress of 

an individual settler under such conditions would be retarded. 

(c) With iarronea Csoiud. - A Battier who cones iato aa area with borrowed 
capital or with the anticipation of borrowing capital to improve his farm, 

is at no great immediate disadvantage in comparison with a Homesteader woo 
comes in with an adequate amount of capital*

Assuming that he can borrow an adequate amount of capital 
he will be in a position to male improvements quickly and bring ins fax® 
up to the maximum production within a short period after settlement. If 
he has chosen Ills land wisely he will be able to pay off the borrowed cap¬ 
ital and share In the increase in land value plus any improvements which 
have been added due to his own efforts with the aid of the borrowed cap¬ 
ital. He will have 'the alternative of staying and taking the increase in 
income due to the increase in the production of th© farm, or selling the 
farm at a neat profit* 

However, if the settler has not made a good choice, with res¬ 
pect to location and soil, the borrowed cap! til. would be consumed in mi 
ili-chosen project* He would not be in a position to pay off the borrowed 
capital or even 'to make small payments* His land would be burdened in the 
future with indebtedness and instead of being able to decrease it, it may 
even increase. If he abandons his land, Ms loss will be shared with oh® 
individual who advanced the capital to Mm* If he stays, he wLU only re¬ 
ceive a very low income, which will have to be shared with the advancers 

of capital, finally he will reach a stage where he will be unable to pro- 
v±&t the producers’ and consumers* goods necessary to operate the farm. 
Eventually he may become & charge of the government, and will be enabled 
to remain on his farm because of 'the relief that is extended to Mm* Under 
such conditions the individual settler will not make any financial progress*

thrown open lor purchasing rather than homesteading, ns a factor in estab¬ 
lishing a new equilibrium to meet the increasing demand for wheat? As it 
was, some settlers cane out at the time the land was thrown open for home- 
steading to purchase land from the various land agencies since they were 
not eligible for homesteading, having already exercised their homesteading 
right* Other purchasers followed at a later date# 

(a) With -adequate Capital - Settlers coming into the area with adequate 
funds with which to purcha.se land and producers goods would have an advant¬ 
age over those coming in with an inadequate or borrowed capital, other 
tilings being equal# They would be in a position to make a caea payment for 
their land arid become outright owners at start# Any increases in land val¬ 
ues exclusive of improvements would accrue directly to them# 

The adequacy of capital would enable the settler to improve 
his land quickly and bring it under cultivation within a reasonably short 
time# He would also be in a position to participate in the profits due to 
the sale of the product at relatively high prices, at least until the equil¬ 
ibrium was restored* The improvements made upon the land wouxd increase 
its value and the increase of land value due to these improvements ‘would 
also accrue to him* 

The ability to equip his farm with Ms omi capital of a suf¬ 
ficient aadexficient nature, would enable him to organize Ms producing 
unit most efficiently so as to yield maximum profits* 

Under such conditions, a settler would be in a position to 
mmce favourable progress, other things being equal*

(b) 1¥.i tli Inadaauate Z&jI tal - A settler coming into an area to purchase 

land and possessing an inadequate amount of capital is in all probability 
contemplating that sometime in the future due to the efforts of his own 
labour plus the gradual increase in the farm income due to the improvements* 
he will be able to pay off the land debt with which he starts* He also ex*~ 
pects to participate sometime in the future in the increase la land values 
over and above what he paid for the land originally* If the purchase is a 
good one, there is no reason why he should not realize his anticipations* 

On the other hand* if the purchase turns out to be a bad one* 
he would not be in a position to write down his investment to the full amount, 
but only to that extent that he has an equity in it* This will depend on 
his original down payment together with his decrease in land debt due to 
subsequent payments* Under such conditions a purchasing settler m^y devote 
his lifetime in an effort to pay for his land and still be in debt* 

There is no better example than the following to illustrate 
this point* A'Mr* X came into trie area in 191? to purchase a half section 
of land* At the time of purchase he paid fl*Q9Q cash on an $8*uOQ purchase 
and in 1935 he still owes $5»QU0 after making eleven subsequent payments*

If tiie land value had not changed since the time of purchase 


the loss would not be as great# But whereas he had contracted to pay $25 
an acre for his land* he could not sell it now for $1 an acre* In other 
words, ha lias put into the land $9,8-58 and this rsame land for which he has 
no clear title will not yield $400 at a sale today* Under such conditions 
it is impossible for & settler to make favourable i'in.mciai progress and look 
towards independence in his old age* 

(e) With Borrowed Capital - A purchaser coming into an area with borrowed 
capital is at no great immediate disadvantage when compared to the individual 
























who comes in with adequate capital of his own* If the amount of borrowed 
capital is of a sufficient sum to equip his farm and make improvements quick¬ 
ly thus bringing the unit up to the maximum returns, he will be able to reap 
the profits out of which it will ultimately be possible to pay off his in¬ 
debtedness, but it seems obvious that over the period during which he is 
repaying ills debt he must subsist at a lower standard of riving than if he 
had started with Ms own capital* 

If tdie purchase is a poor one the results wiix be similar to 
those discussed in section (b ). However, other things being equal apart from 
the qualification introduced by the fact that in the one case interest must 
be paid on borrowed capital while in the other it can be saved or reinvested 
in the enterprise, there should he no great difference in the rate of fin¬ 
ancial progress of a purchaser who comes in with an adequate amount of capital 
and a purchaser who comes in with -m adequate borrowed capital*

This is a phase oi k the study that could be greatly extended 
and the technique used in building up the farm explored irk greater detail. 
Comparisons could be made for those whose original holdings were homesteads, 
as compared to those who made their start by purchase or by legacies. 

The conditions under which acquisitions were a--.de with respect 
to capital and time of purchase indicate something of the probably future 
success of the individual settler who expands his holding by purchase.

(a) rira^aera JJ,gtos Qm .Caiai&L - a farmer who has an adequate amount of 
capital lor expansion is in a favourable position in a period of rising 
prices. If he purchases a piece of land with no improvements on it, he not 
only is in a position to close the land deal on a cash basis, but he will 
be in a position to prove up the newest acquisition as quickly as possible 
and take the full benefit of the rising prices* The increased profits due 
to his expansion may not only be sufficient to pay back the original invest¬ 
ment but interest as well* The chances are that an individual irho expands 
only when ho has sufficient capital to sea him through will make favourable 
progress since he is not paying off & debt. The extent to which the farmers 
in the Yulc&n~Lomond area bought land on a cash basis is indicated in the

Of the 282 transactions in the Vulcan district, 67, or 14 


percent were ail cash deals, and only 16, or 6 percent made no cash payments 
at the time of purchase* In the Lomond district, of the 539 transactions, 
154, or 45 percent were cash dears, and 27, or 8 percent required no cash 

down at the time the purchase was made* In other words, nearly one-half of 
all transactions in the Lomond district were ail cash, while only one-quarter 
of the transactions were cash in the Vulcan district* This can be partly 
explained by the fact that the total purchase price was much lower for the 
Lomond district, and hence smaller amounts of money were required to complete

cash deals* 

The data is indicative of the fact that the rising; prices have 
stimulated and brought forward more purchasers with their own capital* In 
other words, those came forward to purchase who stood ready to take the full 
benefit of the rising prices# 

(bj Purchasers Using borrawed Coital - Farmers who come into the market to 
purchase land during a period of rising prices have in mind that the present 
purchasing power of wheat will continue or even rise. The outlook is fav¬ 
ourable for purchase of land on time, with borrowed capital* assuming pur¬ 
chases to be made on this basis we find the purchasers in the process of pay¬ 
ing off borrowed capital, and if they can meet all of their payments within 
tiie period of rising prices, they will have made their new acquisitions at 
less cost to themselves since less wheat is now required to meet their con¬ 
tracts which were drain in terms of money* 

In addition, during a period of rising prices, the settlers of 
land are as a role quit© con Dent to extend credit# The amount of credit ex¬ 
tended on land sales is illustrated by Table IS# The figures indicate that' 
the majority of transactions are on time or with borrowed capital* 

The farmer who could meet all of his obligations during the 

period of rising prices without carrying the burden of debt into & period 
of falling prices has a good chance of showing favourable progress*

(&J Purchasers 9 sing Pun. C&bit&l - A farmer who contemplates purchasing land 
with his own capital intends to lay down all or nearly all cash for his pur¬ 
chase. If tiie future incomes from his addition turn out to be below hie 
original expectation, he will be in a position to write down his capitaliz¬ 
ation and continue to produce on a new basis* He will not be burdened with 
an increase in land debt due to delinquent payments on principal and inter¬ 
est in the face of declining purchasing power of wheat* In other words, when 
wheat prices are falling he makes Ms purchase on a cash basis, he takes 
his loss at the start, this loss being definitely limited by the size of his 
original investment plus Interest*

borrowed capital during a period of declining prices is oi a speculative 
type# He usuaixy hopes to make a purchase at a favourable price and with no

On the other hand* if prices continue to falx* he will be placed 
in an unfavourable position* He will find it difficult not only to meet his

condition which had elated with respect to demand and supply for wheat. 

In addition, adverse changes in the climate and depletion of soil would have 
to be met by the settlers within this semi-arid area* 

The financial progress of settlers within this area would de¬ 
pend to a large degree on how quickly and to what extent they had been able 
to adjust themselves, not only to toe recurring adverse physical conditions 
but also in the development of their technique of production* In tills man¬ 
ner the fall in land values could b© overcome because of the development In 
the improvements in the production, transportation and marketing* Such im¬ 
provements would reduce toe expenses of production and leave an ever increas¬ 
ing, or toe same, margin of profit* Consequently toe improvements in the 
technique of production might be a dominant force of any period in toe fin¬ 
ancial progress of settlers within any area* frobabiy there is no other area 
as important as the semi-arid area of the prairies where this force has made 
it possible for many individuals to keep on farming and make progress finan¬ 
cially in spit© of all toe adverse forces which had to be faced* 

The economic forces are always at work to meet any hazards and 
adjustments are made from time to time* home degree oi" adjustment has been 
mad© by farmers within toils area to meet the fluctuations and iimi bations 
of precipitation. The farms have been extensively mechanized which enable© 
the operators, through extensive methods to conserve moisture aid to increase 
the yields and farm income* In a general way the inhabitants of these two 

adjacent districts have to a degree, adapted themselves to the recurring 

drought periods.

The district© of Vulcan and loaiond have been principally wheat 
producing, in the past* as well as the present* the largest source of cash 
is from tiie sal© of wheat# Mixed fanning is not practiced to any extent in 
these districts* as it is in some other parts of the province# Consequently 
aix of the technical devaxopmwnts have been can ter ca around wheat production# 
The agricultural practices developed within this semi-arid area 
are distinctly different from the practices which have been developed in the 
more humid sections of the province# The mdd—board plough is now only very 
infrequently used* since experience has shown that it breaks the soil into 
too fine particles winch blow readily and cause considerable damage to the 
seed bed. Another objection to its use within this area is that it turns 
all vegetation under and falls to leave any trash on top which is essential 
to hole the soil and to prevent it from drifting# 

The mold-beard plough which is held te be a necessity in the 
more humid sections has been practically discarded within the Vule&n-Lomond 
area mid an almost ploughless method of cultivating the soil has been devel¬ 
oped instead# Much of the land now farmed has not been ploughed for years. 

In some sections trie cultivator is not only used for summer!allowing* but is 
made to prepare a seed bed as well# however* this method is not a popular 

method of cultivation within this area. A more effective way of suamerf&l- 
lowing is by the use of the disk plough# This implement is favoured since 
it leaves the soil in lumps* thus guarding against soil drifting# The most 
efficient way of sumaerfftllowing and cultivating is by the use of the "one¬ 
way* # This implement is the best one adapted for use in this semi-arid area 






















** 1U6 •*

and one which really makes farming possible, where soil drifting is quite 
a problem. The use of this implement not only leaves the soil in lumps but 
its advantage lies in that it leaves an abundance of trash on top to prevent 
soil drifting. This method together with strip farming has made it possible 
to continue farming on a paying basis, and up to the present lias contributed 
favourabxy in the combat against adverse physical forces. 

In order to decrease the costs of production, especially during 
periods of low prices, many farmers within the Lomond district especially 
leave their fields idle for one year and let them overgrow with weeds. The 
following spring they burn off the weeds and prepare the soil for seeding# 

They claim that this method of summerfallowing not only increases the nitrogen 

content of the soil, but the weeds keep the soil from drifting. In addition p 

* 

it is c* very inexpensive and labour-saving method of summerfallowing. 

The combine is the most-used implement for harvesting purposes, 
and the uniformity of the ripening of grain favours this method of harvest¬ 
ing# ^he level topography within this area and the extensive use of land en¬ 
hances this method of harvesting by lowering costa of production and enabling 
a single operator with a. small amount of labour to harvest a large area. A 
more recent development in harvesting methods to meet the adverse economic 
conditions is the w barge”* This implement lends itself to harvesting & crop 
which will not pay for the depreciation and operating costs of a combine* 

Ail tills is evidence that the individuals who have been selected 
to stay within the semi-arid areas, have bean able to remain and meet with

some success* ^hey were able to adapt themselves by increasing their 
production at lowered costs through changing their technique of production to 
one that is most suited for the prairie areas* 

bo much for those who are mainly Interested in grain farming* 
the few remaining ranchers especially in the Lomond district have their pro¬ 
blems also* whereas the grain farmer who invaded the area wnen it was thrown 
open for homostending has been perfecting his technique of production, the 
rancher it seems has bean at a standstill* 

the opinion of those within the area who have been interested 
in grassland husbandry is that the natural grass has deteriorated 8u percent 
since the time of settlement* In addition a type of moss has become the pre¬ 
dominant vegetation and is gradually choking out the grass* Ihe carrying 
capacity has been reduced from on® head to thirty acres to one head to sixty 
acres and the opinion is that this ratio should be considerably increased if 
it is expected that in the future the native grass will support livestock 
raising* 

It is difficult to evaluate how much the progress in the state 
of Hie arts is & contributing factor in the financial progress of settlers* 
Nevertheless, the contention is that the settlers within this area have been 

able to keep their land values up and have enjoyed greater incomes because of 
the progressive development in the state of the arts* ^he development of 
methods of production which were successful in combatting the adverse physical 
and climatic factors as well as lowering the costs of production, rather than 
the continued use of the agricultural practices which were brought over with 






























the settlers, has contributed in no small measure to the success of many in-* 
dividu&ls now farming within this area* 


L & i . am..AiManaas 




In addition to the conditions already mentioned which make 
i'or the financial progress of settlers, there are a number of others that 
also exert an important influence on the differences in the financial pro¬ 
gress as between two settlers. 

(a) Management - A settler who sees his problem of organisation as one of 
efficient utilisation of his factors of production under the given condition® 
and applies them carefully to the agricultural resources surrounding him, is 
one who in the long run will show a greater gain from his farming operations* 
dn the other hand, a settler who treats his farming enterprise "as a way of 
life" is one who will not go far in progressing financially or in contributing 
to the welfare of the community which is being built up* 

(b> Psychological - The financial progress of settlers in some cases may 
be attributable to certain psychological influences# One settaer may exceed 
another in a capacity for thrift, a desire for material possessions, or a 

desire for the personal freedom which results from acquiring land or other 
material possessions. 

There are others on the other* hand who take their earnings in 
other forms* there may be extended trips, cars, lavish clothing, higher 
standards of living, etc* Others may even indulge in gambling on the stock 
market, which in many case© results in a mortgaged homestead, although the

reverse situation may be the result# 

c«*> Pay chic Investments - ^ome settle*;. do not show as favourable financial 
progress as their neighbors who are situated under similar conditions because 
they have taken their gains in. psychic investments* it is very difficult to 
measure this type of income and when the financial progress is calculated 
in terms of dollars and cents based on the present assets and liabilities, 
the individuals who have received or are receiving psychic income may show a 
eonsider&b^ lower financial progress* 

These investments are represented in sons or daughters who have 
been sent through colleges and universities at a considerable expense and 
from whom no monetary returns are forthcoming* The only return that a settler 
gets for this is a satisfaction or a psychic income* Compare a case like 
this where a settler sent, say, five sons through the university with another 
who made his five sons work on the farm for which he paid in return meagre 
food and shelter* Other cases may be cited where sons had been set up in 
independent business enterprises from funds which originally came out of the 
farm* 

Some settlers on the other hand may be burdened with perpetual 
hospital and doctors 1 bills because sickness or ill-health is permantly pre¬ 
sent in their household* Compare the present net worth of a settler under 
this condition with his neighbor,,who was not so unfortunate and who was able 
to put his savings into land machinery, livestock and bonds, and great dif¬ 
ferences are found* Nevertheless the farmer may have derived more pleasure 
by providing the necessary care for the sick individual than his neighbor did

in expanding his farm tenfold. 

In a brief summery of the section on the conditions which make 
for financial progress it may be restated that a number of factors make for 
or retard settlers in progressing favourably, borne of the feetore discussed 
were the conditions under which settlement end puochases took place, prices, 
yields, end purchasing power and land values. Capital at start, state of 
the arts and other conditions were also considered. It is the problem of 
the next section to show statistically the differences in financial progress 
as between different groups and to what extent some of the- factors mentioned 
here may have played a part*

flTATlSTUIAL ANALYSIS 

A. PRESENT IhbEBlhDi^S Of SETTnEHS 

An adequate cross-section of tile extent of indebtedness of 
the two districts of Vulcan and Lomond was secured in the 1935 survey* Al¬ 
though & great majority of the farm operators interviewed were heavily in¬ 
debted, a number were found to have no debt. The following is a picture oi 
the indebtedness in the two districts on tine various soil types, with re¬ 
lationship to crop yields, years on this farm, operators* age, size of farm 
and tenure* The relative amount of indebtedness is one of the indices of 
financial progress of settlers* 

1* farm Indekt&dn&&&Ju^ 

The Vulcan and the Lomond districts have definite differences 
with respect to cuimaiic and physiographic factors# *hese would play some 
part in the relative indebtedness oi the settlers within each district. 

In the Vulcan district &L£, or 91 percent of the £3£ inter¬ 
viewed, reported liabilities as compared with £48, or 95 percent of the 
£61 interviewed in the Lomond district* 

The following table indicates the extent of indebtedness for 


the two districts#

for the 252 Vulcan farm operators the average total debt was 
$5,626 as compared with an average of $2,582 for the 261 farm operators of 

Lomond* The greater average indebtedness for the Vulcan farmers may be ex¬ 
plained by the fact that the soil of this district as a whole has been more 
productive over the years than that of the Lomond district* The capacity 
for higher yields over the years is coincident with a higher debt—carrying 
capacity* An index of the past productivity of the soil of these two

district® can be secured by the amount of credit that has been extended in 
the two districts# According to the figures obtained fchft Vulcan owners carry 
a debt of (14.10 per acre of cropland as compared with $6.20 per acre of 
cropland for the Lomond district, however the former have assets to the ex- 
tent of I&4.7U per acre, and the latter $16.10 per acre# The net equity of 
the two districts is relatively the same, being $10.60 per acre oi cropland 
for Vulcan and $9.90 for the Lomond district# In other words it is apparent 
that the operators within the two districts have borrowed to the Unit and 
there is some evidence of long time adjustments# 

In the ©any days, when the future productivity of the soil 
wag overemphasised, it brought about great expansion of social services in 
relation to what could be carried by the productivity of the soil* fax del¬ 
inquency in tii© two areas serves as a measuring stick of the ability to carry 
the past organisation of social services. Xhe Vulcan operators are delin¬ 
quent to the extent of $544 per fans operator, while Lomond operators are 
delinquent to the extant of $200 per farm operator, as the absolute figures 
indicate# the higher tax delinquency figure for Vulcan may be explained by 
noting that Vulcan land is assessed higher and the social services which are 
superior to those of Lomond cost more to main tain. However th© proportionate 
figures give us a different picture. Of the total indebtedness only 6 per¬ 
cent is attributable to tax delinquency in the Vulcan district as compared 
with 8 percent in th© Lomond district# This leads to the conclusion that 
aithough the absolute figure for Vulcan is greater than that for Lomond, 
the proportionate figure indicate® that the Vulc&n farmers are at present 
























- 116 


in a better position to carry the municipal, governmental, end other social 
services* 

The number of tax delinquencies is greater in the nomorid 
district as the figures in the following table indicate*

A greater‘proportion of farm operators are tax delinquents In 
the Lomond districtf the severity of the past depression together with the 
present drought condition no doubt explains why there is a higher percentage 
of tax delinquents in this district* 

The sis© of farms in both districts is large and requires a 
high degree of mechanization* The Vulcan operators cultivated on one average 
6L2 acres and the Lomond operators 486 acres* 

The large farms have encouraged the extension of credit by 
machine companies to the farm operators, and in turn the mechanization of the 
farm has encouraged the growth of the size of farm, particularly in tills 
area where wheat-growing is the principal crop* The number with machinery 
indebtedness is summarized in the following tablet

The figures io the table indicate that a greater proportion of

panies than in the Lomond district* ^n© operator owed as much as $4,075 
for machinery, of which $i,u75 was new credit obtained within the past year 
on a tractor which nad a total of #i,25u a© a purchase price, this farmer 
operates an 800 acre farm, the operator who is indebted to the extent of 
|S,600 in the Lomond district operates a 1,280 acre farm* the indebtedness 
is for the purchase of a tractor and a combine in 1929, much of which is 
still outstanding# This operator found it very difficult to meet principal 
payments and interest payments at 8 percent, ©specially within the recent 
years when low yields and low prices were prevalent# 

For the districts as a whole, the Vulcan operators are indebted 
on the average to the extent of $597, and the Lomond operators $548 per farm 
operator for all farms# When taken as a proportionate figure, however, the 
machinery debt is a much higher percentage of the total indebtedness of the 
Lomond district* 15 percent is attributable to machinery debt for Lomond

and only 7 percent for the Vulcan district. The higher absolute figure in 
the latter district may be partly accounted for by the fact that the acres 
of cropland worked ere higher (602 acres) than that for ^omond (466 acres) 
and consequently & greater need for a larger amount of machinery and in turn* 
credit, 

Recently certain farming areas of Alberta experienced low yields 
or no yields at all due to unusually low precipitation, constituting a drought 
condition. Many farmers in these areas, through no fault of their own, were 
forced to seek aid for the necessities of .life and for feed and seed to carry 
on farming operations, ho private institution would take the risk of ad¬ 
vancing the money with which to carry on* Consequently the municipal!ties 
and the Government took over this function, %he Vulcan farmers are indebted 
to the extent of §51 for relief as compared with §150 per farm operator in 
the noiaond district, The higher figure for ^omand may be explained by the 
fact that the drought has been unusually severe, and many acres which had 
been marginal have become for the time being at least, sub-marginal, and are 
unable to support the individuals who choose to cultivate them. 

The following table briefly summarizes the number with relief 
debt with lowest and highest amounts owing;

indebtedness. The relief that was extended to the Vulcan fanners was not so 
much due to low precipitation as to hail, which destroyed many crops completely 
during the summer of 1954. This of course is not true of the operators on 
the Carmangay Fine Sand, who received large amounts of relief due to loss 
or complete crop failures due to drought conditions. 

It is evident from the above discussion that relief is a greater 
problem in the Lomond district, and is likely to continue to be in the future 

m 

until the land that has become sub-marginal comes back to the marginal, or 

other measures are taken to lessen the problem in the district. It present 
relief is a force which is enabling many operators to stay within the district 

while cultivating sub-marginal I&nd. 

the relief indebtedness gives us a picture of the condition of 
some of the operators as weal as the district for the last lew years, the 





















bank indebtedness on the other hand, reflects what has happened over the 
years* f'he bank debt for the Vulcan area was 4144 per farm operator* or 3

Th© individual witii the present $4* 50b bank debt in Vulcan re¬ 


ported that the original debt was made in 19SB and the amount of the loan was 
#6,500* ine #ll*u56 debt for one farm operator in the Lomond district was 
accumulated over a number of years* The original loan was made in 1919 for 
#4*UuO* during a period of rising prices and great expansion of credit* 
binee then additional loans have been made* which together with accrued in¬ 
terest, amounted to #H*Gg0 in 1935. It is apparent that over the years 
trie Vulcan farm operators were able to meet their bank debts more favourably 


than the Lomond farm operators* 

The land debt is great in any area, since it makes up a large 
proportion of the purchase price of land in most cases* although the land may 

























- i*i - 


be indebted for other reasons than that of the purchase price. In the 
Vulcan district the average land debt per farm operator was $ 4,148 aa com¬ 
pared with $1,511 for the Lomond district. The greater land debt for Vulcan 
is largely attributable to the greater productivity of the land, and hence 
greater farm income. 

Ih© figures indicate that the Vulcan district has proved to 
be more productive per acre than the Lomond district. Compared to the aver¬ 
age wheat yield for Alberta, it is seen that the Vulcan district has been 
among the average districts for wheat production in the Province, 

Over the years there have been greater net returns in the 
Vulcan district and hence a higher purchase price for land has been paid, 
for the thirty-five year average for the Vulcan district the land sold at an 
average price of $£4.36 per acre of which the greater proportion was purchased 
during rising prices, and in the Lomond district at an average price of $9,76 
for the thirty-year average. In addition more farm operators in the Vulcan 
district are in the process of climbing the agricultural ladder, that is, 
they have purchased land and are gradually becoming owners* The Lomond 
district, on the other hand, has a greater number of original settlers. 

Ihese are the reasons that explain the difference in the laud debt.

The 141 farm operators with land debt in the Vulcan district 
owe a total of $962*£47 or an average of $6,824 per operator. The 151 
Lomond farm operators owe a total of $542,159 or an average of $2,612 per 
operator with land debt, however, the owners in Vulcan value their land at 
an average figure of $7,484 as against a corresponding figure of $2,556 for 
the Lomond operators. 

The proportionate figures seem to indicate the same trend. The 
land debt accounted for 74 percent of toe total debt for Vulcan and only 61 
percent for that of to© Lomond district, in spite ox the larger proportion 
of owned land in the latter district. 

The indebtedness attributable to the family *wae practically 
the ana© for both oistricts, toe average indebtedness for Vulcan being 15o 
and for Lomond $128 respectively# Proportionate figures .indicate tn&fc 2 
percent of to© total debt was attributable to toe family for Vulcan and 5 
percent for that of Lomond. 

(1) family Debts include amounts owing for groceries and household goods, 
medical services, and life insurance premiums# 






































The less productive land© carry smaller debt© against them on 
the whole than the more productive onee in spite of the greater ability ol the 
operators on the latter to make principal payments# This is a further in¬ 
dication of the long run adjustment by waich land cost or rent evens out 
the productivity of different districts, thus working toward a levelling out 
of the returns from farming from one district to another# 

Naturally it is difficult at this early stage in the settlement 
of these two areas to note very clearly the effects of various factors on 
the adjustments mentioned* it is difficult to see to what extent the present 
land debt has been the result of acquiring land or credit at a time when ag¬ 
ricultural prices and production were highj on the other hand It is diffic¬ 
ult to estimate to what extent the lack of debt on certain farms is due to 
the acquisition of holding® at a time when prices were very low and operator*© 
savings high. It must be kept in mind, too, that chance crops in certain 
districts have been sufficient in certain years to pay oil very large parts 
of the accumulated indebtedness of certain of the farmers# 

this discussion regarding land debt applies in part to debts 
against machinery and other indebtedness such as loans from the bank, store 
and lumber bills, livestock borrowings and personal and insurance loans# 

Of major interest with these debts, however, is the fact that they are more 
equally distributed between all districts then are the mortgages and agree¬ 



ments of sale# this is due to the nature of the farming practices and the 
normal law of competition respecting the use of machinery and other nan-fixed 
capital* Between Vulcan and Lomond the differences in the farming pract- 
























ices and the requirements of non-fixed capitax are not great and for that 
reason the credit use for these instruments is much more closely related in 
the two districts# Naturally the advancers of money relize that the Lomond 
district is more subject to wide annual fluctuations in production than 
Vulcan and are consequently a little less anxious to make xouna there# 


&« hexatlun. of-S.i mm .of.. FajaiL^... 


M attempt has been made to relate the ext exit of indebtedness 
and the size of farm* for each of the districts, ih© size of farm varied iron 
160 acres up to 4*£8U acres in the Vulcan district and from 16u acres up to 
4*16u acres in the Lomond district for the sample farmers# Ouch great var¬ 
iations in tile size of farms would naturally carl for various amounts of 
machinery* livestock* ©to. The amounts of credit extended to the various 
holdings would also vary# Because the larger farmer has a greater bargaining 
power* he would be able to obtain a xarger degree of credit whether for use 
in acquiring new land or for working capital# 

the figures in fable BQ indicat© the distribution of farms 
according to occupied quarters# *t will be noted that the greatest number 
fall in the three and four quarter groups# It is also interesting to note 
that kb percent of the total farms in the Vulcan district and ZL percent in 
the ^omond district are one-half section or lass in size# In other words* 
the one-quarter section farms &r« few end far between in these, two districts* 
there being only & limited number of farm operators who still farm the quarter- 
section - these being in most cases the original homesteaders#

The acquisition of land in addition to the original homestead 
or holding is nearly always associated with the land debt* fhe amount of 
debt depends on a number of factors - time of purchase, amount paid in cash, 
prices, yield, etc* 2?he trend toward higher land indebtedness as the size 
of the farm increases is fairly clearly indicated in Table 31 (a), that is, 
when measured in absolute figures* ^his debt is chiefiy due to acquisition, 
although mortgages were obtained for other reasons as wen* The proportion— 
al figures show that there is no great degree ox variability between the rand 

debt and ail sizes of farms* However, it is interesting to note that the 
proportion of debt attributable to land indebtedness is greater for quarters 
»9 and ovex- B for both districts. o n the other hand the debt on the smallest 

unit, namely the quarter— section, because no additional laud was acquired be¬ 
yond homesteading, is due mainly to machinery and the xike# Ine tuaount of 

credit extended to the unat holding especially within this area was never

very great, since the bargaining power is much leas than for the larger

It is very interesting to note that application of machin¬ 
ery per acre is at a maximum for the 5 and 6 quarter size farms for Vul¬ 
can. The same tendency is noted for the Lomond district, although it 
is not as distinct as in the former district* 

from the above it would be expected that the larger farms 


would carry a heavier absolute machinery debt per farm, but not per acre* 
This is not evident for the Vulcan farms, as so^e variations are observ-

able, but th© Lomond farms seem to inoicute tads tendency, the debt 
increasing from zero for the smallest farm up to $78u per farm for the 
largest farm reported* dn the other hand, the table indicates that a 
greater machinery debt per acre of cropland is carried by the Lomond 
farmers, although application of machinery per acre of cropland is -ess 
than those of the Vulcan district* The smaller yields, and the severity 
of drought in the former district have depleted the farm income to a 
larger degree then in the latter district* The maximum amount of machinery 
indebtedness is carried by the 5 and 6 quarter sis© of farm which also h«s 
the most intensive application of machinery per acre of cropland*

ures (see Table 51(a)) also increases as tne size of farm increases in 
both districts, it being greater in all cases for the Vulcan district. 

The average amount of tax debt ranged iron $134 for the smallest farm up 
to for the largest farm in the Vulcan district. The range for 

Lomond was from an average ox $114 for the half-section farm up to |469 
for the largest farm, ^hen the proportionate figures are examined no 
great difference can be noticed for farms of various sizes within each 
district as well as between the two districts. However, the percentage 
figures do point out that the indebtedness attributable to tax arrears 
is greater for the unit farms, representing 16 percent of total indebted¬ 
ness for the farms within the Vulcan district and percent for the unit 

4 

farms in the Lomond district* Apparently the farm income per operator 
on the 'unit farm is not of sufficient amount to meet the upkeep of the 
farm, living, and municipal facilities. 

The amounts of relief owed by farmers according to size of 
farm indicate that the larger units have depended xess on governmental 
aid for feed, seed, end necessities of life than the smaller self-sup¬ 
porting unit. The farm operators on the small farms still owe more or 
at least as much a© the ones on the larger farms (see Table 5I(a>). 

There is also a tendency for other farm debts to increase as 
the size of farm increases, but as it win be no tea, tins tendency is 

not uniform and variations are evident in both districts. The proport- 

i 

donate figures present a slightly different picture for the Vulcan farms* 
The percentage attributable to other farm debts is much higher for the

smaller farms than for the larger ones. Tare seam* to be the other way 
for the Lomond farms* 

There is a great deal of uniformity in the increase in the 
total liabilities as the siae of the farm increases for both districts, 
the variations are slight and may be considered negligible. The higher 
land debt, due to greater number of acquisitions, higher cost of oper¬ 
ation, taxes, etc*, no doubt explains a great deal of this tendency* 
however, when taken on a per acre basis no uniformity can be observed 
as the figures in Table 54 indicate*

Summarising the discussion on the relation of sise of farm 
and extent of indebtedness, it may be concluded that there is evidence 
that the extent of indebtedness per farm increased with the increase 
in the size of farm* However, variations were observed when indebtedness 



































was taken on a per acre baai.3, indicating that tne si*e 01 f&ra does 
not alone explain the extent of indebtedness but other factors exist 
and play a part* These include management* years in which debts are 
incurred* price®, as well as physical factors of soil, topography ano.

A fortunate location of the settler with respect to soil or 
a good purchase will have different results in the extent of indebted¬ 
ness, other tilings being equal* Productivity of the ©oil may react in 
two directions, as far as indebtedness is concerned. The more productive 
soil may be expected to carry a higher debt per acre, since operators 
on the better soil usually pay more for their land and are giver* greater 
amounts of credit, or it may carry a lower debt because oi the higher 
net returns and consequently greater savings# A® has been mentioned 
elsewhere, the soil type varies a great deal in these two districts, and 
the productivity varies a great deal mors. 

•In general, the elements needed for crop growth are most 
abundant in the Silt loam (light phase;, and the least abundant in the 
Fine *»and. The *'ine &and as a rule is the least productive type in the 
area surveyed. 

An examination of Table 3d would tend to bear out the state¬ 
ment of Hyatt and Newton to some degree. The average total liabilities 
per farm operator are rowesi for operators on the fiiit loams in both

districts* This would tend to support the argument that over the 
year© these two soil types nave proven to be relatively more product¬ 
ive than others. 

Although the Vulcan soil on the whole is much more product* 
ive than that of Lomond district, different soils of various decrees of 
product!vi,ty are to be found within each district* Xhe figures in l&oie 
56 indicate the number with liabilities by soil types* It is noted 
that a high proportion of the fax's operators on each soil type have 
some liabilities, the range of the highest indebtedness being reported 
for the Vulcan Hilt Loam* This is du© largely to the high prices which 
have been paid for land on this soil, arid not so much due to the low 
returns*

the highest average liabilities ware reported -or the Vulcan 
Loam, the farm operators on this type were indebted to the extent of 























$8*656 per farm operator (see Table 55)* This may be partly explained 
by the fact that the laud debt per operator is very high* viz.* $6*811* 
Some of the original purchases were very high* one individual reporting 
that h© contracted to pay over $45*000 ior 658 acres in 1311 at 7 per-¬ 
cent per annum. Such a high purchase price might be Jus tilled if con¬ 
sistent high yields and high prices are forthcoming* but under the cir¬ 
cumstances it was a poor buy* Although some oi the farm operators 
reported a yield as high as 70 bushel© to the acre in 1915* they also 
reported complete or partial crop failures due to h&ii damage* frost* 
and lack of adequate precipitation* £hi$ lias been particularly true 
since 19&9 which together with the low prices* made it impossible for 
some individuals to reduce any of their debts* 

Tim Vulcan Fine &mdy Loam seems to be the exception to the 
rule* and these farm operators on the average carry the second highest 
land debt* Over fee year© this .soil has been quit© productive as soma 
operators report w always had a fair crop 8 * Others reported yields up 
to forty bushels to the acre* ^ue to the long-time average yield, fee 
farms on this soil sold at a comparatively high price, but one which 
was too high to be paid out of the net earnings* The expectations of 

higher farm incomes in fee future were not realized. 

The average ^labilities per farm operator on fee Blackspring 
Silt Loam is $5,lb9 and the land debt is f 1,103, which figures are much 
lower than for fee other soil types within the district. T : iis would 
tend to support the argument that over fee years this soix type has

proven to be relatively more productive than others* The far* income 
on this soil type has been relatively higher than that on the adjoining 
soil types* 

As is noted in Table 85, the land debt of the operators on 
the fine band is not the heaviest debt item, but that is due to the 
fact that land values have always been low on this type of soil and the 
original purchase prices were at a correspondingly low lever, the aver¬ 
age purchase price for the 1920-55 period, being #12*02 per acre - '*# which 
was a much lower figure than for the other soil types* a high far* 
income was never expected from these farms* Also the original loan 
contracts were extended on the possible future productivity, which, 
over the years, was low*

The number of operators with land debt is indicated in 
fable 59* The percentage of farm operators with land aebt is lowest 
on the Sundial Silt Clay Loam and highest on the Armada Clay -uotua# On 
the whole, the percentage with land indebtedness according to soil types 
is much lower in the uomond district than in the Vulcan district* This 
can be partly explained by the fact that more cash transactions wera 
made in the ^omond district, and since land was purchased at a a .eh

lower figure, it was paid off more rapidly* Apparently it In 3 been 
much easier to climb the agricultural ladder in the Lomond district* 

The expansion of the agricultural plant is quite evident in 
these two districts* ^he number of acres per farm operator is large* 
which calls for an extensive mechanisation of the farm* This in turn 
involves credit for equipping the farm with efficient machinery* T ie 
extent of the credit given and the ability to pay for the machinery will 
in the long run depend upon the relative productivity of the soil* and 
the net farm income# Thus we find that the Blackspring kilt loam of 
the Vulcan district and the Sundial Silt Clay hoam of the Lomond dist¬ 
rict have the most intensive application of machinery per acre of 
cropland. Measured in money* 44*11 worth of machinery is applied per 
acre of cropland in the latter soli type* A summary of the intensity 
of application of machinery per acre of cropland is indicated in

the Olay Loaas Mid Silt hem® are heavier soils to work, 


but since they are aiso more productive they are worked more intensively 


as the figures indicate. 

The relatively high machinery indebtedness on the same 
basis indicates that the lighter soils are probably overcapitalized with 
machinery and are unable to support the present organization with respect 
to mechanisation of the farm* The highest average machinery debt was 
noted for the Vulcan Fine Sandy loam, the farmers on this soil ty e being

inqueacy on the inferior soils. This is true despite the fact that as¬ 
sessments are ordinarily higher on the better soix types. The average 
tax dexinquency lor trie #*l farm operators on the Blaokapring Silt no am 
is $lfc>7, which is considerably lower than for trie other soil types within 
the Vulcan distxlet. The average tux delinquency for tiie 15 farm oper¬ 
ators on the Sundial Silt Clay ho am is &65, which is also considerably 
less than the delinquency for operators on the other soil types within 
the homond district, this is very' clear evidence of tiie importance of 
tiie soii type as a factor in the debt situation. 

the figure quoted for the Sundial Silt Clay loam type 
is especially significant* for it indicates the ability of certain soils 
to support social services over the years. One of the finest and most 
modem schools in the area is to be found in hundial district, which in 
itself is a picture of the healthy financial condition of the operators 
who support this school.

the figures in Table 41 indicate that only 55 percent of 


the operator® on the Blackspring Silt Loan have tax debts in the Vulcan 
district. On the other hand* ail of the operators are delinquent on ths 
Sundial Slit Olay loam, but the amounts owing as tax debts are quite small 
in all cases, also they are delinquent not because they are unable to 
pay, but investigations showed that they exert pressure this way on the 
school district so that they will be given an opportunity to work off 
their tax indebtedness* 

The farm operators on the two most productive soil types 
























- 144 


within the area have resorted less to Government aid in the form of re¬ 
lief than the less fortunate operators on the less productive soils* 
this is well illustrated by figures in Table 45*

The farm operators on the average are indebted only to 
the extent of $1 *00 per operator on the Blackspring Silt loam, which is 
by far the smallest amount when compared to indebtedness for relief on 

the other soil types within the Vulcan district* This amount is due, 
however, to a single operator* The amount of relief debt per farm oper- 








































- 145 - 


ator is $16,00 which is relativexy low for the Vulcan line Sandj- loam* 
This supports the contention that this soil has been relativexy product¬ 
ive over the years, and that the operators were not forced to seek aid 
from the Government to the same extent as those on the other soil types# 
The operators on the Carmangay Fine band, however, received relief to the 
extent of $6o#00 per operator, the highest for the district as a whole; 

51 percent of the operators on this soil type owe money for relief re¬ 
ceived# Low yields and total ox*op failures forced a majority of the op¬ 
erators to seek municipal and Government aid at one time or another# 

Lome have been receiving aid almost annually since the war. 

In tiie Lomond district, with the exception of operator© 
on the Sundial Silt Clay Loam, the relief indebtedness is very high# 

The operators on the Sundial Soil have an average relief debt of v43.Uu, 
only 46 percent having any relief indebtedness# The operator© on the 
Lomond Fine bandy Loam owe on the average $13S for relief, Which is the 
highest figure when compared with the otiler ©oil types. This soil ha© 
been unproductive over the years, and most of thi® soil is at present 
sub-marginal» The above discussion clearly indicates the importance of 
soil as & factor in providing a livelihood to the individuals over the 

years# 

Bank credit has been extended quite freely ih the past 
in both districts# if the present bank indebtedness is any indication 

of the extension of this type of credit in the past, then the operators 
on the various soil types have been able to secure different amounts, de-

In order to demonstrate couclusivexy that soli type Is

have presented a comparatively detailed picture of the conditions sur— 
rounding the relationship existing between the two factors, via., soil 
type arid operator’s indebtedness. Evidence indicates that operators on

on the poorer soil types.

w Many tracts of land now are used by those who can approp¬ 
riate and exploit them, this further reduces their productivity, which 
is below the average to begin with.®' 1 * Tills statement may weix be applied 
to many acres of farm land, particularly in the Lomond district. There 
is some evidence from general observations that tenants and to some be- 

. 

gree part owners as wexj., tend to use the land with a view toward ob¬ 
taining the greatest immediate returns possible without giving much thought 
to the future productivity of the soil. Many of the present owners of 
the land are situated elsewhere, and have no opportunity oi supervising 
the type of cultivation that should be carried on in order to preserve 
future productivity* Others resit out their rand, because they are unable 
to operate it themselves due to financial reasons, or because they do not 
wish to take upon themselves the risk which is associated with the grow¬ 
ing of a crop, especially within the Lomond district. Tenants, especially

during drought periods, increase the economic and social instability, 
since they tend to move around quite frequently. Part owners on the 
other hand tend to remain much longer on the land than tenants. They 
usually rent some land in addition to their own holdings in order to 
arrive at a more economical farming unit. &nce they are also ac¬ 
quiring land and progressing towards complete ownership, they are ex¬ 
pected to be moi’© heavily indebted than either owners or tenants. The 
owners have remained on the land the longest as the figures in Table 45 
indicate. The tenants, on the other hand, have been on their present 
farms a very short time, and have attained only the second rung of trie 
agricultural ladder*

the Lomond owners on the average being indebted to the extent of f1,275

A greater proportion of toe part owners have lend debt, 
85 percent of them reporting debt on their land as compared with 75 

percent for owners in the Vulcan district. The Lomond district shows 
the same tendency as Indicated by the figures. This tendency can be 
partly explained by the fact that part owners expect to m&£e greater 

savings from their operations, since they operate much -larger tracts 
of cropland as the figures In the following table indicate*

The tenants. 

on the other 

hand* take none 

of the risk 


which accompanies ownership of land, but choose to male© payments through 
rent* which during years of depression and adverse physical conditions 
does not amount to a sufficient sum to pay for the interest on capital* 
'This throws an extra burden on the landlord during periods of drought 
and row prices* They have to take up the ©lack in costs through taxes* 
interest on capital* and deflated land values# 

Because ordinarily they do not stay on the same farm for 
great lengths of time* and since they usually have smaller assets than 
other tenures* tenants tend to work their rand less intensively than 
part owner® or owner®* Because of their less permanent nature and since 
they are oracticully at the bottom ox the agricultural ladder* the re¬ 
sources which they have at their disposal are usually very ximited# 

This is quite true with respect to machinery* They only apply on the 
average §2*4 of machinery per acre of cropland in the Vulcan district

Seventy-two percent of the part owners had tax debt in

debt. The lowest amount owing for owners was $44 and the highest $4,082, 
wnile for part owners the range was $56 to $1,492* in the Lomond dist¬ 
rict 95 percent of the part owners had tax indebtedness as compared with 
81 percent of the owners, in spite of the fact that the former have a 
less proportion of taxable land than the latter. 

A fur tiler examination of Table 46 r weals that the tenants 
in the Vulcan district owe on the average $45 per operator for relief. 

The comparatively high relief debt is partly explained bv the fact that 
14 out of the 5U tenants operated on the Gannang&y Fine band which is 
very unproductive, and has been so particularly during the lust few 
years of drought. In addition Sid tenants operated in sections which 
were hard hit by hail during the crop year of 1934 and 1955. 

the figures in the game table indicate that there ie very 
little difference in the amounts owing for owners and part owners in 
the Lomond district, the former being indebted to the extent of $154 on 
the average and the latter to an amount of $158 per operator* The ten¬ 
ants are indebted to & somewhat lesser degree, their debt for this item 
amounting to $123 on the average* However, a very high proportion, 

91 per cent, had relief indebtedness in tills district, as indicated by 

the figures in Table 51*

forty-ton percent of the tenants in the Bican district 
had relief indebtedness, which figure was much higher than that of the 
other tenures* Evidently the tenants were forced to resort to the 
Government for aid more frequently <*nd in greater numbers than were 
owners or part owners# In ether words, the margin of cultivation has 
been sain tamed to some extent through Government He-ief# 

The figures in fable 46 also indicate that the average 
bank debt is quit© high per operator, but this is not attributable to 
recent credit extended by the banks to the farmers, but goes back many 
years# Some of the bank debts have been renewed by notes, the original 
borrowing dating back as far as 1315# An example of tills is displayed 

























156 - 


by a farm operator in the botaond district who borrowed $4 ,uju in 1315 
and who twenty years later still owes $£Ud on the some debt* Incident¬ 
ally this same operator paid back $50 last year on the Some debt, $5£ 
of which was credited, as a principal payment, and $18 as interest* 
Conclusion© are not to be drawn, however, that no bank credit hus been 
extended to farm operators within these two districts during recent 
years* a number of farm operators owe bank debts which were contracted 
alter 1929, and a number of farmers received aid in the form of bank 
credit within the last year* Evidently the more dependable farmers 
have been extended this type of credit recently, despite the prevalence 
ox low yields, low prices and drought conditions*

tenure, is summarised in the following tables

On the whole it may be concluded that the bank debt per 
operator for the various tenures does not picture the present facilit¬ 
ies for the extension of credit, but it rather pictures what has been, 
namely the great expansion oi credit in the years gone by, wnich was 
advanced on the overemphasised future productivity of soil, during perm 
iods of abnormally high prices, precipination, and yields. 

further perusal of fable 46 reveais that the owners in 
the Vulcan district have been able to secure more credit in the field 
which is classified as n 0 iher farm Debts 1 ’# On the average they are in¬ 
debted to the extent of |55& per operator as compared to an average debt 
of $4SI per operator for part owners and $E53 per operator for tenants* 
The farm operators on the whole were extended less credit in this field 
in the Lomond district, but contrary to the Vulcan district findings, 
the part aimers are most heavily indebted, their debt on the average 
being 4Sou per operator# The average debt for other tenures is somewhat 
lower, being §18 S per operator for the owners and $X5o per operator for 
the tenants# 

in order to get sufficient capital to keep the farm going 
during the past years of low prices and low yields, every possible source 

of credit was explored# The part owners were able to obtain the margest 
amount of credit as the figures on total liabilities in Table 46 indicate* 
This of course is due to a great extent to their land debt# These op¬ 
erators have a total average debt of §7,153 in the Vulcan district and 
$5 ,481 in the Lomond district# The tenants, because of their general

mobile nature and instability, received the least amount of credit 
per operator, hence on the whole they are indebted to a much teaser 
degree. Their average total debt is $796 in the Vulcan district and 
$655 in the oomond district. The average to tar debt for owners in the 
former district is $6,788 and for the latter district $2,45o. 

In summarising this section it may be ©aid with respect 
to the Vulcsn-bomond area that the part owners are indebted most heavily, 
but this is explained by the fact that they are acquiring new land and 
expanding their holdings, thus a large proportion of their totix indebt¬ 
edness is made up of the original purchase price oi' land. The owners 
were the second most heavily indebted, but since they have remained the 
longest on their farms, they are gradually acquiring complete equity in 
their farms and equipment* It has ax so been shown that tenets have 
been extended the least credit, but they are not encumbered with land 
debt or tax debt, and the ©mount of credit extended to them in machinery 
is expected to be xow since the credit extended to them carries more 
risk.

fables IV (a; and IV (bj in the Appendix present figures 
indicating the relationship between tenure, soil and district. The 
phenomenon which was observed in the last section, viz., that part owners 
have a higher land debt, is not present when the factor of soil is intro¬ 
duced. It will be noted that in some of the soil types the situation 
is reversed, i.e., the owners are more heavily Indebted on some soil types,

e#g#, of those on the Vulcan Loam, the owners on the average are in¬ 
debted to the extent ol $9,685 per operator, while the part owners are 
indebted $6,598 per operator# This may be partly explained in that the 
part owners have been longer on their farms than the owners# The former 
have on the average been 18*9 years on their farms and the matter 18*1 
years# However, tills cannot be regarded as & definite conclusion# The 
same variations are noticeable when other debts are examined* It may 
be mentioned however that when total liabilities are examined there is 
some evidence ox more consistency, i#e#, ’the part owners are more heavily 
involved, followed by owner©, the tenants showing the least total lia¬ 
bilities*

The si£8 ox farm and tenure are two variable factors which 
may influence the amount of credit extended, and hence the amount of 
accumulated debt# The owners of land choose to take fiux of the risk 
associated with the rise and fall in land values, while the part owners 
share only a portion of the risk, the extent of which depending on how 
much land they actually own and how much they rent# Tenants on the 
other hand, take none of the risk involved in the rise and fail of land 
values#

each tenure the amount of debt would increase as the size oi farm in¬

holds true when the two districts are compared, how what differences 
are noted when the factor of tenure i© introduced? 

fables V(a ) and V(b), Appendix, give us a picture with 
respect to these two variables* it is noted from the figures in these 
two tables that as the size of farm increases the amount ol. debt also 
increases, with a slight break in the trend for all tenure* It is also 
interesting to note that on the whole the owners within the two dist¬ 
ricts are more heavily indebted than the part owners on thi© type ox 
classification, although reverse indications in one or two case© are 
also evident* 

When the owners and part owners in the Vulcan district 
are compared it is found that the total inabilities of the owners are 
much greater per operator than for the part owners* this is due in 
part to the fact that owner© own more land than the part owners, as the 
figures in the following table indicate;

When the figures in this table are compared with those 
in Table V(&) Appendix, it is evident that the higher land debt per op¬ 


erator for the owners is due to the fact that larger tracts of ^and are 


owned by them, this explanation is also sufficient when tax delinquency 
figures are examined, larger farms would be assessed higher, other things 


being equal* 


Of interest is the relief indebtedness when examined for 
owners and part owners* The amount of relief indebtedness, decreases 
as the size of farm increases with a slight variation for that of owners

edness decreases as the size of farm increases .or both owners and part 
owners* although variability is quite noticeable in both. The trend 
for the amount of relief indebtedness to increase as the size of farm 
increases is uniform for tenants* The amount of rehLef indebtedness 
per operator increases from |66 per one-quarter section size 01 farm 
up to $19k per operator for 7 and Q quarters grouping, no relief in¬ 
debtedness being reported for farms of 9 quarters and over, but only 
one operator reported in tills grouping* The bank and other farm debts 
show no uniform tendency to increase or decrease with the size of farm* 
This is in agyeement with findings in the Vulcan district as well. 

The amount of indebtedness per operator for the total fan indebtedness 
increases as the size of farm increases for all tenure* The same is 
also true for the total liabilities*

It is well known that farmers in general have received 
only a minimum of credit since X9U9* The credit facilities have been 
contracted during the downward phase of the business cycle. The low 
prices for agricultural products, and debt legislation, were respon¬ 
sible for the lack of confidence on the part of lenders, with respect 
to agricultural loans. The present lack of credit extension is in 

direct contrast to the great expansion during the pehod of rising prices

previous to iDkO. In general, the farmers have expanded their holdings 
since then with increasing difficulty of obtaining credit* It is not 
surprising also* that many oi the operators have been forced, through 
lack of ready funds or credit, to limit the intensity with which they 
work their laud* In many instances, large tracts of land which would 
otherwise have been worked thoroughly by summerfallow methods have been 
either very lightly scratched or left entirely idle. Xhe amount of 
new credit extended and payments of principal and interest made by the 
farmers of the study is shown in the following tables*

"s tlie figures in tiie first table indicate, the Vulcan 
farm operators were able to pay back in principal $5ik per fc.ra operator 
as compared to $75 which was paid back by the Lomond operators for the 
year 1954-55* A higher average payment for the Vulcan operators is ex¬ 
pected since they are on the average more heavily indebted* another 
factor which is of greater importance in deciding whether the principal 
and interest will be paid, and in what amounts, is the amount of the net 
earnings* The Vulcan farmers on the average had labour earnings of £185, 
while the Lomond farmers had on the average only $66 as xabour earnings. 
The higher amounts paid in principal and in interest by the Vuxcaa farmers 
are coincident with higher net earnings* However, not ail of the I’ara 
operators were able to make payments* Qi the ill farm operators who were 
indebted in the Vulcan district, 158 or 75 percent mad© principal payments 
in order to reduce their outstanding indebtedness. The lowest principal 
payment was $1 and the highest $7*955, of which $7,80U was paid by giving 
up a parcel of land In order to meet the indebtedness against it, thus 
indicating to some degree the inability to pay in cash. The strenuous 
times have forced this type of liquidation onto the farm people in general 
and particularly in the drought-stricken areas. 

In the Lomond district 157, or 95 percent of the operators 
of the 148 that had any liabilities made principal payments* The lowest 
payment was fi and the highest $1,141, of which $8U0 was a payment to the 

bank lor a current loan. This type of operator has had no difficulty in 
obtaining bank loans even during the past years when agricultural loans 


were very risky. 



























166 


Interest pay&bxe is another indication of relative indebted*^ 
ness, and extension of credit to various districts o.n the past. The 
Vulcan farmers on the average had $54o oi“ interest payment to meet, of 
which $158 or 47 percent was paid. The nomoud farmers on the average 
had $156 interest payments to meet, of which $29 was paid, or 2x percent. 
Better average yields and larger net earnings explain why trie Vuucan farm¬ 
ers on the average were able to make a better showing in interest payments. 
The severity of the drought and reduced yields did not affect Vulcan farm¬ 
ers to the same extent as the nomond farmers were affected. 

In tiie VuiC&ii district, j.94, or 84 percent of the 252 farm 
operators interviewed had interest payments falling due during the year 
±954-55. Of those that were supposed to make interest payments, 141 or 
75 percent actually made payments* The interest payable ranged from $1 to 
$4,5$i, of wMch $4,525 wm accrued interest and of the balance only fio8 
was paid in cash. The range for the interest paid varied from $4 up to 
$2,945, of which $2,868 was paid by turning in one parcex of property to 
the trust company to pay interest on a $59,uuu aebt. This is a further 
indication as to the method resorted to in liquids.ting debts, in addition, 
158 farm operators of the 194 that had interest to pay reported accrued 

t 

interest. The accrued interest ranged from $1 up to $4,425, of which $548 
was on agreement of sale, $2, 926 on mortgages, $ 22 k on emitter, mortgages, 
$659 for arrears in taxes, and $77 for a personal account. 

in the homoud district, 252, or 89 percent of the sample farm 
operator© reported interest payable. 





















- 167 - 




Oi* the 252 that were supposed to make interest payments* only 
124 or 55 percent actually paid any interest* The amounts oi' interest 
payable ranged from $1 up to $95U. The raage for interest actually paid 
varied from vl up to $559* of which $556 was on -an agreement of sale and 
$5 for arrears in taxes* Two hundred end fourteen operators of cl*, that 
reported interest payable also reported interest accrued* for these* the 
aceruea interest ranged from $1 up to 4957* the letter figure bexng made 
up of $11 on relief account* $894 for agreement of sale* and $82 for im¬ 
plements* Ail this is an indication that when loans were mode* the farm¬ 
ers as well as the credit houses failed to take sufficient cognizance of 






the farmer 1 s ability to meet debts* 


The total new credit extended to the two districts during 
the 1954-55 crop year differed considerably* The Vulcan farm operators 
on the average ware advanced 4557* of which 1555 or 66 percent was new 
credit and $181 or 45 percent was accrued interest* The range of the 
to tax new credit which was advanced was from $2 up to *3,203* of which 
$7*055 -was for the purchase of a new parcel of land* $1,122 for new mach¬ 
inery and $46 was forced credit* i*e** accrued interest* 

The ^amond farmers received a somewhat lower average ad¬ 
vance of new credit* The amount received per operator was $561* of which 
4254 or 70 percent was new credit and $107 or 50 percent was accrued in¬ 
terest* k large part also of the $254 was of an involuntary nature since 

relief and current taxes unpaid is included in this figure* The amount 
of forced credit is much greater than that for the Vulcan district* The 


































• 160 


recent drought conditions in the Lomond dietriet are no doubt responsible 
to a large degree lor this condition- lor those who received advances in 
the form of new credit or accrued interest, the lowest amount was $1 and 
the highest was $5,626, the latter amount being made up of $1,915 for new 
machinery, $ld for blacksmith, $215 for hail insurance, $I5w for lumber, 

$8o for hardware, $6U for farm wages, $127 for traces, $10 for the doctor, 
$700 for a bank loan, and $559 was accrued interest, this iast represent¬ 
ing an accrual of $540 on an agreement of sale of land plus tax penalties 
amounting to $19 • 

It is not to be inferred from the above discussion that 
aXi farmers in bo til districts needed or were abxe to secure new credit. 

It is not easy to secure new credit, and many farmers, because of their 
financial status were unable to receive credit although it was needed. 

Lome, on the other hand, because of their past savings, had no need to rely 
on anyone to carry them, but ware able to make cash payments for what was 
needed. 

In summarising this section, it is evident that on the whole, 
the Vuican farmers were able during the past year to meet their oblig¬ 
ations to a greater extent than the Lomond farmers* also they were able 

to secure new credit in greater amounts, but no figures can be presented 
to sliow wh&t amounts of credit were advanced through relief ana non-payment 
of taxes on both districts. Tide is a phase of the study that might be 
further investigated*

As the farm operator buixds up his farm from one quarter to 
a number of quarters, or when purchases are made, it is expected that the 
larger organised farm plant nil- be more heavily indebted for this reason 
alone. In the sectioxi on indebtedness this has been enown to be true. 
Since this is true with indebtedness, it is expected that the xarger .arms 
would be in a position to make larger principal payments, as well as int¬ 
erest payments, because of 'their greater earnings. Other things being 
equal, the amount of new debt extended would be greater for the larger 
farms and less for the smaller farms. 

fables VI (&) and VI {b}, Appendix, summarise the average and 
percentage distribution in the debt position for the year 1934-55 for the 
two districts, according to si m of farm. It is Interesting to note that 
as the si as of farm increases, the amount of principal paid in general 
also increases, there being only one or two variations. In the Vu-cun 
district the average principal payment for the smallest farm was $57, and 
for the largest |955. 

a similar correlation between size of farm and principal 
payments is noted for the bomond district, but the trend is not so uni¬ 
form. *a .80 the principal payments for corresponding size of farm art-, on 
the average much lower than those of the Vulcan district. 

the same table indicates that the total new debt increases 

with tixe increase in size of farm, ihe trend is uniform for the hoaond 
district, and only one break in the trend is noted for tne 7 and 8 quarter 
























grouping in the Vulcan district* Xt is evident that the ability to get 
credit in larger amounts is associated with increase in the size of far* 
holding• In other wards* the larger operators have greater bargaining 
power* 

Probably a truer measure of ability to get credit as the 
size of farm increases is the extension of new credit. Tie amount of cre¬ 
dit per operator for the smallest farm in the Vulcan district vas £43 f and 
for tile largest was $651* Tile farm operators in the ho mo no district on 
the smallest farms received an average figure of $77* while tnose oper¬ 
ating the largest farms received $458 per operator. It wiix be noted that 
the small farmers in the Lomond district received almost half as much 
again of new credit when compared with the amount received by the cor¬ 
responding group in the Vulcan district, fhis condition is due to the 
larger amount of relief received by ‘the small, operators in this district. 

fh# accrued interest ha© a tendency to increase as the 
size of farm increases* i.e** in absolute amounts* but the proportion of 
new credit represented by accrued interest decreases with the size oi 
farm, the former trend is indicated in fable VI(ay Appendix* and the lat¬ 
ter in fable VI (b) A ppendix. Xn other words* for the sm&ixer farms* the 
percentage received as new credit exclusive of accrued interest* was smal¬ 
ler than tiie accrued interest* but for the larger farms evidently the 
converse is true. 

the larger the farm the larger is the absolute indebtedness 
carried* and in turn the interest payable aiso increases with the size

It Is vary interesting to note that ability to pay off in¬ 
debtedness is closely related to labour earnings oi the farm operators on 


the various soil types for the year in question. The labour earning© 
are indicative of the productivity of the soil type. 

although the relationship between labour earnings and the 
ratio of indebtedness to the amount paid off is not as close in the Lom- 

ond district as in the Vulcan district, still there is some evidence of 
tills relationship* Another indication of relative ability to pay debts

The figures in the above table indicate that all of the 


farmer© who had liabilities on the Vuican Pine »%ndy loam made in lull or 
in part# the principal payments failing due for the 1954-55 crop year* 

The lowest number making payments were for those on the Carmangay Fine 
Sand, where only 47 percent of the indebted farmers made payments* 

In the JUomond district on the Armada Clay Loam, 81 percent 
of trie farmers with obligations made principal payments, which is a higher 

figure than for any other soil type* The operators on the same soli type 
made on the average $iS& as principal payments, which was higher than the

The figures indicate that in proportion to what they owe, 
tine tenants have made the greatest payments, but they have also made the 
greatest net earnings as tne figures on labour earnings indicate* They 
have not taken til© loss which is associated with land owneraiiip wnen dr¬ 
ought conditions and reduced price© are taken into account* The tenants 
also do not possess that bargaining power for credit which is associated 
with land ownership* Therefor©, in order to keep up their l^ne of credit 
in the future, they have to make payments to a greater extent tnan farm¬ 
ers of tne other tenures*

As tiie si as of farm increases the amount of new credit ex¬

the Appendix^ for ail tenures* The amount of credit extended to the 
larger operators ia due to the greater bargaining power and to the reater 
amounts of forced credit in the form of accrued interest when payments 
are not met# The larger farms may have larger net returns but they may 












also have larger net losses when adverse conditions have to be met*

The relation between tenure, soil type and ability bo meet 
financial obligation© is indicated in Tables 1(a) and Mb) in the Ap¬ 
pendix* The figures indicate that the amount of accrued interest is least 

for all tenures in the Bi&ckspring Silt *o«a* This is one ol th© most 



























productive soils, and apparently even during times of adverse economic I 1 
and physical conditions, the farmers operating on tills soil are able to 
meet their financial obligations to a greater extent than chose on the 1

district (see Table 1(b), Appendix;. 


C. THE RELATION 01 TOTAL LIABiUIlnb TO THE AVEKaGE NET tfOHTH 
■ -^1)11KM. 1MI JiAHli 


In order to get a mors thorough understanding of indebted¬ 


ness and financial standing of the farmers in the two districts of Vulcan 


and Lomond, an attempt is mad© in tills section to discuss the amount of 
indebtedness in relation to the present value of assets. There are 

■ *' s ■ 

various causes which will influence the ratio between indebtedness and as¬ 
sets from year to year. Some of the most immediate causes are the amount 
of credit that is extended, the tenure of operators, short-time yields 
of wheat, efficiency of operators, etc. The long-time causes are wheat 
yialds over the years, type of soil, precipitation, fluctuation in price 
of farm products, and changes in land values* The ratio of liabilities 
to assets fluctuates greatly with the fluctuations in the business cycle. 







During the depression phase of the business cycle liabilities tend to 
increase while assets tend to contract in value. Tills is particularly 
true of land values. Both the deflation of assets and the increase of 

outstanding liabilities are accelerated by physical factors such as drought, 
and soil drifting in particular areas. This has been true particularly

1. uelationship of Liabilities to Assets and farm Debt to Operators 1 

Pi a trie ta-*-— 

The farmers of the Vulcan and Lomond districts have, over 
the years, been able to get different amounts of credit, this difference 
being due to the differences in the productivity of the soil, as well as 
the variation in climatic conditions. However, the absolute savin,,s as 
indicated by net worth figures are relatively different for the two dist¬ 
ricts, being greater where over the years the yields have been highest, 
i.e,, in the Vulcan district. 

Of the 25k farmers interviewed in the Voxcun district, 
k±2 or 91 percent reported that they had some liabilities. In the Lom¬ 
ond district £48 of the £61 operators interviewed reported ul&bilities, 
i.®., 95 percent of the total number were indebted. Iii the former area, 
for the sample farmers, the average value of assets is $15,015 and 'the 
average value of liabilities is f'5,616, or 45 percent of the total assets* 
In the latter area, the average value of assets is $6,348 and the liabil¬ 
ities #£,5S£, or 59 percent of the total assets, fhe higher average fig¬ 
ure for bom assets and liabilities in the former area is due mainly to 
the higher land valuation, and consequently higher* land, deot, which in 
part is the result of the higher prices paid for land. However, over the 
years, farming in the Vulcan district has been more remunerative than in 
the Lomond district, when, measured in terms of net worth figures, the

The figures in the table indicate that the amount of oper¬ 


ators* capital applied per farm in Vulcan is much greater than that of 
the farmers in the Lomond district* The former hare on an average CiU|7S8 































invested in the farms they own or operates the latter aa average of 
$5,196. The former also have a larger farm debt per farm, £6,496, and an 
equity in their farm of $5,&4& as compared with Lomond, operators, who 
report an average debt of $£,454 per farm and an equity of fg,74£. Thus 
in terms of absolute figures the operators in the Vuican district have 
on the average, a much greater equity in their farms. It is interesting 
to note also that in terms of proportionate figured the ^oraoud operators 
have a greater equity in their farms, via., 55 percent as compared to 49 
percent in the Vulcan district. This can be explained by the fact that 
the Lomond district over the years has not been so productive -and that 
creditors were not as willing to advance credit to the same extent In 
this district as in the Vulcan district. Furthermore, the larger item of 
land is of much less magnitude in the eastern district. 

In summing up true section it may be concluded that on the 
whole the Vuxcaa farm operators are m a much heautruer financial con¬ 
dition than the Lomond operators, despite the fact that larger average 
indebtedness is reported for the former district. Be net worth figures 
as well &b the operators* equity in absolute figures are aaso much higher 
in the former district.

Mie apparent lncret.ee of assets and net worth as the size 
of farm increases is cxosely related to the fact that the percentage of 
assets due to land value also increases with the size of fans* but the 
proportion that liabilities are of assets does not increase with the 
increase in the size of farm* 

When the assets and liabilities are compared tor the var¬ 
ious sizes of farms as between the two districts in terms of proportion¬ 
ate figures* no significant difference can be noted* although minor dif¬ 
ferences are apparent* 

fablex X(n; and X(b) in the Appendix present also the av¬ 
erage and percentage distribution or operators 1 capital, farm ciebt and 
operators* equity* The trend for these items is similar to that of as¬ 
sets* liabilities and net worth* i*e«* the operators* capital* farm debt 
and operators* equity increase with the increase of the size of farm in 
a steady progression when taken in terms of absolute figures* However* 
when taken in terms of proportionate figures the farm debt shows variab¬ 
ility, but on the whole a trend is observable, i*e** the percentage the 
farm debt is of operators* capital tends to decrease with an increase 
in the size of farm. Tills is true for both districts. 

in gumming up this section it may be generalized for the 
area as a whole that in terns of absolute figures, the assets, liabilit¬ 
ies and net worth increase with the increase in the size of farm* i*e.* 

other things being equal* the size of farm has an important bearing on 
assets* liabilities* and net worth of the farm operators. However, when 

the proportionate figures are used as a measuring stick* who generallm*

ation which was made previously, indicating that the amount oi indebted¬ 
ness varies directly with the size oi farm does not hold. Evidently 
there are other causes which have an influence. ihese will be discussed 
in later sections. 

8* bor^i. ana Soil 

in the previous section it was shown that the size oi t ana 
played a part in influencing the average value oi assets, net worth, etc. 
m endeavor 'dll now be mad© to show what part the sod. plays in lining 
the magnitude oi assets, liabilities and net worta. *or this part of the 
discussion, tenure is disregarded, the variable factor under inspection 
being the soil. 

fables 84(a) and 64(b) indicate the average ~nd percentage 
distribution of assets, liabilities and net worth according to soJU type, 
liie figures indicate that in the Vulcan district the farm operators on 
the blackspring Silt am have an average of bitf,659 as their assets and 
their liabilities are $5,^69, or 14 percent of the total assets, The 
high figure for the assets is due partly to the high land valuation and 
partly to the high capital investment of the farmers on tills soir type, 
the low liabilities (the lowest in terms of proportionate figures) are 
due mainly to the high productivity of the soil, the farmers on this 
soil type over the years have been able to make great savings. fthils 
the farm operators on the Blackspring Slit no an have the highest aver¬ 
age assets, the fans operators on the barman gay fine Sand have the low¬ 
est, their assets on the average being $5,496 and their liabilities $4,052 
















- 187 - 


or 74 percent of their assets* Their low assets aro mainly due to low 
land valuation, since the productivity of tills soil type has been low 
over the years* The .high figure for liabilities is not due to the fact 
that credit has been extended to them extensively, but dee mainly to 
the inability of the farm operators to meet their obligations, because 
of poor yields or no yields at all* The liabilities also have been 
amplified by government relief, which was highest per operator on tills 
soil type* 

A similar difference is noted also between these two soil 
types when farm capital is examined# The farm operators on the Black- 
spring Lom, report an average of $16,180 as operators* capital, -and 

their farm debt as $5,050, or 19 percent of the operators* capital* $he 
farm operators on the C&rmsng&y line band report $4,777 as the average 
value of tile operators 8 capital, §5,958 as the average farm debt, or 32 
percent ox the operators* capital, and $859 as the average value of oper¬ 
ators* equity or 18 percent of the operators* farm capital* 

The above quoted figures for the two soil types represent¬ 
ing • the extremes in productivity support the argument that the highest 
assets and lowest liabilities are to be found on the more productive 

soil, the reverse being true for the less productive soiis* This is es¬ 
pecially wrue when most of the original settlers are still on the land* 

It is also interesting to note that the average net worth in the Vulcan 
district follows the relative productivity of the soli over the years* 

The soils are arranged according to the average net worth as follows*

The figures in the last column indicate that the farmers on 
the r, lack spring Silt hom are in the strongest financial position, while 
those on the Oaraumgay Fine &aud are in the weakest. The liabilities 
for the latter are E#81 times as great as their net worth, indicating 
clearly that settlement without knowledge of local resources and diller~ 
encss does not pay* the relatively poor showing for the farmers on the 
Vulcan I*osit is explained to a great extent by the great decrease in land 
valuation, the severity of the depression evidently having a great deal 
to do with it* The farmers as a whole, however, in the Vulcan district 
showed solvency, the liabixities being u*70 of the net worth* 

In the Lomond district the farm operators on the Sundial 
Silt &lay Loam show the strongest financial position, as Tables 64(a) and 
84(b) on p&gesi88 and 189 indicate* The average value of their assets 
is $i£,9L6 and their liabilities Ik,453, or 19 percent of the assets. 














- 191 - 


Peculiarly enough the Lomond *ine hand has a comparatively good allowing 
when compared with some of the other eoil types. The farm operators on 
this soil v&j.u© their assets at $6,610 and their liabilities at $1,719 
or £6 percent of the assets* l‘h© high figure for the assets may be ex¬ 
plained by the fact that out of 17 farm operators, one had bonds to the 
v&xue of $&6,00u, and another operator, to the extent of $ 14 , 000 , These 
figures tend to give a misleading picture when taken on an average for 
17 farm operators* also the high assets are partly causod by semi-ranch¬ 
ing adjustment, a type of organisation which is quite suited to and remun¬ 
erative on this soil type. 

The farm operators on the other soil types have iiabilities 
which are 40 to 46 percent of their assets, and therefore uo appreciable 
difference can be noted as between different soim types for the Lomond 
■district* It must b© remembered here that abandonment of large tracts 
of land in tills district has tended toward adjustment* 

When the figures in Table® 64(a) and 64(b) are examined for 
operators* capital and farm debt, the proportionate figures for far® 
debt ©how an increase, thus indicating that farm operators have outside 
investments* 

&& in the Vulcan district, the farm operators on the best 
soil type have the highest assets* The following table snows the soils 
arranged according to the average net worth of operatorsi

the ratio of net Worth to liabilities indicates that the 


farmers on the Sundial Silt Clay Loam are in the strongest financial 
position, while those on the Armada Clay Loam are in the weakest financial 
position, Xhe reuativeuy strong position of those on the Lomond line 
bandy boil is due to large outside investments which did not come out 
oi the farm, as has been pointed out previously* 

In summarising this section, it may be generalized that farm 
operators on the better soil types have larger net worths and lower lia¬ 
bilities in proportion to their assets* Xhe higher assets are influenced 
of course by the higher land valuation, while the lower liabilities in 
proportion to the assets indicate that over the years the farmers on 
these better soil types have been able to make large net savings as well 
as being able to pay for depreciation on the equipment and replacement 


cost*

4. R»ta«m Assets. LlabiXltles tmc. tenure 

Tenure is another variable factor which nay influence the &ao 
of credit extended* Thus* since the tenants do not participate in 
land acquisition or ownership* their average liabilities would be much 
lower than that for owners or part owners# This is quite true for both 
districts when the basis of comparison is in absolute figures (Table 
67)* When the comparison is on the basis of proportionate figures this 
tendency is also evident in the Vulcan district but not in trie aomond 
district* 

In the Lomond district liabilities of the tenants represent 
hi percent of their total assets* The high liability figure is due 
mainly to the credit extended by rexiei and not so i&uch in machinery* etc* 
la other words* the tenants in the Lomond district are in a weak fin¬ 
ancial position for their liabilities exceed their net worth as figures 
in the following table indicate.

The weakened financial position for owners and part owners 
is partly due to reduction in land values* The iow prices and depres¬ 
sion had a greater effect on the Vulcan farmers than on the farmers in 
the Xaomond district where land origihaiiy was purchased at a much lower 
figure. It is to be noted, however, that the tenants in the Vuicsn 
district are in a. much more favourable position when compared to the 
homond tenants*

ih# welfare of any community may be measured by the financial 
progress that has been made by the individuals who make up that cosh

settlers were discussed under section D, "Conditions Influencing the 
Progress of bettiers, 8 page 70. It is the problem oi this section to

(&) «Y.x&m,. XfiMCafc fatoa by. Plataicta - *‘ke two adjacent 

districts of Vuic&a and Lomond fall into two distinct soil and precip¬ 
itation classifications. The former district is in a superior soil 
type# namely the dark brown prairie bext and the latter in the light 
brown soil belt* This fact supported by higher precipitation in the 
Vulcan district# has resulted in higher yields and higher land values 
taan in the Lomond district* 

If the original settxers who acquired their land by nomeatend¬ 
ing are still on the land# the average yearly gain of these iadivictuals 
would be greater than for those that settled in the Lomond district# 
however# this is not the case# for a great many of the original settlers 
in the Vulcan district have sola their land during the period of rising 
land values and the present purchasers are taking the s^aox in the de¬ 
flated land values* this in pari explains why 45.9 percent of the sample 
farmers in the Vulcan district show a negative average yearly gain, 
while only 56*8 percent find themselves in a similar -itu . :ioa within 
the Lomond district* this evidence can further be explained by the fact 
that a large number of the original homesteaders have abandoned their 

holdings in the Lomond district# and no records were secured for these*

districts when in one case some adjustment has taken place because of 
abandonment while In another case the original settlers are tailing 
their gains through rent for they have sold their holdings during a 
period when the future farm income justified them in making the sales* 

On the other hand, tills throws an extra burden on those who are attempt¬ 
ing to climb tiie agricultural ladder, and when their average yearly gain 
is calculated, the deflated rand values will throw them in a grou. that 
shows a negative average yearly gain. This will become clearer as the 
analysis proceeds in later sections. 

(b) Average Xefcrxy Gain and foe boll - the honesteading policy which 
was followed in opening up the prairie regions of the west, has had a 
very marked influence on the financial progress of some settlers on 
the on© hand and loss of labour and time and money ior others. When 
the southern prairies were thrown open for settlement, all land was 
treated as if it had the same value* A nominal figure was set upon 
homesteading and preemption payments without any differentiation being 
made of the physiographic differences that existed. Under such condi¬ 
tions of settlement it is only natural that the settlers who were able 
to locate on the better lands reaped the profits from later increases 
in land values# Others on the other hand found themselves operating on 
very unproductive soli types and at great distances from markets and 
other facilities* Thus it is seen that some settlers began with dif¬ 
ferent opportunities for financial progress, lor, after paying the same 
price for their original holdings at the time of first settlement, great 











variations in land values devexopod as We xocui differences ana var¬ 
iations in resources became evident* The land values in many cases, 
were also enhanced as the highway and the railroad penetrated the area* 
Many eases have occurred in which increase in the productivity 
of land has been primarily .responsible for the differences in the fin¬ 
ancial progress of settlers* Two settlers in the Vulcan district may 
illustrate the point* air* «J*U* homesteaded a quarter section in 1905 
on the Blaokspring Silt uom, and in the same year Mr* J*H*n, homesteaded 
another quarter section just two miles away on the Fine Sand* At the 
present time, Mr* J*U« owns two arid three-quarter sections of land and 
is worth approximately $78,950, which represents an average yearly gain 
of $2,608, while Mr* J*H*L* over on the Fine *end owns onxy his original 
quarter and has a calculated net worth of minus $1,454, or an average 
gain of minus $64* They began farming operations with net worths of 
$7oU and $500 respectively. Mr. J*D* was able to save sufficient funds 
from his high producing land to buy a half section in i9U9, another half 
in 1914 and the remainder of his farm at odd periods up to the present* 





He a&s bxso able to accumulate outeids investments to tile extent ox 
C*S6. U00, including some cash still in the bank* On the other hand at 

no time did the operator on the Fine cand save sufficient to -dd more land* 
The differences in the managerial ability of the two operators is not 

the only factor making for ine tremendous difference* It is chiefly 

the result of continued productivity of the Bilt Loam and tne very spor¬ 
adic production of the line band* In other words, it may have been a

and Lomond districts have been arranged In decreasing order in terms of 
average yearly gains.

It is interesting to not© that the Blackspring Silt Loam ranks 


first and Vulcan Loam last from the point of view of average yearly gain. 
The former holds its position because of its superior productive power, 
while the Vulcan Loam occupies fee lowest rank because fee land on this 
type was purchased at a very high price# Decline in lend values no 
doubt contributes a great deal towards a negative average yearly gain. 
This of course was amplified by the fact that the farmers on this soil 

have experienced hailstorms over fee years, which tended to decrease 
the farm revenues# The low position of fee Carmang&y Fine Sand on the 




























other hand is due to its low productive power* 

for the Lomond district the Sundial BiltCxay Loam ranks first 
and Lomond Fine Sandy Loam ranks last from the point of view of average 
yearly gain. The Sundial Silt Clay Loam is comparable to uhe Blackspring 
Silt -uoaia of the Vulcan district. 

The fact that more soil types show a negative average yearly 
gain for the Vulcan district does not necessarily prove that the district 
is inferior to the Lomond district. This is a reflection oi great change 
in land values, and the large amount of debt carried. Different results 
are produced when land is purchased at $75 an acre than when it is pur¬ 
chased at #10 an acre. 

However, taking the district as a whole, Vulcan reports & 
lower average yearly gain, i.e., #51 as compared to #65 for Lomond. A 
great number of original settlers have moved out and abandoned their 
farms. Mo sample for these was obtained. This, along with the great 
reduction la land values of rate years, no doubt helps to explain why 
a larger average yearly gain is reported for this district. 

it has been shown in tills section that soix is an important 
factor, but years on the farm is also of consequence.

operation** are carried over a long period of years the average yearly 
gain may become positive. This is partly due to the evening out of the 
prices received for agricultural products. 

The figures in the following table Indicate that farm opeiv 
a tors who have farmed on the present farm 14 years or less have negative 
average yearly gains. This can partly be explained in terms of prices 
received lor wheat, farm operators who have farmed x4 years or less 
received (0*74 or less a bushel on the average lor their wheat* bn 
the other hand, operators who have farmed xS years or more show positive 
average yearly gains for both districts* the amount of their gains in¬ 
creasing with the length of time of farming on their present farms, 
these farmers have received on the average higher prices for theii Inest. 
This would tend to support the contention that the risks in farming are 
reduced when t&kmn on a long time average, for not only price fluctuations 
but climatic and other physical factors are evened out. Again a study 
of individual cases would reveal some apparent contradictions to the 
general rule, but taking the district as a whole, it might be concluded 
that larger average yearly gains are coincident with the longer time 
in farming operations.

ihe figures 

in i 

the table 

indicate 

that 45 

psrcent 

of farm 


operators in th© Vulcan district had negative changes in net worth. 


wliii© only S3 percent had negative changes in net worth in the Lomond 
district, the greater number of farmers in the ViLtcan district, who 
have experienced a negative change in net worth is due to & great ex¬ 
tent to change in land values, which is true for the Lomond district 
to a lesser degree. On the other hand, a greater ^ro^ortiou (13 per- 




























c©nt> had a change in net worth of $iu f OOO and over in Vu-lc an as coat- 
pared to 9 percent for the Lomond district* 

A return of high prices for farm products would show a greater 
change in net worth from the negative to the positive j.u the Vuic-n 
district than in the Lomond, for land would again be valued vary high 
and sold at a much higher price, and this, coupled with consistently 
higher yields of the former district, would tend to place the valuation 
of farm property at a high price, ho doubt during the recent depression 
the Vuxean district has suffered a great deal more from deflated land 
values as the figures in the table indicate* 

(W liatio. of. feorth at Start to Present bet Worth by ^oii ?\ oes - 
The productive power of the soil is one of the deterging factors which 
in the long run influence the net worth of farm operators* The figures 
in the following table indicate to wn&t extent the soix has played a 
part In differentiating between the financial progress of farmers on 
the various soix types. This of course is not a long ran adjustment 
where farmers on all types of soil classes would have the same net worth* 
There is always a tendency toward an equilibrium as between different 
soil types* Therefore the following is an examination of facts when con¬ 
ditions are not in equilibrium.

The Biackspring Silt Losa in bheVnlcan district shows the great¬ 


est gain over the years. The ratio of net worth at start to present 
net worth is Is12.69, wiiich is due partly to unearned increment and in 


part to the greater productivity of the soil. Vulcm Loam shows a 
heavy loss, the ratio of net worth at st^rt to present net worth being 
lsu.56* The great loss is due to a large uoss in land values# Land on 
tnis soil type was sold at a higher price than on any other soil type, 
because of anticipated future farm income* which aid not materialize* 

























The low ratio of the C&rm&ngay f'ine u and on the other hand is partly 
due to ehange in land values, but also to a great degree because of 
the low productivity of the soil# 

in the i»omond district the bundle! Silt Clay Loam has the best 
showing, the ratio of net worth at start to present net worth being 1*4.17 
The relatively high rank position of the Lomond Fine band is due to the 
large net earnings of farmers during some of the past years, iaraers 
on this soil report that the yieid in 1915 and 1916 was as high as 56 
bushels to the acre. Since this type of soil is easily cultivated, the 
costs of operation are very low end very high net earnings are obtained 
in years of favourable yields* Two or three good years enabled some of 
the farmere to show an increase in their net worth* 

4gain one operator also reported a legacy of $£S|OGG| This, 

coupled with, the small sample helps to explain why such a high increase 

- 

in net forth is shown for tills soil type* Also the operators on tills 
soil type operate fairly large farms and raise a lot of livestock, in 
other words, they have adjusted their farming operations to the type 
of farming suitable to that particular soil. 

The homoncl district as a whole has shown a more favourable 
increase in net worth when measured in terms of ratios. The ratio of 
net worth at start to present net worth is ls<c*k6, while th*t of Vuicun 
district is isl*44. This can be explained by the -act that bomond farmers 

on toe average had a lower net worth to begin with, and when compared

to present net worth show a more favourable position, when measured in

$he indication of long time adjustment is evident when the net

gain in net worth is examined for the average farmer in both districts* 


The average Vulcan farmer has gained ^2,251 in net worth over his net 
worth at start* The Lomond average farmer has gained $2,231 on the aver¬ 
age* The two figures for practical purposes are identical - the question 
that can now be asked is to what extent is this an indication of trie 
long run adjustment, i*e«, all farmers will have made the same gain? 

(cj Ratio of i)iet Worth at Start to Present Het Worth in Relation to 
Imm m.JLiiLsu±^m ---———----- 


the data obtained in the survey indicate that for bota the 
Vulcan end Lomond districts, the farm operators who have been on their 
farms the longest have made on the average the greatest gains. In other 
words, the risk of wide fluctuations in price and yiexds are reduced 
when taken on a long time average*

farm hair a shown a decrease in their net worth for both districts. On 


the other hand* those that have been 15'years or over on this farm in¬ 
creased their net worth as indicated by figures in the above table* 
the average farmer in the Vulcan district who has spent 50 years or more 
on ills farm ha© increased his net worth 8*19 times. In We ^oaond 
district the average farmer who has spent 25 years or more on his farm

The figures in tills table indicate that nx percent of the 


operators in the Vulcan district have negative present net worth as com¬ 
pared with 20 percent in the lomond district* On the other hand, x5 per¬ 
cent of the operators in she former district have net. worths over €20,0o0 # 
while only 8 percent of the operators of the latter district are in the 
same class* The wide fluctuation in the net worth of farm operators in 
the Vulcan district can be attributed largely to the change in xind 
values* 

It was noted that no farmers with negative net worth are 
reported for the Blacfcgpring Sift loam, while 17, or 44 percent of the 




























to tax mmber interviewed on the Caraanguy Fine band report negative net 

| 

worths, The high percentage (17 percent^ of farm operators with negative 
net worth on the Vuxcnn Loam is due mainly to groat changes in land values* 
In the Lomond district, 50 percent of the operators on the 
Armada Clay Loam report negative net worth. Only one operator had a 
negative net worth on the Sundial Silt Clay Loam, 

» K 

It is evident from these figures that the more productive 
soils were more remunerative over the years than the lees pi*ociuctive, as 

t 

shown by the net worth figures# Exceptions are noted which are not due 
to tha productivity of soil, but due to high purchase price of land, 

(«) Standard oi living 

An attempt hag been made to indicate the standard of liv¬ 
ing of the farm operators and their families within these two districts 
by a brief discussion of cash and non-casn living expenditures as well 
as the discussions on farm facilities which presumably have been pro- 

■ • ? '. ■ . v » 

vided by savings out of the past farm incomes. 

Cash ana hon-Oush Living Expendifares - In the more mature district 
of Vulcan the average sample farmer spent $708 as a cash living expense 
and $195 as a non-cash expenditure, making a total of $1,001, on the aver* 

if; 

age, in the Lomond district, which in many respects still resembles a 
pioneering area, the average sample farmer spent $518 as a cash expendit¬ 
ure arid $111 as a non-cash expenditure or making a total outlay of $758 
per farm operator# The average size of the family is not significantly dil 
f©rent for the two districts. The average composition o_ tx.e Vuxcsju house-

hold was 5.6 adult unite as compared talth 5.5 adiut units lor the aver-, 
age Lomond household* The average cash and non-cash expenditure er 
adult unit in the Vulcan district was $*73 as comparer with $*li in the 
Lomond district. This is indicative that the average iaraer has at¬ 
tained a higher standard of living in the former district* 

However, when the expenditures for trie far* operators are 

examined on different soil types significant differences are to be found* 

0 

It is noted that the average expenditure per aduut unit for the operators 
on the Sundial ^ift ^lay ^oam in the Lomond district is $*95 which is 
only surpassed by expenditures by operators on the Vulcan ^oam and Vulcan 
fine b^ndy hoam in the Vulcan distract (see Table 76 )« on the o trier hand, 
the lowest per adult unit expenditures are found to be on the Ct raangay 
Fine s&nd in the Vulcan district, and on the Lomond Fine band ii- the 
Lomond district* 

That there are differences in total family expenditures is 
significant for it supports the argument that the more fortunate oper¬ 
ators who located on the more productive soius have not only been able 
to make a greater gain in their net worth, but they have also been able 
to attain a higher standard of living as wei^ when measured b;. the amounts 
that are spent for living expenditures*

'Ihia seems to indicate that the average farmer in the 


Vulcan district has been in a better position to provide himself with 
fata facilities which make life easier* It is also an indication of 
past prosperity as between the Vulcan did the Lomond districts* 

The farmers on the better soil types have *u.so been abxe to 
provide themselves with more facilities than those on the inferior 
soil types* this is c^eany indicated by ilgures in fables illl(a) 
and XIXI(b^ in the Appendix* The indications are that the proportion of 
settlers with farm facilities are higher on the Vulcan Lilt loam than 
for those on the Carmangay Fine band in the Vulcan district* in the 

Lomond district the proportion of settlers on the Lunuiai Liu-t Cx&y 
noam with farm facilities is greater than on any oi the other soil types 

within the district* and when the comparison is made with the settler 

on the Lomond Fine Sand* the contrast is quite marked* 

This would tend to support the argument that other things 






















- klb - 


being equal the farmers on the better soil types not only have been able 
to make a marked financial progress, but they also have been able to 
attain a higher standard of living* This is clearly inaio&ted for the 
Vulcan district which is in the dark brown soil as compared with the 
Lomond district which lies on the fringe of the light brown soil*

Prior to homestead settlement the area was used for 
ranching purposes* it was assumed that this condition represented 
a complete adjustment to the conditions prevailing at that time* It 
was noted that the opening of this area for settl©merit and the chang¬ 
ing of its land use from an extensive one to an intensive one may 
have occurred as a result of a number of conditions, viz*, 

a) A change in the demand for agricultural products. 

(2) A change in the cost of transportation. 

(8) A desire for land settlement.

(5) a change in the state of the arts in In a proauction

It was then noted that once the equilibrium between the 
two economies had been disturbed, bids for expansion followed* the 

expansion of the area for farming purposes was accomplished by home¬ 
steading, preemption and purchasing, Him interviews with the original 

settlers as weal as consultations elsewhere indicated that no attempt 
was mads to adjust the method of settlement or to interest die settler

The conditions which make for the financial progress of

Btahlstic&l material providing evidence oi the financial 
status and progress oi‘ setti-ers found unaer varying physical con¬ 
ditions was examined* l'he data obtained in the survey indicate that 
the settlers who homesteaded or purchased land with some knowledge 
of j.oc&i differences and resoux*ces have progressed more favourably 
than those who settled under adverse conditions* 

it was noted for example that for tne Lomond distxdct the 
Sundial **ilt Loam ranked first and Lomond line bandy Loam ranked xast 
from the point oi view of average yearly gain for the average sample 
settlers* For Vulcan district the Blackspring Silt Loam ranked first 
fro© the point of view of average yearly gain of settlers. 

Again the settlers on the llackspring hiit l»oa m snowed 
greater gains than those on any of the other soil types within the 
Yulcan—uomand area* ihe ratio of net worth at start to present net 
worth of tiie settlers on the Blackspring Silt ^oaa was 1 ji^* 69* In 
the Lomond district the settlers on the bundi&i but Llay Loam showed 

'the best gains? the ratio of net worth at start to present net worth 

being 1*4*17# 

On the wnole the data indicated that settlers on the bet¬ 
ter sola types were indebted to a less extent then settlers on the 
poorer soil types# in addition the former had resorted to a lesser 

extent to the government lor relief and were tax delinquent to a 
smaller extent# It was also indicated that the operators on the bet¬

district.* ~he greater number oj. farmers w*io experienced a negative 
change in net. worth in the ^ulcan district appears to have been due 
siore to changes in land values than to the productivity ox the soil, 
ihe came was round to be true wneii settieis on the individual soil 
classes were examined* It w&s noted that in theVuiean district Vulcan 
loam ranksiast from the point of view oi average yearly gain, mainly 
because the land on this so*i 1 type was purcha sed at a very high price* 
ihe decline in land values no doubt contributed a gwt de Jl toward a 
negative average yearly gain of settlers on this soil type. 

With respect to the conditions of capital at start and 
expansion of holdings with and without adequate capital, it may be 
observed that the statistical data for groups could not be obtained 
to indicate how far these conditions influenced the financial progress 
of settlers* It was noted however that, the Vulcan settlers brought 
more cash with them than the homond operators, ^ost of the settlers 
of the ^ulcan district owned and farmed in the Halted ktaoee before 
coming to settle and buy land in the V\ucan district, and consequently 
had built up quite an equity in livestock, machinery, feed ana seed 
as well as ready cash* By examining individual records, cot groups, 

it was found that adequacy of capital at start was an important factor 
in affecting financial progress* It was .found auso by ex^mi^ing indv- 
iciu&i records that those who expanded the size o:. tnsir holdings under 

favourable conditions made a more favourable financial progress than 
those who made purchases under adverse conditions and with inadequate

*'he method of explaining the individual records also vas 
resorted to in order to find out if "other conditional made any dif¬ 
ference in the financial progress of s©tilers* Ihe c itu examined 
indicated that these conditions explain in pert the difference in 
financial progress of two settlers farming under quite similar if 
not identical conditions* 


With respect to the "state of the arts" e? a condition 
affooting the financial progress of settlers .tfc may be restated that 
it is impossible to measure statistically, what part has been played 
by the changes in production methods in the finanoiil progress of 
settlers* 

Tentative Conclusions can only be based on observations 
which war© possible during the survey period and consultations with 
the farmers themselves* These observations and consultations sug¬ 
gest that the changes in methods of production have had a marked 
influence on the financial progress of settlers within this area* 

In conclusion it may be stated from the point of view of 
the area in relation bo other competing areas, or as a matter of 

fact the rest of the world, fchnt there are at present marked evidences 
of maladjustment or disequilibrium**- borne adjustments are new taking 
place in the form of abandonment of farm land, extension of relief 


to farmers in the area, and a tendency go reorgauization of farming 
practices* Ana tads is indicative that the area is in the process

APPENDIX IX 



Soil® of the Vuican-^uoffiond Area 












XXVII 


mmsuL jul 

the following summary of classes of soils is taken from 
t.ae M boii Survey of Macieod Sheet* * 1 by N#A, Wyatt and J.D. Newton, 
September I9*i5 - pp#&5 to 46# 

(lj Fine Sand 

"The surface and subsoil are about the same texture as the 
surface soil, and vary from a few x©et to upwards of thirty feet in 
depth, especially in the dune areas’ 1 * 

**Xhe organic matter varies in depth from a lew inches to 
about eight inches”# 

•These sends are incoherent in nature, and blow readily once 
tiie grass covering is disturbed# They are weu.1 drained and absorb 
water readily. Extensive water rapidly percolates until it encounters 
impervious layers* w 

*Xhey are very fertile sends...The nitrogen content 

is only about one-half as great as for the heavier soixe# constant 

heavy crops would soon depress the yields.” 

®These areas in general prove to be the least profitable of 
any of the soil types when restricted to a straight grain growing 
system.” 

( 4 \ ; "U& . 2m 

11 They might be properxy classed as very line sandy -cams 












XaVIII 


since they contain about equax amounts ox fine and very line sand, or 
an average to tux of 70 percent of these two separates* In some instan¬ 
ces the eub-^uTface and subsoil are lighter in texture than the sur¬ 
face, but generally they become heavxor with the increase in depth* 

The depth of covering over the impervious horizon varies from about 
two feet to upwards of twenty feet* There is considerable variation 
in the subsoil of the fine sandy loam areas, in some areas there is 
considerable gravel and stone, whereas other areas are rex^tivexy 
free from these coarser materials* B 

“The organic matter extends from a lew inches to about one 
foot in depth, the high places being lower in this constituent* 11 

i 

11 The fine sandy loans absorb water readily and retain it bet¬ 
ter than the fine sands, but not as well as the finer soils* ex¬ 
tensive water readily percolates to the impervious layer ox subsoil** 

"They are more fertile than fine sands, but less fertile than 
the heavier soils. 11 in general, they are lower in nitrogen, calcium, 
potassium, magnesium, and limestone, with in no case acidity present* 
The phosphorous content is a bit lower than for any of the other 
soiis. The fine sandy loams are loose and open and drift easily..... 51 

(5> loam 

# This type includes poorly defined patches o: fine sandy 
loam, silt loam, very fine sandy loam and gravelly or atony outcrops, 
but on the whole the surface is fairly uniform throughout the greater 
part of the area* 1 *

"The organic matter extends from about five inches to about 
twelve inches deep, with aa average of about sevun inches." 

"In certain pttwhes the subsoil is very irregular, ranging 
from sand to stony, gravelly and clay pockets." 

"The xoams are more fertile than the lighter types, in fact, 
they together with the silt loams and clay loams, constitute the 
best soils of the sheet." 

"The loam contains, roughtly, twice as much nitrogen, calcium 
magnesium, three times as much limestone and & bit more phosphorous 
and potassium than do the fine sands, also about one-half more oi the 
plant foods than the fine sandy loans." 

"The loams work easily, absorb and retain moisture readily 
and experience Very little blowing. They suffer less from blowing 
than either the lighter or the heavier soils, but in certain parts 
even these soils have blown, especially along the borders adjoining 
the fine sandy loams, fine sands, silt loams and clay loams." 

(4/ Silt loam 

"The average areas within the silt ^oam type belong to the 
heavier phase of this type. They contain & bit more clay then the 
average silt xoam, and likewise a bit more very fine sand, yet they 
cannot be classed as slay loams, however, this type does contain con¬ 
siderable areas of typical silt xoam, smalu. irregular patches of xoam 

and clay loam, and appreciable areas of very line sanely loam*" 

"The organic matter extends from about five to twelve inches 







YXTL 

# 

deep, with an average of six to sight indies* M 

“The subsoils ere usually heavier than the surface soils* 
They are fairly uniiorw in texture with high proportions of silt, and 
are typical silty roams to silty clay loams* In only a few instances 
are the subsurface and subsoils lighter in texture than the surface 
soils ** 4 

“This type of soil is fairly coherent, yet works easily. 

The soils absorb water readily and retain it well* They are compar¬ 
atively fertile, and are adapted to a wide range of crape.*’ 

(5; Clay no am 

“A considerable part of the material oj. these areas has been 
settled from waters ox the past giucioa lake. This is the condition 
of the areas between the Blackspring Mdge and Sundial nutte, in town¬ 
ship 15, range Si, west ox Betiaw in township 15, ranges x 8 and 19, 
and again adjacent to Long Coulee from Champion to the kittle Bow 
Elver# These areas are relatively free from boulders excepting along 
the drainage ways,” 

"The surface soil is fairly uniform throughout the above 
mentioned areas. The subsoil is usually heavier than tne surface and 

varies from silty exay loam to heavy clay,** 

"The area around Champion is light, in fact it is a right 
silt clay loam. The following areas* township 12 , range 21 and again 
in township 15, range 18 and 19, belong to the light phase of this 

type," 

"The clay io&a around Lomond and Travers, however, is quite

different from the above mentioned areas in that it has been subjected 
to a smaller amount of reworKiag by water since tne glacial ice move¬ 
ments. It is characteristic glacial bouxaer clay and contaixiS certain 
areas intermittently strewn with boulders, again, sprinklings of 
gravel are encountered, o n the whole, it is iess uniiorm both to top¬ 
ography and type than the other clay loam areas. fte low places are 
generally very heavy, and trie surface soil is not as deep." 

*$he organic matter extends from four to fourteen inches 
down, with an average of about eight inches for the western areas and 
about six inches for the eastern areas.” 

•These clay loams are coherent a. retain water well, but in 
certain districts the soxx is sufficiently heavy to cause difficulty 
in scouring with a mold-board plow, especially if worked wnen too 
wet* however** a large percent of these areas work fairly easily even 
with a mold-board plow. *hey ell weather wex^, end produce an ex¬ 
cellent seed bed if tilled at the proper time.” 

•The fertility of the clay loam is relatively high...... 

fha -Silt loam (light phased areas are the only ones containing more 
nitrogen* 

(6) Eroded Areas 

”Occur chiefly along or adjacent to the rivers and drainage 
ways, and comprise the land which is difficult or impossible to till* 

These areas may consist of the clay subsoil from which most or axx of 
the surface has been eroded, or the boulder heaps left by the early
