SYNOPSIS 


A number of organizations had indicated a need 
for a comprehensive Canada-v/ide survey of the financial 
assistance currently available to students doing 
graduate work in the field of education at the Canadian 
universities. One of the purposes of this study was to 
provide this information for each of the universities 
that sent representatives to the First Canadian Confer¬ 
ence of Deans and Professors of Education at Toronto 
in 1955, and that replied to the CEA questionnaire in 
1955 respecting course offerings in educational admin¬ 
istration and supervision. 

A second purpose was to provide similar 
information that was more directly applicable to the 
Faculty of Education and to the School of Graduate 
Studies at the University of Alberta. The increasing 
demand for university accommodation, the growing short¬ 
age of trained personnel, and the expressed need for 
well-rounded schools of graduate studies in Canada, 
offer both a challenge and an opportunity for Alberta 
to develop its School of Graduate Studies. To do this 
requires a reasonable proportion of graduate students 
who are prepared to engage in full time studies at the 
University, In order to attract into a full time 
graduate program the type of student it needs, and to 
ensure that such students will be able to com.plete 
programs once they have been started, the University 
must have adequate financial resources at its disposal. 


X 



The data for the study were gathered by means 
of a canvass of the university calendars, of charitable 
foundations and fellowship committees, of teachers’ and 
trustees’ organizations, of service clubs, of Depart¬ 
ments of Education, and of selected businesses. The 
survey was supplemented by questionnaires to Deans of 
Education, and to school boards in cities having pop¬ 
ulations of 15,000 or over, and by personal and tele¬ 
phone interviews. Information was assembled covering 
scholarships, fellowships, bursaries, loans, leaves of 
absence, studentships, demonstratorships, and similar 
forms of aid. 

The resulting data were com.piled into a factual 
report of the currently available financial aid for 
graduates in education at Canadian universities. The 
report was submitted to the Second Canadian Conference 
of Deans and Professors of Education at Montreal in 
June, 1956 , for use at the Conference. 

The data relating niore specifically to the 
situation at the University of Alberta, together with 
the interpretations of and implications arising from 
these data are expected to yield information that will 
assist the Faculty of Education to: 

(1) enable its graduate students to make fuller use 
of the available financial aid; 

(2) encourage more graduates to do postgraduate work; 

(3) enlarge the amount of aid available for graduate 
wo rk; and 

(A) assist in a program of expansion in the field of 
graduate studies at this University.

CHAPTER I 


THE PROBLEM 


A number of organizations had indicated a need 
for a comprehensive Canada-wide survey of the financial 
assistance currently available to Canadian students 
doing graduate and postgraduate work in the field of 
education at the Canadian universities. The report of 
the First Canadian Conference of Deans of Education and 
Professors of Educational Administration and Supervision, 
held in Toronto in June, 1955, indicated a need for:^ 

1® A comprehensive study of programs and offerings in 
education at Canadian degree-granting institutions, 
with special reference to administration and super¬ 
vision. 

2. The development at one or more Canadian universities 
of a centre for advanced graduate studies specific¬ 
ally in the field of educational administration and 
supervision. 

3. Greater financial aid for graduate students in 
educational administration and supervision® 


Plans had been formulated to satisfy each of the 
three needs expressed by the First Canadian Conference. A 
study of the programs and offerings in education at

vision at Montreal in 1956, in two sections* One, 
covering the English-speaking universities, was prepared 
at the Ontario College of Education; the other, cover¬ 
ing the French-speaking universities, was prepared at 
Laval University.^ 

Steps to meet the need for the development of 
a centre for advanced graduate studies, specifically in 
the field of educational administration and supervision, 
were taken by the formation at the University of Alberta, 
in 1956 , of a new division of educational administration 
and supervision in the Faculty of Education.^ The Faculty

ance in the form of a grant of $127,540 was announced by 
the W* K* Kellogg Foundation to assist the University of 
Alberta in expanding its graduate program in educational 
administration and supervision.^ 

Before steps could be taken to meet the need 
for greater financial aid for graduate students in 
education, information was required showing the kinds 
and amounts of aid that were currently available« Some 
of this information was contained in the calendars of 
the Canadian universities, but the listings were not 
complete. Nor was there available any single list of 
all the assistance for which graduate students in 
education at any Canadian university could apply^ This 
study was initiated in an attempt to gather together 
into one compilation information respecting every form 
of financial aid available for graduate students in the 
field of education at any Canadian university.

I. THE. PROBLEM 

Statement of the problem. This study had three 
purposes. One purpose was to provide factual information 
for the use of each of the Canadian universities that had 
sent representatives to the First Canadian Conference of 
Deans of Education and Professors of Educational Admin¬ 
istration and Supervision in 1955? and that had replied 
to the CEA-Kellogg questionnaire respecting course offer- 

n 

ings in educational administration and supervision.' As 
a preparatory step towards obtaining greater financial 
aid for graduate students in education it became necess¬ 
ary to survey the present situation with respect to aid 
already available at the Canadian universities. There 
was need for a single compilation of the kinds and 
amounts of available aid in the forms of scholarshipsj 
fellowships, bursaries, loans, assistantships, special 
grants, and paid leaves of absence. 

A second purpose of the study was to provide 
factual information more directly applicable to the 

7r. s. MacArthur, "Current Offerings in Educa¬ 
tional Administration and Supervision in Canadian Univer¬ 
sities," 1955 Conference of Canadian Deans of Education 
and Professors of Educational Administration and Super ¬ 

vision (Toronto: Canadian Education Association, 1955*

University of Alberta, its School of Graduate Studies, 
and especially to the Faculty of Education* The increas¬ 
ing demand for university accommodation, the growing 
shortage of trained personnel, and the expressed need for 
well-rounded schools of graduate studies in Canada, offer 
both a challenge and an opportunity for Alberta to develop 
its present School of Graduate Studies. To do so requires 
a reasonable proportion of graduate students who are pre¬ 
pared to engage in full-time study at the university. In 
order to attract into a full-^time graduate program the 
type of student it needs, and to ensure that such students 
will be able to complete programs once they have been 
started, the university must have adequate financial 
resources at its disposal. The Alberta system of student 
assistance was defective in several aspects. 

The final purpose of the study was to examine 
briefly the adequacy of the financial aid currently 
available to students doing graduate work in education, 
with special reference to the situation existing at the 
University of Alberta.

The purposes of this study might be more 
clearly expressed by means of the following questions: 
lo Are all forms of financial assistance available 

to students for graduate work in education known 
to the universities? 

2o If not, can methods be evolved to ensure that 

information is gathered relative to such forms 
of assistance? 

3o Do university calendars list every available form 
of assistance? 

4* Are all available forms of assistance known to the 
students who might benefit from them? 

5. How much financial aid is currently offered for 
graduate work in education? 

6* Is the amount of available aid adequate to the 
needs of education? 

7® Are any kinds of aid not presently being utilized? 
Is the amount of aid available for graduate and 
post-graduate work in education adequate to 

(a) attract worthy students into the Graduate 

Schools? 

(b) ensure that worthy students who have finan¬ 

cial difficulties will be able to complete 
their programs? 

(c) encourage research studies in the field of 

educat ion? 




7 

Importance of the study ^ It was expected that 
this study would be used in two ways. The factual re¬ 
port of the financial aid available for graduate work 
in education at the Canadian universities was prepared 

for use at the Second Canadian Conference of Deans and 

9 

Professors of Education in Montreal in June, 1956a 
Appendix C contains the report submitted to the con¬ 
ference* 

The second use for the study was to provide 
basic information that would assist the Faculty of 
Education of the University of Alberta to 

(1) enable its graduate students to make fuller use of 

the available financial aid; 

(2) encourage more graduates to do postgraduate work; 

(3) enlarge the amount of financial aid available for 

graduate work in education; and 

(4) assist in a program of general expansion in the 

field of graduate studies in education at this 
University*

II. DEFINITION OF TEMS USED 


Fellowship ^. A fellowship is a grant made for 
postgraduate study or research, and based upon ability 

Scholarship » A scholarship is a grant made to 
under-graduates or graduates, and based upon academic 
standing. Financial need usually has no bearing on the 
awarding of a scholarship, but it may influence the 
amount of money awarded. 

Bursary . A bursary is a grant made to a needy 
student who has a reasonably good academic standing. 

The size of the bursary usually varies with the estab¬ 
lished need of the student. Bursaries frequently 
entail duties to be performed for the university. 

Loan . Loans are usually made to needy students 
from limited funds. Preferences are ordinarily given to 
senior students for the com_pletion of degree programs. 

A satisfactory academic standing is a requisite. Terms 
of repayment vary. 

Leave of absence . A leave of absence is 
defined here as leave from the usual employment that

might be used for graduate educational study, and for 
which the employer gives a portion of the salary or some 
other payment. Short term leave up to six weeks would 
probably permit the employee to attend summer school 
courses. Long term leave usually permits normal intra¬ 
mural study. 

Assistantship . An assistantship is payment for 
services rendered in some university department* 

Research assistantships are ordinarily granted for work 
on research projects being conducted by members of a 
department 

IIIo LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY 

Fields of study. At a number of Canadian 
universities, teachers or others about to become 
teachers, usually hold a B. A« degree or its equival¬ 
ent before proceeding to the B. Ed. degree or to 
graduate work in education. Such persons might con¬ 
ceivably study in a wide variety of fields* In order 
to limit the fields of study in those areas not 
specifically designated as for education, awards have

been included only in those special fields that are 

usually taught in the senior high schools* These 

include languages such as English, French, German, 

and Latin; and humanities such as Art, History, 

12 

Music, Literature, Philosophy, and Psychology® 

In defining the fields of study that might be 
considered as open to students in education, most 
foreign languages, Glassies, Social Work, Business 
courses, most of the Social Sciences, and most of the 
Natural Sciences have been excluded. It was felt that 
subjects of a specialized or technical nature require 
specialized training, and that students in them seldom 
enter the teaching field® 

Financial limits . As it is felt that financ¬ 
ial aids have to be fairly substantial in order to 
attract students into full-time graduate schools, 
awards of less than $100 have been omitted. 

Bachelor of Education degree® In a number of 
Canadian universities the B. Ed. is considered to be a 
graduate degree. At all universities where the B. Ed. 
is awarded, students may enroll for it after obtaining

a degree such as the B. A. In order to obtain uniform¬ 
ity in this report, where a prior degree is listed as 
a requisite, students taking courses leading to a B. Ed* 
have been classified as doing graduate work. This 
classification is chosen in spite of the fact that in 
most universities a ^^graduate^^ student must be regist¬ 
ered in the Graduate School or Faculty* 

IV, ORGANIZATION OF THE THESIS 

A number of problems arose during this study 
that demanded special solutions. One of them occurred 
during the collection of the data* Although there 
were extant several compilations of financial aid to 
university students, none of the publications contained 
all of the assistance available at the Canadian degree¬ 
granting institutions, and none of them contained a 
list of the aid available in the field of graduate 
studies in education. The methods evolved for the 
collection of the data are discussed in Chapter II* 

One of the purposes of this study, as 
previously stated, was to prepare factual material for 
use at the Second Canadian Conference of Deans of 
Education and Professors of Educational Administration 
and Supervision at Montreal* The report which was 
given to the conference is contained in Appendix C« 







12 


In order to avoid repetition, the actual awards avail¬ 
able to graduate students as contained in the report in 
the appendix, are not listed in the body of the thesis* 
Chapter III contains an analysis of the awards* 

Chapter IV makes certain interpretations from 
the analysis of the awards. Implications and trends 
arising from the analysis are also discussed. Finally, 
the implications of the study, as they appear to affect 
the Faculty of Education of the University of Alberta, 
are dealt with* 


V. THE PROBLEM IN PERSPECTIVE 

It was stated on page 1 that a number of 

organizations had indicated a need for a Canada-wide 

survey of the financial assistance available to 

graduate students in education* That this problem 

had been before the Canadian universities for several 

years is indicated in a report of a survey made for 

the Canadian Social Science Research Council in 1945* 

Commenting on the general need for more university 

13 

graduates in Canada the report said: 


13 

John Bartlet Brebner, Scholarship for 
Canada (Ottawa: Canadian Social Science Research 
Council, 1945), p« 19» 









13 


Canada needs to detect, train, encourage, and 
retain every scholar she can find, for they will 
constitute the principal group who will keep 
Canada up with a rapidly changing world, who will 
bring Canadian brains and experience to bear on 
Canadian problems, and who will pass on to youth 
and to the nation at large the vital tradition 
from the past* 


The report went on to advocate the establish¬ 
ment of several Canadian centers where scholarships at 
the master’s and occasionally at the doctoral level 

might be profitably cultivated in especially favorable 
14 

ground* In touching upon the need for adequate 
financial aid to university students, the report 
continued 

It is imperative, of course, that, on the 
one hand, no outstanding student should be kept 
out of the full collegiate experience for want 
of means, and, on the other, that mediocre 
students who happen to possess the means should 
not be allowed to clutter up the colleges and 
diminish the usefulness of apparatus and brains 
and energy which Canada cannot afford to waste* 


In a preliminary search for sources of financ¬ 
ial aid, full use was made of The Education Index ^

Bibliography of Materials Related to References on 

Loansy Fellowships^ Scholarships, and the Exchange of

to be gathered from the universities themselves and 
from other primary sources. Magazine and newspaper 
articles bore out this contention, and at the same 
time proved to be sources of information relative to 
financial donors. 

A further complication arose from the fact 

that education was listed as a separate field of study 

in some publications, but was not in others. The 

UNESCO publication Study Abroad divided the 15>737 

scholarships listed as being offered in 1954 into ten 

21 

categories, of which education was one. Table I, on 
page 16, shows the fields of study in which the 
scholarships were offered, together with the percent- 
age of scholarships offered in each field* 

Education was combined with the Social Sciences 

and the Humanities by the Rockefeller Foundation in its 
22 

Directory. The awards made by this Foundation in 
Canada from 1917 to 1950 inclusive were listed in five 
fields of study. These fields of study, and the numbers 
of awards in each field are shown in Table II on page 16«

The Education Committee of the Canadian Chamber 

of Commerce in reporting the results of a survey of 

corporate giving to the Canadian universities did not 

23 

list education as a separate course of study* The 
givings of the llS companies included in Canada’s chief 
financial donors were distributed by university courses 
as shown in Table III, on page 18. The percentages 
shown include scholarships, bursaries, research grants, 
endowments, and grants to departments* They exclude 
building fund grants and grants to general administra¬ 
tion. 


In summary, it appeared that financi^ aid in 
education came from foundations, professional and frat^ 
ernal organizations, endowments and bequests, service 
clubs, governments, and business and industry. But, 
regardless of the source, there seemed to be no compre¬ 
hensive compilation of donors that would serve the 
purposes of the Conference of Deans of Education or that 
could be used by a university in assessing its own 
program of assistance to students. Further, although

education is a vast business, it does not appear to be 
one of the favored university faculties with respect 
to the receipt of financial aid for its students. Nor 
is it generally considered to have problems closely 
allied to the interests of Canada’s chief financial 
donors. 









CHAPTER II 


COLLECTION OF THE DATA 


The cialendars of the Canadian universities were 
the starting point for the collection of the data 
respecting financial aid to graduate students in the 
field of education. There were, however, obvious gaps 
in the information contained in the calendars* Tech¬ 
niques had to be evolved for filling in these gaps. 

The questions of suitable data-gathering techniques, 
of sampling procedures, and of the validation of the 
data obtained all posed problems for which special 
solutions had to be found. 

I. SURVEY OF THE UNIVERSITY CALENDARS 

The following Canadian universities sent 
representatives to the First Canadian Conference of 
Deans of Education and Professors of Educational 
Administration and Supervision, and replied to the 
CEA-Kellogg questionnaire respecting course offerings 
in educational administration and supervision in 1955 • 
University of British Columbia, University of Alberta, 
University of Saskatchewan, University of Manitoba, 
University of Toronto, University of Montreal, McGill 
University, Laval University, Bishop’s University,

University of New Brunswick, St. Joseph University, 
University of Ottawa, Mount Allison University, Saint 
Francis Xavier University, Dalhousie University, 

Acadia University, Prince of Wales College, and 
Memorial University of Newfoundland# The calendars 
of these universities provided the initial data for 
the report and for the thesis. Other universities 
were not included, as it was found that only the 
institutions of higher education that were listed 
granted degrees in education#^ 

At the outset it was found that there was 
no uniformity amongst the Canadian universities with 
respect to their calendar descriptions of financial 
assistance# The lack of uniformity was evident in the 
terms used to describe the awards, in the requirements 
a student must meet to be considered for one, in the 
amounts of the awards, in the terms under which they 
mi^t be given, in the time for or methods of applica¬ 
tion, and in the formats used in describing the awards* 
Others, such as McGill and British Columbia, had a 
separate section devoted entirely to financial assist-

Institutions of Higher Education in Canada (Reference 
Paper No# 4^. Ottawa: Queen^s Printer and Controller 
of Stationery, 1954 ).

ance, or used a separate calendar to list all student 
aid. 

In Chapter I a brief description was given of 
the status of the B. Ed. as a graduate degree. In 
Ontario, for example, the B. Ed. is granted only by 
the Ontario College of Education to students who 
already hold a university degree. This raised the 
question of whether or not a student entering the 
College would be eligible for an award given to a 
student graduating in Arts. While the University of 
Toronto classifies the B. Ed. as an undergraduate 
degree, the University of New Brunswick lists it as 
a graduate degree, along with its masters’ and 
doctoral degrees. In this thesis, to avoid ambiguity, 
candidates for a B. Ed. at universities such as those 
above were classified as doing graduate work. The 
question of what awards such students would be eligible 
for, remained, however, a difficult one. 

In those universities where education is not 
separate, but is included in some other faculty, it 
became difficult to determine whether or not students 
in an education pattern vrere eligible for certain awards. 
In many instances the eligibility of the student would 
depend upon circiomstances. Registrars, themselves, felt 


T 1 




l i.i' . ' M- 


:■ ’b:' ii}\ i .t 








23 


that in some cases only an awards committee would be 
competent to decide the eligibility of a candidate» 
Frequently the final decision might rest upon how 
many other students were applying. 

In universities that had a separate Faculty 
of Education the question of eligibility was much 
more easily resolved. In these universities, awards 
that were considered to be available to students in 
the Faculty of Education were listed separately. 

The status of schools or faculties closely 
related to education, such as Physical Education, 
Household Economics, Music and Art gave cause for 
concern. Ontario, for example, excluded all awards 
tenable in these areas from the list sent there for 
revision, whereas British Columbia left similar awards 
in their list. Undoubtedly, the status of the special 
faculty or school played a large part in forming a 
decision to include or exclude such awards. 

Another of the problems encountered in the 
study of the university calendars was that of trying 
to determine whether an award was available for under- 
graduate or graduate study. Only a few of the 
universities listed graduate awards separately. In 
many instances awards listed under one faculty or

department could also be held by students in another 
department or at the graduate levelo A parallel 
problem arose from highly restricted awards, which 
were usually granted by the head of the department, 
to applicants immediately under his notice® No 
publicity was given to such awards outside of the 
department concerned® 

The universities in the Atlantic Provinces 
and in Quebec presented a-problem with respect to the 
amounts of aid granted to individual applicants® 

Many of the amounts were unspecified, and many were 
made up from the interest earned by a trust fund and 
might vary from year to year® Some grants were on a 
rotating basis and applied every second or third year 
or vihen the fund became large enough to make an award 
possible. The size of the awards-was generally on a 
very limited scale. It was previously stated that an 
arbitrary minimum of |100 had been set in this study. 
This meant, for example, that all awards from St. 
Josephus had to be excluded, for every one of a total 
of 134 awards were for amounts of $5 or flO each* 

One final problem of considerable magnitude 
had to be met* The calendars of Laval and the Univer¬ 
sity of Montreal were in French. Attempts to have

pertinent parts of the calendars translated were not 
too successful. As a final solution the awards of 
these universities were submitted to the respective 
Deans with the request that changes, deletions and 
additions be made as required. The fact that no 
changes were suggested does not mean that the listing 
was accurate, for the language barrier proved a 
formidable one. It was felt, nevertheless, that a 
large measure of a chievement resulted from the inter¬ 
changes with the French-language universities, as 
these exchanges represented the first time a survey 
of this nature had been attempted, and the responses 
were definitely encouraging. 

The report on financial aid to graduate 
students in education was revised four times. Each 
revision was checked against the original data in the 
university calendars. Then a first draft, setting 
forth the awards available to Canadian students at 
any Canadian university and the awards tenable at 
the particular university, was sent to the dean or 
head of the education department at each university. 

An accompanying letter asked that the draft be 
checked for accuracy and completeness and returned by 
a specified date# The corrected version of this draft 
was incorporated into the report contained in Appendix C#

II« QUESTIONNAIRES TO DEANS OF EDUCATION 

Financial assistance to students in education 
in the form of assistantships, demonstratorships, and 
special grants only rarely appeared in the universit3^ 
calendars. A list of such types of aid contained in 
The American Psychologist ‘s was checked against the 
corresponding calendars, and largely found to be 
lacking. 


In order to obtain the desired information, 
a questionnaire was sent to the dean of education at 
each university, since no other person was likely to 
have the information available* But deans are busy

people, constantly being asked to supply information® 

To try to meet the objection to still another list of 
questions to be answered, the following criteria were 
set up: 

( 1 ) The questionnaire was to be a part of the deans’ 
own request, for they had asked for the survey 
at the First Canadian Conference, and would 
receive the results of the study at the Second 
Conference® 

( 2 ) Only essential information was to be requested, 
in the clearest possible language® 

( 3 ) The questionnaire was to be kept to one page in 
length, if at all possible® 

( 4 ) A covering letter, on University of Alberta 
stationery, was to be used to explain the piirpose 
of the questionnaire® 

Four drafts of the questionnaire were prepared, 
and revised. Time did not permit a normal pilot run, 
but the final draft was submitted to the Dean of the 
Faculty of Education, University of Alberta, for his 
criticism. The questionnaire, as mailed to each of the 
eighteen miversities, is contained in Appendix A* The 
replies are discussed in Chapter III.

III, FOUNDATIONS AITD FELLOWSHIP COMMITTEES 

With the completion of the listing of all 
financial awards for graduate students in education as 
given in the university calendars, there remained the 
validation of the reported awards and the search for 
unannounced aid* A canvass of all known Foundations 
and Fellowship Committees was planned as these groups 
were known to make large contributions towards the 
support of both universities and students* 

Two purposes were to be served by the canvass. 
Primarily, awards already announced in universit}^ 
calendars were to be confirmed for accuracy and for 
completeness. In addition, any new sources of financ¬ 
ial aid were to be sought. 

Table IV^ on page 29 , summarizes the canvass 
of the Foundations and Fellov/ship Committees. It 
indicates the sources from which names and addresses 
were obtained, the number of groups that were contacted, 
and the general nature of the replies received. 

The Foundations and Fellowship Committees 
corresponded with were asked to (1) confirm any awards 
reported as being given by them, (2) forward literature 
describing their awards, or (3) advise whether or not 
they made awards in the field of education at the graduate

IV. TEACHERS^ ARD TRUSTEES’ ORGANIZATIONS 

A total of three graduate awards in education 
appeared in the university calendars as being granted 
by teachers’ groups. These needed to be confirmed, and 
the possibility explored that there might be other aid 
available from similar groups. Using the C.E.A. 
Directory of Administrative Officials in Education" ^, 

letters of request were sent to the secretaries of 
sixteen teachers’ and seventeen trustees’ organizations 
across Canada. In addition, personal interviews were 
held with the secretaries of the Alberta Teachers’ 
Association and the Alberta School Trustees’ Associa¬ 
tion. 


One of the letters sent to a teachers’ group, 
and one sent to a trustees’ group grew out of suggest¬ 
ions contained in replies previously received. This 
ciomulative effect of the inquiries proved to be help¬ 
ful in several instances, and served to make more 
positive the validation of the study*

V. SERVICE CLUBS 

Three western universities -- Manitoba, 
Sackatchewan, and British Columbia -- listed in their 
calendars a total of five awards made by Service Clubs 
to graduate students in education. In addition, such 
organizations as the Canadian Federation of University 
Women and the Imperial Order, Daughters of the Empire 
were listed as making awards tenable anywhere in 
Canada. The latter two were large organizations who 
had central committees handling their awards, so they 
were classified v/ith Foundations and Fellowship 
Committees. 

Much difficulty arose in the canvass of 
Service Clubs due to the very nature of these organiza¬ 
tions. Some, such as the Independent Order of Odd 
Fellows were v/e 11-organized on an international level 
and had central committees in charge of all awards# 

This permitted a rapid and thorough canvass of their 
offerings. Others, however, were loosely organized 
so that each local group had almost complete autonomy. 
Thus, unless each local group were contacted, no 
complete listing of all the awards by such a club would 
be possible. The very large number of local organiza¬ 
tions, and the lack of central bodies through which

contacts could be arranged made it impractical, for the 
purposes of this study, to pursue the canvass of Service 
Clubs to a very satisfactory conclusion. 

The calendar of the University of British 
Columbia listed 144 separate awards and loans in all 
faculties, made by ninety-four Service Clubs or 
similar organizations. Despite this number, only one 
name and address, that of the Quota Club, was obtained 
from a university calendaro The final mailing list of 
twenty-four Service Clubs, several of them on a 
national level, was compiled with the help of a local 
directory of the Edmonton Chamber of Commerce The 
Canadian Almanac , and by personal interviews* 

VI. DEPARTi^iMTS OF EDUCATION AND SELECTED SCHOOL 

BOARDS 

One form of financial assistance to graduate 
students in education which never appeared in the 
universit}?” calendars was that of paid leaves of absence 
for purposes of graduate study. Late in 1955 the 
Canadian Education Association had conducted a survey 
to determine v/hat the current policy and practice of 
Provincial Departments of Education and large school

in their employ, A survey questionnaire had been 
mailed to the ten Provincial Departments of Education 
and to forty-seven urban school boards. Thirty-seven 
replies had been received. Permission was received 
from the C.S.A. to use the results of the survey, and 
the raw questionnaire returns were supplied so that an 
analysis pertinent to this study could be made. 

The 0. E. A. survey was verified and extended. 
The verification was achieved by means of letters to 
and replies from each of the Departments of Education, 
respecting aid given to personnel in their employ or 
to university students generally. This material was 
further needed because statements respecting govern¬ 
ment aid as found in the calendars were usually of a 
very general nature. 

The survey was extended with respect to urban 
school boards so that adequate sampling procedures 
might be used. It was found that the number of school

units in Canada exceeded 13,000^^, and that neither a 
complete survey nor a random sampling of this popula¬ 
tion would meet the requirements of the study. The 
latest statistics showed Canada to have 104 cities with 
populations of over 10,000; seventy-five cities with 
populations of over 15,000; and forty-one cities having 
populations of over 25,000^^. From a practical point 
of view, and because paid leaves of absence are only 
rarely granted by school boards in small centers, it 
was decided to canvass school boards in all Canadian 
cities having populations of 15,000 or over. Appendix 
B contains the questionnaire that was sent to each 
school board in the centres so chosen. 

Table V, on page 35, shows a summary of the 
number of school boards contacted by provinces, and of 
the number of replies received. The figures include 
replies on hand from the C,E,A, survey* Efforts were 
made to include in the returns as many Separate school

boards as possible« Questionnaires were sent to each 
of the four denominational school boards in St. John’s, 
Newfoundland. 

Vll. SELECTED BUSINESSES AND INDUSTRIES 

Much the same difficulty was experienced in 
trying to obtain the names of businesses and industries 
that gave financial aid to graduate students as was 
experienced in dealing with Service Clubs. Few 
businesses were listed as giving any aid in education. 
Two companies listed in the McGill calendar and two 
listed in the calendar of the University of Saskatch¬ 
ewan were contacted by letter. Three others were 

12 

obtained through the Canadian Almanac ^ and two other 
names were obtained through personal interviews. The 
total number of businesses and industries contacted 
was nine. 


A visit was made to The Companies Branch, 
Natural Resources Building, Edmonton, in an effort to 
locate the names of companies which might be likely 
sources of financial aid. As at December 29, 1955, 
the Companies Branch listed 19,117 limited liability

companies, 2,44^ friendly societies, and 4,6^3 foreign 
companies outside of Alberta. The picture was further 
complicated by the fact that there was extant no 
complete list of all these companies. Each firm was 
listed on a card, and only an examination of the approx¬ 
imately 26,000 cards would yield the names and addresses© 
The Branch thought about four to six firms included the 
word ^^Foundation^^ in their titles. Section 153 of the 
Companies Act of Alberta permits any limited liability 
company to form a separate company for charitable 
purposes, and again, only an examination of the file of 
each company would reveal whether or not it had 
included charitable purposes in its articles of 
incorporation. A similar arrangement exists for the 
registration of companies in each of the western 
provinces, whereas in the eastern provinces companies 
are incorporated largely by letters patent© It thus 
appeared that an exhaustive pursuit in the area of 
corporate giving for educational purposes lay beyond 
the scope of this study© 

VIII. PERSONAL AND TELEPHONE INTERVIEWS 

Whenever possible, interviews were conducted 
personally or by telephone rather than by mail. The 
interviews served to obtain information and advice, to

confirm information, and to discuss action already- 
taken or contemplated towards solutions of the problem 
of financial aid to university students* 

Table VI, on page 39, indicates the number 
of personal and telephone interviews held, and the 
occupations of the interviewees* The interviews 
lasted from five minutes to one and one-half hours, 
depending upon the type of interviews and the nature 
of the subject under discussion* All interviews were 
held in the Edmonton area, 

IX. COLLECTION OF DATA FROM ARTICLES, 
NEWSPAPER ITEMS, AND MISCELLANEOUS 
SOURCES. 

Numerous articles were used as source materials 
for names to investigate for financial assistance, for 
statistics relative to the amount of aid currently being 
given, for arguments that could be used in pressing for 
further financial assistance, and for descriptions of 
existing aid schemes. The articles were found in both 
professional and popular magazines. Writers and 
publishers were very generous in forwarding reprints 
of pertinent articles* Newspaper clippings served in 
much the same role as did magazine articles. They 
frequently served to focus attention upon plans for 
increased assistance well in advance of the more formal

Where questions of interpretation arose, 
reference was made to the actual statutes covering 
the point in question* Copies of the statutes were 
reinforced by copies of departmental regulations 
where these were applicable* 

It has already been mentioned that several 
files of material were made available for the purposes 
of this study* The Registrar’s office, University of 
Alberta, kindly lent two large files on Graduate 
Awards , and the use of university calendars that 
could not be obtained directly from the university in 
question. The Students’ Union, University of Alberta, 
permitted the use of its NFCUS file on Government 
Aid for University Students . The Canadian Teachers’ 
Federation, Ottawa, lent its file on Graduate Scholar ¬ 
ships and Fellowships , and the Canadian Education 
Association allowed the use of its survey material on 
paid leaves of absence, as well as its Information 
Service Bulletins . Dr. R. A* Schofield, Harvard 
University, kindly fonvarded a pertinent Report of

made to the Senate of the University in February, 1956* 
X. FOLLOW-UP LETTERS AND RESPONSES 

The framer of a questionnaire or letter of 
inquiry is usually faced with the necessity for follow¬ 
up letters if his first inquiries do not elicit ready 
responses. In the preparation of the report to be 
given at the Second Canadian Conference in June, 1956, 
deadlines were always imminento As an incentive to 
quick responses, a date for mailing replies was 
usually suggested, or the date by which the report had 
to be conpleted. In the majority of cases replies 
were received very promptly. 

Follow-up letters were required in some 
cases, but they were sent only after ample time had 
been allowed for answers. The first letters of request 
were sent on December 29, 1955, and the first follow-up 
letters on February 15, 1956« Due to a lack of time 
and to the nature of the request, no follow-up letters 
were sent to those of the ninety-four urban school 
boards who failed to reply to the questionnaire respect¬ 
ing paid leaves of absence* 

Of a total of fifty follow-up letters written, 
twenty-seven were first follow-ups, asking for the

original information, eight were second follow-ups 
requesting the same thing in more urgent terms, and 
fifteen asked for additional information or were 
normal replies to the letters receivedo Table VII, 
on page 43, shows this distribution of original 
letters and of follow-up letters according to the 
type of institution being approached* The number 
and percentage of replies from each kind of letter 
are also shown. 

Usable replies were received from every 
university that had been represented at the First 
Canadian Conference of Deans, from every Department 
of Education, from every foundation and fellowship 
committee, and from every business firm that had 
been approached for information. Almost all the 
teachers^ and trustees’ organizations and the service 
clubs answered the requests for information. If the 
school boards were excluded, the total percentage of 
replies received was ninety-six per cent. 

A final evaluation of the returns in terms 
of the validity of the study indicate that every 
university calendar announcement of an award avail¬ 
able to a graduate student in education had been 
checked, revised, and approved by the Dean of Education

of the university concerned. Every Departraent of 
Education had verified its position with respect to 
graduate aid in education. Every foundation and 
fellowship conmittee that made an award in education 
or that granted one that might have been interpreted 
as being applicable in the field of education had 
verified its position with respect to its awards or 
had forwarded literature describing them in detail. 
Every teachers’ organization except one, and every 
trustees’ organization except two, including both 
English and French-speaking groups, had indicated its 
position with respect to financial aid. Those 
businesses that were listed in any university calendar 
or V7ere mentioned in any other literature as giving 
aid for higher education had sent their literature or 
otherwise verified their positions with respect to 
graduate awards. Similarly, service clubs that were 
known or were thought to make graduate awards had had 
their aid programs checked. The school boards in 
seventy-two per cent of Canada’s cities of 15,000 
population or over had confirmed the amount of graduate 
aid they gave. In short, every reasonable effort had 
been made to make the validation of the study as 
thorough and accurate as it could be.

XI, SCHOOL OF GRADUATE STUDIES, UNIVERSITY OF ALBERTA 

The second purpose of this study was to provide 
factual information directly applicable to the University 
of Alberta, its School of Graduate Studies, and espec¬ 
ially to the Faculty of Education. Statistics to this 
purpose were gathered from the minutes of the Council 
of the School of Graduate Studies relative to the 
numbers of students registered in regular winter sessions 
and in summer sessions, the faculties in which the 
students were registered and the degrees that were being 
granted, and the graduate financial awards that had been 
made since 1950» 

Registrations in the School of Graduate Studies . 
The University of Alberta operates a regular winter 
session where students normally complete full-time intra¬ 
mural studies. Full time students are those who are 

12 

registered in two-thirds or more of a full yearns work. 

In addition, there are many part tim.e registrations. 

These include registrations in the Evening Division, 

Part time students are defined as those who are regist- 

1 ^ 

ered in less than two-thirds of a full yearns works " 

^^University of Alberta, Graduate Studies 
(Minutes of the Meetings of the Council of the School 
of Graduate Studies, November 24, 1955 to November 15, 
1956), Vol. IV, p, 2o 

^3ibid.

Table VIII, on page 47, suinmarizes the 
registrations of graduate students in the regular 
winter sessions from 1951 to 1957. They are shown 
by faculties, by sex, and are divided into full time 
and part time registrations. An effort to obtain the 
ages of the registrants failed because the data could 
be obtained only from a study of the total registrations 
at this University for each year. The figures shown are 
those supplied by the Director of the School of Graduate 
Studies to the Refeistrar of the University for use in 
an annual report to the Mnister of Finance, in Ottawa. 
No reports were available for the years prior to 1951. 

The graduate students indicated in Table VIII 
were proceeding towards masters’ or doctoral degrees. 

The M. Sc. degree is granted in Agriculture, Engineer¬ 
ing, and the Sciences, the M. A, is granted in Arts, 
and the M. Ed. is granted in Education, 

Table DC, on page 48, shoves the number of 
students registered for a doctor’s degree at the 
University of Alberta in the School of Graduate Studies 
for the years 1951 to 1957. The faculties are shown in 
which the degrees were to be granted. All students 
registered for a doctoral degree in the years indicated

The registrations of graduate students at 
summer sessions of this University for the years 1953 
to 1956 are shown in Table X, on page 50. The figures 
V7ere obtained directly from the lists of students 
registered each year.^^ No figures were available for 
the years prior to 1953* In 1956 the names and 
initials only of all students were given, making a 
distribution of enrollments by sex impossible. 

Financial awards made in the School of Graduate 
Studies . A number of financial awards made to students 
at the University of Alberta are granted through the 
School of Graduate Studies. The minutes of the School 
show a total of fourteen such awards made during the 
years 1950 to 1956.^^ Twelve of them are shown in 
Table XI, on page 51* In 1951 two additional fellow¬ 
ships were awarded, but being of a temporary nature 
they did not reappear in subsequent years. One was the 
Brunner Mond Canada Limited Fellowship for $2000, and 
the other was the Lignosol Fellowship for |1500* The

CHAPTER.Ill 


ANALYSIS OF THE DATA 

The revised data respecting available financial 
aid for graduate students working in the field of 
education, as of June, 1956, is contained in Appendix C* 
This was the report that was submitted to the Second 
Canadian Conference of Deans and Professors of Education 
at Montreal. It was considered unnecessary to reproduce 
these data in the main body of the thesis, and when 
references are made to specific awards they will be made 
to the appropriate pages in Appendix C. 

With the data collected, an analysis will 
provide answers to the following questions: 

(1) Are all forms of financial assistance available 
to students for graduate work in education known 
to the universities? 

(2) Do university calendars list every available form 
of assistance? 

(3) How much financial aid is currently offered for 
graduate work in education? 

I. THE LISTING OF FINANCIAL AID 

The question as to whether every form of 
financial assistance to graduate students is known to

the universities must be ansv/ered in the negative. 

Major sources of aid, such as that provided by founda¬ 
tions, are knoivn. The only variations found between 
the announcements contained in the university calendars 
and the statements submitted by the donors themselves 
arose from revisions to awards that were not known by 
the universities in time to permit their inclusion in 
the latest calendars. 

The largest source of financial aid to students 
not known to the universities was in the area of aid 
given by teachers^ and trustees^ organizations. The 
G. E. A. survey respecting paid leaves of absence^ 
and the results of this study revealed a situation with 
respect to paid leaves of absence for purposes of 
further study and for in-service training that was not 
reported in any university calendar. 

Table XII, on page 55? shows the number of 
school boards in Canadian cities having pcpulations of 
15,000 or over, by provinces, which grant paid leaves 
of absence to their employees. Short term leave of up

to six weeks, if given in the surmner, would permit 
employees to take university summer school courses* 
Long term leave of from seven months to one year 
would permit normal intramural university study. 
Although school boards and Departments of Education 
restrict the granting of paid leaves of absence both 
as to the number granted and the purposes for which 
they are granted and require varying term-S of service 
before leave can be applied for, there is no method 
of determining from the returns whether the leave was 
used for undergraduate or graduate study. In other 
words, Table XII in many cases merely indicates what 
aid is available, not necessarily what has been 
utilized* Available leave of absence is not always 
used by employees for educational study, and when it 
is used for educational advancement, is not alwa}/s 
used for purposes of graduate study. This makes it 
extremely difficult for the universities to include 
such leave in the announcements of financial assist- 
ance* 


Another form of financial aid to students not 
always knovm to the universities is that given by local 
service clubs. It is a fairly common practice for a 
local branch of a service club to make a financial 
contribution towards sending a worthy scholar to

university. If such aid is part of a regular program 
of aid by the service club it will be known to the 
university, but if the aid is only occasional it will 
likely be unknovm. Frequently the central executives 
of service clubs do not know the full extent of the 
aid given by their local branches. It should be noted, 
however, that most aid of this kind is given at the 
matriculation and undergraduate levels. Only rarely 
is it given at the graduate level. 

There are numerous difficulties encountered 
in attempting to list in a university calendar every 
known form of financial aid to students. Highly 
specialized awards are usually made available only in 
certain departments under specified conditions, if the 
particular conditions for the work exist, and if a 
suitable candidate is available. Such awards are 
frequently under the direct control of the head of the 
department and are applied for and awarded to candidates 
with whom he has close contact and who will work under 
his direction. Under such circumstances announcements 
of restricted awards are left to the discretion of the 
department concerned, and do not appear in the calend¬ 
ars . 


Several universities announce in their calend¬ 


ars assistantships that are available within each

department, but most of the Canadian universities do 

not announce them. One list of such assistantships 

2 

and demonstratorships was checked against the 
corresponding calendars and most of the assistance 
was found to be omitted from the calendars. Several 
reasons suggest themselves for the omissions. Assist¬ 
antships are restricted in nature, and come under the 
direct control of a departmental head. If groups of 
departmental heads had to meet to revise lists of 
assistantships, the process v/ould be time-consuming 
and costly. Departmental budgets for assistantships 
are rather elastic to permit the amount of money spent 
for this purpose to be adapted to the circumstances* 

This elasticity makes for difficulty in publicizing 
accurately the numbers or amounts of such assistance* 
Research assistantships depend upon what research 
problems come before a department, as well as upon the 
availability of suitable candidates. Both of these 
factors are hard to predict. 

Table XIII, on page 59, summarizes the 
assistantships and special grants available for graduate

column ’^Assistantships" includes teaching, research, 
marking, and reading assistantships, demonstrator¬ 
ships, lectureships and counsellorships, as well as 
special types of assistantships* The ”Grants^^ column 
includes travel, equipment, expense, tuition fee, 
board and room, and special grants, as well as grants- 
in-aid and monetary prizes* 

The number of assistantships granted at the 
Canadian universities is not large, nor is the total 
amount great* The average is less than tv^o per 
university, valued at approximately |600 each per 
year* The grants average less than one per university 
and are valued at slightly over |200 each per year* 

The smaller universities appear to be unable to finance 
this type of student assistance* 

A number of university departments have avail¬ 
able small funds to be used for special contingencies* 
These are seldom advertised as the amounts are small 
and are not intended to be used as a regular source of 
aid to students, but only in cases of necessity or 
emergency* 

II, SCHOLARSHIPS, FELLOWSHIPS, AND BURSARIES 


Most of the financial aid to students listed 






61 


by the Canadian universities is in the form of scholar¬ 
ships, fellowships, and bursaries. The tables that 
follow summarize and analyse this assistance in several 
ways. 

Table XIV, on pages 62 and 63, shows the 
numbers and approximate values of the scholarships, 
fellowships, and bursaries granted by various donors 
for graduate study in education at any Canadian 
university. The numbers are shorn by provinces and by 
the class of donor. In addition, the awards are list¬ 
ed as (1) for strictly graduate work, and (2) for work 
towards a B. Ed. for those already holding an under¬ 
graduate degree. In a number of cases a group of 
awards of an unspecified number or amount is granted. 

To indicate such a group of awards the letter is 
used. Amounts shown are only approximate in many 
cases, as some awards are stated as being the interest 
earned by a fund. In such cases interest is estimated 
at 3 % of the fund. 

Foundations and Fellowship Committees offer 
about half the total aid given in Canada for graduate 
study at any university. Service Clubs come next with 
thirteen awards valued at $^300. The approximate total 
offered to graduates in education above the B. Ed. level

is sixty-five awards worth about $90,^75• This averages 
approximately four awards per university, valued at 
about $1400 each per year. This figure becomes consid¬ 
erably diminished when it is realized that unrestricted 
awards are open to the total university student popula¬ 
tion. Graduate students in education are subject to 
strong competition in trying to obtain some of the 
awards listed in Table XIV« Correspondence from a 
number of the universities indicated that no student 
in education ever has held some of the awards listed 
for open competition. 

Table XV, on pages 65 and 66, summarizes the 
scholarships, fellowships, and bursaries granted by 
the same group of donors as shown in Table XIV, but 
tenable at specified Canadian universities. Awards 
are classified as strictly graduate if outside of 
parentheses, or for a B. Ed. following another univer¬ 
sity degree if inside parentheses. The letter 
indicates a group of awards of an unspecified number 
or amount. Estimates of the interest earnings from 
funds are made at 3 

A comparison of the totals of Tables XIV and 
XV shows that the universities are more generous in 
giving aid at their own specified institution than

they are in giving aid at a university of the student’s 
choice. Departments of government, particularly 
Departments of Education, are more interested in giving 
aid at their own provincial universities, and more par¬ 
ticularly to help train prospective teachers at the 
B. Ed. level* Foundations and Fellowship Committees 
have concentrated nearly all their help at the dominion¬ 
wide level. Teachers and Trustees have used much the 
same approach as Departments of Education and have 
given most of their aid to prospective teachers work¬ 
ing towards a Bachelor of Education degree. 

Service Clubs are about as active in aiding 
university students at the federal level as they are 
at the provincial level, although the amount of aid 
given to students at the university of their choice 
is much more generous than that given at a specified 
university. From the total, it might appear that 
Business and Industry have given freely to aid students 
at specified provincial universities. However, fifteen 
of the seventeen awards in the ’’Business” column in 
Table XV were awarded for the first time in 1956 by the 
Du Pont Company of Canada. If these fifteen scholar¬ 
ships, worth $1500 each, were removed, a total of two 
scholarships valued at $650 and one unspecified group 
were all that Business offered at the seventeen

Canadian universities prior to 1956« 

Memorial scholarships play a fairly large part 
in supporting students at provincial universities, and 
they are rather evenly distributed across Canada. In 
total, Canada^s universities offer their graduate 
students, not including those studying for a B. Edo, 
an opportunity to compete for sixty-one scholarships, 
fellowships, or bursaries valued at approximately 
$41,750, and eleven groups of awards of an unspecified 
amount. These give an average of less than four 
awards per university, valued at about $680 each. 

Table XVI, on page 69, shows the total scholar¬ 
ships, fellowships, and bursaries available at all 
Canadian universities in the various fields of study. 

It summarizes the awards shown in the two previous 
tables in such a way that their closer application to 
the field of education becomes evident. Some difficulty 
was experienced in setting up this table due to the 
listing of some awards in several fields of study. In 
such cases awards were placed in the category to which 
the descriptive literature relating to the award seemed 
best to apply. If an award is restricted in any way, 
the name of the province in which the award is made 
available is indicated in parentheses after the number

of awards. The letter indicates a group of awards 
of an unspecified number or amount. Av/ards tenable in 
the field of education are divided into strictly 
graduate awards and those available to holders of one 
university degree who are studying for a B. Ed. 

In examining the total of Table XVI^ it 
should be borne in mind that the forty individual 
and six groups of awards in the ^UJnrestricted^^ column 
are open for competition by the entire university 
student population of Canada, To a lesser degree 
much the same is true of the twenty-six individual 
and nine groups of awards in column two. Correspond¬ 
ence with university authorities indicated that few, 
if any, education students are successful in gaining 
awards in the Humanities or Languages, where they are 
in competition with students who are specializing in 
these fields. In essence, then, the only financial 
aid available to a graduate student in education in 
Canada is contained in the twenty-three single and 
three groups of awards shown in the "Education - 
Graduate" column. Of these, eight single and three 
groups of awards are tenable at any university in 
Canada, while the remaining fifteen are tenable at 
specified universities in the various provinces® 





71 

III. THE BACHELOR OF EDUCATION ASSISTANCE PROGRM 

It has already been stated on page gg that in 
some universities students are permitted to enroll for 
a B* Ed. degree only after having received a university 
degree such as a B. A. At all universities granting a 
E. Ed., students already holding another degree may 
enter a program leading to the B. Ed. A few univer¬ 
sities list the B. Ed. as a graduate degree, although 
most of them consider students in this pattern as 
doing undergraduate work. At the time of collecting 
the data for this study, it was necessary to set up 
limitations in order to, avoid confusion. Thus, 
students who already possessed one university degree 
and who were proceeding to a B. Ed., were classified 
as doing graduate work. 

In the analysis of the data, every effort was 
mads to isolate awards available for strictly graduate 
work from those available to students in a B. Ed. 
program. The latter awards were starred in the draft 
of the report sent to each university for correction 
and in the final report submitted to the Second 
Canadian Conference at Montreal. Tables XIV, XV and 
XVI have the B. Ed. awards separated from the others 
to permit a truer picture to be formed of the amount 





'.j 


j: 


.' '.;. i •,\.r ' ' 








72 


of aid available for graduate study. 

Table XVII, on page 73, summarizes the 
scholarships, fellowships, and bursaries available 
to students holding an undergraduate degree and 
proceeding to a Bachelor of Education degree. No 
attempt was made to total the figures as the value 
of the grant was not stated in one case, and in 
Nova Scotia the value was determined by the amount 
of fees the students had to pay. Similarly, many 
of the Departments of Education were willing to 
pay the grants to all students who qualified, hence 
the numbers could not bq stated. The total finan¬ 
cial aid given under this program must be quite 
large. However, it is given to assist students to 
qualify as secondary school teachers in most cases, 
and as such does not fall strictly within the limits 
of ^^graduate” assistance, 

IV. LOANS AVAILABLE FOR GRilDUATE STUI3Y 

The situation at the Canadian universities 
with respect to loans available to students doing 
graduate work is not too clear. In the majority of 
cases loans appear to be available to students only 
during their undergraduate years^ and usually to 
senior students about to complete their degree programs*

Table XVIII, on page 75, indicates the number 
of loan funds available for graduate study at specified 
Canadian universities. Only six of the seventeen 
universities have funds available for graduate students. 
Loans are made available only to full-time winter stud¬ 
ents, and preference is usually given to senior students. 
The amount of an individual loan varies v/ith the stud¬ 
ent's need, but usually has a maximum amount of $300, 

The funds were set up by individual donors, by teacher 
and alumni groups, and in one case by the university 
itself. More than one university has a revolving loan 
fund available. Most of the universities which have 
available loan funds reported that the funds seemed 
adequate to fill the needs of all applicants. 

Table XIX, on page 76, shows the loans granted 
by large organizations and generally tenable in the 
province of origin. The only loan fund available to 
education students and others across Canada is the 
Independent Order of Odd Fellows Educational Founda¬ 
tion Revolving Loan Fund. The status of the Dominion- 
Provincial Student Loan Fund varies considerably from 
province to province. In four of the provinces — 

Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and 
Saskatchewan -- the fund may be used to assist students

in any degree program, including graduate degreeso In 
British Columbia the fund makes loans to students in 
any undergraduate degree program, including the B. Ed. 
program. In Alberta and Manitoba the fund makes loans 
only for undergraduate degree programs. Newfoundland 
and Quebec have no Dominion-Provincial Loan Fund. 
Ontario has such a fund, but does not use it as a loan 
fund. Instead, Ontario uses the fund to make student- 
aid bursaries, which may be granted to students en¬ 
rolled in full-time courses at Canadian universities 
up to the B. Ed. level. Details of the bursaries are 
given on page 49 of the report in Appendix C.

Registrations . For convenience, the totals 
from Table VIII on page 47, and Table X on page 50, 
are combined in Table XX on page 7^, which shows the 
total registrations of students studying for a master’s 
or a doctor’s degree in the various faculties in the 
School of Graduate Studies at the University of Alberta 
for the years 1953 to 1957• Regular winter session 
registrations show both full time and part time 
students.

Table XX indicates that students in the 
Faculties of Agriculture and Engineering did all their 
studying in the winter sessions. In the Sciences from 
^7 fo to 9k fo took their courses during the v/inter 
sessions in the years shown, while in Arts from 67 
to ^3 io took their courses during the winter session. 

In Education, during the years 1953 to 1957, from 37 lo 
to 41 io took courses during the winter session, while from 
59 % to 63 took them during the summer session. 

Another comparison of the means used by 
students at the Universit}^ of Alberta to obtain the 
requisite courses towards a master’s or a doctor’s 
degree can be made from Table XXI, on page ^0. This 
table shows the percentages registered as full time 
or part time students in the School of Graduate 
Studies, by faculties, for the years 1953 to 1957. 

The part time students include those in the winter 
session as well as in the summer session, while full 
time registrations are for the winter session only. 

In the Faculty of Agriculture from ^3 % to 
100 io of the students registered for their graduate 
degree courses in full time intramural programs 
during the years 1953 to 1957. Of the students who 
registered for part time courses (O to lljb), all

did so in the regular winter sessions. From 6^ % 
to % of the Engineering students registered for 
full time regular winter sessions, and so did from 
62 % to S 2 fo of the Science students. In Arts and 
Education the pattern was reversed. From 65 % to 
80 io of the Arts graduates registered as part time 
winter or summer students, and from 97 % to 99 fo 
of those in Education were part time students. 

The registration of students in the School 
of Graduate Studies at the University of Alberta 
who were studying for a master^s or a doctor’s 
degree in the Faculty of Education during the years 
1953 to 1957 is shown graphically in Figure 1, on 
page B2. Three categories of registrations are 
indicated: full time winter students, part time 
winter students, and part time summer students. 

Both male and female registrations are included in 
the totals. A comparison of these registrations 
with those shown for graduate students in Agriculture, 
Engineering, and Science in Table XX shows the diver¬ 
gent pattern of registrations for M. Sc. and for 
M. Ed. candidates.

through the School of Graduate Studies at the University 
of Alberta for the years 1950 to 1956. The first is 
that of the ten awards made in 1956, two were granted 
to students working in the field of Agriculture, three 
were in Arts, one was in Education, one was in Engineer¬ 
ing, and three were in Science. A comparison of Table 
XI on page 51, with the financial awards listed on 
pages 59 to 6l of Appendix G shows that of the awards 
granted through the School of Graduate Studies of the 
University of Alberta, only the Stapells Graduate, 
the Robert Tegler Research, and the University of 
Alberta Research Scholarships are deemed to be avail¬ 
able to Alberta students stud^^ing in the field of 
education. The available data do not reveal x^rhether 
mors than one University of Alberta Research Scholar¬ 
ship has ever been av^arded to a graduate education 
student. 

The second point of significance in Table XI 
is the indicated fact that each year since 1952 the 
School of Graduate Studies has had available financial 
aid which has not been utilized. The data do not 
reveal x-^hy certain awards were not made in the years 
1952 , 1953 , and 1955 , but do point out that in 1954 
no candidate met the eligibility requirements for the 
Canadian Sugar Factories Scholarship, and in 1956

there were no applications for this award. Further 
evidence is found in the minutes of the Council of the 
School of Graduate Studies for 1951, which say in part: 

Dean McCalla drew attention to the urgency 
of increasing the value of these (University of 
Alberta Research) scholarships. If they remain¬ 
ed at their present value (#600), it was clear 
that the best students would not apply for them. 
Actually that had occurred last year. 


The Director of the School of Graduate Studies 
expressed the same reason for having unused aid remain¬ 
ing in the School, when he suggested that professional 
jobs were so easy to obtain, and the starting rates of 
pay in business and industry were so attractive, that 
the value of the aid offered was not on a scale generous 
enough to hold many of the University’s young graduates. 
In other cases, he felt that the terms under which 
scholarships could be granted were so narrow, that no 

4 

suitable candidates could be found. 


There was further evidence that although in 
some instances financial awards were finally made to

CHAPTER IV 


. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMViEl^ATIONS 

Implications drawn from the portion of this 
study dealing with the Canadian universities are 
contained in Section I of this chapter. It includes 
recommendations for strengthening the program of 
financial aid for graduate students in education. 
Conclusions and implications more directly affecting 
the University of Alberta are contained in Section II« 
Section III concludes with the final recommendations of 
the study. 

I, CONCLUSIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE CANADIAN 
UNIVERSITIES 

Universities . The Canadian universities in 
themselves are not large donors of financial aid to 
graduate students in education. Two travelling fellovr- 
ships are offered by the University of Planitoba 
(Appendix C, page 51) and one graduate scholarship by 
the University of British Columbia (Appendix C^ page 63) 
for study anywhere in Canada. A total of three single 
and four groups of awards are offered by universities 
for study at some specified university (Table XV^ 
pages 65 and 66). As might be expected, the univer¬ 
sities give much more financial aid to students in the

form of assistantships, demonstratorships, and grants® 
Here, the aid is considerably in excess of |20,690 per 
year in assistantships and in excess of $3,103 per 
year in grants (Table XIII, page 59)« 

Scholarships which are tenable at any univer¬ 
sity, or which are open to students from any university 
need to be drawn to the attention of students across 
Canada* The terms in which these awards are described 
should be as uniform as possible* It would appear to 
be a forward step if the Canadian universities were 
able to develop a more uniform method for describing 
financial aid. If it is accepted that the purpose of 
financial assistance is to help worthy students 
through university, then it becomes imperative that 
the right students become aware of the available assist 
ance. It is suggested that every form of aid available 
to students —■ scholarships, fellowships, bursaries, 
loans, assistantships, special grants, research grants, 
emergency funds, and paid leaves of absence -- should 
be appropriately listed in each university calendar. 

If a particular form of financial aid can be stated 
only in general terms, this should be done in the 
interests of calling to the attention of every univer¬ 
sity student and every potential student the fact that 
there is available a wide variety of help*

Departmentsof Government , Various govern¬ 
ment departments across Canada offer four individual 
and four groups of awards at the graduate level, and 
four groups of awards at the bachelor^s level, ten¬ 
able at any Canadian university (Table XIV, pages 
62 and 63 )• The Department of Education of Manitoba 
offers six scholarships each year to graduate students 
entering the B* Ed, course in Manitoba (Appendix G, 
page 52 ), and the DepartHient of Education of Alberta 
offers up to forty bursaries each year to graduates 
entering the Faculty of Education in Alberta for a 
B. Ed. degree (Appendix G, page 60 ). 

It hardly needs emphasizing that the view 
has been widely held for some time that more help in 
the financing of education must be obtained from 
government at both the provincial and federal levels. 

The campaign to gain federal support for higher 
education has been aided by many organizations* The 
Canadian Federation of Mayors and Municipalities in 
February, 1956, urged the government to provide greater 
aid for education, including 50,000 annual scholarships. 

^News item in the Edmonton Journal , February 29 


1956 










A brief in favor of federal aid to education was pre¬ 
pared in 1956 for the Canadian School Trustees’ Assoc¬ 
iation and the Canadian Teachers’ Federation,^ for 
presentation to the Cabinet. Almost daily news items 
appear indicating a growing public awareness of this 
needo 


The National Conference of Canadian Univer¬ 
sities sponsored a national conference on higher 
education in Ottawa in November 195^, to discuss 
’’the crisis in higher education in Canada. ”3 
conference the Prime Minister outlined the Govern¬ 
ment’s proposals to increase the grants to the 
Canadian universities from the fifty cents per capita- 
level to double this amount.'^ The proposals for the 
formation of a Canada Council for the Arts, Hum.anities 
and Social Sciences were also outlined, together with 
plans to assist in the building and capital equipment 
costs of the universities ft For the latter purpose 

'^Statement by Dr. M. E. LaZerte, personal 
interview, April 4, 1956, 

3News item in The Canadian University Post 
(Montreal), October 13^ 1956.

the proposed grant was fifty million dollars to be 
spent over a period of ten years. For the Canada 
Council the proposed grant was fifty million dollars 
^^to help voluntary organizations in the fields of the 
arts, and humanities and the social sciences, to 
devise and administer a system of scholarships in 
these fields, to foster Canada^s cultural relations 
abroad and to perform the function of a national 
commission for UNESCO, 

The proposals outlined by the Government, 
commendable as they are, do not resolve the crisis 
for education. Where education fits into the 
activities of the Canada Council is not yet apparent. 
However, it is possible that as more assistance is 
obtained from both provincial and federal governments 
at the undergraduate and other levels, some of the 
financial aid that is presently available in other 
areas can be channelled into aid to education at the 
graduate level. 

Foundations and Fellov/ships , Foundations and 
fellowship committees have made available for graduate 
study in education at any Canadian university a total

of thirty-two scholarships and four groups of awards 
of an unspecified number (Table XIV, pages 62 and 63)• 
In addition, the Carnegie Corporation offers tw^o 
scholarships annually, tenable at the University of 
British Columbia (Appendix C, page 67). The financial 
aid programs of foundations are probably the most 
clearly defined and widely used forms of aid known to 
the universities. A study of the annual reports of 
foundations active in Canada seems to indicate that 
education is not receiving aid commensurate with its 
importance to society. Without in any way assiaming 
to question the program of any foundation or the 
pattern in v/hich any university distributes the aid 
it receives from foundations, the question is raised 
as to whether foundations are assisting various 
faculties of the universities in a planned way, or 
xfhether the aid given by them is assigned to various 
fields of study according to the needs of the moment 
Is there a need for over-all planning of the best vjays 
to distribute the available financial aid to students 
so that the long-range needs of society are met as well 
as the immediate needs of the individual students? 

Teachers and Trustees . The three scholarships 
and one group of awards shown in Table XIV, on pages 
62 and 63, in the column headed ^^Teachers and Trustees^% 








92 


are all offered by teachers^ groups in the provinces 
indicated. In Table on pages 65 and 66, all nine 
of the awards shown in the corresponding column are 
offered by teachers^ organizations, and all are at the 
B. Ed. level. In other words, out of a total of 
twelve single and one group of awards made to assist 
graduate students in education, none are made by 
trustees’ organizations. The available data indicates 
that no financial help in the form of scholarships, 
fellowships, bursaries, or loans is given by any 
trustees’ group in Canada. 

There is one form of aid to students in 
education that is given exclusively by trustees* 

This aid is in the form of paid leaves of absence 
that can be used for purposes of further educational 
study. No figures are available respecting the dollar 
amount of aid given through paid leaves of absence, 
but the total is slowly increasing. Tv^o large urban 
school boards in Ontario and one in British Columbia 
indicated they were considering the granting of paid 
leaves of absence to their employees. Correspondence 
with teacher organizations indicated that in several 
provinces negotiations between teachers and their 
employing boards would soon include requests for this 
type of financial aid. 




93 


Trustees, as the legal guardians of the 
educational machine, are vitally concerned with the 
educational qualifications of their teacher employ¬ 
ees. This concern should be felt at all levels, 
including advanced graduate training. Every effort 
should be made by both teachers and trustees to 
enlarge the area of assistance given by the trustees 
to include direct aid at the graduate level. 

Teachers^ organizations across Canada should 
continue their efforts to have written into their 
salary agreements clauses providing for paid leaves 
of absence for purposes of further educational study. 
From the available evidence, the Atlantic Provinces 
and Quebec have not yet reached the point where this 
form of assistance has been given by school boards. 

A good start has been made in Ontario, with prospects 
of further advances. Alberta, with seven school 
boards granting selected groups of teacher employees 
up to a full year of leave with pay, (Appendix G, 
page 5^), appears to be in advance of the other 
provinces in respect to the amount of this aid granted 
by the trustees. 

The universities could v/ell look to Canada^ s 
school trustees to encourage more students to enter 




94 

the schools of graduate studies. If the degree of help 
given by the trustees could be broadened, if the amounts 
granted could be increased to the point where they are 
capable of sustaining married students in university 
for a year, and if experienced workers in education 
could be persuaded to utilize more fully this source 
of help, much improvement in the numbers of students 
doing intramural graduate work in education might well 
be expected. 

The figures in the '^Teachers and Trustees^^ 
column in Table XV, on pages 65 and 66, show nine 
scholarships offered by .teachers* organizations in 
Canada, all for aid toward obtaining a B. Ed. degree. 
Only the three scholarships and one group of awards 
in the corresponding column in Table XIV, on pages 
62 and 63, are for help at the graduate level. It is 
perhaps expecting too much to hope that trustee 
organizations will provide unsolicited financial help 
to students at the graduate level. A worthy objective 
of teacher groups might be to convince the trustees of 
the advantages to education of giving assistance to 
graduate students. 

A study of the areas in which teachers have 
placed most of their financial aid in education, raises 





95 

the question as to whether they are too much concerned 
with trying to get students into the profession, and 
too little concerned with trying to help teachers 
improve their qualifications once they have entered 
teaching. The concern of Departments of Education and 
of trustees with problems of teacher recruitment are 
understandable, and they need help from every available 
quarter. However, professional teachers^ organizations 
might well ask themselves v/hether they are giving 
enough attention to assisting teachers already active 
in the field, to assisting teachers to obtain increased 
graduate training, and to assisting financially in the 
promotion of educational research. 

Service Clubs . Table XIV, on pages 62 and 63 , 
indicates that service clubs contribute more in financ¬ 
ial aid for graduate study at any Canadian university 
than do any other groups except the foundation and 
fellowship committees. These clubs also contribute 
towards graduate study at specified universities, as 
well as towards study at the bachelor^s level {Table 
XV). 

It was indicated in the analysis of the data 
that many service clubs were loosely organized at the 
local level» Only a few were well-organized on a 







96 


federal level. Although the total number of local 
service club branches is not available, it must be 
large. The name ^’service club^^ is indicative of one 
of the primary objectives of such organizations, and 
the data obtained from the calendar of the University 
of British Columbia bears out the contention that 
clubs of this nature are excellent sources of financ¬ 
ial aid to students at university. 

Although beyond the scope of this study, it 
is suggested that in the organization of service 
clubs in Canada, there is a large untapped wealth 
of financial assistance for students at any level of 
study. Means should be found to utilize this source 
of aid. 


Business . Business and industry offer 
Canadian graduate students in education a total of 
five individual and one group of awards,tenable at 
any university. They offer seventeen scholarships 
plus one group of awards tenable at specific Canadian 
universities. Of this total, fifteen Du Pont Scholar¬ 
ships were awarded for the first time in 1956. 

The greatest untapped source of financial aid 
to universities generally, lies in the field of 
Canadian business and industry. Alberta alone, while

having a total of 26,24^ registered companies as at 

December 29, 1955, did not have a single award at the 

graduate level donated by a business or industry* A 

Committee on Corporate Giving in Canada found that of 

total gifts to education amounting to $650,453, 

donated by Canadian corporations, nearly $500,000 

6 

was donated by 192 firms. 

Spokesmen for the universities have for some 
time been warning that although business and industry 
look to the universities of Canada for much of their 
trained personnel, these institutions are not able to 
meet the present needs fully,and without increased 
financial help from industry have less chance of meet- 

7 

ing the future needs.^ 


It would appear that industry is more willing 
to give financial aid to students working in a field 
closely allied with the interests of the industry.

Giving^^ survey gave monejr for work in areas of study 
allied with the interests of their ovm business or

industry 


a 

If faculties of education are to share in the 
aid which industry is capable of giving, two require¬ 
ments must be met* The first is to convince industrial 
donors that the advancement of education and assistance 
to education students are as much in the long-range 
interests of commerce and industry as is the assistance 
of faculties more obviously allied with the interests 
of the business or industry* With the growing shortage 
of university staff, this necessity is rapidly becoming 
urgent* 

A second requirement is the organization of 
the means of informing Canada’s business and industrial 
leaders of the financial needs of education. While 
much has recently appeared in print as to these needs, 
a more positive approach is required* Possible donors 
should be shov/n tentative aid programs suited to their 
businesses and their financial positions* It is doubt¬ 
ful if mere paper campaigns will ever succeed in obtain¬ 
ing all the financial aid that is available* A suit¬ 
able substitute for a personal contact is difficult to 
find*

Memorial and personal ^.iftS o Financial aid 
to graduate students in education from funds established 
as memorial awards or from personal gifts do not form a 
large part of the total aid for study in education at 
any Canadian university (Table XIV), It is at the 
level of the individual university that this kind of 
donation becomes more important. Table XV, on pages 
65 and 66, shows a total of twenty-nine single and 
three groups of awards at the graduate level, and two 
individual and one group of awards made at the bach» 
elor^s level by this type of donor« McGill and the 
University of Toronto lead the Canadian universities 
in the amount of aid available from rrEmorial funds a 

Undoubtedly the size of a university and the 
length of time it has been established will be import¬ 
ant factors in determining the amount of memorial or 
individual donations it will have available. A lengthy 
list of wealthy alumni is a distinct asset when seeking 
financial aid. Other possibilities do exist, however. 
Several Canadian universities have revolving memorial 
bursary and loan funds, ^^hen recipients are in a 
financial position to do so, they are expected to repay 
the loan, or to set up similar memorial funds from 
which aid may be given to future necessitous students.

Individuals, parent-teacher organizations, or service 
clubs might occasionally honor a university alumnus 
by establishing a memorial fund in his name. Financ¬ 
ial awards made by Acadia University are largely of 
this m.emorial type. This university also has a 
Student Benevolent Fund made up from voluntary contri¬ 
butions by students. The fund makes compassionate 
grants necessitated by accidents involving undue

personal expense® 

Loans. Most of the universities which have 
loan funds available for student aid (Table XVIII^ 
page 75), report that the.funds seem adequate for 
their needs. It should be noted, however, that 
loans are generally available only for undergraduate 
study. There would also appear to be some reluctance 
on the part of students to incur debts while still in 
university. 

Several suggestions can be offered to make 
loan funds more useful to graduate students particularly. 
Loans should be made relatively easy to get, provided 
the case is one of need. The amounts, generally up to

$309 per year, are frequently too small, especially 
for older students or those with family obligations. 

To be useful, loans might be made more generous* If 
more loans were granted interest free, or without 
interest and without the need for repayment until 
the student had found employment, they might be 
more acceptable to students* To induce worthy 
students to remain for graduate study at a univer¬ 
sity, loans might be made, then a portion of the 
loan cancelled for each year the borrower spent in 
graduate work* 

II, CONCLUSIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE 
UNIVERSITY OF ALBERTA 

Publicizing financial aid for students* There 
appears to be a lack of Imowledge among university 
students of the full possibilities of the financial aid 
program* Perhaps the University itself is partly 
responsible for an apparent weakness in the publicity 
attached to its aid program. One possible means to 
remedy this weakness is to make greater use of the 
present avenues of communication for placing before 
interested groups the need for as well as the avail¬ 
ability of financial assistance. Periodic publicity 
releases from the University indicating current award 
possibilities would undoubtedly be welcomed by the 







102 

A. T* A. Magazine, the A. S. T. A. Magazine, the 
Federation of Home and School newspaper, and by 
similar public service publications. 

It has already been noted that university 
calendars do not generally list every available form 
of student aid and this would seem to defeat the 
purpose of such assistance. It is suggested that 
every form of aid -- scholarships, fellowships, 
bursaries, loans, prizes, assistantships, demonstrator¬ 
ships, grants-in-aid, emergency funds, and paid leaves 
of absence -- be listed in the calendar. If full 
details cannot be published, enough should be stated 
about each type of assistance to encourage worthy 
students to apply for help. 

It would be to the advantage of the School 
of Graduate Studies to have more graduate intramural 
students enrolled, especially in education. One 
likely source of such students is in the ranks of 
active teachers. An advertising program aimed at 
inducing active teachers to obtain leaves of absence 
for graduate study would help to achieve the desired 
numbers. If such a program were operated in con¬ 
junction with a plan for offering teaching and marking 
assistantships, or demonstratorships, or research

grants-in-aid, more students could be dra\m into the 
Graduate School* In viewing this problem, the total 
economic environment of would-be students cannot be 
i gnored * 


Exact information is needed relative to the 
procedures involved and circumstances under which 
financial aid may be obtained through the Alberta 
Advisory Committee on Educational Research, This 
information could appear in the university calendar 
as well as in brochures and news letters sent out by 
the Committee and by the Faculty of Education, 

It was stated above that service publications 
v7ould probably welcome news about University activities 
of a financial nature. The publisshers'-s would find the 
dissemination of such news much easier if they received 
it in the form of brochures or news letters written in 
the layman^s language. News letters distributed for 
publication might contain lists of currently available 
financial aid, requests for information as to loca.! 
educational problems suitable as research topics, 
brief statements as to the costs of particular research 
projects, suitable comments regarding the need for and 
importance of local studies under way, and names of 
local students undertaking special studies of an

educational nature. 

Another means of publicizing available 
financial aids is through short lists of awards 
arranged in poster size, similar to those sent out 
by the University of Toronto. These are short, 
simple lists, usually divided into categories such 
as Arts and Science, Applied Science, and Education. 
Under each heading the awards are briefly listed by 
title and amount, and a deadline is set for applica¬ 
tions to be sent in. Such a poster would be in¬ 
expensive to print, and could readily be distributed 
to all interested organizations. 

The University of Alberta is already publish¬ 
ing its annual calendar in booklet form by faculties. 
Perhaps the publication of a separate calendar on 
awards, similar to that of McGill University,is 
worthy of consideration, A separate calendar of this 
nature would seem to offer some advantages besides 
permitting increased circulation and publicity. 

The large number of activities related to a 
comprehensive program of financial aid would suggest 
that a ^^Student Aid Committee^’ might be a valuable

means of assisting in the growth of and making more 
effective use of aid to students• The follovdng 
suggestions are offered respecting the functioning 
of such a committee: 

a. ) It might be headed by an adm.inistrative dean 
or director. The University of British Columbia 
placed all financial aid for students under the Dean 
of Administration and Inter-Faculty Affairs» 

b. ) It might profitably become affiliated with 
such groups as NFGUS, 

c. ) It could be given full responsibility for all 
publicity connected with financial aid for students, 
including the establishing of adequate channels for 
informing students, parents, and the public of the 
situation with respect to available and needed 
financial assistance, 

d. ) It could act as a liaison group between the 
donors and the recipients of aid, and eligibility and 
avrards committees. 

e. ) It could establish areas in which aid was 
required, and initiate research into the adequacy of 
any given form of aid. ' 

f. ) It could organize and direct campaigns for 
obtaining increased financial aid from business and 
industry, service clubs, foundations, and fraternal 




106 


and professional organizations* 

g. ) It could be responsible for the distribution 
of financial aid to students* 

h. ) It could set up and administer memorial and 
revolving fund awards* 

i. ) It could serve as a clearing-house for all 
matters relating to the financial problems of 
university students* 

The discussion of the distribution of scholar¬ 
ships ,fellowships and bursaries in Chapter III establish 
ed the fact that seldom did any student in education win 
an award that v/as open for competition to a large part 
or all of the university student population* Education 
students should be encouraged to apply for these scholar 
ships. The Faculty of Education would appear to be 
justified in using its prestige and influence to try to 
obtain for its superior students a fairer proportion of 
awards which are unrestricted as to the required field 
of study. 


Student enrollments in the School of Graduate 
Studies. The preponderance of students registered in 
the School of Graduate Studies at the University of 
Alberta is male. The percentage of each sex for the 
years 1951 to 1957, by faculties, as shovm in Table VIII 
on page 47, is: Agriculture -- male 99/^, female 1^;

female 19%; Engineering — male 100^, female 0^; 
Science -- male 95%, female 5>%>\ Totals -- male SS%y 
female 12^. Registrations in the summer sessions for 
the years 1953 to 1955 (Table X, on page 50), show 
much the sam.e pattern, the male registrations totalling 
S0% and the female registrations 20^5. 

As noted on page 79, from ^l%o to 9k% of the 
graduates enrolled at this University in the Sciences 
in the years 1953 to 1957 took their courses during the 
winter sessions* In Education the corresponding per¬ 
centages were from 31% to. 11%^ Figures from Table XX, 
on page 7^, indicate that during the years 1953 to 
1957, ^1% of the Science students took courses towards 
an M. Sc. degree by full time intramural study and 19^ 
by part time study. In Education there were 2%o of the 
M. Ed. students registered for full time intramural 
study and 9^%o for part time courses* 

A report to the University of Alberta Senate 
listed the following principles as applying to the 
Graduate School 


'Ko B. Newbound, ^^Financial Aid to Graduate 
Students.’^ (Report to the Senate, University of 
Alberta, Edmonton, February, 1956), pp. 24”25. 






(1) The existence of a graduate school active in 
all aspects of University endeavor is essential 

to the proper grovjth and well-being of the instit¬ 
ution. 

(2) The research done by graduate students is 
valuable for its own sake. 

(3) Teaching and other academic employment are 
beneficial to both student and University in 
many spheres. 

(4) The capable graduate student should be free 
from financial worries. He should be at least 
reimbursed to the extent of his basic out-of- 
pocket expenses. 

(5) It is desirable to ensure that the best 
students who have the abilities and talent for 
research should be encouraged to pursue further 
studies here or elsewhere. 

(6) The University should encourage graduates 
of other institutions to pursue graduate studies 
here, as our graduates are encouraged to go 
elsewhere• 


The evidence indicates that in the Faculty 
of Education most of the students are males, who 
teach during the day and do their graduate studying 
in the evenings or during summ.er vacations. A large 
proportion of them is married. Teaching and other 
academic employment at the University, as suggested 
in the third principle above, have been impossible 
for these students while studying for the M, Ed. 
degree. Neither have they been free from financial 
worries, since scholarships and similar aid that are 
offered are not available to any but full time intra¬ 
mural students. The financial burdens imposed upon 
students attempting to do advanced studying by part 
time methods and the lack of adequate scholarships

for intramural study have served to exclude many of the 
most able and talented from the Graduate School. With¬ 
out minimizing the need for part time winter sessions 
and summer sessions to enable graduate vStudents to 
qualify for higher degrees, the University badly needs 
to find ways to induce more of these students to enter 
full time intramural study. 

Financial assistance for graduate students 
Table XI, on page 51, lists a total of nine scholar¬ 
ships over a period of five years that were not 
awarded in the School of Graduate Studies, Eight of 
these were science scholarships, and one, the 
Stapells Graduate Scholarship, might have been av/ard- 
ed in Education. The lack of candidates evident in 
the unav/arded science scholarships does not seem to 
hold true to the same extent in respect to scholar¬ 
ships open to education students. 

At the University of Alberta not more than 
three of the scholarships listed by the School of 
Graduate Studies are available to education students 
in com.petition with students in the School from other 
faculties. It is estimated that about 10% of the 
total aid at Alberta goes to those doing graduate

work in all faculties. ' Anothor estimate places the 
total aid under University control at this level, in 
all faculties, at approximately $11,000 for a total of 
nineteen students.^^ 


A well-known financial expert, in discussing 
the deterioration in the value of teaching salaries 
over the past fifty years, and the effects of this 
deterioration, said:^^^ 

The graduate schools do not have students in the 
numbers and the quality that are desirable, and in 
the academic subjects, scholarships and fellowships 
are required to lure them in. No such subsidy is 
required to fill professional schools of medicine 
and law, and in these schools there is the necessity 
of selective admission so that the quality of the 
professions is likely to be maintaineda 


The best evidence available respecting a 
program of financial aid to graduate students in 
education is that contained in the Harvard Committee 
reporta^^ The report indicated that out of a total

Government of the Province of Quebec, gave 12,077 

bursaries for higher education, totalling $2,41^,73^« 

These bursaries were given in eight different depart- 
1^ 

ments. The number that was given for actual graduate 
work is not indicated. 


Not only must the number of scholarships avail¬ 
able for graduate study in education be increased, but 
so also must the amount of each award. The report for 
Alberta noted that:^^ 

A married teacher with perhaps a family cannot 
be expected to give up a year’s salary to engage 
in academic pursuits which do not provide suffic¬ 
ient to clear expenses. Teaching fellowships in 
amounts of $2500 to $3000 awarded to teachers of 
a minimum of three years of experience maght be 
expected to prove attractive in some cases. 


It is encouraging to see, as this study is 
being concluded, that much progress has already been, 
made towards the goals just quoted. The financial aid 
recently received by the Faculty of Education from the 
¥. K, Kellogg Foundation has permitted the Faculty t

The following recommendations are offered in the 
hope that from them plans may he developed that will 
(1) ease the financial burdens of students who have the 
ability and the desire to do effective graduate work, 
but lack the financial means to do so, (2) make more 
effective the present and future use of financial aid to 
graduate students, and (3) make possible an increase in 
the number of capable students doing graduate work, to 
the benefit of the students, the University, and the 
nation.

Recommendations for Increasing the Amount of Financial 

Aid to Graduate Students in Education, 

1* The campaign to obtain more government aid 
for higher education should continue unabated* Any 
increased aid obtained for students at the matriculation 
and undergraduate levels would permit the channelling 
of some of the present aid into assistance for graduate 
students. 

2. The Faculty of Education has an obligation 
to encourage and assist education students to apply for 
more of the financial awards offered in ’hinrestricted^^ 
areas of study. 

3. Increases should be sought in the amounts 
of some of the present awards, to the point where they 
V7ill meet the expenses of students having family 
obligations, and induce more of them to enter the 
Graduate School, 

Increased departmental budgets should be 
sought to permit the granting of more assistantships 
and similar academic employment of graduate students. 

The ^'paid-internship'^ idea can be exploited to the 
advantage of both the Graduate School and the students, 
5o Donors presently offering financial 
assistance in restricted areas might be approached with 
a view to broadening the acceptable areas of study, so 







117 


that unused awards might be utilized. 

6. There is a vast reserve of financial 
assistance in Canadian business and industry, service 
clubs, individual bequests and memorials, and fraternal 
and professional organizations-. Some of this reserve 
could be made available in Alberta by a carefully 
organized student aid campaign. 

Recommendations Intended to Secure More Effective Use 

of Present and Future Financial Aid to Students . 

1. This University, working through the 
NCGU, might seek to achieve greater uniformity in the 
descriptions in the university calendars of financial 
aid to students. 

2. Using the present avenues of communication 
and publication, an increased campaign of publicity is 
needed, to make the public aware of both the need for 
financial assistance for students and the opportunities 
already existing for financial aid. 

3o Every available source of financial aid 
to students -- scholarships, fellowships, bursaries, 
loans, assistant ships, grants-in-aid, research grants, 
emergency funds, and paid leaves of absence -= should 
be publicized where present, future and potential 
students will become aware of the extent of the assist^ 
ance. Plans for graduate v/ork must be made far in 







118 


advance of enrollments, dates* 

4* Posters containing lists of titles and 
amounts of the available aid could be inexpensively 
printed and \\ddely distributed. 

5. A separate calendar of financial awards 
to students is recommended for consideration, 

6. Exact information should be widely 
circulated relative to the conditions to be met for 
and the amount of aid available through grants from 
the Alberta Advisory Committee on Educational 
Research. 

7. Valuable publicity respiecting the 
activities and the needs of the new graduate program 
in education could be obtained through periodic news 
letter releases. 

8. A ^^Student Aid Committeeat the. University 
of Alberta, under an administrative dean or director, 
could be responsible for a full program of organization, 
publicity, collection and disbursement of student aid. 

Recommendations for Increasing the Numbers of Students 

Doing Graduate Work in Education at the University of 

Alberta . 

1. The University should encourage and assist 
the campaign to obtain more paid leaves of absence for 
persons to do advanced educational work. This plan

offers the greatest hope of assisting the teacher in 
field to commence or to continue with graduate study® 
2. Perhaps the time has come for the 
commencement of a modest program of financial assist¬ 
ance to graduate students enrolled in summer sessions 
or part time courses* 

3* Candidates for a doctoral degree might 
be offered simmer assistantships to help shorten the 
intramural time required at the University* 

4o The Graduate School needs to sell its 
degree program to students of ability in terms of 
better placem-ent with higher salaries in school 
systems, and in terms of positions of increased 
responsibilities with higher financial returns. 

5* Teachers* organizations should work for 
a higher salary differential for graduate degrees, 
since there is very little m.onetary gain from any 
degree beyond the bachelor’s in today’s schedules®

PAET A 


INTRODUCTION 



PART A. INTRODUCTION 


The report of the First Canadian Conference of Deans of 
Education and Professors of Educational Administration and Supervision, 
i955? indicated three needs arising from the conference (l): 

1. A need for a comparative study of programs and offerings 
in education at Canadian degree-granting institutions, 
with special reference to administration and supervision. 

2. A need for the development at one or more Canadian 
universities of a centre for advanced graduate studies 
specifically in the field of educational administration and 
supervision. 

3. A need for greater financial aid for graduate students in 
educational administration and supervision. 

As a preparatory step towards obtaining greater financial aid 
for graduate students in education it became necessary to survey the 
present situation with respect to aid already available at the Canadian 
universities. There was a need for a single compilation of the kinds 
and amounts of available aid in the form of scholarships, fellowships, 
bursaries, loans, assistantships, special grants, and paid leaves of ab¬ 
sence . 

A study intended to gather the desired information has been 
sponsored by the Alberta Advisory Committee on Educational Research. 

This report contains the findings of the study. It is hoped that it will 
provide a basis for discussion at the conference, and for subsequent 
action towards the provision of more financial aid in education at the 
graduate level. 


1. COLLECTION OF DATA 

The collection of the data contained herein was made by; 

1. A survey of the calendars of those Canadian universities 
offering degree programs in education. 

2. A questionnaire to each Dean of Education in Canada regarding 
aid given in the form of assistantships, grants=in-aid, and 
special grants. 

3. Letters to the Department of Education in each of the ten 
provinces respecting aid given to employees and to graduates 
in education generally.

2. LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY 


Fields of study . At a number of universities, teachers or 
others about to become teachers, usually hold a B.A. degree or its 
equivalent before proceeding to the B.Ed. degree or to graduate work in 
education. Such persons might conceivably study in a wide variety of 
fields. In order to limit the fields of study in those areas not 
specifically designated as for education, awards have been included only 
in those special fields that are usually taught in the senior high schools 
These include Languages such as English, French, German, and Latin; and 
Humanities such as Art, History, Music, Literature, and Philosophy (3). 

In defining the fields of study that might be considered as open 
to students in education, most foreign languages. Classics, Social Work, 
Business courses, most of the Social Sciences, and most of the Natural 
Sciences have been excluded. ^ It was felt that subjects of a specialized 
or technical nature require specialized training, and that students in 
them seldom enter the teaching field. 

Financial limits . As it is felt that financial aid has to be 
fairly substantial in order to attract students into full-time graduate 
schools, awards of less than $100 have been omitted. 

Bachelor of Education degree . In a number of Canadian univer¬ 
sities the B. Ed. is considered a graduate degree. At all universities 
where the B. Ed. is awarded students may enroll for it after obtaining 
a degree such as the B. A. In order to obtain uniformity in this report, 
where a prior degree is listed as a requisite, students taking courses 
leading to a B. Ed. have been classified as doing graduate work. It is 
noted, however, that in most universities a "graduate" student must be 
registered in the Graduate School. 


^ 3. DEFINITION OF TERMS 


In this report the terms listed below have the following 
meanings: 

1. Fellowship (4) - A grant made for postgraduate study or research, 
and based upon ability. 





4 


2. Scholarship - A grant made to undergraduates or graduates and 

based upon academic standing. Financial need usually has no 
hearing on the awarding of a scholarship, but it may influence 
the amount of money awarded. 

3. Bursary "• A grant made to a needy student who has a reasonably 

good academic standing. The size of the bursary usually varies 
with the established need of the student. Bursaries frequently 
entail duties to be performed for the university. 

k. Loans - Loans are usually made to needy students from limited 
funds. Preferences usually are given to senior students for 
the completion of degree programs. A satisfactory academic 
standing is a requisite. Terms of repayment vary. 

5. Leaves of Absence = A leave of absence is defined here as leave 

from the usual employment that might be used for graduate 
educational study, and for which the employer gives full salary 
or some other payment. Short term leave up to six weeks would 
probably permit the employee to attend summer school courses. 
Long term leaves usually permit normal intramural university 
study. 

6. Assistantship (5) ■” An assistantship is payment for services 

rendered in some university department. Research assistant- 
ships are ordinarily granted for work on research projects 
being conducted by members of a department.
