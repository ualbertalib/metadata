CHAPTER I 


INTRODUCTION 

The Situation 

"The Home - the Basic Institution of Society* 1 - was the 
challenging theme chosen for the fifth conference of the 
Canadian Home Economics Association which was held in Calgary 
in August 1948* The theme was a timely one, expressing the 
opinion of thoughtful educators and statesmen throughout the 
land* 

The growing realization of the importance of the home 
in the modern world has through the years modified the aims 
and objectives of school curricula related to homemaking 
activities* Today’s homemake" must of necessity possess many 
skills* She must b© something of an economist, something of 
a scientist, something of an artist* Above all she must have 
an appreciation of human relationships* In the continuously 
and rapidly shifting scenes of our modern world, the 
individual feels a need for something permanent* As the 
physical aspects of our homes are modified we become more 
aware of the need to discover the human factors that make for 
good homes* 

The common objective in all brandies of the subject- 
matter field of home economics must be to determine how each 
can contribute to strengthening the homes of our land and 
how the school can assist the home to become a more stabilizing

influence in our social scheme* 

Home economics in the school program is directed towards 
increasing satisfactions in personal and family living and 
in raising the level of family life. While this is the main 
objective of all home economics education* the high school 
program in home economics also offers specific preparation 
for certain types of remunerative employment* 

Modifications in home economics curricula have come 
about largely through changes in the social situation on the 
one hand and through the acquisition of new knowledge and new 
experiences on the other* 

The Problem. 

To what extent is home economics education directed 
towards strengthening Canadian homes and more particularly 
Alberta homes? 

The Present Study* 

The purpose of the present study is to consider the 
home economics situation in the intermediate and high schools 
in Alberta and elsewhere with a view to examining the aims 
and objectives of the courses offered and the procedures 
employed in achieving them* 

The procedure will be to examine the periodical 
literature on home economics education* to consult the courses 
of study in home economics in the various provinces* to 
consult the files of the Department of Education of the

CHAPTER II 


THE HISTORY OP HOME ECONOMICS EDUCATION 


While the science of home economics has a history of 
not more than seventy or eighty years, homemaking is as old 
as the family itself. The education of girls, since 
earliest primitive times, has never for any appreciable period 
neglected training for home mangement and family living. 

The early idea, however, was that these things were merely 
matters of skill and practice, best learned at home, and of 
no direct concern to any save housekeepers and their helpers. 
The need for formal education for home life was not general¬ 
ly recognized, though Xenophon, in the Oeconomicus , recorded 
a discussion in which Socrates approved of instruction 
being given to girls in the management of the household. In 
outlining the duties of a wife as suggested by her farmer 
husband, he put these words into the farmer*s mouth: 

TI I am paying into the common stock all that I have, 
and you have put in all that you brought with you 
and we are not to reckon up which of us has contri¬ 
buted the greater amount, but we should know of a 
surety that the one who proves the better partner 
makes the more valuable contribution. 

"Your duty will be to remain indoors and send 
out those servants whose work is outside and 
superintend those who are to work indoors, and t© 
receive the incomings, and distribute as much as 
must be spent, and watch over as much as is to be 
kept in store, and take care that the sum laid by 
for a year be not spent in a month. And when wool 
is brought to you, you must see that cloaks are 
made for those that want them. You must see, too, 
that the dry corn is in condition for making food.

f, Let us choose the place that each portion should 
occupy. How good it is to keep one f s stock of utensils 
in order, and how easy to find a suitable place in a 
house to put each in. Hoy* beautiful it is to see 
cloaks of all sorts and conditions kept separate, or 
blankets, or brazen vessels, or table furniture* 

"In appointing the housekeeper, we chose th© 
woman whom, on consideration, we judged to be the most 
temperate and who seemed to have the best memory, to 
be most careful not to offend us by neglecting her 
duties. We also taught her to be loyal to us by 
making her a partner in all our joys and calling on 
her to share our troubles. Moreover we trained her 
to be eager for the improvement of our estate, by 
making her familiar with it and by allowing her to 
share in our success.”^ 

It will be noted that many of Socrates comments are applic¬ 
able to the well-run home of today* 


In the United States. 

The nineteenth century marked the beginning of formal 

home economies training on this continent. In 1822, 

Catharine E. Beecher established a private school for girls 

where she taught "domestic economy". Then came Mrs. Mary 

Hemenway, who succeeded in 1863 in having cooking and sewing 

taught in one of the public schools in Boston. Nine years 

later, the legislature of Massachusetts passed an act which 

provided for sewing and other industrial education in th© 

2 

public schools of the state* The movement to include 
sewing and cooking in the public school curriculum spread

rapidly throughout the Eastern States in the next two decades* 
Courses at college level were offered in the early 1870*s at 
the University of Illinois and at Iowa State and Kansas 
Agricultural Colleges. 

Considerable impetus was given to the movement by the 
World f s Fair at Chicago in 1893. As a result of the Woman’s 
Congress of the Chicago Exposition* the National Household 
Economics Association was formed. For ten years this 
association worked in promotion of efforts to raise the 
standard of living. It then merged with the Committee on 
Household Economics of the General and State Federation of 
Women*s Clubs since the aims and objectives of the Association 
had become incorporated in the interests of the General and 
State Federation of Women*s Clubs.^ Also at the Chicago 
Fair, the Rumford Kitchen was exhibited. This was the 
workingman’s home, which was planned and supervised by Mrs. 
Ellen Richards. In this exhibit she tried to show how a 
family could live on $500 a year. In connection with the 
demonstration home a series of pamphlets related to foods 
and nutrition was prepared by leading authorities in scientific 
fields. At this Fair, too, the United States Department of 
Agriculture showed a collection and analysis of foods from 
all over the world. This display stimulated W. 0. Atwater’s 
nutritional investigations which were authorized by Congress

in 1894. 1 

In 1896, the New York State Regents decided to give 
household science a place in the examination for college 
entrance. Melvil Dewey, Director of the New York State 
Library, knew Mrs. Ellen Richards® fame as a crusader in 
the problems of the home and invited her to the Dewey summer 
camp at Lake Placid to talk over the examination. Mrs. 
Richards was glad to have this opportunity to discuss her 
reforms with a leader in th© field of education. The visits 
were repeated and, in 1898, Mr . and Mrs. Dewey invited 
Mrs. Richards to speak on domestic problems before several 
members of the Lake Placid Club. Following this, in 1899, 
the Lake Placid Conference was called. Eleven persons 
attended the first conference. Among them were editors of 
women®s magazines, social workers and outstanding teachers 
and lecturers in the field of home economics® 

At the first Lake Placid Conference the new field of 
higher education was given the name "Horn© Economies u . 

(Home - meaning the place for the shelter and nurture of 
children or the developing of self-sacrificing qualities 
and of strength to meet the world; economics - meaning the 
management of the home on economic lines as to time and 
energy as well as money.) fl It is the economy of human mind 
and force that is most important, and as long as the nurture

of these is best accomplished within the four walls of a 
home, so long will the word home stand first in our title”, 
declared Mrs* RichardsHer purpose in sponsoring an 
organized home economics movement was through education to 
find ways and means to foster all family welfare and prevent 
the disaster of family disintegration. 

The Lake Placid Conference continued for ten years 
with attendance by invitation of Mrs. Richards or Mrs. Dewey. 
During the first five years much time was spent in developing 
courses of study. In the proceedings of the second con¬ 
ference mention is made of several new topics* These included 
vocational and evening schools, extension work and hospital 
dietaries. Delegates from Canada and the United States 
attended this and succeeding conferences. At the third con¬ 
ference, the fifty-four persons present represented public 
schools, colleges, universities, hospitals, magazines, the 
United States Department of Agriculture, women’s clubs, and 
other organizations. With each new year the number attending 
the Lake Placid Conferences increased and the scope of sub¬ 
jects broadened and shifted in emphasis. Such subjects as 
safe food, dietaries for students, protein metabolism, 
nutrition, the dietitian, public health, the school lunch, 
and home economics from a physician’s point of view were 
discussed, but always with the benefit to the family and to

the management of the home as the objective* At the tenth 
conference it was decided to make the organization national 
under the name of the American Home Economics Association. 

The objective of the newly organized association was to 
improve the conditions of living in the home* the 
institutional household and the community.^ 

With the exception of the first conference, Canadian 
delegates were in attendance at all sessions. At four of 
the sessions, reports were given on the progress of home 
economics education in Canadian schools and colleges* 

The Lake Placid Conference gave home economics a start; 
the American Home Economics Association confirmed and added 
strength to its progress and the government provided the 
tools with which to do a better job by means of federal acts. 
With the exception of trades and agriculture, no other form 
of education received the amount of federal aid in the 
United States as was given to home economics. The most 
important acts of congress affecting the growth of home 
economics education are: 

1. The Smith-Lever Act, 1914, which was an appropriation 
for carrying on extension work in home economics and agri¬ 
culture among persons outside the agricultural colleges. 

2. The Smith-Hughes Act, 1917, which provided an

appropriation to promote vocational education in agriculture, 
home economics and the trades, the emphasis in home economics 
being in day and evening schools• 

3. The Parnell Bill, 1925, which provided funds for 
home economics research, a new phase in home economics* 

4. The George-Reed Act, 1929, which was an appropriation 
to expand the development of home economics especially in the 
application of funds to salaries of state supervisors* 

5. The George-Deen Act, 1937, which provided funds for 
adult education in homemaking, trades and agriculture in 
rural and urban communities.^ 

Before the passage of the Smith-Hughes Act there was 
almost no uniformity in the public schools as to terminology 
of home economics courses, the scope of courses offered or 
the number of hours allotted to each course. In some states 
and cities home economics was offered as early as the fifth 
grade and in others not until high school* Many of the 
departments occupied unattractive basement rooms and little 
was accomplished except actual cooking of single products and 
simple sewing. Requirements for teachers varied and it was 
not uncommon for the home economics teacher to be responsible 
for teaching physical education and general science. 

The strong organization of the land grant colleges in 
the north gave home economics greater publicity and provided 
most of the teachers in this field. In the south women were

educated in women’s colleges rather than land grant colleges* 
Each of these colleges worked independently and home 
economics did not receive much attention or publicity* 

In 1911 North Carolina took action toward establishing 
Farm Life Schools in rural sections so that boys and girls 
might be trained in practical work typical of farm living* 

By 1916 there were twenty-one of these schools in which 1382 
girls were enrolled. In the same year the Texas legislature 
provided means for establishing rural high schools with 
agriculture and home economies departments. During the first 
year forty-nine schools were established with nine per cent 
of the teachers graduating from "colleges of high rank". 

By 1912 the State of Virginia had a total of 14,462 girls 
enrolled In domestic science. Louisiana in 1912-13 reported 
approving forty-four departments of domestic science, six of 
which were in New Orleans. A number of southern states - 
Louisiana, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Mississippi and Texas - had 
published courses of study and others showed marked interest 
in the subject*^ 

Statistics given in the Federal Board of Vocational 
Education Bulletin No. 37 (1918) indicated that 3161 or 
twenty-six per cent of the public high schools in 1915-16 
offered home economics programs* By 1921 the number of high 
schools with home economics departments had increased to

mo re than 8000. During the early 20 ! s a practice in many 
states was to allow a student to elect one of four courses - 
home economics, trade, business or liberal arts - and to 
adhere rather rigidly to this program. However, in view of 
the fact that most of the students would eventually become 
home-makers, many schools soon allowed an elective in 
household arts 0 

It was a general practice to require home economics in 
the seventh and eighth grades from the early 1920*3, although 
some schools required the subject In the fifth and sixth 
grades. By this time few states employed teachers with less 
than two years* training. Nine states required a four-year 
course for home economics teachers. The requirements for 
teachers increased until by 1927 all but two states required 
a four year course* 

The subject matter of home economics was greatly 
extended during this period. The course in most states 
included units in child care, family and community relation¬ 
ships and home management as well as cooking and sewing. 

In nearly half of the states the plant and equipment were 
of the home-making cottage type. 

In 1938-39 the United States Office of Education mad® 
a survey of current practices in home economics. A question¬ 
naire was sent to every junior and senior high school in 
the forty-eight states, the District of Columbia, Alaska, 
Hawaii and Puerto Rico. The study covered the number of

of the cases where it was offered in the seventh and eighth 
grades and in fifty-three per cent or less in those schools 
where it was offered in higher grades. Thirty-five per cent 
of the girls graduating from high school had no home economics 
work. 

Home projects and home visits were an important part of 
the program in schools reimbursed from federal vocational 
funds. Courses in clothing and foods were offered as fre¬ 
quently in non-reimbursed as in reimbursed schools. Courses 
in family relations, the home, child development, home 
nursing, consumer buying and home management were not offered 
in quite as many non-reimbursed as reimbursed schools.^ 

In 1940 the government again recognized the value of 
home economics training in the appointment of Dr. Muriel 
Brown to the new position of consultant in family life 
education in the Home Economics Education Service of the 
United States Office of Education. In the same year President 
Franklin D. Roosevelt called the Fourth White House 
Conference whose theme was Children in a Democracy. The 
conference presented home economists with a better basis 
for developing all phases of home and family life« 

When the National Institute on Education and War was 
held in Washington in August of 1942, attention was directed 
toward practical courses in home economics such as nutrition.

sewing, home management and care of the sick* Other topics 
which received consideration were extra curricular activities 
such as the school lunch; student participation in the war 
effort through the Junior Red Cross, Boy Scouts, Girl Guides, 
etc.; a health program; community contributions in connection 
with utilizing available products,promoting salvage, and 
co-operating with defense agencies in combatting juvenile 
delinquency. 

In 1944 this work was extended when the American Home 
Economics Association and the United States Office of 
Education organized student clubs on a national, regional 
and state basis with students holding office in each 
division and an advisory committee helping to direct the 
program. By the following year there were 2,067 of these 
clubs with a total enrolment of 75,639 girls. 

In Canada. 

The formal beginning of homemaking education in Canada 
grew out of the same social needs and demands which had led 
to its establishment in the United States. Its early 
development was greatly Influenced by practices in both the 
United States and Great Britain. 

Early records show that in 1670 Louis XIV gave one 
thousand francs to the sisters of a Montreal convent for 
the purchase of wool and the teaching of knitting and sewing

to Indian girls. It was not, however, until the close of 

the nineteenth century that any real development took place 

in home economics education in Canada. Its rather rapid 

progress at that time was largely the result of the efforts 

of three philanthropists and educationalists - Sir William 

Macdonald, Mrs. Adelaide Hunter Hoodless and Mrs. Lillian 
2 

Massey Treble. 

The enterprise fostered by Sir William Macdonald, a 
wealthy merchant of Montreal, was known in educational 
literature as the Macdonald Movement. It covered many phases 
of education, among them manual training, household science, 
seed-growing and school gardens. Centres for instruction in 
these branches of education were established by Sir William 
Macdonald in many parts of Canada. Funds for their 
maintenance were provided for a three-year period, at the 
end of which the institutions passed into the control of 
the local school system. 

In 1891 Mrs. Hoodless started classes in homemaking in 
connection with the Y. W. C. A. in Hamilton. These classes 
paved the way for the first normal courses for domestic

science teachers and for the introduction of domestic science 
into the elementary school system in 1899. Then she 
interested Sir William Macdonald in providing funds to build 
a home economics centre at Ontario Agricultural College at 
Guelph. In 1903 The Macdonald Institute was opened at 
Guelph and a Normal course in Domestic Science was offered. 

A course in homemaking for girls and young women was 
set up by Mrs. Treble at Victor Mission in Toronto. The 
curriculum was expanded in 1901 to provide a two-year normal 
course. In the following year the Household Science 
Department of the University of Toronto was established. 

This expansion was largely a result of Mrs. Treble*s 
enthusiasm and generosity. Here the first degree course In 
household science In Canada was offered. In 1908 Mrs. Treble 
donated a new building to house the department. 

With the division of Canada into provinces, the pro¬ 
vision of educational facilities became a function of each 
provincial government. But before the progress of home 
economics education in the individual provinces is considered, 
two national organizations deserve mention. The first of 
these was the Canadian Dietetics Association which was 
founded at Ottawa in 1936. Its interests centred In 
hospital and institution feeding and management and in 
nutrition and public health. The second was the Canadian 
Home Economics Association which was founded at Winnipeg 
In July, 1939. It is intimately concerned with the

improvement of all aspects of the home and family life® 

In the Maritime provinces an early start was made In 
home economics education. In Nova Scotia, as a result of 
the Macdonald fund, schools for domestic science were 
established about 1899 at Halifax and Truro. The first 
teachers came from the United States and England. In 1900 
a teacher-training course was commenced in connection with 
the provincial normal school and was known as the Truro 
School of Household Science. With the local training of 
teachers, other centres were soon established at Sidney, 
Glace Bay, Windsor, Yarmouth and Lunenburg. A course was 
given in Acadia Seminary at Wolfville in 1902. This later 
developed into a two-year course, and In 1925, through the 
co-operation between the seminary and Acadia University, a 
course leading to the degree of Bachelor of Science in 
Household Science was established with Miss Prances McNally 
as director. By 1905 a course was given in twelve schools 
in the province with 1600 pupils enrolled. The Department 
of Education prescribed the equipment, course of studies and 
teacher qualifications, and paid a grant of up to $600 per 
year to each centre. The integrated plan of teaching home¬ 
making is used in most of the schools of Nova Scotia today. 
Instruction in home economics is given to girls in Grades 
VI to XI inclusive. A course of studies in homemaking for 
boys is also provided by the Department of Education. An 
attempt is made to provide for all races. Nova Scotia has

many schools for colored children and in these schools home 
economics is taught by a colored teacher who is on circuit 
and uses an equipped station wagon for travelling from place 
to place. There are also two circuits in the French speaking 
area. 

In New Brunswick domestic science began in the public 
schools about 1902. The government paid half the cost of 
installing the centres and provided an annual grant of $50 
to each centre. By 1908 the grant had been increased to 
$200 to the five centres which were then in operation."^ Today 
courses are given in G-rades VTI to XI. The present program 
is based on the interests * needs and abilities of the 
students and employs teacher-parent-community planning. 

The first teacher training in the province was provided at 
Mount Allison College, sackville, through the generosity 
of Mrs. Lillian Massey Treble. The two-year program given 
at that time developed into a four-year degree course in 
1924. 

Prince Edward Island has had very little organized 
home economics work in the schools, although the Macdonald 
fund equipped centres at both Charlottetown and Summerside 
about 1905. Teachers received some training in home

economics in the provincial normal school. Some sewing 
was taught in the country schools and certain of the convent 
schools. With the appointment of a Supervisor of Home 
Economics in July 1948 plans are being laid for an extension 
of the home economics program in the educational system. 

In Quebec there was no early popular demand for home 
economics education in the schools. No government grant 
was paid and no control was exerted. Convent schools pro¬ 
vided courses in sewing, cooking and household management 
in 1882. These courses were taught by nuns trained in Prance, 
‘^he Catholic Committee of the Council of Public Instruction 
Introduced home economics into the curriculum of public and 
normal schools in 1922, but It was not until 1957 that the 
courses were made compulsory. The Division of Home 
Economics, department of Education, Quebec, has now under 
its jurisdiction thirty-two regional secondary schools in 
all parts of the province In which a four-year course is 
given in domestic science, and sixty-one intermediate schools 
in which a two-year course is given.^ 

Home economics has been taught In the public schools of 
Montreal since 1902. Sewing and cooking courses are com¬ 
pulsory in the sixth and seventh grades in the Montreal

schools where there are twenty-two centres serving fifty- 

two schools. In 1932 the Department of Protestant Education 

at Quebec established home economics as an elective subject 

1 

in the secondary schools and gave it matriculation credit. 

Teacher training has been carried on at Macdonald College 

since its establishment in 1906 at Ste. Anne de Bellevue by 

Sir William Macdonald. In the one-, two- and three-year 

courses offered, special attention was given in fitting 

teachersto meet the needs of pupils in the rural a*eas of th© 

province. In 1919, an agreement with McGill University 

res lilted In the establishment of a four-year course leading 

to the degree of Bachelor of Science in Household Science* 

Two of the pioneer workers in home economics at Macdonald 

College were Miss Katharine Fisher, the present director of 

2 

Good Housekeeping Institute, and Miss Bessie PhiIp. 

In Ontario, after the Introduction of home economics 
into the public schools at Hamilton by Mrs. Bloodless in 
1899, the movement spread rapidly. With the aid of the 
Macdonald fund public school centres for the work were 
established at such places as Toronto, Waterloo, Guelph and 
Ottawa. Nine public and high schools were offering courses

in IS04, sixteen schools in 1905, and twenty-three in 1908. 
Since that time the growth has been steady and rapid. Today 
courses are offered in one hundred and fourteen high school 
centres, one hundred and seven vocational centres and one 
hundred and sixty-six intermediate centres. The course is 
now compulsory in the ninth grade and optional in all other 
grades from seven to twelve. 

Many factors contributed to the rapid growth of home 
economics education in Ontario. From the beginning of the 
century, the government provided an annual grant of $200 
plus part of the teacher’s salary and part of the cost of 
the equipment. In 1908 a woman supervisor was appointed to 
contact school boards with the object of encouraging the 
establishment of home economics classes. The course of 
studies and teacher qualification were subject to the 
approval of the Department of Education#^ 

At Belleville School for the Deaf and Dumb, a course 
in home economics has been given to all girls and sane 
boys since 1902. 

Miss Mary Urie Watson directed teacher training at the 
Ontario Agricultural College at Guelph for nearly twenty 
years. She exerted such a tremendous influence through 
her vision, foresight and power of organization that she

became a national figure in home economics work* Her influence 
was felt not only in Canada but in the United States, England 
and other coiintries. She took an active part in many of the 
Lake Placid Conferences and was elected a councillor of the 
American Home Economics Association when it was first 
organized. Teacher training was carried on at the University 
of Toronto also. Here the work was organized under the 
capable leadership of Miss Annie Laird in 1901.^ 

During the First World War, the demand for dietitians 

for military hospitals made rapid expansion of university 

home economics departments essential. Following the war, 

the demand continued to increase for trained dietitians in 

commerical and institutional food service® In 1939 

specialized training was again required for the armed 

services, and colleges adapted the home economics program 

to meet this demand. In 1940 the Government of Ontario set 

up a visiting homemaker service to assist in problems of 

2 

child care, home management and nutrition. 

In Manitoba sewing was introduced into the elementary 
classes of the Winnipeg schools under the direction of Miss 
Halliday in 1903. In the same year Mrs. Lillian Massey 
Treble of Toronto equipped a department of household science

in the University of Manitoba and paid the instructors 
salary for the first year of operation# Miss Lennox 
organized the work but after three years the university 
decided to discontinue it. Miss Lennox then started cookery 
classes in the Alexander School in Winnipeg where a room 
was equipped through the Macdonald fund*"^ These classes 
marked the beginning of organized home economies classes 
in Winnipeg schools© 

Between 1911 and 1921, classes were started at Brandon, 
Dauphin, Verden and Portage la Prairie but no government 
assistance was provided and in 1925 all these classes were 
discontinued because of financial difficulties. In the 
1930’s rapid progress was made in reinstating home economics 
classes# In 1936 Winnipeg operated twelve home economics 
laboratories and twelve household arts centres with a staff 

of thirty-on© teachers and an enrolment of over six thousand 

2 

students* In the Manitoba School for the Deaf, a home 
economics course was instituted in 1917 and has continued 
in operation ever since. 

In the Provincial Agricultural College home economics 
work began with a summer course in 1910* The course was 
rapidly expanded, and in 1915 a Bachelor of Science degree

in Horae Economics was offered. Twenty years later, the 
division of Home Economics had an enrolment of two hundred 
and thirty-five students, the second highest in Canadian 
Universities*^ A three year course is now required for a 
home economics degree* 

The first home economics classes in Saskatchewan were 
started in Regina in 1909 under Miss Joan Hamilton* Miss 
Abbie De Lury established the work in the Moose Jaw schools 
shortly afterward, and soon there were centres in Saskatoon, 
Yorkton, Moosomin and elsewhere* Some of these centres were 
later closed because of economic difficulties* Following 
the depression many of these centres^were re-opened* 

A course in household science was given in the 

Provincial Normal School at Regina in 1908, and in 1917 

home economics work began at the University of Saskatchewan

under the leadership of Mrs* Rutter. This has now become 
a four year course* 

In Alberta the first home economics centre was opened 
in Calgary In 1910. Under the Macdonald fund, a centre 
was equipped in a business block* Later classes were trans¬ 
ferred to permanent quarters in Connaught School* The first 
teachers were Miss Ann Morrison of Ontario and Miss Margaret 
Stewart of New Brunswick. A start was made in Edmonton about

the same time. In 1912 Miss McAdams was appointed super¬ 
visor of household science for the city. Later Miss 
Florence Hallock directed the work. 

At first sewing was taught in Grades V and VI and foods 
and home management in Grades VII and VIII. These classes 
were compulsory. In 1916 the Department of Education 
started a high school course for Grades IX and X. In 1918 
home economics was introduced into the University of Alberta 
and a degree course was offered. The work here was organized 
by Miss Mabel Patrick. 

In 1913 home economics was introduced into the Normal 
Schools In Calgary and Camrose. In Calgary Mrs. Catharine 
Gossip (the former Miss C. T. McCaig) directed the work. 

In Camrose Miss Margaret Stewart was in charge. Courses 
were started in the Edmonton Normal School In 1919 with Miss 
A. Has tie as instructor. Horn© economics was discontinued 
in the normal schools in 1927 as it was thought that the 
classes took too much time and interfered with academic 
work. Part of the course was integrated in the health 
and education program. In 1943 home economics in teacher 
training was revived under the Faculty of Education. 

During the depression, financial stress caused many 
centres to be closed, but since 1940 there has been a rapid 
growth in home economics education. Today courses are 
offered to intermediate and high school students in most

CHAPTER III 


THE AIMS AND OBJECTIVES OF HOME ECONOMICS EDUCATION 

Home economics was introduced into the public schools 
at a time when the emphasis upon industrial arts was strong. 
Its first purpose was the teaching of cooking and needle™ 
work and interest was almost wholly centred upon acquisition 
of these skills. "Reasons why" soon became a part of the 
problem* and science and art were brought into the subject. 
Economics, sociology and psychology have made their contri¬ 
butions to the field and today we find home economies 
education striving towards a composite of understandings* 
attitudes, habits and skills which are needed in home 
living and homemaking. 

The shift away from the manipulative skills as the major 
interest to a wider conception that also includes child 
development, family relationships and the social and 
economic problems of the family has been more rapid in 
Canada and the United States than in European countries. 

Much of the credit for this rapid progress in America?! rests 
upon Mrs. Ellen Richards and the other delegates of the Lake 
Placid Conference. Aims and objectives in home economics 
were discussed in detail at these meetings and the 
Conference recommended that the basic aim should be to teach 
the American people, chiefly through the medium of the 
schools, the management of their homes on economic lines

as to time and energy*” 5 ' Mrs, Richards brought to the con¬ 
ference her clearly defined conception of the ideal home. 

It should be unhampered by the traditions of the past. It 
should utilize all the resources of modern science to 
improve home life. It should be freed from the dominance 
of material things and should focus its attention on ideals. 
The home should express simplicity in material surroundings 

in order to free the spirit for the more important and 

2 

permanent interests of the home and society. The conference 
expressed the opinion that satisfying homes are basic to 
our society and necessary for its development and progress, 
even for its survival. For this reason the conference 
advocated improvement In Instruction in home economics in 
order to develop students in schools and colleges Into 
better family members, better parents and better citizens. 
Thus modern home economics developed out of a concern for 
the betterment of home and family living. 

The content and goals of education have varied from 
time to time but they have always been closely Identified 
with the type of society In which they function. As 
civilization has progress, changes have been reflected in 
the classroom. When homemaking was first introduced into

the schools, life was more rural and simple in its demands 
than at the present time. Fewer books in home economics 
were available and the conventional method of teaching was 
based on memorization and imitation. Many inventions 
affected the home causing drastic changes in family life. 

The processes of baking, canning, laundering and sewing 
have been transferred in many instances from the home to 
commercial concerns. Mechanical products manufactured for 
the home such as electric stoves, vacuum cleaners and 
refrigerators have added to the comforts of living and have 
changed the nature of household labor. While much of the 
drudgery associated with housekeeping is thus reduced, the 
homemaker*s task is not necessarily an easier one. More 
time is required in planning nutritious meals, in budgeting 
the family income, in intelligent buying, in child care 
and training and in other activities related to the home 
and community. Many changes in home economics curricula 
have come about largely through changes in the social 
situation and through the acquisition of new knowledge and 
new experience. Home economics cannot be static because 
it is part and parcel of the changing life of the community. 
Neither can it be standardized because no two communities 
or contingent neighborhoods are uniform in living standards 
and home ideals."*”

Th© aims and objectives of home economics education 

have also borne a close relationship to the major trends in 

secondary education* In 1893 the famous Committee of Ten 

stated that the main function of the high school was ”to 

prepare for the duties of life that small portion of all the 

children in the country - a group small in number but vexy 

important to the welfare of the nation - who show themselves 

able to profit by an education continued to the eighteenth 

year and whose parents are able to support them while they 

remain so long at school®”^ Pupil select!on, intellectual 

and economic, was, marked as a contemporary and approved 

characteristic of the public secondary schools® In 1918 

the Commission on Reorganization of the Secondary Schools 

expressed the new philosophy that was coming Into educational 

thought when they asserted that, ’’Education shall be so 

reorganized that every normal boy and girl will be en- 

2 

couraged to remain in school to the age of eighteen 
Secondary education for all youth has long since become one 
of our educational tenets and continues to move toward full 
realization in fact* Universal secondary education means 
increasingly diversified interests, abilities and needs in 
the student body* Practical courses were welcomed and

encouraged at first by school authorities because they 
constituted a ’’dumping ground” for the rapidly growing 
number of pupils who were unable to grace the academic 
courses* While the practical arts thrived even under the 
stigma of such a policy, teachers in these fields gradually 
made their resentment felt, and it has became rather common 
for home economics teachers today to insist on the 
intellectual respectability of their field and to seek to 
encourage pupils of average and superior intelligence to 
enrol in home economics classes* 

Another trend in modern education has been the downard 
and upward extension of the high school* The process of 
including the junior high school is progressively obliterating 
many traditional distinctions between elementary and 
secondary education* Extension upward is not so marked 
but some progress has been made in the direction of the 
junior college. This extension has greatly increased 
opportunity in the home economics field but has raised 
problems of selection of content and adjustment of method* 

The trend towards auto-control is reflected in the 
procedure of curriculum-making being assumed by specialists 
and teachers in the secondary schools rather than being 
handed down by university authorities. The majority of 
text books are now written by superintendents, principals, 
supervisors, teachers and students of educational method. 

It is possible that home economics in the high school has

neve r been under the control of colleges or that college 
influence, if it has been exerted, has been more than 
usually intelligent and sympathetic. It would be unfortunate 
for high school home economics ever to come under a control 
that would make it solely a preparation for college home 
economics. The problems of the secondary school are only 
in a small way the problems of the college. 

One of the cardinal principles set forth by the 1918 

Commission on the Reorganization of Secondary Schools was 

that in order to determine the main objectives that should 

guide education in a democracy, it is necessary to analyze 

1 

the activities of the individual. The rise of home economics 
in the high school is itself significant of this trend for 
it shows■an explicit recognition of a major category of 
social existence, that of homemaking. Constant watchfulness 
is required here as elsewhere In order that what is taught 
shall have direct and relatively important bearing on the 
contemporary life. Only continuous reference to life as it 
is being lived enables the curriculum-maker to select and 
organize content that Is timely and genuinely functional. 
Flexibility of program and sensitivity to changing social 
usage should be first principles for home economics 
teachers. Social functionalism implies more than the mere

teaching of useful facts and techniques. It implies building 
up attitudes and dispositions that will insure use. Thus 
the teaching of foods and dietary values which does not pro¬ 
duce a distinction between the daily food of those who take 
home economics and those who do not appears to be lacking in 
some essential factor. 

The trend in secondary education to a more comprehensive 
social functionalism has resulted in an effort to make the 
home economics course cover homemaking more and more com¬ 
pletely. Such divisions of the field as family-life relation¬ 
ships, household equipment, time and energy management, 
family economics, foods and nutrition, clothing and textiles, 
and child care, reveal the broad reach of Instruction today. 

The trend toward individualization is effected mainly 
through curriculum adjustment to meet individual needs. A 
plan frequently employed by home economists for providing 
individualization is the development above the first or 
basic courses of many types of short or special units from 
which pupils can make choices. To meet the needs in other 
communities, emphasis is placed upon teacher-pupil-parent 
planning of units of work. 

The trend toward curriculum Integration in the high 
school is reflected in the tendency to organize courses into 
a pattern of correlated subjects or a cor© program centred 
around an area of living. In home economics there is an

integrating centre which is concrete and obvious, namely, 
the home • 

The trend toward emphasis on the higher mental processes 
is a reaction against memorizing and reveals a growing 
concern for reasoning and critical thinking. Problem-solving 
is and should be an important aspect of the home economics 
curriculum. Units of work are frequently set up as problems 
to be solved on the basis of individual or group activity. 

Finally the trend toward activism leads to the setting 
up of activities which would either facilitate stipulated 
learnings or which would be intrinsically educative. 

Activism has always been highly characteristic of the home 
economics program. 

In the general education program the controlling purpose 
of home economics has been the development of intelligent- 
insights and desirable attitudes toward personal living as 
involved in problems of food, clothing and home life, and 
the teaching of such skills as may be needed by girls and 
women. It seeks to encourage the formation of right habits 
in the use of food and clothing for health, to develop a 
basis for wise choices in purchasing home equipment and 
furnishings, and to promote desirable attitudes, habits and 
abilities in homemaking and home living. 

In vocational education the controlling purpose is the 
preparation of students for useful employment in occupations 
related to the home.

Both aim to develop right attitudes toward the home and 
its work# Both aim to teach essential facts in relation to 
the activities of the home# Both aim to develop good habits 
of thinking and of planning. Both aim to teach essential 
skills and managerial ability in the conduct of the home# 

Both types of home economics have introduced into the school 
program education in child care and development and in 
family relationships adapted to the period of secondary 
education# In both general and vocational courses the 
emphasis is upon home economics for immediate as well as 
future personal use. Popular topics here are the girl f s 
clothing and food, her personal budget, and the furnishing 
and care of her bedroom# The difference between the general 
and vocational programs is one of emphasis and intensity due 
to different time allottments, rather than to any fundamental 
difference in aim, content or method of instruction# 

"The change in home economics education from the ? old f 
to the ®new ! may be characterized as a shift from doing and 
production as an end to doing and production as a means to 
an end f^ Thus under the old curriculum a girl might spend a 
term making a graduation dress or she might spend a series 
of ten lessons in the food laboratory on batters and doughs#

The new curriculum recognizes the fact that today a girl f s 
clothing needs are comprised of intelligent selection of 
her wardrobe, its care, her share in the family budget, the 
selection of accessories needed for the ensemble and the 
construction of some simple garments. Again, when baked 
products are often purchases rather than baked at home, 
the girl*s needs are not met by a sequential series of the 
detailed processes involved in their production and the 
skills required to make them. 

The making of a dress and the preparation of batters 
and doughs may and probably will be found in the modern home 
economics program but the process of making the dress will 
be enriched by a study of the clothing needs of the girl, 
the cost and care of her garments, and the selection of 
clothing in terms of suitability of design, color and 
fabric. The process of making bread may be included as 
one step in the preparation and serving of a meal, as a 
means of demonstrating the action of yeast as a leavening 
agent or as an aid in acquiring standards for judging 
bakery products. In other words, except In intensive 
courses in clothing and foods which are primarily designed 
to develop skills, home economics utilizes practical 
activities as experience through which knowledge, 
appreciations and standards for judging products are 
established. 

This changing emphasis in homemaking grew out of the

current demand for education in the intelligent consumption 
of commodities as well as in their production. Although the 
practical activities are still essential to homemaking, less 
actual sewing and cooking are carried on in the homes of many 
communities while the selection of food and clothing for the 
family looms large in the daily routine. The change in 
emphasis from production to consumption varies with the 
community and gives added significance to the need for 
teacher-pupil-parent planning of the home economics 
curriculum® 

The appalling increase in the divorce rate points to 
the fact that more than housekeeping activities should be 
included in a program of education which seeks to stabilize 
the home.' Family living depends upon personal interrelation¬ 
ships as well as upon the material needs of life. So acute 
has concern for the welfare of the home become, that, in the 
application of modern educational philosophy, much that was 
once in the field of home economics has now become the 
property of the curriculum as a whole. Thus health 
education frequently includes work in nutrition, child care, 
and personal, home and family hygiene. Units in the us® 
of personal and family incomes, family relationships and 
vocational guidance are included in social science courses® 

In art, dress design and interior decorating are important 
sections of the programs generally offered.

Related activities are frequently utilized as a means 
of vitalizing the home economics program. The responsibility 
for the school lunch room, the health education program, and 
such aspects of the social activities of the school as 
party refreshments are frequently assigned to home economics 
classes. It is essential at all times in using related 
activities as a means of vitalizing home economics to 
evaluate them in terms of actual worth to the girls in the 
classes. The service rendered may be highly desirable, but 
it can be justified as part of the home economics program 
only on a basis of its educative value to the girls them- 
selves• 

Among junior high school students, home economics finds 
its best opportunity to contribute to education. One of the 
reasons for this is that home economics is often a required 
subject during these years and consequently reaches large 
numbers of students. The curriculum can be more flexible 
as college entrance requirements have not yet begun to 
control it. Students of this age are usually interested in 
activities connected with foods and clothing, with their 
personal appearance and with certain aspects of the home. 

The purpose of home economics in the intermediate school 
is to teach students the fundamental facts connected with 
foods and clothing both for personal use and for the family 
and to develop in them an appreciation of their present 
share in homemaking and home living. Among the specific

objectives to be sought are: (1) to appreciate that nutrition 
is a definite factor of health, (2) to inculcate proper 
food habits, (3) to develop an appreciation of what is meant 
by a well-dressed person, (4) to acquire good habits of 
buying, (5) to acquire such information about foods, clothing 
and the home as may be reasonably expected to be within the 
comprehension of girls of this age level, (6) to develop 
skills and habits of workmanship and control of tools com¬ 
mensurate with the age and ability of the girls, (7) to 
develop habits of observation and self-criticism as a basis 
of judgment for the selection of food and clothing, (8) to 
stimulate an interest in the care of children through some 
elementary knowledge concerning them, (9) to suggest and 
direct ways of us ing leisure time, (ID) to arouse an interest 
in the furnishings of the home, and (11) to give the girl 
an appreciation of her relationship to the family as a 
whole* 

In the senior high school home economics has fared 
less well than in the intermediate school. The main function 
is to learn to contribute to worthy home membership* Some 
specific objectives are the development of (1) good health 
habits and attitudes, (2) right attitudes toward home and 
family life, (3) knowledge of processes carried on in the 
home, (4) a degree of skill in household activities 
commensurate with the present needs of the individual,

society, (6) ability to save and spend the family income or 
individual earnings efficiently and intelligently, (7) 
ability and inclination to participate in different types 
of enjoyable and fruitful spare time activities• 

Home economics education today is not so much a subject 
as a way of life. The courses given include a wide area of 
learning. While the accomplishment of skills is of importance, 
the greater emphasis is put upon the girl herself. By means 
of her acquired skills she is able to direct her own 
activities, to evaluate her own results, to work in co¬ 
operation with her group, to be a gracious, cheerful worker 
and to take responsibility for the job she starts. Home 
economics is directed to helping her become a valued member 
of her family. 





CHAPTER IV 


AN ANALYSIS OF HOME ECONOMICS EDUCATION 
IN CANADIAN PROVINCES 

It has been shown that while there are many specific 
objectives in home economics education its basic purpose is 
the strengthening of the home. The present chapter will 
present a brief survey of courses of study in each of the 
Canadian provinces. The purpose will be to show to what 
extent the aims and objectives outlined in the course for 
each province agree with the aims expressed by leading 
educators as set forth in the preceding chapter. While 
the survey will deal mainly with aims and objectives, some 
attention will be given to time allotment, types of courses, 
credit value of courses and the grades in which home economies 
education is given. 

The attention of the reader is directed to Appendix Is 
Sample Pages from Courses of Studies. 

New Brunswick 

'’Homemaking education has as its ultimate large 
objective the improvement of personal living and of home 
and family life through providing an opportunity for youth 
and adults to study the vocation of homemaking. 

’’The homemaking curriculum is based upon such immediate 
objectives and activities as will provide training to enable 


the student to:

(a) Benefit from the opportunities for self development 
which a course dealing with personal and social problems can 
give. 

(b) Formulate desirable ideals and standards in regard 
to personal living, and home and family life* 

(c) Appreciate the worthwhile functions of the home* 

(d) Learn the pleasure which can come from tasks well 
done for the welfare of family members* 

(e) Understand the contributions of science, social 
science and art to solving the problems of personal living 
and of home and family.”^ 

Home economics is taught in grades seven to twelve 
inclusive. The course is divided into sections for each 
grade on .food, clothing and home care and management. Each 
section is divided into a number of units of activity which 
are specifically stated. The outline for each unit includes 
teaching instructions and a list of reference material. 

While a definite program is set forth, teachers are en¬ 
couraged to modify it to meet the needs of the students 
and the community. 

Nova Scotia 

Courses in home economics are offered in grades six to 
eleven.

Th© general objectives in grades six to nine are to 
develop a consciousness and interest in the problem of home 
living as they affect girls at this age level and to help 
pupils to become worthy home members. In the tenth and 
eleventh grades the main purpose is to establish high 
standards for personal and family life by: 

"(a) developing attitudes which will ensure happy 
family relations. 

(b) introducing good management of money, time, routine 
and leisure. 

(c) teaching how to select, prepare and serve adequate 
family meals. 

(d) inculcating the need for family members to share in 
and enjoy work and social activities® 

(e) developing habits of good taste In purchasing 

1 

clothing”. 

The course of studies states definitely the projects 
to be covered In each year, together with the lesson content, 
student activities and reading assignments for each. In all 
grades home projects are highly recommended as a method of 
teaching.

& very limited extent in Prince Edward Island. Over eighty- 
five per cent of the schools are rural, one-department 
institutions giving instruction from Grades I to X 
inclusive and consequently are unable to carry a program 
in home economics. In the past instruction in home economics 
has been given only in two schools of Charlottetown and 
certain of the convent schools. With the appointment of a 
supervisor of home economics in July, 1948, plans are being 
laid for an extension of the home economics program in the 
educational system which, until properly organized, will be 
largely limited to short courses at the central Vocational 
School in Charlottetown. 

Quebec 

In the elementary schools a course In household science 
Is given in Grades VI and VII. It is felt that a course in 
these grades Is desirable from both practical and educational 
standpoints. As family members and future homemakers, girls 
of this age should be given training and experience in the 
fundamental activities of the home. 

The objectives are; 

"(a) to help the student to realize the importance of 
the formation of habits of good grooming and of caring for 
clothing. 

(b) to help the student to develop skill in the stitches 
fundamental to simple constructive processes.

rules of nutrition and to encourage the establishment of 
good food habits, 

(d) to help the student to become familiar with tools 
used in cookery and to develop the ability to prepare 
simple dishes." 

The time allotment is one and one-half hours per week,^ 

In the secondary schools home economics is offered in 
Grades VIII to XI. In these grades the objectives are the 
same as those for the elementary school. Here the time 
allotment is two hours a week, to be divided into one period 
of forty minutes for lecture-discussion work and one period 
of eighty minutes for laboratory work. The course includes 
work in foods and nutrition, textiles and clothing, laundry, 
home management, home nursing, personal appearance and 
social relations and deportment. While suggested topics 
are provided in each section, it is recommended that all 

2 

courses should be adapted to the needs of the community.

optional subject with a time allotment of three hours a week. 
Its chief educational value is the development of a girl’s 
natural interest in her home, together with the cultivation 
of desirable attitudes towards the privileges, duties and 
responsibilities of life in the home* Scarcely less important 
is the training in proper habits relative to personal 
appearance, care of belongings and conservation of health* 
Training in good taste in clothing and home furnishings is 
a further objective*^ 

In the high school home economics is required in Grade 
IX and is optional In Grades X, XI and XII* The general 
objectives are: 

(a) to develop In pupils sound standards of living and 
an appreciation of the value of personal and social develop¬ 
ment* 

(b) to develop in pupils good judgment and the power of 
critical and creative thought as applied to their immediate 
problems« 

(c) to give pupils insight into and appreciation of the 
functions, values and Ideals of normal family life in a 
changing society* The course should develop in the pupil 

a conception of homemaking as an undertaking in vfoieh all 
members of the family co-operate*

(d) to give pupils a working knowledge of procedures 
and an opportunity to participate in activities related to 
personal problems and management of the home#^ 

For Grade IX the theme is The Girl and Her Home# It 
is divided into units on personal appearance and department, 
clothing, crafts, the background of Canadian home life, 
home responsibilities, nutrition and health, and meal 
management. The Grad© X theme is The Girl and her Family# 
Here the units are family relationships, clothing, crafts, 
care of the home, care of the pre-school child, and family 
meals. The Girl, her Home and Friends is the topic in 
Grade XI. It is divided into social relationships, textile 
arts, planning and operating the home, home care of the sick, 
care of the infant, nutrition and food and entertainment. 

The Grade XII theme is The Girl and the Community. Its sub¬ 
divisions are ccmmunity relationships, textile arts, consumer 

2 

education, home mechanics, and goods and nutrition# 

It is suggested that the program should be arranged to 
meet the needs of the pupils and to co-ordinate the 
curricular and extra-curricular activities of the school 
and the community.

"The Home Economics course in the elementary schools 
should be the centre for the home-life education for both 
boys and girls. It should in every possible way be 
correlated with the pupil ? s home life and also with the 
related subjects on the curriculum such as art, health, 
science, manual training and mathematics. The aim should be 
to develop independence, responsibility, satisfaction and 
pride regarding homemaking tasks, and the understanding and 
skills that will make for better home living. Situations and 
procedures should be such as represent the home situation in

The primary purpose of home economics in the intermediate 
curriculum is the achieving of a satisfying and functioning 
philosophy of life with emphasis on personal and family 
living. The general objectives of the course are the 
development of attitudes, understandings, appreciations, and 
basic skills in all the functions of homemaking. 

The recommended time allotment is one-half day per 
week. The integrated homemaking method of instruction is 
employed. The home economics laboratory is looked upon as 
a home centre. Here pupils work as a family group. Their 
learning is functional because It is accomplished in a 
realistic environment. The home-centre plan provides not

wide ly recommended, it receives special emphasis in the course 
outlines for New Brunswick and Quebec. The immediate needs 
and activities of students are recognized in the programs of 
New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and British Columbia. Consumer 
education and the development of good taste in the selection 
of clothing and home furnishings are among the specific aims 
of the programs in Nova Scotia, Ontario, Manitoba and British 
Columbia. In six of the provinces. Nova Scotia, Quebec, 
Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan and British Columbia, the 
acquisition of skills is stated as a specific objective® 

It will also be noted that while the same basic aim may 
appear in the courses of studies of two provinces, one 
program may indicate a deeper philosophy of homemaking than 
the other.. The reader f s attention is directed again to two 
quotations from the courses of studies for Nova Scotia and 
New Brunswick. In the course for Nova Scotia one of the 
basic aims is ’’inculcating the need for family members to 
share In and enjoy work and social activities • n In the 
course for New Brunswick this aim is stated as ’'enabling the 
student to ... learn the pleasure which can come from tasks 
well done for the welfare of family members®” The conception 
of homemaking in the Nova Scotia course as sharing and 
enjoying life in the home is higher and more inclusive than 
the idea of self-sacrifice which is implied in the New 


Brunswick course

Although home economics is taught in grades ranging 
from six to twelve, the main emphasis upon the subject comes 
in the intermediate school. It is frequently a compulsory 
subject at this level* 

In four of the provinces, Alberta, Ontario, Nova Scotia 
and New Brunswick, the Integrated homemaking procedure Is 
recommended as the method of instruction*

CHAPTER V 


HOME ECONOMICS IN ALBERTA SCHOOLS 

The aims and objectives of home economics in Alberta 
schools have been set forth in the preceding chapter* In 
the following pages the present situation in home economics 
teaching in this province will be surveyed with a view to 
determining the number of students receiving instruction 
in this field, the courses offered and the type of centre 
and equipment being used. The materials consulted will 
be the Annual Reports of the Department of Education and 
the file of Miss A. B. MacParlane, Supervisor of Home 
Economics for Alberta* 

A number of factors have retarded development of home 
economics in the province. One of these was the depression 
of the 1930’s when a number of districts found it impossible 
to carry on the work in this field because of financial 
difficulties. Another was the teacher shortage created by 
the Second World War. Many school divisions wishing to 
initiate or expand home economics education programs are 
still unable to do so because of inability to obtain qualified 
personnel. Still another difficulty was faced by the smaller 
town and village schools where the enrolment was too small 
to warrant the setting up of a centre and the employing of 
a special teacher for this subject. The present trend 
towards centralization in school divisions is doing much 
to overcome the problem of providing all the optional subjects

While there is no course of studies for home economics 
in the elementary schools, it is taught in two Grade VI 
classes in Calgary. 

Of the total number of girls enrolled In the intermediate 
schools, 36.5 per cent are registered in home economics. 


Credits 

High school courses in home economics carry credit 
towards the high school diploma. The credit values of 
courses offered in the province are shown in Table IV.^

four-credit course, would require^thirty-five minute periods 
per week* In the intermediate schools one-half day per week 
is the usual time allotment* 

The course in needlework may be taught by the home 
economics teacher. It may also be taken as a correspondence 
course under the Correspondence Branch of the Department of 
Education. 

Rooms and Equipment 

Until recent years the home economics room was generally 
located in the school basement. When older schools are being 
remodelled, the trend is to move the home economics centre 
to the ground floor. In new schools the home economics 
classroom is usually on the ground floor. Schools which are 
planned as community centres generally have the home economics 
room directly accessible from the outside or from the 
auditorium. In a few of the new composite schools, a separate 
wing contains the home economics and general shop rooms* 

In most schools the home economics room is not used for 
other subjects. In a few cases where there are only a few 
home economics classes, the room Is arranged In such a way 
that it can be used part time for other school subjects* 

Two schools in the province have cottages which are used as 
homemaking centres. A few others are located in buildings 
which were originally stores. In a few separate schools in 
the province, the kitchen of the convent or of the priest’s 
house is used for classes. Former army or airforce buildings

have been converted into home economics classrooms at 
Red Deer, Wetaskiwin and Grande Prairie. 

The type of equipment varies greatly from one centre to 
another. It is dependent on such factors as the courses 
offered, (i.e. whether it is being used for homemaking in 
the intermediate school or for Home Economics I and II in 
the high school), the number of years the room has been in 
operation, the number of students accommodated and the 
financial status of the district. While the larger pieces 
of furniture are generally purchased by the board, smaller 
items are frequently made in the general shop course or by 
the girls themselves as a part of their homemaking work. 

Some attempts were made to use surplus army equipment but 
as a rule.the articles proved too large and heavy. 

Most homemaking centres are divided, either by the 
arrangement of the furniture or by low partitions, into the 
following areas: kitchen, laundry, dining room, living 
room, sewing room and bedroom. 

The majority of the kitchens are equipped with one 
range although the number varies from one to five. Of these, 
approximately fifty per cent are gas, thirty-five per cent 
coal and fifteen per cent electric. Refrigerators are 
provided in about thirty centres. Two-thirds of these are 
ice refrigerators; the balance are mainly electric, although 
one or two gas refrigerators are in use.

Th© laundry equipment In most of the centres consists 
of portable galvanized tubs and handwrlngers• A few centres 
have stationary tubs. Five or six centres are equipped with 
electric washing machines. While the majority of the schools 
now have running water, there are still a number where the 
water must be carried. In practically all centres electric 
irons are used© 

The furniture in the dining area in most centres consists 

of a table, four chairs and a cupboard. Dishes and cutlery 

to serve at least four people are usually supplied. 

Living room areas vary greatly. Many are equipped very 

simply with a table for serving tea, a few chairs and some 

book shelves. Half a dozen centres have chesterfield suites© 

In the sewing area, the number of machines per class 

varies from one to twelve, three being the most common number© 

Of these, between ten and fifteen per cent are electric. 

Practically every centre is supplied with a bed and 

bed linen. Most centres have a dressing table, frequently 

1 

made by the girls® 

Most teachers make use of class projects such as 
furniture painting, slip covering and picture framing to 
make the home centre more attractive®

Resuits of T.vo Studies in Alberta 

The ultimate objective of home economics education is 
the development of the student towards high standards of 
personal and family living* In the accompli shmaa t of this 
aim a wide variety of skills, knowledge, attitudes, 
appreciations and understandings are involved* To evaluate 
progress towards the attainment of the goals which have been 
established requires, therefore, a variety of measuring 
devices. These include the evaluation of the student’s 
methods of work, finished products, personality development 
and acquisition of factual knowledge® 

While it is conceded that there are certain intangibles 
in home economics education which do not readily lend them¬ 
selves to.measurement, one would expect that the student who 
has received training in this field in the schools would 
have a wider general knowledge of foods, clothing and home 
management than would the girl who has had no such training* 
In an attempt to check this expectation a test was given 
to students in first year courses in the School of Home 
Economics, University of Alberta. Some of the students 
tested had had no previous school training in home economics 
while others held credits in from one to five courses. In 
Table V is given a summary of the results of this test® 

While the number of students tested was too small to 
be statistically significant, the results are of interest 
in that they show a general upward trend in test results in

at the University of Minnesota and members of the advisory 
committee for the research project, "Effectiveness of Home 
Economics in Minnesota Schools". This study was sponsored 
by the State Department of Education and the University of 
Minnesota© 

The test included questions in textiles, laundering, 
selection and construction of clothing, and home furnishing. 
Questions were of the objective type and the test was 
machine-scored. The time allotment on the test was 
approximately one hour. 

In Edmonton schools scores on the test ranged from 22 
to 51 with a median score of 34. The range in I. Q., based 
on the Laycock test, was from 77 to 137 with a median I. Q. 
of 1C4. The results of the test are summarized in Table VI. 

In the state-wide test in Minnesota, the scores ranged

CHAPTER VI 


SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 

The present study has attempted to answer the quest!on* 
"To what extent is home economics education directed towards 
strengthening the homes of our land?" by considering the 
home economics situation in the intermediate and secondary 
schools in Alberta and elsewhere* 

The history of home economics education on this 
continent reveals the fact that emphasis on education for 
home and family life receive its impetus from the work of 
Mrs* Ellen Richards and the other delegates of the Lake Placid 
Conferences* Prom these conferences developed the American 
Home Economics Association whose objective was the improvement 
of conditions of living in the home* the institutional 
household and the community* The federal government, 
recognizing the importance of the work, passed bills 
authorizing financial support for home economics education 
and the movement to include courses in the school programme 
spready rapidly. 

In Canada development was influenced by practices in 
the United States* In the provinces in which the govern* 8 * 
ment provided financial assistance the growth was most 
rapid. 'The enthusiasm and generosity of three philanthropists 
and educators. Sir William Macdonald, Mrs* Hoodless and 
Mrs* Treble, gave impetus to the movement*

Changes in the social and economic situation which have 
affected the home have been reflected in home economics 
education. New inventions have changed the nature of work 
in the home® As the home no longer produces most of its 
needs, there is a demand for education in the intelligent 
consumption as well as production of commodities. The high 
divorce rate has made educators conscious of the need for 
training through the schools for greater stability in home 
and family life. 

The changing character of general education has strengthened 
the position of home economics. The trends in general education 
which have affected home economics education are increased 
enrolment, rise of the intermediate school, growth of social 
functionalism, and the stress on individualization, 
integration, problem-solving techniques and activism. While 
home economics is offered in both general and vocational 
programmes, the aims, content and methods of instruction are 
similar. 

Home economics is a way of life rather than a subject- 
matter course. Its fundamental objective is the improvement 
of personal and family living. The emphasis is on the student 
rather than the course. Through the acquisition of skills 
she is able to direct her own activities, evaluate results, 
work with others, take responsibility and become a valued 
family member 0

Analysis of home economics courses in Canadian provinces 
reveals the main objective to be the development of high 
standards of personal and family living. The need for 
flexibility in the program to meet community and individual 
differences is stressed. In all parts of Canada, home 
economics education receives its greatest emphasis in the 
intermediate schools. While the integrated homemaking 
technique is the method of instruction employed in four of 
the provinces, there is evidence that in the other provinces 
the emphasis is on home economics education as a way of life 
rather than as a means of acquiring facts. 

In Alberta schools development of home economics was 
retarded through the depression and the teacher shortage. 

The work is strongest in the intermediate schools where 
36*5 per cent of the girls are receiving instruction in this 
field. In the high school the courses carry credit toward 
the high school diploma and matriculation standing. There 
is a wide variety in the type of room and equipment being 
used. In most cases the rooms are set up as homemaking 
centres. 

Evaluating progress In home economics requires many 
devices. The testing program carried out Indicates (1) that 
test scores tend to increase directly in proportion to 
previous school training, and (2) that general intelligence 
has a bearing on ability in home economics©

CHAPTER VII 


IMPLICATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 

From the discussion of aims and objectives in home 
economics education, it will appear that the place of home 
economics in the educational program can hardly be over¬ 
estimated. No other course in the school curriculum is so 
fundamentally related to the present and future needs of all 
girls* 

While the number of students in home economics courses 
has steadily increased, we are still reaching only a little 
over a third of the girls enrolled in the intermediate schools 
in Alberta. In high schools the proportion of girls electing 
a course in home economics is even lower• If we consider 
the home the basic unit of our society, then education for 
home and family living becomes vital* To achieve our 
objective of strengthening the homes of our land through 
improving personal and family living, it becomes necessary 
not only to reach all the girls enrolled in our schools but 
also to institute a comparable course for boys. Such a course 
should go beyond the making of candy and hot cakes, sewing 
on buttons and darning socks. If the boy is to be guided 
towards better personal living and family membership his 
course must include some training in budgeting, consumer 
education, home planning and decoration, child care and the 
social ammenities which will help him to take his part as 
host in his own home*

The present study has also raised the question of the 
standards of achievement in home economics* While considerable 
variety exists in the courses offered and the methods of 
instruction used in the various provinces, we are working 
toward a common objective* If we could evaluate objectively 
and accurately the present situation across Canada, we could 
then attempt to remedy any weaknesses and unsatisfactory 
conditions brought to light. Widely accepted standards of 
achie vement could be set up and backed by experimental 
evidence. 

If such standards were available, a student’s level of 
knowledge and proficiency could be readily ascertained. The 
need for such a move was emphasized in the test administered 
to first year students in the School of Household Economics 
at the University of Alberta. Of the student tested 
approximately one-fourth had received no previous school 
training in home economics. The remainder held credits in 
from one to five courses. The scores on the test ranged 
from 37 to 95» The problem of providing in a single course 
for the needs of a group of students varying so widely in 
experience and ability can readily be appreciated. If 
standards of achievement were available these students could 
be segregated into more homogeneous groups. Students 
showing superior ability might be given credit for courses 
from which they were exempted or those with marked 
deficiencies in this field might be brought up to college 
entrance requirements by means of an !t A ff course as Is done

in other departments of the university* It would appear 
that this question is sufficiently vital to warrant further 
inves tigation. 

In many branc^fes of education we are beginning to 
recognize the fact that the need for training does not end 
with the formal school period* The Importance of acquiring 
many skills and facts is not evident until the need for 
applying these skills and facts arises* Need for further 
information and training also arises out of new discoveries 
in all brances of science* As a result many types of 
extension service are being offered In the field of adult 
education* 

A beginning has been made in adult education in home 
economics’ by offering courses to wives of service men 
attending university* These courses include consumer 
education, child care, sewing for children, home decoration 
and food preparation* The keen interest shown in these 
courses by the limited number of homemakers to whom they 
have been made available would indicate the need for ex¬ 
tending this branch of adult education* 

If our basic conception of home economics education as 
the improvement of personal and family living is sound we 
must not only extend It to include a much larger part of 
our school population but we must continue it beyond the 
formal school period*

3. The necessity for each student to shoulder her 
ov/n responsibilities. 

4. The social graces. 

Basic Skills; 

Problems in personal relationship will cfi. ffer with each 
school and classroom. It is hoped that each teacher 
(using the guidance technique) will try to meet the 
problems of her students with tact, understanding and 
sympathetic treatment.

in attitudes, ideals and attainments will be noted and 
that its effect will be an asset to the home, school 
and community.

The procedure followed in gathering the data was to 
examine the periodical literature on home economics education, 
to consult the courses of study in home economics in the 
various provinces, to consult the files of the Department 
of Education of the Province of Alberta, and to carry out 
a testing programme In Grade IX classes in Edmonton schools 
and in first year classes in the Department of Household 
Economics at the University of Alberta. 

In tracing the history of home economics education on 
this continent for the past fifty years, it was revealed 
that emphasis on education for home and family life received 
its impetus .from the work of Mrs. Ellen Richards and the 
other delegates of the Lake Placid Conferences. From these 
conferences developed the American Home Economics Association 
whose objective wa3 the improvement of conditions of living 
in the home, the institutional household and the community.

work, passed bills authorizing financial support for home 
economics education and the movement to include courses in 
the school programme spread rapidly. 

In Canada development was influenced by practices in 
the United States. In the provinces in which the govern¬ 
ment provided financial assistance the growth was most rapid. 
The enthusiasm and generosity of three philanthropists and 
educators. Sir William Macdonald, Mrs. Hoodless and Mrs. 
Treble, gave impetus to the movement. 

Changes in the social and economic situation which have 
affected the home have been reflected in home economics 
education. New inventions have changed the nature of work 
in the home. As the home no longer produces most of its 
needs, there Is a demand for education in the intelligent 
consumption as well as production of commodities. The high 
divorce rate has made educators conscious of the need for 
training through the schools for greater stability In home 
and family life® 

The changing character of general education has 
strengthened the position of home economics. The trends in 
general education which have affected home economics education 
are increased enrolment, rise of the intermediate school, 
growth of social functionalism, and the stress on 
individualization, integration, problem-solving techniques 
and activism. While home economics Is offered in both 
general and vocational programmes, the aims, content and

methods of instruction are similar 


Home economics is a way of life rather than a subject- 
matter course. Its fundamental objective is the improvement 
of personal and family living. The emphasis is on the girl 
herself. Through the acquisition of skills she is able to 
direct her own activities, evaluate results, work with others, 
take responsibility and become a valued family member* 

Analysis of home economics courses in Canadian provinces 
reveals the main objective to be the development of high 
standards of personal and family living. The need for 
flexibility in the programme to meet community and individual 
differences is stressed. In all parts of Canada, home 
economics education receives its greatest emphasis in the 
intermediate schools. The Integrated homemaking technique 
is the method of instruction employed in four of the 
provinces. 

In Alberta school development of home economics was 
retarded through the depression and the teacher shortage* 

The work is strongest in the intermediate schools where 
36*5 per cent of the girls are receiving instruction in 
this field. In the high school the courses carry credit 
toward the high school diploma. There Is a wide variety in 
the type of room and equipment being used. In most cases 
the rooms are set up as homemaking centres. 

Evaluating progress In home economics requires many 
deviceso The testing programme carried out indicated 








(1) that test scores tend to increase directly in proportion 
to the amount of previous school training, and (2) that 
general intelligence has a bearing on ability in home economics®
