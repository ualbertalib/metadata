CHAPTER I 


MENTAL HYGIENE CLINICS IN ALBERTA 

The Mental Hygiene Clinic Movement in Alberta is com¬ 
paratively new* In order that the situation in regard to the 
Clinics may be clearly understood and Clinic set-up explained, 
a brief history of their establishment and life to date is 

given• 

The Mental Hygiene, or Mental Health, Clinics in 
Alberta were started in the Fall of 1929 in three of the 
larger centers - namely, Edmonton, Calgary and Lethbridge, 
Later Clinics were established at Medicine Hat, Drumheller, 
and at the Provincial Mental Hospital, Ponoka. In the Fall 
of 1934, and again in the Fall of 1936, a series of Clinics 
was held throughout the Grande Prairie and Peace River country 
It is planned to make this series of Clinics an annual affair, 
but the trip corId not be made in 1935* 

The Mental Hygiene Clinics, which are free, are an 
activity of the Provincial Heal apartment, and are entirely 
under its control* However, the attitude of those in charge 
has been one of co-operation, and the work has been co¬ 
ordinated with other Provincial and local activities, in so 
far as this seemed both possible and desirable. There is no 
doubt that greater co-ordination might be brought about in 
some instances, particularly if there was available a larger 
personnel for more joint and intensive work where this seemed 
called for. 

The Clinic personnel consists of the physician in 
charge and the social worker. The physician, who is also a 




n 




- 2 - 

psychiatrist in every case, interviews the patient referred, 
and relatives or guardians where this is possible, and does 
what examining seems indicated in the physical, neurological 
and psychiatric fields. The social worker assists in the 
interviews, and does any psychological and mental testing 
work required, and, in a certain number of cases, outside 
investigation work. When desired reports are sent out on 
the cases examined and recommendations made. In many cases 
efforts are made to have patients continue contact with the 
Clinics through return visits to facilitate observation of 
symptoms and progress in treatment. The maintaining of con¬ 
tacts would be much easier if more social workers were 
available. This would make the Clinic work more effective, 
also. 

There are various agencies that refer cases to the 
Clinics, and, indeed, suitable cases may be referred by any¬ 
one. Quite a large number of cases are referred by and 
through the school authorities in the districts in which 
Clinics are established. Another group of cases comes 
through the children’s organizations and juvenile courts, 
particularly through the Child Welfare workers, both 
Provincial and Civic. A third group is referred by the 
doctors. Other cases are referred by parents, relatives, 
friends, or through some other channel. {See Table yII 

The Clinics started under the able direction of Dr. 
Charles P. Fitzpatrick, who left the service of the provincial 
Health Department in 1931. Co-operating with and assisting

Dr. Fitzpatrick were the then Minister of Health, Honorable 
George Hoadley, under whose authority the Clinics were set 
up, Dr. M. R. Bow, Deputy Minister of Health, Dr. J. M. 
MacSachran, in charge of the Department of Philosophy, 
University of Alberta, Dr. M. K. Lazerte, and Dr. H. E. 

Smith of the Department of Philosophy staff, Dr. E. H. 

Cooke, then Superintendent of the Provine ia 1 Mental Hospital, 
Dr. W. J. McAlister, then Superintendent of the Provincial 
Training School, and many others. Mr. S. K. Jaffary was 
the first social worker and psychologist. 

In 1931 the active direction of the Clinics was 
taken over by the late Dr. C. A. Baragar, then Commissioner 
for Mental Institutions and Director of Mental Health for 
Alberta. Under Dr. Baragar f s farsighted guidance and 
direction the clinic services continued to grow. Up to the 
time of his death, in March 1936, he took personal charge 
of many of the Clinics, and kept in close touch with the 
work carried on in the others. Since 1931, Dr. W. J. 
McAlister,, now Superintendent of the Provincial Mental 
Institute, Edmonton, has been in charge of the major part 
of the work in the Edmonton Clinic, and ns entirely in 
charge now. From 1931 to the end of 1935, Dr. George A. 
Davidson, then Superintendent of the Provincial Mental 
Hospital at Ponoka, took approximately half of the Clinics 
in the South of the Province, and did very able work. Dr. 
Davidson left the service of the Health Department at the 
end of 1935 and took up work in another Province. Since the 



t , .* _ . . ' : ■/ ) 









? 


j 





-4- 


beginning of 1936 the major number of Clinics in the South of 
the Province have been taken by Dr. R. R. Mac Lean, Acting 
Medical Superintendent of the Provincial Mental Hospital, 
assisted by Dr. T. C. Mic hie, in charge of the Female Wards 
at the Provincial Mental Hospital, and by Dr. W. L. Yalens, 
until recently in charge of the Provincial Auxiliary Hospital 
at Claresholm. Dr. Yalens has now left the service to con¬ 
tinue his studies along child guidance lines. 

The social and psychological work was carried on till 
the Fall of 1931 by Mr. 8. K. Faff ary. Following this Fr. E. 
J. Kibble white was on full time work, in the South of the 
Province and at the Provincial Mental Hospital, with a part 
time social worker, Kiss Agnes Starkie, in Edmonton. In the 
Spring of 1933 the position of part time social worker in 
Edmonton was discontinued. Since then Mr. Fib blew bite has 
had all of this work to do, a.nd has attended nearly all of 
the Clinics held. This has meant that the amount of follow¬ 
up and outside work possible has been reduced to a. minimum. 

Another feature of the general programme of work has 
been that of the Eugenics Board. The Board was established 
in 1928, with the passing of the 'Sexual Sterilization Act', 
but the first cases were not considered till the Fall of 
1929. Since then the Board has functioned steadily, meeting 
every two or three months for the consideration of cases. 

The Mental Health Clinics have proved invaluable in contact¬ 
ing cases outside of the Provincial Institutions, and in 

preparing them for presentation to the Board. To date the 
Board has passed over nine hundred and fifty cases, and of

these over four hundred and eighty have been operated on. 
(See Appendix A.) 

The members of the Eugenics Board are Dr. J. M# 
MacEachran, Provost of the University of Alberta and head 
of the Department of Philosophy, Chairman; Dr. E. L. Pope, 
Director of Medical Services, University of Alberta Hospital 
Dr. E. G. Mason, eminent neurologist of Calgary; and Mrs. 
Jean H. Field of Spurfield. The Board interviews every 
patient ?;hose case is presented, and ives careful consider¬ 
ation to all the facts of the case before directing that 
the sterilization operation be carried out. The expenses' of 
the operations are defrayed by the Province. 

The following Tables may assist in giving a clearer 
idea of the work done through the Mental Hygiene Clinics. 
Tables I, II, and III show the number of clinics held at 
each of the clinic centers, the number of new cases dealt 
with, and. indicate the amount of follow-up work done on 
cases that have been dealt with previously, for the years 
1933, 1934, and 1935 respectively. Table IV shows the 
total number of new cases dealt with to December 31st., 

1935. The years 1933, 1934 and 1935 have been chosen as 
being representative of the clinic work being carried on. 

The Edmonton Clinic is held every Monday afternoon in the 
Civic Block in the rooms used by the Baby Clinic. The 
Calgary Clinic is held every other Wednesday, as an all day 
clinic, in the Pre-School and Baby Clinic rooms in the City 
Hall. The Lethbridge Clinic is held every fourth Friday in 
the Nursing Mission. It is an a 11 day clinic. The Medicine 




- 6 « 


Hat Clinic is held for two full da;ys about every three months. 
The first day of each clinic visit is spent at the General 
Hospital where cases other than school cases are seen. The 
second day is spent in examining school cases. The Brumheller 
Clinic is held every two or three months and is a full day 
clinic. The trip through the Peace River and Grande Prairie 
district takes about -two weeks, and is planned as an annual 
series of clinics. The clinics are held in the most suitable 
available quarters at the centers visited. The clinics have 
received support and able assistance from the Public Health 
Nurses wherever contacts have been made with them. This 
support and assistance has been particularly valuable in 
Calgary, Medicine Hat and Drumheller where they arrange the 
clinic appointments, and, when necessary, assist at the 
clinics. In many instances the nurse has made the initial 
contact with the patient which has resulted in a visit to 
the clinic for examination. 

Tables V and VI show the distribution of the clinic 
cases according to age and sex for the years 1934 and 1935 
respectively. A change in the method of setting up the 
table introduced in the 1934 compilation invalidates for 
comparative purposes the corresponding table for 1933 and 
it is not included. The tables that are given are largely 
self explanatory. 

Tables VI1 and VIII show the sources from which cases 
are referred to the clinics.. Table YII covers the clinic 
cases for 1934, and Table VIII covers those for 1935. Some 
facts of interest are brought out in these two tables. It 




- 7 « 


will be noted that few cases are referred directly from the 
schools in Edmonton, and few in Lethbridge, while there are 
a number referred in both Calgary and Medicine Hat. This 
is due in part at least to differences in school administra¬ 
tion in the different centers, and in part to differences in 
clinic location and affiliations. More cases are referred 
by the Child Welfare in Edmonton than in an}/ other center. 
This is mainly because Edmonton is the headquarters, and 
clearing center as it were, for Child Welfare work. The 
physicians refer a number of cases in each center. Relatives 
and friends refer an appreciable number of cases, and there 
seems a tendency for the number from this source to increase. 
Then there are quite a number of cases referred by various 
welfare institutions, and other agencies, as noted in the 
tables. 

Tables IX and X, each given in three parts, A., B, 

\ 

and C, s how the classificat ion of cases according to age 
and problem. f A* section of the tables covers the pre¬ 
school years, t B t section the '-ears from seven years to 
eighteen years, and T C* section the years from nineteen 
years on. Table IX deals with the cases in 1934, and 
Table X deals with those in 1935. The different sub¬ 
headings given will explain the classification made in 
each section of the tables. It . ill be noted that of 
the four hundred and twenty-eight new cases examined in 
1934, twenty, or 4.7$, were in the pre-school period, 
two hundred and seventy-nine, or 65.2$, were from, seven 
to eighteen years of age, and one hundred and twenty-nine 








- 8 - 


or 30$, were nineteen y ears of age or over. Of the three 
hundred aid. s ixty-three new cases examined in 1935, forty- 
two, or 11.6$, were in the pre-school group, one hundred 
and sixty-eight, or 46.3$, were from seven to eighteen years 
of age, and one hundred and fifty-three, or 42.1$, were 
nineteen years of age or over. 

Tables XI and XII show a classification of the cases 
on the basis of the major recommendations made. Table XI 
covers the cases for 1934, and Table XII covers those for 
1935. It should be kept in mind that this table is somewhat 
inadequate in that in most cases more than one recommendation 
is made. Not infrequently" several recommendations of about 
the same importance may be given. In all cases an effort is 
made to discuss with the patient or parents or guardians all 
of the relevant factors of the particular situation in hand. 
For statistical purposes, however, it is necessary to weight 
one recommendation or suggestion more heavily than the rest.

CHAPTER II 


A STUDY CP SCHOOL AGE CASES: 

TEH CASES INTRODUCED 

In the follOYving pages are presented a number of 
school age cases which have been handled through the 
clinics, with an attempted analysis of the general 
situation in each case, and suggested remedies. In most 
cases conclusive results are still pending. In others, 
general trends of improvement, or lack of it, are apparent. 

In all cases we are dealing with alive, thinking, willing, 
human organisms, many of whom are urgently in need of care¬ 
ful direction and supervision. 

There is a wide variety In the type of school age 
case referred to the clinic. There Is the obviously 
mentally retarded child, where the problem is to ascertain 
the amount of retardation and outline a suitable method of 
carrying on so that the child may get as much as may be 
frcm his training period. The most marked of these cases 
are handled most satisfactorily in an institution. Then 
there is the child who seems to work hard but is unable to 
keep up with the class. There is, also, the child who seems 
able to'do the work, but woiks spasmodically, if at all, and 
the child who can keep well up with the class with little 
apparent effort. With any of the above conditions there may 
be some disciplinary or behavior problem. There are, as well, 

those cases in which there is a general mal-adjustment or in 
which some special problem or disability is causing trouble. 


-21- 



-22- 


In some cases things appear to be oing along smoothly enough 
until there is an apparently sudden outburst that causes con¬ 
cern. Sudden outbursts are more likely to occur, probably, 
in cases where there is some emotional stress occasioned by 
ma 1-ad jus tment of some kind. Mental disease is not thought 
of as being common in childhood, but it may be that disorders 
that appear later in life have their basis in childhood to a 
greater extent than was thought formerly. Dr. Frankwood 
Williams, then a director of the United States National 
Committee for Mental Hygiene is quoted in "Introduction to 

Mental Hygiene’ 1 - pp. 48-49, as follows:- "It is commonly 
believed that individuals become insane suddenly. No one 
ever became insane suddenly. Menta1 disease develops over 
a long period of time. From small beginnings it grows 
insidiously,, until, to the uninitiated, it blossoms forth 
in full bloom to the distress and consternation of those 
taken by surprise. And yet, before their eyes and the 
eyes of school teachers and ministers and friends and 
family physician, the thing has been developing all the 
years - only they have called it by other names”. 

We. have not yet reached the stage where the average 
classroom teacher is prepared and qualified to pick out 
cases of mental retardation unaided, particularly cases 
where the retardation may not be very marked. To an even 
greater, extent is it true that the classroom teacher is 
quite unprepared to pick out cases where symptoms of 
incipient mental disorder are present. In fact in many 
cases no differentiation is made between mental retardation 
and mental disease, the "dumb” individual being called 
"crazy”, and the "crazy" individual "dumb 1 '. Too, despite 


the training teachers are given in their Normal School 






- 23 - 


Course, they will openlj; - and. persistently tell Johnnie he is 
dumb and ray him unmercifully before the class - which leads 
to much more misery for Johnnie at the hands of his fellow 
students. art of this attitude may be laid at the door of 

the type of training given in Normal Schools, and to the lack 
of any real appreciation of the whole problem on the cart of 
the teachers when they commence their teaching work. One must 
remember, however, that most of the teachers are sincere in 
their efforts to do what is best, and that they have many things 
to battle against, such as overcrowded rooms, lade of adequate 
equipment, lack of suitable living quarters, and very often 
lack of salary. 

During recent years the phys ical health and well being 
of the child has been receiving increasing attention, and it 
is not unusual for each child to receive a complete physical 
examination upon entering school, particularly in the larger 
centers. It is to be hoped that the time is not far distant 
when su itable mental examinations will be usual for school 
beginners, too. Through them much time could be saved, both 
for the pupil and the teacher, and much unhappiness made un¬ 
necessary. As an organization of people, we are still at the 
stage where we will spend large sums of money to improve our 
herds, grains, roads and cars, but grumble over small sums 
spent on our children. It has long been recognized in the or y 
that human material is basically fundamental, but we have been 
slow in putting our theory into practice. It is admitted 
readily that much has been done, but much more remains to be

done. A great deal of our handling of human material is by 
the trial and error method, or no method at all. How much 
better off we would be if we had an accurate running record 
of . each child as he or she passed through our schools, with 
results of physical examinations, mental examinations, 
school achievements, social adjustment, and special problems 
to aid us in directing future activities. And this with no 
idea of mechanical regimentation, but as a means to aid in 
guiding each individual into a suitable life course. The 
present state of world-wide unrest and insecurity is surely 
sufficient proof that we must use ourselves - human material - 
more wisely and efficiently if we are to save what 
civilization we have. We have perfected mechanical devices 
to the stage where the average individual can control 
machines capable of doing well nigh miraculous things, but 
there has been no corresponding increase in human stability 
and judgment so that the average man might be trusted to tve 
control of such mechanical devices. 

Judgment and stability are not acquired quickly. 
Intelligence may not be increased overnight. On the other 
hand, the breaking down processes in human personality do 
not occur spontaneously, although the manifestations of a 
breakdown may be sudden enough, apparently. The cases 
cited below may help to indicate some of the problems that 
we must solve if we are to aid ourselves most effectively 
towards a more stable, a happier and a better civilization. 

The cases which follow have been chosen to 



- 25 - 


illustrate representative types of case and. representative 
types of situation that have been encountered in the clinic 
work. Each case is an actual one, although no nara.es are 
given. The cases have been chosen from the clinic records 
for the entire Province, and not confined to any one 
d is trie t. 

The classroom situation has not been stressed 
particularly because each case itself includes so much more 
than those elements that appear in the school, although it 
is very often a fact that the evidences of trouble in the 
school, either with work or with behavior, have brought the 
case to the clinic’s attention first. Ideally, we should be 
in a position to work in much closer co-ordination with the 
schools in the handling of problem cases. Facilities 
available have not permitted this to date, although in one 
clinic center one day from, each visit is spent in examining 
school cases. 

Each history that follows has been written with the 
object of presenting an intelligible word! picture of the 
case as a whole, without the inclusion of too many details. 
That- the histories may be inadequate is readily admitted, but 
they do represent pieces of work actually done. In the nature 
of things they are not sealed and completed. The individuals 
concerned are still carrying on, and creating more "history” 
every day. Some of them have passed out of the schools, some 
have not. What the situation will be in each case ten years 
hence no one can say, but. a study cf the facts so far -hould 




-26 


enable us to make seme shrewd guesses. 

There are ten "cases" in the group given, although 
two of the "cases" deal with more than one individual - 
case No. 1 with a family, and case No. 2 with twins. It 
should be noted that these "cases" are not Isolated ones, 
and that many more similar cases could be written up. 
However, it was felt that a clearer picture of the different 
types met with to date could be obtained by reviewing a few 
selected cases rather than by reviewing many very similar 
ones, which, If given, would have the effect of "the woods 
obscuring the trees". 

Case No. 1 :- Is that of a family of defectives. 

Taken as individuals they are fairly typical of the average 
defective of corresponding grade. These people do poorly 
in school and are often very unhappy there because they 
are constantly expected to do tasks that are beyond them. 
They a re easily led into undesirable courses of conduct 
and become the unwitting tools for their cleverer com¬ 
panions. They are unable to appreciate the social sig¬ 
nificance of many of their acts, even though they may 
recognize right from wrong in simple situations. A few have 
tendencies that seem definitely anti-social, but mcs.t of 
them have not. They like to have things and see things, 
and get attention, and may have to resort to ways and means 
tha t do not. meet with approval. Under proper training and 
supervision most of them are able to live happy, useful 

lives, but they cannot shoulder a normal load of respons¬ 
ibility.

Case No. 2 :- Is that of twins of limited intelligence 
who had been encouraged in ambitions that were totally beyond 
them. An early diagnosis of their condition would have aided 
very much in directing their training and ambitions along more 
profitable lines. 

Case No. 5 :- Is that of a defective from an inferior 
family. This case was recognized fairly early, but proper 
steps could not be taken to insure the best training. This 
case illustrates another common course for the high grade 
defective, and shows how well such a one can get about, and 
even sell his ideas, and how plausible a story he can tell, 
even though it is wholly untrue. 

Case No. 4 :~ Is that of a yooing girl, well developed 
and of good appearance, but very unstable emotionally. Her 
intellectual endowment was of borderline grade, but 
sufficiently high to have allowed her to carry on had she 
been blessed with a stable personality. In many situations 
she would, and could, pass as of quite normal intelligence. 

But she lacked judgment, was impulsive, and her reasoning 
was as erratic as her emotional reactions. This'type of case 
is most difficult to handle successfully. In many ways the 
individuals are so close to normal that a normal reaction is 
commonly expected. A prolonged period of careful training 
is essential, and this is seldom possible. Even with this 
one cannot be sure of results. If the emotional trend is 
religious, we may have a religious fanatic of the most un¬ 
stable type. Or there may be excesses . long any one of a

number of other lines. All too often the home background 
these cases have is none too good, although this is not 
always the case. This type of case can be so repentant over 
wrong doings, and so full of good intentions and promises - 
and so easily tempted over the line into misbehavior again. 

Case No. 5 :- Is that of a teen age boy of normal, 
better, intelligence, who persisted in miscondirct, partly 
because of a faulty personality make-up, but mainl}/, one 
feels, because of poor home training. Given an initially 
poor home situation and aggravate it wi th a common-law- 1 ;ife- 
husband situation, and an aggrieved attitude on the part of 
the mother, and the situation is bad. There is the feeling 
of insecurity in regard to the home, the fear of public dis¬ 
approval, and in this case the fostered attitude, really one 
of defence, that "the other fellow" is to blame. Among other 
things this ease shows the undesirability of allow a boy, 
or girl, to place all the blame for any course of action on 
other shoulders. The attitude becomes a rationalized habit, 
and a very injurious one. The trouble was diagnosed fairly 
early, but the boy and his parents would net accept this and 
work to correct it. ITow a period in an industrial school 
may, but it is doubtful. 

Case No. 6 :- Is that of a boy of normal Intelligence 
who got into behavior trouble. The family background In 
this case was much better than that in Case No. 5, the 
personality was better, and there was much better co¬ 
operation in effecting a re-adjustment. The results were

very encouraging, and further serious trouble is not looked 
for. 

Case No. 7 :- Is again that of a boy of normal 
intelligence, but this time the problem has t o do with night 
terrors and sleep walking on the part of the boy, and worry¬ 
ing fears which the mother had and which she was allowing 
to influence her to too great an extent in ber handling of 
her family. The remedy depended as.much on educating the 
mother to adopt a different attitude as it did on attempt¬ 
ing to aid the boy with his specific trouble. Results have 
been encouraging. 

Case No. 8 :- Is also that of a boy of normal 
intelligence but with a problem of still another type. This 
time over-sensitiveness on the part of the boy and lack of 
appreciation of this fact on the part of the teacher, produced 
results which were nearly tragic, almost costing the lad his 
life. This case brings into relief the thorou hl^ pernicious 
habit of attempting to secure better academic results from 
school children, and particularly public school children, by 
use of ridicule aM sarcasm. The practice is to be frowned 
down upon in every case. The teadher would gasp with horror 
at the suggestion that she had broken a child’s arm, yet 
she may go serenely along breaking down his morale and 
emotional balance, which is far more serious from the 
standpoint of his life and adjustment. 

Case No. 9 :- Is that of a young girl already showing 
signs of an early schizophrenic reaction. She had a broken 







- 30 - 


home, and positive heredity through her mother to contend 
with. Suggested treatment and placement in a better 
environment have produced some improvement. It is hoped 
that the improvement will continue, but that remains to 
be found out. There are relatively few cases in public 
school as pronounced as this, but there are a number who 
show a tendency to a-schizoid type of reaction, and who 
would stand a much better chance of escaping trouble later 
on if they could be appropriately handled during their 
school years. 

Case Ho. 10 :- Is that of a teen age boy of normal 
intelligence who developed a frank psychosis. Some factors 
in this situation were disagreement between the father and 
the mother which led to a home broken up, the death of the 
father, and economic stringency under the mother’s care 
again, and rather unwise handling on the part of the mother 
and grandmother. The boy is recovering from his illness, 
but a recurrence is not unlikely, especially should he be 
subjected to any undue stress in the future. 






CHAPTER III 


A STUDY OF SCHOOL AGE CASES: 

CASES CONSIDERED IN DETAIL 

Case No. 1 

The "X” Family - Defectives 

This family was first brought to the attrition of 
the clinic in 1933, because of suspected immoral conduct of 
at least two of the children, coupled with marked backward¬ 
ness in school progress. The following is an outline of 
the situation as it existed then, and further developments 
are noted as the case progresses. While not all of the 
children were in school when the case opens, all are included 
in the history to give a more complete picture of the whole 
s itua t io n. 

Family History and Situation :- Mr. "X”, the father, 
had died a few months previously of a cardiorenal condition. 
For years, and up to a year or so before his death, he had 
been a confirmed alcoholic. He had not made a good adjust** 
ment socially or economically, and had supported the family 
by doing various sorts of laboring work, and more latterly 
by acting as the town constable. All accounts would indicate 
that his. intelligence was not above average, at best. 

Mrs. had secured the I'others * Allowance following 
her husband * s . death, and was ear-ring on trying to hold the 
family together. She was well meaning and inoffensive in 
and tried hard to do what was right. The task of 
looking after the family unaided was just too much for her. 
There were many indications that she was mentally subnormal, 

- 31 - 
















■ ; '

- 32 - 


but no formal rating was secured. 

Little information regarding the family background 
could be obtained from Mrs. and she knew little about 

either her own family or her husband's* Nearly all the 
relatives on both sides of the house still live in Scotland. 
Mrs. "X" said that she did not know of any heredity of 
mental or nervous trouble. 

Siblings :- The following table gives the ages of 
the various children in 1933, and brief notes on each. The 
female children are noted as F. 1, F. 4 --the numerals 
denoting position in the family, the oldest child being 
designated as 1. The male children are not ed as M. 2, 

M. 3, etc. The abbreviation C.A. is used for chronological 
age, M. A. for mental age, and I. .for intelligence 
quotient.

Personal Histories :- No abnormalities of birth were 
noted. All the children were full term babies. The usual 
childhood diseases have gone through the family, but no 
serious after effects, have been noted. The developmental 
ages have been somewhat retarded throughout the family. 

All of the children were born in Alberta. There is a 
history of convulsions in only one case, F. 9, and these 
appear to be epileptic in nature. The general physical 
health of the family has been fairly good. 

School progress ha's been unsatisfactory in the 
case of each child. F. 1, and M. 2 reached grade four at 
fifteen or sixteen years. M. 3 reached grade .five at 
fifteen years. F. 4 reached grade three at fourteen 
years, and so on. M. 6 alone is making fairly satisfactory 
progress, and this could not be called good. The general 
school adjustment has been unsatisfactory. The children 
are poorly mannered, inclined to be quarrelsome, and the 
language they use is rough, and at times profane. There 
has been a definite sex interest shown by all 'the members 
of the family when school age has been reached. 

Case :- The original complaint, as noted above, was 
that two of the children, l\ 3 and F. 4, were accused of 
sexua1 misconduct, anb menta1 deficiency was suspected. 

The original investigation resulted in the gathering of 
the data given in Table XIII, and the facts note:: regarding 
the general family situation. 

The original recommendat f ions were that X. 3 and F.4 








- 35 - 


be admitted to the Provincial Training School for training, 
and that contact be maintained with the rest of the family 
so that any further supervision or action could be taken. 

Due to a lack of sufficient personnel, the supervision and 
'irection possible proved inadequate. 

F. 3 and F. 4 were admitted to the. hr ovine ia 1 
Training School, M. 3 in November 1933, and F. 4 In 
1934* M. 3 responded to training quite well and adjusted 
well in the School. On a psychometric examination given in 
the School he earned an I.Q,. of 57, which is in close' agree¬ 
ment with that of 58 earned previous to his admission. He 
was presented to the Eugenics Eo^rd for Alberta in Fafch, 
1934, and passed by them. The operation for sexual 
sterilization was carried out in Fay, 1934. F. 3 was given 
a considerable period in the School’following this, and 
continued to improve in personal demeanor and conduct. He 
has been out of the School f or a time now;, and is adjusting 
better. Indications are that he will be able to carry on 
with some supervision and direction. 

F. 4 showed no particular improvement as a result 
of training, although she gave no special trouble so far as 
school routine was concerned. A psychometric examination 
done at the Training School .gave her an I. ... of 49, just 
one point above that previously earned. She is still under¬ 
going training at the School. Her case was considered by 
the Eugenics Board in March, 1934, and the sterilization 
operation was carried through in April, 1934.

There was a further definite complaint early in 
1933 in regard to F. 7 and K. 8. There had been further 
sexual trouble and further investigation revealed that F. 7, 
now ten years old, had been having sexual intercourse with 
several . boys of about her own age at school, and also with 
seme Chinese adults in the town• M. 8 was implicated also, 
and probably other members of the Tf X n family. F. 7 was 
suspended from school for an indefinite period. 

A check psychometric test done on F. 7 gave her an 
I.Q. of 67. On a previous test she had earned one of 64. 

Immediate admission to the Provincial Training 
School was recommended for F. 7, and this was arranged. 

M. 8 has been carrying along at school and at home somewhat 
more satisfactorily, but not in a really adequate manner. 
Both children would certainly benefit by a period of 
specialized training in an institution such as the 
Provincial Training School, but the necessary accommodation 
is lacking. 

It is of interest to note that M. 2 married in 1936, 
despite efforts on the part of the town authorities to 
prevent it. M. 2 would not agree to having his case come 
before the Eugenics Board. More definite efforts were made 
to prevent F. 1 from marrying, at least without being 
sterilized, but these efforts were unsuccessful, despite 
the assistance of Mrs. "X H . F. 1 had been carrying on with 
a young laborer who appeared to be definitely subnormal. 

They were married in 1936. One can predict that both F. 1 




-37 


and M. 2, and their marital partners, will bring numerous 
children into the world, a number of whom will be 
defectives. In the years to come the State will, 
undoubtedly, be called upon to contribute substantially 
to their support. 

Of the family of ten only two have been sterilized 
to date. It may be that others will be before they reach 
the childbearing age. That every member of the family 
should be sterilized is our belief. With at least six of 
the ten siblings of the family definitely defective, and 
one of the others epileptic, there would seem little chance 
of their offspring be in g mental ly noimal, especially as they 
are likely to mate with those of about their own mental 
level• 

The clinic offers a service for the early diagnosis 
and recognition of such cases as the above, and as well a 
service to aid in their supervision and training.. Careful 
studies of other similar cases over a much longer period 
of time have revealed the trail of tragedy, incompetency, 
disease, and unhappiness that they leave down through the 
years. ' This one family, not an isolated case, sh ows that 
we in Alberta have our own definite problems in this 
regard• 

Little information could be obtained about F. 1 f s 
illegitimate child. It has not been seen to date.

Case No. II 

Male Twins - Subnormals’ 

This is a case of twin boys, very much alike but 
not identical. They are the sons of a bank manager and 
have an excellent home. The father had great hopes for 
these boys and had planned professional careers for them. 

He wished one of them to be a doctor. When referred to 
the clinic they were nineteen years old and still in 
school. One had been pushed along to grade eight and 
the other to grade nine, although neither was doing, 
acceptable academic work. The;/ had been allowed to con¬ 
tinue school partly because of the family position in the 
town, partly because the boys themselves gave no trouble 
from a behavior standpoint, and partly because they tried 
The parents, and also the school board, realized 
that something was not right, and wished a definite 
diagnosis and recommendation. 

The outline and history of the case was as follows:- 
la mi 13/ Hi s t o r y; - (Father) 46 years old. His 
general health had- be,- although there was a history 

of some indefinite spinal trouble at about thirty-six years 
of age which caused inflammation for a time. There was 
Iso a history of a recent "nervous breakdown” for which no 
institutional treatment was required. The father is of 
Scotch descent and Inclined to be phlegmatic in temperament. 

He has been very much concerned over the boys. There was 
no history cf any mental or nervous disturbances in the 




- 39 - 


family. The father re- :arr ie d following the death of his. 
f i rs t w if e. 

(hother) The hoys’ own mother died of tuberculosis 
at the age of forty-two years, when the boys were quite 
young. Otherwise the fan. ily history on the mother’ 
appeared clear. 

The step-mother is a fine type of woman:, and the 
boys get along well with her. 

; ■ personal histories of the 

boys were very s imilar. In each case there were feeding 
difficulties, and a genera], retardation in developmental 
awes. Eliminative control was late in be ing ests 
There were no convulsions. One boy was a tuberculosis 
suspect for several years, but was f anally given a clear 
health bill in this respect several years before he was 
seen at the Mental Clinic. There was no history of any 
serious physical illnesses. The history indicated quite 
definitely that the condition of general retardation had 
existed from birth. There were no other children in the 
family. 

Physical examinations given at the time of the 
clinic visit qhowed the boys to be in good physical 
health. Neurological examinations gave negative results. 

Intelligence tests, using the Stanford Revision of 
the Binet Test, on which co-operation was excellent, gave 
results as follows. J. earned a mental age of fourteen 
years and two months, and an intelligence quotient of 89. 






























.

- 40 - 


His basal age was ten years with two test items passed at 
the sixteen year level. J f s. vocabulary rated at the 
sixteen year level, partly because of the somewhat 
superior environment he had lived in and the very careful 
training in English he had received. B. earned a mental 
age of twelve years and two months, and an intelligence 
quotient of 76. Again the basal age was ten years but no 
test it ems w ere passed abo ye the f ou rt e en year level. B *s. 
vocabulary rated at the fourteen year level. 

In personality both boys were friendly and open, 
and were well liked. There was a tendency in each case 
for the boys to associate with younger boys, although they 
got along well with adults. Both boys were rather discuns- 
ive in conversation. Each was ambitious above his capacity. 
B. said he wished to be a designer of automobiles. He had 
some special ability in drawing. J. said he wanted to be 
a professional athlete and trainer, for which he had 
neither the ability nor the physique. 1. was somewhat 
more irritable than B. and tended to lose his temper 
easily. Neither boys had a normal appreciation of money 
values, which may be blamed in part on faulty training in 
this regard. 

Re com • endations :- It was recommended that both 
these boys be allowed to discontinue school, and that their 
interests be directed away from their too ambitious plans 
and oriented towards vocational types of work of which they 
are capable. Some suggestions made in regard to J. were 







































:

- 41 - 


gardening, garage work, poultry raising and sign or 
decorative painting. Gardening, garage work, and 
poultry raising were suggested for B. also, but it was 
pointed out that he would need a greater amount of 
supervision and direction than J. 

Developme nts These boys have been allowed to 
discontinue school and to spend a great deal of time on 
a farm the father has. They have been making a fair 
adjustment now under these conditions for over two years, 
and the family appear to be reccnoiled to the made changes 
in their plans. One gets the impression, however, that the 
father is allowing them to "play" at farm work, and is not 
preparing them effectively to carrjr on more independently. 
What may happen when his guidance is removed is hard to 
say. The influence that the stable, cultured home 
atmosphere has had on these boys can hardly be over - 
estimated, and under any circumstances will aid thorn in 
adjusting. 

Case No. Ill 

Male - High Grade Deficiency 

"D" paid his first visit to the clinic in 1930, 
accompanied by his mother, who had brought him because he 
had been doing poorly in school, had been running away, 
and had been generally unreliable. The case is included 
to show some of the variations one finds in this type of 
case, and also to note further the part played by family 




- 42 - 


ba ekground a nd home life. 

Family History :- The father was forty-eight years 
old in 1930, and the mother six years younger. The father 
was a labourer who was finding it very hard to get along. 
Since 1930 the family hove been on relief much of the time. 
The father r s health was good and no adverse heredity was 
elicited. The mother was not robust; in fact she was a 
semi-invalid who found it hard to keep her home in even 
fair condition, and harder to keep control of her family. 
Again no adverse heredity was elicited, but it seems 
entirely likely that there is some history of adverse 
heredity on each s xt e of the house, could all the facts 
be found out. 

The mother, and father appeared to get along fairly 
well together, but at best the home was a poor one. 

There were five siblings, of whom the oldest was 
eighteen years and the youngest six years. The oldest 
Lid., a girl, was in the provincial Training School, 
having been committed there following sex delinquency. 

Her intelligence quotient on s formal test ir. 1927 was 
55, and. on a re-test in 1930 it was 57, TT D ?? was fourth 
in the family# The other siblings were making fair 
progress in school and were giving no particular trouble. 

It may be of interest to note /ihere that the 
sister who was in the Training school was discharged to 
her home in the late summer of 1931, after her case had 
been considered by the Bugenics Board and she had teen 




- 43 - 

sterilized. Since her discharge she has stayed at home 
most of the time. She has worked out for short periods 
doing menial domestic work. She married in 1936, and she 
and her husband are both at home with her parents now. 

Personal Iijstcry :- "D’s” birth and early develop¬ 
mental history were reported as normal, except in talking. 
He did not talk until late and when he was four years old 
he could say only a comparatively few words. When he first 
came to the clinic he was still definitely limited in his 
language ability. He had never had any really serious 
illnesses and had never had convulsions. He had been 
somewhat of a problem since pre-school days. In 193C he 
was eight years old and already giving trouble, as noted 
above. 

There had never been much of a c ha nee for "D”, or 
the other siblings, to enjoy pleasurable play or social 
contacts at home, and "D" started to find .his pleasures 
away from home. 

Clinic Zixa min at io ns : - Physical examination did not 
reveal any gross defect, and w D 5t appeared in fairly good 
condition. 

A mental test gave him an intelligence quotient of 
75 . He co-operated well and appeared to do his best. He 
showed more aptitude for arithmetic and number problems 
than he did on the language tests. 








- 44 - 


A complete re-examination was made in September, 

1936. Physical condition was quite good, although there 

was some lagging in the appearance of the secondary sex 

characteristics* On a mental re-test, "D" earned an 

intelligence quotient of 71. This checks closely with 

the intelligence quotient earned previously, especially 

as a note made in 1930 states - "This (I.f . 75) may be 
taken as the upper limit of his present ability, as on 
one or two of the tests he was given the benefit of the 
doubt where his responses were none'too clear". 

It was rectmmended in. 1930 that "D" be allowed to 
attend a different school where he would be able to make 
a fresh start in new surroundings, and where the situation 
could be explained to the school, authorities before he 
arrived. Also, some steps were to be taken to try to 
improve the general home conditions. 

Developments :- "D" was allowed to go to a different 
school, and made a better adjustment for a time. However, 
from 1930 to 1936 there were fairly frequent outbreaks of 
trouble of a minor nature. The family moved about the city 
a good deal, and "D" was in several different schools as a 
result. He would run away occasionally,- lie more than 
occasionally, and do some petty thieving. His school pro¬ 
gress was unsatisfactory, but he was pushed and pulled along 
until in 1936 he found himself in grade six. 

In September 1936 "D" came up in Juvenile Court, 
charged with numerous thefts. He was referred to the clinic 
for a complete re-examination, with the physical and 




- 45 - 


psych ©metric results noted above. "D" said that he had 
a great admiration for an older brother who had gone off 
"beating his way", and who was then in San Francisco. 
According to "D" this older brother had been "all around 
the world nearly". "D" showed a considerable amount of 
interest in farm. work. His personality was extrovert and 
he was quite pleasant and co-operatjye. 

It was recommended that he be tried out in a good 
farm home first, before more severe measures- were resorted 
to. 

An enumeration of what happened in the one month of 
September may be enlightening. He was in Juvenile Court on 
September 1st. 1936, charged with thefts, as noted above. 

He was then re-examined at the clinic with the above 
results. He was made a Hard of the Superintendent of Child 
Welfare and temporarily placed in a city shelter. He ran 
away and was picked' up forty-five miles away, and returned. 

He was immediately placed in a "splendid farm, home" about 
one hundred miles away. The day after he arrived "he ran 
away, taking the dog with him and leaving his clothes". 

On September 29th. a wire was received from the police in 
Winnipeg saying "D" was being held there. 

He was reburned from Winnipeg, and he settled down 
for the winter, or for part of it. He was allowed to 
remain at home and go to school, and he behaved fairly well. 

3arly in Febilp.ry there was another definite break. 
He ran awa 37 " from home and decided he would go to the West 







-46- 


Coast. He found his way to a Child Welfare officer, one 
who,, as it happened, did not know him, aid -very convincingly 
stated that his home was in Vancouver. His father was dead. 
He had foolishly "beaten" his way to Alberta but now wanted 
to get home, a nd he gave a house number and street. The 
Welfare officer ired for confirmation, which, of course, 
he did not ge t. In the me a nt ime "D" was re c ogniz e d. It was 
found out as well that he had been pilfering regularly in 
one of the larger stores in the City. 

It had become all too apparent that "D*s" parents 

w e re w holly unable to c on trol him, a nd t h at he was rap id 1 y 

nearing some very serious trouble. The clinic further 

recommended - "To avoid this, if pos sible-would! suggest 

that he be placed under custodial care, preferably in a 
boys* school where- clue attention is' given to vocational as 
well.. as scholastic training, end where character training 

and intelligent discipline ar '.-If the R.— 

oehoo1 meets t hese c end itiono, - — --—strongly arge that 
early steps be taken to have him admitted". 

What will the outcome he in this ease? It is very 
hard to say . With initially inferior material t o work with 
the outlook is none too hopeful. The years' of lack of 
training have made themselves felt, and the 

normality has encouraged a straying from socially acceptable 
. a stable helpful home t, 

well have escaped trouble and settled down to some useful 
occupation, under supervision. Cur schools do not me 1© 
sufficient provision for this type of case, and do not 
provide sufficient training opportunities of suitable types. 
There are interesting jobs that "D" can do, hut he has not

dis covered them* 


Case No. IY 

Female - Borderline Deficiency 

This is the case of a school age girl who was 
referred to the clinic through the Department of Child 
..elfare. She had reached grade five at that time. She 
first attended the clinic in July, 1934. Since then there 
have been frequent contacts, which are still being main¬ 
tained. She was referred primarily because she had proved 
a decided behavior problem with emotional instability, and 
had not made normal progress in school. 

The facts of the case are presented below. 

story ;-* When the clinic file opens- the 
father was fifty-one years old. He had been born in the 
IJnited States, was nor ma lly hea Ithy, a nd v as then 1 iving 
on a farm. Subsequent information would indicate a 
religious turn of mind, of the type that likes to parade 
his religion. He was a Protestant. He had drifted about 
a good deal, working considerably as a rig builder in thp 
oil fields. 

The mother was forty-one yes.rs old in 1934. She 
also was horn in the United States. Her health had not 
been very good, and she was reported as being suite 
nerv ous. 

No other adverse heredity was elicited on either 


side of the house 






- 49 - 


^iblings :- (1934) There was one sibling older than 
the patient and three younger. The elder sister, F. 1, was 
eighteen years old, and living at home. She was said to be 
in good health. She had reached grade six at fifteen years. 
M. 3, a younger brother, was thirteen years old and'in grade 
four. He was referred to as a n dumb egg". F. 4, a younger 
sister, was eleven years old and in grade two. .. Hone of the 
other children had given any particular trouble, and all 
were regarded as healthy, normal children, except for E. 3*s 
"dumbness". There has been no opportunits^ to secure mental 
ratings on any of the children other than the patient. 

Fersona 1 History :- Birth and developmental history 
are normal. There had been the usual childhood diseases, 
but no really serious illnesses. The patient had always 
lived at home. She had worked out for short periods of a 
few days at a time. 

She had always been ifficult to manage. She was 
self-willed and impetuous, fond of company, and of adventure. 
By 1934 she was completely out of control, so far as her 
mother was concerned, and was only partially under the 
control of her father. 

School History :- This was none too encouraging. 

She did not do well in an academic sense, but took an 
active part in the general activities of the school. She 
was fond of school festivals, dramatization and such like. 

She got along fairly well with the other pupils. She was 
inclined to be irregular in attendance, mid hard to control. 






- 49 - 


Case :- Information indicates that in the Fall of 
1932 the patient rap away from home, riding off on a horse 
that d id no the long to t he f amil y. 3he was a way s evera 1. 
days before being brought back, and had spent one night 
in a truck with several men.- This was the most serious 
of several similar escapades. There were charges that 
she had stolen at different, times a variety of-articles 
such as "blankets, money, and whatever she could ley her 
hands on". 

In November, 1933, bees of additional trouble, 
the case came up in Juvenile Court, and the p. 
placed under the Superintendent of Child Welfare, but 
allowed to go home. For some months she ap eared to make- 
a much better adjustment, but in the Spring of 1934 she 
got in with, a rough "fast" crowd, and there mas a 
succession of parties and dances on vliich smoking and 
dr inki ng were c ornmon, and sexual indis cretions to ok p1ace. 
It was foiMid necessary to remove her from the home 
env i r onr e nt ent i re 1 y. 

According to the girl's own story a factor in the 
home situation causing constant irritation was that her 
sister, F. 1, was given many small preferences which irked 
the patient. 

The clinic examination did not reveal any marked 
physical defect, although there was a heart murmur and a 
slight enlargement. General development was -ood, and 
the girl had quite a pleasing appearance. 





- 50 - 


A psychometric examination gave a mental age of 
twelve years and nine months, and an intelligence quotient 
of SO. A subsequent test gave an intelligence quotient of 
78, which checks closely. 

In personality the patient created a good initial 
impression, but showed emotional instability. There was a 
noticeable extrovert tendency and a rather vivacious manner. 

Developments :- Following the clinic examination, in 
July 1934, it was recommended that the patient be placed in 
a good environment away from home, where she would have an 
opportunity to adjust more satisfactorily under suitable 
conditions and supervision. She was tried out in several 
' ood homes, but her emotional reactions were so unsatis¬ 
factory that she was sent to a social service home for 
girls, in Calgary, where she remained until May 1936. 
while there she gave considerable concern by her impulsive¬ 
ness and instability. 

A clinic re-examination dur ing the period in Calgary 
showed no essential change in physical or mental health or 
capacity. In view of the history of the case, and the con¬ 
tinued lack of proper adjustment, it was recommended that 
she be seen by the Eugenics Board* Her case was reviewed 
by them, and the directed operation was carried out just 
after she left Calgary. 

8he was allowed to go home on her recovery, 
although the outlook did not seem very hopeful. One point 
in its favor was that the family had moved into a new 




- 51 - 


district and the financial circumstances seemed better. 

In the months that this patient has been home 
again she has had several quarrels with her parents, and 
at the time of writing is working away from home. She is 
engaged to a young laborer of none too desirable a family, 
and they plan to marry this year, if possible. She is 
continuing to show her impulsiveness and instability, and 
we may expect that her future will continue to show wayward¬ 
ness. That she will have to be institutionalized again is 
a very distant possibility. What cculd have been accomplished 
if she had been under adequate training and supervision from 
an earlier age is a question that cannot be answered, but 
such a course would have been full of possibilities. 

Case No. V 

Male - Psychopathic Personality 

This case came to the attention of the clinic 
first in November 1929. The lad as then between seven 
and eight years old, and had already been in considerable 
trouble for one so young. He was playing truant from, 
school, causing trouble by his mischievousness while at 
school, being disobedient, staying away from home, and 
doing seme petty thieving. He was in grade one at school 
and not doing satisfactory work. 

The general background of this case is quite 
interesting and instructive, and is given below in some 





- 52 - 


detail, as it is known* 

family T w story :- The boy f s father was a Ukrainian 
bootlegger who operated in the Alberta - United States 
border territory. No definite history could be obtained 
in regard to his family, bunt that he was not of a high 
type can be taken for granted. He deserted the boy and 
his mo ther when the boy was six months old. He- subsequent¬ 
ly served a jail term for his bootlegging activities. 

The mother was of average intelligence but rather 
unstable emotionally, and was, in many ways, anti-social 
in attitude. No definitely adverse hereditary family 
history was elicited. After the father left her and 
until the boy was six years old she worked as a waitress. 
The boy had to fend for himself a great deal, staying 
wherever the mother happened to be working, and boa] 
most of the time under no adequate supervision. He was 
placed with an aunt for a time, but the hi stew 
that the aunt went to extremes of strictness with him, 

- i d I .ant because of this. He was 

in the La combe Home for a year, and did well while there. 

When the boy was about six years old the mother 
da home again with a railway trai 
i, but act 

been any legal marriage, one reason being that t v e mother 
had no divorce from her first husband. However, for 
practical purposes she re-married in effect, and took her 
common-law husband's name, as did the boy. The step-father 







- 53 - 


took an immediate interest in the boy, whom we shall call 
n P n 9 and has been very good to him throughout. The step¬ 
father is a man of at least average intelligence and of 
quite a pleasing personality, although his judgment has 
not been good in dealing with the boy. 

At the time of the first clinic contact with the 
case, the family were living in rooms, and there was a 
small six-months old baby, a half-brother to n P". The 
family quarters, in a city block, allowed very little 
room for TP" to play inside, and none at all outside 
except on the street. Since then the family have moved 
to a house of their own. Also, there have been two other 
children born. None of the three half ~s iblings is showing 
abnormal menthl or' physical symptoms to date. 

Pers ona1 Hi story :- The personal history has al¬ 
ready been outlined to the time n P ,f was seven years old. 
There were no developments 1 abnormalities, and no serious 
illnesses. TP" had learned the "ways of the world" rapidly, 
and at seven years was sophisticated much beyond his years, 
and adept at looking after himself on the city streets. 

Clinic Examinations :- Examinations at the clinic 
in 1929 showed ff P T s n physical health to be good, although 
there was some indication of slight undernourishment. 
Mentally he earned an intelligence quotient of 114 on a 
formal test. Co-operation was good, but the worldly wise 
attitude was apparent. There seemed no realization of what 
his then line of conduct would lead to, although there was 






- 54 - 


nothing very abnormal in that, taking his age into consider¬ 
ation* 

Recommendations were made that he be advanced a 
grade in school, as he was not working anywhere near his 
capacity; and that the situation be gone ever carefulljr 
with the parents in an effort to assist them in handling 
"P". Failing a satisfactory adjustment- at home the clinic 
recommended a further period in the Lacombe Home, where he 
had. made a good adjustment previously* 

Developments Since 1929 :- For a time things went 
along more smoothly* ”B W did better in his school work, 
his behavior was better, and he seemed more under control 
at home. However, there continued to be trouble which 
tended to increase in seriousness* For several, years "P" 
was able to "get by" as it were, with relatively long 
periods free from any particular trouble, and with the 
troubles he did have smoothed over by his step-father 
and his mother. The following will give an idea of his 
delinquent activities. 

"P" said that he was taught to steal in 1930 by 
two older boys. The three boys would play truant to¬ 
gether and do petty pilfering, "P" being, very often, the 
one to carry out the actual theft. In this connection it 
is of interest to note that the other two boys are mentally 
deficient. One is now in the Provincial Mental Institute, 
and one is in an industrial school outside of the Province. 
Stealing from Woolworths started in 1930, and "P" was

cheeked for this. In 1932 he got in with another group 
of bigger boys and began to steal bigger tilings, such as 
toys and electric train engines. The other boys kept 
these things but "P Tt got sufficient thrill out of being 
smart enough to get the desired articles. In 1932, also, 
he stole a bicycle. This was returned and the case was 
dropped. There follow some other minor thefts to April, 
1935, when he and two other boys stole an automobile and 
drove it around for some hours. They were caught and the 
Juvenile Court judge placed "P M and one of the other boys 
on suspended sentence, ard under the Superintendent of 
Child Welfare, They were placed on farms in a new 
district. 

In July 1935, tT P M was back home again, with new 
petty theft charges against him, and also charges of 
running away from where he was placed. He was brought 
back to the clinic for a complete re-examination. 

There were certain personality traits that were 
well marked by July, 1935, but which had been gradually 
developing. There was a marked aggrieved attitude, and a 
complete lack of willingness to take the blame for any¬ 
thing. There was also marked untruthfulness , and an 
apparent utter disregard for promises once they were made. 
There was also a tendency to sulkiness, and his expressed 
principles and ideas were anti-social. Outside information 

and a talk with the mother showed that she shared in the 
boy's men era! attitude and projected his failures to otners.

Physical and neurological examinations revealed 
no physical basis'for his misconduct, and Tr P f s" general 
health was good. 

A psychometric test gave him an intelligence q 
quotient of 107. He had earned an intelligence quotient 
of 114 in 1929. It was felt that the drop of seven points 
was due, In part at least, to some let down in co-operation 
because of his general attitude. He was in .grade seven in 
school. 

In view of all the factors in the case a diagnosis 

. It was recommended 

that he be placed in an industrial school if the parents 
could not control him, the Industrial school being the only 
available institution at all suitable. 

Developments were even more rapid following July 
1935. t? p fr got into more trouble and was committed to the 
industrial school. He was only there a short time when he 
eloped and found his way back home. Instead of being re¬ 
turned to the school at once the authorities allowed him to 
remain home. For a abort time things went better and "P" 
had a job as a delivery boy. When this failed his trouble 
broke out again, and he was implicated in further petty 
thefts, and further taking of cars for tf joy rides . 

Largely through the influence of the clinic he was given 
one last chance to adjust at home. Again the situation was 
gone into carefully with the boy and his parents. It was 
pointed out that it was absolutely essential that "P tr 










- 57 - 


should assume his fair share of blame, and that the parents 
must not aid in fostering an attitude of projection. Efforts 
were to be made to get "p" a job, and "P" promised to do his 
best. 

"P's" best was very bad. Within a few days trouble 
started again - there were more thefts and another car 
taken, and again "the other fellow's fault". Also, 
information came out that "P" had been implicated in a 
number of other previous affairs of a fairly serious nature, 
including a charge of tampering with the mail. No other 
course being open, ,T P" was sent to the industrial school, 
where he still is, although he had vowed that he would get 
away, "p" is nov; fifteen years old. 

The outlook is not good. What would have been the 
result if he had had a good home environment, particularly 
during the pre-school years, we may only guess. Certain 
it is that the home does play a very important part. A 
home, a safe retreat from the batterings of the outside 
world, a place where one "belongs", is of inestimable value 
at any time in life, and especially so during the formative 


years

Case No. VI 

Male, Normal Intelligence - Behavior Problem 

This case, that of a boy of eleven years, came to 
the clinic in 1931. He was then In grade four and doing 
fairly well in his academic work, although he had repeated 
grade three three times. The patient was referred 
primarily because he had been implicated with five other 
boys in stealing cars for "joy rides". The oldest of these 
boys was sixteen years, the youngest, the patient whom we 
shall call "Y". It is interesting to note that of the six 
boys the oldest one was definitely a defective, with an 
intelligence quotient of 56. "Y" secured the highest 

rating of the group, earning an intelligence quotient of 
107. The other four boys had intelligence quotients 
ranging from 88 to 95. 

Pami 1 y History :- The family history was negative 
so far as could be found out. The father, then thirty- 
eight years old, was normal and healthy. The mother was 
thirty-six years old, normal, and healthy. They were of 
Scotch' extraction. They had been married seventeen years, 
and had gotten along well together. The fatter was a 
truck driver. There were six children in the family, of 
whom "Y" was the third. The other members of the family 
of sc-ool age were making average school progress, were 
normally healthy, and had given no trouble in a 
disciplinary or behavior way.

Personal History: - ’’Y’s” birth end developmental 
history were normal, with no history of any serious illness 
or convulsions, "Y" had always been an active, friendly 
child who got along well with others and had numerous 
friends. He had a pleasing appearance and an open frank 
countenance. He gave no trouble at home. The trouble 
which occasioned his reference to the clinic was the first 
there was record of, other than very minor disobediences. 

School History :- TT Y TT started school at six years, 
and the first three years he made a grade a year. Then he 
spent three years in grade three. It seems that he was 
allowed to go through the first two grades without receiving 
the grounding he should have had and being allowed off on 
some portions of work because of his bright manner and 
pleasant ways. He began to capitalize on these and did not 
do his work, so finally "rested" in grade three. His 
intelligence was not sufficiently high to allow him to go' 
along without an average amount of work. 

He gave practically no trouble in a behavior way 
in school, although he was whipped once for striking a 
match during a class session. 

Case :- tT Y" and five other boys were charged with 
having stolen several cars for "joy riding”, as mentioned 
above. They would take a car and drive it around the 
district for a few hours and then leave it somewhere and 
go home# Each boy would take a turn at driving the car, 
the entire object of the adventure seeming to have been 













- 60 - 


to have a good time. The e re not wilfutty damaged 

and v,ere left abai t as the boys : 1 , except for the 

soline and oil used. They were not used to aid in 
other misdemeanours.. Finally the "gang" was caught and 
the boys appeared in Juvenile Court. They were referred 
to the clinic for examination before the cases were dis¬ 
posed of. 

C1inic hra minatio ns :- Phys ical and neurological 
examinations gave essentially negative results. n Y 5? was 
in good health and well nourishes » 

On the psychometric examination w Y rr earned a 
mental age cf twelve years and five months, and an 

gen co Quotient of 107. lie co-operated well and 
his responses were of good quality. His grasp of general 
and school knowledge was normal. 

n Y*s ,f personality has already been commented upon. 
He could give no adequate reason for his, actions in the 
car episodes except that he got with the group and then 
followed the lead of the others. Hs admitted that he 
enjoyed the adventure of it. 

It was recommended that "Y ,f be supervised more 
carefully, and f at his; companions be chosen, to the 
extent that he was to keep away from the other members 
of the f at least. His movements at night were to 

be under special control. It was recommended, also, that 
"Y n be given a chance to go to the Y.M.C.A. and 







- 61 - 


of the activities and boy’s groups there. He was to come 
back to the clinic every month for a time for a friendly 
talk. 

Develop men ts ; - Efforts were made to carry out the 
clinic recommendations. "Y" came back one month after his 
first visit, accompanied by his mother, and good progress 
was reported* He had joined the "Cubs", he had been in 
no further trouble, and his school work was showing improve¬ 
ment. Two months later he was doing well still. He had 
joined the Y1M.C.A. and was enjoying the activities there. 
There had been no further trouble and the old gang 
associations seemed t o be broken up. "Y" himself seemed 
cuite pleased with his progress. Six months la. ter tie re 
was a similar report. At this time "Y" was keeping some 
rabbits as pets and was much interested in them. 

"Y" continued to do well for ayear and a half 
following his first visit to the clinic. Then further 
trouble occurred. An older boy stole a purse with nearly 
$50*00 in it and several of the other older boys, some of 
whom "Y" had been associated with in the car stealing, 
found'out about it. They persuaded "Y" to lead the boy 
with the stolen money into a "trap" or "ambush" whereupon 
the others set upon him and took most of his stolen money 
away from him. ' "Y" was to be given $1.00, but he claimed 
he refused to take it. 

"Y" was let off with a warning, which he apparently 
took to heart, for there have been no further reports of

misconduct, He has continued to make normal progress in 
school, and shows promise of making a good adjustment when 
he completes his school work. He may not get a chance to 
complete high school, as the family’s financial status is 
no t good. 

This was the case of a noimal boy-who sought an 
outlet for his adventurous spirit in conduct which was 
anti-social, but could not be called criminal. He 
realized the error of his ways and with some assistance 
and direction he was able to re-adjust himself &o that 
his activities could be approved. 

Case No. YII 

Male - oleep balking and Night Terrors 

This is the case of a boy first brought to the 
clinic in March, 1935. He was not referred initially 
through the school, but if is felt that he belongs to the 
school group of cases, because of his age, eight years, 
and also because a continuance of his condition would be 
reflected very soon in his conduct and progress at school. 
When he was brought to the clinic he was having night 
"spells" about every other night. The night terrors had 
been present for some time, but the sleep walking had 
been pie sent for a few months only. He was a very active 
boy, interested in things about him and in s chool. He 

i 

was in grade two and reported to be doing quite good work.

His conduct was TT excellent”. 

Family History :- The family on the father’s r ide 
was reported as being without any positive heredity for 
mental disease or deficiency", although there were some 
other members of the family high-strung and nervous. 

The father himself was twenty-nine years old and healthy. 
He had a public school education. He had been an iron 
foundry worker, but was on relief in March, 1935. On 
the mother’s side there was some positive heredity. Her 
father had had a mental breakdown at forty years, and has 
been in a mental hospital ever since. His case was 
diagnosed as - ’’Schizophrenia - Paranoid Type”. The 
mother, twenty-seven years old, was one of six children, 
of whom the others were reported healthy and normal. The 
mother herself was of normal intelligence but a great 
worrier, she worried excessively over the children, and 
particularly about whether or not they would inherit any 
tendency to men tel disorder. Her worry over this la st, 
combined with other factors, produced a mild depression. 
Several visits to the clinic and re-assurance have tended

particularly distressing to the mother because of the 
family history on her side. It seemed entirely probable 
that the mother’s over-anxious attitude communicated 
itself to the boy, and cl id not assist in overcoming the 
condition. Because of the fact that the family were on 
relief, and the economic situation was not good, the 
mother felt that they could not get little extra things 
for ”T” that she thought would do . him. good. 

There was only one other child, a girl of three 
years (1935). She was a normal healthy child and had 
given no trouble. 

The clinic recommended that w T f s" teeth and 
tonsils be given any needed attention; that he be given 
a light supper with no heavy foods; and that this be 
followed by a quiet evening, with a warm bath and a 
waim drink at bedtime. The clinic was able to assist in 
obtaining an extra pint of milk a day for the patient’s 
use. 

Deve 1 opments : - Dur ing the past two years the 
clinic has had a number of contacts with ”T’’, mainly 
through return visits to the Clinic, which have been 
encouraged. Progress has been satisfactory so far as 
he has been concerned. Attention has been given his 
teeth, although his tonsils have not been removed to date. 
The changes in his evening routine at home have practic¬ 
ally eliminated the sleep walking, and the night terrors 
have disappeared. Some dizziness developed for a time, 




- 66 - 


but this disappeared following further treatment of his 
teeth. A note in December, 1936, is to the effect that 
f T" was then in good health, had no dizzy spells, and had 
a very occasional spell of sleep walking* He was doing 
well in school, was in grade four, and was well up in his 
clas s. 

A feature of the family situation, and one that 
may lead to further trouble, is the mother’s continued 
worry over the possibility of the children inheriting and 
transmitting a tendency to mental disorder. Because of 
this she is over-anxious about the slightest indication 
of a departure from normal. In the summer of 1936, the 
younger child, then a girl of four years, bumped her head 
rather severely. The mother thought that following this 
her eyes became dull and that she did not; look the same. 
She was brought to the clinic for an examination in the 
Hall. The examination showed that the child was normal, 
m ent al ly, a nd nothing : j ah norma1 ' 
about the appearance of her eyes. The mother was. further 
re-assured. 

If the mother continues her worrying, over- 
solicitous attitude, there is a grave danger that the 
children will become over-concerned too, which will lessen 
their chances of making a satisfactory social and economic 
ad justment.

Case No. YIII 

Male - Over-Jens i ti vene s s, 

Attempted Suicide 

This case first came to the clinic in 1033, as a 
boy of twelve years in grade five. He had 'attempted to 
commit suicide by shooting himself with a 12 rifle, tl 
bullet going through the left lung under the heart. He 
was brought to the clinic after he had recovered from 
his wound. He nay be called "H”. 

-lo b la 1 1 ?t or y : - Tl e f. n II y 1 
so far as could be found out, except that the patient’s 
maternal grandfather had committed suicide at about fifty 
five years, in a fit of despondency. Whether or not this 
influenced the patient’s actions could not be found out 
definitely. He did know about it. In 1933 the father 
was fifty-two years old and the-mother forty-two years 
old. Both were healthy, even above the average, and 
both were of normal intelligence. The father was a 
farmer. 

M H” was the fifth of nine living children, all 
of whom were reported normally healthy and of normal 
intelligence. There had been one death, by drowning - 
a baby boy of ten months. The history of the school 
progress of the other members of-the family showed tha.t 
all the older ones had completed public school and had 
taken some high school training.

Personal History :- The birth and developmental 
his tory were normal, except that as a baby "H" had been 
undernourished up to ten months because the parents had 
had trouble in getting a food to suit him. He was bottle 
fed. There were the usual childhood diseases, but "H w 
was never seriously ill. He never had any convulsions. 

n H tf had been somewhat over-sensitive from baby¬ 
hood. He had a pleasant personality,, mixed readier, and 
made friends easily. He never had to be whipped for 
correction. Speaking to him was the only punishment he 
needed, and even this would bring tears to his eyes. He 
liked to help around home, and was especially good with 
the younger children. As a smaller child he was rather 
nervous and excitable. 

5chooSituati on :- He started school at seven 
years and appeared to get along normally in all subjects 
but spelling. While it was not possible to find out 
definitely the exact cause of the initial trouble in 
this subject, the information 'g iven would indicate that 
the teacher rather neglected to give him an effective 
start. He repeated grade two, but otherwise had made a 
grade a year. He himself liked arithmetic best of his 
school subjects, and liked to lead. He was reported to 
be a wood oral reader. 

He was quite interested in sports, and took an 
active part in the games played by his age-group. His

favorite outdoor sport was baseball. He had shown no 
apparent shrinking from rough play, despite his sensitive¬ 
ness to remarks. 

The teacher at M H T s" school the year of the 
accident was, apparently, quite sarcastic and would hold 
different children-up to ridicule, especially if they did 
not ho well in their work. felt this more than most 

of the other children, but there seems no reason to think 
that he was singled out for special ridicule. On 
different occasions he had felt very badly over remarks 
the teacher had made about his errors. As he was poor in 
spelling, this subject became associated in his mind with 
ridicule and unpleasantness, and this in turn, undoubtedly, 
reacted to his disadvantage in learning and reciting, or 
writing, his spelling. The day before the accident "H's" 
grade had a spelling test. He had made ISJo and was con¬ 
sidered to have failed. The teacher called him "little 
45" , and made him stand up and tell the class the mark he 
had made. Previous to this particular test the teacher 
had remarked that "H" would not get 405 on it. 

Going home from school that afternoon he had re¬ 
marked that .he felt like shooting himself, and was 
obviously feeling quite blue and discouraged. He did his 
usual evening chores at home and went to bed, but it was 
quite late before he got to sleep. 

The following morning he was up at the usual tire, 
6.30 a.m. , and did his share of the before-breakfast chores.

He then asked for his gun, saying he was going down the 
coulee for a few minutes. He had previously said that he 
did not want to go to school that day. He d U • not come 
in for breakfast and his mother went out to call him.. 

After she had called she saw him coming from the coulee, 
but instead of coming into the kitchen he went into the 
basement. He was pale and crying and had sh ot himself 
just below the heart. He was taken immediately to the 
Hospital and made a good recovery. 

Following his recovery he went back to school 
again, and had been going a short time when he came to the 
Clinic, little had been said about the accident and "H" 
appeared -to be happy in his return to classes. 

ulinlc jjxam.inat ions : - phgsical e xa mi n.at ion sh o wed 
"H ,f to be in good physical health. His tonsils were some* 
what enlarged - otherwise there was nothing of note. 

On a psychometric examination "IF earned an 
intelligence quotient of 1QG. He co-operated well and 
responded quite readily, although he showed some nervous¬ 
ness at first. Test results were closely grouped about 
the noimal chronological age level and did not indicate 
anything out of the usual. 

The situation was discussed with t? H", and also 
with the parents. It was recommended that the situation 
be gone over with the teacher - which was done. 

Developments :- The better understanding of "H" 
by his parents and his teacher has resulted in a happier 





- 71 - 


adjustment for him. The shooting incident has been 
allowed to drop, and the sarcasm and ridicule have been 
materially reduced. M H M has gone right ahead in his 
school work, and, as well, has been t music lessons. 

The whole picture is a much more hopeful one, and promises 
a satisfactory social and economic adjustment later on. 

This is an outstanding case in which ridicule and 
sarcasm played a .prominent part. There are, hew; ever, 
many other cases in which much unhappiness is caused by 
thoughtless ridicule. Teachers are far from being free 
from, blame in this regard. Ridicule is so easy to use' 
and it leaves no physical mark. The mental reaction is 
largely out of sight, but, nevertheless, it is there, 
and playing a much more important part in the life of the 
individual than a physical bruise. Ridicule is: a method 
of discipline, and all to o often of purely selfish 
satisfaction for the teacher, that cannot be too strongly 
condemned. 

In considering the w;hole family situation in regard 
to this case, 'it is of interest to note that the oldest boy 
in the family, also the oldest sibling, came to the clinic 
late in 1934, suffering from a mild psychosis of a 
schizophrenic type. He was then twenty-one years old. He 
was advised to become a patient in a mental hospital for a 
time, which he did voluntarily. He remained in hospital 
jist over a month, made a mood recover, and was discharged.

To date there has been no further recurrence of his 
trouble. lie is of normal intelligence. 

Case No. IX 

Female - Schizoid Personality 

, t : uf a girl of ten, first came to 
the attention of the clinic in November, 1933. 
problem at that time was stated as - "backward in school; 
inattentive and untruthful; soils and wets herself at 
times". In 1933 the chief concern was because of her 
backwardness and inattention at school. She was then in 
grade four. There are some rather interesting points 
about both the family and the personal history, as noted 
below. 

Famil y history :- There is some reason to believe 
that a paternal granduncle was insane, otherwise there 
appears no positive heredity behind the parents on either 
side of the house. The father, then thirty-nine years 

so. 

its. . , a 

real es ta te a gen t. He d i d not ts 1: e a n active, norr a 1 
interest in the patient, and seemed quite content to let

The mother was then forty-five years old. She bad 
been admitted to a mental hospital in 1932 suffering, from

a psychos is diagnosed as "schizophrenia". She is still 
in a mental hospital. Previous to her admission to the 
hospital she 'was unstable in personality, and had made a 
poor adjustment, being particularly lacking in the cover 
to make decisions a i . ’ , , 

no suspicion of any-intellectual deficiency on e ither t 
father's or the mother's side. 

Personal History :- The patient's mother had 
nephritis for tv;o months before the patient was born. At 
birth the patient, who may be on lied "R", seemed in a sort 
of stupor. She remained In a more or less stuporose con¬ 
dition for two or three months after birth. There were 
no convulsions, she was bottle fed and poorly nourished 
up to :bout six months. Her developmental, ages were 
retarded. She was nearly two years old when she began 
to talk, and was slovenly in speech. Eliminative control 
was established very late and was not completely 
established in 1933. After she reached school age she 
just "could not he bothered" to attend to her personal 
habits until accidents happened. In any work she was 
given she was slow and apt to stop unless constantly re¬ 
minded of wh.pt she was to do. In her play she preferred 
to play with smaller children, and to make as little 
physical effort as possible. She was not quarrelsome. 

At her meals she would sit and gaze around, and it would 
take her half an hour to eat her breakfast. She woi 




< 






- 74 - 


tell lies, even with the contrary evidence before her, and 
showed no realization of the significance of her untruth¬ 
fulness. At times her untruthfulness had to do with untrue 
stories of what some other child had done. She had no chums, 
and seemed unable to make real friends. 

There is only one other child in the family, a boy 
who was thirteen years old in 1933 and in grade seven. He 
stood at the head of the class and was recognized as being 
clever. He was very high-strung and nervous. He has 
continued to do well in school, and has caused no particular 
concern to date. 

Clinic Examination ;- Physical and neurological 
examination gave essentially negative results. "E** was well 
developed and nourished. She was unusually tall for her age, 
being four feet eleven inches in height. For her height she 
was underweight, weighing 76j- pounds. 1 On tests of co¬ 
ordination she gave normal responses, although she was 
reported as clumsy and slow in her movements habitually. 

There wesome s ata, such as a very 
adherent ear lobes. 

A psychometric test gave TT R tT a mental age of nine 
years and seven months , and an intelligence quotient of 94. 
Co-operation on the test seemed good and responses were 
readily given, but there was some lack of spontaneity and 
interest. Basal mental age was eight years, with one item 
passed'at the twelve year mental level. 






- 75 - 


A diagnosis of "schizoid persona lity" was made. 

It was recommended that every effort be made to 
encourage n R" to overcome her bad habits, by explanation 
and example, and by encouraging her active participation 
in group and individual school activities, group and 
competitive sports activities, and similar nrojects. 

Developments :- n R M was placed in a very '*ood 
orphans f home in the late summer of 1934. This was done 
for several reasons* There had been no appreciable change 
in her general condition, and she was showing a tendency 
to brood a. good deal. She continued to play with smaller 
children, and the children of the school and district 
talked to her more than seemed proper about her mother, 
who was still in the mental hospital. At the home she 
could be under somewhat more constant supervision and the 
groups she was with could be controlled, to an extent. 

She was able to attend the school which was attached to 
the home itself. 

She began to show some improvement after the 
above change was made, although it was slow. In March, 
1935, she came to the clinic again for re-examination. 
Physically she had gained 8-J- pounds ' in weight and. four 
inches in height since November 1933. Her general 
physical condition was good. A psychometric re-test 
gave her an intelligence quotient of just 100, whereas 
before she had earned one of 94. She appeared more open 
and spontaneous in her personality reactions. In the

Home s h 

and had given no trouble soiling and wetting. She con¬ 
tinued to prefer smaller girls to play with, but did not 
try to dominate them. In her work she was inclined still 
to be absentminded and slow, but had dev loped more per¬ 
son tence. In school she was in grade five and doing fair 
work, although s he was considered backward, comparatively 
speaking. She was II" 1. lil he continued to 

think about ter mother, she did not brood, sqrtnueh about 
her. 

In the last two years the improvement has not been 
so marked as one would wish. TI R" is now 13-J- years old, and 
is practically grown up in a physical sense. Yet she is 
not making the use of either her physical or her mental 
powers that she miwht. She has advanced in her school 
grades and is now in grade seven, but her work is much 
poorer than it should be. ohe is inclines still to be 
amy and ore-occupied, slow in her work aid. her move- - 
, ' lacks the spontaneity and Initiativeness of 

the normal girl of her age. 

What will the outcome be? The outlook is not 
too - hopeful. n R n may be a hi e to carry on for a long 
time in a sheltered environment, but she map not be able 
to hold her own under the ordinary stresses and strains 
of life. What part in the picture did her early hem# 
life play? It cannot be said, with any degree of 
definiteness. It would appear that "R" did suffer from

e, but again it is difficult ' 1 

what part that played. 


Case No. X 
Male - Psychotic 

This is the case of a teen age boy who came to 
the clinic first in 'Nolumber 1935. The original' problem 
was that the patient was troubled with "queer ideas", and 
some bodily pains, particularly in his stomach. He was 
attending Technical School in his third year and was 
reported to be doing average or better work. There was 
no ^ nest ion of a ny me nt a 1 defi c i ency. 

Fang ly His tory :- No adverse heredity was elicited 
on either the father’s or the mother’s side, except that 
a maternal aunt is at present in a mental hospital - 
diagnosis - "Paranoid, paranoic condition - Paraphrenia". 

In fact, on the . 7 ' : e, the history indicated 

intellectual and economic cap a c ity with several out¬ 
standing ancestors. The mother is of English 
the father of Danish descent. 

The father died from cancer in 1929, at fifty years 
of a * - omi ng. He 

been married previously to marrying the patient’s mother. 
There were two children by the first union, both normal 
and he 1thy, and. both now grown up and doing well. 






- 78 - 


The mother was forty-four years old in. 1935, and 
healthy. She had been trained as a stenographer. 3he 
had been on relief for several years. 

The patient is the second of two children by the 
second marriage. The other child, a boy of eighteen years 
in 1935, was reported to be above average in intelligence, 
although he completed grade eight only. He took up.sign 
painting. 

• The mother’s marital life was rather unhappy. 

From the time the patient was six years old to the time 
he was twelve the home was broken up and the children 
were being looked after by the father. When the father 
died the mother took the children again. 

Personal History :- The patient’s birth and 
early'developmental history were normal. He had the 
usual childhood diseases, but no really serious illness. 

He was normally friendly with both boys and girls, and 
enjoyed social affairs. He was interested in sports. He 
danced a little and liked it. He was interested in model 
boat building and in radio construction. He was interested 
•in scouting and belonged to both the Boy Scouts and the 
Sea Scouts. 

.3 cho ol His to ry; - The patient began school at six 
years. He completed public school and was reported to have 
done very well. When he first came to the clinic he was 
attending Technical School, in his third year. His teachers 


at Technical School were included in his abnormal ideas, as 





- 79 - 


noted below. 

Case; - The ideas that the patient had in November 
1935 may be illustrated by the following. He thought that 
all his teachers were returned soldiers, and that they 
were all conspiring to protect a large treasure trove some¬ 
where in the North. The nature of this trove was not d is® 
closed. He thought for a time that the teachers were 
trying to get rid of him., because he knew about this 
treasure. Associated with this idea was one that nearly 
everyone was taking dope of some sort. He, himself, did 
not take dope. Other ideas were that he was somehow linked 
up with a large movement which included the Economic Bafety 
League. He had been a scout guard on the occasion of Baden- 
Powell’s visit to Alberta in the summer of 1935, and he 
thought that Baden-Powell had said "safety” to him. 

The physical health of the patient was good, and 
he was well developed. 

It was recommended that he be kept out of school 
for a time and given plenty of opportunity for rest, good 
food, and quietness. He improved quickly and was back to 
school again in a month. A note on February 3rd. 
states that "all abnormal mental symptoms had cleared up". 

The patient completed the 1935-36 school year, 
but failed'in four, subjects 

Mentally abnormal ideas were either absent or were too 
well covered up to be elicited. 










- 80 - 


Late in the Fall of 1936 ideas similar to those 
he ha & the previous year again he came’ ap;oa rent, and 
became so marked that hospitalization was thought 
advisable. He was a dmit ted t o the Pr ovincial I' ental 
Lcs pita 1 late in Oct ober, 1936,. In hosp ital his ideas 
persisted for some time, with some confusion apparent* 

He is still in Hospital but his condition is slowly 
clearing up. A diagnosis of "schizophrenia"- was ns s> 

It is difficult to say to v;hat extent this boy's 
presant condition is 1inked up with his Come life, b ut

oubl part. 

the cues tion of an economic adjustment looming up, 
following the school course. So far as could be found 
out, there were no particular stresses within the 
school itself. 

The prognosis is none too. good. With the history

CHAPTER IV 


CONCLUSIONS END SUGGESTIONS 

sufficient evidence t< T 

Mental Hygiene program in Alberta is proving beneficial 
to many. It it 

who mould benefit from the help that they might receive 
from the clinic services, were these available. Those 
who work with the clinics fully realize that the 
services that are offered at present are far from the 
boot that could be .offered. It the same time it is felt 
that the beginning made is a reasonably good one, and 
one that may serve as the basis for further extension of 
services. The present clinic personnel is too small for 
the best results, and at several clinic centers the 
possible contacts are too infrequent. In the present 
organization of the clinics the physician in charge has 
to make his clinic duties a lesser part of his whole 
work, thus preventing the study of cases which he may 
feel to be desirable.- This could be remedied by assign¬ 
ing a psychiatrist to the clinics on a full time basis, 
or by increasing the staff of physicians at tv ta 1 

institutions so that one or two of the doctors would be 
available for Mental Hygiene clinic work. There is 
excellent material available at present were the pressure 
of institutional work lessened. Alberta has been 
fortunate indeed in the caliber of the men who have been 


- 81 - 



- 82 - 


directing the mental health program for the Province. 

There is need for additional psychiatric social 
workers to make the clinic work more effective. In many 
instances outside investigational, and follow-up work 

ay dividends, but tt 

present. V.iti/the clinics already established more out¬ 
side contact work would bring the clinic services to 
more people. Then with an increase in personnel it 
would be possible to open clinics at other centers, 
again widening the field of service. But all of this 
k .ould cost money - which is ' ard to get. 

Another phase of the mental health pro.gram 
which might be widened is that of educating the people 
in mental health principles. An active program through¬ 
out the Province, working with, and through, welfare and 
service organizations already in existence would he 
beneficial. Talks could be given, problems could be 
discussed, and study could be directed if a personnel 
were available to do-the work. .A start along these 
lines has been made but much remains to be done. 

Extra-institutional work with ex-mental hospital 
patients is another avenue along which the mental health 
services could be expanded. There is no doubt that much 
more could be done than, is being done to assist patients 
leaving hospital to re-establish themselves, and to help 
them to maintain a satisfactory adjustment in the

community in which they live* It is a fact that a number 
of patients who leave a men ta 1 hos pit al recovered, or 
partially recovered, go out into the environment which 
helped to aggravate the initial mentally diseased con¬ 
dition, and there they are expected to carry on without 
further help. An investigation of the environmental con¬ 
ditions, and a quiet chat with those with whom the 
patient will come in constant contact could be of con¬ 
siderable value as an aid to re-adjustment, also, the. ex¬ 
patient would have an understand ing friend to turn to 
s hould th e need arise# 

Mental health and physical health are so closely 
bound together that it is impossible to separate them. 

Hence the value of co-ordinated efforts in the two 
sections of the one great field. It would not be 
difficult to set up a system whereby there could be kept 
a worth-while record of each individuals mental and 
physical health and adjustment, and his academic progress 
through the. most formative years of his life. This could 
be used as a basis on which to direct later life 
activities. How much happier and mors efficient t T. and E. 
of case II w,ould have been could they have been more wisely 
directed earlier in life. The mental health clinics have 
enough cases of rnal-adjustment and discontent to deal with 
to indicate the magnitude of the problem, and to indicate, 
as well, how much depends on the acquiring of the proper 




- - 


a11i tud e towards a type of w ork su i table for th e 
individual concerned. 

The work done under the Eugenics Board is very 
important and more investigation work could be carried 
out in regard to cases operated on and their subsequent 
a d j us trie n t. This c cu Id be d o ne v er y na tur ally t hr ou gh 
the Mental Hygiene clinics, fork of this kind will be 
more necessary now than previ ously, with the increased 
power given the Board under the recent amendments to 
the “Sexual Sterilization Act". 

The cases considered in Chapter III illustrate 
some of the problems that are to be solved in the lives 
of those in any community. The factors that help to ■ 
create these problems;are many and various. Cne factor 
that does play a big part is the home life of the 
individual. Those who have had the advantages of a 
stable family background and home life are more likely 
to meet life successfully than those who have not had 

and again it is found that 

trouble starts when the home is disrupted. The breaking 
up of the home, or serious disharmony in it has the 
effect of seriously shaking the childs feeling of 
security* When the child no longer feel that he ’belongs" 
in a stable, and to him a permanent, unit of society he 
is likely to do things that we consider anti-social. He

iapade that presents itself. Cr his reactions may have 

i y 

big enough and strong enough to stand up against others. 
Particularly v; ith tho se of limited intelligence the anti¬ 
social reactions maybe due in part to lack of ability to 
understand the seriousness of the trouble they may get 
into.. This holds true to a degree with all juveniles 
of course. With security gone there is often a lessening 
of self-confidence and self-respect which makes it easier 
for the juvenile to drift into bad company. Once assoc¬ 
iations of an undesirable kind are foimed they are hard to 
break, very often. 

The whole range of juvenile cases majr be divided 
into two groups on the basis of comparative intelligence - 

(1) those that are manifestly mentally deficient; and 

(2) these that are of normal or superior intelligence. 

With the first group the fact that intelligence is limited 
must be kept in mind, and must definitely limit the scope 
of the possibilities open. Additional intelligence c: not 
be supplied, additional capacity for judgment cannot be 
given, but additional training in suitable occupations 
and work can be given, and additional training "or the 
formation of good personal and social habits. /ith the 
beat of'efforts and the best of intentions the members 

of this group will continue to require help, supervision, 
and direction in grappling with many situations in life.

Many of them will become wholly, or in part, a State charge 
and responsibility. Many will fall into evil ways because 
they have not the judgment and power of inhibition to avoid 
these. Many will be used as tools by more intelligent 
human beings. And many will find a niche in life where they 
can carry on, happy in what they are able to do. 

The situation with regard to the second group is 
different. Here are children of normal, or better, 
intelligence, who have become mal-adjusted. The human 
material is of better quality and the problem is to insure 
that it will be put to better use. Many in this group can 
be rirected into courses that ill be beneficial to 
themselves and to the State. Some will continue to show 
mal-ad jus tment and will find themselves finally in a 
mental hospital. Others will manage to get along - full 
of .complaints and aches and pains. Others again will prey 
upon society using their intelligence to accumulate ill- 
gotten gains. What the end and product will be in each 
case is an open cuestion in many instances. But many can 
be helped to adjust in a way that is socially acceptable, 
and this is the fact that encourages those who work with 
such agencies as Mental Hygiene Clinics. 

Lastl}^, may a plea be made for the good home - 
the one unit in our society that can comhine. security, 
good training, proper habits, emotional balance, and all 
of those other factors that go to make men and women in

APPENDIX A. 

Tables XIV and XV show in condensed form the 
work done by the Eugenics Board for Alberta to the 
end of 1936, on the basis of the number of cases 
passed, and the number of operations done. Table 
XVI gives an analysis of the cases operated on on 
the basis of the mental disability suffered. Table 
XVI shows that of those operated on nearly two-thirds 
were mentally deficient with or without other 
complicating factors. In almost half of the cases 
operated on mental deficiency was without other 
complicating factor such as psychosis or epilepsy.
