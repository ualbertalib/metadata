ABSTRACT 


A series of trials were conducted during I9b0 
and 19bl to study the effects of temperature, as well as 
the effects of the nature of the germinating medium and 
of the duration of exposure, upon the germination of three 
open-pollinated and one hybrid varieties of sweet corn. 

The results indicated that germination of sweet corn seed 
was seriously inhibited by temperatures of 10°C. or lower, 
with no apparent difference between the effects of the 
lower temperatures. Germination in soil was lower than 
in sterile vermiculite, particularly at low temperatures, 
indicating that soil pathogens play an important role in 
limiting germination in cold soil. The duration of ex¬ 
posure was an important limiting factor only at the lower 
temperatures. Although significant varietal differences 
were observed, they could not be attributed to any differ¬ 
ences in cold resistance, but must be considered as being 
related to the viability, and possibly to the maturity, of 
the individual seed lots used.

INTRODUCTION 

Sweet corn is one of the most important of the 
canning crops grown in Southern Alberta, The acreage producing 
sweet corn is increasing annually, and is expected to increase 
sharply with the completion of the St, Mary’s Irrigation Develop¬ 
ment. It has also become Increasingly apparent that, in the near 
future, more canneries will be erected and go into production, in 
the area served by irrigation. In addition, the canning firms 
are considering the installation of quick freezing equipment to 
satisfy the ever increasing demand for fresh frozen fruit and 
vegetable products. This part of the processing industry Is 
still in its infancy and will, as it expands, require the pro¬ 
duction of an increasing volume of sweet corn. 

Growers and research workers alike have often ob¬ 
served that stands of sweet corn are poor in seasons when cold, 
wet soil conditions prevail during the germination period. These 
observations have led canning company fieldmen, farmers, and re¬ 
search workers to ask, ”Why should this be so? ,f ”Is the ability 
of the seed to germinate inhibited or destroyed by lot? soil temp¬ 
eratures?^ tf 0r, are attacks by soil pathogens ,* upon the elongat¬ 
ing coleoptiles, responsible for the reduction of the final stands 
in the field?” 

The species Zea mays L. is known generally to be a 
"warm season” plant, and thus Its development Is best under condi- 

* This term, as used in this thesis, refers to soil-borne 
pathogens.

tions of high summer temperatures. The reasons underlying poor 
germination at low temperatures are, however, little understood. 
The project, reported herein, was initiated to study the effects 
of exposure to low soil temperatures, in several media, upon the 
germination of certain varieties of sweet corn. It was hoped 
that the information gained would be useful in answering the 
above questions.

Meyer and Anderson (15) define germination of seeds 
as the resumption of active growth on the part of the embryo, re¬ 
sulting in the rupture of the seed coats and the emergence of 
the young plants. Environmental conditions conducive to normal 
germination include adequate moisture and oxygen, as well as a 
"suitable 11 temperature. The germination is also affected by 
varietal differences in vigor and speed of germination, by in¬ 
herent differences in embryo development, by the viability of 
the seed itself, and by the presence of insects and pathogenic 
micro-organisms in the soil. The above authors observe that the 
initiation of growth is essentially enzymatic in nature. Moist¬ 
ure and temperature are, therefore, important factors since both 
are required In optimum degree for the activation of enzymes. 
Seeds of most species of plants will germinate over a wide range 
of temperatures but maximum germination Is obtained at some in¬ 
termediate (optimum) temperature. Meyer and Anderson (15) state

that corn will germinate through a range of temperatures from b° 
or 10°C. to 4b°C. with an optimum of approximately oO°C., whereas 
wheat has a range from 0°G to 35°C. with an optimum between 15° 
and 20°C. 

Early work on the effect of temperature on the germ¬ 
ination of members of the grass family were conducted on wheat, 
oats, and barley - species which are known to tolerate relatively 
low soil temperatures. Investigations, conducted by Ylilson (2a), 
Wilson and Hottes (23), and Bell (l), ail conclude that small 
grain cereals will germinate satisfactorily at low temperatures 
(0° to 10°G.) with an optimum near 15° to 20°G. Wilson and Hottes 
(23) observed that above the optimum temperature the decrease in 
percentage germination of wheat was accompanied by an increased 
percentage of damage due to fungal activity* Coffman, as cited 
by Wilson and Hottes(23), observed that small grains will germ¬ 
inate at the temperature of melting ice. 

Jones (11) studied the effect of temperature on 
the germination of rice which, like sweet corn, is a warm season 
crop. He observed that some varieties germinated quite well 
after exposure in a moist condition to temperatures of 0°, 2°, 
and 5°C. for periods up to 36 days. 

Robbins and Petsch (18) studied the relationship of 
moisture content of the seeds and high temperature to the germ¬ 
ination of corn (flint and dent varieties were used). They ob¬ 
served that as the moisture content of the seed increased the 
percentage germination lowered markedly under low or high temperature

conditions. This is shown graphically in Figure 1. Low tempera¬ 
ture data were obtained from the studies of Kiesselbach and 
Ratcliff as reported by Robbins and Petsch (18). The low temp¬ 
erature data show a similar trend to that of high temperature 
data. 

Haskell (4) exposed selected flat and round seeds of each 
of six single-cross hybrids and one double-cross sweet corn hy¬ 
brid to a temperature of 10°0. for eight days. G-ermination was 
completed in a warm greenhouse. Although round seeds were 
heavier than the flat seeds there was no significant difference 
between germination rates. He suggested a differential behavior 
between hybrids. 

Haskell (5) seeded five inbred lines of sweet corn 
in flats of field soil, recently under com. One series of flats 
was placed in a cold room at 10°G., and the other series in an¬ 
other cola room at 5°C. The soil was kept moist as required. 

At intervals of from two to thirty-two days flats were removed 
from the cold rooms and germination rates were determined in a 
warm greenhouse. He observed that germination percentages were 
lower for the 10°G. temperature than for the lower temperature, 
and that the percentage became lower as the period of exposure 
lengthened regardless of germinating temperature. He states 
that the difference between the effects of the two temperatures 
suggest that the loss in germina'bility is due in part to cold, and 
in part to the penetration of soil pathogens into the slowly de¬ 
veloping seedling. He believes the pathogens to be parti}?* inhibited

at 5°G., and, therefore, more active at 10°C. In conclusion, 
he states that the, 5°C. treatment gives a truer picture of the 
resistance of the inbreas to cold, out that the 10°G. treatment 
is more critical and selective to other detrimental influences. 

Haskell (6) continuing his investigations, soaked 
the seeds of four sweet corn inbreds in water for periods vary¬ 
ing from 0 to 60 hours, and then exposed them for eight days at 
temperatures of 5°G. and 15°G. He noticed that pre-soaking the 
seeds did not alter their behavior to cold treatment although 
germination at the higher temperature was more rapid after pre- 
soakingo 

Haskell (7) seeded five inbred lines of sweet corn 
and one strain of hybrid dent corn in sand and soil, and exposed 
them to temperatures of 5°C. and 10°G. for varying periods of 
time. Germination was completed In a warm greenhouse. From 
the results the Investigator made the following conclusions: 

(a) The longer the period of exposure, the greater was the 
number of pre-emerged seedlings killed off; (b) Strains reacted 
differently to cold treatment; (c) Genetical constitution, temp¬ 
erature, exposure time, and the nature of the germinating medium 
all significantly affect the final germination; and (d) As an 
aid to plant breeding, the controlled cold treatment offers a 
suitable method for artifically selecting hardier strains of 
sweet corn. 

Haskell (8), in a field trial, seeded six varieties 
at 28 day intervals beginning on-March 1. He observed that as the

sowing dates became later the interval to flowering became 
shorter, and that maturity was directly proportional to flower¬ 
ing time. The size of ears was not materially affected by sowing 
date, although later sowings gave ears with higher numbers of 
rows. The earlier sowings produced plants which were shorter, 
with more tillers, and which produced slightly higher plant yields. 

Haskell and Singleton (9) seeded a number of inbred 
lines and hybrids of sweet and field corn in fiats which were ex¬ 
posed to 10°G. for 32 days, and then transferred to a warm green¬ 
house for completion of germination. The same lines were seeded 
outdoors in early April. In ail cases, outdoor germination per¬ 
centages were much higher than those from the cold rooms. Sweet 
corn lines were as cola hardy as the lines of field corn. The 
field corn hybrids germinated better than their parent lines, 
illustrating a possible effect of heterosis on cola hardiness. 

They conclude that the cold treatments can be used advantageously 
to supplement field trials for cold hardiness. 

Mather and Haskell (Id) observed, in England, that 
corn varieties germinate differently according to date of seed¬ 
ing. They selected hardy plants which survived early March sowing 
and, as the selected lines became hardier,, selections were made 
from February sowings. Two sweet corn varieties ana one dent 
variety increased their ability to germinate from February sowings, 
while Peruvian derivatives of sweet corn, used in the test, did not. 
The selected lines are to be tested for combining ability, and used 
as a basis for obtaining cold hardy sweet corn hybrids for the 
British Isles.

Pinnell (17), on the oasis of 10 years 1 laboratory 
anci field tests, concluded that double-cross corn hybrias gerra- 
inatea best at low temperatures, followed by single-cross hybrids 
and inbred lines in order. He observed that wide differences in 
the germination of inbred lines appeared to be heritable in crosses 
and that the female parent was more important than the male parent 
in determining seedling stands of single- and double-cross hybrids, 
indicating that this may be due to a form, of cytoplasmic inher¬ 
itance. 

Vander Meulen and Henke (Si) found cold testing of 
corn to be valuable in determining the effects or fungicides used 
for seed treatment. Fungicides, at best, protect good seed from 
destructive pathogens when germination is delayed due to cold, 
wet soils. Cold testing also emphasizes the importance of pro¬ 
per methods of seed production, handling, processing, and storage 
since mechanical damage would result in poor germination under 
adverse growing conditions by permitting soil pathogens to pene¬ 
trate the seed coat easily. 

Dickson and Herbert (2) found that corn seedlings 
grown at low temperatures (8° - 20°0.) are low in soluble carbo¬ 
hydrate building substances, and that the cell walls are composed 
largely of pentosan yielding substances. On the other hand, 
seedlings grown at high temperatures (24°C. and above) have 
large reserves of soluble carbohydrate building substances, and 
the cell wails are composed of cellulose impregnated with suberin. 
The latter are highly resistant to fungal penetration, while in the

former fungi are able to obtain nourishment directly from the 
cell wall and thus gain entry into the seedling, 

Tatum ana Zuber (20) reviewed the separate works 
of Meyer, Koehler, and Tatum, all of whom observed that germ¬ 
ination of corn seed was reduced when any amount of pericarp 
damage was present. Tatum had believed that minor injuries 
over the germ were as serious as more obvious damage to other 
parts of the kernel. Tatum and Zuber (20) found that low temp¬ 
erature alone did not decrease germination in sterilized soil, 
indicating that soil pathogens were responsible for the reduc¬ 
tion in germination. They emphasized the need for more careful 
handling of the seed. 

Lehenbauer (12) held corn seedlings at constant 
temperatures and concluded that the minimum growth temperature 
for corn was near 12°C. to 14°C. 

Erwin (3) observed that sweet corn seed germinated 
promptly when the soil temperature is approximately 12.78°0 o 
(55°F.), provided that other conditions were optimum. 

Rush and Neal (19) of Wisconsin, obtained corn seed 
which had been harvested at 10 day intervals, and exposed it to 
a temperature of 10°C. in soil for 14 days. They found that stands 
improved with the increase in maturity of the seed. On the other 
hand, seed harvested after a frost gave significantly lower germ¬ 
ination under cola test conditions than unfrosted seed which was 
not as advanced in maturity. These workers concluded that seed 
coat injury aid not appear to be of major significance in deter-

mining the stands of corn at low temperatures, and that Arasan 
treated seed gave better stands than untreated seed of the same 
maturity. 

Magoon and Culpepper (13), after a series of experi¬ 
ments conducted at different locations throughout the United 
States, concluded that the minimum air temperature required for 
development of sweet corn fell within a range of 50°F. to 60°F. 
(10°C. to lb.6°C.) and that this requirement varied with varieties 
and with strains within varieties. These investigators observed 
that the minimum soil temperature fell approximately 5°F. (£.78°C.) 
lower than the minimum air temperature. 

Mortimer (16), in studying the germinating ability 
of 36 reciprocal single crosses under adverse conditions found 
that 5b.b per cent of the single crosses showed significant dif¬ 
ferences between reciprocals, with the maternal parent playing 
the primary role in determining the differences. This agrees 
with the conclusions of Pinneli (17), already cited. 

MATERIALS Al-TD METHODS 

Four factors relating to the germination of sweet 
corn were considered in this study. These are reviewed briefly 
in the following paragraphs. 

(1) Temperature 

Controlled temperature chambers were available at the 
Science Service Laboratories, Lethbridge, Alberta for the field

trial carried out in 1950, and at the Food Processing Laboratory 
of the Experimental Station, Lethbridge, Alberta for the field 
and greenhouse trials undertaken in 1951. In both units, temper¬ 
atures of 5°0., 10°C., and 15°G. we re maintained throughout the 
period of exposure. At the University of Alberta during the 
winter of 1950-51 the above temperatures could not be duplicated, 
and the trial was carried out using temperatures of 35°F. (1„7°C.), 
50°F. (10°C.), and 65°F. (18.3°C.). 

(2) Germinating Medium 

The seed was sovia in 5 different media, (a) Leth¬ 
bridge brown silt loam from the horticultural area of the Ex¬ 
perimental Station, (b) Parkland black loan?from the Parkland 
Farm of the University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, and (c) 
Vermiculite, an inert mineral substance (heat expanded particles 
of mica) sold under the trade name of "Zonolite*. Neither of 
the soils had been used for the growing of corn for a number 
of years. 

(5) Duration of Exposure 

The seed yi&s exposed in each of the above media 
and at each of the above temperatures for periods of 10, 20, 
and 50 days duration. 

(4) Varieties 

Each of 5 open-pollinated sweet corn varieties 
(Altagold, Dorinny, and Golden Early Market) and 1 sweet corn 
hybrid (Carmelcross) were subjected to all combinations of the 
above factors.

In the controlled temperature chambers, the seed 
was sown in the flats and covered with approximately one inch 
of the appropriate medium. The media were kept moist as re¬ 
quired. Seeding was done at 10 day intervals so that all ex¬ 
posure periods would be completed at the same time, e.g. the 
30 day exposure was sown first, followed 10 days later by the 
20 day exposure, etc. 

After the exposures were completed the flats were 
removed from the controlled temperature chambers and transferred 
to the field or to a greenhouse for completion of germination. 
When transferred to the field, the seeds were removed from the 
flats and set into the soil at approximately the same depth as 
they were in the flats. 

Experimental design 

The trials were set up in a split plot design, 
with 4 replications. Each replication consisted of 9 whole 
plots (each flat made up a single whole plot) made up of all 
combinations of the 3 temperatures and the 3 media, as follows:

The position of these whole plots was at random within each 
replication, whether in the greenhouse or in the field. The 
"Whole plots were also randomized in the controlled temperature 
chambers.

Each of the whole plots consisted of IS sub-plots 
(rows) made up of all combinations or the 3 exposure periods 
and the 4 varieties, as follows:

The position of the sub-plots within each whole 
plot was at random, with a different randomization in each 
case. Each sub-plot (row) consisted of S3 seeds. In order 
to facilitate setting out, the sub-plots were transferred to 
the field in the same rotation as they appeared in the flats. 

The sub-plots, in the field, became single 25 foot rows spaced 
3 feet apart, and with the seeds placed at intervals of approx¬ 
imately 1 foot. 

The arrangement of the whole plots within one 
replication in the field is shown diagramatieally in Figure 2, 
while the arrangement of the sub-pLots within a single whole 
plot is illustrated in Figure 3<, 

Lie t hods of Go fleeting Data 
According to Meyer and Anderson (15), germination 
is completed with the rupture of the seed coat and the emergence 
of the young plant. For the purpose of this study, germination 
was considered to be complete when one prominent seedling leaf 
had emerged from the coleoptile, above the surface of the medium.

In the greenhouse trials, counts of all the 
emerged, seedlings were made when it had been ascertained that 
no further germination would take place* The vigor of the seed¬ 
lings was also recorded. 

For the field trials, seedling counts were made 
before the material was transferred to the field and again when 
it was certain that no more seeds would germinate. It may be 
noted here that the germination of seed exposed at 15°0. was 
almost complete when the transfer to the field was made. It 
was, therefore, necessary to transplant all the emerged seed¬ 
lings. As a result, considerable losses were incurred and final 
stands were often lower than the Initial germination. The final 
stands and the initial germination were compared and the higher 
figure oi the two was taken to be the final germination. 

Data were also collected regarding the maturity of 
the numerous sub-plots. These data were based upon the dates 
on which 50 per cent of the plants had completed silking. 

No yield data were collected because of frost damage 
to the entire plot area before the varieties had matured sufficiently, 

Methods of Analysing the Data 
The data were analysed to determine the effects of 
the different factors by means of the analysis of variance. The 
significance of all main effects was determined and Least Signi¬ 
ficant Differences were calculated where the F values obtained 
were significant.

Separate analyses were computed, for the separate 
trials. The results of the trials could not be combined be¬ 
cause of certain dissimilarities, namely, the greenhouse trials 
were exposed at different temperatures and only one field trial 
was successfully carried out, due to weather conditions that are 
discussed later. 

All data were recorded as percentages and it was 
necessary to transform them using the angular transformation 
(percentage = sin 2 0) as laid out by Hayes and Immer (10). The 
relationship of angles (in degrees) to percentages is illus¬ 
trated in Appendix V. 

C1imatic Influ ences 

In 1950, the transfer to the field was made Into 
relatively dry soil under warm weather conditions. The entire 
plot area was sprinkled with approximately one Inch of water 
immediately after the transfer to the field had been completed, 
giving excellent conditions for tne completion of germination. 

In 1951, on the other hand, the transfer was made 
under decidedly adverse soil and weather conditions. The soil 
was very wet and low temperatures persisted for an extended 
period. On the fourth day after the transfer was made (lune 26) 
a heavy snowfall occurred. The plots were left for approximately 
one month and after close observation it was considered that the 
cold and snow had nullified the effect of the previous temperature 
treatments, as no treatment differences were apparent, As a re¬ 
sult or this careful Inspection, It was decided to abandon the 
trial.

Greenhouse temperatures were relatively low during 
the time that the seeds were undergoing completion or germination. 
As a result, germination was rather slow. The temperatures could 
not be altered because or the presence or other plants which 
would not tolerate the higher temperatures. 

RESULTS 

The results or this project rail logically into 
3 separate phases, namely the Field Trial 1950, Greenhouse 
Trial 1950-51, and the Greenhouse Trial Fall 1951, Fach of 
these phases will be discussed individually 0 

Field Trial 1950 

General views of the plot area are shown in 
Figures 4, 5, and 6. 

Under near ideal soil and weather conditions, 
germination progressed rapidly after the seed had been trans¬ 
ferred to the field. On the other hand, plants which had been 
transplanted showed very little progress for about 10 days, after 
which time growth was quite rapid. Plants, from the lower temp¬ 
erature treatments, were generally shorter than those from the 
15°C. treatment. There was no consistent difference in the number 
of tillers per plant and the smaller plants appeared to be as 
healthy as the larger plants. 

At silking time no consistent differences in maturity 
could be defected between treatments within varieties. There were

however, normal variations between early and. midseason varieties. 
No yield data were realized. 

Table 1 lists the mean germination rates for all 
treatments (converted from percentages to degrees). Each fig¬ 
ure is the mean of 4 replications. An analysis of variance 
(Appendix I) was computed for the complete data, and certain 
treatment effects were observed to be significant. 

The rate of germination of sweet corn was signi¬ 
ficantly affected by the temperatures to which the seed had 
been exposed, as illustrated in Table S.

It may be observed in Table 4 and Figure 16 that the germina¬ 
tion rate dropped to a greater extent from lb°C. to 1U°C., and 
b°G. in soil than it did in Vermiculite. It is interesting to 
note, at this point that the germination In Parkland Soil was 
lower at 10°G. than at 5°C. 

Germination was significantly affected by the dura¬ 
tion of exposure, as illustrated In Table b. The 50-day ex¬ 
posure produced a significantly lower germination rate than 
the 10-day exposure. The germination rate for the 20-day 
exposure period was intermediate between the longer and shorter 
exposures but did not differ significantly from either 0

The significance of the interaction bet ween, the 
duration of exposure and temperature indicates that the effect 
of temperature was differentially affected by the duration of 
exposure. The mean germination rates are tabulated in Table 6, 
and the effect is illustrated graphically in Figure 17. The 
graph shows how germination at lb°C. was only slightly reduced 
as the duration of exposure increased, whereas germination at 
the two lower temperatures was reduced sharply under similar 
conditions.

than Gplaen Early Market but no actual difference was detected 
between Altagold, Carmelcross, and Dorinny.

A differential effect of media upon the germination 
of the varieties is indicated in the significance of the inter¬ 
action between varieties and media. The relationship is illus¬ 
trated graphically in Figure 18, and the mean germination rates 
are listed in Table 8. As may be observed in Figure 18, all 
varieties germinated very well in Vermiculite, while in the two 
soils germination is reduced in varying degrees according to 
variety.

The interaction between durations of exposure and 
media was significant to the five per cent level indicating 
that the effect of media was altered somewhat by the duration 
of exposure. Figure 19 shows that the germination rate in 
Yermiculite fell more slowly than in soils as the duration of 
exposure was increased zo BO days. However, when the duration 
of exposure was increased, still further, to 30 days the germ¬ 
ination rate in Yermiculite fell more rapidly. The mean rates 
are presented in Table 9. 

The interaction between varieties and temperatures 
was not significant indicating that the varieties were not dif¬ 
ferentially affected by temperature. This is well illustrated 
in Figure BO where it can be seen that the curves for varieties 
are nearly parallel to one another. There was, therefore, no 
difference in the response of the varieties to the different 
temperatures.

Greenhouse Trial 1900-51 


As previously noted., this trial was conducted at 
temperatures of 1.7°C., 10°C., and 18.3°0. The analysis of 


variance was computed in the same manner as for the 1950 Field 
Trial, and is shown in Appendix II. Table 10 lists the mean 
germination rates for all treatments, each figure being the 
mean of the four replications. 

Temperatures were again found to cause highly sig¬ 
nificant differences in the germination rates of sweet corn. 
Table 11 shows that the germination rates for 1.7°G. and 10°C. 
were significantly lower than that for 18.3°C., but did not 
differ significantly from one another.

for temperatures. Greenhouse Trial 1950-51

Differences in germination rates between the different 
media did not prove to be significant in this trial (F - 5.10). 

The significance of the interaction between temperature 
and media indicated that media altered the effects of temperature 
in a differential manner, as shown in Table 12 and in.Figure 22.

Figure 22 illustrates that germination at l o 7°0. 
and 18*5°C. are proportional in their relationship, but that 
at 1G°C. germination was much higher in Vermiculite than in 
the two soils. 

The duration of exposure, in itself, did not signi¬ 
ficantly affect germination although there was a differential 
effect of the duration of exposure upon activity of temperatures, 
as indicated by the significance of the interaction between 
duration of exposure and temperature, ns shorn in Figure 25, 
the duration of exposure did not greatly affect the germination 
rates at 18.3°C., and only slightly decreased the rates at 10°0. 
However, at l o 7°0. the germination rate was reduced sharply as 
the duration or exposure was increased. Mean germination rates 
for the combined factors are listed in Table Is.

There was no real difference between the germinating ability 
of Altagold and Golden Early Market. 

In this trial, as in the 1950 field trial, no 
significance (3? = 1.11) was obtained for the interaction 
between varieties and temperatures. It is clearly illustrated 
in Figure SI that the effects of the temperature treatments upon 
the different varieties were-almost identical. 

Greenhouse Trial - Fall 1951 

This greenhouse trial was conducted under identical 
temperature conditions to the 1950 field trial, except that 
germination was completed in a greenhouse. The mean germina¬ 
tion rates for all treatment combinations are listed in Table 
15, and the completed analysis of variance is tabulated in 
Appendix III. 

The effects of the various treatments are illus¬ 
trated photographically in Figures 28 - 84. The plants from 
the 15°0. treatment were severely etiolated and were not 
photographed. 

As in the two previous trials, temperatures were 
responsible for highly significant differences in the germina¬ 
tion rates of sweet corn. In Table 16 it may be observed that 
both the 5°0. and 10°G. temperatures produced significantly 
lower germination rates than did the 15°C. temperature, while 
no real difference could be detected between the effects of the 
two lower temperatures.

Media, too, produced highly significant differences 
in the rates of germination. As illustrated in Table 17, germ¬ 
ination rates were significantly lower in Lethbridge and Parkland 
Soils than that obtained for Vermicuiite. There was no apparent 
difference between the effects of the two soil types.

The interaction between temperature and media was 
again highly significant, indicating a differential effect of 
temperature in different media. In Table 18 and Figure £4 it 
may be observed that the germination rate dropped more markedly 
from 15°G. to 10°C. in the two soils than in the Vermicuiite medium. 

The duration of exposure, alone, was not found to 
have any significant effect upon the germination rate (Table 19j, 
but its interaction with temperature was highly significant, in¬ 
dicating that the duration of exposure affected the reaction of 
the seed to the temperature treatments. Table £0 and Figure £5. 
illustrate how germination at 5°G. dropped sharply as duration 
of exposure lengthened, while at 10°G. germination dropped 
slightly after £0 days exposure and then increased rather sharply 
after 50 days exposure.

Significant differences were also observed between 
the germinating ability of the four varieties in the trial 
(Table El). Altagold germinated significantly better than any 
of the other three varieties, while Dorinny germinated at a 
significantly lower rate than tile other three. No difference 
between the germination rates of Garmelcross and Golden Early 
Market could be established.

varieties responded similarly to temperature treatment. The 
graph in Figure 26 bears this out more emphatically. 

The nature of the germinating medium significantly 
influenced the germination of the different varieties. Table 
23 and Figure 27 shows that the reduction in germination in 
soils, as compared to vermiculite, was greatest for the variety 
Carmelcross and least for AltagoId. termination of Carmelcross 
was reduced by nearly two-thirds, that of Altagold by approx¬ 
imately one-third, and those of Dorinny and Golden Early Market 
by approximately one-half.

Temperature again caused significant differences 
in the germination of sweet corn. Mean germination rates for 
the different germinating temperatures are listed in Table 24. 
Applying the least significant difference it is observed that 
germinal:ion was significantly reduced with each decrease in 
germination temperature.

Varieties differed significantly (F - 40.47 44) in 
their germinating ability, and, as before, the germination at 
the different temperatures was differentially affected by the 
duration of exposure, (F - 25.59 4v) . The interaction between 
varieties and temperatures was again insignifleant (F - 2.18) 
verifying the observation that the varieties did not react 
differently to temperature treatment.

discussion or results 


Tiie germination ofaveet corn was significantly 
reduced, by the.lowering of the soil temperature from 15°C* 
to lu°C. There was, however, no significant reduction in 
germination when the temperature was reduced from 10°G o to 
5°C♦ or 1.7°G. It is apparent, therefore, that the minimum 
temperature, at which germination and growth of sweet corn 
will take place actively, is above 10°C. and below 15°C. 

Similar observations were recorded by Lehenbauer (12), Erwin 
(3), and Magoon and Culpepper (13), The results of this ex¬ 
periment indicate that the temperature range used was too wide 
to determine a minimum growth temperature, although the lower 
temperatures might be used satisfactorily in evaluating the 
cold hardiness of inbred lines of sweet corn, as recommended 
by other workers (5, 7, 9, 16, 17, 18). Further studies are 
planned in which a range of temperatures between 10°G. and 15°G. 
will be used to determine the minimum growth temperature of sweet 
corn. In the 1950 Field Trial,.it was observed that the mean 
germination rate at 10°C. was slightly lower than the mean germ¬ 
ination at b°G. (Figure 16 and Table 2). This relationship was 
most pronounced in the case of seed germinated in Parkland Soil 
(Table 4). Haskell (5) recorded similar results. As an assump¬ 
tion, one might feel that the Parkland Soil supported the largest 
population of harmful parasitic organisms, and these might log¬ 
ically be more active at the higher temperature. The greenhouse 
trials failed to confirm the above observations, resulting in 
rather inconclusive results on this point *

That the nature of the germinating medium affected 
the germination of sweet corn, as reported by Haskell (7), was 
confirmed in the trials reported in this paper, termination in 
the soils was much lower than it was in sterile vermiculite. 

This was particularly true at the two lower temperatures, as 
illustrated in Figures 16, £S, and E4. These observations sug¬ 
gest strongly that the reduction of germination in soils at low 
temperatures is, as reported by Haskell (5), due partly to the 
direct effects of cold and partly to the detrimental effects of 
soil pathogens. The seed exposed to the 10°C. temperature 
showed a greater incidence of moulded kernels than did the seed 
exposed to 5°C. Where only the germination in vermiculite was 
considered (Table S4) germination was reduced progressively as 
temperatures became lower, with greatest reduction from 10°C. 
to 5°C. It is, therefore, logical to assume (as indicated 
earlier) that the reduction in germination at 5°C. is due, 
largely, to the destruction of the embryo by direct effect 
of cold, and at 10°C. by. the penetration of soil pathogens into 
the damaged seeds and slowly developing coleoptiles. 

Since the duration of exposure to controlled temp¬ 
eratures was found to be significant in only one trial, it must 
be assumed that it was not important, in itself, in determining 
stands. It did, however, appear to bear a significant relation 
to stands at the lower temperatures, as illustrated in Figures 
17 and S3, where marked decreases were observed as the duration 
of exposure lengthened. Haskell (5, 7) recorded similar results

Other workers (5, 7, 9, 16, 17) have reported that 
inbred lines and hybrids react differently to cold treatment, 
with some inbreds being more cold resistant than others. They 
observed, too, that the hybrids generally possessed greater 
cold resistance than their parent lines. In this project, sig¬ 
nificant differences were obtained between varieties in all trials. 
The same varieties did not always occupy the same position in re¬ 
lation to high or low germination. When compared under the dif¬ 
ferent temperature treatments, it 'was observed that all varieties 
reacted similarly to each temperature within a trial {Figures 20, 
21, and 26). It appears logical to conclude that varieties dif¬ 
fered only as the relative germinating ability of the lots of 
seeds differed. The differences could be explained on the basis 
of maturity, as has been discussed by Rush and Heal (19). The 
similarity of the reactions of all varieties to temperature 
treatment may be due, to some extent at least, to the fact that 
all were varieties requiring a relatively short growing season. 

A late season variety, such as lochief, Lincoln, or Lee, may 
have reacted differently to cold treatment. 

On the basis of the.maturity data obtained from 
the 1950 Field Trial, it was not possible to distinguish any 
differences in maturity as affected by germination, temperature 
and/or duration of exposure, within a variety. There was some 
variation in date of silking but this was not consistent for 
each treatment. It seemed reasonable to assume that sweet corn 
germinated at 15°G. would mature earlier than that germinated at 
the lower temperatures because plants were better developed at

planting out time. These plants suffered a severe setback, as 
mentioned earlier, and at silking time were at the same stage 
of maturity as those germinated at the lower temperatures. If 
the seed had been sown in plant bands it is probable that the 
transfer might have been made without serious injury to the 
seedlings, thus making for a more reliable field trial. 

The plants grown from seed germinated at lb°C 8 
were somewhat taller than those germinated at the lower temp¬ 
eratures. Similar differences were observed by Haskell (8) 
who noted also that the taller plants produced fewer tillers 
and lower plant yields than the shorter plants. In the pro¬ 
ject, reported herein, there was no apparent difference in 
the number of tillers on the plants from the different temp¬ 
erature treatments. Unfortunately, no harvest was realized 
and no comparison could be made of the effect of temperature 
treatment upon yield.

AJilIAPY 

1. A series of trials were conducted during 1950 and 1951. 

The effects of the following factors, upon the germination 
of three open-pollinated varieties (Altagold, Dorinny, and 
Golden Early Market) and one hybrid (Carmelcross) of sweet 
corn, were studied: 

(a) Controlled temperatures - 5°C., 10°C., and 15°C. (except 
in one trial when 1.7°C., 10°C., and 18.3°U. were used); 

(b) Germinating media - Yermiculite, Parkland boil, and 
Lethbridge Soil; 

(c) Duration of exposure - 10, SO, and 50 days. 

£, Each trial was laid out as a split-plot factorial. 

3. The percentage data were transformed by means of the angular 
transformation and were analysed statistically. 

4. Highly significant differences were observed between the 
highest temperature treatment and the io?jer ones in each 
trial. This was more pronounced in soils and under dif¬ 
ferent durations of exposure. 

5. Germination was significantly better in Yermiculite than 
in either of the soils used. 

6. The duration of exposure was important only at the two lower 
temperatures of each trial, when increased exposure caused 
significant reductions in germination. 

7. The germination rates of the different varieties differed 
significantly, out all reacted similarly to temperature 


treatment

GONGLUJlQNS 

The following observations have been made on the 
basis of the results obtained from the experiments described 
elsewhere in this thesis: 

1. Temperatures of 10°C. or lower caused significant reductions 
in the germination of sweet corn. There was no apparent 
difference between the effects upon germination of 10°G. 
and of the lower temperatures studied. 

2. Germination in soil ?ms significantly lower than in sterile 
vermiculite, particularly at the lower temperatures, indicat 
ing the importance of soil.pathogens in limiting the stands 
of sweet corn at low temperatures. This could be overcome, 
to some extent, by seed treatment. 

3. The overall effect of duration of exposure did not appear 
to be important in determining the stands of sweet corn. 
However, when considered in relation to temperature, the 
duration of exposure had a highly significant effect, caus¬ 
ing markedly reduced germination at the lower temperatures 
but not at 15°C. 

4. Varieties were found to differ significantly in their 
ability to germinate. None showed any differential effect 
due to temperature treatment or to duration of exposure. 

The differences observed must be considered to be related 
to the viability and to possible differences in maturity 
of the several seed lots used.
