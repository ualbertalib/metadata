CHAPTER I 


THE NATURE AND PURPOSE OP THE INVESTIGATION 
The following investigation in General Science and Health 
Education is based on the Pinal Examinations conducted in June 
1940. Every twentieth paper was selected from the four largest 
cities of Alberta, namely: Edmonton, Calgary, Lethbridge and 
Ledicine Hat. This sample comprises one hundred fifty papers. 
Another sample of one hundred fifty papers was taken from the 
towns and leading villages, namely: Beverly, Big Valle:/, Blairmore 
Camrose, Cardston, Coleman, Edson, Grande Prairie, Hanna, High 
River, Lacombe, Macleod, Magrath, Ponoka, Raymond, Redcliffe, Stet 
tier, Taber, Vegreville, Vermilion, etc. A third sample of one 
hundred fifty papers represents the rural school population of 
Alberta. These four hundred fifty Pinal Examination papers in 
General Science and Health Education were obtained from, the High 
School Entrance Examination Board, the Department of Education. 

The purpose of this investigation is to discover the extent 
to which a student in the Intermediate School applies the General 
Principles he has studied earlier to the solving of new problems. 

The question arises: Are we, the teachers of this province, 
creating the right attitude towards problem solving; are we in¬ 
structing in scientific investigation; or are we teaching simply 
a collection of scientific facts that are to be memorized by the 
students for the final examination in June? The following figures 
and graphs speak for themselves.

Further, the author has made a careful analysis of our modern 
textbooks and curricula in General Science for the Intermediate 
School grades. 

The introduction to General Science in our Programme of 
Studies reads as follows: 


The process of thinking from facts to the solution of a 
problem is the scientific method. Techniques are but superficial 
aspects of education. Nevertheless, it is desirable that certain 
procedures become habitual to the students. The following steps 
of an experiment, from Useful Science, are reproduced with the per¬ 
mission of the publishers. The John C. Winston Co.: 

1. Question or Problem: The question that we are asking 
nature. What we wish to find out. 

2. Materials: The things needed to make the experiment. 

3. Manipulation or Method: What we shall have to do with the 

materials to find the answer to the question. 

4. Observation: What happens as a result of what was done. 

5. Diagram or Sketch: A neat, simple drawing showing the 
method used to solve the problem. 

6. Conclusion: The answer to the question. What our method 
and our observations have shown us to be true. 

7. Practical Application: Most of our experiments will have 

a direct application to everyday life. These applications 
in many cases we can see for ourselves; in other cases, 
we need to have them explained. 


Our environement is of two kinds: fixed and changing. The 
Laws in science are relatively fixed and should be learned as 
quickly and completely as possible. In order to interpret our 
changing environment, students must be prepared to think, and be 
able to find the most recent facts on which to base their thinking. 
They should be able to recognize certain integrating themes: as 
space, time, change, adaptation, interrelationships, and variety. 
Around such themes as these, teachers must correlate the various 
fields of the special sciences, under the heading "General Science 11 


Dr. Thomas 3riggs states that the method of approach in 
General Science may well be through the avenue of questioning, or 
"naive questions": 

1. "What is it?" 

Satisfies curiosity and leads to more significant questions 

2. "What is it for?" 

General Science should not only answer this question, but 
extend it beyond what the student without direction could 
possibly perceive. 

3. "How does it work?" 

Satisfies and extends curiosity so that a desire and need 
are felt for something more.

4. "Can I work it?" 

Psychology has taught us to recognize the satisfaction 
that comes from activity and from feeling oneself a cause, 

5. "What causes it to work?" 

Principles should grow out of acquaintance with phenomena. 
Numerous applications should stamp them into memory and 
insure wide usefulness. 

6. "What further application has this principle than is now 
known? " 

This leads to invention. Such a question is afrked only 
by advanced thinkers. 

While learning is unitary, for purposes of clarifying thought 
we may analyse it into the kinds of changes in students which may 
be stimulated through science teaching; such as the following: 

1. Forming and understanding concepts; as, - 

"Most substances change state by absorbing or releasing 
energy." 

a. Concepts should be achieved through a rich experience 
with natural phenomena which may contribute to them. 

b. Experiences should be so motivated that ideas resulting 
therefrom are continually associated into broader and 
more meaningful relationships. 

2. Development of careful and critical methods of thinking. 

There are at least six habits which characterize such 
thinking. They are the following: 

a. Habit of accuracy in all ox)erations, including calcula¬ 
tion, observation, and report. 

b. Habit of intellectual honesty. This is the habit of 
sticking to the facts and admitting error when proved. 

c. Habit of open-mindedness. This means a willingness to 
consider new facts. 

d. Habit of criticsm, including self-criticsm. 

e. Habit of looking for true cause-and-effeet relationships. 
Here the prevalent superstitions are subjected to search¬ 
ing analysis. 

f. Habit of suspended judgment. This is looking for all 
pertinent data before making a decision. 

3. Changes in overt behavior, 

a. Science education should replace action based on fear 

of natural processes with action based on understanding. 

b. Care of trees, forests and grasslands should be promoted 
by understanding of the balance of nature and the con¬ 
sequences of disturbing that balance. 

These are but two of the many desirable changes in be¬ 
havior that science education can promote. 

4. Development of specific attitudes, interests and appre¬ 
ciations. Those which are most valuable will grow only 
when the teacher plans consciously for their develop¬ 
ment ,

5. Development of an adequate and intelligent philosophy of 
life. In past times the idea of a flat earth was satis¬ 
factory. Later the idea of a spherical earth was needed. 
Today we must have an idea of a vast universe in order to 
have an adequate frame of reference for our thinking. 

The teacher 1 11 s function is to plan and direct rich experiences 
for his students. Through these he may influence the forming of 
concepts, the thinking that is done, the changes in behavior, the 
attitudes and appreciations developed, and the modifications in 
the student*s philosophy of life. 

This course should not develop in to note-giving course. The 
revising committee would discourage the use of manuals, helps, etc 
in the hands of the students. Pupil growth through teacher growth 
is an ideal at which we must aim. Pupils should be encouraged to 
take inventory of the work accomplished, and set down in sentence 
form the outstanding fundamental facts deduced from observation, 
experimentation, and reading. Well planned laboratory work, pro¬ 
perly organized field trips, the use of library facilities, and 
open forum discussions are of far greater importance in the pre¬ 
sentation of General Science than are lectures and demonstrations 
by the teacher. 

No textbook has been authorized for the use of Grade IX 
students. However, the teachers may recommend that their students 
purchase oneof the following books for use as a textbook: 

1. Understanding Our Universe (Interpreting Science Series, 
Hook III): Franklin B Carroll. 

2. Our Environment - How We Use and Control It, Book III: 
Carpenter and Wood, 

3. Everyday Problems in Science: Pieper and Beauchamp. 

4. Book of General Science: Hilton. 

The following books are recommended as reference books for 
the use of pupils: 


1. Science (The Story of Progress and Discovery): Davis and 
Sharpe. 

2. Science Problems, Book 3: Beauchamp, Mayfield and West. 

3. The March of Science, Book III: Hunter and Whitman. 

4. Man’s Control of His Environment, Book III: Powers, Beuner 
and Bruner. 

5. Science in Our World of Progress, Book III: Hunter and 
Whitman. 

6. Useful Science for High School: Weed, Eexford and Carroll. 

7. Science Indoors and Out, Book III: Hensley and Patterson. 

8. General Science for Today: Watkins and Bedell, 

9. Conquering the World of Science: Bida. 

10. The Science of Everyday Life: Vanbuskirk and Smith. 

11. Living in a World of Science, Books I and II: Meister.

At the conclusion of the examinations, all the candidates* 
papers from the different schools of the Province are forwarded 
to the Edmonton Normal School where the Department of Education 
has them read. The examiners are a number of selected teachers 
from all parts of the Province who are familiar with the parti¬ 
cular subject they are to mark, 

before the envelopes are passed on to the examiners to be 
opened and read, the name slip on each envelope is removed and 
the candidate is given a number. This number is stamped on all 
the envelopes that the candidate has handed to the presiding 
examiner. To the reading examiner, the candidate is known only 
by the number on the envelope. 

The author is an instructor of General Science at the 
McCauley Intermediate School, Edmonton, and was one of a group 
of thirty-six examiners in General Science and Health Education 
at the Edmonton Normal School in July 1940, 

The expression Towns, also Towns and Villages shall mean 
Town and Village Districts. The word Cities shall mean City 
Districts, and Rural shall mean Rural Districts, 

The three following tables list the numbers which appear on 
the papers that were selected for this investigation. Each table 
shows the numbers of one hundred fifty papers that constitute the 
sample for one group of the investigation,

CHAPTER II 


GENERAL SURVEY OF THE INVESTIGATION 

Percentile Rank, Median Score, and Standard Deviation .-- 
Tables V to XIV show the Percentile Rank of each cnadidate, the 
score for each part of the student’s paper, his total score, the 
deductions for misspelled words (ten being the limit), and the net 
total score. The total possible score is 190. 

Table XV shows the frequencies of the students for certain 
percentile ranks in each of the four cities, in all of the city 
districts, in all the town and village districts, in all the rural 
districts, and finally the grand total. 

It will be noticed that in the city districts more students 
have a high percentile rank than a low one; while in the rural * 
districts, more students have a low rank. The trend for the town 
and village districts’ curve is half way between the other two, 
as figure 3 indicates. 

Tables XVI, XVII and XVIII show the frequencies of the stu¬ 
dents for the different scores, and the MEDIAN SCORES for the city, 
town, and rural districts. The MEDIAN SCORE for the city districts 
is 96.28; for the town and village districts, it is 84,82; and for 
the rural districts, it is 7b.36, The MEDIAN SCORE for the town 
and village districts is 9.5 points higher than that for the rural 
districts; while the MEDIAN SCORE for the city districts is 11.5 
points above that of the town and village, districts. 

Table XIX gives 85.7 as the MEDIAN SCORE for the whole pro¬ 
vince, It will be noticed that this provincial median score 
almost corresponds with that of the town and village districts.

Table XX gives us the STANDARD DEVIATION for the Province. 
Sigma (0 ) is 22.1 scale units. Since the curve is symetircal, 
the Mean and Median would be the same; then two thirds of the 
students obtained scores between 63.6 (85.7 - 22.1) and 107.8 
(85.7 - 22.1). One sixth of the students have scores above 107.8; 
while the other sixth of the students have soores between 63.6 and 
30. The upper limit is 150.

- 2.21 class intervals. 

I 22.1 scale units, 
the Province of Alberta is 



2.21 class intervals or 22.1 scale units. This means that two 
thirds of the student population obtained a score between sixty 
and one hundred ten; with one sixth above one hundred ten, and 
one sixth below sixty. The lower limit being thirty and the 
upper limit,one hundred fifty. 















CHAPTER III 


HEALTH EDUCATION 

With the exception of the first question, the Health part of 
the paper is well answered. For question one, most of the candi¬ 
dates received a score of three out of ten as figure 6 indicates. 

Not one in the Province obtained the full score. The reason may 
be that the question goes beyond the plan in the programme of Health 
Education. Question one seeks to test the validity of assumed cor¬ 
relation as between Health Education and General Science. Unit 
three in the programme of studies has to do with, "what to do", not 
why it is done. Figure 7 shows that very few received full value 
for the different parts of the question. 

Question two, according to figures 8 and 9, is a type of 
question that the students like; no one received a score belov; 
four and a few obtained the full ten marks* The full values for 
the different parts of this question are quite high as compared 
with the half values, see figure 8. 

The reason for the low full values for part "e" may be due to 
the poor wording of the question. It reads: ’’Food poisoning is 

most commonly caused by "(l) eating.............tins”; 

(2) "eating.(3) "eating........etc". 

Does the question ask what causes food poisoning? 

The frequency distribution curves in figure 10 show character¬ 
istic trends of the three groups. The curve of the city districts 
sags where the scores are low and is high for the larger scores. 

The red curve of the rural districts runs the very opposite to 
that of the city districts; it is high where the scores are low 
and sags at the other end. The curve of the town and village 

districts lies between the other two.

Question three is stated in a rather academic way. "Taking 
part in games and sports gives one a better mental outlook on life." 
It neither follows nor may be assumed that participation in games 
and sports "gives” a better mental outlook. Other strong factors 
have also to be considered. Sections (b) and (c) simply test very 
useful information. 

question four is a general review, some items of which go 
back to Grade VII, others to Grade VIII work in Health Education. 
This objective set-up makes a hit with students who do not indulge 
in too much thinking. Look at part (6) "meat inspection" is closely 
associated with the phrase "Canada Approved" or with the search 
for signs of tuberculosis. 

Table XXVI and Figure 12 show that for some parts over 91% of 
the students obtained the correct answer. The curve for the city 
districts is definitely above the other two, the town and village, 
and the rural districts. 

The graph of Figure 13 is jagged, but a careful observation 
will reveal that the curve for the city districts sags for the low 
scores on the left and rises sharply to the right for the high 
scores. It is difficult to see the trends of the other two curves, 
but at the two ends, the extreme left and the extreme right, the 
characteristic signs appear with the red, rural curve above the 
other two on the left, for the low scores, and below the other 
two on the right, for the high scores. 

The course in Health Education as in General Science is too 
long and too exacting for the time allotted.

QUESTION ONE 

PART I - HEALTH EDUCATION 

General Directions for Part I: 

This part is to be answered in the spaces provided 
in this answer booklet. 

Directions: 

State the scientific reason for each of the following 
first-aid measures. 

(a) Applying cold water to a sprained ankle. 

Cold contracts the blood vessels and so checks swelling. 


(b) Crawling on one’s hands and knees out of a smoke-filled 
room* 

Heated air rises taking the smoke upwards. Air is 
better near the floor. 

(c) Applying a wet dressing to a burn. 

Prevents evaporation and consequent pain and 

formation of scar* 

(d) Wrapping in warm blankets a person who has fainted. 
Increases capacity of blood vessels, aiding restoration 

of circulation. 

(e} Applying hot compresses to a sty or a boil. 

Heat dilates the blood vessels to bring more blood to 

the part. This extra volume of blood carries many white 

blood cells which overcome the infection.

CHAPTER IV 


ESSAY QUESTIONS IN GENERAL SCIENCE 
Question five, which is the first one in the General Science 
proper, received the poorest marks, for at least three reasons 
that are clearly evident: first,the student may have misinterpreted 
the word ’Essay”; second, the student did not know the Scientific 
Method; third, if he did know the method, he could not apply it in 
a practical way. 

On page one of the General Science and Health Education paper, 
the third section of the instructions says: 

Question 5, 6,and 7 are ’Essay Type” questions and are to 
be answered on foolscap. 

Again on page four of the same pai>er, it says: 

PART II -- ESSAY QUESTIONS IN GENERAL SCIENCE. 

Just below this heading in the directions, it says: 

This part is to be euiswered on foolscap paper. Your answer 
to each question should be from one-half to one page in length, 
and should be we11 expressed. 

The word ’Essay” or ’Essay Questions in General Science” ap- 
peard forty-one (41) times or 9.11%’ in the four hundred fifty 
papers under consideration. 

As a result of all these instructions and directions 8G.42% 
of the students answered this part on foolscap paper. These 
answers were from one-half to one page in length and were well 
expressed, yet only 2/3 of 1 % received six marks, the full value 
for that question.

This seems a clear indication that too much stress was placed 
on the word "Essay" and that at least part of the fault may be 
placed on the persons responsible for the setting of the paper, 

•dless what has been said about the word "Essay", question 
five distinctly asks for the Scientific Method which involves at 
least six steps: AIM, GATHER LATA, METHOD: INTERPRET AT I OH OF LATA, 
OBSERVATIONS, CONCLUSION, and APPLICATION. It reads as follows: 

How would you use the scientific method in attempting to 

solve one of the following problems: 

(a) How can we make our school more comfortable in hot weather? 

(b) Yftiy do some people seem to dislike me? 

(c) Is LACTAN (an assumed remedy for colds} really good for 
a cold? 

96,66% of the students did attempt to solve the problem, 

92.9% answered it in Essay form. Some of these were less than 
one-half page in length. 

80,42% of the students have essays from one-half to one page 
in length, 

76.44% of the students chose part (a). 

10.88% chiefly girls in the cities chose part (b). 

5.55% chose part (c). 

3.77% used the Scientific Method. 

3.33% failed to try the question. 

The rural schools seem less comfortable because more people 
were impressed with problem (a). 

The few who chose Lactan were from town and village districts. 

A number of these essays have been reproduced to show the 
type of answers that were given.

Question six was also poorly answered; it required planning 
and a number of points in the answer. Part one calls for Prin¬ 
ciples he has studied earlier which most of them were unable to 
apply. The diagram, in the second choice, seems to have attracted, 
the attention of most of the students. This question is too dif¬ 
ficult for the grade, as the results show. 

Question seven is an easy problem and the scores should be 
higher than what they are. Here again many students were unable 
to apply the principles they had studied earlier in Science and 
Social Studies. The second choice of question seven is a problem 
in Social Studies and far too advanced for the grad.e.

ESSAY 571 

How Can We Make Our School More Comfortable 
In Warm Weather? 

In our school there is an air conditioning system that had not 
been used for several years. When the Junior High School was 
established in Halmoral, repairs were made on the air conditioning 
plant and it was put to work. Several rules had to be laid down, 
however, concerning the opening of windows. To operate correctly 
and with the best results this air conditioning system could not 
have any interfering drafts to upset the circulating, cool air 
currents. 

It was quite difficult for a while to get used to leaving the 
windows closed, as we even had monitors assigned to the special 
job of opening and closing the windows. 

kow the air-cooling system seems to be working quite satis¬ 
factorily. In the hottest of weather the school is cool and com¬ 
fortable, which, I believe, has improved the standard of school 
work done by the students, a great deal.

ESSAY 4509 

How Can We Make Our School More Comfortable In 
Hot Weather? 

Making our school comfortable in hot weather is a very im¬ 
portant thing especially for the welfare of the pupils because 
in warm weather one is not able to concentrate or think as well 
as he might. To make our school more comfortable for this many 
famous scientists have experimented for making the school a better, 
cooler and a more enjoyable place to work in. Today we have air- 
conditioning plants all over the world and it would be better to 
have one of these wonderful scientific discoveries in each school. 
When it is very hot outside, the air-conditioning plant would do 
much in making it cool and comfortable. 

The air-conditioning plant regulates the temperature with 
water rushing in it and cleaning it; the air is put through a s 
special screen which takes out all the little dust particles. 

There is another special apparatus which further pnrifies the air 
before it is distributed throughout the building by special pipes 
and registers. It then is forced into the room by fans and the 
used air is forced out through another register.

ESSAY 4629 

Is LACTAD , ( An Assumed Remedy Eor Colds} 

Really Good Eor A Cold? 

To prove that Lactan was really good for colds 1 would firstly 
get about eight people having colds to agree with the experiment 
and follow directions* I would then give four of them Lactan for 
a specified time and the other four would be divided in half. Two 
of them taking some other well-known remedy and the other two taking 
nothing. 

After a few days of treatment 1 would check the results. 

If three out of the four who took Lactan were cured and the 
four taking another remedy or nothing, were not, I would then be 
fairly sure that Lactan was a good remedy for colds. 

I would, however, try this experiment many times, and on many 
types of people to make absolutely sure. 

Candidate #4629. 

This student certairijyknows something about science, yet fails 
to give the Scientific Method with its six steps.

ESSAY 631 

Is LACTAN,(An Assumed Remedy For Colds) Really 
Good For Colds? 

To prove whether or not Lactan is really a good remedy for 
a cold would require a careful experiment with human beings. 

About six persons would be required to volunteer for such an ex¬ 
periment* Three would use Lactan when they become ill with a cold 
while the other three would not take any medicine but take good 
care of themselves when having a cold. If more people would take 
part in such an experiment the results would probably be more 
satisfactory. ^ 

When a person has a cold he should report it to the person 
conducting the experiment, who would make a record of it. Those 
taking Lactan would have to take similar doses at regular inter¬ 
vals and constantly report their condition to the j^erson recording 
the results. 

Careful records would have to be kept and correct observations 
made. Then when the six people who had had colds had overcome 
them, the records could be referred to and conclusions drawn. If 
those who took Lactan recovered from their colds sooner in every 
case than those not taking it, the natural conclusion would be 
that Lactan w&s a good remedy for colds. However, if those who 
took Lactan showed no great improvement over those not taking it, 
the conclusion would be against the use of this for colds. 

Candidate #631* 

This Calgary student has an excellent scientific solution 
for the problem, yet has failed to organize the data as required 
by the Scientific Method*

ESSAY 3698 

Why Bo Some People Seem To Dislike Me? 

There may be many reasons why a person may not like you. 

First of all - "Do you take part in games?" If not proceed to do 
so even if you are no star in sports. Do ahead and learn a few 
games and do them well. Secondly - "Do you act freindly towards 
your fellow friends?" Give people a pleasant smile and develop 
your personality to a more friendly and chummy attitude. Have 
you a sense of responsibility? Don’t pass your troubles on to 
another person to worry about. Paddle your own canoe. Fourthly 
"Have you any will power?" Learn to refuse the "wrong" and your 
friends will respect you all the more. "Do you boast?" If you 
feel that you have accomplished something worth boasting about 
don’t bother yoursej/ about it, your friends will find out sooner 
or later. Don’t acquire an inferiority complex* All these reasons 
and suggestions may help a lot in the acquiring of friends and 
making them like you. 

Candidate #3698. 

Here we have again an Essay with six reasons why a person 
may not like you and how to correct these faulty, yet the material 
is not set out in the reo^uired organized manner.

DSSAY 2878 
Why Some People Dislike Me? 

Some people dislike me for reasons I do not know. There are 
many whom I meet the first day and on the next they will speak to 
me in a way which seems to me like they just don’t care to speak 
to me. Then I change the subject and still they won’t listen to 
me and walk away. 

1 think they are jeaLous of me because 1 make higher marks 
than they do in some subjects. When people ask me for my marks, 

I tell them that I got so many and they ask me why. So I tell 
them that 1 studied hard and earned my marks that way, but they 
think that I cheated. So they leave me and don’t speak to me 
again. 

When I am on the playground, I never get my bats when playihg 
baseball. Or when playing football they never pass the ball to 
me; so I have to just run around and do what I can. 

In the science room I am always helping the science teacher 
with experiments. The other people are jealous because I help 
him and they can’t. And when they do help him, they break some 
of the equipment and he gets angry and tells them to sit down. 

Then he will ask me to help him again which I do quite willingly. 

So I think I will try hard to be nice to them, but if I don’t 
succeed I will have to do what I can. 

Candidate #2878. 

It seems to me that this boy has analysed the problem and 
has given a scientific reason why other students dislike him, yet 
he has not used the Scientific Method and receives only one mark 
for giving the interpretation of the data.

ESSAY 2 6 38 

Why ho Some People Seem To Dislike Me? 

This is, perhaps, one of the most common questions asked by 
the adolescent. Maybe it is his inability to cooperate with others 
or, perhaps, he is just "no good". However, science has made it 
passible for us to answer some of these questions. In the first 
palce, scientists and doctors have found that games make for better 
mental outlook on life. If a fellow knows the rules for one par¬ 
ticular game, he should make it his duty to find out something 
about other games. This teaches bne to become broad-minded, so to 
speak, and enables him to have a general respect for all jjeople. 

If a person wishes to become a doctor or a lawyer, he is,^naturally, 
interested in that one line, but he should make it his business to 
become interested in other professions. The fellow that is dis¬ 
liked more than anyone is the fellow that fails to be an"all-round 
chap". He is the person that gradually becomes very timid and shy 
and doesn’t like to partake with others at games or dances. Our 
modern age, I think, has made it possible for all boys and girls 
to get the most out of life. Ey reading books and meeting people, 
ww can, I believe, get to like others more and thus be far more 
appreaciated by them. 

Candidate ^2638. 

This Edmonton boy offers a very good solution for the pro¬ 
blem, but does not give the required method.

ESSAY c 5 58 

Why Do Some People Seam To Dislike Me? 

Why is it that some people seem to dislike me? Is therb 
something wrong with me or something lacking? These are the first 
two questions I ask myself. Maybe my disposition is not cheerful 
enough and I am grouchy and disagreeable at times. If so, I must 
not drink coffee as this contains a substance called caffeine 
which makes you nervous and gives you sleepless nights. I must 
get more sleep as this rests the nerves and gives you a better 
mental state of mind. Have I got bad breath? This can be very 
offending to others, and if so I must see my dentist about it at 
once and find the cause as it may be bad teeth or even an upset 
stomach. Am I lively and do I take part in games and associate 
with other people? If not, I must eat more energetic foods to 
make me livelier and take part in games as most people do. Am I 
too shy or bashful? If so, I must get down to the essence of my 
faults and correct them. A good, clean and healthy state of mind 
and body also go a long way in making you more likeable to others. 
I am sure if I went about correcting my faults in a scientific 
manner, I would be a more agreeable person to associate with. 

Candidate #3258. 

This girl has given six reasons why people may dislike her 
and has gone about in a scientific way to correct them, yet she 
gets only two marks because she has not the Scientific Method.

ESSAY 651 

Why l)o Some People seem To Ldslike ke? 

This thought has been bothering me for quite a while. Is it 
the people, or is there something wrong with me? It couldn’t be 
my personal appearance because 1 always try to be clean and tidy. 
There must be something else, so don’t say anything for a minute 
and let me think. 

Am I considerate of others or do I only want myself to have 
a good time? Am I a good loser or do I sulk when some other person 
wins? Am I on time for engagements or do I keep people waiting? 

So far I don’t think I am guilty of the second half of these quest¬ 
ions, but there is still another one - ko I make friends easily? 

The answer is "Ho 1 '. 

I am dreadfully shy. I am afraid to do anything that will 
make me visible to the public eye. Sometimes I would like to 
speak to that new girl at the other end of the hall, but I’m 
afraid she won’t like me, since she looks rather proud and is 
much prettier than I am. 

Here. 1 this must stop. 1 How do I think I will ever get through 
life if I don’t conquer this foolishness? There’s that girl again 
and she doesn’t really look proud, probably she’s only shy just 
like I am, so I will speak to her right away before I give myself 
time to become frightened. 

Good-bye 1! Thank you so much for listening to my tale of woe.

obtain scant moisture at considerable depths; reducing the 

leaf surface, the plant body is a juicy storehouse of moisture. 

e.g. The conifers in norMiern temperate bushland; the shape is 

triangular to give body and strength in sandy soil. Reducing 

the leaf surface in form of needles and few stomata. 

e.g. The tundra moss; shallow roots because soil does not thaw 

out deeply; moisture is scanty so foliage is not abundant. 

e.g. jungle foliage, etc. 

6. Or: Any such good sequential treatment,as the following, should 
be accepted. 

6 points for good explanation of the following stages: 

1. Green plant eaten as food by animals. 

2. Animal: wastes: death and decay: ammonified by bacteria 
and passes to soil. 

3. Nitrifiers change ammonia materials to nitrates which are 
insoluble and useless to plants. 

4. Nitrogen-fixers on nodules of legumes convert nitrates to 
soluble nitrates. 

5. Nitrates taken into plants and built up as protein or 
nitrogen content. 

6. Protein food taken by humans and animals. 

7. Plant decays and the cycle continues. 

8. Soil bacteria require air and breathe free nitrogen.

QUESTION SEVEN 


Value 

6 7. Discuss the following statement: 

Either " The principles of Science may be used for improving 
and enriching the common life, but they may also be 
used in ways that are destructive." 

Or: Can Science be said to be responsible for economic 

depression? 


ANSTORS 

7. Either 

3 points for 3 illustrations of the "improvement-applications 
of science. 

3 points for 3 illustrations of the destructive applications 
of science. 


e.g. IMPROVEMENTS: 

1. Invention of electric light as an application of electrical 
resistance in wires has lengthened the day for more work 
and play. 

2. Invention of the gasoline engine as an application of the 

expansive force from burned fuels has brought about a mobile 
population. Rural folk thus town of-fener to shop and 

to attend theatres or get about- easily to parties and dances 

3. Invention of big machines like the tractor permits more 
rapid and extensive farming; thus more leisure, more revenue 
and more opportunity to retire from farming, etc. 

e.g. X-Ray in health: Telegraphy - hasty messages: Printing 
Press for more enlightened people. 

Radio - world news at our fireside. 

DESTRUCTIVENESS: 


1. Invention of gunpowder to blast out stumps and make bridge 
abutments led to use of guns in killing people, and in kill¬ 
ing of wild animals (depletion of resources). 

2. Invention of compressed air machines for drills carried oger 
into submarines (rising and descending) to attack shipping 
with torpedoes (pro£>ellor and screw). 

3. Invention of airplanes to transport mails and passengers led 
to their use in bombing unprotected civilians in cities. 

4. Use of chlorine gas to kill bacteria led to gas warfare and 

*masked mortals*, etc.

7. Or: 


3 points for defence of Science* 

5 points for factors outside of Science proi)er which 
cause depressions* 

Or: 6 points for good arguments showing that Science 
causes depressions (tied up with the Science of the 
Industrial Revolution and resulting machines.) 

Science invents machines and labor-saving devices, which 
put men out of work. Science can hardly be blamed be¬ 
cause society cannot plan for shorter hours, and work for 
all. Science devises machines for mass production but 
government should modify the machinery of control so as 
not to hamper science. Scientific achievement and in¬ 
vention, far from causing depressions, continue in the 
midst of depressions, even in war time; science research 
goes on internationally. Science cannot turn back, but 
rather it will continue to show man the way to greater 
and greater achievements. 

Money control, the tightening and loosening of credit, 
causes depressions; Science does not take the responsib¬ 
ility for these matters. Wars too are generally followed 
by depressions; nor can it be said that wars are the re¬ 
sult of Science. 


The second choice of question seven goes beyond the work of 
scienc^&nd is much more difficult than the first statement; as a 
result most of the candidates > who attempted this question, chose 
the first one. The results, however, should have been much better 
than TableXXXnShows.

Although the curves in Figure It are jagged, that of the Cities 
sags low for a score of one, and is comparatively high for a score 
of four. The curve for the Rural Districts runs opposite to this: 
it is quitehigh at the left, for the low scores, and low to the 
right for the high scores. The trend for the Blue Line is betweeaau 
the other two curves, characteristic for Towns and Villages. 







CHAPTER V 


SHORT ANSWER QUESTIONS IN GENERAL SCIENCE 

Questions eight and nine require the application of scienti¬ 
fic principles studied earlier. Here again many of the students 
failed to see the principles involved. Q.uestion eight was quite 
poorly answered, probably because the question is different from 
those found in a textbook. It is apparent that students do not 
like questions which require thought §nd statements that are to 
be expressed in their own words. It is much more difficult to 
give such answers than to choose one of several answers, in fact 
it is just about as difficult as the planning and organization 
of an answer in Question Six. 

The results of Question Nine are better than those for Eight, 
but they should have been much better, because the questions of 
the different parts are very easy. It seems that our students 
are not able to express themselves even in a limited way. This 
is an indication that our students are not accustomed to making 
their own reports in their own words. The author knows that much 
of the work done by the students is simply copied from a book or 
from another student.

HLESTIOh EIGHT 
wl th 
ANSWERS 


. Directions: 

Explain the following using short answers. 

(a) Why the shadow of a tree resembles the tree in shape. 
Because light travels in straight lines, the sun’s 

rays make a pattern of the tree on the ground. 

(b) Why a gasoline engine is provided with a flywheel. 

The weight (mass) of the v/heel maintains smooth running 

performance without shock. Momentum is dependent on 
mass and speed. When the engine speeds up the fly¬ 
wheel tends to preserve speed and requires less power; 
again it prevents the engine from ’running away* if the 
machine is unloaded. 

(c) Why steam pipes are covered with asbestos. 

Asbestos is a poor conductor of heat; thus heat of steam 
does not escape - result is cheaper operation of furnace 
due to smaller fuel requirements. 

(d) Why a flash of lightning is seen before thunder is heard, 
Light travels 186,000 miles per sec.; sound travels 

1100 feet per sec. Light travels much faster than sound; 
thus light from the electric explosion reaches us almost 
instantaneously; the sound vibration lags behind because 
of the lower speed of travel.

Answer 


(e) Why two holes are punched at opposite sides on the top 
of a can of evaporated milk. 

This permits air pressure to enter and act on the top of 
the liquid thus equalizing the air pressure which rushes 
into the lower opening, rhis allows gravity to do its 
work unhampered. OH: To let air in at the top and elim¬ 
inate the "void". When the void exists the air presses 
into the lower hole and prevents fluid from, running out. 

(f) Why water flows •uphill' through one arm of a siphon. 

The air pressure is practically the same on both surfaces 
jn the upper and lower vessels. The gravity pull on the 
longer column is greater than on the short column. Thus 

air pressure has the advantage on the surface of the 

• ••••••••••••••••••• '••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••* 

higher vessel; it then forces the liquid uphill in the 

shorter arm. 

(g) Why air exhaled from the lungs differs in composition 
from inhailed air. 

Inhaled air: fresh oxygen, nitrogen, .03% COg, inert 
gases, water vapor, oxidation in lungs when oxygen acts 
on foods. 

Exhaled air: oxygen is used up; the same nitrogen comes 
out; much larger per cent of CO^ and of HgO due to oxi- 
dation; the same inert gases make their exit. 

(h) A steel knife is magnetized and therefore can attract 
iron objects. The blade is then dissolved in strong 
sulphuric acid, why is the solution not magnetic? 

The magnetic theory states that the molecules are dis¬ 
sociated and the alignment disturbed; thus the solution 
is non-magnetic; again the iron particles exist no 
longer as iron.

(i) Why do mountain climbers often suffer from nosebleed? 
Answer. At high elevations, air pressure is considerably less. 


2 The pressure of the blood (heart) on the nose membrane^ 


which are thin and exposed, is the same, while contra 


air pressure is less. Thus the heart presses blood 


through the exposed nasal membranes.

ThB curves of Pigure are somewhat jagged, but they do show 
the tendencies very clearly; the Black Line of the Cities is low 
to the left and distinctly above the other two on the right; while 
the curve of the Rural Districts is very high for the low scores 
to the left and crosses that of the Cities at 6.4, then sinks quite 
rapidly to zero at the score of thirteen (13). 

The tendency of the Blue Line, that of the Towns and Villages, 
is to lie somewhere between the Red and the Black.

l^THEMATICAL PROBLEMS 

Question ten reads as follows: 

10, Directions: 

Solve the following problems, showing your work. 

(a) Jim exerts a squeeze of 15 pounds, five inches from the 
pivot of a nutcracker. The nut is one inch from the pivot. 
What is the crushing effect on the nut? 

(b) When Mary rides her bicycle she presses with a force of 
20 pounds on the pedal of the pedal-crank. The crank is 
fi inches long and the radius of the front sprocket is 

4 inches. What is the greatest pull on the bicycle chain? 

(c) Change 68°E (room temperature) to a Centigrade reading. 


Although the question does not call for a diagram, almost 
every person who made an attempt at solving the problems (a) and 
(b) used one. Students apparently had been taught to draw diagrams 
but many of them had failed to master the principle of the second 
class lever; that at least part of the distance of the lever is 



Some conceived the nutcracker as a first class lever, which 
is rightf^there are some like that| and of course got the right 
answer, but many subtracted the one inch from five inches of the 
lever A - B, and in that way got an answer of sixty pounds.

This means that 60%, in the cities, did not answer this part 
of the question correctly; that 66% of the students in the towns 
and villages did not answer it correctly; and that 76.67% of the 
students of the rural districts failed to give the right answer. 

The results for Question 10 (b) are worse: 69.34% of the stu¬ 
dents in the cities did not have the correct answer; in the towns 
and villages 64% of the students failed in this part of the ques¬ 
tion; in the rural districts 80.67% of the students failed in this 
one. 

Question 10 (c} was still worse: 71,34% of the students in 
the cities either had an incorrect answer or omitted the question; 
87.34% of the students in the towns and villages failed; and. 91.34% 
of the students in the rural districts were unsuccessful. This 
means that only 8.66% of the students in the rural districts had 
the correct answer for part (c) of Question 10.

TABLE XXXIX 

STUDENTS USING FOOT POUNDS as A UNIT 
of 

FORCE 

Cities 7 or 4.66% of the students• 

Towns and villages 4 or 2.66/6 " “ 

Rural Districts 13 or 8.66% " " 

Several students confused the unit of force, pounds,with that 
of work, foot pounds. The rural students especially seem to be 
impressed with the idea of work* as the table above indicates; 
almost twice as many, in the country, used this unit. 

For the purpose of analysis each part of question ten was 
divided into its four elements: first the diagram, which described 
the mental^that the student had of the nutcracker and bicycle pedal; 
then the equation; thirdly the numerical answer; and finally the 
unit. As in the case of the diagrams, so with the unit, practically 
every one who made an attempt to solve the problem, had the correct 
unit, with the exception of those in TABUS ^"‘atove. 

The following table shows detailed results for Question 10 (a).

Towns and Villages, The number that had the correct unit was 
almost double that for the correct answer: 63.11$ compared with

These students were distributed as follows:

In tabulating the scores, it was noted that certain marks 
appeared in groups: for example there were from two to ten zeros 
in certain groups. Another group wouldhavea particular question. 
This indicated that certain schools had not taken up this type of 
work, while other schools had stressed only certain parts. 

Question 10 (b) calls for an application of the same principle 
as in (a), namely the second class lever. Here are the results:

Those students who got both (a) and (bj were fewer yet. It 
was surprising that so many did not realize that the underlying 
principle of these two problems is the same.

The above results show that only half of the students who 
drew a diagram for 10 (a) (see Table XLI, page 89) drew one for 
10 (b) also. There are only ten per cent less in 10(b) than in 
10 (a) who have the right equation, and only one per cent less 
with the right numerical answer. There are, however, 13.8% stu¬ 
dents fewer in 10 (b) than 10 (a) with the right unit. 

Tables XLI and XLVII show that about a third of the students 
of the Province have the correct numnerical answer; only half of 
these students have both 1C (a) and 10 (b) correct as the total 
of Table XLV shows. 

Question 10 (c) reads as follows: 

Change 68°F (room temperatiire) to a Centigrade reading. 

Here two ideas are involved: it is necessary to subtract 32°, 
then multiply by 100/180 or 5/9, the proportionate relationship 
between the two thermometer readings.

The students in answering this question either did or did 
not remember the formula 5/9(F - 32) = C, not one of them showed 
evidence of the underlying principle of the two scales, that in 
the Centigrade scale there are 100 dividions between the freezing 
and the boiling points, while in the Fahrenheit scale there are 
180 divisions between the same two points; and that to change from 
Fahrenheit to Centigrade reading one must subtract 32° to bring 
the reading to the freezing point then reduce the reading by 
100/180 or 5/S, and vice versa to change from Centigrade to Fah¬ 
renheit read.ing. In the last operation, the numerical value is 
increased by 180/100 or 9/5 and then add 32°. 

The first item of Table XLVIII indicates many students who 
know that the freezing point of the Fahrenheit thermometer is 32° 
above zero. Several others also indicated the fact that the 
freezing point of the Centigrade thermometer is at zero degrees. 

























c 


$ 3 













95 


ihey also knew that the boiling point of the Fahrenheit thermometer 
is 212°, and that of the Centigrade is 100 degrees; yet they 
failed to see the relationship between these two thermometers, 
they failed to understand that these degrees are just so many di¬ 
visions between the freezing and the boiling points. To them 5/9 
was just a number to be remembered. Some who did remember this 
number forgot to subtract thirty-two degrees. 

Our textbooks are quite clear on this point, but they have 
no drill questions on the essential differences, which apparently 
are hard. Pupils by themselves do not seem to be able to master 
the principles, as the rural results show. The effeciency of the 
rural students is only 10 % as compared with 29.33% of the cities. 

It is clear to the author that the students have missed the prin¬ 
ciple and have studied unrelated facts and numbers.

The above table is typical of this form of analysis, for 
each part of the question more students in .the cities had the 
correct answer then the towns and villages. There is a tendency 
for the rural districts to be lower than the other two groups. 

Figure 24 shows very well the typical characteristics of the 
scores for the three groups; for the rural districts, the curve 
is high for the zero and one scores, and then falls below the 
other two. The curve for the cities is low for the low scores, 
but high for the higher scores, four and five. That of the 
towns and villages lies between the two, especially so at the 
start and the finish.

Most of the figures,in the above table, show a definite de¬ 
cline for the Towns and Villages, and the Rural Districts. There 
are two exceptions that may be due to the limited number of students 
in the sample. A larger sample may raise the figure for the Towns 
and Villages in part (l); it may also increase the figure for part 
(7) for the Cities. 

The author further believes that the jagged peaks of Figure 25 
would become smooth curves and cross in the middle, at the score 
five, for the total population of the Candidates for the Province. 
The ends of these curves indicate the general tendencies; the red 
curve tends to be at the top for the first half and at the bottom 
for the second half of the graph,with the blue in the middle.

According to the above table, most of the students received 
a score of either two or three# 

Table La shows significant results in (a) and (d). All the 
students of the Cities and the Towns and Villages had the first 
one correct;- even the Rural Districts did very well# The per¬ 
centages for (dj are high for the three groups, but for the (e) 
part the results are the very opposite; it is zero for the xiural 
Districts and only 2 % for the Towns and Villages. 

Figure 26 shows curves that are typical for the three groups, 
except for the score of two in the Cities; that, however is more 
than made up by the bul ge to the right.

Question 18, THE PUSH BUTTON 

Value 3. Directions: 

Show how the cell and the bell could be connected 
to ring only when the push button is pressed. 

Draw lines to represent the wires. 



of the PUSH BUTTON was taken by many to be the button itself 
while the dot at the side was used a terminal. Some did not like 
the armature in mid air without the spring and without the electro¬ 
magnets. These students carefully added the missing parts to the 
diagram and drew a side view of the Push Button to show how con¬ 
tact could be made when the Button is pressed. 

The Key reads as follows: 

Must show a series plan or no value. 

3 points for the question; 1 point 
for each connector wire.

CHAPTER VIII (Continued) 

In Question 18 we have two ideas or principles involved, those 
of the two-wire circuit and the irwitch or push button. Most of 
the candidates were able to do the first part, as Table LXII 
indicates; only thirty-six or eight per cent out of the four 
hundred fifty had one wire. A number of students introduced a 
third principle, that of short circuit. Here again were thirty- 
two or 7.1/o of the four hundred fifty candidates. The two ter¬ 
minals might have given most of the students the idea of the two- 
wire circuit, but the most common error was the passing of both 



One hundred sixteen or 25.8% of the students made this error. 
These people did not seem to realize that the bell would ring all 
the time, and that there wasn’t any reason for having the PUSH 
BUTTON, borne students that did not understand the principle of 
the push button left it out altogether. There were twenty-six or 
5.8% of all the students that did this. 

Another very common error was the one with the two wires 
going directly from the battery to the bell and then back to the 
push button. Here again they did not understand that the bell 
would ring all the time and that there was no object in having 
the push button. See Figure 33.

Still another common error was that with the one wire directly 
from the battery to the bell and the other fastened to one post of 
the PUSH BUTTON. The other post apparently was taken to be the 
button itself. Here again the students did not seem to realize 
that the bell would ring all the time and that the PUSH BUTTON 



Three out of the group under consideration left out the Bat¬ 
tery. Two, out of the autho r's group, left out the Bell. 

Thirty-two or 7.11^ of all the students delib^atb&y caused a 
SHORT CIRCUIT by having the two terminals of the battery connected

Still 

others had 


the wire going directly to the BELL from the BATTERY and the PUSH 
BUTTON connected to the BATTERY. The fourth variation was a spliced 
wire connected to the PUSH BUTTON.

Very typical curves for the three groups, the Cities, Towns and

Villages, and the nural Districts. it A shows the characteristic 
relationship of the three curves at both ends and how they cross 
in the middle. This is almost a perfect example of how the scores 
behave for the three groups; the author believes that a larger 
sample of students would make these curfes perfectly smooth.

which indicates that the city students are more familiar with 
electric lights, and that they have been impressed more by the 
results of the different types of lighting. These results may

CHAPTER IX (Continued) 

Question twenty-two is one of the easiest questions on the 
paper and one with the greatest score value. The principle in¬ 
volved, the convection currents in air, is illustrated by means 
of arrows which indicate the motion and direction of air. Above 
the question in the directions the words "hot-air heating" were 
used. The problem is solved for the student; all he has to do 
is simply name certain parts of this system and in his own simple 
language give the use or purpose of each part indicated. The 
purpose is practically a repetition of the named part, as in the 
case of the first item. The name of the apart is "cold air re¬ 
turn"; the purpose of it is " to return air to furnace for re¬ 
heating". If the student had been asked to devise a simple 
method of heating a small house from the basement, it could have 
been considered a problem. However, a large number of candidates 
failed to naxjie the few simple and very common parts of this system. 

The following table gives the results:

Some of the percentages in the above table are very low es¬ 
pecially in the Rural Districts for such simple names as "air- 
chamber or air-jacket" and "hot-air register", "cold-air register". 
There were only 14.67% of the Rural students that answered Part (c) 
correctly, and 15.33% that had part (e). The highest score or the 
greatest number of students in the Rural Districts that named any 
of the parts was only 33.33%, that was for the"fire box". Even 
Elementary School children should be able to do better than that. 

One reason why the results are so poor in the Rural Districts 
is probably the fact that most of them are not familiar with fur¬ 
naces; they have heaters.in the homes and even in the schools. 

Eurther we may conclude that students, in the study of Gen¬ 
eral Science.should have the object before them to examine its 
parts and study its operation, in order to remember its parts and 
the underlying principle. Just reading books and studying dia¬ 
grams is not good enough; this does not make the same impression 
on the child’s mind as the object itself.

CHAPTER IX (Continued) 


Question twenty-three is a review of Grade VII and VIII on 
Heat and Air. Parts (a) and (b) illustrate the same principle: 
that heat will change a liquid to vapor and that heat is ab¬ 
sorbed as this change takes place. Part (c) simply calls for a 
recognition of the boiling point on a Centigrade thermometer. 
Parts (d), (f), (g) and (h) all illustrate the same principle, 
that pressure depends upon weight or gravity of a substance, in 
this case water and air. Part (g) calls for the recognition of 
a barometric reading at sea level in .British units of measure. 

In (h) the column of air weighs less as one goes up and the 
aneroid barometer is a suitable instrument to measure this diff¬ 
erence. Part (e) like (a), (b) and (c) deal with heat, but il¬ 
lustrate the principle of convection currents of water or air 
as heat is applied. 

Many candidates failed to recognize the same principle in 
(a) and (b) as the following tables and graphs show; roughljr. 
only half of the students that had answered (a) had (b) also. 
There is a marked similarity in the results as the graph of 
Figure 41 shows, with a slight characteristic skewness to the 
right for the cities and somewhat less for the towns and vill¬ 
ages ,

that are - 

(1) cold and dry, (2) cold and windy, (3) warm 
and dry, (4) warm and moist, (5) warm. (a) 

(b) When water changes to vapor, it - 

(1) gives off heat, (2) absorbs heat, (3) oxidizes, 

(4) decreases its volume. (5) becomes heavier. 

(b) 

(o} The boiling point of water is - 

(1) 273°C, (2) 100°?, 100°C, (4) 4°C, 

(5) 180°?. (c) 

(d) Water pressure at a faucet attached to a 

pipe which leads from an elevated tank 
depends upon the . of the pipe. 

(1) material, (2) height, (3) diameter, 

(4) volume, (5) suction. (d) 

(e) When the temperature of some portion of a 

body of water is changed,.will result. 

(1) chemiipal changes, (2) bubbles, (3) evapor¬ 
ation, (4) convection currents, (5) conduction. 

(e) 

(f) Air pressure is due to - 

(1) clouds, (2) buoyajstncy, (3) gravity, 

(4) sunshine, (5) water vapor. (f) 

(g) The height (in inches) of the mercury in 

an ordinary barometer at sea level is about- 

(1) 43, (2) 105, (3) 62, (A) 115, (5) 30. (g) (..$..) 

(h) The instrument by which an aviator determines 
his altitude is based on the-

Provincial Average,or that of the above three,is 46.3 


It is apparent that a constant relationship exists between 
Towns-Villages and Cities, and between Rural Districts and Towns- 
Villages; or the difference between Sural Districts and Cities is 
double that of the Towns-Villages and Cities. Any deviation from 
this constant relationship is believed to be due to the limited 
sample of this investigation. 

This relationship is shown in Twenty One of the Twenty Three 
grajjhs of the Scores for the Different Questions, Number twelve 
shows the Towns and Villages above the Cities, while number Twenty 
one is extermely high for the Cities in the last figure, otherwise 
this one also follows a constant trend. 

The graph of Figure 43 shows the Black Line as much above the 
Blue Line as the Red one is below the Blue, and the Provincial 
Average follows the Blue Line.

CHAPTER XI 


CONCLUSIONS 

The investigation has been of great interest to the writer; 
many interesting facts have come to light about the course in 
General Science and Health, and about the Einal Examination in 
General Science and Health Education of 1940. The marks of this 
examination are low; for thirteen of the twenty-three questions, 
the average score is below fifty per cent. Three questions are 
below twenty per cent and three more below thirty per cent for the 
rural districts. 

The Median for the Province is 45.1 per cent, while the aver¬ 
age is 46.3 per cent. This indicates a slight skewness, a depar¬ 
ture from symmetry of the distribution of students for the different 
scores. The Median Score for the rural districts is only 39.7 per 
cent. 

Sigma ( CT~ ), the standard Deviation for the Province, in terms 
of per cent is 11.6, which means that two-thirds of the students 
have a score between 33.5 (45.1 - 11.6J and 56.7 (45.3 11.6) per 

cent. One-sixth of the students have a score between 33.5 and 16 
per cent, and the other sixth have a score between 56.7 and 79 per 
cent. 

The most outstanding fact about the investigation is the re¬ 
lationship of the three groups under investigation: the city, town 
and village, and rural districts; their differences are marked and 
regular, see Tables LXXVI, LXXVII and LaXVIII also Eigure 43.

The following are the findings of the foregoing investigation. 

(1) A definite relationship exists among the scores of the city, 

town and village, and rural districts. 

(2) The students have not been taught to use the Scientific 
Method in solving problems. 

(3) The answer given by the student depended on the wording of 
the question. 

(4) Little or no transfer of knowledge is evident. 

(5) Some questions are too advanced for the grade. 

(6) In other questions, everything is done for the pupil. 

(7) The principles involved are often not revealed in the answer. 

(8) The examinations still require a list of facts and terms to 
be memorized. 

(9) The textbooks in Grade IX are too advanced. 

(10} Libraries of these advanced books would be of little value. 

(11) The method of teaching as given in the Programme of Studies 
is difficult to apply. 

(12) The course in General Science and Health Education is too 
long for a careful study. 

(13) We lack laboratory facilities. 

(14| Classes should be smaller for laboratory work. 

(15) We need longer laboratory periods. 

(16) Actual experience in manipulating a machine makes it real.

A constant relationship apparently exists among the scores 
of the city, town and village, and rural districts. The difference 
between the city and town and village districts is practically 
equal to the difference between the town and village and the rural 
districts, or the difference between the city and the rural dist¬ 
ricts is double the difference between the city and the town and 
village districts. Any deviation from this relationship is believed 
to be due to the limited sample of this investigation or some spe¬ 
cial incident. This relationship is illustrated by twenty-one of 
the twenty-three graphs for the different problems. Invariably the 
curve for the cities is low for the small scores and high for the 
large scores. The red curve for the rural districts runs opposite 
to the black one; it is high for the small scores and low for the 
large scores. The general tendency for the blue line, which re¬ 
presents the town and village districts, is to be half way betv/een 
the black and the red lines. Questions two and twelve may be re¬ 
garded as special cases. In both instances the town and village 
districts are above the cities,in their scores. The reason why 
the town and village districts are so high in their scores, and 
even the rural districts are higher then usual, may be that these 
localities lack facilities for physical training. Therefore, all 
the time allotted for Health Education may have been spent on the 
theory. Then in connection with question twelve, many of the 
students in town and village districts may have had occasion to 
write to the Department of Agriculture for similar information. 

This would not be the case, in the cities.

The conclusion that the author drav/s from his results is 
that the sum total of conditions in schools, environment, equipment, 
etc., of the town and village districts is as much superior to the 
rural districts as that of the city districts is superior to the 
town and village districts. Those who are familiar with rural life, 
as the author is, know that a child’s success or failure is measur¬ 
ed by : lavements on the farm rather than those in school; 

whereas, in the cities the child’s life centers around the school. 

The results of question five were a clear evidence that the 
students over the whole province were not solving their problems in 
General Science by the Scientific Method. Of course, it may be 
true that too much stress was laid on the word "Essay". The direc¬ 
tions definitely call for an essay in three different places. As 
a result over eighty per cent of the students had essays from one- 
half to one page in length, according to instructions. 

The third and fourth points may be taken together. The re¬ 
sults of this investigation clearly indicate that the students in 
the Intermediate Schools are unable to apply the General Principles 
they have studied earlier to the solving of new problems. Much 
depended on the wording of the questions; any deviations from the 
textbooks confused the pupils. Por this reason it was often diffi¬ 
cult to state whether the students did or did not know the General 
Principles involved. In the case of the multiple choice and the 
matching problems, the scores are invariably high. This indicates 
that the students know the answers even though they are not able 
to express them correctly. There are five questions that prove

this point, numbers two, four, twelve, sixteen and twenty-three. 

The students like these questions because very little thinking 

and no planning is involved, • 

The opposite to these questuions is the "Essay Type" in 
Part II. In this section the marks are very low, especially for 
question five. In this question the student is asked to do a 
number of things: first, to decide whether he is to state his 
answer in a definite form, the Scienfific Method, or to write an 
essay, as over eighty per cent of the students did; second, to use 
the Scientific Method; third, to plan hi3 work; fourth, to answer 
a question that is not taken from a textbook, or in other words, 
to apply the principles he had studied earlier to the solving of 
a new problem. A third of the students simply did not try this 
question at all. The two-thirds that made an attempt received 
less than one-fifth of the total score. 

With the exception of the first question, the Health Educa¬ 
tion part of the paper is well answered. Eor question one, most 
of the candidates received a mark between one and four out of ten. 
Kot one in the group obtained the full score. The question is too 
difficult for the grade; it goes beyond the plan in the Programme 
of Health Education. This question weeks to teat the validity of 
assumed correlation as between Health Education and General Science. 
Unit three in the programme of studies has to do with "what to do", 
not why it is done. In parts (b) and (c), the students have 
failed to carry over this part of the science.

The first choice of question six, like question five, requires 
planning and a number of points in the answer. Again, this is 
different from the usual type of question, and for that reason 
only 7.8 per cent of the total marka were obtained for this choice. 
Host of the students were attracted to the second choice of 
question six, to the circular diagram with the cow’s head. This 
really is a difficult question for Grade IX, even too difficult 
for Senior High School. 

Again the same can be said about question ten; the problem 
is too advanced for the grade; the mathematics involved-are those 
of High School Physics, not Grade IX General Science. In the 
first place there are no such problems in our textbooks, and in 
the second place we have not the time.. We could easily spend a 
month on the levers and the wheel and axle, which would seriously 
interfere with the rest of the programme. 

The second choice of question seven is a problem in Social 
Studies and far too advanced for the grade. The causes responsible 
for Economic Depressions would be difficult to state even by a 
university student. 

In question eleven the 13th and 14th parts are more confusing 
than difficult. At first sight it looks as though a word is to 
precede the number and then another word to follow it. 

Questions thirteen and fourteen are good examples of the 
same principle presented in two different ways. The first one is 
answered quite well, whereas the second one is poorly answered.

In question fourteen the word Microbe is misleading. Most text¬ 
books use the word gem, or bacteria, or micro-organsims. In 
question thirteen the names are much too difficult for the average 
student. These could have been listed at the bottom of the prob¬ 
lem. The same applies to question fifteen; potential, kinetic,etc., 
are abstract terms that are much too difficult for the average 
student to understand. 

Part (b) of question seventeen, "The speed of radio waves is 
about 186,000 miles per second", is abstract and much too advanced 
for the grade. 

The principle of the Electric Circuit in question eighteen 
is more confusing than difficult. The small circle looks more 
like a dry cell rather than a Push Button. It is so different 
from any of the diagrams we have of the Push Button. The diagram 
of the bell is incomplete. It lacks coils, armature, armature 
spring and contact points. A number of students spent much of 
their time in connecting these properly. 

Question twenty-two on the Hot-air Purnace is really no 
problem; everything is done for the pupil, yet most of the rural 
students failed to give the correct answers. Some were confused 
with the lettering, others failed to use the proper terms, such as: 
hot-air register and cold-air register; very few were able to name 
the convection currents. The reason may be that the rural students 
are not familiar with this type of heating system; they have coal 
heaters in eyery room. 

Question twenty-one, the problem on light, is a better example 
of an object with which city students are familiar. Many of the

city homes have direct and indirect electric lights. In the 
country, rural districts, electricity is rarely available and 
consequently rural children are not familiar with this problem. 

Question twenty-two might have been a better problem if the 
students had been asked to draw arrows that demonstrate the air 
currents, and letter the different parts with names listed below. 

The author believes that Question Five, which asks the students 
to use the Scientific Method in solving a problem, is the best 
type of question and that a similar one should be given year after 
year. 

Further, the author believes that the course in General 
Science and Health Education is too long and rigid for any care¬ 
ful study of the topics listed. The five periods a week we have 
are hardly enough for the theory; this does not leave any time for 
mathematical problems in science or laboratory experimentation. 

It was discovered that most of our textbooks in General 
Science are written by university graduates for graduates and not 
for children in Grade VII, VIII and IX. Most of the figures in 
these books are photographs of either rock formations, that require 
a geologist to interpret, or of complicated machines which need 
an expert mechanic to describe their functions. 

The common textbook in use for Grade VII and VIII is by 
George H. Lympus and John ¥. E. Shore. This book starts out with 
simple diagrams and comprehensive experiments in Grade VII, but 
these become few in Grade VIII. The work in astronomy is too 
advanced for the grade.

The textbooks in Urade IX are worse. The most common one in 
use is by Charles John Pieper and V/ilbur Lee Beauchamp, This 
book has lost sight of experiments entirely and has few diagrams. 
It simply has developed into a catalogue of mechanical devices. 
Most of these are photographs of the most complex machines and 
are described by specialists to specialists. 

The teacher’s job, as the author sees it, is to translate 
this scientific language into simple English, and change the 
small complex figures into large simple diagrams. It is difficult 
to understand hovj a library of such books is going to be of much 
value to these immature children. We need manuals that instruct 
pupils how to make simple apparatus and carry out experiments 
with common things about them. This would increase the efficiency 
in General Science. 

Another thing that the author has noticed about the textbooks 
is the constant repetition of the material and photographs for the 
different grades. Our science books are just about as interesting 
as the old history books used to be, when they were a catalogue 
of kings and wars with their exact dates, etc. It seems a pity 
that someone cannot deviate from this traditional way of writing 
books. Some of these photographs would be interesting if they 
were accompanied by simple self-explanatory diagrams. 

Eor a number of reasons, the method of teaching as described 
in the Programme of Studies is difficult to apply. The programme 
lists these advanced books, then speaks about the rich experiences 
and the great value that comes to the pupils from enlarged reading 
and extended research through an attempt to solve problems. 







176 


It goes on to say that a single textbook is therefore not conducive 
to the technique of group discussion and of pupil report for sub¬ 
mission to the class, drowsing for data, and skilful selecting 
and rejecting of information on the ground of pertinence to the 
problem in hand are tachniques of fundamental importance, requir¬ 
ing the multiple textbook procedure. For this reason, it says, 
every classroom library should contain all the books recommended 
for use as textbooks and some at least of those listed as re¬ 
ference books for the use of the pupils. We have them all in our 
school, but we find them of little value unless the pupils have 
been carefully directed. 

The programme speaks of the pupils as though they were 
university graduates doing research work. Our children are quite 
small and spend much of their time in play, not in the study of 
books. 

Then the programme goes on to say that the course should 
not develop into a note-giving course; yet we are responsible 
for such a mass of material that they do well to memorize the 
facts. This does not leave much time for experimenting or re¬ 
search work. 

Further it is said that the revising committee would dis¬ 
courage the use of manuals, helps, etc., in the hands of the 
students; that pupils should be encouraged to take inventory of 
the work accomplished, 'and set down in sentence form the out¬ 
standing fundamental facts deduced from observation, experimentation 
and reading. The programme continues by saying that well planned

laboratory work, properly organized field trips, the use of 
library facilities, and open forum discussions are of far greater 
importance in the presentation of General Science than are lec¬ 
tures and demonstrations by the teacher. 

In addition to the book problem, we are sadly in need of 
laboratory facilities: apparatus, cupboards, tables, etc. Most 
of our schools still have from forty to fifty seats screwed to the 
floor. These have a little slanting desk, twenty by fourteen 
inches, piled with books. Under such conditions it is impossible 
to carry on any experimental work in the class. Our so-called 
laboratories in the City of Edmonton are simply lecture rooms, 
and the time allotted, thirty minutes, is just long enough for 
a short lecture. Our classes should be half the size for lab¬ 
oratory work. Then in addition to the lecture period, we should 
have at least a double period for laboratory work. Actual ex¬ 
perience in the manipulation of a machine makes it real and leaves 
a more lasting impression on the mind of the student. The manipu¬ 
lation of machines leads to understanding of the principles in¬ 
volved; otherwise these underlying principles are just so many 
textbook exercises that are memorized for an examination.
