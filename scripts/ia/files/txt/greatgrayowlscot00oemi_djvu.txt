ABSTRACT 


A paucity of scientific information concerning 
this continent’s largest owl, the Great Gray, and the 
known scarcity of this species in Alberta prompted 
this investigation. 

Two nests of this rare species were discovered 
during the course of the study, one in the Edson area, 
the other in the Rocky Mountain House region. This, 
together with fourteen dead specimens and eight live 
Great Gray Owls encountered, in the course of this 
investigation, made possible a study of this species 
with regard to the following: identification, 
classification, plumages, sub-species, pterylography, 
molt, eye-color, anatomy, distribution and movements, 
courtship, nesting, reactions to intruders, voice, 
activities of adult owls, description of young, 
physical development of young, food habits, enemies, 
parasites and diseases, and economic status. 

No less than eleven new records for the Barred 
Owl emerged in the course of this investigation. These 
findings revealed, a hitherto unsuspected, established 
population in Alberta. 

Thirty-five Snowy Owls captured Airing the x^inters 
of 1953-54 an< 3“ 1954-55 for banding purposes were used 
for a weight and plumage color study which proved

conclusive in sex determinations. An extremely 
interesting banding recovery was also recorded. 

Observations were made on the distribution and 
feeding habits of the ubiquitous Great Horned Owl. 
Since the spring of 1951 an effort has been made to 
gather data on the little known northern forest owls 
of the province. Notes were made on the occurrences 
and food habits of the Hawk Owl, Saw-whet and 
Richardson*s Owl, to supplement information already 
known about the birds. 

The first Screech 0x^1 captured in Alberta was 
taken in the Swan Hills. A second specimen from 
Lesser Slave Lake was forwarded to Dr. Wm. Rowan of 
the Zoology Department of the University of Alberta. 

Although much remains to be learned about the 
Great Gray Owl and the other northern forest owls of 
Alberta, it is felt that this preliminary study has 
laid the ground work for more extensive investigation 


in the future

A PRELIMINARY STUDY 
OP 


THE GREAT GRAY OWL ( Scotiaptex nebulosa nebulosa ) (Forster) 

IN ALBERTA 

WITH OBSERVATIONS ON SOME OTHER SPECIES OP OWLS 

INTRODUCTION 

The first notes and photographs on the nesting of the 
Great Gray Owl in Alberta were taken by A*D* Henderson of 
Belvedere, Alberta in 1915® Never really common then, 
these owls have now almost vanished* 

Pew of America*s experienced ornithologists have seen 
the Great Gray Owl in life and there has always been a dearth 
of material in collections* Shortly after 1930* Red Squirrel 
pelts in Alberta began to acquire some commercial value* 
Hundreds of trappers then Invaded the great spruce forests 
and at the same time declared war on all owls* Most trappers 
are imbued with a universal prejudice against owls, feeling 
that the birds prey heavily on marketable fur-bearing animals 
and so seriously reduce the trapper’s potential profit* 

The Great Gray Owl was condemned along with other species 
of owls and not having the wary and suspicious nature of some 
of these it offered an easy target for the trappers* guns* 

The decline in numbers of Great Gray Owls was rapid, and in 
less than ten years after the price Increase for squirrel 
pelts, the birds became exceedingly rare in Alberta* 

In December of 1951 I collected my first Great Gray Owl 
in dense muskeg country west of Fawcett, Alberta* 


















































2 


Veteran oologist A.D. Henderson x^ras consulted on 
suitable nesting areas of this species. He felt there 
was still a chance of locating Great Gray Owls in the 
more unsettled regions of heavy timber, north and west 
of Edmonton* 

The first area investigated during the spring and 
early summer of 1952 covered the large poplar and muskeg 
stands west of the village of Flatbush stretching to the 
Athab a ska River* This entailed working all suitable 
timbered areas by horseback and on foot, north to Smith 
and Fawcett Lake, south to the Vega Ferry Grossing on the 
Athabaska, and west across the river to Tipi Lake and 
Timeu. Ho Great Grays were discovered that year although 
two dead specimens had been sent from the area the previous 
itfinter* One nest of the American Hawk Owl (Surnia ulula ) 
was found* Great Horned Owls ( Bubo virginianus ) were 
relatively numerous owing to a high rabbit population* 

Eight nests of this species were located. 

In the spring of 1953 the search was again concentrated 
in areas from which dead specimens of Great Gray Owls had 
previously been sent. A juvenile female was shot by a 
trapper near Sangudo in March 1953 * and an adult male was 
similarly disposed of by a trapper north of Timeu. Another 
bushman working in an area north-west of Ft. Assiniboine 
had shot no less than six during the winter and showed me 
the evidence. In the Corbett Creek area west of Ft. 
Assiniboine a nesting pair was shot.

No nests of the Great Gray Owl were found but 
thirteen nests of the Great Horned Owl were located in the 
course of field work in these areas. 

It became apparent that some form of publicity especially 
directed to the trappers might prevent the needless slaughter 
of these birds and also lead to the finding of a nest, 

A seven page brochure (Pig, 1) asking for information 
on the owl, complete with sketches comparing it with the 
common Great Horned Owl was accordingly circulated through¬ 
out the northern part of the province. Every registered 
trapper, logging camp and ferry operator, as well as all 
northern school divisions and government forestry personnel 
received a copy. More than 5#000 were mailed. Various country 
weeklies in Alberta and some of the farm publications which 
have an enormous circulation in Western Canada carried an 
appeal for Information. A national weekly paper published 
a large picture of a Great Gray Owl with an accompanying 
request for available data, 

Numterous people responded to the appeal and many in¬ 
teresting Items on owls came to light. For instance, new 
records for the Barred Owl In Alberta were sent in. 

During the winter of 195>4 three dead Great Gray Owls 
were sent In from Anzac, Rocky Mountain House and Ft. 
Assiniboine respectively. Two live birds were also re¬ 
ceived. They had been trapped and slightly injured in 
the process. 







































. 








. 


















One was taken north of Melfort, Saskatchewan, and 
represents the fourth record for that province (Bard, 
personal correspondence); the other came from Ft. Assiniboine. 
The Saskatchewan bird still survives and provided the material 
on feather sequence and molt. The remains of another Great 
Gray Owl were found north of Ft. Assiniboine. 

In early May, 195k- 9 two nests of the Great Gray Owl 
were located in widely separated areas. Both nests contained 
two week-old young and these f5.nds provided. the basis for 
this study. All nesting activities were recorded and a 
photographic study was made. A good deal of original data 
concerning these rare birds was gathered. This marked the 
first substantial contribution towards a knowledge of the 
life history of the species. 

The spring of 1955 produced no nests of this species 
but two more dead birds arrived, one from the Edson, and 
the other from the Raven district west of Innisfail, A 
live bird sent from Raven subsequently died in captivity. 

The four year investigation produced fourteen dead 
Great Gray Owls, four live birds that were sent me, and 
two nests each containing two young. 

Further interesting observations were made on the 
Hawk Owl, Snowy Owl ( Byetea nyctea ). Barred Owl ( Strlx 
varia), Richardson*s Owl ( Cryptoglaux funerea richardsoni ), 
Saw-whet Owl ( Cryptoglaux acadia ), Screech Owl ( Otus asio ) 
and the Great Horned Owl, A total of 36,000 miles was 
covered during the search period from the spring of 1952 to 
the summer of 1955 ty car, truck, jeep, canoe, on horseback

The Great Gray Owl 



HAVE YOU SEEN THIS BIRD? 







THE GREAT GRAY OWL 

One of Alberta’s Rarest Bir ds 


An amazing number of Albertans have never seen 
this large and beautiful owl. It is in fact fast becoming one 
of Alberta’s rarest birds and definitely in acute danger of 
becoming extinct in the next few years. 

It is the writer’s intention to attempt the writing of a 
complete life history of this owl and Mr. Ed Jones, well known 
bird expert of Edmonton, will endeavor to record much of the 
bird’s life and activity on movie film. We have been engaged 
in an intensive search over the past two years travelling more 
than 10,000 miles for the nest of the Great Gray Owl and as 
yet have been unsuccessful. For this reason, through the 
medium of this pamphlet, I am extending this appeal for any 
information that readers of this publication might be able 
to forward. 


DESCRIPTION OF THE GREAT GRAY OWL: 

By measurement and appearance it is the largest of 
all our owls but when it is stripped of all its feathers, it is a 
surprisingly small bird. In color, this owl appears rather dark 
and blackish rather than the light brown or dull gray of the 
Great Horned Owl. Its body appears to be barred in tones of 
black and white throughout. An easy way to identify this 
owl is by its enormous saucer shaped face. The head appears 
very large and is without horns and the face has very distinct 
concentric circles of alternating black and white. The eyes 
are quite small and yellow in color. When you see any large 
owl, try to approach it as closely as possible and firstly de¬ 
termine whether it has tufts or horns on the head. If it has 
these projections on the head it will undoubtedly be a Great 
Horned Owl and if without these horns, and somewhat dark 
in appearance and large in size with an enormous head it will 
be the Great Gray Owl. 


3 


VOICE: 


According to Mr. A. D. Henderson of Lac La Nonne, 
who found several nests of the Great Gray Owl some 25 years 
ago, this bird has a call somewhat different from the sound 
made by the Great Horned Owl. Mr. Henderson describes the 
hoot of the Great Gray Owl as more of a long drawn whistle 
than a deep slow hoot. 


HABITS AND CHARACTERISTICS: 

This owl is extremely tame and very unsuspicious and 
one can approach very close to it. For this very reason, these 
birds have offered an easy target for the guns of trappers, 
hunters, settlers and farmers and all others who happen to 
be in the northern woods where this bird is found. Scientific 
analysis of the stomach contents of this bird made on numer¬ 
ous dead specimens forwarded to the University have shown 
that this owl is predominantly a mouse eater and seldom 
bothers squirrels, game birds or even rabbits. Its feet are not 
nearly as strong and powerful as those of the Great Horned 
Owl. This is a valuable and rare owl and one that should not 
be shot, and 1 1 hereby request the assistance of all readers of 
this publication to aid in the protection of this interesting 
bird.

NEST AND WHERE TO LOOK FOR IT 


The Great Gray Owl does not build a nest of its own 
but makes use of an old hawk’s nest. These nests are usually 
found in tall poplars, more commonly the white poplar and 
occasionally in the tall balm of gilead or black poplar trees. 
Nests have occasionally been found in spruces and pines so any 
large old hawk’s nest shoud be checked from early March to 
early June, the time of nesting for these birds. Groves of tall, 
heavy poplars are the most likely areas for old hawk’s nests to 
be found and here the owls will nest. These nests are easily 
seen in the early spring before the leaves bud out on the trees 
and a close look at the nests will soon reveal whether an owl 
is sitting on it and by examination of the head you can readily 
tell whether it is a Great Gray Owl. 



If such a bird should be found nesting, please write 
or phone as soon as possible to Mr. A1 Oeming, Sub. P.O. 23 
Edmonton, Phone 392350. If these birds should be nesting in 
an area where other settlers or trappers are living, please ask 
them to afford the birds all the protection possible and notify 
the writer (as above) immediately.

DESCRIPTION OF THE STUDY AREA 


The Great Gray Owl is a denizen of deep forests. 
Henderson (1915) and Randall (1920) have hoth 
emphasized the fondness of this species for heavy 
stands of poplar fringing large muskegs. 

The area covered during the spring and early summer 
of 1952 contained many good stands of old black poplar 
and several sizeable muskegs. Great tracts of this 
region have been burnt over and only scrubby second 
growth white poplar surrounds some of the muskegs* 
Substantial stands of old white and black poplars were 
encountered along the Pembina river west of Flatbush 
and Fawcett. Particularly extensive muskegs were found 
west of the village of Fawcett, but the area is 
practically devoid of any substantial poplar growth. 

The muskegs of this area are in the main tamarack and 
black spruce associations and provide excellent nesting 
locations for Hawk Owls. 

Considerably less muskeg but more heavy white poplar 
was encountered in the areas investigated in the spring 
of 1953» The region north and west of Timeu contains a 
mixed growth of huge black and white poplar, black spruce, 
jack pine and tamarack. Some of the larger muskegs in 
this area had little in the way of old stands of poplar 
around them due to the fires that have swept the region 
repeatedly in the past twenty years.

North west of Ft* Assiniboine one finds the finest 
big stands of white poplar in Alberta, the Corbett Creek 
country having perhaps the largest growth with many 
muskegs scattered throughout® This area appeared to 
provide the ideal Great Gray habitat® Farther north of 
Ft® Assiniboine the deciduous woods disappear and give 
way to heavy and vast coniferous growth covering the 
undulation called the Swan Hills® The Swan Hill forests 
are composed in the main of lodgepole pine (Fig® > 
balsam, jack pine and black spruce® The trees are among 
the oldest in Alberta and no serious fire has ever 
reduced the M green” of this magnificent forest. Undoubtedly 
birds such as Great Gray Owls could spend much of their 
lives undiscovered in this vast, dense solitude only 
moving into the lower regions near Ft. Assiniboine during 
the winter and nesting seasons. Almost complete absence of 
poplar and a dearth of suitable nest sites would appear 
to eliminate the possibility of nesting in the Swan Hills 
proper. 

The area north and west of Wandering River towards 
Pelican Portage was covered in 195>ij-. This is a vast 
region of black spruce growth and muskegs, although there 
is an extensive poplar growth and some willow. Much of 
the best available spruce in Alberta is now being logged 
in this area, producing 1,000 board feet per tree® 

The country north of Edson and west of Rocky Mountain 
House also provides suitable Great Gray habitat. The 
study area here consisted of large muskegs containing 
(Fig. 5) willow, alders, black spruce and tamarack. Many 



i .

are fringed with large black and white poplar (Fig* 3). 

The spring of 1955 was spent checking the areas 
already described. The map on page 6 (Fig. 2) will 
serve to give some impression of the location of the 
study area.

THE GREAT GRAY OWL ( Gcotiaptex nebulosa nebulosa (Forster) 
IDENTIFICATION AND cLAbElFlOATlUN 
Taxonomic Position 

The Great Gray Owl belongs to the order Strigiformes 
suborder Striges, family Strigidae, genus S cotiaptex , 
species nebulosa and subspecies nebulosa . It was first 
described by J.R. Forster (1772) from a juvenile specimen 
collected near Severn River in north-western Ontario. The 
type specimen is believed to be somewhere in England but 
some doubt has been expressed that it still exists (Amadon, 
personal correspondence). Forster's description translated 
from the original in Latin by Dean Walter Johns is as 
follows: 

r, The Strix with smooth head, dusky colored body 
with many white stripes. The sixth flight feather rather 
long and with a dark colored crest. It lives around Hudson 
Bay and feeds on hares, rabbits and mice. The beak is 
dark yellow, the upper part more yellow than the lower. 

The eyes are large with yellow irises. The head is greyish 
in appearance from the feathers being striped with alter¬ 
nating dark and pale grey. Behind these feathers towards 
the neck there is a line of small dark feathers toward 
each cheek, producing a dark semicircle. The back of the 
head to upper and lower parts is dusky with feathers spotted 
with white on the margins. The breast is whitish with white 
stripes running up and down and across. The abdomen is white 
with longitudinal stripes above as on the breast, but 
marked below with cross stripes. The back and entirely

covering the wings and tail are striped with covering 
of dusky and white. The wings are dusky; the front 
feathers dusky with cross bands of grey, and white with 
cloudy cross lines. The sixth £Light feather is longer 
than the rest with the rest rather blackish • The rest 
of the flight feathers are rather pale, striped with 
darker colors. The tail is rounded with twelve tail 
feathers with the two in the middle rather longer. The 
whole with wavy stripes of ashy white and dark with 
several dark double lines across. The rest of the tail 
feathers slightly striped with dark and light. The feet 
are covered with whitish feathers striped with dark. In 
size it is almost the same as that of Strix nyctea . The 
length is sixteen inches, the width four inches, and the 
weight three pounds.” 

When Forster described, the G-reat Gray Owl as Strix 
nebulosa someone unfamiliar with the bird supposed he 
referred to the Barred Owl ( Strix varia ) and so con¬ 
sequently nebulosa was applied to the latter for over a 
hundred years. The name was later changed to the present 
Scotiaptex nebulosa (Preble, 1902). It was then 


transferred to the species Forster intended it for (A.O.U 
1912).

Gommon Names 

The Great Gray Owl is known by a variety of common 
names such as spruce owl, cinereous owl, spectral owl, 
saucer-faced owl, big-headed owl and the hornless owl* 
Comparison between the Great Gray and the Great Horned Owl 

Feet and Tarsi 

Because of the availability of the Great Horned Owl 
it is compared with the Great Gray, Both species belong 
to the same family, Strigidae. 

The feet of the two species display an interesting 
difference* The feet of the Great Horned Owl are con¬ 
siderably stronger, with the middle claw measuring up to 
l\2. mm. in length while that of the Great Gray seldom 
exceeds 32 mm* (Fig* 6). There appears to be a correla¬ 
tion between relative length of the middle toe and the 
prey preferred. The Great Grays feed principally on 
small mammals such as mice and voles* Their feet would 
appear unable to take large prey such as Snowshoe Hares 
which the Great Horned Owls commonly feed on* 

The extent of feathering on the tarsus is quite 
similar in both species. Both species can voluntarily 
assume a zygodactylous position of the toes and Great Grays 
appear to adopt this placement more frequently than the 
Great Horned Owl which usually places three toes ahead with 
the first toe behind.

Comparison of Heads 


The heads of the two species show a marked 
difference. The head of the Great Gray Owl appears 
much larger than that of the Great Horned Owl and 
lacks the ear tufts of the latter (Fig. 7). The eye 
of the Great Gray is considerably smaller than that of 
the Great Horned. This can be established by measuring 
the eyes, length of beak from commissural point, and the 
length of the head and beak of live birds (Meng, 195>1). 
The typical ratios for the two species are as follox^s:

Plumages of the G-reat G-ray Owl 

Adult plumages have "been previously described (Gladden 
193b) and the description of the immature bird is original. 

A dult Female : The general color of the upper parts is dusky, 
dull, grayish brown or bluish-sooty color, broken by transverse 
mottlings of whitish grey. The uniformly sooty centres of the 
feathers produce an effect of irregular dusky stripes, most 
conspicuous on the back and shoulders. The edges of the 
feathers of the breast plumage are more regularly barred. 

The mottling becomes more profuse on the rump and the upper 
tail-coverts and produces a more greyish appearance. The 
primary coverts are crossed with very dull or indistinct bands 
of paler brown. The secondaries are crossed by about nine bands 
(one terminal and three concealed by the greater covertsj. 







16 . 


of light greyish-brown, becoming lighter on the edges 
of the outer webs. The primaries are crossed by nine 
transverse lines of square spots of mottled pale grey 
on the outer webs. The spots nearer the tips are quite 
indistinct except for the terminal bar. The middle 
secondaries and tail feathers are coarsely mottled with 
dusky brown or greyish-white and this color tends to 
form irregular bars. The rest of the tail is dusky 
and crossed by about nine paler bands that are marked 
off by a narrow line or edging of grey that in turn 
encloses a greyish-brown and sometimes slightly mottled 
space. Towards the base of the tail feathers the 
mottling is somewhat more confused and the bands are 
broken up. The basic color of the underparts is 
greyish-white. Each feather of the neck, abdomen, 
chest and breast has a broad, irregularly saw-toothed 
centre stripe of dusky brown or dull grey. The flanks, 
anal region and under tail coverts are narrowly banded 
with dull brown and greyish-white. The legs have 
narrower, more irregular bars. The "eyebrows 11 , lores 
and chin are greyish-white with a dark space immediately 
in front of the eye. The face is greyish-white with 
distinct concentric semicircular bars of greyish-brown. 
The facial circle is dark brown passing into a very 
pronounced white band on the foreneck (Pig. 9), This 
white band is in turn interrupted by a sizeable spot 
of brownish-black on the throat. The bill is dull, 
light-yellow and the iris lemon-yellow.

Adult Male 

Similar to the female but usually an over-all lighter 
color. The white on the foreneck is less pronounced. (Pig. 8) 
Immature 

In the downy stage the young are an overall greyish- 
white with the base of the down on the hind-neck, back, 
shoulders and wings sooty brown. The tips of down are 
pale dull buff. After the third week the immature birds 
show faint traces of barring on the lower breast and the 
semicircular rings about the eyes are pronounced. The 
tail is then about two inches long and shows barring. 

The feet are pale yellow with dark grey claws. The cere 
is orange-yellow and the pupil dark grey with the iris 
limpid yellow.

The Question of Subspecies 

The species is circumpolar in distribution and 
has presented difficulties to taxonomists in Europe 
and America. It is locally variable, while marked 
fading occurs in old skins, complicating the issue. 
This is evident in the recorded descriptions and 
attempted recognition of subspecies (Hartert 1920). 

Hartert recognizes three races in Eurasia, but 
later in his supplement (1932-33), repudiates them 
and reunites all of them Into one Old World Race, 
Scotiaptex nebulosa lapponica , the Lapp Owl. 

The Lapp Ow l is remarkably similar to the Ore at 
Gray in habitat, nesting, egg size, behaviour and 
plumage and measurements (Hagen 1952). 

Three skins on loan from the Chicago Natural 
History Museums and one from the New York Museum of 
Natural History were examined and compared wth G-reat 
Gray skins. Dr. Rowan examined and measured a lengthy 
series of Lapp and Great Gray Owl skins in the museums 
of Helsinki, Lund, Stockholm and London in 1954. This 
information has been Utilized in Table II, together 
&ith other measurements taken personally. 

Because of the value of the skins on loan and the 
decrepit condition of these specimens, only those 
measurements appearing in the table were possible.

Summary : 

Because of an. insufficient number of male Great Gray Owl 
skins, significant comparisons are restricted to the female 
of the two forms. 

1. Female Lapp Owls averaged 7*7 facial rings compared 
with 7.5 for female Great Grays. 


















22 


2# Female Lapp Owls averaged \\$ 1,6 mm, for length 
of left wing compared to 446,1}. for female 
Great Grays, 

3* Tail length for female Lapp Owls averaged 328 
mm,, compared with 333 for female Great Grays, 
Conclusions 

From the above limited comparisons, a close similarity 
between the two races is obvious. This is further corrobor 
ated by personal examination of such skins as have been 
available of both forms. The Old World race is in general 
paler and more conspicuously streaked on the breast (Figs, 
10,11), No other significant differences could be detected 
Dr, Amadon (personal correspondence). Curator of Birds in 
the American Museum of Natural History in New York and 
one of the leading taxonomists of the continent confirms 
this opinion. It is also substantiated in observations 
and measurements by Professor Rowan on a long series of 
skins of both forms in 1954* 

For thousands of years the Canadian and Eurasian 
birds must have beoi separated (since the Pleistocene 
period presumably) so that their striking similarity 
thus offers a point of theoretical interest, since 
isolation Is generally accepted as one of the chief 
factors In species formation (Huxley, 1940)* From the 
available facts one must assume that either a remarkable 
genetic stability, or similarity of habitat, has failed 
to Induce notable variation. It is interesting to note

that another owl with circumpolar distribution, the 
Snowy Oi%rl ( Nyctea nyctea ), has not a single recognized 
subspecies, However, nowhere does an isolated group exist* 
Owing to isolation the G-reat Gray Owls have varied in 
minor degrees from the Lapp Owl subspecies but their 
striking likeness suggests this process has not gone far 
(Ridgway, 1914)•

PTERYLOGRAPHY 

Feather Tracts 

The contour feathers of the Great Gray Owl may 
be divided into eight tracts; the capital, spinal, 
femoral, humeral, alar, crural, ventral and caudal 
tracts respectively (Figs. 12, 13). The boundaries 
of these tracts are quite easily seal and each tract 
may be divided into various subdivisions or regions. 

These however, are difficult to define. A true lumber 
tract is absent in this species. 

Methods of Investigating the Feather Tracts 

The various feather tracts were determined in three 
ways. The first method was to examine nestlings that had 
not yet grown contour feathers long enough to cover the 
apteria. The second method was to pluck carefully a 
dead adult bird and note the follicles from which the 
contour feathers spring. The third method was to skin 
an adult bird and carefully clean the skin and examine 
it from the inside. Feather tracts show up remarkably 
well in this manner. 

Short Description of the Various Tracts 

1. The Capital Tract - The feathers of the entire head 
are included in this tract. It passes over directly 
into the spinal and ventral tracts. 

2. The Spinal Tract - This pteryla. extends posteriorly 
from the capital tract to the upper tail coverts. 
Along the neck it is bordered on each side by the 























- 




of.

26 


cervical apterium, and along the trunk it is 
bordered on each side by a rather large lateral 
apterium. This tract is divisible into four regions 
which are identified mainly by their shape and 
location* There is a narrow interscapular region 
extending from the area between the shoulder blades 
posteriorly; a saddle shaped dorsal region extending 
from the shoulder region to a point approximately 
halfway to the tail and a narrow pelvic region lying 
between the hips and extending from the dorsal region 
to the tail coverts* 

3* The Humeral Tract - A short pteryla of strong growth 
found on each wing running obliquely backward on the 
brachium from the anterior end of the shoulder, where 
it barely coalesces with the feather tract below* 

The scapular feathers arise from this tract. 

!+. The Femoral Tract - A narrow but well developed tract 
on the upper outer surface of each femur, forming a 
sort of breeches. This is the only tract in this 
region, for a true lumbar tract is missing in this 
specie s* 

5* The Ventral Tract - This tract covers the lower surface 
of the neck and extends posteriorly almost to the anal 
ring* The outer branch of the inferior tract is free 
posteriorly, thus differing from Nitzsch & Burmeister»s (l81|0) 
description for the typical disc-faced ox^ls. 







27 


6. T he Crural, Tract - The remaining feathers of the legs 
are separated from the femoral tract by a narrow 
apterium* 

7. The Caudal Tract - This pteryla includes the rectrices, . 
and the upper and undertail coverts® The rectrices 
number twelve. 

8. The Alar Tract - Includes all the feathers of the 
wing except the humeral tract on which the scapulars 
are carried. The remiges or flight feathers are 
divided into three chief groups; the primaries, 
secondaries and tertiaries. There are 10 primaries 
with 10 greater primary coverts. The 12 secondaries 
are borne on the ulna. Secondary number five Is 
missing but its covert Is present. A wing which 
lacks the fifth secondary is said to show diastataxy 
or acquintocubitalism. It Is met with in nearly all 
the lieognathine birds save the Passeres (Pyeraft, 1910). 
The first primary is emarginated on the inner vane near 
the apex. The second primary is emarginated on the 
inner goad outer vane near the apex; the third and 
fourth are like the second: the fifth is slightly 
emarginated on the outside of the vane with noticeable 
emargination on the inside; and the sixth shows only a 
very slight emargination on the outer vane. 

The alula has four feathers, excluding the 


coverts

Feather Structure 

The Great Gray Owl is remarkable for the softness 
and lightness of its plumage. It was thought of interest 
to include a brief comparison of its feather structure 
with that of the Great Horned Owl, 

The feathers of chief interest are those from the 
upper and lower breast and the upper back* These are 
the fluffiest contour feathers in owls, 

A careful examination of these feathers revealed 
the following: 

1* The feathers from both species possess only 

vestigial barbicels as revealed under microscopic 
inspection, 

2, The average length of a Great Gray Owl upper 

breast feather is 170 mm, and that of the Horned 
110 mm. The Great Gray Owl upper back feathers 
average 105 m* as compared with 80 mm, for the 
Great Horned Owl. 

3« The number of barbs on a typical Great Gray upper 
back feather average 16 per cm.. The Great Horned 
averages 21 per cm., Breast feathers of the Great 
Gray average 13 barbs per cm., the Great Horned 17. 

4-. The extreme lightness and softness of the Great Gray 
contour feathers is further due to the extra length 
and fewer barbules per barb. 




31. 


Molt 

Only limited observations were available on 
the molting process of this species. The observations 
recorded here were obtained from a captive male, which 
had been in confinement since the late summer of 1954- 
(Fig. 14). Up to August 15th, 1955 the molt had 
proceeded as follows: 

The bird commenced molting during the latter 
part of June and by August 15 th had undergone these 
plumage changes: 

1. All the rectrices have grown in with the 
central two or deck feathers having been 
the first dropped. Under and upper tail 
coverts are now completely grown in. 

2. Primaries 3,4, and 5 (counting from the 
outside in) have been replaced on both 
wings, and secondaries 1,4, 6 , 7,8 and 9 
are newly grown in. Molt appears to have 
been completed for the secondary coverts 
which appeared to be lost simultaneously. 
The alula has completed its molt. The 
middle and lesser coverts appear to be 
shed and replaced somewhat irregularly 
with very few new feathers appearing thus 
far.

. 





. 






, . . . 

































32 


3. The lateral areas of the breast molt 

first. The molt continues posteriorly, 

I4., The part of the back to molt first is 
the area between the shoulders, and the 
feathers appear to be replaced in both 
directions, 

5>, The feathers as yet not molted are those 
at the front of the head, back of neck, 
centre of back, chin, tibio-tarsus and 
tarsus. 

Normal molting proceedure is often completely 
upset in captive birds, so a detailed record of feather 
sequence is thus of doubtful validity, . 



Pig, 14* Dorsal view of molting Great Gray, 

The new feathers appear darker than the 
old ones. 








33 


Bye Color 

When the young are less than ten days old the 
iris is a very pale yellow and the pupil a greyish 
blue* As the owls become older the yellow strengthens 
and the pupil becomes a darker grey* By the time the 
young are three weeks old the pupil has become a very dark 
blue and at the end of the sixth week the young owls 
possess dark pupils and the typical lemon-colored iris 
of the mature bird* Compared with those of the Great 
Horned Owl the eyes are considerably smaller* 





ANATOMY 


This being primarily a field study of the Great 
Gray Owl, no detailed anatomical study of the species 
has been attempted* In any case the paucity of material 
has precluded any such undertaking* Since the anatomy 
of the bird is virtually unknown hox-jever, the following 
facts are recorded* 

Intestinal tracts were taken from two adult, male 
and female specimens of the Great Gray that had undergone 
considerable disintegration after a lengthy period in 
formalin preservative. A complete tract was also taken 
from a freshly killed adult female Great Horned Owl. A 
brief comparison of the intestinal tracts of both 
species was thought to be of interest (Fig. 15>). 

1* The caeca of the Great Gray measured 72 mm* in length 
compared to 90 ram. for the Great Horned Owl. 

2. The large Intestine of the Great Gray was Lj.2 mm. 
in length; the Great Horned 70 mm. 

3. The small intestine of the Great Gray exclusive of 
the duodenum, appears larger in diameter. 

II. The caecal diameter of the Great Gray is also 
slightly larger. 

5>. The pancreas of the Great Gray appears smaller than 
that of the Great Horned*

6, The gizzard, gall bladder and kidney appear to 
be of equal size in both species* 

7* Better differentiation of the proventriculus from 
the gizzard vr&s noticed in the Great Horned Owl, 

8. The heart and liver of the Great Gray appear 

larger than the same organs of the Great Horned. 

The intestinal tract of the Great Gray presents 
no remarkable difference from that of the Great Horned 
Owl. Both species appear to conform to the general 
anatomy of owls as outlined by Gadoxtf & Selenka (1891 
and Pycraft (1910).

Skeleton 


Only one complete 

skeleton of an adult Great 

Gray Owl was available 

for study and the chief 

structural differences 

between this and the skeleton 


of an adult G-reat Horned Owl were noted. 

The feet afford a striking difference, those 
of the G-reat Gray being half the size of the Homed 
Owl’.s. The leg lengths of the two species are fairly 


similar. Measurements 

of the leg bones are as follows: 

GREAT GRAY 

GREAT HORNED 

Femur 85mm. 

85mm. 

Tibio-tarsus 110mm. 

120mm. 

Tarsus 55mm. 

60mm. 

Middle toe 57mm. 

and ©Idw 

92mm. 


Wing bones also show little difference in the 
two species and are listed as follows: 


GREAT GRAY 

GREAT HORNED 

Humerus 125mm. 

140mm. 

Ulna 130mm. 

150mm. 

Manus 100mm. 

110mm. 


Another outstanding difference between the two 
skeletons lies in the sternum and rib structures and 
correlated muscles. The G-reat G-ray possesses a smaller 
sternum and lighter ribs. The sternum of the Great Gray 
measured 50 mm. in length and that of the Horned Owl 70mm 









38 


The shoulder girdle, sternum and all correlated 
muscles are so much lighter and weaker in the Great Gray 
Owl as to prevent it from preying on anything but small 
quarry* 

Skull 

The palate, desmognathous (indirect), is typical 
of owls (Stresemann, 1934)* The eap apertures of the 
Great Gray Owl show remarkable asymmetry. The aperture 
on the left side of the skull is noticeably larger 
than that of the right side (Pigs. 16,17). Fycraft 
(1910) bas described this modification for Tengmalra T s 
Owl (Aeg ollus funereus ) as follows: 

!, 0n the left side of the head the combined post¬ 
orbital process and tympanic wing of the exoccipital 
forms a large outstanding shield extending downwards to 
the level of the lower jaw so as to leave a narrow chink 
between itself and the bony ring of sclerotic plates 
surrounding the eye. The chink traced inwards gives way 
to a large chamber, in the floor of which will be found 
the passage to the middle ear. On the right side this 
chamber is wholly exposed but for a tongue-shaped plate 
of bone which, extending forward to the bony rim of the 
eye, encloses the lower half, leaving a small triangular 
space lying immediately above the lower jaw.” 

The skull of the Great Gray Owl conforms very closely 
to this modification. No special significance has been 
attached to this asymmetry.

DISTRIBUTION AND MOVEMENTS 


Breeding Range 

Daring the nesting season this species is found as 
far north as Alaska and south as far as the Yosemite 
Valley in California (Bent, 1938)# Definite nesting 
records for the latter region exist (Bleitz, personal 
correspondence)* Two nests were recorded by Craighead 
(personal correspondence) for Wyoming* Roberts (1932) 
has found the birds nesting in (Fig. 18) northern 
Minnesota* There are a few other observations that 
suggest successful nesting in other locations. Among 
these are the G-aspe country of Quebec, northern Ontario 
(Taverner, 1912), northern Manitoba and northern 
Saskatchewan, Alberta dnd British Columbia. 

, No authentic nesting records have been established 
for Saskatchewan or British Columbia (Bard, personal 
correspondence; Munro & Cowan, 1947)• Alberta has 
yielded twenty-three established nesting records. They 
Include thirteen nests found by Henderson in the Belvedere 
area, five by Randall in the Athabaska country, two by 
Twomey in the Fawcett district, one by Dippie (Macoun, 
(1909) in the Red Deer district in 1896 and two found 
by the author In the Edson and Rocky Mountain House 
regions (Fig* 19). 

Alaska and Arctic Canada have produced three further 
nesting records. However, Cade (personal correspondence, 
1953) states the bird is now extremely rare in Alaska.

McDonald (personal correspondence, 195>2) believes the 
birds breed in various wooded sections of the North 
West Territories being more common to the south and west 
of Great Slave Lake and extending down the McKenzie 
river to Fort Good Hope. Two nests have been noted by 
McDonald in this region. He considers the species very 
rare for the region. 

Preble (1908) records one nest along the McKenzie 
river and has a record of another nest with two eggs 
taken at Fort Providence. McFarlane (1908) in a manu¬ 
script list, records a nest containing two fresh eggs 
near Fort Good Hope. Apparently the breeding range for 
this species is in the timbered regions of central and 
northern Canada, from Hudson Bay west to Alaska and the 
Pacific coast, and south in the mountains to central 
California. 

Winter Range 

This species is not known to undertake regular 
southward movements, but at times (possibly owing to a 
food shortage) it extensively invades more southern (Bent,1938) 
regions. In years past great numbers of these owls came 
through southern Ontario and extended as far south as 
Massachusetts, New York and Wisconsin, To the west they 
have been recorded during the winter in Oregon, Iowa, 

Indiana, Nebraska, Montana, Washington and southern

British Columbia (Pig. 18). Ontario, particularly the 
Toronto area, had its last substantial invasion during 
the winter of 1889-90. These flights continued until 
the winter of IvlO-ll and then apparently ceased. Since 
then four birds have occurred in the Toronto region (Baillie, 
1947)* According to Dippie (Macoun, 1909) during the 
winter of lu9b, Alberta was alive x^ith owls of every 
description. Great Grays being particularly abundant. 

The great southward movements ceased in Alberta more 
than thirty years ago. Wolfe 1 s (Edmonton) taxidermy 
records bear this out. It is estimated that at least 
half a dozen Great Gray Owls a.re shot each winter in 
areas in Alberta where they normally do not occur. 

Banding Recoveries 

The U.S. Pish and Wildlife Service records reveal 
that prior to this study only two Great Gray Owls 
had ever been banded. These were adults taken at 
Centre Island, Toronto, Ontario by H.H. Southam on 
January 18, 1947. 

Two young x*rere banded by the author In June 195>4 in 
the Rocky Mountain House region and a third in June 
of the same year in the Edson area. No banding recoveries 
have ever been reported (Duvall, personal correspondence).

■NESTING 

Type of' Woods Preferred 

In Alberta the most frequently chosen nesting 
territories appear to be the large white or black 
poplar woods. These poplar stands may be lightly 
mixed with either black spruce or jack pine. Nests 
are preferably near a sizeable muskeg. These muskegs 
are characterized by a variable mixture of trees, 
shrubs, grasses, sedges, horsetails, mosses and 
lichens. They conform in general to those described 
by Moss (1953), for northwestern Alberta. This is the 
hunting habitat for the male bird during the nesting 
period. Great tracts of these heavy poplar woods were 
once common throughout most of central and northern 
Alberta but are now chiefly confined to areas in the 
north-west and northern parts of the province. The 
typical Great Gray nesting woods are deep and secluded 
and well removed from agricultural activities. 

The Nest 

Randall (op. cit.) and Henderson (op. cit.) believe 
this owl does not build its own nest, feut prefers to 
make use of those discarded by other raptors. In Alberta 
the species has made use of the nests previously occupied 
by Red Tailed Hawks, Goshawks, Great Horned Owls and 
occasionally Grows. Twice Randall found the birds 
nesting on the top of an old spruce stump. 









The twenty-three nests found in Alberta were in 
the following locations, with the height indicated 
in feet*

Position and Condition 

In the deciduous trees the site is usually in a 
crotch formed by two or three main branches (Fig. 21). 
Other nests found in coniferous trees were in heavy 
branches near the trunk. 

The birds will frequently use nests in such flimsy 
and decrepit condition that the eggs are plainly 
visible from beneath. Neither Henderson nor Randall 
noticed any attempt by the birds to recondition the 
nest. Twomey (Bent, 1938) noted that one nest he 
discovered near Fawcett contained fresh tips of green 
pine needles and some newly added twigs. Personal 
observations agree with the findings of Henderson and 
Randall. 

Selection of the Nesting Site 

Henderson (op. cit.) reports the birds are seen and 
heard in the general vicinity of the nesting site 
approximately three weeks prior to actual nesting. The

birds are then quite noisy and the long-drawn hoot of 
the male is heard for some distance. The site is 
usually selected by the first week in April adid 
frequently the birds return to the nest of a previous 
year. The birds remain vociferous until well after 
the nesting has commenced. 

Courtship 

In the early summer of 1954 I observed a pair of 
captive G-reat G-ray Owls undergoing what appeared to 
be a form of courtship activity. 

The male would fly to the female’s stump and face 
her. Standing face to face with breasts touching, he. 
would commence rubbing his beak over hers, at the same 
time uttering a faint droning or humming sound. Often 
he would circle her face with his beak in a similar 
manner. This was observed regularly for eight days 
and would occur at anytime during the day or night. 

The female died a short time after this activity 
was observed and a post mortem examination revealed 
slight ovarian development, while the oviduct appeared 
more enlarged than one would expect in the quiescent state. 
The ovary was approximately three times the size of an 
inactive organ, which would suggest that she was at 
least partially in breeding condition. 

A similar courtship has been recorded for Barred 


Owls (Bent 1936)

Nesting Density 


An accurate estimate of the nesting density of this 
species is extrenely difficult to determine owing to the 
small number of nests located. The fact that the 
brochure circulated throughout northern Alberta revealed 
only two nests is some indication that this species does 
not have a heavy nesting density in the province. Whan one 
considers that trappers cover every square mile of 
Alberta*s remaining wilderness at a time when the birds 
are most conspicuous and noisy, it may be assumed that 
the birds are, in fact, very scarce. 

THE EG-G-S 

Egg Dates 

The earliest Alberta record for a complete clutch 
is March 23* The majority of nests have complete sets 
by the 15th of April. Dates for complete sets in the 
province are as follows: 

March 23, March 30, April 1, April 6, April 10, 

April 11, April 20, April 22, April 25>, April 27, 

April 29, May 1, May 5, May 7, and June I}.* 

These are not first egg dates, but when egg collectors 
happened to find the nest. 

Number 

The number of eggs laid varies from two to five with 
three per clutch being the most common (Pig. 20) and two 










5o 


the next. Of the tx^enty-three nests for which records 
have been obtained, three contained five eggs, five had 
four eggs, nine contained three, and six two eggs. 

Color 

The color is dull white and there appears to be no 
visible difference in this respect from the color of the 
eggs of other owls (Henderson, op. cit.). 

Shape and Measurements 

The eggs are small for the size of the bird, and 
are not so round as the eggs of most other owls, being 
between oval and elliptical-oval in shape (Henderson, 
op. cit.). The shell is not glossy but is rather roughly 
granulated. Measurements of twenty-four eggs from Alberta 
nests average 54*3 mnu by .ip mm.. The eggs showing the 
four extremes measure 63.5 by IjJB, 52 by 43• 9, and 55 by 
40«8 . Bent T s measurements for 52 eggs are as follows 
Average, 54*2 by 43*4 extremes 58«7 by ^9, k8 by 42, 
and 53•4 by 41 mm. 

The type specimen egg(TfolO277) was collected from a 
set of two by Mr. J. Sibbiston near Pt. Yukon, Alaska 
in April, 1864 (Bendire, 1892). 

Incubation Period 

Unfortunately the nests found in the course of this 
investigation both contained newly hatched young and no 

incubation data are available. An exhaustive check of all 
other available literature on this species has revealed nothing.

51 . 


Henderson (op. cit.) and Randall (op. cit.) consider 
all the incubation to be performed by the female. She 
does not leave the nest even to eat as the male brings 
her the food which she devours on the spot. Of the 
several nests that Henderson ooserved, he never once 
saw the male incubating.

It is interesting to note that the remains of a 
dead Barred Owl ( Strix varia ) were found quite near the 
base of a Great Gray ! s nesting tree near Rocky Mountain 
House* The body was too decomposed to enable a determina¬ 
tion as to cause of death* A Barred Owl was also heard 
hooting in the Edson area very close to the site of 
another Great Gray nest* The little SIhte-colored Junco 
was the only bird that was noticed objecting vigorously 
to the presence of the owls* The owls paid no attention 
to the smaller birds* 

Reactions to Intruders 

Man 

I can think of no Alberta bird which is less wary 
of man than the Great Gray Owl. The female will 
normally sit very tight if she is on eggs or small 
young and often it requires strenuous pounding of the 
nest tree to force her off. Henderson and Randall (op. 
cit.) recall several occasions when the female almost 
allowed herself to be touched by the investigator 
climbing the tree. The male is invariably some distance 
from the nest and will call repeatedly in a low, long- 
drawn hoot. When the female does leave the nest she will 
commence regular hooting of a short, plaintive nature 
(Pig. 25) while perched in an adjacent tree. 

After the eggs have hatched, the female becomes

more solicitous about the nest, and beak-snapping 
and more excited calling will result if the young 
in the nest are handled. When the young have 
reached the age of three weeks, the female becomes 
even bolder, and on one occasion at the Rocky Mountain 
House nest site, flew menacingly at the author. She 
continued vigorous beak-snapping and would often 
perch a foot from the nest, while the young were 
being examined (Pig, 22.),

Other Intruders 



Pig* 23 Great Gray female In defensive 


On one occasion a Red-tailed Hawk was seen diving 
at a female Great Gray Owl* The owl immediately 
assumed a defensive attitude, hunching the shoulders 
and fluffing out the feathers (Pig. 23)* She made no 
attempt to fly at the hawk, which in turn made no 
further assaults. 

The presence of dogs near the nest always caused 
the female owl to adopt the same defensive pose.

55 . 

VOICE 

Introduction 

Randall (personal correspondence) notes that the 
chief obstacle to observing the owls out of the breeding 
season is their remarkable quietness, an observation 
corroborated by three captive birds kept over the past 
two years. These birds only became vocal with the advent 
of the mating season, and when assuming a defensive pose. 

During the breeding season the male emits a very long- 
drawn call which lacks the depth and throatiness of the 
common Great Horned Owl# The female ! s response is always 
a shorter and somewhat screechier note and again bears no 
resemblance to the deep hooting of the Horned Owl, 

Henderson (1923) was the first to draw attention to the 
remarkable differences in the quality of sounds produced 
by the Great Gray Owl and the Great Horned Owl. 

In the following list the various notes the owls 
utter and the circumstances under which each call is 
given, are described. 

Voice of Adult Female 

1# A soft, dove-like ooh-ah, at times very weak and 

more like a coo than a hoot# The sound is not loud 
and carries no great distance, usually tapering to a 
high raspy note at the end# It is repeated at irregular 
intervals throughout the day when the bird sits on the 
nest or perches in adjacent trees (Fig# 25)#

2. An excited, intense hooting like ooh-uh repeated 
quickly and loudly. This was the signal that the 
male was arriving with food and she would immediately 
begin to hunch on the nest and continue to call until 
she had taken the food from him. 

3 . A fast repeated but faint who-who-who-who-, uttered 

by the female when assuming a defensive attitude. This 
note and attitude has also been recorded in captive 
birds when alarmed by people or cats prowling nearby. 

Voice of Adult Male 

1. A long-drawn hoot rather like a whistle, whoo-oo-oo 
uttered near the nest, and often heard when the male 
could not be seen. It was often emitted when the 
bird if as hunting in the muskeg. 

2. A steady rumbling or pumping noise like oom-ah, 00 m- 
ah, repeated for a minute or two and then started 
again whenever the male came close to the nest and 
the young were being handled. The throat of the male 
could be observed to maintain a pump-like motion and 
the beak appeared not to open. 

3. A screechy whistle-like ee-ah, eee-ah has been 
recorded only from captive birds and is uttered at 
any time throughout the day most frequently in the 
spring and early summer. 

Voice of the Young 

1. When still in the nest, the young would emit a very 
raspy screech, appearing to indicate hunger. These 
sounds would subside as the young were being fed and 
give way to a soft, chirp-like utterance. 





.

57 


2, A much louder, screech-like noise, eee-ih, emitted 
by the young after they had left the nest. An 
imitation of this sound proved the best way to locate 
the adults after the young had entered the hunting 
muskeg. 

Some authors attribute a tremulous, vibrating noise 
to this species (Bendire, 1892$• I have never heard it 
and Henderson and Randall have never recorded it. 

Activities of the Female on the Nest 

During the incui.bation period the female sits very 
quietly on the nest. She arises occasionally to preen 
herself and to turn the eggs. The bird is most attentive 
to all movements, and watches all actions with great 
curiosity (Henderson, op.cit.). The female was observed 
sleeping beside two-week-old young at which time they 
presumably no longer required brooding. The mother will 
continue to remain near the nest at all times until the 
young are old enough to leave. She shades them during 
excessively hot weather and often sits with them after(Pig. 2l±) 
a meal. After the young are three weeks old, the female 
spends very little time about the actual nest, though 
remaining always in the immediate vicinity. 

Activities of the Male About the Nest 

Henderson and Randall (op.cit.) never saw the male 
bird incubating. He visits the female at the nest 
regularly with food and spends almost all his time hunting, 
never lingering about the nest after offering her the food. 

As the young become older, the female will fly from the 
nest to meet the male for the food exchange.

He usually approaches the nest from the same 
direction and leaves by the same route. 

Feeding Times and Places of Adults and Young 

Before the Nest i ng Season 

Great Gray Owls do most of their hunting prior 
to the nesting season in the late afternoon. Their 
activities during this period will only be sufficient 
to allay their own hunger, when prey will be eaten on the 
handiest stump. With the advent of the family the 
male inevitably increases his hunting activities, he 
being the sole provider. 

During Incubation 

No personal observations were made at this time 
but Henderson*s notes describe the activity as similar 
to that carried on after incubation. 

After Incubation 

During the first ten days of the life of the 
young owls the male is making rapid and frequent trips 
with food to the nest. A typical feeding schedule for 
a day during this period is as follows:

is as follows:

3rd !t 12.30 PM 

4 th " 5.30 n 

5th " 5.50 " 


During the third and fourth weeks the visits became 
less frequent with not more than three trips per day 
recorded. The infrequency of daytime feeding despite 
numerous fresh pellets or castings, suggested supplemen¬ 
tary feed.ing by night. A typical schedule for a day 
during this period is as follows: 

May 23/54 1st Feeding 8.00 AM 

2nd " 11.30 " 

3rd ” 3.40 PM 

The fourth week’s daily feeding schedule was more 
difficult to determine for the young were away from the 
nest and continually shifting location. Night feeding was 
again indicated. As the trips by the adults with food 
became less frequent, the young birds also became more 
silent in contrast to their earlier behaviour. 

Food was always transferred from the beak. Never 
was the male observed to carry prey in his claws and 
the female always accepted it from the male with her 
beak.

Description of the Young 
Ten Days Old (Approximately) 

The young are still covered in downy feather 
growth, that appears greyish, ashy white (Pig* 26). 
The bill is yellow with darkish-blue in front of the 
nares. The pupil is bluish with the iris greenish 
yellow. The cere is yellowish orange. 

Fourteen Days Old (Approximately ) 

The downy feathering has acquired a distinct 
asny grey throughout. Faint barrings are visible in 
the scapular region (Fig* 27). The breast is lighter 
and more creamy grey, the cere greenish yellow 
with a very pronounced centre piece, orange in color.

Quite a number of feathers can now be seen pro¬ 
truding through the dense dox^n. A faint tint of brown 
around the eyes and the first semblance of a facial 
disc-ring is noted developing about the eyes (Fig, 28). 
The hindneck has become more brownish while the back and 
wings show signs of feather growth. Barring over the back 
is noticeable with alternating dark and light coloring 
of an ashy brown. The tarsus is well covered

in ashy grey down, bristle-like feathers around the 
cere are black and approximately half an inch in length. 
The pupil is darkish blue and the iris a weak limpid 
yellow. Joint of the tarsus and the metatarsus is pale 
orange in color.

By this time the owls are almost completely covered 
with feathers except for the down of the head, legs and 
abdomen (Pig. 29). The rectrices are developing

well and showing signs of barring. The facial 
rings about the eyes are getting conspicuous, with 
a more pronounced brown color.

Forty Days Old 

The back is now well feathered with no traces 
of remaining down. The (first remiges are well 
developed with some downy growth still near the 
rectrices (Fig. 30). The head is still downy but

feathers are beginning to cover the tarsi and feet. 
Feathers are also developing on the abdomen. The 
head has a frosty appearance of greyish-brown with 
white. There is a better development of the facial 
rings about the eye. The joint between tarsus and 
tibio-tarsus is bare and orange in color. The bill 
is green with a yellow tip. The cere is less orange 
and somewhat greener. The iris remains pale 
yellow with the pupil a bit darker blue than 
previously noted.

Summary 

1. Length of Bill From Commissural Point 

At fourteen days of age the bill is approximately 
half grown. There is a gradual increase until at 
forty days of age the beak is very close to full sixe. 

2. Length of Head and Bill 

From a length of 77 mm. at ten days the head and 
bill grow rapidly, almost attaining full length 
at 28 days and reaching maximum length at forty days. 

3• Length of Gere 

From the tenth day on there was no change in length 
of cere. It measured 20 ram. throughout the study 
pe riod. The adult measurement averages 23 mm. 

4* Weight 

After the twenty-eighth day the weight increases from 
twenty to twenty-six ounces. After the twenty- 
eighth day the young are moving more, making the 
first attempts at flapping their wings and muscle 
development is gradually taking place. The average 
weight for adult males is thirty-two ounces and 
forty for females. 

3?. Length of Humerus and Ulna 

At fourteen days the ulna is 70 ram. long and at 
twenty-one and twenty-eight days it measures 100 
ram. On the fortieth day it measured 128 mm. The 
humerus measured 73 ram. at ten days, and at 















75 


twenty-one and twenty-eight it measured 87 
and 108 mm. respectively. It is now about 8mm. 
longer than the ulna but by the fortieth day the 
ulna exceeds the humerus by 6-7 mm. Meng (1951) 
found a similar variation in Coopers 9 Hawks at 
twenty-eight day s. 

6. Wing Spread 

The greatest period of growth for the wing .spread 
occurs between the fourteenth and twenty-first 
days with the increase from 430** to 645 mm., 

7• Length of Middle Toe and Nail 

Very little difference is shown in this measurement 
from 38 mm. at fourteen days, to 45 mm. at forty 
days. Adult average is 60 mm., 

8. Length of Tarsus, Tibio-tarsus and Femur 

The tarsus also shows very little increase from 
37 mm. at fourteen days to 50 mm. at forty days. 
(Adult birds average 60 mm.) The Tibio-tarsus 
measured 75 mm. at fourteen days and 105 mm. at

Behavior Development of Youn^c 

At ten days of age the young reach up eagerly 
for the small pieces of meat the female feeds them. 

The female holds these pieces lightly in her beak 
and the young snatch and swallow them. 

The nest is kept quite clean since the young, 
when defecating, will back to the edge of the nest 
and discharge over the side. At this time they are 
not in the least aggressive but remain quiet when 
handled either in or out of the nest. From the 
twenty-first day on they begin to show increasing 
signs of Aggressiveness (Fig. 38). They are now 
standing up in the nest and show interest in moving 
objects about them such as flies. When handled they 
indulge in beak snapping and clawing. After the 
twenty-eighth day the young are out of the nest and 
attempt short flights but seldom more than a few feet. 
They are surprisingly agile and climb and flap their 
way up leaning poles and limbs. When they have reached 
their fortieth day they may be as far as a mile from 
the nest, making excellent headway with short flights. 
They are still moving as a family group.

FOOD HABITS 

Introduction 

ureat u-ray owls like all other members of the 
Strigidae capitalize on their silent flight and acute 
sense of hearing'and sight. Their flight is not swift 
and the birds rely on accuracy of location and a noiseless 
approach rather than speed. 

Method of Hunting 

This species prefers to hunt in muskeg country. 

Except at the nesting period when the male hunts by (Fig. 
39.) day, these owls are crepuscular. At dusk these 
birds are seen perched high on old tamarack stubs waiting 
to make a floating swoop at their prey, invariably mice or 
voles. The birds have been observed performing a gliding 
series of flights from stub to stub throughout a muskeg 
and occasionally stooping to pick up quarry. The flight 
is soft and measured and appears much slower than that 
of the Great Horned Owl. Infrequently the birds hunt in 
the heavy spruce and poplar woods where the method is 
to sit and wait for some form of prey that will be seen 
and heard. When perched, the owls assume a face down 
attitude (Fig. Li_0.) as if listening and watching for 
what may move on the ground. They then seem so intent on 
their task that they can always be approached with ease.

Prey 

Over a four year period a study has been made 
of the stomach contents from all available specimens 
collected in Alberta (Table III). Further study was 
made on pellets collected at the nest under observation 
(Table V). Identification of all the remains was based 
mainly on skull characteristics. This work was kindly 
carried out by Dr. J.E. Moore. 

An exhaustive search of the literature reveals 
only one other listing of stomach contents for this 
species. It is quoted in Table IV, (Fisher, 1893 ).

Bent (1938) records that Dr.W.H. Hall took no 
less than thirteen skulls and other remains of Arctic 
Red Polls ( Acanthis hornemannl ), from the crop of a 
single bird. Bent also states that Swarth 
found in the stomach of one an adult Red Squirrel.

Summary 

Tables III, IV, and V indicate that this species 
feeds almost entirely on small mammals. The Northern 
Bog Lemming ( Synaptomys borealis ), twice recorded from 
Great Gray Owl stomach contents and pellets, is rarely taken 
by Alberta mammal collectors. 

Evidence of Spruce and Ruffed grouse feathers near 
the nests at Eds on and Rocky Mountain House suggest 
that if driven by hunger, these birds can take larger 
quarry than usual. The fact is significant however, 
that although Red Squirrels ( Tamlasclurus hudsonicus ) 
a/bounded in both nesting areas, no evidence that they 
were being preyed upon came to light. Red Squirrels 
are common throughout the range of the Great Gray Owl,

but the evidence to date lends no support to the 
constant charge of the trapping fraternity that this 
species preys habitually on them* It is the argument 
put.forth by most trappers who doubtless have had Red 
Squirrels at some time torn from their snares (Pig* Lpl) 
by owls of the northern forests, that all of the specie 
are guilty of this action. Pew trappers are able to 
accurately identify the culpable species* 



Pig* lj.1. Snared Red Squirrels. Trappers accuse 


the Great Gray of destroying such catches 

Some sources (Bendire, 1892) maintain that the 
Snowshoe Hare ( Lepus amer 1c anus ) is the principal 
quarry of the Great Gray Owl, but no evidence to this 
effect was uncovered in this study* 








85 . 

ENEMIES 


Mam 

Without question man is the prime destroyer of Great 
Gray Owls and predatory birds in general. Trappers, 
poultry-men, and sportsmen are the die-hard enemies of all 
owls. This species always allows a close approach and 
presents an easy target to thoughtless people with guns, 
and as a consequence its numbers have declined to one 
point where its very existence is threatened. 

Pole traps are perhaps the most viciuus and deadly 
set-up that man has devised to kill predatory birds, and 
owls in particular. A number of pole traps around a pheasant 
enclosure near Barrhead took a constant toll of owls in¬ 
cluding such rare species as Richardson*s and Great Grays 
during the winters of I9I18 to 1953 * Personal investiga¬ 
tion of this farm revealed the numbers of raptors taken 
to be past counting. During the winter of 195>2 and part 
of 1953 a pole trap device near Gross Lake (Figs. Lj_2,!f3)j 
Alberta was investigated. The toll of birds for that 
period amounted to 92 dreat Horned Owls, three Great Grays 
and one Barred Owl. The feet were identified and counted 
by the author. 

Black Bears 

This species lives in black bear country. Numerous 
trees containing unu.s.e d - raptors* nests bear the claw 
marks of black bears, suggesting that they have at some 
time climbed to the nest either for eggs or young. 












86 


Henderson (1920) believes this is a common occurrence 
when bears 1 smell or hear young birds at the nest*

G-reat Homed Owls 

In the Corbett Creek district evidence was 
uncovered that the Great Gray does fall victim to 
this powerful bird. A trapper had reported seeing 
a Homed Owl fly at a bird he thought might be a 
Great Gray Owl. An inspection of the area revealed 
a freshly killed Great Gray (Fig. 44) and the 
remaining evidence was characteristic for the 
predation of the Great Homed Owl. Otto Borg, a 
veteran trapper in the Ft. Assiniboine country reports 
that he saw three instances of this action during the 
winter of 1954. In years of low Snowshoe Hare 
populations the Homed Owl is doubtless driven to 
taking what it can.

PARASITES AND DISEASES 

Parasites 

1* Two well preserved specimens of feather lice 

( Mallophaga ) were taken from the body of a bird 
shot at Anzac, Alberta, Provincial entomologist 

J, H, Brown kindly forwarded the specimens to Dr, 

K, C, Emerson, University of Oklahoma, Stillwater, 
Oklahoma, for identification. His determination 
was the genus Kurodaia with no species as yet 
named. Of the several Great Gray Owls examined 
for this parasite, only the bird from which these 
specimens were taken possessed any, 

2, Seventeen round wormd were taken from the abdominal 
cavity and the small intestinal tract of a Great 
Gray Owl shot at Sangudo, Alberta, The round wormd 
were identified by Dr, L,P,E, Ghoquette, Institute 

of Parasitology, Ottawa, as of the genus Porroccaecum 
spp. They have been reported from species of owls 
from many parts of the world. The bird was in poor 
condition* 

3 , Blood smears from a deceased captive specimen 
revealed a number of letikocytozoons • At certain 
stages in the development of these parasites there is 
considerable amount of liver damage. This particular 
bird revealed a much distended gall bladder and numerous

hemorrhages in the liver tissue. A few coliform 
bacilli, Staphlococcus gibus, and an ft 3 $ negative 
paracolon bacillus were isolated during the post 
mortem examination of this bird, kindly conducted 
by Dr. Bigland of the Provincial Veterinary 
Laboratory. 

4. While performing a red cell count on a live G-rsat 
Bray Owl, Dr. Bigland noted that a large number of 
inclusion bodies could be seen within some of the 
red blood cells. These were believed to be parasites, 
either Haemoproteus or an avian form of P lasmodium 
spp.. 

Disease s 

1. Microscopic examination of the faeces from a bird 
shot near Sangudo, Alberta, revealed several coccidial 
oocysts. Goccidiosis is a disease infecting the small 
intestine caused by the Coccidium sp.. 

2. Post-mortem examination of a captive bird revealed 
that death was due to Aspergillosis. This disease is 
caused by a common fungus, A spergillus fumlaatus . 

The symptoms are a shortness of breath and a quick 
heaving of the body, especially the lower part of 
the abdomen. If the mouth is examined a white cheese¬ 
like deposit may be seen. It is interesting to note 
that almost every Goshawk ( Astur atricapillus ) kept 
by the author for falconry, eventually has succumbed 
to this disease. The fungus is apparently already

active internally at the time of capture. The 
time for its advance through the bird's internal 
system varies. This particular owl had been in 
captivity for a month and was eating well but Dr. 
Bigland believes the bird had been infected for some 
time prior to capture. A dose of four grains of 
phenothiazine for each pound of body weight has 
met with some success in treating this disease in 
Goshawks. 

ECONOMIC STATUS 

G-enerally the Great Gray Owl remains in wilderness 
regions where its small mammal eating habits will have 
no direct effect on agricultural activities. However, 
its quite evident 'bousing" habits would make the birds 
desirable even in settled fanning areas. No substantial 
evidence has yet been unearthed to convict these birds 
as Red Squirrel killers. The few game birds such as 
Ruffed and Spruce Grouse that the owls may take, makes 
not the slightest difference to the over-all game bird 
population, especially when considered in the light of 
the cyclic fluctuations of game bird numbers. 

CONCLUSION 

The Great Gray Owl is now so rare a species that 
it deserves protection under all circumstances, regardless 
of its habits. It is harmless and interesting and much 
remains to be learned about it. This task becomes 











































.

increasingly difficult with the numbers steadily 
diminishing. The owls still have a vast breeding 
range left, and only complete protection through 
enforced legislation will ensure the survival of 
America 1 s largest but least known owl. 

On the basis of the material presented in this 
study it is evident that this bird is primarily a 
small mammal feeder, and as such should be encouraged 
as a beneficial, species. 

The limited data offered in this investigation 
would suggest that predation by man is the critical 
factor endangering the population of this species in 
the province, illthough vulnerable to other forms of 
predation and disease, the birds do not appear to be 
seriously threatened by these factors. 

It is suggested that only complete protection 
for all birds of prey, including the common and the 
rare, will ensure a population of the Great Gray Owl 


in Alberta

OBSERVATIONS ON O THER SPECIES OF O WLS IN ALBERTA 
The .oarred Owl ( Strlx yaria . ) 

This species has always been considered as an 
accidental in Alberta, In the course of this investi¬ 
gation enough records of the Barred Owl have emerged to 
suggest that it is a resident species, ^ilk*s (personal 
correspondence) collected records show only four 
previous occurrences in Alberta, They include a bird 
collected from Kvass Creek, near Smoky River about 120 
miles north of Jasper, on August 9bh, 194-5 by the 
Twomey-Mellon party, Preble (194-1) beard one near Pt. 
McMurray, May 1934-5 bhe basis for Bent f s Ft, McMurray 
record in his volume on the owls of America, There is 
a specimen in Cornell University taken at Calgary 
February 12th, 1912, Barney Hamm of Sexsmiti; in th© 
Peace River country reports that a neighbor shot a 
Barred Owl in the fall of 1952, Hamm saw the bird and 
is familiar with the species. 

The following records must now be added to the 
Alberta list (Fig, 4-8*) 

1, May 11th, 1953- A single feather from the breast 
of a Barred Owl was found in an area of dense 
muskeg approximately fifteen miles north-west of 
Corbett Creek,

5« April 11th, 1954-* While cruising heavy t.imber country 
in the search for Great Gray Owls, about 39 miles 
west of the village of Platbush, a Barred Owl was 
observed in heavy black spruce timber along the 
Akuinui Greek* Mr* E.T. Jones, E&nonton was able 
to obtain several feet of colored movie film of the 
bird. Dr.O. Hohn and Mr* William McKay of Edmonton, 
also observed the bird. 

6 . April 28th, 19 54 -* The bodies of two dead Ba.rred Owls 
were seen hanging from the back porch of Mr. Guy 
Miller*s cabin in the Obed Lake area. They had bem 
partly skinned in an amateur attempt at taxidermy. 

Both skins were secured. One bird was determined to 
be a female and the mount is now in the collection 
of W.R, Salt of Edmonton (Pig. 4-6), Sex determination 
of the other bird was impossible but a presentable 
mount is now in the collection of M. Houle of Edmonton 
(Pig. 4-6)« Both were taken in weasel sets north of 
Obed. Lake, 

7® May l^th, 1954-* A dead Barred Owl was found in the 
Saunders area west of Rocky Mountain House (Pig. 4-5 ), 
not less than forty-five feet from the base of a 
large black poplar containing a nest of Great Gr§> r 
Owls, The bird was too badly decomposed to enable 
a sex determination or cause of death.

8. February 1955* Mr, Helge Carlson, a trapper at 
Goose Lake, west of Ft, Assiniboine reported catching 
alive, in a weasel set, an owl with dark eyes and 
without horns or ear tufts. The owl was taken to 
Carlson*s cabin on the lake and left over-night, in 

a state of exhaustion, in an open roofed fox pen. The 
bird had disappeared by morning but feather traces 
were unmistakably those of a Barred Owl, 

9. April, 1955* I received from Mr, Guy Miller at 
Obed Lake another skin of a recently trapped Barred 
Owl, The raw skin was sent to Mr, Earl Godfrey of 
the National Museum, Ottawa, in fulfi lment of a 
request for such material in order that the subspecific 
status of these birds might be determined, Mr, Godfrey 
subsequently wrote to inform that the owl was a 
Northern Barred Owl ( Strlx varia varla Barton). The 
skin showed no difference from the northeastern 
subspecies, and one skin from British Columbia proved 
to be the same (Godfrey, personal correspondence). 

The stomach yielded remains of a Snox^shoe Hare.

Nest Boxes 

In an attempt to produce the first nest of this 
species for Alberta, a total of twenty-two nest boxes 
(Pig, !l7 ), were set up in the various areas where the 
birds had been recorded. Barred Owls have been 
successfully induced to nest in such boxes in eastern 
Canada and the United States (Bent, 1938 ). 

The first check revealed no nesting Barred Owls but 
four had been inhabited by Yellow-shafted Flickers, two 
by Mountain Bluebirds, three by Red squirrels, one by a 
Plying squirrel, and four had. been torn down by inquisitive

black bears. Five had succumbed to the elements 
and three remained untenanted and undisturbed. 

Conclusion 

Reports continue to be received from observant 
woodsmen i^ho describe an owl answering to the description 
of this species, from many areas throughout northern 
Alberta. Many have accurately described its voice, 
and there is no reason to doubt, especially on the 
evidence already outlined, that the species has a 
general distribution throughout northern Alberta. 

With the advent of more, competent field observers, 
there is reason to believe a nest will be discovered 
for the first time in Alberta. Its preference for 
heavy timber in remote.areas has undoubtedly been 
the major reason for the fact that the bird has 
hitherto almost totally escaped observation and may 
yet prove to be a relatively common bird in the 
province.

The Snowy Owl ( Nyctea nyctea ) 

This species is a winter visitor to Alberta, arriving 
as early as September and remaining as late as May, 

The chief concern with Snowy Owls was banding. Very 
few of these birds have ever been banded during their 
winter movements and consequently little is known of 
their routes to and from the Arctic breeding grounds. 

In the interest of banding as many birds as possible, 
none were collected for stomach analyses although a 
thorough study of the bird*s food habits in the province 
is badly needed to ascertain its economic status and 
supposed game depredations. Food analyses for this species 
from castings or pellets are difficult for the reason that 
fresh or drifting snow makes recovery of sufficient pellets 
uncertain. Furthermore, the majority of birds are 
Incessantly moving about. 

Prior to release after banding, the birds were 
weighed (Table VI) and the color of the plumage noted. 

This was an attempt on the basis of weight to corroborate 
a sex identification long since determined by field 
collectors from sexed skins; that the light plumaged 
birds were males, and the dark birds females (Gladden,193^)* 
As with most raptors the female is always considerably 
larger than the male. 

Method of Trapping 

A special trap (Fig. 49) was designed, which facili¬ 
tated capture of the birds wl thout injury. An owl was 

approached, normally within four hundred yards and while

an assistant set up the trap which was baited with a 
dead pigeon, a live pigeon was allowed to flutter 
while attached to a thirty foot cord. When satisfied 
that the owl had seen the fluttering bird a hasty 
withdrawal was made with the live pigeon. The owl, if 
hungry, would fly immediately to the spot and pounce 
upon the dead pigeon, thus releasing the spring action 
of the trap and instantly throwing both meshed sides 
over.

Summary 


1# Twenty-three birds weighed four pounds or over 
and averaged four pounds eleven and one half 
ounces. These were all of dark plumage and 
considerably darker than the (Fig. £0) twelve 
remaining birds which weighed under four pounds 
each. It may thus be assumed on the basis of 
xtfeight that the birds were females, 

2, Twelve birds weighed under four pounds and 
averaged three pounds ten ounces. These were 
all of lighter plumage and in three cases (Fig. 

51) almost totally white. The weight difference 
would suggest that these x^ere the male birds. 

3. The average weight difference between males and 
females is 15>.8 ounces, .with the female the 
heavier bird, 

Lj.. Additional measurements of Snowy Owls were 

unobtainable due to all work being done in the 
field. The severity of the weather and the 
combativeness of the species combined to make the 
task of taking accurate measurements impossible. 

Four Year Cycle of Snowy 0x4 Mo vernal ts

movements it is seen that in many instances peak numbers 
have followed, intervals of four to five years or

multiples of that length of time. Gross (1927-31“47) 
states that this cyclic periodicity is correlated with 
the established periodic abundance of Arctic Fox (Elton, 
1942) and lemmings in the north. Gross recorded peak 
numbers for Snowy Owls during migration in 1945 and 
allowing an average of four years for the build-up of 
another peak this should have occurred in 1949 and 
again in 1953® This was confirmed from personal 
observation in northern Alberta for those years. Snowy 
Owls were exceptionally numerous throughout the winter 
of 1949-50 and again in the winter of 1953 - 54 * when as 
many as twenty-eight were observed in one day in the 
Morinville area, 

A congregation of numbers for a return movement 
has been observed in Alberta, From the middle of March 
until their departure for the north, these owls gather 
in certain areas in such numbers as to become up to 
three times as numerous there as in previous months. 

The Morinville area north of Edmonton is particularly 
notable in this respect. An almost daily check of this 
area during March and April, since 194^* offers evidence 
that a build-up for a return movement takes place during 
that period. Gross (1947) suggests the build-up for 
the return movement as a possibility, and the above 
observations seem to establish this as a fact.

Banding Recoveries 

On January 10, 1955> a female owl wearing band 
No. 509-02669 was captured in the Morinville area, at 
a weight of 4 lbs. 10 ozs.. A check of records revealed 
the bird had been banded exactly one mile from the spot, 
on March [}_, 19 and the weight was identical. 

The Greet Horned Ow l ( Bubo virgin!anus ) 

Introduction 

This bird is still very common in the province, 
although its numbers vary noticeably from year to year. 
Detailed studies have been made on this species in many 
parts of its North American range (Bent, 1938 ; Errington,et al, 
1946 ) but no extensive investigations have as yet been 
made in Alberta. Again a much broader study of food 
habits is necessary before 'the controversy over its 
economic status can be cleared up. 

The observations of this p ecies during the present 
study (1952-55) Provided the following information. 

Eight nests found in 1952 in the FI at bush district, 
all contained the remains of Snowshoe Hares. Thirteen 
nests discovered in 1953 similarly provided exclusively 
Snowshoe Hare remains. These nests were all in the 
northern part of the province in heavy timber. Six nests 
found in 1954 contained a variety of contents. Two were 
located west of Edmonton and had remains of Pheasants 
and Ruffed G-rouse. White-footed Deer Mice and Short¬ 
tailed Meadow Voles were collected from all six. A 
Pocket Gopher occurred in two others.

108 . 


This was a "minimum" year for Snowshoe Hares and very 
few remains were found in any of the nests• 

Five nests located in 1955 were all in the Edmonton 
district, and as is common for this species in low Snowshoe 
Hare years, the owls were feeding on a variety of quarry, A 
list of food remains found in or near these nests on a 
single trip in which all were visited is as follows: 

3 Mallard Ducks ( Anas platyrhynchos ) 

3 Coots ( Fulic a airiericana ) 

2 Pheasants ( Phasianus colchicus ) 

1 domestic chicken 

Several Short-tailed Meadow Voles ( Microtus 

p ennsylvanicus ) 

2 Pocket gophers ( Thomomys talpoides ) 

2 Short-tailed weasel ( Mustela erminea ) 

In contrast, pellets taken from a single nest in the 
Flatbush area In 1953 contained parts of the following: 

4 Adult Snowshoe. Hares ( Leous americanus ) 

14 immature Snowshoe Hares 

1 Red Squirrel ( T ami a s c luru s lands onic us ) 

2 Short-tailed Meadow Voles ( Microtus pennsylvanicus ) 

1 White-footed Deer Mouse ( Peromyscus manlculatus )

Feb. 1955 Whitecourt Male Red Squirrel 
















110 


Conclusion 

The diet of the Great Horned owl is largely determined 
by availability depending on its range, the phase of the 
rabbit cycle, and the abundance of "buffers”• Of the ten 
stomachs examined, six contained mammal remains, two had 
bird remains and two contained unidentifiable remains. 

This list is far too limited to permit any definite con¬ 
clusions as to actual food preferences. 

Unlike so many of the other owls, this bird is 
comparatively wary and appears to be maintaining a sub¬ 
stantial population in Alberta. 




Ill 


The Hawk Owl ( Surnla ulula) 

This species is now extremely rare in Alberta. Thirty 
years ago the bird was relatively common in all the muskeg 
areas of Alberta (Henderson, 1919)* Its decline since that 
lime has baffled ornithologists (Beebe, personal correspon¬ 
dence). Some lay the blame on failing mouse and vole 
numbers, while others attribute it to persecution by man. 
The birds have the same trusting nature of the Great Gray 
Owls, and doubtless many are wantonly shot. However, the 
Hawk Owl lacks the conspicuous size of the Great Gray Owl, 
making it less liable to predation by man. It would seen 
that some other explanation for the scarcity of this 
species seems probable. 

In 195>1 Hawk Owls x^ere again noted in limited numbers 
in many of the muskeg regions north and west of Edmonton. 

By 1954 they had virtually disappeared and at the present 
time are once more scarce throughout Alberta. 

The following are records for this species made in 
the course of this study: 

1. April 2l}.th, 1952. A nest containing six eggs was 
discovered west of F3a tbush. E.T. Jones of Edmonton 
procured considerable color film footage of the birds 
at the nest and reported that they preyed exclusively 
on small mammals. 

2. July 20 th, 1952. Two Hawk Ox-7 Is xjere observed in a 
large muskeg near Chisholm, Alberta.

3* December, 1953* A single male bird was collected in 
the Rocky Mountain House district by Ranger J. 

Williams and forwarded to the University of Alberta 
Zoology Department. 

h r , February, 1954* A pair were brought to the local 
taxidermy shop. the birds were diot in muskeg 
southwest of Grande Prairie and were in breeding con¬ 
dition. 

5* March, A single bird was observed twenty miles 

north of Ft. Assiniboine on the edge of a large muskeg. 

6. January, 195b* A specimen was sent from Whitecourt, 
having been shot on the outskirts of the village, ‘^he

The extreme scarcity of this species in Alberta and 

its habit of preying on small mammals make it a. desirable 

species and worth protecting.

Richardson 1 s Owl ( Cryptoglaux funarea r ichardsom ) 
Introduction 

This species has never been abundant in Alb erta. 
Henderson (1931) found only four nests, Randall (1929) 
one, and Rowan (1929) another* In the course of this 
study five occurrences of this bird were noted as 
foilows: 

1* January 1953* A male bird was killed in a pole 
trap near Barrhead* 

2* March 1954* A female was sent from Anzac, Alberta 
having been shot by an Indian trapper* 

3* March I95>ll-* A single specimen was observed in 

heavy spruce woods north of Spruce Grove, Alberta* 

It held a partly eaten Redpoll in Its claws. 

4* April 195b* Another dead female specimen was sent 
from Anzac. 

5* July 1st, 1955* An immature bird was captured near 
the Tamarack Creek in the Swan Hills. The bird 
appeared almost blind in the bright sunlight and 
easily allowed, itself go be snared with a nylon 
noose on the end of a fishing pole. The bird was 
taken unharmed and thrust into a knapsack but 
unfortunately escaped. Pellets collected from 
this specimen contained parts of the follox^ing: 

1 Pigmy Shrew ( Microsorex hoyi ) 

1 Saddle-back Shrew ( Sorex arcileus ) 

2 Red-backed Mouse ( C1ethr1onom yg g a pp erl ) 




















m 


It is interesting to note that the Pigmy Shrew 
is rarely collected, particularly in Alberta. 

Conclusion 

Although the rarity of this species makes its economic 
influence insignificant, it should be regarded as a bene¬ 
ficial type. Its inability to see well enough to capture 
food in daylight, and its small size discount it as a 
menace to game birds. 

Ihe Saw - t ~het Gw1 ( Cryptoglaux acadia ) 

No new information on this species can be contributed 
in this study to the extensive existing knowledge, the 
bird cannot be considered rare In Alberta but its 
nocturnal habits and small size make it a difficult species 
to encounter, much less to study. During the course of this 
study on owls generally, it was noticed that Saw-whets have 
been on the increase since 195>2. 

The following records x^ere obtained from 1952 to 

1955 : 

1. February 1, 1953* A live male was sent from Westloek 
where it had been captured in a barn. It subsequently 
died in captivity. 

2. March, 1954* A live bird was sent from Stony Plain, 
having been picked up on a road near the town. This 
specimen, like most Saw-whets captured alive, ate well 
but was dead within a week. Rowan says this is 








115 


characteristic of Saw-whets that have allowed an easy 
capture. Post-mortem analysis by Dr. Bigland revealed 
nothing conclusive. 

3. July 1, 1955. A nest containing four eggs was located 
near Beaumont, Alberta. This is an extremely late 
nesting date for the species. No detailed study of the 
nest was undertaken. Pour young from the nest are 
shown in Fig. 52.

Conclusion 

This species apparently fluctuates in numbers 

from year to year. It is not known to be migratory. 

The comparative rarity and diminutive size make it 
a negligible threat to game. Studies elsewhere (Bent, 
1938 ) indicate that it is predominantly a small 
mammal feeder and this is apparently also the case 
in Alberta. The species should be considered beneficial. 

The Screech Owl ( Otus asio ) 

Introduction 

Only two previous records for the species 
existed in Alberta prior to this study. These were 
sight records by A.D. Henderson, the veteran oologist 
of Belvedere, Alberta (I 9 I 4 .I, 1955)* 

The following new records are herewith submitted: 

1. October 21, 1954* A live specimen was captured 
(Pig. 53) in the Swan Hill country north of Ft. 
Assiniboine, The skin was forwarded to the 
National Museum for subspecific identification. 

.Mr. Godfrey was unable to name the specimen but 

felt that an undescribed race might be involved. 

2. August, 1955* On. Win. Rowan received another 
specimen found dead on the highway near Lesser 
Slave Lake. The bird was a juvenile male, red phase.

ConelusIon 

With only four authentic records to date, for 
the species in Aluerta, it would be premature to 
assume that the Screech Owl has established itself 
in the province. Further investigation with additional 
records is required before an accurate assessment can 
be made•

SUMMARY ; 

1. The Great Gray OxYL ivras first described by J.R. Forster 
from an immature bird collected near Severn River, 
Ontario, in 1772. 

2. A recognized Old World subspecies, the Lapp Owl, differs 
only slightly from the Great Gray in being lighter in 
color and with more noticeable longitudinal markings 

on the breast, 

3* A four year study of the Great Gray Owl in Alberta, 
from. 1952 - 55 * produced fourteen dead specimens, 
four live birds shipped to the author, and two nests 
each containing two young which provided the basis for 
the study, 

4. When compared with the Great Homed Owl it was seen that 
the Great Gray possessed considerably smaller and weaker 
feet, a larger head,but a very similar intestinal tract. 

5* The sternur^ shoulder girdle and correlated muscles of 
the Great Gray Owl are much smaller than corresponding 
structures in the Great Horned Owl. 

6 . The extreme softness of the Great Gray Owl*s breast 
plumage and upper back feathers is due to the length of 
these feathers and the fewer b arbs and barbules as com¬ 
pared with those of the Great Horned Owl, 

7. The feather tracts are described. The inferior branch 

of the ventral tract differs from the typical arrangement 
for disc-faced owls as described by Hitzsch & Burmeister 
(I 8 I 4 .O).

8 . The molt observed on a captive bird commenced in late 
June and the feathers appear to drop in a definite 
sequence. The Great Gray Owl lacks the fifth secondary 
and is said to show diastataxy or acquintocubitalism. 

9. Great Gray Owls have been recorded nesting from Alaska 
to the Yosemite Valley of California and east to 
Northern Quebec and Ontario. 

10. Winter movements have been recorded for the species but 
any regular movements ceased to be noted from 1900 
onwards. 

11. Three young Great Gray Owls were banded in 1954* Only 
two previous banding records for this species are 
recorded in the files of the U.S. Pish and Wildlife 
Services. 

12. There is no information to indicate that Great Gray Owls 
build their own nests. They prefer to use a structure 
previously built by some other species of raptor. 

13. Great Gray nesting sites are in heavy poplar woods and 
invariably near an extensive muskeg. 

1 L}_. The birds become quite vociferous during the nesting 
season and the male emits a droning noise when rubbing 
his bill with that of the female during their courtship. 

l^. An average clutch numbers three and the eggs are laid in 
late March or April. 

16 . The birds will assume the defensive attitude and 
threateningly hunch their backs and call faintly 
but rapidly when reacting to intruders. They have not 
been known to attack at the nest. 








121 . 


17. Both adults and young have distinctive calls which 
are only uttered under certain conditions. 

18. The male appears not to share any of the incubation 
duties but is occupied in obtaining food for the 
incubating female and later for the young. 

19. At twenty-one days the young stand up in the nest and 
are becoming active. At forty days they have left the 
nest. 

20. In graphing the measurements of young Great Gray Owls, 

the length of the cere remains almost constant for the first 
four weeks. An other measurements show a gradual, but 
variable increase. 

21. This species preys principally on small mammals, particu¬ 
larly mice and voles. 

22. Man is the chief enemy of the Great Gray Owl. Great 
Horned Owls will attack and kill the lighter Great Gray 
Owls. 

23. The birds possess a number of parasites including feather 
lice, round worms, leukocytezoons and malarial protozoa. 
Coccidiosis and aspergillosis were also discovered in 
this species. 

2I4.. Owing to its scarcity, food habits and general inoffensive¬ 
ness, the Great Gray Owl merits full protection. 

Other Owls 

25. Snowy Owls are common winter visitors in Alberta with 
years of varying numbers. The males are approximately 
a pound lighter than the females and much whiter in color. 
















122 


26, Alberta appears to have an established Barred Owl 
population. Eleven new records for the species, 
uncovered in this study are evidence of this. 

27* The Great Horned Owl’s economic status in this province 
is still open to debate. Its food habits are apparently 
determined by its range, the availability of quarry, 
particularly the cyclic phase shoe s. 

28. Haw’.: Owls, Richardson's Owls and Saw-whet Owls offered 
only very limited opportunities for observation and 
study in the course of this investigation. It was 
evident that they are relatively rare birds with the 
Hawk Owl particularly so. 

29, Two new records for the Screech Owl were also added to 
the Alberta list. Both are the first specimens procured 


in the Province
