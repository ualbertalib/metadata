CHAPTER I 


PURPOSE OF THE IFtfESTIGATIQH 

! 

In beginning this investigation it was desired to study 
some phase of the work in science in the high schools of this 
province * Ho previous work could be found in this field and 
so to this study fell the duty of considering at least to some 
extent, the possibilities and methods of such investigation. 

For information and suggestions concerning aspects of the sub¬ 
ject which had practical interest, several science teachers in 
the Edmonton high schools were consulted. In a meeting with 
these teachers and Dr, Lazerte, five main phases of science 
training were discussed. These were: 

1. A study of the growth of scientific language. 

2, A study of the ability of pupils to use their mathematical 

knowledge in their work in science• 

3, A study of pupils* abilities to observe similarities in 
situations and to apply scientific knowledge. 

4. A study of the development of a "scientific attitude”. 

5* A study of the ability of pupils to observe and to recog¬ 

nise essential factors in an experiment, to record results, and 
to arrive at conclusions. 

Each of these lines of study seemed to be directed to¬ 
ward some fundamental aspect of science teaching and it seemed 
possible that each might be adaptable to some method of measure¬ 
ment. It was decided in this work to investigate in some 
manner as many as possible of these. Thus it was thought

that this work might he of greatest value in showing possi¬ 
bilities and in indicating to some extent methods for further 
study in these fields. 

The fifth of the above mentioned lines of investigation 
was connected with laboratory work in science. It seemed a 
distinctly different type of study and would require quite 
different methods of investigation. So it was decided to 
leave this study entirely as a suggestion for future work 
and for the present to give some consideration to each of 
the other four.

CHAPTER II 


METHOD OP INVESTIGATION 

Construction of Tests 

Pour different tests, each related to one phase of 
this study, were compiled* 

Test 1* « This test was designed to measure scientific voca¬ 
bulary, and is of the multiple choice word association type. 

The words chosen were from various fields of scientific study 
in the high school - physical, chemical and biological sciences. 
Most of the words are met by the student in public school or in 
early years of high school work* There were some though that 
would not be met by the pupils except in their work in Grade 
XII science courses or in reading and conversations outside 
the school* 

Test 2.- This test consists of a collection of little problems 
involving some mathematical relationship. In no case is the 
difficulty of the mathematics felt to be beyond a Grade IX 
algebra student 1 s ability. Most of the questions involve a 
statement of "more than", or "less than", or "equal to" between 
two quantities which exist in some relationship studied in 
their regular science courses* 

Test 5*- This test is mostly a collection of questions re¬ 
quiring only a knowledge of the actual material presented in 
the first half of the General Science I text. Scattered 
through the test there are also certain questions which would 
require some application of principles or facts to a situation 
not discussed in the text. While this test was not considered 
to measure adequately an "ability to observe similarities in

situations and to apply scientific knowledge”* still there was 
none available which seemed any better and it was thought that 
this might give some interesting results® 

Test The greatest difficulty was found in trying to get a 
test which would measure the quality or ability called ”a 
scientific attitude”* The only report of such a work that 
was found in the literature was on© by E. B. Moore on a 
”Study of Scientific Attitudes”® This was briefly summarized 
in ”-School Review”, Vol. 38, pp. 379-86, but a more complete 
account containing a copy of the test which has been published, 
could not be obtained® It was decided that a test composed of 
superstitions and common beliefs, mile indicative of credulity 
rather than a scientific attitude might still prove of consider¬ 
able interest® And so Test 4 was compiled® It consists of 
45 statements of common beliefs and superstitions with several 
other statements concerning scientific knowledge or an opinion, 
which/are to be marked "true” or "false”. 

These tests when thus compiled were given to a group of 
students at Eastwood High School. It was found that the tests 
were too long to be given in a 30 minute class period. To be 
sure that slower pupils would have time to complete the test 
it was necessary to reduce the length of each test to about 
one-half the number of items. Rather than discard one-half 
of the items it was decided to split each into two parts which 
have teen called part (a) and part (b). Thus (a) and (b) parts 
of any test should be practically the same, any differences 
being purely accidental in the division of the items.

Giving the Tests 

To get a sufficient number of cases to be representative 
an attempt was made to have 100 pupils in each of the high 
school grades answer each test* Also for purposes of comparison 
it was considered necessary to have 100 pupils in Grade VIII 
answer each test* Accordingly, 500 copies of each test were 
mimeographed* There being now really eight tests, two parts 
to each of the four original tests, in all,d.000 copies were 
made* These were distributed among 38 high school&s and 19 
public schools* The schools were for the most part those of 
small towns in the province* A few were given in city (both 
Calgary and Edmonton) schools, and a few in rural schools. 

The tests were mailed on December 11th and 12th and the 
teachers they were sent to were asked to give them as soon as 
possible - before tbs excitement of the last few days of the 
term, or if this were not possible, then to give the tests 
before January 10th when school reopened* Giving the tests 
at this time has certain disadvantages as the pupils have not 
half completed the work of the grade they are in* The results 
thus obtained might more closely resemble those which would have 
been obtained at the end of the previous year rather than those 
at the end of this year’s work* This was one of the necessary 
limitations to the investigation and should be kept in mind* 
Regarding the actual administering of the tests the 
following instructions were given to the teacher: "The tests 
are short and should be completed withuj/kalf an hour, although 
there is no time limit to the teste. We have kept the tests 
short in order that all pupils may have time to complete, or

attempt, all items. Will you supervise the work of the pupils, 
while they are filling in the blanks at the top of the test? 

We are particularly anxious to have a correct record of the 
science courses now being taken, already passed, or now being 
repeated* Before distributing the tests, explain that this test 
is given in connection with an investigation in which we are 
trying to find exact and true facts* Our findings will not 
be true unless each pupil gives his best effort and records 
only the results of his own thinking." 

The form of the blank on the top of each test and filled 
out by each pupil was:

The directions to the pupil for answering each test were 
also given on the top of each test. These directions necessarily

Marking and Scoring the Tests. 

The first problem when the papers were returned was 
to group these in different classes which were to be compared. 
Ideally one would group the papers on each test according to 
the combination of subjects the pupils had taken# In this 
way one could get some measure of what was given by each course* 
Sufficient data was availabe as each pupil had stated which 
science courses he was now taking, which he had taken, and which 
he was now repeating* But there were not sufficient cases to 
make such groups of any value. So the answers to each test 
were grouped according to the grade of the pupil answering the 
test. While the pupils had stated what grade they were in, this 
could not be always taken as the criterion. Instead, the 
following classification was set up depending on the subjects 
the pupil was taking, for the first time or repeating, or had 
already passed. 

Grade VIII - includes all those pupils who have taken no high 
school science subjects* 

Grade IX - includes those pupils who are taking General Science 
I (either repeating or taking for the first time) 
but who have not yet taken any other high school 
science subjects. 

Grade X - includes those pupils who have taken or are taking 
(either repeating or for the first time) one or 
both of Physics I and Agriculture I, but who have 
mot yet taken any other high school science subject 
in addition to General Science I* 

Grade XI - includes those pupils who have taken or are taking 
(either repeating or for the first time) one or

in addition to General Science I, Physics I, 
Agriculture I* 

Grade XII - includes those pupils who have taken or who are 
taking (either repeating or for the first time) 
one or more of Chemistry 2, Physics 2, Biology I. 

The actual marking of the papers varied somewhat with 
the different tests* Tests I and III which were both of the 
multiple choice type were marked in the same manner* First 
the number of times each of the five possible choices was given 
as an answer to each question by each grade was recorded* Also 
the number of times each question was not answered was recorded* 
Secondly the number of correct answers on each paper was record¬ 
ed. In Test II most of the questions were answered by choosing 
one of three alternatives as "greater than", "equal to" or "less 
than" as the one required to make the statement true* The number 
of times each of these choices was given as the answer by each 
grade was recorded as in Test I and III* Some of the questions 
required a numerical answer* The most common of these were con¬ 
sidered and the number of times each occured was recorded. When 
the answer required was simply "yes" or "no" a record was made 
of the number of times each was given. Also the number of 
omissions of each question was recorded* And as before the 
number of correct answers on each paper was scored* In Test IV, 
in addition to grouping the papers by grades, separate groups 
were made of boys and girls in each grade. The test consisted of 
statements which were marked "true" or "false", or were not

CHAPTER III 


TEST I. 

A Note on the Test 

The two parts or forms of Test I are given below. The 
directions to the pupil in answering these tests were the same 
on both parts, namely: w After each word on the left there are 
five choices for the most closely associated word. Write the 
number of this word in the parentheses at the end of each line. 
For example, 

thermometer (l) pressure (2) volume (3) length 

( 4 ) temperature ( 5 ) energy.. (4) 

The number of items on Test I (a) is 50 and on Test I (b) 
is 59, but this is of no special significance, In the copies 
of the tests given below, the parentheses at the end of each 
line are not left blank as they were in the ordinary forms of 
the test, but here the number of that word which was required 
to be associated v^ith the word on the left has been inserted. 
Also on the extreme left of each item the lowest grade which 
gave 50^ correct answeres to the question is indicated by 
Roman Numerals, or by a blank where no grade gave 50^ correct 
answers. 

Attention is here drawn to two errors in Test I (a). 

In question 48 the word "epidermic” should have been "epidemic", 
and in question 49 "refract" should have been "reflect". Owing 
to these mistakes in each of these questions there were two 
choices for a correct ansv^er. However the number of pupils 
chosing these words in preference to "skin" in question 48 and

11 spectacles” in question 49 were comparatively small and so 
it vias not felt necessary to discard these questions entirely. 

In this test no attempt was made to include an equal 
proportion of words which should he familiar to each grade and 
not to the one below it® Nor was any attempt made to include 
only words of scientific nature which are of common usage and 
so to give a comparison between grades and pupils on this basis® 
The words which were chosen were ones which came to mind that 
seemed of significance, were not too uncommon, covered the 
range from ones Grade VXXI should be familiar with to some which 
it seemed doubtful that many Grade XIX pupils would have met, 
and which came from several different fields of scientific study® 
So the test may be said to measure a growth in scientific 
language in so far as this is measured by these tests.

Distribution of Scores in Different Grades. 

The tables and graphs below show the frequency dis¬ 
tribution of the scores on Test 1 (a) and on Test 1 (b) in 
each grade. The number of cases, U, and the arithmetic mean, 

M, for each group are alee given. The extent of the scientific 
vocabulary in each grade, the range or variation among pupils 
in a grade, and the growth or development from one grade to 
the next in this respect is clearly indicated by these graphs. 
It must, however, be remembered that these things are shown 
only in so far as these tests measure a "scientific voca¬ 
bulary” , and to such extent as our sampling has been truly 
repre sentative.

Percentage Frequency of Answers to Questions. 

The following tables give the percentage frequency 
with which each answer was given to each question in the 
different grades. The number of pupils, N, in each grade 
which answered the test is indicated in each case. In these 
tables column 1 gives the number of the question on the test 
columns 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 give the percentage frequency with 
which word number 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 respectively were chosen 
as the one most closely associated; column 7 gives the per¬ 
centage frequency of omissions to each question.

Consideration of Words "Learned" in Each Grade 

Under this heading the items are grotiped for further 
consideration in an attempt to see what words it may he said 
are learned in each grade. The basis for grouping or criter¬ 
ion of "learning” is arbitrarily set by including together 
all those items which were answered correctly by 50^ of the 
pupils in a grade and by less than 50^ in the lower grades. 

Thus items or words which are listed as "Grade VIII Questions" 
are those which were answered correctly by 50 % of the Grade VIII 
pupils, and "Grade IX Questions" are those which were answered 
correctly by 50 % of Grade IX pupils but by less than 50 % of 
Grade VIII pupils. Similarly by arbitrary definition other 
items are classed as "Grade X Questions", "Grade XI Questions", 
"Grade XII Questions", and "Questions not learned". 

The following tables give such grouping of the items on 
Test I. Items from both Test I (a) and Test I (b) are includ¬ 
ed together under these grade groupings. In these tables, (a) 
and (b) on the left of each item refer to part (a) and part (b) 

etc •.» 

of the test, and the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,/)give the number of 
the item in that test. The percentage of correct answers 
given by each grade is given just after each item, the Roman 
numerals referring to the grade and the Arabic numerals to 
the percentage of correct answers in that grade. The word 
taken to be correctly associated is again indicated by the 
number in the parentheses after each item.

VIII 51.2%, IX 51.2%, X 74.2%, XI 64.7%, XII 96.0% 

Of these words not more than half are ones that come 
into Grade VII or Grade VIII arithmetic, agriculture or hygiene. 
Such words would be "equal# 1 , "cubic", "ounce", "pupil", "pistil", 
"cerebrum", "serum", "disinfectant", and perhaps "malaria" and 
"anaesthetic". These we might expect a G r ade VIII class to know, 
and it seems that most of these are known by nearly as large a 
percentage of Grade VIII pupils as of any of the high school 
grade s* 

The remaining group of words, namely, "density", "hydrau¬ 
lic", "reflection","lens", "pressure", "litmus", "condenser", 
and "analyze" with possiblp "anaesthetic" and "malaria" includ¬ 
ed, seem more difficult to explain. Of these, only "lens" and 
"pressure" were known by a very large percentage of Grade VIII 
pupils. These are probabl3r known by these pupils because they 
are of very common usage. The others were known by a smaller 
part of the Gr&de VII1 pupils and axe in general words which 
they would not be so likely to hear in their homes and conver¬ 
sations. It seems quite evident that these must be words they 
have met in reading, in talk \¥ith parents or with older pupils

in other grades, but there seems no reason for more Grade VIII 
pupils than Grade IX pupils to know such words as •’litmus”, 
•’condenser” and ’’analyze”.

VIII 49.0%, IX 62.2%, X 85.0%, XI 91.2%, XII 98.0% 


Of these items only one might be selected as a fact 
which has not been definitely presented to the pupils in their 
regular school work by this time. This is the last item in the 
list above, namely, the association of “spark plug” with "ignition” 
and this may readily be understood as becoming a familiar assoc¬ 
iation for children by this time. 

Of the remainder about one-half are words that a G r ade 
VIII class would be expected to meet in their agriculture and 
hygiene. Words as "legume", "stomata", "germination", "biennial", 
"epidermis", "chlorophyll", "larvae", "photosynthesis" and 
"capillary action" may be ones which come in the latter half 
of the Grade VIII work and so were not known by 50% of the 
Grade VIII pupils. Still most of these recur in the work of 











- 37 - 


Grade IX pupils in General Science and it may have been this 
second meeting in perhaps a new light that impressed their 
meaning on the pupils® 

The remaining words* "metric”, "buoyancy”, "lever”, 
"vernier”, "siphon”, "barometer", "Fahrenheit”, "gram", and 
the relation of "1 inch and 2®54 cm.", and "energy and Heat", 
are in all probability ones that very few pupils would have 
met until they came up in General Science I. There seem 
definitely items which were learned by Grade IX pupils as 
a result of this course.

Three words here seem to suggest general reading or con¬ 
tacts rather than any specific course studied by the pupils, 
namely, "hibernation”, "protoplasm" and "immunity". It is 
quite possible that these words were met with in previous 
school work, perhaps as early as Grade VIII, but they were not 
stressed or brought to particular attention. 

The words "eradication", "carbohydrate", and "pollination" 
seem to be ones that would appear in Grade VIII agriculture and 
hygiene but were not understood until after General Science I 
or until they were met in Agriculture I. A considerable number 
of pupils associated "carbohydrate" with "butter" and with 
"carbon dioxide", and in all the grades there were many who 
associated "pollination" with "germination". This confusion 
was not straightened out even in Grade X. 

The words "hygrometer", "solution", "fulcrum" and "micro¬ 
meter" were probably met first in General Science I. Of these 
the first two might not yet have come up in this course and so 
only a few of the Grade IX pupils happened to know them. But 
73.4$ of Grade IX pupils associated "lever" with "nutcrackers" 
which would indicate that this topic had been learned by Grade IX

pupils, and so one would expect "fulcrum" and ”lever” to be 
associated. But this associationw as given by only 32.6$ of 
the Grade IX pupils and does not seem to be learned till the 
pupils are in Grade X. The word "micrometer” is met by the 
pupils at the very beginning of their work in general science 
but still only 25.6$ of Grade IX pupils associated it with 
"length”. 

Only the two words "spectroscope” and "calorie" seem 
to be ones that are met and learned in Grade X. These would 
come in the Physics I course. This seems to be further indi¬ 
cated by the great increase in percentage of correct responses 
in Grade X over Grade VIII and Grade IX,

With the possible exception of the words "alloy”, "synthesis” 
"coke” and "alkali”, it seems that all these words would have 
been met with by the majority of the pupils before they enter 
Grade XI. The words ”insulator", "metamorphosis", and "constell¬ 
ation” might be learned through general reading and contacts 
though all would likely be mentioned in General Science I. It 
is interesting to note that "constellation” is known in its 
connection to astronomy, but is associated with a "planet" rather 
than with a "group” of stars by a great number of pupils even in 
Grade XII. The association of "insulator" with "rubber" may 
appear here from a study of the latter part of Physics X. 

The words "hydrometer" and "spectrum" may also be ones 
which were, learned in the Physics I course but had not yet come 
into the study of Grade X pupils in this course. 

The association of "propagation" and "reproduction" should 
be made by pupils in Grade VIII as these words are met in their 
agriculture but it seems that the relation is not learned till 
after the Agriculture I course in Grade X or perhaps not till 
Agriculture 2 is studied in Grade XI. 

The words "alloy", "synthesis", "coke", "alkali" and

"filtration" are likely learned in Chemistry I. H 0 wever no 
definite study of alloys is made in Chemistry I and the 
association of "alloy" and "brass" may he one that is a result 
of more general contacts* So also the meaning of the words 
"synthesis", "coke" and "filtration" might he learned from 
general work and study of the pupils* 

The knowledge of the units of volume in the metric 
system is probably learned only through repeated presentation 
and use (Question 7, Test I (a)). The pupils are supposed to 
learn these units in each of the four high school grades, but 
in each grade there are pupils who do not know them* There is 
a fairly steady improvement in each of the high school grades. 
In Grade IX it would he expected that more than 13$ would 
associate 200 cc, and l/5 litre for this would come in the 
first part of the General Science I course* It may be that 
many more would have associated 1000 cc* and 1 litre but 
expressed in this form they did not recognize the relation.

The knowledge of most of these items may be attributed 
the completion of one course in Chemistry/a nd perhaps a/study 
of at least a part of the second* Thus we may explain Grade XII 
knowing words as "sulfate", ’'chloride”, "catalyst”, "volatile”, 
"cathode", "compound" and "base". The association of "base" 
with "hydroxyl" requires a knowledge of ionization theory which 
Chemistry I pupils are not given. Thus Grade XII associate "base" 
with "hydroxyl" as well as with "alkali" but Grade XI make only 
the second association. The association of "dirigible" with

"hydrogen" seems to require some knowledge of the properties 
of hydrogen and so while this use of hydrogen is mentioned in 
Grade IX it is not understood till the chemistry of hydrogen 
has been studied* 

The association of "refraction 11 and "distortion" would 
be expected by pupils who had completed the Physics I course 
but the relation does not seem to be understood then* The 
improvement would seem to be due to general contacts rather 
than any specific instruction* However, nearly b0% of the 
Grade XII pupils do not know this relation* 

The words "parasite" and “assimilation 15 may be learned 
after taking Agriculture 2 in Grade XI or in taking Biology I 
in Grade XII* 

The group of associations “vitamin" and "rickets", "bile” 
and “digestion”, “enzyme" and "saliva" do not seem directly con¬ 
nected with any specific instruction given the pupils* Some of 
these words may have been brought up during school work - perhaps 
some in Grade VIII hygiene - but these seem mainly to be learned 
through general reading and conversation* It will be noticed 
that there are still fairly large proportions of the pupils that 
do not realize these relations* Especially is confusion noticed 
in connection with "rickets" - it is frequently associated with 
“bacillus" and with “serum”♦

This group of items do not seem connected or related in 
any respect. These items do not belong to any branch of science 
in particular. They are not words which the pupils are expected 
to learn in any one grade. Nor are they words which the pupils 
do not meet in their study of science. Some, as "tuberculosis” 
and "cambium”, will very likely be mentioned to the pupils in 
Grade VIII. Others, "satellite”, "mass”, "litre” and "gram", 
are met with in Grade IX. And so on, others are met in Grades

X, XI and XII* They are, for the most part, words which occur 
several times in the course of high school science training* 

And further, they do not appear to he words of little import¬ 
ance that might excusably he passed over in the attempt to stress 
the points that are important* 

It is interesting to not^ certain wrong associations 
which were very frequently made, such as: satellite - star, 
prism - reflection, quartz - metal, 1 gram - 1/16 ounce, and 
others* These indicate that there are certain misconceptions 
which are quite general and which persist through all the grades*

CHAPTER IV 


TEST II. 

A Note on the Test 

Copies of the Tests II (a) and II (b) are given below. 

Each test consists of twenty-five separate items to be answered. 
The directions given for answering the tests were the same on 
each, namely; "Write in the parentheses on the right of the 
questions, the correct answer or the word which makes the 
statement correct* Por example. 

Water is (heavier than, lighter than, the same weight as) air, 

..... (heavier than )** 

In the copies of the tests given here the ansv/ers which 
were accepted as correct are given in the parentheses on the 
right of the questions. The Roman numerals on the extreme left 
opposite each item indicates the lowest grade in which bOfo of the 
pupils gave correct answers to that question. A blank opposite 
an item on the extreme left indicates that in no grade did 5Q& 
of the pupils answer it correctly. 

The material for these tests in taken from the high 
school science courses without any particular attempt at pro¬ 
portioning an equal amount from each course. The greater part 
of the test is of material taken up in General Science I and 
Physics I. Very few questions require a study of Physics 2, 

The items are based on physical phenomena or principles in these 
courses and coupled with some simple mathematical relationship or 
expression of the quantities involved. The material of these 
courses is much more adaptable to such mathematical treatment 
than material taken from agriculture or biology courses. An 
attempt was made to choose problems involving principles of 
importance - which would not be treated briefly or passed over

hurriedly in the course - and yet to make the problems as 
simple and clear as possible. 

The mathematics involved was made as elementary as 
possible. In no case should more than Algebra I be required 
and generally a knowledge of algebra was not needed. 

The proportion of correct answers to the questions on 
this test was generally low. Grade VIII pupils would not be 
expected to get many right - their "judgements” were mostly 
guesses. But it seems that many of the items should have been 
answered correctly by Grade IX pupils and nearly all by Grade XI 
pupils who have completed Physics I if the pupils had been given 
an understanding of the principles and relationships involved in 
the topics as they were studied in these courses. To pass Depart¬ 
mental Examinations in these subjects the pupils must have indieat 
ed a knowledge of the facts and principles of the course and the 
mathematics they are able to do in their algebra is far beyond 
anything required here. Yet considerable difficulty was encounter 
ed in relating the two, or in applying certain mathematical ideas 
to these phenomena and principles studied in their science courses

Consideration of Items ‘'learned” in Each Grade. 

By the same interpretation of "learning” as was used 
for grouping of words in Test I, the items of Test II are 
grouped in the following tables* The significance of such 
division related to the real learning of an Item is perhaps 
less on this test than it was on Test I* This would he because 
of the relatively fewer choices in answering most of the ques¬ 
tions on Test II and thus the larger percentage of correct 
answers that might be expected from chance guesses. However, 
this same basis may be used as satisfactorily as any other 
arbitrary standard for grouping the items* The questions 
are tabulated in the same manner as in Test I* . 

In the tabulation the part of the test, (a) or (b), is 
indicated on the left margin followed by the number of the item, 
on this test as in the tabulation of items in Test I* The 
answer accepted as correct and the percentage of correct 
answers in each grade are also given in the same manner*

Grade VIII Questions 

(a) 9(b) Two steel balls were dropped from the same height, 

one from the top of a high building and the other from 
an aeroplane travelling 100 miles per hour* Would 
the two balls land in the same place relative to 

their starting points? .......,.....(ho) 

VIII 72.2^, IX 63.5?£, X 56.5^» XI 56.5^, XII 84.2^ 

Light waves from air striking water continue to 
travel (faster, at the same speed, slower)..*.(slower) 
VIII 52 . 801 , IX 35.5$?, X 43.7$?, XI 52.256, XII 66 .% 

An electric light bulb is placed in one pan of a 
balance and is balanced by brass weights on the 
other pan. If all the air were exhausted from 
the space around the apparatus would the light 
bulb appear to weigh(less, the same or more; 

than before? .... (less) 

VIII 55.9$?, IX 68.5^, X 50.0$?, XI 52.3$?, XII 47.4$? 


(a) 15 
(t>) 8 


While over 50^ of the Grade VIII pupils answered these 
questions correctly it seems doubtful that Grade VIII pupils 
should really know anything about these problems. N 0 thing of 
this nature has come into their school work and they have pro¬ 
bably never heard of ”light waves” or”balance pans”. So it would 
seems that only by a fortunate guess should a G r ade VIII pupil 
give the right answer to these questions. Question 8 , Test II 
(b) seems to remain for Grade XII pupils a problem which cannot 
be answered, and they/ftieard often of buoyancy and could explain 
such principles when related to boats floating on water or to a 
balloon in the air. Question 15 in Test II (a) does not seem to 
be understood by the pupils till they are in Grade XII and then 
only by 2/3 of them. One would expect that a pupil completing 
Physics I should realize this relationship but this does not 
seem the case. Probably only Grade XIX pupils after taking 

as 

Physics 2 have any idea of why ”no” should be given/\the answer to 

Question %9 (b), Test II (a). In the other grades the pupils have 

to think it out for themselves without having had any definite 

instruction to depend on and the result, one feels, is a great 
many guesses.

Grade IX Questions 

(a) 10. If a ship if floated into fresh water from the 

ocean it will ride (higher, at the same level, 

lower) .....(lower) 

VIII 44.5^, IX 53.7^, X 61,9 % t XI 74.C$, XII 75.5^ 

(b) 2(a) A body moving from rest with uniform acceleration 

(a) acquires a velocity (v) in time(t) which is 
given by v * at. Does this velocity change as 

motion continues? ..(yes) 

VIII 46.2^, IX 54.6^, X 50.<$, XI 48.3^, XII 65.8^ 

The first of these questions would indicate that a 
knowledge of buoyancy and certain mathematical concepts in 
that connection were being learned by the pupils in Grade IX 
and also in Grades X and XI. 

The second question, 2 (a) Test II (b), seems to in¬ 
dicate the inability of pupils to understand a mathematical 
relationship in a symbolic expression. Perhaps it is because 
this one is too difficult? Still,Grade VII and Grade VIII 

o 

pupils are given a more complex one - A sirr in finding areas 
of circles. Is this one understood? It may be that the second 
one is better understood than the first for its application is 
to things they have seen and had their attention drawn to while 
instances of the second may not have been so encountered. Still* 
in view of the ordinary experiences of the pupils, and of their 
supposed familiarity with and understanding of this more com¬ 
plex expression, it seems that none of the grades responded as 
well as would be expected to this question.

This group of questions contains two more items, 
question I (a), Test II (a) and question 1 (a), Test II (b), 
concerned with symbolic expressions of mathematical relatione 
between physical qualities or terms. Both expressions are per¬ 
haps new to the pupils - at least they likely appear in a new 
form* On these questions there is less chance of a guess being 
right so the answers are probably a fair indication of the pupils’ 
ability to handle such problems. 

The two questions, number 3 Test II (a) and 3 Test II (b), 
dealing with pressure of water at different levels and at the 
same level in two tanks were answered correctly by a far smaller 
percentage of the higher grades than would be expected. These 
questions receive discussion in General Science I but many of 
the pupils do not seem to be able to express the facts in this 
manner. 

Questions 7 Test II (a), 9 Test II (b), and 16 Test II (b) 
are based on physical principles presented in General Science I, 
yet for the most part there seems to be little improvement in 
the answering of these questions even in the higher grades. 

Question 5 Test II (b) seems a very elementary question 
for any pupil who has studied light” in Physics I, yet there 
was a very low percentage of correct answers in all the grades.

In most of these questions it would be rash to say that 
even 50$ of Grade XI pupils understand and can express the 
relationship correctly. The proportion of correct answers 
for Grade XI pupils is barely over 50$ and some correct answers 
may rightly be assumed as nothing but guesses. The improvement 
on these items is perhaps to be attributed to completing Physics 
I and further mathematics in Algebra 2 but it seems that Algebra 
I should be sufficient for any problem on these tests.

Only two questions, 9 and 13 on Test II (a) and possibly 
a third, 2(b) on Test II (b) seem to require mention of Physics 
2 to explain their being “learned” here. Question 7 Test II 
(b) requires a knowledge of comparative specific gravities 
of alcohol and water as well as of principles of buoyancy. 

This first is probably only acquired by general contacts in 
reading or conversation. It may be mentioned in Physics I but 
it did not seem to be of any assistance to Grade X pupils.

Questions 4 Test II (a) and 4 Test II (b) seem to be 
items which might be answered by pupils who had taken very 
little or no science studies but who could think just a little. 
Especially in question 4 Test II (b) is this and only this 
individual thought and reasoning required. Yet only 26.2% of 
Grade XII pupils are capable of this. Question 4 Test II (a) 
is concerned with a phenomena of everyday observation and would 
be discussed in the first part of Physics 2 course yet only 
44% of Grade XII pupils answer it correctly. 

Question 5 Test II (a) is vitally concerned with an 
understanding of a hydraulic press which is discussed in General 
Science I, yet only 37% of Grade XII pupils answer it correctly. 

The rest of the questions are based on physical phenomena 
or principles which are studied in Physics I and some of them 
in General Science 1 as well. 

There seems to be no simple reason for these items not 
being answered correctly by a larger percentage of the pupils. 

The wording of the questions does not seem to be any that would 
make these more difficult to understand; the principles involved 
seem as important and the mathematics no more difficult than 
that in the other questions which were answered more successfully. 
It does indicate that these items are not well understood and 
perhaps confused with something else. It might be taken to 
indicate that there is an attempt to include too many facts in 
these science courses. Or it might be there is a lack of co¬ 
ordination in these facts which would give pupils generalizations 
enabling them to understand all the separate items. Guch a 
conclusion would reflect on the quality of the teaching and 
presentation of these subjects as much as on the ability of the 
pupils.

CHAPTER V 


TEST III 

A Hote on the Test 

The forms of the Test, III (a) and III (Id) are given 
below. It is a multiple choice completion type of test* Each 
question consists of a statement, with five choices to complete 
it. The subject is required to indicate by a "T" that one of 
the choices which he thinks makes the statement true* The 
directions given at the top of each test were: "Mark "T" in 
the margin on the right hand of the page after that one of 
the five parts of each of the following statements which you 
think makes it true. Por example. 

The house fly is harmful because it 

(a) has a poisonous bite •»*•••«»•»•••»•••»»•( 

(b) carries bacteria, etc... ... *(T 

(c) destroys food.,.. . 

id) is hard to strike*...,.,.*...**.,., .(

In the copies given below the choice which was accepted 
as correct is indicated by a "T" after that part. The lowest 
grade in which the question was answered correctly by 50^ of 
the pupils is indicated by the Roman numerals on the extreme 
left of each question (or by a blank in case the question was 
not answered correctly by 50^ of any grade). 

Attention is drawn to question 8 on Test III (a) in which 
an error caused both of choices (d) and (e) to be accepted as 
correct. This was however not very serious except that a better 
choice might have been substituted for part (d). Even in Grade 
VIII well over 5($ chose part (e) to be correct and this was 
originally intended to be the correct choice*

The material for this test was taken entirely from 
the General Science I text* One-half of the questions are 
concerning some fact presented in the first part of this book* 
The other half are questions which came to mind in reading 
this part of the text over, but which were not directly 
touched upon in the text. These two types of questions 
alternate on each test form. The odd numbered items are 
questions based directly on the text and the even numbered 
questions are concerned with some principle in a different 
situation or application.

Q,uestions "Learned” in Each Grade 

The questions are grouped for further consideration 
as in Tests I and II on the basis of those which were answer¬ 
ed correctly by 5($ of the pupils in a grade and by less than 
50^ in lower grades* Such grouping shows more clearly which 
items are learned in each grade. In the tabulation the part 
of the test (a) or (b) is indicated on the left side and then 
the number of the question on this part of the test. The 
question is stated again for convenience and the choice 
accepted as the correct answer is indicated by a *T f in the 
right margin after that choice. The percentage of correct 
answers in each grade is indicated as before following each 
question. 


Grade VIII Questions 


(a) 8. Deserts are frequently found on the leeward side of 

mountains because 

(a) the moisture laden atmosphere after passing over 
the mountains, comes down the other side into a 
region of greater atmospheric pressure, the 
moisture is condensed and falls as rain.) 

(b) there is no vegation here to attract moisture 

or rain ) 

(c) the sun*s rays strike this region more directly 
thus it is hot and dry here) 

(d) the atmosphere which passes over the mountains 

is saturated with water vapor at those conditions 
of low temperature and pressure, but it comes into 
a high pressure region and its ability to hold 
moisture is increased, so these drying winds.•(T) 

(e) the air which strikes that region has lost most 
of its moisture in passing over the cold region 
of the mountains, holding abilities are increased

The first four of these questions were not actual facts 
discussed in the General Science I course but v/er@ related ques¬ 
tions of a practical nature. It is interesting to note that they 
were answered correctly by such a large percentage of VIII pupils. 
It would seem to indicate that these questions are sufficiently 
elementary or common that they are fairly generally known. It 
is also possible with the exception question 8, Test III (b) 
that they have entered into the school work of these pupils. The 
other question, 11, Test III (b) is remarkably well known, likely 
because of it coming into the work of these pupils in arithmetic.

That a great many of these questions on this test should 
be answered by Grade IX would be expected* The questions are 
based on their science work and only that part of the text was 
covered in the test which it was thought a Grade IX class would 
have covered at the time they received the test* It is interest 
ing to note the relatively high percentage of correct answers by 
Grade VIII on such questions as 16 and 18 on Test III fet) and 14 
and 18 on Test III (b). A good many of these pupils seem to 
have acquired some information or ideas on these subjects which 
lie outside their school work. 

The questions 10, 16 and 18 on Test III (a) and 2, 14 
and 18 on Test III (b) were not factual items in the text but 
related to some matter in the course. It is encouraging to note 
that they were answered correctly by over half the Grade IX 
pupils* It will be noted however that they are answered correct 
ly by fewer pupils than are the other questions which are based 
on facts or principles stated directly in the text*

answered them correctly is quite encouraging. The remainder 
of the questions are directly concerned with facts discussed 
in the text. These seem to be items about which there is con¬ 
siderable confusion of terms or principles. Only one of these 
questions, 3, Test III (b) is ever learned by over *70%. of any

Of these questions only three, 7 and 13 on Test IXl(a) 
and 7 on Test III (b) are based directly on facts in the 
General Science text. These items are learned by only a 
very small percentage of the high school pupils. The re¬ 
mainder of the questions are not so directly presented to 
the pupils, and in these connections principles they have 
learned do not seem to be applied. 


















CHAPTER VI 


TEST IV 

A Note on the Test 

The two parts, (a) and (b), of the test are given below. 
The directions to the pupil for answering were: "In the right 
hand margin indicate whether the following statements are 
’true 1 or ’false 1 by marking a ’T* or a f F’ in the space 
after each." 

These tests are composed of forty-five superstitions 
or beliefs which have no scientific basis and yet which are 
frequently heard. Distributed among these statements are 
twenty-six statements which have been subject to more scion tific 
study most of which come up in Science courses in the schools. 
These statements, which might be called jokers, were inserted 
merely to keep the subjects’ minds alert and so prevent them 
from checking indiscriminately. These items are indicated in 
the tests by a mark (—) in the left margin opposite that state¬ 
ment • 

The statements of superstitions and beliefs on Test IV 
(a) and the first nine on Test IV (b) were ones given to a 
group of seniors at this University as a project in Psychology 
51 by E. J. Kib'blewhite and W. B* McBougall. It was thought 
it might be interesting to compare the extent of these beliefs 
among high school pupils with this group of University students. 
The remainder of the items on Test IV (b) are from a test used 
in studying unfounded beliefs by Caldwell and Lundem.^

Distribution of w Scores” in the Different Grades 

In the M scoring” of these tests the number of statements 
of superstitions or beliefs which were marked true on each paper 
was recorded• The following tables and graphs show the frequency 
distributions of such w scores” on each test* In addition to show¬ 
ing the distribution of these n sc ores* 1 in each grade the distribu¬ 
tion among the boys and among the girls of each grade is shown. 

The number of cases, U, and the mean "score", M, for each group 
is also given. On Test IV (a) there were twenty-five statements 
of superstitions or beliefs and on Test IV (b) there were twenty. 
By these tables and graphs the change from one grade to another 
in the number of these superstitions believed true, and the differ¬ 
ence among the pupils of any grade, is clearly shown. 

In the different grades the number of these statement of 
superstitions and beliefs which are thought to be true seem to 
decrease as the pupils advance from one grade to the ne&t. This 
trend is not any too obvious from these data, the is are certain 
irregularities and the actual amount of decrease, at least after 
the pupils are in high school, is not very great. Still this 
seems the trend indicated* 

Regarding differences between boys and girls it seems that 
in general the girls have a slightly greater belief in the truth 
of these superstitions. This conclusion is not entirely obvious 
and as regarding grade differences there are irregularities, end 
on the whole, a rather small difference* 

A considerable variation among the pupils in any grade 
regarding their belief in these superstitions seems to persist 
through the different grades. The range of variation decreases 
somewhat from one grade to the next but to this too there are

irregularities in the data* In each grade there are some pupils 
who have little or no faith in these superstitions, and there 
are some who believe in quite a number of them* 

In general these data do not very definitely indicate 
much difference between the different grades or between the sexes 
in respect to the pupils’ belief in superstitions* Perhaps what 
is indicated more than anything else is that these differences 
are probably much less than is generally thought* At the same 
time the actual amount or prevalence of such beliefs seems 
surprisingly high* 

For a comparison between these data and those collected 
by MeDougall & Kibblewhite for University seniors it will suffice 
to give means for each group* The test given to the University 
students consisted of those statements of superstitions and 
beliefs on Test TW (a) and the first nine on Test IY (b) with 
one other statement added, n Men are more superstitious than 
women”* The mean number of these statements (thirty-five in all) 
which were marked true by a group of 54 University students 
composed of men and women in the faculties of Arts and Medicine 
was 2.4 This shows a decrease from any of the high school 
groups. In this comparison it must be remembered also that there 
were thirty-five items on the test of MeDougall and Kibblewhite 
and only twenty-five on Test IV (a) and twenty on Test IV (t>).

Percentage Frequency of Answers to Questions 

The following tables give the percentage frequency with 
which each question was answered "true”, '•false 11 and omitted, 
by each group# In this case the answers are grouped, not only 
according to grades, but also according to sex in each grade* 
This reduced the number of cases in each group by approximately 
one-half, but it was thought worth while to see if there were 
any consistent differences between the boys and the girls re¬ 
garding their attitudes to superstitions and beliefs* 

In these tables, for each item the percentage of answers 
indicating that a statement is considered "true" by that group 
is given opposite that question number in the column f T f . The 
percentage of answers indicating that the statement is "false" 
is given in the column f * The percentage of pupils in the 
group that did not answer the item or who chose to modify it 
by adding "sometimes", and the like, is given in the column 
marked "Kb Answer"*

CHAPTER VII 


CONCLUSIONS AND SUGGESTIONS 


Percentage Success on Tests 

ffor purposes of comparison of the different tests the 

’’percentage success" on each in the different grades is given. 

By "percentage success” of a group on a test is meant the 

total number of corr ec t answers giv en by the group X 100 , or 

largest possible number of correct answers 

the sum of the scores of all the pupils i n th e group X 100 
number of items on the test X the number of pupils 

" Sc ore", here for Tests I, II and III means the number of items 

answered correctly on the test. To bring Test IV into view in 

a similar manner "score" is interpreted to mean the number of 

statements of superstitions or beliefs which were marked true. 

These "percentage successes" are shown in the following 

table and graph.

Conclusions 

Test Io - The increase in scientific vocabulary between the 
different grades seems to be considerable. In many cases 
it seemed that the words taken up in the science course of 
one grade are not learned by the pupils of that grade, but 
by the pupils in the next grade. This may be due to the fact 
that these tests were given in the middle of the term so the 
pupils had not covered the work of the grade they are classi¬ 
fied with, or it may be that some words are not satisfactorily 
learned until they appear? before the pupil in some other con¬ 
nection than when he first sees them. A number of words did 
not seem to be learned by very many pupils of any grade, and 
these are practically all words which the pupils are certain 
to have had contact with. This is likely due to some confused 
relationship formed with the word. On the whole the results 
seem to indicate that a large increase in scientific voca¬ 
bulary is made in each grade. 

Test II.- The learning of mathematical relationships in science, 
as these are measiired by this test, does not seem as thorough 
as is the learning of a scientific vocabulary. There seems 
even to be considerable inability to x*ead questions and under¬ 
stand the problem, eg, Questions 2. (b) and 4., on Test II (b) 
are very simple yet they were answered correctly by only 60^ 
and 26% respectively, of the pupils in Grade XII. In general 
I think this test has indicated a serious deficiency in the 
pupils * ability in science. It is one which I think might well 
warrant further study. The ability has been shown to increase 
with further training in science but the considerable number 
of items which were not "learned*' by any grade would seem to

indicate that there is some deficiency her* which is not re¬ 
moved by ordinary instruction. 

Test I II.- This test was answered considerably better than 
Test II, as shown by the table and graph of percentage success 
on these tests. It indicates that the pupils* ability to remem¬ 
ber facts and principles that have been presented to them is 
somewhat greater Ilian is their ability to apply this knowledge 
to other situations. This is perhaps what would be expected 
but the difference as indicated by this test is probably less 
than might be expected. Certainly the deficiency in ability 
indicated by this test is less than that indicated by Test II. 
Tes t IV. - While this test may not be an adequate measure of a 
scientific attitude I think it certainly throws some light on 
this aspect of the pupils* development. A pupil who had 
developed a questioning attitude, and the habit of demanding 
facts to base his judgements on, would certainly not mark these 
superstitions "True”. It has been indicated that this quality 
as measured by this test does improve with further instruction 
but the rate and amount improved is not very great. In each 
grade there are some pupils who seem to have grasped very little 
of its significance and, on the other hand, some who seem to 
possess it. 

Tests I, I I and III contrast ed with Test jn^ a .. There are two 
distinctly different types of qualities being measured in this 
investigation. There is first the learning of facts and prin¬ 
ciples - the vocabulary that goes with them, their relation to 
mathematics, and their application to new situations. This 
has been the work of Test I, II and III. The other test, Test IV, 
is measuring something which is an attitude or an outlook. This

is something quite different, hut it is none-the-less an important 
quality. For the first type of measurement we saw significant 
improvement with further training. But with Test IV there is 
relatively little improvement shown with further training in 
science. It would seem that a scientific attitude, as this 
test measures it, is not veiy greatly influenced by further 
science instruction. 

Suggestions for Future Work 

1. The five studies indicated in the “Introduction 11 are sug¬ 
gested for future lines of investigation in the field of high 
school science in this subject. 

2. Factors which may influence results obtained from investi¬ 
gations in this field and which should be given consideration 
are: science courses taken, other courses taken, contacts out 
of school, age of pupils, and selection of pupils. 

3. In order to determine the value of any course in developing 
any ability being measured it is necessary, first to conduct 
tests at beginning or end of a school term, secondly to have 
sufficient number of cases, or pupils, answering questions, 
that the tests may be grouped according to combinations of 
subjects taken. 

4. Great stress is placed on the importance of the test to be 
given. Its construction is perhaps the most important part 

of the whole work (with due regard to the necessity of getting 
a sufficient number of cases). 

5. Questions and problems on a test should be made simple, 
clear and concise. Yet it is to be kept in mind that they 
should be concerned with some principle or fact which is of 
importance. But they need not be “difficult 11 •

6* It is felt that some scheme or order, or criterion for 
selection of items to he placed on a test is of value. This 
is necessary to give a satisfactory basis for comparison or 
statement of progress of subjects studied. 

7. The following tests have been compiled from items on Test I, 
II and III and have certain advantages over these original tests 
The items chosen are graded by the results from the original 
tests. Certain ones have been chosen which cover the same 
range of difficulty as the original tests and which distribute 
themselves as evenly as possible over this range. Further the 
tests and items are short, and less satisfactory items lave 
been omitted. 

11 Suggested Test I** contains fifty items of the eighty- 
nine which appeared on the original Test I. Of the^ fifty 
items* nine have been chosen as representative of the group 
of words which the original test showed were learned in each 
of the grades from VIII to XII, and five items have been in¬ 
cluded as representative of that group of words which were not 
"learned" in any grade. 

"Suggested Test II" contains twenty items from the 
original Test II. These items have been chosen as evenly 
distributed over the whole range of difficulty covered by 
the original test as was possible. The items as shown by 
results from the original test are nearly all too difficult 
for Grades VIII and IX. Use of this test should be restricted 
to Grades XI and XII or perhaps X, XI and XII. It would be 
advisable, to add a few simpler questions if it were to be used 
even in Grade X and certainly for use in Grade IX.

"Suggested Test III” contains twenty-four items chosen 
to distribute themselves over the whole range of difficulty 
covered by the original Test III. While in the original 
Test III the "factual” items were alternated with those 
questions where the pupils were required to apply their 
knowledge, in this test these two parts are futther segregated. 
The first twelve items on this "suggested test” are facts or 
principles given or discussed in the test* The second twelve 
questions (13-24) are items in which the pupils are required 
to apply their knowledge*
