ABSTRACT 


The members of the Enoch Band are part of the Indian minority 
group in Canada. This study was designed to investigate the background 
and development of the Enoch Vegetable Project and to give an evaluation 
of the social and economic implications. The project was set up to 
supply work and to give the community something on which to build its 
self-confidence. 

The study showed that the problems faced by the Band members 
prior to the start of the Vegetable Project made farming virtually 
impossible. Tlie problem was aggravated furtlier by the lack of job 
opportunities available on the Reserve.. These factors contributed to 
a weakening of the economic and social fabric of the community. 

The Vegetable Project although suffering a financial loss 
provided work and greater self-confidence which enabled Band members 
to overcome some of their earlier problems. 

Considerably more success could have been achieved if the 
white Canadian society had provided greater underscanding, effective 
administration and less paternalism. 

It is recomm.ended that from now on the Band members be 
directly involved in all decisions regarding the Vegetable Project and 
their ideas be used. The organization of the Project should be changed 
to reward those who do superior work in order to provide incentive.

CHAPTER I 


THE STONY PLAIN RESERVE AND THE ENOCH BAND 

Description of the Reserve 

Population and Land Utilization 

This study was conducted on the Stony Plain Indian Reserve 
located three miles west of Edmonton. It is the home of the Enoch Band 
whose members are of Cree ancestory and are considered Plains Cree. In 1965 
they numbered 420. Table 1 categorizes their population by age groups and 
compares these with the age distribution of the population of Alberta. 

The Reserve, which is 20 square miles in area, had 9,000 of its 
12,800 acres under cultivation in 1965. Of the 8,000 acres rented to 
farmers, about 7,000 acres were in cereal crops with an additional 1,000 
acres in potatoes. One Band member farmed 160 acres, while a Co-op farm 
had 500 acres cultivated. The "Vegetable Project" involved 350 acres 
in 1965. Also a development firm rented 680 acres for Tomahawk Park (a 
recreation park) and the government leased 710 acres for a rifle range. 

Soil 

Over 4,000 acres of the soil of the Reserve is Ponoka Loam, 
an eluvated black soil with about IS inches of top soil. This soil is 
rated very good to excellent in productive ability. It is considered 
the best soil in the Edmonton area and some of the choicest in Alberta. 

There are 5,189 acres of Number 7 soil including the 4,000 acres of Ponoka 
Loam. In addition, there are 4,539 acres of Number 5 soil, 2,272 acres of 
pasture and wasteland, and about 800 acres are taken up by Yekau Lake (Figure 1).

Pasture and Waste 


Figure’ 1 SOIL RATING OF STONEY PLAIN INDIAN RESERVE 
























































Included in the above acreages are about 3,200 acres of Winterburn Loam 
with a top soil depth of 25 inches and a rating of very good in 
productive ability. Due to the rolling topography only about 700 acres 
of the h'interburn Loam is rated as Number 7 soil; the rest is classed 
as Number 5. Some of the Number 5 soil inc].udes 2,000 acres of Winter- 
burn and Leith fine sandy loam. The pasture and wasteland is marsh, 
organic soil, or Leith loamy sand.^ 

Climat e 

The climate of the area is characterized by relatively warn 
summers and cold winters. The mean summer temperature from. May to 
September inclusive, is 56°F. The average frost free period is about 
100 days, x^/ith an extreme variation from about 50 to 150 days. The 
gro\^7ing period for cool season vegetables, calculated on a mean dail2/ 
tem.perature of 42°F. , is about 175 days. 

The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches with a 

range betx-zeen 9 and 30 inches. About 70 percent of the precipitation 

falls as rain. June, July, and August are the m^onths of heaviest 

rainfall, averaging just over nine inches. There is an average of 

2,175 hours of sunshine per year, 45 percent of the possible hours of 

sunshine. During the grox-zing season about 60 percent of the possible 

2 

hours of sunshine is received.

Q]1 and Ga s 

The Stony Plain Reserve, so vzealthy in farmland and 
fortunate in clim.ate, has another valuable natural resource—oil. Oil 
was discovered on the Reserve about 1950. In July 1965 there were 38 
producing oil vrells and four gas wells on the Reserve from which the 
revenue was about $150,000 a year. 

Sources of Revenue 

Moreover. additional revenue accrues from agricultural 
land leased to white fariaers. This income ranges between $60,000 and 
$100,000 a year. The land leased for a rifle range and park brings in 
$6,240 yearly so the Band receives between $210,000 and $250,000 
annually from the sale and lease of natural resources. In June 1965 
the Band funds amounted to over $1,300,000, held in trust by Indian 
Affairs. 

However, the Enoch Band has not always been quite so 
affluent. Prior to the discovery of oil in 1950 the Reserve formed a 
relatively isolated small rural comm.unity. Before 1950 most Band 
mem.bers had only limited contacts with the rest of society. Following 
the discovery of oil and the beginning of land rental to non-Indian 
farmers, Band members were assured an income which considerably changed 
their way of living. 

Enoch Band Reserve Before 1965 

In order to understand the outcome, and to plan for the 
future of the Enoch Band Vegetable Project, it is necessary to relate 
the present situation on the Reserve to that before 1965.

Farming 

Band members have farmed on the Reserve for a long time. 

Up to the end of World War 11 it appears that agriculture on the Reserve 
was much the same as that of the average farming area adjacent to the 
Reserve. The fields were small and scattered because Band members 
cleared only land that had few trees and little undergrowth. At a 
meeting of Band members called by the Indian Agent in 1945, they were 
told that the number of acres farmed in 1945 was less than the number 
farmed in 1940. Fences were not being kept up, and there was a resulting 
loss of crops because cattle were getting into the fields. Moreover, 
farmers were not taking care of their farm buildings, some of which had been 
allowed to deteriorate badly. Not only did this situation exist in 1945, 
but the same theme can be found in the present correspondence. 

It is important here to note the conditions under which the 
Band members were trying to farm, because these conditions help to 
explain many of the poor farming methods and the apparent inefficiency 
of Band farmers. For instance, on November 28, 1952, a Band member 
signed all the necessary papers for a loan to purchase a machine, but 
did not receive the loan until October 24, 1953. In the meantime, (as 
noted beside the transcation in the books) his summerfallow could not 
be worked. (In conversation with the man the author learned that the 
machine was a disk.) 

Another situation of this type occurred in April of 1953. 

A Band member applied for a loan to purchase a double disk. He signed 
four copies of the application for the loan and two copies of the 
assignment of interest. The Superintendent wrote a letter of recommendation.

the Regional Superintendent wrote a letter of recommendation, and three 
copies of indenture were signed on September first. When the Band 
member finally received the machine on October 24, 1953, a bill of sale 
by the seller, a letter from the Superintendent of Reserves and Trusts, 
and an order to supply from the Indian Agent were written. 

A final example involves a letter of complaint written 
in 1953 by a Band member to the Indian Agent regarding the selling 
of feed. 

We have to go ten miles into Edmonton to weigh,the grain 
before we can sell it. [And] most of the feed is sold in 
the Winterbum area which means the feed is hauled about 18 
miles. 

Furthermore, at that time all the hauling was done with horses. It 
takes only a few such examples to convince Band members that farming 
on their own is not x^7orth the risk. 

In 1952 Agricultural leases were granted to surrounding 
farmers to farm Reserve land. At the time comments such as "agriculture 
is the m.ainstay of Indians on the Reserve, and any development along 
sound business lines is a step in the right direction and will prove 
to be of value in the years to come" were commonly heard. However, the 
leasing did not have the desired effect. Band members observed certain 
things about their white neighbors. Outside the Reserve farmers had 

f 

freedom to change and make adj ustm.ents, a fact that is essential to 
successful farming. Agriculture was booming, and farmers were purchasing 
new and more efficient equipment to farm the larger acreages available 
on the Reserve. Non-Indian farmers did not have to spend days filling 
out forms and waiting months to have a request filled for new machinery. 
The farmer off the Reserve had only to spend an hour or so at a bank to 


discover if he could have a new machine.

By 1955 a feeling of resignation seems to have set in among 
Band m.embers. The following statem.ent is found in the Agency books 
about that time. "It is doubtful if the Band v/ill benefit if more of 
their land is cleared and broken by non-Indians." Another comment made 
in September 1953 emphasizes the point that not only Band members 
realized that Indian farming could not compete. "On the whole most 
Indians do not farm sufficient acreages or have enough m.achinery to 
make their efforts economically sound." 

Though land was being leased to non-Band members, there 
was always help available to members from the Indian Affairs Branch for 
those who wanted to start fanning. From 1954 to 1960 six men were 
given machinery costing a total of $40,000 to start farming. All six 
Band members failed. Most of the Indian Affairs people felt that the 
failures w'ere due to poor management. For instance, tractors were 
used to go to the bootleggers in Edmonton, Grain was sold and the mLoney 
spent before any bills x^■^ere paid. Im.plements disappeared. The 
variability of figures in table 2 gives som.e indication of the Band 
members inability to decide whether to farm on their owni or rent to 
outsiders.

In 1963 the Superintendent suggested at a Council meeting 
that a Co-op farm might be set up. This idea was taken up by five of 
the men, and in May 1965 a Co-op farm was officially started. The 
Council set aside five quarters for the Co-op farm. Out of a total of 
800 acres, 554 v/ere cultivated. It was decided that they should seed 
469 acres and sumnerfal.lov/ 85 acres. Machinery worth $17,300 was 
purchased, and the Band set aside $5,500 for operating expenses. All 
money from sales of Co-op farm produce were to be deposited at the 
Agency, where one-half would be collect until the debts were paid off. 
It was expected that during the first year’s operation sales x^7ould 
come to $14,000, which would leave the members profits of $7,000 or 
$1,400 each. In a latter resolution it was decided that one dollar 
per hour would be paid first for all labour out of the one-half share 
coming to the members. Despite the planning the Co-op did not 
function xcell and w^as disbanded after the first year. There were no 
books kept. When the time came to pay the Band, one member of the 
Co-op who had been elected foreman and bookkeeper estimated the 
returns to be about $4,484.52, Considering the. 469 acres that were 
seeded, this seems a very low figure. Only $624.52 of this was sold 
through the Agency. It Xv^as mentioned in a Council meeting that the 
Co-op farm x%ras $3,000 short of meeting operating expenses. 

Education 

kTien a teenager on the Reserve w^as asked what he though 
most teenagers on the Reserve X'Zanted, he replied "A good time, lots to 
drink, and no vzork, just like our parents.” This teenager has knoxzn 
the Bank members as friends since his first rememberances and does not 
look down on them. To him his comment was a statement of fact.

Unfortunately, for many it is true. The author asked one eighteen- 
year-old boy what he was going to do this winter, and his response was 
"nothing, why should I." A mother talking about her son said "we want 
him to go to school, but he wants to stop and buy a car. I guess we 
can't stop him, as everyone else his age is doing this." In 1965-66 
there were nine students between 15 and 19 attending school out of 
a possible 55. 

There are the conditions that exist 11 years after children 
of the Enoch Band were first sent to the Jasper Place Separate School 
Board schools. For a few years grade one and two continued at the local 
school, but now all students go to Jasper Place for their schooling. 

A kindergarden has been started on the Reserve to attempt to put the 
children in a more receptive frame of mind for starting grade one. The 
transporting of Band children to Jasper Place schools was started in the 
hope that educating them in a non-Indian school would modify some of 
their antagonism toward non-Indians. It was hoped that this antagonism 
would be reduced by association of Indian with non-Indian children. 

There was resistance to this integration both among the 
Band members and among whites. In 1958 the following comment was made, 
"the non-Indian public continues to show considerable resistance to 
integration." Non-Indian parents for example, claimed that some Indian 
children had lice (a fact which was substantiated in 1962 when a Band 
girl was sent home for this reason). 

Integration was hardest for the first students sent to 
the city school. Young adults on the Reserve told of humiliation inside 
the classroom and out. Teachers commented publicly that Indian students 
did something "because they did not knew any better." They were often

demoted a grade or two. During recesses and noon hours on the play¬ 
ground where Band children could compete individually, Indian students 
held their own. However, back in the classroom the student was again 
made aware of his position. At noonhour there was another problem, 
that of lunches. There is a definite social order based on the contents 
of lunch kits. In the hierarchy there is the boiled potato on the 
lowest level, then pancakes left over from breakfast, graduating up to 
sandwiches with jam, and finally meat sandwiches. The meagre contents 
of their lunches placed Indian children on the bottom of the social rung. 
Miat had been a fine lunch in the rural school, caused humiliation in 
Jasper Place. Since lunches were an excuse given by many of the students 
for being truant, the Band Council started making noon lunches for the 
children. In this way the childiun were assured of at least one good 
meal a day. It is well knoxm that children suffering from hunger do not 
learn as easily as well fed children, and a case v/as reported in 1961 
in Jasper Place of an Indian student fainting from hunger. 

Furthermore, Indian’students had study problems at home. 

There was no quiet place to study. It is mentioned in Council minutes 
and correspondence six times that teenagers simply cannot do their 
homework at home. Some asked that soundproof partitions be put into 
their homes to give one quiet room for study. In 1965-66 there were 
about 420 people living on the Reserve in about 50 residences, indicating 
that there were 8.4 people per house, and over 35 percent of the people 
were under 15 years of age. Thus it is quite easy to see why they have 
trouble. Nor has the problem been resolved to any great extent. On 
September 24, 1963, the principal caught eight truants. In 1966 eight 
truants were caught stealing candy.

Social Activities 

Clubs and organizations have been started on the Reserve; 
however, none of them have lasted very long. In 1954 a Social Welfare 
worker organized a teen club, to which the Band Council gave $50.00 for 
records. It soon disbanded. The R.C.M.P. started a boy’s boxing club. 
It lasted until the policeman who started the club was transferred. 

Other short-lived organizations and ideas can also be listed. In 1963 
the Band approved $680.00 for ballet instruction and $30.00 for a record 
player; but interest soon waned. In 1964 Saint John’s Ambulance cam.e to 
the Reserve to teach first aid; but no one came for the first night 
of instruction. 

There seems to be a pattern to these organizations and 
their demise. Someone outside the Reserve may decide that a certain 
club 5 organization, or interest is what the Band needs, or possibly 
a Band member may take a course off the Reserve or in some way be 
excited by the possibilities of some organization. So a club, group, 
or organization will be started, the individual with the idea taking 
most of the responsibility. I'Jhen the initiator leaves or becomes 
disinterested, the organization disintegrates. 

An interesting organization on the Reserve now is the Enoch 
Band. One young man started and financed this band; he collects the 
Band members and transports them to dances. Although the Band is quite 
successful, he has an extremely hard time keeping the members together 
and in a condition to play. 

For instance, the band has been playing at the local hall 

I 

for teenagers. Unfortunately many adults come, and several fights 
have broken out. Because of this the Band Manager has stopped playing

at the hall. If he were to let up in his efforts, the band would 
immediately stop. In another effort a Band member organized a baseball 
team for girls under 15, in the summer of 1966. They were in a league 
with the surrounding toims. He also faced the same organizational 
problems. He received little or no help. He picked the girls up, took 
them to the games, and brought them home. There was little financial 
help from any source, though the Band did buy some equipm.ent. 

Economics of the Band 

Previously in this Chapter, mention was made of the Band’s 
sources of revenue, which are considerable. In this section certain 
typical examples will be used to demonstrate what use the Band members 
are making of their incomes. 

By 1951 (when the Reserve had 14 producing oil wells) Band 
members were receiving $12 per person per month.. Moreover, as Canadian 
citizens the Band members received Baby bonuses and Old Age and x^^ar 
pension cheques. As is evident in Table 3, Band members have considerable 
income, all of \A7hich except for the $820 treaty money, comes from the 
sale and lease of natural resources on the Reserve. 

An example of the use to which Band members put their money 
before 1965 was found in the narrative of an Indian Affairs employee. 

He noted that often 30 taxis would line up outside the Agency on payday 
to transport Band members into the city as soon as they received their 
money. Also lease money, which usually came all at once, was used for 
spending sprees in to’;rm. By 1955 the interest payment had been raised 
to $20.00, and a special payment of $35.00, a Debt Reducing Interest 
Payment, was being distributed. Furthermore, a "game" had evolved among 
Band members. Any means was sanctioned to elicit Band money for individual

Band members. Though some Band members might miss out on one payment, 
they knev7 they could receive help from those who had managed to get 
more money. Some Band memhers became very efficient at the "game" and 
managed to receive a substantial income for their efforts. An example 
of this extortion can be found in the 1965-1966 charges for transportation 
to hospital. Two thousand, six hundred and forty-two dollars and fifty 
cents was spent from Band funds transporting Band members to hospital. 

The rate paid was $3.50 per trip. Therefore, 755 people went to the 
hospital in one year. One man apparently made four trips in 30 minutes. 

This attitude of spending whatever you get when you get it 
was reinforced when the Band set up a loan scheme. Anyone could obtain 
a mid-month loan to carry him through the month. There was little 
thought of repayment on these loans; the agency took the money owed 
off the next month’s allotment. Thus the debtor felt no responsibility 
toward what he owed. Spend what you get they seemed to feel, for others 
have already taken all they can. The steady source of income seems to 
have destroyed the art of money management, made extortion a game, and 
destroyed the people's drive and initiative to save.

ENOCH BAND PROBLEMS AND THE VEGETABLE PROJECT STUDY 

General Minority Group Problems 
The Canadian Indian is a member of a minority group, and 
as such he is often the target for prejudice. For the Indian there are 
two closely related, but distinguishable, consequences of prejudice. 
These are (I) the effect of prejudice on the personality traits of the 
individual, and (2) the effects of prejudice on the structures and 
processes of the minority group.^ Since the personality of an 
individual is nearly developed by the tim.e he is fifteen years old, 
to explain or judge the behavior of an adult without a thorough under¬ 
standing of his childhood experiences is to miss basic causes. If 
the dominant elements of North American society or any other society 
isolate a segment of the population from contact with prevailing normiS 
and prevent that segment from sharing in the rewards which accrue to 
the adherence to these norms, the appearance of a subculture x/ith 

different motivations and standards of conduct should not come as a 

2 

surprise. 

There is a sense of pessimism among the people. The 
young feel that they must or will fall into the same 
patterns as their elders. Sociologists tell us that 
the aimless living, laziness and uncleanness found 
on many reserves is not the fault of the Indians but 
com.es fromi the normal frustration of minority groups 
faced with IoX'7-incom.e living.

Certain Canadian policies established for all Indians have contributed to 

the "frustration of [Indians as] minority groups faced with low-income 

living."^ Reserve living for example, tends to isolate the Indian, 

/ 

keeping him constantly aware of his minority group status and forces him 

to miss many socioeconomic opportunities open to the dominant group. He 
2 

often feels insecure —an insecurity caused by the prejudice an Indian 
encounters from childhood. 

In every region [of Canada] I found a deep rooted prejudice 
against them, a prejudice that was stronger in some places 
than in others but one V7hich was noticeable everywhere from 
Atlantic to Pacific. It was strongest in the West.^ 

"You understand the Indian people better when you realize that they live 

in constant fear of prejudice and that they have no united front against 

this terror because they live [or were brought up] on [socially] isolated 

m4 

reserves. 

Moreover, the Indian Act segregates the Indian population, 
giving them separate laws and a separate government branch to administer 
them. Indian leaders have been left with little responsibility and no 
authority. There is little local or tribal government left, and there¬ 
fore no leadership or leadership training on the reserves. An adequate 
education is a prerequisite of any leader, and an Indian dealing with 
educated governmental employees should have enough formal education to 
communicate with them on an equal basis. But the m.en who should be taking

over tribal leadership have not received an adequate education. One 

possible explanation for this lack of education may be found in the 

following excerpt from a letter written in 1940 by a member of the 

Department of Indian Affairs. 

The Department doubts the advisability of encouraging the 
older pupils to proceed along academic lines. Under the 
circumstances, the books required are not being supplied. 

It is felt that when pupils reach the age of 12 or 14 years, 
the school management should emphasize vocational rather 
than academic training for Indian students. 

The Indian Problem 

If their diet was deficient, their health poor, their 
housing unsatisfactory, it was the fault of the white 
man, they said, and the white man*s government should 
set things right. So it came about that an atmosphere 
of mingled apathy and discontent had settled on the 
reserves, and it was apathy that dominated.^ 

Thus a "segregation camp mentality" is slowly built up. The feeling of 

"apathy" mentioned by Jenness is one of the most serious aspects of what 

is commonly referred to as the "Indian Problem". Laskin breaks the 

problem down into three categories: cultural-ethical, biological, and 

2 

motivational. The cultural-ethical aspect concerns the decision hy 
Indians to retain as much of their culture as they wish, or to transform 
themselves into average Canadians. The biological part of the problem 
is very simple. The reserves are becoming overpopulated, 

A solution for the motivational part of the Indian Problem 
is the most difficult to forsee. A great deal of research has been

devoted to the source of achievement motive, the readiness to work hard 
and postpone immediate satisfactions in order to get ahead. Three 
generalizations can be made on the basis of the data gathered: (1) class 
is m.ore important than race or ethnic group in determing the strength 
of the achievement motive; (2) an important line of demarcation can be 
dra\m between lower-lower and upper-lox'/er class (a line of special 
significance am.ong non-whites); and (3) the desire for achievement is 
not alxv'^ays accompanied by the expectation of achievement.^ In the 
attitude of shame and apathy that prevails on many reserves, one can 
see that the achievement motive no longer exists for many Indians. Their 
attitude can easily be traced to its origins: (1) the collapse of the 
traditional tribal culture with its unique values, symbols of achieve¬ 
ment, socialization stages, and structuring of motivation, meaning, and 
life that it involved; (2) the introduction of the white man’s religion, 
education, and generally his norms, which often condemned as diabolical 
and pagan the Indian’s culture, or simply ignored it as unworthy of 
official acknoxv^ledgement; and (3) the encounter with jobs and wages 
involving new skills and work disciplines which, because they were , 
initially difficult to master, earned for Indians the stigma of lazy, 
stupid, and good-for-nothing. Thus for many the reserves have become 
havens from the loneliness, contempt, and failures of life outside-- 

sanctuaries that offer subsistance and relief rations, perhaps shamefully 

2 

but stoically received.

Problems of the Enoch Band 

Farming or Renting 

The members of the Enoch Band have encountered all the problems 
and suffered from all the injustices mentioned. One of the first things 
to look at in a rural community is how the land is being farmed. Some 
of the land of the Reserve has been and still is rented to non-Indian 
farmers. The renting of farmland to non-Indian farmers has affected 
the Band members in two ways. Either the high yields that came from 
the white farmers’ new techniques motivated the Band members to try 
farming their oxnTI land, or they became discouraged by the success of the 
non__indian farmers and felt it was hopeless to try farming for themselves. 

If a Band member wished to farm his own 3.and, he could 
receive a Certificate of Possession from the government. However, even a 
Band member with the best of intentions met governmental red tape, inability 
to get the right machinery at the right time, and the social pressure on 
the Reserve against saving money“”factors which ultimately would discourage 
him from farming. Therefore, after Band members took back the land for a 
year or two to make an attempc at farming it, they often turned it over 
to a white renter when the Certificate of Possession was theirs. In 
this way the Indian received all the -proceeds -of’ the land £a-r--himself. -— 

Also, on giving evidence of serious Intent to farm the land Band 
members were given sets of machinery. Often this machinery was sold 
or traded. Once Band members were assured an adequate income, they 
began to play games w^ith Indian Affairs to see hov7 much of their money 
they could get back from the Trust set up for them in Ottawa.

Money Management 

Until a few years ago Enoch Band members had been able to 
manage their money well enough to carry them through. However, the 
attitude developed that when a person gets some money, he is expected 
to spend it. With a few exceptions the people spend their money as soon 
as they receive it and expect the Indian Affairs Branch to pay their debts 
from their oil dividends. This system has pyramided to the extent that 
a special fund was set up to allow a Band member to borrow from the 
Band Council to carry him through until the end of the month. Thus nearly 
all semblance of financial management within the Band has broken do^^m. 
Oth er Social Problems 

There are many individuals who are only too happy to assist 
Indians in extorting more m.oney from Indian Affairs and to trade them 
anything for liquor. Often Band members are cheated or used by these 
whites. Though they realize this. Band members continue to trade with 
these whites because at least they treat them well and do not openly 
discriminate against them. 

The feeling of social isolation has been accentuated and 
made obvious to the Indians after 1950. After that time the increased 
revenue of the Band allov/ed more Band members to come into the city. 

In Edmonton which became their trading center after 1950, the Band 
memhers met prejudice. They were told that they were different and 
inferior to the rest of society. Naturally this built up a feeling of 
hostility among the Band members. 

In an attempt to alleviate these hostile feelings, Indian 
children beyond grade two were transferred from the Catholic Residential 
School (which they had been attending to the age of 15 or until they

ran away, the latter usually being the case) to the separate schools 
in Jasper Place. However, this move created more problems for the 
children. Firstly, the residential school had been teaching at a low 
level. Many children were dropped back one or two grades on moving to 
Jasper Place. Secondly, the high standard of living and greater 
sophistication of the urban children reflected unhappily on the rural 
Band children. For example, the Band children were ashamed to open their 
lunch boxes, because the contents could not compete with that of the 
Jasper Place students. Finally, the children were subjected to the 
discrimination experienced by minority groups when they enter new areas. 
The result was a high level of truancy which still exists today. 

It is obvious that a multitude of problems existed in 1965, 
the time of the inception of the Vegetable Project. The Family Service 
Bureau of Edmonton spent nearly two years working with Band members. 

When they advised a person to return to his community and improve himself 
he could not, because there was no place for a person to turn to get the 
backing needed to help change his way of life. The Family Service Bureau 
reports stated these facts and suggested that some type of project be 
developed, where members of the Band could work. These reports stimulated 
Indian Affairs to start looking at various alternatives. One of their 
first steps was to hold raeetings with the Band members. At these 
meetings certain facts xv^ere stated: 

(1) In 1963 between 40 and 50 children were wards of the 
government. 

(2) BetX'jeen five and eight percent of the people xx^ere in 
jail constantly. 

(3) Only one man was actively farming his oxm land.

(4) Drinking was becoming an increasing problem every year. 

(5) Few men had jobs for longer than a month; some were 
not working at all. 

There was no work on the Pveserve, and when men left the Reserve to work, 
family trouble developed. Renting the land earned the Band members more 
money than farming it themselves. When the entire family left the 
Reserve for over a year to find work, the benefits received from Indian 
Affairs were cut off. 

After the problems had been so stated and discussed, the idea 
of a Vegetable Project emerged. The Project was suggested and finally 
chosen for these reasons: 

(1) There was not enough work to keep the forty men who 
needed work busy. 

(2) Though only six hours of labor are required to produce 
an acre of grain, it takes 160 hours of labor to produce 
an acre of carrots. 

(3) Edm.onton imports 90 percent of the carrots sold in its 
markets; 400 carloads of onions are imported into 
Alberta each year. 

(4) A few farmers had found that they could grow vegetables 
successfully in the Edmonton area; renting farmers had 
proved that Reserve land was suitable for raising 
potatoes. 

Vegetable Project Study 

At the beginning of the Project in 1965, Indian Affairs was 
concerned that some record be kept of the progress of the Project, its 
problems and any im.provem.ents that could be made in the scheme. Thus, on 
May first 1966, the Indian Affairs Branch authorized the Department of 
Agricultural Economics at the University to analyze the Vegetable Project. 
The object of the analysis was to evaluate the social and economic 
environment of the Enoch Band since World War II, to analyze the economics

of the Enoch Band Vegetable Project, to evaluate the levels of communication 
and the working relationships between each level of the Band and between 
the Band and Indian Affairs, and to recommend new agricultural programs 
designed to enhance Enoch Band resources. The study was to consider 
particularly the benefits and costs of the Project in terms of evaluating 
the economic efficiency of present development, the social benefits 
derived from the Project, and the potential development of land resources 
to obtain maximum returns for the residents of the Stony Plain Indian Reserve. 

All information for this study except part of the economic 
data, was gathered by using non-directive interviewing. No formal 
questionnair was prepared. During a seven month period Band members, 
local farmers, businessmen, members of the various committees concerned, 
and members of the staff of the Edmonton Indian Agency were contacted 
by the author. Discussions took place on an informal basis. During the 
discussions no notes were taken, and the inter’'/lewer did not lead the 
discussion after his interests were stated. To make this type of study, 
the interviewer lived on the Reserve and attempted to take part in most 
community activities where ideas and opinions might be exchanged. 

Economic and other data was obtained from Band, Agency, and 
personal files. The economic analysis follows the style of other studies 
done in the area so comparisons can be made easily. Much of the economic 
data has been broken douTi into a detailed analysis to show how the 
figures x-7ere computed and to make it possible for a continuing comparison 
to be made in future years.

CHAPTER III 


COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT 

Certain generalizations concerning Community, especially 

Rural Development, are of value here since the Vegetable Project is, 

after all, a Project intended to affect and benefit an entire community. 

Community Development has been described as: 

The process by which the efforts of the people themselves 
are united with those of the government authorities to 
improve the economic, social and cultural condition of 
communities to integrate these communities into the life of 
the nation and to enable them to contribute fully to 
national progress.^ 

It is important to keep in mind that one is working with 
the community as a v7hole; it is the community that is to be integrated 
into the life of the nation, not the individuals that are to be extracted 
from the community by som.e aspect of the community development process. 
The word process refers to a progression of events that are planned by 
the participants to serve goals they progressively choose. The events 

point to changes in a group and in individuals that can be termed growth 

2 

in social sensitivity and competence. This process usually follows a 
fairly definite pattern if it is successful. There are six major stages 

in the process: exploration, organization, discussion, action, new 

3 

projects, and finally continuation.

During the exploratory stage as much information as possible 
is gathered about the conimunity. This information would include social 
and cultural attributes of the community, history of past projects, 
activities presently occurring, some data on the physical resources of 
the community, and those problems that the people feel are most pressing. 

During the organizational stage the few really interested 
people hold many formal and informal discussions until they reach the 
point of committing themselves to work on a problem. This is usually 
a very small group referred to as the nucleus. After this nucleus has 
committed itself, the discussional stage is initiated. As many people 
as possible are involved in discussions of the problem. This is perhaps 
the most important single stage, for if the general community does not 
feel that they have had part in the decisions, they may not involve 
themselves actively in the project. Usually outside help is brought 
in to give technical advice, but final decisions must be left to 
the community. 

Action follows decision. In this stage people work on 
their o^-m ideas to successfully change and develop the community. With 
success comes self-confidence. If this stage is successful, the people 
are ready to go on to the next stage—developing new projects. Hopefully 
the community will develop a pattern for future problem solving which 
will build a strong community and, in turn, strong people.^

and Change , (New York: Macmillan Comipany, 1962), p. 441.

Community Development Among the Enoch Band 

How does the process of Community Development apply to the 
Enoch Band Vegetable Project? As mentioned in Chapter I, it was the 
efforts of the Family Service Bureau that stimulated the Indian Affairs 
Branch to begin looking for solutions to some of the problems on the 
Reserve. The organizational stage of Community Development followed 
initiation of interest by the Family Service Office, and subsequently 
meetings were held with Band members. The problems were evaluated 
(as listed in Chapter I), and the idea of the Vegetable Project emerged 
as a possible solution. 

Assistance was solicited at this point from the Department 
of Sociology at the University of Alberta. When the author discussed 
the Project with members of the Sociology Department, he found them 
to be favourable tcward the Project per se but felt that it was not 
being started in keeping X'/ith Community Developm.ent principles. One 
man mentioned that the priest involved might have backed the Project 
too enthusiastically and forced his viex-7s on Band members. The Band 
council spent a great deal of time individually trying to convince 
those not in favour of the Project of its x^orth, but no excess pressure 
was applied in these cases. 

Outside Assistance 

Also in the discussional stage, the Superintendent solicited 
help from the Dean of the Faculty of Agriculture at the University of 
Alberta. Since the project x>7as solely for the production of vegetables, 
the Dean turned the responsibility over to the Head of Horticulture 
Division. A coirmittee composed of four sub-committees Xvzith three 
members each xvas soon organized. The Committee X'/as named the Indian

Agricultural Projects Advisory Committee and was composed of the 
Production, Marketing, Processing, and Indian Affairs sub-committees. 

At this time there was confusion over the responsibilities of these 
groups. Moreover, up to the time of writing the members of the Indian 
Agricultural Projects Advisory Committee were not aware that the manager 
was responsible to them. A member of the Committee stated that the 
only reason a Committee had been formed was to give some prestige to the 
Superintendent’s recommendations by using the name of the University in 
the title of the Committee, ilhen told of their responsibility, another 
Committee member (on the Committee for two years) stated that he doubted 
whether any of the members would have agreed to sit on the Committee if 
they had known the responsibilities involved. 

Goals 

Though trie delineated responsibilities of the Advisory 
Committee have been subjected to varying interpretations, certain goals 
for the Project have been outlined in this group. First of all, the 
Vegetable Project should be a profitable scheme, supply work, and give 
people pride and self-confidence. It should supply work for older ment 
who cannot get work elsewhere. The Project should teach the Band members 
business methods and agriculture. Moreover, the Vegetable Project 
should help Band members acquire the habits necessary for integration 
into white society. Though this Project should provide work for all who 
wish to work, it should also become profitable by the third year. 

In the Community Uevelopm.ent process a final decision on 
what method of Community Developmient to use must be made before action 
is taken to implement the decision. At a general meeting the Band m_ade 
the decision to go ahead with the Vegetable Project. Soon after their

decision several informative papers appeared outlining the problem on 
the Reserve and stating the goals of the Vegetable Project. The 
following list states the goals as conveyed to the author by the various 
members of the Indian Affairs Branch staff: 


(1) 

The Vegetable Project will make, it possible for a person 
to learn to succeed in his own cultural environment on 
a competitive basis with a non-Indian community. 

(2) 

The Vegetable Project vzill provide gainful employment on 
the Reserve by projects capable of producing a profit to 
build a stable economy upon which a society can build a 
better way of life. 

(3) 

The Vegetable Project will develop an Indian system wage 
economy communal to stabilize Reserve society. 

(4) 

The Vegetable Project will develop sound work habits to 
make them better orientated to seek employm.ent off 
the Reserve. 

(5) 

The Vegetable Project will put money into Band funds and 
so stop wasteful sprees etc. of Band members. 

(6) 

The Vegetable Project will make better use of land resources. 

(7) 

The Vegetable Project will provide a sense of achievement 
and pride. 

(8) 

The Vegetable Project will make better use of the million 
dollars in Band funds. 

(9) 

The Vegetable Project will help Indian Affairs, charged 
with the responsibility of helping the Indians solve their 
problems of unstable vrork habits etc. It will change the 
cultural pattern so that Indian people Xvmll be effective 
workers with skills to sell. 

(10) 

The Vegetable Project will becom.e a profitable business 
by the third year.

One can see that the goals stated oy two groups deeply 

■7ith the Band Project are somewhat similar. A third group—■ 

The Farm 1

and make decisions on land allocation, crops to be planted, etc. It 
was to be made up of three farmers and two Band members . The m.embers 
of the Farm Trust were nominated by the Band and an election held which 
was open to all Band members. Members of the Farm. Trust felt that the 
goals of the Vegetable Project 'were (1) to teach money management; 

(2) to give the Indians work on a scheme that would at least break even; 

(3) to give them some way to constructively take part in V7hite society; 

(4) to teach the Band members hoTv to run an efficient operation, and 

(5) to employ all the x*Torkers anxious to work. 

The Band member’s goals, as conveyed to the author, vzere 
quite similar to those stated previously. 

(1) The Vegetable Project will teach us to handle our own affairs, 

(2) The Vegetable Project X'7ill make it easier for an individual 

•to get some of his share of money from Ottawa. 

(3) The Vegetable Project will allow us to take over our own land. 

(4) The Vegetable Project "will supply employment for Band members. 

(5) The Vegetable Project will allow us to invest our money in 

a wortli-while or profitable business. 

(6) The Vegetable Project will help bring about the im.provement 
that is needed in the com.munity. 

(7) The Vegetable Project will give us more power to get what 
we want from Ottawa. 

(8) The Vegetable Project will make us money. 

(9) The Vegetable Project Xv^ill become a profit m.aking business 
in th third year. 

Finally, the goals of the Project as seen by Mr. Green, the 
Manager and Supervisor of the Project, should be examined. (Mr, Green 
was hired on a three year service contract to manage and supervise the 
Project, rie was responsible to the Indian Agricultural Advisory Committe 
for technical direction and responsible to the Superintendent of the

Edmonton Indian Agency for administration direction.) He was to try to 
follow Community Development principles as closely as possible. The 
Project was to train people in good v/orking habits though some technical 
training was necessary too. The Project was to supply work for about 40 
to 50 people. It was to be a focus around which work could be started 
to build a better community. In the third year the Vegetable Project 
was to start showing a profit. Finally, the Vegetable Project was to 
develop a good crop rotation and management pattern which could be 
carried on by the Band members in the future.

CHAPTER IV 


ORGANIZATION, MANAGE^^ENT, AND WORKINGS OF 
THE VEGETABLE PROJECT 


Organization 


In early 1965 the Indian Affairs Branch advertised in 
Alberta for an Agricultural Project Manager. His duties were defined 
as undertaking the management and supervision under direction, of a 
new row crop project to be initiated in the spring of 1965. In the 
initial stages the Project was to involve the growing, harvesting, 
storing, and m.arketing of various root crops under the general guidance 
of the Indian Agricultural Project Committee. 

In a letter to the National Employment Service the following 
comments were made: 

The philosophy of the Project is that it takes six hours 
of labor to grow an acre of grain but 160 hours of labor 
to grow an acre of carrots. We are endeavoring to utilize 
the resources of our reserves to create employment for 
our Indian people within their own cultural environment and 
to develop sound work habits to make them better orientated 
to seek employment away from the reserve as the young 
generation grows older. 

It is expected that after the first or second year a trust 
will be formed vzhereby the trust will manage the lands and 
the larger trust will take over at least 2,000 acres of 
land for vegetable farming. The Project Supervisor can 
develop the Project and eventually have the largest 
vegetable growing Project in the Province. It is expected 
that withing three years if it is developed fast enough, 
the Project should warrant a salary of $10,000 plus 
commission depending upon the person’s ability. 

The funds will be unencumbered and placed in a separate 
trust account which the Project Supervisor can manage 
through the Secretary and Chief of the Band.

On June 13, 1965, two ].etters were written to the Project 
Supervisor. One letter which was the official contract, stated 
in part: 


1 am authorized to enter into a contract with you as 
Manager and Supervisor, under direction of the Indian 
Agricultural Project Committee. 

I understand the duties will include: 

1. Supervision of all field operations of potato 
vegetable and small fruits. 

2. Training of Indian labor to operate machinery and 
other phases of the work. 

3. Marketing of all produce on a profitable basis. 

4. Keeping of all records for audit and research purposes. 

I also understand this contract may be terrainated for just 
cause (e,g. unsatisfactory management of the Project 
according to the decision of the Advisory Committee), 

The second letter of June 15, 1965, states in part: 

It is understood that for all technical guidance you will 
refer to the Chairman of the Advisory Committee. It is 
further understood that for administrative details regarding 
handling of finance and rules with the Council you will be 
guided by the Superintendent of the Edmonton Agency. 

In addition to the above letters there were m.any verbal suggestions 

and promises from both parties regarding goals, plans, and rem.uneration 


for the future. 

A growing interest had developed as a result of the 
success of a trust on a nearby reserve. On November 22, 1965, 75 
percent of the Band electors signed a petition asking for a Farm Trust 
for the Vegetable Project. A Deed of Trust was drawn up similar to 
another which had passed. With a Council resolution asking that a Trust 
be set up 5 the two were sent to Ottawa in early April of 1966. At a 
meeting in February, 1966, an election by secret ballot had been held 


which selected five ment for the Farm Trust. Two of the men were Band m

and three were local farmers who were respected by the Band for their 
interest in the Reserve, and their ability as farmers. Although the 
Farm Trust had not been approved, it v/as assumed that it would be very 
shortl.y. By March 28, 1966, the Farm Trust Directors were making 
recommendations for acreages of each crop and deciding on miachinery 
and other farm problem.s V7hich had to be decided before spring work could 
be started. Up to the time of writing the Farm Trust has still not 
been passed, although the Farm Trust Directors scill meet. 

To understand some of the organizational difficulties of 
the Vegetable Project, Figure 2 is included. The general organization 
and managerial hierarchy of the Vegetabl.e Project is noted in this Figure 
In March 1966 the Advisory Committee defined the following roles (because 
it was generally accepted that Ottawa would pass the Farm Trust, the 
Farm Trust group was included in the definition). First of all, the 
Band Council was defined as the political body on the Reserve responsible 
for Reserve services; secondly, the Farm Trust was the body responsible 
for the management of farming operations; and finally, the Agency was 
to be the group responsible for liason between groups. 

One must go back to the summ.er of 1965 to see the beginning 
of the circular organizational system that evolved for the Vegetable 
Project. An election for Band Council was held in 1965. In June the 
Supervisor wrote that he was not happy with the fact that politics were 
entering into the Vegetable Project operation, for the result of the 
election had been a completely new Council, including a new Chief. The 
new Council knev: very little about the Vegetable Project and its operatic 
whereas the Chief and the Council who had been voted out had been the 
nucleus of the Vegetable Project. Thus there was no one group capable

of carrying on the Project in the manner first intended. Furthermore, 
one of the new Councillors was the Head Foreman of the Vegetable Project. 

It can be seen in Figure 2 that one man (starred) held _ 

three positions. The Assistant Manager of the Project also held positions 
on the Farm Trust and the Band Council. As Assistant Manager his attitudes 
and duties might tend to conflict with the attitudes and duties of a 
Councillor and member of the Farm Trust. Thus the Assistant Manager was 
in a very awkward position. As a member of the Council it was his duty 
to look after the welfare of the people. If they needed financial 
assistance, it was his duty to see that they received it. However, as 
Assistant Manager of the Vegetable Project, he had to try to make the 
operation as efficient as possible, hiring those who could do the most 
efficient job, regardless of their needs. The general feeling was that 
the Vegetable Project should supply work. Thus the usual course he took 
was to give work to anyone who wanted it. The second problem was even 
more difficult in some ways. As a member^of the Council he was to help 
direct the Supervisor regarding money matters. Although the contract 
states that this is to be a duty of the Chief and Band Secretary, it was 
always accepted as a duty of the Council as a whole. Since he was the 
Assistant Manager his opinion on matters regarding the Vegetable Project 
was usually accepted. This, in effect, made him his boss’s boss. In 
many instances the result was the creation of a bad working relationship, 
for neither the Supervisor nor Assistant Manager-Councillor knew who held 
the final authority or decision-making power. Also there was a growing 
resentment toward the Assistant Manager, because he exercised far more 
power than is usually given his position. Very little restraint could 

be used against him by anyone without drastic action resulting. —Even.s-o, 

generally _there seemed to be little dissatisfaction v/ith the Assistant<...Manager

Management 

The chronological approach used in this section, outlines 
some of the managerial situations that arose around the Vegetable 
Project. On May 17, 1965, the Supervisor of the Vegetable Project 
began work. This was an unfortunately late date to begin the Project, 
but most people felt that it was better to start late than to postpone 
the Project for a year. 

Supervisory Factors 

In addition to the Supervisor's duties outlined in his 
contract and subsequent letters, there were several other factors that 
he had to take into account. For instance, in April, 1965, the Indian 
Affairs Branch agreed to an incentive bonus of 10 percent of profits, 
divided on an hourly basis to all working in excess of 200 hours. More¬ 
over, the Supervisor understood that there were about 40 people who 
wanted to work; therefore, 106 acres of crops would supply them with 
sufficient work. However, he soon found that there were over 100 people 
who wished to work. There are two m.ain reasons for this excess of labor. 
The year 1965 was a very wet year and weeds were a greater problem 
than in most years; therefore, more people were needed to weed. A great 
deal of the work was being done by too many people. Jobs normally 
requring five people had ten or twelve working on them. Many children 

j 

were hired. During the fall eight-year-old children were receiving a 
dollar an hour for picking potatoes. 

Another new factor that the Supervisor had to consider 
after he had begun work was the problem of marketing the vegetables. 

The Indian Affairs Branch people had been assured that all vegetables 
grown could be marketed in Edmonton. The Supervisor, starting late, had

no time to check on the markets. Thus without marketing information the 

follov7ing acreages vzere seeded: 

Potatoes 75 acres 

Turnips 20 acres 

Carrots 3 acres 

Onions 3 acres 

Cabbage 5 acres 

Furthermore, there was no plan for a crop rotation system which is 
required on any long term vegetable project. Taking all these factors 
into consideration, the Supervisor increased the acreage to 350 acres. 
Therefore, because of the late start and increased acreage, some crops 
were planted abnormally late in 1965. 

Budget 

The original budget prepared by a member of the Advisory 
Committee was not sufficient due to the additional acres and excess of 
labor used. In September, 1965, an additional budget was prepared asking 
for $13,500. This new budget x^as passed, but by December of 1965 more 
money \<fas requested for the preparation of potatoes for sale. For this 
another $15,000 x-zas allocated. Thus questions arose about x^7here the 
money vzas going, box'/ the Project xvas to be operated, and hoxv-^ efficient 
was the management. Hoxvever, these questions x-zere sxvrept ax'zay in the 
enthusiasm, generated by the Christmas bonus. Though the Edmonton Agency 
had agreed to 10 percent of the profits based on the hours x-zcrked for 
anyone x-zorking over 200 hours, Xv^heri pressure xtas brought to bear on the 
Council and Supervisor, a bczius of 10 percent of wages was paid to all 
who had x-zorked over 100 hours . 

In spite of certain flax-zs in the Project from, the beginning 
Band m.e.mbers took an active interest in it. On the first day, for 
exarriple, the present Assistant Manager arrived looking for things that

needed to be done. On finding that a load of fertilizer was coming, 
he drove around and gathered a crew. This same willingness to do a job 
is still evident today. Furthermore, despite the problems of the first 
year a great deal of excitement was aroused about the Project, and the 
Band members continued to be enthusiastic about it. For example, on 
a suggestion of the Advisory Committee a weekly newsletter was published 
and mailed to all Band members during the summer. It proved to be quite 
successful, in that it kept many of the older people, not vzorking on the 
Project, up-to-date on Project and general Band news. 

The Project in 1966 

Acreage 

During the winter months Band members started planning for 
the next year. In December of 1965 a resolution was passed by the Band 
Council to the effect that "just potatoes be grovzn as that is all that 
makes m.oney." Acreage was not stated. In spite of earlier recommendations 
for consolidation and limited acreages the Advisory Committee made the 
following com.promise recommendation for 19661.

Again all acreage recommendations left out summerfallow. 

By March 1966 the members of the Co-op Farm, started in 
1965, had decided to quit. So on the first day of April the Vegetable 
Project was given the grain and hay' equipment belonging to the Co-op Farm 
and worth about $18,000.00. In addition, three sections of land set 
aside for the Farm Trust were to be figured into the operation and an 
additional one-half section was to be taken over from the Co-op Farm. 

Thus by the first of May the acreages had grown for the above reasons to: 


Oats 

245,0 

acres 

Barley 

270.0 

acres 

Turnips 

8.4 

acres 

Onions 

5.0

Carrots 

8.3 

acres 

Potato 

238.3 

acres 

Cabbage 

14.6

Raspberries 

4.4

Beans 

1.0 

acres 

Com 

12.0 

acres 

Summ.er fallow 

671.0 

acres 


Total 1,533.0 acres 

Concerning what to plant and how much, the Supervisor was 
in a seriously confused situation. His contract stated that he was 
responsible to the Advisory Committee and must take their advice. He 
expected that the Trust would be passed in the near future. He also 
expected to be responsible to the Farm Trust for production and have 
their guidance in the future. And in the spring of 1966 the Band Council, 
which controls the money for production, wanted to plant only potatoes.

Reports 


A member of the Advisory Committee v7rote a report near the 
end of January 1966 summarizing the activities of the first eight months 
of the Vegetable Project. The report is summed up as follows; 

The undertaking now appears to be a Project of dual nature: 

The first and most important aspect is one of attempting 
to inculcate habits of punctuality, responsibility, cooperation, 
sobriety, and an appreciation of industry and it’s rewards in 
the Indian workers. 

The second aspect is dependent to a considerable degree 
on the gradual attainment of the first and is the manage¬ 
ment of the Project in such a way as to make it economically 
successful as soon as possible. 

It appears to me that in the light of the large measure 
of education and training in the social attitudes, which 
must be acquired by the Indians, that the Vegetable Project 
is as much an educational undertaking as it is a business. 

The two objectives in the Project (a) training and 
employing as many workers as possible and (b) intent to 
realize a profit may not be compatible. These aspects are 
policy considerations which will have important economic 
consequences. 

Another report was forthcoming in April in which the same 
Advisory Committee member with the help of the Supervisor and Assistant 
Manager made a list of 29 items they felt had been influenced by the 
Vegetable Project, The report began: "The follox^7ing items are comments 
of a Council mem.ber and the Project Supervisor on Social and Educational 
improvements achieved in the operation of the Vegetable Project in 1965." 
Among the items listed were: (a) continuing to work a full day, (b) getting 
a job done, (c) working with each other, (d) understanding objectives, 

(e) realizing the need for team work. The list ended with this statement:

occasions non-Band members tried to send the letter to Ottawa but were 
turned down by the Band Council. 

Personnel 

The job of Foreman evolved as one of the most important in 
the Vegetable Project. Heavy losses were often caused when the Foreman 
was off the job. For examplej in 1966, 15 acres of potatoes were harrowed 
with the wrong type of harrow, and the area done was a complete loss. It 
was essential that the Foreman be on the job all the time because of the 
rapid turnover of workers. In 1965, 25.4 percent of the workers were 
new on the job each day. In 1966, 18.2 percent of the workers were new 
on the job each day. (To calculate this, it was assumed that if a person 
was off the job for three or more working days, he was new on the job.) 

The following comments sum up the feeling of many of the workers about 
their work situation. 

This is the best job I've ever been on, no one always on 
your neck when you slow dox-m; in fact, no one ever says 
anything. I can work for a couple of days then leave, come 
in a week or so and everything is fine. I can work vzhen- 
ever I want. 

The attitude of the Foreman was expressed in the following statement: 

"What are we supposed to be doing here, making money or supplying work; 
we can't do both." Since no one was in a position to give a definite 
answer and back it up, the Forem.an continued to allow more people to 
work than were needed. A frequent criticism of the Foreman was that he 
never told or showed anyone exactly how a job was to be done. The 
following conmient was typical: "The Foreman drives us out, points to a 
field, says you can start here, and drives off. We don't see anyone 
until five when someone picks us up."

Many people in the fields felt that the Foreman and Assistant 
Manager were taking advantage of their position. One particularly hot 
afternoon about 25 people hoeing in the field saw the Assistant Manager 
and the three top foremen playing horseshoes in the shade of the root 
cellar. All the men playing horseshoes had worked at least 12 hours 
that day; and while playing horseshoes, they were discussing the Vegetable 
Project. At least three major decisions were made regarding it during 
the game. The attitude grew throughout the summer that "the foreman 
are not working; why should we?" When the Vegetable Project vzas discussed 
with members of the Band working off the Reserve, all expressed favourable 
attitudes toward it, but most of them had one criticism here stated 
emphatically by one person: 

Do you know anything about these people [referring to band 
members in charge of the Project]. Some of them have never 
done a day’s work in their lives, and now all of a sudden 
they are important. The guys leading this have never been 
successful at anything in their lives but drinking and 
raising children. 

Bookkeeping 

During the 1965 season the Supervisor’s wife kept the books, 
working on an hourly basis. In 1966 the coding for the I.B.M. data 
processing of records was done by Band members. In 1965 it was impossible 
for anyone to check on any aspect of the Vegetable Project, because the 
books were in Edmonton at the accounting firm. In 1966, Project data 
were in unreliable I.B.M. Data Processing records and equally inaccessible. 
This inaccessibility of books presented a serious problem in the summer 
of 1966 for many workers. The auditor had most, if not all of the books 
for 1965 from the second week in May 1966 until January 2, 1967. During 
the summer the auditor revised the books using an I.B.M. computer.

There were many coding mistakes and other errors up to the time of 
writing, and no figure in the monthly reports is considered reliable 
unless it is checked against original bills or receipts. Presently, 
several Band members are learning to code for the I.B.M. Data Processing 
records and hopefully will be quite efficient in a few months. 

Trucks and Transportation 

Another continuing problem was the lack of men with drivers 
licenses. Often no one with a license was available to drive. Highway 
Number 60 runs the entire width of the Reserve and is the only road that 
can be used to get to many fields. Therefore, both the Supervisor and 
the Assistant Manager often spent time doing small jobs that involved 
driving time which could have been used much more productively. 

During the 1966 crop season the Vegetable Project had four 
tractors and two trucks—two of the tractors had 50 horsepower gas 
engines; the other two tractors had diesel engines of about 90 horse¬ 
power. The two trucks, a one-half ton and a three and one-half ton had 
gasoline engines. Tne approximate gas consumption is given below: 

Gas 10,718 gallons, 

Diesel Fuel 8,332 gallons. 

Host Band members accepted the fact that a lot of gas was stolen. Band 
members stated, "if it was my gas, I’d sure catch them." A great deal 
of mileage was recorded for the half-ton truck due to the heavy use of 
the truck for personal business. The truck was being used to such an 
extent that the Band Council finally passed a resolution giving authority 
for the trucks to the Supervisor and stating that they were only to be 


used at his discretion.

Harvest 

By harvest the Vegetable Project was in a very disorganized 
state of affairs. Cabbages which had been ordered were not picked because 
the workers complained about getting wet and cold. However, at the same 
time other workers rode the potato harvester during 20 m.p.h. winds, 
it soon became apparent that the potatoes would not be harvested unless 
outside help was solicited. A member of the Farm Trust harvested 115 
acres of potatoes for less than ^thre actual cost. The grain harvest was 
going so slowly that after their own work was done several farmers came 
to assist in harvesting the grain. About one acre of carrots were left 
on the ground, and only a few of the turnips were harvested. Money was 
running out quickly, but still no notification about the Farm Trust was 
forthcoming. '^‘Then officials from Ottawa were asked why the Trust had 
not been approved, they seemed to be surprised that it had not been 
approved. They also said that as soon as they got back to Ottawa they 
would find out why it had not been approved. At the time of writing 
however. Band Council had stiJ.l heard nothing officially about the 
Farm Trust. 

With the pressure of no money, slow harvesting operations, 
and unfulfilled promises from Ottawa, the Supervisor began to write 
abusive letters to anyone who might be able to accomplish something if 
goaded enough. Complaints and adverse opinions were legion. A m.an 
working on the Project stated, "this Vegetable Project will go on as long 
as there is money in Ottav/a. llie day the money goes, that is the end 
of the Project." Another Vegetable Project worker stated that the Project 
will continue "until we can find some better way to get our money from 
Ottawa." Another person com.plaining about the Project asked, "if you had

money in the bank, and when you wanted to get some out, the banker told 
you that you had to hoe potatoes for one hour to get one dollar, would 
you be very happy?" Thus among some Band members there was little 
optimism concerning the future or the success of the Vegetable Project 
due to the many organizational and managerial problems encountered. 



CHAPTER V 


ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF THE VEGETABLE PROJECT 

In any fanning operation it is important to know where the 
money is going and what the returns are on the money spent. In this 
Chapter the author hopes to show where the money went and how the 
expenses of the Project compare with the expenses of the farmers in 
adjacent areas. Throughout this Chapter comparisons will be made, 
using portions of a study done by E.E.R. King.^ In King’s study, 
potato farms in the Edmonton area were divided into three groups according 
to the number of acres of potatoes they grew. The second size category 
in King’s study, lOl-lSO acres, was used as a comparison with the 1965 
crop on the Reserve and the third size category of 151-350 acres was 
used in the 1966 crop analysis. 

Analysis for the two crop years has not been done on a 
twelve month basis. All tables and figures for 1965 include data from 
May 1st, 1965 to March 31st, 1966. All analysis sho^ra for 1966 is from 
data for the period April 1st to November 30th. Most of the 1966 crop 
was still to be sold which would, in fact, increase costs, particularly 
labor for that crop year. In this Chapter labor is analyzed separately 
because it appears so much higher than for other comparable operations.

Commercial Potato Production in Alberta," (Edmonton: Economics Branch, 
Canada Department of A.griculture, 1966).

Land Use 

Table 4 shows the land use of potato farmers around Edmonton 
as compared to that of the Vegetable Project. (Note that in 1966 size 
of the Vegetable Project moved to a different category in King’s 
study.) There was initially a large acreage which had to be fallowed, 
due to the weed infestation, this creating an extra expense for the 
Project. In Table 4 yield per acre comparisons cannot be given too 
much weight because 1962 was not a good year for potato growing, with 
yields being somewhat below the long time average. On the other hand 
1965 and 1966 viere very good years. 

Com.parison With Other Potato Farms 

To give a general picture of how the Vegetable Project 
compared with other potato fams in the Edmonton area, Table 5 has been 
included. Land has been valued at $100 per acre in both cases, for 
purposes of comparision. Because the Vegetable Project took over land 
which had been in grain, a great deal more land had to be sum.merfallowed 
than would be the practice after the Vegetable Project initiates a 
regular crop rotation. It is quite possible that sum.merfallow will be 
excluded from the crop rotation once the weed problem is brought under 
control. Table 5 shov-7s the capital cost of the only building constructed 
for the Vegetable Project, a root cellar. In the beginning of the 
Project plans w^ere made to grow many vegetables requiring excellent 
storage conditions. The root cellar presently used only for potatoes 
cost $72,940.00, while farmers having an equal acreage of potatoes have only 
$13,719 invested in potato storage.’^ During the summer of 1966 v.^hen

the root cellar was to be finished, there was considerable discussion 
about putting in refrigeration and a humidifier unit. Because labor had 
taken so much more of the budget than had been estimated, it was felt 
by most that the Band could not afford the expense. Furthermore, there 
was a growing feeling among many of the Band members that vegetables, 
other than potatoes, did not pay and that no more money should be spent 
on storage facilities for them. Thus the Vegetable Project now has 
very good, but overly expensive, potato storage facilities which at the 
same time is an inadequate vegetable storage building. It should, there¬ 
fore, be noted that the tremiCndous difference in actual cost of buildings 
for potato storage distorts the rest of the percentage comparisions in 
Table 5. 

Investment in Equipment 

Table 6 supplies information on capital investment in 
equipment for 1965 and 1966. Because King's study was done in 1962, 
one can assume that many of the input costs have increased since then. 
However, it is not the purpose of this study to make direct comparisons 
between prices paid in King's study and those paid for Band equipment 
but rather to show relative expenditures for various inputs. 

There are several factors to keep in mind while studying 
Table 6. First of all, the Project was initiated in 1965; therefore, 
all equipm.ent had to be purchased at that time. The farmers in King's 
study had acquired their machinery over a period of years; thus many 
had som.e older machinery in operation which tended to lower the stated 
capital investm.ent in equipment. In one year (1965 to 1966) the 
Vegetable Project increased its acreage by 438 percent. A grain crop 
was added in 1966, a fact which further complicates the comparison. More

machinery was purchased, and some was taken over from, the Co-op farm to 
service the larger acreage. Considering the rapid grov;th of the 
Vegetable Project, the am.ount and cost of machinery seems to be about 
the same as that of the local potato farmers. 

Most farms build up their equipment over time as they can 
afford to purchase additional machinery. Gradual acquisition of 
machinery is advantageous for the larger farm.er who must buy new equipment 
because no second hand equipment is available of the necessary size. Out 
of the $21,139 for 1966, the Vegetable Project took over $17,300 worth of 
equipment, only one year old and in very good condition, for the Co-op 
farm. The large tractor, for example, had only 500 hours of use. This 
m.achinery is therefore, as good as new, and if considered on that basis, 
there is only $3,839.00 or 6 percent of used equipment in potato production 
on the Project instead of the 34 percent listed in Table 7.

Labor Costs 1965 

Labor constituted one of the highest expenditures in the 
cost analysis. Table 8A gives a breakdown of the labor costs for each 
crop in 1965. The 1965 costs run from May 1965 to March 31, 1966. In 
1965 very few records were kept of the work done on a daily basis. As 
a result, a fine breakdown in Table 8A is impossible. A record was 
kept of the hours a person worked each week. Using the hourly rate 
(which varied according to the job), the Foreman’s memory, the field 
notes, and the Supervisor’s diary and notes, an appraisal was made to 
determine what each person was doing each day. The costs of bookkeeping 
are included in management labor costs. The 1965 labor costs included 
the costs incurred in 1966 for processing and selling the 1965 crop. 

Operating Costs 1965 

Table 8B shows the operating costs in 1965. Some of the 
vegetable seed purchased in 1965 was carried over to 1966 so this cost 
is actually less than shown in the Project books for 1965. Unfortunately, 
fuel and lubricant bills were, and still are, in a state of confusion. 
Because this is a government backed Project, fuel is purchased tax free. 

At first the records had to go through the Indian Affairs Branch. Bills 
for gajs purchased in January 1966 were still not available in December 1966 
after the study had been completed. Therefore, fuel and lubricant costs 
are based on fuel delivered, not on bills received. During the winter 
and early spring, nearly all the tools were stolen so all tools have 
been written off as an expense for the year purchased. Utility expenses 
were high during 1965 due to the construction of the root cellar. Work 
was often carried on into the night in an attempt to finish before 
winter. The interest charge on working capital has been appraised at

five percent per annum. This is the rate of interest that the Indian 
Affairs Branch pays the Band for Band funds in trust. The acreage 
rental had to be paid to Band members who had Certificates of Possession. 

In Table 8C v/hich shows the fixed costs for 1965, interest was also 
charged at 5 percent per annum. 

Labor and Operating Costs 1966 

Tables 9A, 9B, and 9C give similar information for 1966. 

For example, Table 9A gives the labor costs for each crop in 1966 from 
April the first to November 30, and Table 9B shox'/s operating costs 
for 1966. 

Before the start of the 1966 season a time clock was purchased. 
Also each worker was asked to record x-zhat he did each day. Occasionally 
the Supervisor or Foreiman x^7ould enforce this nex-z rule, but usually it 
was left up to the individual. There X'zas a very good response, and it 
was relatively easy to assign labor costs to the crop (except for a fexz 
individuals X'Zho did not specify adequately) . This problem was solved 
by x^-'orking Xv^ith the Forem.an on the assignment of costs. The supervision, 
janitorial, office, and car alloX'Zances have all been divided on the basis 
of direct productive labor spent per crop. The rox-z indicating tractor 
labor costs is not all inclusive because there are some tractor hours 
used in broadcasting fertilizer, seeding, cultivating, spraying, harvesting, 
and summerf allcx-zing. It Xs^as felt that this further classification of costs 
x^zould give a more complete accounting of expenditures. 

The amount shox'zn for seed preparation included expenses 
incurred before April 1. The very high cost of seed preparation for 
potatoes resulted from the large number of people xvorking in the root 
cellar in the early spring and the fact that a great m.any of the potatoes 
were partially rotten.

In Table 9B which lists operating costs for 1966, the cost 
of purple gas is slightly inflated because the Band road grader used gas 
bought for the Vegetable Project. However, this amount is insignificant 
when compared to the amount stolen. No change has been made to allow 
for the amount used by the grader. Again in 1966 acreage rental and 
crop share expenses were necessary because the Vegetable Project used 
land on which Band members have Certificates of Possession. Also the 
Band Council decided in some cases that the person living on the land 
should have a share of the crop. In 1966 a Band member was paid $11 
per acre for all his land on which vegetables or potatoes were grown. 

On grain land they received one third of the crop, and on land which 
was summerfallov7ed, $3.00 per acre was paid against next years crop. 

Included under hay expenses is the cost of baling some straw, an 
estimated 9,800 bales. Some of these bales were stolen from the field. 

The bales of straw that were sold are included under hay income. The 
interest on working capital is again charged at five percent. Table 9C 
shows the fixed costs for 1966. Here the interest on fixed capital is 
also charged at five percent. The Trustees fee’s are included under 
fixed costs because they are to be a permanent part of the Vegetable Project. 

Costs Per Acre and Per Ton 

Table 10 gives a comparison of the average cost per acre 
of producing potatoes for the Vegetable Project and the surrounding 
farmers. This table shows the tremendous decrease in cost per acre 
which took place in one year. The single biggest contributor to this 
decrease in cost was labor expenses which dropped from $264.21 to $71.78 
per acre. This is still about $30.00 per acre more than the labor costs 
for the surrounding farmers. Another important cut in costs resulted

from the fact that in the second year the Vegetalbe Project was able 
to use its own seed. Fixed costs were reduced to half their previous 
amount due to the increase in acreage. Although there has been a great 
decrease in cost per acre, costs must be pushed lower still if the 
Vegetable Project is to succeed. In comparison with the local potato 
farmers the Vegetable Project still spends over $50.00 an acre more 
in potato production. 

In Table 11 the average cost per acre per farm of producing 
potatoes on a percentage basis is given. The single m.ost striking 
feature about this table is that in 1965, 48 percent of the total cost 
of producing an acre of potatoes went to labor. This is nearly 250 
percent higher than for the local potato farmers of equal size. The 
tremendous difference in labor distorts the whole table for that year. 
By 1966 the difference in labor used between farmers and Vegetable 
Project w^as only 75 percent. Fuel and lubricant costs per acre went 
up 115 percent because the trucks were driven for private use and a 
large quantity of gas and oil was stolen in 1966. 

The average cost per ton of producing potatoes is sho\'7n 
in Table 12. The average yield in King’s study was 6.2 tons per acre. 
In 1965 the Vegetable Project averaged 7.5 tons per acre. In 1966 the 
Project averaged only 3.1 tons per acre. Despite this ver^y low yield 
the Vegetable Project decreased their cost per ton by nearly $7.00. 

If the yield had been normal, about 6.2 tons per acre, the Vegetable 
Project would have lowered costs to about $33.00 per ton. Had this 
yield been obtained, however, storage space would have been inadequate.

Yields 

Acreages and yields for 1965 and 1966 are shown in Table 13. 
In 1966 all yields except grain were below average, thus losses resulted 
even though cost per acre had been reduced. The extremely low yield 
of turnips and carrots was the result of not harvesting all the 
vegetables because immediate markets were lacking and a shortage of 
storage space was anticipated. The grain yields were quite good. 

Income and Expenses 1965 and 1966 

A statement of income and expenses for 1965 is given in 
Table 14. In this table the cost of summ.erfallow was separated from 
the other crops. Summerfallow is an investment for future crops. The 
loss per acre on all crops is due to extremely high labor costs and•the 
fact that the crops were not marketed and in some cases (turnips and 
carrots) were not even harvested. Corn did not yield any crop because 
it was planted too late. In 1965 the actual cash loss was $43,162.95. 
Table 15 gives a statem.ent of income and expenses for 1966. In Table 15 
summerfallow and raspberries have been separated from other costs, but 
not losses, because they both are investments for future years. In 1966 
the actual cash loss was $42,357.42. However, this analysis only goes 
to November 30, 1966, and most of the crop is still to be sold. Unless 
the labor efficiency increases, there will be a further loss; the cost 
of preparing the portatoes for sale X'/ill be more than the price received 
for them. The loss for the 1966 crop may approach $75,000.00. 

Labor Efficiency 

Since labor accounts for such a large part of the costs, 

Table 16 has been included to shoX'Z how the labor was used. Table 16

shows labor efficiency for 1965 and 1966. The Productive Man Work 
Units (PJ-MU) are shown for each crop. The Man Equivalents (ME) are 
based on one worker or equivalent for ten hours per day, five days a 
week for a year. Although there may be some disagreement over these 
values, they were used for both years; thus the comparison between 
years is meaningful. Labor efficiency increased 273 percent in one 
year. This increase brings the Vegetable Project up to about one- 
half the labor efficiency normally expected. 

The Vegetable Project has lost money for two years and will 
continue to lose money until labor expense and the management of labor 
can be brought under control. Because of the losses incurred and the 
reasons for these losses the author does not feel that there is nay 
need to do a more detailed analysis. Management and organization are 
now the limiting factors. Although the Vegetable Project shows up 
very poorly in an economic analysis, the author does not feel that the 
basic problems are economic. The physical facilities are all available 
for a profitable business. It is a social problem which results in the 
very low labor efficiency and the problems of labor management. The 
marketing of the produce has been the other main factor which has 
caused losses. This again is partly due to management’s time being 
taken up with labor problems when tim.e should have been spent 
developing markets. 

Although the Vegetable Project is still losing money, there 
has been a tremendous increase in efficiency in only one year. LTiether 
this increase can be continued depends to a large extent on wTiat type 
of backing the Band members get from the various groups who are supposed 
to be supporting the Project.

CHAPTER VI 


EVALUATION, CONCLUSION, AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
Areas of Change 

In previous Chapters the author has stated the situation on 
the Reserve prior to 1965 and many of the problems necessitating a 
Community Development approach. A few areas in which change has taken 
place might be mentioned here in order to evaluate the progress that has 
been made with the Reserve’s Community Development attempt—the Vegetable 
Project. 

Government Wards and Welfare 

A large proportion of the Reserve children are wards of 
the government. The percentage of the population who were wards of the 
government in 1964 and 1965—12 percent—was much higher than the 
provincial figure of 0.4 percent of the total population. In 1964 
and 1965 the Federal Government spenc $24,000 on 48 children from the 
Enoch Band v7ho were temporary and permanent wards of the government. 

By 1966 these figures had dropped to $16,800 paid for 28 children, and 
much of this money was distributed for children xvho had been made 
permanent wards of the government previous to 1966. The percentage of 
the population listed as wards of the government dropped to 6.6 percent 
in about one and one-half years. It would appear that there is a 
correlation between the fact that the Vegetable Project supplies work on 
the Reserve, thus keeping men with their families and decreasing the 
percentage of children who are wards of the government. Families seem

far more stable now that raen on the Reserve do not have to leave the 
Reserve in search of work. 

Many mem.bers of the Band previously on v/elfare no longer 
have to solicit help from the Council at meetings. During the summer 
of 1966 the only people receiving welfare were mothers unable to work, 
older people, or people with physical handicaps. Before the Vegetable 
Project m*any homes on the Reserve seemed to be moving toward female 
dom.ination. Usually the women decided how the cheques were to be spent; 
the man had little to do with management when he was out of work except 
to sign the cheque. The children had little respect for their fathers, 
and alcohol was used to solve the problem of idleness. When a man 
worked on tUe Vegetable Project to support his family, a sense of pride 
was generated. Thus it seems one of the goals of the Project, generating 
self-confidence, is being achieved. 

Participation in the Project 

In any Community Developm.ent scheme participation is an 
important criteria for success. Out of a total of 146 people on the 
voters list in 1966, there were at least 101 who had worked on the 
Project. Many of those who did not work on the Project v/ere women 
with young children at home or elderly people. At least 210 Band mem.bers 
worked on the Project in either 1965 or 1966. No one was forced to 
work. For some people the Vegetable Project supplied year-round work. 

When com.pared with the national figure wnnere 10 percent of the Indian people 
of Canada work year round, the Vegetable Project has a good record.^

Today," (Otcawa: 1964), p. 9.

Training 

Though it is true that the Project has lost money, one must 
consider what has been gained from that loss. The Band members have 
gained some self-confidence; they have the feeling that they can do 
and will do a good job in the future. Compared to the cost of retraining 
programs—each student receives $200 per month plus an additional $80 
per month to a married man with dependents who has to move to take a 
training course and $10 a m.onth tuition fee—the losses of the Vegetable 
Project are minimal. Five men held management positions for a year; 
this training can be estimated to be worth $17,400. Since these people 
did not receive adequate training as children (the Governm.ental policy 
in force when the Band’s adults v/ere in school stated that no Indian 
child over 12 or 14 needed academic education), society must be prepared 
to pay more to train adults. 

General Evaluation 

General Procedures Associated With The Project 

Technical aid —The proper procedures were used to interest 
people in the Project-~the discussional stage of Commiunity Development 
was satisfied--but insufficient technical background work was done. 

For example, the Project’s first year began too late in the spring. The 
problem of marketing v/as not studied sufficiently. It was taken for 
granted that because vegetables had to be imported into Edmionton, the 
market for them was unlimited. Because of bad experiences with other 
vegetable growers in the area m.ost buyers are reluctant to tie themselves 
to any one producer. Most growers are not large enough to assure buyers

the market by large supermarket chainsthere is little chance, lor the. 
small grovrer with an unstandardized product. As a result of the bad 
showing of the Vegetable Project in 1966 it is doubtful that any buyer 
would be willing to commit himself to buying Vegetable Project produce 
entirely, in the near future. 

Another area in which technical counsel was warranted and 
not received was in the area of storage. Vegetables harvested in 1966 
that could not be sold immediately because of the inavailability of 
markets were either stored or left in the fields. The space in the 
root celj.ar was inadequate and unsatisfactory for any of the vegetables 
except cabbage (vzhich is holding up well at the tim.e of writing) . "Good 
storage of carrots [and other vegetables] for the fresh market has not 
yet been achieved by m.any growers."^' This is the case with the Vegetable 
Project. No refrigeration was installed in the root cellar so it w^as 
impossible to control the temperature especially during the few warm 
days in the fall. Especially in the case of hand picked vegetables 
such as carrots and onions it was cheaper in 1966 to leave them in 
the fields than to allow them to decay in the root cellar since no 
markets were available. If vegetables are to be grown next year on a 
commercial basis, refrigeration must be installed in the root cellar, 
unless a m.arket can be found ahead of tim.e and the management is sure 
that they can deliver the vegetables on time and in the proper quantity 
and quality.

' Land use —It is obvious from a study of land resources of 
the Enoch Band that if the Indian Affairs Branch wishes to maximize 
returns at the present time, the only policy to follow is to rent the 
land to non-Indian fa'^mtir^ fur potato and other vegetable production. 
However, the best long run use of the land for Band members would be 
to farm it themselves, at least to use it and manage it themselves. 

For instance, to maximize returns in the long run from the Reserve land, 
the Reserve should continue to lease the rifle range to the government. 

On the other hand, the lease on Tomahawk Park should be renegotiated with 
another group showing more interest in recreational development. The 
Band might use some of its money to help finance a new organization 
wishing to develop Tomahawk Park, for the present Company does not seem 
to be seriously interested in the Park. The lease would be no problem since 
the lessee has not fulfilled his agreement. Though it is not likely that 
Band members could manage the Park since it is a special skill, some 
members, if interested, might get jobs in the Park and learn the business. 
From the point of view of development of human resources on the Reserve, 
all the land should be farmed, administered, and managed by mxembers of 
the Band as quickly as feasible. Therefore, from this point of view 
it is essential that the Vegetable Project continue and that Band 
members be given more responsibility for it. 

Organizational and Managerial Procedures 

Not until June 28, 1966, were the responsibilities of the 
various positions associated with the Vegetable Project generally made 
kno\m. These responsibilities were outlined by the Band Council, the 
body that according to the plan mapped out by the Superintendent and

Advisory Committee was to have no voice in the management of the Project, 
except to allocate money. However, the Council felt tPiat some general 
guide was necessary for those holding managerial positions in the 
Project. The fact that there had been no such guide previous to 1966 
was a serious organizational flaw. 

The management of the Project needs a complete reevaluation 
and change if the Vegetable Project is to continue. Poor management has 
caused a loss of money, ill will, and dissatisfaction among Band members, 
and has left the Project vzithout a strong organization on which it can 
rely. Certain parts of the present organization should be studied. It 
is important to look at the work of the Band Council, the Superintendent, 
and the Supervisor, for they are all important m.embers of the managerial 
hierarchy. Since the Band Council Xv^as the nucleus, the center of any 
Comm,unity Development Project, it x^7ill be studied first. 

Th e Band Council —-The Band Council in office at the time of 
the first consideration of the Vegetable Project had a very close x^7orking 
relationship whth the Agency Superintendent. Informal discussions were 
held, and a significant rapport existed betxv^een them. Some members of 
the old Council have described long and often heated discussion that took 
place while trying to decide x-7hat x^7ould be the best for the Band. Hox'7ever, 
after the election of June 1965 a nexc Council took office» Not one of 
the old Council miern.bers regained his seat. The new Council did not have 
the background of discussions and decisions on the Vegetable Project, 
thus they felt that they should move X7ith caution. On three occations 
the high cost of labor made additional funds necessary because the budget 
had been spent. The support of the nexc Band Council was not quite as 
enthusiastic as that of the old Council.

The Superintendent— -At the same time as the change in the 
Band Council there was a change in Superintendents. The Superintendent 
who had supplied the backing for the decisions of the old Council was 
transferred. Though the acting Superintendent gave the Project official 
support, he differed greatly in personality from the previous Super¬ 
intendent often referred to as a promoter. From the time of his arrival 
the new Superintendent brought with him the idea of slowing the Project 
down to take a second look at it. During his first several months in 
office he made several unfortunate statements to Band members. He told 
one of the Band members that "there must have been a madman running this 
place before I arrived." Since there was a strong feeling of goodwill 
towards the previous Superintendent, this statement caused many to believe 
that he had been sent out from. Ottawa to stop the Project. Also his 
suggestions that the grox^7th of the Project should be slowed dov/n until 
the people were sure of what they wanted only aggravated the situation 
although the author believes he was correct. 

At this point a slight aside, to look at Agency relations with 
the Band would be valuable. The change in Superintendents was mentioned 
above; but the constant relationship of The Indian Affairs Branch Agency 
and its members V7ith the Enoch Band has not been mentioned. Specifically 
concerning the Vegetable Project, several official meetings were held to 
discuss it with Band members and Agency staff present. In these form.al 
meetings only previously discussed ideas — those carefully thouglit out 
and prepared—were brought up. There is very little timie for busy staff 
members to sit around and discuss matters conversationally with the 
Band members, and informal discussions are the only way to encourage Band 
members to express themselv^es openly. The acting Superintendent has lived

on the Reserve for 13 years, but his time is so taken up with official 
matters that he has little time to discuss matters with Band members on 
a friendly basis. Over the years he has come to know the people on a 
personal basis, but the advantages which could have accrued to his 
position and his work as a receptive listener have largely been ruled out 
by the pressure of other work. Band members must try to catch him on 
Tuesday when he comes out to Council meetings or go into the Agency office 
in Edmonton. At the Agency office, the author noted, it seems as though 
anyone would stop working to help Band members. The type of relationship 
between Band mem.bers and Agency personnel that many of the people in 
Indian Affairs desire still does not exist. A Band member may come in 
to know if he can do something or to learn vzhat the regulations are 
concerning some proposed scheme. He is accustomed to being told that 
there is nothing that Agency office can do; he must wait until they 
receive word from Ottawa. This happens so often that it makes the Agency 
office appear to be only a forewarding post for Ottawa. Many of the 
people in the Agency office seemed to be tired of sending everything to 
Ottawa and waiting months for an answer. 

The Supervisor and general supervision —l^Jhen considering the 
work of the Supervisor, there are several factors which should be kept 
in mi.nd. The general duties of a Supervisor are usually considered to 
include: planning, organizing, controlling, comm.unieating, delegating 
authority, accepting responsibility. In his contract the Supervisor 
agreed to supervise the growing of potatoes, vegetables, and small 
fruits. At no time was any mention made of grain or hay. In 1966 there 
were 535 acres of grain to be supervised and 55 acres of hay. He took 
this acreage on in the interest of the people and the Project in the

belief that the Farm Trust would be soon forthcoming. It is most 
unfortunate that the Farm Trust did not come through, for the 
Supervisor was unable to manage the total operation in a desirable 
manner because of the great number of duties he had to perform. 

A second duty outlined in the contract stated that he was 
to train Indian labor to operate machinery and other phases of the work. 

The first part of this duty was easily accomplished because many of the 
men had worked on their own for local farmers and were familiar with 
machinery operation. If his work was to include training Band members 
in management and organization of the Vegetable Project, this aspect of 
the contract constituted a monumental undertaking. Vegetable production 
is a veiy difficult type of fanning in which only the very best managers 
can compete. The training of a good manager cannot be accomplished in 
a few years by even the most interested and well educated people. 

Moreover, because the Supervisor follov/ed certain southern Alberta 
practices, a feeling grev7 up among some of the people that he did not 
know how to grow vegetables. Some of his practices differed from, those 
of local farmers, and these ideas were questioned. Because Band mem.bers 
had been told for many years that their ideas were not as good as the 
ideas of non-Indians, they often did not bring their suggestions out 
in the open. 

The third duty stated was the marketing of all the produce 
on a profitable basis. This duty was one of the biggest problems. Quite 
often the cost of preparing the produce for sale was more than it w^ould 
bring in the market due to the extrem.ely high cost of labor in all operations. 
For example, the cost of harvesting $3.16 worth of beans in 1966 was 
extremely high. A vegetable buyer must be able to rely upon the prompt 
delivery of vegetables, and the Vegetable Project has been unreliable

because of the uncertainty of labor. Until labor can be efficiently 
managed it will be impossible to develop a profitabJ.e enterprise. 

The last duty outlined in the contract was to keep all 
records for audit and research purposes. Because of the number of 
different enterprises that the Supervisor had to control in the last year, 
he was not able to keep a set of books which allowed him to analyze the 
business. It was almost impossible for any of the Band members to work 
on the books because the auditor had them most of the time. The auditor 
kept the previous year’s books that the Band members might have used to 
cTieck to learn hov: things had been done. Many tim.es the men in charge 
were not on the job, and others had to fill in and make decisions. 

Moreover, since they did not keep records as they went along, there were 
not accurate field records with which to compare bookkeeping entries. 

Field records are a necessity for an efficient farming operation. 

The Supervisor has undertaken a very large and difficult job. 

He has allowed the Project to grow" too rapidly and, as a result, has not 
been able to give the supervision w"hich "A"as required. The job is made 
doubly difficult because he has to take directions from, so many people. 

He x^as in the im.possible position of having as one of his chief advisors 
his Assistant Manager. This should not contunue for another year. In 
the coning year the Supervisor "aiH have to take a firm hold on the Project 
and keep it Xv"ithin an easily controllable size. Perhaps different 
management arrangements might facilitate a more efficient utilization 
of labor. At the present time a great m.any people on the Reserve are 
dissatisfied 'with the Supervisor because of the losses incurred in both 
years of operation. He 'will be x-Jorking un'der the handicap of this 
general attitude in the coming year.

Supervision is an area in which inefficiency and laxness 
are most obvious. The consequences of a lack of supervision can be 
readily noticed. Organizing work and supervising it is a very difficult 
job in any organization, but it is especially difficult when it is tried 
for the first time. The Vegetable Project, a relatively new innovation, 
attempted to include all Band members, some of whom had not worked for 
three or four years. Because they had been idle, they had lost good 
working habits and the ability to function within an organization. The 
Indian community was, in years past, one of the most highly structured 
societies, each member having a function which required him to take part 
in the society. However, since this has not been the case for some years, 
organization and supervision will take more time and skill to develop 
good working habits. 

Furthermore, in farming it is more difficult to carry out 
plans just as they are outlined than it is in other businesses. In the 
case of the Vegetable Project it is even more difficult due to the 
lack of knowledge of methods to be used and the lack of a work plan. 

Discipline was often quite lax on the Project. Drinking 
was a serious problem and cost the Project a great deal of money. 

Hov/ever, since no disciplinary action was taken against those drinking 
on the job, the problem became even more extensive than usual and obviously 
more pronounced than if firm accion had been taken to stop it. Effective 
control and discipline were lacking in other aspects of the Project too. 
Workers knew that they would not be fired and seldom even reprimanded; 
thus bad work habits were built up. Since the Foreman mght be absent 
for days, the bad work habits were allowed to grow. For example, the 
discipline of time mieant little to Band members working on the Project.

They did not fully accept their responsibilities to the clock; working 
hours were not respected. A time clock, the result of a Band member’s 
suggestion, made the workers aware that they had to be at work on time 
and remain at work until a certain hour or the time they had taken off 
would show up in their pay cheques. 

Since part of the scheme was to teach members of the Band’s 
good managerial practices, one would expect that some sort of a work 
plan would have been drawn up stating the work to be done and a date for 
its completion if the crops were to be a success. But such a plan to 
aid supervising work was not drawn up. Very sketchy ideas were set out 
verbally instead. Unfortunately, as mentioned before, a great m.any 
people had a voice in decision making for the Project. Each committee 
drew up a prospectus for the number of acres to be seeded, gave it to the 
manager, and expected him to carry out their wishes. One essential 
requirement for success on a project such as this one is that the people 
doing the work be given some authority in planning the operation and in 
deciding in what order things will be done. The Band members feel that 
the Project is theirs, but they feel that they were not given enough say 
in planning it after it was first started. People on the Reserve found 
it difficult to believe that people who had never been on the Reserve 
could make recommendations concerning what should, be grouni and in what 
quantity. Many Band members felt that the Advisory Committee resembled 
the people in Ottawa and slowly a feeling of ill will built up against 
Commi11 e e memb e rs. 

To return to the problem of the lack of a work plan and 
supervision, the following example shows the chaos created by the lack 
of planning, supervision, and instruction. Some Band women were sent

out to hoe carrots. A few of the older v 7 omen who had worked on other 
farms knew that they had to thin the carrots as they worked along the 
rows. Most of the younger people had no idea that this had to be done, 
hhien a Toreman came out to the field and saw that some of the women were 
behind the rest, he thought that they had been visiting instead of 
working and reprimanded the older Xizomen. When the older women explained 
why they were behind, the Foreman said that he had not been told about 
thinning the carrots. As a result, those thinning the carrots quit. 

As is obvious from this example there were no distinct lines 
of authority within the ^Vegetable Project. Band members in postions of 
Tesponsibility scon became middlemen, for there was no one to whom they 
could turn to back up their decisons. As field foremen they would give 
an order, .and it x^7ould be countermanded by someone else in a short time. 

If someone questioned their directives, they had nowhere to turn for 
authorization. Therefore, with only a few exceptions subforem.en tried to 
do as little as possible. Also delegation of authority only lasted for a 
few days at a time because of the high turnover of workers. In the 
mornings it was decided who would be in charge of certain jobs. He Tvould 
then be sent out to organize the work in whatever way he thought best. 
However, most of the field workers had been there before, and it was not 
necessary to instruct them so most foremen did nothing. 

It is obvious from, the time cards that none of the people appointed 
to official positions would have been able to hold a job outside the Reserve, 
It must be remembered that this was the very reason that the Project was 
set up—to develop good work habits—and this lack of responsibility was one 
thing the Projct hoped to change. Change, however, x-mip come slowly, 
especially because the Project is trying to change all the mem.bers of the 


community,

Commu ni cation —Both in the case of organizational procedures 
and in the case of managerial procedures there is an overlapping of 
problems. It is almost impossible to say where one ends and the other 
begins; they cannot be distinctly and separately defined. For example, 
in the area of communidation, of the utmost importance in both the 
managerial and organizational aspects of any such Project, all channels 
were limited to oral transmission; there was no definite channel provided 
for written ideas and thus no record kept of many decisions. Also 
exclusively oral com.munication meant that special care had to be taken 
to see that people felt at ease to talk about their ideas and plans. The 
Supervisor worked very hard to assure adequate communication and seemed 
to be fairly successful in eliciting ideas from most people until the 
m^iddle of the summer of 1966 when communication began to break down. 

But communication had been inadequate long before the summer 
of 1966. For instance, the original ideas as planned by the Superintenden 
and the Band Council were not passed along to anyone else. Moreover, 
m.em.bers of the Advisory Conmiittee differed in their ideas about the 
goals of the Project. Members of the Farm Trust had different opinions; 
the Band members had a variety of ideas about what the Project was to do. 
Each group had factions within it. Though the goals finally stated by 
each group were often alike, they had very different ideas on how to 
implemiCnt these goals which \cere not communicated with each other. 


Conclusions and Recomm.endations 


Profit 

The m.ember of the Advisory Committee put one comm.ent in 
their statement which has far-reaching effects on the Project and 
m.ay be the one factor that will destroy it. The statement was made that

the Project was expected to show some profit by the third year. Based on 
technical data from the surrounding farmers and the information shov.m in 
Farm Cost Studies of the Provincial Governm.ent, this seemed like a fairly 
safe assuTiption to make. However, if any of the sociological implications 
had been taken into consideration, it is doubtful whether t?iis statem.ent 
would have been made. If there had been a Sociologist with some 
knowledge of the Band’s social problems on the Comm.ittee, the caluse on 
profit might not have been included. This statement on profit put great 
pressure on the Supervisor. He feels that unless he shows a profit by the 
third year he V7ill have failed. Band m.em.bers feel that they must meet 
the three-year deadline. Because of the profit deadline other goals are 
being discounted or ignored. At the time of writing with fev/ exceptions 
everyone is concerned with making money in the third year. If the 
Committee had chosen a five year period for showing a profit, this suddent 
desire to make the Project lock profitable would not have arisen at the 
cost of the other goals—one of which was the main reason for starting 
the Project. 

If this desire to show a profit is carried full course, the 
author believes that the Project will soon wither away or be turned over 
to some outsider to take over completely. This would mean that the next 
time that someone wanted to get Band members interested in something for 
their own welfare, they would point to the Vegetable Project ’CvcLth 
justification and say that the Project cost a half m.illion doli.ars and 
put them to work for nothing; so the Band is no longer interested in 
development schemes.

Certain sugge£>tions to make the Project profitable were offered— 
for example, four or five ment be appointed to do all the work on the 
Project and the acres of potatoes cut down to a size they would be able 
to handle along \vith the grain acreage. Under this scheme no vegetables 
would be planted. The author feels that there are two direct problems 
with this scheme beside the fact that it is contrary to the very goals 
of the Vegetable Project—developing a scheme which involves enough 
Band members to make it a comm_unity project and thus provide a basis for 
Comjnunity Developm.ent. In the first place the author does not feel that 
there are five men now living on the Reserve who can remain on the Reserve 
with its present social conditions and work on any Project regularly enough 
to make it a paying proposition. Secondly, after nearly all the people 
have had two years in which to make money on the Reserve, it is going to 
be very difficult for them to rem.ain idle while five do all the work and 
get all the m.oney. Even though at first most members may agree to this 

schem.e, they will, after a few months, pressure those in charge to allow 

them to work. 

It has also been suggested that since the Project has lost 
money for two years, it should be allowed to die as any other business 
would die. In the first place, it is not accurate to state that if a 

business loses money for the first two years, it will go bankrupt. Many 

successful businessmen will tell of losing mioney at first by learning 
from their m.istakes, they were able to go on to success. Many things have 
been learned in the first two years. Management was spread too thin the 
second year; low yields resulted and no profit. A great many crops were 
tried the second year, perhaps too m^any, but noxs" what can be grown success¬ 
fully and marketed profitably is knox-zn. Most im.portant, the members of

the Band know that they are capable of growing the crops; now they must 
make the operation operate efficiently. If the Project were allowed to 
die now it would do a great deal of harm, for it would only impress most 
people on the Reserve with the feeling that they could not be successful 
at the same type of farming their neighbors were doing. If this spirit 
comes to prevail on the Reserve it will be extremely hard for anyone to 
start a Project in the future no matter how impressive its prospects. 
General recommendations 

The first recommendation deals with the initial stages of 
any Community Development attempt—the nucleus group. A new nucleus 
group should be formed and then allowed to work out among themselves the 
goals of the Project. The group should include at least one woman, for 
they are a stabilizing influence on the Reserve, After this group 
has decided the direction of the Project, they can pass their ideas on 
to the rest of the Band. It is essential that no member of the nucleus 
group be also a member of the Band Council. The Project should not 
be tied to any one Council or to any of the factions on the Reserve. The 
personnel chosen by the Indian Affairs Branch and the Band Council m.ust 
be avzare of the technical as well as the social implications of their 
suggestions. By the first of May some definite policy should be evolved 
which will be satisfactory to the majority of the Band members and no 
tim.e limit should be stated for changes to be made or goals to be met. 

In making these decisions, it miust be kept in mind that the Enoch Band 
still has some of the same problems they had two years ago. If anything 
has occurred, their condition is generally worse due to the added money 
which the Project has made available to them.

Once the aim of the Project has been decided, a definite line 
of authority must be established. This line of authority and communication 
must be written down and a copy given to each person so that he understands 
his responsibilities. These responsibilities should be explained so that 
each person understands his job and where he stands in relation to the 
others on the team. Responsibility can only be accepted when responsibility 
has been defined. 

Possibly one way of defining specific responsibility would be 
to give certain groups specific crops to look after and for which they 
would be entirely responsible. One man might be put in charge of a field 
of potatoes, and it would be his responsibility to plant the crop and see 
to it that it was profitable. He could hire anyone he wished, and he 
would be responsible for their efficiency on all hand labor. The field 
work done by tractors could be planned at meetings each Friday for the 
coming week. It would be the Supervisor’s job to see that the Friday 
meetings planned the work for the coming week to the best advantage of the 
machinery and the people. The men in charge of the field would get the 
same wage as the field workers and also get a share of the profit at the 
end of the year. Because some men would have different sized fields and 
different amounts of w^ork to do, they might work another man’s field if 
asked. Each fieldman would be responsible for keeping the records on his 
field and w^ould not be paid until his records were accurate. The first 
year the fields could be allocated by a draw; thereafter, the man with the 
highest percent return on his field might have his pick of the fields for 
the coming year. The most inefficient farmers would lose their right to 
a field, and it would be given to others that xcere applying for a field 
or if no one wanted it, to the m.ost successful man. The main advantage of

this scheme is that it allows for some personal achievement and will 
reward a man who works hard. In the present scheme all were paid the 
same V7hether they slept under a bush or worked hard. It might also be 
possible to have some system in which the workers receive a certain 
percentage of the profit from the most successful fields so that in the 
next year they would want to work for the good managers even though 
they might have to work a little harder. If a fieldman is not on the 
job when he should be, the Supervisor in consultation with two other 
fieldmen can do whatever is necessary, and the field will be charged 
with both the fieldmen’s labor. 

Finally, a smaller but no less important aspect of the 
Project has been reviewed and found wanting—bookkeeping methods. A 
different approach is going to have to be taken in regard to book- 
keeping. At the present time the books are not accurate, and none of the 
Band members are learning how to manage from the books kept. If various 
committees feel that the I.B.M. bookkeeping system has some advantages, 
it should remain in force. However, the author feels that people on 
the Reserve must learn what these figures mean; they can only learn 
bookkeeping from doing the books and learning what goes into each section 
and V7hy. It is impractical to expect people who have little, if any, 
experience with bookkeeping to be able to read the I.B.M. reports when they 
do not understand what went into them and when not one of the reports has 
been free of mistakes. The regular bookkeeping procedures recoirmended by 
the Agricultural Economic Branch of the Provincial Department of 
Agriculture are probably the best type of records for the Project at this 


time.

The non-Indians involved vzith this Project, through extremely 
poor communication and organization between themselves and with the Band 
members, have not given the Band members the help which they need and 
desire. To scrap the Vegetable Project or to turn it over to a private 
organization to run would be ridiculous and sad, and furthermore, 
disastrous for the egos of Band members. It would only add one more 
item to the list of failures for the Enoch Band. Certainly it would be 
easier, financially more secure, but when one looks at the goals or the 
reasons stated for the inception of this Project, neither of these 
alternatives would solve anything and thus there would be no meaning to 
two years of work.

APPENDIX II 


Any person on the Reserve who makes a decision affecting 
members of the Band must keep in mind its affect on the different 
families. Figure 1 shows that these families are very complicated. 

Because of the many family interrelationships and the strong family 
ties of the Band members it is very difficult for any one Band member to 
choose another Band member for a job, to run machinery, or to receive 
more money. It is very difficult to fire your relations, and, as one 
can see, most people are related. This chart only shows the immediate 
family relationships, but since most children live or frequently visit 
their aunts and uncles during childhood they feel that they are part of 
that famiily also. Their family feeling towards the relatives of their 
aunts and uncles is as strong as for their ov/n relatives. The overall 
result is that most people on the Reserve are part of a large family group 
and so are forced by social pressure to help their families whenever 
they can. Thus an efficient use of human resources is almost impossible.

APPENDIX III 


This letter to the editor of the Edmonton Journal was 
included to reinforce the point that pride in his home, his Project, 
his people, and himself is as important to a Band member as it is to 
any human being. 

January 25th, 196 7 - Edm.onton Journal 

Indian replies 

I refer to the letter in The Journal from "Tired White." 

Yes, a few of our people do thumb rides into the 
city, but don’t judge our whole reservation by these few. 

True, we have a few people who would rather sit on 
their porch steps and smoke. But these are our older 
people; they have done their share in making our reserve a 
better one, and we of the younger generation owe it to 
them to help them in their old age. 

The pensioners are provided with wood and coal, and 
power bills are paid by the reserve. We do not get any 
assistance from any government for this. 

None of the band members on our reserve are on federal 
or provincial government welfare. If there are any band 
members in need of assistance, we give them aid through our 
band funds. Our reserve is fortunate to have oil and gas 
in the land, and through agricultural and surface leases 
we derive revenues. From these revenues we make up an 
annual band budget. In this budget we include a certain 
amount of money for welfare assistance for band mem.bers. 

Only after that are the sick and the crippled put on relief. 

As for the women, most of them, do lots of canning, 
planting gardens, sewing and everything else v/hite women do. 

We don’t like the word Tired WTiite used to describe the 
Indians. We don’t think there is anyone or anything "useless."

We . recomniend that anyone who believes Tired \ihite's 
letter come out to the Stony Plain Indian Reserve at 
Winterburn and view our vegetable project, our new council 
building and band office, and our people who work in these 
places. Then write to The Journal as to what you really 
see.
