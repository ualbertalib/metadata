ANOMALOUS PROPERTIES OF DIELECTRICS. 


SUMMARY OF INVESTIGATION. 

A very sensitive bridge method allowing a greatly 
extended range of frequencies to be used without change 
of apparatus was developed. Experimental results thus 



and P = Bf n are not correct, and an effort to supply in 
place thereof a more nearly correct empirical relation 


based on Wagner s extended theory of Maxwell has been 


made. It is later pointed out in the Appendix that the 
relation suggested, while surprisingly close, obscures 
an important relation and cannot be theoretically true $ 
and further, that the results of subsequent tests do not 
indicate any simple relations between quantities to 
substantiate classical theories, as applied to commercial 
samples of dielectrics.

ANOMALOUS PROPERTIES OF DIELECTRICS. 

INTRODUCTION 

Pure dielectrics undisputedly display two normal 
characteristics: a definite specific inductive capacity 
( dielectric constant ), and a specific conduotivity. 

In addition most dielectrics also display other properties, 
the explanations of which are obscure* These anomalous 
properties are: absorption and residual charge, dielectric 
energy loss and power factor much larger than can be 
accounted for by concluctivity. It has been generally 
observed that for some substances in a very pure state, 
such as sulphur, quartz, and paraffin, anomalous properties 
are negligible in amount* On the other hand, most dielectrics 
and certain^ most, if not all, commercial dielectrics are 
neither pure nor definite combinations of pure substances; 
and it is generally considered, that for this reason they 
exhibit anomalous properties to a more marked degree# 

The classical theory of Maxwell deals only with pure 
substances and supposes only the two normal properties. 
Attempts to extend the theory were made by Rowland, Grover, 
and Wagner. Of these the theory of Wagner probably has the 
most apx^eal, because of its comprehensive form. He was able 
to show that a combination of two Maxwell pure dielectrics 
would display all the anomalous properties, qualitatively 
at least. He also obtained some experimental verification 
for this theory* Wagner went further in an endeavor to 
explain the variations which he found in more heterogeneous 
substances* Mathematically, he showed that by assuming a 
sufficient number of impurities he could obtain surprising 
agreements between theory and experiment* 

Other men have tried to exjDlain absorption on the 
basis of an anoma.lous relation between electric displace¬ 
ment and electric force originating within the molecule- 
the theory of Pellat and von Schweidler. Decombe explained 
it on the basis of-Lorentz f s theory of electron motion 
Within the atom, while still others attribute absorption 
to anomalous conductivit 3 T , and to moisture in the interstices 
of the body. All the theories or hypotheses mentioned fail 
to explain or account for at least one property displayed by 
actual samples (a.)* The extended theory of Maxwell still 
has a wide appeal, but modern research has a tendency to 
favor anomalous conductivity electrolytic in character. 

Although the a.bove theories have been proposed, and 
all found to be incomplete in some respect, a surprisingly 
scanty knowledge of the actual experimental behavior of 
dielectrics is available. The range of frequencies used in

investigations mainly by research engineers has been widely 
extended, but empirical laws governing the phenomena are 
still lacking. For these two reasons, to obtain accurate 
measurements, and to deduce therefrom empirical laws for 
the anomalous behavior of some commercial samples of dielect¬ 
rics, seemed to be a fruitful field for the labors of this 
research# 

GENERAL METHOD AND APPARATUS. 

The majority of investigators have confined their 
attention to the behavior of dielectrics under a. very 
limited range of frequencies. These have generaliy been 
within the audible range, and therefore suitable for bridge 
work, while those who were more ambitious and ventured above 
the audible range were forced to employ a change of system 
to cover the range, thereby jeopardizing the accuracy of the 
measurements. The appearance on the market of an input 
transformer, guaranteed by the manufacturers, Leeds and 
Northrup, to respond with'fidelity to frequencies up to 
E0,000 cycles per second, makes it now unnecessary to 
switch from a. bridge to resonant circuits for measurements 
at the higher frequencies. With such a transformer, a good - 
A. 0 . bridge and a vacuum tube amplifier-heterodyne system, 
about to be described, the range of frequencies can be- 
extended to ^ 0 9 000 cycles with a consequent advantage to 
accuracy of measurement. 

THE BRIDGE. 

The bridge used for this research is a special true 
capacity A. G. bridge deve 1 oped by Dr• H. J. MacLeod ( b) 
with one noteworthy change, suggested by Morecroft (c), 
the grounded point being the rotary plates of the two 
condensers as shown in the diagram of apparatus. The 
individual parts as well as the whole bridge are shielded. 

The inpull to the bridge is made through the special, trans¬ 
former already PlefcwAd fe, which is connected to a resonant, 
circuit coupled as loosely as advisable to,the oscillator 
in order to eliminate harmonics, and still impress U5 volts 
on the bridge®

THE OSCILLATOR. 

The two oscillators used for the frequency ranges 
indicated on the diagram of apparatus are well known types 
and embody no special features except flexibility and 
ease of adjustment especially necessary at the audio 
frequencies, where tuning forks must be used in the ad¬ 
justment of the frequency. A Precision Wavemeter (General 
Radio Corp.) was used to measure the higher frequencies. 

THE AMPLIFIER AND HETERODYNE. 

The vacuum tube amplifier and heterodyne system are 
worthy of special mention. ‘The values of resistance and 
capacity indicated on the diagram are not critical, but 
those values designated were thought to work best. The 
coupling condensers must not be too large, on account of 
possible reaction back on the bridge, nor too small to 
permit reasonable sensitivity. The vacuum tubes used were 
U.X. 201 A. f s, but might well have been any good general 
purpose triodes. The first tube is always a resistance- 
capacity coupled amplifier, while the second tube may be 
made either an amplifier for audio frequencies or a detector 
for the higher frequencies, by throwing the switch S z to 
the right or left. When the switch is thrown to the right 
a steady plate voltage is impressed on the plate through 
the telephone transformer; when thrown to the left an 
oscillating plate voltage from the oscillating circuit of 
the heterodyne oscillator, is impressed on the plate 
through the bff-pass condenser across the telephone.trans¬ 
former. The same b#~pass condenser also affords a path for 
the higher bridge frequencies, and the phones respond to 
the beat frequency between the two, since the inductive 
path is the lower impedance path to the beat frequency. 

The heterodyne oscillator is a conventional type 
oscillator with five point adjustment for flexibility. 

This is necessary in order to eliminate the locally gen¬ 
erated harmonics by proper adjustment of grid and plate 
excitation on the oscillator. The whole set-up can be 
calibrated approximately for fnequency.„^the^ieterodyne 
setting to give a clear inOQ cycle note A ^eirig simultan¬ 
eously recorded. In this way, the full frequency range 
can be covered quite quickly. 

Both the amplifier and the oscillator were separately 
and completely shielded as shown In the diagram. The whole 
arrangement was found to be especially commendable for 
bridge measurements, there being absolutely no background 
noises present. Absolute balance of the bridge could be 
made at all frequency settings used. The amplifier system 
also served as a complete buffer between the observer a.nd 
the bridge, and no body-capacity effects whatsoever were 
noticed.

BRIDGE THEORY AND TECHNIQUE. 


Since the bridge is of the equal arm type (i.e. R,=sRi), 
assuming a sinusoidal impressed electromotive force, balance 
is obtained when 


— % > ^2. ^ ^3 '• 

However, in practice the bridge will seldom be exactly bal¬ 
anced within itself, and the correction factor must be found. 
This can be done by connecting the Precision Condenser ( set 
at 1000 uu,f., say ) in parallel with C^ , the latter being at 
its mininura setting. Set the frequency (at a 1000 cycles, say) 
and hold it constant. Balance the bridge by adjusting C 2 and 
R a . Record R e • Now place aru-added resistance R ( about 5^00 
ohmsfo*} in the left arm and record Rl. The first reading is 
the right hand side equivalent series resistance of the left 
arm plus or minus (as the case may be) any unbalance in the 
bridge itself. The second reading gives the same result plus 
the equivalent of ^>000 ohms. When Ra is made large, the small 
resistance of the Precision Condenser R- )0 is negligible. 

Then 


or 



k( R[ -

For the bridge used, the value of k was found to be 1.091* 
Having thud found the bridge constant, it was possible to 
set the Precision Condenser at any "value and measure its 
-series resistance on the bridge. In this way the series 
resistance of the Precision Condenser at a certain setting 
1000 uufo was found for the full range of frequencies. The 
same 'was done for another setting 79^ UUf*> and from these 
two sets of data two calibration curves were plotted (See 
Precision Condenser Losses Curves). By means of the relation 
developed in the following paragraph, the series resistance 
could be calculated for any setting of the Precision Condenser 
and Applied as a correction to the reading), of resistance 
indicated on the decade box. 

Consider the Precision air condenser as a pure variable 
capacity Gp in parallel with a small imperfect condenser of 
capacity G r and resistance R r , as in Fig.(l). 

The reactances of these two condenser 
circuits are so large compared with 
the resistances, that the reactances 
and impedances may be considered 
equal to each other. Then, in finding 
the equivalent series circuit,

Thus the series resistance of the Precision Condenser 
varies inversely as the square of the capacity. The 
situation is exactly the same when the Precision 
Condenser is connected in parallel v/ith C 3 since the 
latter is a pure capacity* 


PROCEDURE. 


( 4 ) 

( 5 ) 


Since previous investigators have established that 
temperature has a very considerable effect on the power 
factor of e dielectric, these experiments were performed 
in a room which remained at constanttemperature. Further¬ 
more, the condensers were built up with mercury plates, 
and it was found that the amount of mercury present in 
the plates also helped to maintain constant temperature 
in the dielectric. A thermometer was kept floating in one 
corner of the bottom grounded plate, giving a continuous 
temperature reading right close to the dielectric under 
examination. 

An approximately constant voltage was applied to 
the bridge at all frequencies as a precautionary measure, 
since some investigators have reported effects of voltage 
changes. This was obtained by adjusting the current in the 
condenser across the coupled output of the oscillator to 
a predetermined value necessary to give volts.

(a) Preparation of Samples. 

All the glass samples, the hard rubber, and ebonite 
were set up according to the diagram. The sample plate 

was placed in a glass tray on three 
glass strips around three sides. 

The fourth side was left open as a 
suitable place to pour in the mercury 
for the lower xolate and to serve as 
a connecting surface to the grounded 
bridge lead, lend' a^’bath in which the 
thermometer was allowed to float. The 
upper plate was also of mercury en¬ 
compassed by a thin adjustable brass 
frame. (See Fig. (2).}

ANOMALOUS PROPERTIES OF DIELECTRICS, 

The bakelite sample was specially prepared by 
turning a circular depression on one side in a lathe. 

The adjustable frame was then unnecessary, the mercury 
just filling the depression*. 

In all cases the samples were carefully cleaned 
before being set up, and the mercury was strained 
through several thicknesses of cheese cloth to remove 
grease and amalgam. 

The ground connection from the bridge was connected 
continuously to the lower plate of the sample condenser 
and to the resistance box in series with the Precision 
Condenser by a branching lead. A small piece of wire, 
one end of which was immersed in mercury and wrapped once 
around a strip of heavy glass, which also served as a 
weight to hold down the brass frame confining the mercury 
of the upper plate, served as the connecting point to the 
upper plate "to which the high potential post of the bridge 
was connected when desired. This high potential connection 
was made by a. very short lead With a small clip on the 
end ( S 3 ), so that it could be switched either to the 
Precision Condenser or the sample, as desired, 

(b) Measurements. 

Samples were run continuously up or continuously 
down as regards frequency. The oscillators having been 
set to their proper frequencies, the bridge was balanced 
with the sample condenser switched in. The change in 
connections S^was made to the Precision Gondenser and 
resistance, and these were adjusted for balance, the 
readings of which gave directly the measurements required. 
The only other change,apart from oscillator settings,over 
the full range of frequency was the change of the switch 
S^for super-audible frequencies. The frequency of the 
bridge input oscillator was checked from time to time 
during measurement.

ANOMALOUS PROPERTIES OP DIELECTRICS. 


OBSERVATIONS. 


Attempts were made to obtain readings down as low 
as Go cycles, but it was invariably found that harmonics 
originating from the behavior of the dielectric under 
observation were so unavoidably prominent that the bridge 
could not be balanced* The second and third harmonics 
were definitely recognized at 256 cycles, but were not 
so prominent as to riake the balancing of the bridge 
impossible. Even at 20,000 cycles the second harmonic 
was found to be present by suitable adjustment of the 
heterodyne oscillator. This observation, it is thought, 
has not been specificate mentioned before, although it 
was to be expected, since any circuit embodying variable 
parameters ( such as are due to the anomalous properties 
of dielectrics ) to which a pure sinusoidal voltage is 
applied, must necessarily within itself generate a whole 
series of harmonics. 


CALCULATIONS AND CURVES. 


The observed values of series resistance were 
corrected for the amount of resistance R^in the. 

Precision Condenser, according to equation ( 5 ) based 
on the Precision Condenser Losses Curves. The logarithm 
of the series resistance of each sample plotted against 
the logarithm of the frequency is plotted in the Series 
Resistance Variation With Frequency Curves. 

For angles less than two degrees there is no 
appreciable error in saying that the angle d is the 
same as its tangent or sine. The sine of the Phase 
Difference d is actually the Power Factor* of the dielectric 


Ic 



In calculations it is much more convenient to use the 
tangent, since 

tan cT-RwC (7) 

In the Fewer Factor Variation with Frequency Curves 
log tan d has been plotted against log f. 

Capacity Variation with Frequency curves are 
self-explanatory. The determination of the Geometric 
Capacity was done in a novel manner. The capacities 
were plotted on a time of charge base, the time of 
charge being one quarter of a period, l/4f, and the 
curves were extrapolated to zero. The amount of exten¬ 
sion of the curve required in this form is very short. 


















25 


ANOMALOUS PROPERTIES OP DIELECTRICS. 

and when plotted on a large scale can be done more 
definitely, it is thought. 

Now the condenser was again considered ?s a 
parallel circuit ( Fig. (4).), and the "true" geo¬ 
metric susceptance was calculated from the geometric 
capacity: 

b 0 => wC 0 L^'i* b = (8) 

The difference 

w( @*T 0 o ) = (See Note below) (9) 

the anomalous susceptance. The anomalous conductance g a 
(since the true conductance g was negligible) was then, 

g a =. b. tan d ( 10 ) 

Having found these,- the anomalous admittance follows 

y a ~ (ii) 

which reduced to its lowest terms for application of 
the theory of errors becomes, 

_ _ ( 12 ) 

y a = w \/R*w 4 *C*+-( C r G 0 ) z 

ERRORS AND ACCURACY. 


Unfortunately, during these tests a meter in the 
resonant circuit used from 250,000 to 1 , 000,000 cycles 
for the purpose of obtaining geometric capacity data 
developed a poor contact within the case, which was rot 
discovered until later as the cause of the poor readings 
at these high frequencies in all cases except those for 
Quartziite and Hard Rubber. A reasonable capacity curve 
was constructed from the data for Red Bakelite, and from 
these three the calculations were carried to the point 
indicated. 


Despite these inaccuracies, treatment of the results 
for Quartziite according to the theory of errors shows 
that the total percentage possible error in the result y 
at 256 cycles should not be greater than 2 $, while at 
50,000 cycles it should not be more than The percent 

error at 256 cycles is very much greater than that at 
512 cycles owing to difficulty in balancing the bridge 
at very low frequencies. For intermediate values'of 
frequency the possible error is no more than Vf:.* The points 
at 4 qq£ cycles were taken for what they were‘worth, it 
being fully realizedT"that they v ere not very reliable on 
account of the poor response of the head-phones at this 
frequency, with consequent inaccuracy in adjustment of the 
bridge. Ir. the other results there are occasional points 
definitely off the curves owing to some erratic experimental 


error.

AWOI'IALOUS PROPERTIES OF DIELECTRICS. 

RESULTS. 

All the curves, photographs of which ere reproduced 
herewith, were plotted on sheets at least l6”x 20”, which 
allowed accurate plotting to second and sometimes third 
places of decimals. From these plots it is clearly evid¬ 
ent that there is curvature all the way in the Series 
Resistance Variation With Frequency Curves (d). According 
to these results the relations R = A/f K , p := Bf n (e) ?re 
quite definitely ruled out. 

The Power Factor curves are similar to some previous 
observations, and those for the different glass samples 
agree qualitatively, but not quantitatively, as will be 
shown 1 later, with the 0 e curves for 

Red Bakelite, Ebonite, and Hard Rubber are different in 
character, and it is doubtful whether after Wagner f s 
proposed modification of constants for impurities, even 
qualitative agreement with his theory could be definitely 
ascribed# 

On the basis of the results for three samples as 
indicated previously, the Anomalous Admittance Variation 
With Frequency Curves were constructed, and a straight 
line relation discovered, which seemed to apply with 
extreme accuracy up to 2000 cycles (approx.) and good 
accuracy even up to JO,000 cycles, the significance of 
which will be discussed later. The straight line relations 
between log y a and log f yield the general la?/.

ANOMALOUS PROPERTIES OR DIELECTRICS 
DISCUSSION OF RESULTS. 


Of the above samples the tests on Quartzlite were 
probably the most accurate, when all factors introducing 
error are considered. The Red Bakelite sample is subject 
to inaccuracy with respect to its (Geometric Capacity, as 
already indicated. While the readings for the Hard Rubber 
seem quite reliable, actually, difficulty was found in 
balancing the bridge at the low frequencies. This was 
because the size of the sam£>le was such that only a rela«t 
tively small capacity could be built up, making capacity 
adjustments very much more critical than resistance. It 
is felt that for this reason the points tend to drop 
below the straight line at the low frequencies for this, 
sample. While absolute conformity to the relation jj§ s Af n - 
is not claimed above approximately 2000 cycles, as will be 


shown later, the relation is in absolute agreement with 
experiment so long as absorption alone is responsible for 
the anomalous behavior; and even extending the range to 
J0000 cycles it is a more nearly correct empirical relation 
than the formerly proposed R = A/f y • Beyond 30000 cycles 
the curve flattens out, falling below the straight line, 
indicating, as will be shown later, that anomalous 
conductance i.s becoming increasingly important. 

That the relation y a - Af n is reasonable on the 
basis of absorption alone can be shown quite easily. For, 
as a deduction from Wagner s vector representation of 
absorption currents, it follows that the angled remains 
constant so long as only absorption takes place (f)» For 
this purpose the dielectric may be considered as a par¬ 
allel circuit, in which 0* and r are the anomalous capa¬ 



city and resistance necesllry to 
account for absorption. Then,

When log G was plotted against log f (curves not 
shown here) to obtain the value of m, the value of n 
calculated therefrom within the absorption range (i.e. 
up to 2000 cycles approx*) was in very close agreement 
with that actually obtained by plotting, while for the 
full range the value of n was only Jbelow that 
actually obtained. This is not unreasonable in view of 
the original experimental error and the number of oper¬ 
ations passed through in calculation* 

Again, the experimental results of this research 
indicate that g a is proportional to b up to approxim¬ 
ately 2000 cycles, above which g a begins to increase 
very gradually more rapidly than b a * The deviation 
from proportionality here can only be observed by 
plotting on a. very large scale, as is also true of the 
anomalous admittance curves. The deviation from the 
straight line relation between log y a and log f can 
therefore be attributed to another anomalous conductance. 

The vector diagram no v ’ 
becomes as in Fig* (6), with 
an additional angle governing 
or governed fey the anomalous 
conductance g a , the latter 
becoming increasingly important 
as the frequency is raised above 
50,000 cycles per second. It 
would be possible to continue 
the investigation of the results 
further to find just how the 
anomalous conductance varies with frequency. But it .was 
considered best that the investigation end here, until 
the former empirical relations can be more definitely 
corroborated, a work which will be done as soon as the

necessary changes to the apparatus can he made. 

Qualitatively at least, the results of this 
research indicate that the anomalous properties of 
dielectrics are due to two causes: (a) absorption 
which is more important at low frequencies, and 
(b) anomalous conductance which appears at medium 
frequencies and becomes increasingly important as 
the frequency is increased. 

In conclusion the writer wishes to acknowledge 
his indebtedness to the Electrical Engineering 
Department and the Physics Department for the loan 
of special apparatus; to Mr- J- W. Porteous for his 
assistance in photographing the various curves; and 
to Dr. H. J. MacLeod, who directed the work and gave 
able assistance and helpful suggestions at all times, 
the writer tenders his sincere thanks*

APPENDIX. 

Subsequent Measurements over a frequency range of 
256 to 1000000 cycles per second show conclusively that 
the log R s vs. log f curve is not a straight line, but 
concave upwards, and therefore the law R = A/f^ is 
ruled cut. Similarly, the law P - Bf n is not correct 
since the log g a vs. log f curve is concave upwards 
( g. is the conductance or power per unit voltage). 

The data of subsequent tests show, therefore, that the 
curves for Resistance, Power Factor, and Capacity 
variation with frequency shown in this thesis are 
experimentsljy correct. 

A more extended theoretical consideration of the 
anomalous conductance, susceptance and admittance shows 
that the proposed relation cannot be theoretical^ true. 
The difficulty is that on a log frequency base, both 
log b a and log g a are concave up. There is, however, very 
little curvature in the log b g curve because the capacity 
variation is a relatively small quantity. Moreover, when 
the law y a « Af n was proposed, the fact that b a is from 
two to three times as large as g g was overlooked. Conse¬ 
quently, it was not realized that the effect of g a would 
not be apparent, and that some such law as b 8 * Df d would 
have been equally as good, which is obviously not true, 
because the capacity curve is definitely known not to be 
linear. It should be pointed out also, thet even if g a 
and b a were comparable, the effect would be to make the 
log y a vs. log f curve concave upwards also. 

In view of these facts, it cannot be said that 
anomalous properties are due to any one particular cause, 
as classical theories propose. Evidently the law is a 
very complicated relation between man 3 ’ factors unknown 
at present. However, the experimental results shown on 
Plates III, IV, V are, it is thought, as accurate as can 
be obtained, and have been Garefully corroborated for a 
much wider range 'of frequencies than here shown.
