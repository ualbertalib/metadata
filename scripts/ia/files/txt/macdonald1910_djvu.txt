THE EFFECTS OF THE SCIENTIFIC POINT OF VIEW ON THE STUDY OF 

SCRIPTURE AND' ON PREACHINC. 













I 



"The $ffectL*of the Scientific Point of View on the Study 
of Scripture and on Preaching." 

It ie a fact worthy of notice, that although all nations 
and ages have had their religious hooks, no other volume has 
exerted so great an influence over the minds and hearts of men 
as the Bible. Since the time of Martin Luther this hook has 

been regarded by Europeans, asa noble type of literature as 
well as a guide in matters of religion and morals. To a very 
great degree, the Anglo-Saxon race may be said to have derived 
its culture and its civilization from this single source. 

So deeply has the Book implanted itself upon the life of 
our time, and so greatly has it influenced the best poets and 
singers, that scholars and people alike find it almost impossible 
to think in terms which are not in essential agreement with its 
principles of morality. In all ages, great men have turned 

to our Book of books as to the very spring of thought and 
inspiration. This particular Book gave Milton his "Paradise", 

it gave Handel his "Messiah", Titian his "Transfigu^rTi in" ard 
Christopher Wren the plan of his cathedral. Prom the same 

great source, Cromwell issfe^-his conception of liberty and Lincoln 
his "Golden" rule for meting out the same treatment to white 
and black alike. 

If the Bible were taken out of the Cathedrals and Churches 
of Europe, taken out of the World’s Songs and Sympathies, out 
of its laws and literatures, only the outer shell of civilization 
would remain. The Bible alone of all the books of the world 

has had a universal relationship to all ages and classes. It 
has made a vivid impression upon child life. Upon its pages 
poets have cast their eyes in joyful anticipation and they have 
not been disappointed * Many of the thoughts expressed in the 

Bible, lie like golden threads upon the pages cf Macaulay and 
Burke. Orators and public speakers have quoted from it so 

freely, that we may in all fairness say that our most highly 
cultured men are those who have delved most deeply into the 
Scriptures. In our time the principles of morality enunciated 
in the Bible form the body and substance of modern law and 
jurisprudence. For many centuries it has been the Book used

in their distress have turned, it has "been the Book used by the 
common people struggling upward,and it has been the Book of hope 
in which many prodigals have found fch® comfort, joy, and sound 
advice. To the individual it reveals the value of each 

separate life. For the State it is a handbook of civiliz* 

ation. 

Of late years the Bible has strangely enough, become a 
centre of storm and attack. The time was, when men read and 
reverenced it as if it were a book, which had come down directly 
from God. In certain quarters this reverence amounted almost 

to idolatry, A Scottish writer of the last century tells us, 

that his father after he had conducted evening worship used to 
place the Bible upon the doorstep in order to keep spooks away. 
Fortunately for us, the tendency to treat the Bible as an 
idolater treats his fetich has given fad-thr to a reverent faith 
and study. At the present time the Scriptures are passing 

through a period of transition. They are being weighed in 

the balance. They are being tested and tried. In other 

times attacks were made upon them, but never have the Sacred 
writings been subjected to 'such a sever^test, as the one which 
is being applied to them at the present time. Never before 
as far as we are aware, have wit and scholarship been used 
against the Bible, with such skill and force, and never before 
have assaults of so bitter a nature been made against it from 
so many sides. 

It is strange, but nevertheless true that the book which 
earlier generations valued so highl;/ has become a centre around 
which a battle royal is being waged. Gertain individuals 

have taken their stand upon one part, of the volume, while others 
have undertaken to uphold another portion of it. As a result 
texts have been formed into missiles, and some of the m$st 
precious truths of Scripture have been formed into weapons of 
offence and defence. The history of the world proves to 

us we believe, that any instruments which tends to increase 
influence, wealth, and wisdom, has a tendency to engender war 
and strife. In every age, the palace stored with wealth 

and the treasure house filled with precious stones, have been 
the prizes for which men have struggled and died. 

In the time of Pericles, Phidias and the members of his

school, toiled arduously to fill the Parthenon with the most 
precious specimens of Marble, that they could find. The great 
value of these treasures, engendered covetousness. In the 
fierce struggle which ensued the Parthenon became a veritable 
arsenal. The Athenians stationed on the inside used the 

blocks of marble as barricades. Behind these barricades 

they placed warriors fully accoutred. On the outside sttood 

the Turks hurling missiles through the walls and roof. In a 
very short space of time, the beautiful and spacious Parthenon 
became a heap of ruins and the gallery a mass of blackened 
fragments. And as in an earlier time the Parthenon became 

an object of attack, so in our time the Bible has become and 
object of attack. All sects and parties, have gone to it 

for texts with which to buttress their positions. Errors 

in geology and astronomy have been found in the Book, and some 
have claimed that it contains mistakes in history and science 
and crude conceptions of morality. 

Unfortunately, many of the discussions which have taken 
place in regard to the Bible have had a detrimental effect. 

They have destroyed the faith and confidence of large numbers 
of people. For a great many people, the Bible is as though 

it were net.during late years, however, there has been less 
heat manifested in the various conroversiregarding the nature 
and Authority of the Scriptures. The smoke is clearing 

away and the attempt to overthrow the Bible has met its Waterloo, 
If on the one hand, we must admit that the old view of verbal 
inspiration, that looked upon each Chapter, and verse, and word, 
as inspired by God, has been rendered untenable, we must on the 
other hand, admit that reverent scholarship, meeting alias 

assaults £&n their respective levels has established the authority 
and value of the Bible, as a book of conduct and character, 
and also as a book of God, We should ever remember, that 
the so-called attacks of men upon the Bible, have been^the 

attempts of scholars to clear away false conceptions, in order 
that the Book might speak for itself. The new views regarding 

the Scriptures, have brought the conviction that the Bible has 
only begun its work as an instrument in the regeneration of 
human life. At the present time, the Bible bids fair to go

down into the future as a light shining in a dark place. The 
grass withereth, the flower fadeth, the hills perish in their 
places, “yea, the mountain stream wearies the mountain heart as 
the crimson pulse does ours; and the natural force of the iron 
crag is abated in its appointed time like the strength of the 
sinews in a human old age;" the grass withereth, the hills 
perish, the mountains fall, but the word of our God standeth 
f orever. 

Evolution has done for time what Newton’s "Principia" did 
for space. It has shown the Geologist the way in which a 

ball of fire became a home for man. It has shown the Astronomer 

the changes through which the planets, stars, sun and moon are 
now passing,, It has shown Scientists, that all tilings which 

creep or walk or fly have come to their present condition through 
long periods of change and development. Evolution portrays 

man’s rise and progress. It shows the various stages through 

which the human race has passed, up to the present time* 

Evolution shows us, how the forked stick has been replaced by 
the steam plow, how the language of signs has been exchanged 
for the language of the poets and philosophers, and how ignorance 
and vice, have in a large measure been supplanted by knowledge 
and morality, Go great and manifold have been the changes, 

brought about by the theory of evolution in College and Church, 

/ 

that a very large number of the teachers and preachers of England 
and America, are using it, as the basis of^instruction which they 
give in both Church and Classroom. Evolution in the first 

place, gives us a large/LView of the method, plan, and aim of the 
Divine in the Universe. Those who accept the general theory 

of evolution secure a far larger sweep of the movements of God. 

In the second place, and as a result of the larger view whichit 
gives of the method, plan and aim of God; evolution has led to 
a great extension and strengthening of the design argument* 

At first this did not appear to be true, but at this time the 
final gain can hardly be Questioned or doubted. The 

power of the argument in the new form given by evolution is well 
illustrated by John Fiske’s "The Destiny of Man”. Man is here 


pictured even more abviously than before, as the crown and goal

of creation, and the whole development is seen to point forward 
to a moral and spiritual heing, posessed of an endless capacity 
for grov/th. In the third place, evolution has made it easier 
for men to see the harmony which exists between the plan of God 
in the natural world and his plan in the Spiritual world^ — TCo 
see that one great plan in reality, embraces both, that one 
master mind is working to a definite goal in the whole. In 

the fourth place, evolution tends to enlarge our conception of 
God in Hie immanence in the world. Theologians today rejoice 

in the larger and more KsaLj&hxKnssiXK comprehensive view which 
evolution gives of the method, plan and aim of God in the Universe, 
They rejoice in the great extension and strengthening of the 
design argument, which it has brought about, in the harmony which 
it has shown to exist in the Universe, and in the enlarged con¬ 
ception of God in his immanence in the world, which it has brought 
to the minds of men. 

As a result of the studies and investigations of eminent 
scholars, a great many misconceptions regarding the Bible have 
been removed. The most enlightened people of today no longer 
regard the Book as a single volume. They regard it rather, 

as a libra.ry in which the religious views and experiences of 
many peoples are brought together and bound into one volume 
for purposes of convenience. The Bible contains a great 

many parts and into its composition have entered the writings 
of many authors. In many cases these men lived in different 

periods, and as a result had particular difficulties and problems 
with which to contend. Between the writing of the first hook 

of loses and the writing of the last book of John, great changes 
took place, empires rose and fell and institutions waxed and 
waned, but during all these centuries and among manjr different 
peoples, conscience as the vice regent of God, did ever rebuke 
sin and praise integrity. The Sage and the See^t the herdsman 

and the husbandman, the poet and the pri'ce, all,bear witness 
to the foolishness of sin and the wisdom of right living. The 
Bible is, therefore, essentially aij( history of the rise and 
progress of ideas, right and wrong, as they began in Abraham 
and developed into their full strength and beauty and purity in 
the life of our Lord and Master. Bor those who are enlightened

the Bible is a record of what God has done, rather than a record 
of what God has said. It is not a book dealing with geology, 

nor a book dealing with astronomy, nor a book dealing with 
chemistry. He who is desirous of gaining & knowledge 

regarding any of the sciences, must turn to the text books---and 
treatises which deal with these subjects. The Bible is pre¬ 
eminently a book of morals and a book of religion. The moral 

element which is found in the Bible, is the bond which unites 
the various parts of it into what we call the Book of God, 

The moral element found in the various pa.rts of the Scriptures, 
binds them together just as the sense of the beautiful has united 
in Westminster Abbey foundations and walls, towers and chapels, 
representing many different centuries and strangely divergent 
types of architecture; yet making but one edifice, which meets 
all the requirements and purposes of a noble and magnificent 
cathedral. The unity of the Bible is not the unity of a 

single song it is the unity of an oratorio or a symphony. 

Each age must act as its own interpreter in spiritual matters. 
Each age posesses its own favorite analogies, illustrations and 
modes of conception and expression. Truths, if they are to 
have avital pla^e, in the life of any age must be stated in 
terms which are familiar to the people living at that particular 
time. This is not a sign of deterioration, it is s, sign of 

progress; a sign of interest and life. The generation which 

is willing to accept a truth in the exact form in which its 
predecessor expressed it, is a generation for which that particular 
truth has no vital meaning. The truth which posesses value 

for any particular people is the truth which has been translated 
into the thought and language of that people. In a great 

many cases differencesin statement point only to differences in 
temperament. Theology must advance as science advances, 

it must never become static, it must ever be dynamic. Each 

worker in the realm of theology may contribute something to the 
developing system of theological truth, and each one should, 
welcome the contributions which ot/hers make. It should always 
be kept clearly in mind however, that it is not possible for any 
one to establish a final system of theology.

the theologian is to make such contribution as he can, to the 
existing body of truth and to make real to his own generation 
the great abiding truths of Christianity. The task of the 

theologian is but a temporary one, as he very Vt^ell knows. 

Ke realizes that in the nature of the case, his statement of 
the truth cannot be a final one., He is conscious of the 

fact that he is limited but he endeavours earnestly and faithfully 
to add something to the ever increasing body of theological 
truth. 


Speaking now more especially of the problem of the Old 
Testament it may be said that the people who lived forty or 
fifty years ago had a dogmatic and legalistic theory regarding 
it. They firmly maintained that the Old Testament being a 

constituent part of the Bible, was the word of God in a very 
literal sense, and they as a result, regarded it as the only 
infallible rule of faith and practice. They regulated 

their faith, morals and views of science and history by its 
inspired statements. They spoke with assurance of the 

creation of the soarifit earth in six days. They believed 

that God rested on the seventh day and hallowed it and they 

confidently affirmed that we all came from one pair of individ¬ 
uals who were crested in knowledge, rightousness and holiness. 
They spoke with certainty regarding the fall of Adam, and held 
that all mankind sinned in him and fell with him in his first 
transgression. In our day the situation is vastly different., 

ken are more or less acutely conscious that there is something 

wrong. They claim that the old paths do not lead them to 

any definite goal. They find that the harmonies and analogies 

which formerly gave them so much joy and happiness, no longer 

i 

do so. Many men feel that they are groping in the dark in 

matters of religion. They lack the confidence andconviction 

of those* who have gone before. For the present unrest aid 

uncertainty there is a reason and our present purpose is to 
attempt to find it. 

The Christian Church received the Old Testament from the 
Jewish synagogue. Along with the books, the Church accepted 

the Jewish theory regarding them, and also the Jewish method 


of interpretation.

school, Fhilo a contemporary of Jesus, was the great representative. 
Although he was a keen student of Greek philosophy, Philo was 
also a devoted J-ew and a firm believer in the Old Testament** aJ^^*^***^ 

This was a very difficult under¬ 
taking, because of the fact that the Old Testament is thoroughly 
Semitic and strictly unphilosophic&X, In spite of the many 

difficulties which confronted him Philo met with a certain measure 
of success. His success was largely due to his theory of 

inspiration, which he borrowed in the main from Plato, and to his 
theory of interpretedion which he borrowed mainly from the Stoics. 

s 


Philo believed that inspiration consists in the ecstasy or 
trance. ’'fthile the individual is in this ecstatic condition 
his soul is absolutely passive, and his human qualities and 
characteristics are held in absolute abeyance. As long as 
the soul* remains in this passive state it is. able to receive 
that which the Spirit of God imparts. He who is so inspired 

receives at such a time words of truth directly from God. 

The Old Testament when viewed in this way, as the work of inspired 
prophets, is in the most literal sense of the term God's word# 

Each word is divine. This particular theory of the inspiration 
of the Old Testament gives to it an absolute and divine authority. 

Philo's theory of inspiration goes his method of interpretation 


Any one who has read the Old Testament, even in a superficial|way, 

, „ UtZ- 

will readily admit^there are many things that cannot be taken 


literally * .iven Philo admitted this fact. He asserted however, 

that those sections that could not be taken literally contained 
a hidden meaning, and he contended that the meaning of each passage 
could only be ascertained by means of the allegory. Thehonor, 

if there be any, of devising the allegorical method of interpre¬ 
tation does not belong to Philo. Previous to his time the 

Stoics had employed it in their interpretation of Homer. The 

allegorical method was the recognized way of interpreting sacred 
literature in the time of Philo, To us, living in 

the twentieth century, the allegorical method seems arbitrary.

To them it did not appear so’ It wae the necessary complement 

d (. 

of the accepted theory of inspiration. 

The Christian Fathers of the first and second centuries, 

were men who were Greek thinking and Greek speaking. It was 

quite natural therefore, for them to use the theories and methods 

of Philo, when they took over the Jewish Scriptures. It was 

by means of thea accepted doctrine of inspiration and method 

of interpretation, which Philo had introduced, that the Fathers 

attempted to make the Old Testament intelligible to themselves 

end others. Philo*? doctrine of inspiration, and method of 

int erpreta-t i on served a double purpose. In the first place 

the Fathers^were* able xo satisfy their own particular needs, and 

in the second place they were enabled by means of them to meet 

the attacks of those who were opposed to them as teachers. 

by 

The Fathers were opposed three groups of individuals. .The 

UJ a^Q, 

first group composed of Jews. The Jews on the one hand 

emphasized the binding character of the law and on the other hs.nd 
denied that Jesus was the Messiah, spoken of in the Old Testament. 

The Christian conscience found it very difficult to understand 
the ceremonial law of the time. The result was that the Fathers 

allegorized it in order to make the meaning clearer. In order 

to prove that Jesus was the Messiah, the Fathers referred to the 
wonderful agreement between prophecy and fulfilment. To them 
pxapgh prophecy meant essentially the same as prediction. 

The early Fathers were ardent advocates of the Allegorical method 
of exegesis. This particular method ignored, to all intents 

and purposes, the real meaning of the prophecies and sought to 
interpret them apart from their contexts. 

The Gentiles who formed the second group, denied the claim 
of Christianity to be a universal religion. They claimed that 

it was tooerecent to be universal. They stated, that a universal 
religion should date from the beginning of the world. In reply 
the Fathers said that Christianity was a universal religion and 
that it did date from the beginning of the world. They contended 

that the Old Testament began with the creation, and that it was 
a Christian book. In order to show that it was a Christian 

book, they employed the allegorical method of interpretation, by 
which way alone they claimed that its real meaning could be discovered*

In the third group were the Gnostics and other heretics. 

These individuals claimed that Christianity was not the oldest 
hut the newest faith in the world. They regarded Christianity 

as something absolutely wonderful and unique, and they on that 
account refused to connect it with anything which had gone 
before. These men held a dualistic conception of the universe. 

They made a sharp distinction between the God of the Old Testament 
who formed the world with all its imperfections and the (Absolute 
from whom proceeded Jesus of Nazareth, may quite truth¬ 

fully say that these men made a more or less drastic criticism 
of the Old Testament. They distinguished between the Cod 

of the Old Testament and the Christ of the New Testament and they 
also drew a line of demarcation between the morals of the Old 
Testament .and the morals of the New Testament, 

In the course of time, other conflicts were waged, but in 
the end the Fathers were fairly successful in their attempt to 
prove that the God of the Old Testament was the God of the New^ 
’Chat the Messiah promised in the Old Testament was the Jesus of 
the New, and that the morals of the Old Testament were essentially 
the same as the morals of the New Testament. The Old Testament 

wa* now retained by the Christian Church as a constituent part 
of the Scriptures, Belief in its inspiration was now made 

a fixed dogma, and its authority was regarded as dogmatic and 
final. The Church Fathers achieved their victory by means 

of the allegorical method of interpretation. The position 
they established remained the Orthodox position until the time 
of the Reformation, 

Philo’s theory of inspiration and method of interpretation, 
are for us, wholly unsatisfactory. His theory of inspiration 
is in reality a depersonalized theory, and consequently a non- 
moral theory. It is in truth a great assumption and when we 

look into the Scriptures closely we find that the facts do not 
warrant the assumption. Philo’s method of interpretation 

was a means employed to ascertain the real meaning, intended to 
be conveyed by the various passages of Scripture. He asserted 
that the meaning of the Old Testament was hidden beneath the 
surface of its words, and that the words when taken in their 
natural order, did not convey the real meaning. It is evident

from 'what hap been paid, that one uaing the allegorical method 
of interpretation could never tell when the correct meaning had 
been found. 

For the Allegory ap puch, the Gnostic had no aversion. 

For him the Hew Testament was inspired in the same sense in which 
both Testaments were inspired for the Orthodox believer. The 
Gnostic held, that the New Testament^ had its own hidden meanings, 
and he felt he was just ae wellqualified to give the correct 

A 

interpretation of Scriptures by means of the allegory as were 

the members of the Orthodox school. In the case of Marcion 

* 

the case was hot the same as in the case of those of whom we 
have just spoken. He rejected allegorizing and advocated the 

acceptance of the literal senseof Scripture, Tertullian, 

a shrewd lawyer of the time, saw that the allegory in itself 
was a weak instrument, when compared with the literal sense 
rendering of Marcion. In order that the power and authority 

of the Church might not be weakened, Tertullian asserted, that. 
the only individuals who could correctly interpret passages of 
Scriptures were individuals who belonged to the Church, His 

contention was, that the Church alone was able to give the tstue 
meaning of Scripture, The truth, he stated, had been handed 

down from Christ and his Apostles by an unbroken line of Church 
dignitaries and officials. From the foregoing it can be 

plainly seen that the allegorical method of interpretation, 
which the early Church Fathers borrowed from Philo ultimately 
required the introddction of the authority of the Church, in 
rs, order to maintain its position of supremacy. From the 

time of Tertullian, the authority of Scripture, while still 
final, was more and more reduced to a subordinate position, while 
the Church with the Pope a,t its head became to all intents and 
purposes the ultimate authority. 

The Reformation, while it was a very complex movement, had 
as one of its funddunentals principles the reassertion of the 
Biblical form of Christianity, as opposed to the istl ecclesiastical 
form. The great aim of the Reformers was to restore the 

Bible to its position of authority. They wished the Bible 

to posess a practical as well as a theoretical authority. 

The people were asked to depend directly upon God’s word and not

ppon the advice of priest and Pope. The Reformers saw very 

cleariy that an unintelligible authority can have no practical 
influence. They saw also, that the Bible interpreted allegorically 

conveys no meaning to the ordinary mind. Luther, the great 
Reformation leader sow the fallacy of the contention of Tertullian. 
Luther stated that the Bible should be interpreted in its natural 
sense, that is, that it should be interpreted in the same way 
as any other book. The Reformers thus broke away from the 

Philonic and Patristic methods of interpreting the Scriptures. 

At this point reference must he made to another great move¬ 
ment which influenced greatly the life of the time. This was 
Humanism. Humanism stirred the mind of Europe in the same 

way as the Reformation stirred its heart. As s. result of the 
intellectual movement, known as Humanism, has come the modern 
world with its scientific interests, methods and achievements. 

Possibly the most important feature of the new scientific spirit 

oJL 

was the awakened historic interest. The historian deals 

A 

primarily with documents. When he wishes to give an orderly 

and concise account of ancient life, he refers as often as he 
can to the records which belong to the particular period with 
which he is dealing. The method of interpretation used by 

the Reformers was used in a dogmatic and apologetic way, while 
the method of interpretation employed by the Humanists was used 
in a scientific way. 

Luring the past two or three decades the term “Higher 

Criticism*' has become exceedingly distasteful to a great many 

people. This is very unfortunate, because in nearly every 

case those who denounce it are individuals who have but a very 

slight knowledge of its purpose and scope. ’"Higher Criticism” 

/ 

may be defined as a careful historical and literary study of 

a book to determine its unity^ Age, authorship, literary 

Lot 

form and reliability.” From the definition just given 

can readily see that the Higher Criticism of a book is simply 
a painstaking study of the book, which is made in order to 
secure all the available knowledge concerning it. Higher 
Criticism has also been said to be “The consistent use of the 
reformation principle of interpretation in its humanistic 
formulation, that is as a scientific and not as a dogmatic 
method of interpretation.” The Church has always been

afraid of Higher Criticism^and it is almost needless to say,that 
this fear will remain as long as the dogmatic conception of 
Scripture is held. The Church fails to realize, that in its purity x 
the Higher Criticism of the Old Testament is merely an honest 
inductive study of the facts about the historical revelation of 
God, to determine the way in which God actually proceeded. The 
great controversies, which racked the Protestant Churches in the 
seventeenth and nineteenth centuries, were due to the bitter an¬ 
tagonism which existed between those who held the dogmati c theory 
of Scripture and those who held the scientific theory of Scripture® 
Here it may be well to state that the two methods have nothing in 
commons One must ultimately be superseded by the other® 

W@ must always remember however that whatever criticism 
may do,the Old Testament will always remain the one great book of 
Morality which antiquity has bequeathed ue® The Old Testament is 
not merely a collection of moral aphorisms® It gives evidence 
everywhere of a developing moral sense. The Book deals primarily 
with character. Of all the ancient peoples ,the Jews alone possessed 
the modern sense of sin and in this particular respect the Bible 
is the only ancient book which possesses a really modern ton®. One 
writer has said that the gifted Greeks appear to be but mere children 
when compared with the sober Jews in spiritual matters® lotze the 
philosopher says "that alone among all the religions of the world 
Judaism and Christianity stand out as predominantly ethical, the 
rest are all predominantly "cosmological 

This clear and constantly developing ethical tone to which 
reference has been made previously,ie felt in all portions of the 
Old Testament. We feel it as we read the earliest race traditions® 

We also feel it as we peruse the records of events and as we read 
the poetry and the prophecies® This developing ethical tone,is the 
characteristic which distinguishes the Old Testament from all the 
other books of antiquity. This ethical ton® cannot be accounted 
for by land or climate or race. There were other peoples who shared 
these things with the Jews and yet they were not able to develop 
in the same way as the children of Israel. In a peculiar sense 
God supported and directed this nation and this fact will always 
remain^no matter what the results of criticism may be.

The Bible we must always remember is the most important 
book of religion that has come down to us from antiquity* The 
ancient world had a great many books of religion but the Bible is 
for us the most important of them all. The writers of the Old 
Testament have been the world’s great spiritual and religious leaders. 
The world has seen but one great connected historical development 
and we like to think that this development has reached its culmina¬ 
tion in our twentieth century civilization. To this development 
the ancient world has mad© three great contributions. The Greeks 
have been our teachers in art, literature and nhllosoohy. Th© 

Romans have instructed us in law and jurisprudence and the Hebrews 
have led the way in spiritual matters. One writer has said that 
"even in a higher degree than we ow© art and literature to the 
Greeks^and law to th© Romans do we owe religion to the Jews, The 
Jews have given us the essential elements of religion. They alone^ 
of all the ancient peoples possessed the highest God consciousness. 

The God whom they worshipped was a God of character and integrity. 
Prom the Jews there has come to us the only effective and thoroughly 

ethical monotheism® Th© children of Israel seem to have been the 

of 

only people of the ancient world who were capable that deep insight 
into the lov© and forgiveness of God which almost seems to anticipate 
Christianity, The very greatest of the other nations of the time 
were only able to grope blindly where the Israelites walked w 4 th 
confidence and assurance. When we eomoare the calm confident 
faith of the writer of the Twenty-third Psalm with the esthetic 
uncertain groping of Socrates we see how ?reat were the attain¬ 
ments of the Jews in the realm of "he soirit, Dr, o*ie/Mr* vhtly 
says "The Biblical conception is separated from every other by its 
monotheistic basis, its unique clearness its organic unity, its 
moral character and its teleological air. It does not matter 
for the purposes of this argument what dates we assign to the 
Books of the Old Testament in which these views are found whether

we attribute them with the critics to the ag© of the prpphets 
or to any other* These views are at least there, many centuries 
"before the Christian age began ? and they are found nowhere else 
than on the soil of Israel. This is the singular fact the critic 
has to face,and we cannot profess to wonder that impartially 
studying it ^voices should be heard from the midst of the advanced 
school itself unhesitatingly declaring "Date your books when you 
will this religion is not explicable sawe on the hypothesis 
of Revelation". 

In a very peculiar sens© the Bible Is the record on the one 
hand of the progressive seeking of men after God and on the other 
of the progressive self revelation of the Divin© to men. The 
progressive seeking of the Hebrew prophets after God has many 
profitable lessons for the entire period of the growth of the 
kingdo® of God. Of necessity, we must learn through others. We 
would indeed sustain a great loss were we to dispense with the 
writings of the prophets. The modern philospher emphasizes 
the necessity of carefully studying the History of Philosophy 
and the theologian has ah even greater reason for thoroughly 
acquainting himself with the ancient Men of God. Amos, Hosea, 
Isaiah and Jeremiah are worthy of a place in modern thought ?/hich 
has not as yet been accorded them even by the Church. We must 
depend upon the modern historical study of the Scriptures,to 
give these Hebrew Seers the place in our life and time which they 
so well deserve. 

The Old Testament has value for us today not so much because 

it is a record of the progressive seeking of men after God_,but 

largely because it is a record of God's self reveiation to men. 

It is necessary for us to know and to be able to trace God's 

dealings with men. In this particular connection criticism 

has been a real help. l n the older portion of our Bible w© 

pur© 

see the great value which was placed upon a pxx unsullied 
character. W© read of the intense earnestness of God in His 
work of redemption and of the great love and patience which He 
evinced as He guided the footsteps of His people toward 
righteousness and Himself. The question of the actual self 

revelation of God in the life of Israel is of such great and

vital importance that it has called forth quite a long statement 
from Professor Geofge Adam Smith. The statement is as follows:- 
’’Israel’s Monotheism became indisputable in the centuries from 
the eighth to the sixth B. C. the period of the great Assyrian 
invasions. Before the irresistible Assyrian advance the 
tribal gods of Syria - always identified with the stability of 
their peoples - went dorm one after another and history became 
reduced to a uniformity, analagous to that of nature in the 
Semitic desert. It was in meeting the problems which this state 
of affaire excited that the genius of Israel rose to the grasp 
of the world as a whole,and to faith in a Sovereign Providence. 
This Providence was not the military empire that levelled the 
World; He was not any of the gods of Assyria. He was Israel’s 
own tribal Deity who was known to the world^but as the God 
of the few hills on which His nation hardly maintained herself. 
Fallen she was as her neighbor taunted^ She was by them 
and by her adversaries tossprov© that Jehovah could save her 
any more than th© gods of Mamsth or Damascus or the Philistines 
had saved them; yet both on the eve Af her fall and in her 
deepest abasement Israel affirmed that Jehovah reigned; that 
he was Lord of the hosts of heaven and earth, that Assyria 
was only a tool in His hand. 

my did Israel alone rise to this faith? Why did no 
other of the gods of the Assyrian clans. Baals and Molochs 
take advantage of the opportunity? Why should the people 
of Jehovah alone see a universal Providence in the disasters 
which they shared and ascribe it to Him? The answer to these 
questions is th© beginning of Syria’s supreme rank in th© re* 
ligioug history of mankind. It Is writ beyond all mis¬ 
reading in th© prophets of the time and in th© history of

Israel which preceded the prophets. To use their own phrase 
th© prophets saw "Jehovah exalted in righteousness”. And this, 
was not their invention, it had been implicit in Israel*s con¬ 
ception of Jehovah from a very early age. In what are con¬ 
fessedly ancient documents Jehovah Is the cause of Israel*s 
being of the union of their tribes of their coming to Palestine 
of their instinct to keep separate from other peoples oven when 
they do not seem to have been conscious of a reason why. But 
from the first this influence upon them was ethical. It sifted 
the great body of custom and law^which was their common heri¬ 
tage with all other Semitic tribes; it added to this bith 
mercy and justice, mitigating the cruelty of some laws,when in¬ 
nocent or untried life was in danger, but strenuously enforcing 
others where custom, greed and tyranny had introduced careless¬ 
ness with regard to the most sacred interests of life. W© may 
not always be sure of the dates of these laws but tt is past all 
doubt that the ethical agent at work in them was at work in 
Israel from the beginning^snd was the character the justice,th© 
holiness of Jehovah. But at first it was not in law so much 
as in the events of the people f s history that this character 
impressed them. They knew all along that he had found them, 
chosen them fraught them to the land^borne with them forgiven 
them^redeemed them in His love and in His pity so that though it 
were true that no law had come to them from Him^th© memory of all 
H© had been to them the influence of Himself in their history 
would have remained their distinction among the peopkfes. Even 
in that rude time .His grace had been mightier than His law. On 
such evidence w© believe the assertion of the prophets that what 
had made Israel distinct from her kinsfolk and endowed her alon® 
with the solution of the successive problems of history and with 
her morality was the knowledge of a real Being and intercourse 
with Him. This is what revelation means. Christianity itself 
needs this Old Testament revelation^for if Christ be the true 
and Supreme revelation of God and God is the same God we shall

inevitably argue that there must have been sd&me similar pre¬ 
vious revelation leading up to Christ* The Old Testament makes 
more^not less cred^&ible the Christian revelation* The cul¬ 
minating revelation in Christ^therefore ? doos not make unneces¬ 
sary the earlier stages”* 

From the historical and literary criticism of the Old 
Testament the following gains chiefly of an intellectual nature 
may be noted. In the first place 

Criticism relieves us of the burden of the false a priori 
theories of inspiration. The time will come when we shall be 
thankful that the patient critical study of the Bible has shown 
us that the Bible makes no such claims o fa errorless statement 
on all possible points as our a priori theories claimed for it. 

And furthermore we shall be guarded from serious misapprehensions 
regarding the real nature of the Bible that have led to its re¬ 
jection by many. Attacks such as those which were made by 
Robert Ingersoll and others get their whole point from the assumpt¬ 
ions of an a priori theory of what the Bible must b© if it is to 
b© a hiving revelation* 

In the second place the literary criticism of the books of 
the Old Testament has removed a great many minor difficulties 
which must of necessity have attached themselves to the old 
hypothesis* As soon as people understand the ancient mode of 
eomposition^more especially that of the historical books and as 
soon as people understand that in the present form of a book we 
quite frequently have only the skilful weaving together of 
several accounts more or less parallel^phenomena quite inexpli¬ 
cable on the theory of a single authorship^will be easily ac¬ 
counted for and will cause no difficulty. By means of critical 
analysis* repetitions* lack of classification, minor incon¬ 
sistencies, different styles and points of view are more easily 
explained. More serious difficulties also such as the relation 
of the Hexateuch to the other books of the Old Testament^more 
particularly the prophets are in a large measure overcome. One 
writer has said that the critical analysis of the Old Testament 
especially of the Hexateuch has helped historic cred\\ibility 
in two ways. In the first place it has done so^by showing as 

Professor Briggs says^that we have four parallel narratives

instead of the single natrativ© of the traditional theory. In 
the second place it has done so by tracing these narratives to 

their sources in the more ancient documents buried in them. 

If Christianity really rests upon a foundation which is 
Biblical^it need hardly be said that anything which brings us 

to a more perfect intellectual understanding^of the way in which 
it was produced will ultimately help us to employ it in the 
highest spiritual sense. Christianity is a religion to which 
rational men subscribe freely. It appeals to the whole man. 

The w&ol© truth concerning the Bible, if it ever be ascertained, 
will increase rather than diminish the power of Christianity. 

We cannot pass over lightly the critical results which have al¬ 
ready been obtained. The one great lesson of scientific re¬ 
search in every field is that ml element of truth can be safely 
ignored. If Christianity be a Biblical religion^then it 
follows that it is impossible for us to know the Bible too well 
from any point of view. It is beyond all reasonable doubt 
that the minute historical^and literary study of the Bible 

which has been occasioned by Higher Gritieism^has greatly in- 

% 

creased our knowledge of the phenomena of the Bible at very 
many points. It is not too much to say^that the difficulties 
of Higher Criticism would largely disappear if the members of 
the Church could be induced to make a careful inductive study 
of the Bible^book by book. 

If one generation b© more strongly marked than any of the 
preceding generations by the spirit of historical investigation, 
then in just the degree in which Christianity is historical 
should this generation be able to have a better appreciation 
of Christianity and a firmer gripp upon a historical presentat¬ 
ion of the revelation of Godsuch. as critical analysis has mad© 
possible* Men everywhere are being moved by the critical 
spirit. In every case they desire to know what really 
happened® They desire to reproduce in every inquiry the actual 
historical setting. To our generation it is quite evident

that the greatest moral appeal must always come through persons. 
We realize very fully,that the one great road to character is 
not found by those who delight in intellectual formulizing nor 
is it found by those who revel in moralizing^it is found by 
those who earnestly endeavor to catch the spirit of the best. 

The appeal f>f the historical , the appeal of the real and the 
appeal of the personal^are all felt very keenly by our gener¬ 
ation and their respective appeals are made stronger by the 
results of criticism. In our time the historical development 
of the revelation of God can be traced with a certainty which 
was never possible before. Before our mind8,w© can picture 
the actual historical situation in the various periods as no 
preceding age was able tomdo and because of this w© can make 
Bible more intensely personal than it has ever been pre¬ 
viously, Our increased knowledge enables ue to have a very 
clear conception of the precis© situation which confronted 
Amos and Hogea. We can see their problems and trace their 
motives and we are drawn by the spirit of these ancient men in 
a way which is marvellous. Until recent times the prophecies 
of the Old Testament have been unintelligible to a great 
many people® Fortunately, critical study has thrown many 
rays of light upon a number of the dark places and as a re¬ 
sult many of our misconceptions have been cleared away. 

At this stage we may quit© truthfully and fear¬ 
lessly say that the historical interpretation of the Old 
Testament is the only possible one for the most enlightened 
people of our day. 

The knowledge which Higher Criticism has brought ue, 
enables us to know more certainly Just what revelation meant 
to those to whom it first came. In the Old Testament w© 
came into fellowship with the real God who created the world 
and who acts in the real course of history. This God of whom 
the older portion of our Bill© speaks is not a dream God^an

imaginary God or a God of mystic contemplation* He is the real 
God of real life. He is the God whom Israel discerned* The 
supreme task of the Old Testament is to quicken us Tby the faith 
and vision of God which the old seers had. They had limitat¬ 
ions it is true^but in spite of these they enable us to see for 
ourselves in the History of Israel the presence of God, 

The critical analysis of the Old Testament has produced 
the following positive results for theology. In the first place 
this exhaustive historical and literary study of the phenomena 
of the Bible^involved in Higher Criticism has brought out into 
clear prominence the one great purpose of the Bible^in absolute 
agreement with Paul's own clear statement^that it is neither 
science nor history but simply a record of the historical self 
revelation of God to a single people and thus to all msn looking 
always to the winning of men into a character like that of God. 

It must be born© in mind however that even in the historical 
books of the Bible the writers ar© not interested in strict 
scientific history^any more than in some other books they are 
interested in science. The Old Testament writers select only 
those incidents that can be used to illustrate some truth. They 
make no attempt to trace all the causal connections* their chief 
concern Is to show what both nature and history mean for re¬ 
ligion. They attempt to show how God reveals Himself in them. 

And because they devoted themselves to this one task ^they cannot 
be designated the world's teachers in either ecience^history or 
law. They achieved their greatness in the realm of the spirit. 

In the second place the results of the critical analysis of the 
scriptures demand from us a much fuller recognition of the prin¬ 
ciple of progress in revelation. This progress can be seen in 
every part of the Old Testament* in the historical 3)ivin§p.leading* 
in the books of the prophets^and in the legislative codes and 
institutions and ideas of the people. To admit that there has 
been progress in revelation^implies that all earlier stages have 
been relatively imperfect and that Christ is the absolute and 
final standard both in the Bible and out of it. Frankly mjist 
we admit yfchat the moral and religious teachings of the Old 
Testament are not for us absolutely authorative. As Christians

we believe in a progressive revelation culminating in Christ and 

Christ thus becomes for us our ultimate standard by which all that 
has gone before must be tested. y 0 mug ^ candidly admit,that the 

perfect revelation of the Divine is not found in the earlier por¬ 
tions of the book. No part of the Old Testament was written in 
the full light of the Christian revelation and we must therefore 
judge this portion of the volume by the standard set up by Christ, 
if we are to make any appreciable progress towards truth. We do 
not for one moment wi&h to imply by the foregoing statement that 
we can dispense with the ancient scriptures. It must ever be 
borne in mind that it is the principle of the progress of revelat¬ 
ion which enables us to make the best us© of the Old Testament. 

In the third place } our more careful Biblical study hai 
helped us to a more spiritual view of inspiration. We have com© 
to realize that there is no mechanical unity in the Bible. The 
various writers show individual reflections of a religious ex¬ 
perience, more or lees common to them. Our modern Biblical study 
of the New Testament gives us the opinions of individual men 
concerning Christ. No one view, no single expression of the life 
of Christ can satisfy the deepest spiritual needs of all. The 
work of Christ is deeper and broader and nobler than any single 
account of it would lead us to believe® If this fact be recognized, 
there is hope not only of a reasonable freedom for theology, but 
of greater growth, as well as a better appreciation of the New 
Testament as a whole. What has been said regarding the New 
Testament in this particular respect is true also of the Old 
Testament but not to as great an extent. In the fourth place the 
newer historical view of the Bible, in the very nature of the cae© 
does not allow the theologian of today to us© the scriptures in 
the same way as his predecessors used them. H© must frankly 
admit that he does not feel free to place all portions of the 
Bible on the same level. The modern theologian has no use for 
proof texts in the old dogmatic sense. He realizes that the 
older systems with their vast numbers of proof texts had a 
tendency to be speculative. He prefers that which is really 
Biblical ^to that which is superficially Biblical.

In the fifth place Higher Criticism necessitates a re 
statement of the doctrine of inspiration because of the fact that the 
older views were a priori* not formed in full view of the actual 
phenomena of the Bible. An inductive study of the facts concerning 
the Bible is the only legitimate one for the thinking people of our 
time. The original revelation of God was manifested in His actual 
historical dealings with His people. When viewed in this way^the 
Bible is seen to he more strictly ? a record of revelation rather than 
the primitive revelation itself. In every case the Biblical as¬ 
sumption is that th© living God comes into vital contact with men of 
flesh and blood, living men. The meetings of God and men of which 
the scriptures speak involve no suppression of the human^but rather 
the fullest use of it. Dr. Matheson expresses it in the following 
words"Such is the leading idea of Christian inspiration - th© 
growth of the Diving through the capacities of the humanThe Bible 
is never satisfied with a purely mechanical result. The statement 
of the most absolute truth if it conveyed no meaning to the man who 
uttered it or if it had not grown out of the living experience of 
God^of those who heard it^as far as th© Bible is concerned a result of 
no importance. Manifestly^the aim is not to have certain words spoken 
or certain acts done } but to make godly and righteous men. In each 
case ^God inspires the life and the individual speaks or writes out 
of this experience. This experience being peculiarly hi^ own^is 
necessarily limited by th© attainments he has already made. The 
steps of th© Christian life are never taken by God alone or by man 
alone, they ©re always taken by God and men together. 

After his great confession Christ said to Peter "Blessed art 
thou Simon Bar Jonah for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto 
the© byt My Father which is in Heaven". The context from which the 
foregoing statement is taken^seems to imply that in the case of 
Peter the revelation had been a growing one* growing upon him during 
the days of his close association with the Master and producing as 
the days went by a deepening conviction of the Messiahship of Jesus. 
And this revelation it should be remembered did not clear his mind 
of a misconception regarding another very important point as the 
narrative very clearly indicates. It was not the desire of Christ 
to secure from Peter a mechanically errorless statement .

was to 'bring the disciple to an honest personal following of Him¬ 
self for what He in Himself was^and as the result of a clear con¬ 
viction growing out of his own personal experience. 

God began with the Children of Israel at the point where they 
were. Every revelation requires a response, if there be no response 
there has not been a revelation. A revelation to possess value 
must impel man forward to grasp the truth given. .God did not 
set aside the customs^ forms of observance > and worship which the 
Children of Israel possessed in common with other members of the 
Semitic race. The people were permitted to retain them^but they 
were purified, given new motives and sanctions^and placed on a 
vastly different religious basis. This was true in the ease of 
feasts, sacrifices, circumcision and laws* We are all aware that 
a growing revelation is only possible^in the ease of a man whose 
mind is developingjand vhose outlook upon life is widening. It 
is only by degrees^that a man comes into that experience of life 
out of which he can interpret the revelation which has been given 
him. This is very true in the case of children*, It is a foolish 
policy which leads parents to anticipate the years^by telling 
their children beforehand the deeper things of life. Every revel¬ 
ation to b® intelligible to men must b© couched in forms of human 
thought and language. It is absolutely impossible to avoid the 
human element } and even if it were possible to do soothe aim of all 
revelation - the growth of the man - would be left out. God’s 
chief purpose is not the dictation of ideal propositions but the 
education of men. Men learn but slowly^but this does not dis¬ 
prove the statement that God is ever teaching them. In the ear¬ 
lier stages of the life of every nation imperfect conceptions of 
God and crude morals are found. This was true in the case of the 
Children of Israel, Goafs chosen people. For us 3 the Bible 
possesses authority not as a book^but as a revelation # not because 
it has been canonized but because it contains the history of the 
life of the Redeemer and of our redemption.

This account of the life of the Redeemer^and of our redemotion^ 
its long preparation and development ? has become more convincing amu 
appealing.,as a result of Historical Criticism. The Criticism of the 
Old Testament should brinp it manifestly closer to men, to life.and to 
history. In the course of time when scholars shall have gathered to¬ 
gether the full results of the critical, his tori.cal and literary study 
of the Old Testament we shall have in our possession an ordered and vivid 
conception of the progress of the Divine revelation^in all its parts., that 
will make the Old Testament more realtor© rational more personal^and 
more vital^than it has ever been before. This new conception will in 
the process of time secure a constantly deepening hold upon the imagina¬ 
tion /heartland life. In view of the great progress,which has already 
been made^we may confidently hope that the best teaching and the best 
preaching of the great truths of the Bible,that the world has ever seen^ 
have yet to b© witnessed. 

The following gains accrue from such a conception of the 
insoiration of the Bible. In the first place it agrees with the highest 
Christian conception^ of the relation of God and men. In the second 
place It makes even more real ,the Divine element in the Bible affirming 
on increasingly clear historical grounds^the objective reality of a 
unique Divine revelation to Israel and accenting the testimony of the 
prophetic consciousness as scientifically trustworthy. In the third 
place this particular view of inspiration does not In the slightest 
degree evade the full human element. And furthermore,it is capable of 
bringing lt y lnto its conception even when plainly wrong. In the fourth 
place such a view of inspiration brings harmony into all the methods 
of God. It regards them as progressive and adaptive. It brings the 
methods of God in the Old Testament into essemtial agreement with His 
method in the Hew Testament and at the present time,and gives us a 
conception^in which we may rest as justified ,in the presence of all the 
facts. Undoubtedly, the time will come^when we shall be grateful that 
the phenomena of the Bible as certained by patient study,compelled us 
to revise our statement of the doctrine of inspiration and to eliminate 
from it that which was mechanical. 

To us,who are living In the twentieth century^ the Old Testa¬ 
ment reveals the following thoughts. In the first ulsee it indicates 
to us with growing clearness the consciousness of God ag one holy, 
personal. Being,the righteous Creator ,and Controller of the universe. 

It is a task which is intensely interesting,to trace the mrowth of th-*s

faith from the time when Moses declared to his oeo^le that Jehovah In 
His grace and pity had chosen them for Himself 3 to the time when the 
final results of that choice were disclosed to the world a Our 
acquaintance with the Old Testament has taught us the truth of the 
following statement found in the Jewish prayer book, "He is One and 
there is no second to compare to Him^to consort with Him; without 
beginning^ without end^ to Him belong strength and dominion - and He 
is my God - my Redeemer liveth'and a rock in my travail^in time of 
distress ? and He is my banner and my refuge - the portion of my cup on 
the day when I call." In the second place the Old Testament has given 
us the true meaning of holiness. In tracing out this idea^we of 
necessity have a long and intricate story to unravel. We pass through 
the stage where a man is regarded not as a person but as an appendage 
to some one else, the subject to the ruler^th® child to the father^ the 
wife to the husband ? the slave to the master. We observe the time when 
no clear line was drawn between the ritual and the moral. We read of 

things done in the name of God,by those who thought that they had His 

* 

warrant for their actions which we today following the evaraile of 
Christ condemn as belonging to an age of darkness and hardness of heart 
We must not however be unmindful of the fact,that those who knew Him 
best^declared that His real demands were for uprightness of character 
and brotherly kindness. Amoe proclaimed God’s judgment against the 
surrounding nations for crimes against common humanity. Israeli en¬ 
treated for justice for the poor and helpless, Jeremiah had a very 
deep sense of the origin of evil in the heart and its need of cleansing 
and the Psalmists saw ver^ clearly that Jehovah desired truth in the in 
ward parts. From the Old Testament^we learn that religion and morality 
are inseparably bound together. For us,today the prophet^ summary of 
duty "to do justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with thy God" 
is our ideal and goal. 

In the third place we find in the Old Testament seriotures the 
growing sens© of need,that Jehovah Himself should intervene and raise 
men up to fellowship with Himself for which they had been created 
and which no sacrifices, ritual or personal endeavors had been able to 
secure for them. The "Messianic Hope" of the Old Testament is seen in 
the yearnings for the righteous King of David's line; it is seen in 
Jeremiah's vision of the time when God’s law should be written on the 
tables of the heart and all people should know Him. This longing was

Intensified as the problem of human suffering became greater and the 
hope was entertained that in some way through the undeserved oain of 
the righteous,the Kingdom of Sod would be ushered in# The same 
"Messianic Hope" is seen in Daniel's vision of the Kingdom of the 


Saints coming with the clouds of heaven. We cannot fairly say^th&t the 


Old Testament does not call aloud for a fuller manifestation of Sod* 

Our ideas of God^of man^and of God's reign^we may quite correctly say 
come to us from the pages of the Old Testament. Some one has well said 
that "they have become so familiar to the religious thought of Western 
civilization that it is difficult to realize their greatness until we 
remember^, that our very familiarity with them^is a spiritual debt to 
Israel through Christianity,and the best proof of their epoch making 
significance• 

As we turn from the Old Testament to the New Testament w© ar© 
immediately struck with the us® made by Jesus of the Old Testament. The 
Old Testament was His strong weapon of defence against the attacks of 
the enemy. In every solemn crisis of His life He turned to it for heir. 
At the time of His baptism the revelation was conveyed by means of 
Old Testament words® Both in the garden of Gethsemane^and on the cross ? 
He expressed the anguish of His deepest nature by means of the words of 
the stricken Psalmists. His God ? was the God of the Old Testament® He 


enriched the Old Testament conception of God however by 


universal Fatherland of the Almighty. In His eyes the Holy one of 
Israel was the loving and gracious Father of all mankind. He swept 
away every thought of righteousness which fell below the highest ethical 


standard 


& 


He probed into the places where sin lurked^He sternly 


denounced it. He claimed to b© the Messiah^and stated that with His 


coming the Kingdom became a present reality^etven although its con¬ 
summation lay in the future. In the Old Testament scriptures our Lord 
found the prophecy of His own mission. His words to the disciples of 
John the Baptist pointed back to the glowing picture of the thirty- 
fifth chapter of Is-ra^r!-, ^nd when He aoolled to John the words of 
Malachi^and called him the messenger^who was to ^orenare the way, He saw 
in His own coming > God , s visitation of His p©0'*>le»-44=th-His anuearance

xd^rthe intervention of Sod a a^ibng-daol gad had beco m e ac tual 

Jesus, however, did not hesitate to cast aside that which was 
but temporary,in the older dispensation. The ancient law spoken in the 
name of Jehovah said "an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth" but

Jesus at His coming introduced the rule of love and forgiveness. The 
older scriptures distinguish very clearly between clean and unclean 
food 3 and day down particular laws for the guidance of the people. Jesus 
brushed these aside, and taught the people that defilement comes from 
within and not from without. Jesus realized very clearly,that a great 
deal of the Old Testament had its origin in very primitive times. He ever 
turned away from detaiIsland bade His hearers search for the deeper 
principles with which the Old Testament abounds, Paul like Christ brushed 
aside the ritual law and prided himself on his freedom from it. He like 
his master looked for the spirit and not for the letter. 

The modern preacher in order to be successful must follow in 
the footsteps of Christ. He must emphasize principles, He must interpret 
for his people the great fundamental verities of the spirit, and he 
must endeavor to enthuse them with the spirit of the ancient seers of 
Israel. The tendency today is to stress the great truths of life,rather 
than the various shades of meaning which various words may oossess. The 
task of the minister is to apply to the life of his time the principles 
which raise men to higher and nobler things. In hie treatment of the Old 
and Hew Testaments,h© should be fair and just. His knowledge of the 
scriptures should be accurate and scientific,and his constant aim in life 
should be to educate his hearers in the matters of the spirit. To all 
people a universal and not a local view of life should be given and to 
this great work of training and instructing people 9 the.minister is called 
in no uncertain tone. He must be a man of wide sympathies and clear 
intellect, a leader of men.
