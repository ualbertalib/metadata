CHAPTER I 


PURPOSE OP THIS INVESTIGATION 

The purpose of this study is, primarily, to determine 
the degree of correlation existing between scores on the Moss 
Aptitude Test for Medical Schools made by premedical students 
and their success measured in terms of scholastic achievement 
in the four years of medical work at the University of 
Alberta* 

The Moss Aptitude Test was developed by a committee 
under the direction of Dr. E. A. Moss, Columbia Medical 
Building, Washington, D.C. The work of the committee is 
sponsored by the Association of American Medical Colleges. 

If a limited number of medical students must be 
chosen from among many applicants, the schools want to 
choose the most promising. Even where limitation of numbers 
is not urgent, it would still be desirable to identify and 
refuse admission to those applicants who are certain to fail 
in the medical course. Scientific selection of students 
would greatly reduce the time, money, and effort involved 
when students fail. The elimination of unsatisfactory 
students would enable the medical schools to give better 
tuition to those who are admitted. 

One source of difficulty is the confusion between 
the problem of selecting individuals who will be successful 
as medical students, and the problem of selecting those who 
will be successful as doctors. There is no clear cut basis

for distinguishing "between good and poor doctors. Annual 
income, prestige in the profession, or opinion of patients 
cannot be used as scientific criteria of differentiation* 

There is, however, an objective criterion of success in 
medical school, namely, academic grades* This investigation 
concerns a method which aims to select individuals who will 
be successful medical students* 

In this study, the records of six successive classes 
entering the University of Alberta from 1934 to 1939 were 
used. When this investigation was begun, the first two 
classes had had time to complete their four years of medicine. 
In all, the records of 211 who have taken the Aptitude Test 
for Medical Schools are included. However, only 129 of 
these completed first year medicine. The rest took the 
test and then failed to enter or dropped out during the 
first year. 

During these years, 1934 to 1939, students were 
admitted to the medical school at the University of Alberta 
on the basis of academic standing and of personal interviews 
by the Dean or other member of the Faculty of Medicine. 

Results obtained by^ students on the Medical Aptitude Test 
were not used for admission purposes. 

At the outset it must be admitted that this study 
concerns a relatively small number of students, nevertheless, 
the results are presented for whatever value may be derived 
from them.

CHAPTER II 


MATERIALS, SUBJECTS, AND METHODS 
Materials - The Test 

Object of the Test «- The Aptitude Test for Medical 
Schools was designed for one purpose, namely, to predict 
whether a given student will be able to complete the full 
course in medical school. If the test fulfils its objective, 
then it would be of considerable help in selecting medical 
students. 

The test is distinctly a scholastic aptitude test. 

No claim has been made that it will measure how well a 
student will succeed in his medical career after finishing 
school. 

Hi story of the Test .- Before the test was used, 
the failure rate of students in medical schools in the 
United States was excessively high. In 1927, sixteen of 
the graduating class of seventy-two in one medical school 
failed, and inasmuch as the students who failed were unable 
to utilize the very expensive training which they had 
received, it was considered unfair not only to them, but also 
to the taxpayers to let such a condition exist. On further 
examination it was found that there were apparently twice as 
many students applying for admission to the various medical 
schools each year as there were places for them, and it was 
clear that if some means could be devised to aid in the

selection of the best 50 per cent it would be advantageous 
to all concerned. 

After more than a year of experimental work in one 
medical school under the supervision of Dr. IP. A. Moss 
arrangements were made in 1988 to extend the experiment 
to fourteen other medical schools, and in the next year 
to seventy. At the annual meeting of the Association of 
American Medical Colleges in 1930 the Moss Aptitude Test 
was adopted on an experimental basis by the Association 
as a normal requirement for entrance. The Moss Aptitude 
Test for Medical Schools is sponsored and administered by 
the Association of American Medical Colleges. 

In the early experiments, the test was given to 
students shortly after they entered medical school. 
Correlations were then made between the test scores of 
students and corresponding grades for the freshman year 
to determine the predictive value of the test. Beginning 
with 1931, however, all the tests were given in premedical 
schools. After the test papers v/ere graded and tabulated, 
the results ?/ere sent to the admission officers of medical 
schools to be used as possible aids in the selection of 
students. 

Numbers Taking the Test .- Since 1928, when the test 
was first used, a different form of the test has been given 
each year. It is assumed that the different forms of the 
test are of equal difficulty. During the time that the test 
has been used, there has been an increase in the number of 










5 


students taking the test. Table I shows the number of 
tests given each year since the work was started. It is 
noted that the number of tests given the last six years 
has stabilized around 10,500 tests a year.

While there has been a slight decrease in the last 
years in the number of tests given, there has been a steady 
increase in the percentage of students in medical schools

who have taken the test. It would thus appear that an 
increasing amount of attention is being given to the test 
by the admission officers of most of the medical schools. 
Figure 1 shows the percentage of freshmen entering medical 
schools who have taken the Medical Aptitude Test.

Test 1 was designed to measure how well a student 
could understand and retain the principal facts in a 
passage on inflammation such as he would find in the usual 
course in Pathology in medical school. After he had 
studied this passage for fifteen minutes, he was required 
to answer forty questions in true-false form about it. The 
fifteen minutes gave him time to read the passage over at 
least two or three times. Other things being equal, it 
would seem logical that those who learn such a passage best 
under these conditions would also learn similar passages 
best in the normal medical course. 

Tests 2 and 3, like Test 1, were based on the 
student’s ability to learn specific material in a given 
length of time. In this instance he had an anatomical 
drawing with a written discussion of it. The drawing was 
similar to those the student would meet in the first term 
of the course in anatomy. The tests were designed to 
measure his ability to visualize and remember anatomical 
relationships. There were 25 points on visual memory and 
25 points on memory for content of the written discussion 
of the drawing. 

Test 4 contained a short selection measuring the 
student’s ability to recognize words that were spelled 
incorrectly. 

Test 5 was designed to measure the student’s 
ability to draw logical conclusions from a given set of 
data. Much of his future work in medicine would depend

on such ability. 

Test 6 was'a specialized intelligence test based 
on the student’s knowledge of premedical work and his 
general reading and information. It is only logical that 
the more familiar the student is with medical and. 
scientific terms, the more likely he will be to succeed 
in the medical course. Moreover, if he has had an interest 
in medicine, one would expect him to have done some general 
reading along that line, and to have picked up, aside from 
his premedical course, a certain amount of information as 
indicated in his vocabulary. This test of 90 items gave a 
fairly good indication of the student’s background, interest, 
and specialized knowledge in this scientific field. 

Test 7 was designed to measure a student’s ability 
to understand very difficult printed material when he had 
it constantly before him. In this instance, a passage such 
as he would find in any course in Physiology in medical 
school was selected. He had plenty of time to read the 
passage over and then refer to it as often as he wished in 
answering the ten questions. If he were unable to under¬ 
stand the passage, the chances are he will not understand 
similar passages in connection with his medical course. 

There is one element, however, to be considered 
in connection with this last test. Inasmuch as it was on 
the last sheet, the student who is by nature very slow may 
have consumed so much time on the other tests that he would 
not do himself justice on this particular test. In general,

the student who is slow will also he handicapped when he 
gets to medical school, because in the medical curriculum as, 
probably, in no other professional course, the student is 
so loaded with material, that if he is extremely slow he 
will find it impossible to master the work* While the series 
of tests which make up the Medical Aptitude Test as a whole 
are not designed as speed tests, it is inevitable that the 
rate of learning should be a factor in determining the 
final score. Also, while the assignments in the medical 
course are not designed to force the average student to 
work faster than his normal rate, it is inevitable that the 
slow student would have to work faster than his normal rate 
in order to keep up with the medical assignments. In other 
words, if one student can learn a given assignment in two 
hours, whereas it takes another four hours to learn the 
same assignment, it is quite obvious that the fast learner 
will have twice as much time to put on his other assignments 
as will the slow student.

Test 1, as the name implies, was designed to 
measure a student’s general cultural background* It con¬ 
sisted of selected items from the fields of History, 

Literature, Government, General Science, Economics, Sports, 
and Transportation. In addition, certain items designed to 
measure Social Intelligence, or the student’s ability to get 
along with others, were included. This was the first year 
in which this type of test was included. It met the wide¬ 
spread demand from many admission officers that some part 
of the Medical Aptitude Test should indicate the cultural 
background of the student as contrasted with the more 
technical which he would get in his required premedical 
training in Biology, Chemistry, and Physics. 

Test 2 was a specialized intelligence test similar 
to Test 6 on Form 7. 

Test 5 was a spelling test similar to Test 4 on Form 7. 

Test 4 was a test on logical reasoning similar to 
Test 5 on Form 7. 

Test 5 was designed to measure a student’s ability 
to understand very diffieult printed material when he had 
it constantly before him, as in Test 7 on Form 7. However, 
the amount of material was double the amount on Form. 7. 

Two passages were chosen, one from Pharmacology and one 
from Obstetrics.

studied it for thirty minutes. At the end of that time

On Form 13 the test measuring the student’s general 


cultural background was substituted by Test 4 which was 
primarily a premedical information test. As a result of a 
special study of the predictive value of individual items 
on former tests, it was found that questions taken directly 
from the premedical sciences have a much higher selective 
value than do general cultural questions based on a knowledge

Subjects 

The records of six successive classes entering the 
University of Alberta from 1934 to 1939 were used. During 
that time 211 students took the test. However, only 129 
completed first year medicine. The rest failed to enter 
medical school or dropped out during the first year. 

The 129 cases used in this study were classified 
as follows: 

(a) 33 who completed 4 jrears of medicine, 

(b) 30 who completed 3 years of medicine, 

(c) 32 who completed 2 years of medicine, 

(d) 34 who completed 1 year of medicine. 








15 


Group (a) entered medical school in 1934 and 1935, 
group (b) in 1936, group (c) in 1937, and group (d) in 1938. 

The total numbers who wrote each form of the test 
in the United States and Canada are also included in this 
study. They are as follows: 

(a) Those who wrote Form 7 in 1934 - 10569 

(b) Those who wrote Form 8 in 1935 - 10671 

(c) Those who wrote Form 9 in 1936 - 10853 

(d) Those who wrote Forms 10 & 11 in 1937 - 10755 

(e) Those who wrote Form 12 in 1938 - 10411 

Methods 

In determining the predictive value of the Moss 
Aptitude Test for Medical Schools various methods have 
been used. 

The average marks obtained by students on first 
year medicine, the first two years of medicine, the first 
three years of medicine, and on four years of medicine v/ere 
correlated with the corresponding Medical Aptitude Test 
scores. Further, the average marks of students in each of 
the four years of medicine were correlated with their 
Medical Aptitude Test scores. Finally, the average marks 
for the four years of medicine of the group entering in 1934 
and the group entering in 1935 were correlated separately 
with the Aptitude Test scores, the average marks for three 
years of medicine for the 1936 group were correlated with

test scores, and the average marks for two years of 
medicine for the 1937 group were correlated with the test 
scores. 

The correlation formula used was: 

r = — iz z Cx Cy 

<Tx <7y 

To test the significance of correlation coefficients 
the theory of small samples was applied. Using the formula 

t = — 7 = ==— • i/n - 2 . where r - correlation 

A - r 2 

coefficient, n - the number of subjects, and 
t = Fisher’s t; and by use of Fisher’s Table for t the 
probability that such a correlation would occur by random 
sampling from an uncorrelated population was calculated. 

If this probability v/orked out to be low ( less than 0.05 ) 
the correlation was regarded as significant* 

A study was then made of the distribution of all 
test scores. The range of marks, medians, etc. made by the 
University of Alberta students were compared with those made 
by the total number who wrote the test. 

The frequenc:/ of failures in courses ( marks below 
60% ) was compared with the Aptitude Test scores. 

The medical school performance of those who had 
completed first year medicine and of those who had completed 
second year medicine was compared with the corresponding 










17 


Aptitude Test scores. 

When the test score results were submitted to the 
University of Alberta by the Association of American Medical 
Colleges, total scores, scores on each part of the test, and 
percentile ratings were given. The percentile rating in¬ 
dicated the relative standing of the student as compared 
with the total number who took the test. Jot the last years 
the number taking the test has been about 10,500,on each 
form. • 

Since the number writing the test at the University 
of Alberta was relatively small, these percentile ratings 
were now compared with the scholastic performance in first 
year medicine, in second year medicine, and in the first 
two years of medicine. 

The students were then classified according to 
their achievement in medical school to see how the best 
and poorest students in medical school fated on the 
Aptitude Test. 

A study was made of the Medical Aptitude Test 
scores of those who entered medical school at the 
University of Alberta as compared with the scores of 
those who wrote the test at the U.of A. and did not enter. 

Lastly, Medical Aptitude Test scores and 
scholastic achievement were compared with achievement on 
the Thurstone Psychological Examination. 

Since the total possible score on each form of the

Test scores were reduced to percentages for this study. 

All university marks were also reduced to percentage

Throughout this study the subjects have been 
divided at times into ten. groups according to 
performance. The lowest tenth was taken as those who 
rated below the first decile, the second tenth between 
the first and second decile, and so on.

Distribution of Total Scores 

•A study was next made of the range of marks, medians 
etc. made by the total number of students writing the test 
with the range of marks, medians, etc. made 'by the students 
who wrote the same form of the test in the same year at the 
University of Alberta. Of the 211 who wrote the test at 
the University of Alberta 82 either failed to complete the 
first year of medicine or did not enter medical school at 
this university. 

During the year 1934-35 10569 students were tested 

in 615 colleges throughout the United States and Canada on 
Form 7 of the test. At the University of Alberta 39 
students wrote the test and their total scores ranged from 
29$ to 69$. The median score was 48$, one half of those 
taking the test falling above this and one half below. The 
mean was 47.9$. The highest quarter made above 52.5$; the 
lowest quarter below 42.5$. Unfortunately, the medians, etc 
for the total group writing this form of the test are not 
available. 

During the year 1935-36 10671 students were tested 

on Form 8 in 628 colleges. The median score was 59.2$. The 
highest quarter made above 69.2$; the lowest quarter below 
48.4$. At the University of Alberta 30 students wrote the 
test and made total scores ranging from 32$ to 86$. The 
median score was 48$. The highest quarter made above 57$; 
the lowest quarter below 41$. The mean was 50$.

Comparison of Scholastic Achievement with Medical Aptitude 

Test Scores 

The medical school marks of the three largest groups 
(one year of medicine, two years of medicine, and second 
year of medicine) were compared with the corresponding 
M.A. scores. The cases were divided into ten equal groups 
on the basis of their percentage scores on the Medical 
Aptitude Test. Tables VI, VII, and VIII show medical 
school performance at various test score levels for those 
who have completed one or two years of medicine.

Comparison between Percentile Ratings on Medical Aptitude 
Test and Scholastic Achievement 

The percentile rating given a student is based upon 
his performance in comparison with the total number who wrote 
the test at the same time. (e.g. In 1935-36 10671 wrote 

Porm 8 of the test.) Each year a new fdrm was used and it 
is assumed that a student writing on one particular form 
would attain a percentile rating which would be very close 
to the percentile rating he would receive if he had written 
any one of the other forms. 

Tables IX, X, and XI show the medical school 
performance of various groups at the University of Alberta 
in comparison with their percentile rating on the M.A* test.

Medical Aptitude Test Scores of those who entered Medical 
School as compared with those who did not enter 

It may be of interest to compare the Aptitude Test 
scores of students admitted to medical school at the 
University of Alberta in the years 1934 to 1938 with the 
scores of those who took the test but did not enter. 

In 1934 the average M.A. Test score of all those 
admitted to medical school was 48.5%. The average of all 
those tested was 47.9%; the average of those who did not 
enter was 46.6%. The corresponding figures for the years 
1935 to 1938 are shown in Table XIV.

Medical Aptitude Test Scores and Scholastic Achievement of 
Students in Terms of Achievement on the Thurstone Psycho- 
logical Examination 

-A study was made of the first and second year medical 
groups to determine what relationship, if any, existed between 
the Thurstone Psychological Test results and M.A, Test scores 
and scholastic achievement. The Psychological Test scores 
were taken from the records at the University of Alberta, 

On the basis of results obtained on the Thurstone Psycho¬ 
logical Test, the students were given ratings from 1 to 10,

CHAPTER IV 


ANALYSIS OE DATA 
Correlations 

It is seen from Table III that all the correlation 
coefficients are low, except where the average marks for the 
1935-36 class on four years of medicine were correlated with 
the corresponding Medical Aptitude Test scores. Here the 
correlation coefficient is 0.53. However, the number of 
cases is only 15, which may account for the figure obtained. 
Where the number of cases is larger, i.e. 95 and 129, the 
correlation coefficients are lower. 

By using Fisher’s t, it was found that the correl¬ 
ation coefficients were barely significant where M.A. Test 
scores were correlated with average marks for 3 years of 
medicine ( N - 63, r - 0.25 ), and with the 1935 class 
averages for 4 years of medicine ( N - 15, r - 0.53 ), 
since P in each case was 0.04. The correlation was 
significant where M.A. Test scores were correlated with 
results for one year of medicine ( N - 129, r - 0.22 ) 
since P was found to be 0.015. A definite significance 
was found for the correlations between M.A. Test scores 
and academic results for 2 years of medicine ( N - 95, 
r - 0.33 ), and second year medicine ( N - 95, r - 0.33 ), 

Por both these two correlations the probability 
coefficient was found to be 0.001. This includes the three 
largest groups tested where the number of cases was 95 and 129.

It would seem that if a correlation does exist between 
Medical Aptitude Test scores and academic achievement 
the correlation coefficient would be low. 

It is noted that there is a positive correlation 
throughout, except in one case. This would indicate that 
the test does predict scholastic achievement to a certain 
extent. However, because the correlation coefficients 
are low it would seem inadvisable to use the Moss Aptitude 
Test as a single criterion for admission to medical 
school. 

Many students in this study with low Aptitude Test 

\ 

scores have successfully completed four shears of medicine* 
For example: Subject #1 with a Medical Aptitude Test score 
of 29% completed his four years of medicine with an 
average of 71%. Subject $56 with a M.A. Test score of 38% 
completed four years of medicine with an average of 67%. 

On the other hand, it is also true that some with high 
M.A. Test scores made low marks in medical school. For 
example: Subject $94 with a M.A. Test score of 69% had an 

average of 55% on first year medicine and then did not 
continue with his course. Subject $207 with a M.A. Test 
score of 84% made an average of 69% on first year medicine. 
It is pointed out here that the highest M.A. Test score 
on record for this study for University of Alberta students 
is 86%.

Distribution of Total Scores 

Referring to Table IV, it is evident that the medians 
attained by the University of Alberta students were lower on 
every form than those for the total group. The differences 
range from 2.4% on Form 9 to 11.2% on Form 8. Qi and were 
also lower in every case. The results seem to indicate that 
Canadian students are penalized on certain questions as 
compared with students in the United States. This is borne 
out by the fact that Dr. F.A. Moss, Director of the Study, has 
himself stated in his report to the University of Alberta on 
results on Form 8 that some general information questions on 
the test give an advantage to students in the United States 
as compared with those with a Canadian background. 

On iForm 10 of the test, Test 4 dealing with General 
Information has 22 questions of United States origin and 
5 of British origin. This would penalize a Canadian student 
about 4% in writing the test. It is noted, however, that 
on Dorm 13 of the test, the General Information section was 
omitted, since it was found that it does not predict 
medical ability. 

On Forms 8 to 12 inclusive the median score of 
University of Alberta students is on the average 6% lower 
than that for the whole group. Qg is more than 7% lower 
and nearly 5% lower. This may indicate that University 
of Alberta students are penalized on the test to the extent 
of about 6%. 









37 


Medical Aptitude Test Scores of Students Failing in one or 
more Subjects in Medical School 


Table V shows the average Medical Aptitude Test 
scores for those who had failed in one or more subjects in 
the various years of medicine. Of those who completed 
first year medicine, 97 out of 129 had no failures and had 
an average M.A. Test score of 56.6%. The average M.A. Test 
score for the total group was 55.7% which may indicate that 
the test score has little bearing on whether a student will 
fail in any of his courses. This is further borne out by

the fact that three students, who failed in four subjects 
each, had an average M.A. Test score of 57.7$, which is 
higher than the average for the whole group and also for 
the group who had no failures. The results are shown 
in Figure 2. 

On second year medicine only, 48 out of 95 had no

failures and had average M.A. Test scores of 57.7$ which 
is higher than the average M.A. Test score of 55#6$ for the 
whole group. There is a steady decline in the average 
M.A. Test scores as the number of failures increases 
except in. the case of the student who failed in 3 subjects. 
The results are shown in Figure 3. 

With third year medicine there is some tendency 
towards a decline in average M.A. Test scores as the number 
of failures increases, except for those who failed in 
3 subjects. These students had a higher average M.A. Test 
score than those who failed in no subjects and also 
higher than the average for the whole group. ( Figure 4 ) 

In fourth year medicine the highest average M.A. 
Test score was obtained by those who failed in 2 subjects. 

( Figure 5 ) 

In the largest group ( first year medicine ) no 
correlation was evident between the number of failures and 
average M.A. Test scores. This was also the case in the 
smallest group ( fourth year medicine). The other two 
groups showed a slight positive correlation. It would be 
difficult to predict what would happen if the numbers were 
larger.

Comparison of Scholastic Achievement with Medical Aptitude 

Test Scores 

How well the Medical Aptitude Test predicted the 
success of the 129 students in first year medicine is shown 
in Table VI. This is illustrated graphically in Figures 6 
and 7. The students were divided into ten equal groups on 
the basis of their scores on the Medical Aptitude Test.

Each bar ( Figure 7 ) shows the medical school average for 
each tenth of the group. In the highest tenth of those who 
completed first year medicine the average scholastic mark 
is 75.2$. In the lowest tenth the average mark is 67.2$. 
The highest average mark was made by those students whose 
Medical Aptitude Test scores fall in the 8th tenth. The 
decline in the average scholastic mark from the high tenth 
to the low tenth on test scores is not gradual. 

The number of students in each tenth with failures 
( average below 60$ ) is indicated at the left of each 
bar ( Figure 7 ), the number of students who made over 
80$ in each tenth is indicated at the right of each bar. 

It is noted that there are more receiving over 80$ 
in the higher tenths than in the lower tenths of the class. 
There is an increase in the number of failures ( below 60$ ) 
from the high tenth to the low tenth. 

Out of the 129 cases mentioned above, 95 have 
completed second year medicine, and their scholastic 
results compared with their Medical Aptitude Test scores 
are shown in Table VII and Figures 8 and 9. Here again, 
the decline in the average scholastic mark from the high 
tenth to the low tenth is not gradual.

.Analysing the results of the average scholastic marks 
for the first two years of medicine combined with the M.A. 
Test scores ( Table VIII ), it is seen that the average 
scholastic marks decrease from the highest to the lowest 
tenth in the test scores but this decrease is not gradual. 

( Figure 10 ) 

Generally speaking, the highest scholastic marks 
are made by those in the higher tenths of the class on the 
M.A. Test but not necessarily by those in the highest tenth. 
In all three comparisons, the lowest scholastic marks are 
found in the lowest tenth on the M.A. Test.

Comparison between Percentile Ratings on Medical Aptitude 
Test and Scholastic Achievement 

In all the studies up to this point the percentage 
M.A. Test scores were used for comparative purposes. In 
this study the percentile ratings of the students were 
used. The results are tabulated in Tables IS, X, and SI 
and graphed in figures 11, 12, and 13. It is interesting

Percentile Rating on Medical Aptitude Test 


Figure 11.- Comparison between Percentile Ratings on 
Medical Aptitude Test and Scholastic Achievement for First

49 


to note that in the first year medicine group ( Table IK 
and Figure 11 ) the highest average in scholastic achieve¬ 
ment was made by those who had percentile M.A. Test scores 
between 71 and 80 and that the highest ranking students as 
to M.A. Test scores had scholastic averages lower than the 
averages between 51 and 90 on percentile M.A. Test scores. 
No uniformity seems to exist at either extreme of the 
percentile range as to scholastic achievement but there 
seems to be a steady decline in achievement from the 80th 
to the 21st percentile rating on the M.A. Test scores. 

However, it must be noted that the number of 
cases in the highest percentile brackets is small making 
the results there subject to a great deal of chance. 

Where the number of cases is larger there seems to be 
a correlation between percentile M.A. Test scores and 
scholastic achievement in first year medicine. 

Table 2 and Figure 12 show the comparison 
between the percentile ratings on the Medical Aptitude 
Test and scholastic achievement for second year medicine. 
Here no correlation is evident. The 71 to 80 percentile 
group on the M.A. Test has only two cases so that not 
much emphasis can be placed upon it.

When the average scholastic marks for the first 
two years of medicine are compared with the percentile 
ratings on the Medical Aptitude Test, there is not much 
evidence of a correlation. The results are shown in 
Table XI and Figure 13.

Medical Aptitude Test.

Comparison of Medical Aptitude Test Scores with Scholastic 

Achievement 

Referring to Tables XII and XIII and Figures 14 and 
15, one sees how the highest and lowest in scholastic 
achievement for first and second year medicine compared 
in M.A. Test scores. 

In first year medicine the highest M.A. Test scores 
were made by those whose scholastic marks are in the high¬ 
est tenth. Those who fell in the first ( lowest ) tenth on 
achievement had the lowest average M.A. Test scores. There

is a decline in average M.A. Te^fc scores from the highest 
to the lowest tenth in achievement. 

In second year medicine the highest average test 
score was made by those in the 9th tenth of the class in 
achievement, v/hereas the highest tenth in achievement rated 
second on average M.A. Test scores. Again the lowest 
tenth in achievement rated lowest on average M.A. Test 
scores.

In both first and second year medicine the lowest 
tenth in achievement rated the lowest in M.A. Test scores. 
There seems to be some correlation between achievement and 
average M.A. Test scores although the decrease in M.A. Test 
scores from the highest to the lowest tenth in achievement 
is not regular. 

Medical Aptitude Test Scores of those who entered Medical 
School as compared with those who did not enter 

Referring to Table XIV it is seen that the average 
M.A. Test scores of those admitted to the medical school 
at the University of Alberta were higher each year than 
the averages for all who took the test except for the 
1936 group. The differences in average scores, however, 
are slight. This seems to indicate that students who are 
admitted to medical school have M.A. Test scores slightly 
higher than, those who take the test and do not enter. 

Too much significance should not be placed in these 
results since many reasons unrelated to performance 
accounted for the withdrawal of these students from the 
University of Alberta or from a medical course.

Medical Aptitude Test Scores and Scholastic Achievement of 
Students in Terms of Achievement on tlie Thurstone 
Psychological Examination 


In comparing Psychological Test ratings with M*A* 
Test scores some very interesting facts are evident* Prom 
Tables XV and XVI and Figures 16 and 17 one sees that there 
is a decided positive correlation between Psychological Test 
ratings and M.A. Test scores* There is a steady drop in 
average M.A* Test scores from the highest to the lowest 
rating on the Psychological Test* ( lower graphs in 
Figures 16 and 17 )

Scholastic Achievement for First Year Medicine compared 
with Psychological Test Ratings* No. of cases - 124 











56 


In comparing Psychological Test ratings with 
scholastic achievement there appears to be little if any 
correlation since neither graph ( upper graph in Figures 16 
and 17 ) falls off to the right to any appreciable extent. 
However, the average scholastic marks of the highest group 
on the Psychological Test are the highest in both 
comparisons.

It is interesting to note what might have happened 
if the students in the lowest quarter on the Moss Aptitude 
Test had been rejected each year. 

In the 1934 group of 18 students who successfully 
completed four years of medicine, 4 were in the lowest 
quarter. They constituted 22 % of the class completing 
four years of medicine in 1938. Their average marks for 
four years of medicine were 72 %, 71%, 67%, and 63%, and 
the class average was 69%. 

In the 1935 class completing four years of medicine 
in 1939, 3 out of 15 students had test scores in the lowest 
quarter. Their average marks for four years work were 67%, 
66%, and 6£%, and the class average was 68%. 

Three out of 19 students in the 1936 class who 
completed three years of medicine in 1939 were in the 
lowest quarter, one of whom proved to be the best 
academically in his class. The three had averages of 68%, 
71%, and 81% for three years of medicine, and the class 
average was 70%. 







CHAPTER V 


OTHER INVESTIGATIONS ON THE MOSS APTITUDE TEST 


It might be interesting to note the findings and 
opinions of other investigators on the Moss Aptitude Test. 

Dr. Torald Sollman^ ( Western Reserve University ) 

states: 


”1 feel convinced that the test has demonstrated 
its reliability for what it pretends to do, which is to 
predict the chance of a man seeking to make good in a 
medical school. It does not predict that this man will 
surely make good. It says that this one has such-and-such 
a chance for making good, and that one has such-and-such a 
chance for doing badly, so far as scholastic ability is 
concerned. In that direction it has definitely demonstrated 
its reliability. I do not see how anyone can doubt it. 

Its value in that connection has evidently been recognized, 
for while it is not compulsory for the schools to use, 
practically all of the schools, 90 per cent or so, do use 
it. Its value is evidently recognized by the applicants, 
because ten thousand of them have paid their dollar and 
gone to the inconvenience of taking the test* Its value 
is evidently recognized by the premedical colleges, 
because some 640 give the test, and the number has 
increased year by year. tf 

2 

Dr. E.A. Moss ( Director of Study, Committee on 
Aptitude Tests ) says: 

"We have pointed out in every one of our previous 
reports that the test should be used only as an additional 
criterion. Where there is a high premedical grade and a 
low test score, or a high test score and a low premedical 
grade, you should be cautious of accepting the man* If 
both are high, you can easily admit him. If both are low

you should have little hesitancy in refusing admission. 
But where there is a discrepancy, caution is indicated." 


J.W. Cavett, Ph.D., A.T. Henrici, M.D., and 
S.B. Lindley, Ph.D., University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, 
in their article, "Tests of Medical Aptitude at 
Minnesota", state: 

"The Moss Medical Aptitude Test, of considerable 
value in many medical institutions, has proved to be 
quite ineffective as a basis for predicting the probable 
scholastic success of prospective students in the Medical 

School of the University of Minnesota.We are 

incapable of explaining the persistent failure of the 
Moss test to show the useful predictive values locally 
that it has shown in many other schools of the country." 

Beverly Douglasf Assistant Dean, Vanderbilt 
University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee, made 
a study of the records of 191 students in the five 
successive classes from 1933 through 1937 and reported 
his results in "A Study of the Predictive Value of the 
Medical Aptitude Test at Vanderbilt School of Medicine". 

He writes: 

"I feel that while it ( Moss Aptitude Test ) is 
an excellect index of a man’s fitness to succeed in medical 
school, it should obviously not be regarded as a sole 
criterion by which he should be judged, any more than an 
x-ray alone should be considered an adequate basis on 
which to make a final diagnosis." 

"It is perfectly certain that the personal 
rating forms, premedical grades and Aptitude Test scores

when considered together, will give a more accurate 
prediction of a man’s worth than will any single criterion 
or any two criteria." 


Gideon S. Dodds^ Professor of Histology and 
Embryology, West Virginia University School of Medicine, 
Morgantown, West Virginia, studied the records of 443 
students admitted to West Virginia University from 1932 
to 1938 and reported his findings in the article, "Aptitude 
Test Scores, Premedical Grades, and Hirst Year Medical 
Grades, During Six Years at West Virginia University". 

He worked out correlation Coefficients between Aptitude 
Test scores and first year medical grades. His 
results were: 

1932 class - 0.33 f 0.08 

1933 class - 0.53 ± 0.06 

1934 class - 0.48 ± 0.06 

1935 class - 0.54 t 0.10 

1936 class - 0.73 ± 0.08 

1937 class - 0.18 t 0.13 

In his summary he states: 

"On the whole, the correlation between aptitude 
test scores and first year medical grades, and between 
premedical grades and first year medical grades was 
about equal, i.e., the predictive value of the aptitude 

test scores and premedical grades was about equal. 

Though the coefficients of correlation give a measure 
of the average usefulness of both the aptitude test and 
premedical grades in the selection of students, it must 
be remembered that in case of each individual student 
these measures must be used with caution, on account of 
the wide range of grades for any given aptitude test 
score value."

O.W. Hyman, Dean, University of Tennessee College 
of Medicine, Memphis, Tennessee, made an analysis of the 
premedical and early medical records of all students 
admitted to the University of Tennessee College of 
Medicine from 1928 to 1938, about 1100 students. He 
reported his findings in the article, "Further Attempts 
to Improve Methods of Selecting Medical Students”. 

He writes: 

"At the University of Tennessee, our faculty believes 
that the premedical scholastic record is the most important 
single factor in determining whether an applicant will 
become a successful medical student. We realize that other 
factors, such as his medical aptitude record, health, age 
and financial resources are important also.”

Report on Study at Stanford University: 

"In 1931, an independent study of the predictive 
value of the test was made by the officials of Stanford 
University and published in their Faculty Bulletin ( No.19, 
December 28, 1931 ). They found a correlation between 
premedical grades and medical school averages of 0.67, 
and between test scores and medical school averages of 
0.64. The significant fact here is not that the premedical 
grades gave a slightly higher correlation than the test 
scores, but that both are so good. The correlation between 
the medical averages and a combined criterion of test scores 
and premedical grades is 0.81, an exceedingly high 
correlation for the combined criterion, and shows clearly 
that the combined criterion gives the best predictive 
value."

Study at George Washington University in 1932. 

An analysis of the test was made by the professor of 
statistics at George Washington University. He found the 
correlation coefficient between Medical Aptitude Test 
scores and medical school average grades to be 0.61. 

o 

Mary D. Salter, Lecturer in Psychology, Faculty of 
Medicine, University of Toronto, studied the records of 
students entering first year medicine from 1937 to 1940. 
There were 473 subjects in all. She states: 

"The Moss medical aptitude test has been given to 
students in first year medicine at the University of 
Toronto since 1937. With the first three classes, the 
scores were definitely related to first year grades, but 
not closely enough for acceptable accurate prediction. 

For the class entering in 1940, the relationship was 
slight. With no class was the aptitude test as closely 
related to first year grades as were high school grades. 

A method of predicting academic success in the 
medical course has been devised and applied to four 
successive freshman classes, including 473 students in 
all. The high school grade and the medical aptitude 
score were combined by a statistical formula to give a 
predicted first year grade. The predictions v/ere found 
to be closely related to subsequent academic success."

Aptitude Test at Woman’s Medical College ", concludes 
by saying: 


"The results of this study indicate that the medical 
scholastic aptitude test has predictive value at the 
Woman’s Medical College, To a certain extent achievement 
in the College varies directly with the aptitude score.,.. 

It is clear that an extreme view of the test 
should be avoided. It is obvious that it is not worthless; 
every section of this study demonstrates its merits as a 
predictive measure. On the other hand, too much should 
not be expected. With the greatest care in the consider¬ 
ation of all entrance credentials, an admission committee, 
because of the ultimate uncertainty of personality, cannot 
forecast all applicants as good or poor risks. Therefore, 
all admission factors should be weighed carefully with the 
aptitude score one of the most important criteria." 


As near as can be ascertained, no Canadian 
Universitjr is using the Moss Aptitude Test at present. 
The University of McGill used the test for several years 
and discontinued its use in 1938 since it was found that 
the predictive value of the test was not sufficient to 
warrant its use. The University of Toronto has devised 
a Medical Aptitude Test of its own which is used by its 
Medical School at the present time.

CHAPTER VI 


CONCLUSIONS 

1. It would seem that the Medical Aptitude Test 
does predict success in medical school to a very limited 
extent from the fact that, generally, positive correlations 
were found, but these correlations w r ere low in most cases* 

2. In general, the students with high Medical 
Aptitude Test scores are more successful in medical school 
than those with low scores. 

3. The students with high academic standing in 
medical school have, on the average, the highest Medical 
Aptitude Test Scores. 

4. The Medical Aptitude Test scores of University 
of Alberta students are consistently lower than those for 
the total group v/ho wrote the test each year. 

5. No conclusion can be drawn as to whether there 
is any relationship between M.A. Test scores and failures 
in individual subjects. 

6. The chances of a student getting over 80$ in 
scholastic work are better if he has a high Medical Aptitude 
Test score than if he has a low score. Also, his chances 

of getting below 60$ are greater if he has a low M.A. Test 
score•

7. The average Medical Aptitude Test scores of 
those who entered medical school at the University of 
Alberta each year were higher than the average scores 
of those who wrote the test and did not enter. 

8. There is a correlation between ratings on the 
Thurstone Psychological Examination and scores on the 
Moss Medical Aptitude Test. 

9. There is no appreciable correlation between 
achievement on the Thurstone Psychological Examination 
and performance at medical school. 

10. It would seem that the Moss Medical Aptitude 
Test could not be used as a single criterion for 
admission to medical school, but taken fn conjunction 
with other factors it might have some value.
