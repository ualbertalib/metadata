1# Introduction 


a) Historical 

Ergothioneine was isolated and named by the French 
worker Tanret in 1909 (24)* The compound was isolated 
as the hydrochloride from the ergot of rye by means of 
water-extraction and mercuric salt precipitation* Be¬ 


cause of its source and the presence of sulfur in the 
molecule, Tanret named the substance ergothioneine. 
Barger and Ewins in 1911 (2), showed the molecular 
structure to be the trimethyl betaine of thiolhistidine*

Ergothioneine remained as an obscure, organic 
base, obtainable from ergot,until 1926 when Benedict, 
Hewton, and Behre at Cornell (7), and Hunter, Bulmer, 
and Eagles at Toronto (8), independently isolated a 
sulfur containing base from hog's blood. The methods 
of isolation used by these two groups of workers 
differed with the result that the analyses of their

respective products differed* The Americans named 
their substance thiosine, the Canadians, sympectothion. 
However Eagles and Johnson (10) showed both substances 
to be identical with the ergothioneine of Tanret. 

In 1928 Hunter devised a Koessler and Hanke type 
diazo-test for the colorimetric estimation of ergo- 
thioneine in simple solutions* Determinations of blood 
ergothioneine were attempted and values for various 
species published (12)* These values were considered 
as tentative however* 

At the same time Benedict and his co-workers also 
devised a method for the estimation of blood ergothion¬ 
eine. After deproteinization with tungstic acid; uric 
acid, ergothioneine, and glutathione were precipitated 
as the silver salts by means of silver lactate* The 
uric acid was selectively dissolved by 10$ NaCl in 
0.1 B HC1 solution* Then the ergothioneine (and per¬ 
haps the glutathione) was dissolved by cyanide. The 
ergothioneine was then determined by means of a uric 
acid test• 

The results of these determinations were not 

published because of uncertainty of the authors about 

.some 

their method* They found that for unknown reason, 
some preparations of sodium tungstate caused removal 
of ergothioneine during protein precipitation* Some

overall figures for blood ergothioneine in various 
species were suggested however. They found that pig 
bloods showed a range of 25 - 30 mg.%, normal humans 
14 - 15 mg.%, and diabetic humans a higher range of 
20 - 27 mg.$ ergothioneine. These results are high 
when compared to our present findings. 

Benedict and his co-workers gradually modified 
their method. In a later paper (4), using molybdic 
acid as the deproteinizing agent and sodium hydroxide 
to dissolve the silver salt of ergothioneine, they 
give the average for humans as 7.5 mg.%; and the range 
of results for humans as 4.2 to 15.0 mg.^ whole blood. 

In a further paper (5), they state that for some un¬ 
known reason, the use of tungstomolybdic acid as the 
deproteinizing agent results in higher ergothioneine 
levels than when tungstic acid is used. 

Rockwood, Turner, and Pfiffner (23), in a paper 
concerned with substances giving a positive uric acid 
test, give some data on blood ergothioneine levels. 

They express their results in terms of uric acid. Since 
Benedict, et al, (6) state that where the silver salt 
of ergothioneine is dissolved by cyanide as the base, 
uric acid produces 7.5 times as much color in the uric 
acid test as ergothioneine, the results of Rockwood, et al, 
can be expressed as rn.g.% ergothioneine by multiplying their

figures by 7.5. 

Some of their averages are: 

Normal humans - 5.3 mg.% whole blood 
Diabetics - 7.5 mg.% whole blood 

Dogs - 3.0 - 3.8 mg.% whole blood 
Rabbits - 3.0 - 7.5 mg.$ whole blood 

Renewed interest in ergothioneine was shown in the 
work of Lawson and Rimington in 1947 (20). Because of 
the similarity in molecular structure of ergothioneine 
to thiouracil and its derivatives used clinically. 

Lawson and Rimington attempted to show that ergo¬ 
thioneine would exhibit an antithyroid effect similar 
to that of the thiouracil type drugs. Since ergothioneihe 
is a normal constituent of the blood, it was hoped that 
it would not possess the toxic properties of thiouracil 
or other similar antithyroid compounds. While the evi¬ 
dence of this work was apparently negative or at any 
rate doubtful, especially in view of the results pub¬ 
lished by Astwood and Stanley (1) and Wilson and 
McGrinty (25), renewed interest in this blood constituent 
had been aroused. 

As a result, a rather comprehensive study of ergo¬ 
thioneine was begun in this Department, in the summer of 
1948, to attempt to explain the presence of this compound 
in blood.

b) Scope of Thesis 

When the study of ergothioneine was begun, the 
exact nature of the problems to be investigated were 
not decided on until some preliminary work could be 
done to give some indication as to what significant 
aspects of ergothioneine should be studied. This pre¬ 
liminary work involved a reinvestigation of the Hunter 
diazo test for the estimation of ergothioneine in 
simple solutions and blood. In addition, the prep¬ 
aration of some pure ergothioneine was necessary. The 
details of this research have been published by Hunter 
(13,18). As a result of this preliminary work, two 
main problems were established as the basis of this 
thesis. They were: 

1) The determination of the ergothioneine 
content of ergots from various plant hosts. 

Since pure ergothioneine was needed for the in¬ 
vestigations, and the yields from blood were insatis- 
factory (18), some indication of the quantities which 
might be isolated was deemed advisable. 

2) The determination of blood ergothioneine 
levels in various species, in normal and abnormal con¬ 
ditions. 

Following the modification of his original diazo 
test for ergothioneine (13) by Hunter, and the possible 
inaccuracy of his previously published data, the 
compilation of new data concerning the blood levels of

various species, especially of those animals which 
might he utilized in subsequent experiments, was 
necessary. 

The data on this second phase of the problem, in¬ 
dicated that the blood ergothioneine level in diabetics 
was higher than the normal. This had also been noted 
by Benedict et al (5) and also by Rockwood, Turner, and 
Pfiffner (23). Therefore another problem was added to 
the thesis: 

3) An investigation of the effect of alloxan 
diabetes on the ergothioneine level in rats. 

Because the elevated ergothioneine level in dia¬ 
betes was persistent over a period of weeks, and be¬ 
cause it was shown by Lazarow (21) that certain sulf- 
hydryl compounds protected rats against alloxan- 
induced diabetes, a trial experiment was attempted to 
see if ergothioneine exhibited a similar protecting 
effect.

2. The ergothioneine content of ergot from various 

plant hosts . 

a) Experimental 

The method used in preparing filtrates from ergot 
sclerotia is similar to the initial steps of the pro¬ 
cess used earlier to isolate ergothioneine from ergot. 
(14, 15, 17). The ergot is ground and boiled in a 
dilute acetic acid solution to extract the ergothioneine 
and to coagulate the protein. Uranium acetate is added 
to precipitate further protein. Any excess uranium is 
precipitated by the addition of phosphate ion. A Hunter 
diazo test is then done on the resulting supernatant. 

1) Preparation of test solution 
A sample of 30 to 50 mgm. of the ergot is weighed 
out. If the sclerotia are large, they are divided, if 
small, as from Calamagrostis canadensis, 20 to 30 
sclerotia may be necessary for the sample. The sample 
is placed in a 15 ml. graduated centrifuge tube, about 
4 ml. water and one drop of 2 N acetic acid are added 
and the tube is then placed in a boiling water bath 
for 10 minutes. The contents of the tube are then 
poured into a small mortar and finely ground. This 
ground mixture is then wholly transferred back

into the original tube using an additional 5 - 6 ml. 
water. The mixture is replaced in the boiling water 
bath for a further five minutes and then it is centri¬ 
fuged. The total volume is noted here for the dilu¬ 
tion factor in calculating the ergothioneine content. 

The supernatant is now carefully transferred to an 
ordinary centrifuge tube and a slight excess of sat¬ 
urated uranium acetate is added. (The excess is deter¬ 
mined by adding a drop of the supernatant to 5^ 
potassium ferrocyanide on a test plate.) From 0.1 - 
0.2 ml. of uranium acetate is usally necessary. The 
tube is again centrifuged, the supernatant is decanted 
into another similar tube and the slight excess of 
uranium precipitated by the addition of one drop (0.05 ml.) 
of 10% HaHgPO^. The solutions are mixed and allowed 
to stand 15-20 minutes for complete precipitation before 
centrifuging. The supernatant is decanted into another 

tube for testing. 

2) Colorimetric determination 
The ergothioneine content of aliquots of the test 
filtrates prepared as above, is determined by means of 
the modified Hunter diazo test for ergothioneine, the 
details of which are presented in section 3. of this

c) Discussion 

It was found that aliquots of test solution 
greater than 1 ml. in volume exhibited gross inter¬ 
ference, i.e. as the aliquots increased in volume 
greater than 1 ml., the resulting color and values 
were less than those given by smaller aliquots. In ali¬ 
quots smaller than 1 ml. the interfering substance (s) 
were diluted beyond their range of interference and 
close proportionality was found between aliquots. 

The dilution calculation (see above) for computing 
the ergothioneine content was not exact. When the 
material was finely ground, reheated and centrifuged, 
it was assumed that the ergothioneine was evenly dis¬ 
tributed between the solid and liquid. In addition, 
small amounts of ergothioneine were lost in each sub¬ 
sequent precipitation, while the addition of the 
uranium and phosphate solutions diluted the filtrate 
from 1 to 4%. Therefore the values given are probably 
slightly low. 

Except for a few samples, triplicate analyses on 
single sclerotia were done. There was a wide variabil¬ 
ity among samples of ergot from the same species of 
host. The ergots of rye, barley, Bromus and Agropyron 
contain about the same concentrations of ergothioneine.

a. Reagents 

Acetic acid - oxalate solutions 
For the deproteinization of whole blood, corp¬ 
uscles, and plasma in 1:10 and 1:5 dilutions. 

1:10 dilution 

Whole blood 1 vol. plus 9 vols. 0.0045 N acetic acid 

Corpuscles 1 vol. plus 9 vols. 0.0030 N acetic acid 

Plasma 1 vol. plus 9 vols. 0.0055 N acetic acid 

To the above solutions are added 160 mgm. sodium 
oxalate per liter. 

1:5 dilution 

Whole blood 1 vol. plus 4 vols. 0.0100 N acetic acid 

Corpuscles 1 vol. plus 4 vols. 0.0070 N acetic acid 

Plasma 1 vol. plus 4 vols. 0.0125 N acetic acid 

To the above solutions were added 360 mgm. sodium 
oxalate per liter of solution. Ordinarily the reagents 
for the determination of ergothioneine in plasma were 
not required since only the cells contain ergothioneine.

Goulard 1 s Extract (11) 

220 gms lead acetate — Pb(CHgOOO) 2 .3H 2 0 
140 gma lead monoxide — litharge (PbO) 

Approximately 1 liter of COg free distilled water 
Boil 30 minatea with stirring or shaking. Cool 
and filter (gravity) into a one liter volumetric flask. 
Wash the filter paper and contents with GO^ free water 
and make up to volume. Keep the solution well stoppered. 

Phosphate solution 

An aqueous 10$ solution of dihydrogen sodium phosphate 
(KaH 2 P0 4 .H 2 0) 

b) Deproteinization of blood 
The preparation of protein-free filtrates by means 
of the commonly used and suggested alkaloidal agents 
was shown by Hunter (13) to be unsatisfactory. Fil¬ 
trates prepared by these reagents often show inter¬ 
ference with the diazo test for ergothioneine, and 
even when interference is absent, the results fluct¬ 
uate although the same blood is used. For these 
reasons a new deproteinizing method was devised (13). 

This simple technique involves heating the blood with 
a weak acetic acid solution. The strength of acid 
used for whole blood is a compromise between the

concentrations necessary to bring the serum proteins 
and the hemoglobin to their respective isoelectric 
points. Despite such rather apparent shortcomings, the 
method in practice was found to be quite satisfactory for 
whole blood, plasma, and cells. 

c. Lead acetate precipitation 

The basic lead acetate preparation known as 
Goulard 1 s Extract (11) was used to precipitate re¬ 
duced glutathione. Glutathione causes serious inter¬ 
ference with the subsequent diazo test, and must be 
removed from the filtrate. It was found that proper 
precipitation of glutathione with the Goulard*s was 
promoted by the presence of oxalate ion in small con¬ 
centrations. Ordinarily the excess oxalate present in 
the blood samples as collected was sufficient, but to 
ensure uniform precipitation, oxalate was incorporated 
into the standard acetic acid solutions used for de- 
proteinization. (see above) 

d. Method (whole blood, 1:10 dilution) 

To 0.5 ml. well mixed whole blood in a 16 ml. 

centrifuge tube add 4.5 ml. of the acetic acid - 
oxalate mixture and mix with a stirring rod. Place 
in a gently boiling water bath and stir. Coagulation 
takes place in 1-2 minutes. 3y thoroughly stirring 
and rubbing the walls of the tube, the coagulated

protein is loosened and gas bubbles released, ensuring 
more thorough packing in the ensuing centrifugation. 
Following centrifugation the supernatant is decanted 
into another similar tube. 

To the supernatant add one drop (0.05 ml.) of 
Goulard’s extract. Ensure thorough mixing by rotating 
and tilting the tube to bring isolated droplets into 
contact with the main body of fluid. Centrifuge. De¬ 
cant into a third centrifuge tube. Add one drop of 
phosphate solution, mixing thoroughly as before. 
Centrifuge. Decant into a test tube. This is the 
completed test solution ready for the estimation of 
ergothioneine. 

2) Colorimetric Determination of 
Frgothioneine . 

a. Reagents 

Diazo reagent (according to Koessler and Hanke (19) 
Into a 50 ml. volumetric flask immersed in ice 
water add: 1.5 ml. of a solution containing 9 gm. sulfan- 
ilic acid and 90 ml. 37$ HC1 per liter. 

1.5 ml. 5$ sodium nitrite, and mix. 

After 5 minutes add a further 6 ml. 5$ NaNOg. 

After another 5 minutes ice-cold water is added to 
the mark, and the contents are thoroughly mixed by

fifteen minutes. 

Alkaline buffer 

1 gm. anhydrous sodium carbonate 
10 gm. anhydrous sodium acetate 

in 100 ml. aqueous solution. 

Ten Normal sodium hydroxide 

Prepared from saturated, technical grade NaOH 
which has been allowed to stand two or more weeks until 
carbonates impurities, etc. settle out. The technical 
grade NaOH was found to be satisfactory, 
b. Method 

If an X ml. aliquot of the test solution is to be 
used, (2 - X) ml. of water is placed in a calibrated 
colorimeter tube. Place the tube in the ice-water 
surrounding the diazo reagent. Then add to the tube: 

1 ml. diazo reagent, then 2 ml. of the alkaline buffer 
solution. 

As rapidly as possible add X ml. of the test 
solution. Thoroughly mix the contents of the tube 
by tilting and rotating. When ergothioneine is pres¬ 
ent a clear lemon-yellow color develops. 45 seconds 
after the addition of the test solution the tube is 
removed from the ice-water and 5 ml. of 10 N NaOH is

rapidly added and thoroughly mixed by vigorous 
shaking. The tube is set aside for three to five 
minutes at which time the solution is free of bubbles 
and the purplish-red color has fully developed. A 
reading is now taken in an Evelyn photoelectric color¬ 
imeter, with filter 520, using a blank, consisting of 
a test carried out on 2 ml* of water, to set the 
galvenometer at 100$ transmittance. This blank is 
stable for at least a week if the tube is kept 
stoppered. (Check for etching of the glass by the 

strong base of the test) 

The color of the test solutions shows little 

fading over a period of 30 minutes* 

Calibration Curve 

A spectral absorption carve (see figure l) of 
the color produced in the diazo test for ergothioneine 
was determined by means of a Coleman spectrophoto¬ 
meter, Model 11. This curve shows a maximum absorp¬ 
tion at close to 510 m>A. Therefore an Evelyn filter 
#520, transmitting in the range 495 to 550 m^ was 
chosen as sufficiently selective for the determina- 

tion. 

A calibration curve (see figure 2) was drawn up 
using various dilations and aliquots of a standard, 
pure ergothioneine solution. If the concentration'of

ergothioneine in the 10 ml. test solution is plotted 
against the "density” (2 - log G) where G is the 
logarithm (base 10) of the galvanometer reading in 
per cent, a straight line results, the slope of which 
is 0.045. In practice, a table was made up in which 
the mg. % ergothioneine in a 1:10 dilution of the 
original material was read directly from the gal¬ 
vanometer reading. 

Blood filtrates prepared as described above were 
found to give in almost all cases (notable exceptions 
are discussed later) true proportionality for diff¬ 
erent aliquots of filtrate. In addition ergothion¬ 
eine added to such bloods was quantitatively deter¬ 
mined in the filtrates. (15) 

The cell volume of all blood samples was deter¬ 
mined by centrifuging the blood in Wintrobe hema¬ 
tocrit tubes at 5000 r.p.m. for 25 - 50 minutes. The 
result obtained was used to express the ergothioneine 
values in terms of 100 ml. of corpuscles since the 
ergothioneine is present only in tie corpuscles. (17) 
Subsequent to the determination ox many of the 
whole blood ergothioneine levels in this project, other 
researchers in this laboratory found that plasma, which 
produces a yellow color with the diazo test, contributes

The color produced by human plasma was found to 
be equivalent to 1.0 — 0.2 mg.$ ergothioneine• A 
fraction of an average value of 1.0 mg. fo, proport¬ 
ional to the plasma volume in per cent, was subtract¬ 
ed from each respective value for human whole blood.

c) Discussion 

The data for the male rats in Table II show that 
the diabetic animals have a higher level than the 
normal group* These diabetics were animals being 
discarded from other experiments and had been dia¬ 
betic at least eight weeks* It was because of 
this evidence that the experiments in sections 
4 a) and 4 b) of this thesis were undertaken since 
the diets and conditions had varied from the normal 
and no controls could be obtained* The small group 
of normal female rats showed a wide "scatter" in 
the distribution of their results, so that the data 
are not likely to be significant* 

The human values were all corrected for the 
plasma error as explained in this section under 
method. These bloods were collected from university 
students and Hed Gross blood donors* 

Determinations were attempted on several other 
species* Sheep and cattle bloods showed gross inter¬ 
ference with the diazo test. The coupling color was 
yellow, but on the addition of the strong base, veiy 
little intensification of color resulted, the final 
color being a dull bronze shade* Combined uric acid, 
as shown by Bulmer, Eagles and Hunter (8) and Davis,

Newton and Benedict (9) to be present in ox blood 
ro&y possibly be the cause of the interference* Mr* 

A Harper of this department last summer isolated a 
substance from ox blood which in small amounts would 
cause interference similar to that shown in ox and 
sheep blood when added to filtrates in which no inter¬ 
ference had previously been found* This unknown 
substance appeared to be a nucleoside of uric acid. 

Several avian bloods were tested. In about 60 % 
of the specimens interference of varying degree 
occured, from slight discrepancies between aliquot 
determinations, to complete inhibition of change of 
the yellow coupling color* In many cases the coup¬ 
ling color was atypical. Mr. K. A. Siluch showed 
that ergothioneine was present in these filtrates by 
means of paper chromatograms* 

The blood of two frogs was tested. The diazo test 
was unsuccessful. The colors produced were similar 
to those given by histidine hydrochloride or hista¬ 
mine, i.e. a deep orange coupling color and an orange- 
red when the strong sodium hydroxide is added. 

Several attempts were made to obtain a positive 
ergothioneine test from filtrates prepared by various 
means from two specimens of human mammary cancer tissue, 
with no success. Whether this was due to the absence of 
ergothioneine or faulty preparations of the filtrates 


is not known

4a. The Effect of ^Alloxan Diabetes on the Ergothion- 

ine Level in Blood of Rata, 
a) Experimental 

The ergothioneine values of a group of normal, 

mature, male albino rate were determined. Part of the 

* 

group were then injected with alloxan to produce 
diabetes. (A 5.2% solution of alloxan monohydrate 
was used, given in a single subcutaneous injection of 
160 mg./Kg body weight.) After five days the blood 
sugar levels were determined by Reinecke’s method ( 22) 
to show whether the animals were diabetic or not. The 
rats were allowed food and water ad lib. The food con¬ 
sisted of a finely ground mixture of equal parts of 
Purina fox checkers and Victor fox cubes. 

In the first test group, ergothioneine determina¬ 
tions were done every week following the injection. 

It was found that little change in the ergothioneine 
level occurred until the third week following the 
injection. Therefore in a subsequent group the deter¬ 
minations were done at two week intervals for six 
weeks. At the end of each experiment the blood sugars 
were again determined to indicate whether the diabetes 
still persisted. The results for the two groups of 
alloxan diabetic and control animals are combined and 
presented in Table III.

c) Discussion 

The means of the two groups indicate that over 
a period of six weeks the rise in the levels of the 
diabetic group was almost twice the rise of the control 
group. This rise of values in the controls and pre¬ 
sumably a corresponding rise in the diabetic group 
could be partially explained by the change in the diet 
of the experimental animals from the stock mixture 
fed routinely in the lab, which was predominantly the 
Victor Fox Cubes. It was found in other projects that 
the ergothioneine level was raised by increasing the 
proportion of Purina Checkers in the diet. The data 
show however, that the diabetic levels increased on 
the average 50$ more than the increase due to dietary 
effects. 

The t values were calculated to determine if the 
controls and diabetics differed significantly. For ex¬ 
ample the t value at the 4 week interval was 2.947. 

The corresponding p value was less than 1$, indicat¬ 
ing that there was a highly significant difference 
between the two groups. 

Determinations on several of the diabetics and 
controls were done beyond the six week period. The 
diabetic values continued to show a gradual rise,

while the control group average wag slowly falling at 
the eight and ten week intervals. 

The reason for this rise of blood ergothioneine in 
diabetic rats is not known. It has been shown by 
Dr. R. Fraser of this department that the mean value 
for human diabetics is significantly higher than the 
normal. The rise in diabetic rats was thus probably 
due to the diabetes. This rise may be a result of 
the general metabolic upset associated with diabetes 
or perhaps is due to some compensatory mechanism 
established by the animal. Recent work on the effect 
of various sulfhydryl compounds on several types of 
experimentally produced diabetes lends some support to 
this latter idea. If these sulfhydryl compounds main¬ 
tain the integrity of essential sulfhydryl groups or 
disulfide linkages of insulin or of enzymes essential 
to the formation or function of the secretion of the 
islets of Dangerhana, perhaps the increased ergothion- 
eine concentration in the blood of diabetics is a 
reflection of an attempt by the body to supply sulf¬ 
hydryl groups for this purpose. (See section 4b. of 
this thesis for a more complete discussion and refer¬ 
ences .)

4b. The Effect of Intravenously-Injected Ergothioneine 
on Alloxan-Induced Diabetes in Hats, 
a) Introduction 

Various workers believe that the action of alloxan 
on the beta cells of the islets of Dangerhens is due 
to the combination of the alloxan with the sulfhydryl 
groups of proteins, with resulting enzyme inactivation. 
It is known that alloxan inhibits the enzymes, succinic 
dehydrogenase, papain, and cathepsin. Active sulf¬ 
hydryl groups are essential for pyruvate oxidation and 
condensation, malate and ketoglutarate oxidation, 

D-amino acid and L-glutamic acid oxidation, and various 
fatty acid oxidations. (Barron 8c Singer, J. Biol. 

Chem. 157:221 & 241:1945). 

Many of the enzymes inactivated by alloxan can 
be reactivated, partially at least, by the addition 
of glutathione. Therefore Lazarow (21) decided to test 
the effect of glutathione on the course of alloxan 
diabetes. Cysteine was also used since it is cheaper 
than glutathione and because the sulfhydryl group of 
reduced glutathione is contained in the cysteine portion 
of its molecule. Lazarow found both cysteine and 
glutathione in certain concentrations prevented the 
development of diabetes when injected intravenously.

immediately prior to intravenous injection of alloxan 
(a 2% solution at a dosage of 40 mg./Kg. body weight). 
When injected alone, this dosage of alloxan produced 
a 95$ incidence of diabetes. The dosages of cysteine 
and glutathione found effective in preventing alloxan 
diabetes were 7.5 millimols per Kg. body weight. This 
is equivalent to 912 mg. cysteine-/Kg. body weight, 
and 2500 mg. glutathione/Kg. body weight. (These 
amounts seem quite large when compared to the present 
findings with ergothioneine). 

Since ergothioneine, like glutathione and cysteine, 
occurs naturally in the body, and in addition is a 
sulfhydryl compound, its effect on the development of 
alloxan diabetes in the rat was studied in a manner 
analagous to Lazarow's work. However due to the diff¬ 
iculty in obtaining pure ergothioneine in sufficient 
quantities, the amounts injected were considerably 
smaller in comparison to those used by Lazarow.

b) Experimental 

Eight healthy, male. Wig tar strain albino rata 
of good size (250-300 gms.) were selected* The buttocks 
and proximal portion of the tail were closely shaven. 

The initial blood sugars were than determined by 
Reinecke *s method (22) and the rats were left with 
food and water ad libitum for 24 hours. The next day 
the .following procedure was used to inject the alloxan 
and ergot hi one ine intravenously: the tail and rump 
of the rat were immersed into a beaker of warm water 
(45 degrees C.) and held there while ether anaesthesia 
was administered. When unconscious, the rat was removed 
from the bath, dried, and a tourniquet (an elastic band) 
applied to the base of the tail. The injection(s) 
were then made into the engorged tail veins using fine 
hypodermic needles (5/8 n 25 gauge). Blood was drawn 
into the syringe before the injection was made, to 
ensure that the vein had been entered. When the vein 
had been entered the tourniquet was removed and the 
solution injected. 

The rats were divided into three groups and in¬ 
jected as follows: 

Group 1 - 4 rats 

a) 5 mg. ergothioneine in 0.5 ml. phosphate buffer-pH 7.4. 

b) followed in 3-4 minutes by an injection of 2 $ alloxan 
monohydrate at a dosage of 40 mg./Kg. body weight.

d) Discussion 

The thesis of P # Wight indicates that the normal 
range of rat blood sugars using Reinecke*s method 
is 80 - 200 mg* % glucose. Blood sugars of over 
200 mg* fo are considered as indicative of mild 
diabetes, whereas values over 300 mg. % indicate 
severe diabetes. 

One of the four rats injected with both ergothion- 
eine and alloxan showed the hyperglycemia which 
developed when alloxan alone was injected. The time 
interval between the injection of the two solutions 
in the case of rat #6, was about 4^- minutes, while in 
the ease of the other three rats receiving the double 
injection, the time interval was under three minutes, 
the interval suggested by Lazarow as being the maximum 
allowable for cysteine and glutathione to be effective 
in preventing hyperglycemia. It would appear from this 
small test that intravenously injected ergothioneine 
even in such small concentration as 0.087 millimole 
per Kg body weight, may in some way inhibit the eleva¬ 
tion of blood sugar, induced by alloxan. 

The blood ergothioneine values were determined at 
the same time as the blood sugars. Ho significant 
change in blood ergothioneine could be found i.n any of

5 * Summary 

1* The ergothioneine content of the ergot 
sclerotia of various species was determined. These 
values may be of use in indicating the best sources of 
ergothioneine from ergots in general* 

2* The blood ergothioneine values of groups of 
several mammalian species are given* It is hoped 
that these data might be of use if further studies 
of blood ergothioneine, clinically or experimentally 
were undertaken. 

3* It has been shown that alloxan diabetes in the 
rat elevates the blood ergothioneine within a month* 

4* A test experiment indicated that the intra¬ 
venous injection of ergothioneine solution at a dosage 
of 0.09 millimols/Eg. body weight, may protect rats 

against alloxan-induced diabetes. 

5. The possible function or cause of blood 
ergothioneine still remains to be elucidated. How¬ 
ever it is hoped that the data presented in this 
thesis may be of assistance in solving thi- proble
