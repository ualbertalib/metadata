ABSTRACT 


Commercial fishing for whitefish in Great 
Slave Lake has been proceeding since 19*+?. Its competitor, 
the sturgeon sucker, has been scarcely exploited by this 
fishery. A two-year study of the suckers was begun in the 
summer of 1950 to learn something of the general biology 
of the species and to determine if the removal of whitefish 
had changed their rate of growth or abundance. 

Sampling was done with standardized nets and 
young fish were caught by seining. Some 1100 suckers were 
examined. 

Data concerning growth in length and weight 
are provided. Mortality rate and growth coefficient are 
discussed. 

Spawning habits are examined. The sucker is 
found to spawn in the spring in streams. Age of spawning 
fish, number of eggs and condition are discussed.

A STUDY OF THE STURGEON SUCKER IN GREAT SLAVE LAKE 

1950-51 

INTRODUCTION 

Investigations carried out in the years 19M+ to 
19*+7 demonstrated that lake trout, common whitefish and 
ciscoes dominated the fish population of Great Slave Lake; 
the former two species now support an extensive gill-net 
fishery. 

The sturgeon sucker ( Catostomus catostomus 
Forster) ranked fourth in numbers and fifth in weight in 
standard gill-net catches. It is a bottom-feeding fish and 
hence a competitor of the whitefish. With removal of white- 
fish by fishermen, the suckers might increase in numbers 
and growth and slowly replace the more valuable whitefish. 

The fishery on Grea.t Slave has been operating 
since 19*+5; several million pounds of whitefish have been 
removed annually. The purpose of this work is to determine 
if the removal of whitefish has made any change in the rate 
of growth of the sturgeon sucker. 

The author was employed by the Central Fish¬ 
eries Research Station as a Research Assistant during the 
summers of 1950 and 1951* Samples were collected at that 
time.

The sturgeon sucker is called by a variety of 
names: longnose sucker, northern sucker and fine-scaled 
sucker. Since only two species of suckers have been 
identified in Great Slave Lake, no difficulty was encounter¬ 
ed in recognition. The common sucker ( Catostomus commersonnii 
Lacepede) is easily distinguished when adult; it was taken 
only occasionally in shallow water. The identity of small 
suckers was checked by counting scales on the caudal-peduncle; 
the sturgeon sucker has 17 or more, the common, 13 or less. 

Little has been published about the sturgeon 
sucker. D.S. Rawson (1951) calculated the growth rate of 86 
fish caught in Great Slave Lake. He also determined the 
length-weight relationship by drawing a smooth curve through 
a length versus weight plot of 350 fish. The largest 
specimens examined were four between 50 and 51 cm. in length. 
They weighed from b to pounds and were 13 and lb years old. 
The rate of growth in Great Slave was found to be almost 
identical with that in Lake Minnewanka, Banff, and very much 
faster than in Pyramid Lake, Jasper (Rawson and Elsev, 1950). 
The food of 160 specimens was examined; in most cases 
advanced digestion and debris made volumetric analysis 
impossible. The average percentage by volume of all foods 
taken was: amphipods (mainly Pontonoreia ), 63; chironomid 
larvae, 15; other aquatic insects (mainly caddis), 11; and 
sphaeriids, 9* Traces of gastropods, mayfly and damsel- 
fly nymphs were found.

D.S. Bawson and C.A. Elsey (1948) calculated 
the growth rate of 76 fish from Pyramid Lake, Jasper. No 
difference was observed between rates of growth of males 
and females but females lived longer. The largest indivi¬ 
dual examined was 12.4 inches long and weighed 13 .4 ounces. , 
Spawning began about June 10, continued to a maximum in the 
third week in June and was usually complete by July 1. Spawn¬ 
ing took place in the streams and certain shallow rocky parts 
of the lake. Fish in spawning condition moved freely into 
the streams at temperatures of 11 to 14 degrees C., but 
lingered in the lake near the stream mouth when the inflowing 
water was at 9 degrees C. or lower. Forty percent of males and 
12 percent of females were sexually mature at 4 years (spawn¬ 
ing in their fifth summer). At 5 years 6? percent of the 
males and 20 percent of the females were mature and at 6 years 
all the individuals were mature. Young suckers were found to 
feed mostly on zooplankton; Cladocera made up 66 percent of 
their food; Cyclops « 4 percent; chironomid larvae and pupae, 

6 percent; Gammarus . 1 percent and terrestial insects, 23 
percent. The food of larger specimens consisted of: Amphipods, 
72 percent; chironomid larvae and pupae, 19 percent; mayfly 
nymphs, 5 percent; Cladocera, 1.5 percent; sphaeriids, 1.2 
percent; snails, 0.6 percent; and miscellaneous, 0.7 percent.

The rate of growth of the sturgeon sucker in 
Pyramid Lake was compared with that in nearby Lake Patricia 
and Lake Minnewanka, Banff* It was found to grow faster by 
one third in the former, and faster by one half in the latter. 

W.A. Clemens (1939)obtained 3 sturgeon suckers 
in gill-nets; one at 200 feet (60 meters) and two at 100 
feet (30 meters) in Okanogan Lake. The two at 100 feet were 
11 3/8 inches (25*7 cm.) and 16J- inches (38.5 cm.). The 
food consisted chiefly of midge larvae with considerable 
numbers of ostracods, copepods ( Cyclops ) and water mites. 

K.D. Carlander (1944) calculated an average 
condition factor (K-value) of 1 .96 for 6 fish taken at Lake 
of the Woods. 

K.D. Carlander and S. Eddy (1942) calculated the 
rate of growth of suckers up to 5 years from a study of 20 
fish from Minnesota lakes. 

F. Neave and A. Bajkov (1929) calculated growth 
rate up to 4 years of fish taken in Jasper Park lakes. 

METHODS OF SAMPLING 

During the summer of 1950 samples were collected 
by any means available; the majority of the fish was obtained 
from commercial fishermen. The legal mesh size on Great Slave 
Lake Is 5s inch stretched measure. Samples were also taken 
in 4J- and 3 inch gill-nets and from seine hauls.

The following summer (1951) a standard gang 
of light weight cotton gill-nets was supplied by the Fish¬ 
eries Research Board. The mesh sizes were !§■ inch, 2 inch, 

( S"o ids colcLx ) 

3 inch, b inch, 5 inch and 5i* inch. These nets A greatly 
extended the range of sizes taken. 

Catch In Different Mesh Sizes 
The numbers, average length and average weight 
of suckers caught in the various meshes are shown in table I.

Ninety eight suckers were omitted from Table I

when the effectiveness of the nets used was decreased by 
river-borne debris clogging the meshes. 

The large number of samples received from the 
inch gill-nets of the commercial fishermen accounts for 
the number of samples listed under 5rr inch mesh. A good deal 
of overlapping of sizes taken in successive meshes was noted 
and a wide range of lengths was obtained. The average 
lengths and weights are similar to those obtained by D.S. 
Rawson (1951) except in the 5-g- inch mesh. The discrepancy 
is probably explained by' the difference in the number of 
samples. The figures in Table I for the 5ir inch mesh are 
averages of 497 fish. Rawson f s figures are averages for 25 
fish taken in the same size mesh. The smallest sucker taken 
by gill nets was 14.2 cm., weighed 1 ounce and was 2 years 
old. The largest taken was 64.2 cm., weighed 7-3 pounds 
and was 19 years old. 

Catch In Seine Hauls 

In 1950 seine hauls were made in the Hay River 
one quarter mile up from the mouth, on Aug. 22, 27 and 29; 

23 sturgeon suckers were captured. All were found to be in 
their first season and ranged in size from 38 mm, to 80 ram. 

A few seine hauls in the lake did not yield any suckers. 

In 1951 two seine hauls were made in the Hay 
River, one quarter mile up from the mouth, on Aug. 15?

these resulted in the capture of 301 sturgeon suckers all in 
their first season and ranging from 33 nun- to 66 mm. Thirty 
three mm. was the smallest sucker taken in the study; it was 
found to have scales formed. 

Distribution Of Samples 

Due to the large area of Great Slave Lake 
( 10,500 square miles) it was not possible to obtain samples 
from the whole lake. Efforts were concentrated on sampling 
the south and west shores; some samples were obtained from 
the Gros Cap area. 

Figure I (opposite page 7 )shows (cross hatch) the 
location of the majority of the samples. Isolated samples 
are marked X. In analyzing the samples the fish from Fish 
Point to Slave Point were treated as one population and 
designated Hay River samples; those from Caribou Bay to Long 
Island were treated as a second population and called Moraine 
Point samples. The numbers of suckers from each are: Hay River 
532 and Moraine Pt.. The Moraine Pt. suckers include 17 

caught in the Gros Cap area. 


Dentil Distribution 

The northern sucker was found in shallow water 
in May and June. Samples were taken at Hay River in from 18 
to 30 feet. In July and August they were found at greater 
depths and most of the samples were taken in from 30 to 60 feet;

AGE AND GROWTH 

The rate of growth of the sturgeon sucker was 
investigated by age determination of 726 individuals. The 
fork lengths of the fish were measured in millimeters 
immediately after capture. 

Impressions of the scales were made on plastic 
slides with a press made from a notary seal. Age was deter¬ 
mined by counting the annuli with the aid of a binocular 
microscope. The interpretation was checked by projecting 
the images of the scale impressions in a dark room. Annuli 
were detected by the presence of incomplete circuit, erosion 
and cutting over. The annuli were most discernable in the 
anterior field but cutting over was best seen along the 
postero-lateral scale radii. 

From examination of the scales the annuli appear 
to be laid down in June. The age of the fish was taken to 
be equal to the number of annuli; thus, a fish of Age Group 
11 (11 annuli) would be actually in its twelfth summer. 

Comparative Growth of Northern And Southern Populations 

When the ages of all the fish had been deter¬ 
mined in this way, the fish were arranged into two groups, 
northern and southern. Table III shows the age groups and 
the average length of each age group for the Hay River samples

that the rate of growth along the south shore is more rapid 
than that along the north and west shore. It can be noted 
especially, in the range from 8 to lb years, from which most 
of the samples came, that the average length of the southern 
fish was greater than the average of northern fish of the same 
age class. Since the south shore is shallow and receives 
several rivers which are rich in organic material (i.e. the 
Slave, Buffalo and Hay Rivers) the conditions for growth would 
be expected to be more favourable than in the more barren 
northern areas. 

The commercial fishermen caught great numbers of 
suckers all along the south shore from the Slave Delta to 
Deep Bay in the summers, of 1950 and 1951* In some catches 
the suckers considerably outnumbered the whitefish. This was 
especially so in Deep Bay. However the suckers appear to be 
encountered in large numbers only in a narrow band between 
the two places named above. In the rest of the lake the 
commercial fishermen take only the occasional sucker. 

Growth of Males and Females

females of each age group are shown. The data are combined

Positive identification of sex was very 
difficult in suckers younger than seven years except for a 
few individuals. In this study fish younger than seven were 
classed as immature. The data in Table IV are plotted in 
Figure 111 (facing page 13) . A smooth curve has been dra\*m 
through the female points. The immature lengths were plotted 
to extend the lower end of the curve. The males appear as 
points scattered on both sides of the curve. This indicates

that both sexes increase in length at approximately the same 
rate. There is no definite indication that either sex grows 
faster than the other. The analysis indicates however that 
the female suckers outlive the males. No males were captured 
older than 16 years, whereas females were taken as old as 19 
years. 


Age Composition of Catch 

*Edser (1908) grouped a catch of fish into 

size-classes of equal breadth and plotted the logarithms of 

r 

the frequency of occurence of fish in each class. A curve 
resulted which had a steeply ascending left limb, a dome 
shaped upper portion, and a long descending right limb which 
in his example was straight or nearly so through its entire 
length. This was soon recognized as a convenient method of 
representing catches graphically. 

*Baranov (1918) christened such a graph a 
catch curve and pointed out its most interesting feature, 
which is, that taken in conjunction with a uniform yearly 
increase in length of the fish, straightness of the right 
limb indicates a uniform rate of survival of the fish from 
year to year and at the same time provides a convenient 
numerical estimate of it. 

The rate of survival, s, from such a curve

is commonly computed by taking the difference in logarithm 
beWeen age n and n-1, a negative quantity; it can be 
written with a positive mantissa and then antilogged, giving 
s directly. The compliment of s expresses the annual 
mortality rate. 

The ascending left limb and the dome of the 
catch curve represent age classes which are incompletely 
captured by the gear used to take the sample: that is, they 
are taken less frequently in relation to their abundance, than 
are older fish. This may come about either because the young¬ 
er fish are more thickly distributed in another part of the 
body of water than that principally fished, or because they 
are less ready to enter the nets. It is impossible to find 
out anything definite about the actual mortality rate during 
the years covered by the left limb and dome of the curve 
because sampling of the population is not random. 

Straightness of the right limb, or any part 
of it is usually interpreted in the manner described by 
Baranov which involves the following conditions: 

1. The survival rate is uniform with age over 
the age groups in question. 

2. Since survival rate is the compliment of 
mortality rate, and the latter is compounded of fishing and 
natural mortality, this will usually mean that each of these 
individually is uniform. 

3. The sample is taken randomly from the age

groups involved. ( If the sample is representative of the 
commercial catch, this condition is implied in 2 above.) 

b, The age-groups in question were equal in 
numbers at the time each was being recruited to the fishery. 

If these conditions are satisfied the right 
limb is a curve of survivorship which is both age specific 
and time specific. 

The logs of data in Table V were plotted 
against the ages and a smooth curve was drawn through the 
plots as shown in Figure IV (facing page 1?). The straight 
descending limb of the resulting curve shows an average 
survival rate of b5% each year after the suckers reached 11 
yearso The compliment of the survival rate represents the 
annual mortality rate of the suckers; in this case 55% • 

Since the majority of suckers was taken in 
5i inch mesh, it appears that the 11 year old class is 
most susceptible to this gear. The samples taken in smaller 
mesh were included to extend the ascending limb of the curve. 
The curve cut the horizontal axis at 19 years indicating that 
suckers attain the life span of approximately 20 years 0

with a standard gang of gill-nets similar to those used by 
the author in 1950-51. The growth data of these suckers 
have been published (Rawson, 1951)* It is important to 
learn if these suckers were growing at a lesser rate than 
they do now. In order to compare this earlier sample with 
the author*s data it is necessary to be sure the age 
determinations were made in the same way. Dr. Rawson very 
kindly sent his measurements and scale samples; these have 
been studied by the author; the age interpretations made by 
Rawson have been changed to suit the author*s interpretation. 
Rawson*s modified data are shown in Table V compared to the 
author*s 1950-51 data.

The 1950-51 age-length data have been plotted 
and a smooth growth curve drawn (Figure V facing page 17). 
The average lengths of the 1944-,46 suckers have been plotted 
on the same axes; the points were found to scatter on both 
sides of the smooth curve. Thus there appears to have been 
no significant change in the sturgeon sucker since 1946.

This would indicate that the commercial fishery has had no 
measurable effect on the sucker. The 1950-51 samples were 
obtained largely in an area of the lake 20 miles each way 
from Hay River while the 1944-46 samples were largely from 
the Ft. Resolution area, but since the geographical conditions 
are similar over the whole south shore region the growth rate 
should be relatively constant. 

WEIGHT-LENGTH RELATIONSHIP 

Immediately after capture of the suckers, 
the fork length was measured in millimeters and the weight 
taken in pounds. In order to convert fork length to standard 
length (snout to end of vertebral column) a factor was derived 
from the data on 84 of Dr. Rawson*s scale envelopes which had 
standard length in millimeters and fork length in inches* 

The equation arrived at was, 

Fork length X 0.88 » Standard length 

Pounds were converted to grams directly. 

Coefficient of Condition 

* The coefficient of condition is a measure of 
the relative ’’fatness" of the fish. Weight in fishes may be 
considered a function of the length. If form and specific 
gravity were constant throughout life the relationship could

be expressed by the cube law, 

W = KL 3 

where W = weight 
L = length 
and K = a constant 

Actually, in nature, it has been found that the value of K is 
not constant for an individual, a species or a population but 
that it is subject to a wide range of variation. The value K 
expresses the relative "well being” of a fish and may be used 
to measure the effects of environment. 

The K-values were worked out for random samples 
of suckers from each of the areas sampled and also were cal¬ 
culated for the 19 j + 4-V6 samples. The equation used was, 

K = 100 W 
L 3 

Where K = coefficient of condition 
W = weight in grams 
and L = standard length in mm. 

K was multiplied by 100 to give a convenient value. The data 
are shown in Table VI.

average K-value was 2.00. Also the K-value varied from year 
to year. Samples taken off Moraine Pt. in 1950 showed a K-value 
of 2.01 while samples from the same locality in 1951 showed a 
K-value of 1.88. The K-values for the 19 5 + I +- 1 f6 suckers taken 
from the Ft. Resolution and Yellowknife Bay areas were almost 
identical to that obtained in 1951 at Long Island. 

A mean K-value for the sturgeon sucker in Great 
Slave Lake was obtained by averaging the data in Table VI. It 
was found to be K = 1.90. This figure represents the average 
of 529 fish from all the areas sampled. 

K.D. Car lander (19*A) computed an average condit¬ 
ion factor, K = 1.96, for 6 sturgeon suckers from Lake of the 
Woods. This figure is almost equal to the mean for Great Slave 
Lake.

Suckers below 35 cm. were too immature to 
identify sex except in one case, a male, in the 30 - 35 cm. 
group. The average weights of males and females, listed in the 
table are almost Identical. There is no evidence of sexual 
dimorphism in weight of the sturgeon sucker . No males were 
taken longer than 60 cm; 13 females exceeded this length. 

These larger females grow heavier than the males but, as was 
shown in a previous section, this is simply because they live 
longer.

The aforementioned equation W = KL cannot be 

employed to describe the general weight-length relationship 
in populations of fishes due to the failure of the cube law 
on which it is based to describe accurately the relationship 
of length and weight in many forms of fishes. 

The following more general equation is a more 
satisfactory method of describing this relationship in fish. 

¥ = CL n 

where W » weight 
L = length 
and C = a constant 

In this equation the values of both C and n are derived 
empirically.

The average weight in pounds was taken for each 
10 mm. interval of fork length. The figure shown for the 
length is the average of all the lengths in the interval. 

The data were converted from fork length to 
standard length as in the calculation of K-values. 

The averages for 639 fish were plotted and a 
smooth curve drawn through them as shown in figure VI 
(facing page 25)* 

The average weight for each 5 cm. interval, 
derived from the 19 J + 1 +- J +6 fish, (Bawson 1951) were plotted 
on the same axes for comparison. The groups fitted the 1950- 
51 curve quite well except for the last two plots. This may 
be explained by the larger number of samples included in the 
1950-51 averages. 

A value for C in the equation W = CL n was 
derived by substituting the data in Table VI in the equation, 

lop- c = I log W . Klog L) x - £log L , £ (log L . log W)

log C was found to be -^.'M-Olk. This value of log C was

The value of n was found to be 2.88. This figure 2.88 is the

The data In Table IX yield a value of log C 
of -4.4572 and a value for n of 2.88. This value for n 
was exactly equal to that obtained for the 1950-51 suckers. 

The values for log C differed slightly in the two sets of data. 

The weight-length relationship of the sturgeon- 
sucker may be confidently expressed, therefore, with the 
formula, - 

log W - -4.4014 + 2.88 log L

By substituting a known length in either of

SPAWNING HABITS 

Talks with the inhabitants of Hay River 
disclosed that sturgeon suckers appear in the river in large 
numbers immediately following the spring break up which 
usually occurs in May. They are taken in nets set to catch 
dog food. 

The author made arrangements with Mr. H. Camsell, 
the game warden at Hay River, to keep records of the suckers 
caught in his net from the time the ice left until the 
author*s arrival in Hay River. 

The spring of 1951 proved to be an unusual one. 
The ice broke above Hay River on May 1 and 2, and a jam 
formed which caused flooding of the town from May 3 to May 6, 
the date the ice in the mouth finally broke. 

The water level continued high and the current 
swift because of a long period of rain and snow. Mr. Camsell 
finally set his net (marked no. 1 on figure X facing page 30) 
on May 17. 

The author arrived in Hay River May 27 and began 
examining the suckers. At first it was feared that the 
spawning run would be over, but upon investigation the fish

Description of Ripe Fish 

A typical ripe female has a gold greenish back 
and a reddish pink coloration along the lateral line. When 
being removed from the net such females extrude eggs in large 
quantities. The pink lateral coloration was more noticeable 
in the early summer than later in the season and may have a 
connection with the spawning condition. The ovaries completely 
filled the abdominal cavity as shown in Figure VII (facing 
page 27 ) which is a photograph of a female in ripe condition. 

A spent female was much the same in outward 
appearance but the ovaries were much reduced, containing 
very small eggs and in some cases were quite fatty, which may 
have meant they had been eating heavily for some time after 
spawning. In some spent fish the ovaries were ribbon like. 

A female was considered immature when the 
ovaries were filled with eggs which were smaller and less 
developed than those in the ripe condition. 

A typical ripe male is a gray green gold color 
along the back with a bright; pink stripe along the lateral 
line. Nuptial tubercles, or pearl organs, develop along the 
rays of the anal and caudal fins and are very noticeable both 
to sight and* touch.

These are definite indicators of a male sucker in breed¬ 
ing condition, becoming much reduced and hardly noticeable 
later in the summer. The testes are highly convoluted and 
white in appearance as shown in Figure VIII (facing page 28), 
a photograph of a male sucker in spawning condition with the 
testes exposed. Milt exudes easily when a ripe male is 
handled. 

In the spent condition the testes are much 
reduced and hardened. The nuptial tubercles are beginning 
to disappear. Figure IX (facing page 29) shows a photograph 
of a ripe male and ripe female. 


Time of Spawning Hum 

Because of the late spring and the cold run¬ 
off from the snow, the water temperature may have been lower 
than that required for optimum spawning conditions. The high 
water level and the extremely turbid condition of the water 
may also have had a retarding effect upon the spawning. As 
may be seen in Figure X (facing page 30) net no. 1 was 
situated in a position across the main channel and took an 
average of 7 suckers per day for a period of a month (Table 
XI). 

One problem was to determine if the suckers were 
travelling up stream to spa™ or down stream after spawning.

Nets 2, 3 and 4 were set as indicated in Figure X. Net no. 2 
was set at the downstream point of Island D but failed to 
take one sucker in 10 days although pike, whitefish and pike- 
perch were taken. Net no. 3 was set in a backwater at the 
foot of the rapids across from the upstream point of Island D. 
Net no. 4 was set in an eddy above the rapids and about 3 miles 
from the mouth of the river. The catches of these nets are 
shown in Table X.

Table X lists the numbers and condition of 
suckers taken in nets no. 3 and 4, and fish examined from nets

in the lake. The numbers taken in net no. 1 for the same 
dates are included for comparison. The condition of the 
suckers in net no. 1 is noted in Table XI and discussed later. 

Fish were taken in net no. 3 as late as June 
12. Since the net was in an eddy beside swift water the 
fish may have been resting before proceeding upstream to 
spawn somewhere above the rapids. Confirming this supposit¬ 
ion is the fact that ripe fish were taken in net no. *+, above 
the rapids, until June 13* There is approximately 30 miles 
of river between the rapids and Louise Falls, which form an 
impassible barrier to fish. The sturgeon sucker might spawn 
anywhere in this area. 

The spawning act was not observed due to the 
extreme turbidity of the water. 

The fish examined from nets in the lake, 
in the period under discussion, were mainly in a spent 
condition (Table X) suggesting that they had already returned 
from spawning. No indication could be found that any suckers 
were spawning in the lake. 

Table XI shows the condition of the suckers 
taken in the Hay River during the study.

Examination of Table XI shows that an average 
of 7 suckers per day was taken in the river. After June 6 the 
percentage of immature fish was very low and after June 17 
none was taken. Ripe fish were taken up to June 15 and one 
additional ripe female was taken June 21. After June 17 all 
the fish with the aforementioned exception were found to be 
in a spent condition indicating that they were returning to 
the lake. 

Only 3 ripe males were taken, on June 11, 12 
and 13. All the remaining males taken were in a spent 
condition. 

Surface water temperatures were recorded on b 
dates. On June 6 and 7 the temperature was 5b° F and by June 
11 had risen to 59°F. By this date most of the spawning 
appears to have been over and this range $b - 59°F could be 
the maximum temperature at which spawning takes place. On 
June 18 the surface temperature was 60°F and the suckers 
seemed to be on their way back to the lake. 

D.S. Rawson and C.A. Elsey (19^8) found that, 
in Pyramid Lake, sturgeon suckers in spawning condition 
moved into the streams at temperatures of 52 - 57°E (11 - 1^ C), 

O 

but remained in the lake when the inflowing water was at 50 F 
(9°C) or lower; this is close to the temperature range 
observed in Great Slave Lake.

Mr. Camsell kept a net in the position of net 
no. 1 all summer and reported that after July b only an 
occasional sturgeon sucker was taken. This would indicate 
that the sturgeon sucker does not frequent the river during 
the summer months. 

Thus spawning appears to take place in the 
Hay River in the spring over a period ranging from break 
up to June 1?. Surface water temperature was in the 50 - 60°F 
range over the latter portion of this period. 

Rawson and Elsey (19^8) found that spawning of 
the sturgeon sucker in Pyramid Lake took place from June 10 
to July. This is roughly one month later than in Great Slave 
Lake. 


Age and Sex of Spawning Suckers 

The age and sex of the suckers caught in 
Hay River during the spawning run. are shown in Table XII.

The Table shows that no suckers younger than 
9 years were taken. It was seen previously (Table V) that 
sex could not be determined in suckers under 7 years and 

5 OTvie. 

although sex could be determined in/\7-year-olds they were 
not sufficiently developed to spawn. The absence of 8-year- 
olds in the samples indicates that they, too, were probably 
too immature to spawn; their absence does not seem to be due 
to net selectivity. Net no. 1 was of 5 inch mesh and as seen 
in Table I, a 5 inch mesh size took suckers of an average 
length of 45.7 cm. Since the average length for female 
eight-year-olds was 37-9 cm. and for male eight-year-olds 
^ 3.3 cm. they would be within the catch range of the 5 inch 
mesh. If eight-year-olds had been in the run in considerable 
numbers it seems likely that at least one would have shown 
up. Hence it may be assumed from the available data that the 
sturgeon sucker makes its first spawning run at the age of 


nine years

It was seen in Pyramid lake (Rawson and Elsey 
1948) that 40 percent of males and 12 percent of female 
sturgeon suckers were sexually mature at b years (spawning 
in their fifth summer). At 5 years 65 percent of the males 
and 20 percent of the females were mature and at 6 years all 
individuals were mature. Thus the sturgeon sucker in Great 
Slave Lake takes at least 3 years longer to reach sexual 
maturity than in Pyramid Lake. 

The greatest numbers taken were in the 11- 
year-old class. The oldest fish taken were a male and a 
female, each 15 years old. However, older females were 
taken later in the summer containing large numbers of eggs. 

The table also shows that females taken out¬ 
numbered the males by 87 to 11 or a ratio of 8:1. The sex 
ratio obtained from the total samples (excluding immature 
individuals) was 485 females to 196 males or 2.5*1* It 
would be expected that the sex ratio at spawning time would 
be similar since the gear used was of the same type. The 
small numbers of males taken might indicate that the main 
spawning run was over when the samples were taken and that 
just the late spawners, mostly females, were caught. It is 
well known for other fishes that the males arrive before the 
females on the spawning grounds.

The average K-value in each case was arrived 
at by dividing the sum of the K-values for each group by the 
total samples in each group. The results appear to be 
unusual in that the spent fish display a better K-value than 
the ripe fish containing eggs. This may indicate that the 
suckers do not eat during the spawning period; the spent 
fish may eat voraciously and quickly gain back lost weight. 
The numbers of samples analyzed may be insufficient to draw 
firm conclusions, but in each of the 3 groups analyzed the 
spent fish had a higher K-value than the ripe fish.

Egg Production 

Ovaries were removed from eight ripe females and 
the eggs were counted by a volumetric method. Three 5 cc. 
samples were taken, one from each end and one from the middle, 
of each ovary. The volume of each sample was measured by 
displacement of water in a graduated cylinder. The eggs in 
each sample were counted and an average number of eggs per cc. 
determined. 

The volume of the ovary was then found 

by displacement of water. The total number of eggs was 
calculated by proportion, knowing the total volume and the 
average number of eggs per cc. 

The data are given in Table XIV.

In order to determine the percentAerror of 
the volumetric method, one set of eggs (no. 8 Table XIV) 
was c/eterm/nofvolumetricallv and the eggs were then counted 
one at a time. The volumetric figure was 37,312 eggs, the 
actual count 38>195* a difference of 883 or an error of 2%* 
Four sets of eggs were counted while fresh 
(No.*s 1 to *f) and four sets were preserved in 5$ formalin 
and counted later. It was found that the preserved eggs were 
easier to handle than the fresh eggs. 

An examination of Table XIV disclosed that 

'not 

the number of eggs in a fish is A a function of the si bo r - a - thor 
• fejfta. 3 3- tho age. A nine-year-old fish, (the youngest age class 
represented in the spawning run (Table XIII) contained the 
smallest number of eggs 17,525, but a ten-year-old fish had 
the largest number of eggs 60,307* The nine-year-old fish 
weighed 2.h pounds and the ten-year-old *+.3 pounds. A four- 
teen-year-old fish had 37,312 eggs® 

Eggs from fresh ovaries were examined and 
found to vary in diameter from 1.5 mm. to 3 21m* The eggs 
at the anterior end of the ovary had a yolk the same size 
as those at the posterior end but the latter were invested 
with a thicker envelope. 

As a follow up to the spawning study two 
seine hauls were made one quarter mile from the mouth of 
Hay River on August 15, 1951* Of the 338 small fish taken,

7 were pikeperch, 30 were spottail minnows, and 301 were 
sturgeon suckers. 

The smallest taken was 33 ram; it had acquired 
its scales each of which consisted of the focus and 2 or 3 
circuli. The largest taken was 66 mm. and was also in the 
first season but the scales had formed more circuli. The 
average length of the fish was 50 mrn. 

In 19?0 seine hauls were made on August 22, 

27, 29 and 23 sturgeon suckers were taken ranging from 38 
mm. to 80 mm. They were all in their first summer. Since 
the spawning suckers were taken in the spring and fry were 
taken from the river in the early fall the supposition that 
the sturgeon sucker spawns in the river seems to be confirmed. 

Seine hauls were made along the lake shore but 
did not yield any suckers.

SUMMARY 


1. The purpose of this study has been to 
gather information regarding the sturgeon sucker Catostomus 
catostonius , in Great Slave Lake and to determine if its rate 
of growth has been affected by the removal of its competitor, 
the whitefish, in the commercial fishery which began in 1945* 

2. A survey is given of the methods and gear 
used in sampling the sucker population. A map shows the 
localities from which samples were taken. 

3. The sturgeon sucker is most numerous in 
the southern waters of Great Slave Lake. 

4. Growth rate studies indicate that the 
suckers along the north west shore grow more slowly than 
those along the south shore. 

5* Males and females grow at the same rate. 

6. The analysis of a catch curve provides an 
estimate of total annual mortality of 55 percent. 

7* Evidence is.presented which indicates that 
no significant change in the rate of growth of the sucker has 

r 

occurred in the period 1946-1951* Thus it appears that the 
whitefish fishery has had no measurable effect on the sucker* 

8. A mean k-value of 1.90 has been calculated. 

9o No sexual dimorphism in weight is evident. 

10. The growth coefficient of the sturgeon 
sucker was calculated from empirical data. When used in a
